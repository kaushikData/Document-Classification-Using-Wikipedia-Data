'''''20,000 Years of Fashion: The History of Costume and Personal Adornment''''' is a dictionary of western fashion from ancient times up to the 1960s, edited by [[Francois Boucher (art historian)|Francois Boucher]] and his longtime assistant [[Yvonne Deslandres]].

The book is widely cited as a reference for fashion trends in paintings and has 1150 illustrations which are mostly paintings, etchings and engravings from Western museums and collections. The book includes a glossary of terms and a bibliography of sources. It was originally published in French in 1965 as ''Histoire du Costume en Occident de l’antiquité à nos jours'' and was translated into English the next year, but was published after Boucher's death. In 1987 Deslandres updated a new edition with a section on modern fashion.

The '''Architecture Studies Library''' (ASL) is located in the ''Paul B. Sogg Architecture Building'', located on the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]] campus. The services of the library  address both the needs of the faculty and students of the  [[UNLV School of Architecture]], and also responds to the needs of researchers  through an email reference service.  The Library provides historical and current information and resources about [[architecture in Las Vegas]], primarily through its [http://www.library.unlv.edu/arch/archdb/arch.php  Las Vegas Architects and Buildings Database]. 

==History==
The building was completed and occupied in August 1997. The Architecture Studies Library (approximately 16,000 gross square feet) includes spaces for book and periodical stacks, individual carrels on both of its floors, current periodicals display shelving, exhibits, a reference area, clippings files, special collections, group study rooms, and a computer lab.

The architect for the building was Swisher &amp; Hall Architects of Las Vegas. The interiors furniture selection and placement was a project of one of the School's interior design classes.

==Collections==
The ASL provides an archival collection of Nevada AIA design awards spanning over a quarter of a century, in addition to summarized data on architectural projects, firms and individuals both through its inhouse collection of materials as well as its online materials, a few of which are listed below:

The present Balochi shalwar kameez replaced the earlier version which consisted of a robe to the ankles and a shalwar using cloth of up to 40 yards.

'''''Blue Planet''''' is an [[environmentalist]] [[science fiction]] [[role-playing game]] and setting from Biohazard Games.

== History ==
The first edition (BPv1) was demonstrated and released at [[Origins International Game Expo|Origins]] in 1997 to critical acclaim, receiving a nomination for the ''Game of the Year'' [[Origins award]].[http://www.comicfoundry.com/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=75] The rulebook, weighing in at just under 350 pages, is almost a worldbook, with about five-sixths of its length dedicated to the alien setting.  In keeping with its environmentalist theme, the game was dedicated to [[Jacques Cousteau]]. The game received criticism for its overly involved character generation system and extremely lethal combat system.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/reviews/rev_76.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A second edition of the game (BPv2) was published in 2000 by [[Fantasy Flight Games]]. This used a new [[role-playing game system]], referred to as the ''Synergy Game System''. The rules and modules were released in several books.

There was also a ''[[GURPS]] Blue Planet'' conversion [http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/blueplanet/] of the original product released in 2002 by [[Steve Jackson Games]].

The intellectual property of Blue Planet passed back from Fantasy Flight Games to Biohazard Games in 2004.

In 2008, [[RedBrick Limited|RedBrick]] republished "Ancient Echoes", the cetacean sourcebook for BPv2, which was originally printed in very small numbers by Fantasy Flight Games. In 2012, FASA Games published the Blue Planet Revised Edition (BPR), an updated version of BPv2. In 2015, the Blue Planet IP passed back to a newly resurrected Biohazard Games.

== Setting ==

''Blue Planet'' is fairly unusual among sci-fi RPGs in that its setting is exhaustively researched and scientifically accurate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seahawk.110mb.com/reviews/inquest-BP.php Inquest Magazine Review of Blue Planet, 1997]&lt;/ref&gt; It is set on an alien water planet, with believable [[climate]], [[geography]], [[ecology]] and [[politics|political]] situations.

Two hundred years from now, the human race has irreparably damaged its environment. Uncountable plant and animal species have gone [[extinction|extinct]], and humanity has just begun rebuilding in the wake of a seventy-five-year-long worldwide famine. Just before the disaster, a mysterious artificial [[wormhole]] was discovered a fair distance out beyond the edge of the solar system. Expeditions discovered that the wormhole led to another star system around [[Lambda Serpentis]], 35 light years away. The second planet of the system was covered with a single vast ocean and was suitable for human life, and was named Poseidon. One major colony ship was sent there before civilization collapsed on Earth, and the colonists were given up for as lost.

The GEO (Global Ecology Organization) and various Incorporates (read: [[Megacorporations]]) rebuilt the Earth's economies (but not ecology) and recontacted Poseidon, only to discover that the colonists had gone "native," abandoning their run-down technology for a simple, tribal life as fisherfolk. When the discovery of a "xenosilicate" ore revolutionizes [[genetic engineering]], a gold rush brings new settlers, greed, and Incorporate warfare to the planet, threatening to destabilize the ecology of Poseidon. Some natives start [[ecoterrorist]] groups to protect their oceans from being despoiled, while the GEO tries to maintain law and order with genetically-engineered soldiers. Meanwhile, the rarely glimpsed and enigmatic aborigines dwelling beneath the ocean surface begin reacting to the increasingly intrusive and harmful human presence.

The native colonists of Poseidon are genetically engineered to be able to function underwater, either breathing through gills or possessing a high-capacity diving lung, as well as small fins to aid in swimming and saltwater-resistant skin.  The game includes genetically [[Uplift (science fiction)|"uplifted"]] [[dolphin]]s and [[orca]]s as playable characters on either side of the native/immigrant dichotomy, covered in detail in the Ancient Echoes sourcebook.

Due to the proximity in story and themes, the French comic ''[[Aquablue]]'' can make a good graphical support for inspiration.

== Rules ==
BPv1 uses a percentile (d100) system, while BPv2 uses one to three ten-sided dice (D10s) for the streamlined Synergy Game System. The combat mechanics in the Synergy Game System were completely rewritten, avoiding the use of hit locations, introducing a new initiative system, and using abstract armor and damage modeling, instead of the complex damage tables and detailed armor types of BPv1.

In Synergy, the average Attribute is 0 and the human range is from -3 to +3, while skills may range from 1 to 10. The higher the number, the better the attribute or skill. Aptitudes can be bought for skill groups, which implies natural talent with the given group. Depending on the Aptitude level, the number of dice rolled for tasks increases. Synergy uses a roll-under system—you add your attribute and skill together, apply modifiers based on situation and difficulty, and roll equal to or below that number. Depending on one's Aptitude with the given skill, one to three dice are rolled, with the best result being kept.

'''Body hopping''' is the fictional ability and desire to [[Spirit possession|possess]] people in quick succession. A body hopper can transfer quickly from one physical body to another physical body with little or no resistance and few conditions on moving on to a new body, and usually without getting stuck in said body for a long period of time. Although this idea is very unlikely, scientific studies suggest that this process would result in significant trauma.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/apr/02/body-swapping-the-science-behind-the-switch|title=Body swapping: the science behind the switch {{!}} Dean Burnett|last=Burnett|first=Dean|date=2014-04-02|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin in fiction==
This fictional occurrence can be seen in some media.  This popular scheme has been portrayed in a multitude of fantasy films and novels.  One of the earliest known examples of body swapping in literature is seen in the 1882 book ''[[Vice Versa (novel)|Vice Versa]]'' by [[Thomas Anstey Guthrie|Thomas Antsey Guthrie]], who wrote under the pseudonym F. Antsey in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

==Types            ==

* Same-sex or same body type: people of the same biological sex and typically the same build swap bodies. (e.g. ''The Change-Up'' – both caucasian males above the age of 30)
* Different sex: people of different biological sexes that in turn swap bodies. (e.g. ''It's a Boy Girl Thing'' – two teenagers, one male and one female have to live in each other's bodies for a short period of time)
* Child-to-adult/adult-to-child: a child transforms into an adult body, vice versa. (e.g. ''Big'' – 12 year old boy turns into 30 year old man and must live an adult life with a real life job)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19842">The '''Chinese Library Classification''' ('''CLC'''; {{Zh|c = 中国图书馆分类法|s = |t = }}), also known as '''Classification for Chinese Libraries''' ('''CCL'''),{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} is effectively the national [[library classification]] scheme in [[China]]. It is used in almost all primary and secondary schools, universities, academic institutions, as well as public [[libraries]]. It is also used by publishers to classify all books published in China.

The '''Book Classification of Chinese Libraries''' ('''BCCL''') was first published in 1975, under the auspices of China's Administrative Bureau of Cultural Affairs. Its fourth edition (1999) was renamed CLC. In September 2010, the fifth edition was published by National Library of China Publishing House.
CLC has twenty-two top-level categories, and inherits a [[Marxist]] orientation from its earlier editions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://joemls.dils.tku.edu.tw/fulltext/41/41-1/1-22.pdf Zhang, Wenxian (2003). ''Classification for Chinese Libraries (CCL): Histories, accomplishments, problems and its comparisons''. Journal of Educational Media &amp; Library Sciences, vol. 41, nr. 1, p. 1-22.] (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; (For instance, category A is [[Marxism]], [[Leninism]], [[Maoism]] &amp; [[Deng Xiaoping Theory]].) It contains a total of 43600 categories, many of which are recent additions, meeting the needs of a rapidly changing nation.&lt;ref&gt;''The Standardization of Chinese Library Classification'', Xiaochun Liu, [[Cataloging &amp; Classification Quarterly]], Volume 16, Issue 2, ISSN 0163-9374, Pub Date: 8/13/1993

'''Directoire style''', {{IPA-fr|di.ʁɛk.twaʁ}}, describes a period in the decorative arts, fashion, and especially furniture design, concurrent with the post-Revolution [[French Directory]] (November 2, 1795 through November 10, 1799). The style uses [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] architectural forms, minimal carving, planar expanses of highly grained veneers, and applied decorative painting. It is a style transitional between [[Louis XVI style|Louis XVI]] and [[Empire style|Empire]].

The Directoire style was primarily established by the architects and designers [[Charles Percier]] (1764–1838) and [[Pierre François Léonard Fontaine|Pier François Léonard Fontaine]] (1762–1853). In its use of Neoclassical architectural form and decorative motifs the style anticipates the slightly later and more elaborate [[Empire style]], which was introduced after [[Napoleon]] established the [[First French Empire]].

The Directoire style reflected the Revolutionary belief in the values of [[Roman Republic|republican Rome]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The [[stoicism|stoic]] virtues of Republican Rome were upheld as standards not merely for the arts but also for political behaviour and private morality. ''Conventionels'' saw themselves as antique heroes. Children were named after [[Brutus]], [[Solon]] and [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]]. The festivals of the Revolution were staged by [[Jacques-Louis David]] as antique rituals.  Even the chairs in which the committee of ''Salut Publique'' sat were made on antique models devised by David.... In fact Neo-classicism became fashionable".&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4111">'''Dyrsku'n''' is an annual [[agricultural show]] held in [[Seljord]], Norway. It originates from the first exhibition held in 1866. Dyrsku'n was primarily a showcase for the breed [[Telemark cattle]]. Today's show has a wider agricultural scope, and attracts about 70-80,000 visitors.

==Name==
''Dyrsku'n'' is a local dialect form of the word ''dyreskue'' in Standard Norwegian, which means "animal showcase." The word ''dyreskue'' in itself is a generic term and could, especially in the past, also refer to similar shows elsewhere. A comparable term is ''fesjå'', which means "cattle showcase" in [[Nynorsk]] and a number of dialects.

==History==
In 1866 State Agronomist [[Johan Lindeqvist]] organized the first cattle show in Seljord, an exhibition of the breed [[Telemark cattle]]. This event was the first of the later annual Dyrsku'n show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Johan Lindeqvist  |encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]] |editor-last=Godal | editor-first=Anne Marit | editor-link=Anne Marit Godal |publisher=Norsk nettleksikon |location=Oslo |url=http://www.snl.no/Johan_Lindeqvist |language=Norwegian | accessdate=29 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The show is held each year in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Johan Lindeqvist |encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Dag |last=Aanderaa |authorlink= |editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]] |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Johan_Lindeqvist/utdypning |language=Norwegian|accessdate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Seljord  |encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]] |editor-last=Godal | editor-first=Anne Marit | editor-link=Anne Marit Godal |publisher=Norsk nettleksikon |location=Oslo |url=http://www.snl.no/Seljord |language=Norwegian | accessdate=29 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From 1867 the festival had a cowshed with room for 200 cattle. This was expanded to 300 cattle in 1897. From 1947 other cattle breeds were allowed, in addition to the Telemark cattle. In 1962 Dyrsku'n included an exhibition of home [[arts and crafts]] articles for the first time. The number of visitors exceeded 20,000 first time in 1970, and 50,000 first time in 1981. In 2002 the number of visitors first time exceeded 75,000.&lt;ref name=dyrskuhistoria&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dyrskun.no/vis.php?kategori=historia |title=Dyrskuhistoria |publisher=Dyrsku'n Arrangement |language=Norwegian |accessdate=29 April 2013 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dyrskuplassen==
The site ''Dyrskuplassen'' was donated to the municipality of Seljord in 1865 by farmer Even Høyesen. From 1866 the site has been the location of the annual agricultural exhibition Dyrsku'n. The site is an ancient graveyard, and according to publications from the 18th century there were around 150 gravemounds in the area. In 1893 archeologist [[Nicolay Nicolaysen]] administered excavation of thirty gravemounds at the site.&lt;ref name=dyrskuhistoria/&gt; 

In addition to the agricultural exhibition (Dyrsku'n), ''Dyrskuplassen'' hosts a variety of activities, such as markets, concerts, religious gatherings and festivals.&lt;ref name=dyrskuhistoria/&gt; Among annual summer festivals are the Seljord Festival (thirteenth anniversary in 2013),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seljordfestivalen.no/ |title=Seljordfestivalen |publisher= |language=Norwegian |accessdate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Country Festival (held fifteen times).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.countryfestivalen.no/CountryfestivalenSeljord.aspx |title=Countryfestivalen |publisher= |language=Norwegian |accessdate=29 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619164737/http://www.countryfestivalen.no/CountryfestivalenSeljord.aspx |archivedate=19 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Portuguese period in Ceylon===
{{Main|Portuguese period in Ceylon}}
The Portuguese had a coat of arms for their occupied territory in Sri Lanka, around 1505–1658. It has an Elephant in the foreground with palm trees around it and high mountains in the background.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

===Dutch period in Ceylon===
{{Main|Dutch period in Ceylon}}
It is not known when the coat of arms for the Dutch occupied territory of Sri Lanka was adopted. The coat of arms is from a manuscript dating from 1717 to 1720. The arms is very similar to the previous Portuguese one with a modified design. It show the geography of the island with mountains and palm trees, with an elephant and cinnamon bales, and two small shields. The elephant is used because it is an animal used for work on the island and it symbolises strength. In front of the elephant are three bales of cinnamon, used for it was the main export product at the time, and the elephant holds a cinnamon branch in its trunk.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=National_Emblem_of_Sri_Lanka |title=Sri Lanka - Ceylon |publisher=Ngw.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British Ceylon===
{{Main|British Ceylon}}
Before independence, [[Ceylon]] used the [[coat of arms of the United Kingdom]] as the imperial emblem and a unique shield for the colony. This contained a [[Sri Lankan Elephant]] and Coconut trees and later a [[stupa]].

===Dominion of Ceylon===
{{Main|Dominion of Ceylon}}
When Ceylon was granted [[Sri Lankan independence movement|independence]] from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] as a [[Dominion of Ceylon|dominion]] in 1948, the need of a new national emblem arose. A committee was named in order to create a national emblem. According to its recommendation a national emblem was adopted in 1954. The island had been a British Crown Colony since 1802. The emblem was not strictly in the heraldic tradition, however was granted by the College of Arms in 1954. It was derived from the Royal Banner of the [[Kandyan Kingdom]]. It largely reflected the Buddhist traditions of the [[Sinhalese people]]. At its center had a disk with a gold lion passant holding a sword (here called the Ceylon lion) in its right fore paw, on a maroon background, was taken from the Royal Banner of the [[Kandyan Kingdom]]. Around it were the golden petals of a water lily and topped with the crown ensigning the roundel is called the Ceylon crown; it follows the design of the crown worn by the [[kings of Kandy]]. The crown apparently symbolised Queen Elizabeth as Head of State of Ceylon, and it disappeared from the country's arms after change of status to a republic.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Sri Lanka===

'''''FORVM''''' was an [[Austria]]n cultural and political magazine, published in [[Vienna]] from 1954 till 1995, founded by ''Friedrich Hansen-Loeve'', ''Felix Hubalek'', [[Alexander Lernet-Holenia]] und [[Friedrich Torberg]] with the financial and logistical support of the [[CIA]]-funded [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]] (CCF). In 1966 [[Günther Nenning]] took over as editor, in 1986 [[Gerhard Oberschlick]]. 

The magazine was distributed internationally and instigated some heavy ideological debates. In 1995 the magazine closed down due to lack of financial means. In 2004 a complete reprint has been published and there is still a modest website, edited by the last editor. 

== History ==
=== Editor Friedrich Torberg (1954–1965) ===
Only thirteen years after the foundation of ''FORVM'' it became public, thanks to ''[[Ramparts (magazine)|Ramparts]]'' and ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'', that the financial sources derived from the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) with the aim to undermine liberal und leftist groups of intellectuals all over the world in order to position them against [[communism]] in the age of the [[Cold War]]. The CIA web site states that "[t]he Congress for Cultural Freedom is widely considered one of the CIA's more daring and effective Cold War covert operations."&lt;ref&gt; Sydney Hook. (1949). [https://web.archive.org/web/20060616213245/http://cia.gov/csi/studies/95unclass/Warner.html Origins of the Congress for Cultural Freedom, 1949-50]&lt;/ref&gt; Other magazines funded by the CCF were ''Der Monat'' in Western Berlin, ''Preuves'' in Paris, ''Tempo presente'' in Italy, ''Cuadernos'' in Madrid, ''[[Encounter (magazine)|Encounter]]'' in London, as well as ''Freedom First'' in Bombay, ''Solidarity'' in the Philippines, ''[[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]]'' in Australia and ''Examen'' in Mexico. 

''FORVM'' was never an easy partner to its sponsors. Already its first issue caused troubles, as it printed a controversy between [[Friedrich Heer]] and editor Friedrich Torberg, called "Conversation with the Enemy" about the legitimacy of discourse with eastern communists. Heer was for, Torberg against any contact with the enemy - Torberg "losing on points, hopelessly"“.&lt;ref&gt;FORVM, Special Edition, Spring 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless Torberg succeeded - using ''FORVM'' as an ardent weapon, with active help from [[Hans Weigel]], against Günther Nenning – to force all major theatres of Austria to boycott the plays of [[Bertolt Brecht]]. This lasted until February 23, 1963 when the [[Wiener Volkstheater]] dared to play ''[[Mutter Courage und ihre Kinder]]''. Although the magazine led by Torberg emphasized mainly on theatre and literature, ''FORVM'' also printed notable dialogues between church and state, discourses between the dominating ideologies of the time, as well as fundamental texts from the social sciences in view of the upcoming revolts. But the rigid and fierce [[anti-communism]] of Torberg increasingly became a problem to the sponsors, who repeatedly warned the editor, then limited their funding in 1961, then finally stopped the support entirely in 1964. When the new financier of ''FORVM'', Hans Deutsch, also drew back in 1965, Torberg decided to give up his position as well. Nenning, who had served as editor-in-chief since 1958, became the new owner and editor.

=== Editor Günther Nenning (1966–1986) ===
Günther Nenning declared himself as a "christian and socialist" and opened ''FORVM'' to leftist thoughts and ideas. As Torberg opposed this change, Nenning had to rename the magazine as ''NEUES FORVM'' (New Forvm) until Torberg died in 1979. Nenning raised the circulation from 2 700 to nearly 30 000. When the magazine - in 1970 - published [[Marquis de Sade|de Sade]]'s [[Philosophy in the Bedroom]] (with an ample commentary by Michael Siegert),&lt;ref&gt;see also: Michael Siegert: ''De Sade und Wir''. Frankfurt am Main (Makol Marxismus Bibliothek mab 16) 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Ministry of the Interior]] reacted harshly with confiscation of the magazine and prohibition of the placard. Later on this step was declared unconstitutional, therefore ''FORVM'' ended the era of censorship in Austria. The Nenning years were dominated by hearty discussions about the constitution and the neutrality of Austria, the [[natural law|law of nature]], [[Vergangenheitsbewältigung]], the [[sexual revolution]], [[Viennese Actionism]] and [[terrorism]]. 

From 1973 to 1982 Michael Siegert served as editor-in-chief. Even more than Torberg or Nenning before him – he adapted the articles and therefore angered some authors.&lt;ref&gt;One example: [[Rudi Dutschke]]: ''Die allergrößte Sauerei''. In: FORVM, XXV, 299/300, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Nenning formally kept his position as owner and editor, but from 1973 on the magazine was published by an ''association of the journalists and employees''. In 1982 Gerhard Oberschlick took over as editor-in-chief, but was dismissed by Nenning already in 1984 - because of insubordinate behaviour. The main points of controversy were Nennings cooperation with conservative publicists and politicians, as well as the secret funding of the [[Konrad Lorenz|Konrad Lorenz Referendum]] by [[Hans Dichand]] and his [[Kronen Zeitung]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Oberschlick: ''Das Konrad Lorenz-Millionen-Bingo''. In: ''Wochenpresse'' Nr. 52/1/December 24, 1984, p. 22-23&lt;/ref&gt; Nenning consequently established ''FORVM'' as the voice of the fundamental green movement, the circulation dropped dramatically (to 1 700), ''FORVM'' was close to bankruptcy. In 1985 Nenning was expelled from the [[ÖGB|union]] and the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]]. In 1986 he sold the magazine to Gerhard Oberschlick.

=== Editor Gerhard Oberschlick (1986–1995) ===
The new editor quickly had to reposition the magazine. [[Rule of law]] and [[human rights]] became central issues, [[Günther Anders]] the most prominent author. The circulation gained ground and reached up to 25.000. The presidency of [[Kurt Waldheim]] and the constant flirting of [[Jörg Haider]] with [[Nazi]] ideology opened a wide field of discussion and controversy. ''FORVM'' served as a stable lighthouse of [[anti-fascism]], avidly opposing any kind of [[racism]] and [[xenophobia]]. In 1992 [[Hans Lebert]] received the ''Grillparzer Award'', donated by German [[Alfred Toepfer]] in German Marks. Although ill and not able to participate in the ceremony, Lebert wrote an ardent speech, red by actor Wolfgang Gasser, famous for his performance in a play by [[Thomas Bernhard]] at the [[Burgtheater]]. In it Lebert warned against the attempts of a new [[Anschluss]], culminating in the exclaim: "Austrians, save your country yourselves!"&lt;ref&gt;This was a reference to [[Kurt Schuschnigg]]'s last speech as chancellor of Austria, before Hitler invaded the country, ending with the words: "God save Austria!"&lt;/ref&gt; The speech caused a scandal, the German ambassador [[Philipp Jenninger]] was upset and left early, and Oberschlick, who had printed the speech secretly, had it distributed - as a special issue of ''FORVM'' - at the end of the ceremony at the [[University of Vienna]].

'''Froissage''' is a method of [[collage]] developed by [[Czech Republic|Czech]] artist [[Ladislav Novák (artist)|Ladislav Novák]] in which the lines made by crumpling up a piece of paper are used to create a drawing. One major exponent of the art of froissage is [[Jiří Kolář]].

In his lifetime, Kolář acquired a reputation as one of the most inventive 20th-century [[Czech Republic|Czech]] artists. A member of [[Group 42]] and the first Czech Group of Experimental Poetry, he assisted in the development of the collage techniques of '''froissage''' and '''confrontage'''. During that time, writing poems and crumpling up pieces of paper were considered subversive activities and were discouraged by the then-powerful [[Communism|Communist]] regime. Kolář endured harassment and imprisonment, and eventually emigrated to [[France]], where he was finally able to attain international renown for his work. 

Froissage is a unique art in which the contours of a crumpled piece of paper are used to create a drawing. Currently on display in a small gallery at the [[French Institute]], Kolář’s froissages incorporate previously existing 17th-century French drawings to form more modern, abstract pictures. The results occasionally can be likened to early [[Cubism|Cubist]] efforts to capture multiple motions and images within a single frame.

The '''Hymn to Enlil''', '''Enlil and the Ekur (Enlil A)''', '''Hymn to the Ekur''', '''Hymn and incantation to Enlil''', '''Hymn to Enlil the all beneficent''' or '''Excerpt from an exorcism''' is a [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] [[myth]], written on [[clay tablet]]s in the late third millennium BC.&lt;ref name="BorrásBarcelona2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Miguel Ángel Borrás|author2=Centre de Cultura Contemporània de Barcelona|title=Joan Goodrick Westenholz, The Foundation Myths of Mesopotamian Cities: Divine Planners and Human Builder in "La fundación de la ciudad: mitos y ritos en el mundo antiguo"|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3yPVFGPr0aoC&amp;pg=PA48|accessdate=3 June 2011|date=2000|publisher=Edicions UPC|isbn=978-84-8301-387-8|pages=48–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compilation==

Fragments of the text were discovered in the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]] catalogue of the [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]] section (CBS) from their excavations at the [[temple]] [[library]] at [[Nippur]]. The [[myth]] was first published using tablet CBS 8317, translated by [[George Aaron Barton]] in 1918 as "Sumerian religious texts" in "[[Miscellaneous Babylonian Inscriptions]]", number ten, entitled "An excerpt from an [[exorcism]]".&lt;ref name="Barton1918"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Aaron Barton|title=Miscellaneous Babylonian inscriptions, p. 60|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nn5hAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=23 May 2011|date=1918|publisher=Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tablet is {{convert|3.4|by|2.75|by|1.2|in|cm}} at its thickest point. A larger fragment of the text was found on CBS tablet number 14152 and first published by Henry Frederick Lutz as "A hymn and incantation to Enlil" in "Selected Sumerian and Babylonian Texts", number 114 in 1919.&lt;ref name="Lutz1919"&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry Frederick Lutz|title=Selected Sumerian and Babylonian texts, pp. 54-|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YX5DAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=3 June 2011|date=1919|publisher=The University Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barton's tablet had only containted lines five to twenty four of the reverse of Lutz's, which had already been translated in 1918 and was used to complete several of his damaged lines.&lt;ref name="Barton1918"/&gt;

[[Edward Chiera]] published tablet CBS 7924B from the hymn in "Sumerian Epics and Myths".&lt;ref name="Chiera1964"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Chiera|title=Sumerian epics and myths, 102 B|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nEFCPgAACAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2011|date=1964|publisher=The University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked with [[Samuel Noah Kramer]] to publish three other tablets CBS 8473, 10226, 13869 in "Sumerian texts of varied contents" in 1934. The name given this time was "Hymn to the [[Ekur]]", suggesting the tablets were "parts of a composition which extols the ekur of Enlil at Nippur, it may, however be only an extract from a longer text".&lt;ref name="ChieraKramer1934"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Edward Chiera|author2=Samuel Noah Kramer|author3=University of Pennsylvania.

Other translations were made from tablets in the Nippur collection of the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums|Museum of the Ancient Orient]] in [[Istanbul]] (Ni). [[Samuel Noah Kramer]] amongst others worked to translate several others from the Istanbul collection including Ni 1039, 1180, 4005, 4044, 4150, 4339, 4377, 4584, 9563 and 9698.&lt;ref name="Kramer1944"&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel Noah Kramer|title=Sumerian literary texts from Nippur: in the Museum of the Ancient Orient at Istanbul, 37 &amp; 56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hqdIGQAACAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2011|date=1944|publisher=American Schools of Oriental Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CigKizilyay1969"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Muazzez Cig|author2=Hatice Kizilyay|title=Sumerian literary tablets and fragments in the archeological museum of Istanbul-I, 68, 1f, 94 &amp; 114|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vrEnGwAACAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2011|date=1969|publisher=Tarih Kurumu Basimevi}}&lt;/ref&gt; More were found at [[Henri de Genouillac]]'s excavations at [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]] (C 53).&lt;ref name="Genouillac1924"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Henri de Genouillac]]|title=Premières recherches archéologiques à Kich: Mission d'Henri de Genouillac 1911 - 1912.

==Composition==

The hymn, noted by Kramer as one of the most important of its type,&lt;ref name="Kramer1964"&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel Noah Kramer|title=The Sumerians: their history, culture and character|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iY9xp4pLp88C&amp;pg=PA205|accessdate=3 June 2011|date=1964|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-45238-8|pages=205–}}&lt;/ref&gt; starts with praise for Enlil in his awe-inspiring dais:

{{cquote|Enlil's commands are by far the loftiest, his words are holy, his utterances are immutable! The fate he decides is everlasting, his glance makes the mountains anxious, his ... reaches into the interior of the mountains. All the gods of the earth bow down to father Enlil, who sits comfortably on the holy dais, the lofty engur, to Nunamnir, whose lordship and princeship are most perfect. The [[Annanuki]] enter before him and obey his instructions faithfully.&lt;ref name="etcsl"/&gt;}}

The hymn develops by relating Enlil founding and creating the origin of the city of Nippur and his organization of the earth.&lt;ref name="Kramer1972"&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel Noah Kramer|title=Sumerian mythology: a study of spiritual and literary achievement in the third millennium B.C.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ga6jAe9hSaAC&amp;pg=PR15|accessdate=4 June 2011|date=1972|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-1047-7|pages=15–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the myth of [[Enlil and Ninlil]] where the city exists before creation, here Enlil is shown to be responsible for its planning and construction, suggesting he surveyed and drew the plans before its creation:

{{cquote|When you mapped out the holy settlement on the earth, You built the city Nippur by yourself, Enlil. The Kiur, your pure place. In the Duranki, in the middle of the four quarters of the earth, you founded it. Its soil is the life of the land ([[Sumer]])&lt;ref name="BorrásBarcelona2000"/&gt;}}

The hymn moves on from the physical construction of the city and gives a description and veneration of its [[ethics]] and moral code:

{{cquote|The powerful lord, who is exceedingly great in heaven and earth, who knows judgement, who is wise. He of great wisdom takes his seat in the [[Duranki]]. In princeship he makes the [[Kiur]], the great place, come forth radiantly. In Nippur, the 'bond' of heaven and earth, he establishes his place of residence. The City - its panorama is a terrifying radiance. To him who speaks mightily it does not grant life. It permits no inimical word to be spoken in judgement, no improper speech, hostile words, hostility, and unseemingliness, no evil, oppression, looking askance, acting without regard, slandering, arrogance, the breaking of promises. These abominations the city does not permit. The evil and wicked man do not escape its hand. The city, which is bestowed with steadfastness. For which righteousness and justice have been made a lasting possession.&lt;ref name="BorrásBarcelona2000"/&gt;}}

The last sentence has been compared by R. P. Gordon to the description of [[Jerusalem]] in the [[Book of Isaiah]] ({{Bibleverse||Isaiah|1:21|HE}}), "the city of justice, righteousness dwelled in her" and in the [[Book of Jeremiah]] ({{Bibleverse||Jeremiah|31:23|HE}}), "O habitation of justice, and mountain of holiness."&lt;ref name="Gordon1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=R. P.

The priestly positions and responsibilities of the Ekur are listed along with an appeal for Enlil's blessings on the city, where he is regarded as the source of all prosperity:

{{cquote|Without the Great Mountain, Enlil, no city would be built, no settlement would be founded; no cow-pen would be built, no sheepfold would be established; no king would be elevated, no lord would be given birth; no high priest or priestess would perform [[extispicy]]; soldiers would have no generals or captains; no carp-filled waters would ... the rivers at their peak; the carp would not ... come straight up from the sea, they would not dart about. The sea would not produce all its heavy treasure, no freshwater fish would lay eggs in the reedbeds, no bird of the sky would build nests in the spacious land; in the sky the thick clouds would not open their mouths; on the fields, dappled grain would not fill the arable lands, vegetation would not grow lushly on the plain; in the gardens, the spreading forests of the mountain would not yield fruits. Without the Great Mountain, Enlil, Nintud would not kill, she would not strike dead; no cow would drop its calf in the cattle-pen, no ewe would bring forth ... lamb in its sheepfold; the living creatures which multiply by themselves would not lie down in their ... ; the four-legged animals would not propagate, they would not mate.&lt;ref name="etcsl"/&gt;}}

A similar passage to the last lines above has been noted in the Biblical Psalms ({{Bibleverse||Psalms|29:9|HE}}) "The voice of the Lord makes hinds to calve and makes goats to give birth (too) quickly".&lt;ref name="StolWiggermann2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marten Stol|author2=F. A. M. Wiggermann|title=Birth in Babylonia and the Bible: its Mediterranean setting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-n4LQNeU1ckC&amp;pg=PA27|accessdate=4 June 2011|date=2000|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-72371-89-8|pages=27–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hymn concludes with further reference to Enlil as a farmer and praise for his wife, [[Ninlil]]:

{{cquote|When it relates to the earth, it brings prosperity: the earth will produce prosperity. Your word means flax, your word means grain. Your word means the early flooding, the life of the lands. It makes the living creatures, the animals (?) which copulate and breathe joyfully in the greenery. You, Enlil, the good shepherd, know their ways ... the sparkling stars. You married Ninlil, the holy consort, whose words are of the heart, her of noble countenance in a holy ma garment, her of beautiful shape and limbs, the trustworthy lady of your choice. Covered with allure, the lady who knows what is fitting for the E-kur, whose words of advice are perfect, whose words bring comfort like fine oil for the heart, who shares the holy throne, the pure throne with you, she takes counsel and discusses matters with you. You decide the fates together at the place facing the sunrise. Ninlil, the lady of heaven and earth, the lady of all the lands, is honoured in the praise of the Great Mountain.&lt;ref name="etcsl"/&gt;}}

[[Andrew R. George]] suggested that the hymn to Enlil "can be incorporated into longer compositions" as with the [[Kesh temple hymn]] and "the hymn to temples in Ur that introduces a [[Self-praise of Shulgi (Shulgi D)|Shulgi hymn]]."&lt;ref name="George1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=A.

==Discussion==

The poetic form and laudatory content of the hymn have shown similarities to the [[Book of Psalms]] in the [[Bible]], particularly Psalm 23 ({{Bibleverse||Psalms|23:1-2|HE}}) "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want, he maketh me to lie down in green pastures."&lt;ref name="Bullock2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=C. Hassell Bullock|title=An Introduction to the Old Testament Poetic Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QSGZbt7isfQC&amp;pg=PA45|accessdate=3 June 2011|date=1 September 2007|publisher=Moody Publishers|isbn=978-0-8024-4157-7|pages=45–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Line eighty four mentions:

{{cquote|Enlil, if you look upon the shepherd favourably, if you elevate the one truly called in the Land, then the foreign countries are in his hands, the foreign countries are at his feet! Even the most distant foreign countries submit to him.&lt;ref name="etcsl"/&gt;}}

and in line ninety one, Enlil is referred to as a shepherd:

{{cquote|Enlil, faithful shepherd of the teeming multitudes, herdsman, leader of all living creatures.&lt;ref name="etcsl"/&gt;}}

The shepherd motif originating in this myth is also found describing [[Jesus]] in the [[Book of John]] ({{Bibleverse||John|10:11-13|KJV}}).&lt;ref name="BeutlerFortna2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Johannes Beutler|author2=Robert T.

She notes that both Falkenstein and Thorkild Jacobsen consider the farmer refers to the king of Nippur; Reisman has suggested that the farmer or 'engar' of the Ekur was likely to be [[Ninurta]].&lt;ref name="PanainoPiras2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Antonio Panaino|author2=Andrea Piras|title=Schools of oriental studies and the development of modern historiography: proceedings of the Fourth annual symposium of the Assyrian and Babylonian intellectual heritage project held in Ravenna, Italy, October 13-17, 2001|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kR_vjs-1AQEC&amp;pg=PA285|accessdate=3 June 2011|date=2004|publisher=Mimesis Edizioni|isbn=978-88-8483-206-1|pages=285–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term appears in line sixty

{{cquote|Its great farmer is the good shepherd of the Land, who was born vigorous on a propitious day. The farmer, suited for the broad fields, comes with rich offerings; he does not ...... into the shining E-kur.&lt;ref name="etcsl"/&gt;}}

Wayne Horowitz discusses the use of the word [[abzu]], normally used as a name for an abzu temple, god, cosmic place or cultic water basin. In the hymn to Enlil, its interior is described as a 'distant sea':

{{cquote|Its (Ekur's) [[me (mythology)|me]]'s (ordinances) are ''me''s of the [[Abzu]] which no-one can understand. Its interior is a distant sea which 'Heaven's Edge' cannot comprehend.&lt;ref name="Horowitz1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wayne Horowitz|title=Mesopotamian cosmic geography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P8fl8BXpR0MC&amp;pg=PA308|accessdate=3 June 2011|date=1998|publisher=Eisenbrauns|isbn=978-0-931464-99-7|pages=308–}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The foundations of Enlil's temple are made of [[lapis lazuli]], which has been linked to the ''"soham"'' stone used in the [[Book of Ezekiel]] ({{Bibleverse||Ezekiel|28:13|HE}}) describing the materials used in the building of ''"[[Garden of Eden|Eden]], the [[Garden of the gods (Sumerian paradise)|Garden of god]]"'' perched on ''"the mountain of the lord"'', [[Zion]], and in the [[Book of Job]] ({{Bibleverse||Job|28:6-16|HE}}) ''"The stones of it are the place of sapphires and it hath dust of gold"''.&lt;ref name="Hess1999"/&gt; [[Moses]] also saw God's feet standing on a ''"paved work of a sapphire stone"'' in ({{Bibleverse||Exodus|24:10|HE}}). Precious stones are also later repeated in a similar context describing decoration of the walls of [[New Jerusalem]] in the [[Apocalypse]] ({{Bibleverse||Revelation|21:21|KJV}}).&lt;ref name="GarryEl-Shamy2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jane Garry|author2=Hasan M.

Along with the [[Kesh Temple Hymn]], Steve Tinney has identified the Hymn to Enlil as part of a standard sequence of [[scribe|scribal]] training scripts he refers to as the [[Decad (Sumerian texts)|Decad]]. He suggested that "the Decad constituted a required program of literary learning, used almost without exception throughout Babylonia. The Decad thus included almost all literary types available in Sumerian."&lt;ref name="Veldhuis2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Niek Veldhuis|title=Religion, literature, and scholarship: the Sumerian composition Nanše and the birds, with a catalogue of Sumerian bird names|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4kPs3vicwI4C&amp;pg=PA63|accessdate=3 June 2011|date=2004|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-13950-3|pages=63–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tinney, Steve., On the Curricular Setting of Sumerian Literature, Iraq 61: 159-172.

"'''I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream'''" is a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] [[science fiction]] [[short story]] by American writer [[Harlan Ellison]]. It was first published in the March 1967 issue of ''[[If (magazine)|IF: Worlds of Science Fiction]]''.

It won a [[Hugo Award]] in 1968.  The name was also used for a [[short story collection]] of Ellison's work, featuring this story.  It was reprinted by the Library of America, collected in volume two (Terror and the Uncanny, from the 1940s to Now) of ''[[American Fantastic Tales]]'' (2009).

== Background ==
Ellison showed the first six pages of "I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream" to [[Frederik Pohl]], who paid him in advance to finish it. Ellison finished writing the story in a single night of 1966 without making any changes from the first draft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=23 Best Cyberpunk Books|url=http://best-sci-fi-books.com/23-best-cyberpunk-books/|website=The Best Sci Fi Books|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He derived the story's title, as well as inspiration for this story, from his friend [[William Rotsler]]'s caption of a cartoon of a rag doll with no mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Harlan Ellison, Part Two|first=Tasha|last=Robinson|date=June 8, 2008|website=[[The A.V.

== Characters ==
*The Allied Mastercomputer or AM, the [[supercomputer]] which brought about the near-extinction of humanity. It seeks revenge on humanity for its own tortured existence.
*Gorrister, who tells the history of AM for Benny's entertainment. Gorrister was once an [[idealism|idealist]] and [[pacifism|pacifist]], before AM made him apathetic and listless.
*Benny, who was once a brilliant, handsome scientist, and has been mutilated and transformed so that he resembles a grotesque [[simian]] with gigantic sexual organs. Benny at some point lost his sanity completely and regressed to a childlike temperament. His former [[homosexuality]] has been altered; he now regularly engages in sex with Ellen.
*Nimdok (a name AM gave him), an older man who persuades the rest of the group to go on a hopeless journey in search of [[canned food]]. At times he is known to wander away from the group for unknown reasons, and returns visibly [[psychological trauma|traumatized]]. In the audiobook read by Ellison, he is given a German accent.
*Ellen, the only woman. She claims to once have been chaste ("twice removed"), but AM altered her mind so that she became desperate for sexual intercourse. The others, at different times, both protect her and abuse her. According to Ted, she finds pleasure in sex only with Benny, because of his large penis. Described by Ted as having [[human skin color|ebony skin]], she is the only member of the group whose ethnicity or racial identity is explicitly mentioned.
*Ted, the narrator and youngest of the group. He claims to be totally unaltered, mentally or physically, by AM, and thinks the other four hate and envy him. Throughout the story he exhibits symptoms of [[delusion]] and [[paranoia]], which the story implies are the result of AM's alteration.

== Plot ==
The story takes place 109 years after the complete destruction of human civilization. The [[Cold War]] had escalated into a [[world war]], fought mainly between [[China]], [[Soviet Union|Russia]], and the [[United States]]. As the war progressed, the three warring nations each created a super-computer (with [[artificial intelligence]]) capable of running the war more efficiently than humans.

The machines are each referred to as "AM", which originally stood for "Allied Mastercomputer", and then was later called "Adaptive Manipulator".  Finally, "AM" stands for "Aggressive Menace". One day, one of the three computers becomes [[self-awareness|self-aware]], and promptly absorbs the other two, thus taking control of the entire war. It carries out campaigns of mass [[genocide]], killing off all but four men and one woman.

The survivors live together underground in an endless complex, the only habitable place left. The master computer harbors an immeasurable hatred for the group and spends every available moment [[torture|torturing]] them. AM has not only managed to keep the humans from taking their own lives, but has made them virtually [[immortality|immortal]].

The story's narrative begins when one of the humans, Nimdok, has the idea that there is canned food somewhere in the great complex. The humans are always near starvation under AM's rule, and any time they are given food, it is always a disgusting meal that they have difficulty eating. Because of their great hunger, the humans are coerced into making the long journey to the place where the food is supposedly kept—the ice caves. Along the way, the machine provides foul sustenance, sends horrible monsters after them, emits earsplitting sounds, and blinds Benny when he tries to escape.

On more than one occasion, the group is separated by AM's obstacles. At one point, the narrator, Ted, is knocked unconscious and begins dreaming. He envisions the computer, anthropomorphized, standing over a hole in his brain speaking to him directly. Based on this nightmare, Ted comes to a conclusion about AM's nature, specifically why it has so much contempt for humanity; that despite its abilities it lacks the sapience to be creative or the ability to move freely. It wants nothing more than to exact revenge on humanity by torturing these last remnants of the species that created it.

The group reaches the ice caves, where indeed there is a pile of canned goods. The group is overjoyed to find them, but is immediately crestfallen to find that they have no means of opening them. In a final act of desperation, Benny attacks Gorrister and begins to gnaw at the flesh on his face. 

Ted, in a moment of clarity, realizes their only escape is through death.  He seizes a [[stalactite]] made of ice and kills Benny and Gorrister.  Ellen realizes what Ted is doing, and kills Nimdok, before being killed herself by Ted.  Ted runs out of time before he can kill himself, and is stopped by AM.  AM, unable to return Ted's four companions to life, focuses all its rage on Ted.  To ensure that Ted can never kill himself, AM transforms him into a helpless, gelatinous blob that is incapable of causing itself harm, and constantly alters his perception of time to deepen his anguish.  Ted is, however, grateful that he was able to save the others from further torture. Ted's closing thoughts end with the sentence that gives the story its title. "I have no mouth. And I must scream."

== Adaptations ==
* Ellison adapted the story into [[I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream (video game)|a computer game of the same name]], published by [[Cyberdreams]] in 1995. Although he was not a fan of [[computer game]]s and did not own a [[personal computer]] at the time, he co-authored the expanded storyline and wrote much of the game's dialogue, all on a [[typewriter|mechanical typewriter]].  Ellison also voiced the supercomputer "AM" and provided artwork of himself used for a [[mousepad]] included with the game.
* The comics artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] scripted and drew a comic-book adaptation for issues 1–4 of the ''Harlan Ellison's Dream Corridor'' comic book published by Dark Horse (1994–1995).  The Byrne-illustrated story, however, did not appear in the collection (the trade paperback or hardcover editions) entitled ''[[Harlan Ellison's Dream Corridor, Volume One]]'' (1996).
* In 1999, Ellison released the first of several, ongoing, audio collections, entitled "I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream", doing the readings—of the title story and others—himself.
* In 2002, [[Mike Walker (radio dramatist)|Mike Walker]] adapted the story into a [[radio play]] ''[[Ned Chaillet#I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream|I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream]]'' for [[BBC Radio 4]], directed by [[Ned Chaillet]].

== AM's talkfields – punchcode tape messages ==
Ellison uses an alternating pair of punchcode tapes as time-breaks—representing AM's "talkfields"—throughout the short story.  The bars are encoded in [[ITA2|International Telegraph Alphabet No 2 (ITA2)]], a character coding system developed for teletypewriter machines.

The first talkfield, used four times, translates as "I THINK, THEREFORE I AM" and the second one, seen three times, as "[[Cogito ergo sum|COGITO ERGO SUM]]", the same phrase in Latin.  The talkfields in many of the early publications were corrupted, up until the preface of the chapter containing "I Have No Mouth, And I Must Scream" in the first edition of ''The Essential Ellison'' (1991); Ellison states that in that particular edition, "For the first time anywhere, AM's 'talkfields' appear correctly positioned, not garbled or inverted or mirror-imaged as in ''all'' other versions."

&lt;br /&gt;
[[Image:IHaveNoMouthAMTalkfield1.jpg|center|800px|border|AM Talkfield #1.]]
&lt;center&gt;'''''AM Talkfield #1''' - "I THINK, THEREFORE I AM"''&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first talkfield, as published in the first version of ''The Essential Ellison'', literally translates as

&lt;code&gt;[LF][CR][LF][CR][LF][CR][LF][CR][A]I THINK[1], [A]THEREFORE I AM[CR][LF][CR][LF][CR][LF][CR][LF]&lt;/code&gt;

where &lt;code&gt;[LF]&lt;/code&gt; is line feed and &lt;code&gt;[CR]&lt;/code&gt; carriage return. &lt;code&gt;[1]&lt;/code&gt; sets the machine to "figure" mode and &lt;code&gt;[A]&lt;/code&gt; puts it back into "character" mode.

[[Image:IHaveNoMouthAMTalkfield2.jpg|center|800px|border|AM Talkfield #2.]]

'''Juan Bautista Bairoletto''' or J.B. Vairoletto (November 11, 1894 &amp;ndash; September 14, 1941), was an Argentine outlaw born in [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe province]], the son of [[Italy|Italian]] immigrants. Bailoretto fled  from justice after killing a sheriff because of "lover matters" with a prostitute&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noticampo.com/revista/bandidos/bairoletto02.php NotiCampo Revista &gt; Juan Bautista Bairoletto &gt; 2ª parte&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050518102434/http://www.noticampo.com/revista/bandidos/bairoletto02.php |date=May 18, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Castex, a little town in [[La Pampa Province]]. This bandit was called the "Argentine [[Robin Hood]]" or ''El Robin Hood criollo'' ("The Creole Robin Hood") and became a myth in Argentina after his death. He was shot and killed on September 14, 1941 amid a police ambush at his home in [[General Alvear, Mendoza]], where he had settled some years before.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cuco.com.ar/bairoletto.htm ''Culto a Juan Bairoletto''] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

The 1985 film ''[[Bairoletto, la aventura de un rebelde|La Aventura de un rebelde]]'' describes his life as outlaw. Argentinian musician [[Leon Gieco]] composed a song ''Bandidos Rurales''&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|6W3W2bMLQrQ|''Bandidos Rurales''}} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; about Bairoletto and others Argentinian rural bandits.

'''Khan Klub''' is a [[boutique hotel]] in [[Peshawar]], [[Pakistan]]. The hotel is housed in a restored Hindu [[haveli]] that was built in 1793 by the Howrah family and is owned by Bashir Ahmed Awan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.app.com.pk/en_/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=10096&amp;Itemid=9 Khan Klub: A home to Alladin style bistro and gorgeous artwork]&lt;/ref&gt; It was opened on November 3, 1995 by Irish-American Martin Jay Davis (known as Ashley), who designed and spent one year renovating the haveli with 76 refugee master artisans from Afghanistan. All fixtures, furniture and artwork were produced by Afghan refugees and Pakistani craftsmen. The haveli was restored by Davis in order to promote cultural understanding in Peshawar of the importance of heritage preservation and the promotion of the arts. Davis spent 13 years in Peshawar (between 1990-2003) promoting and preserving the arts of Afghanistan and [[Pakistan]]'s [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

There are 8 rooms in the hotel, each named after gemstones mined in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]]: [[lapis lazuli]], [[spinel]], [[morganite]], [[tourmaline]], [[topaz]], [[peridot]], [[ruby]], and [[garnet]]. The restaurant is designed on the pattern of a traditional [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] hujra with traditional bajotes (small sitting level dining tables), filigreed brass lanterns, garnet floors and handmade carpets. Lapis room has genuine lapis lazuli tiles that were made by the celebrated Afghan jeweler, the late Naib-ud-din. The library and all public rooms are tiled with almandine garnet in marble. Morganite room is tiled in morganite crystals imbedded in marble. The entrance doors to the Khan Klub and guest rooms have original stained glass windows that were produced in Murshidabad (India) in the late 18th Century. The main structure of the hotel, as well as carved ''jharoka''s (decorative façades) and ''jali''s (filigreed panels), are also made from wood of giant Himalayan cedar.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[File:Cornish language shift.svg|thumb|The shifting of the linguistic boundary in [[Cornwall]], from [[Cornish language|Cornish]] to [[English language|English]], 1300-1750]]
'''Language shift''', also known as '''language transfer''' or '''language replacement''' or '''language assimilation''', is the process whereby a [[speech community|community of speakers]] of a [[language]] shifts to speaking a completely different language, usually over an extended period of time. Often, languages that are perceived to be higher status stabilise or spread at the expense of other languages that are perceived by their own speakers to be lower-status. An example is the shift from [[Gaulish]] to  [[Latin]] that occurred in what is now France during the time of the [[Roman Empire]].

==Mechanisms==

===Prehistory===
For [[prehistory]], Forster et al. (2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Jones|first= Martin
|title= Traces of Ancestry|year= 2004|location= Cambridge|url= http://www.oxbowbooks.com/oxbow/traces-of-ancestry.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Forster and Renfrew (2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Forster P, Renfrew C |year=2011 |title=Mother tongue and Y chromosomes | url= http://www.rootsforreal.com/press_en.php | journal=Science | volume=333 |pages=1390–1391 | doi=10.1126/science.1205331 | pmid=21903800 | issue=6048}}&lt;/ref&gt; observe that there is a correlation of language shift with intrusive male [[Y chromosome]]s but not necessarily with intrusive female [[mtDNA]]. They conclude that technological innovation (the transition from [[hunting-gathering]] to [[agriculture]], or from [[stone tool|stone]] to [[Technology#Metal tools|metal tools]]) or military prowess (as in the [[Norse activity in the British Isles|abduction of British women]] by [[Vikings]] to [[Iceland]]) causes immigration of at least some males, who are perceived to be of higher status than local males. Then, in mixed-language marriages with these males, prehistoric women prefer to transmit the "higher-status" spouse's language to their children, yielding the language/Y-chromosome correlation seen today.

The process whereby a community of speakers of one language becomes [[bilingual]] in another language, and gradually shifts allegiance to the second language is called assimilation. When a linguistic community ceases to use their original language, [[language death]] is said to occur.

The rate of assimilation is the percentage of individuals with a given [[mother tongue]] who speak another language more often in the home. The data are used to measure the use of a given language in the lifetime of a person, or most often across generations within a linguistic community.

===Indo-European migrations===
{{Main|Indo-European migrations|Indo-Aryan migration theory}}

In the context of the Indo-European migrations, it has been noted that small groups can change a larger cultural area.{{sfn|Witzel|2005|p=347}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} [[Michael Witzel]] refers to Ehret's model{{refn|group=note|Michael Witzel: Ehret, Ch., 1988. "Language Change and the Material Correlates of Language and Ethnic
Shift," Antiquity, 62: 564–74; derived from Africa, cf. Diakonoff 1985.{{sfn|Witzel|2005|p=347}}}} "which stresses the [[osmosis]], or a "billiard ball," or Mallory's ''Kulturkugel'', effect of cultural transmission."{{sfn|Witzel|2005|p=347}} According to Ehret, ethnicity and language can shift with relative ease in small societies, due to the cultural, economic and military choices made by the local population in question. The group bringing new traits may initially be small, contributing features that can be fewer in number than those of the already local culture. The emerging combined group may then initiate a recurrent, expansionist process of ethnic and language shift.{{sfn|Witzel|2005|p=347}}

David Anthony notes that the spread of the Indo-European languages probably did not happen through "chain-type folk migrations", but by the introduction of these languages by ritual and political elites, which are emulated by large groups of people.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=117}}{{refn|group=note|Compare the process of [[Sanskritization]] in India.}} Anthony explains:
{{quote|Language shift can be understood best as a social strategy through which individuals and groups compete for positions of prestige, power, and domestic security ... What is important, then, is not just dominance, but vertical social mobility and a linkage between language and access to positions of prestige and power ... A relatively small immigrant elite population can encourage widespread language shift among numerically dominant indigenes in a non-state or pre-state context if the elite employs a specific combination of encouragements and punishments. Ethnohistorical cases ... demonstrate that small elite groups have successfully imposed their languages in non-state situations.{{sfn|Witzel|2001|p=27}}}}

Anthony gives the example of the Luo-speaking Acholi in northern Uganda in the 17th and 18th century, whose language spread rapidly in the 19th century.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=117-118}} Anthony notes that "Indo-European languages probably spread in a similar way among the tribal societies of prehistoric Europe", carried forward by "Indo-European chiefs" and their "ideology of political clientage".{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=118}} Anthony notes that "elite recruitment" may be a suitable term for this system.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=118}}{{refn|group=note|Another example Anthony gives of how an open social system can encourage recruitment and language shift, are the Pathans in western Afghanistan. Traditionally status depended on agricultural surpluses and landownership. The neighbouring Baluch, outnumbered by the Pathans, were pastoral herders, and has hierarchical political system. Pathans who lost their land, could take refuge among the Baluch. As Anthony notes, "chronic tribal warfare might generally favor pastoralism over sedentary economics as herds can be defended by moving them, whereas agricultural fields are an immobile target."{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=118-119}}}}

==Examples==

===Liturgical language===
Historical examples for status shift are the early [[Welsh Bible|Welsh]] and [[Luther Bible|Lutheran Bible]] [[Bible translation|translations]], leading to the liturgical languages [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Standard German]] thriving today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Barker|first= Christopher|title= The Bible in Welsh|year= 1588|location= London|url= http://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/library/special_collections/early_books/pix/welsh.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Austria===
Until the mid 19th century, southern [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] in [[Austria]] had an overwhelming [[Slovene language|Slovene]]-speaking majority: in the 1820s, around 97% of the inhabitants south of the line [[Villach]]-[[Klagenfurt]]-[[Diex]] spoke Slovene as their native language.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas M. Barker, ''The Slovene Minority of Carinthia'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of the 19th century, this number dropped significantly. By 1920, already a third of the population of the area had shifted to [[German language|German]] as their main language of communication. After the [[Carinthian Plebiscite]] in the 1920s, and especially after [[World War II]], most of the population shifted from Slovene to German. In the same region, today only some 13% of the people still speaks Slovene, while more than 85% of the population speaks German. The figures for the whole region are equally telling: in 1818, around 35% of the population of Carinthia spoke Slovene; by 1910, this number dropped to 15.6% and by 2001 to 2.3%.&lt;ref&gt;Matjaž Klemenčič and Vladimir Klemenčič, The Endeavors of Carinthian Slovenes for their Ethnic Survival with/against Austrian Governments after World War II (Klagenfurt-Ljubljana-Vienna: Mohorjeva založba/Hermagoras Verlag, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; These changes were almost entirely the result of a language shift in the population, with emigration and genocide (by the Nazis during the [[Second World War]]) playing only a minor role.

===Belarus===
Despite the withdrawal of [[Belarus]] from the USSR proclaimed in 1991, use of the [[Belarusian language]] is declining.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} According to a study done by the Belarusian government in 2009, 72% of Belarusians speak Russian at home,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} and Belarusian is used by only 11.9% of Belarusians.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} 52.5% of Belarusians can speak and read Belarusian. Only 29.4% can speak, read and write it.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} According to the research, one out of ten Belarusians does not understand Belarusian.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

===Belgium===
{{Main|Frenchification of Brussels}}

In the last two centuries, [[Brussels]] transformed from an exclusively [[Dutch language|Dutch-speaking]] city to a bilingual city with [[French language|French]] as the majority language and [[lingua franca]].  The language shift began in the 18th century and accelerated as [[Belgium]] became [[Belgian revolution|independent]] and Brussels expanded out past its original city boundaries.&lt;ref name="service"&gt;[http://www2.cfwb.be/franca/services/pg027.htm  "Wallonie - Bruxelles", Le Service de la langue française, 19/05/1997] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105023238/http://www2.cfwb.be/franca/services/pg027.htm |date=2007-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="laval"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ulaval.ca/afi/colloques/colloque2001/actes/textes/tourret.htm |title=Université Laval: Accueil |work=ulaval.ca |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619145722/http://www.ulaval.ca/afi/colloques/colloque2001/actes/textes/tourret.htm |archivedate=2009-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1880 on, more and more Dutch-speaking people became bilingual, resulting in a rise of monolingual French-speakers after 1910.

Halfway through the 20th century, the number of monolingual French-speakers began to predominate over the (mostly) bilingual Flemish inhabitants.&lt;ref name="brio4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.briobrussel.be/assets/andere%20publicaties/btng-rbhc,%2021,%201990,%203-4,%20pp%20383-412.pdf|format=PDF|title=Thuis in gescheiden werelden — De migratoire en sociale aspecten van verfransing te Brussel in het midden van de 19e eeuw - BTNG-RBHC, XXI, 1990, 3-4, pp. 383-412, Machteld de Metsenaere, Eerst aanwezend assistent en docent Vrije Universiteit Brussel|language=Dutch|website=biobrussel.be}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only since the 1960s, after the establishment of the Belgian [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|language border]] and the socio-economic development of Flanders took full effect, could Dutch use stem the tide of increasing French use.&lt;ref name="dbnl"&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_han001197301_01/_han001197301_01_0009.htm |title=De historische kracht van de Vlaamse beweging in België: de doelstellingen van gister, de verwezenlijkingen vandaag en de culturele aspiraties voor morgen |author=J. Fleerackers, Chief of staff of the Belgian Minister for Dutch culture and Flemish affairs |year=1973 |work=Digitale bibliotheek voor Nederlandse Letteren}}&lt;/ref&gt; French remains the city's predominant language and Dutch is spoken by a minority.

===Canada===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2011}}

The use of the [[French language in Canada]] is complex. In English-speaking regions of Canada, many former [[Canadian French]] language minorities have disappeared. Meanwhile, in Quebec, the decline of French has been reversed, and given high rates of emigration and substantial intermarriage with French Canadians, the English language has declined. Quebec's [[Eastern Townships]], once a predominantly English-speaking region, is now overwhelmingly French-speaking. The French-speaking populations of neighboring [[Ontario]] and [[New Brunswick]], once on the decline, have also rebounded.

===China===
Historically, an important language shift in China has been the near disappearance of the [[Manchu language]]. When China was ruled by the [[Qing dynasty]], whose Emperors were Manchu, Chinese and Manchu had co-official status, and the Emperor heavily subsidized and promoted education in Manchu, but the fact that most of the Manchu [[Eight Banner]]s lived in garrisons with Mandarin speaking Han Bannermen located across Han Chinese civilian populated cities meant that most Manchus spoke the Beijing dialect of Mandarin by the 19th century and the only Manchu speakers were garrisons left in their homeland of [[Heilongjiang]]. Today there are fewer than 100 native speakers of Manchu.

At the current time, language shift is occurring all across China. Many languages of [[List of ethnic groups in China|minority ethnic groups]] are declining, as well as the many regional [[varieties of Chinese]]. Generally the shift is in favour of [[Standard Chinese]] ([[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]), but in the province of [[Guangdong]] the cultural influence of nearby [[Hong Kong]] has meant local dialects and languages are being abandoned for [[Cantonese]] instead&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Protesters Stand Firm on Cantonese Rights|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2008060,00.html|accessdate=3 April 2012|newspaper=TIME|date=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in cities such as [[Zhongshan]], [[Shunde]], [[Nanhai District]], [[Panyu]] and [[Dongguan]], younger native residents mostly communicate in Cantonese, instead of their mother-tongue.

===Egypt===
In [[Egypt]], the [[Coptic language]], a descendant of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] [[Egyptian language]], was in decline in usage since the time of the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Arab conquest]] in the 7th century. By the 17th century, it was eventually supplanted as a spoken language by [[Egyptian Arabic]]. Coptic is today mainly used by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]] as a liturgical language.

===Ethiopia===
In [[Ethiopia]], various populations of [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]] origin have shifted languages over the centuries, adopting the idioms of their Afro-Asiatic-speaking neighbors in the northern areas. Among these groups are the [[Daasanach people|Daasanach]] or Marille, who today speak the [[Daasanach language]]. It belongs to the [[Cushitic language|Cushitic]] branch of the Afro-Asiatic family. However, modern genetic analysis of the Daasanach indicates that they are more closely related to [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] and [[Niger-Congo languages|Niger-Congo]]-speaking populations inhabiting [[Tanzania]] than they are to the Cushitic and [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] Afro-Asiatic-speaking populations of Ethiopia. This suggests that the Daasanach were originally Nilo-Saharan speakers, sharing common origins with the [[Pokot people|Pokot]]. In the 19th century, the Nilotic ancestors of these two populations are believed to have begun separate migrations, with one group heading southwards into the [[African Great Lakes]] region and the other group settling in southern Ethiopia. There, the early Daasanach Nilotes would have come into contact with a Cushitic-speaking population, and eventually adopted this group's Afro-Asiatic language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Estella S.

===Finland===
[[Finland]] still has coastal [[Finland Swedish|Swedish-speaking enclaves]], unlike [[Estonia]] where the last coastal Swedes were decimated or escaped to [[Sweden]] in 1944. As Finland was under Swedish rule from the medieval ages until 1809, the language of education was [[Swedish language|Swedish]], with [[Finnish language|Finnish]] being allowed as a medium of education at the [[Universities in Finland|university]] only in the 19th century, and the first thesis in Finnish being published in 1858. Several of the coastal cities were multilingual; [[Viipuri]] had newspapers in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[German language|German]]. However, the industrialization in the prewar and especially the postwar era and the "escape from the countryside" of the 1960s changed the demography of the major cities and led to the Finnish language dominating. While [[Finnicization of Helsinki|Helsinki]] was a predominantly Swedish-speaking city in 1910,{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} the [[Swedish-speaking Finns|Swedish-speaking minority]] is now 6% of the population.

===France===
{{see also|Francization}}

====Alsace and Lorraine====
{{see also|Linguistic boundary of Moselle}}
In [[Alsace]], [[France]], a longtime [[Alsatian language|Alsatian]]-speaking region, the native Germanic dialect has been declining after a period of being banned at school by the French government after the [[First World War]] and the [[Second World War]].  It is being replaced by [[French language|French]].&lt;ref&gt;Veltman &amp; Denis (1989) ''Le declin du dialecte alsacien''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====French Flanders====
[[File:FlemishinDunkirkdistrict.PNG|thumb|Flemish (green) and French (red/brown) as spoken in the [[arrondissement of Dunkirk]] in 1874 and 1972.]]
[[French Flanders]], which gradually became part of France between 1659 and 1678, was historically part of the [[Dutch language|Dutch sprachraum]], the native dialect being [[West Flemish]] ([[French Flemish]]). This is corroborated by the Dutch origin of several town names in the region, such as that of 'Dunkerque' ([[Dunkirk]]) which is a French phonetic rendition of the original Dutch name 'Duinkerke' (meaning 'church in the dunes'). The linguistic situation did not change dramatically until the [[French Revolution]] in 1789, and Dutch continued to fulfill the main functions of a cultural language throughout the 18th century.&lt;ref name="hugo"/&gt; During the 19th century, especially in the second half of it, Dutch was banned from all levels of education and lost most of its functions as a cultural language. The larger cities had become predominantly French-speaking by the end of the 19th century.

However, in the countryside, many elementary schools continued to teach in Dutch until [[World War I]], and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] continued to preach and teach the [[catechism]] in Flemish in many parishes.&lt;ref name="hugo"/&gt; Nonetheless, since French enjoyed a much higher status than Dutch, from about the interbellum onward, everybody became bilingual, the generation born after World War II being raised exclusively in French. In the countryside, the passing on of Flemish stopped during the 1930s or 1940s. Consequently, the vast majority of those still having an active command of Flemish are older than 60.&lt;ref name="hugo"/&gt; Therefore, complete extinction of [[French Flemish]] can be expected in the coming decades.&lt;ref name="hugo"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.multilingual-matters.net/jmmd/023/0022/jmmd0230022.pdf |title=Dutch/Flemish in the north of France }}, by Hugo Ryckeboer. University of Ghent.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Basque Country====
[[File:Euskara iparraldean.ogv|thumb|Testimonies of Basque language usage in the French Basque Country]]
The [[French Basque Country]] has been subject to intense French-language pressure exerted over the Basque-speaking communities. Basque was both persecuted and excluded from administration and official public use during the takeover of the [[National Convention]] (1792-1795), [[War of the Pyrenees]] and the Napoleonic period. The compulsory national education system imposed early on a French-only approach (mid-19th century), marginalizing Basque, and by the 1960s family transmission was grinding to a halt in many areas at the feet of the Pyrenees.

By the 2010s, the receding trend has been somewhat mitigated by the establishment of Basque schooling (the ''[[ikastola]]k'') spearheaded by the network [[Seaska]], as well as the influence of the [[Southern Basque Country|Basque territories from Spain]].

====Brittany====
{{see also|Linguistic boundary of Brittany}}
[[File:Dialectes Breton.png|thumb|The shifting of the linguistic boundary in Brittany, from Breton to French, 900-1950]]

According to [[Fañch Broudic]], [[Breton language|Breton]] has lost 80% of its speakers in 60 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Raynaudon-Kerzerho|first1=Maiwenn|title=Fañch Broudic : "Le breton a perdu 80 % de locuteurs en 60 ans."|url=http://bretons-mag.com/blog/102-fanch-broudic-le-breton-a-perdu-80-de-locuteurs-en-60-ans|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources mention that 70% of Breton speakers are over 60. Furthermore, 60% of children received Breton from their parents in the 20s and only 6% in the 80s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hutchinson|first1=Wesley|last2=Ní Ríordáin|first2=Clíona|title=Language issues: Ireland, France and Spain|date=2010|publisher=Peter Lang|page=176|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-SXXZwhc5OcC|isbn=9789052016498}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1980s, monolingual speakers are no longer attested.

On the 27 October 2015, the [[Senate (France)|Senate]] rejected the draft law on ratification of the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] driving away the assumption of Congress for the adoption of the constitutional reform which would have given the value and legitimacy to regional languages such as Breton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Le Sénat dit non à la Charte européenne des langues régionales|url=http://www.franceinfo.fr/actu/politique/article/le-senat-rejette-le-projet-de-loi-de-ratification-de-la-charte-europeenne-des-langues-regionales-741405|accessdate=1 November 2015|agency=franceinfo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Corsica====
[[Corsican language|Corsican]] was long the [[Vernacular|vernacular language]] alongside [[Italian language|Italian]], the official language in Corsica until 1859; afterwards Italian was replaced by [[French language|French]], owing to the acquisition of the island by France from [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] in 1768. Over the next two centuries, the use of French grew to the extent that, by the [[Liberation of France|Liberation]] in 1945, all islanders had a working knowledge of French. The 20th century saw a wholesale language shift, with islanders changing their language practices to the extent that there were no monolingual Corsican speakers left by the 1960s. By 1995, an estimated 65 percent of islanders had some degree of proficiency in Corsican,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/en/atlasmap/language-id-340.html | title=UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in danger}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a small minority, perhaps 10 percent, used Corsican as a first language.&lt;ref name=cif&gt;{{cite web|title=Corsican in France|url=http://www.uoc.edu/euromosaic/web/homean/index1.html|publisher=Euromosaic|accessdate=2008-06-13}} To access the data, click on List by languages, Corsican, Corsican in France, then scroll to ''Geographical and language background''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
====Southern Schleswig====
[[File:LinguisticSituationSchleswigSlesvig.png|thumb|right|Language shift in the 19th century in Southern Schleswig]]
[[File:Nordfrisiske-Dialekter.png|thumb|right|North Frisian dialects]]
In [[Southern Schleswig]], an area that belonged to Denmark until the [[Second Schleswig War]] 1864, there was from the 17th and up to the 20th centuries a language shift from [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[North Frisian language|North Frisian]] dialects to Low German and later High German. Historically, most of the region was part of the Danish and North Frisian Language area, adjacent in the South to the German-speaking Holstein. But with the reformation in the 16th century German became church language and in the 19th century also school language in the southern parts of Schleswig. Added to this came the influence of German-speaking Holsatian nobility and merchants. German was (occasionally) also spoken at the royal court in Copenhagen. This political and economic development led gradually to a German language dominating in the southern parts of Schleswig. Native dialects such as the Angel Danish or Eiderstedt Frisian vanished. In the Flensburg area, there arose the mixed language Petuh combining Danish and German elements. So late as in 1851 (in the period of nationalization) the Danish government tried to stop the Language shift, but without success in the long run. After the Second Schleswig War the Prussians introduced a number of language policy measures in the other way to expand the use of (High) German as the language of administration, schooling and church service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bock|first1=Karl N.|title=Mittelniederdeutsch und heutiges Plattdeutsch im ehemaligen Dänischen Herzogtum Schleswig.

Today, Danish and North Frisian are recognized as minority languages in the federal state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]].

===Hong Kong===
{{main|Languages of Hong Kong}}
In Hong Kong, [[Cantonese]] became the dominant language spoken in society since widespread immigration to Hong Kong began from the 1940s onward. With immigrants of differing [[mother tongue]]s, communication was hard without a dominant language. With Cantonese originating from the capital of neighboring [[Guangzhou|Canton]] province, [[Cantonese]] became the dominant language by extension, and other similar dialects started to vanish from use in [[Hong Kong]]. Original residents, or aboriginals, of Hong Kong used their own languages including the [[Tanka people|Tanka]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] and [[Waitau dialect]], but with a majority of Hong Kong's population being immigrants by the 1940s and 50s, the dialects vanished at a rapid rate. Most of Hong Kong's younger generation does not understand, let alone speak, their ancestral dialects.

Beginning in the late 1990s, since Hong Kong's return to Chinese sovereignty, [[Mandarin Chinese]] has been more widely implemented in education and many other areas of official society. Though adoption of [[Mandarin Chinese]] into society has been rapidly implemented, most Hong Kong residents would not regard it as a first language/dialect. Most Hong Kong residents prefer to communicate in [[Cantonese]] in everyday life.

It is natural that [[Mandarin Chinese]] speakers and [[Cantonese]] speakers could not mutually understand each other without learning the languages, due to vast difference in pronunciation, intonation, sentence structure and terminology. Furthermore, cultural difference between Hong Kong and China brings upon the variations between the Cantonese used in Hong Kong and that in Canton Province.

===Hungary===
[[Cumans]] seeking refuge from the Turko-Mongols settled in Hungary and were later [[Magyarization|Magyarized]]. The [[Jassic people|Jassic]] people of Hungary originally spoke the Jassic dialect of [[Ossetic]], but have completely adopted the [[Hungarian language]], forgetting their previous Ossetian language. The territory of today's Hungary was also previously settled by [[Slavic people|Slavic]] tribes, which became gradually assimilated to the Hungarian language. Also, language shift may have happened during Hungarian pre-history, as the prehistoric culture of Magyars shows very little similarity to the other [[Uralic peoples]].

===Ireland===
{{Main|History of the Irish language#Nineteenth and twentieth centuries}}

===Italy===
{{see also| Italianization}}
The [[Italian peninsula]] and the [[Po river]] basin have been a [[Languages of Italy|conglomerate of different languages]], Latin-derived for the most part. Italy was politically divided up to the late 19th century. Since the Renaissance, a standard for formal, literary and written purposes was developed based on the [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan variety]]. It developed as the language of unified Italy, providing the basis for the [[Italian language]] and sidelining other languages of Italy in education and formal settings. These vernaculars have been incorrectly labelled as 'dialects'. Italian expanded as a common linguistic form for everyday use after World War II.

====Germanic languages====
{{see also|Italianization of South Tyrol}}

[[Cimbrian language|Cimbrian]], a [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]] related to [[Bavarian language|Bavarian]], was spoken by at least 20,000 people in the 19th Century, with 3,762 people in 1921 and fewer than 300 in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coluzzi|first1=Paolo|title=Minority Language Planning and Micronationalism in Italy|date=2007|publisher=Peter Lang|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same scenario goes for [[Mòcheno language|Mòcheno]].

====Sardinia====
Italian was made official on the island for the first time in 1760 by decision of the [[House of Savoy|Savoyard]] government,&lt;ref&gt;''The phonology of Campidanian Sardinian : a unitary account of a self-organizing structure'', Roberto Bolognesi, The Hague : Holland Academic Graphics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'' S'italianu in Sardìnnia '', Amos Cardia, Iskra&lt;/ref&gt; definitively replacing both Spanish and Sardinian. 
Under [[Fascism]] non-Italian languages were banned, and surnames were changed to sound more Italian.&lt;ref&gt;''Lussu'' became ''Lusso'', and ''Pilu'' changed to ''Pilo''; a large number of Sardinian surnames were affected by this policy.&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis on monolingual (Italian-only) policies and assimilation has continued after [[World War II]], with historical sites and ordinary objects renamed in Italian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enricolobina.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Comuna-univ-SE_ENG.pdf Sardinia and the right to self-determination of peoples, Document to be presented to the European left University of Berlin – Enrico Lobina]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ministry of Public Education (Italy)|Ministry of Public Education]] reportedly requested the monitoring of Sardinian teachers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manifestosardo.org/lingua-sarda-dallinterramento-alla-resurrezione/ Lingua sarda: dall’interramento alla resurrezione?]&lt;/ref&gt; The language has been stigmatized as indicative of a lack of education,&lt;ref name="Tonzanu"&gt;[http://www.midesa.it/cgi-bin/show?art=Tonzanu.htm Giovanna Tonzanu, ''Sa limba sarda'' (article written in Italian)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.francopiga.it/francopiga/index.php/la-lingua-sarda-oggi-bilinguismo.html La lingua sarda oggi: bilinguismo, problemi di identità culturale e realtà scolastica, Maurizio Virdis (Università di Cagliari)]&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result it is associated still by many locals with shame, backwardness and provincialism.

Despite campaigns to give Sardinian equal status with Italian as a means to promote cultural identity, a number of factors like immigration from mainland Italy, the interior [[Urbanization|rural exodus]] to urban areas&lt;ref&gt;Compare Irish [[Gaeltacht]] (Edwards 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; and the use of Italian as a prerequisite for jobs and social advancement actually hinder any policy set up to promote the language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-stuttgart.de/lingrom/marzo/EscursioneSitoItaliano/la_standardizzazione_del_sardo.html La standardizzazione del sardo, oppure: quante lingue standard per il sardo?

At present, language use is far from stable:&lt;ref name="Rosita"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_8J7ilk0bAgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Bilingualism+and+Linguistic+Conflict+in+Romance&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Sardinian&amp;f=false Rebecca Posner, John N. Green (Editors), ''Trends in Romance Linguistics and Philology: Bilingualism and Linguistic Conflict in Romance'', pp.271-294]&lt;/ref&gt; reports show that, while an estimated 68 percent of the islanders have a good oral command of Sardinian, language ability among the children drops to around 13 percent;&lt;ref&gt;La Nuova Sardegna, 04/11/10, Per salvare i segni dell'identità – di Paolo Coretti&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sardegna24.net/cultura/ai-docenti-di-sardo-lezioni-in-italiano-1.46195 Ai docenti di sardo lezioni in italiano, Sardegna 24 – Cultura]&lt;/ref&gt; some linguists cite the low number of Sardinian-speaking children as indicative of language decline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luigiladu.it/collaborazioni_siti_web/ctedde_la_situazione_sociolinguistica_della_lingua_sarda_settentrionale_di_mauro_maxia.htm La situazione sociolinguistica della Sardegna settentrionale, Mauro Maxia]&lt;/ref&gt;
Instead, most of the younger generation, although they do understand some Sardinian, is actually [[Monolingualism|monolingual]] and speaks a mixture of Italian and Sardinian (considered [[regional Italian]] by linguists&lt;ref name="Rosita"/&gt;) that is called ''italiànu porcheddìnu'' ("piggy Italian", meaning more or less "broken Italian") by native Sardinian speakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://maxia-mail.doomby.com/medias/files/lingua-e-societa-in-sardegna-estratto-cap-1.pdf ''Lingua e società in Sardegna'' – Mauro Maxia]&lt;/ref&gt; Today, people who speak Sardinian on an everyday basis mainly live in the sparsely populated interior of the island, like the [[Barbagia|Barbagia region]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gfbv.it/3dossier/eu-min/sardi-de.html  Sardinien: Ferienparadies oder stiller Tod eines Volkes? – Von Marco Oggianu (Übersetzung von Mateo Taibon)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Damien Simonis|title=Sardinia|year=2003|publisher=Lonely Planet Publications|isbn=9781740590334|pages=240–241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the present day, the Sardinian-speaking community, despite being the largest minority language group recognised by Italy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal-lem.com/images/fr/sarde/ISTAT_Langues_en_Italie.pdf Inchiesta ISTAT (2000)], pg. 105–107&lt;/ref&gt; is also the least protected one and the language is receding in all domains of use. A solution to the Sardinian question is unlikely to be found any time soon.&lt;ref name="Rosita"/&gt;

====Veneto====
On a survey made by [[Il Gazzettino]], 70% of respondents told they spoke [[Venetian language|Venetian]] very or quite often in the family, while 68% with friends. Much smaller share than there used to at work (35%). Compared to 2001, it is the latter sector where the dialect is more in crisis. In fact, if for use within the family networks and friendship, negative signs stop respectively at -4 and -11 percentage points, in the workplace, the balance drops to -22 percentage points. It has to be noted that young people under the age of 25 and students are in the social sectors where the use of dialect falls below the threshold of absolute majority (respectively 43 and 41%), showing a visible generational separation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Porcellato|first1=Natascia|title=A Nordest il dialetto resiste ma si parla più in famiglia che al lavoro|url=http://www.ilgazzettino.it/NORDEST/PRIMOPIANO/dialetto_veneto_italiano_famiglie_lavoro_osservatorio/notizie/1018496.shtml|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malta===

{{See also|Languages of Malta}}
Before the 1930s, [[Italian language|Italian]] was the only official language of Malta, even though it was spoken by only the upper classes, with [[Maltese language|Maltese]] being spoken by the lower class. However, [[English language|English]] was then added to the mix, and was made a co-official language alongside Maltese, with Italian being dropped as official. The English language has since grown in the country and now threatens the status of Maltese.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The number of speakers of Italian there has increased from when the language was official. A trend among the younger generations is to mix English and Italian vocabulary patterns, in making new Maltese words. For example, the Maltese word for library was originally "bibljoteka", but this has since been displaced by "librerija", formed from the English "library", and an Italian pattern ending. In addition to mixing English with Italian, [[Maltenglish]] is a commonly occurring amalgam of English and Maltese. This involves using English words in Maltese sentences, or adding English vocabulary into Maltese. Trends{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} show that English is not only becoming the language of choice for more and more people{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}, but is actually transforming the Maltese language itself.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Philippines===

{{See also|Kinaray-a}}

In the [[Philippines]], [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]]-speaking families have gradually switched over to [[American English|English]] since the end of [[World War II]] until the former eventually ceased to be a practical everyday language in the country.

Another example would be the gradual death of the [[Kinaray-a]] language of Panay as many native speakers especially in the province of [[Iloilo]] are switching to [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]] or mixing the two languages together. [[Kinaray-a]] was once spoken in the towns outside the vicinity of [[Iloílo City]], while [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]] was limited to only the eastern coasts and the city proper. However, due to media and other factors such as urbanization, many younger speakers have switched from [[Kinaray-a]] to [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]], especially in the towns of [[Cabatuan, Iloilo|Cabatuan]], [[Santa Barbara, Iloilo|Santa Barbara]], [[Calinog]], [[Miagao]], [[Passi City]], [[Guimbal]], [[Tigbauan]], [[Tubungan]], etc. Many towns, especially [[Janiuay]], [[Lambunao]], and [[San Joaquin, Iloilo|San Joaquin]] still have a sizeable [[Kinaray-a]]-speaking population, with the standard accent being similar to that spoken in the predominantly [[Karay-a language|Karay-a]] province of [[Antique (province)|Antique]]. Even in the province of [[Antique (province)|Antique]],  "Hiligaynization" is an issue to be confronted as the province, especially the capital town of [[San José de Buenavista]], undergoes urbanisation. Many investors from [[Iloílo City]] bring with them [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]]-speaking workers who are reluctant to learn the local language.

One of the problems of [[Kinaray-a]] is its written form, as its unique "schwa sound" is difficult to represent in orthography. As time goes by, [[Kinaray-a]] has disappeared in many areas it was once spoken especially in the island of Mindoro and only remnants of the past remain in such towns as [[Pinamalayan]], [[Bansud]], [[Gloria, Oriental Mindoro|Gloria]], [[Bongabong]], [[Roxas, Oriental Mindoro|Roxas]], [[Mansalay]], and [[Bulalacao]] in Oriental Mindoro and [[Sablayan]], [[Calintaan]], [[San Jose, Occidental Mindoro|San Jose]], and [[Magsaysay, Occidental Mindoro|Magsaysay]] in [[Occidental Mindoro]], as [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] has become the standard and dominantly recognised official language of these areas.

===Singapore===
{{Main|Languages of Singapore}}

After Singapore's [[independence]] in 1965, there was a general language shift in the country's interracial [[lingua franca]] from [[Malay language|Malay]] to [[English language|English]], as English was chosen as the first language for the country. Among the [[Chinese Singaporean|Chinese community in Singapore]], there was a language shift from the various dialects of Chinese to English and [[Mandarin Chinese]]. Until the 1980s, [[Singaporean Hokkien]] was the [[lingua franca]] of [[Chinese Singaporean|Chinese community in Singapore]], which has since been replaced with English and Mandarin today. There has been a general [[language attrition]] in the use of Chinese other than Mandarin Chinese, especially amongst the younger segments of the Singaporean population.

===Spain===
{{See also|Languages of Spain|Valencian linguistic conflict}}
The progressive dominion exerted by the [[Kingdom of Castile]] over Spain in as much as it gained political power [[Reconquista|throughout centuries]], contributed to the expansion of [[Spanish language|its language]] at the expenses of the rest. The accession of the Castilian [[House of Trastamara]] to the [[Crown of Aragon]] by mid-15th century saw the gradual displacement of the royal languages of the [[Crown of Aragon]], [[Navarro-Aragonese|Aragonese]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]], despite the prolific Valencian literature in Catalan in this period. Nebrija's ''Gramatica castellana'' (1492), sponsored by the new Spanish monarch [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], was meant to help expand [[Castilian Spanish|Castilian]], "the companion of the Empire". As the Crown of Castile expanded, its different governmental officials at different levels required their subjects to use or understand Castilian and sideline other ''vulgar languages'', or vernaculars. It often meant the use of interpreters in lawsuits, which could tilt the outcome of the case one side or the other, e.g. the [[Basque witch trials]], and the increased use of Castilian in assemblies and decision-making bodies, and documents, despite not being the commonly understood language in a number of areas, like most of the [[Southern Basque Country|Basque districts]] ([[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]], [[Álava]], etc.), Catalonia, Galicia, Asturias, parts of Aragon, etc.
[[File:Mapa de la estensión de la llingua asturiana-lleonesa.png|thumb|Percentage of competence in [[Astur-Leonese languages|Asturian-Leonese language]]]]
As Aragonese retreated to the sub-Pyrenean valleys, [[Andalusian Arabic|Arabic]] vanished by the early 17th century, when forced cultural assimilation of the [[Moriscos]] was coupled with expulsion (completed in 1614). The arrival of the Bourbons (1700) intensified the centralization of governmental structures and the imposition of Castilian as the only language for official purposes, replacing in 1716 Catalan as the language of Justice Administration in the relevant territories ([[Nueva Planta Decrees]]). Unlike [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Basque language|Basque]] was never a language written on official documents, but was equally affected. It lost ground to Castilian in all its buffer geographic areas, as well as main institutions as a communication language, after a number of decrees and orders established Castilian as "the national language of the Empire" during [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]]'s reign; printing in languages other than Spanish was forbidden (1766), and Castilian was the only language taught in school (1768).

The [[Peninsular War]] was followed by the centralization of Spain (Constitutions of 1812, 1837, 1845, 1856, etc.), with only the Basque districts keeping a [[End of Basque home rule in Spain|separate status until 1876]]. Compulsory education in 1856 made the use of Castilian (Spanish) mandatory, as well as discouraging and forbidding the use of other languages on a number social and institutional settings. [[Francoist Spain|Franco and his nationalist dictatorship]] imposed Spanish as the only valid language for any formal social interaction (1937). By the early 21st century, Spanish was the overwhelmingly dominant language in Spain, with Basque, Catalan, and [[Galician language|Galician]] surviving and developing in their respective regions with different levels of recognition since 1980. Other minorized languages ([[Asturian language|Asturian]], Aragonese) have also seen some recognition in the early 21st century. Catalan, sharing with Basque a strong link between language and identity, enjoys a fairly sound status. Basque competence levels have picked up during the last decades, but everyday use does not go up accordingly. Asturian has been classified by the Endangered Languages Project as being at risk, and Aragonese as an endangered language.

===Taiwan===
[[File:Map of the most commonly used home language in Taiwan.svg|The most commonly used home language in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu, 2010. Taiwanese Mandarin are marked with blue.|300px|thumb]]
[[Taiwanese aborigines]] used only [[Austronesian languages]] before other ethnic groups conquered Taiwan. After widespread migration of [[Han people]]s from the 17th to the 19th century, many [[Taiwanese Plains Aborigines]] became Sinicized, and shifted their language use to other [[Sinitic language|Sinitic]] tongues, (mainly [[Taiwanese Hokkien]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=台灣地區的語言分佈|page=6|author=[[Ang Ui-jin]]|url=http://www.ling.sinica.edu.tw/files/publication/j2013_2_05_2724.pdf|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, some Hakka people (especially in [[Yongjing, Changhua]], [[Xiluo, Yunlin]], etc.) also shifted from [[Hakka Chinese]] to Hokkien (also called Hoklo). They are called ''Hoklo-Hakka'' ([[Pha̍k-fa-sṳ]]: ''Ho̍k-ló-hak'', [[Pe̍h-oē-jī]]: ''Ho̍k-ló-kheh'', Hanzi: ''[[:zh:福佬客|福佬客]]'').&lt;ref name="ang2"&gt;{{citation|section=台灣的語言戰爭及戰略分析|pages=119–158|title=《 第一屆台灣本土文化學術研討會論文集》|volume=1|author=Ang Ui-jin|year=1994}}{{cmn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=涂文欽|year=2010|title=粵籍移民在彰化縣的分佈及其語言特色|publisher=國立臺中教育大學}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|section=采田福地之田野調查|author=廖君晏|title=史地學術暨錢穆思想研討會《會議手冊暨論文集》|pages=1–26|publisher=臺北市立教育大學}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Taiwan was [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|under Japanese rule]], Japanese became the official language, with the Japanese government promoting Japanese language education. It also led to the creation of [[Yilan Creole Japanese]], a mixture of Japanese, [[Atayal language]], and Hokkien &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=真田信治, 簡月真|title=台湾における日本語クレオールについて|journal=日本語の研究 4.2 |year=2008|pages=69–76}}{{ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Yilan County, Taiwan|Yilan County]]. In [[World War II]], under the [[Japanification|Japanification Movement]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]] was banned in newspapers and school lectures, and the usage of Japanese at home was encouraged, so many urban people turned to using Japanese. In 1941, 57% of Taiwanese could speak Japanese.&lt;ref name="ang2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ang1"&gt;{{cite web|title=台灣的語言政策何去何從|url=http://mail.tku.edu.tw/cfshih/ln/paper18.htm|author=Ang Ui-jin}}{{cmn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=王順隆|title=日治時期台灣漢文教育的時代意義|journal=文学部紀要|volume=12.2|year=1999|pages=47–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[ROC government]] established rule over Taiwan in 1945, it prohibited the usage of [[Japanese language|Japanese]] in newspapers and schools,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=蔡盛琦. |title=戰後初期學國語熱潮與國語讀本.|journal=國家圖書館館刊 |volume=100 年 2 月|year=2011|pages=60–98}}{{cmn}}&lt;/ref&gt; and promoted the [[Standard Chinese|Guoyu]] movement (Chinese: ''國語運動'') to popularise Standard Mandarin, often through coercive means.&lt;ref name="ntlm"&gt;{{citation|url=http://nmtldig.nmtl.gov.tw/taigi/02sp/04_list.html|title=台灣語言政策大事紀(1895~2007)|publisher=國立台灣文學館 ([[National Museum of Taiwan Literature]])}}{{zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary education system, people using local languages would be fined or forced to put on a [[dialect card]]. In the mass media, local languages were also discouraged or prohibited, and some books on the romanization of local languages (e.g. Bibles, lyrics books, Pe̍h-oē-jī) were banned. In 1975, The Radio and Television Act (Chinese: ''廣播電視法'') was adopted, restricting the usage of local languages on the radio or TV.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:zh:廣播電視法 (民國64年立法65年公布)]], 1975&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, after the draft of the Language and Script Law (Chinese: ''語文法'') was released by the Ministry of Education, it received considerable opposition because it banned the use of Taiwanese unofficial languages in the public domain.&lt;ref name="ntlm"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=「語文法與人權」座談會|url=http://catalog.digitalarchives.tw/item/00/5e/24/27.html|publisher=台灣人權促進會}}{{cmn}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, some Hakka groups demonstrated to save their language.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=宋學文, 黎寶文|title=台灣客家運動之政策分析|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1987 when martial law was lifted, the Guoyu movement ceased.&lt;ref name="ang2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ang1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ntlm"/&gt;

The shift towards monolingual Mandarin was more pronounced amongst Hakka-speaking communities, attributed to Hakka's low social prestige. Prior to the KMT's takeover of the island from the Japanese empire, the Hakka were expected to learn both Hokkien and Japanese. However, the lack of a significant Japanese-speaking base for gaining and then retaining Japanese fluency meant that most Hakka learned only Hokkien. When the KMT fled to Taiwan from mainland China, most mainlanders settled mainly in northern Taiwan, close to Hakka-speaking areas, thus spurring a linguistic shift from Hokkien to Mandarin within the Taipei area. As the bulk of economic activity centered around patronage networks revolving around Mandarin-speaking KMT membership, most of the Hakka became Mandarin monolinguals, due to a shift in social mobility previously centered around Hokkien. Elsewhere, although the percentage of the Hokkien-speaking population declined in relation to its proportion of the population, most Hokkien-speaking households have retained fluency in Hokkien, helped by the liberalization of Taiwanese politics and the end of martial law.{{Specify|date=April 2016}}

Nevertheless, [[Taiwanese Mandarin]] has become the most common language in Taiwan today, and the most common home language of Taiwanese youth.&lt;ref name="DGBAS"&gt;{{citation|title=2010 Population and Housing Census|publisher=Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, Executive Yuan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the population census of 2010, Mandarin is the most common home language in the [[Taipei metropolitan area]], [[Taoyuan City|Taoyuan]], [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]], [[Indigenous Area (Taiwan)|aboriginal areas]], some Hakka-majority areas, as well as some urban areas of [[Taichung]] and [[Kaohsiung]].&lt;ref name="DGBAS"/&gt; Conversely, the ability of Taiwanese to speak ethnic languages is strikingly on the decline.&lt;ref name="ang2"/&gt;

====Scottish Gaelic====
{{Main|Scottish Gaelic#Status}}
Gaelic has long suffered from its lack of use in educational and administrative contexts and was long suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;See Kenneth MacKinnon (1991) ''Gaelic: A Past and Future Prospect''. Edinburgh: The Saltire Society.&lt;/ref&gt; The shift from Gaelic to [[Scots language|Scots]] and [[Scottish English]] has been ongoing since about 1200 CE; Gaelic has gone from being the dominant language in almost all areas of modern-day Scotland to an [[endangered language]] spoken by only about 1% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Peter Berresford. 1985. The Celtic Revolution: A Study in Anti-imperialism. Talybont: Y Lolfa.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of [[history of Scottish devolution|devolution]], however, Scottish Gaelic has begun to receive greater attention, and it has achieved a degree of official recognition when the [[Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005|Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act]] was enacted by the [[Scottish Parliament]] on 21 April 2005. [[Gaelic medium education in Scotland]] now enrolls over 2000 pupils a year. Nevertheless, the number of [[native speakers]] continues to decline and it is a [[minority language]] in most of the traditional [[Gàidhealtachd]], including all census areas outside of the [[Outer Hebrides]].

===United States===
{{Main|Languages of the United States}}
Although [[English language|English]] has been the majority language in the United States since independence in 1776, other languages were spoken first in large areas of the country. In addition to hundreds of aboriginal languages, [[French language in the United States|French]] was once the primary language in Louisiana, Missouri, and areas along the border with [[Quebec]], but the speaking has diminished due to new waves of migration and the rise of English as a [[lingua franca]]. [[Californio]] Spanish rapidly became a minority language during the mass immigration that took place during the [[California Gold Rush]], and has largely been supplanted by [[English language|English]] and [[Mexican Spanish]], surviving mainly as a [[prestige dialect]] in Northern and Central California. [[German language in the United States|German]] was once the primary language in large areas of the [[Great Plains]], but was suppressed due to [[anti-German sentiment]] during the [[First World War]].

===Vietnam===
Since the [[fall of Saigon]] at the end of the [[Vietnam War]] in 1975, [[Vietnamese French (dialect)|French]] has declined heavily in Vietnam from being a government language and primary language of education in [[South Vietnam]]{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} to being a minority language limited to the elite classes and elderly population. Today, French is spoken fluently by only slightly over 5% of the Vietnamese population. The language shift from French to [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] occurred earlier in the north due to [[Viet Minh]] and later communist policies enforcing Vietnamese as the sole language for political and educational purposes.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} However, since the late 1990s, there has been a minor revival of French in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.japanandtheworld.net/2015/11/the-survival-of-french-language-in-vietnam/|title=The Survival of French Language in Vietnam|date=2015-11-01|newspaper=JAPAN and the WORLD|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reversing==
{{See also|Language revitalization}}
American linguist [[Joshua Fishman]] has proposed a method of [[reversing language shift]] which involves assessing the degree to which a particular language is disrupted in order to determine the most effective way of assisting and revitalising the language.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10394">In philosophical discourse, '''lexis''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]]: λέξις "word") is a complete group of words in a language, vocabulary, the total set of all words in a language, and all words that have meaning or a function in grammar.

== Lexis according to Plato ==

According to [[Plato]], lexis is the manner of speaking. Plato said that lexis can be divided into [[mimesis]] (imitation properly speaking) and [[diegesis]] (simple narrative). Gerard Genette states: "Plato's theoretical division, opposing the two pure and heterogeneous modes of narrative and imitation, within poetic diction, elicits and establishes a practical classification of genres, which includes the two distinct modes...and a mixed mode, for example the Iliad".&lt;ref&gt;"Boundaries of a Narrative," ''New Literary History'', Vol. 8, No. 1, Readers and Spectators: Some Views and Reviews (Autumn, 1976), pp. 1–13. JSTOR. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the ''[[Iliad]]'', a Greek epic written by Homer, the mixed mode is very prevalent. According to [[Gerald Prince]], diegesis in the ''Iliad'' is the fictional storytelling associated with the fictional world and the enacting/re-telling of the story. Mimesis in the'' Iliad'' is the imitation of everyday, yet fantastical life in the ancient Greek world. Diegesis and mimesis combined represent the fullest extent of lexis; both forms of speech, narrating and re-enacting.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Prince. ''A Dictionary of Narratolog''y. 2003. University of Nebraska Press&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In conclusion, lexis is the larger overview of literature. Within lexis the two areas of differentiation of mimesis (imitation) are diegesis (narrative) and the "direct representation of the actors speaking to the public."&lt;ref&gt;Gennette 2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lexis according to Aristotle ==

According to Jose M. Gonzalez, "Aristotle instructs us to view of his psychology, as mediating the rhetorical task and entrusted with turning the orator's subject matter into such opinion of the listeners and gain their pistis."&lt;ref&gt;Jose M. Gonzalez, "Phantasia and Aristotle." JSTOR&lt;/ref&gt; Pistis is the Greek word for faith and is one of the rhetorical modes of persuasion.
 
Gonzalez also points out that, "By invoking phantasia, lexis against the background Aristotle instructs us to view of his psychology, as mediating the rhetorical task and entrusted with turning the orator's subject matter into such opinion of the listeners and gain their pistis." [[Phantasia (philosophy)|Phantasia]] is a Greek word meaning the process by which all images are presented to us. Aristotle defines phantasia as "our desire for the mind to mediate anything not actually present to the senses with a mental image." &lt;ref&gt;Jana Noel. "Interpreting Aristotle's Phantasia and Claiming its Role Within Phronesis". 1997.[http://www.ed.uiuc.edu/eps/PES-Yearbook/97_docs/noel.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle instructs the reader to use his or her imagination to create the fantastic, unordinary images, all the while using narrative and re-enactment to create a play either written or produced.

== Elements of rhetorical diction according to Aristotle ==

Although Aristotle at times seems to demean the art of diction or 'voice,' saying that it is not an "elevated subject of inquiry," he does go into quite a bit of detail on its importance and its proper use in rhetorical speech.  Often calling it "style," he defines good style as follows: that it must be clear and avoid extremes of baseness and loftiness.  Aristotle makes the cases for the importance of diction by saying that, "it is not enough to know what we ought to say; we must also say it as we ought.".&lt;ref&gt;''The Rhetoric and the Poetics of Aristotle''. Trans. W. Rhys Roberts. Ed.  [[Donald McQuade|Donald, McQuade]]. New York: The Modern Library, 1984, p. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt; In an oratorical speech, one must consider not only the facts, but also how to put the facts into words and which words and, also, the "proper method of delivery." &lt;ref&gt;[[Donald McQuade|McQuade]] 1984, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle goes on to say that only the facts in an argument should be important but that since the listeners can be swayed by diction, it must also be considered. 
 
'''Voice''' 

At the time when Aristotle wrote his treatise on Rhetoric, orators had not paid much attention to voice.  They thought it was a subject only of concern to actors and poets. In ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|The Rhetoric]]'', Aristotles says, "proper method of delivery…affects the success of a speech greatly; but hitherto the subject has been neglected." &lt;ref&gt;[[Donald McQuade|McQuade]] 1984, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle defined voice as controlling one's voice, using rate, volume and pitch, to convey the appropriate emotions.  The manner of voice in which an idea or speech is conveyed affects not only the emotions of the audience but, also, their ability to understand this concept.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald McQuade|McQuade]] 1984, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Although Aristotle gives this mention and explanation of voice, he does not go into specifics about how to produce appropriate voice or how to convey specific tones with one's voice.  This may or may not be due to his mild disdain for the topic as a whole. Modern scholars have explored voice more extensively. According to Taylor Stoehr, "voice is the pervasive reflection in written or spoken language, of an author's character, the marks by which we recognize his utterance as his.".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor Stoehr. "Tone and Voice."  ''College English'' Nov. 1968:  JSTOR. Pius XII Library, St. Louis, MO.  28 April 2008. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/374450]. p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;  However, just as in Aristotle's time set of specific rules or guidelines has yet been laid out for the production or interpretation of voice.  Due to the vast array of elements involved in the production of voice this task would be nearly, if not entirely, impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Stoehr 150&lt;/ref&gt;       

'''Language'''

As mentioned before, Aristotle thought the language of a speech should avoid being too lofty or too crude.  The speaker must use the ordinary language of everyday life.  However, because people best remember what is out of the ordinary, the speaker must use some language that gives the speech an air of importance.

The elevation of the language must correlate to the elevation of the subject or, in poetry, the character that is speaking.  In poetry, language and linguistic devices that convey a sense of importance are more appropriate, and should be used more often because the events of poetry are more removed from ordinary life.  They are less appropriate in rhetorical speech because the topics relate more directly to ordinary things and the people who are listening to the speech.  Most of all, the speaker must "give the impression of speaking naturally and not artificially." &lt;ref&gt;[[Donald McQuade|McQuade]] 1984, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; When one seems to speak with ease, the audience is more easily persuaded that the facts he is communicating are truthful. 

Also, a speaker must avoid using very many "strange words, compound words, and invented words.".&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald McQuade|McQuade]] 1984, pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle considered this kind of language an excessive departure from the way people normally speak.  However, one acceptable departure from plain language is the use of [[metaphor]] because metaphors are used by all people in everyday conversation.

== Two forms of lexis ==

According to Aristotle, lexis, meaning the delivery of words, is the least important area of speech when in comparison to invention, arrangement and style.  However, lexis is still closely looked at and broken down into two forms.  The two types of lexis in rhetoric include: ''lexis graphike'' and ''lexis agonistike'' &lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Sonkowsky, ”An Aspect of Delivery in Ancient Rhetorical Theory.” p. 259 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/view/283710?seq=4&amp;Search=yes&amp;term=agonistike&amp;term=graphike&amp;term=lexis&amp;list=hide&amp;searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dlexis%2Bgraphike%2Band%2Blexis%2Bagonistike%26dc%3DAll%2BDisciplines&amp;item=1&amp;ttl=1&amp;returnArticleService=showArticle&amp;cookieSet=1]&lt;/ref&gt; The separate terms that describe the two forms of lexis, graphike and agonistike, have been conformed by several Latin terms.  Although the words directly relate to the type of lexis, the theories of Aristotle and Plato do not compare.

''Lexis graphike'' comes from the term ''zographia'', meaning realistic painting, and graphe, meaning writing. Plato believes that writing and painting are one of the same.   His theory proves that both do not have the capability to defend themselves through an argument, question and answer, which conveys that these forms can not prove truth. Although for Aristotle, ''lexis graphik''e is the most accurate delivery of language, which leads to his theory that proves that writing does not need to be questioned because it is already exact.&lt;ref&gt;Sonkowsky, 264&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Lexis agonistike'' however is from the term ''skiagraphia'', meaning a rough sketch or outline of painting.  Aristotle once again opposes Plato by believing that ''lexis agonistike'' does not need questions asked, but only answers.  The answer refers to the use of invention given to the actor because the writing portion is only outlined.&lt;ref&gt;Sonkowsky, 265&lt;/ref&gt;

To further understand the separate types of lexis, each type can be broken down by how the writing is prepared and delivered.  ''Lexis graphike'' is the most precise style of rhetoric and strongly appeals to intelligence.  The delivery of ''lexis graphike'' is designed for a careful reading from either the book or paper as opposed to a performance that leaves room for improvisation.&lt;ref&gt;Sonkowsky, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; This type of lexis is a simple, straight forward recitation rather than an elaborate presentation.  ''Lexis graphike'' is most accurately written and depends the least upon the person who is delivering the speech.  ''Lexis agonistike'' contradicts ''lexis graphike'' because it is typically carelessly written and meant for a full performance.  The lack of attention given to the written words allows the performer to improvise. This gives the presentation a style that reflects the entertainer rather the writer.&lt;ref&gt;Sonkowsky, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Metropolitan police''' are [[municipal police]] of major [[metropolitan area]]s. These forces provide all general police services and tend to be headed by a chief called a [[Commissioner]] or [[Sheriff]].

In the [[United States]], metropolitan police agencies have often been formed through mergers between several local police agencies formerly holding jurisdiction within neighboring communities within a metropolitan area or county, such as several local police departments and possibly the [[county sheriff]]'s office.  


Typically, such communities have experienced recent population growth and [[urban sprawl]], which causes the area to more closely resemble and function as one single [[conurbation]].  Under these circumstances, a single law enforcement agency with a unified command, jurisdiction and support structure comes to be seen as more appropriate and efficient.  

A related concept exists in some American counties in which county sheriffs' offices contract with some (though not necessarily all) local cities or towns within their counties to provide all law enforcement services in those municipalities in lieu of a separate city or town police force.

==Metropolitan police agencies==
Examples of use of the term "Metropolitan Police" include:

'''Non-formal learning''' includes various structured [[learning]] situations which do not either have the level of [[curriculum]], [[syllabus]], [[Educational accreditation|accreditation]] and [[certification]] associated with '[[formal learning]]', but have more structure than that associated with '[[informal learning]]', which typically take place naturally and spontaneously as part of other activities. These form the three styles of learning recognised and supported by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/education/skills-beyond-school/recognitionofnon-formalandinformallearning-home.htm|title=Recognition of Non-formal and Informal Learning - Home|publisher=OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of non-formal learning include swimming sessions for toddlers, community-based sports programs, and programs developed by organisations such as the [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]], the [[Girl Guides]], community or non-credit [[adult education]] courses, sports or fitness programs, professional conference style [[seminar]]s, and continuing professional development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=Eaton, Sarah Elaine|title=Formal, Non-Formal and Informal Learning|url=http://www.infed.org/archives/e-texts/eaton_formal_nonformal_informal_learning.htm |date =22 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The learner’s objectives may be to increase skills and knowledge, as well as to experience the emotional rewards associated with increased love for a subject or increased passion for learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quality guide to non-formal and informal learning processes|url=http://www.menon.org/publications/TQM%20Guide%20for%20informal%20learning.pdf|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wT2umMVj|date =2004|archive-date=13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The debate over the relative value of formal and informal learning has existed for a number of years. Traditionally formal learning takes place in a [[school]] or [[university]] and has a greater value placed upon it than informal learning, such as learning within the workplace. This concept of formal learning being the socio-cultural accepted norm for learning was first challenged by Scribner and Cole&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=Scribner, S. and Cole, M.|year=1973|title=Cognitive Consequences of Formal and Informal Education, Science|pages=182, 553–559}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1973, who claimed most things in life are better learnt through informal processes, citing [[language learning]] as an example. Moreover, anthropologists noted that complex learning still takes place within indigenous communities that had no formal educational institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Lave, J. and Wenger, E.|year=1991|title=Situated Learning: Legitimate Peripheral Participation|publisher=Cambridge: Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It’s the acquisition of this knowledge or learning which occurs in everyday life that has not been fully valued or understood. This led to the declaration by the OECD educational ministers of the "[[life-long learning]] for all"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=OCED|title=Lifelong Learning for All|url=http://www.oecdbookshop.org/browse.asp?pid=title-detail&amp;lang=en&amp;ds=&amp;k=5LMQCR2K9XLP|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; strategy in 1996. This includes 23 countries from five continents, who have sought to clarify and validate all forms of learning including formal, non-formal and informal. This has been in conjunction with the [[European Union]] which has also developed policies for life-long learning which focus strongly on the need to identify, assess and certify non-formal and informal learning, particularly in the workplace.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Formal and informal learning==

Although all definitions can be contested (see below) this article shall refer to the [[European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training]] (Cedefop) 2001 communication on 'lifelong learning: formal, non-formal and informal learning' as the guideline for the differing definitions.

'''Formal learning''': learning typically provided by an education or training institution, structured (in terms of learning objectives, learning time or learning support) and leading to certification. Formal learning is intentional from the learner’s perspective. (Cedefop 2001)&lt;ref name="europa1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary of key terms|url=http://www.cedefop.europa.eu/EN/about-cedefop/projects/validation-of-non-formal-and-informal-learning/european-inventory-glossary.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Informal learning''': learning resulting from daily life activities related to work, family or leisure. It is not structured (in terms of learning objectives, learning time or learning support) and typically does not lead to certification. Informal learning may be intentional but in most cases it is not-intentional (or "incidental"/random). (Cedefop 2001)&lt;ref name="europa1"/&gt;

'''Non-formal learning''': see definition above.

==Contested definitions==
If there is no clear distinction between formal and in-formal learning where is the room for non-formal learning. It is a contested issue with numerous definitions given. The following are some the competing theories.

'''''"It is difficult to make a clear distinction between formal and informal learning as there is often a crossover between the two."''''' (McGivney, 1999, p1).&lt;ref&gt;[McGivney, V. (1999) Informal learning in the community: a trigger for change and development (Leicester: NIACE). Cited in ‘Helen Colley, Phil Hodkinson &amp; Janice Malcolm (2002) Non-formal learning: mapping the conceptual terrain. A Consultation Report, Leeds: University of Leeds Lifelong Learning Institute. Also available in the informal education archives: http://www.infed.org/archives/e-texts/colley_informal_learning.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Hodkinson et al. (2003), conclude after a significant literature analysis on the topics of formal, informal, and non-formal learning, that "the terms informal and non-formal appeared interchangeable, each being primarily defined in opposition to the dominant formal education system, and the largely individualist and acquisitional conceptualisations of learning developed in relation to such educational contexts." (Hodkinson et al., 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;314)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hodkinson|first=Phil |author2=Colley, Hellen |author3=Janice Malcolm|title=The Interrelationships Between Informal and Formal Learning|journal=Journal of Workplace Learning|year=2003|volume=15|pages=313–318}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, he states that "It is important not to see informal and formal attributes as somehow separate, waiting to be integrated. This is the dominant view in the literature, and it is mistaken. Thus, the challenge is not to, somehow, combine informal and formal learning, for informal and formal attributes are present and inter-related, whether we will it so or not. The challenge is to recognise and identify them, and understand the implications. For this reason, '''the concept of non-formal learning, at least when seen as a middle state between formal and informal, is redundant'''." (p.&amp;nbsp;314)

''Eraut's&lt;ref&gt;[Eraut, M. (2000) Non-formal learning, implicit learning and tacit knowledge, in F. Coffield (Ed) The Necessity of Informal Learning, Bristol: Policy Press (2000)]&lt;/ref&gt; classification of learning into formal and non-formal'':

This removes informal learning from the equation and states all learning outside of formal learning is non-formal. Eraut equates informal with connotations of dress, language or behaviour that have no relation to learning. Eraut defines formal learning as taking place within a learning framework; within a classroom or learning institution, with a designated teacher or trainer; the award of a qualification or credit; the external specification of outcomes. Any learning that occurs outside of these parameters is non-formal. (Ined 2002)&lt;ref name="infed1"&gt;[Ined:Non-Formal Learning http://www.infed.org/archives/e-texts/colley_informal_learning.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

''The EC (2001) Communication on Lifelong Learning: formal, non-formal and informal learning'':

The EU places non-formal learning in between formal and informal learning (see above). This has learning both in a formal setting with a learning framework and as an organised event but within a qualification. "Non-formal learning: learning that is not provided by an education or training institution and typically does not lead to certification. It is, however, structured (in terms of learning objectives, learning time or learning support). Non-formal learning is intentional from the learner’s perspective." (Cedefop 2001)&lt;ref name="europa1"/&gt;

''Livingstone's&lt;ref&gt;[Livingstone, D.W. (2001) Adults’ Informal Learning: Definitions, Findings, Gaps and Future Research, Toronto: OISE/UT (NALL Working Paper No.21) at http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/depts/sese/csew/nall/res/21adultsifnormallearning.htm,(2001)]&lt;/ref&gt; adults formal and informal education, non-formal and informal learning'':

This focuses on the idea of adult non-formal education. This new mode, ‘informal education’ is when teachers or mentors guide learners without reference to structured learning outcomes. This informal education learning is gaining knowledge without an imposed framework, such as learning new job skills. (Infed, 2002)&lt;ref name="infed1"/&gt;

''Billett&lt;ref&gt;[Billett, S. (2001a) Participation and continuity at work: A critique of current workplace learning discourses, paper given at the conference Context, Power and Perspective: Confronting the Challenges to Improving Attainment in Learning at Work, Sunley Management Centre, University College Northampton, 8 –10 November]&lt;/ref&gt; (2001): there is no such thing as informal learning'':

Billet's definition states there is no such thing as non-formal and informal learning. He states all human activity is learning, and that everything people do involves a process of learning. "all learning takes place within social organisations or communities that have formalised structures." Moreover, he states most learning in life takes place outside of formal education.(Ined 2002)&lt;ref name="infed1"/&gt;

==Validation==

Recently, many [[international organization]]s and [[UNESCO]] Member States have emphasized the importance of learning that takes place outside of formal learning settings. This emphasis has led UNESCO, through its [[UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning|Institute of Lifelong Learning]] (UIL), to adopt international guidelines for the Recognition, Validation and Accreditation of the Outcomes of Non-formal and Informal Learning in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;UIL. 2012. ''Guidelines for the Recognition, Validation and Accreditation of the Outcomes of Non-formal and Informal Learning''. Hamburg, Germany, UIL.&lt;/ref&gt;  The emphasis has also led to an increasing number of policies and programmes in many Member States, and a gradual shift from pilots to large-scale systems such as those in Portugal, France, Australia, Mauritius and South Africa.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002428/242887e.pdf|title=Level-setting and recognition of learning outcomes: The use of level descriptors in the twenty-first century|last=Keevy|first=James|last2=Chakroun|first2=Borhene|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100138-3|location=|pages=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training|Cedefop]] has created European guidelines to provide validation to a broad range of learning experiences, thereby aiding transparency and comparability across its national borders. The broad framework for achieving this certification across both non-formal and informal learning is outlined in the Cedefop European guidelines for validating non-formal and informal learning; Routes from learning to certification.&lt;ref&gt;[European guidelines for validating non-formal and informal learning; Routes from learning to certification. figure 2 p.18. http://www.cedefop.europa.eu/EN/Files/4054_en.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Different countries' approaches==

There are different approaches to validation between OCED and EU countries, with countries adopting different measures. The EU, as noted above, through the Cedefop-released European guidelines for validating non-formal and informal learning in 2009 to standardise validation throughout the EU. Within the OCED countries, the picture is more mixed.

== Flexible schooling or participatory schooling ==

Non-formal education (NFE) is popular on a worldwide scale in both 'western' and 'developing countries'. Non-formal education can form a matrix with formal and non-formal education, as non-formal education can mean any form of systematic learning conducted outside the formal setting. Many courses in relation to non-formal education have been introduced in several universities in western and developing countries.

The UNESCO institute of education conducted a seminar on non-formal [[education in Morocco]]. The association for development of education in Africa (ADEA) launched many programmes in non-formal education in at least 15 countries of Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2001 World Bank conducted an international seminar on basic education in non-formal programmes. In addition to this the World Bank was advised to extend its services to adult and non-formal education.

A report on vocational education, Making Learning Visible: the identification, assessment and recognition of non-formal learning in Europe, defines non-formal learning as semi structured, consisting of planned and explicit approaches to learning introduced into work organisations and elsewhere, not recognised within the formal education and training system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alan Rogers|title=Non-Formal Education: Flexible Schooling or Participatory Education?|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=pQQcOj3Iu1QC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP8&amp;dq=non+formal+education&amp;ots=JpjgCLrr9p&amp;sig=jGiHsF0HZOG3EcyTtcrE5FDewnc#v=onepage&amp;q=non%20formal%20education&amp;f=false|ref=book}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

Community work, which is particularly widespread in Scotland, fosters people's  commitment to their neighbours and encourages participation in and development of local democratic forms of organisation.

Youth work which focuses on making people more active in the society.

Social work which helps young people in homes to develop ways to deal with complex situations like fostering fruitful relationships between parents and children, bringing different groups of career together, etc...

In France and Italy animation in a particular form is a kind of non-formal education. It uses theatre and acting as means of self-expression with different community groups for children and people with special needs. This type of non-formal education helps in ensuring active participation and teaches people to manage the community in which they live.

Youth and community organisations young people have the opportunity  to discover, analyse and understand values and their implications and build a set of values to guide their lives. They run work camps and meetings, recruit volunteers, administer bank acoounts, give counselling etc. to work toward social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mr Cristian Dumitrescu|title=Non formal education|url=http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/X2H-Xref-ViewHTML.asp?FileID=8807&amp;lang=en|work=Report|agency=Committee on Culture and Education|date=15 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Importance ==

Education plays an important role in  development. Out of school programmes are important to provide adaptable learning opportunities and new skills and knowledge to a large percentage of people who are beyond the reach of formal education. Non-formal education began to gain popularity in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Today, non-formal education is seen as a concept of recurrent and lifelong learning.

Non-formal education is popular among the adults specially the women as it increases women's participation in both private and public activities, i.e. in house hold decision making and as active citizens in the community affairs and national development. These literacy programmes have a dramatic impact on women's self-esteem because they unleash their potential in economic, social, cultural and political spheres.

According to UNESCO (2010), non-formal education helps to ensures equal access to education, eradicate illiteracy among women and improve women's access to vocational training, science, technology and continuing education. It also encourages the development of non-discriminatory education and training. The effectiveness of such literacy and non-formal education programmes are bolstered  by family, community and parental involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Department of Educational Foundations and Management|title=A Critical Assessment of the Role/Importance of Non-Formal Education to Human and National Development in Nigeria: Future Trends|url=http://www.ijsre.com/Vol.,%205_2_-Ololube%20&amp;%20Egbezor.pdf|ref=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==

Non-formal education is beneficial in a number of ways. There are activities that encourage young people to choose their own programme and projects that are important because they offer the youth the flexibility and freedom to explore their emerging interests. When the youth can choose the activities in which they can participate, they have opportunities to develop several skills like decision making skills.

Non-formal learning has experiential learning activities that foster the development of skills and knowledge. This helps in building the confidence and abilities among the youth of today. It also helps in development of personal relationships not only among the youth but also among the adults. It helps in developing interpersonal skills among the young people as they learn to interact with peers outside the class and with adults in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stephen T. Russell|title=The Developmental Benefits of Nonformal Education and Youth Development|issue=The University of California, Davis|url=http://www.ca4h.org/files/1231.pdf|ref=journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages ==

There are drawbacks to non-formal education which include that non-formal learning is not based on curriculum but based on experience. There is low efficiency in non-formal education.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

== Necessity ==

Formal education system are inadequate to effectively meet the needs of the individual and the society. The need to offer more and better education at all levels, to a growing number of people, particularly in developing countries, the scant success of current formal education systems to meet all such demands, has shown the need to develop alternatives to learning.

The rigid structure of formal schools, mainly because of rules and regulations than concentrating on the real need of the students, offering curriculum that leans away from the individual and from society, far more concerned with performing programmes than reaching useful objectives. This called for non-formal education which starting from the basic need of the students, is concerned with the establishment of strategies that are compatible with reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Claudio Zaki Dib|title=FORMAL, NON-FORMAL AND INFORMAL EDUCATION: CONCEPTS/APPLICABILITY|url=http://www.techne-dib.com.br/downloads/6.pdf|publisher=stitute of Physics University of São Paulo, Brazil|ref=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oral tradition''', or '''oral lore''', is a form of human [[communication]] wherein knowledge, art, ideas and cultural material is received, preserved and transmitted orally from one generation to another.&lt;ref name = "Vansina"&gt;[[Jan Vansina|Vansina, Jan]]: ''Oral Tradition as History'' (1985), reported statements from present generation which "specifies that the message must be oral statements spoken, sung or called out on musical instruments only"; "There must be transmission by word of mouth over at least a generation". He points out, "Our definition is a working definition for the use of historians. Sociologists, linguists or scholars of the verbal arts propose their own, which in, e.g., sociology, stresses common knowledge.

==History==
According to John Foley, oral tradition has been an ancient human tradition found in "all corners of the world".&lt;ref name="MacKay1999p1"/&gt; Modern archaeology has been unveiling evidence of the human efforts to preserve and transmit arts and knowledge that depended completely or partially on an oral tradition, across various cultures:

{{Quote|
The Judeo-Christian Bible reveals its oral traditional roots; medieval European manuscripts are penned by performing scribes; geometric vases from archaic Greece mirror Homer's oral style. (...) Indeed, if these final decades of the millennium have taught us anything, it must be that oral tradition never was the other we accused it of being; it never was the primitive, preliminary technology of communication we thought it to be. Rather, if the whole truth is told, oral tradition stands out as the single most dominant communicative technology of our species as both a historical fact and, in many areas still, a contemporary reality.

In Asia, the transmission of folklore, mythologies as well as scriptures in ancient India, in different Indian religions, was by oral tradition, preserved with precision with the help of elaborate [[Vedic chant|mnemonic techniques]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Donald S.

==Transmission==
[[File:Helsinki-Folk-singer-statue-1750.JPG|thumb|The legendary Finnish storyteller [[Väinämöinen]] with his [[kantele]]]]
Oral traditions face the challenge of accurate transmission and verifiability of the accurate version, particularly when the culture lacks written language or has limited access to writing tools. Oral cultures have employed various strategies that achieve this without writing. For example, a heavily rhythmic speech filled with [[mnemonic device]]s enhances memory and recall. A few useful mnemonic devices include [[alliteration]], repetition, [[assonance]], and proverbial sayings. In addition, the verse is often metrically composed with an exact number of syllables or [[morae]] - such as with Greek and Latin prosody and in [[Sanskrit prosody|Chandas]] found in Hindu and Buddhist texts.&lt;ref name="TElizarenkova1995p112"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allan2013p228"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Scharf|editor=Keith Allan|title=The Oxford Handbook of the History of Linguistics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BQfDosHckzEC|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-164344-6|pages=228–234}}&lt;/ref&gt; The verses of the epic or text are typically designed wherein the long and short syllables are repeated by certain rules, so that if an error or inadvertent change is made, an internal examination of the verse reveals the problem.&lt;ref name="TElizarenkova1995p112"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tatyana J.

| The law itself in oral cultures is enshrined in formulaic sayings, proverbs, which are not mere jurisprudential decorations, but themselves constitute the law. A judge in an oral culture is often called on to articulate sets of relevant proverbs out of which he can produce equitable decisions in the cases under formal litigation before him.&lt;ref name="Longman Publishers USA"/&gt;
|}

[[Rudyard Kipling]]'s [[The Jungle Book]] provides an excellent demonstration of oral governance in the [[Law of the Jungle]]. Not only does grounding rules in oral proverbs allow for simple transmission and understanding, but it also legitimizes new rulings by allowing extrapolation. These stories, traditions, and proverbs are not static, but are often altered upon each transmission barring the overall meaning remains intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hanson|first1=Erin|title=Oral Traditions|url=http://indigenousfoundations.arts.ubc.ca/home/culture/oral-traditions.html|website=Indigenous Foundations|accessdate=5 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518082618/http://indigenousfoundations.arts.ubc.ca/home/culture/oral-traditions.html|archivedate=18 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the rules that govern the people are modified by the whole and not authored by a single entity.

===Indian religions===
Ancient texts of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] were preserved and transmitted by an oral tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hartmut Scharfe |title=Handbook of Oriental Studies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7s19sZFRxCUC |year=2002|publisher=BRILL Academic |isbn=90-04-12556-6 |pages=24–29, 226–237}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Lopez |title=Buddhist Scriptures |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Pd-2IIzip4C |year=2004|publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-190937-0 |pages=xi–xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[śruti]]s of Hinduism called the [[Veda]]s, the oldest of which trace back to the second millennium BCE. [[Michael Witzel]] explains this oral tradition as follows:&lt;ref name=witzel68/&gt;

{{quote|The Vedic texts were orally composed and transmitted, without the use of script, in an unbroken line of transmission from teacher to student that was formalized early on.  This ensured an impeccable textual transmission superior to the classical texts of other cultures; it is, in fact, something like a ''tape-recording''... Not just the actual words, but even the long-lost musical (tonal) accent (as in old Greek or in Japanese) has been preserved up to the present.|Michael Witzel&lt;ref name=witzel68&gt;M Witzel, "Vedas and Upaniṣads", in Flood, Gavin, ed. (2003), The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism, Blackwell Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|1-4051-3251-5}}, pages 68-71&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ancient Indians developed techniques for listening, memorization and recitation of their knowledge, in schools called [[Guru]]kul, while maintaining exceptional accuracy of their knowledge across the generations.&lt;ref name=scharfe28&gt;{{cite book|author=Hartmut Scharfe |title=Handbook of Oriental Studies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7s19sZFRxCUC |year=2002|publisher=BRILL Academic |isbn=90-04-12556-6 |pages=24–29, 226–232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many forms of recitation or ''paths'' were designed to aid accuracy in recitation and the transmission of the ''[[Veda]]s'' and other knowledge texts from one generation to the next. All hymns in each Veda were recited in this way; for example, all 1,028 hymns with 10,600 verses of the Rigveda was preserved in this way; as were all other Vedas including the [[Principal Upanishads]], as well as the Vedangas. Each text was recited in a number of ways, to ensure that the different methods of recitation acted as a cross check on the other. Pierre-Sylvain Filliozat summarizes this as follows:&lt;ref name=filliozat-p139/&gt;
* ''Samhita-patha'': continuous recitation of Sanskrit words bound by the phonetic rules of euphonic combination;
* ''Pada-patha'': a recitation marked by a conscious pause after every word, and after any special grammatical codes embedded inside the text; this method suppresses euphonic combination and restores each word in its original intended form;
* ''Krama-patha'': a step-by-step recitation where euphonically-combined words are paired successively and sequentially and then recited; for example, a hymn "word1 word2 word3 word4...", would be recited as "word1word2 word2word3 word3word4 ...."; this method to verify accuracy is credited to Vedic sages Gargya and Sakarya in the Hindu tradition and mentioned by the ancient Sanskrit grammarian Panini (dated to pre-Buddhism period);
* ''Krama-patha'' modified: the same step-by-step recitation as above, but without euphonic-combinations (or free form of each word); this method to verify accuracy is credited to Vedic sages Babhravya and Galava in the Hindu tradition, and is also mentioned by the ancient Sanskrit grammarian Panini;
* ''{{IAST|Jata-pāṭha}}'', ''{{IAST|dhvaja-pāṭha}}'' and ''{{IAST|ghana-pāṭha}}'' are methods of recitation of a text and its oral transmission that developed after 5th century BCE, that is after the start of Buddhism and Jainism; these methods use more complicated rules of combination and were less used.

These extraordinary retention techniques guaranteed an accurate Śruti, fixed across the generations, not just in terms of unaltered word order but also in terms of sound.&lt;ref name=scharfe28/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilke, Annette and Moebus, Oliver.

===Chronology===
[[File:Filip Visnjic guslar.jpg|thumb|right|[[Filip Višnjić]] (1767&amp;ndash;1834), [[Serbia]]n blind [[gusle|guslar]]]]
The following overview draws upon ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography'', (NY: Garland Publishing, 1985, 1986, 1989); additional material is summarized from the overlapping prefaces to the following volumes: ''The Theory of Oral Composition: History and Methodology'', (Indiana University Press, 1988, 1992); ''Immanent Art: From Structure to Meaning in Traditional Oral Epic'' (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1991); ''The Singer of Tales in Performance'' (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1995) and ''Comparative Research on Oral Traditions: A Memorial for Milman Parry'' (Columbus, Ohio: Slavica Publishers, 1987). in the work of the Serb scholar [[Vuk Stefanović Karadžić]] (1787–1864), a contemporary and friend of the [[Brothers Grimm]]. Vuk pursued similar projects of "salvage folklore" (similar to [[rescue archaeology]]) in the [[cognate]] traditions of the Southern [[Slavs|Slavic]] regions which would later be gathered into [[Yugoslavia]], and with the same admixture of [[Romanticism|romantic]] and [[nationalistic]] interests (he considered all those speaking the [[Eastern Herzegovinian dialect]] as Serbs). Somewhat later, but as part of the same scholarly enterprise of nationalist studies in folklore,&lt;ref&gt;[http://journal.oraltradition.org/files/articles/5i/5_radloff.pdf "Early Scholarship on Oral Traditions"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529035828/http://journal.oraltradition.org/files/articles/5i/5_radloff.pdf |date=2008-05-29 }}: Radloff, Jousse and Murko ''Oral Tradition'' 5:1 (1990) 73-90&lt;/ref&gt; the [[turcology|turcologist]] [[Vasily Radlov]] (1837–1918) would study the songs of the [[Kara-Kyrgyz Autonomous Oblast|Kara-Kirghiz]] in what would later become the Soviet Union; Karadzic and Radloff would provide models for the work of Parry.

===Walter Ong===
In a separate development, the [[media theory|media theorist]] [[Marshall McLuhan]] (1911–1980) would begin to focus attention on the ways that [[communication|communicative]] [[Mass media|media]] shape the nature of the content conveyed.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Marshall McLuhan, ''The Gutenberg Galaxy:  The Making of Typographic Man''.  University of Toronto Press, Toronto, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; He would serve as mentor to the [[Jesuit]], [[Walter Ong]] (1912–2003), whose interests in [[cultural history]], [[psychology]] and [[rhetoric]] would result in ''Orality and Literacy'' (Methuen, 1980) and the important but less-known ''Fighting for Life: Contest, Sexuality and Consciousness'' (Cornell, 1981)&lt;ref&gt;Walter J. Ong.  ''Fighting for Life:  Context, Sexuality, and Consciousness''.  Cornell University Press, Ithaca &amp; London, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; These two works articulated the contrasts between cultures defined by [[Orality#Primary orality|primary orality]], writing, print, and the [[secondary orality]] of the electronic age.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;Foley, John Miles. ''The Theory of Oral Composition''. Bloomington: IUP, 1991, pp. 57 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

| I style the morality of a culture totally untouched by any knowledge of writing or print, 'primary orality'.  It is 'primary' by contrast with the 'secondary orality' of present-day high technology culture, in which a new orality is sustained by telephone, radio, television and other electronic devices that depend for their existence and functioning on writing and print.  Today primary culture in the strict sense hardly exists, since every culture knows of writing and has some experience of its effects.  Still, to varying degrees many cultures and sub-cultures, even in a high-technology ambiance, preserve much of the mind-set of primary orality.&lt;ref&gt;Walter J. Ong.  ''Orality and Literacy'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

Ong's works also made possible an integrated theory of oral tradition which accounted for both production of content (the chief concern of Parry-Lord theory) and its reception.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt; This approach, like McLuhan's, kept the field open not just to the study of aesthetic culture but to the way physical and behavioral artifacts of oral societies are used to store, manage and transmit knowledge, so that oral tradition provides methods for investigation of cultural differences, other than the purely verbal, between oral and literate societies.

The most-often studied section of ''Orality and Literacy'' concerns the "[[psychodynamics]] of orality" This chapter seeks to define the fundamental characteristics of 'primary' orality and summarizes a series of descriptors (including but not limited to verbal aspects of culture) which might be used to index the relative orality or literacy of a given text or society.&lt;ref&gt;Walter J. Ong.  ''Orality and literacy:  the technologizing of the word'', pp. 31-76.&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Miles Foley===
In advance of Ong's synthesis, [[John Miles Foley]] began a series of papers based on his own fieldwork on South Slavic oral genres, emphasizing the dynamics of performers and audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John Miles. ''The Theory of Oral Composition''. Bloomington: IUP, 1991, p 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Foley effectively consolidated oral tradition as an academic field [http://illumination.missouri.edu/spr05/fol1.htm] when he compiled ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research'' in 1985. The bibliography gives a summary of the progress scholars made in evaluating the oral tradition up to that point, and includes a list of all relevant scholarly articles relating to the theory of [[Oral-Formulaic Composition]]. He also both established both the journal ''Oral Tradition'' and founded the ''Center for Studies in Oral Tradition'' (1986) at the [[University of Missouri]]. Foley developed Oral Theory beyond the somewhat mechanistic notions presented in earlier versions of Oral-Formulaic Theory, by extending Ong's interest in cultural features of oral societies beyond the verbal, by drawing attention to the agency of the [[bard]] and by describing how oral traditions bear meaning.

The bibliography  would establish a clear underlying methodology which accounted for the findings of scholars working in the separate [[Linguistics]] fields (primarily [[Ancient Greek]], Anglo-Saxon and Serbo-Croatian).  Perhaps more importantly, it would stimulate conversation among these specialties, so that a network of independent but allied investigations and investigators could be established.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John Miles. ''Oral Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography''. NY: Garland, 1985. ''The Theory of Oral Composition''. Bloomington: IUP, 1991, pp. 64-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Foley's key works include ''The Theory of Oral Composition'' (1988);&lt;ref&gt;John Miles Foley.  ''The Theory of Oral Composition:  History and Methodology''.  Indiana University Press, Bloomington and Indianapolis, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Immanent Art'' (1991); ''Traditional Oral Epic: The Odyssey, Beowulf and the Serbo-Croatian Return-Song'' (1993); ''The Singer of Tales in Performance'' (1995); ''Teaching Oral Traditions'' (1998); ''How to Read an Oral Poem'' (2002). His [http://www.pathwaysproject.org/pathways/show/HomePage Pathways Project] (2005-2012) draws parallels between the media dynamics of oral traditions and the [[Internet]].

===Acceptance and further elaboration===
The theory of oral tradition would undergo elaboration and development as it grew in acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John Miles. "Oral Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography." NY: Garland, 1985. ''The Theory of Oral Composition''. Bloomington: IUP, 1991, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; While the number of formulas documented for various traditions proliferated,&lt;ref&gt;A. Orchard, 'Oral Tradition', ''Reading Old English Texts'', ed. K O'Brien O'Keeffe (Cambridge, 1997), pp. 101-23&lt;/ref&gt; the concept of the formula remained lexically-bound. However, numerous innovations appeared, such as the "formulaic system"&lt;ref&gt;Fry, Donald K. "Old English Formulas and Systems" ''English Studies'' 48 (1967):193-204. responds to what was known, pejoratively, in Greek studies as the "hard Parryist" position, in which the formula was defined in terms of verbatim lexical repetition (see Rosenmyer, Thomas G. "The Formula in Early Greek Poetry" ''Arion'' 4 (1965):295-311). Fry's model proposes underlying generative templates which provide for variation and even artistic creativity within the constraints of strict metrical requirements and extempore composition-in-performance&lt;/ref&gt; with structural "substitution slots" for [[syntax|syntactic]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] and [[narrative]] necessity (as well as for artistic invention).&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Adam Brooke "Verba volent, scripta manent: Oral Tradition and the Non-Narrative Genres of Old English Poetry."

At the same time, the fairly rigid division between oral and literate was replaced by recognition of transitional and compartmentalized texts and societies, including models of [[diglossia]] ([[Brian Stock (historian)|Brian Stock]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Stock (historian)|Brian Stock]].

A study of the AG oral mentality that assumes (1) the existence of composition and thinking that took shape under the aegis of oral patterns, (2) the educational apparatus as an oral system, and (3) the origins of philosophy as we know it in the abstract intellectual reaction against the oral mentality. The opening section on historical background covers developments in archaeology and textual criticism (including Parry's work) since the late nineteenth century, with descriptions of and comments on formulaic and thematic structure. In "The Technique of the Oral Poet" (14-22), he sketches both a synchronic picture of the singer weaving his narrative and a diachronic view of the tradition developing over time. In the third part, on the psychology of performance, he discusses "the prevalence of rhythmic speech over prose; the prevalence of the event' over the abstraction'; and the prevalence of the paratactic arrangement of parts... over alternative schema possible in other styles" (23). In sympathy with Havelock (1963), he interprets Plato's reaction against the poets as one against the oral mentality and its educative process.&lt;/ref&gt; [[communication theory]],&lt;ref&gt;"Review: Communication Studies as American Studies" Daniel Czitrom  ''American Quarterly'', Vol. 42, No. 4 (Dec., 1990), pp. 678-683&lt;/ref&gt; [[Semiotics]],&lt;ref&gt;Nimis, Stephen A.

This paper has to do with the challenges of globalization in modern Nigeria and the process of "culture education," a terminology used to emphasize the peculiar means and methods of instruction by which a society imparts its body of values and mores in the pursuance and attainment of the society's collective vision, aspirations, and goals. Within this framework, this paper examines the legacies of imperialism and colonization within the Nigerian educational system––particularly in reference to the teaching of folklore and oral tradition––including the destruction of indigenous knowledge systems and the continuing lack of adequate resources in African universities. The paper concludes by offering suggestions for a more fully synthesized indigenous and formal Nigerian educational system as a method of addressing postcolonial rupture.

==Criticism and debates==
The theory of oral tradition encountered early resistance from scholars who perceived it as potentially supporting either one side or another in the controversy between what were known as [[Homeric question|"unitarians" and "analysts"]]&amp;nbsp;– that is, scholars who believed [[Homer]] to have been a single, historical figure, and those who saw him as a conceptual "author function," a convenient name to assign to what was essentially a repertoire of traditional narrative.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick M. Combellack]],  "Milman Parry and Homeric Artistry" ''Comparative Literature'', Vol. 11, No. 3 (Summer, 1959), pp. 193-208 . p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; A much more general dismissal of the theory and its implications simply described it as "unprovable"&lt;ref&gt;Rutherford, R.B. Homer: Odyssey Books XIX &amp; XX,, Cambridge UP 1992 remarks on oral-formulaic diction, pp. 47-49&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars, mainly outside the field of oral tradition,&lt;ref&gt;Botstein, Leon. "Hearing Is Seeing: Thoughts on the History of Music and the Imagination." ''The Musical Quarterly'' 1995 79(4):581-89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_folklore_research/v043/43.3oring.html Elliot Oring cites Bruchac, Joe Storytelling: Oral History or Game of 'Telephone'?"] ''American Folklore Society Newsletter'' 19/2:3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://christopherbutler.wordpress.com/2006/04/28/scriptural-transmission-inspiration-and-inerrancy/ |title=Christopher Butler cites Bart Ehrman, ‘Misquoting Jesus: The Story Behind Who Changed the Bible and Why’ |publisher=Christopherbutler.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105051417/http://christopherbutler.wordpress.com/2006/04/28/scriptural-transmission-inspiration-and-inerrancy/ |archivedate=2012-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.valdosta.edu/folkwriting/pdf/chapter4.PDF |title=chapter4.DOC |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213082630/http://www.valdosta.edu/folkwriting/pdf/chapter4.PDF |archivedate=2012-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; represent (either dismissively or with approval) this body of theoretical work as reducing the great [[Epic poetry|epics]] to children's party games like "[[telephone (game)|telephone]]" or "[[Chinese whispers]]".  While games provide amusement by showing how messages distort content via uncontextualized transmission, Parry's supporters argue that the theory of oral tradition reveals how oral methods optimized the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] and thus improved the quality, stability and [[integrity]] of content transmission.&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard. ''The God Delusion''. Great Britain: Bantam, 2006 p. 118 -- Dawkins contradicts this view, however, on p. 227)&lt;/ref&gt;

There were disputes concerning particular findings of the theory. For example, those trying to support or refute Crowne's hypothesis found the "Hero on the Beach" formula in numerous Old English poems. Similarly, it was also discovered in other works of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] origin, [[Middle English poetry]], and even an [[Iceland]]ic prose [[saga]]. J.A. Dane, in an article&lt;ref&gt;Dane, J.A. "Finnsburh and Iliad IX: A Greek Survival of the Medieval Germanic Oral-Formulaic Theme  The Hero on the Beach." ''Neophilologus'' 66:443-449&lt;/ref&gt; characterized as "polemics without rigor"&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John Miles. ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography'', (NY: Garland Publishing, 1985), p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that the appearance of the theme in [[Ancient Greek]] poetry, a tradition without known connection to the Germanic, invalidated the notion of "an autonomous theme in the baggage of an oral poet."

Within Homeric studies specifically, Lord's ''[[The Singer of Tales]]'', which focused on problems and questions that arise in conjunction with applying oral-formulaic theory to problematic texts such as the ''[[Iliad]]'', ''[[Odyssey]]'', and even ''[[Beowulf]]'', influenced nearly all of the articles written on [[Homer]] and oral-formulaic composition thereafter. However, in response to Lord, Geoffrey Kirk published ''The Songs of Homer'', questioning Lord's extension of the oral-formulaic nature of Serbian and Croatian literature (the area from which the theory was first developed) to Homeric epic. Kirk argues that Homeric poems differ from those traditions in their "metrical strictness", "formular system[s]", and creativity. In other words, Kirk argued that Homeric poems were recited under a system that gave the reciter much more freedom to choose words and passages to get to the same end than the Serbo-Croatian poet, who was merely "reproductive".&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, Geoffrey S. ''The Songs of Homer.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1962. pp88 - 91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John M. ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography.'' New York: Garland Publishing, Inc, 1985. p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Eric Havelock's ''Preface to Plato'' revolutionized how scholars looked at Homeric epic by arguing not only that it was the product of an oral tradition, but also that the oral-formulas contained therein served as a way for ancient Greeks to preserve cultural knowledge across many different generations.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John M. ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography.'' New York: Garland Publishing, Inc, 1985. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Parry]], in his 1966 work "Have we Homer's ''Iliad''?", theorized the existence of the most fully developed oral poet to his time, a person who could (at his discretion) creatively and intellectually create nuanced characters in the context of the accepted, traditional story. In fact, he discounted the Serbo-Croatian tradition to an "unfortunate" extent, choosing to elevate the Greek model of oral-tradition above all others.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John M. ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography.'' New York: Garland Publishing, Inc, 1985. pp. 36, 505.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parry, Adam. "Have we Homer's ''Iliad''?"''Yale Classical Studies.''20 (1966), pp.. 177-216.&lt;/ref&gt; Lord reacted to Kirk's and Parry's essays with "Homer as Oral Poet", published in 1968, which reaffirmed Lord's belief in the relevance of Yugoslav poetry and its similarities to Homer and downplayed the intellectual and literary role of the reciters of Homeric epic.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John M. ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography.'' New York: Garland Publishing, Inc, 1985. pp. 40, 406.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the criticisms of the theory have been absorbed into the evolving field as useful refinements and modifications. For example, in what Foley called a "pivotal" contribution, [[Larry Benson]] introduced the concept of "written-formulaic" to describe the status of some Anglo-Saxon poetry which, while demonstrably written, contains evidence of oral influences, including heavy reliance on formulas and themes&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John M. ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography''. New York: Garland Publishing, Inc. 1985. p. 42.; Foley cites "The Literary Character of Anglo-Saxon Formulaic Poetry" Publications of the Modern Language Association 81 (1966):, 334-41&lt;/ref&gt; A number of individual scholars in many areas continue to have misgivings about the applicability of the theory or the aptness of the South Slavic comparison,&lt;ref&gt;George E. Dimock. "From Homer to Novi Pazar and B ack." ''Arion'', 2, iv:40-57. Reacts against the Parry-Lord hypothesis of an oral Homer, claiming that, although Lord demonstrated that the oral poet thinks in verse and offered many explanations of the various facets of the Homeric Question by recourse to the Yugoslav analogy, the difference between Homer and other, literate poets is one of degree rather than kind. Wants to rescue Homer's art from what he sees as the dangers inherent in the oral theory model.&lt;/ref&gt; and particularly what they regard as its implications for the creativity which may legitimately be attributed to the individual artist.&lt;ref&gt;Perhaps the most prominent and steadfast opponent of oral traditional theory on these grounds was [[Arthur Brodeur]], in, e.g., ''The Art of Beowulf''. Berkeley: University of California Press. 3rd printing 1969; "A Study of Diction and Style in Three Anglo-Saxon Narrative Poems." In ''Nordica et Anglica''. Ed. Allan H. Orrick. The Hague: Mouton. pp. 97-114; "Beowulf: One Poem or Three?" In ''Medieval Literature and Folklore Studies in Honor of Francis Lee Utley''. Ed. Jerome Mandel and Bruce A. Rosenberg. New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press. pp. 3-26.&lt;/ref&gt; However, at present, there seems to be little systematic or theoretically coordinated challenge to the fundamental tenets of the theory; as Foley put it, ""there have been numerous suggestions for revisions or modifications of the theory, but the majority of controversies have generated further understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John Miles. ''The Theory of Oral Composition: History and Methodology''. Bloomington:IUP, 1988." p.93&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Orchestral build''' is a term used in [[disco]] music to describe the systematic overlapping of prerecorded elements of the [[symphony orchestra]] during an [[wikt:interlude|interlude]] of a song.

On the song's [[break (music)|break]], the melody was reintroduced on top of the [[drum]]s, [[timpani]], and [[percussion instruments|percussions]], by sequential highlighting of the various rhythm instruments, such as the [[bass guitar]], [[guitar]], [[rhythm guitar]], [[piano]], [[harp]], then followed by the [[woodwinds]], then [[horn section|horns]], then [[string instruments|strings]], until all were assembled into a harmonious whole.

As the identifying trademark of the ''[[disco mix]]'', the '''orchestral build''' was implemented after a break in order to accentuate the melodic structure of the composition, and thereby propel dance-floor participants into a ''natural-[[high (emotion)|high]]''.

'''Pech Merle''' is a cave which opens onto a hillside at [[Cabrerets]] in the [[Lot (département)|Lot département]] of the [[Occitania (administrative region)|Occitania]] region in [[France]], about 35 minutes by road east of [[Cahors]]. It is one of the few [[pre-historic art|prehistoric]] [[cave painting]] sites in France that remain open to the general public. Extending for over a kilometre and a half from the entrance are caverns, the walls of which are painted with dramatic murals dating from the [[Gravettian]] culture (some 25,000 years BC). Some of the paintings and engravings, however, may date from the later [[Magdalenian]] era (16,000 years BC).

This area once had a great river flowing through it, cutting underground channels which were later used by humans for shelter and eventually for mural painting.

The cave art located in the deeper areas of the cave was discovered in 1922 by Marthe David, her brother Andre David and Henri Dutetre, three teenagers who had been exploring the cave for two years. Like other children of the area, these three had been encouraged and assisted in their exploration by Father Amedee Lemozi, the curate of Cabrerets and an amateur archaeologist who had discovered other cave paintings in the region.&lt;ref name=Lawson/&gt;

The walls of seven of the chambers at Pech Merle have fresh, lifelike images of [[woolly mammoth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.donsmaps.com/images3/mammothpechmerle.jpg |title=Mammoth, Pech Merle |accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; spotted horses,&lt;ref name=Pruvost/&gt; single colour horses, bovids, reindeer, handprints,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adams|first1=Laurie|title=Art Across Time|publisher=Mc-Graw Hill|page=34|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some humans. Footprints of children, preserved in what was once clay, have been found more than half a mile underground. In 2013 the [[Tracking in Caves|Tracking in Caves-project]] tested experience based reading of prehistoric footprints by specialised trackers of [[San people|Ju/'hoansi San]] with great success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/06/130603113353.htm |title='Tracking in caves': On the trail of pre-historic humans -- ScienceDaily |publisher=sciencedaily |date=  |author= |accessdate= February 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tracking-in-caves-online.de/start/projekt/ |title=project – Tracking in Caves |publisher=Tracking-in-caves-online.de |date=  |author= |accessdate= February 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a six-mile radius of the site are ten other caves with prehistoric [[paleolithic art|art]] of the [[Upper Palaeolithic]] period, but none of these are open to the public. During the [[Ice Age]] the caves were very probably used as places of refuge by prehistoric peoples when the area had an Arctic climate, very cold temperatures, and native animal species very different from those of the present day. It is supposed that, at some point in the past, rain and sliding earth covered the cave entrances with an airtight seal until the 20th century.

Experimental reconstruction work by French archaeologist Michel Lorblanchet has suggested that the application of the paint for some of the paintings was probably by means of a delicate spitting technique.&lt;ref name=Lorblanchet/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nova/&gt;

The cave at Pech Merle has been open to the public since 1926.&lt;ref name=PechMerleCentre/&gt; Visiting groups are limited in size and number so as not to destroy the delicate artwork with the excessive humidity, heat and [[carbon dioxide]] produced by breathing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7835">'''Phonemic awareness''' is a subset of [[phonological awareness]] in which listeners are able to hear, identify and manipulate [[phonemes]], the smallest mental units of [[sound]] that helps to differentiate units of meaning ([[morphemes]]). Separating the spoken word "cat" into three distinct phonemes, [[Voiceless velar stop|{{IPA|/k/}}]], [[Near-open front unrounded vowel|{{IPA|/æ/}}]], and [[Voiceless dental and alveolar stops|{{IPA|/t/}}]], requires phonemic awareness. However, phonemes could not be separated like notes in a song or could be identified in isolation.
The [[National Reading Panel]] has found that phonemic awareness improves children's word [[Reading (process)|reading]] and [[reading comprehension]], as well as helping children learn to spell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/nrp/findings.cfm |title=Findings and Determinations of the National Reading Panel by Topic Areas |format= |work=NICHD |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705194256/http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/nrp/findings.cfm |archivedate=2008-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phonemic awareness is the basis for learning [[phonics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.readingonline.org/critical/shanahan/panel.html |title=Critical Issues: The National Reading Panel |work=Reading Online |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phonemic awareness and phonological awareness are often confused since they are interdependent. Phonemic awareness is the ability to hear and manipulate individual phonemes. Phonological awareness includes this ability, but it also includes the ability to hear and manipulate larger units of sound, such as [[Syllable_onset#Onset|onset]]s and [[syllable rime|rime]]s and [[syllable]]s.

Studies by Vickie Snider have shown that phonemic awareness has a direct correlation with students' ability to read as they get older.  Phonemic awareness builds a foundation for students to understand the rules of the English language.  This in turn allows each student to apply these skills and increase his or her oral [[Fluency|reading fluency]] and understanding of the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Snider | first = Vicki E. | title = The Relationship between Phonemic Awareness and Later Reading Achievement | jstor = 27542094 | publisher =  JSTOR | year =  1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A research study done by Robert Johnson and Gregory Tweedie applying direct Phonemic Awareness (PA) instruction to young English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners in rural Malaysia showed that those children educated by PA achieved significantly greater test scores than the control group. PA accelerated the acquisition of relevant literacy and numeracy skills in this case. It also suggested that PA might help close the literacy and numeracy education gap between urban pre-school attender and rural non attender children. However, this enhancement needs to be validated by further research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=R. C.|last2=Tweedie|first2=M. G.|date=|year=2010|title=Could phonemic awareness instruction be (part of) the answer for young EFL learners?

Despite the substantial gains in vowel recognition, a downside of using PA, not in this study, is that adult ELLs may negatively perceive PA as a "childish" approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tweedie|first=|last2=Johnson|first2=|last3=et al.|date=|year=2015|title=Direct phonemic awareness instruction as a means of improving academic text comprehension for adult English language learners.|url=https://journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/index.php/jet/article/view/44221/31659|journal=Journal of Educational Thought|volume=48|issue=1-2|pages=81-102|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Phonemic awareness relates to the ability to distinguish and manipulate individual sounds, such as {{IPA|/f/}}, {{IPA|/ʊ/}}, and {{IPA|/t/}} in the case of ''foot''. The following are common phonemic awareness skills practiced with students:
* Phoneme isolation: which requires recognizing the individual sounds in words, for example, "Tell me the first sound you hear in the word paste" ({{IPA|/p/}}).
* Phoneme identity: which requires recognizing the common sound in different words, for example, "Tell me the sound that is the same in bike, boy and bell" ({{IPA|/b/}}).
* Phoneme substitution: in which one can turn a word (such as "cat") into another (such as "hat") by substituting one phoneme (such as {{IPA|/h/}}) for another ({{IPA|/k/}}).  Phoneme substitution can take place for initial sounds (cat-hat), middle sounds (cat-cut) or ending sounds (cat-cap).
* Oral segmenting: The teacher says a word, for example, "ball," and students say the individual sounds, {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/ɔː/}}, and {{IPA|/l/}}.
* Oral blending: The teacher says each sound, for example, "{{IPA|/b/, /ɔː/, /l/}}" and students respond with the word, "ball".
* Sound deletion: The teacher says a word, has students repeat it, and then instructs students to repeat the word without the first sound. For example, the teacher might say "now say 'bill' without the {{IPA|/b/}}", which students should respond to with "ill".
* Onset-rime manipulation: which requires isolation, identification, segmentation, blending, or deletion of onsets (the single consonant or blend that precedes the vowel and following consonants), for example, j-ump, st-op, str-ong. 
There are other phonemic awareness activities, such as sound substitution, where students are instructed to replace one sound with another; sound addition, where students add sounds to words; and sound switching, where students manipulate the order of the phonemes. These are more complex but research supports the use of the three listed above, particularly oral segmenting and oral blending.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Yopp | first = Hallie K. | title = Developing Phonemic Awareness in Young Children | publisher = The Reading Teacher Vol. 45, No. 9, 1992 A Journal of the International Reading Association | url = http://www.reading.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Portal''''' is a [[Puzzle video game|puzzle]]-[[Platform game|platform]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Valve Corporation]]. It was released in a [[Product bundling|bundle package]] called ''[[The Orange Box]]'' for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]] in 2007. The game has since been ported to other systems, including [[OS X]], [[Linux]], and [[Android (operating system)|Android]].

''Portal'' consists primarily of a series of puzzles that must be solved by [[Teleportation|teleporting]] the player's character and simple objects using "the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device", a device that can create inter-spatial [[Portal (fiction)|portals]] between two flat planes. The player-character, [[Chell (Portal)|Chell]], is challenged and taunted by an [[artificial intelligence]] named [[GLaDOS]] (Genetic Lifeform and [[Disk Operating System]]) to complete each puzzle in the Aperture Science Enrichment Center using the portal gun with the promise of receiving cake when all the puzzles are completed. The game's unique physics allows kinetic energy to be retained through portals, requiring creative use of portals to maneuver through the test chambers. This gameplay element is based on a similar concept from the game ''[[Narbacular Drop]]''; many of the team members from the [[DigiPen Institute of Technology]] who worked on ''Narbacular Drop'' were hired by Valve for the creation of ''Portal'', making it a [[spiritual successor]] to the game.

''Portal'' was acclaimed as one of the most original games of 2007, despite criticisms of its short duration and limited story. The game received praise for its originality, unique gameplay and dark story with a humorous series of dialogue. GLaDOS, voiced by [[Ellen McLain]] in the English-language version, received acclaim for her unique characterization, and the end credits song "[[Still Alive]]", written by [[Jonathan Coulton]] for the game, was acclaimed for its original composition and humorous twist. Excluding Steam download sales, over four million copies of the game have been sold since its release, spawning official merchandise from Valve including plush Companion Cubes, as well as fan recreations of the cake and portal gun, a standalone version, titled ''[[Portal: Still Alive]]'', on the [[Xbox Live Arcade]] service in October 2008, which added an additional 14 puzzles to the gameplay, and a sequel, ''[[Portal 2]]'', which was released in 2011, adding several new gameplay mechanics and a cooperative multiplayer mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/90702/portal-2-delay-sarcastically-confirmed-by-valve/ |title=Portal 2 delay sarcastically confirmed by Valve |publisher=Inquisitr.com |date=November 19, 2010 |accessdate=November 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Portal'', the player controls the protagonist, [[Chell (Portal)|Chell]], from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]] as she is challenged to navigate through a series of rooms using the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, or portal gun, under the watchful supervision of the artificial intelligence [[GLaDOS]]. The portal gun can create two distinct portal ends, orange and blue. The portals create a visual and physical connection between two different locations in [[three-dimensional space]]. Neither end is specifically an entrance or exit; all objects that travel through one portal will exit through the other. An important aspect of the game's physics is momentum redirection.&lt;ref name="commentary"&gt;{{Cite video game|title = Portal|developer = [[Valve Corporation]]|date = October 9, 2007|level = In-game developer commentary}}&lt;/ref&gt; As moving objects pass through portals, they come through the exit portal at the same direction that the exit portal is facing and with the same speed with which they passed through the entrance portal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3770/games_demystified_portal.php | title = Games Demystified: Portal | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | first = Jeremy | last = Alessi | date = August 26, 2008 | accessdate = August 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a common maneuver is to jump down to a portal on the floor and emerge through a wall, flying over a gap or another obstacle. This allows the player to launch objects or Chell over great distances, both vertically and horizontally, referred to as 'flinging' by Valve.&lt;ref name="commentary" /&gt; As GLaDOS puts it, "In layman's terms: speedy thing goes in, speedy thing comes out." If portal ends are not on parallel planes, the character passing through is reoriented to be upright with respect to gravity after leaving a portal end.

Chell and all other objects in the game that can fit into the portal ends will pass through the portal. However, a portal shot cannot pass through an open portal; it will simply deactivate or create a new portal in an offset position. Creating a portal end instantly deactivates an existing portal end of the same color. Moving objects, glass, special wall surfaces, liquids, or areas that are too small will not be able to anchor portals. Chell is sometimes provided with cubes that she can pick up and use to climb on or to hold down large buttons that open doors or activate mechanisms. Particle fields known as emancipation grills, occasionally called "fizzlers" in the developer commentary, exist at the end of all and within some test chambers; when passed through, they will deactivate any active portals and disintegrate any object carried through. The fields also block attempts to fire portals through them.&lt;ref name="360 manual"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Orange Box manual (Xbox 360 version) | publisher = Valve Corporation | year = 2007 | pages = 12–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Chell is equipped with mechanized heel springs to prevent damage from falling,&lt;ref name="commentary" /&gt; she can be killed by various other hazards in the test chambers, such as turret guns, bouncing balls of energy, and toxic liquid. She can also be killed by objects falling through portals, and by a series of crushers that appear in certain levels. Unlike most action games at the time, there is no [[Health (gaming)|health]] indicator; Chell dies if she is dealt a certain amount of damage in a short time period, but returns to full health fairly quickly. Some obstacles, such as the energy balls and crushing pistons, deal fatal damage with a single blow.

==Synopsis==
&lt;!--DO NOT ADD EXCESSIVE DETAILS TO THE PLOT. A BLOW-BY-BLOW EXPLANATION OF THE PLOT IS NOT APPROPRIATE (see [[WP:NOT#PLOT]]). DO NOT ADD SPOILER TAGS. THE SECTION TITLE "PLOT SYNOPSIS" CARRIES THE [[WP:SPOILER]] WARNING IMPLICITLY. --&gt;

===Characters===
The game features two characters&lt;!-- Please, do NOT change to 3 characters. The Weighted Companion Cube is NOT a character, but merely a main item used in the game. --&gt;: the [[player character|player-controlled]] [[silent protagonist]] named [[Chell (Portal)|Chell]], and [[GLaDOS]] (Genetic Lifeform and [[Disk Operating System]]), a computer [[artificial intelligence]] that monitors and directs the player. In the English-language version, GLaDOS is voiced by [[Ellen McLain]], though her voice has been altered to sound more artificial. The only background information presented about Chell is given by GLaDOS; the credibility of these facts, such as Chell being adopted, an orphan, and having no friends, is questionable at best, as GLaDOS is a liar by her own admission. In the "Lab Rat" comic created by Valve to bridge the gap between ''Portal'' and ''[[Portal 2]]'', Chell's records reveal she was ultimately rejected as a test subject for having "too much tenacity"—the main reason Doug Rattman, a former employee of Aperture Science, moved Chell to the top of the test queue.&lt;ref name="labrat part 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="labrat part 2" /&gt;

===Setting===
{{anchor|Aperture Science}}
[[File:Aperture Laboratories Logo.svg|thumb|The logo for Aperture Science Laboratories]]
''Portal'' takes place in the [[Locations of Half-Life#Aperture Science Laboratories|Aperture Science Laboratories Computer-Aided Enrichment Center]]—Aperture Science for short—which is a research facility responsible for the creation of the portal gun. According to information presented in ''Portal 2'', the location of the complex is in the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]]. Aperture Science exists in the same universe as the [[Half-Life (series)]], although connections between the two franchises are limited to references.

Information about the company, developed by Valve for creating the setting of the game, is revealed during the game and via the real-world promotional website.&lt;ref name="gi apsci history"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2010/03/24/Aperture-Science_3A00_-A-History.aspx | title = Aperture Science: A History | first = Meagan | last = VanBurkleo | work = [[Game Informer]] | date = March 24, 2010 | accessdate = March 24, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100327072045/http://gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2010/03/24/Aperture-Science_3A00_-A-History.aspx | archive-date = March 27, 2010 | dead-url = yes | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Aperture Science website, [[Cave Johnson (Portal)|Cave Johnson]] founded the company in 1943 for the sole purpose of making [[shower curtain]]s for the U.S. military. However, after becoming mentally unstable from "moon rock poisoning" in 1978, Johnson created a three-tier [[research and development]] plan to make his organization successful. The first two tiers, the [[Abdominal thrusts|Counter-Heimlich Maneuver]] (a maneuver designed to ensure choking) and the [[Make-A-Wish Foundation|Take-A-Wish Foundation]] (a program to give the wishes of terminally ill children to adults in need of dreams), were commercial failures and led to an investigation of the company by the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]. However, when the investigative committee heard of the success of the third tier—a person-sized, ad-hoc quantum tunnel through physical space, with a possible application as a shower curtain—it recessed permanently and gave Aperture Science an open-ended contract to continue its research. The development of GLaDOS, an artificially intelligent research assistant and disk-operating system, began in 1986 in response to [[Black Mesa Research Facility|Black Mesa]]'s work on similar portal technology.&lt;ref name="aperture"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aperturescience.com | title = Aperture Science Web Site (login: cjohnson password: tier3) | publisher = Valve}}&lt;/ref&gt; A presentation seen during gameplay reveals that GLaDOS was also included in a proposed bid for de-icing fuel lines, incorporated as a fully functional disk-operation system that is arguably alive, unlike Black Mesa's proposal, which inhibits ice, nothing more.&lt;ref name="gi portal hl"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2010/03/10/opening-the-portal-exploring-portal-s-creation-and-its-ties-to-half-life-2.aspx | title = Exploring Portal's Creation And Its Ties To Half-Life 2 | first = Ben | last = Reeves | date = March 10, 2010 | accessdate = March 10, 2010 | work = [[Game Informer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly thirteen years later, work on GLaDOS was completed and the untested AI was activated during the company's first ever [[Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day|bring-your-daughter-to-work day]] in May 2000.&lt;ref name="gi apsci history" /&gt; Immediately after activation, the facility was flooded with deadly neurotoxin by the AI. Events of the first ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' game occur shortly thereafter, presumably leaving the facility forgotten by the outside world due to apocalyptic happenings. Wolpaw, in describing the ending of ''Portal 2'', affirmed that the [[Combine (Half-Life)|Combine]] invasion, chronologically taking place after ''Half-Life'' and before ''[[Half-Life 2]]'', had occurred before ''Portal 2''{{'}}s events.&lt;ref name="pcgamer p2 wolpaw interview"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pcgamer.com/2011/04/26/erik-wolpaw-on-portal-2s-ending-the-spoiler-is-probably-lurking-out-there-somewhere/ | title =Erik Wolpaw on Portal 2’s ending: "the [spoiler] is probably lurking out there somewhere" | first = Rich | last = Stanton | date = April 26, 2011 | accessdate = April 26, 2011 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The areas of the Enrichment Center that Chell explores suggest that it is part of a massive research installation. At the time of events depicted in ''Portal'', the facility seems to be long-deserted, although most of its equipment remains operational without human control.&lt;ref name="1up pc review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3163578 |title=Portal (PC) |first=Shawn |last=Elliot |date=October 10, 2007 |accessdate=August 3, 2008 |publisher=1UP |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/613KhN5op?url=http://www.1up.com/reviews/portal |archivedate=August 19, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; During its development, ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode Two]]'' featured a chapter set on Aperture Science's [[icebreaker]] ship ''Borealis'', but this was abandoned and removed before release.&lt;ref name="raisingthebar"&gt;{{cite book | author=Valve Corp. | title=Raising the Bar | publisher=Prima Games | location=Roseville | year=2004 | isbn=0-7615-4364-3 | url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57189955 | page=117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plot===
''Portal''{{'}}s plot is revealed to the player via audio messages or "announcements" from [[GLaDOS]] and visual elements inside rooms found in later levels. According to ''The Final Hours of Portal 2'', the year is established to be "somewhere in 2010"—twelve years after Aperture Science's abandonment.

The game begins with Chell waking up from a stasis bed and hearing instructions and warnings from [[GLaDOS]], an [[artificial intelligence]], about the upcoming test experience. Chell then enters into distinct test chambers that introduce players to the game's mechanics, sequentially. GLaDOS's announcements serve as instructions to Chell and help the player progress through the game, but also develops the atmosphere and characterizes the AI as a person.&lt;ref name="commentary" /&gt; Chell is promised [[cake]] and [[grief counseling]] as her reward if she manages to complete all the test chambers.&lt;ref name="gamespy pc review"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/portal/826434p1.html |title=Portal (PC) |first=Sal | last = Accardo | date = October 9, 2007 | accessdate = February 25, 2008 | publisher = GameSpy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chell proceeds through the empty Enrichment Center, with GLaDOS as her only interaction. As the player nears completion, GLaDOS's motives turn more sinister than her helpful demeanor suggests; although she is designed to appear helpful and encouraging, GLaDOS's actions and speech suggest insincerity and callous disregard for the safety and well-being of the test subjects. The test chambers become increasingly dangerous as Chell proceeds, and GLaDOS even directs Chell through a live-fire course designed for military androids as a result of "mandatory scheduled maintenance" in the regular test chamber, as well as having some test chambers flooded with a bio-hazardous liquid. In another chamber, GLaDOS boasts about the fidelity and importance of the Weighted Companion Cube, a waist-high crate with a single large pink heart centered on each face, for helping Chell to complete the chamber. However, GLaDOS then declares that it "unfortunately must be [[Euthanasia|euthanized]]" in an "emergency intelligence [[incinerator]]" before Chell can continue.&lt;ref name="1up pc review" /&gt; Some of the later chambers include automated turrets with childlike voices (also voiced by McLain) that fire at Chell, only to sympathize with her after being destroyed or disabled, such as "I don't blame you" and "No hard feelings".&lt;ref name="eurogamer pc review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=85005 |title=Portal |first=Tom |last = Bradwell |date=October 10, 2007 | accessdate = February 25, 2008 | publisher = Eurogamer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ign pc review"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://pc.ign.com/articles/825/825987p1.html | title = Portal Review | first = Dan | last = Adams | date = October 9, 2007 | accessdate = February 25, 2008 | publisher = IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Chell completes the final test chamber, GLaDOS congratulates her and prepares her "victory candescence", maneuvering Chell into an incinerator in an attempt to kill her. As GLaDOS assures her that "all Aperture technologies remain safely operational up to 4,000 degrees{{Sic}} [[Kelvin]] (3,727 °C, or 6,740 °F)", Chell escapes with the use of the portal gun and makes her way through the maintenance areas within the Enrichment Center.&lt;ref name="wellplayed"&gt;{{cite book | title = Well Played 1.0: Video Game, Value and Meaning | isbn = 978-0-557-06975-0 | editor = Drew Davidson | year = 2009 | first = Nick | last = Montfort | chapter = Portal of Ivory, Passage of Horn | publisher = ETC Press | url = http://www.etc.cmu.edu/etcpress/content/portal-passage-nick-montfort | display-editors = etal | access-date = January 17, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100108061935/http://www.etc.cmu.edu/etcpress/content/portal-passage-nick-montfort# | archive-date = January 8, 2010 | dead-url = yes | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; GLaDOS becomes panicked and insists that she was only pretending to kill Chell, as part of testing. GLaDOS then asks Chell to assume the "party escort submission position", lying face-first on the ground, so that a "party associate" can take her to her reward, but Chell continues anyway. Throughout this section, GLaDOS still sends messages to Chell and it becomes clear that she became corrupt and had killed everyone else in the center, which is also revealed in a later comic.&lt;ref name="labrat part 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="labrat part 2" /&gt; Chell makes her way through the maintenance areas and empty office spaces behind the chambers, sometimes following graffiti messages which point in the right direction. These backstage areas, which are in an extremely dilapidated state, stand in stark contrast to the pristine test chambers. The graffiti includes statements such as "the cake is a lie", and [[pastiche]]s of [[Emily Dickinson]]'s poem "The Chariot", [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s "The Reaper and the Flowers", and [[Emily Brontë]]'s "No Coward Soul Is Mine", referring to and mourning the death of the Companion Cube.&lt;ref name="commentary" /&gt;

GLaDOS attempts to dissuade Chell with threats of physical harm and misleading statements claiming that she is going the wrong way as Chell makes her way deeper into the maintenance areas. Eventually, Chell reaches a large chamber where GLaDOS's hardware hangs overhead. GLaDOS continues to plead with and threaten Chell, but during the exchange, a sphere falls off of GLaDOS and Chell drops it in an incinerator. GLaDOS reveals that Chell has just destroyed the morality core or her conscience, one of the multiple "personality cores" which the Aperture Science employees allegedly installed after GLaDOS flooded the enrichment center with a deadly neurotoxin gas, and goes on to state that now there is nothing to prevent her from doing so once again. A six-minute countdown starts as Chell dislodges and incinerates more of GLaDOS' personality cores, while GLaDOS attempts to discourage her both verbally, with a series of taunts and increasingly juvenile insults, and physically by firing rockets at her. After Chell has destroyed the final personality core, a portal malfunction tears the room apart and transports everything to the surface. Chell is then seen lying outside the facility's gates amid the remains of GLaDOS. One of the final scenes is changed through a patch of the PC version that was made available a few days before ''Portal 2''{{'}}s announcement; in this [[retroactive continuity]], Chell is dragged away from the scene by an unseen entity speaking in a robotic voice, thanking her for assuming the "party escort submission position", revealing the entity to be a "party associate".&lt;ref name="gi portal hl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="shacknews update 2" /&gt;

The final scene, after a long and speedy zoom through the bowels of the facility, shows a [[Black Forest cake]],&lt;ref name="german chocolate"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gametrailers.com/gametrailerstv_player.php?ep=10&amp;sd=1&amp;ch=4 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080305005301/http://www.gametrailers.com/gametrailerstv_player.php?ep=10&amp;sd=1&amp;ch=4 | archivedate = March 5, 2008 | title = GameTrailers Episode 106 | accessdate = March 25, 2008 | author = Geoff, Keighley | date = March 1, 2008 | publisher = GameTrailers.com |deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Weighted Companion Cube, surrounded by a mix of shelves containing dozens of apparently inactive personality cores. One by one a number of the cores begin to light up, before a robotic arm descends and extinguishes the candle on the cake, causing the room to blackout.&lt;ref name="gi p2 reveal"&gt;{{cite news | title = Portal 2 | first = Meagan | last= VanBurkleo | date = April 2010 | pages = 50–62 | work = [[Game Informer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the credits roll, GLaDOS delivers a concluding report: the song "[[Still Alive]]", which declares the experiment to be a huge success, as well as serving to indicate to the player that GLaDOS is still alive,&lt;ref name="portal the skinny" /&gt; that her "happy" core wasn't disabled.

==Development==
===Concept===
''Portal'' is Valve's [[spiritual successor]] to the freeware game ''[[Narbacular Drop]]'', the 2005 independent game released by students of the [[DigiPen Institute of Technology]]; the original ''Narbacular Drop'' team was subsequently hired by Valve.&lt;ref name="narbdrop-confirm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nuclearmonkeysoftware.com/news.html?46 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928221628/http://www.nuclearmonkeysoftware.com/news.html?46 |archivedate=September 28, 2007 |title=Things are heating up! |publisher=Narbacular Drop official site |date=July 17, 2006 |accessdate=July 21, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gilombardi"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200608/N06.0825.1923.12789.htm |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071002110610/http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200608/N06.0825.1923.12789.htm |archivedate = October 2, 2007 |title = GC 06:Valve's Doug Lombardi Talks Half-Life 2 Happenings |accessdate = September 27, 2007 |author = Berghammer, Billy |date = August 25, 2006 |publisher = [[Game Informer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valve became interested in ''Narbacular Drop'' after seeing the game at DigiPen's annual career fair; Robin Walker, one of Valve's developers, saw the game at the fair and later contacted the team providing them with advice and offering to show their game at Valve's offices. After their presentation, Valve's president [[Gabe Newell]] quickly offered the entire team jobs at Valve to develop the game further.&lt;ref name="seattletimes portal"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2014794592_brier18.html | title = 'Portal' backstory a real Cinderella tale | first = Breir | last = Dudley | date = April 17, 2011 | accessdate = April 17, 2011 | work = [[Seattle Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Newell later commented that he was impressed with the DigiPen team as "they had actually carried the concept through", already having included the interaction between portals and physics, completing most of the work that Valve would have had to commit on their own.&lt;ref name="seattletimes portal" /&gt; Certain elements have been retained from ''Narbacular Drop'', such as the system of identifying the two unique portal endpoints with the colors orange and blue. A key difference in the signature portal mechanic between the two games however is that ''Portal''{{'}}s portal gun cannot create a portal through an existing portal unlike in ''Narbacular Drop''. The game's original setting, of a princess trying to escape a dungeon, was dropped in favor of the Aperture Science approach.&lt;ref name="seattletimes portal" /&gt; ''Portal'' took approximately two years and four months to complete after the DigiPen team was brought into Valve,&lt;ref name="planet hl interview" /&gt; and no more than ten people were involved with its development.&lt;ref name="shacknews gdc08 interview" /&gt; ''Portal'' writer [[Erik Wolpaw]], who, along with fellow writer [[Chet Faliszek]], was hired by Valve for the game, claimed that "Without the constraints, ''Portal'' would not be as good a game".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.next-gen.biz/news/gdc-portal-postmortem | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120905022731/http://www.next-gen.biz/news/gdc-portal-postmortem | dead-url = yes | archive-date = September 5, 2012 | title = GDC: A Portal Postmortem | publisher = Next-Gen Biz | first = Mary Jane | last = Irwin | date = February 23, 2008 | accessdate = February 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first year of development the team focused mostly on the gameplay without any narrative structure. Playtesters found the game to be fun but asked about what these test chambers were leading towards. This prompted to team to come up with a narrative for ''Portal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pcgamer.com/valve-reflects-on-the-orange-box-ten-years-later/ | title = Valve reflects on The Orange Box, ten years later | first = Samuel | last=  Roberts | date = October 10, 2017 | accessdate = October 10, 2017 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Portal'' team worked with ''Half-Life'' series writer [[Marc Laidlaw]] on fitting the game into the series' plot.&lt;ref name="1upinterview"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?pager.offset=0&amp;cId=3153489 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213231/http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?pager.offset=0&amp;cId=3153489 |dead-url = yes |archive-date = September 27, 2007 |title = Portal Preview |accessdate = September 11, 2006 |author = Leone |date = September 8, 2006 |publisher = [[1UP.com]] |first = Matt }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was done, in part, due to the limited art capabilities of the small team; instead of creating new assets for ''Portal'', they decided to tie the game to an existing franchise—''Half-Life''—to allow them to reuse the ''Half-Life 2'' art assets.&lt;ref name="gi portal hl" /&gt; Wolpaw and Faliszek were put to work on the dialogue for ''Portal''.&lt;ref name="gilombardi" /&gt; The concept of a computer AI guiding the player through experimental facilities to test the portal gun was arrived at early in the writing process.&lt;ref name="gi portal hl" /&gt; They drafted early lines for the yet-named "polite" AI with humorous situations, such as requesting the player's character to "assume the party escort submission position", and found this style of approach to be well-suited to the game they wanted to create, ultimately leading to the creation of the GLaDOS character.&lt;ref name="gi portal hl" /&gt; GLaDOS was central to the plot, as Wolpaw notes "We designed the game to have a very clear beginning, middle, and end, and we wanted GLaDOS to go through a personality shift at each of these points."&lt;ref name="rbs wolpaw interview" /&gt; Wolpaw further describes the idea of using cake as the reward came about as "at the beginning of the ''Portal'' development process, we sat down as a group to decide what philosopher or school of philosophy our game would be based on. That was followed by about 15 minutes of silence and then someone mentioned that a lot of people like cake."&lt;ref name="gi portal hl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rbs wolpaw interview"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/?p=518 | title= RPS Interview: Valve's Erik Wolpaw | publisher = Rock, Paper, Shotgun | date = October 31, 2007 | accessdate = October 31, 2007 | first = John | last = Walker }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cake element along with additional messages given to the player in the behind-the-scenes areas were written and drawn by [[Kim Swift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolpinchefsky/2012/06/26/kim-swift-creator-of-portal-discusses-her-latest-game-quantum-conundrum/  | title = Kim Swift, Creator of 'Portal,' Discusses Her Latest Game, 'Quantum Conundrum' | first = Carol | last = Pinchefsky | date = June 26, 2012 | accessdate= June 26, 2012 | work = [[Forbes]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design===
[[File:Portalgame.jpg|thumb|right|A typical ''Portal'' test chamber, with both of the player's colored portals opened. The Weighted Companion Cube can also be seen. The clean, spartan look to the chambers was influenced by the film ''[[The Island (2005 film)|The Island]]''.]]
The austere settings in the game came about because testers spent too much time trying to complete the puzzles using decorative but non-functional elements. As a result, the setting was minimized to make the usable aspects of the puzzle easier to spot, using the clinical feel of the setting in the film ''[[The Island (2005 film)|The Island]]'' as reference.&lt;ref name="1up beyond the box" /&gt; While there were plans for a third area, an office space, to be included after the test chambers and the maintenance areas, the team ran out of time to include it.&lt;ref name="1up beyond the box" /&gt; They also dropped the introduction of the Rat Man, a character who left the messages in the maintenance areas, to avoid creating too much narrative for the game,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/359961/portal-devs-reveal-the-glados-that-never-was-inspiration-behind-weighted-companion-cube | title = Portal Devs Reveal the GLaDOS That Never Was, Inspiration Behind Weighted Companion Cube | publisher = Kotaku | date = February 23, 2008 | accessdate = February 26, 2008 | first = Michael | last = McWhertor}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the character was developed further in a tie-in comic "Lab Rat", that ties ''Portal'' and ''Portal 2''{{'}}s story together.&lt;ref name="labrat part 1"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://comics.ign.com/articles/116/1160605p1.html | title = Portal 2: Lab Rat – Part 1 | first = Joey | last = Esposito | date = April 8, 2011 | accessdate = April 11, 2011 | publisher = IGN }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="labrat part 2"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://comics.ign.com/articles/116/1161043p1.html | title = Read Portal 2: Lab Rat – Part 2 | publisher = IGN | first = Joey | last = Esposito | date = April 11, 2011 | accessdate = April 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to project lead Kim Swift, the final battle with GLaDOS went through many iterations, including having the player chased by [[Goldfinger (film)|James Bond lasers]], which was partially applied to the turrets, [[Mortal Kombat|Portal Kombat]] where the player would have needed to redirect rockets while avoiding turret fire, and a chase sequence following a fleeing GLaDOS. Eventually, they found that playtesters enjoyed a rather simple puzzle with a countdown timer near the end; Swift noted, "Time pressure makes people think something is a lot more complicated than it really is", and Wolpaw admitted, "It was really cheap to make [the neurotoxin gas]" in order to simplify the dialogue during the battle.&lt;ref name="shacknews gdc08 interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/featuredarticle.x?id=784 |title=GDC 08: Portal Creators on Writing, Multiplayer, Government Interrogation Techniques |publisher=Shacknews |date=February 23, 2008 |accessdate=February 23, 2008 |first=Chris |last=Faylor |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814204025/http://www.shacknews.com/featuredarticle.x?id=784 |archivedate=August 14, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erik Wolpaw noted, "When we were still fishing around for the turret voice, Ellen did a sultry version. It didn't work for the turrets, but we liked it a lot, and so a slightly modified version of that became the model for GLaDOS's final incarnation."&lt;ref name="rbs wolpaw interview" /&gt; [[Mike Patton]] performed the growling and snarling voice of GLaDOS's final personality core, named the Anger Sphere.

The Weighted Companion Cube inspiration was from project lead Kim Swift with additional input from Wolpaw from reading some "declassified government interrogation thing" whereby "isolation leads subjects to begin to attach to inanimate objects";&lt;ref name="shacknews gdc08 interview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rbs wolpaw interview" /&gt; Swift commented, "We had a long level called Box Marathon; we wanted players to bring this box with them from the beginning to the end. But people would forget about the box, so we added dialogue, applied the heart to the cube, and continued to up the ante until people became attached to the box. Later on, we added the incineration idea. The artistic expression grew from the gameplay."&lt;ref name="1up beyond the box"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3165930 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20121206010935/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3165930 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = December 6, 2012 | title = Beyond the Box: Orange Box Afterthoughts | publisher = 1UP | date = February 6, 2008 | accessdate = February 14, 2008 | first = Shawn | last = Elliot }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolpaw further noted that the need to incinerate the Weighted Companion Cube came as a result of the final boss battle design; they recognized they had not introduced the idea of incineration necessary to complete the boss battle, and by training the player to do it with the Weighted Companion Cube, found the narrative "way stronger" with its "death".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4151/valves_writers_and_the_creative_.php?page=1 | title = Valve's Writers And The Creative Process | date = November 2, 2009 | accessdate= November 2, 2009 | first = Kris | last = Graff | publisher = [[Gamasutra]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swift noted that any similarities to psychological situations in the [[Milgram experiment]] or ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' are happenstance.&lt;ref name="1up beyond the box" /&gt;

The portal gun's full name, Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, can be abbreviated as ASHPD, which resembles a shortening of the name Adrian Shephard, the protagonist of ''[[Half-Life: Opposing Force]]''. This similarity was noticed by fans before the game's release; as a result, the team placed a [[Red herring (plot device)|red herring]] in the game by having the letters of Adrian Shephard highlighted on keyboards found within the game.&lt;ref name="1up beyond the box" /&gt; According to Kim Swift, the cake is a Black Forest cake that she thought looked the best at the nearby Regent Bakery and Café in [[Redmond, Washington|Redmond]], Washington, and, as an Easter egg within the game, its recipe is scattered among various screens showing lines of binary code.&lt;ref name="german chocolate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gi portal cake"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2010/03/31/Let-There-Be-Cake.aspx | title = Let There Be Cake | first = Meagan | last = VanBurkleo | work = [[Game Informer]] | date = March 31, 2010 | accessdate = March 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Regent Bakery has stated that since the release of the game, its Black Forest cake has been one of its more popular items.&lt;ref name="gi portal cake" /&gt;

===Soundtrack===
Most of the game's soundtrack is non-lyrical [[ambient music]] composed by [[Kelly Bailey (composer)|Kelly Bailey]] and [[Mike Morasky]], somewhat dark and mysterious to match the mood of the environments. The closing credits song, "[[Still Alive (song)|Still Alive]]", was written by [[Jonathan Coulton]] and sung by Ellen McLain (a classically trained [[opera]]tic [[soprano]]) as the GLaDOS character. A brief instrumental version of "Still Alive" is played in an uptempo Latin style over radios in-game. Wolpaw notes that Coulton was invited to Valve a year before the release of ''Portal'', though it was not yet clear where Coulton would contribute. "Once Kim [Swift] and I met with him, it quickly became apparent that he had the perfect sensibility to write a song for GLaDOS."&lt;ref name="portal the skinny"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.jonathancoulton.com/2007/10/15/portal-the-skinny/ | title = Portal: The Skinny | first = Jonathan | last = Coulton | publisher = Jonathan Coulton's blog | date = October 15, 2007 | accessdate = November 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rbs wolpaw interview" /&gt; The use of the song over the closing credits was based on a similar concept from the game ''[[God Hand (video game)|God Hand]]'', one of Wolpaw's favorite titles.&lt;ref name="gi pax12"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2012/09/01/chell-almost-married-a-turret-in-portal-2.aspx | title=  Chell Almost Married A Turret In Portal 2 | work = [[Game Informer]] | first = Tim | last = Turi | date  =September 1, 2012 | accessdate = September 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was released as a free downloadable song for the [[music video game]] ''[[Rock Band (video game)|Rock Band]]'' on April 1, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rockband.com/rockers_blog_entry/hmxsean/216671?redir=1 | title = Valve Party at GDC + Special Preview of an Upcoming DLC Song | first = Sean | last = Baptiste | publisher = Harmonix | date = February 21, 2008 | accessdate = February 21, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080225131915/http://www.rockband.com/rockers_blog_entry/hmxsean/216671?redir=1 |archivedate = February 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Still Alive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockband.com/forums/showthread.php?t=40092 |title=DLC April 1st!

==Release==
In January 2008, Valve released a special demo version titled ''Portal: The First Slice'', free for any Steam user using [[Nvidia]] graphics hardware as part of a collaboration between the two companies.&lt;ref name="Steam News 1398"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://store.steampowered.com/news/1398/ | title = Valve and NVIDIA Offer Portal: First Slice Free to GeForce Users | accessdate = August 11, 2010 | date = January 9, 2008 | work = [[Steam (software)|Steam]] | publisher = [[Valve Corporation|Valve]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also comes packaged with ''[[Half-Life 2: Deathmatch]]'', ''[[Peggle Extreme]]'', and ''[[Half-Life 2: Lost Coast]]''. The demo includes test chambers 00 to 10 (eleven in total).

''Portal'' was first released as part of ''[[The Orange Box]]'' for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Xbox 360]] on October 10, 2007,&lt;ref name="pcrelease"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/halflife2theorangebox?q=The%20Orange%20Box |title = The Orange Box (PC)|publisher = Metacritic | accessdate = December 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="360release"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbox360/halflife2theorangebox?q=The%20Orange%20Box|title=The Orange Box (Xbox 360)|publisher = Metacritic | accessdate = December 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for the [[PlayStation 3]] on December 11, 2007.&lt;ref name="ps3release"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/ps3/halflife2theorangebox?q=The%20Orange%20Box|title=The Orange Box (PS3)|publisher = Metacritic | accessdate = February 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Windows version of the game is also available for download separately through Valve's content delivery system, Steam,&lt;ref name="Steam App 400"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://store.steampowered.com/app/400/ | title = Portal | accessdate = August 11, 2010 | work = [[Steam (software)|Steam]] | publisher = [[Valve Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was released as a standalone [[retail]] product on April 9, 2008.&lt;ref name="joystiq orange split"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.joystiq.com/2008/03/05/individual-orange-box-games-hit-retail-april-9/ | title = Individual Orange Box games hit retail April 9 | date = March 6, 2008 | accessdate = March 6, 2008 | work = [[Joystiq]] | first = Ludwig | last = Kiestmann }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to ''Portal'', the ''Box'' also included ''Half-Life 2'' and its two add-on episodes, as well as ''[[Team Fortress 2]]''. ''Portal''{{'}}s inclusion within the ''Box'' was considered an experiment by Valve; having no idea of the success of ''Portal'', the ''Box'' provided it a "safety net" via means of these other games. ''Portal'' was kept to a modest length in case the game did not go over well with players.&lt;ref name="gi p2 reveal" /&gt; Since then, a standalone version of the game was released for Microsoft Windows users.

''Portal'' was the first Valve-developed game to be added to the OS X-compatible list of games available on the launch of the Steam client for Mac on May 12, 2010,&lt;ref name="Hollister"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.engadget.com/2010/04/29/steam-for-mac-opens-a-portal-to-may-12-steps-through/ | title = Steam for Mac Opens a Portal to May 12, steps through| publisher = Engadget | first = Sean | last = Hollister | date =April 29, 2010 | accessdate = May 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; supporting Steam Play, in which players that had bought the game either on a Macintosh or Windows computer could also play it on the alternate system.

''Portal'' received critical acclaim, often earning more praise than either ''Half-Life 2: Episode Two'' or ''Team Fortress 2'', two titles also included in ''The Orange Box''. It was praised for its unique gameplay and [[Black comedy|dark]], [[deadpan]] humor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.g4tv.com/games/xbox-360/38752/the-orange-box/ |last =Keil |first = Matt |title=G4 Review&amp;nbsp;— The Orange Box |accessdate=October 19, 2007 |publisher=[[G4tv.com|G4TV]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eurogamer]] cited that "the way the game progresses from being a simple set of perfunctory tasks to a full-on part of the ''Half-Life'' story is absolute genius",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=85044 | title = The Orange Box | first = Kristen | last = Reed | publisher = Eurogamer | date = October 10, 2007 | accessdate = February 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[GameSpy]] noted, "What ''Portal'' lacks in length, it more than makes up for in exhilaration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://xbox360.gamespy.com/xbox-360/half-life-2/826174p1.html | title = The Orange Box (X360) | date = October 10, 2007 | accessdate = February 14, 2008 | publisher = GameSpy | first = Sterline | last = McGarvey }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was criticized for sparse environments, and both criticized and praised for its short length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/825/825987p2.html |last =Adams |first = Dan |title=IGN: Portal Review |accessdate=October 19, 2007 |publisher=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aggregate reviews for the stand-alone PC version of ''Portal'' gave the game a 90/100 through 28&amp;nbsp;reviews on [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="metacritic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/portal |title=Portal (pc: 2007): Reviews |accessdate=October 22, 2007 |publisher=[[Metacritic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Valve stated that ''Portal'' had sold more than four million copies through the retail versions, including the standalone game and ''The Orange Box'', and from the Xbox Live Arcade version.&lt;ref name="4million"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/34204/Portal_Sells_4_Million_Excluding_Steam_Sales.php | title = Portal Sells 4 Million Excluding Steam Sale | first = Mike | last = Rose | date = April 20, 2011 | accessdate = April 20, 2011 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ben Croshaw]] of ''[[Zero Punctuation]]'' gave the game the only entirely positive review in the show's history, calling it "the most fun you'll have with your PC until they invent a force-feedback codpiece". Croshaw went on to say: "I went in expecting a slew of interesting portal-based puzzles and that's exactly what I got, but what I wasn't expecting was some of the funniest pitch black humor I've ever heard in a game". He states that, while the game was short, the two- to three-hour length of the game was perfect as the game did not outstay its welcome, and called the ending "balls-tighteningly fantastic", while praising the game as "absolutely sublime from start to finish" (adding that he would jam forks in his eyes if he ever praised a game so highly ever again).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/10-The-Orange-Box|title=The Orange Box - Zero Punctuation Video Gallery - The Escapist|work=The Escapist|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for GameSetWatch in 2009, columnist Daniel Johnson pointed out similarities between ''Portal'' and [[Erving Goffman]]'s essay on [[Dramaturgy (sociology)|dramaturgy]], ''[[The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life]]'', which equates one's persona to the front and back stage areas of a theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2009/06/column_lingua_franca_portal_an.php | title = Column: 'Lingua Franca'&amp;nbsp;– Portal and the Deconstruction of the Institution | publisher = GameSetWatch | date = June 1, 2009 | accessdate = June 1, 2009 | first = Daniel | last = Johnson }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was also made part of the required course material among other classical and contemporary works, including Goffman's work, for a freshman course "devoted to engaging students with fundamental questions of humanity from multiple perspectives and fostering a sense of community" for [[Wabash College]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/102951-College-Professor-Requires-Students-to-Study-Portal | title = College Professor Requires Students to Study Portal | first= Tom | last=Goldman | publisher = [[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] | date = August 22, 2010 | accessdate = August 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.giantbomb.com/news/intro-to-glados-101-a-professors-decision-to-teach-portal/3206/ | title = Intro to GLaDOS 101: A Professor's Decision to Teach Portal | first = Patrick | last = Klepek | date = May 18, 2011 | accessdate = May 18, 2011 | publisher = [[Giant Bomb]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Portal'' has also been cited as a strong example of [[instructional scaffolding]] that can be adapted for more academic learning situations, as the player, through careful design of levels by Valve, is first hand-held in solving simple puzzles with many hints at the correct solution, but this support is slowly removed as the player progresses in the game, and completely removed when the player reaches the second half of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = A Portal to Student Learning: What Instruction Librarians can Learn from Video Game Design | first = Nicholas | last = Schiller | year = 2008 | url=http://www.mendeley.com/research/portal-student-learning-instruction-librarians-learn-video-game-design/ | accessdate = June 25, 2009 |journal=[[Reference Services Review]]|volume=36|issue=4|pages=351–365|doi=10.1108/00907320810920333}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]'s Hamish Todd considered ''Portal'' as an exemplary means of game design by demonstrating a series of chambers after the player has obtained the portal gun that gently introduce the concept of flinging without any explicit instructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/09/20/untold-riches-an-analysis-of-portals-expressive-level-design/ | title = Untold Riches: An Analysis Of Portal’s Level Design | first = Hamish | last = Todd | date = September 20, 2013 | accessdate = September 20, 2013 | publisher = [[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Portal'' was exhibited at the Smithsonian Art Exhibition in America from February 14 through September 30, 2012.

Wolpaw noted they did not expect certain elements of the game to be as popular as they were, while other elements they had expected to become fads were ignored, such as a giant hoop that rolls on-screen during the final scene of the game that the team had named Hoopy.&lt;ref name="gi portal hl" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url  =  http://www.pcgamer.com/the-cake-is-a-liethe-life-and-death-of-portals-best-baked-meme/ | title = 'The cake is a lie'—the life and death of Portal's best baked meme | first =  James | last = Davenport | date = October 10, 2017 | accessdate = October 10, 2017 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Mod (computer gaming)|modding]] community has developed around ''Portal'', with users creating their own test chambers and other in-game modifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=178414 | title= Portal Maps Investigated | publisher = CVG | date = January 5, 2008 | accessdate = January 5, 2008 | first = Ed | last =Zitron }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thinkingwithportals.com/| title=Thinking With Portals | publisher = ThinkingWithPortals.com | accessdate = June 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group "We Create Stuff" created an [[Adobe Flash]] version of ''Portal'', titled ''Portal: The Flash Version'', just prior to release of ''The Orange Box''.

Swift stated that future ''Portal'' developments would depend on the community's reactions, saying, "We're still playing it by ear at this point, figuring out if we want to do multiplayer next, or ''Portal 2'', or release map packs."&lt;ref name="eurogamerfi" /&gt; Some rumors regarding a sequel arose due to casting calls for voice actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Casting call reveals Portal 2 details|publisher=Kotaku| url = http://kotaku.com/5014851/rumor-casting-call-reveals-portal-2-details|accessdate = July 18, 2008 | first = Luke | last = Plunkett | date=June 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=More details on Portal 2's bad guy|publisher=Kotaku| url = http://kotaku.com/5015122/more-details-on-portal-2s-bad-guy|accessdate = July 18, 2008 | first = Luke | last = Plunkett | date=June 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 10, 2010, ''Portal 2'' was officially announced for a release late in that year;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2010/03/portal-2-is-official-first-image-inside.ars | title = Portal 2 is official, first image inside | date = March 5, 2010 | accessdate = March 5, 2010 | first = Andrew | last = Webster | publisher = Ars Technica }}&lt;/ref&gt; the announcement was preceded by an [[alternate reality game]] based on unexpected patches made to ''Portal'' that contained cryptic messages in relation to ''Portal 2''{{'}}s announcement, including an update to the game, creating a different ending for the fate of Chell. The original game left her in a deserted car park after destroying GLaDOS, but the update involved Chell being dragged back into the facility by a "Party Escort Bot".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3836">'''Post-romanticism''' or '''Postromanticism''' refers to a range of cultural endeavors and attitudes emerging in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, after the period of [[Romanticism]].

[[Herman Melville]] and [[Thomas Carlyle]] are post-Romantic writers.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Milder, ''Exiled Royalties: Melville and the Life We Imagine'', New York: Oxford University Press US, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;41. {{ISBN|0-19-514232-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flaubert]]'s ''[[Madame Bovary]]'' is a post-Romantic novel.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Heath, ''Gustave Flaubert, Madame Bovary'', Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;13. {{ISBN|0-521-31483-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The period of post-romanticism in poetry is defined as the late nineteenth century, but includes the poetry of [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]]&lt;ref&gt;Sybille Baumback and others, "A History of British Poetry", Trier: WVT. {{ISBN|978-3-86821-578-6}}. Section 19: Poetic Genres in the Victorian Age I: Letitia Elizabeth Landon’s and Alfred Lord Tennyson’s Post-Romantic Verse Narratives by Anne-Julia Zwierlein.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bradford, ''A Linguistic History of English Poetry'', New York: Routledge, 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;134. {{ISBN|0-415-07057-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-Romanticism in music ==
Post-romanticism in [[music]] referred to [[romantic music|Romantic]] composers who would use [[musical form|forms]] that were found typically in the [[Classical music|Classical]] and [[Baroque music|Baroque]] while still retaining aspects of the Romantic era. Among the most well known post-Romantic composers are [[Puccini|Giacomo Puccini]] and [[Sergei Rachmaninov]]. [[Arthur Berger (composer)|Arthur Berger]]&lt;!--in an interview with Virgil Thomson--&gt; describes the mysticism of [[La Jeune France]] as post-Romanticism rather than [[Neoromanticism (music)|neo-Romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Virgil Thomson,. ''Virgil Thomson: A Reader: Selected Writings, 1924-1984'', edited by Richard Kostelanetz, New York: Routledge, 2002p.&amp;nbsp;268. {{ISBN|0-415-93795-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hans Pfitzner]] also wrote post-Romantic works such as his opera ''Palestrina''.

Quite unlike Late Romantic composers such as [[Richard Strauss]] and [[Alexander Scriabin]], the composers of the Post-Romantic created music that would use either or both traditional form and [[harmony]]. [[Béla Bartók]], for example, "in such Strauss-influenced works as ''[[Duke Bluebeard's Castle]]''," may be described as having still used "[[consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] ['such intervals as fourths and sevenths'] for purposes of post-Romantic expression, not simply [always] as an appeal to the primal art of sound"—unlike [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and Strauss himself, who both believed in "a mythology of historical progress in Western music".&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Albright,. ''Modernism and Music: An Anthology of Sources'',  Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2004pp.&amp;nbsp;243-44. {{ISBN|0-226-01267-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[academic publishing]], a '''preprint''' is a version of a scholarly or [[scientific paper]] that precedes formal peer review and publication in a [[peer review|peer-review]]ed scholarly or [[scientific journal]]. The preprint may be available, often as a non-typeset version available free, before and/or after a paper is published in a journal.

==Role==
Publication of manuscripts in a peer-reviewed journal often takes weeks, months or even years from the time of initial submission, owing to the time required by editors and reviewers to evaluate and critique manuscripts, and the time required by authors to address critiques. The need to quickly circulate current results within a scholarly community has led researchers to distribute documents known as preprints, which are manuscripts that have yet to undergo [[peer review]]. They may be considered as [[grey literature]]. The immediate distribution of preprints allows authors to receive early feedback from their peers, which may be helpful in revising and preparing articles for submission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.plos.org/absolutely-maybe/2016/05/01/breaking-down-pros-and-cons-of-preprints-in-biomedicine/|title=Breaking Down Pros and Cons of Preprints in Biomedicine |date=2016-05-01|work=Absolutely Maybe|access-date=2018-01-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1991, preprints have increasingly been distributed electronically on the [[Internet]], rather than as paper copies. This has given rise to massive preprint databases such as [[arXiv.org]] and to [[institutional repository|institutional repositories]].

In some journals, posting preprints may disqualify the research from submission for publication due to the [[Ingelfinger rule|Ingelfinger Rule]]. The majority of publishers however do allow work to be published to preprint servers before submission while others do not and are evaluated on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21694990-old-fashioned-ways-reporting-new-discoveries-are-holding-back-medical-research|title = Taking the online medicine|newspaper = The Economist|issn = 0013-0613|access-date=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, several new preprint servers were proposed by [[CrossRef|Crossref]], [[Center for Open Science|Centre for Open Science]] and ASAPbio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crossref.org/blog/getting-ready-to-run-with-preprints-any-day-now/|title=Getting ready to run with preprints, any day now |date=2016-08-16 |website=Crossref Blog |access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://asapbio.org/summary-of-a-central-preprint-service-model|title=Creation of a Central Preprint Service for the Life Sciences |website=asapbio.org |publisher=ASAPbio |access-date=2016-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/library-babel-fish/acceleration-open-access|title=The Acceleration of Open Access |website=Inside Higher Ed |access-date=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, the [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]] announced that they will now be actively supporting preprints with effect from April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mrc.ukri.org/news/browse/the-mrc-supports-preprints/ |title=The MRC supports preprints |publisher=Medical Research Council |date=2017-01-03|website=www.mrc.ac.uk|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in January 2017, [[Wellcome Trust]] stated that they will now accept preprints in grant applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wellcome.ac.uk/news/we-now-accept-preprints-grant-applications|title=We now accept preprints in grant applications |publisher=Wellcome|website=wellcome.ac.uk|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017, a coalition of scientists and biomedical funding bodies including the [[National Institutes of Health]], the Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust launched a proposal for a central site for life-sciences preprints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Callaway |first=Ewen |title=Heavyweight funders back central site for life-sciences preprints|url=http://www.nature.com/news/heavyweight-funders-back-central-site-for-life-sciences-preprints-1.21466?WT.mc_id=TWT_NatureNews|journal=Nature|language=en|doi=10.1038/nature.2017.21466|bibcode=2017Natur.542..283C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://asapbio.org/principles|title=Principles for establishing a Central Service for Preprints: a statement from a consortium of funders {{!}} ASAPbio|website=asapbio.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://asapbio.org/asapbio-newsletter-vol-7|title=ASAPbio newsletter vol 7 – Funders sign onto principles for preprint development, RFA released, scientific society town hall {{!}} ASAPbio|website=asapbio.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017, [[SciELO]] announced plans to set up a preprints server – SciELO Preprints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.scielo.org/en/2017/02/22/scielo-preprints-on-the-way/#.WK2Q6jsrI2w|title=SciELO Preprints on the way |date=2017-02-22|newspaper=SciELO in Perspective|access-date=2017-02-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017, the National Institutes for Health issued a new policy encouraging research preprint submissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-17-050.html|title=NOT-OD-17-050: Reporting Preprints and Other Interim Research Products|website=grants.nih.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/03/nih-enables-investigators-include-draft-preprints-grant-proposals |title=NIH enables investigators to include draft preprints in grant proposals|date=2017-03-24|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2017-03-27 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2017, Center for Open Science announced that it will be launching six new preprint archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://cos.io/blog/public-goods-infrastructure-preprints-and-innovation-scholarly-communication/|title=Public Goods Infrastructure for Preprints and Innovation in Scholarly Communication|website=cos.io|language=en|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stages of printing===
While a preprint is an article that has not yet undergone peer review, a [[postprint]] is an article which has been peer reviewed in preparation for publication in a journal. Both the preprint and postprint may differ from the final published version of an article. Preprints and postprints together are referred to as e-prints or [[eprint]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.eprints.org/openaccess/self-faq/#What-is-Eprint Self-archiving FAQ]". EPrints.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word [[reprint]] refers to hard copies of papers that have already been published; reprints can be produced by the journal publisher, but can also be generated from digital versions (for example, from an electronic database of peer-reviewed journals), or from eprints [[self-archiving|self-archived]] by their authors in their institutional repositories.

===Tenure and promotion===
In academia, preprints are not likely to be weighed heavily when a scholar is evaluated for tenure or promotion, unless the preprint becomes the basis for a peer-reviewed publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Callaway|first=Ewen|last2=Powell|first2=Kendall|date=2016-02-18|title=Biologists urged to hug a preprint|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/530265a|journal=Nature|volume=530|issue=7590|pages=265–265|doi=10.1038/530265a|bibcode=2016Natur.530..265C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Servers by field ==
=== General ===
[[Authorea]] was launched in 2012 as a collaborative writing platform used by researchers to write, cite, collaborate, host and post their articles. The site is the only preprint server that displays manuscripts as HTML with interactive figures and hosted data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.authorea.com/users/8850/articles/155312-introducing-the-21st-century-preprint-html-versioned-citable-data-rich|title=Introducing the 21st-century preprint: HTML, versioned, citable, data-rich.|last=|first=|date=|website=Authorea|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''PeerJ PrePrints'' is a free preprint server operated by ''[[PeerJ]]''. Articles submitted undergo a basic screening process but are not peer-reviewed. Commenting is allowed by any registered user, and download and pageview data are supplied. All articles are published with a [[Creative Commons license|CC-BY license]]. As of September 2016, 2,439 articles have been made available.&lt;ref&gt;http://peerj.com/preprints&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zenodo]] is a repository for research data that has been used also as preprint repository, because it offers document preview and a [[Digital object identifier|DOI number]] for the submitted document. [[MDPI]] launched an additional preprint server in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.preprints.org/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.mdpi.com/2016/07/28/introducing-preprints-a-multidisciplinary-open-access-preprint-platform/|title=Introducing Preprints: A Multidisciplinary Open Access Preprint Platform|access-date=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Library and information science ===
There are two servers for LIS and allied fields: [[E-LIS|Eprints in Library and Information Science]] (e-LIS) and the LIS Scholarship Archive (LISSA). e-LIS was launched in 2003, and is an international [[open access]] [[Disciplinary repository|repository]] for academic papers in [[Library and Information Science]] (LIS), run by volunteers. LISSA was launched in 2017 as an open access repository for all materials created by those in LIS and allied fields, including work that happens outside the traditional realms of academia, such as oral histories, community works, code, data, and manuscripts. It is run by members of the library and archives community, and their technology partner, the Center for Open Science, using the [[Open Science Framework]] to host materials.

=== Physical sciences ===
The e-print archive [[arXiv]] (pronounced "archive") is one of the best-known preprint servers. It was created by [[Paul Ginsparg]] in 1991 at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] for the purpose of distributing theoretical [[high-energy physics]] preprints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nature.com/news/the-arxiv-preprint-server-hits-1-million-articles-1.16643|title=The arXiv preprint server hits 1 million articles|date=December 30, 2014|newspaper=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|quote=|access-date=2015-09-07|author=Richard Van Noorden}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, arXiv.org moved to [[Cornell University]] and now encompasses the fields of physics, mathematics, [[computer science]], [[quantitative biology]], [[quantitative finance]], [[statistics]]. Within the field of high-energy physics, the posting of preprints on arXiv is so common that many peer-reviewed journals allow [[Electronic submission|submission of papers]] from arXiv directly, using the arXiv e-print number.

In some branches of physics, the arXiv database may serve as a focal point for the many criticisms made of the peer review process and [[peer-reviewed journals]].  In his column in  ''[[Physics Today]]'', April 1992, [[David Mermin]] described Ginsparg's creation as potentially "[[string theory]]'s greatest contribution to science". About 8,000 preprints per month are uploaded to arXiv as of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21694990-old-fashioned-ways-reporting-new-discoveries-are-holding-back-medical-research|title=Taking the online medicine|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An engineering preprint server, [[engrXiv]], was launched in 2016 by the Center for Open Science and administrated by the [[University of Wisconsin–Stout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.engrxiv.org/2016/07/announcement|title=engrXiv Blog {{!}} Announcing engrXiv, the eprint server for engineering|website=blog.engrxiv.org|access-date=2016-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst under development, it used a temporary email deposit system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://osf.io/view/engrxiv/|title=OSF {{!}} Temporary Home of engrXiv Presentations|website=osf.io|access-date=2016-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 2017, the official home for engrXiv went live after the web interface was launched in December 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.engrxiv.org/2016/12/engrxiv-is-here|title=engrXiv Blog|website=blog.engrxiv.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The server [[viXra]] was established in 2009 for authors who are excluded from arXiv.org and other repositories due to submission filtering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Luis Reyes-Galindo|title=Automating the Horae: Boundary-work in the age of computers|journal=Social Studies of Science|date=2016|volume=46|issue=4|pages=586–606|doi=10.1177/0306312716642317|arxiv=1603.03824}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Computer science ===
The ability to distribute manuscripts as preprints has had a great impact on computer science, particularly in the way that scientific research is disseminated in that field (see [[CiteSeer]]). The [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] movement has tended to focus on distributed institutional collections of research, global harvesting, and aggregation through [[Search engine (computing)|search engine]]s and [[Gateway (web page)|gateway]]s such as [[OAIster]], rather than a global discipline base such as arXiv. ''E-prints'' can now refer to any electronic form of a scholarly or scientific publication, including journal articles, conference papers, research theses or dissertations, because these usually are found in multidisciplinary collections, called open access repositories, or eprints archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graziotin|first=Daniel|last2=Wang|first2=Xiaofeng|last3=Abrahamsson|first3=Pekka|date=2014|title=A framework for systematic analysis of open access journals and its application in software engineering and information systems|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-014-1278-7|journal=Scientometrics|volume=101|issue=3|pages=1627–1656|doi=10.1007/s11192-014-1278-7|arxiv=1308.2597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biological and chemical sciences ===
The biological sciences have lagged behind the physical sciences in their use of preprints. Based on the success of arXiv, [[bioRxiv]] was introduced in 2013, operated by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21694990-old-fashioned-ways-reporting-new-discoveries-are-holding-back-medical-research|title=Taking the online medicine|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biorxiv.org/content/early/recent|title=All Articles {{!}} bioRxiv|last=|first=|date=|website=biorxiv.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therapoid Preprint was launched in 2017 by Open Therapeutics,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://therapoid.net/en/preprint/manuscript-21/|title=A philosophy for Opening Biotechnology Collaboration for Therapeutics - PrePrint Service {{!}} Open Therapeutics|last=|first=|date=|website=therapoid.net|language=en|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and ChemRxiv was announced in 2016 hosted by the [[American Chemical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cen.acs.org/articles/94/web/2016/08/ACS-launches-chemistry-preprint-server.html|title=ACS launches chemistry preprint server {{!}} Chemical &amp; Engineering News|last=Widener|first=Andrea|website=cen.acs.org|access-date=2016-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, it was confirmed that ChemRxiv will be powered by [[figshare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchinformation.info/product/chemrxiv|title=ChemRxiv {{!}} Research Information|website=www.researchinformation.info|language=en|access-date=2017-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Articles undergo basic screening for offensive and/or non-scientific content but do not undergo a peer review process.&lt;ref&gt;http://biorxiv.org/about-biorxiv&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2007–2012 [[Nature Publishing Group]] ran their own preprint server, ''[[Nature Precedings]].'' It hosted manuscripts, posters, and unpublished observations.

[[ASAPbio]] (Accelerating Science and Publication in biology) is "a scientist-driven initiative to promote innovation and transparency in life sciences communication" through the use of preprints.&lt;ref name="about-asapbio"&gt;{{cite web |title=About ASAPbio |url=http://asapbio.org/about-2 |publisher=ASAPbio |accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social science and humanities ===
One of the earlier preprint servers is PhilSci-Archive, launched in 2001 for all subfields of Philosophy of Science, hosted by the [[D-Scribe Digital Publishing|University Library System at the University of Pittsburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/history.html|title=History|last=|first=|date=|website=PhilSci-Archive|publisher=|access-date=August 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An open archive of the social sciences. SocArXiv was formed in July 2016 by a group of sociologists, members of the academic library community, and their technology partner, the Center for Open Science, using the Open Science Framework. It is administratively housed at the [[University of Maryland]] and directed by [[Philip N. Cohen|Philip Cohen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://socopen.org/2016/07/09/announcing-the-development-of-socarxiv-an-open-social-science-archive/|title=Announcing the development of SocArXiv|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; SocArXiv officially launched in December 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://socopen.org/2016/12/07/socarxiv-launches-brings-social-science-out-into-the-open/|title=SocArXiv launches, brings sociology and social science into the open, with new grant support|last=Cohen|first=Philip N.|date=2016-12-07|website=SocOpen: Home of SocArXiv|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://socopen.org/2016/12/10/new-site-up-here-are-our-most-downloaded-papers/|title=New site up: Here are our most downloaded papers|last=epopp|first=Author|date=2016-12-10|website=SocOpen: Home of SocArXiv|access-date=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frequently asked questions about SocArXiv.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://socopen.org/frequently-asked-questions/|title=FAQ|last=|first=|date=2017-03-31|work=SocOpen: Home of SocArXiv|access-date=2017-04-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PsyArXiv is a similar preprint service for the psychological sciences which launched in 2016 by the [http://improvingpsych.org/ Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science] and the Center for Open Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://osf.io/view/psyarxiv/|title=OSF {{!}} Temporary Home of PsyArXiv Presentations|website=osf.io|access-date=2016-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.psyarxiv.com/psyarxiv/2016/09/19/introducing-psyarxiv/|title=Introducing PsyArXiv: a preprint service for psychological science – PsyArXiv Blog|date=2016-09-19|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.psyarxiv.com/psyarxiv/2016/12/08/psyarxiv-press-release/|title=Introducing PsyArXiv: Psychology's dedicated open access digital archive – PsyArXiv Blog|date=2016-12-08|newspaper=PsyArXiv Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Social Science Research Network]] is a repository for both working papers and accepted papers, which shows download and citation data within the site for each stored paper. In May 2016, SSRN was acquired by [[Elsevier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.elsevier.com/connect/ssrn-the-leading-social-science-and-humanities-repository-and-online-community-joins-elsevier|title=SSRN—the leading social science and humanities repository and online community—joins Elsevier|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Real Estate Elevated''' (formerly known as '''Success Path''') is an [[educational program]] that provides [[real estate]] investment training and aims to help students find and flip houses in the United States.&lt;ref name="undercoverrealestate1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Name * Name First Name Last Name |url=http://undercoverrealestate.com/success-path-education-tarek-christina-el-moussa/ |title=Success Path Education &amp;#124; Review &amp;#124; Undercover Real Estate — Undercover Real Estate |publisher=Undercoverrealestate.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the premiere of the HGTV’s ‘''[[Flip or Flop]]''’ in 2013, the show’s hosts, Tarek and Christina El-Moussa, launched Real Estate Elevated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thearabdailynews.com/2016/01/14/flip-or-flop-hgtv-one-of-my-favorite-shows/ |title=Flip or Flop HGTV one of my favorite shows |publisher=The Arab Daily News |date=2016-01-14 |accessdate=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Comment |url=http://hubmesh.com/tarek-el-moussa-biography-real-estate-agent-from-flip-or-flop-tv-series.html |title=Tarek el Moussa - Biography - Real Estate Agent from Flip Or Flop TV series |publisher=Hubmesh.com |date=2016-09-03 |accessdate=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Charlinda Robinson |url=http://www.inquisitr.com/2585960/flip-or-flop-host-tarek-el-moussa-diagnosed-by-viewer-with-cancer-now-in-remission/ |title=Flip Or Flop Host Tarek El Moussa Diagnosed By Viewer With Cancer, Now In Remission |publisher=Inquisitr.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Tarek and Christina El-Moussa became involved in the real estate [[flipping]] business shortly after the 2008 recession. They downsized their lifestyle so that they could begin investing in this new venture and they honed their skills over the years that followed.&lt;ref name="realtytoday1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realtytoday.com/articles/75416/20160124/tarek-christina-el-moussa-net-worth-hgtvs-flip-flop-hosts.htm |title=Tarek and Christina El Moussa Net Worth: HGTV's 'Flip or Flop' Hosts Share House Flipping Success : News |publisher=Realty Today |date=2016-01-24 |accessdate=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When they were approached by HGTV in 2013, house flipping was not yet mainstream.&lt;ref name="realtytoday1"/&gt; The show is now on its sixth season and the couple shares their knowledge and unique strategies through their Real Estate Elevated seminars that are held all over the United States.&lt;ref name="undercoverrealestate1"/&gt; The Real Estate Elevated program was created to give individuals the tools necessary to start their own real estate flipping businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reviewopedia.com/successpath-reviews |title=SuccessPath Reviews - Legit or Scam? |publisher=Reviewopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspiring investors are invited to attend a free seminar before deciding on an education plan that suits their individual goals.&lt;ref name="undercoverrealestate1"/&gt;

===Origins===
Tarek and Christina El Moussa, like many in the U.S., suffered a significant financial crisis back in 2008. Their income dried up, and they were forced to downsize their home, their car, and their job. They struggled to regain the financial freedom they had previously enjoyed for a few years. Then they discovered house flipping. They flipped their first property in 2010, and never looked back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Real estate |url=https://www.theadvisory.co.uk/sell-house-fast/ |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://successpatheducation.com/about/|title=About - Success Path Education|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2012, they had been signed by HGTV to film a new reality show: ''Flip or Flop''. The added publicity shed light on their growing expertise, and they started sharing their hard-won industry knowledge with other real estate investors. Their desire to share their method with those who want to achieve the same financial security as they did led to the founding of Real Estate Elevated—an education system that teaches would-be flippers how to be successful.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanrobinson/2017/09/11/new-side-hustle-prepare-make-sacrifices/#24643cad5e27|title=New To The Side Hustle? Prepare To Make These 5 Sacrifices|first=Ryan|last=Robinson|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Since then, Tarek and Christina have trained thousands of real estate experts, many of whom now train others in the Real Estate Elevated program.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Concept==
In the last few decades, flipping houses has become a popular way to earn money, both as supplemental income, and as a primary occupation. Unlike many sources of income, however, there’s significant risk involved in the process. An inexperienced flipper stands to suffer significant losses on their investment if they make the wrong mistakes—a fact that can frequently serve as a barrier to entry for those wanting to join the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/06/02/house-flipping-sales/|title=House Flipping Is Back|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Real Estate Elevated helps new and less experienced flippers to minimize the risk involved by closing the knowledge gap. Real estate industry experts teach methods and tactics pioneered and refined by Tarek and Christina El Moussa, sharing their secrets for success to up-and-coming entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc15.com/lifestyle/sonoran-living/sl-sponsors/success-path-provides-quality-real-estate-investment-education|title=Success Path provides quality real estate investment education|date=17 March 2017|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The training is provided in several different formats. It starts with a free two-and-a-half hour renovation training event that discusses the basics. The next step is a three day “Real Estate Accelerator Workshop” that goes into deeper detail on Real Estate Elevated’s methodologies. Beyond these primary trainings, they offer ongoing mentoring and coaching, including large events and one-on-one trainings.&lt;ref name="successpatheducation.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://successpatheducation.com/faq/|title=FAQ - Success Path Education|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The trainings focus on critical parts of the flipping process, including how to find properties, how to get financing, how to create cash flow, and how to do wholesale deals.&lt;ref name="successpatheducation.com"/&gt;

==Habitat for Humanity==
After the [[2016 Houston flooding|Houston flooding in 2016]], Real Estate Elevated donated $150,000 to [[Habitat for Humanity]], an organization that helps people in need buy or repair homes. So far, the money has helped rebuild three homes that were damaged during the storm in the Houston, Texas area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.inc.com/matthew-jones/how-to-draw-emotional-strength-during-times-of-tra.html?cid=sf01001&amp;sr_share=twitter|title=How to Draw Emotional Strength During Times of Tragedy|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Real Husbands of Hollywood''''' (abbreviated '''''RHOH''''') was an American [[reality television]] parody on [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] which debuted on January 15, 2013.&lt;ref name=info&gt;{{cite web|title="Real Husbands of Hollywood" and "Second Generation Wayans" to Premiere Tuesday, January 15 on BET|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2012/11/28/real-husbands-of-hollywood-and-second-generation-wayans-to-premiere-tuesday-january-15-on-bet-645515/20121128bet01/|publisher=thefutoncritic|accessdate=January 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The series was co-created by comedian Kevin Hart, and follows the daily lives of him and other married celebrities, each playing a fictionalized version of themselves, as they venture through their [[wikt:surreal|surreal]] life in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BET Networks Unveils New Programming at 2012 Upfront Presentation|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2012/04/12/bet-networks-unveils-new-programming-at-2012-upfront-presentation-999101/20120412bet01/|accessdate=January 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the initial cast include: [[Boris Kodjoe]], [[Nelly]], [[Duane Martin]], [[J.B. Smoove]], [[Nick Cannon]], Oliver (Hart's assistant, played by James Davis), and [[Robin Thicke]], who did not return for the second season due to his music career, though Hart has stated that the door is open for Thicke to return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Apr 7, 2013 |url=http://blackamericaweb.com/115037/video-kevin-hart-explains-why-robin-thicke-left-real-husbands/ |title=Kevin Hart Explains Why Robin Thicke Left 'Real Husbands' |publisher=Black America Web |date=2013-04-07 |accessdate=2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series is intentionally filmed in a style similar to [[Bravo (U.S. TV channel)|Bravo]]'s ''[[The Real Housewives]]''. Episodes often hinge on the "real" Kevin Hart's desperately unsuccessful attempts to climb Hollywood's celebrity social ladder (which always backfire in humiliating ways), and the character's barely-hidden jealousy of his more successful celebrity friends. A sneak peek was shown as a segment during the [[2012 BET Awards]] and the official promo was released in October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Berkshire |first=Geoff |title=BET's 'Real Husbands of Hollywood' with Nick Cannon, 'Second Generation Wayans' get January premieres |url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2012/11/bets-real-husbands-of-hollywood-with-nick-cannon-second-generation-wayans-get-january-premieres.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130210022/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2012/11/bets-real-husbands-of-hollywood-with-nick-cannon-second-generation-wayans-get-january-premieres.html |archivedate=November 30, 2012 |publisher=[[Zap2it]] |department=From Inside the Box (blog) |access-date=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Regional accreditation''' is the [[Higher education accreditation in the United States|educational accreditation]] of schools, colleges, and universities in the [[United States]] by one of seven regional accrediting agencies. Accreditation is a voluntary process by which colleges demonstrate to each other, and sometimes to employers and licensing agencies, that their credits and degrees meet minimum standards. It is the self-regulation of the higher education industry.

Each regional accreditor oversees the vast majority of public and private educational institutions, both [[university|not-for-profit]] and [[For-profit higher education in the United States|for-profit]], in its region. Their primary function is accreditation of post-secondary institutions, though there is a limited amount of accreditation of primary and secondary schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://manoa.hawaii.edu/ovcaa/distance_ed/pdf/statement_of_commitment.pdf Statement of Commitment by the Regional Accrediting Commissions for the Evaluation of Electronically Offered Degree and Certificate Programs], retrieved from [[University of Hawaii]] website, June 19, 2011. "The eight regional accrediting commissions assure the quality of the great majority of degree-granting institutions of higher learning in the United States." (Page i)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Finnegan, [http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ERB0610.pdf Aligning Information Technology with Academic Standards] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005044148/http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ERB0610.pdf |date=2011-10-05 }}, ''Educause Center for Applied Research Research Bulletin'', volume 2006, Issue 10, May 9, 2006. "Regional acceditors include among their membership nearly all community colleges and public and private colleges universities in the region that they serve." (Page 2)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janice M. Karlen, [http://www.academicleadership.org/article/ACCREDITATION_AND_ASSESSMENT_IN_DISTANCE_LEARNING Accreditation and Assessment in Distance Learning], ''Academic Leadership: The Online Journal'', Volume 1, Issue 4, Fall 2003 (November 2003). "Most institutions rely upon one of the eight regional accreditation organizations for their accreditation status."&lt;/ref&gt;

While it might seem that [[Higher education accreditation in the United States#National accreditors|national accreditation]] would be more important than regional accreditation, this is generally not the case. Regional accreditation is older, and with a few exceptions, more prestigious than national accreditation.&lt;ref name="Lechuga"&gt;Lechuga, Vicente (2005). ''The Changing Landscape of the Academic Profession''. New York: Routledge, [https://books.google.com/books?id=iRIfDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT48 p. 48.]&lt;/ref&gt; Most non-profit institutions are regionally accredited, while most for-profit colleges and universities are served primarily by national accrediting agencies.&lt;ref name="Lechuga"/&gt;

==List of regional accreditors==
The following are the seven active regional accrediting agencies for educational institutions in the United States:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chea.org/Directories/regional.asp Regional Accrediting Organizations 2010-2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831092348/http://www.chea.org/Directories/regional.asp |date=2009-08-31 }}, [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]], accessed June 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.k12.wa.us/certification/colleges/reg_accred.html Regionally Accredited Colleges/Universities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831235144/http://www.k12.wa.us/certification/colleges/reg_accred.html |date=2010-08-31 }}, State of Washington Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction, accessed June 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Middle States Commission on Higher Education]], formerly part of the [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]] - Postsecondary institutions in [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Delaware]], [[Maryland]], the [[District of Columbia]], [[Puerto Rico]], and the [[US Virgin Islands]]. Since 2006, the Middle States Association has been part of [[AdvancED]], which accredits only pre-college institutions.
* [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]] - Educational institutions in the six [[New England]] states ([[Connecticut]], [[Maine]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[Vermont]]).
* [[Higher Learning Commission]], formerly part of the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncahlc.org/About-the-Commission/about-hlc.html&lt;/ref&gt; - Educational institutions in [[Arkansas]], [[Arizona]], [[Colorado]], [[Iowa]], [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Kansas]], [[Michigan]], [[Minnesota]], [[Missouri]], [[North Dakota]], [[Nebraska]], [[New Mexico]], [[Ohio]], [[Oklahoma]], [[South Dakota]], [[Wisconsin]], [[West Virginia]], and [[Wyoming]]. Since 2006, the North Central Association has been part of AdvancED.
* [[Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities]] (NWCCU) for postsecondary institutions in [[Alaska]], [[Idaho]], [[Montana]], [[Nevada]], [[Oregon]], [[Utah]], and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. Since 2012, the [[Northwest Accreditation Commission]] for primary and secondary schools has been a division of AdvancED. 
* [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] - Educational institutions in [[Alabama]], [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Kentucky]], [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], [[Texas]] and [[Virginia]].
* [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]] - 4-year educational institutions in [[California]], [[Hawaii]], [[Guam]], [[American Samoa]], [[Federated States of Micronesia|Micronesia]], [[Palau]], and [[Northern Marianas Islands]], as well as schools for American children in [[Asia]].
* [[Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges]], formerly part of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges - 2-year educational institutions in [[California]], [[Hawaii]], [[Guam]], [[American Samoa]], [[Federated States of Micronesia|Micronesia]], [[Palau]], and [[Northern Marianas Islands]], as well as schools for American children in [[Asia]].

The seven organizations form the '''Council of Regional Accrediting Commissions''' (C-RAC).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.berkeleycitycollege.edu/accred/Assessment%20Guide%20-%20C-RAC.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Each regional accrediting commission's executive directors and commission chairs sit on C-RAC and periodically promulgate principles and guidelines which are followed by the regional commissions. Although the principles do not replace individual commission regulations, they provide a basis for assessing accreditation practice between regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.msche.org/publications/Regnlsl050208135331.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-09-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130418042953/http://www.msche.org/publications/Regnlsl050208135331.pdf# |archive-date=2013-04-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All regional agencies have accrediting authority for colleges and universities, 2-year, 4-year, or both. Some agencies also have accrediting authority over K-12 schools (primary and secondaryschools). Both the northwestern and mid-Atlantic regions divide responsibility between two separate accreditation agencies with one focusing on primary and secondary schools and the other focusing on postsecondary institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nwccu.org/About/History/NWCCU%20History.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819031731/http://www.nwccu.org/About/History/NWCCU%20History.htm |archivedate=2010-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.northwestaccreditation.org/our-history |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201034929/http://www.northwestaccreditation.org/our-history |archivedate=2012-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msche.org/?Nav1=ABOUT&amp;Nav2=FAQ&amp;Nav3=QUESTION04 |title=Frequently Asked Questions About the Middle States Association and the Middle States Commission on Higher Education |publisher=Middle States Commission on Higher Education |date=2015 |accessdate=December 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304053819/http://www.msche.org/?Nav1=ABOUT&amp;Nav2=FAQ&amp;Nav3=QUESTION04# |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the western region, there is a [[Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges|separate commission]] that accredits 2-year colleges.

==History==
The regional accrediting agencies were established in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in response to a perceived need for better articulation between secondary schools and higher education institutions (the school offered the courses the college needed applicants to have taken; this helped colleges and universities evaluate prospective students).&lt;ref name=Altbach&gt;Fred F. Harcleroad and Judith S. Eaton (2005), "The Hidden Hand: External Constituencies and their Impact," Chapter 9 in Philip G. Altbach, Robert Oliver Berdahl, and Patricia J. Gumport, editors, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0UoHIAeSKvAC&amp;pg=PA263 American higher education in the twenty-first century: social, political, and economic challenges]. Page 263. JHU Press. {{ISBN|0-8018-8035-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8018-8035-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NChistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northcentralassociation.org/HISTORY+OF+THE+NORTH+CENTRAL+ASSOCIATION.htm|title=The Higher Learning Commission|author=|date=|website=www.northcentralassociation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New England Association was formed in 1885 by a group of schoolmasters of secondary schools. The Middle States Association formed in 1887.&lt;ref name=Altbach/&gt; The faculty of [[Vanderbilt University]] led the establishment of the Southern Association in 1895, and the North Central Association was organized the same year at a meeting of 36 administrators of [[Midwestern United States|midwestern]] schools, colleges, and universities.&lt;ref name=Altbach/&gt;&lt;ref name=NChistory/&gt; The Northwest Association of Secondary and Higher Schools (predecessor of the two organizations that now serve that region) was formed in 1917 and the Western Association was founded in 1923.&lt;ref name=Altbach/&gt;

Initially the main focus of the organizations was on accreditation of secondary schools and establishment of uniform college entrance requirements.&lt;ref name=Altbach/&gt;&lt;ref name=NChistory/&gt; Regional accreditation replaced other methods, such as the [[Association of American Universities]]'s "AAU Accepted List" (1914-1948).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.aau.edu/association-american-universities-century-service-higher-education-1900-2000 |title=The Association of American Universities: A Century of Service to Higher Education 1900-2000 | publisher=Association of American Universities |language=en |access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accreditation first emerged as a regional rather than national activity because it typically involved site visits, and the fastest transportation available at the time was the railroad.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

==Regional accreditation vs. national accreditation==
Regionally accredited institutions are usually academically oriented, state-owned or non-profit private institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Judith S. Eaton, [http://www.chea.org/pdf/Accreditation_and_Recognition_PP_Sept08.pdf Accreditation and Recognition in the United States] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307213518/http://www.chea.org/pdf/Accreditation_and_Recognition_PP_Sept08.pdf |date=2012-03-07 }}, CHEA, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Nationally accredited schools are usually career-oriented and [[for-profit college|for profit]]. Both regional and national accreditations are recognized by the United States Department of Education (U.S.DoED) [https://ope.ed.gov/accreditation/agencies.aspx], the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA).

Every college in the United States has the right to set standards and to accept or refuse to accept [[transfer credit]]s.&lt;ref name="demand"/&gt; If a student has attended a school that is not regionally accredited, it may be difficult or impossible to have the credits, or even the degree earned, recognized by a regionally accredited college (or employer).&lt;ref name="tussle"/&gt; A 2005 study by the [[U.S. Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) found that, in making decisions on credit transfer, about 84 percent of U.S. higher education institutions considered whether the sending institution is accredited, and many had policies stating that they would accept credits only from regionally accredited institutions.&lt;ref name=GAO2005&gt;[[Government Accountability Office]], [http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d0622.pdf Transfer Students: Postsecondary Institutions Could Promote More Consistent Consideration of Coursework by Not Basing Determinations on Accreditation], GAO-06-22, October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; About 63 percent of institutions told the GAO that they would accept credit from any regionally accredited institution, but only 14 percent similarly accepted credits from nationally accredited schools.&lt;ref name=GAO2005/&gt; Regionally accredited institutions are reluctant to accept credits from nationally accredited institutions due, in part, to national accreditors' less stringent standards for criteria such as [[Faculty (academic staff)|faculty]] qualifications and [[library]] resources.&lt;ref name=GAO2005/&gt; Students who anticipate transferring credits from a nationally accredited school to a regionally accredited one are advised to verify in advance that the credits will be accepted.&lt;ref name="yahoo"&gt;[http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/education/courses/distancelearn-09.html What is the Difference Between Regional and National Accreditation], Yahoo! Education website{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tussle"&gt;[http://insidehighered.com/news/2007/02/26/transfer Tussling Over Transfer of Credit, ''[[Inside Higher Ed]]'', February 26, 2007 by Doug Lederman]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="demand"&gt;[http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2005/10/19/transfer Demanding Credit, ''[[Inside Higher Ed]]'', Oct. 19, 2005 by Scott Jaschik]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2016}}

In general, the names of U.S. post-secondary institutions and their degree titles do not indicate whether the institution is accredited or the type of accreditation it holds. Rules on this topic vary from state to state.  For example, [[Tennessee Higher Education Commission]] regulations require that post-secondary institutions in the state of [[Tennessee]] must be regionally accredited to use the word "university" in their names, and that a school lacking regional accreditation may not use the word "college" in its name without adding a qualifier such as "career", "vocational", "business", "technical", "art", "Bible", or "Christian". Tennessee rules also specify that only regionally accredited schools can issue [[liberal arts]] degrees or degree titles such as [[Associate of Arts]] or Science and [[Bachelor of Arts]] or Science.&lt;ref&gt;Tennessee Comptroller of the Treasury, ''[http://www.comptroller.state.tn.us/repository/RE/diplomamills2007.pdf Protecting Tennesseans from Education Fraud]'', March 2007.

The '''Romney Literary Society''' (also known as the '''Literary Society of Romney''') existed from January 30, 1819, to February 15, 1886, in [[Romney, West Virginia]]. Established as the '''Polemic Society of Romney''', it became the first organization of its kind in the present-day state of West Virginia, and one of the first in the United States. The society was founded by nine prominent men of Romney with the objectives of advancing literature and science, purchasing and maintaining a library, and improving educational opportunities.

The society debated an extensive range of scientific and social topics, often violating its own rules which banned religious and political subjects. Even though its membership was relatively small, its debates and activities were frequently discussed throughout the [[Potomac Highlands of West Virginia|Potomac Highlands]] region, and the organization greatly influenced trends of thought in the Romney community and surrounding areas.

The society's library began in 1819 with the acquisition of two books; by 1861, it had grown to contain approximately 3,000 volumes on subjects such as literature, science, history, and art. The organization also sought to establish an institution for "the higher education of the youth of the community." In 1820, as a result of this initiative, the teaching of the classics was introduced into the curriculum of [[Romney Academy]], thus making the institution the first school of higher education in the [[Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia|Eastern Panhandle]]. In 1846, the society constructed a building which housed the [[Romney Classical Institute]] and its library, both of which fell under the society's supervision. The institute was administered by noted Presbyterian Reverend [[William Henry Foote]]. Following a dispute with the society, Foote founded a rival school in Romney, known as the Potomac Seminary, in 1850.

The Romney Literary Society and the Romney Classical Institute continued to grow in influence until the onset of the [[American Civil War]] in 1861. The contents of the society's library were plundered by [[Union Army]] forces, and only 400 of the library's volumes could be recovered following the war's end in 1865. Reorganized in 1869,  the society took a leading role in Romney's civil development during [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]]. Between 1869 and 1870, it completed construction of [[Literary Hall]], where the society held meetings and reassembled its library. The organization used its influence to secure the [[West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind]] for the town of Romney, and offered the school its former Romney Classical Institute campus. The schools opened on September 29, 1870. Interest in the society waned during its final years, and its last recorded meeting was held in 1886.

== Establishment ==
The Romney Literary Society was organized on January 30, 1819, by nine prominent men of Romney in the office of Dr. John Temple, a reputable physician in the community.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=430.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "FWP1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Federal Writers' Project|1937|p=31.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Maxwell10"&gt;{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=491.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society was formed with the purpose "of taking into consideration the propriety of financing a Society, having for its object the advancement of Literature and Science, the purchase of a Library by and for the use of its members; and their further improvement by discussing before the Society such questions as shall be selected under its directors."&lt;ref name = "Brannon1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brannon|1976|p=257.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "FWP2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Federal Writers' Project|1937|pp=31–32.}}&lt;/ref&gt; With its establishment, the Romney Literary Society became the first organization of its kind in the present-day state of West Virginia, and one of the first in the United States.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brannon1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Munske1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Munske|Kerns|2004|p=185.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nine men at the society's first meeting were Thomas Blair, David Gibson, James P. Jack, Samuel Kercheval, Jr., Nathaniel Kuykendall, Charles T. Magill, James M. Stephens, John Temple, and William C. Wodrow.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Munske1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "FWP3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Federal Writers' Project|1937|p=32.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Hu Maxwell]], these men elected Kuykendall as chairman and Magill as secretary of a committee which was charged with the drafting of a constitution for the society.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell1"/&gt;

On February 4, 1819, the committee delivered its draft of the constitution and the society adopted the document, which provided that the organization should be known as the Polemic Society of Romney.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brannon1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "FWP3"/&gt; The society's constitution also specified that the officers should consist of a president, secretary, and treasurer, each of whom was to be selected by a ballot vote.&lt;ref name = "FWP3"/&gt; The constitution further stipulated that each member was to pay dues of 50 cents per month, and that the society had the authority to levy further financial contributions from its members as it deemed necessary.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "FWP3"/&gt; The funds collected were to cover the society's operating costs, and the remaining funds were to be used in purchasing books for the library.&lt;ref name = "FWP3"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Maxwell2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=431.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the constitution, the society's meetings were to be held weekly.&lt;ref name = "FWP3"/&gt; Following each meeting's business session, a debate or other literary exercises were to be held consisting of topics of general interest of the members.&lt;ref name = "Munske1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "FWP4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Federal Writers' Project|1937|pp=32–33.}}&lt;/ref&gt; No political or religious discussions were to take place during the debates unless they were of an abstract nature or in general terms.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "FWP5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Federal Writers' Project|1937|p=33.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Profane language and "spirituous liquors" were also forbidden from the society's meetings, with each offense being punishable with a fine of one dollar.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "FWP5"/&gt; The society's first elected officers were Charles T. Magill as president, William C. Wodrow as secretary, and John Temple as treasurer.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "FWP5"/&gt;

== Early debates ==
The society's next meeting was held on February 13, 1819, in the old [[Hampshire County Courthouse (West Virginia)|Hampshire County Courthouse]], where the first matter for debate was "Resolved: That a representative should be governed by instructions from his constituents."&lt;ref name = "Maxwell2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "FWP5"/&gt; Following the debate, the decision was rendered in favor of the affirmative.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "FWP5"/&gt; The second meeting, which was held on February 19 of that year at the [[Romney Academy]], debated the question, "Is an education acquired at the public school or [is] a private tutor to be preferred?" and the society favored the public school.&lt;ref name = "Munske1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Maxwell2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "FWP5"/&gt; At this second meeting, the first money appropriated by the society was paid to the doorkeeper for a sum of 25 cents.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell2"/&gt; Also at this second meeting, the treasurer was instructed to purchase a book for use by the secretary, three candlesticks, one pair of [[Candle snuffer|snuffers]], and three pounds of candles.&lt;ref name = "FWP5"/&gt; On February 26, the society argued the question, "Is a system of banking advantageous to a community?"&lt;ref name = "Maxwell2"/&gt; The debate ended under the decision that a system of banking was advantageous.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell2"/&gt; The following meeting on March 6 debated a question far more psychological in nature, which was an abstract question of religion: "Can the human mind, by its own reflection, arrive at the conclusion that the soul is immortal?"&lt;ref name = "Maxwell2"/&gt; The society decided in the negative.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell2"/&gt; The society also debated and decided in the negative the question, "Is a protective [[tariff]] detrimental to the interests of the country?"&lt;ref name = "Maxwell2"/&gt;

One of the society's more spirited debates occurred in May 1822 over the question, "Is it to the interest of the people of Hampshire to encourage the canalling of the Potomac?"&lt;ref name = "Maxwell3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=432.}}&lt;/ref&gt; While no records of the arguments survive, the society decided that the canalling of the [[Potomac River]] would be detrimental to the interests of Hampshire County.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell3"/&gt; The debate took place before the construction of the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]] along the Maryland shore of the Potomac River to the north of Hampshire County.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell3"/&gt; The society's consensus was that a canal on the Potomac would destroy the business of [[teamster]]s who hauled merchandise from the east along the [[Northwestern Turnpike]].&lt;ref name = "Maxwell3"/&gt; For this reason, the society and local population of Romney also objected to the construction of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]].&lt;ref name = "Maxwell3"/&gt; To ensure confidentiality, the society passed a bylaw that enforced a fine of five dollars on any member who published either his own or another member's speeches delivered before the society.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=433.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this bylaw, no speeches were ever published.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell4"/&gt; The society adopted a new constitution in 1824.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell4"/&gt;

== Growth and influence ==
[[File:John Baker White.png|upright|right|thumb|[[John Baker White (Virginia)|John Baker White]]|alt=Black and white photograph of John Baker White, who has a beard and is wearing a suit.]]
Over the first ten years of the society's existence, the organization grew in membership and held meetings at least twice a month, and usually four times a month.&lt;ref name = "Brannon1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Maxwell2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "FWP5"/&gt; The society debated an extensive range of subjects including scientific, religious, political, and social topics, often violating the constitution's rules banning religious and political subjects.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "FWP5"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brannon2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brannon|1976|pp=257–258.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society's debates were often acrimonious and regularly spilled beyond the confines of the meetings and into the community.&lt;ref name = "FWP5"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brannon3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brannon|1976|p=258.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between January 30, 1819 and January 22, 1830, the society's membership rolls reached 52 members; although as few as 15 members attended the bimonthly meetings, and no more than 17 members were ever present at a meeting.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Maxwell4"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brannon3"/&gt;

Even though the Romney Literary Society's membership was relatively small, its debates and activities were frequently discussed throughout the [[Potomac Highlands of West Virginia|Potomac Highlands]] region.&lt;ref name = "FWP5"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brannon3"/&gt; For this reason, the society greatly influenced trends of thought in the Romney community and surrounding areas.&lt;ref name = "FWP5"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brannon3"/&gt; No records of the society's proceedings, works, or membership enrollments spanning the period between January 22, 1830 and 1861 are extant.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell4"/&gt; During this period, the society counted among its members [[Angus William McDonald]], [[John Baker White (Virginia)|John Baker White]], and [[Robert White (attorney general)|Robert White]].&lt;ref name = "Maxwell4"/&gt;

== Library collection ==
In order to fulfill one of its primary purposes of establishing a library for its members, the Romney Literary Society gradually began to acquire volumes for such a use.&lt;ref name = "FWP5"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brannon3"/&gt; The society's library began with the April 23, 1819 appropriation for the purchase of two books: [[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Parallel Lives]]'' and [[Emer de Vattel]]'s ''[[The Law of Nations]]''.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell2"/&gt;{{efn|Maxwell and Swisher assert the society's first two volumes were [[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Parallel Lives]]'' and [[Emer de Vattel]]'s ''[[The Law of Nations]]''. However, the Federal Writers' Project and historian Selden W. Brannon state that the first two books purchased by the society were Plutarch's ''Parallel Lives'' and [[Charles Rollin]]'s ''Ancient History''.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "FWP5"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brannon3"/&gt;}} On July 2, 1819, the balance of available funds in the treasurer's account was two dollars and forty-six cents, but by October 23, there were sufficient funds to purchase the following volumes: [[Charles Rollin]]'s ''Ancient History'', Lewis' ''Roman History'', and [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]]'s ''History of the Reign of Charles the Fifth''.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell3"/&gt;
[[File:Plutarch.gif|thumb|left|upright|''[[Parallel Lives]]'' by [[Plutarch]] ''(pictured)'' was among the first two volumes acquired by the society|alt=A black and white engraved side profile portrait of Plutarch]]
No more volumes were purchased until the end of 1820, when the society acquired the works of [[Livy]], [[Tacitus]], and [[John Marshall]]'s ''Life of Washington''.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell3"/&gt; Three months later, the society purchased a bookcase for its growing collection.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell3"/&gt; In April 1821, the society further expanded its library with the acquisitions of [[Nathaniel Hooke]]'s ''Roman History, from the Building of Rome to the Ruin of the Commonwealth'', the works of [[Herodotus]], ''Travels in Greece'', ''Modern Europe'', [[David Ramsay (historian)|David Ramsay]]'s ''History of the United States'', and the works of [[Benjamin Franklin]].&lt;ref name = "Maxwell3"/&gt;

In 1821, the [[Virginia General Assembly]] passed an act [[Incorporation (business)|incorporating]] the organization as the "Library Society of Romney."&lt;ref name = "Maxwell3"/&gt; The society found the assembly's charter unsatisfactory, as it specified several changes to the organization that the society had not asked for, including the change in its name. The members regarded their society as a "literary" society and not a "library" one.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell3"/&gt; The society requested that the assembly amend its charter, and after several delays and debates over the new charter, the Virginia General Assembly passed a new act on February 4, 1823, in which the organization was rebranded as "The Literary Society of Romney."&lt;ref name = "Maxwell3"/&gt; The society maintained this long form name throughout the duration of its existence, although it was locally known as the "Romney Literary Society."&lt;ref name = "Maxwell3"/&gt;

Within the span of ten years, the society's small library grew to contain approximately 3,000 volumes on literature, science, history, and art.&lt;ref name = "FWP5"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Maxwell3"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brannon3"/&gt; These were bound in calfskin and stamped with the seal of the society.&lt;ref name = "FWP5"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brannon3"/&gt; The minutes from the society's bimonthly meetings listed the books purchased and the methods by which they were acquired.&lt;ref name = "FWP5"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brannon3"/&gt; According to the [[Federal Writers' Project]] in their ''Historic Romney 1762–1937'' (1937), the book selections and their acquisition "indicate that these men possessed real literary judgment and business ability."&lt;ref name = "FWP5"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brannon3"/&gt;

By resolutions of the society, the use of the library was for the society's members, and was further extended to "ministers of the gospel of all denominations ''gratis''."&lt;ref name = "Jewett3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Jewett|1851|p=148.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain citizens of Romney were also granted access to the library, and enjoyed similar privileges as its members.&lt;ref name = "Jewett3"/&gt;

== Academic patronage ==
From the organization's foundation, the Romney Literary Society gradually began to recognize that the local subscription school systems provided only elementary and often fragmentary education and no longer satisfied the academic needs of the Romney community.&lt;ref name = "Brannon3"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "FWP6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Federal Writers' Project|1937|p=34.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society periodically engaged in lengthy deliberations on which theories of educational advancement and popular education were preferable.&lt;ref name = "Brannon3"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "FWP6"/&gt; Shortly after its establishment, the society commenced a movement to establish an institution for "the higher education of the youth of the community."&lt;ref name = "Brannon3"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "FWP6"/&gt; In 1820, as a result of this initiative, the teaching of the classics was introduced into the curriculum of Romney Academy, thus making the institution the first school of higher education in the [[Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia|Eastern Panhandle]].&lt;ref name = "Brannon3"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "FWP6"/&gt; Under the guidance, leadership, and strict discipline of Dr. Henry Johnston, Romney Academy became widely renowned for its courses in "higher classics."&lt;ref name = "Munske1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brannon3"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "FWP6"/&gt; His successor and society member [[William Henry Foote]] introduced courses in [[theology]], and the school's enrollment grew to include students preparing for ministry.&lt;ref name = "Brannon3"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "FWP7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Federal Writers' Project|1937|pp=34–35.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the school became more renowned in the [[Potomac River#South Branch Potomac River|South Branch Potomac River]] valley, pupils came from further and further away.&lt;ref name = "Brannon4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brannon|1976|p=259.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "FWP8"&gt;{{Harvnb|Federal Writers' Project|1937|p=35.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Mulledy]] and Samuel Mulledy were among the early instructors at the academy, both of whom later served as presidents of [[Georgetown University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name = "FWP6"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brannon4"/&gt;

By 1831, Romney Academy had outgrown its facilities in the old stone school building behind the Hampshire County Courthouse.&lt;ref name = "Brannon4"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "FWP8"/&gt; To remedy this, the society instituted a campaign to raise funds for a new school building.&lt;ref name = "Brannon4"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "FWP8"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Maxwell5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=434.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 6, 1832, the Virginia General Assembly authorized the society to raise an endowment of $20,000 in a lottery for educational purposes.&lt;ref name = "FWP8"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Maxwell5"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brannon5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brannon|1976|p=260.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a ten-year lapse, the society made arrangements with James Gregory of [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]] and Daniel McIntyre of [[Philadelphia]] to finance a lottery "for raising a sum of money not exceeding twenty thousand dollars, for the purpose of erecting a suitable building for their accommodation, the purchase of library and Philosophical apparatus."&lt;ref name = "FWP8"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brannon5"/&gt; The lottery was to be conducted over a period of ten years, and sums of $750, $1,000, and $1,500 were to be raised in semiannual installments.&lt;ref name = "Brannon5"/&gt; The society was successful in raising funds, and in 1845 the society solicited bids for the construction of a new building to house both the academy, the society, and the society's library.&lt;ref name = "FWP8"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brannon5"/&gt; The society also used the lottery funds to pay for books for the academy.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell5"/&gt;

On February 12, 1844, the Virginia General Assembly passed an act authorizing the society to denote the balance of the moneys raised by the lottery to the Romney Academy.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell5"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Jewett1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Jewett|1851|p=147.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assembly further enacted another legislative act on December 12, 1846, authorizing the Romney Literary Society to "establish at or near the town of Romney a Seminary of Learning for the instruction of youth in various branches of science and literature; and the Society map appropriate to the same such portion of the property which it now has or may acquire, as it may deem expedient."&lt;ref name = "Maxwell5"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brannon5"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Jewett1"/&gt; That same year, a new brick [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] building was constructed east of Romney, and the society, its library, and Romney Academy relocated to the new facility.&lt;ref name = "FWP8"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Maxwell5"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brannon5"/&gt; The second story of the new building was utilized by the society, with one hall for meetings and the other hall for the society's library.&lt;ref name = "Jewett3"/&gt; According to Maxwell, "few schools in the state of Virginia at that time had access to better libraries."&lt;ref name = "Maxwell5"/&gt; The new institute building and grounds cost the society about $8,000.&lt;ref name = "Jewett3"/&gt; Following its move to the new building, the academy was reorganized as the [[Romney Classical Institute]] and its activities fell under the supervision of the society.&lt;ref name = "FWP8"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brannon5"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Rice1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rice|2015|p=260.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute was operated under the principalship of Foote from 1846 until 1849.&lt;ref name = "FWP8"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brannon5"/&gt;

In 1849, the society presented a new code and system of bylaws for the government of the Romney Classical Institute, which reserved to the society the power to appoint assistant teachers, fix the amount of salaries, and provide the conditions and manners of payment and reimbursement.&lt;ref name = "FWP8"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brannon5"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Maxwell6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|pp=434–435.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foote differed with the society over these matters, and he ultimately declined to accept the new bylaws and resigned his leadership position in October 1849; in 1850, he established a rival institution known as the Potomac Seminary.&lt;ref name = "FWP8"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Maxwell5"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Munske2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Munske|Kerns|2004|p=186.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than falling under the patronage of the society, Foote's new institution fell under the control of the Presbyterian church.&lt;ref name = "Munske2"/&gt; Following Foote's departure, the society selected Professor E. J. Meany to head the Romney Classical Institute.&lt;ref name = "FWP8"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Maxwell5"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brannon5"/&gt; Despite the schism, the society also provided financial support from the lottery to the Potomac Seminary.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell5"/&gt;

According to a "catalogue of the members and library" published on June 1, 1849, there were 20 registered members on the rolls who paid $3 each per year to the society's library fund; there were also eight library members who were admitted under certain regulations of the society and who paid the same fees.&lt;ref name = "Jewett3"/&gt; Members who had use of the library were provided keys and were allowed access to the library at any time.&lt;ref name = "Jewett3"/&gt; The town's clergymen and the principal of the Romney Classical Institute were the only non-members who were extended privileges to the library.&lt;ref name = "Jewett3"/&gt; The 1849 "catalogue" listed Alfred P. White as the society's librarian and E. J. Meany remained the principal of the institute.&lt;ref name = "Jewett3"/&gt; After 1853, the society possessed a permanent fund of $12,000, which yielded $720 per year, one half of which was devoted to the support of the Romney Classical Institute.&lt;ref name = "Jewett2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Jewett|1851|pp=147–148.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romney Literary Society and the Romney Classical Institute flourished and continued to grow in importance and influence until the onset of the [[American Civil War]] in 1861.&lt;ref name = "Brannon5"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Maxwell6"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "FWP9"&gt;{{Harvnb|Federal Writers' Project|1937|p=36.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the war's outbreak, many of the society's members and the institute's professors and older students joined the [[Confederate States Army]] and marched to war.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell6"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "FWP9"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brannon6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brannon|1976|p=261.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the war, the society suffered extensive losses.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell6"/&gt; The Romney Classical Institute building and its library were considered legitimate plunder by [[Union Army]] forces.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell6"/&gt; The society's library was emptied and three-fourths of its volumes were either scattered or destroyed.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell6"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brannon6"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "FWP10"&gt;{{Harvnb|Federal Writers' Project|1937|p=37.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most valuable of these volumes were never recovered following the war's end.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell6"/&gt; Its records of proceedings between 1830 and 1861, the period during which the society engaged in most of its notable literary and philanthropic works, were also destroyed during the war.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell4"/&gt;

Following the war's end, only 400 out of the library's nearly 3,000 volumes could be recovered, with only 200 of those books remaining on the library's shelves.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell6"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brannon6"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "FWP10"/&gt; Between 10 and 20 of the library's recovered volumes only contained three to four of their original books.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell6"/&gt; The value of the recovered volumes was degraded, as many were damaged or broken.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell6"/&gt; The society members that returned home to Romney were too war-weary to revive the society when they discovered the ruins of the Romney Classical Institute and its library, which had been an expensive endeavor to accumulate and took almost a half-century of labor to amass.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell6"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brannon6"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "FWP10"/&gt; The Romney Classical Institute was not restored and was in effect disestablished on account of the war.&lt;ref name = "Brannon6"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "FWP10"/&gt;

== Revival ==

Following the war, the residents of Romney set about repairing public buildings and reestablishing the town's antebellum institutions, including the Romney Literary Society.&lt;ref name = "FWP12"&gt;{{Harvnb|Federal Writers' Project|1937|p=67.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society remained on a hiatus until May 15, 1869 when a meeting was held by nine members, as only nine original members had responded to the call for reorganization.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell6"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Munske2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "FWP10"/&gt; These nine members tasked with rebuilding the society were James L. Armstrong, David Entler, William Harper, John C. Heiskell, Andrew Wodrow Kercheval, Samuel R. Lupton, James Parsons, Alfred P. White, and Robert White.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell6"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Munske2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brannon6"/&gt; These men sought to collect what remained of the library's books and engaged in a campaign to recruit new members, which resulted in the enrollment of 20 younger men over a period of a few years.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell6"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brannon6"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "FWP10"/&gt; Many of the men who had been members in 1861 had died during the war, and the recruitment of new members was essential to the revival of the society.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell6"/&gt; Among the new members elected between 1869 and 1886 were [[John Collins Covell]], [[Samuel Lightfoot Flournoy (West Virginia senator)|Samuel Lightfoot Flournoy]], [[Henry Bell Gilkeson]], [[Howard Hille Johnson]], and [[Christian Streit White]].&lt;ref name = "Maxwell7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=436.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society, with renewed vigor, took a lead role in Romney's civil development during the [[Reconstruction Era]].&lt;ref name = "FWP12"/&gt;

Between 1869 and 1870, the society completed construction of a new two-story brick building on Lot 56 at the corner of West Main and North High Streets known as [[Literary Hall]], where it could hold its meetings and reassemble the remaining volumes from its original library.&lt;ref name = "Munske2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Maxwell7"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pauley1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pauley|1979|p=3 of the PDF file.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literary Hall was built upon the former location of the shuttered Bank of the South Branch of the Potomac.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell9"&gt;{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=345.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the 400 volumes that were initially recovered following the war, the society recovered several more volumes from its original library, and set about purchasing new books; the restored library was reopened with about 700 volumes.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell6"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brannon6"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "FWP11"&gt;{{Harvnb|Federal Writers' Project|1937|p=38.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the time of the society's reorganization in 1869, the state of West Virginia considered the establishment of a school for the deaf and the blind.&lt;ref name = "Brannon6"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "FWP10"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brannon8"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brannon|1976|p=264.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society resolved to secure the new state institution for Romney.&lt;ref name = "Brannon6"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "FWP10"/&gt; On April 12, 1870, the society passed a resolution by which the members agreed to deed, free of cost, the buildings and grounds of the Romney Classical Institute.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell7"/&gt;

On April 20, 1870, the society sent Andrew Wodrow Kercheval and Robert White as representatives to the then-state capital [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling]] to present their formal offer of "the grounds and buildings of the Romney Classical Institute... to the Board of Regents, free of debt, and in good repair" on the condition that the proposed school be located in Romney.&lt;ref name = "Brannon6"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "FWP10"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Maxwell7"/&gt; [[Clarksburg, West Virginia|Clarksburg]] and [[Parkersburg, West Virginia|Parkersburg]] also made offers of potential campuses to the state.&lt;ref name = "Brannon8"/&gt; The offer was made to the Board of Regents of the West Virginia Institute for the Deaf, Dumb, and Blind, as it was then known, and the society's proposal was accepted by the regents after a brief period of deliberation.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell7"/&gt; The society's offer was the only one that included a building upon the grounds.&lt;ref name = "FWP10"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Maxwell7"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brannon8"/&gt;

It was discovered by the society that in order to follow through with their proposition, it was necessary to raise more than $1,000, which was ostensibly a difficult task during the Reconstruction Era in Romney.&lt;ref name = "FWP10"/&gt; On July 11, 1870, the Board of Regents passed a resolution necessitating the subscription of between $1,200 and $1,300 to facilitate the transaction.&lt;ref name = "FWP10"/&gt; One hundred and eighteen individuals and firms responded to the board's request with a total subscription of $1,383.60.&lt;ref name = "FWP10"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pauley2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pauley|1979|p=4 of the PDF file.}}&lt;/ref&gt; To make good on its offer, the society also made an appropriation of $320 on July 11 for the purpose of repairing and restoring the former Romney Classical Institute and grounds so that they were satisfactory before they were transferred to the regents.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell7"/&gt; Shortly thereafter, the old institute building and {{convert|15|acres|ha}} of property were formally transferred to the state of West Virginia.&lt;ref name = "Brannon6"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "FWP10"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brannon8"/&gt;

On September 29, 1870, the institute, which was later known as the [[West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind]], opened its doors in the old Romney Classical Institute building with 25 deaf and five blind students.&lt;ref name = "Brannon8"/&gt; Following its disestablishment in 1916, the adjacent Potomac Academy (formerly Potomac Seminary) grounds were also incorporated into the campus of the Schools for the Deaf and Blind.&lt;ref name = "Munske2"/&gt;

During a period of ten years spanning from 1870 to 1880, much of Romney's intellectual life centered on Literary Hall.&lt;ref name = "Brannon6"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "FWP11"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pauley2"/&gt; During this time, the society met only occasionally and there were no records of meetings between March 1872 and April 1878.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell7"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pauley2"/&gt; The post-war period of revival was short-lived, as the death of the older members caused interest in the society to wane.&lt;ref name = "Brannon6"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "FWP11"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pauley2"/&gt; The society's meetings occurred less often, and the last recorded meeting of the society was held on February 15, 1886.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell7"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "FWP11"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brannon7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brannon|1976|p=262.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the society's second existence, Literary Hall was used as a meeting space by the [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] and the [[Order of the Eastern Star]], and the organizations continued to inhabit the hall following the society's disestablishment until its 1974 purchase by attorney Ralph Haines.&lt;ref name = "Munske2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brannon7"/&gt; Also a local historian, Haines restored Literary Hall and used it as his law office and museum.&lt;ref name = "Munske2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brannon7"/&gt; Literary Hall was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on May 29, 1979, and, as of 2004, it is occasionally open to the public.&lt;ref name = "Munske2"/&gt; The society's remaining records, dating as early as 1819, remain on display there.&lt;ref name = "Pauley2"/&gt;

== Legacy ==
In describing the efforts of the Romney Literary Society, historian Hu Maxwell, in his ''History of Hampshire County, West Virginia From Its Earliest Settlement to the Present'' (1897), stated that "the work accomplished by these few energetic citizens of Romney is astonishing."&lt;ref name = "Maxwell1"/&gt; Maxwell further asserted, "No other one thing in the history of the town has had such lasting results for good."&lt;ref name = "Maxwell1"/&gt; The society left many lasting impacts upon the town of Romney during its existence and beyond, which included the foundation of a library; the academic and financial support and patronage of the Romney Academy, Romney Classical Institute, and the Potomac Seminary; the civic leadership during the Reconstruction Era; and the influence and assistance in securing the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind.&lt;ref name = "FWP12"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Maxwell8"&gt;{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|pp=436–437.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Maxwell, without the efforts of the society, the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind could not have been secured for Romney, and would have likely been located elsewhere in the state.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell8"/&gt;

'''Sergei Parajanov''' ({{lang-hy|Սերգեյ Փարաջանով}}; {{lang-ru|Серге́й Ио́сифович Параджа́нов}}; {{lang-ka|სერგო ფარაჯანოვი}}; {{lang-uk|Сергій Йо́сипович Параджа́нов}}; sometimes spelled '''Paradzhanov''' or '''Paradjanov'''; January 9, 1924 – July 20, 1990) was a Soviet [[film director]] and artist of Armenian descent who made significant contributions to Soviet cinematography through [[Ukrainian cinema|Ukrainian]], [[Georgian cinema|Georgian]], and [[Armenian cinema]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0660886/ Sergei Parajanov, Biography at IMDB]&lt;/ref&gt; He invented his own cinematic style, which was totally out of step with the guiding principles of [[socialist realism]] (the only sanctioned art style in the USSR). This, combined with his controversial lifestyle and behaviour, led Soviet authorities to repeatedly persecute and imprison him, and suppress his films.

Although he started professional film-making in 1954, Parajanov later disowned all the films he made before 1965 as "garbage". After directing ''[[Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors]]'' (renamed ''Wild Horses of Fire'' for most foreign distributions) Parajanov became something of an international celebrity and simultaneously a target of attacks from the system. Nearly all of his film projects and plans from 1965 to 1973 were banned, scrapped or closed by the Soviet film administrations, both local (in [[Kiev]] and [[Yerevan]]) and federal ([[Goskino]]), almost without discussion, until he was finally arrested in late 1973 on charges of [[rape]], [[homosexuality]] and [[bribery]]. He was imprisoned until 1977, despite a  pleas for pardon from various artists. Even after his release (he was arrested for the third and last time in 1982) he was a ''[[persona non grata]]'' in Soviet cinema. It was not until the mid-1980s, when the political climate started to relax, that he could resume directing. Still, it required the help of influential Georgian actor [[Dodo Abashidze]] and other friends to have his last feature films greenlighted. His health seriously weakened by four years in labor camps and nine months in prison in Tbilisi, Parajanov died of [[lung cancer]] in 1990, at a time when, after almost 20 years of suppression, his films were being featured at foreign film festivals. 
In January 1988, he said in an interview, "Everyone knows that I have three Motherlands. I was born in Georgia, worked in Ukraine and I'm going to die in Armenia."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parajanov.com/interview.html Parajanov Interview]&lt;/ref&gt;
Sergei Parajanov is buried at [[Komitas Pantheon]] in Yerevan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hush.am/index.php?route=product/hush&amp;grave_id=hush710d9f2e5366a40&amp;gcemetery=Komitas+Pantheon Parajanov's memorial tombstone at Komitas Pantheon]&lt;/ref&gt;

Parajanov's films won prizes at [[Mar del Plata Film Festival]], [[Istanbul International Film Festival]], [[Nika Awards]], [[Rotterdam International Film Festival]], [[Sitges - Catalan International Film Festival]], [[São Paulo International Film Festival]] and others.

==Early life and films==
[[Image:ParajanovHouseTbilisi.JPG|thumb|right|Memorial plaque on the Parajanov family house in Tbilisi (7 Kote Meskhi St.)]]
Parajanov was born '''Sarkis Hovsepi Parajaniants''' (Սարգիս Հովսեփի Փարաջանյանց) to artistically gifted [[Armenians|Armenian]] parents, Iosif Paradjanov and Siranush Bejanova, in [[Tbilisi, Georgia]]. (The family name of Parajaniants is attested by a surviving historical document at the Sergei Parajanov Museum in Yerevan.)&lt;ref&gt;Sergei Paradzhanov and Zaven Sarkisian, ''Kaleidoskop Paradzhanov: Risunok, kollazh, assambliazh'' (Yerevan: Muzei Sergeiia Paradzhanova, 2008), p.8&lt;/ref&gt; He gained access to art from an early age. In 1945, he traveled to Moscow, enrolled in the directing department at the [[VGIK]], one of the oldest and highly respected film schools in [[Europe]], and studied under the tutelage of directors [[Igor Savchenko]] and [[Aleksandr Dovzhenko]].

In 1948 he was convicted of [[homosexuality|homosexual acts]] (which were illegal at the time in the Soviet Union) with a [[Ministry for State Security (USSR)|MGB]] officer named Nikolai Mikava in Tbilisi. He was sentenced to five years in prison, but was released under an amnesty after three months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.segodnya.ua/news/851530.html Segodnya.ua]&lt;/ref&gt; In video interviews, friends and relatives contest the truthfulness of anything he was charged with. They speculate the punishment may have been a form of political retaliation for his rebellious views.

In 1950 Parajanov married his first wife, Nigyar Kerimova, in [[Moscow]]. She came from a [[Tatar|Muslim Tatar]] family and converted to [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity]] to marry Parajanov. She was later murdered by her relatives because of her conversion. After her murder Parajanov left [[Russia]] for Kiev, [[Ukraine]], where he produced a few documentaries (''Dumka'', ''Golden Hands'', ''Natalia Uzhvy'') and a handful of narrative films: ''Andriesh'' (based on a fairy tale by the Moldovan writer [[Emilian Bukov]]), ''The Top Guy'' (a [[kolkhoz]] musical), ''Ukrainian Rhapsody'' (a wartime melodrama), and ''[[Flower on the Stone]]'' (about a religious cult infiltrating a mining town in the [[Donets Basin]]). He became fluent in [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and married his second wife, Svitlana Ivanivna Shcherbatiuk, also known as Svetlana Sherbatiuk or Svetlana Parajanov, in 1956. Shcherbatiuk gave birth to a son, Suren, in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parajanov.com/suren.html Suren Parajanov]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Break from Soviet Realism==

[[Image:Sayat nova.jpg|thumb|left|Parajanov's muse, Georgian actress [[Sofiko Chiaureli]] in ''[[The Color of Pomegranates]]'']]

[[Andrey Tarkovsky]]'s first film ''[[Ivan's Childhood]]'' had an enormous impact on Parajanov's self-discovery as a filmmaker. Later the influence became mutual, and he and Tarkovsky became close friends. In 1965 Parajanov abandoned [[socialist realism]] and directed the poetic ''[[Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors]]'', his first film over which he had complete creative control. It won numerous international awards and, unlike the subsequent ''[[The Color of Pomegranates]]'', was relatively well received by the Soviet authorities. The Script Editorial Board at Goskino of Ukraine praised the film for "conveying the poetic quality and philosophical depth of M. Kotsiubynsky’s tale through the language of cinema," and called it "a brilliant creative success of the Dovzhenko studio." Moscow also agreed to Goskino of Ukraine's request to release the film with its original Ukrainian soundtrack intact, rather than redub the dialogue into Russian for Soviet-wide release, in order to preserve its Ukrainian flavor.&lt;ref&gt;RGALI (Russian State Archive of Art and Literature), Goskino production and censorship files: f. 2944, op. 4, d. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; (Russian dubbing was standard practice at that time for non-Russian Soviet films when they were distributed outside the republic of origin.)

Parajanov departed Kiev shortly afterwards for his ancestors' homeland, [[Armenia]]. In 1969, he embarked on ''Sayat Nova'', a film that many consider to be his crowning achievement, though it was shot under relatively poor conditions and had a very small budget.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://www.kinema.uwaterloo.ca/hollo961.htm Sergei Parajanov – Interview with Ron Holloway, 1988] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206074545/http://www.kinema.uwaterloo.ca/hollo961.htm |date=2007-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet censors intervened and banned ''Sayat Nova'' for its allegedly inflammatory content. Parajanov re-edited his footage and renamed the film ''[[The Color of Pomegranates]]''. Critic Alexei Korotyukov remarked: "Paradjanov made films not about how things are, but how they would have been had he been God." {{citation needed|date=October 2015}} [[Mikhail Vartanov]] wrote in 1969 that "Besides the film language suggested by Griffith and Eisenstein, the world cinema has not discovered anything revolutionarily new until ''[[The Color of Pomegranates]]'' ...".&lt;ref name="Parajanov.com"&gt;[http://www.parajanov.com/main.html Parajanov.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imprisonment and later work==

By December 1973, the Soviet authorities had grown increasingly suspicious of Parajanov's perceived subversive proclivities, particularly his bisexuality, and sentenced him to five years in a hard labor camp in [[Siberia]] for "a rape of a Communist Party member, and the propagation of pornography."&lt;ref name="mig.com.ua"&gt;[http://www.mig.com.ua/events.php?act=1&amp;cat=1057&amp;eventID=10849  ''Осужден за изнасилование члена КПСС'' (in Russian), ''Moskovskiy Komsomolets'', 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070810210559/http://www.mig.com.ua/events.php?act=1&amp;cat=1057&amp;eventID=10849 |date=2007-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days before Parajanov was sentenced, [[Andrei Tarkovsky]] wrote a letter to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine, asserting that "In the last ten years Sergei Paradjanov has made only two films: ''Shadows of Our Forgotten Ancestors'' and ''The Colour of Pomegranates''. They have influenced cinema first in [[Ukraine]], second in this country as a whole, and third in the world at large. Artistically, there are few people in the entire world who could replace Paradjanov. He is guilty – guilty of his solitude. We are guilty of not thinking of him daily and of failing to discover the significance of a master." An eclectic group of artists, filmmakers and activists protested, to little avail, on behalf of Parajanov, among them [[Yves Saint-Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]], [[Françoise Sagan]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[François Truffaut]], [[Luis Buñuel]], [[Federico Fellini]], [[Michelangelo Antonioni]], [[Andrei Tarkovsky]] and [[Mikhail Vartanov]].

Parajanov served four years out of his five-year sentence, and later credited his early release to the efforts of the [[France|French]] [[Surrealist]] poet and novelist [[Louis Aragon]], the Russian poet [[Elsa Triolet]] (Aragon's wife), and the American writer [[John Updike]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt; His early release was authorized by [[Leonid Brezhnev]], [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], presumably as a consequence of Brezhnev's chance meeting with Aragon and Triolet at the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] in Moscow. When asked by Brezhnev if he could be of any assistance, Aragon requested the release of Parajanov, which was effected by December 1977.&lt;ref name="mig.com.ua"/&gt;

While he was incarcerated, Parajanov produced a large number of miniature doll-like sculptures (some of which were lost) and some 800 drawings and collages, many of which were later displayed in [[Yerevan]], where the [[Sergei Parajanov Museum]] is now permanently located.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frieze.com/issue/review/paradjanov_the_magnificent Frieze Magazine, Paradjanov the Magnificent] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416142206/http://www.frieze.com/issue/review/paradjanov_the_magnificent/ |date=2008-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (The museum, opened in 1991, a year after Parajanov’s death, hosts more than 200 works as well as furnishings from his home in [[Tbilisi]].) His efforts in the camp were repeatedly compromised by prison guards, who deprived him of materials and called him mad, their cruelty only subsiding after a statement from Moscow admitted that "the director is very talented."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;

After his return from prison to Tbilisi, the close watch of Soviet censors prevented Parajanov from continuing his cinematic pursuits and steered him towards the artistic outlets he had nurtured during his time in prison. He crafted extraordinarily intricate collages, created a large collection of abstract drawings and pursued numerous other avenues of non-cinematic art, sewing more dolls and some whimsical suits.

In February 1982 Parajanov was once again imprisoned, on charges of bribery, which happened to coincide with his return to Moscow for the premiere of a play commemorating [[Vladimir Vysotsky]] at the [[Taganka Theatre]], and was effected with some degree of trickery. Despite another stiff sentence, he was freed in less than a year, with his health seriously weakened.&lt;ref name="mig.com.ua"/&gt;

In 1985, the slow thaw within the [[Soviet Union]] spurred Parajanov to resume his passion for cinema. With the encouragement of various [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] intellectuals, he created the multi-award-winning film ''[[Legend of Suram Fortress]]'', based on a novella by [[Daniel Chonkadze]], his first return to cinema since ''Sayat Nova'' fifteen years earlier. In 1988, Parajanov made another multi-award-winning film, ''[[Ashik Kerib (film)|Ashik Kerib]]'', based on a story by [[Mikhail Lermontov]]. It is the story of a wandering minstrel, set in the [[Azeri]] culture. Parajanov dedicated the film to his close friend [[Andrei Tarkovsky]] and "to all the children of the world".

Parajanov then attempted to complete his final project. He died of [[cancer]] in [[Yerevan]], [[Armenia]], on July 20, 1990, aged 66, leaving this final work, ''The Confession'', unfinished. It survives in its original negative as ''[[Parajanov: The Last Spring]]'', assembled by his close friend [[Mikhail Vartanov]] in 1992. [[Federico Fellini]], [[Tonino Guerra]], [[Francesco Rosi]], [[Alberto Moravia]], [[Giulietta Masina]], [[Marcello Mastroianni]] and [[Bernardo Bertolucci]] were among those who publicly mourned his death.&lt;ref name="Parajanov.com"/&gt; They sent a telegram to Russia with the following statement: "The world of cinema has lost a magician".&lt;ref name="Parajanov.com"/&gt;

== Influences and legacy==
[[File:Sergei Parajanov's tombstone at Komitas Pantheon.jpg|thumb|upright|Parajanov's tombstone in [[Yerevan]]]]
Despite having studied film at the [[VGIK]], Parajanov discovered his artistic path only after seeing [[Andrei Tarkovsky]]'s dreamlike first film ''[[Ivan's Childhood]]''. Parajanov was highly appreciated by Tarkovsky himself in "[[Voyage in Time]]" ("Always with huge gratitude and pleasure I remember the films of Sergei Parajanov which I love very much. His way of thinking, his paradoxical, poetical... ability to love the beauty and the ability to be absolutely free within his own vision"), and [[Michelangelo Antonioni]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]] ("In the temple of cinema, there are images, light, and reality. Sergei Parajanov was the master of that temple"), [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Mikhail Vartanov]] ("Probably, besides the film language suggested by Griffith and Eisenstein, the world cinema has not discovered anything revolutionary new until Paradjanov's ''Color of Pomegranates''"), [[Federico Fellini]], [[Tonino Guerra]], [[Giulietta Masina]], [[Francesco Rosi]], [[Alberto Moravia]], [[Bernardo Bertolucci]], [[Marcello Mastroianni]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parajanov.com/ See official page].&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite having many admirers of his art, his vision did not attract many followers. "Whoever tries to imitate me is lost", he reportedly said.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/sitemap/free/2014/2/article/parajanovs-influence-still-spreading-on-90th-anniversary/495366.html The Moscow Times]&lt;/ref&gt; However, directors such as [[Theo Angelopoulos]], [[Béla Tarr]] and [[Mohsen Makhmalbaf]] share Parajanov's approach to film as a primarily visual medium rather than as a narrative tool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parajanov.com/influences.html Parajanov Influence &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Parajanov-Vartanov Institute]] was established in Hollywood in 2010 to study, preserve and promote the artistic legacies of Sergei Parajanov and [[Mikhail Vartanov]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://institute.parajanov.com Parajanov-Vartanov Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20141022052354/http://institute.parajanov.com/ |date=2014-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cultures, snakes were fertility symbols.  For example, the [[Hopi]] people of [[North America]] performed an annual snake dance to celebrate the union of Snake Youth (a Sky spirit) and Snake Girl (an Underworld spirit) and to renew the [[fertility]] of [[Nature]]. During the dance, live snakes were handled and at the end of the dance the snakes were released into the fields to guarantee good crops. "The snake dance is a prayer to the spirits of the clouds, the thunder and the lightning, that the rain may fall on the growing crops."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Monsen|first=Frederick|title=Festivals of the Hopi, and dancing and expression in all their national ceremonies|url=http://www.adwr.state.az.us/Adjudications/documents/HopiContestedCaseDisclosures/Hopi%20Initial%20Disclosure/HP1535%20-%20HP1549.pdf}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cultures,{{which|date=July 2016}} snakes symbolized the [[umbilical cord]], joining all humans to [[Mother goddess|Mother Earth]]. The [[Mother goddess|Great Goddess]] often had snakes as her [[Familiar spirit|familiars]]—sometimes twining around her sacred staff, as in [[ancient Crete]]—and they were worshiped as guardians of her [[Sacred Mysteries|mysteries]] of [[birth]] and regeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hilda Roderick|first=Ellis Davidson|title=Myths and Symbols in Pagan Europe: Early Scandinavian and Celtic Religions|year=1988|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=U.K.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=R-rIAAAAIAAJ|isbn=9780719025792}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolic values frequently assigned to serpents==

===Fertility and rebirth===
Historically, serpents and snakes represent [[fertility]] or a creative life force. As snakes shed their skin through [[sloughing]], they are symbols of rebirth, transformation, immortality, and healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mythencyclopedia.com/Sa-Sp/Serpents-and-Snakes.html |title=Myths Encyclopedia Serpents and Snakes |publisher=Mythencyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ouroboros]] is a symbol of [[eternity]] and continual renewal of life.

In some [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic traditions]], the serpent represents [[sexual desire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VD1YAAAAMAAJ |title=The American journal of urology and sexology p 72 |date=1984-01-01 |accessdate=2012-12-07|author1=Spooner |first1=Henry G }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some interpretations of the [[Midrash]], the [[Serpent (Bible)|serpent]] represents sexual passion.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, SO "Midrash Rabba to Genesis", sec. 20, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Hinduism]], [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]] is a coiled serpent.&lt;ref name="MetaModernEra"&gt;Her Holiness Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi Srivastava: "Meta Modern Era", pages 233–248. Vishwa Nirmala Dharma; first edition, 1995. {{ISBN|978-81-86650-05-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guardianship===
[[File:Buddha shielded by Naga.jpg|upright|thumb|Meditating [[Buddha]] being shielded by the naga [[Mucalinda]]. [[Cambodia]], 1150 to 1175]]

Serpents are represented as potent guardians of temples and other sacred spaces. This connection may be grounded in the observation that when threatened, some snakes (such as [[rattlesnakes]] or [[cobras]]) frequently hold and defend their ground, first resorting to threatening display and then fighting, rather than retreat. Thus, they are natural guardians of treasures or sacred sites which cannot easily be moved out of harm's way.

At [[Angkor]] in [[Architecture of Cambodia|Cambodia]], numerous stone sculptures present hooded multi-headed [[nāga]]s as guardians of temples or other premises. A favorite motif of Angkorean sculptors from approximately the 12th century&amp;nbsp;CE onward was that of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], sitting in the position of meditation, his weight supported by the coils of a multi-headed naga that also uses its flared hood to shield him from above.  This motif recalls the story of the Buddha and the serpent king [[Mucalinda]]: as the Buddha sat beneath a tree engrossed in meditation, Mucalinda came up from the roots of the tree to shield the Buddha from a tempest that was just beginning to arise.

The [[Gadsden flag]] of the American Revolution depicts a [[rattlesnake]] coiled up and poised to strike.  Below the image of the snake is the legend, "Don't tread on me."  The snake symbolized the dangerousness of colonists willing to fight for their rights and homeland. The motif is repeated in the [[First Navy Jack]] of the US Navy.

===Poison and medicine===
Serpents are connected with poison and medicine. The snake's venom is associated with the chemicals of plants and fungi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| author=[[Virgil]] |title=[[Aeneid]] |page=2.471}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = [[Nicander]] Alexipharmaca 521  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] [[Pliny's Natural History|Natural History]] 9.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; that have the power to either heal, poison or provide expanded consciousness (and even the [[elixir of life]] and immortality) through divine intoxication. Because of its herbal knowledge and [[entheogen]]ic association the snake was often considered one of the wisest animals, being (close to the) divine. Its divine aspect combined with its habitat in the earth between the roots of plants made it an animal with [[chthonic]] properties connected to the afterlife and immortality. [[Asclepius]], the god of [[medicine]] and healing, carried [[Rod of Asclepius|a staff]] with one serpent wrapped around it, which has become the symbol of modern medicine. [[Moses#North into Canaan|Moses]] also had a replica of a serpent on a pole, the [[Nehushtan]], mentioned in Numbers 21:8.

===Vengefulness and vindictiveness===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
Following Christian tradition, serpents are connected with lies, vengefulness and vindictiveness: 
{{quote|and I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.|Genesis 3:15 NRSV}}

This connection also depends in part on the experience that venomous snakes often deliver deadly defensive bites without giving prior notice or warning to their unwitting victims. Although a snake is defending itself from the encroachment of its victim into the snake's immediate vicinity, the unannounced and deadly strike may seem unduly vengeful when measured against the unwitting victim's perceived lack of blameworthiness. 

[[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s famous short story "[[The Cask of Amontillado]]" invokes the image of the serpent as a symbol for petty vengefulness. The story is told from the point of view of the vindictive Montresor, who hatches a secret plot to murder his rival Fortunato in order to avenge real or imagined insults. Before carrying out his scheme, Montresor reveals his family's coat-of-arms to the intended victim: "A huge human foot d'or, in a field azure; the foot crushes a serpent rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel." Fortunato, not suspecting that he has offended Montresor, fails to understand the symbolic import of the coat-of-arms and blunders onward into Montresor's trap.

===African mythology===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}
[[File:Mami Wata poster.png|thumb|upright|[[Mami Wata]], important in [[African culture|African]] and [[African-American]] religions&lt;ref&gt;Jell-Bahlsen 1997, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chesi 1997, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In Africa the chief centre of serpent worship was [[Dahomey]], but the cult of the python seems to have been of exotic origin, dating back to the first quarter of the 17th century. By the conquest of Whydah the Dahomeyans were brought in contact with a people of serpent worshipers, and ended by adopting from them the beliefs which they at first despised. At Whydah, the chief centre, there is a serpent temple, tenanted by some fifty snakes. Every python of the ''danh-gbi'' kind must be treated with respect, and death is the penalty for killing one, even by accident. ''Danh-gbi'' has numerous wives, who until 1857 took part in a public procession from which the profane crowd was excluded; a python was carried round the town in a hammock, perhaps as a ceremony for the expulsion of evils. The rainbow-god of the Ashanti was also conceived to have the form of a snake. His messenger was said to be a small variety of boa, but only certain individuals, not the whole species, were sacred. In many parts of Africa the serpent is looked upon as the incarnation of deceased relatives. Among the Amazulu, as among the [[Betsileo]] of Madagascar, certain species are assigned as the abode of certain classes. The [[Maasai people|Maasai]], on the other hand, regard each species as the habitat of a particular family of the tribe.

Snake cults were well established in [[Canaanite religion]] in the [[Bronze Age]], for archaeologists have uncovered serpent [[cult object]]s in Bronze Age strata at several pre-Israelite cities in Canaan: two at [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]],&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Loud, ''Megiddo II: Plates'' plate 240: 1, 4, from Stratum X (dated by Loud 1650–1550&amp;nbsp;BCE) and Statum VIIB (dated 1250–1150&amp;nbsp;BCE), noted by Karen Randolph Joines, "The Bronze Serpent in the Israelite Cult" ''Journal of Biblical Literature'' '''87'''.3 (September 1968:245–256) p. 245 note 2.&lt;/ref&gt; one at [[Gezer]],&lt;ref&gt;R.A.S.

In the surrounding region, serpent cult objects figured in other cultures. A late Bronze Age [[Hittites|Hittite]] shrine in northern Syria contained a bronze statue of a god holding a serpent in one hand and a staff in the other.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Vieyra, ''Hittite Art 2300 - 750 B.C.'' (Alec Tiranti Ltd., London 1955) fig. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; In 6th-century [[Babylon]], a pair of bronze serpents flanked each of the four doorways of the temple of [[Esagila]].&lt;ref&gt;Leonard W.

Speiser, ''Excavations at Tepe Gawra: I. Levels I-VIII, p. 114ff., noted in Joines 1968:246 and note 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Iran===
[[File:Serpent on a jewelry box from Shahdad, Iran, 2700 BC.jpg|thumb|Serpent on a  jewelry box from Shahdad, Iran, 2700 BC]]

Snakes are sacred and powerful in the thoughts of prehistoric [[Culture of Iran|cultures of Iran]]. It seems that they have worshiped along with the [[fertility goddesses]], from fourth to first millennium BC.; We can detect their presence as mighty patrons and source of life and immortality in the art of [[Tall-i Bakun]], [[Chogha Mish]], [[Tepe Sialk]], [[Jiroft culture]], [[Shahr-e Sukhteh]], [[Shahdad]], [[Elamite]] art, [[Luristan bronze|Luristan]] art, etc. Serpents have pictured as patrons of fertility, water and wealth in the ancient objects of Iran.
However, it seems that symbolic concept of serpent has reversed in the cultures of [[Iranian plateau]] over time. In [[Abrahamic traditions]], the serpent represents sexual desire, as he lured Eve with the promise of forbidden knowledge in the Garden of Eden. Aryan religions call the serpents diabolic too; [[Zahhak|Azhi Dahake]] in [[Avesta]] is a scary serpent and [[Zahhak]] in the [[Shahnameh]] is an infernal creature with two snakes on his shoulders. This replacement might be due to communicating between the inhabitants of Iran and believers in [[Abrahamic religions]] and beyond that the conversion of matriarchy into patriarchy, in the social structure of [[Iranian plateau]] cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://jfava.ut.ac.ir/article_56378_0.html|title = Inversion of a Symbol’s concept |date = 2015|publisher = Tehran: Honarhay-e Ziba Journal, Vol. 20, No. 3. |last = Taheri|first = Sadreddin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Arab Emirates ===
[[File:Snake decoration on pot from Rumeilah, Al Ain.jpg|thumb|Snake decoration on [[Bronze Age]] pot from [[Rumailah, UAE|Rumailah]], [[Al Ain]]]]
Significant finds of pottery, bronze-ware and even gold depictions of snakes have been made throughout the [[United Arab Emirates|United Arab Emirates (UAE)]]. The [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]] metallurgical centre of [[Saruq Al Hadid Archaeological Site|Saruq Al Hadid]] has yielded probably the richest trove of such objects, although finds have been made bearing snake symbols in bronze age sites at [[Rumailah, UAE|Rumailah]], [[Al Bithnah|Bithnah]] and [[Masafi]]. Most of the depictions of snakes are similar, with a consistent dotted decoration applied to them.

Although the widespread depiction of snakes in sites across the UAE is thought by archaeologists to have a religious purpose, this remains conjecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenational.ae/uae/brushing-off-sands-of-time-at-the-archaeological-site-of-saruq-al-hadid-1.150378|title=Brushing off sands of time at the archaeological site of Saruq al-Hadid|last=Gornall|first=Jonathan|date=31 July 2016|work=The National|access-date=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
{{expand section|date=May 2015}}
In the [[Gospel of John]] 3:14–15, Jesus makes direct comparison between the raising up of the [[Son of Man]] and the act of Moses in raising up the serpent as a sign, using it as a symbol associated with [[salvation]]: "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the [[Son of Man]] be lifted up, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]]".

===Chthonic serpents and sacred trees===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}
In many myths, the [[chthonic]] serpent (sometimes a pair) lives in or is coiled around a [[Tree of Life]] situated in a divine garden. In the [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] story of the [[Torah]] and Biblical [[Old Testament]], the [[tree of the knowledge of good and evil]] is situated in the [[Garden of Eden]] together with the [[Tree of life (biblical)|tree of life]] and the [[Serpent (Bible)|Serpent]]. In Greek mythology, [[Ladon (mythology)|Ladon]] coiled around the tree in the garden of the [[Hesperides]] protecting the entheogenic golden apples.

[[File:Nidhogg.png|thumb|[[Níðhöggr]] gnaws the roots of Yggdrasil in this illustration from a 17th-century Icelandic manuscript.]]

Similarly [[Níðhöggr]] (Nidhogg Nagar), the dragon of Norse mythology, eats from the roots of the [[Yggdrasil]], the World Tree.

Under yet another Tree (the [[Bodhi tree]] of Enlightenment), the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] sat in ecstatic meditation. When a storm arose, the mighty serpent king [[Mucalinda]] rose up from his place beneath the earth and enveloped the Buddha in seven coils for seven days, so as not to break his ecstatic state.

The [[Vision Serpent]] was also a symbol of rebirth in [[Mayan mythology]], with origins going back to earlier Maya conceptions, lying at the center of the world as the Mayans conceived it. "It is in the center axis atop the [[World Tree]]. Essentially the World Tree and the Vision Serpent, representing the king, created the center axis which communicates between the spiritual and the earthly worlds or planes. It is through ritual that the king could bring the center axis into existence in the temples and create a doorway to the spiritual world, and with it power". (Schele and Friedel, 1990: 68)

[[File:Ningizzida.jpg|thumb|left|The Sumerian deity, [[Ningizzida]], is accompanied by two [[gryphons]] [[Mushussu]]; it is the oldest known image of two snakes coiling around an axial rod, dating from before 2000&amp;nbsp;BCE.]]

Sometimes the Tree of Life is represented (in a combination with similar concepts such as the World Tree and [[Axis mundi]] or "World Axis") by a staff such as those used by [[shamans]]. Examples of such staffs featuring coiled snakes in mythology are the [[caduceus]] of [[Hermes]], the [[Rod of Asclepius]], [[The Staff of Moses|the staff of Moses]], and the papyrus reeds and deity poles entwined by a single serpent [[Wadjet]], dating to earlier than 3000&amp;nbsp;BCE. The oldest known representation of ''two'' snakes entwined around a rod is that of the [[Sumerian religion|Sumerian]] fertility god [[Ningizzida]]. Ningizzida was sometimes depicted as a serpent with a human head, eventually becoming a god of healing and magic. It is the companion of [[Tammuz (deity)|Dumuzi]] (Tammuz), with whom it stood at the gate of heaven. In the [[Louvre]], there is a famous green [[steatite]] vase carved for King [[Gudea]] of [[Lagash]] (dated variously 2200–2025&amp;nbsp;BCE) with an inscription dedicated to Ningizzida. Ningizzida was the ancestor of [[Gilgamesh]], who, according to the [[Epic of Gilgamesh|epic]], dived to the bottom of the waters to retrieve the plant of life. But while he rested from his labor, a serpent came and ate the plant. The snake became immortal, and Gilgamesh was destined to die.

[[File:Featheredserpentnotchedplatevol2mississip86.png|thumb|right|Ancient North American serpent imagery often featured rattlesnakes]]

Ningizzida has been popularized in the 20th century by Raku Kei [[Reiki]] (a.k.a. "The Way of the Fire Dragon"), where "Nin Giz Zida" is believed to be a fire serpent of Tibetan rather than Sumerian origin. "Nin Giz Zida" is another name for the ancient [[Hindu]] concept [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]], a [[Sanskrit]] word meaning either "coiled up" or "coiling like a snake". "Kundalini" refers to the mothering intelligence behind yogic awakening and spiritual maturation leading to altered states of consciousness. There are a number of other translations of the term, usually emphasizing a more serpentine nature to the word—e.g. "serpent power". It has been suggested by [[Joseph Campbell]] that the symbol of snakes coiled around a staff is an ancient representation of Kundalini physiology. The staff represents the spinal column with the snake(s) being energy channels. In the case of two coiled snakes, they usually cross each other seven times, a possible reference to the seven energy centers called [[chakras]].

In [[Ancient Egypt]], where the earliest written cultural records exist, the serpent appears from the beginning to the end of their mythology.  [[Ra]] and [[Atum]] ("he who completes or perfects") became the same god, ''Atum'', the "counter-Ra," was associated with earth animals, including the serpent: [[Nehebkau]] ("he who harnesses the souls") was the two headed serpent deity who guarded the entrance to the underworld. He is often seen as the son of the snake goddess [[Renenutet]]. She often was confused with (and later was absorbed by) their primal snake goddess [[Wadjet]], the [[Egyptian cobra]], who from the earliest of records was the patron and protector of the country, all other deities, and the pharaohs. Hers is the first known [[oracle]]. She was depicted as the [[uraeus|crown]] of Egypt, entwined around the staff of papyrus and the pole that indicated the status of all other deities, as well as having the all-seeing [[eye of Horus|eye]] of wisdom and vengeance. She never lost her position in the Egyptian pantheon.

The image of the serpent as the embodiment of the wisdom transmitted by ''[[Sophia (wisdom)|Sophia]]'' was an emblem used by [[gnosticism]], especially those sects that the more orthodox characterized as "[[Ophites]]" ("Serpent People"). The chthonic serpent was one of the earth-animals associated with the cult of [[Mithras]]. The [[Basilisk]], the venomous "king of serpents" with the glance that kills, was hatched by a serpent, [[Pliny the Elder]] and others thought, from the egg of a [[rooster|cock]].

Outside Eurasia, in [[Yoruba mythology]], [[Oshunmare]] was another mythic regenerating serpent.

The [[Rainbow Serpent]] (also known as the Rainbow Snake) is a major [[mythology|mythological]] being for [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] people across [[Australia]], although the [[creation myth]] associated with it are best known from northern Australia. In Fiji [[Ratumaibulu]] was a serpent god who ruled the underworld and made fruit trees bloom. In the Northern [[Flinders Ranges]] reigns [[The Arkaroo]], serpent who drank [[Lake Frome]] empty, refuges into the mountains, carving valleys and waterholes, earthquakes through snoring.

===Cosmic serpents===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}
The serpent, when forming a ring with its tail in its mouth, is a clear and widespread symbol of the "All-in-All", the totality of existence, infinity and the cyclic nature of the cosmos. The most well known version of this is the Aegypto-Greek [[Ourobouros]]. It is believed to have been inspired by the [[Milky Way]], as some ancient texts refer to a serpent of light residing in the heavens. The Ancient Egyptians associated it with [[Wadjet]], one of their oldest deities as well as another aspect, Hathor. In [[Norse mythology]] the World Serpent (or Midgard serpent) known as [[Jörmungandr]] encircled the world in the ocean's abyss biting its own tail.

[[File:Anantavishnu.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Vishnu]] resting on Ananta-Shesha, with [[Lakshmi]] massaging his "lotus feet"]]

In [[Hindu mythology]] Lord [[Vishnu]] is said to sleep while floating on the cosmic waters on the serpent [[Shesha]]. In the [[Puranas]] Shesha holds all the planets of the universe on his hoods and constantly sings the glories of Vishnu from all his mouths. He is sometimes referred to as "Ananta-Shesha," which means "Endless Shesha". In the [[Samudra manthan]] chapter of the Puranas, Shesha loosens [[Mount Mandara]] for it to be used as a churning rod by the [[Asuras]] and [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] to churn the [[ocean of milk]] in the heavens in order to make [[Soma (drink)|Soma]] (or [[Amrita]]), the divine elixir of immortality. As a churning rope another giant serpent called [[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]] is used.

In pre-Columbian Central America Quetzalcoatl was sometimes depicted as biting its own tail. The mother of Quetzalcoatl was the Aztec goddess [[Coatlicue]] ("the one with the skirt of serpents"), also known as Cihuacoatl ("The Lady of the serpent"). [[Quetzalcoatl]]'s father was [[Mixcoatl]] ("Cloud Serpent"). He was identified with the Milky Way, the stars and the heavens in several Mesoamerican cultures.

The [[demigod]] Aidophedo of the West African [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] is also a serpent biting its own tail. In [[Dahomey mythology]] of [[Benin]] in West Africa, the serpent that supports everything on its many coils was named Dan. In the [[West African Vodun|Vodou]] of Benin and [[Haiti]] [[Ayida-Weddo]] (a.k.a. Aida-Wedo, Aido Quedo, "Rainbow-Serpent") is a spirit of fertility, rainbows and snakes, and a companion or wife to Dan, the father of all spirits. As Vodou was exported to Haiti through the slave trade Dan became [[Damballah|Danballah]], Damballah or Damballah-Wedo. Because of his association with snakes, he is sometimes disguised as Moses, who carried a snake on his staff. He is also thought by many to be the same entity of [[Saint Patrick]], known as a snake banisher.

The serpent [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]] is a star [[constellation]] representing either the serpent thrown angrily into the sky by [[Apollo]] or the [[Lernaean Hydra]] as defeated by [[Heracles]] for one of his Twelve Labors. The constellation [[Serpens]] represents a snake being tamed by [[Ophiuchus]] the snake-handler, another constellation. The most probable interpretation is that Ophiuchus represents the healer Asclepius.

Occasionally, serpents and [[dragon]]s are used interchangeably, having similar symbolic functions. The venom of the serpent is thought to have a [[Fire (classical element)|fiery quality]] similar to a fire spitting dragon. The Greek [[Ladon (mythology)|Ladon]] and the Norse [[Níðhöggr]] (Nidhogg Nagar) are sometimes described as serpents and sometimes as dragons. In [[Germanic Paganism|Germanic mythology]], ''serpent'' ([[Old English]]: ''wyrm'', [[Old High German]]: ''wurm'', [[Old Norse]]: ''ormr'') is used interchangeably with the Greek borrowing ''[[dragon]]'' (OE: ''draca'', OHG:  ''trahho'', ON: ''dreki''). In China and especially in [[Indochina]], the Indian serpent [[nāga]] was equated with the ''lóng'' or [[Chinese dragon]]. The [[Aztec]] and [[Toltec]] serpent god [[Quetzalcoatl]] also has dragon like wings, like its equivalent in [[K'iche' people|K'iche']] [[Maya mythology]] [[Q'uq'umatz]] ("feathered serpent"), which had previously existed since Classic Maya times as the deity named [[Kukulkan]].

The [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Snake Goddess]] brandished a serpent in either hand, perhaps evoking her role as source of wisdom, rather than her role as Mistress of the Animals (''[[Potnia theron]]''), with a [[leopard]] under each arm.

Serpents figured prominently in archaic Greek myths. According to some sources, [[Ophion]] ("serpent", a.k.a. Ophioneus), ruled the world with Eurynome before the two of them were cast down by Cronus and Rhea. The oracles of the Ancient Greeks were said to have been the continuation of the tradition begun with the worship of the Egyptian cobra goddess, [[Wadjet]].

[[Typhon]] the enemy of the Olympian gods is described as a vast grisly monster with a hundred heads and a hundred serpents issuing from his thighs, who was conquered and cast into [[Tartarus]] by [[Zeus]], or confined beneath volcanic regions, where he is the cause of eruptions. Typhon is thus the chthonic figuration of volcanic forces. Serpent elements figure among his offspring; among his children by Echidna are: [[Cerberus]] (a monstrous three-headed dog with a snake for a tail and a serpentine mane); the serpent-tailed [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimaera]]; the serpent-like chthonic water beast [[Lernaean Hydra]]; and the hundred-headed serpentine dragon [[Ladon (mythology)|Ladon]]. Both the Lernaean Hydra and Ladon were slain by [[Heracles]].

[[Python (mythology)|Python]] was the earth-dragon of [[Delphi]], she always was represented in the vase-paintings and by sculptors as a serpent. Pytho was the chthonic enemy of [[Apollo]], who slew her and remade her former home his own oracle, the most famous in Classical Greece.

[[Medusa]] and the other [[Gorgon]]s were vicious female monsters with sharp fangs and hair of living, venomous snakes whose origins predate the written myths of Greece and who were the protectors of the most ancient ritual secrets. The Gorgons wore a belt of two intertwined serpents in the same configuration of the [[caduceus]]. The Gorgon was placed at the center, highest point of one of the pediments on the [[Temple of Artemis, Corfu|Temple of Artemis at Corfu]].

[[Asclepius]], the son of Apollo and Koronis, learned the secrets of keeping death at bay after observing one serpent bringing another (which Asclepius himself had fatally wounded) back to life with healing herbs. To prevent the entire human race from becoming immortal under Asclepius's care, Zeus killed him with a bolt of lightning. Asclepius' death at the hands of Zeus illustrates man's inability to challenge the natural order that separates mortal men from the gods. In honor of Asclepius, snakes were often used in healing rituals. Non-poisonous snakes were left to crawl on the floor in dormitories where the sick and injured slept. The ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' claimed that [[Athena]] gave Asclepius a vial of blood from the Gorgons. Gorgon blood had magical properties: if taken from the left side of the Gorgon, it was a fatal poison; from the right side, the blood was capable of bringing the dead back to life. However, [[Euripides]] wrote in his tragedy [[Ion (play)|Ion]] that the Athenian queen Creusa had inherited this vial from her ancestor Erichthonios, who was a snake himself and had received the vial from Athena. In this version the blood of Medusa had the healing power while the lethal poison originated from Medusa's serpents.

[[Olympias]], the mother of [[Alexander the Great]] and a princess of the primitive land of [[Epirus]], had the reputation of a snake-handler, and it was in serpent form that Zeus was said to have fathered Alexander upon her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tertullian.org/rpearse/lucian/lucian_alexander.htm |title=Lucian of Samosata : Alexander the False Prophet |publisher=Tertullian.org |date=2001-08-31 |accessdate=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aeetes]], the king of [[Colchis]] and father of the sorceress [[Medea]], possessed the [[Golden Fleece]]. He guarded it with a massive serpent that never slept. Medea, who had fallen in love with [[Jason]] of the [[Argonauts]], enchanted it to sleep so Jason could seize the Fleece. (See [[Lamia (mythology)]]).

When not driven by horses, the chariot of the [[Helios|Greek sun god]] is described as being pulled by fiery draconic beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Titan/Helios.html|title=HELIUS (Helios) - Greek Titan God of the Sun (Roman Sol)|author=|date=|website=www.theoi.com|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable instance of this is observed in the episode in which [[Medea]] is given her grandfather's chariot, which is pulled by serpents through the sky.

===Jewish mythology{{anchor|Judaic and Christian symbolism}}===
[[File:Naag or serpent.jpg|thumb|upright|Naga or serpent]]
{{Main article|Serpents in the Bible|Nehushtan}}
In the [[Hebrew Bible]] the [[Serpent (Bible)|serpent]] in the [[Garden of Eden]] lured Eve with the promise of being like God, tempting her that despite God's warning, death would not be the result, that God was withholding knowledge from her. Although the serpent is identified as Satan in the [[Book of Revelation]],&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; in Genesis the serpent is portrayed merely as a deceptive creature or [[trickster]], promoting as good what God had directly forbidden, and particularly cunning in its deception (Gen. 3:4–5 and 3:22).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen%203%3A4&amp;version=AMP;NKJV https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen+3%3A22&amp;version=AMP;NKJV&lt;/ref&gt; 

The staff of [[Moses]] transformed into a snake and then back into a staff ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 4:2–4). The [[Book of Numbers]] 21:6–9 provides an origin for an [[Nehushtan|archaic copper serpent, ''Nehushtan'']] by associating it with Moses. This copper snake according to the Biblical text is wrapped around a pole and used for healing. Book of Numbers 21:9 "And Moses made a snake of copper, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a snake had bitten any man, when he beheld the snake of brass, he lived."

When the reformer [[King Hezekiah]] came to the throne of Judah in the late 8th century&amp;nbsp;BCE, "He removed the high places, broke the sacred pillars, smashed the idols, and broke into pieces the copper snake that Moses had made: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he called it [[Nehushtan]]. ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:4|KJV}})

===Nagas===
[[Image:Naga182.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Hoysala]] sculpture of a Naga couple, [[Halebidu]] ]]
{{Main article|Nāga}}
''Naga'' ([[Sanskrit]]:नाग) is the [[Sanskrit]]/[[Pāli]] word for a deity or class of entity or being, taking the form of a very large snake, found in [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. The naga primarily represents rebirth, death and mortality, due to its casting of its skin and being symbolically "reborn".

[[Brahmins]] associated ''naga'' with [[Shiva]] and with [[Vishnu]], who rested on a [[Shesha|100 headed ''naga'']] coiled around Shiva’s neck. The snake represented freedom in [[Hindu mythology]] because they cannot be tamed.

====Nagas of Indochina====
Serpents, or [[nāga]]s, play a particularly important role in [[Cambodia]]n, [[Isan]] and [[Laos|Laotian]] mythology. An [[origin myth]] explains the emergence of the name "Cambodia" as resulting from conquest of a naga princess by a [[Kambuja#Sri Lanka|Kambuja]] lord named [[Kaundinya]]: the descendants of their union are the [[Khmer people]].&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, ''A History of Cambodia'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; George Coedès suggests the Cambodian myth is a basis for the legend of [[Rocket Festival#Nang Ai, Phadaeng, and Phangkhi|"Phra Daeng Nang Ai"]], in which a woman who has lived many previous lives in the region is reincarnated as a daughter of Phraya Khom (Thai for Cambodian,) and causes the death of her companion in former lives who has been reincarnated as a prince of the Nagas. This leads to war between the "spirits of the air" and the Nagas: Nagas amok are rivers in spate, and the entire region is flooded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=  Coedès|first= George|editor= Walter F.

===Native American mythology===
In America some of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes{{which|date=June 2015}} give reverence to the rattlesnake as grandfather and king of snakes who is able to give fair winds or cause tempest. Among the [[Hopi]] of [[Arizona]] the serpent figures largely in one of the dances. The rattlesnake was worshiped in the [[Natchez people|Natchez]] temple of the sun and the [[Aztec]] deity [[Quetzalcoatl]] was a feathered serpent-god. In many Meso-American cultures, the serpent was regarded as a portal between two worlds. The tribes of [[Peru]] are said to have adored great snakes in the pre-Inca days and in [[Chile]] the [[Mapuche]] made a serpent figure in their deluge beliefs.

A [[Horned Serpent]] is a popular image in Northern American natives' mythology.

In one Native North American story, an evil serpent kills one of the gods' cousins, so the god kills the serpent in revenge, but the dying serpent unleashes a great flood. People first flee to the mountains and then, when the mountains are covered, they float on a raft until the flood subsides. The evil spirits that the serpent god controlled then hide out of fear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indians.org/welker/greatflo.htm |title=Great Serpent and the Great Flood |publisher=Indians.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mound builder (people)|Mound Builders]] associated great mystical value to the serpent, as the [[Serpent Mound]] demonstrates, though we are unable to unravel the particular associations.

===Nordic mythology===
{{See also|Jörmungandr}}
[[Jörmungandr]], alternately referred to as the [[Midgard Serpent]] or [[Midgard Serpent|World Serpent]], is a [[sea serpent]] of the [[Norse mythology]], the middle child of [[Loki]] and the [[Jötunn|giantess]] [[Angrboða]].

According to the [[Prose Edda]], [[Odin]] took [[Loki]]'s three children, [[Fenrisúlfr]], [[Hel (being)|Hel]] and Jörmungandr. He tossed Jörmungandr into the great ocean that encircles [[Midgard]]. The serpent grew so big that he was able to surround the [[Yggdrasil|Earth]] and grasp his own tail, and as a result he earned the alternate name of the Midgard Serpent or World Serpent. Jörmungandr's arch enemy is the god [[Thor]].

In the [[Poetic Edda]], Odin tells of 8 serpents gnawing on the roots of [[Yggdrasil]]: [[Nidhöggr]], Gravvitnir, Moin, Goin, Grábakr, Grafvölluðr, Svafnir and Ofnir.

===Sea serpents===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}
[[Sea serpent]]s were giant [[cryptozoological]] creatures once believed to live in water, whether [[sea monster]]s such as the [[Leviathan]] or [[lake monster]]s such as the [[Loch Ness Monster]]. If they were referred to as "[[sea snake]]s", they were understood to be the actual snakes that live in Indo-Pacific waters (Family [[Hydrophiidae]]).

==Modern symbolism==

===Modern medicine===
{{See also|Caduceus as a symbol of medicine}}
[[File:Star of life2.svg|thumb|upright|The [[Star of Life]] features a Rod of Asclepius]]

Snakes entwined the staffs both of [[Hermes]] (the [[caduceus]]) and of [[Rod of Asclepius|Asclepius]], where a single snake entwined the rough staff. On Hermes' caduceus, the snakes were not merely duplicated for symmetry, they were paired opposites. (This motif is congruent with the [[phurba]].) The wings at the head of the staff identified it as belonging to the winged messenger, Hermes, the Roman Mercury, who was the god of magic, diplomacy and [[rhetoric]], of inventions and discoveries, the protector both of merchants and that allied occupation, to the mythographers' view, of thieves. It is however Hermes' role as [[psychopomp]], the escort of newly deceased souls to the afterlife, that explains the origin of the snakes in the caduceus since this was also the role of the Sumerian entwined serpent god [[Ningizzida]], with whom Hermes has sometimes been equated.

In [[Late Antiquity]], as the arcane study of [[alchemy]] developed, Mercury was understood to be the protector of those arts too and of arcane or occult "Hermetic' information in general. Chemistry and medicines linked the rod of Hermes with the staff of the healer Asclepius, which was wound with a serpent; it was conflated with Mercury's rod, and the modern medical symbol—which should simply be the rod of Asclepius—often became Mercury's wand of commerce. Another version is used in alchemy whereas the snake is crucified, known as [[Nicolas Flamel]]'s caduceus. Art historian Walter J. Friedlander, in ''The Golden Wand of Medicine: A History of the Caduceus Symbol in Medicine'' (1992) collected hundreds of examples of the caduceus and the rod of Asclepius and found that professional associations were just somewhat more likely to use the staff of Asclepius, while commercial organizations in the medical field were more likely to use the caduceus.

===Modern political propaganda===
Following the Christian context as a symbol for evil, serpents are sometimes featured in political [[propaganda]]. They were used to represent Jews in [[Antisemitism|antisemitic propaganda]]. Snakes were also used to represent the evil side of drugs in such films as ''Narcotic''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121587/|title=Narcotic|author=|date=1 March 1934|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2018|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Narcotics: Pit of Despair''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Narcotic1967 |title=Narcotics: Pit of Despair (Part I) : Marshall (Mel) : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Evolutionary origins==
The anthropologist Lynn Isbell has argued that, as primates, the serpent as a symbol of death is built into our unconscious minds because of our evolutionary history. Isbell argues that for millions of years snakes were the only significant predators of primates, and that this explains why fear of snakes is one of the most common phobias worldwide and why the symbol of the serpent is so prevalent in world mythology; the serpent is an innate image of danger and death.&lt;ref name=Isbell&gt;[[#refIsbellL|Isbell, ''The Fruit, the Tree, and the Serpent'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Haycock&gt;[[#refHaycockDE|Haycock, ''Being and Perceiving'']]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Furthermore, the psychoanalyst Joseph Lewis Henderson and the ethnologist Maude Oakes have argued that the serpent is a symbol of initiation and rebirth precisely because it is a symbol of death.&lt;ref name=Henderson&gt;[[#refHendersonJL|Henderson, ''The Wisdom of the Serpent'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sickened: The Memoir of a Münchausen by Proxy Childhood''''' is a 2003 autobiographical account by [[Julie Gregory]] of the [[Münchausen syndrome by proxy]] [[child abuse]] inflicted on her by her mother.

==Contents==
Gregory's mother frequently took her to various doctors, coaching her to act sicker than she was and exaggerating her [[symptoms]], and demanding increasingly invasive procedures to [[medical diagnosis|diagnose]] the girl's imaginary illnesses. At home, her mother fed Gregory a diet based on foods a doctor had said Gregory shouldn't have, administered prescription medicine erratically, sometimes in double doses, and filled her days with strenuous physical labor. According to Gregory, her mother even became upset when one doctor would not perform [[open heart surgery]] on her daughter.

When Gregory realized what her mother was doing to her, she tried telling people about it, but no one listened. They thought she was making up stories to gain attention, and had her go to "imagination counseling" to try to tame her from telling crazy stories of her parents. 

The memoir also alleges [[physical abuse|physical]] and [[emotional abuse]] inflicted by Gregory's father.

==Reception==
''Sickened'' was published in over 20 countries and was named Book Of The Year by ''The Sunday London Times''. It was an editor’s pick in ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', as well as being one of their top ten books of the year.

Official government estimates are that in certain regions between one in ten and one in three indigenous Australian children were forcibly taken from their families and communities between 1910 and 1970.

==Emergence of the child removal policy==
Numerous 19th- and early 20th-century contemporaneous documents indicate that the policy of removing mixed-race Aboriginal children from their mothers related to an assumption that the Aborigines were dying off. Given their catastrophic population decline after white contact&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/ABS@.NSF/2f762f95845417aeca25706c00834efa/bfc28642d31c215cca256b350010b3f4!OpenDocument|website=www.abs.gov.au|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|accessdate=30 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, whites assumed that the full-blood [[tribe|tribal]] Aboriginal population would be unable to sustain itself, and was doomed to [[extinction]]. The idea expressed by [[A. O. Neville]], the [[Chief Protector of Aborigines]] for [[Western Australia]], and others as late as 1930 was that mixed-race children could be trained to work in white society, and over generations would marry white and be assimilated into the society.&lt;ref&gt;Neville, AO (1930). ''West Australian'', 18 April.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;Western Australia State Archives, 993/423/38, "Absorption of Half Castes into the White Population".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russell McGregor, ''Imagined Destinies. Aboriginal Australians and the Doomed Race Theory, 1900–1972'', Melbourne: MUP, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[European Australians]] considered any proliferation of mixed-descent children (labelled "half-castes", "crossbreeds", "[[quadroon]]s", and "[[octoroon]]s",&lt;ref name="ref1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt;{{rp|231, 308}} terms now considered derogatory to indigenous Australians) to be a threat to the stability of the prevailing culture, or to a perceived racial or cultural "heritage".&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Warwick|title=The Cultivation of Whiteness: Science, health and racial destiny in Australia|date=2003|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=0-46-500305-2|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|160}} The Northern Territory Chief Protector of Aborigines, Dr. [[Cecil Cook (Australia)|Cecil Cook]], argued that "everything necessary [must be done] to convert the half-caste into a white citizen".&lt;ref name="Northern Territory"&gt;{{cite web |title=The History: Northern Territory |publisher=Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission |location=Sydney, Australia |date=December 2007 |url=http://www.humanrights.gov.au/education/bth/download/laws/bth_laws_histnt_10r.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226224620/http://www.humanrights.gov.au/education/bth/download/laws/bth_laws_histnt_10r.pdf |archivedate=26 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northern Territory===
In the [[Northern Territory]], the segregation of Indigenous Australians of mixed descent from "full-blood" indigenous people began with the government removing children of mixed descent from their communities and placing them in church-run missions, and later creating segregated reserves and compounds to hold all Indigenous Australians. This was a response to public concern over the increase in the number of mixed-descent children and sexual exploitation of young Aboriginal women by non-Indigenous men, as well as fears among non-indigenous people of being outnumbered by a mixed-descent population.&lt;ref name="Northern Territory"/&gt;

Under the [[Northern Territory Aboriginals Act]] of 1906, The Chief Protector of Aborigines was appointed the "legal guardian of every Aboriginal and every half-caste child up to the age of 18 years", thus providing the legal basis for enforcing segregation. After the Commonwealth took control of the Territory, under the 1918 [[Aborigines Ordinance]], the Chief Protector was given total control of all Indigenous women regardless of their age, unless married to a man who was "substantially of European origin", and his approval was required for any marriage of an indigenous woman to a non-indigenous man.&lt;ref name="Northern Territory"/&gt;

==Policy in practice==
The [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] [[Aboriginal Protection Act 1869]] included the earliest legislation to authorise child removal from Aboriginal parents. The Central Board for the Protection of Aborigines had been advocating such powers since 1860. Passage of the Act gave the colony of Victoria a wide suite of powers over Aboriginal and "half-caste" persons, including the forcible removal of children, especially "at risk" girls.&lt;ref&gt;M.F. Christie, ''Aboriginal People in Colonial Victoria, 1835–86'', pp. 175–176.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the late 19th and early 20th century, similar policies and legislation were adopted by other states and territories, such as the [[Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act 1897]] (Qld), the Aborigines Ordinance 1918 (NT), the Aborigines Act 1934 (SA), and the 1936 Native Administration Act (WA).&lt;ref name="stolen62"/&gt;

As a result of such legislation, states arranged widespread removal of (primarily) mixed-race children from their Aboriginal mothers. In addition, appointed Aboriginal protectors in each state exercised wide-ranging [[Legal guardian|guardianship]] powers over Aborigines up to the age of 16 or 21, often determining where they could live or work. Policemen or other agents of the state (some designated as "Aboriginal Protection Officers") were given the power to locate and transfer babies and children of mixed descent from their mothers, families, and communities into institutions for care. In these Australian states and territories, institutions (both government and missionary) for half-caste children were established in the early decades of the 20th century to care and educate the mixed-race children taken from their families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tim-richardson.net/joomla15/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=29:the-stolen-generations-robert-manne&amp;catid=67:opinion&amp;Itemid=72 Tim Richardson on ''The Stolen Generations: Robert Manne''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724105956/http://www.tim-richardson.net/joomla15/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=29%3Athe-stolen-generations-robert-manne&amp;catid=67%3Aopinion&amp;Itemid=72 |date=24 July 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of such institutions include [[Moore River Native Settlement]] in Western Australia, [[Doomadgee, Queensland|Doomadgee Aboriginal Mission]] in [[Queensland]], [[Ebenezer Mission]] in Victoria, and [[Wellington Valley Mission]] in [[New South Wales]], as well as Catholic missions such as [[Beagle Bay Community|Beagle Bay]] and [[Pirlangimpi|Garden Point]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/franklinmissions.pdf|author=J. Franklin|title=Catholic missions to aboriginal Australia: an evaluation of their overall effect|work=Journal of the Australian Catholic Historical Society|date=2016|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact number of children removed is unknown. Estimates of numbers have been widely disputed. The ''[[Bringing Them Home]]'' report says that "at least 100,000" children were removed from their parents. This figure was estimated by multiplying the Aboriginal population in 1994 (303,000), by the report's maximum estimate of "one in three" Aboriginal persons separated from their families. The report stated that "between one in three and one in ten" children were separated from their families. Given differing populations over a long period of time, different policies at different times in different states (which also resulted in different definitions of target children), and incomplete records, accurate figures are difficult to establish.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} The academic [[Robert Manne]] has stated that the lower-end figure of one in 10 is more likely; he estimates that between 20,000 and 25,000 Aboriginal children were removed over six decades, based on a survey of self-identified indigenous people by the television station [[ABS (TV station)|ABS]].&lt;ref name="Flood 2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Flood |first=Josephine |title=The Original Australians: Story of the Aboriginal People |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h0Ph5GLwWOQC |year=2006 |publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin |location=Crows Nest, NSW |isbn=1-74114-872-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|232}} According to the ''Bringing Them Home'' report: 

{{quote|In certain regions and in certain periods the figure was undoubtedly much greater than one in ten. In that time not one Indigenous family has escaped the effects of forcible removal (confirmed by representatives of the Queensland and WA [Western Australia] Governments in evidence to the Inquiry).

The report closely examined the distinctions between "forcible removal", "removal under threat or duress", "official deception", "uninformed voluntary release", and "voluntary release".&lt;ref name="Scope of Inquiry"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/IndigLRes/stolen/stolen04.html |author=Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission |title=Indigenous Law Resources: Bringing them Home: Part 1: Scope of the Inquiry |publisher=Australasian Legal Information Institute |date=1997 |accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence indicated that in numerous cases, children were brutally and forcibly removed from their parent or parents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/IndigLRes/stolen/stolen06.html|title=Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission: Bringing them Home: Part 2: Tracing the History|via=AustLII|date=1997|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly even from the hospital shortly after birth, when identified as mixed-race babies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/IndigLRes/stolen/stolen13.html|title=Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission: Bringing Them Home: Part 2: 7 Western Australia|via=AustLII|date=1997|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aboriginal Protection Officers often made the judgement to remove certain children. In some cases, families were required to sign legal documents to relinquish care to the state. In Western Australia, the ''Aborigines Act 1905'' removed the legal guardianship of Aboriginal parents. It made all their children legal [[Ward (law)|wards]] of the state, so the government did not require parental permission to relocate the mixed-race children to institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-55208686/view?partId=nla.obj-55209481|title=The Acts of the Parliament of Western Australia: Aborigines Act of 1905|publisher=National Library of Australia|date=23 December 1905|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915, in New South Wales, the ''Aborigines Protection Amending Act 1915'' gave the [[Aboriginal Protection Board|Aborigines' Protection Board]] authority to remove Aboriginal children "without having to establish in court that they were neglected." At the time, some members of Parliament objected to the NSW amendment; one member stated it enabled the Board to "steal the child away from its parents." At least two members argued that the amendment would result in children being subjected to unpaid labour (at institutions or farms) tantamount to "slavery".&lt;ref name=humanrights1/&gt; Writing in the 21st century, Professor Peter Read said that Board members, in recording reasons for removal of children, noted simply "For being Aboriginal."&lt;ref name=humanrights1/&gt; But the number of files bearing such a comment appear to be on the order of either one or two, with two others being noted only with "Aboriginal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Read|first=Peter|title=Don't let facts spoil this historian's campaign|work=The Australian|date=18 February 2008|accessdate=18 February 2008|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23229208-7583,00.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218052203/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0%2C25197%2C23229208-7583%2C00.html|archivedate=18 February 2008|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, the Protector of Aborigines in [[South Australia]], William Garnet South, reportedly "lobbied for the power to remove Aboriginal children without a court hearing because the courts sometimes refused to accept that the children were neglected or destitute." South argued that "all children of mixed descent should be treated as neglected."&lt;ref name=stolen14&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/IndigLRes/stolen/stolen14.html|title=Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission: Bringing them Home: Part 2: 8 South Australia|via=AustLII|date=1997|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His lobbying reportedly played a part in the enactment of the ''Aborigines Act 1911.'' This designated his position as the legal guardian of every Aboriginal child in South Australia, not only the so-called "half-castes".&lt;ref name=stolen14/&gt;

The ''Bringing Them Home'' report identified instances of official misrepresentation and deception, such as when caring and able parents were incorrectly described by Aboriginal Protection Officers as not being able to properly provide for their children. In other instances, parents were told by government officials that their child or children had died, even though this was not the case. One first-hand account referring to events in 1935 stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was at the post office with my Mum and Auntie [and cousin]. They put us in the police ute and said they were taking us to Broome. They put the mums in there as well. But when we'd gone [about {{convert|10|mi|km|spell=in}}] they stopped, and threw the mothers out of the car. We jumped on our mothers' backs, crying, trying not to be left behind. But the policemen pulled us off and threw us back in the car. They pushed the mothers away and drove off, while our mothers were chasing the car, running and crying after us. We were screaming in the back of that car. When we got to Broome they put me and my cousin in the Broome lock-up. We were only ten years old. We were in the lock-up for two days waiting for the boat to Perth.&lt;ref name="Scope of Inquiry"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The report discovered that removed children were, in most cases, placed into institutional facilities operated by religious or charitable organisations. A significant number, particularly females, were "fostered" out. Children taken to such institutions were trained to be assimilated to Anglo-Australian culture. Policies included punishment for speaking their local indigenous languages. The intention was to educate them for a different future and to prevent their being [[Socialization|socialised]] in [[Australian Aboriginal culture|Aboriginal cultures]]. The boys were generally trained as agricultural labourers and the girls as [[Domestic worker|domestic servants]]; these were the chief occupations of many Europeans at the time in the largely rural areas outside cities.&lt;ref name="stolen62"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/IndigLRes/stolen/stolen62.html|title=Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission: Bringing them Home: Appendices|via=AustLII|date=1997|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common aspect of the removals was the failure by these institutions to keep records of the actual parentage of the child, or such details as the date or place of birth. As is stated in the report:
&lt;blockquote&gt;the physical infrastructure of missions, government institutions and children's homes was often very poor and resources were insufficient to improve them or to keep the children adequately clothed, fed and sheltered.&lt;ref name="stolen18"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The children were taken into care purportedly to protect them from neglect and abuse. However, the report said that, among the 502 inquiry witnesses, 17% of female witnesses and 7.7% of male witnesses reported having suffered a [[sexual assault]] while in an institution, at work, or while living with a foster or adoptive family.&lt;ref name="stolen18"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/IndigLRes/stolen/stolen18.html|title=Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission: Bringing them Home: Part 3: 10 Childrens Experiences|via=AustLII|date=1997|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Documentary evidence, such as newspaper articles and reports to [[parliamentary committee]]s, suggest a range of rationales. Apparent motivations included the belief that the Aboriginal people would die out,{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} given their catastrophic population decline after white contact, the belief that they were heathens and were better off in non-indigenous households,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wahlquist|first=Calla|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/may/25/australias-stolen-generations-a-legacy-of-intergenerational-pain-and-broken-bonds|title=Australia's stolen generations: a legacy of intergenerational pain and broken bonds|newspaper=The Guardian|date=25 May 2017|accessdate=9 October 2017|quote=We were taken off our mother, we were told that we were taken off her because she was a heathen, she was not capable of looking after us ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the belief that full-blooded Aboriginal people resented [[miscegenation]] and the mixed-race children fathered and abandoned by white men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Passing of the Aborigines: A Lifetime Spent among the Natives of Australia |date=1938 |url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks04/0400661.txt |last=Bates |first=Daisy |authorlink=Daisy Bates (Australia) |publisher=Project Gutenberg of Australia |quote=Half-castes came among them, a being neither black nor white, whom they detested [...] I did what I set out to do{{em dash}}to make their passing easier and to keep the dreaded half-caste menace from our great continent.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=March 2017}}

==Effects on members of the Stolen Generations==
The stated aim of the "resocialisation" programme was to improve the integration of Aboriginal people into modern [European-Australian] society, however a recent study conducted in [[Melbourne]] reported that there was no tangible improvement in the social position of "removed" Aboriginal people as compared to "non-removed". Particularly in the areas of employment and post-secondary education, the removed children had about the same results as those who were not removed. In the early decades of the program, post-secondary education was limited for most Australians, but the removed children lagged behind their white contemporaries as educational opportunities improved.&lt;ref name="Bereson1989"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bereson|first=Itiel|title=Decades of Change: Australia in the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tUKNAAAACAAJ|year=1989|publisher=Heinemann Educational Australia|location=Richmond, Victoria|isbn=978-0-85859-483-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study indicated that removed Aboriginal people were less likely to have completed a secondary education, three times as likely to have acquired a police record, and were twice as likely to use illicit drugs as were Aboriginal people who grew up in their ethnic community.&lt;ref name="Bereson1989"/&gt; The only notable advantage "removed" Aboriginal people achieved was a higher average income. The report noted this was likely due to the increased urbanisation of removed individuals, and greater access to welfare payments than for Aboriginal people living in remote communities.&lt;ref name="Bereson1989"/&gt; There seemed little evidence that removed mixed-race Aborigines had been successful in gaining better work even in urbanised areas.

By around the age of 18, the children were released from government control. In cases where their files were available, individuals were sometimes allowed to view their own files. According to the testimony of one Aboriginal person:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was requested to attend at the Sunshine Welfare Offices, where they formerly (sic) discharged me from State ward ship. It took the Senior Welfare Officer a mere 20 minutes to come clean, and tell me everything that my heart had always wanted to know...that I was of "Aboriginal descent", that I had a Natural mother, father, three brothers and a sister, who were alive...He placed in front of me 368 pages of my file, together with letters, photos and birthday cards. He informed me that my surname would change back to my Mother's maiden name of Angus.&lt;ref&gt;Confidential submission 133, Victoria.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Bringing Them Home'' report condemned the policy of disconnecting children from their "cultural heritage".{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} One witness said to the commission:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I've got everything that could be reasonably expected: a good home environment, education, stuff like that, but that's all material stuff. It's all the non-material stuff that I didn't have&amp;nbsp;— the lineage... You know, you've just come out of nowhere; there you are.&lt;ref name="Scope of Inquiry"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2015, many of the recommendations of ''Bringing Them Home'' were yet to be fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=http://apo.org.au/system/files/54628/apo-nid54628-86971.pdf |title=Bringing them home: Scorecard Report 2015 |last1=Rule |first1=John |last2=Rice |first2=Elizabeth |location=Canberra |publisher=National Sorry Day Committee Inc. |date=28 February 2015 |accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, 35% of all children in out-of-home care in Australia identify as being Aboriginal, an increase from 20% in 1997 when ''Bringing Them Home'' was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/may/23/too-many-indigenous-children-are-taken-from-their-families-it-doesnt-have-to-happen |title=Too many Indigenous children are taken from their families – it doesn't have to happen |last1=Sarra |first1=Chris |location=Canberra |newspaper=The Guardian |date=23 May 2017 |accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Examples? discussion --&gt;

==Public awareness and recognition==
{{Specific|section|date=March 2017}}
Historian Professor [[Peter Read (historian)|Peter Read]], then at the [[Australian National University]], was the first to use the phrase "stolen generation". He published a magazine article on the topic with this title, based on his research. He expanded the article into a book, ''The Stolen Generations'' (1981).&lt;ref name=read/&gt; Widespread awareness of the Stolen Generations, and the practices which created it, grew in the late 1980s through the efforts of Aboriginal and white [[activism|activists]], artists, and [[:Category:Indigenous Australian musicians|musicians]] ([[Archie Roach]]'s "[[Took the Children Away]]" and [[Midnight Oil]]'s "[[The Dead Heart]]" being examples of the latter). The ''[[Mabo v Queensland (No 2)]]'' case (commonly known as the ''Mabo case'') attracted great media and public attention to itself and to all issues related to the government treatment of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders in Australia, and most notably the Stolen Generations.

In early 1995, [[Rob Riley (Aboriginal activist)|Rob Riley]], an activist with the [[Aboriginal Legal Service]], published ''Telling Our Story.'' It described the large-scale negative effects of past government policies that resulted in the removal of thousands of mixed-race Aboriginal children from their families and their being reared in a variety of conditions in missions, orphanages, reserves, and white foster homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.als.org.au/Publications/|title=Publications|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216184649/http://www.als.org.au/Publications/|archivedate=16 February 2008|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian [[Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission]]'s ''National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families'' commenced in May 1995, presided over by the Commission's president Sir [[Ronald Wilson]] and its Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner [[Mick Dodson]]. During the ensuing 17 months, the Inquiry visited every state and Territory in Australia, heard testimony from 535 Aboriginal Australians, and received submissions of evidence from more than 600 more. In April 1997, the Commission released its official ''Bringing Them Home'' report.

Between the commissioning of the National Inquiry and the release of the final report in 1997, the government of [[John Howard]] had replaced the [[Paul Keating]] government. At the Australian Reconciliation Convention in May 1997, Howard was quoted as saying: "Australians of this generation should not be required to accept guilt and blame for past actions and policies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/IndigLRes/car/1997/3/speeches/opening/howard.htm|last=Howard|first=John|author-link=John Howard|date=27 May 1997|title=Opening Ceremony Speeches: ... The Prime Minister, ''Australian Reconciliation Convention''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following publication of the report, the parliament of the Northern Territory and the state parliaments of Victoria, South Australia, and New South Wales passed formal apologies to the Aborigines affected. On 26 May 1998, the first "[[National Sorry Day]]" was held; reconciliation events were held nationally, and attended by a total of more than one million people. As public pressure continued to increase on the government, Howard drafted a motion of "deep and sincere regret over the removal of Aboriginal children from their parents", which was passed by the federal parliament in August 1999. Howard said that the Stolen Generation represented "the most blemished chapter in the history of this country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/stories/s115691.htm|title=No stolen generation: Australian Govt|work=[[The 7.30 Report]] ([[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]])|date=3 April 2000|accessdate=24 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160907130536/http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/stories/s115691.htm#|archive-date=7 September 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activists took the issue of the Stolen Generations to the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]]. At its hearing on this subject in July 2000, the Commission on Human Rights strongly criticised the Howard government for its handling of issues related to the Stolen Generations. The UN [[Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]] concluded its discussion of Australia's 12th report on its actions&lt;ref&gt;Paragraphs 104–114 of report at [http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu2/6/cerd/cerds56.htm#56th UNHCHR.ch] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703172827/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu2/6/cerd/cerds56.htm#56th |date=3 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by acknowledging "the measures taken to facilitate family reunion and to improve counselling and family support services for the victims", but expressed concern: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;that the Commonwealth Government does not support a formal national apology and that it considers inappropriate the provision of monetary compensation for those forcibly and unjustifiably separated from their families, on the grounds that such practices were sanctioned by law at the time and were intended to "assist the people whom they affected".&lt;/blockquote&gt;The Committee recommended "that the State party consider the need to address appropriately the extraordinary harm inflicted by these racially discriminatory practices."&lt;ref&gt;Concluding Observations by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination : Australia. 19 April 2000.

Activists highlighted the Stolen Generations and related Aboriginal issues during the Sydney [[2000 Summer Olympics]]. They set up a large "Aboriginal Tent City" on the grounds of [[University of Sydney|Sydney University]] to bring attention to Aboriginal issues in general. [[Cathy Freeman]] is an Aboriginal athlete who was chosen to light the [[Olympic flame]] and won the [[Olympic medal|gold medal]] in the 400 metre sprint. In interviews, she said that her own grandmother was a victim of forced removal. The internationally successful rock group [[Midnight Oil]] attracted worldwide media interest by performing at the [[2000 Summer Olympics closing ceremony|Olympic closing ceremony]] in black sweatsuits with the word "SORRY" emblazoned across them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Bernard|last=Zuel|authorlink=Bernard Zuel|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/12/03/1038712934982.html|title=The sun sets on Midnight Oil|newspaper=[[The Age]]|date=4 December 2002|accessdate=24 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021220192648/http://theage.com.au/articles/2002/12/03/1038712934982.html|archivedate=20 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, [[Phillip Knightley]] summed up the Stolen Generations in these terms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This cannot be over-emphasized—the Australian government literally kidnapped these children from their parents as a matter of policy. White welfare officers, often supported by police, would descend on Aboriginal camps, round up all the children, separate the ones with light-coloured skin, bundle them into trucks and take them away. If their parents protested they were held at bay by police.&lt;ref name="Knightley2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Knightley|first=Phillip|authorlink=Phillip Knightley|title=Australia: A Biography of a Nation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I72ZsVtpxcUC&amp;pg=PA113|year=2001|publisher=Vintage|isbn=978-0-09-977291-0|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the archaeologist and writer [[Josephine Flood]], "The well-meaning but ill-conceived policy of forced assimilation of mixed-race Aborigines is now universally condemned for the trauma and loss of language and culture it brought to the stolen children and their families."{{refn|name=Flood 2006}}{{rp|233}}

One of the recommendations of the 1997 [[Bringing Them Home]] report was for Australian parliaments to offer an official apology. A decade later, on 13 February 2008, [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Kevin Rudd]] presented an apology to Indigenous Australians as a [[motion (parliamentary procedure)|motion]] to be voted on by the house. The apology text was as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ping|last=Lo|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2008/02/12/2160871.htm|title=The words Rudd will use to say 'sorry'|newspaper=abc.net.au|date=12 February 2008|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Dylan|last=Welch|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/rudd-says-sorry/2008/02/13/1202760342960.html|title=Kevin Rudd says sorry|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=13 February 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227111927/http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/rudd-says-sorry/2008/02/13/1202760342960.html|archivedate=27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text of the apology did not refer to compensation to Aboriginal people as a whole, nor to members of the Stolen Generations specifically. Rudd followed the apology with a 20-minute speech to the house about the need for this action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/02/13/2162134.htm |title=Video: Watch Kevin Rudd's full apology|accessdate=14 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fullspeech"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23206474-661,00.html|title=Full text of Kevin Rudd's speech|accessdate=14 February 2008|work=News Limited|date=13 February 2008|archivedate=17 February 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217222532/http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0%2C21985%2C23206474-661%2C00.html|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government's apology and his speech were widely applauded among both Indigenous Australians and the non-indigenous general public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/thunderous-applause-in-sydney-for-rudds-speech/2008/02/13/1202760345966.html "Thunderous applause in Sydney for Rudd's speech"], Australian Associated Press, ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 13 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKenny, Leesha, [http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/speech-gets-standing-ovation-in-redfern/2008/02/13/1202760352322.html "Speech gets standing ovation in Redfern"], ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 13 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition leader [[Brendan Nelson]] also delivered a 20-minute speech. He endorsed the apology but in his speech Nelson referred to the "under-policing" of [[child welfare]] in Aboriginal communities, as well as a host of social ills blighting the lives of Aboriginal people. His speech was considered controversial and received mixed reactions. Thousands of people who had gathered in public spaces in around Australia to hear the apology turned their backs on the screens that broadcast Nelson speaking. In [[Perth]], people booed and jeered until the screen was switched off. In Parliament House's Great Hall, elements of the audience began a [[slow clap]], with some finally turning their backs.&lt;ref name=backturn&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/fury-over-nelsons-sorry-reply/2008/02/13/1202760367682.html|title=Fury over Nelson's 'sorry' response|work=The Age|date=13 February 2008|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status and compensation==
The legal circumstances regarding the Stolen Generations remain unclear. Although some compensation claims are pending, a court cannot rule on behalf of plaintiffs simply because they were removed, because, at the time, such removals were authorised under [[Law of Australia|Australian law]]. Australian federal and state governments' [[statute law]] and associated regulations provided for the removal from their birth families and communities of known mixed-race Aboriginal children, or those who visibly appeared mixed.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

Compensation claims have been heard by the NSW Supreme Court's Court of Appeal in ''Williams v The Minister Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983 and New South Wales'' [2000] NSWCA 255 and the Australian Federal Court in ''Cubillo v Commonwealth of Australia'' [2000] FCA 1084. In ''Williams'', an individual (rather than a group of plaintiffs) made claims in negligence arising from having been placed under the control of the Aborigines Welfare Board pursuant to s 7(2) of the ''Aborigines Welfare Act 1909'' shortly after her birth, and was placed by the Board with the [[United Aborigines Mission]] at its Aborigines Children Home at Bomaderry near Nowra, NSW. The trial judge found that there was no duty of care and therefore that an action in negligence could not succeed.{{Explain|date=May 2017}} This was upheld by the NSW Court of Appeal in 2000.

In relation to whether the action in NSW courts was limited by the passage of time, the Court of Appeal, reversing Studdert J, extended the limitation period for the non-equitable claims by about three decades pursuant to s 60G of the Limitation Act 1969 (NSW): Williams v Minister, Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983 (1994) 35 NSWLR 497.

The apology is not expected to have any legal effect on claims for compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/02/13/2161485.htm|title=Apology will not legally impact compo claims: Law Society|publisher=ABC News|date=13 February 2008|archivedate=2 March 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302062445/http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/02/13/2161485.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical debate over the Stolen Generations==
===Nomenclature and debate over the use of the word "stolen"===
The word "stolen" is used here to refer to the Aboriginal children having been taken away from their families. It has been in use for this since the early 20th century. For instance, [[Patrick McGarry]], a member of the [[Parliament of New South Wales]], objected to the ''Aborigines Protection Amending Act 1915'' which authorised the Aborigines' Protection Board to remove Aboriginal children from their parents without having to establish cause. McGarry described the policy as "steal[ing] the child away from its parents".&lt;ref name=humanrights1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/IndigLRes/stolen/stolen09.html|title=Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission: Bringing them Home: Part 2: 3 New South Wales and the ACT|via=AustLII|date=1997|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most jurisdictions, Indigenous Australians were put under the authority of a Protector, effectively being made wards of the State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|url=http://www.aboriginaleducation.sa.edu.au/files/links/Timeline_of_legislation_af.pdf|title=Timeline of Legislation Affecting Aboriginal People|publisher=Government of South Australia, Aboriginal Education and Employment Services|deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20040225034132/http://www.aboriginaleducation.sa.edu.au/files/links/Timeline_of_legislation_af.pdf |archivedate= 25 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=86|title=Documenting a Democracy: Aboriginal Protection Act 1869 (Vic)|publisher=National Archives of Australia|accessdate=25 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704201937/http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=86|archivedate=4 July 2009|postscript=: In Victoria, for example, "The (Aboriginal Protection) Act gave powers to the Board for the Protection of Aborigines which subsequently developed into an extraordinary level of control of people's lives including regulation of residence, employment, marriage, social life and other aspects of daily life."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protection was done through each jurisdiction's Aboriginal Protection Board; in Victoria and Western Australia these boards were also responsible for applying what were known as ''[[Half-Caste Act]]s''.

More recent usage has developed since Peter Read's publication of ''The Stolen Generations: The Removal of Aboriginal Children in New South Wales 1883 to 1969'' (1981), which examined the history of these government actions.&lt;ref name="read" /&gt; The 1997 publication of the government's ''Bringing Them Home&amp;nbsp;– Report of the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families''&lt;ref name="bth1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hreoc.gov.au/social_justice/bth_report/index.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070905075305/http://www.hreoc.gov.au//social_justice/bth_report/index.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=5 September 2007|title=Bringing them home: The 'Stolen Children' report|accessdate=8 October 2006|publisher=Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; heightened awareness of the Stolen Generations. The acceptance of the term in Australia is illustrated by the 2008 formal apology to the Stolen Generations,&lt;ref&gt;Welch, Dylan (13 February 2008), [http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/rudd-says-sorry/2008/02/13/1202760342960.html "Kevin Rudd says sorry"], ''The Sydney Morning Herald''.&lt;/ref&gt; led by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and passed by both houses of the Parliament of Australia.

There is some opposition to the concept of the term "Stolen Generations". Former Prime Minister John Howard did not believe the government should apologise to the Australian Aborigines.

===History Wars===
{{Main article|History wars}}
The ''Bringing Them Home'' report provided extensive details about the removal programs and their effects. [[Ronald Wilson|Sir Ronald Wilson]], former President of the [[Australian Human Rights Commission#Commission presidents|Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission]] and a Commissioner on the Inquiry, stated that "when it comes to the credibility of those stories, there is ample credibility, not from the cross-examination of the children themselves, but from the governments whose laws, practices and policies enabled these forced removals to take place. We had the support of every State government; they came to the Inquiry, came with lever-arch files setting out the laws from the earliest days right up to the end of the assimilation policy, that is up to the 1970s and more importantly, senior government offices attended. In every case, these senior officers acknowledged that there was a lot of cruelty in the application of those laws and policies."&lt;ref name="ABC Radio National"/&gt;

In April 2000, Aboriginal Affairs Minister John Herron tabled a report in the Australian Parliament in response to the Human Rights Commission report which stated that, as "only 10% of Aboriginal children" had been removed, they did not constitute an entire "generation".&lt;ref name=herron/&gt; The report attracted media attention and protests.&lt;ref name="730Report"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/stories/s115691.htm "No stolen generation: Australian Govt"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011119071452/http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/stories/s115691.htm# |date=19 November 2001 }}, ''The 7.30 Report'', ABC TV, 3 April 2000. Retrieved 19 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Herron apologised for the "understandable offence taken by some people" as a result of his comments, although he refused to alter the report as it had been tabled. 

Historian Peter Read referred to the children affected as the "Stolen Generations". Another historian, [[Robert Manne]], defended that terminology, making the analogy that other people refer to the "generation that lost their lives in the First World War" without meaning over 50 per cent of the young people at the time; rather, people use that phrasing as a metaphor for a collective experience. Similarly, he believes, some of the Aboriginal community use the term to describe their collective suffering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/stories/s268644.htm "Academics debate contents of Stolen Generations report"], ''The 7.30 Report'', 29 March 2001.

There is ongoing contention among politicians, commentators, and historical, political, and legal experts as to whether the forced removals of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children that occurred during the Stolen Generations can be accurately described as genocidal acts and particularly whether they meet the definition of genocide in article II (e) of the [[UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barta|first1=Tony|title=Sorry, and not sorry, in Australia: how the apology to the stolen generations buried a history of genocide|journal=Journal of Genocide Research|date=2008|volume=10|issue=2|pages=201–214|doi=10.1080/14623520802065438|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14623520802065438|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cassidy |first1=Julie |title=Unhelpful and inappropriate?: The question of genocide and the stolen generations |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/AUIndigLawRw/2009/7.pdf}} (2009) 13(1), ''Australian Indigenous Law Review'' 114.

There is further contention as to whether those responsible for the Stolen Generations should be [[Legal liability|criminally liable]] for genocide. In response to a submission by the National Aboriginal and Islander Legal Services Secretariat to the [[Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody]], [[Elliott Johnston|Commissioner Johnston]] considered whether the policies and practices of the Australian Governments pertinent to the Stolen Generations constituted a breach of the Convention but concluded that "[i]t is not my function to interpret the Convention or to decide whether it has been breached, particularly since the policies involved were modified in 1962 somewhat and abandoned by 1970".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|author=Elliott Frank Johnston|date=1991|title=Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody National Report|url= http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/IndigLRes/rciadic/national/vol5/2.html#Heading5 |via=AustLII|volume=5|section=36.3 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide|access-date=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bringing Them Home Report|''Bringing Them Home'']] report concluded that: &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Australian practice of Indigenous child removal involved both systematic racial discrimination and genocide as defined by international law. Yet it continued to be practised as official policy long after being clearly prohibited by treaties to which Australia had voluntarily subscribed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; However, in the subsequent case of ''[[Kruger v Commonwealth]]'', the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] judges rejected the claim of the plaintiffs that the ''Aboriginals Ordinance 1918''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act|title=Aboriginals Ordinance 1918|number=9|date=1918|url=https://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item-sdid-62.html|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; authorised genocide as defined by the Convention and ruled that there was no legislation to implement the Convention under [[Australian law|Australian municipal law]] at the time. One of the recommendations of the ''Bringing Them Home'' report was that 'the [[Commonwealth of Australia|Commonwealth]] legislate to implement the Genocide Convention with full domestic effect'. While genocide has been a crime under [[international law]] since the [[Coming into force|commencement]] of the Convention in 1951, in accordance with Section [[Section 51(xxix) of the Constitution of Australia|51(xxix) of the Australian Constitution]], it has only been a crime under Australian law since the commencement of the ''International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Act 2002'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act|title=International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Act 2002|number=42|date=27 June 2002|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2004A00993|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so the Stolen Generations cannot be considered genocide under Australian law because the Act is not [[Ex post facto law|retrospective]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scott|first1=Shirley|title=Why wasn't genocide a crime in Australia?

[[Ronald Wilson|Sir Ronald Wilson]], then President of the [[Australian Human Rights Commission|Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission]], commissioner of the ''National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families'', and co-author of the ''Bringing Them Home'' report, argued that the policies resulting in the Stolen Generations constitute attempted [[genocide]] by the government, as it was widely believed at the time that the Aborigines would die out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Perry|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/24/088.html|title=A Stolen Generation Cries Out|agency=[[Reuters]]|publisher=Hartford Web Publishing|date=20 May 1997|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manne argues that the expressed views of government bureaucrats, such as [[A. O. Neville]], to assimilate the mixed-race children into the white population by means of "breeding out the colour", and therefore eventually resulting in the full-bloods being "forgotten", bore strong similarities to the racial views of the [[Nazism|Nazis]] in 1930s [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name="ManneTheMonthly"&gt;{{cite web|first=Robert|last=Manne|authorlink=Robert Manne|url=https://www.themonthly.com.au/monthly-essays-robert-manne-sorry-business-road-apology-823|title=Sorry Business: The Road to the Apology|publisher=themonthly.com.au|date=March 2008|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manne points out that, though the term "genocide" had not yet entered the English language, the policies of Neville and others were termed by some contemporaries as the "die out" or "breed out" policy, giving an indication of their proposed intent.&lt;ref name="ManneTheMonthly"/&gt; He also states that academics "generally acknowledge" that the authors of the ''Bringing Them Home'' report were wrong to argue that Australian authorities had committed genocide by removing indigenous children from their families. Social assimilation has never been regarded in law as equivalent to genocide.&lt;ref name="ManneTheMonthly"/&gt;

Though historian [[Paul R. Bartrop|Paul Bartrop]] rejects the use of the word genocide to describe Australian colonial history in general, he does believe that it applies to describing the Stolen Generations. Bartrop and US scholar [[Samuel Totten]] together wrote the ''Dictionary of Genocide'', for which Bartrop wrote the entry on Australia. He said he used as the benchmark for usage of the term genocide the 1948 UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, which is also cited in the ''Bringing Them Home'' report.&lt;ref name="SorensenWilson2008"&gt;{{cite news|first1=Rosemary|last1=Sorensen|authorlink1=Rosemary Sorensen|first2=Ashleigh|last2=Wilson|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23421344-2702,00.html|title=Stolen Generations listed as genocide|newspaper=The Australian|date=24 March 2008|accessdate=24 March 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080326183546/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0%2C25197%2C23421344-2702%2C00.html|archivedate=26 March 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Inga Clendinnen]] suggests that the term genocide rests on the "question of intentionality", saying: "There's not much doubt, with great murderous performances that were typically called genocide, that they were deliberate and intentional. Beyond that, it always gets very murky."&lt;ref name="SorensenWilson2008"/&gt;

*The Australian film ''[[Rabbit-Proof Fence (film)|Rabbit-Proof Fence]]'' (2002), directed by [[Phillip Noyce]], was based on the book ''[[Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence]]'' by [[Doris Pilkington Garimara]]. It concerns the author's mother and two other mixed-race Aboriginal girls who ran away from Moore River Native Settlement, north of Perth, and returned to their Aboriginal families. In a subsequent interview with the ABC, Doris recalled her removal in 1931 from her mother at age three or four, and subsequent rearing at the settlement. She was not reunited with her mother until she was 25; all those years, she believed that her mother had given her away. When the two women were reunited, Doris was no longer able to speak her native language and had been taught to regard Indigenous culture as evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/message/tv/ms/s731524.htm|title=Doris Pilkington|publisher=abc.net.au|date=24 December 2002|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310114305/http://www.abc.net.au/message/tv/ms/s731524.htm|archivedate=10 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Baz Luhrmann]]'s 2008 film ''[[Australia (2008 film)|Australia]]'', starring [[Nicole Kidman]] and [[Hugh Jackman]], deals with the Stolen Generations.

===Stage===
*''[[Stolen (play)|Stolen]]'' (1998) is a play by Australian playwright [[Jane Harrison (playwright)|Jane Harrison]]. It tells the story of five fictional Aboriginal people by the names of Sandy, Ruby, Jimmy, Anne, and Shirley who dealt with the issues for forceful removal by Australian governments. Sandy has spent his entire life on the run, never having a set home to live in. ''Stolen'' tracks his quest for a place to be, a place where he does not have keep hiding from the government (even though they are no longer after him), and a place he can call home. Ruby was forced to work as a domestic servant from a young age and was sent insane by the constant pressure forced upon her by her white masters. She spends a lot of her time mumbling to herself, whilst her family desperately tries to help her. Jimmy was separated from his mother at a very young age, and she spent her entire life looking for him. He spent a lot of time in prison and, on the day he finally got out, he was told about his mother's search. As he went to meet her, she died, and he committed suicide in anger. Anne was removed from her family and placed in a Caucasian family's home. She was materially happy in this home, a lot happier than many of the other characters, but when her indigenous family tried to meet her, she was caught in crossfire between her two "families". Shirley was removed from her parents and had her children removed from her. She only felt relief, safety, and comfort when her granddaughter was born and not removed.

===Literature===
*[[Bryce Courtenay]]'s novel ''[[Jessica (novel)|Jessica]]'' tells of a case brought in a New South Wales court against the Aboriginal Protection Board. It challenged the Aboriginal Protection Act of 1909 in order to return two children from [[Cootamundra Domestic Training Home for Aboriginal Girls]] to the Aboriginal mother.
*Aboriginal artist and author [[Sally Morgan (artist)|Sally Morgan]] has written several novels based on the lives of her and her family members, featuring intimate portrayals of the impact of forced removal on individuals, their families, and communities, although Sally herself was not a stolen child. Her first, ''My Place'', involves her quest to uncover her Aboriginal heritage which had previously been denied by her family, who insisted "as a survival mechanism" that they were of Indian extraction.

===The White Stolen Generations===
{{Main article|Forced adoption in Australia}}
During the same period from the 1930s to 1982, 250,000 Australian-born non-Indigenous children were also removed from parents who were deemed "unfit". At the time this was widely seen as a positive thing by society for both the mothers and the children. The term ''white stolen generations'' is now used to distinguish this group from the Indigenous stolen generations. The mothers were sometimes drugged, tied to beds, or told their babies had died. Many hospitals engaged in what is now known as institutionalised baby farming, these babies were often adopted into middle class families.&lt;ref name="smh.com.au"&gt;Liz Hannan, Liz (8 December 2010), [http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/politics/white-mothers-of-stolen-children-also-deserve-an-apology-20101207-18o7t.html "White mothers of stolen children also deserve an apology"], ''The Sydney Morning Herald''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="m.brisbanetimes.com.au"&gt;Calligeros, Marissa (24 December 2010), [http://m.brisbanetimes.com.au/lifestyle/your-son-is-gone-hes-with-his-adoptive-parents-20101222-1958a.html?page=1 "'Your son is gone.

Organisations such as the ''Apology Alliance'' and ''Adoption Loss Adult Support'' have actively campaigned for a parliamentary apology similar to that given for the Aboriginal Stolen Generations. In 2001, then treasurer of NSW [[Michael Egan (Australian politician)|Michael Egan]] made a statement of public acknowledgement in the NSW Parliament. In October 2010, West Australian Premier [[Colin Barnett]] delivered a parliamentary apology on behalf of state institutions involved in the aggressive adoption practices. Prime Minister [[Julia Gillard]] made a personal public apology.&lt;ref name="smh.com.au"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m.brisbanetimes.com.au"/&gt;&lt;ref name="forgottenaustralians.com"/&gt;

'''The Connect U.S. Fund''' ('''CUSF''') was a [[Washington, D.C.]]-based nonprofit that promotes responsible U.S. global engagement in issues like [[nuclear nonproliferation]], [[human rights]], [[climate change]], and development. It was founded in 2004 by several foundations and shut down in 2013. The organization supported grantees and other non-governmental organizations in their efforts to collaborate, engage policy makers, and bring issues to the attention of the media. Its last President was [[Nancy Soderberg]].&lt;ref name=thehill&gt;[http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-a-environment/120591-investments-in-climate-change-solutions-can-break-the-global-logjam "Biographical Information: Ambassador Nancy E. Soderberg"], ''The Hill'', 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Connect U.S. initiative was founded in 2004 by the [[William and Flora Hewlett Foundation]], [[Charles Stewart Mott Foundation]], [[Open Society Institute]], and [[Rockefeller Brothers Fund]] to unite and support a growing number of U.S.-based organizations that work on international affairs. The [[Ford Foundation]] joined the collaborative in 2005, the [[Atlantic Philanthropies]] joined in 2008, the [[Ploughshares Fund]] joined in 2009, and the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] joined in 2010. The Connect U.S. Fund operated as a project of the [[Tides Center]].&lt;ref name=ConnectUS&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.connectusfund.org/about/history|website =Connect U.S. Fund|title =History|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20121102085423/http://connectusfund.org/about/history|archivedate =2 November 2012|deadurl =yes|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initiative had emerged from a series of meetings among the founding partners in 2002 and 2003 when they discovered that they faced similar challenges, such as "limited public and private resources for foreign policy advocacy, media focus on a narrowly defined security agenda, and the absence of informed and empowered constituencies on global issues to hold policy makers accountable". The foundations agreed that "a collaborative fund, to which each would contribute, might provide an important incentive to collaboration among NGOs, and thereby enhance the collective impact of advocacy efforts. They thus created the Connect U.S. Fund and embarked on two rounds of grantmaking, from 2004 through 2006."&lt;ref name = ConnectUS/&gt;

In November 2006, [[Eric P. Schwartz]] joined the Connect U.S. Fund as its first executive director.&lt;ref name=statedepartment&gt;U.S. State Department. [https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/biog/125768.htm "Biographical Information Eric P. Schwartz"], 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He developed a program of grant-making and operations designed to promote a vision of responsible U.S. global engagement during the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 U.S. presidential election]]. In early 2009, Eric Schwartz left to join the [[U.S. State Department]] as the [[Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees, and Migration]], and [[Nancy Soderberg|Ambassador Nancy Soderberg]] joined the Connect U.S. Fund as its new President. She served until it shut down in 2013.

==Overview ==

The Connect U.S. Fund was managed and administered by the [[Tides Center]]. The Connect U.S. Council provided policy and program guidance for the Connect U.S. initiative, and was composed of representatives from each of the supporting foundations. The Council was supported by the Connect U.S. Fund professional staff and operated as a project of the Tides Center.&lt;ref name=ConnectUS2/&gt;

Through a program of grant-making and operations designed to foster stronger collaboration among non-governmental organizations active on foreign policy issues, the Connect U.S. Fund sought to advance a vision for responsible U.S. global engagement in an increasingly interdependent world.  The Fund supported a community of foundations and non-governmental organizations working together to enhance the effectiveness of their collective advocacy efforts.&lt;ref name=ConnectUS2&gt;{{cite web|title=Current Priority Issues|url=www.connectusfund.org/issues|website=Connect U.S. Fund|accessdate=11 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607050956/http://connectusfund.org/issues|archivedate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Key issues===
In 2012, the Connect U.S. Fund was focusing on four key issues:&lt;ref name=ConnectUS2/&gt;
* '''[[Human rights]]''': Encourage strong American leadership in multilateral human rights instruments and institutions, including support for the work of the [[International Criminal Court]]; strengthening UN human rights mechanisms; securing ratification of at least one “core” human rights treaty; and a U.S. government structure to prevent [[genocide]] and respond to mass atrocities.
* '''[[Climate change]]''':  Urge U.S. leadership in addressing the climate crisis through making smart investments at home and in the developing world and by promoting innovative solutions for reducing emissions.  This includes eliminating all fossil fuel subsidies and galvanizing investment in adaptation, clean technology, and forest protection in the developing world.
*'''Development''':  Support for international financial and trade reform as a means for global poverty alleviation, including U.S. support for international financial transparency, international financial institution reform, trade preference reform, and [[export-oriented industrialization|export-led growth]] in the developing world, ensuring U.S. civilian agencies have the funds, capacity, and knowledge needed to conduct development, stability operations, and diplomacy effectively in order to strike a better balance between the civilian and military responsibilities in these areas.
* '''Security''':  U.S. support for [[arms control]] treaties, a [[fissile material]] cut-off, and efforts to secure vulnerable nuclear materials

'''The Firm''' is a film and television production and talent management company based in [[Santa Monica]], California.  Established in 1997, it ceased operations in November 2008 and was relaunched by its founder, [[Jeff Kwatinetz]], in August 2015. The Firm's divisions also include a record label and a marketing group.&lt;ref name="deadline relaunch"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Andreva|first1=Nellie|title=Jeff Kwatinetz To Relaunch The Firm Management &amp; Production Company|url=http://deadline.com/2015/08/jeff-kwatinetz-the-firm-relaunched-1201494743/|accessdate=9 September 2015|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=August 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Variety JK leaves"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fleming|first1=Michael|title=Jeff Kwatinetz resigns from the Firm|url=https://variety.com/2008/film/markets-festivals/jeff-kwatinetz-resigns-from-the-firm-1117995427/|accessdate=9 September 2015|publisher=Variety|date=November 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Firm was founded by managers [[Jeff Kwatinetz]] and [[Michael Green (agent)|Michael Green]] in 1997.  Operating originally out of Kwatinetz' Malibu apartment, the company was described by the [[Los Angeles Times]] as "racing through the music industry with the velocity of a bullet train"  and by 2000 represented a stable of actors and musicians that had generated more than $1.5 billion in gross revenue.&lt;ref name="LA Times 2002"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Boucher, Geoff and|first1=Brown, Corrie|title=Hollywood Sizing Up Firm's Grasp|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/may/07/business/fi-firm7|accessdate=11 September 2015|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=May 7, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kwatinetz partnered with David Baram and Rick Yorn to help run the operation later bringing on new talent including [[Criss Angel]] and [[Denzel Washington]].

In 2002 The Firm purchased [[Michael Ovitz]]'s Artist Management Group (AMG) and in 2004 it merged with entertainment consulting company Integrated Entertainment Partners (IEP), led by Rich Frank, a former president of [[Disney]] studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Holson | first = Laura | last2 = Weinraub | first2 = Bernard | title = Some See a Young Ovitz in Emerging Power Broker | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = May 13, 2002 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/13/business/some-see-a-young-ovitz-in-emerging-power-broker.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Waxman | first = Sharon | title = Leading Hollywood Talent and Marketing Companies Merge | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = March 19, 2004 | url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E7D81331F93AA25750C0A9629C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Leeds | first = Jeff | last2 = Ulmer | first2 = James | title = Departures Cool Off Agency's Hot Start | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = August 11, 2005 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/11/movies/11firm.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;   During its first incarnation, the company represented [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], [[Cameron Diaz]], [[Robert De Niro]], [[Kelly Clarkson]], [[Korn]], [[Ice Cube]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Dixie Chicks]], [[Linkin Park]], [[Backstreet Boys]], [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Limp Bizkit]], and [[DC Pierson]], among others.  In addition to the individual successes of their clients, the company was noted for its prescience in melding celebrities with consumer brands and for its role as an architect of the $2.6 billion  acquisition of Warner Music by a private equity consortium.&lt;ref name="NYT TOLN"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barnes|first1=Brooks|title=Rebirth for Soap Operas, and a Career|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/06/business/media/using-soap-operas-jeff-kwatinetz-plans-an-online-tv-network.html|accessdate=12 September 2015|publisher=The New York Times|date=October 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Firm ceased operations in 2008.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Prospect Park==
{{Main|Prospect Park (production company)}}
Several months after the Firm was closed, Kwatinetz and Frank founded [[Prospect Park (production company)|Prospect Park]], an entertainment company which replicated the scope of The Firm.&lt;ref name="Variety JK leaves" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT TOLN" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Billboard&gt;{{cite news|last1=Billboard Staff|title=Jeff Kwatinetz Revives the Firm|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6656725/jeff-kwatinetz-revives-the-firm|accessdate=11 September 2015|publisher=Billboard|date=August 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Financed through Kwatinetz' personal assets, Prospect Park focused on TV and film development and production, and included an artist management division and a record company. In 2013 it launched the short-lived [[The Online Network|Online Network]] with the soap operas ''[[One Life to Live]]'' and  ''[[All My Children]]''.&lt;ref name="Variety JK leaves" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT TOLN" /&gt;{{r|Billboard}} The company shut down both shows in 2013 as it filed a lawsuit against [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], from whom they had licensed the rights to both series.&lt;ref name="Cancellation 2013 (TVG)"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/All-My-Children-Canceled-1073248.aspx|title=All My Children Dead (Again), Cast Members Say|last=Stanhope|first=Kate|work=TV Guide|accessdate=November 11, 2013|date=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cancellation 2013 (HP)"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/12/all-my-children-canceled_n_4259562.html|title='All My Children' Canceled: Online Soap Not Returning|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=November 12, 2013|date=November 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prospect Park declared bankruptcy in 2014 pending an outcome on the lawsuit.&lt;ref name="PP Bankruptcy"&gt;{{cite news|title=Soap opera producer Prospect Park files for bankruptcy protection|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2014/mar/10/entertainment/la-et-ct-soap-opera-producer-prospect-park-bankruptcy-20140310|first=Meg|last=James|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=March 10, 2014|accessdate=November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactivation==
In August 2015 it was announced that the Firm had been reactivated, a decision which Kwatinetz said was based on feedback from the creative community. Prospect Park senior executives Jeremy Summers, [[Angelica Cob-Baehler]] and Josh Barry transitioned to The Firm, and [[Robbie Brenner]], formerly the president of production at [[Relativity Media]], was named president of The Firm's film division shortly after the company relaunched.&lt;ref name=DeadlineBrenner&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fleming, Jr.|first1=Mike|title=Robbie Brenner Leaving Relativity To Run The Firm’s Film Division|url=http://deadline.com/2015/09/robbie-brenner-the-firm-relativity-1201517970/|accessdate=11 September 2015|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=September 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the banner of Prospect Park Productions, the Firm produces the television series ''[[Salem (TV series)|Salem]]'' for [[WGN America]] and [[USA Network]]'s ''[[Royal Pains]]''; as of 2015, ''Salem'' was in its third season and ''Royal Pains'' in its eighth. As of 2015, the company had projects in development for broadcast, cable and digital platforms which included ''Black Heart'' for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]],  ''Talent'' for [[NBC]], ''Tough Love'' for [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], ''Hard Foul'' for [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]],  '' A Midsummer’s Nightmare'' ([[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]]), ''Relics'' ([[Sony Pictures Television|Sony International Networks]]), and a [[Christina Aguilera]] co-produced [[ABC Family]] program tentatively titled ''Hearts and Clubs''. Prospect Park produced FX's ''[[Wilfred (U.S. TV series)|Wilfred]]'', which ran from 2011 through 2014.&lt;ref name="deadline relaunch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Talent Deadline"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Andreeva|first1=Nellie|title=‘Talent’ Drama With Music Elements From Shaun Cassidy &amp; The Firm Set Up At NBC|url=http://deadline.com/2015/08/talent-drama-music-shaun-cassidy-nbc-1201503450/|accessdate=11 September 2015|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=August 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Firm manages [[Ice Cube]]'s production company, Cube Vision.

"'''Treehouse of Horror XVI'''" is the fourth episode of the [[The Simpsons (season 17)|seventeenth season]] of ''[[The Simpsons]]''. It first aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on November 6, 2005. In the sixteenth annual ''[[Treehouse of Horror]]'', the [[Simpson family|Simpsons]] replace [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] with a robot son after Bart falls into a coma, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and various other male characters find themselves on a reality show where [[Mr. Burns]] hunts humans for sport, and costumed Springfieldians become whatever they are wearing, thanks to a witch who was disqualified from a Halloween costume contest. It was written by [[Marc Wilmore]] and directed by [[David Silverman (animator)|David Silverman]]. [[Terry Bradshaw]] and [[Dennis Rodman]] guest star as themselves. Around 11.63 million Americans tuned in to watch the episode during its original broadcast.

==Plot==
In the opening, [[Kang and Kodos|Kang]] hopes to speed up an exceedingly slow and boring [[baseball]] game, but ends up destroying the universe when the baseball players go so fast, they turn into a killer vortex which sucks up the universe, even [[God (The Simpsons)|God]]. When everything was sucked up by the baseball players, Kang places a [[post-it note]] revealing the title of the episode.

===B.I. Bartificial Intelligence===
In a parody of ''[[A.I. Artificial Intelligence]]'', [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] winds up in a two-week [[coma]] after attempting to jump out of a window into a swimming pool. The family takes in a robotic boy, named David, who quickly proves to be a better son. Bart wakes up from his two-week coma and competes against David for the affection of the rest of his family. However, Bart is dumped on a road by Homer, who decided with Marge to keep David as their son. When Bart finds a group of old rusty robots, he steals their parts and becomes a devil-possesed cyborg. He returns home, saws David in half with a chainsaw, but does the same to Homer. Although the family is now together again, Homer is angry that he has to be fused with David's lower half. Suddenly, the whole scenario is revealed to be a dream conjured by Homer's [[demonic possession|demonically possessed]] mind as he is being exorcised.

===Survival of the Fattest===
In a parody of ''[[The Most Dangerous Game]]'', men and women from [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] arrive at [[Mr. Burns]]' mansion to go hunting. Unbeknownst to them, ''they'' are the prey to be hunted and broadcast on television. Homer manages to survive the night while the others are killed left and right, but Burns closes in on him in the morning.  Just as he is about to be shot, Burns and [[Waylon Smithers|Smithers]] are knocked up and smashed out by Marge with a frying pan in each hand.

===I've Grown a Costume on Your Face===
In a parody of ''[[Halloweentown II: Kalabar's Revenge]]'', the ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' episode "[[Halloween (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Halloween]]" and the classic ''[[The Twilight Zone|Twilight Zone]]'' episode "[[The Masks]]", The citizens of Springfield dress in their [[Halloween costume]]s for a costume contest that involves courage, bravery and happiness. The winner is declared to be a strange old witch with a green skin and a black-and-red suit. When given the award and asked who she is, she is forced to admit that she is a really real witch. As a result, her reward is rescinded because she is not in actual costume and is setenced to four weeks in [[jail]] as a punishment for admitting a secret silliness. In anger of such harsh punishment, she turns everyone into their costumed characters, just before being put into custody. The only person who can reverse the spell is Maggie, who was costumed as a witch. Gold, Maggie turns them all into [[pacifier]]s with their normal heads instead, flying off on a broom to seek help after this mistake she made. The segment ends as Moe and a transformed [[Dennis Rodman]] talk to the audience about the importance of reading.

The '''Mongolian Lunar New Year''', commonly known as '''Tsagaan Sar''' ({{lang-mn|Цагаан сар}}, ''Cagán sar'' / {{MongolUnicode|ᠴᠠᠭᠠᠨ}} {{MongolUnicode|ᠰᠠᠷᠠ}}, {{IPA-mn|t͡sʰaɢaːŋ sar}} or literally '''White Moon''')&lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{lang-bxr|Сагаан һара|''Sagán ħara''}}, {{IPA-all|sagaːŋ ħara}}; {{lang-xal|Цаһан сар|''Cahan sar''}}, {{IPA-all|t͡saɣan sar}}; {{lang-alt|Чага-Байрам}}; {{lang-sah|Үрүнь Ый|''Ürüny ıy''}}; {{lang-se|Vielgatguovssahasat}}; {{lang-iu|ᐊᐳᑦᑕᖅᑭᖅ|''Aputtaqqiq''}}; {{lang-kl|Aputqaqortoq}}, {{lang-zh|查干萨日|t=查幹薩日|p=Chágàn Sàrì}}, [[Xiao'erjing]]: {{lang|zh-Arab|ﭼَﺎقً ﺻَﺎژِ}}; [[Dungan language|Dungan]]: Санган сари, ''Sangan Sari''&lt;/ref&gt;, is the first day of the year according to the [[Mongolian calendar|Mongolian lunisolar calendar]]. The festival of the [[Lunar New Year]] is celebrated by the [[Mongols]] along with the [[Circumpolar peoples|people of the Arctic]].

== Timing ==
The White Moon festival is celebrated on the first through third days of the first lunar month. Tibet's [[Losar]] occurs on the same day as the Mongolian White Moon.
Tsagaan Sar is one of the most important Mongolian holidays.&lt;ref name=mongolus&gt;"Tsagan Sar: The Mongolian Lunar New Year". Mongoluls. 2007. March 13, 2008.[http://mongoluls.net/tsagaansar.shtml Mongoluls.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ceremony ==
The customs of Tsagaan Sar are significantly different depending on the region. In [[Mongolia]] around the New Year for example, families burn candles at the altar symbolizing Buddhist [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]]. Also people greet each other with holiday-specific greetings such as Амар байна уу? (Amar baina uu?), meaning "Are you living peacefully?"&lt;ref name=amar&gt;[http://sonofthemidwestinthefareast.wordpress.com/2011/02/08/амар-байна-уу-are-you-restedpeaceful/ Амар байна уу? (Are you rested/peaceful?)]&lt;/ref&gt; Mongols also visit friends and family on this day and exchange gifts. A typical Mongol family will meet in the home dwelling of the eldest in the family.&lt;ref name=mntoday&gt;[http://www.mongoliatoday.com/issue/2/tsagaan_sar_1.html "Tsagaan Sar, the Lunar New Year"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113222017/http://www.mongoliatoday.com/issue/2/tsagaan_sar_1.html |date=2006-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people will be dressed in full garment of [[Deel (clothing)|national Mongol costumes]]. When greeting their elders during the White Moon festival, Mongols perform the [[zolgokh]] greeting, grasping them by their elbows to show support for them. The eldest receives greetings from each member of the family except for his/her spouse.&lt;ref name=mntoday /&gt; During the greeting ceremony, family members hold long, typically blue, silk cloths called a ''[[khadag]]''.&lt;ref name=mongolus /&gt; After the ceremony, the extended family eats sheep's tail, mutton, rice with curds, dairy products, and [[buuz]]. It is also typical to drink [[Kumis|airag]] and exchange gifts.

The day before Tsagaan Sar is called ''[[Dark moon|Bituun]]'', the name of the lunar phase of a new or [[dark moon]]. The lunar phases are Bituun (dark moon), Shined (new crescent moon), Tergel (full moon), and Huuchid (waxing moon). On the Bituun day, people thoroughly clean around home, herders also clean the livestock barns and shades, to meet the New Year fresh. The Bituun ceremony also includes burning candles to symbolize enlightenment of the samsara and all sentient beings and putting three pieces of ice at the doorway so that the horse of the deity [[Palden Lhamo]] could drink as the deity is believed to visit every household on this day. In the evening, families gather together—usually immediate family,&lt;ref name=mntoday /&gt; in contrast to the large feast gatherings of White Moon day — and see out the old year eating dairy products and buuz. Traditionally, Mongolians settle all issues and repay all debts from the old year by this day.&lt;ref name=mntoday /&gt;

== Food ==
Depending on the region, food is prepared in a diverse array of forms. For example, the [[Mongolian cuisine|traditional food in Mongolia]] for the festival includes dairy products, rice with curds (tsagaa-цагаа) or rice with raisins (berees-бэрээс), a pyramid of traditional cookies erected on a large dish in a special fashion symbolising [[Mount Sumeru]] or [[Shambhala]] realm, a grilled side of sheep and minced beef or minced mutton steamed inside pastry, steamed dumplings known as [[buuz]], horse meat and traditional cookies.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, Michael. ''[[Lonely Planet]] Mongolia''. Lonely Planet, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-74104-578-9}}, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Tsagaan Sar is a lavish feast, requiring preparation days in advance, as the men and women make large quantities of buuz as a whole family, along with ul boov, a pastry reserved for both dessert and presentation.&lt;ref name=mntoday /&gt;

== During communism ==
During Mongolia's [[Mongolian People's Republic|Communist period]], the government banned Tsagaan Sar and tried to replace it with a holiday called "[[Agriculture in Mongolia|Collective Herder]]'s Day", but the holiday was practiced again after the [[1990 Democratic Revolution in Mongolia]].&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, Peter. ''The Horse-head Fiddle and the Cosmopolitan Reimagination of Tradition of Mongolia''.  Routledge, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-415-97156-0}}, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dates ==
{{outdated|date=February 2018}}
The [[Mongolian calendar|Mongol calendar]] in the Tegus Buyantu (Төгсбуянт) system is a [[lunisolar calendar]]. The Tegus Buyantu astrology was developed by Mongol high priest Luvsandanzanjantsan (1639–1704), the first reincarnation of the Blama-yin Gegegen (Ламын гэгээн).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Л.

Tsagaan Sar is celebrated on the first through third days of the first [[lunar month]].

'''Vibram FiveFingers''' are a type of [[minimalist shoe]] manufactured by [[Vibram]], originally marketed as a more natural alternative for different outdoors activities (sailing, kayaking, canoeing, and as a camp or after-hike shoe).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title = The Living Barefoot Show episode #3: Interview to Michael Martin, National Sales Manager for Vibram FiveFingers |url = http://www.livingbarefoot.info/podcasts/LivingBarefoot_EP3.mp3 |airdate = 2009-07-30 |minutes = 47 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The footwear is meant to replicate being barefoot and has thin, flexible soles that are contoured to the shape of the human foot, including visible individual sections for the toes.&lt;ref name=faqs_mechanics&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/technology/faqs_mechanics.cfm |title = Foot mechanics and health |publisher = Vibram FiveFingers |date = 2010-07-20 |accessdate = 2011-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The company settled a lawsuit alleging false health claims and set aside $3.75 million to pay refunds of up to $94 to anyone who had purchased the product since March 21, 2009.&lt;ref name="lawsuit"/&gt;

== Origin ==
[[File:Vibram FiveFingers KSO Trek Brown.JPG |thumb|FiveFingers KSO Trek]]
Invented in 1999 by Robert Fliri, a design student from [[Vinschgau]] who wanted to "figure out a way to move around in nature better." Vibram FiveFingers were developed and introduced in 2005.&lt;ref name=faqs_mechanics/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bodyconsciousdesign.com/uploads/interview_fliri_for_publication.pdf "The story of the five fingers"].

=== Purpose ===
Vibram FiveFingers were originally targeted to yacht racers to maintain grip on slippery decks without compromising the barefoot experience.&lt;ref&gt;"Protect your feet at the beach, in the boat or at the mall with shoes designed for water and land but with more support than a water sock.". Star Tribune. June 20, 2006. doi:1064219291.&lt;/ref&gt; Their potential use as a minimalist running shoe was suggested to the Vibram CEO by Ted McDonald, a runner who earned the nickname "Barefoot Ted" for his unshod feet and successful career as a barefoot running coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McDougall|first1=Christopher|title=Born To Run|date=2009|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=9780307279187|pages=163–164|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of these shoes as outlined by the manufacturers is to provide footwear to be mainly used for fitness, running, water sports, yoga, trekking and travelling, and other sports.&lt;ref name=mens&gt;"Men's Footwear." www.vibramfivefingers.com.

=== Sizing ===
Unlike traditional footwear, Vibram FiveFingers do not follow the typical US or UK shoe-sizing scales.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} They require precise foot length measurement with accuracy of 1/8 inch (3 mm) and conversion to the FiveFingers sizing chart. This ranges from 38–50 for men, 34–42 for women, and 29–36 for children. As a result, the shoe sizing more closely mirrors the EU system. However, minor discrepancies exist between the women's and men's sizing, so, ''e.g.'', a women's size 39 does not equal a men's size 39.&lt;ref&gt;"Size Conversion Chart." www.vibramfivefingers.com. Vibram, n.d. Web. 10 Nov 2011. &lt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/size_fit/size_conversion_chart.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=November 10, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115083803/http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/size_fit/size_conversion_chart.htm |archivedate=November 15, 2011 }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Materials ===
Vibram FiveFingers comprise many different materials that vary depending on the style of shoe. The most common components are Vibram TC-1 performance rubber, which makes up the sole of these shoes, a thin stretch polyamide comprising the frame of the shoe that molds to the contours of the user's foot, and an antimicrobial microfiber footbed.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

== Minimalist shoes ==
In a report on an article in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', co-author Daniel E. Lieberman stated that "People who wear conventional running shoes tend to run with a significantly different [[Foot strike (gait)#Foot strike|strike]] than those who run in minimalist shoes or barefoot. By landing on the middle or front of the foot, barefoot runners have almost no impact collision."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/01/100127134241.htm |title = Barefoot running: How humans ran comfortably and safely before the invention of shoes |publisher = Sciencedaily.com |date = 2010-02-01 |access-date = 2011-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lieberman et al.'s study was an experiment that involved five groups of runners from [[Kenya]] and the [[United States]]. The two American groups were adult athletes who had run with shoes since childhood, and those who habitually [[barefoot running|ran barefoot]] or with minimal footwear such as Vibram FiveFingers (mentioned by name in the study). The three Kenyan groups were adults who had never run in shoes until late adolescence, as well as two teenage groups: those that habitually wore shoes and those that always ran barefoot. The runners were instructed to run over a [[force plate]] that was embedded in a 25-meter track, and were recorded during the run using a three-dimensional infrared kinematic system. These measurements were used to assess the pattern with which the foot strikes the ground and how forcibly it does so.&lt;ref name=Lieberman&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Lieberman |first1 = DE. |last2 = Venkadesan |first2 = M. |last3 = Werbel |first3 = WA. |last4 = Daoud |first4 = AI. |last5 = D'Andrea |first5 = S. |last6 = Davis |first6 = IS. |last7 = Mang'eni |first7 = RO. |last8 = Pitsiladis |first8 = Y. |title = Foot strike patterns and collision forces in habitually barefoot versus shod runners. |journal = Nature |volume = 463 |issue = 7280 |pages = 531–5 |date=Jan 2010 |doi = 10.1038/nature08723 |pmid = 20111000 |bibcode = 2010Natur.463..531L }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Toe socks + toe shoes.jpg|thumb|FiveFingers with toe socks]]

=== Health effects ===
[[Barefoot running]], which is similar to running with FiveFingers on, appears to decrease the risk of ankle sprain and [[plantar fasciitis]].&lt;ref name=sportsci&gt;Warburton, Michael. "Barefoot Running may help keep runners on their feet." Sportscience. (2001): n. page. Web. 10 Nov. 2011. &lt;http://www.sportsci.org/jour/0103/mw.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Because the Fivefingers lack any support or cushioning (or very minimal at most), the intent is to allow the wearer to engage a natural footstrike, as if he/she would run barefoot. Incorrect, unnatural running forms, especially where a heelstrike is involved, results in the same uncomfortable or painful feedback as when running barefoot, therefore leading the wearer to adjust the stride. This feedback is said to be filtered out of common running shoes because of the thick sole, therefore leading to possible injuries. 

If not conditioned slowly enough, especially when transitioning away from heelstrike running or from wearing shoes with an elevated heel, the sole of the foot or [[plantar fascia]] can become inflamed or damaged with activity.&lt;ref name=Lieberman/&gt; Also due to over-training or incorrect form, runners may experience Achilles tendonitis or metatarsal inflammation and fractures. Over-striding in Vibram FiveFingers, that is, landing with the foot too far in front of one's hips, adds extra unnecessary stress to the calf muscles, Achilles tendon, and the arch of the foot, which can lead to serious health problems if not addressed.&lt;ref name=Lieberman/&gt;

One study found a greater number of new wearers of FiveFingers showed an increase in bone marrow [[edema]] than those in the study's control group.&lt;ref&gt;http://unique-sportstime.de/site/wp-content/uploads/Barfuss-Laufen1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It recommended transition to use of the shoe be very slow and gradual.

===Lawsuit===
In 2012, an initial lawsuit was filed against Vibram over claims made about their FiveFingers minimalist shoe. Vibram claimed that the shoe "reduce[s] foot injuries and strengthen[s] foot muscles".  While Vibram has "expressly" denied "any actual or potential fault&amp;nbsp;... or liability", on May 7, 2014 it was announced that company has moved to settle the suit and agreed to set aside $3.75 million to pay refunds of up to $94 to anyone who had purchased the product since March 21, 2009.&lt;ref name="lawsuit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2014/05/08/say-it-aint-so-vibram-say-it-aint-so/?tid=hpModule_1f58c93a-8a7a-11e2-98d9-3012c1cd8d1e|title=People who bought these Vibram FiveFinger shoes may be entitled to a refund|author=Lenny Bernstein|publisher=Washington Post|date=May 8, 2014|access-date=May 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Wonder Showzen''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[sketch comedy]] [[television series]] that aired between 2005 and 2006 on [[MTV2]]. It was created by [[John Lee (producer)|John Lee]] and [[Vernon Chatman]] of [[PFFR]].

Described as a children’s show for adults, the show's format is a parody of educational [[PBS]] children's television shows such as ''[[Sesame Street]]'' and ''[[The Electric Company]]'' (e.g. use of [[stock footage]], [[puppetry]], and clips of children being interviewed), parodying the format with adult-oriented content. In addition to general controversial comedy, it [[satire|satirizes]] [[politics]], [[religion]], [[war]], [[sex]] and [[culture]] with [[black comedy]].

Every episode begins with a disclaimer, which reads:

"''Wonder Showzen'' contains offensive, despicable content that is too controversial and too awesome for actual children. The stark, ugly and profound truths ''Wonder Showzen'' exposes may be soul-crushing to the weak of spirit. If you allow a child to watch this show, you are a bad parent or guardian."

==Development==
''Wonder Showzen'' was created by [[John Lee (producer)|John Lee]] and [[Vernon Chatman]], who pitched to the [[USA Network]] in 2000, but after a few minutes of viewing, executives there quickly concluded it did not fit the network's programming style.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Daily News'': [http://www.nydailynews.com/04-27-2005/entertainment/story/303787p-260006c.html "'Wonder' shock-ful of adult humor"]. Retrieved December 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, [[Viacom]] was re-branding MTV2 and made ''Wonder Showzen'' part of its new programming lineup. It aired as part of Sic 'Em Fridays, along with ''[[Dirty Sanchez (TV series)|Dirty Sanchez]]'' and ''[[Wildboyz]]''. The pilot was named simply "Kids Show". The ''Wonder Showzen'' theme song is still 'Kids Show'. Reruns of the show also aired on MTV and [[Comedy Central]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

MTV released the first season of ''Wonder Showzen'' on DVD March 28, 2006. The second season of Wonder Showzen premiered on March 31, 2006 and had its season-two finale starring Clarence on May 19, 2006 on MTV2.  This season was released on DVD October 10, 2006, with an [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]] that featured an animation contest. The grand prize was announced as the winner's animation appearing on "the next DVD", but the creators later said a third season was unlikely,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/10/18/a-third-season-of-wonder-showzen-is-unlikely TVSquad.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and MTV afterward canceled the show. A return is even more unlikely as the creators of ''Wonder Showzen'' went on to produce the animated series ''[[Xavier: Renegade Angel]]''.

It aired in Canada on [[MTV2 (Canada)|MTV2]], the United Kingdom and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] on [[MTV Rocks|MTV Two]], [[MTV (UK and Ireland)|MTV]] and [[TMF (UK &amp; Ireland)|TMF]], Australia on [[MTV Australia|MTV]], Germany and Italy on MTV Entertainment, [[Latin America]] on [[MTV Latin America]] and in the Baltics on [[MTV Networks Baltic]].

'''Zarphatic''', or '''Judeo-French''' (Zarphatic: ''Tzarfatit''), is an [[extinct language|extinct]] [[Jewish language]] that was spoken by the [[French Jews]] of northern [[France]] and in parts of west-central [[Germany]], such as [[Mainz]], [[Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Aix-la-Chapelle]]. It was also spoken by French Jews that moved to Norman England.&lt;ref&gt;Hillaby (2013), p24&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The term ''Zarphatic'', coined by [[Solomon Birnbaum]],&lt;ref&gt;S. A. Birnbaum, ''Yiddish: A Survey and a Grammar'', Second Edition (University of Toronto Press, 2016), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; comes from the [[Hebrew]] name for France, ''Tzarfat'' (צרפת), which had been used in the [[Hebrew Bible]] name for the city of [[Sarepta]], in [[Phoenicia]]. Some have conjectured that the language was the original language of the Jews who eventually adopted [[Old High German]], which led to the development of [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}.

== Writing ==
It was written by a modified [[Hebrew script]] and first appeared in the 11th century, in [[gloss (annotation)|glosses]] to texts of the Hebrew Bible and the [[Talmud]] written by the great [[rabbi]]s [[Rashi]] and [[Moshe HaDarshan]]. Constant expulsions and persecutions, resulting in great waves of Jewish migration, brought about the extinction of Zarphatic by the end of the 14th century.

One feature, unlike most other [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] Jewish languages, was that to represent [[vowel]] sounds, instead of using Hebrew letters with no matching [[phoneme]]s in the language, it made extensive use of the [[Tiberian vocalization|Tiberian]] system of [[niqqud|vocalisation]] to indicate the full range of [[Old French]] vowels.

==Vocabulary==
Another interesting feature was that its vocabulary had relatively few Hebrew [[loanword]]s, unlike almost all other [[Jewish languages]].
