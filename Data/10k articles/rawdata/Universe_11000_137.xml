The '''A3W reactor''' is a [[United States Naval reactor|naval reactor]] used by the [[United States Navy]] to provide [[electricity generation]] and [[Nuclear marine propulsion|propulsion]] on [[warship]]s. Like all operational U.S. naval reactors it was a [[pressurized water reactor]] (PWR) design. The A3W designation stands for:

* A = [[Aircraft carrier]] platform
* 3 = Third generation [[Nuclear reactor core|core]] designed by the contractor
* W = [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] was the contracted designer

== History ==
The reactor was intended for use aboard [[USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67)|USS ''John F. Kennedy'']].  This four-[[nuclear reactor|reactor]] design was intended to reduce the cost involved in the construction and operation, as compared with the [[USS Enterprise (CVN-65)|''Enterprise'']] and its eight nuclear reactors.

Early in the construction, the [[United States Secretary of the Navy]] had the plans changed to save money, and fossil fuel boilers were installed on the Kennedy.  Because the plans for the ship did not include a [[funnel (ship)|funnel]], the funnel on the Kennedy protrudes out from the ship at an angle.

The return to nuclear power for carriers came with the [[Nimitz class aircraft carrier|''Nimitz'' class]]'s [[A4W reactor]]'s two reactor per ship design. While the two reactor configuration, with each core providing a much greater thermal output, is relatively less expensive than earlier designs, the [[power plant]] still represents about half the total cost of the ship.

'''Actinism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|k|t|ᵻ|n|ᵻ|z|əm}}) is the property of [[solar radiation]] that leads to the production of [[photochemistry|photochemical]] and [[photobiology|photobiological]] effects.&lt;ref&gt;Appendix 3. "Units for photochemical and photobiological quantities", pp.173-174 of ''The International System of Units (SI)'', [[BIPM]], 2006 [http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Actinism'' is derived from the Greek ακτίς, ακτῖνος (a ray or beam).  The word ''actinism'' is found, for example, in the terminology of imaging technology (esp. photography), medicine (concerning sunburn), and [[chemistry]] (concerning containers that protect from photo-degradation), and the concept of actinism is applied, for example, in [[Photography#Chemical photography|chemical photography]] and [[X-ray]] imaging.

Actinic ({{IPAc-en|æ|k|ˈ|t|ɪ|n|ᵻ|k}}) chemicals include silver salts used in photography and other light sensitive chemicals.

==In chemistry==
In chemical terms, actinism is the property of radiation that lets it be absorbed by a molecule and cause a photochemical reaction as a result.  [[Einstein]] was the first to correctly theorize that each photon would be able to cause only one molecular reaction.  This distinction separates photochemical reactions from exothermic reduction reactions triggered by radiation.

For general purposes, ''photochemistry'' is the commonly used vernacular rather than ''actinic'' or ''actino-chemistry'', which are again more commonly seen used for photography or imaging.

==In medicine==
In medicine, actinic effects are generally described in terms of the dermis or outer layers of the body, such as eyes (see: [[Actinic conjunctivitis]]) and upper tissues that the sun would normally affect, rather than deeper tissues that higher-energy shorter-wavelength radiation such as x-ray and gamma might affect. Actinic is also used to describe medical conditions that are triggered by exposure to light, especially UV light (see [[actinic keratosis]]). 

The term ''actinic rays'' is used to refer to this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|nine/10237302|actinic rays}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In biology==
In biology, "actinic light" denotes light from solar or other sources that can cause photochemical reactions such as [[photosynthesis]] in a species.

==Photography==
''Actinic light'' was first commonly used in early [[photography]] to distinguish light that would expose the monochrome films from light that would not. A non-actinic safe-light (e.g., red or amber) could be used in a [[darkroom]] without risk of exposing (fogging) light-sensitive [[films]], plates or papers.

Early "non colour-sensitive" (NCS) films, plates and papers were only sensitive to the high-energy end of the [[visible spectrum]] from green to [[UV]] (shorter-wavelength light). This would render a print of the red areas as a very dark tone because the red light was not actinic. Typically, light from xenon flash lamps is highly actinic, as is daylight as both contain significant green-to-UV light.

In the first half of the 20th century, developments in film technology produced films sensitive to red and yellow light, known as orthochromatic and panchromatic, and extended that through to near [[infra-red]] light. These gave a truer reproduction of human perception of [[lightness]] across the color spectrum. In photography, therefore, actinic light must now be referenced to the photographic material in question.

==In manufacturing==
Actinic inspection of masks in computer chip manufacture refers to inspecting the mask with the same wavelength of light that the lithography system will use.

==In aquaculture==
Actinic lights are also common in the [[reef aquarium]] industry. They are used to promote coral and invertebrate growth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://futurepet.com/trivia/aquariums-lighting.htm Aquarium Lighting information&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cichlid-forum.com/articles/marineland_aquarium_lighting.php The Correct Lighting for Your Aquarium&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
They are also used to accentuate the fluorescence of fluorescent fish.

Actinic lighting is also used to limit algae growth in the aquarium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigalspets.com/resources/what-is-actinic-lighting/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112044511/http://www.bigalspets.com/resources/what-is-actinic-lighting/ |archivedate=2015-01-12 |df= }} What is Actinic Lighting&lt;/ref&gt; Since algae (like many other plants), flourish in shallower warm water, algae cannot effectively photosynthesize from blue and violet light, thus actinic light minimizes its photosynthetic benefit.

Actinic lighting is also a great alternative to black lights as it provides a "night environment" for the fish, while still allowing enough light for coral and other marine life to grow. Aesthetically, they make fluorescent coral "pop" to the eye, but in some cases also to promote the growth of deeper-water coral that is specialized in photosynthesis using blue light.

==Artificial lighting==
"Actinic" lights are a high-color-temperature blue light. They are also used in [[Bug zapper|electric fly killers]] to attract flies.

Originally, an '''alcoholate''' was the crystalline form of a [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] in which [[alcohol]] took the place of [[water of crystallization]].

The second meaning of the word is that of a [[tincture]], or alcoholic extract of plant material.

The third, and more usual meaning of the word is as a synonym for [[alkoxide]]—a compound formed by the substitution of the [[hydrogen]] atom of the [[hydroxyl]] group of an alcohol by a [[metal]] atom.

The '''alkaline fuel cell''' (AFC), also known as the ''Bacon'' fuel cell after its British inventor, [[Francis Thomas Bacon]], is one of the most developed [[fuel cell]] technologies.  [[NASA]] has used alkaline fuel cells since the mid-1960s, in [[Project Apollo|Apollo]]-series missions and on the [[Space Shuttle program|Space Shuttle]].  Alkaline fuel cells consume hydrogen and pure oxygen producing potable water, heat, and electricity.  They are among the most efficient fuel cells, having the potential to reach 70%.

==Chemistry==
The fuel cell produces power through a [[redox reaction]] between [[hydrogen]] and oxygen.  At the [[anode]], hydrogen is oxidized according to the reaction:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{H}_2 + \mathrm{2OH}^- \longrightarrow \mathrm{2H}_2\mathrm{O} + \mathrm{2e}^-&lt;/math&gt;

producing water and releasing electrons.  The electrons flow through an external circuit and return to the [[cathode]], reducing oxygen in the reaction:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{O}_2 + \mathrm{2H}_2\mathrm{O} + \mathrm{4e}^- \longrightarrow \mathrm{4OH}^-&lt;/math&gt;

producing [[hydroxide]] ions.  The net reaction consumes one oxygen molecule and two hydrogen molecules in the production of two water molecules.  Electricity and heat are formed as by-products of this reaction.

==Electrolyte==
The two electrodes are separated by a porous matrix saturated with an aqueous alkaline solution, such as [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH). Aqueous alkaline solutions do not reject carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) so the fuel cell can become "poisoned" through the conversion of KOH to [[potassium carbonate]] (K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Because of this, alkaline fuel cells typically operate on pure oxygen, or at least purified [[air]] and would incorporate a 'scrubber' into the design to clean out as much of the carbon dioxide as is possible. Because the generation and storage requirements of oxygen make pure-oxygen AFCs expensive, there are few companies engaged in active development of the technology. There is, however, some debate in the research community over whether the poisoning is permanent or reversible. The main mechanisms of poisoning are blocking of the pores in the cathode with K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which is not reversible, and reduction in the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte, which may be reversible by returning the KOH to its original concentration. An alternate method involves simply replacing the KOH which returns the cell back to its original output.&lt;!-- Need references, here; see articles by K. Kordesch and S. Gamburzev, possibly also J. Appleby --&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When carbon dioxide reacts with the electrolyte carbonates are formed. The carbonates could precipitate on the pores of electrodes that eventually block them. It has been found that AFCs operating at higher temperature do not show a reduction in performance, whereas at around room temperature, a significant drop in performance has been shown. The carbonate poisoning at ambient temperature is thought to be a result of the low solubility of K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; around room temperature, which leads to precipitation of K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; that blocks the electrode pores. Also, these precipitants gradually decrease the hydrophobicity of the electrode backing layer leading to structural degradation and electrode flooding.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{CO}_2 + \mathrm{2KOH}\longrightarrow \mathrm{K}_2\mathrm{CO}_3 + \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On the other hand, the charge-carrying hydroxyl ions in the electrolyte can react with carbon dioxide from organic fuel oxidation (i.e. methanol, formic acid) or air to form carbonate species. 
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{2OH}^- + \mathrm{CO}_2\longrightarrow \mathrm{CO}_3^{2-} + \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Carbonate formation depletes hydroxyl ions from the electrolyte, which reduces electrolyte conductivity and consequently cell performance.
As well as these bulk effects, the effect on water management due to a change in vapor pressure and/or a change in electrolyte volume can be detrimental as well .

==Basic designs==
Because of this poisoning effect, two main variants of AFCs exist: static electrolyte and flowing electrolyte. Static, or immobilized, electrolyte cells of the type used in the Apollo space craft and the Space Shuttle typically use an asbestos separator saturated in potassium hydroxide. Water production is controlled by evaporation from the anode, as pictured above, which produces pure water that may be reclaimed for other uses. These fuel cells typically use platinum catalysts to achieve maximum volumetric and specific efficiencies.

Flowing electrolyte designs use a more open matrix that allows the electrolyte to flow either between the electrodes (parallel to the electrodes) or through the electrodes in a transverse direction (the ASK-type or EloFlux fuel cell). In parallel-flow electrolyte designs, the water produced is retained in the electrolyte, and old electrolyte may be exchanged for fresh, in a manner analogous to an oil change in a car&lt;!-- reference needed - see Karl Kordesch's papers --&gt;. More space is required between electrodes to enable this flow, and this translates into an increase in cell resistance, decreasing power output compared to immobilized electrolyte designs. A further challenge for the technology is how severe the problem of permanent blocking of the cathode is by K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; some published reports have indicated thousands of hours of operation on air. &lt;!-- Source: a recent article by Ovonic Fuel Cell in Fuel Cell Today and probably past articles by Gamburzev --&gt; These designs have used both platinum and non-noble metal catalysts, resulting in increased efficiencies and increased cost. &lt;!-- references need; see again Kordesch, Gamburzev, Appleby and others --&gt;

The EloFlux design, with its transverse flow of electrolyte, has the advantage of low-cost construction and replaceable electrolyte but so far has only been demonstrated using oxygen. &lt;!-- need to confirm this with a literature search; see material published by Gaskatel: Dr. August Winsel, Dr. Hans-Joachim Kohnke, and Joachim Helmke --&gt;

The electrodes consist of a double layer structure: an active electrocatalyst layer and a hydrophobic layer. The active layer consists of an organic mixture which is ground and then rolled at room temperature to form a crosslinked self-supporting sheet. The hydrophobic structure prevents the electrolyte from leaking into the reactant gas flow channels and ensures diffusion of the gases to the reaction site. The two layers are then pressed onto a conducting metal mesh, and sintering completes the process.

Further variations on the alkaline fuel cell include the [[metal hydride fuel cell]] and the [[direct borohydride fuel cell]].

==Advantages over acidic fuel cells==
Alkaline fuel cells operate between ambient temperature and 90&amp;nbsp;°C with an electrical efficiency higher than fuel cells with acidic electrolyte, such as [[proton exchange membrane fuel cell]]s (PEMFC), [[solid oxide fuel cell]]s, and [[phosphoric acid fuel cell]]s.
Because of the alkaline chemistry, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics at the cathode are much more facile than in acidic cells,  allowing use of non-noble metals, such as [[iron]], [[cobalt]], or [[nickel]], at the anode (where fuel is oxidized); and cheaper catalysts such as [[silver]] or [[iron phtalocyanine]]s at the cathode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUSL1461117220070914|title=Platinum-free fuel cell developed in Japan|author=Reuters Editorial|date=14 September 2007|work=Reuters|accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the low [[overpotential]]s associated with [[electrochemical]] reactions at high [[pH]].

An alkaline medium also accelerates oxidation of fuels like methanol, making them more attractive. 

==Commercial prospects==
AFCs are the cheapest of fuel cells to manufacture.  The catalyst required for the electrodes can be any of a number of different chemicals that are inexpensive compared to those required for other types of fuel cells.

The commercial prospects for AFCs lie largely with the recently developed bi-polar plate version of this technology, considerably superior in performance to earlier mono-plate versions.

The world's first Fuel Cell Ship [[Hydra (ship)|HYDRA]] used an AFC system with 5&amp;nbsp;kW net output.

Another recent development is the solid-state alkaline fuel cell, utilizing a solid [[anion exchange membrane]] instead of a liquid electrolyte. This resolves the problem of poisoning and allows the development of alkaline fuel cells capable of running on safer hydrogen-rich carriers such as liquid urea solutions or metal amine complexes.

'''Artificial butter flavoring''' may contain [[diacetyl]], [[acetylpropionyl]], or [[acetoin]], three natural compounds in [[butter]] that contribute to its characteristic [[flavor]]. Because of this, manufacturers of [[margarine]]s or similar [[Vegetable fats and oils|oil]]-based products typically add diacetyl, acetylpropionyl and acetoin (along with [[beta carotene]] for the yellow color) to make the final product butter-flavored, because it would otherwise be relatively tasteless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Pavia | title = Introduction to Organic Laboratory Techniques | edition = 4th | isbn = 978-0-495-28069-9|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chronic industrial exposure to diacetyl fumes, such as in the [[microwave popcorn]] production industry, has been associated with [[Bronchiolitis obliterans#Diacetyl .28popcorn worker.27s lung.29|bronchiolitis obliterans]], a rare and life-threatening form of non-reversible obstructive [[lung]] disease in which the [[bronchiole]]s (small airway branches) are compressed and narrowed by [[fibrosis]] (scar tissue) and/or [[inflammation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/bronchiolitis%20obliterans Merriam-Webster Medical Dictionary &gt; bronchiolitis obliterans] Retrieved on August, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17288497"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Harber P, Saechao K, Boomus C |title=Diacetyl-induced lung disease |journal=Toxicol Rev |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=261–272 |year=2006 |pmid=17288497 |month= |url= |doi=10.2165/00139709-200625040-00006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''b-tagging''' is a method of [[particle jet|jet]] [[flavor tagging]] used in modern [[particle physics]] experiments. It is the identification (or "tagging") of jets originating from [[bottom quark]]s (or b quarks, hence the name).

==Importance==
b-tagging is important because:

* The physics of bottom quarks is quite interesting; in particular, it sheds light on [[CP violation]].
* Some important high-mass particles (both recently discovered and hypothetical) decay into bottom quarks. [[Top quark]]s very nearly always do so, and the [[Higgs boson]] is expected to decay into bottom quarks more than any other particle given its mass has been observed to be about 125&amp;nbsp;GeV. Identifying bottom quarks helps to identify the decays of these particles.

==Methods==
[[File:B-tagging diagram.png|alt=B-tagging diagram|thumb|205x205px|Diagram showing the common principle of identification of jets initiated by b-hadron decays]]
The methods for b-tagging are based on the unique features of b-jets.  These include:

*[[Hadron]]s containing bottom quarks have sufficient lifetime that they travel some distance before decaying. On the other hand, their lifetimes are not so high as those of light quark hadrons, so they decay inside the detector rather than escape. The advent of precision [[semiconductor detector|silicon detectors]] within particle detectors has made it possible to identify particles that originate from a different place where the bottom quark was formed (e.g. the beam–beam collision point in a [[particle accelerator]]), and thus indicating the likely presence of a b-jet.
* The bottom quark is much more massive than anything it decays into. Thus its decay products tend to have higher transverse momentum ([[momentum]] [[perpendicular]] to the original direction of the bottom quark, and therefore of the b-jet). This causes b-jets to be wider, have higher multiplicities (numbers of constituent particles) and [[invariant mass]]es, and also to contain low-energy [[lepton]]s with momentum perpendicular to the jet. These two features can be measured, and jets that have them are more likely to be b-jets.
* Opposite-side algorithms have been used at the [[LHCb]] to tag the flavor in pairs of b quarks using the decay products of B-hadrons to infer the flavor of B-mesons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Flavour tagging performance in LHCb|url = http://iopscience.iop.org/1742-6596/171/1/012103|journal = Journal of Physics: Conference Series|date = 2009-06-01|issn = 1742-6596|pages = 012103|volume = 171|issue = 1|doi = 10.1088/1742-6596/171/1/012103|first = Marc Grabalosa|last = Gándara|first2 = the LHCb|last2 = Collaboration|bibcode = 2009JPhCS.171a2103G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

None of the methods of identifying b-jets are foolproof, and modern particle physics experiments must devote significant time to studying how often they successfully identify b-jets and how often they misidentify other jets.  Monte Carlo simulations are used to develop and evaluate the performance of tagging algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Opposite-side flavour tagging of B mesons at the LHCb experiment|journal = The European Physical Journal C|date = 2012-06-07|issn = 1434-6044|pmc = 4371096|pmid = 25814835|pages = 1–16|volume = 72|issue = 6|doi = 10.1140/epjc/s10052-012-2022-1|first = R.|last = Aaij|first2 = C.

Experiments making precise measurements of [[B meson]]s (mesons containing b-quarks) also try to identify the particular initial B meson within the jet.  This is done in order to observe the oscillation of one meson into another ([[B-Bbar oscillation|{{SubatomicParticle|B0}}–{{SubatomicParticle|AntiB0}} oscillation]]), which allows the measurement of [[CP violation]].

'''Beta carbon nitride''' (β-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is a [[superhard material]] predicted to be harder than diamond.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | journal = Nature | date = 5 Jun 2000 | url = http://www.nature.com/news/2000/000511/full/news000511-1.html | title = News: Crunchy filling | author = Ball, P. | doi = 10.1038/news000511-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The material was first proposed in 1985 by [[Marvin L. Cohen|Marvin Cohen]] and Amy Liu. Examining the nature of [[crystalline]] [[covalent bond|bonds]] they theorised that [[carbon]] and [[nitrogen]] atoms could form a particularly short and strong bond in a stable [[crystal lattice]] in a ratio of 1:1.3. That this material would be harder than [[diamond]] on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs scale]] was first proposed in 1989.&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=Liu, A.

The material has been considered difficult to produce and could not be synthesized for many years. Recently, the production of beta carbon nitride was achieved. For example, nanosized beta carbon nitride crystals and nanorods of this material were prepared by means of an approach involving mechanochemical processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=Niu, C. |author2=Lu, Y.

== Production ==

=== Processing ===
Through a mechanochemical reaction process, β-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; can be synthesized. This method is achieved by ball milling high purity graphite powders down to an amorphous nanoscale size while under an argon atmosphere, then the argon is purged and the graphite powders are introduced to an NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; gas atmosphere, which after high energy [[ball milling]], has been found to form a nanosized flake-like structure of β-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="ref5" /&gt; During milling, fracture and welding of the reactants and graphite powder particles occur repeatedly from ball/powder collisions. [[Plastic deformation]] of the graphite powder particles occur due to the shear bands decomposing into sub-grains that are separated by low-angle grain boundaries, further milling decreases the sub-grain size until nanosize sub-grains form. The high pressure and intense motion promotes [[catalytic]] dissociation of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; molecules into [[monatomic]] nitrogen on the fractured surface of the carbon. Nanosized carbon powders act substantially different from its bulk material as a result of particle dimension and surface area, causing the nanosized carbon to easily react with the free nitrogen atoms, forming β-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; powder.&lt;ref name="ref6" /&gt;

=== Producing nanorods ===
Single crystal β-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanorods can be formed after the powder-like or flake-like compound is thermally [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealed]] with an NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; gas flow. The size of the nanorods is determined by the temperature and time of thermal annealing. These nanorods grow faster in their axis direction that the diameter direction and have hemispherical-like ends. A  cross section of the nanorods indicates that their section morphology is prismatic. It was discovered that they contain amorphous phases, however when annealed to 450 degrees Celsius for three hours under an NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; atmosphere, the amount of the amorphous phase diminished to almost none. These nanorods are dense and twinned rather than nanotubes. Synthesizing these nanorods through thermal annealing provides an effective, low cost, and high yield method for the synthesis of single crystal nanorods.&lt;ref name="ref6" /&gt;

=== Alternate methods of synthesis ===
Rather than forming a powder or nanorod, the carbon nitride compound can alternatively be formed in thin amorphous films by either shock-wave compression technology, [[pyrolysis]] of high nitrogen content precursors, diode sputtering, [[Solvothermal synthesis|solvothermal]] preparation, pulsed laser [[ablation]], or [[ion implantation]].&lt;ref name="ref6" /&gt;

=== Difficulties of processing ===
Although extensive studies on the process and synthesis of the formed carbon nitride have been reported, the nitrogen concentration of the compound tends to be below the ideal composition for C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. This is due to the low [[thermodynamic stability]] with respect to the elements C and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, indicated by a positive value of the [[Standard enthalpy of formation|enthalpies of formation]]. The commercial exploitation of nanopowders is very limited by the high synthesis cost along with difficult methods of production that causes a low yield.&lt;ref name="ref5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref6" /&gt;

== Characteristics ==

=== Structure ===
The structure was determined by [[Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy|Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy]],  [[transmission electron microscopy]], and  [[X-ray diffraction]]. By using an [[SAED]], a polycrystalline β-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with a lattice constant of a = 6.36 Å, c = 4.648 Å can be determined. [[Thermal annealing]] can be used to change the flake-like structure into sphere- or rod-like structures.&lt;ref name="ref5" /&gt;

It has the same crystal structure as β-Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with a [[hexagonal]] network of tetrahedrally (sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) bonded carbon and trigonal planar nitrogen (sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="ref6" /&gt;

The nanorods are generally straight and contain no other defects.&lt;ref name="ref6" /&gt;

=== Properties ===
Properties show a hardness equal or above diamond, the hardest known material.&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt;

The [[bulk modulus]] of diamond is 4.43 MBar while β-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; only has a bulk modulus of 4.27 MBar(± .15). This is the closest conceived bulk modulus to diamond.&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt;

== Possible applications ==
Promising in the field of [[tribology]], wear resistant coating, optical engineering, and electronic engineering.&lt;ref name="ref6" /&gt;

Composite opportunities also exist using TiN as seeding layers for carbon nitride, which produces actual crystalline composites with hardness at levels of 45-55 (GPa) which is on the lower end of diamond.&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt;

The predicted hardness for pure beta carbon nitride(4.27 ± .15 [[Mbar]]) is similar to that of diamond (4.43 Mbar), giving it the potential to be useful in the same fields as diamond.&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt;

'''BirdLife Malta''' is [[Malta]]'s biggest environmental movement. The organization's stated aim is to "achieve protection of wild [[birds]], natural [[habitat]] and [[biodiversity]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.birdlifemalta.org/about_birdlife/aboutus/ |title=BirdLife Malta: About Us |publisher=BirdLife Malta |accessdate=1 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409031755/http://www.birdlifemalta.org/about_birdlife/aboutus |archivedate=9 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

BirdLife Malta is also Malta's first environment [[non-governmental organization|NGO]]. It was founded in January 1962, and was then known as MOS (Malta Ornithological Society). It started off more as a study group, but quickly came to realize that wild birds were in dire need of protection. Today Birdlife Malta works to protect bird populations.

Malta is a very densely populated small [[Mediterranean]] [[island state]], with no truly wild areas left. The biggest threats to birds in Malta are habitat destruction (e.g. new roads, building development, hotels, [[golf course]]s), disturbance and direct persecution ([[hunting]], [[bird trapping|trapping]]). Malta has been called "the most savagely bird-hostile place in Europe".&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Franzen, “Emptying the Skies,” ''The New Yorker'', July 26, 2010, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

BirdLife Malta uses various methods to protect birds. Foremost among its methods are education, especially through schools campaigns, publications, the media and an active junior member section; the management of two wetland nature reserves, namely Għadira and Is-Simar; lobbying the authorities for better bird-protection legislation; assisting the police for better law enforcement;  reclaiming and improving degraded habitat; and doing research about birds and their habitat to identify more areas for protection.

BirdLife Malta issues various newsletters and magazines for its membership, and publishes books about natural history. Its latest book is ''Nature in Gozo'' (2007).

BirdLife Malta is an entirely voluntary organisation and dependent on subscription and donations. Membership currently stands at about 3000.

BirdLife Malta is a Partner of [[BirdLife International]], a global network of environmental organizations in 100 countries and territories.

'''Causes of Population Decline:'''

Hunting and illegal poaching of birds, especially larger predatory birds can have a significant impact on their population size and has resulted in some population decline.[3] Recently the Maltese government agreed to allow the shooting of 5,000 Turtle Doves. This created controversy due to the endangered status of these birds. BirdLife Malta works to prevent the illegal hunting of birds and works to maintain Malta as a safe stop for the many migratory bird species that pass through on an annual bases.

'''Bosseopentaenoic acid (BPA)''' is a [[conjugated system|conjugated]] [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]. Bosseopentaenoic acid can be extracted from the red [[coralline alga]]e, ''[[Bossiella]] orbigniana''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Burgess, J.R. |author2=De la Rosa, R.I. |author3=Jacobs, R.S. |author4=Butler, A |title= A new eicosapentaenoic acid formed from arachidonic acid in the coralline red algae ''Bossiella orbigniana''|journal = Lipids |volume = 26 |issue=2 |pages=1057–1059| doi=10.1007/BF02544012| year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first total synthesis of methyl bosseopentaenoate by consecutive palladium-catalyzed reactions was reported in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mohamed, Y. M. A. |author2=Hansen, T.

M. A. |author2= Solum, E.

It was shown that the  rigidified analogue; the thiophene analogue exhibited higher free radical scavenging potential than the bosseopentaenoic acid. The results showed that by lowering the flexibility of the BPA as [[lead compound]] by incorporation thiophene ring in its structure, an increased antioxidant activity was observed. This study opens the door to investigate the relationship between the flexibility of other [[polyunsaturated fatty acids]] (PUFAs) and enhancement in the biological activity.

'''Campos del Tuyú National Park''' ({{lang-es|Parque Nacional Campos del Tuyú}}) is a [[National parks of Argentina|national park]] in [[Buenos Aires Province]], [[Argentina]]. Situated on the southern shore of [[Samborombón Bay]], the park was established on May 13, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Parque Nacional Campos del Tuyú|website=Administración de Parques Nacionales de Argentina|language=Spanish|url=https://www.sib.gov.ar/area/APN*CT*Campos%20del%20Tuy%C3%BA|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main attraction of Campos del Tuyú is the rare [[pampas deer]]; in fact, it is one of the few places in the [[Pampas]] where this species survive. Other inhabitants of the park include over a hundred bird species, [[capybara]], and the likewise endangered [[Leopardus geoffroyi]].

'''Clark Y''' is the name of a particular [[airfoil|aerofoil]] profile, widely used in general purpose [[aircraft]] designs, and much studied in [[aerodynamics]] over the years. The profile was designed in 1922 by [[Virginius E. Clark]]. The airfoil has a thickness of 11.7 percent and is flat on the lower surface from 30 percent of [[Chord (aircraft)|chord]] back. The flat bottom simplifies angle measurements on propellers, and makes for easy construction of wings on a flat surface.

For many applications the Clark Y has been an adequate airfoil section; it gives reasonable overall performance in respect of its [[lift-to-drag ratio]], and has gentle and relatively benign [[Stall (flight)|stall]] characteristics. But the flat lower surface is not optimal from an aerodynamic perspective, and it is rarely used in modern designs.
[[File:Clark YH.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Clark YH wingroot of a [[Yakovlev Yak-18T|Yak-18T]]]]

The Clark YH airfoil is similar but with a reflexed (turned up) [[trailing edge]] producing a more positive [[pitching moment]] reducing the horizontal tail load required to trim an aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ae.illinois.edu/m-selig/ads/aircraft.html The Incomplete Guide to Airfoil Usage] Retrieved 27 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Шавров В.Б.

Mashinostroenie. {{ISBN|5-217-00477-0}}) (''History of aircraft design in USSR: 1938-1950'')&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
===Aircraft===
The [[Lockheed Vega]] and [[Spirit of St. Louis]] are two of the better known aircraft using the Clark Y profile, whilst the [[Ilyushin Il-2]] and [[Hawker Hurricane]]  are examples of mass-produced users of the Clark YH.&lt;ref name="IGAU"&gt;Lednicer, David, (15 September 2010), [http://www.ae.illinois.edu/m-selig/ads/aircraft.html The Incomplete Guide to Airfoil Usage], retrieved 28 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Northrop Tacit Blue]] stealth technology demonstrator aircraft also used a Clark Y.&lt;ref&gt;Piccirillo, Albert, "The Clark Y Airfoil - A Historical Retrospective," SAE/AIAA paper 2000-01-5517, presented at the World Aviation Congress &amp; Exposition, October 10, 2000, San Diego, California.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Clark Y was chosen as its flat bottom worked well with the design goal of a low radar cross-section.

===Model aircraft===
The Clark Y has found favour for the construction of model aircraft, thanks to the flight performance that the section offers at medium [[Reynolds number]] airflows. Applications on model aircraft is very wide, ranging from free-flight gliders through to multi-engined radio control scale models.

The Clark Y is appealing for its near-flat lower surface, which aids in the construction of wings on plans mounted on a flat construction board.  Inexperienced modellers are more readily able to build model aircraft which provide a good flight performance with benign stalling characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Simons, ''Model Aeroplane Aerodynamics'', Model &amp; Allied Publications 1978. Chapter 7 - 9, Aerofoil Sections.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cars===
An inverted Clark Y airfoil was used on the [[Spoiler (car)|spoilers]] of the [[Dodge Charger Daytona#1969|Dodge Charger Daytona]] and [[Plymouth Superbird]]. &lt;ref name="Hot Rod Magazine"&gt; (29 June 2005), [http://www.hotrod.com/articles/wing/amp/ From NASA to NASCAR], retrieved 29 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cloghanecarhan''' is a [[ringfort]] and [[ogham]] stone (CIIC 230) forming a [[National Monument (Ireland)|National Monument]] located in [[County Kerry]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=u0hZAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Cloghanecarhan+century&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Cloghanecarhan|title=The Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland|first=Royal Society of Antiquaries of|last=Ireland|date=21 August 2017|publisher=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==

Cloghanecarhan is located on the western end of the [[Iveragh Peninsula]], {{Convert|7.2|km}} south-southeast of [[Cahersiveen]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2058608/_230__Cloghanecarhan_Image_.html?l%5Bp%5D%5Bmlt%5D=%2F2058608%2F_4__Kilmannin_Image_&amp;l%5Br%5D=12&amp;l%5Bt%5D=5949701&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The ogham stone was erected some time in the Middle Ages; based on the grammar, it is a late inscription, c. AD 600.&lt;ref&gt;http://irishsettlement.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Newsletter-2010-11.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Next to it is a stone cashel used for later Christian burials.

==Description==
[[File:Rowan tree 20081002b.jpg|thumb|Rowan tree. Traditionally it was believed to ward off malevolent spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irisharchaeology.ie/2017/03/raven-born-wolf-singer-some-old-irish-names-from-ogham-stones/|title=Raven Born &amp; Wolf Singer: Some old Irish Names from Ogham stones - Irish Archaeology|website=irisharchaeology.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The ogham stone originally stood at the east entrance of the [[ringfort]] but now lies to the north. It is [[slate]], 208 × 38 × 18&amp;nbsp;cm. The inscription reads &lt;small&gt;EQQẸGGNỊ [MA]Q̣[I] ṂẠQI-CAṚATTỊNN&lt;/small&gt; ("'of Ec...án? son of Mac-Cáirthinn"); this is overwritten on an earlier inscription, &lt;small&gt;D[ ... ]A[.C.] AVI DALAGNI [MAQI C--&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ogham.celt.dias.ie/stone.php?lang=en&amp;site=Cloghanecarhan&amp;stone=230._Cloghanecarhan&amp;stoneinfo=description|title=Ogham in 3D - Cloghanecarhan / 230. Cloghanecarhan|website=ogham.celt.dias.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same name, in the form MAQI-CAIRATINI, appears on an ogham stone in Painestown (CIIC 40), and it means "devotee of the [[Sorbus aucuparia|rowan]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.megalithicmonumentsofireland.com/COUNTIES/KERRY/Cloghanecarhan_OghamStone.html|title=CLOGHANECARHAN OGHAM STONE/MEGALITHIC MONUMENTS OF IRELAND.COM|first=PIP|last=2011|website=www.megalithicmonumentsofireland.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/journalofroyalso39roya/journalofroyalso39roya_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland"|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first element of the townland name could mean either "ford of stepping-stones" (there is a small stream, the Direen, to the east) or to a [[clochán|stone beehive hut]], such as is found in the cashel.

The ringfort was known locally as 'Keeldarragh'; it is circular and enclosed by a bank with entrance at east and "pillars" at the west end. Inside is a circular hut, three ''leachta'', a [[souterrain]] and a cross slab.

'''Copper-clad steel''' ('''CCS'''), also known as '''copper-covered steel''' or the [[trademark]]ed name [[Fushi Copperweld|Copperweld]] is a [[bi-metal]]lic product, mainly used in the [[wire]] industry that combines the high mechanical resistance of [[steel]] with the [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]] and resistance to [[corrosion]] of [[copper]].

It is mainly used for grounding purposes, line tracing to locate underground utilities, drop wire of [[telephone]] [[Electrical cable|cables]],&lt;ref name=tele&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RgHnAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "The History of Copper Clad Wire" (April 29, 1911) ''Telephony'' Vol.60 No.17, Telephone Publishing Corporation, Chicago and New York]&lt;/ref&gt;  and inner [[conductor (material)|conductor]] of [[coaxial cable]]s, including thin hookup cables like RG174, and [[CATV]] cable.

==History==
The first recorded attempt to make copper clad steel wire took place in the early 1860s, according to the ''Copper Clad Handbook'', issued by the Duplex Metals Co., Chester, PA at the turn of the 20th century. Although for over 100 years people had been suggesting various ways of uniting copper and steel, it was not until the period mentioned that Farmer and Milliken tried wrapping a strip of copper about a steel wire. American engineers in 1883 and again in the 1890s made attempts to produce a copper-steel wire, in one instance at least, by electro-plating copper on steel.&lt;ref name=tele/&gt;

The Duplex Metals Co. traces its beginning to [[John Ferreol Monnot]] between 1900 and 1905. He had been very interested in the work of Mr. Martin in Paris, and, as the ''Handbook says'': "After several years devoted to experimenting, organized the Duplex Metals Company. Prior to his discovery of the process under which this company operates in producing its copper clad, probably almost every other possible way of welding copper and steel together had been tried by Mr. Monnot, but found useless for the purpose."&lt;ref name=tele/&gt;

==Uses==
Copper-clad steel wire find applications in [[ground (electricity)|grounding]], connection of ground rods to metallic structures, [[ground grid]] meshes, substations, power installations and [[lightning arrester]]s. 

Copper coated welding wire has become common since wire [[welding]] equipment has become popular.

This wire is also sometimes used for power transmission,and by a few for making [[antenna (radio)|antennas]], especially long wire antennas that need extra strength to withstand the tension without stretching excessively. 

==Properties==

The main properties of these conductors include:

* Good [[corrosion]] resistance of copper
* High [[tensile strength]] of steel
* Resistance against [[material fatigue]]

==Advantages==
Since the outer conductor layer is low-impedance copper, and the center is higher impedance steel, the [[skin effect]] gives copper-clad RF transmission lines impedance at high AC frequencies similar to that of a solid copper conductor.

Tensile strength of copper-clad steel conductors is greater than that of ordinary copper conductors permitting greater span lengths than with copper.

Another advantage is that smaller diameter copper-clad steel conductors may be used in coaxial cables, permitting higher impedance and smaller cable diameter than with copper conductors of similar strength.
 
Due to the inseparable union of the two metals, it deters theft since copper recovery is impractical and thus has very little scrap value.

Installations with copper-clad steel conductors are generally recognized as fulfilling  the required specifications for a good [[Ground (electricity)|ground]]. For this reason it is used with preference by utilities and oil companies when cost is a concern.

'''Deodar forests''' are forests dominated [[Cedrus deodara]] and are found in Western Himalayas from [[Gandak river]] in central [[Nepal]] to [[Hindukush]] in Afghanistan.

Deodar cedar
(Cedrus deodara)
''Timber of the Gods''
The deodar cedar is native to the Himalayan Mountains where its local name is deodar, which translates from the original Sanskrit as "timber of the gods". They were officially introduced into cultivation about 1831 although they have been grown in Chinese parks and gardens for centuries.

== Forest home ==

It is widely grown as an ornamental tree, and is often found in urban forests and parks and along highway mediums.

== Character ==

With its pyramidal shape, soft grayish-green needles and drooping branches, this cedar makes a graceful specimen. Growing rapidly to 40 to 50 feet tall and 20 to 30 feet wide, it also works well as a soft screen. Needles are borne in dense clusters on large, woody pegs and are 1 to 2 inches long.

== Understory ==

At use in landscaping and urban settings, the understory is often determined by design.  However, native species of shrubs and trees should be removed to reduce competition and improve growing conditions.

== Climate ==

General cultivation is limited to areas with mild winters as these trees are frequently killed by temperatures below −13&amp;nbsp;°F. Prefers sunny and well-drained locations.

The [[petroleum industry|oil and gas industry]] is usually divided into three major sectors: [[upstream (petroleum industry)|upstream]], [[midstream]], and '''downstream.''' The downstream sector is the [[oil refinery|refining of petroleum crude oil]] and the [[natural-gas processing|processing and purifying of raw natural gas]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psac.ca/business/industry-overview/ Industry Overview] from the website of the Petroleum Services Association of Canada (PSAC)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the marketing and distribution of [[petroleum product|products]] derived from [[petroleum|crude oil]] and [[natural gas]]. The downstream sector reaches consumers through products such as [[gasoline|gasoline or petrol]], [[kerosene]], [[jet fuel]], [[diesel fuel|diesel oil]], [[heating oil]], [[fuel oil]]s, [[lubricants]], [[waxes]], [[asphalt]], [[natural gas]], and [[liquefied petroleum gas]] (LPG) as well as hundreds of [[petrochemical]]s.

Midstream operations are often included in the downstream category and are considered to be a part of the downstream sector.

==Byproduct sulfur==
Crude oil is a mixture of many varieties of [[hydrocarbon]]s and most usually have many [[sulfur|sulfur-containing compounds]]. The [[oil refinery|oil refining]] process commonly includes [[hydrodesulfurization]] which converts most of that [[sulfur]] into gaseous [[hydrogen sulfide]]. Raw natural gas also may contain gaseous hydrogen sulfide and sulfur-containing [[mercaptan]]s, which are removed in [[natural-gas processing]] plants before the gas is distributed to consumers.

The [[hydrogen sulfide]] removed in the refining and processing of crude oil and natural gas is subsequently converted into byproduct elemental sulfur. In fact, the vast majority of the 64,000,000 metric tons of sulfur produced worldwide in 2005 was byproduct sulfur from refineries and natural-gas processing plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/sulfur/sulfumcs06.pdf Sulfur production report] by the [[United States Geological Survey]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agiweb.org/geotimes/july03/resources.html Discussion of recovered byproduct sulfur]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''Eccentric-hub scooter''' is a two-wheeled [[human powered vehicle]] with an off-centered hub on the large rear wheel and is powered by the rider making a bouncing motion on the platform.

==Description==
[[File:Eccentric Hub Scooter.svg|thumb|An Eccentric Hub scooter]]
An Ingo-bike is a vehicle similar to a [[kick scooter]], with a large rear wheel, mounted off-centre. The vehicle is propelled by the user bouncing up and down or rocking backwards and forwards on the platform to drive the rear wheel around the eccentric hub. One early inventor described the vehicle as a 'galloping scooter' and the rider's motion does resemble a horse-rider's motion. Although the motion produced is impact-free, it is reportedly less efficient than a conventional bicycle and will not propel the vehicle uphill.

==History==

. It was produced by the Ingersoll Steel &amp; Disc Co. (a division of [[BorgWarner|Borg-Warner Corp.]]), from 1934–1937, under the name "Ingo-bike".  A large number of publicity events and promotions popularised the bike and a group of Ingo-bikers in the late 1930s traveled from Chicago to Miami in 30 days. Production ceased when the factory re-tooled to begin producing armaments prior to the Second World War. Phillip Huyssen continued designing variations until at least the 1970s.

===Kangaroo Scooter===
Apparently re-introduced as a children's scooter in the 1960s with the name "kangaroo scooter", kangaroo scooters were built in Taiwan for a company based in Concord, California. They had the eccentric rear wheel and a front caliper brake,chrome fenders and a kickstand.

Another device also called the Kangaroo Scooter has been designed and sold by Ron and Johnny Knox's company, Knoxcooter Inc., of [[Weyburn]], Saskatchewan, Canada since around 2004. This variant includes a one-sided rear wheel support, disk brakes and uniquely a clutched rear hub; which allows the user to coast for periods without bouncing up and down. Contrary to popular belief, the Eco-Fav (Frequency Accelerated Velocipede) scooter is efficient enough to ride uphill. Many users prefer to ride it on an incline to increase their workout resistance.

===Bounce Bike===
A similar concept is the 'Bounce-Bike' which has an eccentric front wheel and a small rear wheel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bouncer Bike|url=http://www.bouncebike.com/|accessdate=1 August 2012|newspaper=New Ideas For Living}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Whymcycle===
Variants have been produced since the 1990s and called "whymcycle", by inventor/substitute teacher Peter Wagner. The term 'Whymcycle' Wagner coined by taking the common word 'whimsical',
which means imaginative, fanciful or eccentric; socially eccentric, that is. Also, the Ingo-style bike he makes has an eccentric rear axle for propulsion, as well as being a rather fanciful  mode of transport. To complete the trifecta of this bike's nomenclatural origins, Wagner's middle name is William, which he abbreviates as 'Wm.'. Hence the bikes he makes are:

# Wm.'s cycles
# whimsical - imaginative,
# whimsical - eccentrically powered and socially off-center to boot.

====Variations====
Twenty five years of production has resulted in 125 'Whymsies', thus far. The term has come to apply to all of the styles of creative cycles he makes, from handcycles for riders with leg disabilities, to assorted cycles:  front wheel drive, recumbent
bikes and trikes, quadracycles, tall bikes, high wheelers- big and small,
as well as tandems and sociable trikes of various stripes. Kinetic Sculptures, that is, all-terrain amphibious human -powered machines, which have been built and raced on the West Coast since 1969, are also some of the machines Wagner builds. See 'That's A Mower, Eh?', 'Kinetic Choo Choo', and his race car tired amphibious Whymcycle, #115 in fact,
'Bounce For Glory'.

'''Electric power distribution''' is the final stage in the [[Power delivery|delivery]] of [[electric power]]; it carries electricity from the [[Electric power transmission|transmission system]] to individual consumers. Distribution substations connect to the transmission system and lower the transmission voltage to medium [[voltage]] ranging between 2&amp;nbsp;[[kilovolt|kV]] and 35&amp;nbsp;kV with the use of [[transformer]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; ''Primary'' distribution lines carry this medium voltage power to [[distribution transformer]]s located near the customer's premises. Distribution transformers again lower the voltage to the [[utilization voltage]] used by lighting, industrial equipment or household appliances. Often several customers are supplied from one transformer through ''secondary'' distribution lines. Commercial and residential customers are connected to the secondary distribution lines through [[service drop]]s. Customers demanding a much larger amount of power may be connected directly to the primary distribution level or the [[subtransmission]] level.&lt;ref name=HSW/&gt;

==History==
{{further|History of electric power transmission}}
[[File:Brush Company arc light madison square new york 1882.png|thumb|upright|The late 1870s and early 1880s saw the introduction of [[arc lamp]] lighting used outdoors or in large indoor spaces such as this [[Brush Electric Company]] system installed in 1880 in [[New York City]].]]

Electric power distribution only became necessary in the 1880s when electricity started being generated at [[power stations]]. Before that electricity was usually generated where it was used. The first power distribution systems installed in European and US cities were used to supply lighting: [[arc lamp|arc lighting]] running on very high voltage (around 3000 volts) [[alternating current]] (AC) or [[direct current]] (DC), and [[incandescent lamp|incandescent lighting]] running on low voltage (100 volt) direct current.&lt;ref&gt;Quentin R. Skrabec, The 100 Most Significant Events in American Business: An Encyclopedia, ABC-CLIO – 2012, page 86&lt;/ref&gt; Both were supplanting [[gas lighting]] systems, with arc lighting taking over large area and street lighting, and incandescent lighting replacing gas for business and residential lighting.

Due to the high voltages used in arc lighting, a single generating station could supply a long string of lights, up to {{convert|7|mi|km|adj=on}} long circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the Society of Telegraph Engineers|last=Berly|first=J.|publisher=Institution of Electrical Engineers|volume=IX|date=1880-03-24|title=Notes on the Jablochkoff System of Electric Lighting|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lww4AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA143|issue=32|page=143|accessdate=2009-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each doubling of the voltage would allow the same size cable to transmit the same amount of power four times the distance for a given power loss. Direct current indoor incandescent lighting systems, for example the first Edison [[Pearl Street Station]] installed in 1882, had difficulty supplying customers more than a mile away. This was due to the low 110 volt system being used throughout the system, from the generators to the final use. The Edison DC system needed thick copper conductor cables, and the generating plants needed to be within about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} of the farthest customer to avoid excessively large and expensive conductors.

=== Introduction of the transformer ===
Transmitting electricity a long distance at high voltage and then reducing it to a lower voltage for lighting became a recognized engineering roadblock to electric power distribution with many, not very satisfactory, solutions tested by lighting companies. The mid-1880s saw a breakthrough with the development of functional [[transformer]]s that allowed the AC voltage to be "stepped up" to much higher transmission voltages and then dropped down to a lower end user voltage. With much cheaper transmission costs and the greater [[economies of scale]] of having large generating plants supply whole cities and regions, the use of AC spread rapidly.

In the US the competition between direct current and alternating current took a personal turn in the late 1880s in the form of a "[[War of Currents]]" when [[Thomas Edison]] started attacking [[George Westinghouse]] and his development of the first US AC transformer systems, pointing out all the deaths caused by high voltage AC systems over the years and claiming any AC system was inherently dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Webb B.|last=Garrison|title=Behind the headlines: American history's schemes, scandals, and escapades|publisher=Stackpole Books|year=1983|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edison's propaganda campaign was short lived with his company switching over to AC in 1892.

AC became the dominant form of transmission of power with innovations in  Europe and the US in [[electric motor]] designs and the development of engineered ''universal systems'' allowing the large number of legacy systems to be connected to large AC grids.&lt;ref name="Thomas Parke Hughes 1930, pages 120-121"&gt;{{cite book|first=Thomas |last=Parke Hughes|title=Networks of Power: Electrification in Western Society, 1880–1930|publisher=JHU Press|year=1993|pages= 120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Raghu Garud 2009, page 249"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Raghu|last1=Garud|first2=Arun|last2=Kumaraswamy|first3= Richard|last3= Langlois|title= Managing in the Modular Age: Architectures, Networks, and Organizations|publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons |year= 2009| page= 249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first half of the 20th century, in many places the [[electric power industry]] was [[vertical integration|vertically integrated]], meaning that one company did generation, transmission, distribution, metering and billing. Starting in the 1970s and 1980s, nations began the process of [[deregulation]] and [[privatisation]], leading to [[electricity market]]s. The distribution system would remain regulated, but generation, retail, and sometimes transmission systems were transformed into competitive markets.

==Generation and transmission==

&lt;/imagemap&gt;

Electric power begins at a generating station, where the potential difference can be as high as 33,000 volts. AC is usually used. Users of large amounts of DC power such as some [[railway electrification system]]s, [[telephone exchange]]s and industrial processes such as [[aluminium]] smelting  use [[rectifier]]s to derive DC from the public AC supply, or may have their own generation systems.  [[HVDC|High-voltage DC]] can be advantageous for isolating alternating-current systems or controlling the quantity of electricity transmitted. For example, [[Hydro-Québec]] has a direct-current line which goes from the [[James Bay]] region to [[Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hydroquebec.com/learning/transport/grandes-distances.html|title=Extra-High-Voltage Transmission {{!}} 735 kV {{!}} Hydro-Québec|website=hydroquebec.com|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the generating station it goes to the generating station’s switchyard where a step-up [[transformer]]&amp;nbsp;increases the voltage to a level suitable for transmission, from 44kV to 765kV. Once in the transmission system, electricity from each generating station is combined with electricity produced elsewhere. Electricity is consumed as soon as it is produced. It is transmitted at a very high speed, close to the [[speed of light]].

== Distribution overview ==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2014}}
[[File:Electricity Grid Schematic English.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|General layout of [[Grid (electricity)|electricity networks]]. The voltages and loadings are typical of a European network.]]The transition from transmission to distribution happens in a power [[Electrical substation|substation]], which has the following functions:&lt;ref name=HSW&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/energy/power5.htm|title=How Power Grids Work|website=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2016-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Circuit breaker]]s and switches enable the substation to be disconnected from the transmission grid or for distribution lines to be disconnected.
* Transformers step down transmission voltages, 35kV or more, down to primary distribution voltages. These are medium voltage circuits, usually 600-35,000 V.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Electric Power Distribution Handbook|last=Short|first=T.A.|publisher=CRC Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4665-9865-2|location=Boca Raton, Florida, USA|pages=1–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* From the transformer, power goes to the [[busbar]] that can split the distribution power off in multiple directions. The bus distributes power to distribution lines, which fan out to customers.
Urban distribution is mainly underground, sometimes in [[common utility duct]]s. Rural distribution is mostly above ground with [[utility pole]]s, and suburban distribution is a mix.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Closer to the customer, a distribution transformer steps the primary distribution power down to a low-voltage secondary circuit, usually 120/240 volts in the US for residential customers. The power comes to the customer via a [[service drop]] and an [[electricity meter]]. The final circuit in an urban system may be less than 50 feet, but may be over 300 feet for a rural customer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Primary distribution ==
Primary distribution voltages range from 4&amp;nbsp;kV to 35&amp;nbsp;kV phase-to-phase (2.4&amp;nbsp;kV to 20&amp;nbsp;kV phase-to-neutral)&lt;ref name="eep-pdvl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electrical-engineering-portal.com/primary-distribution-voltage-levels|title=Primary Distribution Voltage Levels|last=Csanyi|first=Edvard|date=10 August 2012|website=http://electrical-engineering-portal.com|publisher=EEP – Electrical Engineering Portal|accessdate=9 March 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only large consumers are fed directly from distribution voltages; most utility customers are connected to a transformer, which reduces the distribution voltage to the low voltage "utilization voltage", "supply voltage" or "mains voltage" used by lighting and interior wiring systems.

=== Network configurations ===
[[File:NCPC Power Plant Yellowknife Northwest Territories Canada 08.jpg|thumb|Substation near [[Yellowknife]], in the Northwest Territories of Canada]]

Distribution networks are divided into two types, radial or network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abdelhay A. Sallam and Om P. Malik|title=Electric Distribution Systems|year=May 2011|publisher=IEEE Computer Society Press|isbn=9780470276822|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A radial system is arranged like a tree where each customer has one source of supply. A network system has multiple sources of supply operating in parallel. Spot networks are used for concentrated loads. Radial systems are commonly used in rural or suburban areas.

Radial systems usually include emergency connections where the system can be reconfigured in case of problems, such as a fault or planned maintenance. This can be done by opening and closing switches to isolate a certain section from the grid.

Long feeders experience [[voltage drop]] ([[power factor]] distortion) requiring [[capacitor]]s or [[Voltage regulator (distribution)|voltage regulator]]s to be installed.

Reconfiguration, by exchanging the functional links between the elements of the system, represents one of the most important measures which can improve the operational performance of a distribution system. The problem of optimization through the reconfiguration of a power distribution system, in terms of its definition, is a historical single objective problem with constraints. Since 1975, when Merlin and Back&lt;ref&gt;Merlin, A.; Back, H. Search for a Minimal-Loss Operating Spanning Tree Configuration in an Urban Power Distribution System. In Proceedings of the 1975 Fifth Power Systems Computer Conference (PSCC), Cambridge, UK, 1–5 September 1975; pp. 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt;  introduced the idea of distribution system reconfiguration for active power loss reduction, until nowadays, a lot of researchers have proposed diverse methods and algorithms to solve the reconfiguration problem as a single objective problem. Some authors have proposed Pareto optimality based approaches (including active power losses and reliability indices as objectives). For this purpose, different artificial intelligence based methods have been used: microgenetic,&lt;ref&gt;Mendoza, J.E.; Lopez, M.E.; Coello, C.A.; Lopez, E.A.

Pareto Optimal Reconfiguration of Power Distribution Systems Using a Genetic Algorithm Based on NSGA-II. Energies 2013, 6, 1439–1455.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rural services ===
[[Rural electrification]] systems tend to use higher distribution voltages because of the longer distances covered by distribution lines (see [[Rural Electrification Administration]]). 7.2, 12.47, 25, and 34.5&amp;nbsp;kV distribution is common in the United States; 11&amp;nbsp;kV and 33&amp;nbsp;kV are common in the UK, Australia and New Zealand; 11&amp;nbsp;kV and 22&amp;nbsp;kV are common in South Africa and China.&lt;ref name="eolss"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chan|first1=F|title=Electrical Engineering|url=http://www.eolss.net/sample-chapters/c05/e6-39a-06-01.pdf|accessdate=12 March 2016|chapter=Electric Power Distribution Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other voltages are occasionally used.

Rural services normally try to minimize the number of poles and wires. It uses higher voltages (than urban distribution), which in turn permits use of galvanized steel wire. The strong steel wire allows for less expensive wide pole spacing. In rural areas a pole-mount transformer may serve only one customer. In [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], [[Saskatchewan|Saskatchewan, Canada]], and [[South Africa]], [[Single-wire earth return]] systems (SWER) are used to electrify remote rural areas.

Three phase service provides power for large agricultural facilities, petroleum pumping facilities, water plants, or other customers that have large loads (Three phase equipment).

Usually in the United States, a "4-wire wye system" is used, which includes 3 primary wires and 1 neutral wire.&lt;ref name=TPPS&gt;{{cite web | url = http://power.apitech.com/engineering-tools.aspx | title = engineering tools | date = 2010 | website = apitech.com | publisher = apitech.com | access-date = 24 November 2017 | quote = data}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In other countries or in extreme rural areas the neutral wire is connected to the ground to use that as a return ([[Single-wire earth return]]). This is called an unground [[Three-phase electric power#Three-wire and four-wire circuits|wye]] system.

== Secondary distribution ==
[[File:World Map of Mains Voltages and Frequencies, Detailed.svg|thumb|upright=3|World map of mains voltage and frequencies]]
{{main|Low-voltage network}}
Electricity is delivered at a frequency of either 50 or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz, depending on the region. It is delivered to domestic customers as [[single-phase electric power]]. In some countries as in Europe a [[Three-phase electric power|three phase]] supply may be made available for larger properties. Seen with an [[oscilloscope]], the domestic power supply in North America would look like a [[sine wave]], oscillating between −170 volts and 170 volts, giving an effective voltage of 120 volts RMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/energy/power2.htm|title=How Power Grids Work|website=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2016-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Three-phase electric power|Three-phase]] power is more efficient in terms of power delivered per cable used, and is more suited to running large electric motors. Some large European appliances may be powered by  [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]] power, such as electric stoves and clothes dryers.

A [[Ground (electricity)|ground]] connection is normally provided for the customer's system as well as for the equipment owned by the utility. The purpose of connecting the customer's system to ground is to limit the voltage that may develop if high voltage conductors fall down onto lower-voltage conductors which are usually mounted lower to the ground, or if a failure occurs within a distribution transformer. [[Earthing system]]s can be TT, TN-S, TN-C-S or TN-C.

=== Regional variations ===
{{refimprove section|date=October 2014}}

====220–240 volt systems====
Most of the world uses 50&amp;nbsp;Hz 220 or 230 V single phase, or  400V 3 phase for residential and light industrial services. In this system, the primary distribution network supplies a few substations per area, and the 230V / 400V  power from each substation is directly distributed to end users over a region of normally less than 1&amp;nbsp;km radius. Three live (hot) wires and the neutral are connected to the building for a three phase service. Single-phase distribution, with one live wire and the neutral is used domestically where total loads are light. In Europe, electricity is normally distributed for industry and domestic use by the three-phase, four wire system. This gives a phase-to-phase voltage of {{nowrap|400 volts}} [[Three-phase electric power#Three-wire and four-wire circuits|wye]] service and a single-phase voltage of {{nowrap|230 volts}} between any one phase and neutral.  In the UK a typical urban or suburban low-voltage substation would normally be rated between 150&amp;nbsp;kVA and 1&amp;nbsp;MVA and supply a whole neighbourhood of a few hundred houses. Transformers are typically sized on an average load of 1 to 2&amp;nbsp;kW per household, and the service fuses and cable is sized to allow any one property to draw a peak load of perhaps ten times this.
For industrial customers, 3-phase {{nowrap|690 / 400 volt}} is also available, or may be generated locally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url = https://www.en-powered.com/blog/the-bumpy-road-to-energy-deregulation | title = The Bumpy Road to Energy Deregulation  | publisher = EnPowered  | date = 2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Large industrial customers have their own transformer(s) with an input from 11 kV to 220 kV.

==== 100–120 volt systems ====
Most of the Americas use 60&amp;nbsp;Hz AC, the 120/240 volt [[split phase]] system domestically and three phase for larger installations. North American transformers usually power homes at 240 volts, similar to Europe's 230 volts. It is the split-phase that allows use of 120 volts in the home.

[[File:Power Grid of Japan.svg|thumb|Japan's utility frequencies are {{nowrap|50 Hz}} and {{nowrap|60 Hz}}.]]

In the [[electricity sector in Japan]], the standard voltage is 100V, with both 50 and 60&amp;nbsp;Hz AC frequencies being used. Parts of the country use 50&amp;nbsp;Hz, while other parts use 60&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2011/07/19/reference/japans-incompatible-power-grids/|title=Japan’s incompatible power grids|last=Gordenker|first=Alice|date=2011-07-19|newspaper=The Japan Times Online|language=en-US|issn=0447-5763|access-date=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a relic of the 1800s. Some local providers in [[Tokyo]] imported 50&amp;nbsp;Hz German equipment, while the local power providers in [[Osaka]] brought in 60&amp;nbsp;Hz generators from the United States. The grids grew until eventually the entire country was wired. Today the frequency is 50&amp;nbsp;Hz in Eastern Japan (including&amp;nbsp;Tokyo,&amp;nbsp;[[Yokohama]],&amp;nbsp;[[Tōhoku region|Tohoku]], and [[Hokkaido]]) and 60 Hertz in Western Japan (including&amp;nbsp;[[Nagoya]],&amp;nbsp;[[Osaka]],&amp;nbsp;[[Kyoto]],&amp;nbsp;[[Hiroshima]],&amp;nbsp;[[Shikokuchūō|Shikoku]], and [[Kyushu]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2225.html|title=Electricity in Japan|website=Japan-Guide.com|access-date=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most household appliances are made to work on either frequency. The problem of incompatibility came into the public eye when the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] knocked out about a third of the east’s capacity, and power in the west couldn’t be fully shared with the east, since the country does not have a common frequency.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There are four [[high-voltage direct current]] (HVDC) converter stations that move power across Japan’s AC frequency border. [[Shin Shinano]] is a [[Back-to-back connection#Power transmission|back-to-back]] HVDC facility in [[Japan]] which forms one of four [[frequency changer]] stations that link Japan's western and eastern power grids. The other three are at [[Higashi-Shimizu Frequency Converter|Higashi-Shimizu]], [[Minami-Fukumitsu]] and [[Sakuma Dam#HVDC frequency converter|Sakuma Dam]]. Together they can move up to 1.2 GW of power east or west.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/the-smarter-grid/why-japans-fragmented-grid-cant-cope|title=Why Japan's Fragmented Grid Can't Cope|website=Spectrum.IEEE.org|access-date=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 240 volt systems and 120 volt outlets ====
Most modern North American homes are wired to receive 240 volts from the transformer, and through the use of [[Split-phase electric power|split-phase electrical power]], can have both 120 volt receptacles and 240 volt receptacles. The 120 volts is typically used for lighting and most [[AC power plugs and sockets|wall outlets]]. The 240 volt outlets are usually located to service the oven and stovetop, water heater, and clothes dryer (if they are electric, rather than using natural gas). Sometimes a 240 volt outlet is mounted in the garage for machinery or for charging an [[electric car]].

'''Fibre saturation point''' is a term used in wood mechanics and especially [[wood drying]], to denote the point in the drying process at which only water bound in the [[cell wall]]s remains - all other water, called free water, having been removed from the cell cavities. Further drying of the wood results in [[Strength of materials|strengthening]] of the wood fibres,&lt;ref&gt;Effect of moisture upon the strength and stiffness of wood. US Department of Agriculture, Forest Service Bulletin No 70, Washington&lt;/ref&gt; and is usually accompanied by shrinkage. Wood is normally dried to a point where it is in equilibrium with the atmospheric moisture content or relative humidity, and since this varies so does the [[equilibrium moisture content]].
Laboratory testing has found the average FSP in many types of wood to be approximately 26%. Individual species may differ from the average.&lt;ref&gt;Principles of Wood Science and Technology: I Solid Wood, Franz F.P. Kollmann, Wilfred A.Jr. Cote&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fractional freezing''' is a process used in [[process engineering]] and [[chemistry]] to separate substances with different melting points. It can be done by partial melting of a solid, for example in [[zone melting|zone refining]] of [[silicon]] or [[metals]], or by partial [[crystallization]] of a liquid, as in '''freeze distillation''', also called '''normal freezing''' or '''progressive freezing'''. The initial sample is thus [[fractionation|fractionated]] ([[separation process|separated]] into [[fraction (chemistry)|fractions]]).

Partial crystallization can also be achieved by adding a dilute solvent to the mixture, and cooling and concentrating the mixture by evaporating the solvent, a process called solution crystallization.&lt;ref name="Perry"&gt;{{cite book

==Freeze distillation==
[[File:Aventinus Weizen-Eisbock.jpg|thumb|right|[[bock#Eisbock|Eisbock]] beer (12% alcohol) created via freeze distillation of doppelbock beer. Barrels of beer were originally left outdoors to partially freeze, then the ice removed.]]

Freeze [[distillation]] is a misnomer, because it is not distillation but rather a process of enriching a solution by partially freezing it and removing frozen material that is poorer in the dissolved material than is the liquid portion left behind. Such enrichment parallels enrichment by true distillation, where the evaporated and re-condensed portion is richer than the liquid portion left behind.

The detailed situation is the subject of [[thermodynamics]], a subdivision of [[physics]] of importance to [[chemistry]]. Without resorting to mathematics, the following can be said for a mixture of water and alcohol:
*Freezing in this scenario begins at a temperature significantly below 0&amp;nbsp;°C.
*The first material to freeze is not the water, but a dilute solution of alcohol in water.
*The liquid left behind is richer in alcohol, and as a consequence, further freezing would take place at progressively lower temperatures. The frozen material, while always poorer in alcohol than the (increasingly rich) liquid, becomes progressively richer in alcohol.
*Further stages of removing frozen material and waiting for more freezing will come to naught once the liquid uniformly cools to the temperature of whatever is cooling it.
*If progressively colder temperatures are available,
**the frozen material will contain progressively larger concentrations of alcohol, and
**the fraction of the original alcohol removed with the solid material will increase.
*In practice, unless the removal of solid material carries away liquid, the degree of concentration will depend on the final temperature rather than on the number of cycles of removing solid material and chilling.
*Thermodynamics gives fair assurance, even without more information about alcohol and water than that they freely dissolve in each other, that
**even if temperatures ''somewhat below'' the freezing point of ethyl alcohol are achieved, there will still be alcohol and water mixed as a liquid, and
**at some still lower temperature, the remaining alcohol-and-water solution will freeze without an alcohol-poor solid being separable.

[[File:Ice wine grapes.jpg|thumb|left|172px|Fractional freezing of grapes to concentrate grape sugar for making [[ice wine]]]]
The best-known freeze-[[distilled beverage]]s are [[Applejack (beverage)|applejack]] and [[ice beer]]. [[Ice wine]] is the result of a similar process, but in this case, the freezing happens ''before'' the fermentation, and thus it is sugar, not alcohol, that gets concentrated. For an in-depth discussion of the physics and chemistry, see [[eutectic point]].

==Purification of solids==
When a pure solid is desired, two possible situations can occur. If the contaminant is [[solid solution|soluble]] in the desired solid, a multiple stage fractional freezing is required, analogous to multistage [[distillation]]. If, however, a [[eutectic]] system forms (analogous to an [[azeotrope]] in distillation), a very pure solid can be recovered, as long as the liquid is not at its eutectic composition (in which case a mixed solid forms, which can be hard to separate) or above its eutectic composition (in which case the undesired solid forms).

==Concentration of liquids==
When the requirement is to concentrate a liquid phase, fractional freezing can be useful due to its simplicity. Fractional freezing is also used in the production of [[fruit juice]] [[concentrate]]s and other heat-sensitive liquids, as it does not involve heating the liquid (as happens during [[evaporation]]).

===Desalination===
Fractional freezing can be used to [[desalination|desalinate]] sea water. In a process that naturally occurs with sea ice, frozen salt water, when partially melted, leaves behind ice that is of a much lower salt content. Because [[sodium chloride]] lowers the [[melting point]] of water, the salt in sea water tends to be forced out of pure water while freezing, called [[brine rejection]]. Large lakes of higher salinity water, called polynas, form in the middle of floes, and the water eventually sinks to the bottom. Likewise, the frozen water with the highest concentration of salt melts first. Either method decreases the salinity of the remaining frozen water, and after multiple runs the results can be drinkable.

===Alcoholic beverages===
Fractional freezing can be used as a simple method to increase the alcohol concentration in [[brewing|fermented]] alcoholic beverages, a process sometimes called freeze distillation. Examples are [[applejack (beverage)|applejack]], made from [[cider|hard cider]], and [[bock#Eisbock|ice beer]]. In practice, while not able to produce an alcohol concentration comparable to [[distillation]], this technique can achieve some concentration with far less effort than any practical distillation apparatus would require. The danger of freeze distillation of alcoholic beverages, is that unlike heat distillation, where the methanol and other impurities can be separated from the finished product, freeze distillation does not remove them. Thus the ratio of impurities may be increased compared to the total volume of the beverage. This concentration may cause side effects to the drinker, leading to intense [[hangover]]s and a condition known as "apple palsy"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Janik|first1=Erika|title=Apple a global history|date=2011|publisher=Reaktion Books|location=London|isbn=9781861899583|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ok33V8LTP88C&amp;pg=PA63|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (although this term has also simply been used to refer to intoxication,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaufman|first1=Martin|title=The University of Vermont College of Medicine|date=1979|publisher=University of Vermont College of Medicine|location=[Burlington, Vt.]|isbn=9780874511482|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qP3CF3bE5iwC&amp;pg=PR12|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially from applejack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nordegren|first1=Thomas|title=The A-Z encyclopedia of alcohol and drug abuse|date=2002|publisher=Brown Walker Press|location=Parkland, Fla.|isbn=9781581124040|page=78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4yaGePenGKgC&amp;pg=PA78|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

===Alternative fuels===
Fractional freezing is commonly used as a simple method to reduce the [[gel point (petroleum)|gel point]] of [[biodiesel]] and other alternative diesel fuels, whereby esters of higher gel point are removed from esters of lower gel point through cold filtering, or other methods to reduce the subsequent alternative fuel gel point of the fuel blend. This process employs fuel [[stratification (water)|stratification]] whereby components in the fuel blend develop a higher specific gravity as they approach their respective gel points and thus sink to the bottom of the container, where they can be removed.

'''Gelignite''' ({{IPAc-en|'|dʒ|ɛ|l|ɪ|g|n|aɪ|t|}}), also known as '''blasting gelatin''' or simply '''jelly''', is an [[explosive material]] consisting of [[collodion]]-[[cotton]] (a type of [[nitrocellulose]] or [[gun cotton]]) dissolved in either [[nitroglycerine]] or [[nitroglycol]] and mixed with [[wood pulp]] and [[Potassium nitrate|saltpetre]] ([[sodium nitrate]] or [[potassium nitrate]]).

It was invented in 1875 by Swedish chemist [[Alfred Nobel]], who also invented [[dynamite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=25 February 2012|title=How to handle gelignite|last=Braddock|first=Kevin|date=3 February 2011|publisher=Wired Magazine|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2011/03/how-to/how-to-handle-gelignite}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike dynamite, gelignite does not suffer from the dangerous problem of ''sweating'', the leaking of unstable nitroglycerine from the solid matrix. Its composition makes it [[plastic explosive|easily moldable]] and safe to handle without protection, as long as it is not near anything capable of detonating it. One of the cheapest explosives, it burns slowly and cannot explode without a [[detonator]], so it can be stored safely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iie-online.com/ Irish Industrial Explosives Limited website]; accessed 28 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, an explosives certificate, issued by the local Chief Officer of Police, is required for possession of gelignite.&lt;ref&gt;[[CITB]] Construction Ste safety, A13 Statutory Forms&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its widespread civilian use in [[Quarry|quarries]] and [[mining]], it has historically been often used by irregular or paramilitary groups such as the [[Irish Republican Army]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The IRA|last=Coogan|first=Tim Pat|date=January 2002|publisher=Palgrave McMillan|isbn=978-0-312-29416-8|page=379}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, less frequently,{{quantify|date=November 2017}} by British [[loyalist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/dublin/barron03.pdf Houses of the Oireachtas, Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, Interim Report on the Report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings (The Barron Report), December 2003], Appendices: ''The Hidden Hand: The Forgotten Massacre'', pp. 64-71; retrieved 7 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frangex==
The 1970s saw Irish Industrial Explosives Limited producing annually 6000 tonnes of Frangex, a commercial gelignite intended for use in mines and quarries. It was produced at Ireland's largest explosives factory in [[Enfield, County Meath]]. The [[Gardaí]] and the [[Irish Army]] patrolled the area, preventing the IRA from gaining direct access. However, indirectly the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (PIRA) acquired amounts of the material. {{convert|3.5|kg}} was found in the possession of [[Patrick Magee (Irish republican)|Patrick Magee]] at the time of his arrest&lt;ref&gt;Stewart Tendler, "Brighton charge: man in court today", ''[[The Times]]'', 1 July 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; and {{convert|300|kg}} discovered in a [[Truck hijacking|hijacked]] [[road tanker]] in January 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Walker, "Dublin Government embarrassed by Ulster explosives haul as hunt for source continues", ''[[The Times]]'', 20 January 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; 

PIRA volunteer, later informer, [[Sean O'Callaghan]] estimated that planting {{convert|25|lb}} of Frangex would kill everyone within a {{convert|60|ft|adj=on}} radius.&lt;ref name="DM1"&gt;[[James Whitaker (journalist)|Whitaker, James]], "John and Norma aghast at wedding", ''[[The Daily Mirror]]'', 23 May 1998; accessed 23 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Real IRA]] (RIRA) also acquired Frangex, and, in December 2000, 80 sticks were discovered on a farm in [[Kilmacow|Kilmacow, County Kilkenny]], near [[Waterford]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/1084015.stm BBC coverage of gelignite recovery in Ireland], bbc.co.uk; accessed 28 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10136">'''Gypsum recycling''' is the process of turning [[gypsum]] waste into recycled gypsum, thereby generating a raw material that can replace virgin gypsum raw materials in the manufacturing of new products.

== Gypsum waste definition and types ==

Gypsum waste primarily consists of waste from [[Drywall|gypsum boards]], which are wall or ceiling panels made of a gypsum core between paper lining. Such boards are also referred to as plasterboards, drywall, wallboards and gyprock. Gypsum waste in some countries also consists of gypsum blocks and plaster, among others.

Three main types of gypsum waste based on their origin can be distinguished:&lt;ref name=EC&gt;European Commission. http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&amp;n_proj_id=4191 Retrieved 3 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

* Gypsum waste from the manufacturing of gypsum products.
:This waste, which arises at the industrial gypsum production sites, consists of rejects and non-spec materials generated during the manufacturing of gypsum products. The recycling of this waste stream is usually part of the waste avoidance activity of the gypsum plants. The waste is referred to as gypsum manufacturing or production waste and the recycled gypsum obtained from the recycling of this is known as “production waste derived recycled gypsum”.&lt;ref name=wrap&gt;WRAP, Technical Report. Life Cycle Assessment of Plasterboard. 2008. http://www2.wrap.org.uk/downloads/Life_Cycle_Assessment_of_Plasterboard.2a99ccc6.5313.pdf Retrieved 26 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
:

* Gypsum waste from new construction.
:Gypsum waste from new construction activities is typically a clean waste, and primarily consists of off-cuts of plasterboard (drywall, wallboard or gyprock) when the boards have been cut to fit the dimensions of the wall or ceiling. The waste may constitute 15% of the gypsum materials used on the site. Such waste is generally referred to as new construction gypsum waste, and can be reduced by ordering boards “made-to-measure”, but in most markets less than 10% of all orders are “made-to-measure”.

* Gypsum waste from demolition and reconstruction
:This waste arises when already installed plasterboards (drywalls, wallboards or gyprock boards), that usually have been installed many years ago, are taken out in connection with that the building is demolished or renovated. For this reason some refer to this waste as “old gypsum waste”, whereas the trade usually refer to this waste as “demolition waste”. Different from the two other types of gypsum waste described above, this type of gypsum waste from renovation, refurbishment and demolition works is more likely to present a certain degree of contamination, which can be in the form of nails, screws, wood, insulation, wall coverings etc. For this waste to be recyclable it is required that the equipment processing the waste is capable of separating such contamination from the gypsum to arrive at a pure recycled gypsum. New construction and demolition gypsum waste is both arising after the gypsum products have left the manufacturing sites, and together these two waste types are referred to as post consumer gypsum waste.  
The recycled gypsum obtained from this is known as post-consumer recycled gypsum.&lt;ref name=wrap/&gt;

== Gypsum recycling process ==

Gypsum waste can be turned into recycled gypsum by processing the gypsum waste in such a way that the contaminants are removed and the paper facing of the plasterboard is separated from the gypsum core through mechanical processes including grinding and sieving in specialised equipment. Gypsum waste such as gypsum blocks and plaster do not require the removal of paper, as they are not made with paper from the beginning.
It is typical for the gypsum recyclers to accept up to 3 per cent of contamination from other materials. The professional recyclers are capable of handling gypsum waste with nails and screws, wall coverings etc.

== Why should gypsum waste be recycled? ==

Gypsum materials consist of [[calcium sulfate dihydrate]] (CaSO4·2H2O).  [[Sulfate-reducing bacteria]] convert sulfates to toxic [[hydrogen sulphide]] gas; they are killed by exposure to air, but the moist, airless, carbon-containing environment in a landfill is a good habitat for them.  So gypsum put into landfill will decompose, releasing up to a quarter its weight in [[hydrogen sulfide]].&lt;ref&gt;Recycling Council of British Columbia. Why can't I put my leftover gyproc/drywall in the garbage? Retrieved from &lt;http://rcbc.bc.ca/education/faqs/hazard9&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, [[methanogenic bacteria]] also thrive in such an environment, and convert the paper in the plasterboard to [[methane gas]] which is a potent [[greenhouse gas]].&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Protection Agency. State of Ohio. Fact Sheet: Methane and Hydrogen Sulfide Gases at C&amp;DD Landfills. Retrieved from &lt;http://epa.ohio.gov/portals/34/document/guidance/gd_669.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.A.K. Khalil. Non-CO2 greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Annual Review of Energy and the Environment. Vol. 24: 645-661 (Volume publication date November 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Recycling gypsum waste also reduces the need for the quarrying and production of virgin gypsum raw materials.

Recycling one ton of the ordinary gypsum will save 1,000 pounds of black alkali, 1 ton of lactic acid and 500 kwh of energy.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Recycling one metric ton of gypsum will save 28 kwh of energy and 4 pounds of aluminium.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;!-- 500 kWh or 28 kWh? --&gt;

== Rationale for choosing closed loop recycling ==

Gypsum is fully and eternally recyclable &lt;ref&gt;EUROGYPSUM, Environmental and Raw Material Committee. Factsheet on: What is gypsum? http://www.eurogypsum.org/_uploads/dbsattachedfiles/whatisgypsum.pdf Retrieved 26 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and, as a consequence, gypsum waste is one of the few construction materials for which closed loop recycling is possible.

Closed loop recycling of gypsum products involves the collection and processing of the gypsum waste, and the delivery of the obtained recycled gypsum to the manufacturer of gypsum products. It is therefore essential that the recycled gypsum achieves a pre-determined quality suitable for the manufacturing of new gypsum products. Presently there is no European or American standard pre-determining the recycled gypsum's quality and the criteria vary from plant to plant.

By choosing closed loop recycling the need for manufacturers to acquire virgin gypsum is reduced, contributing therefore to promote a sustainable manufacturing process.

The most advanced plants, and most of these are found in the Nordic countries in Europe, have substituted up to 30 per cent of virgin gypsum raw materials with recycled gypsum.&lt;ref&gt;Saint-Gobain Gyproc Finland. Letter written by the Plant Director. June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gypsum recycling in Europe ==

Gypsum recycling in Europe was started by the Danish company [http://gypsumrecycling.biz/ Gypsum Recycling International A/S] in Denmark, in 2001. After a few years the recycling system received waste from approximately 85 per cent of all public civic amenity/recycling centres and a recycling rate of 60 per cent of all gypsum waste was achieved.&lt;ref&gt;WRAP. Plasterboard Case Study. International practice in plasterboard recycling: Denmark. Gypsum Recycling International A/S.&lt;/ref&gt; The system has been exported to cover other European countries.
Today also new recyclers have emerged and gypsum recycling systems have been introduced in more countries, like the UK, France and in the Benelux, but the highest recycling rates for gypsum waste are still found in Denmark, Norway and Sweden. 
January 1, 2013 the European Life + project “Gypsum to Gypsum” &lt;ref&gt;Gypsum to Gypsum: From Production to Recycling, a Circular Economy for the European Gypsum Industry with the Demolition and Recycling Industry. LIFE11 ENV/BE/001039. &lt;http://gypsumtogypsum.org/&gt; Retrieved 26 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; started, with the overall aim of transforming the gypsum demolition waste market to achieve higher recycling rates of gypsum waste, thereby helping to achieve a resource efficient economy.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt; One of the drivers for the project&lt;ref name=EC/&gt; is the target set by the European Union to achieve that 70 per cent of construction and demolition waste is recycled by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;The European Parliament and The Council of the European Union. Directive 2008/98/EC on waste (Waste Framework Directive). Official Journal L 312 , 22/11/2008 P. 0003 - 0030. http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32008L0098:EN:NOT Retrieved 9 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gypsum recycling in North America ==

[http://www.nwgypsum.com/ New West Gypsum Recycling] began recycling of wallboard waste in Canada in 1985. The recycled material is a blend of pre- and post-consumer, wet and dry gypsum waste that is a source of raw material for use in the manufacture of new drywall products. Gypsum Agri-cycle is one of the first companies to recycle drywall in the USA. Gypsum Agri-cycle is another North American recycler of new construction drywall located in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania does not allow Gypsum Agri-cycle to recycle demolition drywall.

[[Zanker_recycling|Zanker Recycling]] began recycling gypsum in the form of sheetrock in 1999. In the recycling process, materials such as wood, metals, and trash are removed on-site where a dozer is used to crush the materials. 

[https://americangypsumrecycling.com/ American Gypsum Recycling]
American Gypsum Recycling was founded in 2018 by Chris Stapleton. His vision for the company is to transform the Northwest drywall waste stream into a valuable product for agriculture and industry.

USA Gypsum located in Denver, PA provides both closed loop recycling and up-cycling reclaimed gypsum to higher value gypsum products such as agricultural gypsum.

'''Hepoxilins''' (Hx) are a set of epoxyalcohol metabolites of [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s (PUFA), i.e. they possess both an [[epoxide]] and an alcohol (i.e. [[hydroxyl]]) residue. '''HxA3''', '''HxB3''', and their non-enzymatically formed isomers are [[nonclassic eicosanoid]] derived from acid the (PUFA), [[arachidonic acid]]. A second group of less well studied hepoxilins, '''HxA4''', '''HxB4''', and their non-enzymatically formed isomers are nonclassical eicosanoids derived from the PUFA, [[eicosapentaenoic acid]]. Recently, 14,15-HxA3 and 14,15-HxB3 have been defined as arachidonic acid derivatives that are produced by a different metabolic pathway than HxA3, HxB3, HxA4, or HxB4 and differ from the aforementioned hepoxilins in the positions of their hydroxyl and epoxide residues. Finally, '''hepoxilin-like''' products of two other PUFAs, [[docosahexaenoic acid]] and [[linoleic acid]], have been described. All of these epoxyalcohol metabolites are at least somewhat unstable and are readily enzymatically or non-enzymatically to their corresponding trihydroxy counterparts, the '''trioxilins''' (TrX).  HxA3 and HxB3, in particular, are being rapidly metabolized to '''TrXA3''', '''TrXB3''', and '''TrXC3'''.  Hepoxilins have various biological activities in animal models and/or cultured mammalian (including human) tissues and cells. The TrX metabolites of HxA3 and HxB3 have less or no activity in most of the systems studied but in some systems retain the activity of their precursor hepoxilins. Based on these studies, it has been proposed that the hepoxilins and trioxilins function in human physiology and pathology by, for example, promoting [[inflammation]] responses and dilating arteries to regulate regional blood flow and blood pressure.

==History==
HxA3 and HxB3 were first identified, named, shown to have biological activity in stimulating insulin secretion in cultured rat pancreatic [[islets of Langerhans]] in Canada in 1984 by CR Pace-Asciak and JM Martin.&lt;ref name="pmid6396652"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pace-Asciak CR, Martin JM |title=Hepoxilin, a new family of insulin secretagogues formed by intact rat pancreatic islets |journal=Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes, and Medicine |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=173–80 |year=1984 |pmid=6396652 |doi=10.1016/0262-1746(84)90069-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Pace-Asciak identified, named, and showed to have insulin [[secretagogue]] activity HxA4 and HxB4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=3012585 |year=1986 |author1=Pace-Asciak |first1=C. R. |title=Formation of hepoxilin A4, B4 and the corresponding trioxilins from 12(S)-hydroperoxy-5,8,10,14,17-icosapentaenoic acid |journal=Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes, and Medicine |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=1–9 |doi=10.1016/0262-1746(86)90017-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomenclature==
HxA3, HxB3, and their isomers are distinguished from most other [[eicosanoid]]s (i.e. [[signaling molecules]] made by oxidation of 20-carbon fatty acids) in that they contain both [[epoxide]] and [[hydroxyl]] residues; they are structurally differentiated in particular from two other classes of arachidonic acid-derived eicosanoids, the [[leukotriene]]s and [[lipoxin]]s, in that they lack [[conjugated double bond]]s. HxA4 and HxB4 are distinguished from HxA3 and HxB3 by possessing four rather than three [[double bond]]s. The 14,15-HxA3 and 14,15-HxB3 non-classical eicosanoids are distinguished from the aforementioned hepoxilins in that they are formed by a different metabolic pathway and differ in the positioning of their epoxide and hydroxyl residues.  Two other classes of epoxyalcohol fatty acids, those derived from the 22-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and the 18-carbon fatty acid, linoleic acid, are distinguished from the aforementioned hepoxilins by their carbon chain length; they are termed hepoxilin-like rather than hepoxilins.&lt;ref name="pmid25240838"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=25240838|doi=10.1016/j.bbalip.2014.09.007|year=2015|author1=Pace-Asciak|first1=C. R.|title=Pathophysiology of the hepoxilins|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta|volume=1851|issue=4|pages=383–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta p 7"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=24021977|pmc=4116325|doi=10.1016/j.bbalip.2013.08.020|year=2014|author1=Muñoz-Garcia|first1=A|title=The importance of the lipoxygenase-hepoxilin pathway in the mammalian epidermal barrier|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta|volume=1841|issue=3|pages=401–8|last2=Thomas|first2=C. P.|last3=Keeney|first3=D. S.|last4=Zheng|first4=Y|last5=Brash|first5=A. R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hepoxilin-like derivative of linoleic acid is formed on linoleic acid that is esterified to a [[sphingosine]] in a complex lipid termed esterified omega-hydroxylacyl-sphingosin (EOS).&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta p 7"/&gt;

===Note on nomenclature ambiguities===
The full structural identities of the hepoxilins and hepoxilin-like compounds in most studies are unclear in two important respects.  First, the ''R'' versus ''S'' [[chirality]] of their hydroxy residue in the initial and most studies thereafter is undefined and therefore given with, for example, HxB3 as 10''R/S''-hydroxy or just 10-hydroxy. Second, the ''R'',''S'' versus ''S'',''R'' chirality of the epoxide residue in these earlier studies likewise goes undefined and given with, for example, HxB3 as 11,12-epoxide.  While some later studies have defined the chirality of these residues for the products they isolated,&lt;ref name="pmid26666460"/&gt; it is often not clear that the earlier studies dealt with products that had exactly the same or a different chirality at these residues.

==Biochemistry==

===Production===
Human HxA3 and HxB3 are formed in a two-step reaction. First, molecular oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is added to carbon 12 of arachidonic acid (i.e. 5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid) and concurrently the 8''Z'' double bond in this arachidonate moves to the 9''E'' position to form the intermediate product, 12''S''-hydroperoxy-5Z,8Z,10E,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid (i.e. 12''S''-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid or 12''S''-HpETE). Second, 12''S''-HpETE is converted to the hepoxilin products, HxA3 (i.e. 8''R/S''-hydroxy-11,12-oxido-5''Z'',9''E'',14''Z''-eicosatrienoic acid) and HxB3 (i.e. 10''R/S''-hydroxy-11,12-oxido-5''Z'',8''Z'',14''Z''-eicosatrienoic acid).&lt;ref name="pmid25240838"/&gt; This two-step metabolic reaction is illustrated below:

&lt;center&gt;
5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 12''S''-hydroperoxy-5Z,8Z,10E,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid  → 8''R/S''-hydroxy-11,12-oxido-5''Z'',9''E'',14''Z''-eicosatrienoic acid + 10''R/S''-hydroxy-11,12-oxido-5''Z'',8''Z'',14''Z''-eicosatrienoic acid&lt;/center&gt;

The second step in this reaction, the conversion of 12(''S'')-HpETE to HxA3 and HxB3, may be catalyzed by ALOX12 as an intrinsic property of the enzyme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=20970452|pmc=3012140|doi=10.1016/j.plipres.2010.10.005|year=2011|author1=Dobrian|first1=A.

[[ALOX15]] is responsible for metabolizing arachidonic acid to 14,15-HxA3 and 14,15-HxB3 as indicated in the following two-step reaction which first forms 15(''S'')-hydroperoxy-5''Z'',8''Z'',11''Z'',13''E''-eicosatetraenoic acid (15''S''-HpETE) and then two specific isomers of 11''S/R''-hydroxy-14''S'',15''S''-epoxy-5''Z'',8''Z'',12''E''-eicosatrienoic acid (i.e. 14,15-HxA3) and 13''S/''R)-hydroxy-14''S'',15''S''-epoxy-5''Z'',8''Z'',11''Z''-eicosatrienoic acid (i.e. 14,15-HxB3):

&lt;/center&gt;

ALOX15 appears capable of conducting both steps in this reaction&lt;ref name="pmid21046276"/&gt; although further studies may show that ALOXE3, non-enzymatic rearrangements, and the reduction of 15''S''-HpETE to 15(''S'')-hydroxy-5''Z'',8''Z'',11''Z'',13''E''-eicosatetraenoic acid (i.e. 15''S''-HETE; see [[15-hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid]]) may be involved in the production of 14,15-HxA3 and 14,15-HxB3 as they are in that of HxA3 and HxB3.

A hepoxilin-like metabolite of linoleic acid forms in the skin of humans and rodents. This hepoxilin is [[esterified]] to [[sphinganine]] in a lipid complex termed EOS (i.e. esterified omega-hydroxyacyl-sphingosine, see [[Lipoxygenase#Biological function and classification#Human lipoxygenases]]) that also contains a [[very long chain fatty acid]]. In this pathway, [[ALOX12B]] metabolizes the esterified linoleic acid to its 9''R''-hydroperoxy derivative and then [[ALOXE3]] metabolizes this intermediate to its 13''R''-hydroxy-9''R'',10''R''-epoxy product. The pathway functions to deliver very long chain fatty acids to the cornified lipid envelope of the skin surface.&lt;ref name="pmid23954555"/&gt;

===Further metabolism===
HxA3 is extremely unstable and HxB3 is moderately unstable, rapidly decomposing to their tri-hydroxy products, for example, during isolation procedures that use an even mildly acidic methods; they are also rapidly metabolized enzymatically in cells to these same tri-hydroxy products, termed trioxilins (TrX's) or trihydroxyeicoxatrienoic acids (THETA's); HxA3 is converted to 8,11,12-trihydroxy-5''Z'',9''E'',14''Z''-eicosatrienoic acid (trioxilin A3 or TrXA3) while TxB3 is converted to 10,11,12-trihydroxy-5''Z'',8''Z'',14''Z''-eicosatrienoic acid (trioxilin B3 or TrXB3).&lt;ref name="pmid25240838"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9540966"/&gt; A third trihydroxy acid, 8,9,12-trihydroxy-5''Z'',10''E'',14''Z'' eicosatrienoic acid (trioxilin C3 or TrXC3), has been detected in rabbit and mouse aorta tissue incubated with arachidonic acid.&lt;ref name="pmid26666460"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12829255"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=12829255|year=2003|author1=Pfister|first1=S.

==Physiological effects==
Virtually all of the biological studies on hepoxilins have been conducted in animals or in vitro on animal and human tissues,  However, these studies give species-specific different results which complicate their relevancy to humans. The useful translation of these studies to human physiology, pathology, and clinical medicine and therapies requires much further study.

===Inflammation===
HxA3 and HxB3 possess pro-inflammatory actions in, for example, stimulating human [[neutrophil]] chemotaxis and increasing the permeability of skin capillaries.&lt;ref name="pmid25240838"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2013.11.001|title=Pathogen induced chemo-attractant hepoxilin A3 drives neutrophils, but not eosinophils across epithelial barriers|journal=Prostaglandins &amp; Other Lipid Mediators|volume=108|pages=1–8|year=2014|last1=Kubala|first1=S.A.|last2=Patil|first2=S.U.|last3=Shreffler|first3=W.G.|last4=Hurley|first4=B.P.|pmc=4004677}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies in humans have found that the amount of HxB3 is &gt;16-fold higher in psoriatic lesions than normal epidermis.

In addition to 12''S''-HETE and 12''R''-HETE (see [[12-HETE#Blood pressure]]), HxA3, TrXA3, and TrXC3 but neither HxB3 nor TrXB3 relax mouse [[mesentery]] arteries pre-contracted by [[thromboxane A2]])(TXA2).  Mechanistically, these metabolites form in the vascular [[endothelium]], move to the underlining smooth muscle, and reverse the smooth muscle contraction caused by TXA2 by functioning as a [[Receptor antagonist]], i.e. they competitively inhibit the binding of TXA2 to its [[thromboxane receptor]], α [[isoform]].&lt;ref name="pmid26666460"/&gt;  Contrastingly, 15-lipoxgenase-derived epoxyalcohol and trihydroxy metabolites of arachidonic acid viz., 15-hydroxy-11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid, 13-hydroxy-14,15-epoxy-eicosatrienoic acid (a 14,15-HxA4 isomer), and 11,12,15-trihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid dilate rabbit aorta by an [[Endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor]] (EDHF) mechanism, i.e. they form in the vessels endothelium, move to underlying smooth muscles, and trigger a response of [[Hyperpolarization (biology)]]-induced relaxation by binding to and thereby opening their [[apamin]]-sensitive small conductance (SK) [[Calcium-activated potassium channel#SK channel]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid26666460"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=19525377|pmc=2724209|year=2009|author1=Chawengsub|first1=Y|title=Role of arachidonic acid lipoxygenase metabolites in the regulation of vascular tone|journal=AJP: Heart and Circulatory Physiology|volume=297|issue=2|pages=H495–507|last2=Gauthier|first2=K.

===Pain perception===
HXA3 and HXB3 appear responsible for [[hyperalgesia]] and tactile [[allodynia]] (pain caused by a normally non-painful stimulus) response of mice to skin inflammation. In this model, the hepoxilins are released in spinal cord and directly activate [[TRPV1]] and [[TRPA1]] receptors to augment the perception of pain.&lt;ref name="pmid25240838"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 22493235 | pmc = 3340022 | year = 2012 | author1 = Gregus | first1 = A.

===Oxidative stress===

===Insulin secretion=== 
The insulin-secreting actions of HxA3 and HxB3 on isolate rat pancreatic islet cells involves their ability to increase or potentiate the insulin-secreting activity of glucose, requires very high concentrations (e.g. 2 micromolar) of the hepoxilins, and has not been extended to intact animals or humans.&lt;ref name="pmid25240838"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid3012585"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pace-Asciak CR |title=Formation of hepoxilin A4, B4 and the corresponding trioxilins from 12(S)-hydroperoxy-5,8,10,14,17-icosapentaenoic acid |journal=Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes, and Medicine |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=1–9 |year=1986 |pmid=3012585 |doi=10.1016/0262-1746(86)90017-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heusler compounds''' are [[magnetic]] [[intermetallic]]s with [[face-centered cubic]] crystal structure and a composition of XYZ (half-Heuslers) or X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;YZ (full-Heuslers), where X and Y are [[transition metal]]s and Z is in the [[p-block]]. Many of these compounds exhibit properties relevant to [[spintronics]], such as [[magnetoresistance]], variations of the [[Hall effect]], [[ferromagnetism|ferro-]], [[antiferromagnetism|antiferro-]], and [[ferrimagnetism]], [[Half-metal|half-]] and [[Semimetal|semimetallicity]], [[semiconductivity]] with spin filter ability, [[superconductivity]], and [[Topological insulator|topological band structure]]. Their magnetism results from a [[double-exchange mechanism]] between neighboring magnetic ions. [[Manganese]], which sits at the body centers of the cubic structure, was the magnetic ion in the first Heusler compound discovered. (See the [[Bethe-Slater curve]] for details of why this happens.)

==Discovery and properties==
The term derives from the name of [[Germany|German]] [[mining engineer]] and [[chemist]] [[Friedrich Heusler]], who studied such a compound in 1903.&lt;ref name="Heu1903"/&gt; It contained two parts [[copper]], one part manganese, and one part [[tin]], that is Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MnSn, and has the following properties. Its magnetism varies considerably with heat treatment and composition.&lt;ref name="Bou2007"&gt;{{cite journal

[[Electron microscope|Electron microscopy]] studies demonstrated that thermal [[Anti-phase domain|antiphase boundaries]] (APBs) form during cooling through the ordering temperatures, as ordered domains nucleate at different centers within the crystal lattice and are often out of step with each other where they meet.&lt;ref name="Bou2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nes1969"/&gt; The anti-phase domains grow as the alloy is annealed. There are two types of APBs corresponding to the B2 and L2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; types of ordering. APBs also form between [[dislocations]] if the alloy is deformed. At the APB the manganese atoms will be closer than in the bulk of the alloy and, for [[non-stoichiometric]] alloys with an excess of [[copper]] (e.g. Cu&lt;sub&gt;2.2&lt;/sub&gt;MnAl&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;), an [[antiferromagnetic]] layer forms on every thermal APB.&lt;ref name="Lap1974"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/14786437408213271 |title=Effect of antiphase boundaries on the magnetic properties of Cu-Mn-Al Heusler alloys |journal=Philosophical Magazine |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=253 |year=2006 |last1=Lapworth |first1=A. J |last2=Jakubovics |first2=J. P |bibcode=1974PMag...29..253L }}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[antiferromagnetic]] layers completely supersede the normal [[magnetic domain]] structure and stay with the APBs if they are grown by annealing the alloy. This significantly modifies the magnetic properties of the non-stoichiometric alloy relative to the stoichiometric alloy which has a normal domain structure. Presumably this phenomenon is related to the fact that pure manganese is an [[antiferromagnet]] although it is not clear why the effect is not observed in the stoichiometric alloy. Similar effects occur at APBs in the ferromagnetic alloy MnAl at its stoichiometric composition.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

Some Heusler compounds also exhibit properties of materials known as ferromagnetic [[shape-memory alloy]]s. These are generally composed of nickel, manganese and gallium and can change their length by up to 10% in a magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3390/ma7053715|pmid=28788645|pmc=5453230|title=Magnetic Properties of the Ferromagnetic Shape Memory Alloys Ni50+xMn27−xGa23 in Magnetic Fields|journal=Materials|volume=7|issue=5|pages=3715–3734|year=2014|last1=Sakon|first1=Takuo|last2=Otsuka|first2=Kohei|last3=Matsubayashi|first3=Junpei|last4=Watanabe|first4=Yuushi|last5=Nishihara|first5=Hironori|last6=Sasaki|first6=Kenta|last7=Yamashita|first7=Satoshi|last8=Umetsu|first8=Rie|last9=Nojiri|first9=Hiroyuki|last10=Kanomata|first10=Takeshi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Electric vehicle]]s first appeared in the mid-19th century. An electric vehicle held the vehicular [[land speed record]] until around 1900. The high cost, low top speed, and short range of [[battery electric vehicle]]s, compared to later [[internal combustion engine]] vehicles, led to a worldwide decline in their use; although electric vehicles have continued to be used in the form of electric trains and other niche uses.

At the beginning of the 21st century, interest in electric and other [[alternative fuel vehicle]]s has increased due to growing concern over the problems associated with [[Fossil fuel|hydrocarbon-fueled]] vehicles, including damage to the [[air pollution|environment]] caused by their [[exhaust gas|emissions]], and the sustainability of the current hydrocarbon-based transportation infrastructure as well as improvements in electric vehicle technology. Since 2010, combined sales of all-electric cars and utility vans achieved 1&amp;nbsp;million units delivered globally in September 2016,&lt;ref name=1miBEVs/&gt; and combined global sales of light-duty all-electrics and plug-in hybrids reached 4&amp;nbsp;million in September 2018.&lt;ref name=Global4mi_1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Global4mi_2/&gt;

==Early history==

===Electric model cars===

The invention of the first model electric vehicle is attributed to various people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|year=2012|title=Looking back to electric cars|journal=Proc. HISTELCON 2012 - 3rd Region-8 IEEE HISTory of Electro - Technology CONference: The Origins of Electrotechnologies|pages=#6487583|doi= 10.1109/HISTELCON.2012.6487583|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1828, [[Ányos Jedlik]], a Hungarian who invented an early type of [[electric motor]], created a small model car powered by his new motor. In 1834, [[Vermont]] [[blacksmith]] [[Thomas Davenport (inventor)|Thomas Davenport]] built a similar contraption which operated on a short, circular, electrified track.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.tecsoc.org/pubs/history/2001/jul6.htm |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091015184824/http://www.tecsoc.org/pubs/history/2001/jul6.htm |dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-10-15|title=Today in Technology History: July 6 |publisher=The Center for the Study of Technology and Science |accessdate=2009-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1834, Professor Sibrandus Stratingh of [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]], the Netherlands and his assistant Christopher Becker created a small-scale electrical car, powered by non-rechargeable [[primary cell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.rug.nl/museum/geschiedenis/hoogleraren/stratingh|title=Sibrandus Stratingh (1785–1841), Professor of Chemistry and Technology|publisher=University of Groningen – English available|accessdate=2009-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electric locomotives===
The first known electric locomotive was built in 1837, in Scotland by chemist [[Robert Davidson (inventor)|Robert Davidson]] of [[Aberdeen]]. It was powered by [[galvanic cell]]s (batteries). Davidson later built a larger locomotive named ''Galvani'', exhibited at the [[Royal Scottish Society of Arts]] Exhibition in 1841. The {{convert|7|LT|kg|adj=on|order=flip}} vehicle had two [[direct-drive]] [[reluctance motor]]s, with fixed electromagnets acting on iron bars attached to a wooden cylinder on each axle, and simple [[commutator (electric)|commutators]].

Rechargeable batteries that provided a viable means for storing electricity on board a vehicle did not come into being until 1859, with the invention of the [[lead–acid battery]] by French physicist [[Gaston Planté]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/education/tutorials/museum/plantebattery.html |title= Planté Battery |publisher=National High Magnetic Field Laboratory |accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.travelsmart.gov.au/teachers/teachers6.html |title=Development of the Motor Car and Bicycle|journal=TravelSmart Teacher Resource Kit|publisher=Government of Australia |year=2003|accessdate=2009-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Camille Alphonse Faure]], another French scientist, significantly improved the design of the battery in 1881; his improvements greatly increased the capacity of such batteries and led directly to their manufacture on an industrial scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.pbs.org/now/shows/223/electric-car-timeline.html|title=Timeline: Life &amp; Death of the Electric Car |date=9 June 2006|accessdate=2009-04-24|series=NOW on PBS|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early electric-powered two-wheel cycle was put on display at the [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|1867 World Exposition]] in Paris by the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] inventor Franz Kravogl, but it was regarded as a curiosity and could not drive reliably in the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://blog.lib.umn.edu/ernst102/architecture/pg15%20copy.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626021051/http://blog.lib.umn.edu/ernst102/architecture/pg15%20copy.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-06-26 |title=Solution: Alternative energy for passenger vehicles |chapter=The Electric/Hybrid Car |author=ernst102 |page=20 (1 on PDF) |accessdate=2009-04-24 |publisher=University of Minnesota }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another cycle, this time with three wheels, was tested along a Paris street in April 1881 by French inventor [[Gustave Trouvé]] &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Wakefield|first=Ernest H.|title=History of the Electric Automobile|publisher=Society of Automotive Engineers|year=1994|isbn=1-56091-299-5|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English inventor [[Thomas Parker (inventor)|Thomas Parker]], who was responsible for innovations such as electrifying the [[London Underground]], overhead tramways in Liverpool and Birmingham, and the smokeless fuel [[coalite]], built the first production electric car in [[London]] in 1884, using his own specially designed high-capacity rechargeable batteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/5212278/Worlds-first-electric-car-built-by-Victorian-inventor-in-1884.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |title=World's first electric car built by Victorian inventor in 1884|date=2009-04-24 |accessdate=2009-07-14 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parker's long-held interest in the construction of more fuel-efficient vehicles led him to experiment with electric vehicles. He also may have been concerned about the malign effects [[smoke]] and [[pollution]] were having in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/fuel-efficiency/hybrid-technology/history-of-electric-cars1.htm |title=What is the history of electric cars? |last=Fuller |first=John |publisher=auto.howstuffworks.com |date=2009-04-09 |accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production of the car was in the hands of the Elwell-Parker Company, established in 1882 for the construction and sale of [[electric tram]]s. The company merged with other rivals in 1888 to form the Electric Construction Corporation; this company had a virtual monopoly on the British electric car market in the 1890s. The company manufactured the first electric '[[dog cart]]' in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.electricvehiclesnews.com/History/historyearlyIII.htm  |title=Electric Vehicles History Part III |accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]] were the first nations to support the widespread development of electric vehicles.&lt;ref name=aboutcom&gt;{{citation|last=Bellis|first=M.|year=2006|title=The History of Electric Vehicles|chapter=The Early Years |publisher=About.com|url=http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aacarselectrica.htm|accessdate=6 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first electric car in Germany was built by the engineer [[Andreas Flocken]] in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;Halwart Schrader: Flocken. In: Deutsche Autos 1885 – 1920. First edition 2002, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Electric trains were also used to transport coal out of [[mining|mines]], as their motors did not use up precious oxygen. Before the pre-eminence of [[internal combustion engines]], electric automobiles also held many speed and distance records.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.macscouter.com/CubScouts/PowWow07/SCCC_2007/CubScoutThemes/Jan_2008.pdf|date=January 2008|title=Cub Scout Car Show|accessdate=2009-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most notable of these records was the breaking of the {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on}} speed barrier, by [[Camille Jenatzy]] on 29 April 1899 in his 'rocket-shaped' vehicle [[Jamais Contente]], which reached a top speed of {{convert|105.88|km/h|abbr=on}}. Also notable was [[Lohner-Porsche|Ferdinand Porsche's]] design and construction of an all-wheel drive electric car, powered by a motor in each hub, which also set several records in the hands of its owner E.W. Hart.

The first electric car in the United States was developed in 1890-91 by William Morrison of [[Des Moines]], [[Iowa]]; the vehicle was a six-passenger wagon capable of reaching a speed of {{convert|14|mph|km/h|order=flip}}. It was not until 1895 that consumers began to devote attention to electric vehicles, after A.L. Ryker introduced the first electric tricycles to the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1896 Riker Electric Tricycle |url= https://www.thehenryford.org/collections-and-research/digital-collections/artifact/274188/ |publisher=The Henry Ford |accessdate=2017-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;, by which point Europeans had been making use of electric tricycles, bicycles, and cars for almost 15 years.

==Golden age==
Interest in motor vehicles increased greatly in the late 1890s and early 1900s.
[[Electricity|Electric]] battery-powered taxis became available at the end of the 19th century. In London, Walter C. Bersey designed a fleet of such cabs and introduced them to the streets of London in 1897. They were soon nicknamed "Hummingbirds" due to the idiosyncratic humming noise they made.&lt;ref name="London taxi"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Licensed London Taxi|url=http://www.london-taxi-cabs.com/information/history-of-the-licensed-london-taxi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year in New York City, the Samuel's Electric Carriage and Wagon Company began running 12 [[electric vehicle|electric]] [[hansom cab]]s.&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=11804573|title=Hailing the History of New York's Yellow Cabs}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company ran until 1898 with up to 62 cabs operating until it was reformed by its financiers to form the [[Electric Vehicle Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Car Companies |url= http://www.earlyelectric.com/carcompanies.html |publisher=Early Electric |accessdate=2017-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EdisonElectricCar1913.jpg|thumb|right|[[Thomas Edison]] and an electric car in 1913]]

Electric vehicles had a number of advantages over their early-1900s competitors. They did not have the vibration, smell, and noise associated with gasoline cars. They also did not require gear changes. (While steam-powered cars also had no gear shifting, they suffered from long start-up times of up to 45 minutes on cold mornings.) The cars were also preferred because they did not require a manual effort to start, as did gasoline cars which featured a hand crank to start the engine.

Electric cars found popularity among well-heeled customers who used them as [[city cars]], where their limited range proved to be even less of a disadvantage.  Electric cars were often marketed as suitable vehicles for women drivers due to their ease of operation; in fact, early electric cars were stigmatized by the perception that they were "women's cars", leading some companies to affix radiators to the front to disguise the car's propulsion system.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

[[File:Detroit Eletric ad 1912.jpg|thumb|1912 [[Detroit Electric]] advertisement]]

Acceptance of electric cars was initially hampered by a lack of power infrastructure, but by 1912, many homes were wired for electricity, enabling a surge in the popularity of the cars. In the United States by the turn of the century, 40 percent of automobiles were powered by steam, 38 percent by electricity, and 22 percent by gasoline. A total of 33,842 electric cars were registered in the United States, and the U.S. became the country where electric cars had gained the most acceptance.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{citation|url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/44957/automobile/259061/Early-electric-automobiles#ref=ref918099 |title=Automobile |accessdate=18 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most early electric vehicles were massive, ornate carriages designed for the upper-class customers that made them popular. They featured luxurious interiors and were replete with expensive materials. Sales of electric cars peaked in the early 1910s.

In order to overcome the limited operating range of electric vehicles, and the lack of recharging infrastructure, an exchangeable battery service was first proposed as early as 1896.&lt;ref name=HistEV/&gt; The concept was first put into practice by [[Hartford Electric Light Company]] through the GeVeCo battery service and initially available for electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle from General Vehicle Company (GVC, a subsidiary of the General Electric Company) without a battery and the electricity was purchased from Hartford Electric through an exchangeable battery. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover maintenance and storage of the truck. Both vehicles and batteries were modified to facilitate a fast battery exchange. The service was provided between 1910 and 1924 and during that period covered more than 6 million miles. Beginning in 1917 a similar successful service was operated in Chicago for owners of Milburn Wagon Company cars who also could buy the vehicle without the batteries.&lt;ref name=HistEV&gt;{{cite book|last=Kirsch|first=David A.|title=The Electric Vehicle and the Burden of History|location=[[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]], [[New Jersey]], and London| year = 2000| pages= 153–162| publisher =[[Rutgers University Press]]|isbn= 0-8135-2809-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After enjoying success at the beginning of the 20th century, the electric car began to lose its position in the automobile market. A number of developments contributed to this situation. By the 1920s an improved road infrastructure required vehicles with a greater range than that offered by electric cars. Worldwide discoveries of large [[petroleum]] reserves led to the wide availability of affordable gasoline, making gas-powered cars cheaper to operate over long distances. Electric cars were limited to urban use by their slow speed (no more than 24–32&amp;nbsp;km/h or 15–20&amp;nbsp;mph&lt;ref name= Britannica/&gt;) and low range (50–65&amp;nbsp;km or 30–40 miles&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;), and gasoline cars were now able to travel farther and faster than equivalent electrics.

Gasoline cars became even easier to operate thanks to the invention of the [[electric starter]] by [[Charles Kettering]] in 1912,&lt;ref Name=R1&gt;{{cite web|title=The Voltec System - Energy Storage and Electric Propulsion|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262004450_The_Voltec_System_Energy_Storage_and_Electric_Propulsion|last1=Matthe|first1=Roland|last2=Eberle|first2=Ulrich|date=2014-01-01|accessdate=2014-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; which eliminated the need of a hand crank for starting a gasoline engine, and the noise emitted by ICE cars became more bearable thanks to the use of the [[muffler]], which [[Hiram Percy Maxim]] had invented in 1897. Finally, [[Assembly line|the initiation of mass production]] of gas-powered vehicles by [[Henry Ford]] brought their price down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McMahon |first=D. |title=Some EV History / History of Electric Cars and Other Vehicles |publisher=Econogics |url= http://www.econogics.com/ev/evhistry.htm |date=13 November 2009 |accessdate=13 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the price of similar electric vehicles continued to rise; by 1912, an electric car sold for almost double the price of a gasoline car.&lt;ref name=aboutcom/&gt;

[[File:Kilowatt.jpg|thumb|The [[Henney Kilowatt]], a 1961 production electric car]]

Most electric car makers stopped production at some point in the 1910s. Electric vehicles became popular for certain applications where their limited range did not pose major problems. [[Forklift truck]]s were electrically powered when they were introduced by Yale in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.com/ygl_history.asp?language=English |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060202065804/http://www.yale.com/ygl_history.asp?language=ENGLISH |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-02-02 |title=1984 |work=Yale History |accessdate=2009-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, especially the United Kingdom, [[milk float]]s were powered by electricity, and for most of the 20th century the majority of the world's battery electric road vehicles were British milk floats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cgl.uwaterloo.ca/~racowan/escape.html |title=Escaping Lock-in: the Case of the Electric Vehicle |publisher=Cgl.uwaterloo.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electric [[golf cart]]s were produced by Lektro as early as 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.lektro.com/about_history.asp |title=Lektro has been making electric vehicles since 1945 |publisher=Lektro |accessdate=13 July 2013 }} Chapter: Lektro history.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1920s, the early heyday of electric cars had passed, and a decade later, the electric automobile industry had effectively disappeared. Michael Brian examines the social and technological reasons for the failure of electric cars in his book ''Taking Charge: The Electric Automobile in America''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Taking Charge: The Electric Automobile in America |last=Schiffer |first=Michael Brian |publisher=Smithsonian |isbn=978-1-58834-076-4 |date=17 March 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Years passed without a major revival in the use of electric cars. Fuel-starved European countries fighting in World War II experimented with electric cars such as the British [[milk float]]s and the French [[Breguet Aviation]] car, but overall, while [[Internal combustion engine|ICE]] development progressed at a brisk pace, electric vehicle technology stagnated. In the late 1950s, Henney Coachworks and the National Union Electric Company, makers of Exide batteries, formed a joint venture to produce a new electric car, the [[Henney Kilowatt]], based on the French [[Renault Dauphine]]. The car was produced in 36-[[volt]] and 72-volt configurations; the 72-volt models had a top speed approaching {{convert|96|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} and could travel for nearly an hour on a single charge. Despite the Kilowatt's improved performance with respect to previous electric cars, consumers found it{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} too expensive compared to equivalent gasoline cars of the time, and production ended in 1961.

==1960s: Revival of interest==
In 1959, [[American Motors|American Motors Corporation]] (AMC) and Sonotone Corporation announced a joint research effort to consider producing an electric car powered by a "self-charging" battery.&lt;ref name="wards2000"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://wardsautoworld.com/ar/auto_rearview_mirror_13/index.html |title=Rearview Mirror |journal=Ward's AutoWorld |date=2000-04-01  |accessdate=2013-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; AMC had a reputation for innovation in economical cars while Sonotone had technology for making sintered plate [[Nickel–cadmium battery|nickel-cadmium batteries]] that could be recharged rapidly and weighed less than traditional lead-acid versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.roger-russell.com/sonopg/sononst.htm |last=Russell|first=Roger |title=Sonotone History: Tubes, Hi-Fi Electronics, Tape heads and Nicad Batteries|publisher=Sonotone Corporation History |accessdate=2013-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Nu-Way Industries showed an experimental electric car with a one-piece plastic body that was to begin production in early 1960.&lt;ref name="wards2000"/&gt;

In the mid 1960s a few battery-electric [[concept cars]] appeared, such as the [[Scottish Aviation Scamp]] (1965),&lt;ref name="design_19660701"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Carr |first=Richard |date=1 July 1966 |title=In search of the town car |journal=Design |issue=211 |pages=29–37 |publisher=Council of Industrial Design }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an electric version of General Motors gasoline car, the [[Chevrolet Corvair|Electrovair]] (1966).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2008/autos/0809/gallery.gm_electric_cars/3.html | work=CNN | title=GM's long road back to electric cars | date=2009-04-07 |accessdate=2013-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; None of them entered production. The 1966 [[Enfield 8000]] did make it into small-scale production, 112 were eventually produced.&lt;ref name=Hereward&gt;{{cite book |title=The Electric Car |first=Michael Hereward |last=Westbrook |publisher=Institute of Engineering &amp; Technology |year=2001 |isbn=0-85296-013-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;In 1967, AMC partnered with Gulton Industries to develop a new battery based on [[Lithium battery|lithium]] and a speed controller designed by Victor Wouk.&lt;ref name=Wouk&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://pr.caltech.edu/periodicals/EandS/articles/LXVII3/Wouk%20Feature.pdf |last= Goodstein|first=Judith|authorlink=Judith R.

[[File:Apollo15LunarRover.jpg|thumb|The three lunar rovers are currently parked on the moon]]

On 31 July 1971, an electric car received the unique distinction of becoming the first manned vehicle to drive on the [[Moon]]; that car was the [[Lunar rover]], which was first deployed during the ''[[Apollo 15]]'' mission. The "moon buggy" was developed by [[Boeing]] and GM subsidiary [[Delco Electronics]] (co-founded by Kettering)&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;  featured a DC drive motor in each wheel, and a pair of 36-volt silver-zinc potassium hydroxide non-rechargeable batteries.

After years outside the limelight, the energy crises of the 1970s and 1980s brought about renewed interest in the perceived independence electric cars had from the fluctuations of the hydrocarbon energy market. General Motors created a concept car of another of their gasoline cars, the [[Chevrolet Chevette|Electrovette]] (1976). At the 1990 [[Los Angeles Auto Show]], [[General Motors]] President [[Roger Smith (executive)|Roger Smith]] unveiled the [[GM Impact]] electric [[concept car]], along with the announcement that GM would build electric cars for sale to the public.

[[File:1997-1999 Honda EV Plus 02.jpg|thumb|The [[Honda EV Plus]], one of the cars introduced as a result of the CARB ZEV mandate]]

In the early 1990s, the [[California Air Resources Board]] (CARB), the government of California's "clean air agency", began a push for more fuel-efficient, lower-emissions vehicles, with the ultimate goal being a move to [[zero-emissions vehicle]]s such as electric vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;Sperling, Daniel and Deborah Gordon (2009), Two billion cars: driving toward sustainability, Oxford University Press, New York, pp. 24 and 189–191, {{ISBN|978-0-19-537664-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=movie&gt;''[[Who Killed the Electric Car?]]'' Directed by Chris Paine, Distributed by Sony Pictures Classics&lt;/ref&gt; In response, automakers developed electric models, including the [[Chrysler TEVan]], [[Ford Ranger EV]] pickup truck, [[GM EV1]] and [[Chevrolet S10 EV|S10 EV]] pickup, [[Honda EV Plus]] hatchback, Nissan lithium-battery [[Nissan Altra|Altra EV]] miniwagon and [[Toyota RAV4 EV]].
The automakers were accused of pandering to the wishes of CARB in order to continue to be allowed to sell cars in the lucrative Californian market, while failing to adequately promote their electric vehicles in order to create the impression that the consumers were not interested in the cars, all the while joining oil industry lobbyists in vigorously protesting CARB's mandate.&lt;ref name=movie/&gt; GM's program came under particular scrutiny; in an unusual move, consumers were not allowed to purchase EV1s, but were instead asked to sign closed-end leases, meaning that the cars had to be returned to GM at the end of the lease period, with no option to purchase, despite leasee interest in continuing to own the cars.&lt;ref name=movie/&gt; Chrysler, Toyota, and a group of GM dealers sued CARB in Federal court, leading to the eventual neutering of CARB's [[Zero-emissions vehicle|ZEV]] Mandate.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

After public protests by EV drivers' groups upset by the repossession of their cars, Toyota offered the last 328 RAV4-EVs for sale to the general public during six months, up until 22 November 2002. Almost all other production electric cars were withdrawn from the market and were in some cases seen to have been [[Car crusher|destroyed]] by their manufacturers.&lt;ref name=movie /&gt; Toyota continues to support the several hundred Toyota RAV4-EV in the hands of the general public and in fleet usage. GM famously de-activated the few EV1s that were donated to engineering schools and museums.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Throughout the 1990s, interest in fuel-efficient or environmentally friendly cars declined among consumers in the United States, who instead favored [[sport utility vehicles]], which were affordable to operate despite their poor fuel efficiency thanks to lower gasoline prices. Domestic U.S. automakers chose to focus their product lines around the truck-based vehicles, which enjoyed larger profit margins than the smaller cars which were preferred in places like Europe or Japan.

Senior leaders at several large [[automaker]]s, including [[Nissan]] and [[General Motors]], have stated that the Roadster was a [[catalyst]] which demonstrated that there is pent-up consumer demand for more efficient vehicles.

So I said, 'How come some tiny little California startup, run by guys who know nothing about the car business, can do this, and we can't?' That was the crowbar that helped break up the log jam.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Friend |first=Tad |url= http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/08/24/090824fa_fact_friend |title=Elon Musk and electric cars |publisher=The New Yorker |date=2009-01-07 |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its main features are that it is [[Direct method (computational mathematics)|direct]] (that is, non-iterative) and that it mathematically guarantees a consistent selection of the correct operative branch of the multivalued problem, also signalling the condition of voltage collapse when there is no solution. These properties are relevant not only for the reliability of existing off-line and real-time applications, but also because they enable new types of analytical tools that would be impossible to build with existing iterative load flow methods (due to their convergence problems). An example of this would be [[decision support software|decision-support tools]] providing validated action plans in real time.

The HELM load flow algorithm was invented by Antonio Trias and has been granted two US Patents.&lt;ref name="patent-7519506"&gt;

A detailed description was presented at the 2012 IEEE PES General Meeting and subsequently published.&lt;ref name="helmpaper"&gt;A. Trias, "The Holomorphic Embedding Load Flow Method", ''IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting 2011'', 22–26 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
The method is founded on advanced concepts and results from [[complex analysis]], such as [[Holomorphic function|holomorphicity]], the theory of [[algebraic curve]]s, and [[analytic continuation]]. However, the numerical implementation is rather straightforward as it uses standard linear algebra and the [[Padé approximant|Padé approximation]]. Additionally, since the limiting part of the computation is the factorization of the admittance matrix and this is done only once, its performance is competitive with established fast-decoupled loadflows.  The method is currently implemented into industrial-strength real-time and off-line packaged [[Energy management system|EMS]] applications.

== Background ==

The [[Power flow study|load-flow]] calculation is one of the most fundamental components in the analysis of power systems and is the
cornerstone for almost all other tools used in [[power system simulation]] and [[Energy management system|management]].  The load-flow equations can be written in the following general form:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\sum_k Y_{ik} V_k + Y_i^{\text{sh}} V_i = \frac{S_i^*}{V_i^*}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

where the given (complex) parameters are the admittance matrix
{{math|&lt;var&gt;Y&lt;sub&gt;ik&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}}, the bus shunt admittances
{{math|&lt;var&gt;Y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;sh&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and the bus power
injections {{math|&lt;var&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}} representing
constant-power loads and generators.

To solve this non-linear system of algebraic equations, traditional
load-flow algorithms were developed based on three iterative
techniques: the [[Gauss-Seidel]] method
&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Ward and H. W. Hale, "Digital Computer Solution of Power-Flow Problems," ''Power Apparatus and Systems, Part III. Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers'', vol.75, no.3, pp.398-404, Jan. 1956.
* A. F. Glimn and G. W. Stagg, "Automatic Calculation of Load Flows", ''Power Apparatus and Systems, Part III. Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers'', vol.76, no.3, pp.817-825, April 1957.

, which has poor convergence properties but very little memory requirements and is
straightforward to implement; the full [[Newton-Raphson]] method
&lt;ref&gt;W. F. Tinney and C. E. Hart, "Power Flow Solution by Newton's Method," ''IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems'', vol. PAS-86, no.11, pp.1449-1460, Nov. 1967.
* S. T. Despotovic, B. S. Babic, and V. P. Mastilovic, "A Rapid and Reliable Method for Solving Load Flow Problems," ''IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems'', vol. PAS-90, no.1, pp.123-130, Jan. 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;
, which has fast (quadratic) iterative convergence
properties, but it is computationally costly; and the Fast Decoupled
Load-Flow (FDLF) method
&lt;ref name="FDLF"&gt;B. Stott and O. Alsac, "Fast Decoupled Load Flow," ''IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems'', vol. PAS-93, no.3, pp.859-869, May 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;
, which is based on Newton-Raphson, but greatly reduces its computational cost by means of a decoupling approximation that is valid in most transmission networks. Many other incremental improvements exist; however, the underlying technique in all of them is still an iterative solver, either of Gauss-Seidel or of Newton type. There are two fundamental problems with all iterative schemes of this type. On the one hand, there is no guarantee that the iteration will always converge to a solution; on the other, since the system has multiple solutions,&lt;ref group="note" name="multsol"&gt;It is well-known that the load flow equations for a power system have multiple solutions. For a network with {{math|&lt;var&gt;N&lt;/var&gt;}} non-swing buses, the system may have up to {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;var&gt;N&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;}} possible solutions, but only one is actually possible in the real electrical system. This fact is used in stability studies, see for instance: Y. Tamura, H. Mori, and S. Iwamoto,"Relationship Between Voltage Instability and Multiple Load Flow Solutions in Electric Power Systems", '' IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems'', vol. PAS-102 , no.5, pp.1115-1125, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; it is not possible to control which solution will be selected. As the power system approaches the point of voltage collapse, spurious solutions get closer to the correct one, and the iterative scheme may be easily attracted to one of them because of the phenomenon of Newton fractals: when the Newton method is applied to complex functions, the basins of attraction for the various solutions show fractal behavior.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This is a general phenomenon affecting the Newton-Raphson method when applied to equations in
''complex'' variables. See for instance [[Newton's method#Complex functions]].&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, no matter how close the chosen initial point of the iterations (seed) is to the correct solution, there is always some non-zero chance of straying off to a different solution. These fundamental problems of iterative loadflows have been extensively documented.&lt;ref&gt;R. Klump and T. Overbye, “A new method for finding low-voltage power flow solutions", ''in IEEE 2000 Power Engineering Society Summer Meeting,'', Vol. 1, pp. 593-–597, 2000.

The key differential advantage of the HELM is that it is fully deterministic and unambiguous: it guarantees that the solution always
corresponds to the correct operative solution, when it exists; and it signals the non-existence of the solution when the conditions are such that there is no solution (voltage collapse). Additionally, the method is competitive with the FDNR method in terms of computational cost. It brings a solid mathematical treatment of the load-flow problem that provides new insights not previously available with the iterative numerical methods.

== Methodology and applications ==

HELM is grounded on a rigorous mathematical theory, and in practical terms it could be summarized as follows:
# Define a specific (holomorphic) embedding for the equations in terms of a complex parameter {{math|&lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt;}}, such that for {{math|&lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt;{{=}}0}} the system has an obvious correct solution, and for {{math|&lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt;{{=}}1}} one recovers the original problem.
# Given this holomorphic embedding, it is now possible to compute univocally power series for voltages as analytic functions of {{math|&lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt;}}. The correct load-flow solution at {{math|&lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt;{{=}}1}} will be obtained by analytic continuation of the known correct solution at {{math|&lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt;{{=}}0}}.
# Perform the analytic continuation using algebraic approximants, which in this case are guaranteed to either converge to the solution if it exists, or not converge if the solution does not exist (voltage collapse).

HELM provides a solution to a long-standing problem of all iterative load-flow methods, namely the unreliability of the iterations in finding the correct solution (or any solution at all).

This makes HELM particularly suited for real-time applications, and mandatory for any EMS software based on exploratory algorithms, such as contingency analysis, and under alert and emergency conditions solving operational limits violations and restoration providing guidance through action plans.

== Holomorphic embedding ==

For the purposes of the discussion, we will omit the treatment of controls, but the method can accommodate all types of controls. For the constraint equations imposed by these controls, an appropriate holomorphic embedding must be also defined.

The method uses an embedding technique by means of a complex parameter {{math|&lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt;}}.
The first key ingredient in the method lies in requiring the embedding to be holomorphic, that is, that the system of equations for voltages {{math|&lt;var&gt;V&lt;/var&gt;}} is turned into a system of equations for functions {{math|&lt;var&gt;V(s)&lt;/var&gt;}} in such a way that the new system defines {{math|&lt;var&gt;V(s)&lt;/var&gt;}} as holomorphic functions (i.e. complex analytic) of the new complex variable {{math|&lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt;}}. The aim is to be able to use the process of analytic continuation which will allow the calculation of {{math|&lt;var&gt;V(s)&lt;/var&gt;}} at {{math|&lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt;{{=}}1}}. Looking at equations ({{EquationNote|1}}), a necessary condition for the embedding to be holomorphic is that {{math|&lt;var&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}} is replaced under the embedding with {{math|&lt;var&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;(s&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/var&gt;}}, not {{math|&lt;var&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;(s)&lt;/var&gt;}}. This is because complex conjugation itself is not a holomorphic function. On the other hand, it is easy to see that the replacement {{math|&lt;var&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;(s&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/var&gt;}} does allow the equations to define a holomorphic function {{math|&lt;var&gt;V(s)&lt;/var&gt;}}. However, for a given arbitrary embedding, it remains to be proven that {{math|&lt;var&gt;V(s)&lt;/var&gt;}} is indeed holomorphic. Taking into account all these considerations, an embedding of this type is proposed:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\sum_k Y_{ik} V_k(s) + Y_i^{\text{sh}} V_i(s)  = s\frac{S_i^*}{V_i ^*(s^*)}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

With this choice, at {{math|&lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt;{{=}}0}} the right hand side terms become zero, (provided that the denominator is not zero), this corresponds to the case where all
the injections are zero and this case has a well known and simple operational solution: all voltages are equal and all flow intensities are zero. Therefore, this choice for the embedding provides at s=0 a well known operational solution.

Now using classical techniques for variable elimination in polynomial systems&lt;ref&gt;B. Sturmfels, "Solving Systems of Polynomial Equations”, CBMS Regional Conference Series in Mathematics 97, AMS, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; (results from the theory of [[Resultants]] and [[Gröbner basis#Elimination|Gröbner basis]] it can be proven that equations ({{EquationNote|1}}) do in fact define {{math|&lt;var&gt;V(s)&lt;/var&gt;}} as holomorphic functions. More significantly, they define {{math|&lt;var&gt;V(s)&lt;/var&gt;}} as [[algebraic curves]]. It is this specific fact, which becomes true because the embedding is holomorphic that guarantees the uniqueness of the result. The solution at {{math|&lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt;{{=}}0}} determines uniquely the solution everywhere (except on a finite number of branch cuts), thus getting rid of the multi-valuedness of the load-flow problem.

The technique to obtain the coefficients for the power series expansion (on {{math|&lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt;{{=}}0}}) of voltages {{math|&lt;var&gt;V&lt;/var&gt;}} is quite straightforward, once one realizes that equations ({{EquationNote|2}}) can be used to obtain them order after order.  Consider the power series expansion for &lt;math&gt;\textstyle V(s)=\sum_{n = 0}^\infty a[n] s^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle 1/V(s)=\sum_{n = 0}^\infty b[n] s^n&lt;/math&gt;. By substitution into equations ({{EquationNote|1}}) and identifying terms at each order in {{math|&lt;var&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}}, one obtains:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\sum_k Y_{ik} a_k[n] + Y_i^{\text{sh}} a_i[n]  = S_i^* b_i^*[n-1] \qquad (n=0, \ldots, \infty)&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

It is then straightforward to solve the sequence of linear systems ({{EquationNote|2}}) successively order after order, starting from {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;{{=}}0}}. Note that the coefficients of the expansions for {{math|&lt;var&gt;V&lt;/var&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;1/V&lt;/var&gt;}} are related by the simple convolution formulas derived from the following identity:
{{NumBlk|:|
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
1 &amp; = V(s)V^{- 1} (s) \\
   &amp; = \left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n s^n\right) \left(\sum_{n = 0}^\infty b_n s^n\right) \\
   &amp; = a_0 b_0  + \left(\sum_{k=0}^1 a_{1-k} b_k\right) s + \left(\sum_{k=0}^2 a_{2-k} b_k\right) s^2  +  \cdots  + \left(\sum_{k = 0}^n a_{n-k} b_k\right) s^n  +  \ldots
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|3}}}}
so that the right-hand side in ({{EquationNote|2}}) can always be calculated from the solution of the system at the previous order. Note also how the procedure works by solving just [[System of linear equations|linear systems]], in which the matrix remains constant.

A more detailed discussion about this procedure is offered in Ref.&lt;ref name="helmpaper" /&gt;

== Analytic continuation ==
Once the power series at {{math|&lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt;{{=}}0}} are calculated to the desired order, the problem of calculating them at {{math|&lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt;{{=}}1}} becomes one of [[analytic continuation]]. It should be strongly remarked that this does not have anything in common with the techniques of [[Homotopy#Applications|homotopic continuation]]. Homotopy is powerful since it only makes use of the concept of continuity and thus it is applicable to general smooth nonlinear systems, but on the other hand it does not always provide a reliable method to approximate the functions (as it relies on iterative schemes such as Newton-Raphson).

It can be proven&lt;ref&gt;L. Ahlfors, ''Complex analysis (3rd ed.)'', McGraw Hill, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; that algebraic curves are complete [[global analytic function]]s, that is, knowledge of the power series expansion at one point (the so-called germ of the function) uniquely determines the function everywhere on the complex plane, except on a finite number of [[Branch point#Branch cuts|branch cuts]]. Stahl’s extremal domain theorem&lt;ref&gt;G. A. Baker Jr and P. Graves-Morris, ''Padé Approximants'' (Encyclopedia of Mathematics and its Applications), Cambridge University Press, Second Ed. 2010, p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; further asserts that there exists a maximal domain for the analytic continuation of the function, which corresponds to the choice of branch cuts with minimal [[Conformal radius#Version from infinity: transfinite diameter and logarithmic capacity|logarithmic capacity]] measure. In the case of algebraic curves the number of cuts is finite, therefore it would be feasible to find maximal continuations by finding the combination of cuts with minimal capacity. For further improvements, Stahl’s theorem on the convergence of Padé Approximants&lt;ref&gt;H. Stahl, “The Convergence of Padé Approximants to Functions with Branch Points”, ''J. Approx. Theory'', '''91''' (1997), 139-204.
* G. A. Baker Jr and P. Graves-Morris, ''Padé Approximants'' (Encyclopedia of Mathematics and its Applications), Cambridge University Press, Second Ed. 2010, p. 326-330.&lt;/ref&gt; states that the diagonal and supra-diagonal Padé (or equivalently, the continued fraction approximants to the power series) converge to the maximal analytic continuation. The zeros and poles of the approximants remarkably accumulate on the set of [[Branch point#Branch cuts|branch cuts]] having minimal capacity.

These properties confer the load-flow method with the ability to unequivocally detect the condition of voltage collapse: the algebraic approximations are guaranteed to either converge to the solution if it exists, or not converge if the solution does not exist.

The LUX experiment, which cost approximately $10 million to build,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/dark-matter-hunt-gets-deep-1.12455 Reich, E. Dark-matter hunt gets deep ''Nature'' 21 Feb 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; is located {{convert|4950|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} underground at the [[Sanford Underground Laboratory]] (SURF, formerly the Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory, or DUSEL) in the [[Homestake Mine (South Dakota)]] in [[Lead, South Dakota]]. The detector is located in the Davis campus, former site of the Nobel Prize-winning [[Homestake experiment|Homestake neutrino experiment]] led by [[Raymond Davis, Jr.|Raymond Davis]]. It is operated underground to reduce the background noise signal caused by high-energy [[cosmic rays]] at the Earth's surface.

[[File:Large Underground Xenon detector inside watertank.jpg|thumb|alt=The Large Underground Xenon experiment installed {{convert|4850|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} underground inside the water tank shield.|The Large Underground Xenon experiment installed {{convert|4850|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} underground inside a {{convert|70000|USgal|m3|abbr=on|order=flip}} water tank shield. The experiment is a 370&amp;nbsp;kg liquid xenon [[time projection chamber]] that aims to detect the faint interactions between [[Weakly interacting massive particles|WIMP]] dark matter and ordinary matter.]]

== Detector principle ==

The detector is isolated from background particles by a surrounding water tank and the earth above. This shielding reduces cosmic rays and radiation interacting with the xenon.

Interactions in liquid xenon generate 175&amp;nbsp;nm ultraviolet [[photons]] and electrons. The photons are immediately detected by two arrays of 61 [[photomultiplier tubes]] at the top and bottom of the detector. These prompt photons are the S1 signal. Electrons generated by the particle interactions drift upwards towards the xenon gas by an electric field. The electrons are pulled in the gas at the surface by a stronger electric field, and produce [[electroluminescence]] photons detected as the S2 signal. The S1 and subsequent S2 signal constitute a particle interaction in the liquid xenon.

The detector is a [[time-projection chamber]] (TPC), using the time between S1 and S2 signals to find the interaction depth since electrons move at constant velocity in the liquid (around 1–2&amp;nbsp;km/s, depending on the electric field). The x-y coordinate of the event is inferred from electroluminescence photons at the top array by statistical methods ([[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] and [[maximum likelihood estimation]]) to a resolution under 1&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Akerib|display-authors=etal |title=Technical results from the surface run of the LUX dark matter experiment|journal=Astroparticle Physics|date=May 2013|volume=45|pages=34–43|doi=10.1016/j.astropartphys.2013.02.001|bibcode = 2013APh....45...34A |arxiv=1210.4569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LUXEvent.pdf|thumb|alt=A particle interaction in the LUX detector|Particle interactions inside the LUX detector produce photons and electrons. The photons (&amp;gamma;), moving at the speed of light, are quickly detected by the photomultiplier tubes. This photon signal is called S1. An electric field in the liquid xenon drifts the electrons towards the liquid surface. A much higher electric field above the liquid surface pulls the electrons out of the liquid and into the gas, where they produce [[electroluminescence]] photons (in the same way that neon sign produces light). The electroluminescence photons are detected by the photomultiplier tubes as the S2 signal. A single particle interaction in the liquid xenon can be identified by the pair of an S1 and an S2 signal.]]&lt;!--(WORKING ON THIS...) The LUX detector is a cylindrical volume filled with liquid and gas xenon. Two arrays of 61 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) each are located at the top and bottom of the cylindrical volume. The photomultiplier tubes detect the light emitted by particle interactions in the liquid xenon. Two wire-strung grids placed at the bottom and top of the liquid surface provide an electric field--&gt;

[[File:Large Underground Xenon detector diagram.png|thumb|alt=Schematic of the Large Underground Xenon detector|Schematic of the Large Underground Xenon (LUX) detector. The detector consists of an inner [[cryostat]] filled with 370&amp;nbsp;kg of liquid xenon (300&amp;nbsp;kg in the inner region, called the "active volume") cooled to −100&amp;nbsp;°C. 122 [[photomultiplier tubes]] detect light generated inside the detector. The LUX detector has an outer cryostat that provides vacuum insulation. An 8-meter-diameter by 6-meter-high water tank shields the detector from external radiation, such as [[gamma ray]]s and [[neutrons]]. ]]
&lt;!-- WILL EDIT THIS SOON     Liquid xenon both [[scintillation (physics)|scintillates]] and becomes ionized when hit by particles like photons, neutrons, and potentially WIMP dark matter. The ratio of scintillation over ionization energy caused by the collision provides a way of identifying the interacting particle. WIMPs ([[Weakly Interacting Massive Particle]]s), the leading theoretical dark matter candidate, could be identified in this way. --&gt;

The PMTs are sensitive to single [[photon]]s and can detect the 175 nm ultraviolet light emitted in liquid xenon particle interactions with an efficiency of about 30&amp;#37;.]] --&gt;

== Finding dark matter ==
WIMPs would be expected to interact exclusively with the liquid xenon nuclei, resulting in nuclear recoils that would appear very similar to neutron collisions.  In order to single out WIMP interactions, neutron events must be minimized, through shielding and ultra-quiet building materials.

In order to discern WIMPs from neutrons, the number of single interactions must be compared to multiple events.  Since WIMPs are expected to be so weakly interacting, most would pass through the detector unnoticed.  Any WIMPs that interact will have negligible chance of repeated interaction.  Neutrons, on the other hand, have a reasonably large chance of multiple collisions within the target volume, the frequency of which can be accurately predicted.  Using this knowledge, if the ratio of single interactions to multiple interactions exceeds a certain value, the detection of dark matter may be reliably inferred.

== Collaboration ==
The "XENON Collaboration" is composed of over 100 scientists and engineers across 18 institutions in the US, Europe, and Middle East. LUX is composed of the majority of the US groups that collaborated in the [[XENON Dark Matter Search Experiment#XENON10|XENON10]] experiment, most of the groups in the [[ZEPLIN-III|ZEPLIN III]] experiment, the majority of the US component of the ZEPLIN II experiment, and groups involved in low-background rare event searches such as [[Super-Kamiokande|Super Kamiokande]], [[Sudbury Neutrino Observatory|SNO]], [[IceCube]], [[Kamland]], [[Enriched Xenon Observatory|EXO]] and [[Double Chooz]].

The LUX experiment's co-spokespersons are [[Richard Gaitskell]] from [[Brown University]] (acting as co-spokesperson since 2007) and Daniel McKinsey from [[Yale University]] (acting as co-spokesperson since 2012). Tom Shutt from [[Case Western Reserve University]] was LUX co-spokesperson between 2007-2012.

== Status ==
Detector assembly began in late 2009.  The LUX detector was commissioned overground at SURF for a six-month run.  The assembled detector was transported underground from the surface laboratory in a two-day operation in the summer of 2012 and began data taking April 2013, presenting initial results Fall 2013.  LUX plans to operate into 2015 and perform a blinded analysis of 300 live days.  The next-generation 7-ton LUX-ZEPLIN has been approved,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2014/jul/15/dark-matter-searches-get-us-government-approval|title = Dark-matter searches get US government approval|date = July 15, 2014|work = Physics World|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; expected to begin in 2020.&lt;ref name=Hamish2016&gt;{{cite web|title=World's most sensitive dark-matter search comes up empty handed|url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2016/jul/22/worlds-most-sensitive-dark-matter-search-comes-up-empty-handed|publisher=physicsworld.com (IOP)|work=Hamish Johnston|date=22 July 2016|accessdate=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Results ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[file: LUX IDM2016 p50 CR.png|thumb|Results from final run (2014-16): upper boundary for cross-section]] --&gt;
Initial unblinded data taken April to August 2013 were announced on October 30, 2013. In an 85 live-day run with 118&amp;nbsp;kg fiducial volume, LUX obtained 160 events passing the data analysis selection criteria, all consistent with electron recoil backgrounds. A [[profile likelihood]] statistical approach shows this result is consistent with the background-only hypothesis (no WIMP interactions) with a [[p-value]] of 0.35. This is the most sensitive dark matter direct detection result in the world, and rules out low-mass WIMP signal hints such as from [[CoGeNT]] and [[Cryogenic Dark Matter Search|CDMS-II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Akerib|first=D.|title=First results from the LUX dark matter experiment at the Sanford Underground Research Facility|url=http://luxdarkmatter.org/papers/LUX_First_Results_2013.pdf|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/science/2013/10/30/dark-matter-search-comes-up-empty/ Dark Matter Search Comes Up Empty] Fox News, 2013 October 30&lt;/ref&gt; These results have struck out some of the theories about WIMPs, which allows researchers to focus on fewer leads.&lt;ref&gt;[https://theconversation.com/dark-matter-experiment-finds-nothing-makes-news-19707 Dark matter experiment finds nothing, makes news] The Conversation, 01 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final run from October 2014 to May 2016, at four times its original design sensitivity with 368&amp;nbsp;kg of liquid xenon, LUX has seen no signs of dark matter candidate—WIMPs.&lt;ref name=Hamish2016 /&gt;

A '''lemon battery''' is a simple [[Electrochemical cell|battery]] often made for the purpose of education. Typically, a piece of [[zinc]] metal (such as a [[galvanized]] nail) and a piece of [[copper]] (such as a penny) are inserted into a lemon and connected by wires.  Power generated by reaction of the metals is used to power a small device such as a [[light emitting diode]] (LED).

The lemon battery is similar to the [[Voltaic pile|first electrical battery]] invented in 1800 by [[Alessandro Volta]], who used [[brine]] (salt water) instead of lemon juice.&lt;ref name=Decker /&gt; The lemon battery illustrates the type of [[chemical reaction]] ([[redox|oxidation-reduction]]) that occurs in batteries.&lt;ref name=Snyder /&gt;&lt;ref name=Oon /&gt;&lt;ref name=Goodisman /&gt; The zinc and copper are called the [[electrode]]s, and the juice inside the lemon is called the [[electrolyte]]. There are many variations of the lemon cell that use different fruits (or liquids) as electrolytes and metals other than zinc and copper as electrodes.

==Use in school projects==
There are numerous sets of instructions for making lemon batteries and for obtaining components such as [[light-emitting diode|light-emitting diodes]] (LEDs), electrical meters ([[multimeter]]s), and zinc-coated ([[galvanized]]) nails and screws.&lt;ref name=HILA /&gt;&lt;ref name=How /&gt; Commercial "potato clock" science kits include electrodes and a low-voltage digital clock. After one cell is assembled, a [[multimeter]] can be used to measure the [[voltage]] or the [[electric current]] from the voltaic cell; a typical voltage is 0.9 V with lemons. Currents are more variable, but range up to about 1 mA (the larger the electrode surfaces, the bigger the current). For a more visible effect, lemon cells can be connected in [[series and parallel circuits|series]] to power an LED (see illustration) or other devices. The series connection increases the voltage available to devices. Swartling and Morgan have published a list of low-voltage devices along with the corresponding number of lemon cells that were needed to power them; they included LEDs, piezeoelectric buzzers, and small digital clocks. With the zinc/copper electrodes, at least two lemon cells were needed for any of these devices.&lt;ref name=Swartling /&gt; Substituting a magnesium electrode for the zinc electrode makes a cell with a larger voltage (1.5−1.6 V), and a single magnesium/copper cell will power some devices.&lt;ref name=Swartling /&gt; Note that incandescent light bulbs from flashlights are not used because the lemon battery is not designed to produce enough electric current to light them. By multiplying the average current of a lemon (0.001A/ 1mA) by the average (lowest) voltage (potential difference) of a lemon (0.7V) we can conclude that it would take more than 6 million lemons to give us the power of an average 4320W car battery.

Many fruits and liquids can be used for the acidic electrolyte. Fruit is convenient, because it provides both the electrolyte and a simple way to support the electrodes. The acid involved in citrus fruits (lemons, oranges, grapefruits, etc.) is [[citric acid]]. The acidity, which is indicated by the measured [[pH]], varies substantially.

[[Potato]]es have [[phosphoric acid]] and work well; they are the basis for commercial "potato clock" kits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unit5.org/christjs/Potato%20Battery.htm |title=Potato Battery |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415133756/http://www.unit5.org/christjs/Potato%20Battery.htm |archivedate=April 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Potato Science and Technology |first1=G. |last1=Lisinska |first2=W. |last2=Leszczynski |publisher=Springer |year=1989 |isbn=9781851663071 |page=286 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WYT1S7qhn4sC&amp;pg=PA286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potato batteries with [[LED]] lighting have been proposed for use in poor countries or by off-grid populations. International research begun in 2010 showed that boiling potatoes for eight minutes improves their electrical output, as does placing slices of potatoes between multiple copper and zinc plates. Boiled and chopped [[Cooking plantain|plantain pith]] (stem) is also suitable, according to Sri Lankan researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Instead of fruit, liquids in various containers can be used. Household vinegar ([[acetic acid]]) works well.&lt;ref name=Heeling /&gt; [[Sauerkraut]] ([[lactic acid]]) was featured in one episode of the US television program ''[[Head Rush (TV series)|Head Rush]]'' (an offshoot of the ''[[MythBusters]]'' program). The sauerkraut had been canned, and became the electrolyte while the can itself was one of the electrodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ9KmHWKobY |title=Head Rush - Sauerkraut Clock |publisher=The Discovery Channel}} Sauerkraut is quite acidic due to the lactic acid produced during fermentation. The sauerkraut clock powers a digital thermometer in this video.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zinc and copper electrodes are reasonably safe and easy to obtain. Other metals such as lead, iron, magnesium, etc., can be studied as well; they yield different voltages than the zinc/copper pair. In particular, magnesium/copper cells can generate voltages as large as 1.6 V in lemon cells. This voltage is larger than obtainable using zinc/copper cells. It is comparable to that of standard household batteries (1.5 V), which is useful in powering devices with a single cell instead of using cells in series.&lt;ref name=Swartling /&gt;

===Learning outcomes===
For the youngest pupils, about ages 5–9, the educational goal is utilitarian:&lt;ref name=Abraham /&gt; batteries are devices that can power other devices, so long as they are connected by a conductive material. Batteries are components in electrical circuits; hooking a single wire between a battery and a light bulb will not power the bulb.

For children in the age range 10−13, batteries are used to illustrate the connection between chemistry and electricity as well as to deepen the circuit concept for electricity. The fact that different chemical elements such as copper and zinc are used can be placed in the larger context that the elements do not disappear or break down when they undergo chemical reactions.

For older pupils and for college students, batteries serve to illustrate the principles of oxidation-reduction reactions.&lt;ref name=Abraham /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schmidt /&gt; Students can discover that two identical electrodes yield no voltage, and that different pairs of metals (beyond copper and zinc) yield different voltages.  The voltages and currents from series and parallel combinations of the batteries can be examined.&lt;ref name=Sorey /&gt;

The current that is output by the battery through a meter will depend on the size of the electrodes, how far the electrodes are inserted into the fruit, and how close to each other the electrodes are placed; the voltage is fairly independent of these details of the electrodes.&lt;ref name=Du /&gt;

==Chemical==
[[File:ZnCuVoltaicCell.svg|thumb|Cross-section of a copper/zinc cell with a sulfuric acid electrolyte. The drawing illustrates the atomic model for the chemical reactions; lemon cells have essentially the same model. Zinc atoms enter the electrolyte as ions missing two electrons (Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;). Two negatively charged electrons from the dissolved zinc atom are left in the zinc metal. Two of the dissolved protons (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) in the acidic electrolyte combine with each other and two electrons to form molecular hydrogen H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which bubbles off of the copper electrode. The electrons lost from the copper are made up by moving two electrons from the zinc through the external wire. |alt=Cross-section drawing of a cup. The cup is mostly full, apparently with water. Two rectangular shapes indicate a copper and a zinc piece, each of which is mostly submerged in the water. The water has about a dozen symbols in various positions: Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;. There's a circle above the water with the symbol H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; inside it. There's a wire connecting the zinc and copper pieces outside of the water; 2 electrons (e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) are shown along the wire with arrows pointing from the zinc to the copper.]]
Most textbooks present the following model for the chemical reactions of a lemon battery.&lt;ref name=Decker /&gt;&lt;ref name=Oon /&gt;&lt;ref name=Naidu /&gt; When the cell is providing an electric current through an external circuit, the metallic zinc at the surface of the zinc electrode is dissolving into the solution. Zinc atoms dissolve into the liquid electrolyte as electrically charged [[ions]] (Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), leaving 2 negatively charged [[electron]]s (e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) behind in the metal:
:Zn → Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; .
This reaction is called [[redox|oxidation]]. While zinc is entering the electrolyte, two positively charged [[hydrogen]] ions (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) from the electrolyte combine with two electrons at the copper electrode's surface and form an uncharged hydrogen molecule (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;):
:2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;+ 2e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; .

This reaction is called reduction. The electrons used in the copper to form the molecules of hydrogen are transferred from the zinc through an external wire connecting between the copper and the zinc. The hydrogen molecules formed on the surface of the copper by the reduction reaction ultimately bubble away as hydrogen gas.&lt;!--needs photo--&gt;

==Experiment results==
This model of the chemical reactions makes several predictions that were examined in experiments published by Jerry Goodisman in 2001. Goodisman notes that numerous recent authors propose chemical reactions for the lemon battery that involve dissolution of the copper electrode into the electrolyte. Goodisman excludes this reaction as being inconsistent with the experiments, and notes that the correct chemistry, which involves the evolution of hydrogen at the copper electrode but also can use silver instead of copper, has been known for many years.&lt;ref name=Goodisman /&gt; Most of the detailed predictions of the model apply to the battery's voltage that is measured directly by a meter; nothing else is connected to the battery. When the electrolyte was modified by adding zinc sulfate (ZnSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), the voltage from the cell was reduced as predicted using the [[Nernst equation]] for the model. The Nernst equation essentially says how much the voltage drops as more zinc sulfate is added. The addition of copper sulfate (CuSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) did not affect the voltage. This result is consistent with the fact that copper atoms from the electrode are not involved in the chemical reaction model for the cell.

When the battery is hooked up to an external circuit and a significant electric current is flowing, the zinc electrode loses mass, as predicted by the zinc oxidation reaction above. Similarly, hydrogen gas evolves as bubbles from the copper electrode. Finally, the voltage from the cell depended upon the acidity of the electrolyte, as measured by its pH; decreasing acidity (and increasing pH) causes the voltage to fall. This effect is also predicted by the Nernst equation; the particular acid that was used (citric, hydrochloric, sulfuric, etc.) doesn't affect the voltage except through the pH value.

The Nernst equation prediction failed for strongly acid electrolytes (pH &lt; 3.4), when the zinc electrode dissolves into the electrolyte even when the battery is not providing any current to a circuit. The two oxidation-reduction reactions listed above only occur when electrical charge can be transported through the external circuit. The additional, open-circuit reaction can be observed by the formation of bubbles at the zinc electrode under open-circuit. This effect ultimately limited the voltage of the cells to 1.0 V near room temperature at the highest levels of acidity.

===Energy source===

The energy comes from the chemical change in the zinc when it dissolves into the acid. The energy does not come from the lemon or potato. The zinc is [[oxidized]] inside the lemon, exchanging some of its electrons with the acid in order to reach a lower energy state, and the energy released provides the power.&lt;ref name=Goodisman /&gt;

In current practice, zinc is produced by [[electrowinning]] of [[zinc sulfate]] or pyrometallurgical reduction of zinc with carbon, which requires an energy input. The energy produced in the lemon battery comes from reversing this reaction, recovering some of the energy input during the zinc production.

===Smee cell===
From 1840 to the late 19th century, large, voltaic cells using a zinc electrode and a sulfuric acid electrolyte were widely used in the printing industry. While copper electrodes like those in lemon batteries were sometimes used, in 1840 [[wikisource:Smee, Alfred (DNB00)|Alfred Smee]] invented a refined version of this cell that used silver with a rough platinum coating instead of a copper electrode.&lt;ref name=Magazine /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bottone /&gt; Hydrogen gas clinging to the surface of a silver or copper electrode reduces the electric current that can be drawn from a cell; the phenomenon is called "polarization".&lt;ref name=Naidu /&gt;&lt;ref name=Watt /&gt; The roughened, "platinized" surface speeds up the bubbling of the hydrogen gas, and increases the current from the cell. Unlike the zinc electrode, the copper or platinized silver electrodes are not consumed by using the battery, and the details of this electrode do not affect the cell's voltage. The Smee cell was convenient for [[electrotyping]], which produced copper plates for letterpress printing of newspapers and books, and also statues and other metallic objects.&lt;ref name=Bottone /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gordon /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hatch /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sprague /&gt;&lt;ref name=Scott /&gt;

The Smee cell used [[amalgamated zinc]] instead of pure zinc; the surface of amalgamated zinc has been treated with mercury.&lt;ref name=Sprague /&gt; Apparently amalgamated zinc was less prone to degradation by an acidic solution than is pure zinc.&lt;ref name=Park /&gt; Amalgamated zinc and plain zinc electrodes give essentially the same voltage when the zinc is pure.&lt;ref name=van&gt;The standard electrode potential is 0.76 V for both pure zinc and for amalgamated zinc. See {{cite book |last=Vanýsek |first=Petr |year=2012 |editor-last=Haynes |editor-first=William M. |chapter=Electrochemical Series |pages=5–80 |title=Handbook of Chemistry and Physics: 93rd Edition |publisher=Chemical Rubber Company |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-BzP7Rkl7WkC&amp;pg=SA5-PA80 |isbn=9781439880494}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With the imperfectly refined zinc in 19th century laboratories they typically gave different voltages.&lt;ref name=Park /&gt;

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3528">In semiconductors, [[valence bands]] are well characterized  by 3 Luttinger parameters. At the ''Г''-point in the [[band structure]], &lt;math&gt;p_{3/2} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_{1/2} &lt;/math&gt; orbitals form valence bands. But spin-orbit coupling splits sixfold degeneracy into high energy 4-fold and lower energy 2-fold bands. Again 4-fold degeneracy is lifted into heavy- and light hole bands by phenomenological Hamiltonian by [[J. M. Luttinger]].

==Three valence band state==
In the presence of [[spin-orbit interaction]], total angular momentum should take part in. From the three valence band, l=1 and s=1/2 state generate six state of  |j,m&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;&gt; as &lt;math&gt; |{3 \over 2}, \pm {3 \over 2} \rangle, |{3 \over 2}, \pm {1 \over 2}\rangle, |{1 \over 2}, \pm {1 \over 2}\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

The spin-orbit interaction from the relativistic quantum mechanics, lowers the energy of ''j''=1/2 states down.

==Phenomenological Hamiltonian for the ''j''=3/2 states==
Phenomenological Hamiltonian in spherical approximation is written as&lt;ref name="Hartmut Haug, Stephan W. Koch 0"&gt;{{cite book |title=Quantum Theory of the Optical and Electronic Properties of Semiconductors |author=Hartmut Haug, Stephan W. Koch |page=46 |year=2004 |edition=4th |publisher=World Scientific}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt; H= {{\hbar^2} \over {2m_0}} [(\gamma  _1+{{5} \over {2}} \gamma _2) \mathbf{k}^2 -2\gamma_2 (\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{J})^2]&lt;/math&gt;

Phenomenological Luttinger parameters &lt;math&gt; \gamma _i &lt;/math&gt; are defined as

&lt;math&gt; \alpha = \gamma _1 + {5 \over 2} \gamma _2 &lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt; \beta = \gamma _2   &lt;/math&gt;

If we take &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{k} &lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{k}=k \hat{e}_z &lt;/math&gt;, the Hamiltonian is diagonalized for &lt;math&gt;j=3/2&lt;/math&gt; states.

&lt;math&gt; E = { {\hbar^2 k^2} \over {2m_0} }( \gamma _1 + {{5} \over {2}} \gamma _2 - 2 \gamma _2 m_j^2)&lt;/math&gt;

Two degenerated resulting eigenenergies are

&lt;math&gt; E _{hh} = { {\hbar^2 k^2} \over {2m_0} }( \gamma _1 - 2 \gamma _2)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; m_j = \pm {3 \over 2} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; E _{lh} = { {\hbar^2 k^2} \over {2m_0} }( \gamma _1 + 2 \gamma _2)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; m_j = \pm {1 \over 2} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; E_{hh} &lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt; E_{lh} &lt;/math&gt;) indicates heav-(light-) hole band energy. If we regard the electrons as nearly free electrons, the Luttinger parameters describe [[Effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]] of electron in each bands.

==Measurement of Luttinger parameters==
Luttinger parameter can be measured by Hot-electron luminescence experiment.

==Example: GaAs==
&lt;math&gt; \epsilon _{h,l} = - {{1} \over {2}} \gamma _{1} k^{2} \pm [ {\gamma_{2}}^{2} k^{4} + 3 ({\gamma _{3}}^{2} - {\gamma _{2}}^{2} ) \times ( {k_{x}}^{2} {k_{z}}^{2} + {k_{x}}^{2} {k_{y}}^{2} + {k_{y}}^{2}{k_{z}}^{2})]^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;

The '''[[Elias Burstein|Moss]]–Burstein effect''', also known as the Burstein-Moss shift, is the phenomenon of which the apparent [[band gap]] of a [[semiconductor]] is increased as the absorption edge is pushed to higher energies as a result of some states close to the [[conduction band]] being populated. This is observed for a degenerate electron distribution such as that found in some [[Degenerate semiconductor]]s and is known as a '''Moss–Burstein shift'''.

[[File:MBshift for wiki.jpg|thumb|right]]
The effect occurs when the electron carrier concentration exceeds the conduction band edge density of states, which corresponds to degenerate [[Doping (semiconductor)|doping in semiconductors]]. In nominally doped semiconductors, the [[Fermi level]] lies between the conduction and [[valence band]]s. For example, in n-doped semiconductor, as the doping concentration is increased, electrons populate states within the conduction band which pushes the Fermi level to higher energy. In the case of degenerate level of doping, the Fermi level lies inside the conduction band.  The "apparent" band gap of a semiconductor can be measured using transmission/reflection [[spectroscopy]].  In the case of a degenerate semiconductor, an electron from the top of the valence band can only be excited into conduction band above the Fermi level (which now lies in conduction band) since all the states below the Fermi level are occupied states.  [[Pauli's exclusion principle]] forbids excitation into these occupied states.  Thus we observe an increase in the apparent band gap.  Apparent band gap = Actual band gap + Moss-Burstein shift (as shown in the figure).

Negative Burstein shifts can also occur. These are due to band structure changes due to doping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= John.C Inkson|title= Many-Body Theory of Solids|  year= 1984 | isbn= 0-306-41326-4 | chapter= ch. 9.5, page 210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[yttrium lithium fluoride|YLF]] crystal (LiYF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is naturally [[birefringence|birefringent]], and commonly used laser transitions occur at 1047&amp;nbsp;nm and 1053&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;[Thomas M.

It is used in [[Q-switching|Q-switched]] systems in part due 
to its relatively long fluorescence lifetime.
As with [[Nd:YAG laser]]s, [[harmonic generation]] is frequently

Neodymium-doped YLF can provide higher pulse energies than Nd:YAG for repetition rates of a few kHz or less. Compared to Nd:YAG, the Nd:YLF crystal is very [[brittle]] 
and fractures easily. It is also slightly water-[[solubility|soluble]] — a YLF laser rod may very

'''Patterned vegetation''' is a [[vegetation community]] that exhibits distinctive and repetitive patterns. Examples of patterned vegetation include [[fir wave]]s, [[tiger bush]], and [[string bog]]. The patterns typically arise from an interplay of phenomena that differentially encourage [[plant]] growth or mortality. A coherent pattern arises because there is a strong directional component to these phenomena, such as [[wind]] in the case of fir waves, or [[surface runoff]] in the case of tiger bush.
The regular patterning of some types of vegetation is a striking feature of some landscapes. Patterns can include relatively evenly spaced patches, parallel bands or some intermediate between those two. These patterns in the vegetation can appear without any underlying pattern in soil types, and are thus said to “self-organize” rather than be determined by the environment.
Several of the mechanisms underlying patterning of vegetation have been known and studied since at least the middle of the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Watt, A |title=Pattern and process in the plant community |journal=Journal of Ecology |volume=35 |issue=1/2 | pages=1–22 |year=1947 |doi=10.2307/2256497|jstor=2256497 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, mathematical models replicating them have only been produced much more recently. The [[self-organization]] of complex spatial patterns can be generated from relatively simple mathematical expressions, often called a [[Turing pattern]]. These occur at many scales of life, from cellular development (where they were first proposed) to pattern formation on animal pelts to sand dunes and patterned landscapes (see also [[pattern formation]]). In their simplest form these models require two interactions at differing scales: local facilitation and more distant antagonism. For example, when Sato and Iwasa &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Satō K, Iwasa Y |title=Modeling of wave regeneration in subalpine ''Abies'' forests: population dynamics with spatial structure |journal=Ecology |volume=74 |issue=5 | pages=1538–1554 |year=1993 |doi=10.2307/1940081|jstor=1940081 }}&lt;/ref&gt; produced a simple model of [[fir waves]] in the Japanese Alps, they assumed that trees exposed to cold winds would suffer mortality from frost damage, but upwind trees would protect nearby downwind trees from wind. Banding appears because the protective boundary layer created by the wind-most trees is eventually disrupted by turbulence, exposing more distant downwind trees to freezing damage once again.
When there is no directional resource flow across the landscape, regularly spaced patches or spots appear. In contrast, if there is a clear directionality to some important factor (such as a freezing wind or surface flow down a slope), then regularly spaced bands develop perpendicular to the flow.
Since then theoretical models have been published documenting a wide variety of patterned landscapes, including: 
	semi-arid “tiger bush”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Klausmeier, C |title=Regular and irregular patterns in semiarid vegetation |journal=Science |volume=284 |issue=5421 | pages=1826–1828 |year=1999 |doi=10.1126/science.284.5421.1826}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kéfi S, Eppinga MB, De Ruiter PC, Rietkerk M |title=Bistability and regular spatial patterns in arid ecosystems |journal=Theoretical Ecology |volume=34 | pages=257–269 |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Orthorhombic bulk black phosphorus.png|thumb|Bulk black phosphorus consists of multiple phosphorene sheets]]
'''Phosphorene''' is a [[2D materials|two-dimensional material]] and [[Allotropes of phosphorus|allotrope]] of [[phosphorus]]. Phosphorene can be viewed as a single layer of [[black phosphorus]], much in the same way that [[graphene]] is a single layer of [[graphite]]. Phosphorene is predicted to be a strong competitor to graphene because, in contrast to graphene, phosphorene has a [[band gap]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Five reasons phosphorene may be a new wonder material – MagLab|url = https://nationalmaglab.org/news-events/feature-stories/phosphorene-wonder-material|website = nationalmaglab.org|date = 28 July 2015 |author=Roberts, Kristin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carvalho|first=Alexandra|last2=Wang|first2=Min|last3=Zhu|first3=Xi|last4=Rodin|first4=Aleksandr S.|last5=Su|first5=Haibin|last6=Castro Neto|first6=Antonio H.|date=2016|title=Phosphorene: from theory to applications|journal=Nature Reviews Materials|volume=1|issue=11|doi=10.1038/natrevmats.2016.61|pmid=|pages=16061|bibcode=2016NatRM...116061C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phosphorene was first isolated in 2014 by mechanical exfoliation.&lt;ref  name=":-1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Black Phosphorus Field Effect Transistors| journal = Nature Nanotechnology|date = 2014|pages = 372–377|volume = 9| issue = 5|doi = 10.1038/nnano.2014.35|first = Likai|last = Li|first2 = Yijun|last2 = Yu|first3 = Guo|last3 = Jun Ye|first4 = Qingqin|last4 = Ge|first5 = Xuedong|last5 = Ou|first6 = Hua|last6 = Wu|first7 = Yuanbo|last7 = Zhang|pmid=24584274| bibcode = 2014NatNa...9..372L|arxiv = 1401.4117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref  name=":-2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Electric Field Effect in Ultrathin Black Phosphorus| journal  = Applied Physics Letters|date = 2014|pages = 103106 |volume = 104| issue  = 10| doi = 10.1063/1.4868132|first = Steven P.|last = Koenig|first2 = Rostislav A.|last2 = Doganov|first3 = Henrrik|last3 = Schmidt|first4 = Antonio H.|last4 = Castro Neto|first5 = Barbaros|last5 = Ozyilmaz| bibcode  = 2014ApPhL.104j3106K|arxiv = 1402.5718}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Phosphorene: An Unexplored 2D Semiconductor with a High Hole Mobility|journal = ACS Nano|date = 2014|pages = 4033–4041|volume = 8|issue = 4|doi = 10.1021/nn501226z|pmid = 24655084|first = Han|last = Liu|first2 = Adam T.|last2 = Neal|first3 = Zhen|last3 = Zhu|first4 = Zhe|last4 = Luo|first5 = Xianfan|last5 = Xu|first6 = David|last6 = Tománek|first7 = Peide D.|last7 = Ye|arxiv = 1401.4133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s [[black phosphorus]], a layered [[semiconductor|semiconducting]] allotrope of phosphorus, was synthesized, which exhibited high [[carrier mobility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Electrical and Optical Properties of Crystalline Black Phosphorus|journal = Journal of Applied Physics|date = 1963|pages = 1853–1860|volume = 34|issue = 7|doi = 10.1063/1.1729699|first = Douglas|last = Warschauer|bibcode = 1963JAP....34.1853W}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, several groups&lt;ref name=":-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":-2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; introduced single-layer phosphorene, a monolayer of black phosphorus.

Synthesis of phosphorene is a significant challenge. Currently, there are two main ways of phosphorene production: scotch-tape-based microcleavage&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and liquid exfoliation,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; while several other methods are being developed as well. Phosphorene production from plasma etching is also reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Phosphorene excites materials scientists|url = http://www.nature.com/news/phosphorene-excites-materials-scientists-1.14668|website = Nature News &amp; Comment|date = 4 February 2014|author=Reich, Eugenie Samuel }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In scotch-tape-based microcleavage,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; phosphorene is mechanically exfoliated from a bulk of black phosphorus crystal using scotch-tape. Phosphorene is then transferred on a Si/SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; substrate, where it is then cleaned with acetone, isopropyl alcohol and methanol to remove any scotch tape residue. The sample is then heated to 180&amp;nbsp;°C to remove solvent residue.

In the liquid exfoliation method first reported by Brent et al. in 2014&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; and modified by others,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; bulk black phosphorus is first ground in a mortar and pestle and then sonicated in deoxygenated, anhydrous organic liquids such as NMP  under inert atmosphere using low-power bath sonication. Suspensions are then centrifuged for 30 minutes to filter out the unexfoliated black phosphorus. Resulting 2D monolayer and few-layer phosphorene unoxidized and crystalline structure, while exposure to air oxidizes the phosphorene and produces acid.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Another variation of liquid exfoliation&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; is “basic N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) liquid exfoliation”. Bulk black phosphorene is added to a saturated NaOH/NMP solution, which is further sonicated for 4 hours to conduct liquid exfoliation. The solution is then centrifuged twice, first for 10 minutes to remove any unexfoliated black phosphorus and then for 20 minutes at higher speed to separate thick layers of phosphorene (5–12 layers) from NMP. The supernatant then is centrifuged again at higher speed for another 20 minutes to separate thinner layers of phosphorene (1–7 layers). The precipitate from centrifugation is then redispersed in water and washed several times by deionized water. Phosphorene/water solution is dropped onto silicon with a 280-nm SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; surface, where it is further dried under vacuum. NMP liquid exfoliation method was shown to yield phosphorene with controllable size and layer number, excellent water stability and in high yield.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The high yield production of phosphorene has been demonstrated by many groups in solvents, but to realize the potential applications of this material, it is crucial to deposit these free-standing nanosheets in solvents systematically on substrates.

Kaur et al.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/srep34095 | pmid = 27671093| pmc = 5037434| title = Large Area Fabrication of Semiconducting Phosphorene by Langmuir-Blodgett Assembly| journal = Sci.

This is the first study which provides a straightforward and versatile solution towards the challenge of assembling nanosheets of phosphorene onto various supports and subsequently use these sheets in an electronic device. Therefore, wet assemblies techniques like Langmuir-Blodgett serves as a very valuable new entry point for the exploration of electronic as well as opto-electronic properties of phosphorene as well as other 2D layered inorganic materials.

It is still a challenge to directly epitaxially grow 2D phosphorene because the stability of black phosphorene is highly sensitive to substrate, which is understanding by theoretical simulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/jacs.5b12472 | title = The Critical Role of Substrate in Stabilizing Phosphorene Nanoflake: A Theoretical Exploration| journal = J.

== Properties ==

=== Structure ===
[[File:Phosphorene TEM2.jpg|thumb|Top-view electron micrograph of phosphorene&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;]]
Phosphorene [[2D materials]] are composed of individual layers held together by [[van der Waals force]]s in lieu of [[Covalent bond|covalent]] or [[Ionic bonding|ionic]] bonds that are found in most materials. There are five electrons on 3p orbitals of phosphorus atom, thus, giving rise to sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; [[Hybridization (chemistry)|hybridization]] of phosphorus atom within phosphorene structure. Monolayered phosphorene exhibits the structure of a quadrangular pyramid because three electrons of P atom bond with three other P atoms covalently at 2.18 Å leaving one lone pair.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Two of the phosphorus atoms are in the plane of the layer at 99° from one another, and the third phosphorus is between the layers at 103°, yielding an average angle of 102°.

According to [[density functional theory]] (DFT) calculations, phosphorene forms in a honeycomb lattice structure with notable nonplanarity in the shape of structural ridges. It is predicted that crystal structure of black phosphorus can be discriminated under high pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Crystal Structures Adopted by Black Phosphorus at High Pressures|journal = Science|date = 29 March 1963|pmid = 17757066|pages = 1291–1292|volume = 139|issue = 3561|doi = 10.1126/science.139.3561.1291|first = John C.|last = Jamieson|bibcode = 1963Sci...139.1291J}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is mostly due to the [[Anisotropy|anisotropic]] compressibility of black phosphorus because of the asymmetrical crystal structures. Subsequently, the van der Waals bond can be greatly compressed in the z-direction. However, there is a great variation in compressibility across the orthogonal x-y plane.

It is reported that controlling the centrifugal speed of production may aid in regulating the thickness of a material. For example, centrifuging at 18000 rpm during synthesis produced phosphorene with an average diameter of 210&amp;nbsp;nm and a thickness of 2.8 ± 1.5&amp;nbsp;nm (2–7 layers).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Band gap and conductivity properties ===

J. | last5 = Lewis | first5 = D. J. | last6 = O'Brien | first6 = P. }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Phosphorene has a thickness dependent direct band gap that changes to 1.88 eV in a monolayer from 0.3 eV in the bulk.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Increase in band gap value in single-layer phosphorene is predicted to be caused by the absence of interlayer hybridization near the top of the valence and bottom of the conduction band.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A pronounced peak centered at around 1.45 eV suggests the band gap structure in few- or single-layer phosphorene difference from bulk crystals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In vacuum or on weak substrate, an interesting reconstruction with nanotubed termination of phosphorene edge is very easy to happen, transforming phosphorene edge from metallic to semiconducting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1039/C6NR06201F |url=https://zenodo.org/record/898772| pmid = 27725985| title = Nanotube-Terminated Zigzag Edge of Phosphorene formed by Self-Rolling Reconstruction| journal = Nanoscale| year = 2016| last1 = Gao | first1 = Junfeng | volume=8 | issue = 41| pages=17940–17946|arxiv=1609.05997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the degradation process, phosphorene (solid) reacts with oxygen/water to develop liquid phase [[acid]] 'bubbles' on the surface, and finally evaporate (vapor) to fully vanish (S-B-V degradation) and severely reducing overall quality.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Transistor ===
Researchers&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; have fabricated [[transistor]]s of phosphorene to examine its performance in actual devices. Phosphorene-based transistor consists of a channel of 1.0 μm and uses few layered phosphorene with a thickness varying from 2.1 to over 20&amp;nbsp;nm. Reduction of the total [[Resistance (electricity)|resistance]] with decreasing gate voltage is observed, indicating the [[P-type semiconductor|p-type]] characteristic of phosphorene. Linear I-V relationship of transistor at low drain bias suggests good contact properties at the phosphorene/metal interface. Good current saturation at high drain bias values was observed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, it was seen that the mobility is reduced in few-layer phosphorene when compared to bulk black phosphorus. [[Field-effect mobility]] of phosphorene-based transistor shows a strong thickness dependence, peaking at around 5&amp;nbsp;nm and decrease steadily with further increase of crystal thickness.

[[Atomic layer deposition|Atomic layer deposition (ALD)]] dielectric layer and/or hydrophobic polymer is used as encapsulation layers in order to prevent device degradation and failure. Phosphorene devices are reported to maintain their function for weeks with encapsulation layer, whereas experience device failure within a week when exposed to ambient condition.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Inverter ===
Researchers have also constructed the CMOS [[Power inverter|inverter]] (logic circuit) by combining a phosphorene [[PMOS logic|PMOS]] transistor with a MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[NMOS logic|NMOS]] transistor, achieving high heterogeneous integration of semiconducting phosphorene crystals as a new channel material for potential electronic applications.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the inverter, the power supply voltage is set to be 1 V. The output voltage shows a clear transition from VDD to 0 within the input voltage range from −10 to −2 V. A maximum gain of ~1.4 is attained.

=== Solar-cell donor material (optoelectronics) ===
The potential applications of mixed bilayer phosphorene in [[Solar cell|solar-cell material]] was examined as well.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Bilayer Phosphorene: Effect of Stacking Order on Bandgap and Its Potential Applications in Thin-Film Solar Cells|journal = The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters|date = 2014|pages = 1289–1293|volume = 5|issue = 7|doi = 10.1021/jz500409m|pmid = 26274486|first = Jun|last = Dai|first2 = Xiao Cheng|last2 = Zeng|arxiv = 1403.6189}}&lt;/ref&gt; The predicted power conversion efficiency for a monolayer MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/AA-stacked bilayer phosphorene and MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/AB-stacked bilayer phosphorene can get as high as ~18% and 16%, respectively.

'''Polyglycolide''' or '''poly(glycolic acid)''' ('''PGA'''), also spelled as '''polyglycolic acid''', is a [[biodegradable]], [[thermoplastic]] [[polymer]] and the simplest linear, [[aliphatic]] [[polyester]]. It can be prepared starting from [[glycolic acid]] by means of [[Condensation reaction|polycondensation]] or [[ring-opening polymerization]]. PGA has been known since 1954 as a tough [[fiber]]-forming polymer.  Owing to its [[hydrolysis|hydrolytic]] instability, however, its use has initially been limited.&lt;ref name="Gilding"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gilding | first = D. K. |author2=A. M.

==Physical properties==
Polyglycolide has a [[glass transition temperature]] between 35 and 40&amp;nbsp;°C and its [[melting point]] is reported to be in the range of 225-230&amp;nbsp;°C. PGA also exhibits an elevated degree of [[crystallinity]], around 45–55%, thus resulting in insolubility in [[water (molecule)|water]].&lt;ref name="middleton"/&gt; The [[solubility]] of this polyester is somewhat unusual, in that its high [[molecular weight]] form is insoluble in almost all common [[organic solvent]]s ([[acetone]], [[dichloromethane]], [[chloroform]], [[ethyl acetate]], [[tetrahydrofuran]]), while low molecular weight [[oligomer]]s sufficiently differ in their physical properties to be more soluble. However, polyglycolide is soluble in highly [[fluorine|fluorinated]] solvents like [[hexafluoro-2-propanol|hexafluoroisopropanol]] (HFIP) and [[hexafluoroacetone|hexafluoroacetone sesquihydrate]], that can be used to prepare solutions of the high MW polymer for [[melt spinning]] and film preparation.&lt;ref name="PGA solutions"&gt;Schmitt, E.: "Polyglycolic acid in solutions", U.S. Pat 3 737 440, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; Fibers of PGA exhibit high strength and [[Young's modulus|modulus]] (7 [[Pascal (unit)|GPa]]) and are particularly stiff.&lt;ref name="middleton"/&gt;

==Synthesis==
Polyglycolide can be obtained through several different processes starting with different materials:

# polycondensation of glycolic acid;
# ring-opening polymerization of glycolide;
# [[solid-state chemistry|solid-state]] polycondensation of [[halogenoacetate]]s

Polycondensation of glycolic acid is the simplest process available to prepare PGA, but it is not the most efficient because it yields a low molecular weight product. Briefly, the procedure is as follows: glycolic acid is heated at atmospheric pressure and a temperature of about 175-185&amp;nbsp;°C is maintained until water ceases to [[distillation|distill]]. Subsequently, pressure is reduced to 150&amp;nbsp;mm Hg, still keeping the temperature unaltered for about two hours and the low MW polyglycolide is obtained.&lt;ref name="PGA dupont"&gt;Lowe, C. E.: "Preparation of high molecular weight polyhydroxyacetic ester", U.S. Pat 2 668 162, 1954&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common synthesis used to produce a high molecular weight form of the polymer is ring-opening polymerization of "glycolide", the cyclic diester of glycolic acid. Glycolide can be prepared by heating under reduced pressure low MW PGA, collecting the diester by means of distillation. Ring-opening polymerization of glycolide can be [[catalysis|catalyzed]] using different [[catalyst]]s, including [[antimony]] compounds, such as [[antimony trioxide]] or antimony trihalides, [[zinc]] compounds (zinc lactate) and [[tin]] compounds like [[stannous octoate]] (tin(II) 2-ethylhexanoate) or tin alkoxides. Stannous octoate is the most commonly used initiator, since it is approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] as a food stabilizer. Usage of other catalysts has been disclosed as well, among these are [[aluminium isopropoxide]], [[calcium]] [[acetylacetonate]], and several [[lanthanide]] alkoxides (e.g. [[yttrium isopropoxide]]).&lt;ref name="PGA dupont"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bero"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bero | first = Maciej |author2=Piotr Dobrzynski |author3=Janusz Kasperczyk  | title = Application of Calcium Acetylacetonate to the Polymerization of Glycolide and Copolymerization of Glycolide with ε-Caprolactone and L-Lactide | journal = Macromolecules | volume = 32 | issue = 14 | pages = 4735–4737 | publisher = ACS | date = 18 June 1999 | doi = 10.1021/ma981969z }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stridsberg"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Stridsberg | first = Kajsa M. |author2=Maria Ryner |author3=Ann-Christine Albertsson | title = Controlled Ring-Opening Polymerization: Polymers with designed Macromolecular Architecture | journal = Advances in Polymer Science | volume = 157 | pages = 41–65 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | year = 2002 | doi = 10.1007/3-540-45734-8_2 | series = Advances in Polymer Science | isbn = 978-3-540-42249-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The procedure followed for ring-opening polymerization is briefly outlined: a catalytic amount of initiator is added to glycolide under a [[nitrogen]] atmosphere at a temperature of 195&amp;nbsp;°C. The reaction is allowed to proceed for about two hours, then temperature is raised to 230&amp;nbsp;°C for about half an hour. After solidification the resulting high MW polymer is collected.&lt;ref name="PGA dupont"/&gt;

[[Image:Pga synthesis.png|frame|center|Ring-opening polymerization of glycolide to polyglycolide]]

Another procedure consists in the thermally induced solid-state polycondensation of halogenoacetates with general formula
X-&amp;mdash;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;COO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (where M is a monovalent metal like [[sodium]] and X is a [[halogen]] like [[chlorine]]), resulting in the production of polyglycolide and small [[crystal]]s of a [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]. Polycondensation is carried out by heating an halogenoacetate, like [[sodium chloroacetate]], at a temperature between 160-180&amp;nbsp;°C, continuously passing nitrogen through the reaction vessel. During the reaction polyglycolide is formed along with [[sodium chloride]] which precipitates within the polymeric matrix; the salt can be conveniently removed by washing the product of the reaction with water.&lt;ref name="apple"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Epple | first = Matthias | title = A detailed characterization of polyglycolide prepared by solid-state polycondensation reaction | journal = Macromolecular Chemistry and Physics | volume = 200 | issue = 10 | pages = 2221–2229 | publisher = Wiley | year = 1999 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1521-3935(19991001)200:10&lt;2221::AID-MACP2221&gt;3.0.CO;2-Q | last2 = Epple | first2 = Matthias }}&lt;/ref&gt;

PGA can also be obtained by reacting carbon monoxide, formaldehyde or one of its related compounds like [[paraformaldehyde]] or [[trioxane]], in presence of an acidic catalyst. In a carbon monoxide atmosphere an [[autoclave]] is loaded with the catalyst ([[chlorosulfonic acid]]), [[dichloromethane]] and trioxane, then it is charged with carbon monoxide until a specific pressure is reached; the reaction is stirred and allowed to proceed at a temperature of about 180&amp;nbsp;°C for two hours. Upon completion the unreacted carbon monoxide is discharged and a mixture of low and high MW polyglycolide is collected.&lt;ref name="Masuda"&gt;Masuda et al.: "Biodegradable plastic composition", U.S. Pat 5 227 415, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

==Degradation==
Polyglycolide is characterized by hydrolytic instability owing to the presence of the [[ester]] linkage in its backbone. The degradation process is erosive and appears to take place in two steps during which the polymer is converted back to its monomer glycolic acid: first water diffuses into the amorphous (non-crystalline) regions of the polymer matrix, cleaving the ester bonds; the second step starts after the amorphous regions have been eroded, leaving the crystalline portion of the polymer susceptible to hydrolytic attack. Upon collapse of the crystalline regions the polymer chain dissolves.

When exposed to physiological conditions, polyglycolide is degraded by random hydrolysis, and apparently it is also broken down by certain [[enzyme]]s, especially those with [[esterase]] activity. The degradation product, glycolic acid, is nontoxic, and it can enter the [[tricarboxylic acid cycle]], after which it is excreted as water and [[carbon dioxide]]. A part of the glycolic acid is also excreted by [[urine]].&lt;ref name="gunatillake"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gunatillake | first = Pathiraja A. |author2=Raju Adhikari | title = Biodegradable Synthetic Polymers for tissue engineering | journal = European Cells and Materials  | volume = 5  | pages = 1–16  | year = 2003 | url = http://www.ecmjournal.org/journal/papers/vol005/pdf/v005a01.pdf | format = [[PDF]] | accessdate = 2015-02-08 | pmid = 14562275 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies undergone using polyglycolide-made sutures have shown that the material loses half of its strength after two weeks and 100% after four weeks. The polymer is completely resorbed by the organism in a time frame of four to six months.&lt;ref name="middleton"/&gt; Degradation is faster [[in vivo]] than [[in vitro]], this phenomenon thought to be due to cellular enzymatic activity.&lt;ref name="Nita"&gt;{{cite journal

==Uses==
[[Image:Polyglycolic acid suture ( PGA-Dexon) 01.JPG|250px|right|thumb|Sutures made from [[Polyglycolic acid]]. These sutures are absorbable and are degraded by the body over time.]]
While known since 1954, PGA had found little use because of its sensitivity to [[hydrolysis]] when compared with other synthetic polymers. However, in 1962 this polymer was used to develop the first synthetic absorbable suture which was marketed under the [[tradename]] of Dexon&lt;ref name="Gilding"/&gt; by the [[Davis &amp; Geck]] subsidiary of the American Cyanamid Corporation. After its coating with Polycaprolactone and Calcium Stearate is being sold under the brand name of Assucryl.

PGA suture is classified as a synthetic, absorbable, braided multifilament. It is coated with N-[[laurin]] and L-[[lysine]], which render the thread extremely smooth, soft and safe for [[knot]]ting. It is also coated with [[magnesium stearate]] and finally sterilized with [[ethylene oxide]] gas. It is naturally degraded in the body by [[hydrolysis]] and is absorbed as water-soluble monomers, completed between 60 and 90 days. Elderly, [[anemia|anemic]] and [[malnutrition|malnourished]] patients may absorb the suture more quickly. Its color is either [[Violet (color)|violet]] or undyed and it is sold in sizes USP 6-0 (1 metric) to USP 2 (5 metric). It has the advantages of high initial tensile strength, smooth passage through tissue, easy handling, excellent knotting ability, and secure knot tying. It is commonly used for [[Subcutaneous tissue|subcutaneous]] sutures, intracutaneous closures, abdominal and thoracic surgeries.

The traditional role of PGA as a biodegradable suture material has led to its evaluation in other biomedical fields. Implantable medical devices have been produced with PGA, including [[anastomosis]] rings, pins, rods, plates and screws.&lt;ref name="middleton"/&gt; It has also been explored for [[tissue engineering]] or controlled drug delivery. Tissue engineering scaffolds made with polyglycolide have been produced following different approaches, but generally most of these are obtained through [[textile]] technologies in the form of [[Nonwovens|non-woven meshes]].

The [[Kureha Chemical Industries]] has commercialized high molecular weight polyglycolide for food packaging applications under the tradename of Kuredux.[http://www.kureha.com/product-groups/pga.htm]  Production is at Belle, West Virginia, with an intended capacity of 4000 annual metric tons.[http://www.chemicals-technology.com/projects/kurehacorporationpol/]  Its attributes as a barrier material result from its high degree of crystallization, the basis for a tortuous path mechanism for low permeability.  It is anticipated that the high molecular weight version will have use as an interlayer between layers of [[polyethylene terephthalate]] to provide improved barrier protection for perishable foods, including carbonated beverages and foods that lose freshness on prolonged exposure to air.  Thinner plastic bottles which still retain desirable barrier properties may also be enabled by this polyglycolide interlayer technology. A low molecular weight version (approximately 600 amu) is available from The Chemours Company[[DuPont Co.|.]] and is purported to be useful in oil and gas applications.[http://www2.dupont.com/Oil_and_Gas/en_CA/assets/downloads/DuPont_Polyglycolic_Acid_Sheet.pdf]

==Operation==
Primacord is initiated with a [[blasting cap]] or by a ''donor line'' of detonating cord or other high explosive. It detonates along its entire length at a velocity of approximately 23,000 feet (7,000 meters) per second. It is used to create explosive effects and to build reliable explosive charges. It is used in conjunction with other high explosive materials to form charges, including linear charges, capable of near instantaneous results.&lt;ref name ="TDS" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1580">'''Sensitivity''' of explosives is the degree to which an [[explosive]] can be initiated by [[impact (mechanics)|impact]], [[heat]], or [[friction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=NAVSEA OP 5, Volume 1 |publisher=U.S. Navy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sensitivity, along with [[chemical stability|stability]] and [[brisance]] are three of the most significant properties of explosives that affect their use and application.  All explosive compounds have a certain amount of energy required to initiate. If an explosive is too sensitive, it may go off accidentally.  A safer explosive is less sensitive and will not explode if accidentally dropped or mishandled. However, such explosives are more difficult to initiate intentionally.

==Explosive train==
Less sensitive explosives can be initiated by smaller quantities of more sensitive explosives, called primers or [[detonator]]s, such as [[blasting cap]]s. The use of increasingly less sensitive [[explosive materials]] to create an escalating [[chain reaction]] is known as an [[explosive train]], [[initiation sequence]], or [[firing train]].

==Classifications==
[[High explosives]] are conventionally subdivided into two explosives classes, differentiated by sensitivity:
* '''[[Primary explosive]]s''' are extremely sensitive to mechanical [[Shock (mechanics)|shock]], friction, and heat, to which they will respond by  burning rapidly or detonating.
* '''[[Secondary explosive]]s''', also called '''base explosives''', are relatively insensitive to shock, friction, and heat.

The '''Silveh Dam''' is an earth-fill [[embankment dam]] being constructed on the Lavin River just downstream of the village of [[Silveh]] in [[Piranshahr County]], [[West Azerbaijan Province]], [[Iran]]. The primary purpose of the dam is [[interbasin transfer]] for irrigation. When complete, a tunnel and canals will shift water from the reservoir north to the [[Chaparabad]] area.

{{Sustainable energy}}

'''Solar power forecasting''' involves knowledge of the [[Sun]]´s path, the [[atmosphere]]'s condition, the scattering processes and the characteristics of a [[solar energy]] plant which utilizes the Sun's energy to create [[solar power]]. Solar [[photovoltaic system]]s transform solar energy into electric power. The power output depends on the incoming radiation and on the solar panel characteristics. Photovoltaic power production is increasing nowadays. Forecast information is essential for an efficient use, the management of the electricity grid and for solar energy trading. Common solar forecasting method include stochastic learning method, local and remote sensing method, and hybrid method (Chu et al. 2016).

==Generation forecasting==

The energy generation forecasting problem is closely linked to the problem of ''weather variables forecasting''. Indeed, this problem is usually split into two parts, on one hand focusing on the forecasting of solar PV or any other meteorological variable and on the other hand estimating the amount of energy that a concrete power plant will produce with the estimated meteorological resource.
In general, the way to deal with this difficult problem is usually related to the spatial and temporal scales we are interested in, which yields to different approaches that can be found in the literature. In this sense, it is useful to classify these techniques depending on the forecasting horizon, so it is possible to distinguish between ''now-casting'' (forecasting 3–4 hours ahead), ''short-term forecasting'' (up to 7 days ahead) and ''long-term forecasting'' (months, years…)
Solar radiation closely follows the physical and biological development of the earth. Its spatial and sequential heterogeneity powerfully influence the forcing of environmental and hydrological organisms by manipulating air temperature, soil moisture and vapor transpiration, snow cover and lots of photochemical procedures. Therefore, solar radiation drives place efficiency and plant life allotment, organism a key feature in undeveloped and forestry sciences that be obliged to be known precisely. The quantity of solar radiation obtainable at the earth’ surface is at the outset controlled at worldwide balance, organism above all precious by the Sun Earth geometry and the atmosphere. On the other hand, a complete explanation of its freedom time unpredictability require deliberation of limited procedure which frequently turn out to be also applicable, as is the casing in mountainous region. Predominantly, limited territory adjust the inward bound solar radiation by shadow casts, slope of elevation, surface gradient and compass reading, as a result, precise spatial model of inward bound solar radiation be supposed to regard as the pressure of the terrain surface. In the final time, more than a few events to consist of the confined terrain special effects in the solar radiation countryside have been projected, such as the use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS), artificial intelligence or post dispensation of satellite stand technique. Solar radiation can be also evaluated using numerical weather forecast (NWP) models. Nevertheless, the space and time balance determined with them and the incomplete computational ability frequently avoid the deliberation of terrain connected property.

Otherwise, exclamation technique agree to us to acquire spatially persistent database from data evidence at inaccessible station greater than wide region. Even though their dependability is powerfully needy on the opening coldness between position, they eventually rely on experiential statistics, which have a superior precision than extra method. Therefore, while an adequate footage spatial thickness is accessible, disturbance method are preferred. Conventionally, solar radiation has not been as densely example as additional variables as temperature or rainfall, therefore the ease of use of capacity is frequently in short supply. Though, the number of experimental system which record solar radiation has developed and interruption has been converted into an appropriate technique for solar radiation evaluation. Nevertheless, radiometric stations are frequently come together approximately farmland or occupied region, typically during basin and plane area, while mountains at rest require enough footage thickness. This truth is particularly applicable afford the tall spatial unpredictability of solar radiation in these province. As an outcome, particular interruption method that tolerate include outdoor foundation should be used to make clear this extra spatial unpredictability. Several diverse spatial interruption techniques can be established. On the other hand, data ease of use in mountainous region is often extremely restricted. As a result, it is hard to construct a precise solar radiation climatology in hilly area to be used in environmental science, climate change.

Solar radiation is a hardly illustration changeable with reverence to supplementary ecological variables such as temperature or precipitation, in fraction payable to the high maintenance price of the necessary radiometric sensors. It is extremely sensitive to ecological feature on or after local to limited balance. Predominantly, terrain surface confronts the conventional interruption method while forecast through far above the ground spatial decision are required, particularly due to the lack of measurement stations in mountainous areas. Geo-statistics front a stochastic move toward to resolve the spatial forecast difficulty that stop dependence on before imagine deterministic models and permit us to consist of the consequence of outside in sequence foundation stand on investigation data-sets.

==Nowcasting==

Nowcasting comprises the detailed description of the current weather along with forecasts for up to 3–4 hours. This very short-term forecasting service is very important for grid operators in order to guarantee the grid stability and for those power plants that can be considered manageable, at least in a certain degree, such as solar thermal power plants.
Nowcasting services are usually related to very high temporal resolution (a forecast every 10 or 15 minutes), so automatic weather data acquisition and processing is a major requirement in order to develop these techniques. Several approaches can be found in the literature, which mainly depend on the type of data that is treated to estimate future values of meteorological variables:

# Statistical techniques are usually based on time series processing of meteorological measured data, which is used as training data to tune the parameters of a model (I. Espino eta al, 2011). These techniques include the use of any kind of statistical approach, such as autoregressive moving average (ARMA, ARIMA,…), neural networks, [[support vector machine]]s, etc. These approaches are usually benchmarked to a persistence approach in order to evaluate their improvements. This persistence approach just assumes that any variable at time step t is the value it took in a previous time.
# Since the launch of Earth observing satellites, such as ''MSG'', nowcasting techniques have also been developed from an image processing point of view. The main advantage of these techniques is the possibility to monitorize a lot of meteorological information in almost real time. This high value information is used as input to physical models based on image processing techniques that provide an estimation of future atmospheric values, as described in ''Alvarez et al.'', 2010.

==Solar PV short-term forecasting==

''Short-term'' forecasting provides predictions up to 7 days ahead. This kind of forecast is also valuable for grid operators in order to make decisions of grid operation, as well as, for electric market operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanjari|first1=M.J.|last2=Gooi|first2=H.B.|title=Probabilistic Forecast of PV Power Generation based on Higher-order Markov Chain|journal=IEEE Transactions on Power Systems|date=2016|doi=10.1109/TPWRS.2016.2616902}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Under this perspective, the meteorological resources are estimated at a different temporal and spatial resolution. This implies that meteorological variables and phenomena are looked from a more general perspective, not as local as nowcasting services do. In this sense, most of the approaches make use of different numerical weather prediction models (NWP) that provide an initial estimation of weather variables. Currently, several models are available for this purpose, such as [[Global Forecast System]] (GFS) or data provided by the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting ([[ECMWF]]). These two models are considered the state of the art of global forecast models, which provide meteorological forecasts all over the world.
In order to increase spatial and temporal resolution of these models, other models have been developed which are generally called mesoscale models. Among others, [[HIRLAM]], [[Weather Research and Forecasting Model|WRF]] or [[MM5 (weather model)|MM5]] are the most representative of these models since they are widely used by different communities.
To run these models a wide expertise is needed in order to obtain accurate results, due to the wide variety of parameters that can be configured in the models. In addition, sophisticated techniques such as data assimilation might be used in order to produce more realistic simulations.
Finally, some communities argue for the use of post-processing techniques, once the models’ output is obtained, in order to obtain a probabilistic point of view of the accuracy of the output. This is usually done with ensemble techniques that mix different outputs of different models perturbed in strategic meteorological values and finally provide a better estimate of those variables and a degree of uncertainty, like in the model proposed by Bacher et al. (2009)

==Solar PV long-term forecasting==

''Long-term'' forecasting usually refers to forecasting of the annual or monthly available resource. This is useful for energy producers and to negotiate contracts with financial entities or utilities that distribute the generated energy.
In general, these long-term forecasting is usually done at a lower scale than any of the two previous approaches. Hence, most of these models are run with mesoscale models fed with reanalysis data as input and whose output is postprocessed with statistical approaches based on measured data.

==Energetic models==

Any output from any model described above must then be converted to the electric energy that a particular solar PV plant will produce. This step is usually done with statistical approaches that try to correlate the amount of available resource with the metered power output. The main advantage of these methods is that the meteorological prediction error, which is the main component of the global error, might be reduced taking into account the uncertainty of the prediction. As it was mentioned before and detailed in ''Heinemann et al.'', these statistical approaches comprises from ARMA models, neural networks, support vector machines, etc.
On the other hand, there also exist theoretical models that describe how a power plant converts the meteorological resource into electric energy, as described in Alonso et al. The main advantage of this type of models is that when they are fitted, they are really accurate, although they are too sensitive to the meteorological prediction error, which is usually amplified by these models.
Hybrid models, finally, are a combination of these two models and they seem to be a promising approach that can outperform each of them individually.

The '''starting vortex''' is a [[vortex]] which forms in the air adjacent to the trailing edge of an [[airfoil]] as it is accelerated from rest in a fluid.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Figure 4.7&lt;/ref&gt;  It leaves the airfoil (which now has an equal but opposite "bound vortex" around it), and remains (nearly) stationary in the flow.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Figure 4.8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Millikan, Clark B., ''Aerodynamics of the Airplane'', Figure 1.56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massey, B.S. ''Mechanics of Fluids'', Fig 9.32, 2nd Edition&lt;/ref&gt;  It rapidly decays through the action of [[viscosity]].

The initial (and quite brief) presence of a starting [[vortex]] as an [[airfoil]] begins to move was predicted by early aerodynamicists, and eventually photographed.&lt;ref&gt;Millikan, Clark B., ''Aerodynamics of the Airplane'', Figure 1.55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prandtl, L., and Tietjens, O.G., ''Applied Hydro- and Aero-mechanics'', Figures 42-55, McGraw-Hill, New York (1934)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massey, B.S., ''Mechanics of Fluids'', Fig 9.33, 2nd Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Whenever the speed or [[angle of attack]] of an airfoil changes there is a corresponding amount of vorticity deposited in the wake behind the airfoil, joining the two [[Wingtip vortices|trailing vortices]].  This vorticity is a continuum of mini-starting-vortexes.  The wake behind an aircraft is a continuous sheet of weak vorticity, between the two trailing vortices, and this accounts for the changes in strength of the trailing vortices as the airspeed of the aircraft and angle of attack on the wing change during flight.&lt;ref&gt;"This starting vortex formation occurs not only when a wing is first set into motion, but also when the circulation around the wing is subsequently changed for any reason whatever."  Millikan, Clark B., ''Aerodynamics of the Airplane'', page 65&lt;/ref&gt; (The strength of a [[vortex]] cannot change within the fluid except by the dissipative action of [[viscosity]].  Vortices either form continuous loops of constant strength, or they terminate at the boundary of the fluid - usually a solid surface such as the ground.)

The '''starting vortex''' is significant to an understanding of the [[Kutta condition]] and its role in the [[Circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]] around any airfoil generating [[lift (force)|lift]].

The starting vortex has certain similarities with the "starting plume" which forms at the leading edge of a slug of fluid, when one fluid is injected into another at rest.  See [[plume (hydrodynamics)]].

The '''State Oil Fund of the Republic of Azerbaijan''' ('''SOFAZ''') is Azerbaijan’s sovereign wealth fund, whereby energy-related earnings are accumulated and efficiently managed for future generations.

== History ==
SOFAZ  was established in accordance with the Decree of National Leader Heydar Aliyev No. 240 on December 29, 1999. Statute of SOFAZ was approved by the Decree of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan № 434 dated December 29, 2000. SOFAZ began operating after the approval of the Decree on "Rules on management of foreign currency assets of the State Oil Fund of the Republic of Azerbaijan" by the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan dated June 19, 2001. The establishment of SOFAZ plays a key role in the oil strategy founded by Azerbaijan’s National Leader [[Heydar Aliyev]].

== Mission ==
SOFAZ's mission is to transform depletable hydrocarbon reserves into financial assets generating perpetual income for current and future generations.

== Goals and objectives ==

The cornerstone of Sofaz’s  is to ensure intergenerational equality with regard to the country's oil wealth. SOFAZ was founded in order to manage the oil and gas incomes efficiently as well as to invest them in the development of socio-economically important projects and advance spheres.

SOFAZ’s activity is directed to the achievement of the following objectives:

1.Supporting macroeconomic stability, participating in ensuring fiscal-tax discipline and decreasing dependence on oil revenues while stimulating development of the non-oil sector;

2.Funding major national scale projects to support socio-economic progress;

3.Ensuring intergenerational equality with regard to the country’s oil wealth, accumulating and preserving oil revenues for future generations.

== Management ==
[[The Supervisory Board]], consisting of representatives of the state authorities and public organizations, carries out general oversight of SOFAZ’s operations. The Board reviews and evaluates SOFAZ’s draft annual budget, annual report and financial statements, along with audit report. Members of the Supervisory Board are approved by the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan. The board members act entirely on a voluntary basis.

SOFAZ’s day-to-day activities are managed by the Executive Director appointed by the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan. 
The Executive Director represents the Fund, appoints and dismisses employees of SOFAZ in a manner determined by the legislation, carries out operational management of SOFAZ’s activities, ensures the management and investment of SOFAZ’s assets in accordance with the Guidelines approved by the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan. 
Execution of SOFAZ’s budget is implemented on the basis of comments provided by the Supervisory Board in accordance with the SOFAZ budget approved by the proper Ordinances of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan. SOFAZ assets are managed in accordance with the "Rules on management of foreign currency assets of the State Oil Fund of the Republic of Azerbaijan" and Investment Policy.

== SOFAZ’s revenues ==
The sources of income for SOFAZ are:

#Proceeds generated under production sharing agreements from sales of the Republic of Azerbaijan's share of hydrocarbons; 
#[[Performance-related pay|Bonuses]] paid under the terms of production sharing agreements; 
#Acreage fees paid by foreign investors for use of the contract areas in connection with the development of hydrocarbon resources; 
#[[Dividends]] paid under the terms of production sharing agreements; 
#Revenues generated from the transit of oil and gas over the territory of the Republic of Azerbaijan; 
#Revenues generated from the transfer of assets from investors; 
#Revenues from management of SOFAZ assets; 
#[[Grants]];
#Other incomes according to the legislation.

== SOFAZ’s expenditures  ==
In compliance with regulations relating to SOFAZ, the Fund's assets may be used for solving major problems affecting the nation, and for construction and reconstruction of strategically important infrastructure to support socio-economic progress.

Transfers to the state budget also constitute a significant component of the Fund's outflow. A very small portion of the Fund's assets is utilized to cover operational costs.

As per the Law "About Budget System" of the Republic of Azerbaijan, all SOFAZ expenditures, except operating expenditures, are incorporated as part of an annual consolidated government budget presented to the Parliament for approval. In compliance with this Law, SOFAZ can only execute expenditures envisaged by its budget.

== Projects financed by SOFAZ  ==
SOFAZ is funding projects of national scale. They are:

1.Azerbaijan's equity share in the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline project (completed);

2.Building of housing and improvement of socio-economic conditions of refugees and internally displaced persons who were forced to flee their native lands as a result of Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict;

3.Oguz-Qabala-Baku water supply system (completed);

4.Reconstruction of the Samur-Absheron irrigation system;

5.Formation of the statutory capital of the State Investment Company (completed);

6.Financing Baku-Tibilisi-Kars railway;

7.Financing “The state program on the education of Azerbaijan youth abroad in the years 2007-2015”;

8.Financing of the share of Azerbaijan Republic in the construction of the STAR oil refinery project in Turkey;

9.Financing the share of the Republic of Azerbaijan in “South Gas Corridor” CJSC statutory capital;

10.Financing the share of Azerbaijan Republic in the “Construction of New Semi-submersible Drilling rig Project” (completed).

11.Financing of the share of the Republic of Azerbaijan in the “Construction of Oil, Gas Processing and Petrochemical Complex Project”

== Asset management ==
SOFAZ's assets are managed in accordance with the "Rules on management of foreign currency assets of the State Oil Fund of the Republic of Azerbaijan" approved by Presidential Decree No. 511 dated June 19.2001 and “Investment Policy of the State Oil Fund of the Republic of Azerbaijan” approved by Presidential decrees on an annual basis.
According to Investment Policy currency composition of the investment portfolio is as follows, subject to the requirement of at least 90% allocation to currencies of countries with credit ratings of no less than “A” (by Standard and Poor’s, Fitch) and “A2” (by Moody’s):

1.   50% invested in assets denominated in USD;

2.   35% invested in assets denominated in EUR;

3.   5% invested in assets denominated in GBP.

4. 10% of the investment portfolio can be invested in assets denominated in other currencies.


Investment portfolio of SOFAZ consists of the following sub-portfolios:

1.  Debt obligations and money market instruments Portfolio – 60% of the investment portfolio along with maximum lower deviation of 5% (up to 5% can be invested in non-rated fixed income debt funds);

2.  Equity Portfolio – up to 25% of the investment portfolio (up to 5% can be invested in private equity funds);

3.  Real estate Portfolio – up to 10% of the investment portfolio along with maximum upper deviation of 2%;

4.  Gold Portfolio – up to 5% of the investment portfolio along with maximum upper deviation of 3%.

==Assets==
The assets of SOFAZ as of October 1, 2018 have increased by 8.88% compared to the beginning of 2018 (USD 35 806.5 mln.) and stood at USD 38 987.7 mln. 

SOFAZ’s budget revenues for the period of January-September, 2018 reached 14 437.2 million manats, while budget expenditures constituted 8 005.9 million manats.

== SOFAZ and transparency ==
SOFAZ always pays attention to transparency in its activities. A key measure to promote transparency within SOFAZ’s reporting system and operation is a regular audit of the Fund's financial activities by a reputable firm of international auditors.

Information and press releases, and both quarterly and annual statements, in Azerbaijani and English, about the Fund's revenues and expenditures are regularly published in the local press, posted on SOFAZ's official web-site (www.oilfund.az) and on social media pages (Facebook, Twitter) to reflect developments in varying areas of SOFAZ’s activities, and also to promote transparency in the utilization of revenues from oil.

SOFAZ won the 2007 UN Public Service Award for Improving Transparency, Accountability and Responsiveness in Public Service. The United Nations Public Service Awards is the most prestigious international recognition of excellence in public service. Established in 2003, it rewards creative achievements and contributions of public service institutions to more effective and responsive public administration in countries worldwide. SOFAZ is the first governmental agency that is awarded the UN Public Service Award among the governmental institutions of the Eastern Europe and CIS countries.

Taking into account that Azerbaijan is the first country to complete validation- the EITI's quality assurance process, which verifies compliance with EITI principles and criteria,“EITI Award 2009” was awarded to Azerbaijan, at the 4th EITI International Conference held on February 2009 in Doha, Qatar.

== SOFAZ - Sovereign Wealth Fund ==
A [[Sovereign Wealth Fund]] (SWF) is a state-owned investment fund composed of financial assets such as stocks, bonds, property, precious metals or other financial instruments that is formed from revenues from natural resources. The term sovereign wealth fund was first used in 2005. The International Working Group of Sovereign Wealth Funds (IWG) announced its  establishment in April 2009 in the city-capital of Kuwait.
 
SOFAZ cooperates with other SWF's within the framework of [[International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds]] (IFSWF). IFSWF is a voluntary group of SWFs, which meets, exchanges views on issues of common interest, and facilitates an understanding of the [[Santiago Principles]] [http://www.iwg-swf.org/pubs/gapplist.htm/] and SWF activities. The inaugural meeting of IFSWF was held in Baku on October 8–9, 2009 and it was hosted by SOFAZ and the Government of the Republic of Azerbaijan. According to the Principle 24 of SP [http://www.oilfund.az/uploads/SOFAZ_self-assessment(eng).pdf], SOFAZ has prepared its first self-assessment report on the implementation of SP and intends to review it on an annual basis.

== Logo ==
The general appearance of SOFAZ’s logo portrays a man holding something dear and valuable in his hands, symbolizing SOFAZ’s main activity to preserve Azerbaijan's wealth for future generations.

Hands of the figure are described as two butas giving the logo an inimitable national flavour.

Area between the hands is described as the eye of the Omniscience directed to the future of the country and the nation in which SOFAZ plays a crucial role.
The sphere between the hands can also be described as the heart of SOFAZ, symbolizing the Fund's transparency.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5832">'''Sugarcane wax''' is a [[wax]] extracted from [[sugarcane]].

== Production ==
The production of sugarcane wax is difficult and economically intensive. Sugarcane is used almost exclusively to produce sugar. More importantly, there is just about 0.1 % of sugarcane wax in sugarcane. Therefore, economic productions can only be found in the major cultivation countries Brazil, India, China, Thailand, Pakistan and Mexico. During the production of sugar remains a filter residue, the so-called bagasse. The sugar cane wax is obtained from this filter residue. In that process, plant residues and chlorophyll are separated from the sugarcane.
== History ==
Around 1840, for the first time the American pharmacist Avequin was able to produce sugarcane wax out of the bagasse in a relatively pure form. In his quantitative analysis he found that there is just 0.1 % of the whitish to dark yellow wax in sugarcane.&lt;ref&gt;Avequin M., „The Waxy Matter of Sugarcane“ Ann. Chim. phys. (2), 75, 218-222 (1840); Ann., 37, 170-173 (1841)&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1909, more than 60 years later, the Frenchman A. Wynberg was granted a patent for the production of sugarcane wax by extracting it out of the bagasse.&lt;ref&gt;French patent 397,843 (1909)&lt;/ref&gt;  During World War I, one of the first companies that produced large amounts of sugarcane waxes established in the South African province Natal. Already in 1924, 6000 tons of dark sugarcane wax were produced there. This amount was mainly used for the production of candles for the Russian Orthodox Church. Because of the Russian Revolution and the associated war against the church the consumption of sugarcane wax decreased so much that the company had to be closed. In the following period, sugarcane wax was produced in the USA, mainly in Louisiana where there were up to 22 sugarcane wax producers. Already in 1922, M. Rindl described applications for sugarcane wax in detail, for example as substitute for Carnauba, Bee and Montan waxes.&lt;ref&gt;Rindl, M., S. African J. Ind., 5, 513 – 518 (1922)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ingredients ==
Sugarcane wax consists of the following ingredients: about 70 % of alcohols of long-chain hydrocarbons having chain lengths of C 18 to C 32, wax acids having chain lengths of C 18 to C 32, ω-hydroxycarboxylic acids and aromatic carboxylic acids. Also fatty alcohols (wax alcohols) and diols are alcohol components. Besides that, about 5 to 10 % consist of unesterified diols, long-chain wax acids such as behenic, cerotic, lignoceric or melissic acid and saturated hydrocarbons. Untreated sugarcane wax contains up to 25 % of resin and moreover, up to 60 % polycosanol (octacosanol) which can be extracted from sugarcane wax in the pure form.
 
== Characteristics ==
Sugarcane wax is indigestible and harmless to health. In case of accidental consumption it is excreted. In its refined form it has a light yellowish colour. Due to the high melting point of 75 to 80 ° C it remains stable even if exposed to direct sunlight. Sugarcane wax offers a good oil and solvent retention for anionic bright emulsions.
== Applications ==
=== Food ===
Until the 1960s, sugar cane wax was added to the production of chewing gum as an edible wax. In this process the sugar cane wax acted as elastomer or as plasticizer and consistency regulator.&lt;ref&gt;Rindl, M., S. African J. Ind., 5, 513 – 518 (1922)&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1943, J. W. Schlegel and L. Lang were granted a patent to flour donuts with sugar.&lt;ref&gt;Schlegel, J. W., Lang, L., U. S. Patent 2,320,831 (1943)&lt;/ref&gt;  The ground sugar was mixed with 0.4 % of sugar cane wax. Thus, the donuts became fat- and water-repellent and kept their fresh appearance longer. Also chocolate was thinly coated with sugarcane wax. The gloss durability improved, the melting reduced and the packing was relieved as well. In order to keep vegetables and fruits fresh or to make it look fresh emulsions from sugarcane wax mixed with other natural waxes were prepared. The vegetables or fruits were immersed in the emulsions or sprayed with wax emulsions.&lt;ref&gt;“The Chemistry and Technology of Waxes”, Albin H. Warth.1956, pages 735 - 737&lt;/ref&gt; 
=== Medical applications ===
In the 1970s, a further field of application for polycosanols made from sugarcane wax was found in the medical industry, the lowering of the cholesterol level. This had been pursued with various investigations by the Cuban laboratory Dalmer S.A. in Havana, especially against the background of [[revolutions of 1989|the fall of the Iron Curtain]]. During this time, there were many - also controversial - patent applications. The last known patent was applied in 1998 by S.A. Dalmer.&lt;ref&gt;EP 0 969 827 B1; DE 698 11 643 T2&lt;/ref&gt;  Those results were analysed, summarised and developed further by I. Gouni-Berthold and H. K. Berthold.&lt;ref&gt;Gouni-Berthold, I. and Berthold, H.K.: Policosanol: Clinical pharmacology and therapeutic significance of a new lipid-lowering agent. In: American Heart Journal, 2002, S. 356-365. – ISSN 0002-8703 (advisory)&lt;/ref&gt;  From 2004 to 2007 the cholesterol-lowering effect of polycosanols made from sugarcane wax was transferred to montan waxes because of their very similar chemical structure by E. Krendlinger and M. Neumaier.&lt;ref&gt;DE 10 2006 012 872.9&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently, nutritional supplements containing polycosanols for lowering the cholesterol levels are offered in a wide range.

=== Currently ===
Sugarcane wax is not only suitable for technical applications but also for applications in the food industry. So, sugarcane wax can be used as care product (shoe, floor and car care), in the leather and [[plastics industry]] as well as for applications in the additive and cosmetics industry. Furthermore, it is applicable in the paints and printing inks industry and for the production of candles.

'''Surface freezing''' is the appearance of long-range [[crystalline]] order in a near-surface layer of a [[liquid]]. The surface freezing effect is opposite to a far more common [[surface melting]], or [[premelting]]. Surface Freezing was experimentally discovered in melts of [[alkanes]] and related chain molecules in the early 1990s independently by two groups. John Earnshaw and his group (Queen's University of Belfast) used light scattering, which did not allow a determination of the frozen layer's thickness, and whether or not it is laterally ordered. A group led by Ben Ocko (Brookhaven National Laboratory), Eric Sirota (Exxon) and Moshe Deutsch (Bar-Ilan University, Israel) discovered independently the same effect, using x-ray surface diffraction which allowed them to show that the frozen layer is a crystalline monolayer, with molecules oriented roughly along the surface normal, and ordered in an hexagonal lattice. A related effect, the existence of a smectic phase at the surface of a nematic liquid bulk was observed in liquid crystals by Jens Als-Nielsen (Risø National Laboratory, Denmark) and Peter Pershan (Harvard University) in the early 1980s. However, the surface layer there was neither ordered, nor confined to a single layer. Surface freezing has since been found in a wide range of chain molecules and at various interfaces: liquid-air, liquid-solid and liquid-liquid.

Tetraxenonogold(II) is unusual in that it is a compound of the notoriously inert atoms [[xenon]] and [[gold]]. It is also unusual in that it uses xenon as a [[transition metal]] [[ligand]], and in that it contains gold in the +2 oxidation state. It can be produced by [[redox|reduction]] of [[gold(III) fluoride|AuF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] in the presence of [[fluoroantimonic acid]] and xenon, and crystallised at low temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Stefan Seidel|last=Konrad Seppelt|date=2000-10-06|title=Xenon as a Complex Ligand: The Tetra Xenono Gold(II) Cation in AuXe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;(Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|journal=Science|volume=290|issue=5489|pages=117–118|doi=10.1126/science.290.5489.117|pmid=11021792|last2=Seppelt|first2=K|bibcode = 2000Sci...290..117S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The xenon bonds with the gold(II) ion to make this complex.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9270">[[Image:Dimmit Sequence.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A sequence of images showing the birth of a supercellular tornado. First, the rotating cloud base lowers. This lowering becomes a funnel, which continues descending while winds build near the surface, kicking up dust and other debris. Finally, the visible funnel extends to the ground, and the tornado begins causing major damage.]]
[[File:Evolution of a Tornado.jpg|thumb|Composite of eight images shot in sequence as a tornado formed in [[Kansas]] in 2016]]

'''Tornadogenesis''' is the process by which a [[tornado]] forms. There are many types of tornadoes, and each type of tornado can have several different methods of formation. Despite ongoing scientific study and high-profile research projects such as [[VORTEX projects|VORTEX]], many of the mechanisms of tornado formation are still poorly understood.

== Supercellular tornadoes ==
Classical tornadoes are [[supercell]]ular tornadoes, which have a recognizable pattern of formation.&lt;ref name="Advanced Spotter Guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.gov/os/brochures/adv_spotters.pdf |title=Advanced Spotters' Field Guide |accessdate=2006-09-20 |author=Doswell, Moller, Anderson |year=2005 |format=PDF |publisher=[http://www.commerce.gov/ US Department of Commerce] |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823090940/http://www.weather.gov/os/brochures/adv_spotters.pdf |archivedate=2006-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cycle begins when a strong [[thunderstorm]] develops a rotating [[mesocyclone]] a few miles up in the atmosphere. As rainfall in the storm increases, it drags with it an area of quickly descending air known as the [[rear flank downdraft]] (RFD).  This downdraft accelerates as it approaches the ground, and drags the rotating mesocyclone towards the ground with it. Storm relative helicity (SRH) has been shown to play a role in tornado development and strength.  SRH is horizontal vorticity that is parallel to the [[Inflow (meteorology)|Inflow]] of the storm and is tilted upwards when it is taken up by the updraft, thus creating vertical vorticity.

As the mesocyclone lowers below the cloud base, it begins to take in cool, moist air from the downdraft region of the storm. This convergence of warm air in the updraft, and this cool air, causes a rotating wall cloud to form. The RFD also focuses the mesocyclone's base, causing it to siphon air from a smaller and smaller area on the ground. As the updraft intensifies, it creates an area of low pressure at the surface. This pulls the focused mesocyclone down, in the form of a visible condensation funnel. As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, creating a gust front that can cause severe damage a good distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud begins causing damage on the ground (becoming a tornado) within a few minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Field studies have shown that in order for a supercell to produce a tornado the RFD needs to be no more than a few Kelvin cooler than the updraft. Also the FFD ([[Forward flank downdraft#Forward Flank Downdraft .28FFD.29|Forward Flank Downdraft]]) seems to be warmer within tornadic supercells than it is the case in non-tornadic supercells.

== Waterspouts ==
[[Waterspout]]s are defined as tornadoes over water. However, while some waterspouts are supercellular (also known as "tornadic waterspouts"), forming in a process similar to that of their land-based counterparts, most are much weaker and caused by different processes of atmospheric dynamics. They normally develop in [[moisture]]-laden environments with little vertical [[wind shear]] in areas where wind comes together (convergence), such as [[land breeze]]s, [[lake-effect snow|lake effect]] bands, lines of frictional convergence from nearby landmasses, or surface troughs. Waterspouts normally develop as their parent clouds are in the process of development. It is theorized that they spin upward as they move up the surface boundary from the horizontal shear near the surface, and then stretch upward to the cloud once the low level shear vortex aligns with a developing cumulus or thunderstorm.&lt;ref&gt;Barry K. Choy and Scott M. Spratt. [http://www.srh.noaa.gov/mlb/spoutpre.html Using the WSR-88D to Predict East Central Florida Waterspouts.] Retrieved on 2006-10-25.&lt;/ref&gt;  Their parent cloud can be as innocuous as a moderate cumulus, or as significant as a [[supercell]].

=== Landspouts ===
[[Landspout]]s are tornadoes that do not form from supercells and are similar in appearance and structure to fair-weather waterspouts with the exception that they form over land instead of water. They are thought to form in a manner similar to that of weaker waterspouts&lt;ref name="NWS-Landspout"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.weather.gov/grr/summary20170630|last=National Weather Service|date=June 30, 2017|work=EF-0 Landspout Tornado near Grand Junction, MI on June 30, 2017|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that they form during the growth stage of convective clouds by the ingestion and tightening of [[atmospheric boundary layer|boundary layer]] [[vorticity]] by the [[cumulus cloud|cumuliform]] tower's updraft.

== Continuing research ==
Though these are widely accepted hypotheses for how most tornadoes form, they do not explain the formation of long-lived tornadoes, or tornadoes with multiple vortices. These each have different mechanisms which influence their development—however, most tornadoes follow a pattern similar to these ones.&lt;ref name="downdraft transport"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Markowski |first=Paul M. |authorlink=Paul M.

Because [[energy]] is defined via [[Mechanical work|work]], the [[SI]] unit for '''energy''' is the same as the unit of work &amp;ndash; the [[joule]] (J), named in honor of [[James Prescott Joule]] and his experiments on the [[mechanical equivalent of heat]]. In slightly more fundamental terms, 1&amp;nbsp;joule is equal to 1&amp;nbsp;[[newton metre]] and, in terms of [[SI base unit]]s

:&lt;math&gt;1\ \mathrm{J} = 1\ \mathrm{kg} \left( \frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}} \right ) ^ 2 = 1\ \frac{\mathrm{kg} \cdot \mathrm{m}^2}{\mathrm{s}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

An energy unit that is used in [[atomic physics]], [[particle physics]] and [[high energy physics]] is the [[electronvolt]] (eV). One&amp;nbsp;eV is equivalent to [[1 E-19 J|1.60217653&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;19&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;J]].

In [[spectroscopy]] the unit cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.000123986 eV is used to represent energy since energy is inversely proportional to wavelength from the equation &lt;math&gt; E = h \nu = h c/\lambda &lt;/math&gt;.

In discussions of energy production and consumption, the units [[barrel of oil equivalent]] and [[ton of oil equivalent]] are often used.

When discussing amounts of energy released in [[explosion]]s or [[bolide]] [[impact event]]s, the [[TNT equivalent]] unit is often used.

==British Imperial / US Customary units==
The [[imperial units|British Imperial units]] and [[United States customary units|U.S. Customary units]] for both energy and work include the [[foot-pound force]] (1.3558&amp;nbsp;J), the [[British thermal unit]] (BTU) which has various values in the region of 1055&amp;nbsp;J, the [[horsepower]]-hour (2.6845&amp;nbsp;MJ), and the [[gasoline gallon equivalent]] (about 120&amp;nbsp;MJ).

==Electricity==
The energy unit used for everyday [[electricity]], particularly for utility bills, is the [[kilowatt-hour]] (kWh); one kWh is equivalent to 3.6&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;J&amp;nbsp; (3600&amp;nbsp;kJ or 3.6&amp;nbsp;MJ).  Electricity usage is often given in units of kilowatt-hours per year (kWh/yr).  This is actually a measurement of average [[Electric power|power]] consumption, i.e., the average rate at which energy is transferred. One kWh/yr is about 0.11 watts.

==Natural gas==
Natural gas in the US is sold in [[Therm]]s or 100 cubic feet (100 ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 Ccf).  One Therm is equal to about 105.5 [[Joule|megajoules]].  In Australia, natural gas is sold in [[Joule|megajoules]]. In the most of the world, natural gas is sold in [[Joule|gigajoules]].

==Food industry==
The [[calorie]] equals the amount of [[thermal energy]] necessary to raise the [[temperature]] of one [[gram]] of [[water]] by 1 [[Celsius]] degree, from a temperature of 14.5 degrees Celsius, at a [[pressure]] of 1 [[atmospheric pressure|atm]]. For thermochemistry a calorie of 4.184 J is used, but other calories have also been defined, such as the International Steam Table calorie of 4.1868 J. [[Food energy]] is measured in large calories or kilocalories, often simply written capitalized as "Calories" (= 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; calories).

==Atom physics and chemistry==
In physics and chemistry, it is still common to measure energy on the atomic scale in the non-SI, but convenient, units [[electronvolt]]s (eV).  The [[Hartree]] (the [[atomic unit]] of energy) is commonly used in calculations. Historically [[Rydberg constant#Value of the Rydberg constant and Rydberg unit of energy|Rydberg]] units have been used.

==Spectroscopy==
In [[spectroscopy]] and related fields it is common to measure energy levels in units of [[Wavenumber|reciprocal centimetres]].  These units (cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) are strictly speaking not energy units but units proportional to energies, with &lt;math&gt;\ hc\sim 2\cdot 10^{-23}\ \mathrm{J}\ \mathrm{cm}&lt;/math&gt; being the proportionality constant.&lt;ref name=nist_recip_cm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cccbdb.nist.gov/wavenumber.asp |title=CCCBDB What's a cm-1? |publisher=Cccbdb.nist.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explosions==
A gram of [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]] releases 980–1100 [[calorie]]s upon explosion. To define the '''tonne of TNT''', this was arbitrarily standardized by letting 1000 thermochemical calories = 1&amp;nbsp;gram TNT = 4184&amp;nbsp;[[Joule|J]] (exactly).&lt;ref&gt;[http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/appenB8.html NIST Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI): Appendix B8—Factors for Units Listed Alphabetically]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Waymo''' is a [[autonomous car|self-driving]] technology development company. It is a subsidiary of [[Alphabet Inc.]] Waymo originated as a project of Google before it became a stand alone [[subsidiary]] in December 2016. 

Waymo is currently running a trial of an autonomous [[Real-time ridesharing|ride-hailing]] business in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. The company has announced that the service will be available for public use by the end of 2018.

==History==
{{See also|History of autonomous cars}}
Google's development of self-driving technology began in 2009 at the company's secretive X lab run by co-founder [[Sergey Brin]].&lt;ref name="AP-16"&gt;{{cite news |title=Google's self-driving-car project becomes a separate company: Waymo |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-google-waymo-self-driving-20161213-story.html |agency=[[The Associated Press]] |date=13 December 2016 |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was originally led by [[Sebastian Thrun]], former director of the [[Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]] and co-inventor of [[Google Street View]]. Thrun's team at Stanford created the [[Vehicular automation|robotic vehicle]] [[Stanley (vehicle)|Stanley]], which won the [[2005 DARPA Grand Challenge]] and its {{US$|2 million}} prize from the [[United States Department of Defense]].&lt;ref name=NYT2010&gt;{{cite news|author=[[John Markoff]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/10/science/10google.html|title=Google Cars Drive Themselves, in Traffic|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 9, 2010|accessdate=October 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team developing the system consisted of 15 engineers working for Google, including [[Chris Urmson]], Dmitri Dolgov, Mike Montemerlo, and [[Anthony Levandowski]] who had worked on the [[DARPA Grand Challenge|DARPA Grand and Urban Challenges]].&lt;ref name=Google/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hull17"&gt;{{cite news |title=The PayPal Mafia of Self-Driving Cars Has Been at It a Decade |last1=Hull |first1=Dana |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-10-30/it-s-been-10-years-since-robots-proved-they-could-drive |newspaper=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |date=30 October 2017 |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2010, lawmakers in various states expressed concerns over how to regulate the emerging technology. Nevada passed a law in June 2011 concerning the operation of autonomous cars in Nevada,&lt;ref name=GCC0611&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2011/06/ab511-20110625.html|title=Nevada enacts law authorizing autonomous (driverless) vehicles |publisher=Green Car Congress|date=June 25, 2011 |accessdate=June 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which went into effect on March 1, 2012.&lt;ref name=1stLicense&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/08/uk-usa-nevada-google-idUSLNE84701320120508| title=Google gets first self-driven car license in Nevada|author=Mary Slosson |work=[[Reuters]]| date=May 8, 2012| accessdate=May 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Toyota Prius]] modified with Google's experimental driverless technology was licensed by the [[Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles]] (DMV) in May 2012. This was the first license issue in the United States for a self-driven car.&lt;ref name=1stLicense/&gt;

In 2015, Google provided "the world's first fully driverless ride on public roads" to a [[legally blind]] friend of principal engineer Nathaniel Fairfield.&lt;ref&gt; [https://medium.com/waymo/scenes-from-the-street-5bb77046d7ce#.tq11yyoqw On the road with self-driving car user number one]&lt;/ref&gt; The ride was taken by Steve Mahan, former CEO of the Santa Clara Valley Blind Center, in [[Austin, Texas]].&lt;ref name="journey"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.waymo.com/journey/|title=Journey - Waymo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hello"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHbMt6WDhQ8 Say hello to Waymo]&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first driverless ride that was on a public road and was not accompanied by a test driver or police escort.

In June 2015, Google confirmed that there had been 12 collisions as of that time, eight of which involved being rear-ended by another driver at a stop sign or traffic light, two in which the vehicle was side-swiped by another driver, one of which involved another driver rolling through a stop sign, and one where a Google employee was manually driving the car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-google-cars-20150603-story.html |title=Google founder defends accident records of self-driving cars|date=2015-06-03|work=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=2016-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|July 2015}}, Google's 23 self-driving cars have been involved in 14 minor collisions on public roads,&lt;ref name="11accidents"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/googles-autonomous-car-injuries-blame-the-human/|title=Google's autonomous car injuries: Blame the human|author=Charlie Osborne}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Google maintains that, in all cases other than the February 2016 incident, the vehicle itself was not at fault because the cars were either being manually driven or the driver of another vehicle was at fault.&lt;ref name="The View"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/backchannel/the-view-from-the-front-seat-of-the-google-self-driving-car-46fc9f3e6088|title=The View from the Front Seat of the Google Self-Driving Car|author=Urmson|first=Chris|date=|work=Medium|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Google Cars Drive Themselves, in Traffic |author=JOHN MARKOFF |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/10/science/10google.html?_r=1 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 9, 2010 |accessdate=August 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/googles-self-driving-cars-get-in-their-first-accident-2011-8 | title=Human Driver Crashes Google's Self Driving Car | date=August 5, 2011 | accessdate=May 4, 2013 | newspaper=businessinsider.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 14, 2016 while creeping forward to a stoplight, a Google self-driving car attempted to avoid sandbags blocking its path.

Waymo and other companies are required by the California DMV to report the number of incidents during testing where the human driver took control for safety reasons. Some of these incidents were not reported by Google when simulations indicate the car would have coped on its own. There is some controversy concerning this distinction between driver-initiated disengagements that Google reports and those that it does not report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/12/google-self-driving-cars-mistakes-data-reports |title=Google reports self-driving car mistakes: 272 failures and 13 near misses|first=Mark|last=Harris|date=12 January 2016|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limitations===
Waymo operates in some of its testing markets, such as Chandler, Arizona, at level 4 autonomy with no one sitting behind the steering wheel, sharing roadways with other drivers and pedestrians.&lt;ref name="Hawkins17"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Etherington17"/&gt; However, more testing is needed. Waymo's earlier testing has focused on areas without harsh weather, extreme density or complicated road systems, but it has moved on to test under new conditions.&lt;ref name="Ohnsman18"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davies17"/&gt; As a result, Waymo has begun testing in areas with harsher conditions, such as its winter testing in Michigan.&lt;ref name="della Cava17"/&gt;

In 2014, a critic wrote in the ''MIT Technology Review'' that unmapped stopped lights would cause problems with Waymo's technology and the self-driving technology could not detect potholes. Additionally, the lidar technology cannot spot some potholes or discern when humans, such as a police officer, are signaling the car to stop, the critic wrote.&lt;ref name="Gomes14"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/530276/hidden-obstacles-for-googles-self-driving-cars/ |title=Hidden Obstacles for Google's Self-driving Car |author =Lee Gomes | date=August 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waymo has worked to improve how its technology responds in construction zones.&lt;ref name="Castro18"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/9/17307156/google-waymo-driverless-cars-deep-learning-neural-net-interview |title=Inside Waymo's strategy to grow the best brains for self-driving cars |author=Alex Castro |date=9 May 2018 |publisher=[[The Verge]] |accessdate=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jaffe14"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.citylab.com/life/2014/04/first-look-how-googles-self-driving-car-handles-city-streets/8977/ |title=The first look at how Google's self-driving car handles city streets |author=Eric Jaffe |date=28 April 2014 |publisher=[[CityLab (web magazine)|CityLab]] |accessdate=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
