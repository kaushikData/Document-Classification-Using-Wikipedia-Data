[[File:Wildfire in California.jpg|thumb|Age class structures can be used to determine when wildfires occurred within a forest population.]]
'''Age class structure''' in [[fisheries]] and [[wildlife management]] is a part of population assessment. Age class structures can be used to model many populations include trees and fish. This method can be used to predict the occurrence of forest fires within a forest population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wagner|first=C. E.

Fish scales are easiest to obtain, but may be unreliable if scales have fallen off the fish and new ones grown in their places.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/f0752e/F0752E04.HTM "MANUAL OF FISHERIES SCIENCE Part 2 - Methods of Resource Investigation and their Application"]. ''www.fao.org''. Retrieved 2018-03-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Fin spines may be unreliable for the same reason, and most fish do not have spines of sufficient thickness for clear rings to be visible. Otoliths will have stayed with the fish throughout its life history,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but obtaining them requires killing the fish.&lt;ref&gt;Lux, Fred E. "Age Determination in Fishes". Washington, DC, United States: United States Bureau of Commercial Fisheries. Available at http://spo.nmfs.noaa.gov/Fishery%20Leaflets/leaflet488.pdf. Accessed 24/03/2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, otoliths often require more preparation before ageing can occur.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Analyzing fisheries age class structure==
An example of using age class structure to learn about a population is a regular [[normal distribution|bell curve]] for the population of 1-5 year-old fish with a very low population for the 3-year-olds. An age class structure with gaps in population size like the one described earlier implies a bad [[Spawn (biology)|spawning]] year 3 years ago in that species&lt;sup&gt;[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']&lt;/sup&gt;.

Often fish in younger age class structures have very low numbers because they were small enough to slip through the [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] nets, and may in fact have a very healthy population.&lt;ref&gt;Haines, Terry A. (1990). ''Intensive Studies of Stream Fish Populations in Maine''.

The '''art of Newfoundland and Labrador''' has followed a unique artistic trajectory when compared to mainland Canada, due to the geographic seclusion and socio-economic history of the province. Labradorian art possesses its own historical lineage.

While the history of craft and folk art in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] is extensive, fine arts practices have developed primarily since 1949, when the province joined Canada. Prior to [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], the majority of fine art was created by visiting and itinerant artists. Newfoundland and Labradorian art developed significantly after joining Canada, with the introduction of government initiatives.  Since the 1960s in particular, waves of artists have established practices on the island, many with strong roots in the province. Others have been introduced by professional opportunities, residency programs, art education programs, and galleries. An established community of artists is now widely recognized, and creates work in a variety of media.&lt;ref&gt;Mireille Eagan."Before Category," PAGES, vol. 1 no. 1, (The Rooms), 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art in Labrador ==

[[File:Ours nageant (Musée du quai Branly) (3034045389).jpg|thumb|Artifact from Dorset Culture (Collection: Musée du quai Branly)|left]] Labradorian art has its roots in both the aboriginal cultures and the European contact period of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The earliest examples of art in the province were produced by aboriginal peoples, with the oldest known object identified with the [[Dorset Culture]], created around 800 A.D.&lt;ref name="heritage.nf.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/arts/visual-arts.php|title=Visual Arts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During two centuries of European trader and missionary contact with the Inuit, Innu and Settlers of Labrador, there was minor trade in available carvings and crafts. Moravian missionaries arrived in northern Labrador in the 1700s, and [[Wilfred Grenfell|Grenfell]]'s medical mission traveled in the 1800s to southern Labrador and northern Newfoundland. Mission workers helped create a local handicraft industry that allowed residents to sell hooked mats, knitted goods and other items at North American retail shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/society/grenfell-mission.php|title=Grenfell Mission|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, early Grenfell rugs are considered works of art, and many dating from the late 1800s and early 1900s are held in museum collections throughout North America.&lt;ref name="labradorvirtualmuseum.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labradorvirtualmuseum.ca/home/contemporary_art.htm|title=Contemporary Art : Labrador Virtual Museum|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, contemporary visual arts began to flourish. This trend was bolstered by government initiatives, the introduction of technologies and transportation, and a shift in attitude toward northern and aboriginal art as cultural and artistic collector items. In Labrador, this began with a Provincial Government rural development initiative called [[Labrador Craft Producers Association]] (LCPA), which was headed by [[Garfield Warren]]. [[Nain, Newfoundland and Labrador|Nain]] was also visited around this time by visual artist [[Bill Ritchie (Canadian artist)|Bill Ritchie]], who encouraged sculpture and printmaking among Labrador's Inuit artists and initiated a collective for the development and sale of visual arts by artists like [[Gilbert Hay (artist)|Gilbert Hay]] and [[John Terriak]]. The [[Labrador Inuit Association]] continued Ritchie's work for approximately a decade, with marketing and promotion of north coast Inuit art. Arts and crafts as an industry were developed by the LCPA throughout the rest of Labrador until the initiative dismantled in 1993. Prior to its demise, the LCPA mounted a major exhibition and video project entitled "Visions of Labrador," which took place in 1991.&lt;ref name="labradorvirtualmuseum.ca"/&gt;

The Labrador Arts and Culture Centre opened in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newfoundlandlabrador.com/PlanYourTrip/Detail/25080285|title=Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada – Official Tourism Website|publisher=|access-date=2016-06-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804165348/http://www.newfoundlandlabrador.com/PlanYourTrip/Detail/25080285#|archive-date=2016-08-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and aided the growth of visual arts in western Labrador. Individual artists and artists' collectives in the Straits, [[Lake Melville]] and [[Labrador West]] began to develop, market and promote themselves in the visual arts. Labrador Handicrafts Inc. and The Birches Gallery stepped in to fill the void left by government and aboriginal associations. In [[Happy Valley – Goose Bay|Goose Bay]], The Birches Gallery mounted a series of exhibitions and promotional events, in Labrador and several sites throughout North America, from 1994 to 2004.&lt;ref name="labradorvirtualmuseum.ca"/&gt; This, combined with a new initiative in Labrador of the St. John's-based [[Newfoundland and Labrador Craft Council]]'s Labrador Craft Marketing Agency in 1996, provided new impetus for a strong arts and crafts industry. A Visual Arts Association has continued in Western Labrador for more than 20 years, headed by artists such as [[Joyce Channing]], [[Sheilagh Harvey]], [[Margorie O'Brien]], and [[Ed Owen (Canadian artist)|Ed Owen]].&lt;ref name="labradorvirtualmuseum.ca"/&gt;

Today, a strong community of visual arts and artists work in Labrador, basing their work in a variety of media. Notable Labradorian artists include [[Boyd Chubbs]], [[Robin Smith Peck]], [[Mike Massie]], [[Billy Gauthier]], [[Gilbert Hay (artist)|Gilbert Hay]], [[John Terriak]], [[William Lucy]], George Flowers, [[Derrick Pottle]], [[George Collins (artist)|George Collins]], [[David Terriak]], [[Georgina Broomfield]], [[Emily Flowers]], [[John Neville (artist)|John Neville]], [[Madeline Michelin]], [[Barry Pardy]], [[Garmel Rich]], and [[Shannon Simms]].

In 2016, the first exhibition of art by Labrador Inuit was held at [[The Rooms]] Provincial Art Gallery. Titled "SakKijâjuk: Inuit Fine Art and Craft from Nunatsiavut," the exhibition described the history of post-Confederation artistic production in Nunatsiavut.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sakkijajuk.com/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art in Newfoundland ==

=== Beothuk art ===

[[File:"Sketch IX" by Shawnadithit.gif|thumb|"Emblems of Red Indian Mythology" (sketch IX) by Shawnadithit|left]]
[[Beothuk]] were the indigenous inhabitants of Newfoundland from AD 1500 onward, now believed to be largely extinct due to a contraction in their territories following contact with Europeans. Little documentation exists about their cultural practices. Many Beothuk artifacts were discovered in grave sites during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and include carved bone, antler and ivory pendants intricately decorated with incised patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/aboriginal/beothuk-culture.php|title=Beothuk Culture|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another notable feature of [[Beothuk culture]] was the use of powdered [[hematite]], or [[red ochre]], which they used to paint their canoes and other artifacts, and their bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/beothuk/|title=Beothuk|first=James A.|last=Tuck|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1829, ten drawings were obtained by Mr W. E. Cormack during the winter of 1829 from the last known full-blooded Beothuk, [[Shanawdithit]], while she resided in his St. John's house. They present articles of food, utensils, implements and emblems used by the Beothuk, as well as scenes enacted on or near the [[Exploits River]] and [[Red Indian Lake]] between the years 1810 and 1823. "Although rude and truly Indian in character," James P. Howley wrote in 1915 (judging them by European aesthetic standards),"they nevertheless display no small amount of artistic skill, and there is an extraordinary minuteness of topographical detail in those having reference to the Exploits River and adjacent country. These latter bear a striking resemblance to Micmac sketches of a similar character, such as I have frequently seen and made use of, when accompanied by Micmac canoemen on the Geological Survey of the Island. There is one notable omission in either, i.e., the entire absence of anything like a regular scale. As a rule, rivers and lakes are greatly exaggerated, and particular features, which may in nature be situated widely apart, are frequently crowded into a very small space; the reverse being just as frequently the case."&lt;ref&gt;James P. Howley, F.G.S., "Drawings by Shanawdithit", THE BEOTHUCKS OR RED INDIANS: THE ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF NEWFOUNDLAND, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1915, Memorial University of Newfoundland &amp; Labrador Website&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pre-Confederation: "Outsiders and Amateurs" ===

Until about 1900, most art was the work of visiting and itinerant artists. The first known image of the Newfoundland landscape is alleged to have been produced by the itinerant artist [[Gerard Edema]] in the 17th century,&lt;ref&gt;Russell Harper, Painting in Canada: A History, 2nd ed. (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1981), pp. 27-28&lt;/ref&gt; known for "painting landscapes, in which he exhibited a variety of scenes of horror, such as rocks, mountains, precipices, cataracts, and other marks of savage nature."&lt;ref&gt;Horace Walpole. Anecdotes of Painting in England. (London: Alexander Murray, 1871), p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; Topographic drawings and watercolours by naval and military officers were the prevalent art form until the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Mireille Eagan."Before Category," PAGES, vol. 1 no. 1, (The Rooms), 2013. p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Artists such as [[William Eagar]] attempted to teach picturesque painting while in Newfoundland, but his efforts to promote the "new" branch of art were met with very little interest.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra E. Carter, William H. Eagar: "Sensibilities of No Common Order" Masters thesis (Concordia University Fine Arts Department, 1979), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902, the artist [[J.W. Nichols]] composed an instructional article for the public in the Newfoundland Quarterly on "Recreative Art," which provided guidelines for amateurs wishing to explore Nature by painting its beauty.&lt;ref&gt;J.W. Nichols, "Recreative Art," The Newfoundland Quarterly, vol 2, 1902-1903, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Newfoundland-born artists such as [[Maurice Galbraith Cullen|Maurice Cullen]] and [[Robert Pilot]] traveled to Europe to study art with prominent ateliers.&lt;ref&gt;Mireille Eagan."Before Category," PAGES, vol. 1 no. 1, (The Rooms), 2013. p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

The early 20th century brought visiting artists such as [[Rockwell Kent]], and [[Eliot O'Hara]] to Newfoundland. Members of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] came to the island on numerous occasions, drawn to its rocky landscape and northern topography. [[A.Y. Jackson]], [[Arthur Lismer]], and [[Lawren Harris]] created a number of works during their visits, primarily landscape and rural scenes. [[F.H. Varley]] would provide woodcut landscape illustrations for the first commercial release of Newfoundland poet [[E. J. Pratt]], titled "Newfoundland Verse" (1923).&lt;ref&gt;Northrup Frye, Preface to The Bush Garden: Essays on the Canadian Imagination (Toronto: House of Anansi Press, 1971), p. i-iv&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable artists in the 1930s include [[Rhoda Dawson]], who arrived in 1930 to be a design instructor with the Grenfell mission until 1933, returning in 1934 from England to teach at [[Payne's Cove]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Neary, Explanatory material for Rhoda Dawson's "The Wharves of St. John's Newfoundland," Canadian Parliamentary Review, Summer, 1992, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[George Campbell Tinning]] visited Newfoundland as a war artist during the Second World War, returning to paint in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/sgc-cms/histoires_de_chez_nous-community_memories/pm_v2.php?id=story_line&amp;lg=English&amp;fl=0&amp;ex=00000723&amp;sl=7678&amp;pos=1|title=Campbell Tinning - The Newfoundland Paintings|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local amateur art societies became prominent in the 1940s, particularly [[The Art Students Club]], which opened in 1940. Organized by Muriel (Mrs. A.C.) Hunter, with Harold Goodridge as President, the club grew to 40 active members and 100 associates over 10 years, and featured work of artists from overseas and from Newfoundland.&lt;ref&gt;"Without a Suitable Gallery, Club Tries to Encourage Nfld. Art," The Daily News, (June 23, 1950).&lt;/ref&gt; With no official gallery space, exhibitions were held in various locations. Although none were formally trained, notable artists included J.W. Hayward and his son Thomas B. Hayward; Agnes Marian Ayre; and [[Harold B. Goodridge]] (who worked on a number of mural commissions, including one for the lobby of the [[Confederation Building (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Confederation Building]] in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]]).&lt;ref name="heritage.nf.ca"/&gt;

In 1949, [[Robert Ayre]], then editor of [[Canadian Art]], described Newfoundland's artistic environment as one left largely to "outsiders and amateurs" due to its geographic isolation and small population.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Ayre, "Art" in W. Stewart Wallace, The Encyclopedia of Canada. Newfoundland and Supplement, vol. 104 (Toronto: University Associates of Canada, 1949) pp. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After Confederation: A Cultural Renaissance ===

After [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] joined Canada in 1949, government grants fostered a supportive environment for visual artists. The visual arts of the province developed significantly in the second half of the century, with the return of young Newfoundland artists who had studied abroad. Among the first were [[Rae Perlin]], who studied at the [[Art Students League]] in New York, and [[Reginald Shepherd (artist)|Reginald Shepherd]] and [[Helen Parsons Shepherd]], who both graduated from the [[Ontario College of Art]].&lt;ref name="heritage.nf.ca"/&gt; The Shepherds would establish the province's first art school, the Newfoundland Academy of Art, in a house in downtown [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/arts/reginald-shepherd.php|title=Reginald Shepherd|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of the [[Memorial University Extension Services]] and [[St. Michael's Printshop]] in the 1960s and 1970s attracted a number of visual artists to the province to teach and create art. Similarly, the school in Hibbs Hole (now [[Hibb's Cove]]), established by painter [[George Noseworthy]], brought professional artists such as [[Anne Meredith Barry]] to the province.&lt;ref&gt;Mireille Eagan."Before Category," PAGES, vol. 1 no. 1, (The Rooms), 2013. p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960s saw a significant increase in artists based on the island of Newfoundland. Painter [[Christopher Pratt]] returned to the province in 1961 with his wife [[Mary Pratt (painter)|Mary Pratt]] to work at the newly established [[Memorial University Art Gallery]] as its first curator, later transitioning to painting full-time in Salmonier. Wesleyville's [[David Blackwood]] graduated from the [[Ontario College of Art]] in the early 1960s and has achieved acclaim with his images of Newfoundland culture and history, though he no longer resides in the province. Newfoundland-born artist [[Gerald Squires]] returned in 1969.&lt;ref name="heritage.nf.ca"/&gt; Other notable artists who developed their practices during this period include [[Marlene Creates]], [[Diana Dabinett]], [[Kathleen Knowling]], [[Peter Bell (artist)|Peter Bell]], [[Frank Lapointe]], [[Don Wright (artist)|Don Wright]], [[Heidi Oberheide]], [[Manfred Buchheit]], [[Stewart Montgomerie]], [[Jean Claude Roy]] and [[Pam Hall (artist)|Pam Hall]].&lt;ref name="heritage.nf.ca"/&gt;

In 1975, Peter Bell, who was an art critic in addition to being an artist and gallery administrator, wrote: "There has never been anything remotely resembling an art movement in Newfoundland. There have been successive societies and associations of persons interested in painting, but there has been no group with a coherent style or philosophy, nor has there been any developmental succession from one artist to another. Artists in Newfoundland have been, and still are, isolated phenomena. Distinguished, certainly, but independent and unique."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bell. "Painters of Newfoundland" in Canadian Antiques Collector, vol 10 no 2, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary Art in Newfoundland ===

From 1980 to present, opportunities for artists continued to develop, as art galleries such as the [[Art Gallery of Newfoundland and Labrador]] (which later became [[The Rooms]] Provincial Art Gallery), the [[Grenfell Art Gallery]], the [[Resource Centre for the Arts]], and [[Eastern Edge]] were established. Fine arts education programs were established at post-secondary institutions such as [[Sir Wilfred Grenfell College]] in [[Corner Brook]], the Western Community College (now [[College of the North Atlantic]]) in [[Stephenville, Newfoundland and Labrador|Stephenville]], and the [[Anna Templeton Centre]] in St. John's.&lt;ref&gt;Mireille Eagan."Before Category," PAGES, vol. 1 no. 1, (The Rooms), 2013. p. 43-44&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial art galleries such as Bonnie Leyton Gallery of Fine Art, Christina Parker Gallery, Emma Butler Gallery and Red Ochre Gallery, support the work of Newfoundland and Labradorian artists.

In the 1990s, Bulgarian artists came to this province through [[Gander Airport]] as part of a decade-long influx of refugees from the Soviet Block. Notably, [[Luben Boykov]], [[Elena Popova]], [[Vessela Brakalova]] and [[Veselina Tomova]] arrived in 1990. Ellie Yonova would arrive in 1999. Since then, each artist has contributed to the local creative landscape through their personal practices, exhibit design, publications, and public sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lubenboykov.com/about/index.html|title=about|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visavisgraphics.com/about.html|title=vis-à-vis graphics - about us|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thewalrus.ca/notes-from-newfoundland/|title=Notes from Newfoundland|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, the Federal Government announced an investment of more than $1.5 million to assist the City of St. John's to redevelop the Tucker Premises in historic [[Quidi Vidi]] village. The [[Quidi Vidi Plantation]] was opened in 2012 as a "Craft Incubator," with 10 purpose-built studio spaces for local, emerging artisans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stjohns.ca/media-release/grand-opening-held-quidi-vidi-village-plantation|title=Grand Opening Held For Quidi Vidi Village Plantation - City Of St. John's|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sound Symposium]] was started in St John's, Nfld, in 1983. Symposia followed in 1984 and now take place every two years. The event brings together a range of local, national, and international artists working in sound, film, theatre, and dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soundsymposium.com/about/|title=About - SOUND SYMPOSIUM - CELEBRATING NEW MUSIC AND PERFORMANCE ARTS SINCE 1983|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newfoundland and Labrador's arts community is now recognized nationally and internationally. [[Fogo Island Arts]], launched in 2008 on [[Fogo Island, Newfoundland|Fogo Island]], supports a residency-based contemporary art program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fogoislandarts.ca/about/fogo-island-arts/|title=About - Fogo Island Arts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 and 2015, the province was represented at the [[Venice Biennale]] as Official Collateral Projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canadianart.ca/news/newfoundland-officially-accepted-venice-biennale/|title=Newfoundland Accepted by Venice Biennale - Canadian Art|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, [[Philippa Jones]] became the first Newfoundland and Labrador artist to be included in the [[National Gallery of Canada]] contemporary art biennial after it was reinstated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngcmagazine.ca/videos/shine-a-light-canadian-biennial-2014-philippa-jones|title=Shine a Light: Canadian Biennial 2014, Philippa Jones|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Newfoundland is a malleable idea, constantly being dreamt and reconfigured," wrote author [[Lisa Moore (writer)|Lisa Moore]] in 2016, "All cultures are in constant flux, of course. But Newfoundland, hyper-aware of being a distinct society, is at the same time riven with a kind of archival anxiety to hold fast to defining myths; the stories we tell to bring ourselves into existence. This anxiety might be a symptom caused by existing on the periphery, subject to constant swings in economic instability and geographical isolation in a sublime but rugged beauty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canadianart.ca/reviews/what-is-the-new-newfoundland-dream/|title=What Is the New Newfoundland Dream? - Canadian Art|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, a study recorded approximately 1,200 artists in Newfoundland and Labrador, representing 0.47% of the province's labour force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hillstrategies.com/content/artists-and-cultural-workers-canada%E2%80%99s-provinces-and-territories|title=Artists and Cultural Workers in Canada's Provinces and Territories - Hill Strategies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art Galleries ==

=== Commercial Art Galleries ===

Commercial fine art galleries in the province include: Bonnie Leyton Gallery of Fine Art; Emma Butler Gallery; Ewing Gallery; [[Christina Parker Gallery]]; Peter Lewis Gallery; and [[Red Ochre Gallery]].

=== Christopher Pratt Gallery ===

Located in [[Bay Roberts]], NL, the art gallery was named in honour of painter [[Christopher Pratt]], who donated a permanent collection of his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bayrobertsheritagesociety.com/pratt.html|title=Christopher Pratt Gallery|first=Heritage Society|last=Inc.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eastern Edge ===

[[Eastern Edge]] is an artist-run centre based in St. John's, [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]. Eastern Edge Gallery was established in 1984 as the first [[artist-run centre]] in the province. It remains the only artist-run gallery in the province that is dedicated to the presentation of [[contemporary art]] in all media.&lt;ref&gt;https://artmarathonfestival.com/eastern-edge-gallery/{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, it moved out of the LSPU Hall in to Flavin St, where City Building inspectors posted "stop-occupancy orders." Eastern Edge Gallery moved to its current Harbour Dr. location on November 5, 1988&lt;ref&gt;Gabriella Estrada and Mary MacDonald.

=== Grenfell Campus Art Gallery ===

[[Grenfell Art Gallery]] was established in 1988, and is located on the second floor of the Fine Arts Building in [[Corner Brook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grenfell.mun.ca/campus-services/Pages/For%20the%20Community/art-gallery.aspx|title=Art Gallery|publisher=|access-date=2016-06-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625233857/http://www.grenfell.mun.ca/campus-services/Pages/For%20the%20Community/art-gallery.aspx#|archive-date=2016-06-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Rooms Provincial Art Gallery ===

[[The Rooms]] Provincial Art Gallery of Newfoundland and Labrador is the major public gallery in the province. The gallery exhibits original visual art, conducts research, educates about art, and is responsible for permanent art collections held in trust for the public. The Rooms provides 10,000 square feet of gallery space for temporary exhibits, normally balanced between exhibitions produced by the gallery and those borrowed from elsewhere. Exhibitions are toured to satellite galleries throughout the province: [[Mary March Provincial Museum]] in [[Grand Falls-Windsor]], the [[Provincial Seamen's Museum]] in [[Grand Bank]];  and the [[Labrador Interpretation Centre]] in [[North West River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.therooms.ca/exhibits/regional-museums|title=Regional Museums - The Rooms|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Rooms, St John's NL.JPG|thumb|The Rooms, St John's NL]] The gallery manages several collections, known together as the "Permanent Collections": Memorial University of Newfoundland; the J. K. Pratt Memorial Collection; The Rooms Collection; and the Art Procurement Collection of the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador (Provincial Art Bank). Altogether, they comprise over 7,000 works of art, primarily post-1960 Canadian art. Emphasis is placed on art from Newfoundland and Labrador, with major holdings of such artists as [[Christopher Pratt]], [[Mary Pratt (painter)|Mary Pratt]], [[Gerald Squires]], [[David Blackwood]], [[Reginald Shepherd (artist)|Reginald Shepherd]], [[Helen Parsons Shepherd]], [[Don Wright (artist)|Don Wright]], [[Anne Meredith Barry]], [[Marlene Creates]], [[Helen Gregory]], [[Pam Hall (artist)|Pam Hall]], [[Ned Pratt]], and many others.&lt;ref name="heritage.nf.ca1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/arts/rooms-provincial-art-gallery.php|title=The Rooms Provincial Art Gallery|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.therooms.ca/about-us|title=About Us - The Rooms|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gallery began in the university library in 1961. Moving to the St. John's Arts and Culture Centre in 1968, the gallery took on a more active provincial role by organizing regular touring exhibitions to other arts and culture centres. Memorial's Art Gallery became the [[Art Gallery of Newfoundland and Labrador]] in 1994, and then The Rooms Provincial Art Gallery in 2004. Over the years, its administrators have included [[Peter Bell (artist)|Peter Bell]], [[Frank Lapointe]], [[Edythe Goodridge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/curator-edythe-goodridge-was-called-mother-of-newfoundland/article19482353/|title=Art curator Edythe Goodridge was called 'mother' of Newfoundland|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patricia Grattan]], [[Gordon Laurin]], [[Shauna McCabe]], [[Megan Williams (artist)|Megan Williams]], and [[Sheila Perry]]. [[Vicky Chainey Gagnon]] is the current Director and [[Chief Curator]]. [[Bruce Johnson (curator)|Bruce Johnson]] was [[Curator of Contemporary Art]] until 2013, and [[Caroline Stone]] the Curator of Historical Art and Collections until 2014. [[Mireille Eagan]] is the current Curator of Contemporary Art.&lt;ref name="heritage.nf.ca1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2457">In [[epidemiology]], the '''attack rate''' is the biostatistical measure of frequency of [[morbidity]], or speed of spread, in an at risk population. It is used in hypothetical predictions and during actual [[outbreaks]] of disease. An at risk population is defined as one that has no immunity to the attacking pathogen which can be either a [[novel pathogen]] or an established pathogen. It is used to project the number of victims to expect during an [[epidemic]]. This aids in marshalling resources for delivery of medical care as well as production of vaccines and/or anti-viral and anti-bacterial medicines.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony N. Glaser. High-Yield Biostatistics. Williams &amp; Wilkins. Baltimore. 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The rate is arrived at by taking the number of new cases in the population at risk and dividing by the number of persons at risk in the population.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mbox{number of new cases in the population at risk}}{\mbox{number of persons at risk in the population}}=\mbox{Rate}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Rates are determined from the beginning of the [[outbreak]] to its end. The term should probably not be described as a rate because its time dimension is uncertain. While the duration of an epidemic can be predicted given other variables such as early intervention, it cannot be known in absolute terms. In epidemiology, a rate requires a defined unit change (in this instance, time) over which the rate applies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = International Epidemiological Association | title = A Dictionary of Epidemiology. (Last JM, editor) | edition = 4th | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-19-514169-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, it is often referred to as an attack ratio.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16386">Since the widespread adoption of [[reel-to-reel audio tape recording]] in the 1950s, audio tapes and tape [[Compact audio cassette|cassettes]] have been available in many formats. This article describes the length, tape thickness and playing times of some of the most common ones.

All tape thicknesses here refer to the total tape thickness unless otherwise specified, including the base, the oxide coating and any back coating. In the USA, tape thickness is often expressed as the thickness of the base alone. However, this varies from manufacturer to manufacturer and also between tape formulations from the same manufacturer. Outside of the USA, the overall thickness is more often quoted, and is the more relevant measurement when relating the thickness to the length that can be fit onto a reel or into a cassette.

==Reel-to-reel ¼"==

[[Image:Reelt ubt.jpeg|right|200px|thumb|A seven-inch reel of ¼" tape]]

The tape decks of the 1950s were mainly designed to use tape ¼" wide and to accept one of two reel formats:

* Ten-and-a-half-inch reels, almost always with metal flanges, which fit over a hub three inches in diameter. These reels and hubs were similar to those used for wider tape formats such as ½", 1" and 2" tape widths, and were principally used for studio- and other professional applications. The reels were known as '''[[National Association of Broadcasters|NAB]] reels''' and the hubs on which they were mounted as '''NAB hubs'''.
* Reels of up to seven inches in diameter, most commonly with plastic flanges but metal was also used, which fit over a splined ¼" shaft known as a '''[[cine]] spindle'''. These reels dominated domestic applications. The most common sizes were seven, five and three inches in diameter.

In each case the shaft or hub had three splines. In machines designed to allow for vertical mounting, the upper part of the shaft or hub could commonly be rotated by 60° so the upper splines locked the reel in place. Some tape decks could accommodate either format by using removable hubs for the larger reel size. When in use these hubs were locked onto the cine spindles by the same mechanism used to secure the smaller reels.

Reel capacity is affected by both the reel diameter and the reel hub diameter. The standard ten and a half inch reel has approximately twice the capacity of the seven inch reel, which in turn has twice the capacity of the five inch. Some (not all) reels described as three inches are in fact three and a quarter inches in diameter, in order to have half the capacity of a five-inch reel.

===Long play, double play, triple play===

The first commonly available increase in tape length resulted from a reduction in thickness to 35&amp;nbsp;µm, which allowed 3600', 1800' and 900' tapes to fit on ten-and-a-half, seven-, and five-inch reels respectively. These were known as '''long play''' tapes.

Confusingly, for a short time some equipment manufacturers also referred to 3¾-ips tape speed as ''long-play'', but this usage did not persist.

A further reduction to 25&amp;nbsp;µm resulted in '''double-play''' tapes of 2400' on a seven-inch reel. This and thinner tapes were not commonly used on ten-and-a-half-inch reels, as the tape was too fragile for the angular momentum of the larger reels, particularly when rewinding.

Even thinner tapes fitting 3600' on a seven-inch reel and 1800' on a five-inch reel were known as '''triple-play''' tapes. Triple-play tape was too fragile for many tape decks to safely rewind even on a full seven-inch reel, and was more commonly used on five-inch- and smaller reels. However 3600' tapes on seven-inch reels were commercially available for those who wanted them.

Studio- and otherwise professional-quality ¼"-width tapes thinner than long-play were not commercially available in either reel format. However some specialised applications, such as call logging, used ten-and-a-half or larger reels of double-play or thinner tape for extended recording times. These machines were extremely restricted in the reel sizes for which they were designed, and often had no rewind or fast forward facility at all, or even playback. These functions were instead performed on a dedicated machine in the event of playback being required.

In the days when long-distance telephone calls were expensive and often very low quality, three-inch or smaller reels of triple-play or even thinner tape were used for sending long recorded messages by post, most often using 1&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;-ips tape speed. These were known as '''message tapes'''.

===Reel size compatibility===

Although smaller reels could be easily mounted on any machine designed for seven inch reels, in practice there were three limitations on using varying sizes of reel:

* Stability in rewind and fast forward modes was often optimized for a particular reel size to allow faster winding speeds. Some machines provided a switch facility to accommodate different reel sizes, others provided speed controls and relied on manual intervention, still others attempted to sense the reel size by various methods.
* Smaller machines were built for smaller reels, and could not physically mount a full size seven inch reel.
* Mixing reel sizes between supply and takeup spool made fast winding still more complicated, and was discouraged or prohibited by almost all manufacturers. Even mixing metal and plastic flange reels of the same size was not supported by some machines.

Mixing NAB and smaller cine spindle reels was rarely if ever supported, although many machines could physically mount the combination by using one hub adaptor.

==Studio tape formats==

As well as ¼" tape, studio and [[Multitrack recording|multitrack]] machines use tape widths of ½", 1" and 2", and at least one 3" machine was available for a time.

There is also a 35 [[millimetre|mm]] width, but this variety is more similar to the motion picture [[film stock|stock]] of the same width.  It is referred to by the recording and motion picture industries as "magfilm".  It is used for recording analog sound for a motion picture, and for interlocked playback of sound with a picture reel when editing motion picture film on a [[flatbed editor]].  It has also seen use for studio audio recording and mastering, a few albums released by the [[Command Records|Command]] label in the 1960s were mastered using 35 mm magfilm.  It has the same sprocket holes and the thicker acetate (or polyester) base of 35 mm negative or reversal cinema stock, but instead has a magnetic oxide layer, coating the full width of the film base (as opposed to a photographic emulsion).  This variety is referred to as "fullcoat magfilm".  Another variant, "stripe magfilm", has only three separate oxide "tracks" on the base, with the rest of the base being clear, with the same 35 mm sprocket holes as well.

Tapes of ½", 1" and 2" width are available in many professional formulations, especially but not only formulations of 35&amp;nbsp;µm thickness (the thickness known as ''long play'' when used as ¼" tape). The wider tape also made it possible to produce professional quality tapes of about 25 µm thickness (the thickness known as ''double play'' in ¼" applications) in ½" and wider formats.

In all tape widths including ¼", some studio machines use one-sided '''platters''' instead of reels. As normal studio practice is not to rewind immediately after recording or playing but rather to store tape with the start end in to take advantage of the even tension produced by the tape transport, tapes from these machines were generally stored on the platters even if the machine was capable of mounting an NAB reel. Other machines used NAB or custom reels in the larger width.

The sizes of platters and their hubs varies, NAB hubs being most common, and tape lengths up to 5000' not uncommon.

==Compact audio cassettes==

The tape in a [[compact audio cassette]] is nominally ⅛ inch but actually slightly wider ({{convert|3.81|mm|in}}).  The small mass of the spools and mechanism generally allows thinner tape to be used than is practical with reel-to-reel.

The thickest tape normally used in cassettes is about 16&amp;nbsp;µm in thickness, and is used in C60 cassettes and in shorter lengths such as the C46. As the standard tape speed for a compact cassette is 1⅞ ips and a C60 cassette records 30 minutes per side, a C60 cassette in theory holds 281¼' (85.73 m) of tape. In practice there is some variation, for example Maxell quote their C60s as being 90 m (295') in length.

Tape about 11.2&amp;nbsp;µm in thickness is used in C90 cassettes, and also for those intermediate between a C60 and a C90, for example the C74 produced specifically for recording a standard length CD. Most equipment manufacturers optimize their equipment for C90 cassettes but fully support shorter cassettes using either 11.2&amp;nbsp;µm or 16&amp;nbsp;µm tape.

A cassette longer than a C90, such as a C120, must use even thinner tape. Many equipment manufacturers discourage the use of these longer cassettes, partly because the tape is so fragile, and also because of the difficulty of providing optimum recording over an extended range of tape thicknesses (thinner tape is more prone to "print through" echo). However C180  cassettes have been produced both for the consumer market and for specialised applications such as call logging.

Rumours have sometimes associated C120 and longer cassettes with double or triple play reel-to-reel tape, but in fact even C60 cassettes use tape thinner than double play and little thicker than triple play. The main thing that the longer cassettes have in common with double and triple play reel-to-reel tapes is that they are pushing similar limits of technology, and as a consequence suffer similar problems.

==Microcassettes==

Although the [[microcassette]] uses tape thinner than the C90 compact cassette (the width is the same), much of its reduced size comes from using shorter tapes at slower recording speeds. The original standard MC60 microcassette contained 43.2 m (142') of tape for 30 minutes recording per side at 2.4&amp;nbsp;cm/s (about &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; ips, making it half the standard speed of a compact cassette). Most recorders also provide a slower speed of 1.2&amp;nbsp;cm/s, doubling the recording time but with poor sound quality. The only other common sizes are the MC30 with half the length of slightly thicker tape, and the MC90 with 50% more tape length then the MC60, and correspondingly thinner tape.

== Tape speeds ==
In sound recording, magnetic tape [[speed]] is often quoted in [[inches per second]] (abbreviated '''ips''') for historical reasons.  Magnetic tape speeds are commonly an even fraction of 30 ips:

Tape recording first became common enough for the issue of compatibility between [[tape deck]] manufacturers to become an issue in the 1950s. At this time the most common speeds for professional recording were 30 ips and 15 ips, and some machines already supported both speeds. As the tape speed was determined by the speed of a [[synchronous motor]] driving a capstan, one way of achieving this was to switch the poles of the motor to a different configuration, halving or doubling the speed.

This system was extended to domestic tape decks, and so slower speeds as they were adopted tended to be exactly half the previous slowest speed. Pre-recorded tapes were mostly 7&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ips, with a few at 3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ips. Message tapes transmitted by post and call logging tapes were commonly recorded at 1&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; ips or even &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; ips. The most common [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel]] speed of 7&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ips is approximately 19&amp;nbsp;cm/s.

Another cause of incompatibility between tape decks was the lack of standardisation of track widths and the use of alternate (rather than adjacent) stereo tracks by many manufacturers (which limited compatibility with mono equipment).

When Philips introduced the [[compact audio cassette]], they chose to specify the reel-to-reel standard of 1&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; ips (approximately {{convert|1.875|in/s|cm/s|2|disp=output only}}). Although with narrower and thinner tape.  Higher speed machines using compact cassettes commonly use 3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ips.

Although the [[microcassette]] is specified to have a standard record speed of 2.4&amp;nbsp;cm/s and low speed of 1.2&amp;nbsp;cm/s, in the [[dictaphone]] application for which it was designed these speeds are in practice identical to &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; ips  and &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt; ips. Playback speed is not specified, and on many machines is continuously variable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5225">'''Biblical grammarians''' were linguists whose understanding of the [[Bible]] at least partially related to the science of [[Hebrew language]]. [[Tannaitic]] and Ammoraic [[exegesis]] rarely toiled in [[grammatical]] problems; grammar was a borrowed science from the [[Arab world]] in the [[medieval period]]. Despite its foreign influence, however, [[Hebrew grammar]] was a strongly [[Jewish]] product and developed independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Encyclopedia|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6854-grammar-hebrew#anchor4|accessdate=March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have continued to study grammar throughout the ages, until the present. Those mentioned in this article are a few of the most eminent grammarians.

== Early influences ==
=== Masoretes ===
The [[Masoretes]], who solidified the [[Masoretic Text]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]], vocalized and punctuated the biblical text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Encyclopædia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/64496/biblical-literature|accessdate=March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Most of the work of the Masoretes is generally anonymous, though we know several names of Masoretes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Judaica, s.v. "Masorah"|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;   While their work essentially focused on establishing the correct text and not the principles of grammar, the Masoretes contributed to the future study of biblical language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Encyclopedia| url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6854-grammar-hebrew#anchor4|accessdate=March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Many future grammarians continued the efforts of the Masorah and gave it a “central place in their works.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Judaica, s.v. "Masorah"|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medieval grammarians ==
=== Saadia Ga’on ===
Saadia Ga’on dealt with [[inflections]] and roots in his grammatical work. These contributions laid essential foundations for future grammarians. He also wrote about exceptions. His contemporary, [[Menahem ben Saruk]], elaborated upon the study of roots, and was also the first grammarian to write in Hebrew. A pupil of Saadia’s, [[Dunash ben Labrat]], criticized both [[Menahem]] and Saadia’s works but made many important contributions to understanding roots. Defenses of both sides by scholars such as Rabben Tam and ibn Ezra continued for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Encyclopedia| url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6854-grammar-hebrew#anchor4|accessdate=March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rashi ===
[[Rashi]]'s commentary attempted to explain the simple meaning of the biblical text. In many places in his commentary, Rashi explains a linguistic or grammatical rule, providing several examples of other places in which that rule applies. Many of his principles he derives from the work of Menahem and Dunash. Evidence shows that Rashi understood the difference between [[biblical Hebrew]] and [[rabbinic Hebrew]]. Rashi also utilized [[Old French]] to explain the meaning of words that could not be otherwise explained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Judaica, s.v. "Rashi"|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abraham ibn Ezra ===
In his introduction to the [[Pentateuch]], [[Abraham ibn Ezra|Ibn Ezra]] writes that his commentary is “bound by the cords of grammar.” The way to appreciating the text is to understand the simple meaning, and he opposed explanations of the text that do not explain the original intent. Generally, he limited applying predecessors’ laws to understanding the text and avoided outlandish explanations of exceptions. A specific opposition ibn Ezra had was to the explanation of “plene versus defective spelling.” The Spanish commentator also wrote several grammatical works outside his biblical commentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Judaica, s.v. "Ibn Ezra, Abraham"|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Joseph Kimhi ===
[[Joseph Kimhi]] of the 12th century composed Sefer Zikkaron, introducing a new understanding of vowels. His two sons, Moses and David, also were grammarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Encyclopedia| url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6854-grammar-hebrew#anchor4|accessdate=March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kimhis were exegets who relied most on [[peshat]] and avoided homileteical interpretations, and especially for David, [[philology]] played a large role in that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Judaica, s.v. "Kimhi, David"|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern grammarians ==
=== The ''maskilim'' ===
The ''maskilim'' abandoned the use of rabbinic Hebrew and returned to biblical Hebrew. They felt serious grammar was of major import for modernization. [[Naphtali Herz Wessely]] and Judah Leib Ben Ze’ev were major perpetrators of this movement of Hebrew, which may have led to modern Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Judaica, s.v. "Hebrew Language"|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Study of Hebrew grammar had been neglected for nearly two centuries until the arrival of Moses Mendelssohn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Encyclopedia| url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6854-grammar-hebrew#anchor4|accessdate=March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7058">'''Biomarkers of aging''' are [[biomarker]]s that could predict functional capacity at some later age better than will chronological age.&lt;ref  name="BakerGT"&gt;{{cite journal | author=George T. Baker, III and Richard L. Sprott | title=Biomarkers of aging | journal=Experimental Gerontology | volume=23 | issue=4–5 | year=1988 | pages=223–239 | id= | pmid=3058488 | doi=10.1016/0531-5565(88)90025-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stated another way, biomarkers of [[ageing|aging]] would give the true "biological age", which may be different from the chronological age.

Validated biomarkers of aging would allow for testing interventions to [[life extension|extend lifespan]], because changes in the biomarkers would be observable throughout the lifespan of the organism.&lt;ref name="BakerGT" /&gt;  Although [[maximum lifespan]] would be a means of validating biomarkers of aging, it would not be a practical means for long-lived species such as humans because [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]] would take far too much time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Harrison, Ph.D. | first = David E. | title = V. Life span as a biomarker | publisher = [[Jackson Laboratory]] | date = November 11, 2011 | url = http://research.jax.org/faculty/harrison/ger1vLifespan1.html | accessdate = 2011-12-03 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120426015835/http://research.jax.org/faculty/harrison/ger1vLifespan1.html | archivedate = April 26, 2012 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ideally, biomarkers of aging should assay the biological process of [[ageing]] and not a predisposition to disease, should cause a minimal amount of trauma to assay in the organism, and should be reproducibly measurable during a short interval compared to the lifespan of the organism.&lt;ref name="BakerGT" /&gt;

Although [[Human hair color#Gray and white hair|graying of hair]] increases with age,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Van Neste D, Tobin DJ | title=Hair cycle and hair pigmentation: dynamic interactions and changes associated with aging | journal=MICRON | volume=35 | issue=3 | year=2004 | pages=193–200 | id= | pmid=15036274 | doi=10.1016/j.micron.2003.11.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; hair graying cannot be called a biomarker of ageing. Similarly, [[wrinkle|skin wrinkles]] and other common changes seen with aging are not better indicators of future functionality than chronological age. [[Gerontology#Biogerontology|Biogerontologists]] have continued efforts to find and validate biomarkers of aging, but success thus far has been limited. Levels of CD4 and CD8 [[memory T cell]]s and [[naive T cell]]s have been used to give good predictions of the expected lifespan of middle-aged mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Miller RA | title=Biomarkers of aging: prediction of longevity by using age-sensitive T-cell subset determinations in a middle-aged, genetically heterogeneous mouse population| journal=Journals of Gerontology | volume=56 | issue=4 | year=2001 | pages=B180–B186 | id= | pmid=11283189 | doi=10.1093/gerona/56.4.b180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in [[big data]] analysis allowed for the new types of "aging clocks" to be developed. The [[epigenetic clock]] is a promising biomarker of aging and can accurately predict human chronological age.&lt;ref name="pmid24138928"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Horvath S | title=DNA methylation age of human tissues and cell types | journal=[[Genome Biology]]  | volume=14 | issue=10 | year=2013 | pages=R115  | url = http://genomebiology.com/2013/14/10/r115  | pmc = 4015143 |pmid=24138928 | doi=10.1186/gb-2013-14-10-r115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basic blood biochemistry and cell counts can also be used to accurately predict the chronological age.&lt;ref name="pmid27191382"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Zhavoronkov A |title=Deep biomarkers of human aging: Application of deep neural networks to biomarker development |journal= Aging |volume=8 |issue=5 |year=2016 |pages= 1021–33 |url=http://www.aging-us.com/article/SzdNR3HCatAdyvwPR/text |pmc= 4931851 |pmid= 27191382 |doi= 10.18632/aging.100968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies of the [[hematological clock]] on the large datasets from South Korean, Canadian, and Eastern European populations demonstrated that biomarkers of aging may be population-specific and predictive of mortality.&lt;ref name= "pmid29340580"&gt;{{cite journal |title= Population Specific Biomarkers of Human Aging: A Big Data Study Using South Korean, Canadian, and Eastern European Patient Populations |journal= The Journals of Gerontology: Series A |volume= 6 |issue= 11 |pages= 1482–1490 |year=2018 |author= Polina Mamoshina, Kirill Kochetov, Evgeny Putin, Franco Cortese, Alexander Aliper, Won-Suk Lee, Sung-Min Ahn, Lee Uhn, Neil Skjodt, Olga Kovalchuk, Morten Scheibye-Knudsen, Alex Zhavoronkov |url= http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9570 |doi= 10.1093/gerona/gly005 |pmid= 29340580 |pmc= 6175034 |via= (text: [https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/advance-article/doi/10.1093/gerona/gly005/4801287#111582158 link])}} &lt;/ref&gt;
It is also possible to predict the human chronological age using the [[transcriptomic clock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The transcriptional landscape of age in human peripheral blood |journal=Nature Communications |volume=6 |pages=8570 |year=2015 |author= Peters M |url= http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9570 |doi=10.1038/ncomms9570 |pmid=26490707 |pmc=4639797 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A broader acceptance of biomarkers of aging, however, will depend on a better understanding of the observed correlations to the incidence of specific diseases, improved transferability of the models across populations and reduction of costs of the studies. The recent introduction of low-power and compact sensors, based on micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) has led to a new breed of the wearable and affordable devices providing unparalleled opportunities for the collecting and cloud-storing personal digitized activity records. 
Consequently, modern [[deep learning]] techniques could be used to produce a proof-of-concept digital biomarker of age in the form of all-causes-mortality predictor from a sufficiently  large collection of one week long human physical activity streams augmented by the rich clinical data (including the death register, as provided by, e.g., the [[NHANES]] study).&lt;ref name="pmid 29581467"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tim Pyrkov, Konstantin Slipensky, Mikhail Barg, Alexey Kondrashin, Boris Zhurov, Alexander Zenin, Mikhail Pyatnitskiy, Leonid Menshikov, Sergei Markov, and Peter O.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8822">[[Image:Bioretention cell rain garden US winter.jpg|thumb|A bioretention cell, also called a [[rain garden]], in the [[United States]]. It is designed to treat polluted [[stormwater]] [[Surface runoff|runoff]] from an adjacent parking lot. Plants are in winter dormancy.]]

'''Bioretention''' is the process in which contaminants and [[sedimentation]] are removed from [[stormwater]] [[Surface runoff|runoff]]. Stormwater is collected into the treatment area which consists of a grass buffer strip, sand bed, ponding area, [[organic matter|organic]] layer or [[mulch]] layer, planting [[soil]], and plants. Runoff passes first over or through a sand bed, which slows the runoff's velocity, distributes it evenly along the length of the ponding area, which consists of a surface [[organic matter|organic]] layer and/or [[groundcover]] and the underlying planting soil. The ponding area is graded, its center depressed. Water is ponded to a depth of {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} and gradually infiltrates the bioretention area or is [[Evapotranspiration|evapotranspired]]. The bioretention area is graded to divert excess runoff away from itself. Stored water in the bioretention area planting soil exfiltrates over a period of days into the underlying soils.&lt;ref name="EPA Fact"&gt;{{cite report |date=September 1999 |title=Storm Water Technology Fact Sheet: Bioretention |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=200044BE.txt |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C. |id=EPA-832-F-99-012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Filtration==
Each of the components of the bioretention area is designed to perform a specific function. The grass buffer strip reduces incoming runoff velocity and filters [[particulate]]s from the runoff. The sand bed also reduces the velocity, filters particulates, and spreads flow over the length of the bioretention area. [[Aeration]] and drainage of the planting soil are provided by the {{convert|0.5|m|in|abbr=on}} deep sand bed. The ponding area provides a temporary storage location for runoff prior to its [[evaporation]] or [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]]. Some particulates not filtered out by the grass filter strip or the sand bed settle within the ponding area.&lt;ref name="EPA Fact" /&gt;

The [[organic matter|organic]] or [[mulch]] layer also filters [[Water pollution|pollutants]] and provides an environment conducive to the growth of [[microorganism]]s, which degrade [[petroleum]]-based products and other [[organic matter|organic]] material. This layer acts in a similar way to the [[Plant litter|leaf litter]] in a forest and prevents the [[erosion]] and drying of underlying soils. Planted [[groundcover]] reduces the potential for erosion as well, slightly more effectively than mulch. The maximum sheet flow velocity prior to erosive conditions is 0.3 meters per second (1 foot per second) for planted groundcover and 0.9 meters per second (3 feet per second) for mulch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=Clar |first1=M.L. |last2=Barfield |first2=B.J. |last3=O’Connor |first3=T.P. |date=2004 |title=Stormwater Best Management Practice Design Guide, Volume 2: Vegetative Biofilters |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=901X0B00.txt |publisher=EPA |location=Cincinnati, OH |id=EPA-600/R-04/121A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[clay]] in the planting soil provides [[adsorption]] sites for [[hydrocarbon]]s, [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]], [[nutrient]]s and other pollutants. Stormwater storage is also provided by the voids in the planting soil. The stored water and nutrients in the water and soil are then available to the plants for uptake. The layout of the bioretention area is determined after site constraints such as location of utilities, underlying soils, existing vegetation, and drainage are considered. Sites with [[loam]]y sand soils are especially appropriate for bioretention because the excavated soil can be backfilled and used as the planting soil, thus eliminating the cost of importing planting soil. An unstable surrounding soil stratum and soils with a clay content greater than 25 percent may preclude the use of bioretention, as would a site with slopes greater than 20 percent or a site with mature trees that would be removed during construction of the [[Best management practice for water pollution|best management practices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=2009 |title=Bioretention Manual |url=http://www.co.pg.md.us/Government/AgencyIndex/DER/ESG/Bioretention/pdf/Bioretention%20Manual_2009%20Version.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108182559/http://www.co.pg.md.us/Government/AgencyIndex/DER/ESG/Bioretention/pdf/Bioretention%20Manual_2009%20Version.pdf |archive-date=2011-01-08 |publisher=Prince George's County Department of Environmental Resources |location=Largo, MD |pages=6, 42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heavy metal remediation==
Contaminant trace metals such as [[zinc]], [[lead]], and [[copper]] are found in [[stormwater runoff]] from impervious surfaces (e.g. roadways and sidewalks). Treatment systems such as rain gardens and stormwater planters utilize a bioretention layer to remove heavy metals in stormwater runoff. Dissolved forms of heavy metals may bind to sediment particles in the roadway that are then captured by the bioretention system. Additionally, heavy metals may adsorb to soil particles in the bioretention media as the runoff filters through.&lt;ref&gt;Li, H., &amp; Davis, A. P. (2008). {{doi|10.1021/es702681j}} "Heavy metal capture and accumulation in bioretention media." Environmental science &amp; technology, 42(14), 5247-5253.&lt;/ref&gt; In laboratory experiments, bioretention cells removed 94%, 88%, 95%, and &gt;95% of zinc, copper, lead, and [[cadmium]], respectively from water with metal concentrations typical of stormwater runoff. While this is a great benefit for water quality improvement, bioretention systems have a finite capacity for heavy metal removal. This will ultimately control the lifetime of bioretention systems, especially in areas with high heavy metal loads.&lt;ref&gt;Sun, X., &amp; Davis, A. P. (2007).[http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0045653506010927/1-s2.0-S0045653506010927-main.pdf?_tid=325fb1ca-8149-11e4-9703-00000aab0f01&amp;acdnat=1418311390_040bf304a2459b6fcaaeff49731195a6 "Heavy metal fates in laboratory bioretention systems."] Chemosphere, 66(9), 1601-1609.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Metal removal by bioretention cells in cold climates was similar or slightly lower than that in warmer environments. Plants are less active in colder seasons, suggesting that most of the heavy metals remain in the bioretention media rather than being taken up by plant roots.&lt;ref&gt;Muthanna, T. M., Viklander, M., Gjesdahl, N., &amp; Thorolfsson, S. T. (2007).[http://search.proquest.com/docview/746872016/ "Heavy metal removal in cold climate bioretention."] Water, air, and soil pollution, 183(1-4), 391-402.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, removal and replacement of the bioretention layer will become necessary in areas with heavy metal pollutants in stormwater runoff to extend the life of the treatment system.

'''COPII''' is a [[coatomer]], a type of [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]] coat protein that transports proteins from the [[Endoplasmic reticulum#Rough endoplasmic reticulum|rough endoplasmic reticulum]] to the [[Golgi apparatus]].&lt;ref name="pmid17686639"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee MC, Miller EA | title = Molecular mechanisms of COPII vesicle formation | journal = Semin.

The name "COPII" refers to the specific '''co'''at '''p'''rotein complex that initiates the budding process.  The coat consists of large protein subcomplexes that are made of four different protein subunits.

==Coat proteins==
There are two protein [[heterodimer]]s that form the coat complex.  These proteins are
*[[SEC23A|Sec23p]]/[[SEC24A|Sec24p]] Heterodimer
*[[SEC13|Sec13p]]/[[SEC31|Sec31p]] Heterotetramer
These proteins alone are not able to cause the budding of the vesicle or direct the vesicle to the correct target membrane.  SNARE, cargo, and other proteins are also needed for these processes to occur.  The CopII protein does, however, cause the binding that forms vesicle coat, and thereby causes the release from the ER.  The exact process of how the vesicle is brought to a particular location, or how that location is determined is not yet known.

==Budding process==
The [[GTPase]] [[Sar1]]p is a protein that hydrolyzes [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]] and acts like a molecular "switch" that flips between an activated and membrane embedded GTP-bound form, and inactive and soluble GDP-bound form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bonifacino|first=Juan S.|last2=Glick|first2=Benjamin S.|date=2004-01-23|title=The mechanisms of vesicle budding and fusion|journal=Cell|volume=116|issue=2|pages=153–166|issn=0092-8674|pmid=14744428|doi=10.1016/s0092-8674(03)01079-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inactive GDP-bound Sar1p is attracted to the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum. Sec12, a transmembrane protein found in the ER acts as a Guanine nucleotide exchange factor by stimulating the release of GDP to allow the binding of GTP. Now in a GTP bound state, Sar1p undergoes a conformational change which exposes a hydrophobic tail that can be inserted into the lipid bilayer, binding it to the membrane.  Membrane-bound Sar1p recruits the Sec23p/24p complex to form what is collectively known as the pre-budding complex. The pre-budding complex recruits the long, flexible Sec13p/31p complex.  Sec13p/31p complexes polymerizes on the cytosolic side of the membrane to form a convex mesh structure.  The assembling mesh causes the membrane to bulge outward until a vesicle buds off. Some proteins are found to be responsible for selectively packaging cargos into COPII vesicles. For example, Erv29p in ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' is found to be necessary for packaging glycosylated pro-α-factor.&lt;ref&gt;Belden WJ and Barlowe C. [http://science.sciencemag.org/content/294/5546/1528.full Role of Erv29p in Collecting Soluble Secretory Proteins into ER-Derived Transport Vesicles]. ''Science''. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conformational changes==
CopII has three specific binding sites that can each be complexed.  The adjacent picture (Sed5) uses the Sec22 t-SNARE complex to bind.  This site is more strongly bound, and therefore is more favored. (Embo)

&lt;!-- The article does not contain how to instructions, i.e. a protocol (=recipe), but discussed various practical methods of cell disruption--&gt;
[[File:Cell disruptor-Genie.jpg|thumb|right|Laboratory cell disruptor]]
'''Cell disruption''' is a method or process for releasing biological [[molecules]] from inside a [[Cell (biology)|cell]].

==Methods==
The production of biologically interesting molecules using [[cloning]] and [[cell culture|culturing]] methods allows the study and manufacture of relevant molecules. Except for excreted molecules, cells producing molecules of interest must be disrupted. This page discusses various methods.

==Bead method==
A common laboratory-scale mechanical method for cell disruption uses tiny glass, ceramic or steel beads mixed with a sample suspended in aqueous media. First developed by Tim Hopkins in the late 1970s, the sample and bead mix is subjected to high level agitation by stirring or shaking. Beads collide with the cellular sample, cracking open the cell to release intercellular components. Unlike some other methods, mechanical shear is moderate during homogenization resulting in excellent membrane or subcellular preparations. The method, often called "beadbeating", works well for all types of cellular material - from spores to animal and plant tissues. It is the most widely used method of yeast lysis, and can yield breakage of over 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.embl.de/pepcore/pepcore_services/protein_purification/extraction_clarification/cell_lysates_yeast/|title=Protein Purification|author=EMBL - Office of Information and Public Affairs|work=embl.de|accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has the advantage over other mechanical cell disruption methods of being able to disrupt very small sample sizes, process many samples at a time with no cross-contamination concerns, and does not release potentially harmful aerosols in the process.

In the simplest example of the method, an equal volume of beads are added to a cell or tissue suspension in a test tube and the sample is vigorously mixed on a common laboratory vortex mixer. While processing times are slow, taking 3-10 times longer than that in specialty shaking machines, it works well for easily disrupted cells and is inexpensive. Process times can be improved by using a bead dispenser to load the beads into the vials or plates. The company LabTIE produces Bead dispensers that dispenses the beads in a grid in only 8 seconds&lt;ref&gt;https://www.labtie.com/112346-bead-dispensers&lt;/ref&gt;.

In most laboratories, beadbeating is done in sealed, plastic vials, centrifuge tubes, or deep-well microtiter plates. The sample and tiny beads are agitated at about 2000 oscillations per minute in specially designed vial shakers driven by high power electric motors. Cell disruption is complete in 1–3 minutes of shaking. Machines are available that can process hundreds of samples simultaneously inside deep well microplates.

Successful beadbeating is dependent not only design features of the shaking machine (which take into consideration shaking oscillations per minute, shaking throw or distance, shaking orientation and vial orientation), but also the selection of correct bead size (0.1–6&amp;nbsp;mm diameter), bead composition (glass, ceramic, steel) and bead load in the vial.

All high energy beadbeating machines warm the sample about 10 degrees/minute. This is due to frictional collisions of the beads during homogenization. Cooling of the sample during or after beadbeating may be necessary to prevent damage to heat sensitive proteins such as enzymes. Sample warming can be controlled by beadbeating for short time intervals with cooling on ice between each interval, by processing vials in pre-chilled aluminum vial holders or by circulating gaseous coolant through the machine during beadbeating.

A different beadbeater configuration, suitable for larger sample volumes, uses a fluorocarbon rotor inside a 15, 50 or 200 ml chamber to agitate the beads. In this configuration, the chamber can be surrounded by a static cooling jacket. Using the same rotor/chamber configuration, large commercial machines are available to process many liters of cell suspension. Currently, these machines are limited to processing monocellular organisms such as yeast, algae and bacteria.

==Cryopulverization==
Samples with a tough extracellular matrix, such as animal connective tissue, some tumor biopsy samples, venous tissue, cartilage, seeds, etc., are reduced to a fine powder by impact pulverization at liquid nitrogen temperatures. This technique, known as cryopulverization, is based on the fact that biological samples containing a significant fraction of water become brittle at extremely cold temperatures. This technique was first described by Smucker and Pfister in 1975, who referred to the technique as cryo-impacting. The authors demonstrated cells are effectively broken by this method, confirming by phase and electron microscopy that breakage planes cross cell walls and cytoplasmic membranes.&lt;ref&gt;Liquid Nitrogen Cryo-Impacting: a New Concept for Cell Disruption.  Richard A. Smucker, Robert M. Pfister. Appl Microbiol. 1975 September; 30(3): 445–449.&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique can be done by using a mortar and pestle cooled to liquid nitrogen temperatures, but use of this classic apparatus is laborious and sample loss is often a concern. Specialised stainless steel pulverizers generically known as Tissue Pulverizers are also available for this purpose. They require less manual effort, give good sample recovery and are easy to clean between samples.
Advantages of this technique are higher yields of proteins and nucleic acids from small, hard tissue samples - especially when used as a preliminary step to mechanical or chemical/solvent cell disruption methods mentioned above.

==Physical Cell Disruption==
Since the 1940s high pressure has been used as a method of cell disruption, most notably by the [[French Pressure Cell Press]], or French Press for short.  This method was developed by Charles Stacy French and utilises high pressure to force cells through a narrow orifice, causing the cells to lyse due to the shear forces experienced across the pressure differential.&lt;ref&gt;The photochemical activity of isolated chloroplasts. C. S. French, H. W. Milner, M. L. Koenig, and F. D. H. Macdowall. Carn. Inst. Wash. Yearb. 1948; 47:91-93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The photochemical reduction process in photosynthesis. In Symposia of the Society for Experimental Biology. C. S. French, H. W. Milner. V. Carbon Dioxide Fixation and Photosynthesis. 232-250. Cambridge University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;  While French Presses have become a staple item in many microbiology laboratories, their production has been largely discontinued, leading to a resurgence in alternate applications of similar technology.

Modern physical cell disruptors typically operate via either pneumatic or hydraulic pressure.  Although pneumatic machines are typically lower cost, their performance can be unreliable due to variations in the processing pressure throughout the stroke of the air pump.  It is generally considered that hydraulic machines offer superior lysing ability, especially when processing harder to break samples such as yeast or [[Gram-positive bacteria]], due to their ability to maintain constant pressure throughout the piston stroke.  As the French Press, which is operated by hydraulic pressure, is capable of over 90% lysis of most commonly used cell types it is often taken as the gold standard in lysis performance and modern machines are often compared against it not only in terms of lysis efficiency but also in terms of safety and ease of use.  Some manufacturers are also trying to improve on the traditional design by altering properties within these machines other than the pressure driving the sample through the orifice.  One such example is Constant Systems, who have recently shown that their Cell Disruptors not only match the performance of a traditional French Press, but also that they are striving towards attaining the same results at a much lower power.&lt;ref&gt;Under Pressure, M. Lougher, European Biopharmaceutical Review, July 2016; 12-16&lt;/ref&gt;

Pressure Cycling Technology ("PCT"). PCT is a patented, enabling technology platform that uses alternating cycles of hydrostatic pressure between ambient and ultra-high levels (up to 90,000 psi) to safely, conveniently and reproducibly control the actions of molecules in biological samples, e.g., the rupture (lysis) of cells and tissues from human, animal, plant, and microbial sources, and the inactivation of pathogens.  PCT-enhanced systems (instruments and consumables) address some challenging problems inherent in biological sample preparation.

==Microfluidizer Method==
This method used for cell disruption strongly influences the physicochemical properties of the [[Lysis|lysed]] cell suspension, such as particle size, viscosity, protein yield and enzyme activity.  In recent years the Microfluidizer method has gained popularity in cell disruption due to its ease of use and efficiency at disrupting many different kinds of cells. The Microfluidizer technology was licensed from a company called Arthur D. Little and was first developed and utilized in the 1980s, initially starting as a tool for [[liposome]] creation. It has since been used in other applications such as cell disruption [[Emulsion|nanoemulsions]], and solid particle size reduction, among others.

By using [[Microchannel (microtechnology)|microchannels]] with fixed geometry, and an intensifier pump, high [[shear rate]]s are generated that rupture the cells.  This method of cell lysis can yield breakage of over 90% of E. coli cells.&lt;ref&gt;Evaluation of the Microfluidizer for Cell Disruption of Yeast and Chlorella by E. Uera-Santos, C.D. Copple, EA Davis and WG. Hagar.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many proteins are extremely temperature-sensitive, and in many cases can start to denature at temperatures of only 4 degrees celsius. Within the microchannels, temperatures exceed 4 degrees celsius, but the machine is designed to cool quickly so that the time the cells are exposed to elevated temperatures is extremely short ([[residence time (fluid dynamics)|residence time]] 25 ms-40 ms). Because of this effective temperature control, the Microfluidizer yields higher levels of active proteins and enzymes than other mechanical methods when the proteins are temperature-sensitive.&lt;ref&gt;agerkvist, Irene, and Sven-Olof Enfors.”Characterization Of E. Coli Cell Disintegrates from a Bead Bill and High Pressure Homogenizer.”Biotechnology and bioengineering Biotechnol.Bioeng.36.11 (1990):1083-089.Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

Viscosity changes are also often observed when disrupting cells. If the cell suspension viscosity is high, it can make downstream handling—such as filtration and accurate pipetting—quite difficult. The viscosity changes observed with a Microfluidizer are relatively low, and decreases with further additional passes through the machine.&lt;ref&gt;agerkvist, Irene, and Sven-Olof Enfors.”Characterization Of E. Coli Cell Disintegrates from a Bead Bill and High Pressure Homogenizer.”Biotechnology and bioengineering Biotechnol.Bioeng.36.11 (1990):1083-089.Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to other mechanical disruption methods the Microfluidizer breaks the cell membranes efficiently but gently, resulting in relatively large cell wall fragments (450&amp;nbsp;nm), and thus making it easier to separate the cell contents. This can lead to shorter filtration times and better centrifugation separation.&lt;ref&gt;Evaluation of the Microfluidizer for Cell Disruption of Yeast and Chlorella by E. Uera-Santos, C.D. Copple, EA Davis and WG. Hagar.&lt;/ref&gt;

Microfluidizer technology scales from one milliliter to thousands of liters.

==Nitrogen decompression==
For nitrogen decompression, large quantities of nitrogen are first dissolved in the cell under high pressure within a suitable [[pressure vessel]]. Then, when the gas pressure is suddenly released, the nitrogen comes out of the solution as expanding bubbles that stretch the membranes of each cell until they rupture and release the contents of the cell.

Nitrogen decompression is more protective of [[enzyme]]s and [[organelle]]s than [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]] and mechanical homogenizing methods and compares favorably to the controlled disruptive action obtained in a PTFE and glass mortar and pestle homogenizer.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} While other disruptive methods depend upon friction or a mechanical [[Shearing (physics)|shear]]ing action that generate heat, the nitrogen decompression procedure is accompanied by an adiabatic expansion that cools the sample instead of heating it.

The blanket of inert nitrogen gas that saturates the cell suspension and the homogenate offers protection against [[oxidation]] of cell components. Although other gases: [[carbon dioxide]], [[nitrous oxide]], [[carbon monoxide]] and compressed air have been used in this technique, [[nitrogen]] is preferred because of its non-reactive nature and because it does not alter the pH of the suspending medium. In addition, nitrogen is preferred because it is generally available at low cost and at pressures suitable for this procedure.

Once released, [[subcellular]] substances are not exposed to continued [[attrition (medicine, epidemiology)|attrition]] that might [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denature]] the sample or produce unwanted damage. There is no need to watch for a peak between enzyme activity and percent disruption. Since nitrogen bubbles are generated within each cell, the same disruptive force is applied uniformly throughout the sample, thus ensuring unusual uniformity in the product. Cell-free homogenates can be produced.

The technique is used to [[Homogenization (biology)|homogenize]] cells and tissues, release intact [[organelles]], prepare [[cell membrane]]s, release labile [[biochemical]]s, and produce uniform and repeatable homogenates without subjecting the sample to extreme chemical or physical stress.

The method is particularly well suited for treating [[mammalian]] and other membrane-bound cells.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} It has also been used successfully for treating [[plant cell]]s, for releasing virus from fertilized eggs and for treating fragile [[bacterium|bacteria]]. It is not recommended for untreated bacterial cells. [[Yeast]], [[fungus]], [[spores]] and other materials with tough cell walls do not respond well to this method.

The '''Chinese room argument''' holds that a program cannot give a computer a "[[mind]]", "[[intentionality|understanding]]" or "[[consciousness]]",{{efn|name=Consciousness}} regardless of how intelligently or human-like the program may make the computer behave.  The argument was first presented by philosopher [[John Searle]] in his paper, "Minds, Brains, and Programs", published in ''[[Behavioral and Brain Sciences]]'' in 1980. It has been widely discussed in the years since.{{sfn|Harnad|2001|p=1}} The centerpiece of the argument is a [[thought experiment]] known as the '''Chinese room'''.&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts|first1=Jacob|title=Thinking Machines: The Search for Artificial Intelligence|journal=Distillations |date=2016|volume=2|issue=2|pages=14–23|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/thinking-machines-the-search-for-artificial-intelligence|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument is directed against the philosophical positions of [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]] and [[computationalism]],{{sfn|Searle|1992|p=44}} which hold that the mind may be viewed as an information-processing system operating on formal symbols. Specifically, the argument is intended to refute a position Searle calls '''Strong AI''':
&lt;blockquote&gt;The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.{{efn|name="Strong AI"}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although it was originally presented in reaction to the statements of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) researchers, it is not an argument against the goals of AI research, because it does not limit the amount of intelligence a machine can display.{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}} The argument applies only to digital computers running programs and does not apply to machines in general.{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=11}}

==Chinese room thought experiment==
[[File:John searle2.jpg|thumb|John Searle in December 2005]]
Searle's [[thought experiment]] begins with this hypothetical premise: suppose that [[artificial intelligence]] research has succeeded in constructing a computer that behaves as if it understands [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. It takes [[Chinese character]]s as input and, by following the instructions of a [[computer program]], produces other Chinese characters, which it presents as output. Suppose, says Searle, that this computer performs its task so convincingly that it comfortably passes the [[Turing test]]: it convinces a human Chinese speaker that the program is itself a live Chinese speaker. To all of the questions that the person asks, it makes appropriate responses, such that any Chinese speaker would be convinced that they are talking to another Chinese-speaking human being.

The question Searle wants to answer is this: does the machine ''literally'' "understand" Chinese? Or is it merely ''simulating'' the ability to understand Chinese?{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=2}}{{efn|Searle writes that "according to Strong AI, the correct simulation really is a mind. According to Weak AI, the correct simulation is a model of the mind."{{sfn|Searle|2009|p=1}} He also writes:  "On the Strong AI view, the appropriately programmed computer does not just simulate having a mind; it literally has a mind."{{sfn|Searle|2004|p=66}}}} Searle calls the first position "[[#Strong AI|strong AI]]" and the latter "weak AI".{{efn|name="Strong AI in Searle (1980)" | 
Searle writes:  "Partisans of strong AI claim that in this question and answer sequence the machine is not only simulating a human ability but also (1) that the machine can literally be said to ''understand'' the story and provide the answers to questions, and (2) that what the machine and its program ''explains'' the human ability to understand the story and answer questions about it."{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=2}}
}}

Searle then supposes that he is in a closed room and has a book with an English version of the computer program, along with sufficient papers, pencils, erasers, and filing cabinets. Searle could receive Chinese characters through a slot in the door, process them according to the program's instructions, and produce Chinese characters as output. If the computer had passed the Turing test this way, it follows, says Searle, that he would do so as well, simply by running the program manually.

Searle asserts that there is no essential difference between the roles of the computer and himself in the experiment. Each simply follows a program, step-by-step, producing a behavior which is then interpreted by the user as demonstrating intelligent conversation. However, Searle himself would not be able to understand the conversation. ("I don't speak a word of Chinese,"{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=3}} he points out.)  Therefore, he argues, it follows that the computer would not be able to understand the conversation either.

Searle argues that, without "understanding" (or "[[intentionality]]"), we cannot describe what the machine is doing as "thinking" and, since it does not think, it does not have a "mind" in anything like the normal sense of the word. Therefore, he concludes that "strong AI" is false.

==History==
[[Gottfried Leibniz]] made a similar argument in 1714 against [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]] (the position that the mind is a machine and nothing more). Leibniz used the thought experiment of expanding the brain until it was the size of a [[mill (factory)|mill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|2004|loc=2.1}}, {{Harvnb|Leibniz|1714|loc=section 17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz found it difficult to imagine that a "mind" capable of "perception" could be constructed using only mechanical processes.{{efn|Note that Leibniz' was objecting to a "mechanical" theory of the mind (the philosophical position known as [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]].) Searle is objecting to an "information processing" view of the mind (the philosophical position known as "[[computationalism]]"). Searle accepts mechanism and rejects computationalism.}} In 1974, [[Lawrence Davis]] imagined duplicating the brain using telephone lines and offices staffed by people, and in 1978 [[Ned Block]] envisioned the entire population of China involved in such a brain simulation. This thought experiment is called the [[China brain]], also the "Chinese Nation" or the "Chinese Gym".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|2004|loc=2.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese Room Argument was introduced in Searle's 1980 paper "Minds, Brains, and Programs", published in ''[[Behavioral and Brain Sciences]]''.{{sfn|Searle|1980}} It eventually became the journal's "most influential target article",{{sfn|Harnad|2001|p=1}} generating an enormous number of commentaries and responses in the ensuing decades, and Searle has continued to defend and refine the argument in many papers, popular articles and books. David Cole writes that "the Chinese Room argument has probably been the most widely discussed philosophical argument in cognitive science to appear in the past 25 years".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cole|2004|p=2}}; {{harvnb|Preston|Bishop|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the discussion consists of attempts to refute it. "The overwhelming majority", notes ''[[Behavioral and Brain Sciences|BBS]]'' editor [[Stevan Harnad]],{{efn|[[Stevan Harnad|Harnad]] edited ''BBS'' during the years which saw the introduction and popularisation of the Chinese Room argument.}} "still think that the Chinese Room Argument is dead wrong".{{sfn|Harnad|2001|p=2}} The sheer volume of the literature that has grown up around it inspired [[Patrick J. Hayes|Pat Hayes]] to comment that the field of [[cognitive science]] ought to be redefined as "the ongoing research program of showing Searle's Chinese Room Argument to be false".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harnad|2001|p=1}}; {{harvnb|Cole|2004|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Searle's argument has become "something of a classic in cognitive science", according to Harnad.{{sfn|Harnad|2001|p=2}} [[Varol Akman]] agrees, and has described the original paper as "an exemplar of philosophical clarity and purity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author-link=Varol Akman |last=Akman |first=Varol |year=1998 |title=Book Review — ''John Haugeland (editor), Mind Design II: Philosophy, Psychology, and Artificial Intelligence'' [Journal (Paginated)] |url=http://cogprints.org/539/index.html |access-date=2018-10-02 |via=Cogprints}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Although the Chinese Room argument was originally presented in reaction to the statements of [[artificial intelligence|AI]] researchers, philosophers have come to view it as an important part of the [[philosophy of mind]]. It is a challenge to [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]] and the [[computational theory of mind]],{{efn|name=Computationalism|[[Stevan Harnad]] holds that the Searle's argument is against the thesis that "has since come to be called 'computationalism,' according to which cognition is just computation, hence mental states are just computational states".{{sfn|Harnad|2005|p=1}} David Cole agrees that "the argument also has broad implications for functionalist and computational theories of meaning and of mind".{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=1}}}} and is related to such questions as the [[mind–body problem]], the [[problem of other minds]], the [[symbol grounding|symbol-grounding]] problem, and the [[hard problem of consciousness]].{{efn|name=Consciousness}}

===Strong AI===&lt;!--This section title is linked to from several places --&gt;
[[John Searle|Searle]] identified a [[philosophical position]] he calls "strong AI":
&lt;blockquote&gt;The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.{{efn|name="Strong AI"|This version is from Searle's ''Mind, Language and Society''{{sfn|Searle|1999|p={{Page needed|date=February 2012}}}} and is also quoted in [[Daniel Dennett]]'s ''[[Consciousness Explained]]''.{{sfn|Dennett|1991|p=435}} Searle's original formulation was "The appropriately programmed computer really is a mind, in the sense that computers given the right programs can be literally said to understand and have other cognitive states."{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=1}} Strong AI is defined similarly by [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig]]: "The assertion that machines could possibly act intelligently (or, perhaps better, act as if they were intelligent) is called the 'weak AI' hypothesis by philosophers, and the assertion that machines that do so are actually thinking (as opposed to simulating thinking) is called the 'strong AI' hypothesis."{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The definition hinges on the distinction between ''simulating'' a mind and ''actually having'' a mind. Searle writes that "according to Strong AI, the correct simulation really is a mind. According to Weak AI, the correct simulation is a model of the mind."{{sfn|Searle|2009|p=1}}

The position is implicit in some of the statements of early AI researchers and analysts. For example, in 1955, AI founder [[Herbert A. Simon]] declared that "there are now in the world machines that think, that learn and create"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Simon, together with [[Allen Newell]] and [[Cliff Shaw]], had just completed the first "AI" program, the [[Logic Theorist]].}} and claimed that they had "solved the venerable [[mind–body problem]], explaining how a system composed of matter can have the properties of [[mind]]."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=46}} and {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=17}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Haugeland]] wrote that "AI wants only the genuine article: ''machines with minds'', in the full and literal sense. This is not science fiction, but real science, based on a theoretical conception as deep as it is daring: namely, we are, at root, ''computers ourselves''."{{sfn|Haugeland|1985|p=2|ps=(Italics his).}}

Searle also ascribes the following positions to advocates of strong AI:
* AI systems can be used to explain the mind;{{efn|name="Strong AI in Searle (1980)"}}
* The study of the brain is irrelevant to the study of the mind;{{efn|Searle believes that "strong AI only makes sense given the dualistic assumption that, where the mind is concerned, the brain doesn't matter." {{sfn|Searle|1980|p=13}} He writes elsewhere, "I thought the whole idea of strong AI was that we don't need to know how the brain works to know how the mind works." {{sfn|Searle|1980|p=8}} This position owes its phrasing to Stevan Harnad.{{sfn|Harnad|2001}}}} and
* The [[Turing test]] is adequate for establishing the existence of mental states.{{efn|"One of the points at issue," writes Searle, "is the adequacy of the Turing test."{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=6}}}}

===Strong AI as computationalism or functionalism===
In more recent presentations of the Chinese room argument, Searle has identified "strong AI" as "computer [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]]" (a term he attributes to [[Daniel Dennett]]).{{sfn|Searle|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Searle|2004|p=45}} Functionalism is a position in modern [[philosophy of mind]] that holds that we can define mental phenomena (such as beliefs, desires, and perceptions) by describing their functions in relation to each other and to the outside world. Because a computer program can accurately represent functional relationships as relationships between symbols, a computer can have mental phenomena if it runs the right program, according to functionalism.

[[Stevan Harnad]] argues that Searle's depictions of strong AI can be reformulated as "recognizable tenets of ''computationalism'', a position (unlike "strong AI") that is actually held by many thinkers, and hence one worth refuting."{{sfn|Harnad|2001|loc=p. 3 (Italics his)}} [[Computationalism]]{{efn|[[Computationalism]] is associated with [[Jerry Fodor]] and [[Hilary Putnam]],{{sfn|Horst|2005|p=1}} and is held by [[Allen Newell]],{{sfn|Harnad|2001}} [[Zenon Pylyshyn]]{{sfn|Harnad|2001}} and [[Steven Pinker]],{{sfn|Pinker|1997}} among others.}} is the position in the philosophy of mind which argues that the [[mind]] can be accurately described as an [[information processing|information-processing]] system.

Each of the following, according to Harnad, is a "tenet" of computationalism:{{sfn|Harnad|2001|pp=3–5}}
* Mental states are computational states (which is why computers can have mental states and help to explain the mind);
* Computational states are [[multiple realizability|implementation-independent]]—in other words, it is the software that determines the computational state, not the hardware (which is why the brain, being hardware, is irrelevant); and that
* Since implementation is unimportant, the only empirical data that matters is how the system functions; hence the [[Turing test]] is definitive.

===Strong AI vs. biological naturalism===

Searle holds a philosophical position he calls "[[biological naturalism]]": that [[consciousness]]{{efn|name=Consciousness}} and [[intentionality|understanding]] require specific biological machinery that are found in brains. He writes "brains cause minds"{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=11}} and that "actual human mental phenomena [are] dependent on actual physical–chemical properties of actual human brains".{{sfn|Searle|1990|p=29}} Searle argues that this machinery (known to [[neuroscience]] as the "[[neural correlates of consciousness]]") must have some (unspecified) "causal powers" that permit the human experience of consciousness.{{sfn|Searle|1990}} Searle's faith in the existence of these powers has been criticized.{{efn|See the replies to Searle under [[#Other minds and zombies: meaninglessness|Meaninglessness]], below}}

Searle does not disagree with the notion that machines can have consciousness and understanding, because, as he writes, "we are precisely such machines".{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=11}} Searle holds that the brain is, in fact, a machine, but that the brain gives rise to consciousness and understanding using machinery that is non-computational. If neuroscience is able to isolate the mechanical process that gives rise to consciousness, then Searle grants that it may be possible to create machines that have consciousness and understanding. However, without the specific machinery required, Searle does not believe that consciousness can occur.

Biological naturalism implies that one cannot determine if the experience of consciousness is occurring merely by examining how a system functions, because the specific machinery of the brain is essential. Thus, biological naturalism is directly opposed to both [[behaviorism]] and [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]] (including "computer functionalism" or "strong AI").{{sfn|Hauser|2006|p=8}} Biological naturalism is similar to [[identity theory of mind|identity theory]] (the position that mental states are "identical to" or "composed of" neurological events);  however, Searle has specific technical objections to identity theory.{{sfn|Searle|1992|loc=chpt. 5}}{{efn|Larry Hauser writes that "biological naturalism is either confused (waffling between identity theory and dualism) or else it ''just is'' identity theory or dualism."{{sfn|Hauser|2006|p=8}}}} Searle's biological naturalism and strong AI are both opposed to [[Cartesian dualism]],{{sfn|Hauser|2006|p=8}} the classical idea that the brain and mind are made of different "substances". Indeed, Searle accuses strong AI of dualism, writing that "strong AI only makes sense given the dualistic assumption that, where the mind is concerned, the brain doesn't matter."{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=13}}

===Consciousness===
Searle's original presentation emphasized "understanding"—that is, mental states with what philosophers call "[[intentionality]]"—and did not directly address other closely related ideas such as "consciousness". However, in more recent presentations Searle has included consciousness as the real target of the argument.{{sfn|Searle|1992|p=44}}
{{quote|Computational models of consciousness are not sufficient by themselves for consciousness. The computational model for consciousness stands to consciousness in the same way the computational model of anything stands to the domain being modelled. Nobody supposes that the computational model of rainstorms in London will leave us all wet. But they make the mistake of supposing that the computational model of consciousness is somehow conscious. It is the same mistake in both cases.{{sfn|Searle|2002}}|John R. Searle| Consciousness and Language, p. 16}}
[[David Chalmers]] writes "it is fairly clear that consciousness is at the root of the matter" of the Chinese room.{{sfn|Chalmers|1996|p=322}}

[[Colin McGinn]] argues that the Chinese room provides strong evidence that the [[hard problem of consciousness]] is fundamentally insoluble. The argument, to be clear, is not about whether a machine can be conscious, but about whether it (or anything else for that matter) can be shown to be conscious. It is plain that any other method of probing the occupant of a Chinese room has the same difficulties in principle as exchanging questions and answers in Chinese. It is simply not possible to divine whether a conscious agency or some clever simulation inhabits the room.{{sfn|McGinn|2000}}

Searle argues that this is only true for an observer ''outside'' of the room. The whole point of the thought experiment is to put someone ''inside'' the room, where they can directly observe the operations of consciousness. Searle claims that from his vantage point within the room there is nothing he can see that could imaginably give rise to consciousness, other than himself, and clearly he does not have a mind that can speak Chinese.

===Applied ethics===

[[File:USS Vincennes (CG-49) Aegis large screen displays.jpg|thumb|right|Sitting in the [[Operations room|Combat Information Center]] aboard [[USS Vincennes (CG-49)|a warship]] – proposed as a real-life analog to the Chinese Room]]

Patrick Hew used the Chinese Room argument to deduce requirements from military [[command and control]] systems if they are to preserve a commander's [[moral agency]]. He drew an analogy between a commander in their [[Operations room|command center]] and the person in the Chinese Room, and analyzed it under a reading of [[Nicomachean Ethics|Aristotle’s notions of "compulsory" and "ignorance"]]. Information could be "down converted" from meaning to symbols, and manipulated symbolically, but moral agency could be undermined if there was inadequate 'up conversion' into meaning. Hew cited examples from the [[Iran Air Flight 655|USS ''Vincennes'' incident]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hew|first1=Patrick Chisan|title=Preserving a combat commander's moral agency: The Vincennes Incident as a Chinese Room|journal=Ethics and Information Technology|date=September 2016|volume=18|issue=3|pages=227–235 |doi=10.1007/s10676-016-9408-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer science==
The Chinese room argument is primarily an argument in the [[philosophy of mind]], and both major computer scientists and artificial intelligence researchers consider it irrelevant to their fields.{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}} However, several concepts developed by computer scientists are essential to understanding the argument, including [[physical symbol system|symbol processing]], [[Turing machine]]s, [[Turing completeness]], and the [[Turing test]].

===Strong AI vs. AI research===
Searle's arguments are not usually considered an issue for AI research. [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig]] observe that most AI researchers "don't care about the strong AI hypothesis—as long as the program works, they don't care whether you call it a simulation of intelligence or real intelligence."{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}} The primary mission of [[artificial intelligence]] research is only to create useful systems that ''act'' intelligently, and it does not matter if the intelligence is "merely" a simulation.

Searle does not disagree that AI research can create machines that are capable of highly intelligent behavior. The Chinese room argument leaves open the possibility that a digital machine could be built that ''acts'' more intelligently than a person, but does not have a [[mind]] or [[intentionality]] in the same way that [[Human brain|brains]] do. The Chinese room argument is not a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'', rather it is an example that requires explanation. 

Searle's "strong AI" should not be confused with "[[artificial general intelligence|strong AI]]" as defined by [[Ray Kurzweil]] and other futurists,{{sfn|Kurzweil|2005|p=260}} who use the term to describe machine intelligence that rivals or exceeds human intelligence. Kurzweil is concerned primarily with the ''amount'' of intelligence displayed by the machine, whereas Searle's argument sets no limit on this. Searle argues that even a super-intelligent machine would not necessarily have a mind and consciousness.

===Turing test===
{{main article|Turing test}}
[[File:Turing Test version 3.png|thumb|The "standard interpretation" of the Turing Test, in which player C, the interrogator, is given the task of trying to determine which player – A or B – is a computer and which is a human. The interrogator is limited to using the responses to written questions to make the determination. Image adapted from Saygin, 2000.{{sfn|Saygin|2000}}]]
The Chinese room implements a version of the [[Turing test]].{{sfn|Turing|1950}} [[Alan Turing]] introduced the test in 1950 to help answer the question "can machines think?" In the standard version, a human judge engages in a natural language conversation with a human and a machine designed to generate performance indistinguishable from that of a human being. All participants are separated from one another. If the judge cannot reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the test.

Turing then considered each possible objection to the proposal "machines can think", and found that there are simple, obvious answers if the question is de-mystified in this way. He did not, however, intend for the test to measure for the presence of "consciousness" or "understanding". He did not believe this was relevant to the issues that he was addressing. He wrote:
{{quote|I do not wish to give the impression that I think there is no mystery about consciousness. There is, for instance, something of a paradox connected with any attempt to localise it. But I do not think these mysteries necessarily need to be solved before we can answer the question with which we are concerned in this paper.{{sfn|Turing|1950}}}}

To Searle, as a philosopher investigating in the nature of [[philosophy of mind|mind]] and [[consciousness]], these are the relevant mysteries. The Chinese room is designed to show that the Turing test is insufficient to detect the presence of consciousness, even if the room can [[behaviourism|behave]] or [[functionalism (philosophy)|function]] as a conscious mind would.

===Symbol processing===
{{Main article|Physical symbol system}}
The Chinese room (and all modern computers) manipulate physical objects in order to carry out calculations and do simulations. AI researchers [[Allen Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon]] called this kind of machine a [[physical symbol system]]. It is also equivalent to the [[formal system]]s used in the field of [[mathematical logic]].

Searle emphasizes the fact that this kind of symbol manipulation is [[syntax|syntactic]] (borrowing a term from the study of [[grammar]]). The computer manipulates the symbols using a form of [[syntax|syntax rules]], without any knowledge of the symbol's [[semantics]] (that is, their [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]]).

Newell and Simon had conjectured that a physical symbol system (such as a digital computer) had all the necessary machinery for "general intelligent action", or, as it is known today, [[artificial general intelligence]]. They framed this as a philosophical position, the [[physical symbol system|physical symbol system hypothesis]]: "A physical symbol system has the [[sufficient|necessary and sufficient means]] for general intelligent action."{{sfn|Newell|Simon|1976|p=116}}{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=18}} The Chinese room argument does not refute this, because it is framed in terms of "intelligent action", i.e. the external behavior of the machine, rather than the presence or absence of understanding, consciousness and mind.

===Chinese room and Turing completeness===
{{See also|Turing completeness|Church–Turing thesis}}
The Chinese room has a design analogous to that of a modern computer. It has a [[Von Neumann architecture]], which consists of a program (the book of instructions), some memory (the papers and file cabinets), a [[central processing unit|CPU]] which follows the instructions (the man), and a means to write symbols in memory (the pencil and eraser). A machine with this design is known in [[theoretical computer science]] as "[[Turing complete]]", because it has the necessary machinery to carry out any computation that a [[Turing machine]] can do, and therefore it is capable of doing a step-by-step simulation of any other digital machine, given enough memory and time. [[Alan Turing]] writes, "all digital computers are in a sense equivalent."{{sfn|Turing|1950|p=442}} The widely accepted [[Church–Turing thesis]] holds that any function computable by an effective procedure is computable by a Turing machine.

The Turing completeness of the Chinese room implies that it can do whatever any other digital computer can do (albeit much, much more slowly). Thus, if the Chinese room does not or can not contain a Chinese-speaking mind, then no other digital computer can contain a mind. Some replies to Searle begin by arguing that the room, as described, cannot have a Chinese-speaking mind. Arguments of this form, according to [[Stevan Harnad]], are "no refutation (but rather an affirmation)"{{sfn|Harnad|2001|p=14}} of the Chinese room argument, because these arguments actually imply that ''no'' digital computers can have a mind.{{sfn|Harnad|2001}}

There are some critics, such as Hanoch Ben-Yami, who argue that the Chinese room cannot simulate all the abilities of a digital computer, such as being able to determine the current time.{{sfn|Ben-Yami|1993}}

==Complete argument==
Searle has produced a more formal version of the argument of which the Chinese Room forms a part. He presented the first version in 1984. The version given below is from 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1984}}; {{Harvnb|Searle|1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The wording of each axiom and conclusion are from Searle's presentation in ''[[Scientific American]]''.{{sfn|Searle|1990}}{{sfn|Hauser|2006|p=5}} (A1-3) and (C1) are described as 1,2,3 and 4 in David Cole.{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=5}}}} The only part of the argument which should be controversial is A3 and it is this point which the Chinese room thought experiment is intended to prove.{{efn|Paul and Patricia Churchland write that the Chinese room thought experiment is intended to "shore up axiom 3".{{sfn|Churchland|Churchland|1990|p=34}}}}

He begins with three axioms:
:(A1) "Programs are formal ([[syntax|syntactic]])."
::A program uses [[syntax]] to manipulate symbols and pays no attention to the [[semantics]] of the symbols. It knows where to put the symbols and how to move them around, but it doesn't know what they stand for or what they mean. For the program, the symbols are just physical objects like any others.

:(A2) "Minds have mental contents ([[semantics]])."
::Unlike the symbols used by a program, our thoughts have meaning: they represent things and we know what it is they represent.

:(A3) "Syntax by itself is neither constitutive of nor sufficient for semantics."
::This is what the Chinese room thought experiment is intended to prove: the Chinese room has syntax (because there is a man in there moving symbols around). The Chinese room has no semantics (because, according to Searle, there is no one or nothing in the room that understands what the symbols mean). Therefore, having syntax is not enough to generate semantics.

Searle posits that these lead directly to this conclusion:

:(C1) Programs are neither constitutive of nor sufficient for minds.
::This should follow without controversy from the first three: Programs don't have semantics. Programs have only syntax, and syntax is insufficient for semantics. Every mind has semantics. Therefore no programs are minds.

This much of the argument is intended to show that [[artificial intelligence]] can never produce a machine with a mind by writing programs that manipulate symbols. The remainder of the argument addresses a different issue. Is the human brain running a program? In other words, is the [[computational theory of mind]] correct?{{efn|name=Computationalism}} He begins with an axiom that is intended to express the basic modern scientific consensus about brains and minds:

:(A4) Brains cause minds.

Searle claims that we can derive "immediately" and "trivially"{{sfn|Searle|1990}} that:

:(C2) Any other system capable of causing minds would have to have causal powers (at least) equivalent to those of brains.
::Brains must have something that causes a mind to exist. Science has yet to determine exactly what it is, but it must exist, because minds exist. Searle calls it "causal powers". "Causal powers" is whatever the brain uses to create a mind. If anything else can cause a mind to exist, it must have "equivalent causal powers". "Equivalent causal powers" is whatever ''else'' that could be used to make a mind.

And from this he derives the further conclusions:

:(C3) Any artifact that produced mental phenomena, any artificial brain, would have to be able to duplicate the specific causal powers of brains, and it could not do that just by running a formal program.
::This [[Logical consequence|follows from]] C1 and C2: Since no program can produce a mind, and "equivalent causal powers" produce minds, it follows that programs do not have "equivalent causal powers."

:(C4) The way that human brains actually produce mental phenomena cannot be solely by virtue of running a computer program.
::Since programs do not have "equivalent causal powers", "equivalent causal powers" produce minds, and brains produce minds, it follows that brains do not use programs to produce minds.

==Replies==
Replies to Searle's argument may be classified according to what they claim to show:{{efn|David Cole combines the second and third categories, as well as the fourth and fifth.{{sfn|Cole|2004|pp=5–6}}}}
* Those which identify ''who'' speaks Chinese
* Those which demonstrate how meaningless symbols can become meaningful
* Those which suggest that the Chinese room should be redesigned in some way
* Those which contend that Searle's argument is misleading
* Those which argue that the argument makes false assumptions about subjective conscious experience and therefore proves nothing

Some of the arguments (robot and brain simulation, for example) fall into multiple categories.

===Systems and virtual mind replies: finding the mind===
These replies attempt to answer the question: since the man in the room doesn't speak Chinese, ''where'' is the "mind" that does? These replies address the key [[ontological]] issues of [[mind/body problem|mind vs. body]] and simulation vs. reality. All of the replies that identify the mind in the room are versions of "the system reply".

;System reply:The basic version argues that it is the "whole system" that understands Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980|pp=5–6}}; {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|pp=6–7}}; {{Harvnb|Hauser|2006|pp=2–3}}; {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=959}}, {{Harvnb|Dennett|1991|p=439}}; {{Harvnb|Fearn|2007|p=44}}; {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=269}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|This position is held by  [[Ned Block]], [[Jack Copeland]], [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Jerry Fodor]], [[John Haugeland]], [[Ray Kurzweil]], and [[Georges Rey]], among others.{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=6}}}}  While the man understands only English, when he is combined with the program, scratch paper, pencils and file cabinets, they form a system that can understand Chinese. "Here, understanding is not being ascribed to the mere individual; rather it is being ascribed to this whole system of which he is a part" Searle explains.{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=6}} The fact that man does not understand Chinese is irrelevant, because it is only the system as a whole that matters.

Searle notes that (in this simple version of the reply) the "system" is nothing more than a collection of ordinary physical objects; it grants the power of understanding and consciousness to "the conjunction of that person and bits of paper"{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=6}} without making any effort to explain how this pile of objects has become a conscious, thinking being. Searle argues that no reasonable person should be satisfied with the reply, unless they are "under the grip of an ideology;"{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=6}} In order for this reply to be remotely plausible, one must take it for granted that consciousness can be the product of an information processing "system", and does not require anything resembling the actual biology of the brain.

Searle then responds by simplifying this list of physical objects: he asks what happens if the man memorizes the rules and keeps track of everything in his head? Then the whole system consists of just one object: the man himself. Searle argues that if the man doesn't understand Chinese then the system doesn't understand Chinese either because now "the system" and "the man" both describe exactly the same object.{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=6}} 

Critics of Searle's response argue that the program has allowed the man to have two minds in one head.{{who|date=March 2011}} If we assume a "mind" is a form of information processing, then the [[theory of computation]] can account for two computations occurring at once, namely (1) the computation for [[Universal Turing machine|universal programmability]] (which is the function instantiated by the person and note-taking materials ''independently'' from any particular program contents) and (2) the computation of the Turing machine that is described by the program (which is instantiated by everything ''including'' the specific program).{{sfn|Yee|1993|p=44|footnote=2}} The theory of computation thus formally explains the open possibility that the second computation in the Chinese Room could entail a human-equivalent semantic understanding of the Chinese inputs. The focus belongs on the program's Turing machine rather than on the person's.{{sfn|Yee|1993|pp=42–47}} However, from Searle's perspective, this argument is circular. The question at issue is whether consciousness is a form of information processing, and this reply requires that we make that assumption.

More sophisticated versions of the systems reply try to identify more precisely what "the system" is and they differ in exactly how they describe it. According to these replies,{{who|date=March 2011}} the "mind that speaks Chinese" could be such things as: the "software", a "program", a "running program", a simulation of the "neural correlates of consciousness", the "functional system", a "simulated mind", an "[[strong emergence|emergent]] property", or "a [[virtual artifact|virtual]] mind" ([[Marvin Minsky]]'s version of the systems reply, described below).

;Virtual mind reply:The term "[[virtual artifact|virtual]]" is used in computer science to describe an object that appears to exist "in" a computer (or computer network) only because software makes it appear to exist. The objects "inside" computers (including files, folders, and so on) are all "virtual", except for the computer's electronic components. Similarly, [[Marvin Minsky|Minsky]] argues, a computer may contain a "mind" that is virtual in the same sense as [[virtual machine]]s, [[virtual community|virtual communities]] and [[virtual reality]].{{efn|The virtual mind reply is held by [[Marvin Minsky]], [[Tim Maudlin]], [[David Chalmers]] and David Cole.{{sfn|Cole|2004|pp=7–9}} The reply was introduced by [[Marvin Minsky]].{{sfn|Minsky|1980|p=440}}{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=7}}}}

:To clarify the distinction between the simple systems reply given above and virtual mind reply, David Cole notes that two simulations could be running on one system at the same time: one speaking Chinese and one speaking Korean. While there is only one system, there can be multiple "virtual minds," thus the "system" cannot be the "mind".{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=8}}

Searle responds that such a mind is, at best, a simulation, and writes: "No one supposes that computer simulations of a five-alarm fire will burn the neighborhood down or that a computer simulation of a rainstorm will leave us all drenched."{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=12}} Nicholas Fearn responds that, for some things, simulation is as good as the real thing. "When we call up the pocket calculator function on a desktop computer, the image of a pocket calculator appears on the screen. We don't complain that 'it isn't ''really'' a calculator', because the physical attributes of the device do not matter."{{sfn|Fearn|2007|p=47}} The question is, is the human mind like the pocket calculator, essentially composed of information? Or is the mind like the rainstorm, something other than a computer, and not realizable in full by a computer simulation? (The issue of simulation is also discussed in the article [[synthetic intelligence]].)

These replies provide an explanation of exactly who it is that understands Chinese. If there is something ''besides'' the man in the room that can understand Chinese, Searle can't argue that (1) the man doesn't understand Chinese, therefore (2) nothing in the room understands Chinese. This, according to those who make this reply, shows that Searle's argument fails to prove that "strong AI" is false.{{efn|David Cole writes "From the intuition that in the CR thought experiment he would not understand Chinese by running a program, Searle infers that there is no understanding created by running a program. Clearly, whether that inference is valid or not turns on a metaphysical question about the identity of persons and minds. If the person understanding is not identical with the room operator, then the inference is unsound."{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=21}}}}

However, the thought experiment is not intended to be a reduction ad absurdum, but rather an example that requires explanation. Searle is not asserting that the situation is impossible, but rather that it is difficult or impossible to explain how this system can have subjection conscious experience.{{sfn|Searle|2004|p=63|quote="the Chinese room argument ... assumes complete success on the part of artificial intelligence in simulating human cognition."}} The system reply succeeds in showing that it is ''not impossible'' but fails to show how the system would have consciousness; the replies, by themselves, provide no evidence that the system (or the virtual mind) understands Chinese, other than the [[hypothetical]] premise that it passes the [[Turing Test]]. As Searle writes "the systems reply simply begs the question by insisting that the system must understand Chinese."{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=6}}

===Robot and semantics replies: finding the meaning===
As far as the person in the room is concerned, the symbols are just meaningless "squiggles." But if the Chinese room really "understands" what it is saying, then the symbols must get their meaning from somewhere. These arguments attempt to connect the symbols to the things they symbolize. These replies address Searle's concerns about [[intentionality]], [[symbol grounding]] and [[syntax]] vs. [[semantic]]s.

;Robot reply:Suppose that instead of a room, the program was placed into a robot that could wander around and interact with its environment. This would allow a "[[causality|causal]] connection" between the symbols and things they represent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980|p=7}}; {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|pp=9–11}}; {{Harvnb|Hauser|2006|p=3}}; {{Harvnb|Fearn|2007|p=44}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|This position is held by [[Margaret Boden]], [[Tim Crane]], [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Jerry Fodor]], [[Stevan Harnad]], [[Hans Moravec]], and [[Georges Rey]], among others.{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=9}}}} [[Hans Moravec]] comments: "If we could graft a robot to a reasoning program, we wouldn't need a person to provide the meaning anymore: it would come from the physical world."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn| David Cole calls this the "externalist" account of meaning.{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=18}}}}

:Searle's reply is to suppose that, unbeknownst to the individual in the Chinese room, some of the inputs came directly from a camera mounted on a robot, and some of the outputs were used to manipulate the arms and legs of the robot. Nevertheless, the person in the room is still just following the rules, and ''does not know what the symbols mean.'' Searle writes "he doesn't ''see'' what comes into the robot's eyes."{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=7}} (See [[Mary's room]] for a similar thought experiment.)

;Derived meaning: Some respond that the room, as Searle describes it, ''is'' connected to the world: through the Chinese speakers that it is "talking" to and through the programmers who designed the [[knowledge base]] in his file cabinet. The symbols Searle manipulates ''are already meaningful'', they're just not meaningful to ''him''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hauser|2006|p=11}}; {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The derived meaning reply is associated with [[Daniel Dennett]] and others.}}

:Searle says that the symbols only have a "derived" meaning, like the meaning of words in books. The meaning of the symbols depends on the conscious understanding of the Chinese speakers and the programmers outside the room. The room, like a book, has no understanding of its own.{{efn|Searle distinguishes between "intrinsic" intentionality and "derived" intentionality. "Intrinsic" intentionality is the kind that involves "conscious understanding" like you would have in a human mind. [[Daniel Dennett]] doesn't agree that there is a distinction. David Cole writes "derived intentionality is all there is, according to Dennett."{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=19}}}}

;Commonsense knowledge / contextualist reply:Some have argued that the meanings of the symbols would come from a vast "background" of [[commonsense knowledge]] encoded in the program and the filing cabinets. This would provide a "[[contextualism|context]]" that would give the symbols their meaning.{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=18}}{{efn|David Cole describes this as the "internalist" approach to meaning.{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=18}} Proponents of this position include [[Roger Schank]], [[Doug Lenat]], [[Marvin Minsky]] and (with reservations) [[Daniel Dennett]], who writes "The fact is that any program [that passed a Turing test] would have to be an extraordinarily supple, sophisticated, and multilayered system, brimming with 'world knowledge' and meta-knowledge and meta-meta-knowledge." {{sfn|Dennett|1991|p=438}}}}

:Searle agrees that this background exists, but he does not agree that it can be built into programs. [[Hubert Dreyfus]] has also criticized the idea that the "background" can be represented symbolically.{{sfn|Dreyfus|1979|loc="The [[epistemological]] assumption"}}

To each of these suggestions, Searle's response is the same: no matter how much knowledge is written into the program and no matter how the program is connected to the world, he is still in the room manipulating symbols according to rules. His actions are [[syntax|syntactic]] and this can never explain to him what the symbols stand for. Searle writes "syntax is insufficient for semantics."{{sfn|Searle|1984}}{{efn|Searle also writes "Formal symbols by themselves can never be enough for mental contents, because the symbols, by definition, have no meaning (or [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]], or semantics) except insofar as someone outside the system gives it to them."{{sfn|Motzkin|Searle|1989|p=45}}}}

However, for those who accept that Searle's actions simulate a mind, separate from his own, the important question is not what the symbols mean ''to Searle'', what is important is what they mean ''to the virtual mind.'' While Searle is trapped in the room, the virtual mind is not: it is connected to the outside world through the Chinese speakers it speaks to, through the programmers who gave it world knowledge, and through the cameras and other sensors that [[roboticist]]s can supply.

===Brain simulation and connectionist replies: redesigning the room===
These arguments are all versions of the systems reply that identify a particular ''kind'' of system as being important; they identify some special technology that would create conscious understanding in a machine. (Note that the "robot" and "commonsense knowledge" replies above also specify a certain kind of system as being important.)

;Brain simulator reply:Suppose that the program simulated in fine detail the action of every neuron in the brain of a Chinese speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980|pp=7–8}}; {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|pp=12–13}}; {{Harvnb|Hauser|2006|pp=3–4}}; {{Harvnb|Churchland|Churchland|1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The brain simulation replay has been made by [[Paul Churchland]], [[Patricia Churchland]] and [[Ray Kurzweil]].{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=12}}}} This strengthens the intuition that there would be no significant difference between the operation of the program and the operation of a live human brain.

:Searle replies that such a simulation does not reproduce the important features of the brain—its causal and intentional states. [[John Searle|Searle]] is adamant that "human mental phenomena [are] dependent on actual physical–chemical properties of actual human brains."{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=13}} Moreover, he argues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[I]magine that instead of a monolingual man in a room shuffling symbols we have the man operate an elaborate set of water pipes with valves connecting them. When the man receives the Chinese symbols, he looks up in the program, written in English, which valves he has to turn on and off. Each water connection corresponds to a synapse in the Chinese brain, and the whole system is rigged up so that after doing all the right firings, that is after turning on all the right faucets, the Chinese answers pop out at the output end of the series of pipes.

Now where is the understanding in this system? It takes Chinese as input, it simulates the formal structure of the synapses of the Chinese brain, and it gives Chinese as output. But the man certainly doesn't understand Chinese, and neither do the water pipes, and if we are tempted to adopt what I think is the absurd view that somehow the conjunction of man and water pipes understands, remember that in principle the man can internalize the formal structure of the water pipes and do all the "neuron firings" in his imagination.{{sfn|Searle|1980}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

:Two variations on the brain simulator reply are:
:;[[China brain]]:What if we ask each citizen of China to simulate one neuron, using the telephone system to simulate the connections between [[axon]]s and [[dendrite]]s? In this version, it seems obvious that no individual would have any understanding of what the brain might be saying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|2004|p=4}}; {{Harvnb|Hauser|2006|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Early versions of this argument were put forward in 1974 by [[Lawrence Davis]] and in 1978 by [[Ned Block]]. Block's version used walkie talkies and was called the "Chinese Gym". Paul and Patricia Churchland described this scenario as well.{{sfn|Churchland|Churchland|1990}}}} It is also obvious that this system would be functionally equivalent to a brain, so if consciousness is a function, this system would be conscious.

:;Brain replacement scenario:In this, we are asked to imagine that engineers have invented a tiny computer that simulates the action of an individual neuron. What would happen if we replaced one neuron at a time? Replacing one would clearly do nothing to change conscious awareness. Replacing all of them would create a digital computer that simulates a brain. If Searle is right, then conscious awareness must disappear during the procedure (either gradually or all at once). Searle's critics argue that there would be no point during the procedure when he can claim that conscious awareness ends and mindless simulation begins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=956–8}}; {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|p=20}}; {{Harvnb|Moravec|1988}}; {{Harvnb|Kurzweil|2005|p=262}}; {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=271 and 279}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|An early version of the brain replacement scenario was put forward by [[Clark Glymour]] in the mid-70s and was touched on by [[Zenon Pylyshyn]] in 1980. [[Hans Moravec]] presented a vivid version of it,{{sfn|Moravec|1988}} and it is now associated with [[Ray Kurzweil]]'s version of [[transhumanism]].}} Searle predicts that, while going through the brain prosthesis, "you find, to your total amazement, that you are indeed losing control of your external behavior. You find, for example, that when doctors test your vision, you hear them say 'We are holding up a red object in front of you; please tell us what you see.' You want to cry out 'I can't see anything. I'm going totally blind.' But you hear your voice saying in a way that is completely outside of your control, 'I see a red object in front of me.' [...] [Y]our conscious experience slowly shrinks to nothing, while your externally observable behavior remains the same."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1992}} quoted in {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=957}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Ship of Theseus]] for a similar thought experiment.)
 
;Connectionist replies:Closely related to the brain simulator reply, this claims that a massively parallel connectionist architecture would be capable of understanding.{{efn|The connectionist reply is made by [[Andy Clark]] and [[Ray Kurzweil]],{{sfn|Cole|2004|pp=12 &amp; 17}} as well as [[Paul Churchland|Paul]] and [[Patricia Churchland]].{{sfn|Hauser|2006|p=7}}}}

;Combination reply:This response combines the robot reply with the brain simulation reply, arguing that a brain simulation connected to the world through a robot body could have a mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980|pp=8–9}}; {{Harvnb|Hauser|2006|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Many mansions/Wait till next year reply:Better technology in the future will allow computers to understand.{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=8}}{{efn|{{harvtxt|Searle|2009}} uses the name "Wait 'Til Next Year Reply".}} Searle agrees that this is possible, but considers this point irrelevant. His argument is that a machine using a program to manipulate formally defined elements can not produce understanding. Searle's argument, if correct, rules out only this particular design. Searle agrees that there may be other designs that would cause a machine to have conscious understanding.

These arguments (and the robot or commonsense knowledge replies) identify some special technology that would help create conscious understanding in a machine. They may be interpreted in two ways: either they claim (1) this technology is required for consciousness, the Chinese room does not or cannot implement this technology, and therefore the Chinese room cannot pass the Turing test or (even if it did) it would not have conscious understanding. Or they may be claiming that (2) it is easier to see that the Chinese room has a mind if we visualize this technology as being used to create it.

In the first case, where features like a robot body or a connectionist architecture are required, Searle claims that strong AI (as he understands it) has been abandoned.{{efn|Searle writes that the robot reply "tacitly concedes that cognition is not solely a matter of formal symbol manipulation." {{sfn|Searle|1980|p=7}} Stevan Harnad makes the same point, writing: "Now just as it is no refutation (but rather an affirmation) of the CRA to deny that [the Turing test] is a strong enough test, or to deny that a computer could ever pass it, it is merely special pleading to try to save computationalism by stipulating ad hoc (in the face of the CRA) that implementational details do matter after all, and that the computer's is the 'right' kind of implementation, whereas Searle's is the 'wrong' kind."{{sfn|Harnad|2001|p=14}}}} The Chinese room has all the elements of a Turing complete machine, and thus is capable of simulating any digital computation whatsoever. If Searle's room can't pass the Turing test then there is no other digital technology that could pass the Turing test. If Searle's room ''could'' pass the Turing test, but still does not have a mind, then the Turing test is not sufficient to determine if the room has a "mind". Either way, it denies one or the other of the positions Searle thinks of as "strong AI", proving his argument.

The brain arguments in particular deny strong AI if they assume that there is no simpler way to describe the mind than to create a program that is just as mysterious as the brain was. He writes "I thought the whole idea of strong AI was that we don't need to know how the brain works to know how the mind works."{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=8}} If computation does not provide an ''explanation'' of the human mind, then strong AI has failed, according to Searle.

Other critics hold that the room as Searle described it does, in fact, have a mind, however they argue that it is difficult to see—Searle's description is correct, but ''misleading.'' By redesigning the room more realistically they hope to make this more obvious. In this case, these arguments are being used as appeals to intuition (see next section).

In fact, the room can just as easily be redesigned to ''weaken'' our intuitions. [[Ned Block]]'s [[Blockhead argument]]{{sfn|Block|1981}} suggests that the program could, in theory, be rewritten into a simple [[lookup table]] of [[Production system (computer science)|rules]] of the form "if the user writes ''S'', reply with ''P'' and goto X". At least in principle, any program can be rewritten (or "[[refactored]]") into this form, even a brain simulation.{{efn|That is, any program running on a machine with a finite amount memory.}} In the blockhead scenario, the entire mental state is hidden in the letter X, which represents a [[memory address]]—a number associated with the next rule. It is hard to visualize that an instant of one's conscious experience can be captured in a single large number, yet this is exactly what "strong AI" claims. On the other hand, such a lookup table would be ridiculously large (to the point of being physically impossible), and the states could therefore be ''extremely'' specific.

Searle argues that however the program is written or however the machine is connected to the world, the mind is being ''simulated'' by a simple step by step digital machine (or machines). These machines are always just like the man in the room: they understand nothing and don't speak Chinese. They are merely manipulating symbols without knowing what they mean. Searle writes: "I can have any formal program you like, but I still understand nothing."{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=3}}

===Speed and complexity: appeals to intuition===
The following arguments (and the intuitive interpretations of the arguments above) do not directly explain how a Chinese speaking mind could exist in Searle's room, or how the symbols he manipulates could become meaningful. However, by raising doubts about Searle's intuitions they support other positions, such as the system and robot replies. These arguments, if accepted, prevent Searle from claiming that his conclusion is obvious by undermining the intuitions that his certainty requires.

Several critics believe that Searle's argument relies entirely on intuitions. [[Ned Block]] writes "Searle's argument depends for its force on intuitions that certain entities do not think."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|p=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Dennett]] describes the Chinese room argument as a misleading "[[intuition pump]]"{{sfn|Dennett|1991|pp=437–440}} and writes "Searle's thought experiment depends, illicitly, on your imagining too simple a case, an irrelevant case, and drawing the 'obvious' conclusion from it."{{sfn|Dennett|1991|pp=437–440}}

Some of the arguments above also function as appeals to intuition, especially those that are intended to make it seem more plausible that the Chinese room contains a mind, which can include the robot, commonsense knowledge, brain simulation and connectionist replies. Several of the replies above also address the specific issue of complexity. The connectionist reply emphasizes that a working artificial intelligence system would have to be as complex and as interconnected as the human brain. The commonsense knowledge reply emphasizes that any program that passed a Turing test would have to be "an extraordinarily supple, sophisticated, and multilayered system, brimming with 'world knowledge' and meta-knowledge and meta-meta-knowledge", as [[Daniel Dennett]] explains.{{sfn|Dennett|1991|p=438}}

;Speed and complexity replies:The speed at which human brains process information is (by some estimates) 100 billion operations per second.{{sfn|Crevier|1993|p=269}} Several critics point out that the man in the room would probably take millions of years to respond to a simple question, and would require "filing cabinets" of astronomical proportions. This brings the clarity of Searle's intuition into doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|2004|pp=14–15}}; {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=269–270}}; {{Harvnb|Pinker|1997|p=95}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Speed and complexity replies are made by [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Tim Maudlin]], [[David Chalmers]], [[Steven Pinker]], [[Paul Churchland]], [[Patricia Churchland]] and others.{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=14}} Daniel Dennett points out the complexity of world knowledge.{{sfn|Dennett|1991|p=438}}}}

An especially vivid version of the speed and complexity reply is from [[Paul Churchland|Paul]] and [[Patricia Churchland]]. They propose this analogous thought experiment:

;Churchland's luminous room:"Consider a dark room containing a man holding a bar magnet or charged object. If the man pumps the magnet up and down, then, according to [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s theory of artificial luminance (AL), it will initiate a spreading circle of [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] waves and will thus be luminous. But as all of us who have toyed with magnets or charged balls well know, their forces (or any other forces for that matter), even when set in motion produce no luminance at all. It is inconceivable that you might constitute real luminance just by moving forces around!"{{sfn|Churchland|Churchland|1990}} The problem is that he would have to wave the magnet up and down something like 450 trillion times per second in order to see anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Churchland|Churchland|1990}}; {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|p=12}}; {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=270}}; {{Harvnb|Fearn|2007|pp=45–46}}; {{Harvnb|Pinker|1997|p=94}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stevan Harnad]] is critical of speed and complexity replies when they stray beyond addressing our intuitions. He writes "Some have made a cult of speed and timing, holding that, when accelerated to the right speed, the computational may make a [[phase transition]] into the mental. It should be clear that is not a counterargument but merely an ''[[ad hoc]]'' speculation (as is the view that it is all just a matter of ratcheting up to the right degree of 'complexity.')"{{sfn|Harnad|2001|p=7}}{{efn|Critics of the "phase transition" form of this argument include Stevan Harnad, [[Tim Maudlin]], [[Daniel Dennett]] and David Cole.{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=14}} This "phase transition" idea is a version of [[strong emergentism]] (what [[Daniel Dennett]] derides as "Woo woo West Coast emergence"{{sfn|Crevier|1993|p=275}}). Harnad accuses [[Paul Churchland|Churchland]] and [[Patricia Churchland]] of espousing strong emergentism. Ray Kurzweil also holds a form of strong emergentism.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2005}}}}

Searle argues that his critics are also relying on intuitions, however his opponents' intuitions have no empirical basis. He writes that, in order to consider the "system reply" as remotely plausible, a person must be "under the grip of an ideology".{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=6}} The system reply only makes sense (to Searle) if one assumes that any "system" can have consciousness, just by virtue of being a system with the right behavior and functional parts. This assumption, he argues, is not tenable given our experience of consciousness.

===Other minds and zombies: meaninglessness===&lt;!-- Linked to in a footnote above --&gt;

Several replies argue that Searle's argument is irrelevant because his assumptions about the mind and consciousness are faulty. Searle believes that  human beings directly experience their consciousness, intentionality and the nature of the mind every day, and that this experience of consciousness is not open to question.  He writes that we must "presuppose the reality and knowability of the mental."{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=10}} These replies question whether Searle is justified in using his own experience of consciousness to determine that it is more than mechanical symbol processing. In particular, the other minds reply argues that we cannot use our experience of consciousness to answer questions about other minds (even the mind of a computer), and the epiphenomena reply argues that Searle's consciousness does not "exist" in the sense that Searle thinks it does.

;Other minds reply:This reply points out that Searle's argument is a version of the [[problem of other minds]], applied to machines. There is no way we can determine if other people's subjective experience is the same as our own. We can only study their behavior (i.e., by giving them our own [[Turing test]]). Critics of Searle argue that he is holding the Chinese room to a higher standard than we would hold an ordinary person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980|p=9}}; {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|p=13}}; {{Harvnb|Hauser|2006|pp=4–5}}; {{Harvnb|Nilsson|1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The "other minds" reply has been offered by [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Ray Kurzweil]] and [[Hans Moravec]], among others.{{sfn|Cole|2004|pp=12–13}}}}

[[Nils Nilsson (researcher)|Nils Nilsson]] writes "If a program behaves ''as if''  it were multiplying, most of us would say that it is, in fact, multiplying.  For all I know, Searle may only be behaving ''as if''  he were thinking deeply about these matters.  But, even though I disagree with him, his simulation is pretty good, so I'm willing to credit him with real thought."{{sfn|Nilsson|1984}}

[[Alan Turing]] anticipated Searle's line of argument (which he called "The Argument from Consciousness") in 1950 and makes the other minds reply.{{sfn|Turing|1950|pp=11–12}} He noted that people never consider the problem of other minds when dealing with each other. He writes that "instead of arguing continually over this point it is usual to have the polite convention that everyone thinks."{{sfn|Turing|1950|p=11}} The [[Turing test]] simply extends this "polite convention" to machines. He doesn't intend to solve the problem of other minds (for machines or people) and he doesn't think we need to.{{efn|One of Turing's motivations for devising the [[Turing test]] is to avoid precisely the kind of philosophical problems that Searle is interested in. He writes "I do not wish to give the impression that I think there is no mystery ... [but] I do not think these mysteries necessarily need to be solved before we can answer the question with which we are concerned in this paper." {{sfn|Turing|1950|p=12}} Although Turing is discussing consciousness (not the mind or understanding or intentionality), Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig argue that Turing's comments apply the Chinese room.{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=952–953}}}}

; Epiphenomenon / zombie reply: Several philosophers argue that consciousness, as Searle describes it, does not exist. This position is sometimes referred to as [[eliminative materialism]]: the view that consciousness is a property that can be reduced to a strictly mechanical description, and that our experience of consciousness is, as Daniel Dennett describes it, a "[[user illusion]]".{{sfn|Dennett|1991|loc={{page needed|date=February 2011}}}}

:[[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig]] argue that, if we accept Searle's description of intentionality, consciousness and the mind, we are forced to accept that consciousness is  [[epiphenomenal]]: that it "casts no shadow", that it is undetectable in the outside world. They argue that Searle must be mistaken about the "knowability of the mental", and in his belief that there are "causal properties" in our neurons that give rise to the mind. They point out that, by Searle's own description, these causal properties can't be detected by anyone outside the mind, otherwise the Chinese Room couldn't pass the [[Turing test]]—the people outside would be able to tell there wasn't a Chinese speaker in the room by detecting their causal properties. Since they can't detect causal properties, they can't detect the existence of the mental. In short, Searle's "causal properties" and consciousness itself is undetectable, and anything that cannot be detected either does not exist or does not matter.{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003}}

[[Daniel Dennett]] provides this extension to the "epiphenomena" argument.
;Dennett's reply from natural selection:Suppose that, by some mutation, a human being is born that does not have Searle's "causal properties" but nevertheless acts exactly like a human being. (This sort of animal is called a "[[philosophical zombie|zombie]]" in thought experiments in the [[philosophy of mind]]). This new animal would reproduce just as any other human and eventually there would be more of these zombies. Natural selection would favor the zombies, since their design is (we could suppose) a bit simpler. Eventually the humans would die out. So therefore, if Searle is right, it is most likely that human beings (as we see them today) are actually "zombies", who nevertheless insist they are conscious. It is impossible to know whether we are all zombies or not. Even if we are all zombies, we would still believe that we are not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|2004|p=22}}; {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=271}}; {{Harvnb|Harnad|2005|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Searle disagrees with this analysis and argues that "the study of the mind starts with such facts as that humans have beliefs, while thermostats, telephones, and adding machines don't ... what we wanted to know is what distinguishes the mind from thermostats and livers."{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=7}} He takes it as obvious that we can detect the presence of consciousness and dismisses these replies as being off the point.

;[[Newton's flaming laser sword]] reply: [[Mike Alder]] argues that the entire argument is frivolous, because it is non-[[positivist]]: not only is the distinction between ''simulating'' a mind and ''having'' a mind ill-defined, but it is also irrelevant because no experiments were, or even can be, proposed to distinguish between the two.{{sfn|Alder|2004}}

==In popular culture==

The Chinese room argument is a central concept in [[Peter Watts (author)|Peter Watts]]'s novels ''[[Blindsight (Watts novel)|Blindsight]]'' and (to a lesser extent) ''Echopraxia''.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Whitmarsh. (2016). “Imagine You're a Machine”: Narrative Systems in Peter Watts's Blindsight and Echopraxia. Science Fiction Studies, 43(2), 237-259. doi:10.5621/sciefictstud.43.2.0237&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a central theme in the video game ''[[Virtue's Last Reward]]'', and ties into the game's narrative.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} In Season 4 of the American crime drama ''[[Numb3rs]]'' there is a brief reference to the Chinese room.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

[[The Chinese Room]] is also the name of a British independent video game development studio best known for working on experimental first-person games, such as ''[[Everybody's Gone to the Rapture]]'', or ''[[Dear Esther]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thechineseroom.co.uk/ |title=Home |website=The Chinese Room |language=en-GB |access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christian Norberg-Schulz''' (23 May 1926– 28 March 2000) was a Norwegian [[architect]], [[author]], [[educator]] and [[Architectural theory|architectural theorist]]. Norberg-Schulz was part of the [[Modernist]] Movement in architecture and associated with [[Phenomenology (architecture)|architectural phenomenology]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://snl.no/Christian_Norberg-Schulz ''Christian Norberg-Schulz'' (Store norske leksikon. Norske arkitekter og arkitektkontorer fra 1900 til i dag. Forfatter: Ketil Kiran)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meamnet.polimi.it/archive/037/037m.html ''Christian Norberg-Schulz'' (Modern European Architecture Museum)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Thorvald Christian Norberg-Schulz  was born in [[Oslo, Norway]]. He was educated at the [[Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule]]  in [[Zurich]] in 1949  with subsequent studies in [[Rome]]. He studied at [[Harvard University]] under a [[Fulbright scholarship]]. He received his [[Doctor of Technology]] in architecture from the [[Norwegian Institute of Technology]] in 1964 and became a professor at [[Yale University]], the following year. Norberg-Schulz was a Professor and later Dean at the [[Oslo School of Architecture and Design]] from 1966 to 1992. During 1974 he was a visiting professor at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] Architecture Department.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://kunsthistorie.com/fagwiki/Christian_Norberg-Schulz ''Christian Norberg-Schulz'' (Kunsthistorie)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aho.no/en/AHO/News-and-events/Calendar/2009/Book-launch-An-Eye-for-Place/ ''Christian Norberg-Schulz: Architect, Historian and Editor'' (Oslo School of Architecture and Design)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219184059/http://www.aho.no/en/AHO/News-and-events/Calendar/2009/Book-launch-An-Eye-for-Place/ |date=19 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s and 1960s, Norberg-Schulz practiced as an architect both alone and in collaboration with [[Arne Korsmo]], with whom he co-designed the famous row houses at Planetveien Street in Oslo, where both of them lived with their respective families.&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Otero-Pailos, “Norberg-Schulz’s House: The Modern Search for Home Through Visual Patterns,” in Architecture Norway (05 Nov, 2006) http://www.architecturenorway.no/questions/histories/otero-pailos-planetveien/&lt;/ref&gt; Norbert-Schulz became progressively disillusioned with practice, just as his first book "Intentions in Architecture" started to earn him international acclaim as an architectural theorist&lt;ref&gt;Citation is needed or reliable sources. It is personal in tone?!&lt;/ref&gt;. He later theoretical work of the 1970s and 1980s moved from the analytical and psychological concerns of his earlier writings to the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of place, being one of the first architectural theorists to bring [[Martin Heidegger]] to the field with serious scholarship and philosophical depth. His book "Genius Loci: Towards a Phenomenology of Architecture" (1979) was widely influential in Europe and the Americas. He is recognized as a central figure in the [[architectural phenomenology]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last =Otero-Pailos  | first =Jorge  | title =Architecture’s Historical Turn: Phenomenology and the Rise of the Postmodern  | publisher =University of Minnesota Press| year =2010 | location = | pages =146–182  | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=3WDOQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=architecture's%20historical%20turn&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions  | isbn=9780816666041}} Ch. 4: "Photo[historio]graphy: Christian Norbert-Schulz's Demotion of Textual History"&lt;/ref&gt; He is also well-known internationally both for his books on [[architectural history]] (in particular Italian [[classical architecture]], especially the [[Baroque]]) and for his writings on theory.

==Personal life==
In 1955, he married Anna Maria de Dominicis. He was the father of  the Norwegian opera singer [[Elizabeth Norberg-Schulz]] .In 1996 he received the [[Fritt Ord Honorary Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fritt-ord.no/no/priser/category/fritt_ords_honnor/|title=Priser – Fritt Ords Honnør|publisher=[[Fritt Ord (organization)|Fritt Ord]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''codebook''' is a type of document used for gathering and storing codes. Originally codebooks were often literally [[books|&lt;span lang="en-us" dir="ltr"&gt;books&lt;/span&gt;]], but today codebook is a byword for the complete record of a series of codes, regardless of physical format.

==Cryptography==
In [[cryptography]], a codebook is a document used for implementing a [[code (cryptography)|code]]. A codebook contains a [[lookup table]] for coding and decoding; each word or phrase has one or more strings which replace it. To decipher messages written in code, corresponding copies of the codebook must be available at either end. The distribution and [[physical security]] of codebooks presents a special difficulty in the use of codes, compared to the secret information used in [[cipher]]s, the [[cryptographic key|key]], which is typically much shorter.

The United States [[National Security Agency]] documents sometimes use ''codebook'' to refer to [[block cipher]]s; compare their use of ''combiner-type algorithm'' to refer to [[stream cipher]]s.

A codebook is usually made in two parts, one part being for converting plaintext to ciphertext, the other for the opposite purpose. Both are usually organized similar to a standard dictionary, with plaintext words (in the first part) and ciphertext words (in the second part) presented like dictionary headwords.

The book used in a [[book cipher]] or the book used in a [[running key cipher]] is generally not a cryptographic codebook.

==Social sciences==
In social sciences, a codebook is a document containing list of codes used in research.

==Data compression==
Codebooks were also used in 19th- and 20th-century [[Commercial code (communications)|commercial codes]] for the non-cryptographic purpose of data compression.

'''Lobegott Friedrich Constantin (von) Tischendorf''' (18 January 1815 &amp;ndash; 7 December 1874) was a world-leading [[biblical]] scholar in his time. In 1844{{citation needed|reason=should be 1859, see text below|date=February 2017}} he discovered the world's oldest and most complete Bible dating from 325{{citation needed|reason=the exact date is unknown, 330 to 350 would be acceptable|date=February 2017}}, with the complete New Testament not discovered before. This Bible is called [[Codex Sinaiticus]], after the [[Saint Catherine's Monastery|St. Catherine's Monastery]] at [[Mount Sinai|Mt. Sinai]], where Tischendorf discovered it.  The codex can be seen either in the [[British Library]] in London, or as a digitalised version on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Codex Sinaitius|url=http://www.codexsinaiticus.net/en/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225213856/http://www.codexsinaiticus.net/en/|archivedate=2014-02-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Textual disputes are resolved when the two oldest books, Codex Sinaiticus (source aleph, 4th AD) and [[Codex Vaticanus]] (source beta, 4th  AD), agree with each other. Tischendorf was made an Honorary Doctor by Oxford University on 16 March 1865, and an Honorary Doctor by Cambridge University on 9 March 1865 following this find of the century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Böttrich|first1=Christfried|title=Bibliographie Konstantin von Tischendorf (1815-1874)|date=1999|publisher=Universitätsverlag, Leipzig}}&lt;/ref&gt; While a student gaining his academic degree in the 1840s, he earned international recognition when he deciphered the ''[[Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus]]'', a 5th-century [[Greek language|Greek]] [[biblical manuscript|manuscript]] of the [[New Testament]]. 
'''

== The Codex Sinaiticus ==

The ''[[Codex Sinaiticus]]'' contains a 4th-century manuscript of New Testament texts. Two other Bibles of similar age exist, though they are less complete: [[Codex Vaticanus]] in the [[Vatican Library]] and  [[Codex Alexandrinus]], currently owned by the British Library. The Codex Sinaiticus is deemed by some{{by whom|date=July 2017}} to be the most authoritative surviving New Testament manuscript, as no older document is as complete as the Codex.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csntm.org/manuscript/View/GA_01&lt;/ref&gt; The content of the "oldest Bible of the world"{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} (as it is more complete than [[Codex Alexandrinus]] or [[Codex Vaticanus]]) has been digitised.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140225213856/http://www.codexsinaiticus.net/en/ Codex Sinaiticus. Experience the oldest Bible]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tischendorf's motivation ==

Throughout his life Tischendorf sought old biblical manuscripts, as he saw it as his task to give theology a Greek New Testament which was based on the oldest possible scriptures. He intended to be as close as possible to the original sources. Tischendorf's greatest discovery was in the monastery of Saint Catherine on the [[Sinai Peninsula]], which he visited in May 1844, and again in 1853 and 1859 (as Russian envoy).

In 1862 Tischendorf published the text of the Codex Sinaiticus for the 1000th Anniversary of the Russian Monarchy in both an illustrious four-volume facsimile edition and in a less costly text edition, to enable all scholars to have access to the Codex.

Tischendorf pursued a constant course of editorial labours, mainly on the New Testament, until he was broken down by overwork in 1873. His motive, as explained in a publication on Tischendorf's Letter by Prof. Christfried Boettrich (Leibzig University, Prof. of Theology), was to prove scientifically that the words of the Bible were trustfully transmitted over centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Christfried Böttrich]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
[[File:Codex Sinaiticus Petropolitanus (title).JPG|thumb|right|220px|Title page from facsimile edition of codex Sinaiticus]]

Tischendorf was born in [[Lengenfeld]], [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]], near [[Plauen]], the son of a physician. Beginning in 1834, he spent his scholarly career at the [[University of Leipzig]] where he was mainly influenced by [[Georg Benedikt Winer|JGB Winer]], and he began to take special interest in [[New Testament]] [[textual criticism|criticism]]. Winer's influence gave him the desire to use the oldest manuscripts in order to compile the text of the New Testament as close to the original as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Panning, Armin J. [http://www.wlsessays.net/files/PanningTischendorf.pdf Home Tischendorf and the History of the Greek New Testament Text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130095538/http://wlsessays.net/files/PanningTischendorf.pdf |date=2010-11-30 }}, Milwaukee: Wisconsin Lutheran Quarterly, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1838 he took the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, then became master at a school near [[Leipzig]].

After a journey through southern Germany and [[Switzerland]], and a visit to [[Strassburg]], he returned to Leipzig, and set to work upon a critical study of the New Testament text. In 1840 he qualified as university lecturer in theology with a dissertation on the [[recension]]s of the New Testament text — the main part of which reappeared the following year in the prolegomena to his first edition of the Greek New Testament. His critical apparatus included variant readings from earlier scholars — [[Elsevier]], [[Georg Christian Knapp]], [[Johann Martin Augustin Scholz]], and as recent as [[Karl Lachmann]] — whereby his researches were emboldened to depart from the [[received text]] as used in churches.

These early textual studies convinced him of the absolute necessity of new and more exact [[collation]]s of manuscripts. From October 1840 until January 1843 he was in Paris, busy with the treasures of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque Nationale]], eking out his scanty means by making collations for other scholars, and producing for the publisher, [[Firmin Didot]], several editions of the Greek New Testament — one of them exhibiting the form of the text corresponding most closely to the [[Vulgate]]. His second edition retracted the more precarious readings of the first, and included a statement of critical principles that is a landmark for evolving critical studies of Biblical texts.&lt;ref name = "Bible Researcher"&gt;[http://www.bible-researcher.com/bib-t.html Bible Researcher].&lt;/ref&gt;

A great triumph of these laborious months was the decipherment of the [[palimpsest]] ''[[Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus|Codex Ephraemi Syri Rescriptus]]'', of which the New Testament part was printed before he left Paris, and the [[Old Testament]] in 1845. His success in dealing with a manuscript that, having been over-written with other works of [[Ephrem the Syrian]], had been mostly illegible to earlier collators, made him more well known, and gained support for more extended critical expeditions. He now became ''professor extraordinarius'' at Leipzig, and where he was married in 1845. He also began to publish ''Reise in den Orient'', an account of his travels in the east (in 2 vols., 1845–46, translated as ''Travels in the East'' in 1847). Even though he was an expert in reading the text of a palimpsest (this is a document where the original writing has been removed and new writing added), he was not able to identify the value or meaning of the "Archimedes Palimpsest", which he donated to Cambridge.

From Paris, he had paid short visits to the [[Netherlands]] (1841) and England (1842). In 1843 he visited Italy, and after a stay of thirteen months, went on to [[Egypt]], [[Sinai peninsula|Sinai]], and the [[Levant]], returning via [[Vienna]] and [[Munich]].

=== Discovery of the Codex Sinaiticus Bible manuscripts ===

In 1844 Tischendorf travelled the first time to [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] at the foot of [[Mount Sinai]] in Egypt, where he found the oldest complete known Bible. Of the many pages which were contained in an old wicker basket (the kind that the monastery hauled in its visitors as customary in unsafe territories) he was given 43 pages as a present. He donated those 43 pages to King [[Frederick Augustus II of Saxony]] (reigned 1836-1854), to honour him and to recognise his patronage as the funder of Tischenforf's journey. (Tischendorf held a position as Theological Professor at [[Leipzig University]], also under the patronage of Frederick Augustus II.) Leipzig University put 2 of the leaves on display in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tischendorf- Search for the oldest Bible of the world|url= http://www.ub.uni-leipzig.de/tischendorf/home.html|publisher=University Leipzig}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1= Kholodiuk|first1= Anatoly|title= Tischendorf in search of the oldest Bible of the world - Leibzig Exhibition 2011|url=http://www.pravoslavie.ru/english/44856.htm|website=pravoslavie.ru/english/44856.htm|publisher=Pravoslavie|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Tischendorf reported in his 1865 book ''Wann Wurden Unsere Evangelen Verfasst'', translated to English in 1866 as  ''When Were Our Gospels Written'' in the section "The Discovery of the Sinaitic Manuscript" that he found, in a trash basket, forty-three sheets of parchment of an ancient copy of the Greek Old Testament, reporting that the monks were using the trash to start fires. And Tischendorf, horrified, asked if he could have them. He deposited them at the [[Leipzig University Library|University of Leipzig]], under the title of the ''[[Codex Sinaiticus|Codex Friderico-Augustanus]]'', a name given in honour of his patron, [[Frederick Augustus II of Saxony]], king of Saxony. The fragments were published in 1846, although Tischendorf kept the place of discovery a secret.

Many have expressed skepticism at the historical accuracy of this report of saving a 1500-year-old parchment from the flames. [[J. Rendel Harris]] referred to the story as a ''myth''.&lt;ref&gt;"What a run this myth has had, of a convent stove fed with parchment! unhappily for the statement, the basket is still there, a regular part of the library furniture, and not a suggestion can be found that it was ever used to carry vellum books to the kitchen for burning. But any story will be believed against the Sinaitic monks, even that they made fires with parchment." [https://books.google.com/books?id=u6gQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA140 Dr Gregory and the Canon and Text of the New Testament, ''Expositor'', 1908, p. 140]&lt;/ref&gt; The Tischendorf Lesebuch (see References) quotes that the Librarian Kyrillos mentioned to Tischendorf that the contents of the basket had already twice been submitted to the fire. The contents of the baskets were damaged scriptures, the third filling apparently, so cited by Tischendorf himself.[see Tischendorf Lesebuch, Tischendorf's own account]. 
In 1853 Tischendorf made a second trip to the Syrian monastery but made no new discoveries. He returned a third time in January 1859 under the patronage of Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]] with the active aid of the Russian government to find more of the ''Codex Frederico-Augustanus'' or similar ancient Biblical texts. On February 4, the last day of his visit, he was shown a text which he recognized as significant — the ''[[Codex Sinaiticus]]'' — a Greek manuscript of the complete New Testament and parts of the Old Testament dating to the 4th century.

Tischendorf persuaded the monks to present the manuscript to [[Tsar]] [[Alexander II of Russia]], at the cost of the Tsar it was published in 1862 (in four folio volumes). Those{{who|date=November 2014}} ignorant of the details of his discovery of the ''Codex Sinaiticus'' accused Tischendorf of buying manuscripts from ignorant [[monastery]] librarians at low prices. Indeed, he was never rich, but he staunchly defended the rights of the monks at Saint Catherine's Monastery when he persuaded them eventually to send the manuscript to the Tsar. This took approximately 10 years because the abbot of St Catherines had to be re-elected and confirmed in office in Cairo and in Jerusalem, and during those 10 years no one in the monastery had the authority to hand over any documents. However the documents were handed over in due course following a signed and sealed letter to the Tsar Alexander II (Schenkungsurkunde). Even so, the monks of Mt. Sinai still display a receipt-letter from Tischendorf promising to return the manuscript to them in the case that the donation can not be done. This token-letter had to be destroyed, following the late issue of a "Schenkungsurkunde". This donation act regulated the Codex exchange with the Tsar, against 9000 Rubels and Rumanian estate protection. The Tsar was seen as the protector of Greek-Orthodox Christians. Thought lost since the Russian revolution, the document (Schenkungsurkunde) has now resurfaced in St Petersburg 2003, and has also been long before commented upon by other scholars like Kurt Aland. The monastery has disputed the existence of the gift certificate (Schenkungsurkunde) since the British Library was named as the new owner of the Codex. Now following the late find of the gift certificate by the [[National Library of Russia|National Russian Library]] the existence cannot be disputed in earnest.&lt;ref name="nlr.ru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nlr.ru/eng/exib/CodexSinaiticus/zah/|title=A.V. Zakharova.

Supporting the production of the facsimile, all made with special print characters for each of the 4 scribes of the Codex Sinaiticus, was shift work and contributed to Tischendorf's early demise due to exhausting work for months also during nights. Thus the Codex found its way to the Imperial Library at St. Petersburg.&lt;ref name="nlr.ru"/&gt;

When the 4-volume luxury edition of the Sinai Bible was completed in 1862, C. Tischendorf presented the original ancient manuscript to Emperor Alexander II. Meanwhile, the question of transferring the manuscript to the full possession of the Russian Sovereign remained unresolved for some years. In 1869, the new Archbishop of Sinai, Callistratus, and the monastic community, signed the official certificate presenting the manuscript to the Tsar. The Russian Government, in turn, bestowed the Monastery with 9000 rubles and decorated the Archbishop and some of the brethren with orders. In 1933 the Soviet Government sold the Codex Sinaiticus for 100,000 pounds to the [[British Museum]] in London, England. The official certificate with signatures in Russian/ French/ Greek sections has been refound in St Petersburg.&lt;ref name="nlr.ru"/&gt;

=== Novum Testamentum Graece - publication with 21 editions ===

In the winter of 1849 the first edition of his great work now titled ''Novum Testamentum Graece. Ad antiquos testes recensuit. Apparatum criticum multis modis'' appeared (translated as ''Greek New Testament. The ancient witnesses reviewed. Preparations critical in many ways''), containing [[wiktionary:canon|canon]]s of criticism, adding examples of their application that are applicable to students today:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Basic rule: "The text is only to be sought from ancient evidence, and especially from Greek manuscripts, but without neglecting the testimonies of versions and [[Fathers of the Church|fathers]]."
#"A reading altogether peculiar to one or another ancient document is suspicious; as also is any, even if supported by a class of documents, which seems to evince that it has originated in the revision of a learned man."
#"Readings, however well supported by evidence, are to be rejected, when it is manifest (or very probable) that they have proceeded from the errors of copyists."
#"In parallel passages, whether of the New or Old Testament, especially in the [[Synoptic Gospels]], which ancient copyists continually brought into increased accordance, those testimonies are preferable, in which precise accordance of such parallel passages is not found; unless, indeed, there are important reasons to the contrary."
#"In discrepant readings, that should be preferred which may have given occasion to the rest, or which appears to comprise the elements of the others."
#"Those readings must be maintained which accord with [[Koine Greek|New Testament Greek]], or with the particular style of each individual writer."&lt;ref name = "Bible Researcher" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These were partly the result of the tireless travels he had begun in 1839 in search of unread manuscripts of the New Testament, "to clear up in this way," he wrote, "the history of the sacred text, and to recover if possible the genuine [[Twelve apostles|apostolic]] text which is the foundation of our faith."

In 1850 appeared his edition of the ''[[Codex Amiatinus]]'' (in 1854 corrected)&lt;ref&gt;Constantinus Tischendorf, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=pl&amp;id=x0opAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=NOVUM_TESTAMENTUM_LATINE#v= ''Codex Amiatinus. Novum Testamentum Latine interpreter Hieronymo''], (Lipsiae 1854).&lt;/ref&gt; and of the [[Septuagint]] version of the Old Testament (7th ed., 1887); in 1852, amongst other works, his edition of the ''[[Codex Claromontanus]]''.

Meanwhile, also in 1859, he had been made ''professor ordinarius'' of theology and of Biblical [[paleography]], this latter professorship being specially created for him; and another book of travel, ''Aus dem heiligen Lande'', appeared in 1862. Tischendorf's Eastern journeys were rich enough in other discoveries to merit the highest praise.

Besides his fame as a scholar, he was a friend of both [[Robert Schumann]], with whom he corresponded, and [[Felix Mendelssohn]], who dedicated a song to him. His text critical colleague [[Samuel Prideaux Tregelles]] wrote warmly of their mutual interest in textual scholarship. His personal library, purchased after his death, eventually came to the [[University of Glasgow]],&lt;ref name = "Univ Glasgow"&gt;[http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/collection/tischendorf.html Tischendorf] at the [[University of Glasgow]], Scotland.&lt;/ref&gt; where a commemorative exhibition of books from his library was held in 1974 and can be accessed by the public.

He died in [[Leipzig]].

His ''magnum opus'' was the "Critical Edition of the New Testament."

The great edition, of which the text and apparatus appeared in 1869 and 1872, was called by himself ''editio viii''; but this number is raised to twenty or twenty-one, if mere reprints from [[stereotype]] plates and the minor editions of his great critical texts are included; posthumous prints bring the total to forty-one. Four main recensions of Tischendorf's text may be distinguished, dating respectively from his editions of 1841, 1849, 1859 (ed. vii), and 1869–72 (ed. viii). The edition of 1849 may be regarded as historically the most important, from the mass of new critical material it used; that of 1859 is distinguished from Tischendorf's other editions by coming nearer to the received text; in the eighth edition, the testimony of the Sinaitic manuscript received great (probably too great) weight. The readings of the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] manuscript were given with more exactness and certainty than had been possible in the earlier editions, and the editor had also the advantage of using the published labours of his colleague and friend [[Samuel Prideaux Tregelles]].

Of relatively lesser importance was Tischendorf's work on the Greek Old Testament. His edition of the Roman text, with the variants of the Alexandrian manuscript, the ''[[Codex Ephraemi]]'', and the ''Friderico-Augustanus'', was of service when it appeared in 1850, but, being stereotyped, was not greatly improved in subsequent issues. Its imperfections, even within the limited field it covers, may be judged by the aid of [[Eberhard Nestle]]'s appendix to the 6th issue (1880).

Besides this may be mentioned editions of the [[New Testament apocrypha]], ''De Evangeliorum apocryphorum origine et usu'' (1851); ''Acta Apostolorum apocrypha'' (1851); ''Evangelia apocrypha'' (1853; 2nd ed., 1876); ''Apocalypses apocryphae'' (1866), and various minor writings, partly of an apologetic character, such as ''Wann wurden unsere Evangelien verfasst?'' (''When Were Our Gospels Written?''; 1865; 4th ed., 1866, digitized by Google and available for e-readers), ''Haben wir den echten Schrifttext der Evangelisten und Apostel?'' (1873), and ''Synopsis evangelica'' (7th ed., 1898).

A '''cosmid''' is a type of hybrid [[plasmid]] that contains a [[Lambda phage]] ''cos'' sequence
. Cosmids (''cos'' sites + plasmid = cosmids) DNA sequences are originally from the [[lambda phage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hohn|first1=Barbara|last2=Murray|first2=Kenneth|title=Packaging recombinant DNA molecules into bacteriophage particles in vitro|journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA|date=August 1977|volume=74|issue=8|pages=3259–3263|doi=10.1073/pnas.74.8.3259|pmc=431522}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are often used as a [[cloning vector]] in [[genetic engineering]]. Cosmids can be used to build [[Library (biology)|genomic libraries]]. They were first described by Collins and Hohn in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collins|first1=John|last2=Hohn|first2=Barbara|title=Cosmids: a type of plasmid gene-cloning vector that is packageable in vitro in bacteriophage lambda heads|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=September 1, 1978|volume=75|issue=9|pages=4242–4246|doi=10.1073/pnas.75.9.4242|pmc=336088}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cosmids can contain 37 to 52 (normally 45) [[base pair|kb]] of DNA, limits based on the normal bacteriophage packaging size. They can [[DNA replication|replicate]] as plasmids if they have a suitable [[origin of replication]] (ori): for example [[SV40]] ori in mammalian cells, [[ColE1]] ori for double-stranded DNA replication, or [[F1 phage|f1]] ori for single-stranded DNA replication in [[prokaryote]]s. They frequently also contain a gene for selection such as [[antibiotic resistance]], so that the transformed cells can be identified by plating on a medium containing the antibiotic. Those cells which did not take up the cosmid would be unable to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ndsu.edu/pubweb/~mcclean/plsc731/cloning/cloning4.htm | title=Cosmids | publisher=Phillip McClean | accessdate=April 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike plasmids, they can also be packaged in [[phage]] [[capsid]]s, which allows the foreign genes to be transferred into or between cells by [[transduction (genetics)|transduction]]. Plasmids become unstable after a certain amount of DNA has been inserted into them, because their increased size is more conducive to [[Genetic recombination|recombination]]. To circumvent this, phage transduction is used instead. This is made possible by the ''cohesive ends'', also known as ''cos'' sites. In this way, they are similar to using the lambda phage as a vector, except ''all'' the lambda genes have been deleted with the exception of the ''cos'' sequence.

==''Cos'' sequences==
''Cos'' sequences are ~200 base pairs long and essential for packaging. They contain a ''cosN'' site where DNA is nicked at each strand, 12 bp apart, by [[terminase]]. This causes linearization of the circular cosmid with two "cohesive" or "sticky ends" of 12bp. (The DNA must be linear to fit into a phage head.) The ''cosB'' site holds the terminase while it is nicking and separating the strands. The ''cosQ'' site of next cosmid (as [[rolling circle replication]] often results in linear [[concatemers]]) is held by the terminase after the previous cosmid has been packaged, to prevent degradation by cellular [[DNase]]s.

==Cosmid features and uses==
[[File:Cosmid (English).svg|thumb|400 px|right|Scheme of DNA cloning in a cosmid vector.]]
Cosmids are predominantly plasmids with a bacterial ''oriV'', an antibiotic selection marker and a cloning site, but they carry one, or more recently two, cos sites derived from bacteriophage lambda. Depending on the particular aim of the experiment broad host range cosmids, shuttle cosmids or 'mammalian' cosmids (linked to SV40 oriV and mammalian selection markers) are available. The loading capacity of cosmids varies depending on the size of the vector itself but usually lies around 40–45 kb. The cloning procedure involves the generation of two vector arms which are then joined to the foreign DNA. Selection against wild type cosmid DNA is simply done via size exclusion. Cosmids, therefore, always form colonies and not plaques. Also the clone density is much lower with around 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; – 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; [[Colony-forming unit|CFU]] per µg of ligated DNA.

After the construction of recombinant lambda or cosmid libraries the total DNA is transferred into an appropriate ''E. coli'' host via a technique called in vitro packaging. The necessary packaging extracts are derived from ''E. coli'' cI857 lysogens (red- gam- Sam and Dam (head assembly) and Eam (tail assembly) respectively). These extracts will recognize and package the recombinant molecules ''in vitro'', generating either mature phage particles (lambda-based vectors) or recombinant plasmids contained in phage shells (cosmids). These differences are reflected in the different infection frequencies seen in favour of lambda-replacement vectors. This compensates for their slightly lower loading capacity. Phage libraries are also stored and screened more easily than cosmid libraries.

Target DNA: the genomic DNA to be cloned has to be cut into the appropriate size range of restriction fragments. This is usually done by partial restriction followed by either size fractionation or dephosphorylation (using calf-intestine phosphatase) to avoid chromosome scrambling, i.e. the ligation of physically unlinked fragments.

From the inspiration of defensive guise behaviors based on [[Mimicry|mimic]] phenomenon in biology,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.octopusworlds.com/octopus-defenses/|title=Octopus Defenses - Octopus Facts and Information|website=www.octopusworlds.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Cyber Mimic Defense''' (CMD) introduces the mechanism of dynamic multi-dimensional reconfiguration into a dissimilar redundancy structure (DRS) which is widely used in [[Reliability engineering|the field of reliability]]. It addresses certain or uncertain threats in cyberspace by the principle of uncertain defense, and provides the strategic varieties and transformations of DRS elements inside objects in quantity or type, time or space dimension under the condition of unchanged visual functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=网络空间拟态防御研究 - 《中国学术期刊（网络版）》|url=http://www.cnki.net/kcms/doi/10.19363/j.cnki.cn10-1380/tn.2016.04.001.html|doi=10.19363/j.cnki.cn10-1380/tn.2016.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It provides a generally innovative defense theory and method to deal with the “known unknown risk” and “unknown unknown risk” which exist in related application levels of different areas of cyberspace and are based on unknown [[Vulnerability|vulnerabilities]], [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoors]], [[Computer virus|viruses]] or [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojans]] and etc. This method can provide not only endogenous security gains which are independent of traditional security means and achieved via integrated structural technologies for critical infrastructures or key information equipment, but also resilient or restorable service ability with intensive attributes inherited from the architecture.

Further it acquires super nonlinear effects combining mature defense technologies. It's aimed at creating a non-closed, self-controlled and sustainable-developed ecological environment which adapts to [[globalization]] technologies and industrial development models and integrates with win-win cooperation and open sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.dahe.cn/2016/11-17/107795596.html|title=网络空间拟态防御亮相“互联网之光”博览会 年底前或将商用_新闻中心_大河网|last=祝萍|website=news.dahe.cn|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In the current [[cyberspace]], there are "unknown unknown threats", namely uncertain threats. Usually, such threats are originated from human attacks, based on existing unknown design [[Software bug|bugs]] referred as [[Vulnerability|vulnerabilities]] in [[Computer hardware|hardware]] and [[software]] of [[information system]]s, or induced from [[backdoor (computing)|backdoor attacks]], based on mounting [[Malware|malicious codes]] of software and hardware in the era of globalization which cannot ensure the credibility of the industry chain. Based on the existing scientific level and cognitive ability of [[Human|human beings]], it's impossible to make a scientific judgment neither from the theory nor from the practice that complex information systems have no vulnerabilities and backdoors. Moreover, it's impossible to completely avoid design bugs or backdoors in the engineering level. So it's a consensus in the field of security that the biggest threat in cyberspace comes from unknown vulnerabilities, backdoors, viruses or Trojans and etc.

The existing defense system is the concept of precise defense based on perceptual cognition, which requires a certain amount of clear and reliable prior knowledge as the support, such as sources, characteristics, processes and behavior of attack, working in the precondition of “known risks” or “known unknown risks”. So it's an acquired defense system with the "bottom line defense", often supported by [[encryption]] or [[authentication]]. It is a common fragility in the system and mechanism of defense against unknown vulnerabilities, backdoors, viruses or Trojans and etc. Especially in the ecological environment of system hardware and software components whose credibility cannot be ensured, main defense means based on it almost have no effective real-time defense capability in the face of uncertain threats except for repairing after damages have been done ( “mending the fold after the sheep have been stolen”) without the security guarantee of steps in encryption and authentication or other defensive functions, which can bypass or make short circuits deliberately.

Additionally, existing information systems have [[Statics|static structures]], similar functions, and certain operating mechanisms. These features can’t provide [[attackers]] with the facilitation such as objective identification, defense behavior detection, attack techniques testing and refining, combat effectiveness evaluation and so on. Meanwhile, most of the information systems inherit the operating mechanisms of single processing space and [[Shared resource|resources sharing]], so that invaders can achieve the desired operation through the operating mechanisms of resources sharing when they enter this space. This is also one of the important basic conditions in many network attack theories, including “[[Side-channel attack|the side channel attack]]” which is used to break through the “physical isolation network” nowadays. As a result, the largest [[black hole]] of [[Computer security|cyber security]] consists of determinacy in the information system architecture and mechanism, fragility in passive defensive system, deficiency in active immune mechanisms and other key issues.

== Basic Concepts ==

=== Foundation of the Axioms ===
 Axiom 1：“There are many algorithms to reach the goal under the condition of given functions and performance.”
These diversified heterogeneous algorithms are equivalent under the condition of given functions and performance. If it can be proven that union or intersection calculation results of feasible methods can still meet requirements of equivalent functions, no matter what scheduling strategies or dynamic combination of these heterogeneous algorithms are done, it will not change the given functions. Accordingly, the mapping relationship between the visual functions and the structure of the object is no longer unique or certain from the perspective of attackers, which can be used to achieve the active defense by the defenders.
 Axiom 2：“Everyone has diverse shortcomings while they rarely make the same mistakes on the same tasks in the same place at the same time.”
This axiom provides a theoretical basis for applications of multi-mode ruling mechanisms of the heterogeneous redundancy architecture in fault tolerance, handling random failures of hardware and software in the field of reliability. This means that cyber problems based on unknown vulnerabilities, backdoors, Trojans, viruses and certain or uncertain threats can be transformed into risk protection problems through heterogeneous and redundant mechanism defense. Unless the attackers have resources and capabilities to achieve the consistent error expression through a cooperative attack dilemma under the condition of non-cooperation in heterogeneous multi-target space, it is difficult for attackers to escape from the multi-mode arbitral mechanism.

=== Implementation Architecture ===
&lt;u&gt;Dynamic Heterogeneous Redundancy Architecture&lt;/u&gt;，DHR

=== Operating Mechanism ===
Through the multi-mode policy ruling and multi-dimensional dynamic reconfiguration mechanism under the condition of “de-cooperation”, difficult and costly engineering problems of the attack surface of complex systems can be turned into reduced problems of the attack surface of soft and hard parts, which is space-independent, function-simple and within mimic bracket. Moreover, it's able to minimize the dominant or recessive correlation among heterogeneous redundant entities, which causes the heterogeneous multi-target dynamic cooperative attack dilemma for attackers under the condition of non-cooperation. This reduces the engineering difficulty to implement “self-control, secure and trustable” strategy in cyberspace from “no security short board of the whole chain” to the guarantee of the absolute security of individual procedures or key components.

=== Security Concept ===
With the idea of the Moving Attack Surface, (MAS), the CMD system can be regarded as a kind of proactive defense system which deploys the multi-dimensional attack surface in an unpredictable way under the condition of visually-unchanged functions. Due to multiple-heterogeneity of structures and environments from each executive entity, it enables resources exploited by attackers (including lurkers) to have uncertainty in temporal and spatial dimensions. At the macro level, it appears that the attack surface is always making irregular movements. Especially for those attack missions which need multiple steps to transmit data to achieve attack goals, the premise of achievability can hardly be guaranteed.

=== Security Gain ===
Mimic defense gains (MDG) purely acquire nonlinear security gains through endogenous mechanisms of the framework. MDG in the mimic defense framework is endogenous. In mechanisms, there is no dependence on existing security defense technologies, such as encryption authentication, firewall filtering, virus detection, intrusion detection (Trojan removal), prevention, isolation and removal measures while traditional incremental means (vulnerability patching, backdoor blocking or malicious code removal, etc.) can be seen as supplementary measures to stabilize the defense effect. Besides, it has no real-time requirements for above technologies. However, the heterogeneous property of the Mimic system can be significantly enhanced with combination of these traditional security technologies, and results in improving the defensive capability of the object in a super nonlinear way.

== Technical Route ==
CMD has the following features. It integrates a variety of proactive defense elements technically as the concept. And the similarity and singularity of the target system are altered via heterogeneity and diversity while the static state and certainty of the target system are transformed through dynamic and stochastic means. Also it identifies and shields unknown defects and threats based on heterogeneous, redundant and multi-mode ruling mechanisms. Further, it enhances the flexibility or elasticity of the service function of the target system via high reliable architecture. Simultaneously, it defends or denies an uncertain threat to the target system depending on systems’ uncertain attributes. The above objectives can be achieved by a DHR-based and integrated technological framework.

== Mimic Defense Boundary ==
MDB (also abbreviated as Mimic Boundary) contains a number of service (operation) functions with normative definitions and strict agreements. Through consistency or conformance tests of these standardized protocols or specifications, we can determine the equivalence of multiple heterogeneous executive entities (complexity-unlimited) on given service (operation) functions or even performance. That is to say, the equivalence between functional executive entities, including the consistency of given exception handling functions or performance, can be judged via the consistency tests of the relationship between input and output through MDB. And the integrity, effectiveness and security of functions defined by MDB are a prerequisite for effective mimic defense, while functions (operations) not defined by MDB explicitly don’t belong to the scope of mimic defense (but there may exist a derived protective effect). In other words, if attackers do not make the output vectors inconsistent on the Mimic Boundary, the mimic mechanism won’t react. Therefore, it is essentially important to set, divide and choose MDB reasonably in engineering implementation. 
Specifically, security issues beyond MDB don’t belong to the scope of mimic defense. For example, security threats are caused by means which are independent of unknown vulnerabilities, backdoors or other factors within MDB, like fishing, bundling malicious functions in service software, pushing virus codes in cross-platform interpreted executive files and carrying toxic software through downloading behaviors from users.

=== Mimic Escape, ME ===
Mimic Escape refers to the process in which attackers make the heterogeneous redundant entities in MDB produce identical or mostly identical errors, thus breaking through the multi-mode arbitral mechanism and achieving the attack. Mimic Escape is an uncertain problem whose performance is not stable because of the DHR mechanism, and cannot be expressed by probability. More generally, “there is no second chance for a successful attack.”

=== Mimic Presentation, MP ===
Mimic Presentation refers to the visual relationship between the external service functions observed by attackers and the implementation structures of the object. The more complicated, less certainty and more diverse the relationship is, the more unpredictable the defensive behavior and environment of the object will be. Accordingly, the creation and maintenance of an attack chain will be more difficult, and the possibility of planning or deploying the attack will be lower. When the number and types of the heterogeneous redundant entities are determined, the levels of Mimic Presentation are strongly correlated to the scheduling and generation strategies for the set of executive entities.

== Mimic Defense Levels ==

=== Utter-Shielding Level ===
If the given MDB is facing an external invasion or “insider” attacks, protected functions, services and information are not affected and attackers can’t make any assessment on attack effectiveness, as if they fall into an “information black hole”, which is called the utter shielding level, the highest level of mimic defense.

=== Non-sustainable Level ===
If the given MDB is facing an external invasion or “insider” attacks, protected functions or information may make corrections after error-making or be self-healing with uncertain probability or duration. For attackers, even if they make a breakthrough, they hardly maintain attacks’ effects or can’t provide any meaningful basis for subsequent attacks, which is called the non-sustainable level.

=== Hard-reproducible Level ===
If the given MDB is facing an external invasion or “insider” attacks, protected functions or information may be out of control in a certain duration while it's hard to reproduce the same scene with repeating identical attacks. In other words, the attack scene or experience after a breakthrough can’t be inherited and lacks in utilized value in time dimension, which is called the hard-reproduced level.

=== Principles of Grading ===
More defense levels can be defined to meet comprehensive demands for security and implementation cost in different application scenarios. Four factors have to be taken into account regarding the security. The core of mimic defense is different-degree uncertainty on attack actions. The non-perceptive trait makes it impossible for attackers to acquire effective information of the defender at all stages of the attack chain. The non-sustainable feature enables the attack chain to lose its utilized stability. And the non-reproducible character makes it difficult to exploit experience based on accumulative probes and attacks as priori knowledge in the following attack missions.

== Applicable Field ==
Under the condition of the functional input-output relationship or meeting the IPO model, to solve the problem of service functions, performance and important information resources must be explicit and robust providing, insensitive to initial investment or product pricing, space or power consumption are acceptable and there are standard or standardized functional interfaces and protocol specifications and multiple or diverse processing conditions as well as occasions where the reliability and availability of the system or device are challenged by the traditional security and cyberspace non-traditional security. 
It should be pointed out that, under the above conditions, it is suitable to implement the mimic defense in any application where the target algorithm is determined and there are other equivalent algorithms. As the accuracy of results between different algorithms with function equivalence may be different (for example, the result is accurate to several decimal places.), or if the range of the control amount is a range, even if the problem is applied to a subject such as a scientific calculation or an application in an industrial control field, multi-mode decisions can also be made using a policy such as "precision mask" or "expected range".

== Mimic Phenomenon and Mimic Defense ==
The Mimic Phenomenon (MP) means that a creature simulates another creature or environment in color, texture, shape and other features so that one or both of the parties benefit from the ecological adaptation. From the perspective of the defender, it can be included in the category of active defense based on the endogenous mechanism, referred as Mimic Guise (MG). Besides the simulation in color, texture, shape and other features, we refer the simulation of behavior and state as Mimic Defense (MD). To be specific in cyberspace, under the premise of remaining unchanged in given functions and performance of an object, it can be transformed in space-time dimension strategically such as system architectures, operation processes, core algorithms, abnormal behavior and other environmental factors as well as unknown vulnerabilities, backdoors or Trojans, viruses which may exist in an attached mode . Accordingly, we refer this system and mechanism of defense as Cyber Mimic Defense (CMD).

== Dynamic Heterogeneous Redundancy Architecture (DHR) ==
DHR is a theoretical method of achieving mimic defense. It's based on a dissimilar redundancy structure (DRS) in the field of reliability and introduces the mechanism of dynamically multi-dimensional reconfiguration, which enables it not only have high reliability of DRS but also high security of mimic defense. We refer this heterogeneous redundant structure as a dynamic heterogeneous redundancy (DHR) architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jiangxing|first=WU|year=2016|title=Research on Cyber Mimic Defense|url=http://jcs.iie.ac.cn/ch/reader/create_pdf.aspx?file_no=20160401&amp;flag=1&amp;year_id=2016&amp;quarter_id=4|journal=Journal of Cyber Security|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
=== Composition and Operating Process of DHR ===
[[File:DHR.jpg|thumb|DHR architecture]]
The architecture of DHR is composed of the input agent, a set of heterogeneous components, dynamic selection algorithms, a set of executive entities and multi-mode arbitrators. In the diagram, the set of heterogeneous components and dynamic selection algorithms support the dynamic reconstruction in multi-dimension, which makes the set of executive entities dynamic. Multiple kinds of sets in which heterogeneous components are functionally equivalent can be combined by the software and hardware of standardization in module collection. The inputs are conveyed from the agent to &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; executive entities in set, represented as &lt;math&gt;A_1,A_2,...,A_n&lt;/math&gt; selected from the collection &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; in Dynamic selection algorithm. Finally, system outputs are provided from the arbitrating between the output vectors through the multi-mode arbitrator.

=== Mimic Bracket ===
In the DHR architecture, system inputs are conveyed from the input agent to every executive entity in the current set, and system outputs are provided from the arbitrating between the output vectors through the multi-mode arbitrator. We refer both of the input agent and multi-mode arbitrator as the Mimic Bracket (MB).

=== Mimic Defense Boundary in DHR ===
Mimic Bracket, the combination of the input agent and multi-mode arbitrator, is operated in independent physical or logical space but coordinated functionally. The Mimic Defense Boundary (MDB), also abbreviated for Mimic Boundary, is defined by the Mimic Bracket as a range of protection. MDB is usually a heterogeneous redundant environment operated with “toxics and Bacteria”, which contains unknown vulnerabilities, backdoors and other bugs of hardware and software or viruses, Trojans, and malicious codes. In this environment, heterogeneous executive entities under the condition of a certain functional input sequence, can give a complete consistent output sequence essentially.

=== The Anti-attack Feature of DHR ===
Firstly, the mechanisms of DHR can make the system show much uncertainty to the attacker within the controllable and cost acceptable range for the defender, which provides a powerful solution to security threats of the statically deterministic DRS. It can also force the inevitable human attack, different from the fault-error, into a risk control problem of minimum probability, which can normalize the threat of certainty or uncertainty into a reliability problem of stochastic failure according to the physical mechanism of DHR. Secondly, it is a big challenge to make precise cooperation between homogeneous redundant components according to the related researches. Hence the heterogeneous feature of DHR will make cooperation more difficult for attackers. Furthermore, dynamism and randomness can improve the uncertainty of multi-participatory actions with consistent or synergistic requirements. Last but not least, the multi-mode arbitrator significantly enhances the difficulty of cooperative attack under the condition of non-cooperation.

=== The Significance of DHR Construction ===
If the elements in the set of heterogeneous executive entities satisfying functional equivalence are scheduled in dynamic policies, or deploy the generalized dynamic technologies such as reconfiguration, recombination, reconstruction, redefinition, and virtualization themselves, we could simplify or weaken the harsh requirements of dissimilarity design accordingly in DRS. In the post-globalization era, this conclusion is  of great engineering significance for the application of trustability-uncontrollable components, including open source software, hardware or middleware and so on, to build a  safe and reliable system as well as to reduce the cost, in product life cycle over the open industrial chain and the supplying chain.

== Mimic Computing and Mimic Defense ==
Mimic computing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTotal-DXKX201407002.htm|title=Meaning and Vision of Mimic Computing and Mimic Security Defense--《Telecommunications Science》2014年07期|website=en.cnki.com.cn|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; can dynamically select the solution structure environment adaptively, according to different tasks, different time, different loads, different performance requirements, different resource conditions and parameters. Mimic computing can improve processing efficiency with the benefit of structure variable computing based on active cognition.

Mimic Defense fully mines the structure variable computing on the mechanism of endogenous anti-attack properties. As the external appearance is dynamic and random, the Mimic Computing system seems to be in active jumping or rapid migration irregularly in the vision of attackers in the time-space dimension among the diverse environments. It shows strongly dynamic, heterogeneous, random and other uncertain characteristics, disturbing the observation and the prediction, which will increase the difficulty and cost of constructing the attack chain based on vulnerability and backdoors.

In summary, mimic computing and mimic defense are based on a computing and processing architecture in essence, which is structure-variable under the condition of functionally equivalence. With the full use of structure variable computing, mimic computing can improve processing efficiency and mimic defense can provide the ability of active defense.

== Differences from Moving Target Defense (MTD) ==

=== Different Technology Roadmaps === 
Mimic Defense is a kind of architectural technology derived from fault tolerance in the field of reliability. Its fundamental form evolved from static DRS served as fault tolerance to DHR applied in intrusion tolerance. However, MTD is inspired by the idea of Encryption and Scrambler, which typically makes the instruction, address, or data of systems dynamic, random and diverse in order to increase the level of efforts required to achieve a successful compromise.

=== Different Technical Systems ===
The technical implementation of Mimic Defense is based on DHR, which has the intensive property with functions, reliability and security trinity. It is not necessary to expose technical details of the functional equivalent components of heterogeneous redundant hardware and software. MTD is a purely defensive technique which belongs to the simple "stack" of the non-systematic discrete technique, and it is not transparent to the protective object.

=== Different Implementation Space ===
Mimic Defense emphasizes on the implementation of a DHR architecture, which is operated in independent physical or logical space and correlated weakly with the operating mechanism of shared resource. MTD depends on the operating mechanism of shared resources, usually coexisting in the same processing space with objects, which seriously affects the objective performance of services due to the cost of processing resources.

=== Different Implementation Approaches ===
In Mimic Defense, it is requested that the object has functionally equivalent implementation support from the diverse hardware and software components as redundant. That is, in the premise of not affecting the service performance, the way to improve the security is a trade of the software and hardware resources while MTD mainly uses software to realize dynamic changes, diversification and randomization in the case of certain resource, in exchange for security by consuming the resources of the objective system and reducing the performance of the services.

=== Different Degrees of Attack Difficulty ===
The classic method of Mimic Defense is intended to build the redundant working environment with multi-mode judging mechanisms, composed of multiple dynamic reconfigurable components in functionally equivalence. When the same input arrives at heterogeneous executive entities, the only consistent output is intuitively generated by the intersection of functions in these entities through the multi-mode judging process. Any attack based on the specific implementation of one entity, including the attacks to multiple entities simultaneously, is hard to bypass the mimic judging mechanism under the condition of non-cooperation and turns out to be a failure. So for the attackers, it is necessary to solve the problem including not only the accessibility of attack packets and the availability of vulnerabilities, but also to achieve the consistent error expression through the cooperative attack dilemma under the condition of non-cooperation in heterogeneous multi-target space. It can overcome the impact of so many uncertainties while MTD can not provide such degrees of difficulty for attackers.

=== Different Capabilities of Attack Tolerance ===
Based on the benefit from the DHR structure in functionally equivalence, Mimic Defense keeps the fault tolerance and intrusion tolerance property in MDB as long as consistent mistakes arise by falling from the majority of executive entities at the same time. MTD emphasizes the functional recovery after the compromise, which is called resilience and tenacity. Obviously, the protective effect of the former is much higher than that of the latter.

=== Different Defense Objects ===
Mimic Defense is effective not only in defending the external attacks based on unknown vulnerabilities, backdoors, front doors, trapdoors, and etc., but also against the unknown viruses, Trojans and other penetration attacks. However, MTD only considers the impact of the unknown vulnerabilities.

=== Different Application Modes ===
Due to the differences between the two technical systems and implementation approaches, Mimic Defense can use both of open source products and COTS black-boxes whose credibility cannot be ensured, but MTD excessively depends on white-boxes on the contrary. So the former can avoid the most tremendous trouble from technology promotion, with more inclusiveness, openness and attractiveness, and turns out to have greater prospects for commercial promotion and researches.

== Differences from [[Trusted Computing|Trustable Computing]] ==

=== Mimic defense doesn’t belong to the technology of computational complexity ===
Mimic defense can’t distinguish between right and wrong from the results itself, which is computed or operated by components of hardware and software. It just refers to the situation of consistency, arbitrated between responsive outputs which are produced by heterogeneous redundant entities from the same input excitation, as a basis of recognition under the condition of functional equivalence. It is usually a big probability event that most of the expressions are consistent. This is considered as the law of identification with normal or abnormal states although it is easy to prove both in theory and practice that consistent error existing in most expressions is a minimal probability event. The key of breaking through the Mimic Defense system is the solution on how to obtain the consistent errors in most entities, achieving the escape stably, under the condition of non-cooperation and DHR environment at the same time. Trustable Computing, could be considered as a technique of encryption and belongs to the category of computational complexity technology which is not the same as Mimic defense in security principles.

=== Mimic defense doesn’t have credibility problems of the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) ===
The Mimic defense ruling refers to the majority or minority of outputs judged by the arbitrator, by using the relativity results as identification rules without any absolutely credible outputs except the correctness of the arbitrator. However, the "absolute security" of the Trusted Computing Base（TPM or TCM）is the fundamental of Trusted Computing, and is still controversial because of the unsettled problem that "who guarantees the credibility of TCB".

=== Mimic Defense is transparent to components of hardware and software ===
For heterogeneous redundancy components of hardware and software which are functionally equivalent in MDB, Mimic Defense does not need to make any analysis or customization and has only to operate in accordance with the process of the "black box" to directly apply  COTS-level products whose credibility cannot be ensured. It reduces the cost of the engineering during the realization of defensive techniques. While the object of Trusted Computing must have a degree of transparency so that analysis and intervention are inevitable during the process of implementation (often facing the hard situation in which there are only program files of executable codes), which brings a big challenge to the engineering implementation.

=== Mimic defense architecture have integrated functions ===
The Mimic defense architecture is intensive with functions. While providing active defense functions without priori knowledge, the system also gives service functions and the security function of high reliability. However, Trusted Computing only provides the security function and the function of fault detection in a certain level.

'''Diatomic carbon''' (systematically named '''dicarbon''' and '''1λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,2λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-ethene''', is a green, gaseous [[inorganic chemistry|inorganic]] [[chemical]] with the [[chemical formula]] C=C (also written {{Chem|[C|2|]}} or {{Chem|C|2}}). It is kinetically unstable at ambient temperature and pressure, being removed through autopolymerisation. It occurs in carbon vapor, for example in [[electric arc]]s; in [[comet]]s, [[stellar atmosphere]]s and the [[interstellar medium]]; and in blue [[hydrocarbon]] [[flame]]s.&lt;ref name="Hoffman1995"&gt;{{cite journal

Diatomic carbon is the second simplest form of carbon after [[atomic carbon]], and is an intermediate participator in the genesis of fullerenes.

== Properties ==

C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a component of carbon vapor. One paper estimates that carbon vapor is around 28% diatomic,&lt;ref name=singlet/&gt; but theoretically this depends on the temperature and pressure.

=== Electromagnetic properties ===

The electrons in diatomic carbon are distributed among the atomic orbitals according to the aufbau principle to produce unique quantum states, with corresponding energy levels. The state with the lowest energy level, or ground state, is a singlet state (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Σ{{Su|b=''g''|p=+}}), which is systematically named ethene-1,2-diylidene or dicarbon(0•). There are several excited singlet and triplet states that are relatively close in energy to the ground state, which form significant proportions of a sample of dicarbon under ambient conditions. When most of these excited states undergo photochemical relaxation, they emmit in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, one state in particular emmits in the green region. That state is a triplet state (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Π&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt;), which is systematically named ethene-μ,μ-diyl-μ-ylidene or dicarbon(2•). In addition, there is an excited state somewhat further in energy from the ground state, which only form a significant proportion of a sample of dicarbon under mid-ultraviolet irradiation. Upon relaxation, this excited state fluoresces in the violet region and phosphoresces in the blue region. This state is also a singlet state (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Π&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt;), which is also named ethene-μ,μ-diyl-μ-ylidene or dicarbon(2•).

[[Molecular orbital theory]] shows that there are two sets of paired electrons in a degenerate pi bonding set of orbitals. This gives a bond order of 2, meaning that there should exist a double bond between the two carbons in a C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule.&lt;ref name = Zhong /&gt; One analysis suggests instead that a [[quadruple bond]] exists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Quadruple bonding in C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and analogous eight-valence electron species

[[CASSCF]] calculations indicate that the quadruple bond based on molecular orbital theory is also reasonable.&lt;ref name = Zhong&gt;{{cite journal|title = Latent harmony in dicarbon between VB and MO theories through orthogonal hybridization of 3σ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; and 2σ&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;|first1 = Ronglin|last1 = Zhong|first2 = Min|last2 = Zhang|first3 = Hongliang|last3 = Xu|first4 = Zhongmin|last4 = Su|journal = [[Chemical Science (journal)|Chemical Science]]|year = 2016|volume = 7|pages = 1028–1032|doi = 10.1039/c5sc03437j}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bond dissociation energy|Bond dissociation energies]] of [[Boron|B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and [[Nitrogen|N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] show increasing BDE, indicating single, double, and triple bonds, respectively.

In certain forms of crystalline carbon, such as diamond and graphite, a saddle point or “hump” occurs at the bond site in the charge density. The triplet state of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; does follow this trend. However, the singlet state of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; acts more like silicon or germanium; that is, the charge density has a maximum at the bond site.&lt;ref name= high&gt;{{cite journal | title = Higher-order finite-difference pseudopotential method: An application to diatomic molecules | last1 = Chelikowsky | first1 = James R. | authorlink1 = James R.

* [[Triplet state|Triplet]] C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules will react through an intermolecular pathway, which is shown to exhibit radical character. The intermediate for this pathway is the ethylene radical. Its abstraction is correlated with bond energies.&lt;ref name="singlet" /&gt;
* [[Singlet state|Singlet]] C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules will react through an intramolecular, nonradical pathway in which two hydrogen atoms will be taken away from one molecule. The intermediate for this pathway is singlet [[vinylidene]]. The singlet reaction can happen through a 1,1-diabstraction or a 1,2-diabstraction. This reaction is insensitive to isotope substitution. The different abstractions are possibly due to the spatial orientations of the collisions rather than the bond energies.&lt;ref name="singlet" /&gt;
* Singlet C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will also react with [[alkene]]s. Acetylene is a major product; however, it appears C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will insert into carbon-hydrogen bonds.

The '''Dura-Europos synagogue''' (or "Dura Europas", "Dura Europos" etc.) was an ancient synagogue uncovered at [[Dura-Europos]], [[Syria]], in 1932. The last phase of construction was dated by an [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] inscription to 244 [[Common Era|CE]], making it one of the oldest synagogues in the world. It was unique among the many ancient synagogues that have emerged from [[archaeological]] digs as the structure was preserved virtually intact, and it had extensive [[Figurative art|figurative]] wall-paintings, which came as a considerable surprise to scholars.  These paintings are now displayed in the [[National Museum of Damascus]].

Dura-Europos was a small garrison and trading city on the [[river Euphrates]], and usually on the frontier between the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] and the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and finally the [[Sassanid Empire]]s of [[Persia]].  It changed hands at various points but was Roman from 165 CE.  Before the final Persian destruction of the town in 256-257 CE, parts of the synagogue which abutted the main city wall were apparently requisitioned and filled with sand as a defensive measure.  The city was abandoned after its fall and never resettled, and the lower walls of the rooms remained buried and largely intact until excavated. The excavations discovered also very important wall-paintings from places of worship of Christianity, at the [[Dura-Europos church]], and [[Mithraism]], and fragmentary Christian texts in [[Hebrew]].

In the [[Syrian Civil War]], the site was occupied by [[ISIL]], and what was left there appears to have been destroyed.

==Wall-paintings==
Because of the paintings adorning the walls, the synagogue was at first mistaken for a Greek temple, though this was quickly corrected by the vice-director of excavations [[Robert du Mesnil du Buisson]] in ''Les peintures de la synagogue de Doura-Europos'' (Rome, 1939). Mesnil also made detailed comparisons of the friezes from the Dura synagogue with those of the [[mithraeum]], the Christian baptistery, and the temple of the [[Palmyra|Palmyrene]] gods.&lt;ref&gt;Guitty Azarpay ''Sogdian Painting: The Pictorial Epic in Oriental Art'' 1981 Page 147 "For a comparison of the arrangement of the friezes from the Dura synagogue and those of the mithraeum, the Christian baptistery and the temple of the Palmyrene gods, see Comte R. Du Mesnil du Buisson, Les peintures de la synagogue de ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

The synagogue contains a forecourt and house of assembly with painted walls depicting people and animals, and a [[Torah]] shrine in the western wall facing [[Jerusalem]]. The paintings cover the walls of the main "Assembly Room", using three levels of pictures over a [[dado (architecture)|dado]] [[frieze]] of symbols in most places, reaching a height of about 7 metres.  The scenes depicted are drawn from the [[Hebrew Bible]] and include many narrative scenes, and some single figure "portraits"—58 scenes in total, probably representing about 60% of the original number.  They include the ''[[Sacrifice of Isaac]]'' and other [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] stories, [[Moses]] receiving the [[Tablets of the Law]], Moses leading the [[Hebrews]] out of [[Egypt]], the visions of [[Ezekiel]], and many others.  The [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] [[motif (visual arts)|motif]] is used to represent divine intervention or approval in several paintings.  Scholars cannot agree on the subjects of some scenes, because of damage, or the lack of comparative examples.

Stylistically they are provincial versions of contemporary Graeco-Roman style and technique; several different artists seem to have worked on them. Technically they are not [[fresco]] (paint fused into wet plaster) but [[tempera]] over plaster. Earlier parts of the building have decorative painting with no figures. Some of the paintings have figures whose eyes have been scratched out, especially those in Persian costume.

Scholars think the paintings were used as an instructional display to educate and teach the history and laws of the religion. Some think that this synagogue was painted in order to compete with the many other religions practiced in Dura Europos; the new (and considerably smaller) Christian church ([[Dura-Europos church]]) appears to have opened shortly before the surviving paintings were begun in the synagogue.  The large-scale pictorial art in the synagogue came as a surprise to scholars, although they already suspected that there was a tradition of Jewish narrative religious art at this period, which had all been lost, leaving only traces in later Christian art.  The discovery of the synagogue helps to dispel narrow interpretations of Judaism's historical prohibition of visual images.

The '''Elgin Marbles''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|l|ɡ|ɪ|n}}), also known as the '''Parthenon Marbles''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Γλυπτά του Παρθενώνα), are a collection of [[Classical Greece|Classical Greek]] [[marble sculpture]]s made under the supervision of the architect and sculptor [[Phidias]] and his assistants. They were originally part of the [[Parthenon|temple of the Parthenon]] and other buildings on the [[Acropolis of Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/article_index/w/what_are_the_elgin_marbles.aspx|title=What are the 'Elgin Marbles'?|publisher=britishmuseum.org|accessdate=2009-05-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420232511/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/article_index/w/what_are_the_elgin_marbles.aspx|archive-date=20 April 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Elgin-Marbles|title=Elgin Marbles&amp;nbsp;– Greek sculpture |work= [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | accessdate = 2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1801 to 1812, agents of [[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin]] removed about half of the surviving sculptures of the Parthenon, as well as sculptures from the [[Propylaea]] and [[Erechtheum]].&lt;ref name=BritB&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Elgin Marbles, 2008, O.Ed.&lt;/ref&gt; The Marbles were transported by sea to Britain.

After [[Greek War of Independence|gaining its independence]] from the Ottoman Empire in 1832, the newly found Greek state began a series of projects to restore its monuments and retrieve looted art. It has expressed its disapproval of Elgin's removal of the Marbles from the Acropolis and the Parthenon,&lt;ref name="Ministry of Culture: The Background of the Removal"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://odysseus.culture.gr/a/1/12/ga125.html |title=The Background of the Removal |publisher=Greek Ministry of Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is regarded as one of the world's greatest cultural monuments.&lt;ref name="UNESCO: Acropolis, Athens"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/404 |title=Acropolis, Athens |publisher=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; International efforts to repatriate the Marbles to Greece were intensified in the 1980s by then Greek Minister of Culture [[Melina Mercouri]], and there are now many organisations actively campaigning for the Marbles' return, several united as part of the [[International Association for the Reunification of the Parthenon Sculptures]]. The [[Greek government]] itself continues to urge the return of the marbles to [[Athens]] so as to be unified with the remaining marbles and for the complete [[Parthenon Frieze|Parthenon frieze sequence]] to be restored, through diplomatic, political and legal means.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-greece-marbles/greece-wants-parthenon-marbles-back-tsipras-tells-may-idUSKBN1JM2T6&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[UNESCO]] offered to mediate between Greece and the [[United Kingdom]] to resolve the dispute, although this was later turned down by the British Museum on the basis that UNESCO works with government bodies, not trustees of museums.&lt;ref name="UNESCO Letter to British Government for the return of Parthenon's Marbles"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.iemc-unesco.org/unesco-letter-to-british-government-for-the-return-of-parthenons-marbles/ |title=UNESCO Letter to British Government for the return of Parthenon's Marbles |publisher=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UK has not written back to UNESCO Letter"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CLT/19_ICPRCP_Recommendations_en_final.pdf |title=UK has not written back to UNESCO Letter |publisher=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elgin Marbles: UK declines mediation over Parthenon sculptures|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32204548|website=BBC News|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1798 the Earl of Elgin was appointed as "Ambassador Extraordinary and [[Plenipotentiary|Minister Plenipotentiary]] of His Britannic Majesty to the Sublime Porte of [[Selim III]], Sultan of Turkey" (Greece was then [[Ottoman Greece|part of the Ottoman Empire]]). Before his departure to take up the post he had approached officials of the British government to inquire if they would be interested in employing artists to take casts and drawings of the sculptured portions of the Parthenon. According to Lord Elgin, "the answer of the Government&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;was entirely negative."&lt;ref name="Casey" /&gt;

Lord Elgin decided to carry out the work himself, and employed artists to take casts and drawings under the supervision of the [[Parthenopaean Republic|Neapolitan]] court painter, [[Giovanni Battista Lusieri|Giovani Lusieri]].&lt;ref name="Casey" /&gt; According to a Turkish local, [[marble]] sculptures that fell were being burned to obtain [[lime (material)|lime]] for building.&lt;ref name="Casey" /&gt; Although his original intention was only to document the sculptures, in 1801 Lord Elgin began to remove material from the Parthenon and its surrounding structures&lt;ref name="guardian faq"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/jul/21/highereducation.parthenon |title=Elgin Marbles: fact or fiction? |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2004-07-21|accessdate=2009-06-25 | location=London | first=Dorothy | last=King}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the supervision of Lusieri. Pieces were also removed from the [[Erechtheion]], the [[Propylaia]], and the [[Temple of Athena Nike]], all inside the [[Acropolis]].

The excavation and removal was completed in 1812 at a personal cost to Elgin of around £70,000.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Online{{Cite news|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/184554/Elgin-Marbles |title=Elgin Marbles |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |date= |accessdate=2011-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elgin intended to use the marbles to decorate [[Broomhall House]], his private home near [[Dunfermline]] in Scotland,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/19/books/books-of-the-times-refueling-the-elgin-marbles-debate.html&lt;/ref&gt; but a costly divorce suit forced him to sell them to settle his debts.&lt;ref&gt;As reported by John E. Simmons in: [https://web.archive.org/web/20170109104920/https://books.google.com/books?id=wCFsDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT167&amp;lpg=PT167&amp;dq= Museums: A History], chapter 7, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 07.07.2016 - 326 pages&lt;/ref&gt; Elgin sold the Parthenon Marbles to the British government for less than it cost him to procure them, declining higher offers from other potential buyers, including [[Napoleon]].&lt;ref name="guardian faq"/&gt;

==Description==
{{Main article|Parthenon Frieze|Metopes of the Parthenon}}
The Parthenon Marbles acquired by Elgin include some 21 figures from the statuary from the east and west [[pediment]]s, 15 of an original 92 [[Metope (architecture)|metope]] panels depicting battles between the [[Lapiths]] and the [[Centaur]]s, as well as 75 meters of the [[Parthenon Frieze]] which decorated the horizontal course set above the interior architrave of the temple. As such, they represent more than half of what now remains of the surviving sculptural decoration of the Parthenon.

Elgin's acquisitions also included objects from other buildings on the [[Acropolis of Athens|Athenian Acropolis]]: a [[Caryatid]] from [[Erechtheum]]; four slabs from the parapet frieze of the [[Temple of Athena Nike]]; and a number of other [[Architecture|architectural]] fragments of the Parthenon, Propylaia, Erechtheum, the Temple of Athene Nike, and the [[Treasury of Atreus]].

==Legality of the removal from Athens==
The Acropolis was at that time an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] military fort, so Elgin required special permission to enter the site, the Parthenon, and the surrounding buildings. He stated that he had obtained a [[firman (decree)|firman]] from the [[Sultan]] which allowed his artists to access the site, but he was unable to produce the original documentation. However, Elgin presented a document claimed to be an English translation of an [[Italian language|Italian]] copy made at the time. This document is now kept in the British Museum.&lt;ref&gt;St Clair, William: Lord Elgin and the Marbles. Oxford University Press, USA, 3 edition (17 July 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Its authenticity has been questioned, as it lacked the formalities characterising edicts from the sultan. Vassilis Demetriades, Professor of Turkish Studies at the University of Crete, has argued that "any expert in Ottoman diplomatic language can easily ascertain that the original of the document which has survived was not a firman".&lt;ref name=firman/&gt; The document was recorded in an appendix of an 1816 parliamentary committee report. [https://books.google.com/books?id=NwUFAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=RA1-PR1&amp;ots=GiMElOqrbf&amp;dq=lord%20elgin%20testified%201816%20british%20parliamentary%20committee&amp;hl=el&amp;pg=PA35#v=onepage&amp;q=lord%20elgin%20testified%201816%20british%20parliamentary%20committee&amp;f=false  'The committee permission'] had convened to examine a request by Elgin asking the British government to purchase the Marbles. The report said that the document&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parthenon.newmentor.net/firman.htm|title=firman|work=newmentor.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the appendix was an accurate translation, in English, of an Ottoman firman dated July 1801. In Elgin's view it amounted to an Ottoman authorisation to remove the marbles. The committee was told that the original document was given to Ottoman officials in Athens in 1801. Researchers have so far failed to locate it despite the fact that the Ottoman archives in Istanbul still hold a number of similar documents dating from the same period.&lt;ref name=Nation/&gt;

The parliamentary record shows that the Italian copy of the firman was not presented to the committee by Elgin himself but by one of his associates, the clergyman Rev. [[Philip Hunt (priest)|Philip Hunt]]. Hunt, who at the time resided in Bedford, was the last witness to appear before the committee and stated that he had in his possession an Italian translation of the Ottoman original. He went on to explain that he had not brought the document, because, upon leaving Bedford, he was not aware that he was to testify as a witness. The English document in the parliamentary report was filed by Hunt, but the committee was not presented with the Italian translation in Hunt's possession. William St. Clair, a contemporary biographer of Lord Elgin, said he possessed Hunt's Italian document and "vouches for the accuracy of the English translation". The committee report states on page 69 "(Signed with a signet.) Seged Abdullah Kaimacan" - however, the document presented to the committee was "an English translation of this purported translation into Italian of the original ''firman''",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Kate Fitz |last=Gibbon |title=Who Owns the Past?: Cultural Policy, Cultural Property, and the Law |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=2005 |pages=115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and had neither signet nor signature on it, a fact corroborated by St. Clair.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"&gt;{{cite journal |first=David |last=Rudenstine |title=Did Elgin cheat the Marbles? |journal=[[The Nation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1967 study by British historian William St. Clair, ''Lord Elgin and the Marbles,'' stated the sultan did not allow the removal of statues and reliefs from the Parthenon. The study judged a clause authorizing the British to take stones “with old inscriptions and figures” probably meant items in the excavations the site, not the art decorating the temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/archaeology-and-history/magazine/2017/03-04/parthenon-sculptures-british-museum-controversy/?sf72336468=1|title=How the Parthenon Lost Its Marbles|date=2017-03-28|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The document allowed Elgin and his team to erect scaffolding so as to make drawings and mouldings in [[chalk]] or [[gypsum]], as well as to measure the remains of the ruined buildings and excavate the foundations which may have become covered in the [''ghiaja'' (meaning gravel, debris)]; and "...that when they wish to take away [''qualche'' (meaning 'some' or 'a few')] pieces of stone with old inscriptions or figures thereon, that no opposition be made thereto". The interpretation of these lines has been questioned even by non-restitutionalists,&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite journal |first=John Henry |last=Merryman |title=Thinking about the Elgin Marbles |journal=[[Michigan Law Review]] |volume=83 |issue=8 |year=1985 |pages=1898–1899 |doi=10.2307/1288954}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;English translation of the firman {{cite web|url=http://www.greece.org/parthenon/marbles/firman.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510201851/http://www.greece.org/parthenon/marbles/firman.htm |archivedate=10 May 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly the word ''qualche'', which in modern language should be translated as ''a few'' but can also mean ''any''. According to non-restitutionalists, further evidence that the removal of the sculptures by Elgin was approved by the Ottoman authorities is shown by a second firman which was required for the shipping of the marbles from the Piraeus.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;{{cite book |first=John Henry |last=Merryman |chapter=Whither the Elgin Marbles? |title=Imperialism, Art And Restitution |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many have questioned the legality of Elgin's actions, including the legitimacy of the documentation purportedly authorising them. A study by Professor [[David Rudenstine]] of the [[Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law]] concluded that the premise that Elgin obtained legal title to the marbles, which he then transferred to the British government, "is certainly not established and may well be false".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rudenstine |first=David |title=The Legality of Elgin's Taking: A Review Essay of Four Books on the Parthenon Marbles |journal=International Journal of Cultural Property |volume=8 |issue=1 |year=1999 |pages=356–376 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rudenstine's argumentation is partly based on a translation discrepancy he noticed between the surviving Italian document and the English text submitted by Hunt to the parliamentary committee. The text from the committee report reads "We therefore have written this Letter to you, and expedited it by Mr. Philip Hunt, an English Gentleman, Secretary of the aforesaid Ambassador" but according to the St. Clair Italian document the actual wording is "We therefore have written this letter to you and expedited it by N.N.". In Rudenstine's view, this substitution of "Mr. Philip Hunt" with the initials "N.N." can hardly be a simple mistake. He further argues that the document was presented after the committee's insistence that some form of Ottoman written authorisation for the removal of the marbles be provided, a fact known to Hunt by the time he testified. Thus, according to Rudenstine, "Hunt put himself in a position in which he could simultaneously vouch for the authenticity of the document and explain why he alone had a copy of it fifteen years after he surrendered the original to Ottoman officials in Athens". On two earlier occasions, Elgin stated that the Ottomans gave him written permissions more than once, but that he had "retained none of them." Hunt testified on March 13, and one of the questions asked was "Did you ever see any of the written permissions which were granted to [Lord Elgin] for removing the Marbles from the Temple of Minerva?" to which Hunt answered "yes", adding that he possessed an Italian translation of the original firman. Nonetheless, he did not explain why he had retained the translation for 15 years, whereas Elgin, who had testified two weeks earlier, knew nothing about the existence of any such document.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6" /&gt;

English travel writer [[Edward Daniel Clarke]], an eyewitness, wrote that the [[Dizdar]], the Ottoman fortress commander on the scene, attempted to stop the removal of the metopes but was bribed to allow it to continue.&lt;ref name="Edward Daniel Clarke 1818 223ff"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Edward Daniel Clarke |title= Travels in various Countries of Europe, Asia and Africa Part the Second Greece Egypt and the Holy Land Section the Second Fourth Edition Volume the Sixth |publisher=T. Cadell |location=London |year=1818 |page= 223ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In contrast, John Merryman, Sweitzer Professor of Law at [[Stanford Law School]] and also Professor of Art at [[Stanford University]], putting aside the discrepancy presented by Rudenstine, argues that since the Ottomans had controlled Athens since 1460, their claims to the artefacts were legal and recognisable. The Ottoman [[sultan]] was grateful to the British for repelling [[Napoleon]]ic expansion, and the Parthenon marbles had no sentimental value to him.&lt;ref name="guardian faq"/&gt; Further, that written permission exists in the form of the firman, which is the most formal kind of permission available from that government, and that Elgin had further permission to export the marbles, legalises his (and therefore the British Museum's) claim to the Marbles.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5" /&gt; He does note, though, that the clause concerning the extent of Ottoman authorisation to remove the marbles "is at best ambiguous", adding that the document "provides slender authority for the massive removals from the Parthenon&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;The reference to 'taking away any pieces of stone' seems incidental, intended to apply to objects found while excavating. That was certainly the interpretation privately placed on the firman by several of the Elgin party, including Lady Elgin. Publicly, however, a different attitude was taken, and the work of dismantling the sculptures on the Parthenon and packing them for shipment to England began in earnest. In the process, Elgin's party damaged the structure, leaving the Parthenon not only denuded of its sculptures but further ruined by the process of removal. It is certainly arguable that Elgin exceeded the authority granted in the firman in both respects".&lt;ref name="NafzigerPaterson2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=James A. R.

The issue of firmans of this nature, along with universally required bribes, was not unusual at this time: In 1801 for example, [[Edward Daniel Clarke|Edward Clarke]] and his assistant Cripps, obtained an authorisation from the governor of Athens for the removal of a statue of the goddess [[Demeter]] which was at [[Eleusis]], with the intervention of Italian artist [[Giovanni Battista Lusieri]] who was Lord Elgin's assistant at the time.&lt;ref name="Fagan2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Fagan|title=From Stonehenge to Samarkand: An Anthology of Archaeological Travel Writing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p-f-24-8negC&amp;pg=PA54|date=20 July 2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-516091-8|page=54|quote=Clarke and Cripps greatly admired the statue, which weighed over 2 tons (1.8 tonnes) and decided to take it to England.

==Contemporary reaction{{anchor | Criticism by Elgin's contemporaries}}==
[[File:Temporary Elgin Room at the Museum in 1819.jpg|thumb|300px|A portrait depicting the Elgin Marbles in a temporary Elgin Room at the [[British Museum]] surrounded by museum staff, a trustee and visitors, 1819]]
When the marbles were shipped to England, they were "an instant success among many"&lt;ref name="Casey"/&gt; who admired the sculptures and supported their arrival, but both the sculptures and Elgin also received criticism from detractors. Lord Elgin began negotiations for the sale of the collection to the British Museum in 1811, but negotiations failed despite the support of British artists&lt;ref name="Casey"/&gt; after the government showed little interest. Many Britons opposed purchase of the statues because they were in bad condition and therefore did not display the "ideal beauty" found in other sculpture collections.&lt;ref name="Casey"/&gt;  The following years marked an increased interest in classical Greece, and in June 1816, after parliamentary hearings, the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] offered £35,000 in exchange for the sculptures. Even at the time the acquisition inspired much debate, although it was supported by "many persuasive calls" for the purchase.&lt;ref name="Casey"/&gt;

[[Lord Byron]] strongly objected to the removal of the marbles from [[Greece]], denouncing Elgin as a vandal.&lt;ref name=BritA/&gt; His point of view about the removal of the Marbles from Athens is also mentioned in his narrative poem ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage]]'', published in 1812, which itself was largely inspired by Byron's travels around the Mediterranean and the [[Aegean Sea]] between 1809 and 1811:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.elginism.com/20040720/90/ |title=The story of the Elgin Marbles
|publisher=International Herald Tribune |date=2004-07-14 |accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Dull is the eye that will not weep to see
:Thy walls defaced, thy mouldering shrines removed
:By British hands, which it had best behoved
:To guard those relics ne'er to be restored.
:Curst be the hour when from their isle they roved,
:And once again thy hapless bosom gored,
:And snatch'd thy shrinking gods to northern climes abhorred!

Byron was not the only one to protest against the removal at the time:
:"The Honourable Lord has taken advantage of the most unjustifiable means and has committed the most flagrant pillages. It was, it seems, fatal that a representative of our country loot those objects that the Turks and other barbarians had considered sacred," said [[Sir John Newport, 1st Baronet|Sir John Newport]].&lt;ref name="newsweek stones"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/200852 |title=Romancing the Stones |publisher=Newsweek |date= |accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Daniel Clarke]] witnessed the removal of the metopes and called the action a "spoliation", writing that "thus the form of the temple has sustained a greater injury than it had already experienced from the Venetian artillery," and that "neither was there a workman employed in the undertaking ... who did not express his concern that such havoc should be deemed necessary, after moulds and casts had been already made of all the sculpture which it was designed to remove."&lt;ref name="Edward Daniel Clarke 1818 223ff"/&gt; When Sir [[Francis Ronalds]] visited Athens and [[Giovanni Battista Lusieri]] in 1820, he wrote that "If Lord Elgin had possessed real taste in lieu of a covetous spirit he would have done just the reverse of what he has, he would have removed the rubbish and left the antiquities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sirfrancisronalds.co.uk/athens.html|title=Sir Francis Ronalds' Travel Journal: Athens|website=Sir Francis Ronalds and his Family|access-date=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A parliamentary committee investigating the situation concluded that the monuments were best given "asylum" under a "free government" such as the British one.&lt;ref name="Casey"/&gt; In 1810, Elgin published a defence of his actions,&lt;ref name=BritB/&gt; but the subject remained controversial.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}&lt;!-- Obviously they're controversial now, but citation needed that they remained controversial in Britain at that time.--&gt; [[John Keats]] viewed them in 1817 when they were exhibited in the British Museum, hence his famous [[sonnet]] about the marbles titled "On Seeing the Elgin Marbles". Notable supporters of Elgin included the painter [[Benjamin Robert Haydon]].&lt;ref name="Casey"/&gt;

A public debate in Parliament followed Elgin's publication, and Parliament again exonerated Elgin's actions. Parliament decided to purchase the marbles for the "British nation" in 1816 by a vote of 82–30 for £35,000.&lt;ref name=BritA/&gt; They were deposited in the British Museum, where they were displayed in the Elgin Saloon (constructed in 1832), until the [[Duveen Gallery]] was completed in 1939. Crowds packed the British Museum to view the sculptures, setting attendance records for the museum.&lt;ref name="Casey"/&gt; [[William Wordsworth]] viewed the marbles at the museum and commented favourably on their aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=William Wordsworth |title=The Poetical Works of William Wordsworth |publisher=W.

==Damage==

===Morosini===
[[File:Elgin Marbles east pediment.jpg|thumb|East Pediment]]
Prior damage to the marbles was sustained during successive wars, and it was during such conflicts that the Parthenon and its artwork sustained, by far, the most extensive damage. In particular, an explosion ignited by [[Venetian Republic|Venetian]] gun and cannon-fire bombardment in 1687, whilst the Parthenon was used as a munitions store during the [[Ottoman Greece|Ottoman rule]], destroyed or damaged many pieces of Parthenon art, including some of that later taken by Lord Elgin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://traumwerk.stanford.edu:3455/Archaeopaedia/198 |title=Stanford Archaeopedia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314025855/http://traumwerk.stanford.edu:3455/Archaeopaedia/198 |archivedate=14 March 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was this explosion that sent the marble roof, most of the [[cella]] walls, 14 columns from the north and south [[peristyle]]s, and carved metopes and frieze blocks flying and crashing to the ground, destroying much of the artwork. Further damage to the Parthenon's artwork occurred when the Venetian general [[Francesco Morosini]] looted the site of its larger sculptures. The tackle he was using to remove the sculptures proved to be faulty and snapped, dropping an over-life-sized sculpture of [[Poseidon]] and the horses of [[Athena]]'s chariot from the west pediment on to the rock of the Acropolis {{convert|40|ft}} below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521820936&amp;ss=exc|title=The Parthenon|work=cambridge.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===War of Independence===
The [[Erechtheion]] was used as a munitions store by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] during the [[Greek War of Independence]]&lt;ref name=Erechtheion&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.culture.gr/h/3/eh351.jsp?obj_id=2384 |title=History |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203021650/http://www.culture.gr/h/3/eh351.jsp?obj_id=2384 |archivedate=3 February 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1821–1833) which ended the 355-year Ottoman rule of Athens. The Acropolis was besieged twice during the war, first [[Siege of the Acropolis (1821–22)|by the Greeks]] in 1821–22 and then [[Siege of the Acropolis (1826–27)|by the Ottoman forces]] in 1826–27. During the first siege the besieged Ottoman forces attempted to melt the lead in the columns to cast bullets, even prompting the Greeks to offer their own bullets to the Ottomans in order to minimize damage.&lt;ref name=Hitchens&gt;Hitchens Christopher, ''The Elgin Marbles: Should They Be Returned to Greece?'', 1998, p.viii, {{ISBN|1-85984-220-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elgin===
Elgin consulted with Italian sculptor [[Antonio Canova]] in 1803 about how best to restore the marbles. Canova was considered by some to be the world's best sculptural restorer of the time; Elgin wrote that Canova declined to work on the marbles for fear of damaging them further.&lt;ref name="Casey"/&gt;

To facilitate transport by Elgin, the columns' capitals and many metopes and frieze slabs were either hacked off the main structure or sawn and sliced into smaller sections, causing irreparable damage to the Parthenon itself.&lt;ref name="Greek Ministry of Culture: Memorandum on the Parthenon Marbles"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yppo.gr/4/marm/memorandum-gr.pdf |title=Greek Government's Memorandum |publisher=Greek Ministry of Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/28/arts/design/28ouro.html?_r=3&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;oref=slogin Where Gods Yearn for Long-Lost Treasures] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016235933/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/28/arts/design/28ouro.html?_r=3&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;oref=slogin |date=16 October 2015 }}, ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; One shipload of marbles on board the British brig ''Mentor'' &lt;ref name="The Wreck of the Mentor on the Coast of the Island of Kythera and the Operation to Retrieve, Salvage, and Transport the Parthenon Sculptures to London"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/376886/_The_Wreck_of_the_Mentor_on_the_Coast_of_the_Island_of_Kythera_and_the_Operation_to_Retrieve_Salvage_and_Transport_the_Parthenon_Sculptures_to_London_1802-1805_ |title=The Wreck of the Mentor on the Coast of the Island of Kythera and the Operation to Retrieve, Salvage, and Transport the Parthenon Sculptures to London (1802-1805) |publisher=Arts Books, Athens}}&lt;/ref&gt; was caught in a storm off [[Cape Matapan]] in southern Greece and sank near [[Kythera]], but was salvaged at the Earl's personal expense;&lt;ref name="British Museum releases"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/news_and_press_releases/statements/parthenon_sculptures/parthenon_-_facts_and_figures.aspx |title=The Parthenon Sculptures |publisher=British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; it took two years to bring them to the surface.

The artefacts held in London suffered from 19th-century pollution which persisted until the mid-20th century and have suffered irreparable damage by previous cleaning methods employed by British Museum staff.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Andrew Oddy|Oddy, Andrew]], "The Conservation of Marble Sculptures in the British Museum before 1975", in ''Studies in Conservation'', vol. 47, no.3, (2002), p.145–146, Quote: "However, for a short time in the late 1930s copper scrapers were used to remove areas of discolouration from the surface of the Elgin Marbles. New information is presented about this lamentable episode."&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1838, scientist [[Michael Faraday]] was asked to provide a solution to the problem of the deteriorating surface of the marbles. The outcome is described in the following excerpt from the letter he sent to Henry Milman, a commissioner for the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William Andrew Oddy|Oddy, Andrew]], "The Conservation of Marble Sculptures in the British Museum before 1975", in ''Studies in Conservation'', vol. 47, no.3, (2002), p.146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, I., '"Sir, they are scrubbing the Elgin Marbles!"&amp;nbsp;– some controversial cleanings of the Parthenon Sculptures', ''Minerva'' 10(6) (1999) 43-45.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The marbles generally were very dirty&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;from a deposit of dust and soot.&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;I found the body of the marble beneath the surface white.&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;The application of water, applied by a sponge or soft cloth, removed the coarsest dirt.&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;The use of fine, gritty powder, with the water and rubbing, though it more quickly removed the upper dirt, left much embedded in the cellular surface of the marble. I then applied alkalies, both carbonated and caustic; these quickened the loosening of the surface dirt&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;but they fell far short of restoring the marble surface to its proper hue and state of cleanliness. I finally used dilute nitric acid, and even this failed.&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;The examination has made me despair of the possibility of presenting the marbles in the British Museum in that state of purity and whiteness which they originally possessed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A further effort to clean the marbles ensued in 1858. [[Richard Westmacott]], who was appointed superintendent of the "moving and cleaning the sculptures" in 1857, in a letter approved by the British Museum Standing Committee on 13 March 1858 concluded&lt;ref&gt;[[William Andrew Oddy|Oddy, Andrew]], "The Conservation of Marble Sculptures in the British Museum before 1975", in ''Studies in Conservation'', vol. 47, no.3, (2002), p.148&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I think it my duty to say that some of the works are much damaged by ignorant or careless moulding&amp;nbsp;– with oil and lard&amp;nbsp;– and by restorations in wax and resin. These mistakes have caused discolouration. I shall endeavour to remedy this without, however, having recourse to any composition that can injure the surface of the marble.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Yet another effort to clean the marbles occurred in 1937–38. This time the incentive was provided by the construction of a new Gallery to house the collection. The Pentelic marble mined from [[Mount Pentelicus]] north of Athens, from which the sculptures are made, naturally acquires a tan colour similar to honey when exposed to air; this colouring is often known as the marble's "patina"&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Ernest Arthur: A Handbook of Greek Sculpture.

The tools used were seven scrapers, one chisel and a piece of [[Silicon carbide|carborundum]] stone. They are now deposited in the British Museum's Department of Preservation.&lt;ref name="oddy149"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BMScandal&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/543077.stm|title=Museum admits 'scandal' of Elgin Marbles|work=[[BBC News Online]] | date=1999-12-01 | accessdate=2010-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cleaning process scraped away some of the detailed tone of many carvings.&lt;ref&gt;Paterakis AB.

The British Museum has responded with the statement that "mistakes were made at that time."&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/parthenon/article/0,,195563,00.html mistakes were made at that time]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605154549/http://www.guardian.co.uk/parthenon/article/0%2C%2C195563%2C00.html |date=5 June 2008 }}, ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; On another occasion it was said that "the damage had been exaggerated for political reasons" and that "the Greeks were guilty of excessive cleaning of the marbles before they were brought to Britain."&lt;ref name=BMScandal/&gt; During the international symposium on the cleaning of the marbles, organised by the British Museum in 1999, curator [[Ian Jenkins (curator)|Ian Jenkins]], deputy keeper of Greek and Roman antiquities, remarked that "The British Museum is not infallible, it is not the Pope. Its history has been a series of good intentions marred by the occasional cock-up, and the 1930s cleaning was such a cock-up". Nonetheless, he claimed that the prime cause for the damage inflicted upon the marbles was the 2000-year-long weathering on the Acropolis.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/dec/01/maevkennedy |title=Mutual attacks mar Elgin Marbles debate | work=[[The Guardian]]

American archeologist [[Dorothy King]], in a newspaper article, wrote that techniques similar to the ones used in 1937–38 were applied by Greeks as well in more recent decades than the British, and maintained that Italians still find them acceptable.&lt;ref name="guardian faq"/&gt; The British Museum said that a similar cleaning of the [[Temple of Hephaestus]] in the [[Ancient Agora of Athens|Athenian Agora]] was carried out by the conservation team of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;J.

==Relocation debate==

===Rationale for returning to Athens===

Those arguing for the Marbles' return claim legal, moral and artistic grounds. Their arguments include:

* The main stated aim of the Greek campaign is to reunite the Parthenon sculptures around the world in order to restore "organic elements" which "at present remain without cohesion, homogeneity and historicity of the monument to which they belong" and allow visitors to better appreciate them as a whole;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://odysseus.culture.gr/a/1/12/ea121.html |title=Hellenic Ministry of Culture, Special Issues |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017204203/http://odysseus.culture.gr/a/1/12/ea121.html |archivedate=17 October 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicoletta Divari-Valakou 2008"&gt;Nicoletta Divari-Valakou, (Director of the Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities of Athens), "Revisiting the Parthenon: National Heritage in the Age of Globalism" in Mille Gabriel &amp; Jens Dahl, (eds.)

The debate hits Sydney"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sydney.edu.au/senate/documents/History/Elgin_marbles_articles.pdf |title=Debate of the Elgin Marbles |publisher=University of Sydney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Returning the Parthenon sculptures (it should be noted that Greece is requesting only the return of sculptures from this particular building) would not set a precedent for other restitution claims because of the distinctively "universal value" of the Parthenon;&lt;ref&gt;Nicoletta Divari-Valakou, (Director of the Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities of Athens), "Revisiting the Parthenon: National Heritage in the Age of Globalism" in Mille Gabriel &amp; Jens Dahl, (eds.)

* Safekeeping of the marbles would be ensured at the New [[Acropolis Museum]], situated to the south of the Acropolis hill. It was built to hold the Parthenon sculpture in natural sunlight that characterises the Athenian climate, arranged in the same way as they would have been on the Parthenon. The museum's facilities have been equipped with state-of-the-art technology for the protection and preservation of exhibits;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcspace.com/architects/Tschumi/|title=Bernard Tschumi Architects|work=arcspace.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928051614/http://www.arcspace.com/architects/Tschumi/|archivedate=28 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The friezes are part of a single work of art, thus it was unintended that fragments of this piece be scattered across different locations;
* Casts of the marbles would be just as able to demonstrate the cultural influences which Greek sculptures have had upon European art as would the original marbles, whereas the context with which the marbles belong cannot be replicated within the British museum;
* A poll suggested that more British people (37%) supported  the marbles' restoration to Greece than opposed it (23%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/10/18/british-people-tend-want-elgin-marbles-returned/|title=British people tend to want Elgin marbles returned|newspaper=Yougov.co.uk|date=18 October 2014|accessdate=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rationale for retaining in London===
A range of different arguments have been presented by scholars,&lt;ref name="newsweek stones"/&gt; British political leaders and British Museum spokespersons over the years in defence of retention of the Elgin Marbles by the British Museum. The main points include:
* the assertion that fulfilling all restitution claims would empty most of the world's great museums&amp;nbsp;– this has also caused concerns among other European and American museums, with one potential target being the [[Nefertiti Bust|famous bust of Nefertiti]] in [[Berlin]]'s [[Neues Museum]]; in addition, portions of Parthenon marbles are kept by many other European museums.&lt;ref name="guardian faq"/&gt; Advocates of the British Museum's position also point out that the Marbles in Britain receive about 6 million visitors per year as opposed to 1.5 million visitors to the Acropolis Museum. The removal of the Marbles to Greece would therefore, they argue, significantly reduce the number of people who have the opportunity to visit the Marbles.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/comment/why-returning-the-elgin-marbles-would-be-madness/&lt;/ref&gt; The English Romantic poet John Keats, and the French sculptor Auguste Rodin, are notable examples of visitors to the Elgin Marbles after their removal to England who subsequently produced famous work inspired by them.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/elgin-marbles-british-museum-rodin-exhibition-uk-return-parthenon-greece-a8339661.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/52305/on-seeing-the-elgin-marbles&lt;/ref&gt;
* the assertion that Greece could mount no court case, because Elgin claims to have been granted permission by what was then Greece's ruling government and [[Statute of limitations|a legal principle of limitation]] would apply, i.e., the ability to pursue claims expires after a period of time prescribed by law;&lt;ref name="newsweek stones"/&gt;
The last was tested in the English High Court in May 2005 in relation to Nazi-looted Old Master artworks held at the British Museum, which the Museum's Trustees wished to return to the family of the original owner; the Court found that due to the [[British Museum Act 1963]] these works could not be returned without further legislation. The judge, [[Andrew Morritt|Mr Justice Morritt]], found that the Act, which protects the collections for posterity, could not be overridden by a "moral obligation" to return works, even if they are believed to have been plundered.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/may/27/arts.parthenon Ruling tightens grip on Parthenon marbles] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103042358/http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/may/27/arts.parthenon |date=3 January 2012 }}, ''The Guardian'', 27 May 2005. Retrieved 5 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Her Majesty's Attorney General v The Trustees of the British Museum, [2005] EWHC (Ch) 1089&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued, however, that the case was not directly relevant to the Elgin Marbles, as it was about a transfer of ownership, and not the loan of artefacts for public exhibition overseas, which is provided for in the 1963 Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elginism.com/20050603/126/|title=Article on the relevance of the Feldmann paintings judgment to the Elgin Marbles.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another argument for keeping the Elgin Marbles within the UK has been made by J. H. Merryman, Sweitzer Professor of Law at [[Stanford University]] and co-operating professor in the Stanford Art Department. He has argued that
the Marbles are now established as a significant element of Britain's own cultural history, as "the Elgin Marbles have been in England since 1821 and in that time have become a part of the British cultural heritage."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Merryman paper|
url=https://law.wustl.edu/harris/Conferences/imperialism/Merryman_PAPER_FINALelgin2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He has also argued that if the Parthenon were actually being restored, there would be a moral argument for returning the Marbles to the temple whence they came, and thus restoring its integrity. ''The Guardian'' has written that many among those who support repatriation imply that the marbles would be displayed in their original position on the Parthenon.&lt;ref name="guardian faq"/&gt; However, the Greek plan is to transfer them from a museum in London to one in Athens. These arguments are perhaps complicated a little by the completion of the new [[Acropolis Museum]] in 2009, where the
half not removed by Elgin is now displayed, aligned in orientation and within sight of the [[Parthenon]], 
with the position of the missing elements clearly marked and space left should they be returned to [[Athens]].&lt;ref name="acrop museum"/&gt;

==Public perception of the issue==

===Popular support for restitution===
Outside Greece a campaign for the Return of the Marbles began in 1981 with the formation of the ''[https://iocarpm.wordpress.com/ International Organising Committee - Australia - for the Restitution of the Parthenon Marbles], and in 1983 with the formation of the ''[http://www.parthenonuk.com/ ''British Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Marbles'']. International organisations such as [[UNESCO]] and the [[International Association for the Reunification of the Parthenon Sculptures]], as well as campaign groups such as, [[Marbles Reunited]], and stars of Hollywood, such as [[George Clooney]] and [[Matt Damon]], as well as Human Rights activists, lawyers, and the people of the arts, voiced their strong support for the return of the Elgin Marbles to Greece.

American actor George Clooney voiced his support for the return by the United Kingdom and reunification of the Parthenon Marbles in Greece, during his promotional campaign for his 2014 film ''[[The Monuments Men]]'' which retells the story of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] efforts to save important masterpieces of art and other culturally important items before their destruction by [[Hitler]] and the [[Nazis]] during [[World War II]]. His remarks regarding the Marbles reignited the debate in the United Kingdom about their return to their home country. Public polls were also carried out by newspapers in response to Clooney's stance on this matter.

An internet campaign site,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bringthemback.org |title=Bring Them Back |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in part sponsored by [[Metaxa]], aims to consolidate support for the return of the Elgin Marbles to the New Acropolis Museum in Athens.

Noted public intellectual [[Christopher Hitchens]] had, at numerous times, argued for their repatriation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2009/07/hitchens200907 |title=The Lovely Stones |accessdate=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In BBC TV Series ''[[QI]]'' (S12E07XL), host [[Stephen Fry]] provided his support for the return of the Elgin Marbles while recounting the story of the Greeks giving lead shot to their [[Ottoman Empire]] enemies, as the Ottomans were running out of ammunition, in order to prevent damage to the Acropolis. Fry had previously written a blog post along much the same lines in December 2011 entitled "A Modest Proposal", signing off with "It's time we lost our marbles"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.stephenfry.com/2011/12/19/a-modest-proposal/ |title=A Modest Proposal |accessdate=2014-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Opinion polls===
A [[YouGov]] poll in 2014 suggested that more British people (37%) supported  the marbles' restoration to Greece than opposed it (23%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/10/18/british-people-tend-want-elgin-marbles-returned/|title=British people tend to want Elgin marbles returned|newspaper=Yougov.co.uk|date=18 October 2014|accessdate=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In older polls, [[Ipsos MORI]] asked in 1998, "If there were a referendum on whether or not the Elgin Marbles should be returned to Greece, how would you vote?" This  returned these values from the British general adult population:&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/poll.aspx?oItemId=2001|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130126092318/http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/poll.aspx?oItemId=2001|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-01-26|title=

*40% in favour of returning the marbles to Greece
*15% in favour of keeping them at the British Museum
*18% would not vote
*27% had no opinion

Another opinion poll in 2002 (again carried out by MORI) showed similar results, with 40% of the British public in favour of returning the marbles to Greece, 16% in favour of keeping them within Britain and the remainder either having no opinion or would not vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/poll.aspx?oItemId=1053|title=Return Of The Parthenon Marbles|publisher=Ipsos MORI|accessdate=18 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409021725/http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/poll.aspx?oItemId=1053|archivedate=9 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked how they would vote if a number of conditions were met (including, but not limited to, a long-term loan whereby the British maintained ownership and joint control over maintenance) the number responding in favour of return increased to 56% and those in favour of keeping them dropped to 7%.

Both MORI poll results have been characterised by proponents of the return of the Marbles to Greece as representing a groundswell of public opinion supporting return, since the proportion explicitly supporting return to Greece significantly exceeds the number who are explicitly in favour of keeping the Marbles at the British Museum.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stosacucine.pk/ |title=Opinion poll: Majority of Britons favor return of Parthenon Marbles |work=stosacucine.pk |date= |accessdate=2009-01-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615202701/http://stosacucine.pk/ |archivedate=15 June 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remainder of the surviving sculptures that are not in museums or storerooms in Athens are held in museums in various locations across Europe. The British Museum also holds additional fragments from the Parthenon sculptures acquired from various collections that have no connection with Lord Elgin.

The collection held in the British Museum includes the following material from the Acropolis:
*Parthenon: {{convert|247|ft|m|abbr=on}} of the original {{convert|524|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[frieze]]
**15 of the 92 metopes

anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2014/12/05/loan-of-a-parthenon-sculpture-to-the-hermitage-a-marble-ambassador-of-a-european-ideal/ |title=Loan to the State Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg |publisher=britishmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2014-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231192906/http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2014/12/05/loan-of-a-parthenon-sculpture-to-the-hermitage-a-marble-ambassador-of-a-european-ideal/ |archivedate=31 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was on display there from Saturday 6 December 2014 until Sunday 18 January 2015.

==Labour party leader stance and new dimensions to the dispute caused by Brexit==

"As with anything stolen or taken from occupied or colonial possession – including artefacts looted from other countries in the past – we should be engaged in constructive talks with the Greek government about returning the sculptures."&lt;ref name="Corbyn vows to return the Marbles to Greece"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Following the 2016 [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|United Kingdom European Union membership referendum]], it has been suggested that the United Kingdom may be forced to return the marbles to Greece as a precondition for an agreement on [[Brexit]], as any agreement between the [[European Union]] and the United Kingdom has to be approved by European Union member Greece.&lt;ref name="Elgin Marbles part of Brexit negotiations"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/08/04/greek-mep-demands-elgin-marbles-become-part-brexit-negotiations/ |title=Greek MEP demands Elgin Marbles become part of Brexit negotiations |publisher=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greece to recover stolen Parthenon art"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dw.com/en/greece-could-use-brexit-to-recover-stolen-parthenon-art/a-40038439 |title=Greece could use Brexit to recover stolen Parthenon art |publisher=Deutsche Welle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12268">'''Engineering psychology''', also known as Human Factors Engineering, is the science of [[human behavior]] and capability, applied to the design and operation of systems and technology.&lt;ref name="Stanton" /&gt;
As an applied field of [[psychology]] and an interdisciplinary part of [[ergonomics]], it aims to improve the [[Human–machine system|relationships between people and machines]] by redesigning equipment, interactions, or the environment in which they take place. The work of an engineering psychologist is often described as making the relationship more "user-friendly."

== History ==
Engineering psychology was created from within [[experimental psychology]].&lt;ref name="Grether"/&gt; Engineering psychology started during World War I (1914).&lt;ref name="Schultz &amp; Schultz"/&gt; The reason why this subject was developed during this time was because many of America’s weapons were failing;  bombs not falling in the right place to weapons attacking normal marine life.&lt;ref name="Grether"/&gt; The fault was traced back to human errors.&lt;ref name="Grether"/&gt; One of the first designs to be built to restrain human error was the use of [[psychoacoustics]] by S.S. Stevens and L.L. Beranek were two of the first American psychologists called upon to help change how people and machinery worked together.&lt;ref name="Grether"/&gt; One of their first assignments was to try and reduce noise levels in military aircraft. The work was directed at improving intelligibility of military communication systems and appeared to have been very successful. However it was not until after August 1945 that levels of research in engineering psychology began to increase significantly.&lt;ref name="Grether"/&gt; This occurred because the research that started in 1940 now began to show.&lt;ref name="Grether"/&gt;

[[Lillian Gilbreth]] combined the talents of an [[engineer]], [[psychologist]] and mother of twelve.  Her appreciation of [[human factor]]s made her successful in the implementation of [[time and motion]] studies and [[scientific management]].  She went on to pioneer [[ergonomic]]s in the kitchen, inventing the [[pedal bin]], for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=A brief history of modern psychology |author=Ludy T. Benjamin |page=105 |chapter=Lillian Gilbreth's Engineering Psychology |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4051-3205-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, the two world wars generated much formal study of human factors which affected the efficiency of munitions output and warfare.  In World War I, the Health of Munitions Workers Committee was created in 1915.  This made recommendations based upon studies of the effects of overwork on efficiency which resulted in policies of providing breaks and limiting hours of work, including avoidance of work on Sunday.  The [[Industrial Fatigue Research Board]] was created in 1918 to take this work forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Employers, the government, and industrial fatigue in Britain, 1890-1918 |first=A.J. |last=McIvor |journal=British Journal of Industrial Medicine |year=1987 |volume=44 |pages=724–732 |doi=10.1136/oem.44.11.724|pmc=1007909 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In WW2, researchers at Cambridge University such as [[Frederic Bartlett]] and [[Kenneth Craik]] started work on the operation of equipment in 1939 and this resulted in the creation of the [[Unit for Research in Applied Psychology]] in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/history/legacyconference/briefingnotes.html |title=Notes on the work of the Medical Research Council Applied Psychology Unit 1944-1997 |chapter=Formation of the APU |publisher=MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Applied psychology]] - The use of psychological principles to overcome problems in other domains.  It has been argued that engineering psychology is separate from applied (cognitive) psychology because advances in cognitive psychology have infrequently informed engineering psychology research.  Surprisingly, work in engineering psychology often seems to inform developments in cognitive psychology.  For example, engineering psychology research has enabled cognitive psychologists to explain why [[GUI]]s seem easier to use than character-based computer interfaces (such as [[DOS]]).&lt;ref name=Stanton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stanton|first=N.|title=Engineering Psychology: Another Science of Common Sense?|journal=The Psychologist|year=1996|volume=9|issue=7|pages=300–303|url=http://www.katiandgraham.com/eng_psy.htm|accessdate=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Engineering Psychology, Ergonomics, &amp; Human Factors ===
Although the comparability of these terms and many others have been a topic of debate, the differences of these fields can be seen in the applications of the respective fields.

Engineering psychology is concerned with the adaptation of the equipment and environment to people, based upon their psychological capacities and limitations with the objective of improving overall system performance, involving human and machine elements&lt;ref name="Stanton" /&gt; Engineering psychologists strive to match equipment requirements with the capabilities of human operators by changing the design of the equipment.&lt;ref name="Schultz &amp; Schultz"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Schultz| first = D| authorlink = |author2=Schultz, E.| title = Psychology and work today | publisher = Pearson |location=New Jersey | year = 2010| url = | isbn = 978-0-205-68358-1 | doi = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of this matching was the redesign of the mailbags used by letter carriers. Engineering psychologists discovered that mailbag with a waist-support strap, and a double bag that requires the use of both shoulders, reduces muscle fatigue.&lt;ref name="Schultz &amp; Schultz" /&gt; Another example involves the cumulative trauma disorders grocery checkout workers suffered as the result of repetitive wrist movements using electronic scanners. Engineering psychologists found that the optimal checkout station design would allow for workers to easily use either hand to distribute the workload between both wrists.&lt;ref name="Schultz &amp; Schultz" /&gt;

The field of [[ergonomics]] is based on scientific studies of ordinary people in work situations and is applied to the design of processes and machines, to the layout of work places, to methods of work, and to the control of the physical environment, in order to achieve greater efficiency of both men and machines&lt;ref name="Human Factors"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Licht, | first = D| authorlink = |author2=D.

At one point in time, the term [[human factors]] was used in place of ergonomics in Europe.&lt;ref name="Grether"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Grether| first = F| authorlink = | title = Engineering psychology in the United States| journal = American Psychologist |volume=23 |issue=10 |pages=743–751| publisher = | year = 1962| url = | format = | doi = 10.1037/h0026850 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Human factors involve interdisciplinary scientific research and studies to seek to realize greater recognition and understanding of the worker's characteristics, needs, abilities, and limitations when the procedures and products of technology are being designed.&lt;ref name="Human Factors" /&gt; This field utilizes knowledge from several fields such as mechanical engineering, psychology, and industrial engineering&lt;ref name="Human Factors" /&gt; to design instruments.

[[Human factors]] is broader than engineering psychology, which is focused specifically on designing systems that accommodate the information-processing capabilities of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Wickens, C. and Hollands, J. (1999), ''Engineering Psychology and Human Performance'', Prentice Hall, {{ISBN|0-321-04711-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the work in the respective fields differ, there are some similarities between these. These fields share the same objectives which are to optimize the effectiveness and efficiency with which human activities are conducted as well as to improve the general quality of life through increased safety, reduced fatigue and stress, increased comfort, and satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Stanton" /&gt;

===Importance of Engineering Psychologists===

Engineering psychologists contribute to the design of a variety of products, including dental and surgical tools, cameras, toothbrushes and car-seats. They have been involved in the re-design of the mailbags used by letter carriers. More than 20% of letter carriers suffer from [[musculoskeletal injury]] such as lower back pain from carrying mailbags slung over their shoulders. A mailbag with a waist-support strap, and a double bag that requires the use of both shoulders, has been shown to reduce muscle fatigue.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Research by engineering psychologists has demonstrated that using cell-phones while driving degrades performance by increasing driver reaction time, particularly among older drivers, and can lead to higher accident risk among drivers of all ages. Research findings such as these have supported governmental regulation of cell-phone use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schultz|first=Duane P.

Baron '''Ernst Friedrich von Liphart''' or '''Earnest Lipgart''' (1847–1932) was a painter, a noted art expert and art collector from what is now [[Tartu]] in Estonia. After living for a time in Florence, he moved to France and then to Russia, where he was a curator at the [[Hermitage Museum]].

==Life==
Liphart was born in [[Kambja Parish]] in [[Tartu County]] in 1847. His father, [[Karl Eduard von Liphart]], came from a [[Baltic nobility|noble]] [[Baltic German]] family that was based at [[Raadi Manor]] in what is now Estonia. His family were members of the national intelligentsia and owned a significant art collection.&lt;ref name=museum&gt;[http://www.erm.ee/en/visit/raadi/history-of-manor History of Manor], Eesti.

==Travels in Spain and Italy==
Liphart accompanied his father on his travels, starting in 1860.&lt;ref name=rus/&gt; In 1862, they moved to Florence because of Liphart's weak health. His father continued his interest in art, which was financed and supported by Grand Duchess [[Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia (1819–1876)|Maria Nikolaevna]], the daughter of [[Tsar Nicholas I]].&lt;ref name=reh/&gt; Ernst studied painting under [[Franz von Lenbach]] before travelling to Spain with him to study paintings from 1866 to 1868.&lt;ref name=rus/&gt; This trip was funded by Lenbach's patron [[Adolf Friedrich von Schack|Count Schack]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iment.com/maida/family/mother/vicars/ernstdeliphart.htm Ernst Friederich von Liphart], Master Paintings, retrieved 3 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paris==
Liphart was disinherited by his father in 1873 after he converted to Roman Catholicism to marry Luisa Juan, a Florentine,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rusartnet.com/biographies/russian-artists/19th-century/late-19th-century/baron-ernst-friedrich-von-liphart Baron Ernst Friedrich von Liphart], RusArtNet.com, retrieved 30 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; before they moved to Paris.

In 1886 Liphart moved to [[Saint Petersburg]], where he was a successful artist, painting a portrait of [[Tsar Nicholas II]], as well as decorating the curtain and ceiling of the theatre of the [[Moika Palace]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intertimes.ru/?type=spec&amp;id=21 Yusupov Palace], intertimes.ru, retrieved 3 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and several imperial palaces.&lt;ref name=rus/&gt; Liphart also took on more unusual requests, including the menu for the Tsar's coronation in 1896 and then painting 100 figures on a piano, telling the story of [[Orpheus]]. The piano was a present from the Tsar to Empress [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Alexandra Feodorovna]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nicholasandalexandra.com/piano.html Grand Piano], Liphart, 1898, nicholasandalexandra.com, retrieved 4 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Ernst's father died in [[Florence]] in 1904. After his death his art collection was moved back to Estonia, where it was combined with his family's collection at [[Raadi Manor]].&lt;ref name=reh&gt;[http://www.rehs.com/printimage.html?image_no=28 The Environs of Plymouth], rehs.com, retrieved 31 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Liphart's home was still in Russia, where he taught at the Drawing School of the [[Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts]] in Saint Petersburg in the 1890s, where his students included [[Eugene Lanceray]].&lt;ref name=bown243&gt;Bown, Matthew Cullerne.

Liphart was appointed to several Russian learned societies and he became the curator of paintings at the [[Hermitage Museum]] in 1906.&lt;ref name=herm/&gt; He held the position until 1929. Liphart continued his father's interest in Leonardo da Vinci. Liphart arranged for the museum to purchase [[Madonna and Child with Flowers]]&lt;ref name=rus/&gt; which he had correctly attributed to da Vinci.&lt;ref name=herm/&gt; Liphart also notably identified the painting of [[Saint Peter and Saint Paul (El Greco)|Saint Peter and Saint Paul]] to be by [[El Greco]].&lt;ref name=herm&gt;[http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_9_8.html Directors of the Imperial Hermitage] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227012744/http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_9_8.html |date=February 27, 2014 }}, Hermitage Museum, retrieved 3 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liphart art collection that had been at the family residence was moved after the [[Russian Revolution]]. The collection appeared first in a sale in [[Copenhagen]] in 1920. Raadi Manor was used by the [[Estonian National Museum]] in 1922&amp;ndash;4 after the manor came under the management of the [[University of Tartu]].&lt;ref name=reh/&gt; The graphic art collection created by the Liphart family came into the possession of [[Tartu University]] in the 1920s. The university's art museum still has the collection, which includes examples of Japanese woodcuts as well as noted prints by [[Albrecht Dürer]] and [[William Hogarth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://kunstimuuseum.ut.ee/eng/graphic.html Graphic Art] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101050527/http://kunstimuuseum.ut.ee/eng/graphic.html |date=2014-01-01 }}, University of Tartu Art Museum, retrieved 31 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921 he was evicted from his house and his daughter was executed for harbouring a [[White movement#Structure|White Army]] officer. Before he died, Liphart wrote a novel and a play.&lt;ref name=rus&gt;[http://www.rusartnet.com/biographies/russian-artists/19th-century/late-19th-century/baron-ernst-friedrich-von-liphart Baron Ernst Friedrich von Liphart], RusArtNet.com, retrieved 31 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first structured method for documenting process flow, e.g. in [[flow shop scheduling]], the flow process chart, was introduced by [[Frank Gilbreth|Frank]] and [[Lillian Gilbreth]] to members of [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers|ASME]] in 1921 as the presentation “Process Charts, First Steps in Finding the One Best Way to Do Work”.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Lillian Moller Gilbreth (1921) ''[https://engineering.purdue.edu/IE/GilbrethLibrary/gilbrethproject/processcharts.pdf Process Charts]''. American Society of Mechanical Engineers.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Gilbreths' tools quickly found their way into [[industrial engineering]] curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graham|first=Ben B.|title=Detail process charting : speaking the language of process|year=2004|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=9780471653943|edition=[Online-Ausg.]|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In the early 1930s, an industrial engineer, [[Allan H. Mogensen]] began training business people in the use of some of the tools of industrial engineering at his Work Simplification Conferences in [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. A 1944 graduate of Mogensen's class, [[Art Spinanger]], took the tools back to [[Procter and Gamble]] where he developed their Deliberate Methods Change Program.  Another 1944 graduate, [[Benjamin S. Graham|Ben S. Graham]], Director of Formcraft Engineering at [[Standard Register Corporation]], adapted the flow process chart to information processing with his development of the multi-flow process chart to display multiple documents and their relationships.

== Symbols ==
In 1947, ASME adopted the following symbol set derived from Gilbreth's original work as the ASME Standard for Process Charts.&lt;ref&gt;American Society of Mechanical Engineers (1947) ''ASME standard; operation and flow process charts''.

The '''Forest Research Institute Malaysia''' ('''FRIM'''; [[Malay language|Malay]]: ''Institut Penyelidikan Perhutanan Malaysia'') is a statutory [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of Malaysia]], under the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment. FRIM promotes sustainable management and optimal use of [[forestry|forest]] resources in [[Malaysia]] by generating knowledge and technology through research, development and application in tropical forestry. FRIM is located in [[Kepong]], near Kuala Lumpur.&lt;ref name=frim-gov&gt;{{cite web|title=Forest Research Institute Malaysia {{!}} Official Portal|url=http://www.frim.gov.my/|publisher=frim.gov.my|accessdate=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tourismselangor&gt;{{cite web|title=Forest Research Institute of Malaysia (FRIM), Kepong|url=http://www.tourismselangor.my/forest-research-institute-of-malaysia/|publisher=tourismselangor.my|accessdate=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1926, the Chief Conservator of the Forest (equivalent to today's Director of Forestry), G.E.S Cubitt, asked Dr. F.W. Foxworthy to establish a separate forest research unit for the Forestry Department. It was Foxworthy who selected the present site, at Kepong. He was also to become the institutes's first Chief Research Officer.

The site comprised an area that was practically stripped of its original [[forest cover]] except for a few remnant trees at the more inaccessible localities. Lalang-grass scrub on the hillsides made way to vegetable terraces on the lower slopes, while the valley cradled a few ponds, the left-overs of a past tin-mining operation.

Within two years in 1928, the first {{convert|42|ha}} of experimental plantation (mainly [[dipterocarp]]s, tall hardwood species) were in place, carefully nurtured into being using "nurse" trees of other species as shade and food providers (being nitrogen-fixers). By that time the construction of the main building had begun. Completed the following years, this building was to remain the sole centre for the laboratories, [[herbarium]], and museum, as well as the Chemistry, Zoology and Sivilculture sections of the institute, until new buildings were added after World War II. The herbarium collection, that was also moved to Kepong, numbered 1,500 accessions.

The end of the decade saw some 125 hectares of plantation established at the Institute. Plantation trials with exotic species started in the early 1930s. The plantations covered 154 hectares just before the outbreak of World War II in Europe in 1939, and before the Japanese occupation of the [[Malay Peninsula]] in 1941–1945. By this time the dipterocarp and non-Dipterocarp arboreta contained 75 species (represented by 360 individual trees), while the Herbarium collection numbered nearly 40,000 accessions.

=== Establishment ===
Just before [[Federation of Malaya Independence Act 1957|Malaysia won independence]] from the [[British Empire]] in 1957, some 220 hectares of plantations had been established at the institute, while the Dipterocarp and non-Dipterocarp arboreta held 201 and 168 species respectively. The herbarium collection had grown to 53,600 accessions. The Timber Research Branch had moved from [[Sentul, Kuala Lumpur|Sentul]] to become a part of the Institute at Kepong.

Six years later, Encik Abdul Rahman Mohd. Ali was appointed the Institute's first Malaysian Director and Chief Research Officer. The ground of the Institute expanded by a further 192 hectares in 1962 and 1964 to total 600 hectares.

In 1977 Dr. Salleh Mohd. Nor was appointed to his present post of director general of the institute. Eight years later, the institute was transformed into a statutory body. Through an Act of Parliament, the Malaysia Forestry Research and Development Board (MFRDB) was formed to administer the Institute, which was now named FOREST RESEARCH INSTITUTE of MALAYSIA (FRIM). This historic change was announced by the EX-Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Bin Muhammad when he visited FRIM on 11 June 1984. The formal inauguration of FRIM took place later, on 5 April 1986.

[[File:Geotechnical centrifuge at the University of California, Davis..png|thumb|{{convert|9|m|ft|adj=mid|-radius|0}} geotechnical [[centrifuge]] at the University of California, Davis]]

'''Geotechnical centrifuge modeling''' is a technique for testing physical scale models of [[geotechnical|Geotechnical Engineering]] systems such as natural and man-made slopes and earth retaining structures and building or bridge foundations.

The scale [[Physical model|model]] is typically constructed in the laboratory and then loaded onto the end of the [[centrifuge]], which is typically between {{convert|0.2|and|10|m|ft|1}} in radius. The purpose of spinning the models on the centrifuge is to increase the [[g-force]]s on the model so that stresses in the model are equal to stresses in the prototype.  For example, the stress beneath a {{convert|0.1|m|ft|adj=mid|-deep|1}} layer of model [[Soil mechanics|soil]] spun at a centrifugal acceleration of 50 g produces stresses equivalent to those beneath a {{convert|5|m|ft|adj=mid|-deep|0}} prototype layer of soil in earth's [[gravity]].

The idea to use centrifugal acceleration to simulate increased gravitational acceleration was first proposed by Phillips (1869). Pokrovsky and Fedorov (1936) in the Soviet Union and Bucky (1931) in the United States were the first to implement the idea. [[Andrew N. Schofield]] (e.g. Schofield 1980) played a key role in modern development of centrifuge modeling.

==Principles of centrifuge modeling==

===Typical applications===
[[File:Centrifuge Model of a Port Structure.png|thumb|Model of a port structure loaded on the UC Davis centrifuge]]
A geotechnical centrifuge is used to test models of geotechnical problems such as the strength, stiffness and capacity of foundations for bridges and buildings, settlement of embankments, stability of slopes, earth retaining structures, tunnel stability and seawalls. Other applications include explosive cratering, contaminant migration in ground water, frost heave and sea ice. The centrifuge may be useful for scale modeling of any large-scale nonlinear problem for which gravity is a primary driving force.

===Reason for model testing on the centrifuge===
Geotechnical materials such as soil and rock have non-linear mechanical properties that depend on the effective confining stress and stress history. The centrifuge applies an increased "gravitational" [[acceleration]] to physical models in order to produce identical self-weight stresses in the model and prototype. The one to one scaling of stress enhances the similarity of geotechnical models and makes it possible to obtain accurate data to help solve complex problems such as [[earthquake]]-induced liquefaction, soil-structure interaction and underground transport of pollutants such as dense non-aqueous phase liquids. Centrifuge model testing provides data to improve our understanding of basic mechanisms of deformation and failure and provides benchmarks useful for verification of [[numerical model]]s.

===Scaling laws===
Note that in this article, the asterisk on any quantity represents the scale factor for that quantity. For example, in  &lt;math&gt;x^* = \frac{x_{m}} {x_{p}}&lt;/math&gt;, the subscript m represents "model" and the subscript p represents "prototype" and &lt;math&gt;x^* \,&lt;/math&gt; represents the scale factor for the quantity &lt;math&gt;x \,&lt;/math&gt; (Garnier et al. 2007).

The reason for spinning a model on a centrifuge is to enable small scale models to feel the same effective stresses as a full-scale prototype. This goal can be stated mathematically as

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma'^* = \frac{\sigma'_{m}} {\sigma'_{p}} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

where the asterisk represents the scaling factor for the quantity, &lt;math&gt;\sigma'_{m}&lt;/math&gt; is the effective stress in the model and &lt;math&gt;\sigma'_{p}&lt;/math&gt; is the effective stress in the prototype.

In [[soil mechanics]] the vertical effective stress, &lt;math&gt;\sigma'&lt;/math&gt; for example, is typically calculated by

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma' = \sigma^t - u\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\sigma^t &lt;/math&gt; is the total stress and  &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt; is the pore pressure. For a uniform layer with no pore pressure, the total vertical stress at a depth &lt;math&gt;H &lt;/math&gt; may be calculated by:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma^t = \rho g H \,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; represents the density of the layer and &lt;math&gt; g&lt;/math&gt; represents gravity. In the conventional form of centrifuge modeling (Garnier et al. 2007), it is typical that the same materials are used in the model and prototype; therefore the densities are the same in model and prototype, i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt; \rho^* = 1 \,&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, in conventional centrifuge modeling all lengths are scaled by the same factor &lt;math&gt;L^*&lt;/math&gt;. To produce the same stress in the model as in the prototype, we thus require  &lt;math&gt;\rho^*g^*H^* = (1)g^*L^* = 1 \,&lt;/math&gt;, which may be rewritten as

:&lt;math&gt;g^* = \frac{1} {L^*}&lt;/math&gt;

The above scaling law states that if lengths in the model are reduced by some factor, n, then gravitational accelerations must be increased by the same factor, n in order to preserve equal stresses in model and prototype.

====Dynamic problems====
For dynamic problems where gravity and accelerations are important, all accelerations must scale as gravity is scaled, i.e.
:&lt;math&gt;a^* = g^* = \frac{1} {L^*}&lt;/math&gt;

Since acceleration has units of &lt;math&gt;\frac{L} {T^2}&lt;/math&gt;, it is required that 
:&lt;math&gt;a^* = \frac{L^*} {T^{*2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence it is required that :&lt;math&gt;\frac{1} {L^*} = \frac{L^*} {T^{*2}}&lt;/math&gt;, or

:&lt;math&gt;T^* = L^* \,&lt;/math&gt;

Frequency has units of inverse of time, velocity has units of length per time, so for dynamic problems we also obtain

:&lt;math&gt;f^* = \frac{1} {L{*}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v^* = \frac{L^*} {T{*}} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

====Diffusion problems====

:&lt;math&gt;T^* = L^{*2} \,&lt;/math&gt;

For model tests involving both dynamics and diffusion, the conflict in time scale factors may be resolved by scaling the permeability of the soil (Garnier et al. 2007)

====Scaling of other quantitites====
(this section obviously needs work!)

scale factors for energy, force, pressure, acceleration, velocity, etc. 
Note that stress has units of pressure, or force per unit area. Thus we can show that

Substituting F = m∙a (Newton's law, [[force]] = mass ∙ acceleration) and r = m/L3 (from the definition of mass density).

Scale factors for many other quantities can be derived from the above relationships. The table below summarizes common scale factors for centrifuge testing.

Scale Factors for Centrifuge Model Tests (from Garnier et al. 2007)
(Table is suggested to be added here)

==Value of centrifuge in geotechnical earthquake engineering==

[[File:Schematic Piles In Centrifuge Model.jpg|thumb|Schematic of a model containing piles in sloping ground. The dimensions are given in prototype scale. For this experiment the scale factor was 30 or 50.]]
[[File:BrandenbergSoilexcavation.jpg|thumb|Excavation of a centrifuge model after liquefaction and lateral spreading.]]

Large earthquakes are infrequent and unrepeatable but they can be devastating. All of these factors make it difficult to obtain the required data to study their effects by post earthquake field investigations. Instrumentation of full scale structures is expensive to maintain over the large periods of time that may elapse between major temblors, and the instrumentation may not be placed in the most scientifically useful locations. Even if engineers are lucky enough to obtain timely recordings of data from real failures, there is no guarantee that the instrumentation is providing repeatable data. In addition, scientifically educational failures from real earthquakes come at the expense of the safety of the public. Understandably, after a real earthquake, most of the interesting data is rapidly cleared away before engineers have an opportunity to adequately study the failure modes.

Centrifuge modeling is a valuable tool for studying the effects of ground shaking on critical structures without risking the safety of the public. The efficacy of alternative designs or seismic retrofitting techniques can compared in a repeatable scientific series of tests.

==Verification of numerical models==

Centrifuge tests can also be used to obtain experimental data to verify a design procedure or a computer model. The rapid development of computational power over recent decades has revolutionized engineering analysis. Many computer models have been developed to predict the behavior of geotechnical structures during earthquakes and other loads. Before a computer model can be used with confidence, it must be proven to be valid based on evidence. The meager and unrepeatable data provided by natural earthquakes, for example, is usually insufficient for this purpose. Verification of the validity of assumptions made by a computational algorithm is especially important in the area of geotechnical engineering due to the complexity of soil behavior. Soils exhibit highly non-linear behavior, their strength and stiffness depend on their stress history and on the water pressure in the pore fluid, all of which may evolve during the loading caused by an earthquake. The computer models which are intended to simulate these phenomena are very complex and require extensive verification. Experimental data from centrifuge tests is useful for verifying assumptions made by a computational algorithm. If the results show the computer model to be inaccurate, the centrifuge test data provides insight into the physical processes which in turn stimulates the development of better computer models.

In [[mathematical optimization]], '''Himmelblau's function''' is a multi-modal function, used to test the performance of [[optimization algorithm]]s.
The function is defined by:

: &lt;math&gt;f(x, y) = (x^2+y-11)^2 + (x+y^2-7)^2.\quad&lt;/math&gt;

It has one local maximum at &lt;math&gt;x = -0.270845 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y = -0.923039 &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = 181.617 &lt;/math&gt;, and four identical local minima:

* &lt;math&gt;f(3.0, 2.0) = 0.0, \quad&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f(-2.805118, 3.131312) = 0.0, \quad&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f(-3.779310, -3.283186) = 0.0, \quad&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f(3.584428, -1.848126) = 0.0. \quad&lt;/math&gt;

The locations of all the [[Maxima and minima|minima]] can be found analytically. However, because they are roots of [[cubic polynomial]]s, when written in terms of radicals, the expressions are somewhat complicated.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The function is named after [[David Mautner Himmelblau]] (1924–2011), who introduced it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Himmelblau |first=D. |title=Applied Nonlinear Programming |location= |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1972 |isbn=0-07-028921-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Homeokinetics''' is the study of self-organizing, [[complex systems]].&lt;ref name=homeo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homeokinetics.org/pdf%20files/1978%20Physical%20Basis%20-%20Homeokinetics.pdf|title=Homeokinetics: A Physical Science for Complex Systems|author=H.

Homeokinetic physics studies the up-down processes that bind these levels. Tools such as [[mechanics]], [[quantum field theory]], and the laws of [[thermodynamics]] provide the key relationships. The subject, described as the physics and thermodynamics associated with the up down movement between levels of systems, originated in the late 1970s work of American physicists [[Harry Soodak]] and [[Arthur Iberall]]. Complex systems are [[universes]], [[galaxies]], [[social systems]], [[people]], or even those that seem as simple as [[gases]]. The basic premise is that the entire universe consists of atomistic-like units bound in interactive ensembles to form systems, level by level, in a nested hierarchy. Homeokinetics treats all complex systems on an equal footing, animate and inanimate, providing them with a common viewpoint. The complexity in studying how they work is reduced by the emergence of common languages in all complex systems.&lt;ref name=Homeok2016/&gt;

==History==
[[Arthur Iberall]], [[Warren McCulloch]] and [[Harry Soodak]] developed the concept of homeokinetics as a new branch of physics.  It began through Iberall's biophysical research for the NASA [[exobiology]] program into the dynamics of mammalian physiological processes&lt;ref&gt;Iberall, A.S. and S.Z. Cardon. Analysis of the dynamic systems response of some internal human systems. Clearinghouse for Federal Scientific and Technical Information; Reports to NASA: CR-129, Oct. 1964; CR-141, Jan. l965; CR-219, May 1965; Interim Report, Dec. 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iberall, A.S., M. Ehrenberg and S.Z. Cardon. General-dynamics of the physical-chemical systems in mammals. Contractors Report to NASA, NASW-1066, Aug. 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; They were observing an area that physics has neglected, that of complex systems with their very long internal factory day delays. They were observing systems associated with nested [[hierarchy]] and with an extensive range of time scale processes.&lt;ref&gt;Iberall, A.S. and S.Z. Cardon. Hierarchical regulation in the complex biological organism. Record of the IEEE Systems Science and Cybernetics Conference, Phila., October, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iberall, A.S. and W.S. McCulloch. The organizing principle of complex living systems. J. Basic Engr., ASME 290-294, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; It was such connections, referred to as both up-down or in-out connections (as nested hierarchy) and side-side or flatland physics among atomistic-like components (as [[heterarchy]]) that became the hallmark of homeokinetic problems. By 1975, they began to put a formal catch-phrase name on those complex problems, associating them with [[nature]], [[life]], [[human]], [[mind]], and [[society]]. The major method of exposition that they began using was a combination of engineering physics and a more academic pure physics. In 1981, Iberall was invited to the Crump Institute for Medical Engineering of [[UCLA]], where he further refined the key concepts of homeokinetics, developing a physical scientific foundation for complex systems.

==Self-organizing Complex Systems==

A system is a collective of interacting ‘atomistic’-like entities.&lt;ref name=Homeok2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=homeo/&gt; The word ‘atomism’ is used to stand both for the entity and the doctrine. As is known from ‘kinetic’ theory, in mobile or simple systems, the atomisms share their ‘energy’ in interactive collisions. That so-called ‘equipartitioning’ process takes place within a few collisions. Physically, if there is little or no interaction, the process is considered to be very weak. Physics deals basically with the forces of interaction—few in number—that influence the interactions. They all tend to emerge with considerable force at high ‘density’ of atomistic interaction. In complex systems, there is also a result of internal processes in the atomisms. They exhibit, in addition to the pair-by-pair interactions, internal actions such as [[vibrations]], [[rotations]], and association. If the energy and time involved internally creates a very large—in time—cycle of performance of their actions compared to their pair interactions, the collective system is complex. If you eat a cookie and you do not see the resulting action for hours, that is complex; if boy meets girl and they become ‘engaged’ for a protracted period, that is complex. What emerges from that physics is a broad host of changes in state and stability transitions in state. Viewing [[Aristotle]] as having defined a general basis for systems in their static-logical states and trying to identify a logic-metalogic for physics, e.g., [[metaphysics]], then homeokinetics is viewed to be an attempt to define the dynamics of all those systems in the universe.

==Flatland physics vs Homeokinetic physics==

Ordinary physics is a flatland physics, a physics at some particular level. Examples include nuclear and atomic physics, biophysics, social physics, and stellar physics. Homeokinetic physics combines flatland physics with the study of the up down processes that binds the levels.&lt;ref name="primer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homeokinetics.org/pdf%20files/HomeokineticsPrimer.pdf|title=Primer on Homeokinetics: A Physical Foundation for Complex Systems|author=Arthur Iberall and Harry Soodak|publisher=Cri-de-Coeur Press|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tools, such as mechanics, quantum field theory, and the laws of thermodynamics, provide key relationships for the binding of the levels, how they connect, and how the energy flows up and down. And whether the atomisms are atoms, molecules, cells, people, stars, galaxies, or universes, the same tools can be used to understand them. Homeokinetics treats all complex systems on an equal footing, animate and inanimate, providing them with a common viewpoint. The complexity in studying how they work is reduced by the emergence of common languages in all complex systems.

==Applications==
A homeokinetic approach to complex systems has been applied to ecological psychology,&lt;ref&gt;Iberall, A., A physical (homeokinetic) foundation for the Gibsonian theory of perception and action, Ecolog. Psychol. 7(1): 37-68, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; anthropology, geology,
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trincoll.edu/depts/ecopsyc/homeokinetics/ASI_WhiteFlyerFinal.pdf "Social Physics: Networks and Causal Chains"]&lt;/ref&gt; law, motor control,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=15215072 | volume=13 | issue=4 | title=Patterns of human interlimb coordination emerge from the properties of non-linear, limit cycle oscillatory processes: theory and data | year=1981 | journal=J Mot Behav | pages=226–61 | author=Kelso JA, Holt KG, Rubin P, Kugler PN | doi=10.1080/00222895.1981.10735251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been applied to [[social physics]] where a homeokinetics analysis shows that one must account for flow variables such as the flow of energy, of materials, of action, reproduction rate, and value-in-exchange.&lt;ref&gt;Iberall, A.S., H.

'''Instrumentation''' is a collective term for [[measuring instrument]]s used for indicating, measuring and recording physical quantities, and has its origins in the art and science of [[Scientific instrument|scientific instrument-making]]. 

The term '''instrumentation''' may refer to a device or group of devices used for direct reading [[thermometers]] or, when using many sensors, may become part of a complex [[industrial control system]] in such as manufacturing industry, vehicles and transportation. Instrumentation can be found in the household as well; a [[smoke detector]] or a heating [[thermostat]] are examples.

== History and development==
[[Image:Steuerstand01.jpg|thumb|A local instrumentation panel on a steam turbine.]]
The history of instrumentation can be divide into several phases. 
===Pre-industrial===
Elements of industrial instrumentation have long histories. Scales for comparing weights and simple pointers to indicate position are ancient technologies. Some of the earliest measurements were of time. One of the oldest [[water clock]]s was found in the tomb of the [[ancient Egypt]]ian pharaoh [[Amenhotep I]], buried around 1500 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Early Clocks | url = https://www.nist.gov/pml/general/time/early.cfm | accessdate = 1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Improvements were incorporated in the clocks. By 270 BCE they had the rudiments of an automatic control system device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Building automation history page | url = http://www.building-automation-consultants.com/building-automation-history.html | accessdate = 1 March 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110708104028/http://www.building-automation-consultants.com/building-automation-history.html | archivedate = 8 July 2011 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1663 [[Christopher Wren]] presented the Royal Society with a design for a "weather clock". A drawing shows meteorological sensors moving pens over paper driven by clockwork. Such devices did not become standard in meteorology for two centuries.&lt;ref&gt;

Integrating sensors, displays, recorders and controls was uncommon until the industrial revolution, limited by both need and practicality.

===Early industrial===
[[File:Analogue control loop evolution.png|thumb|The evolution of analogue control loop signalling from the pneumatic era to the electronic era.]]
Early systems used direct process connections to local control panels for control and indication, which from the early 1930s saw the introduction of pneumatic transmitters and automatic 3-term (PID) controllers.

The ranges of pneumatic transmitters were defined by the need to control valves and actuators in the field. Typically a signal ranged from 3 to 15 psi (20 to 100kPa or 0.2 to 1.0 kg/cm2) as a standard, was standardized with 6 to 30 psi occasionally being used for larger valves. 
Transistor electronics enabled wiring to replace pipes, initially with a range of 20 to 100mA at up to 90V for loop powered devices, reducing to 4 to 20mA at 12 to 24V in more modern systems. A [[transmitter]] is a device that produces an output signal, often in the form of a 4&amp;ndash;20&amp;nbsp;[[Ampere|mA]] electrical [[current (electrical)|current]] signal, although many other options using [[voltage]], [[frequency]], [[pressure]], or [[ethernet]] are possible. The [[Transistor#History|transistor]] was commercialized by the mid-1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=704244&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D704244] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518092416/http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=704244&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D704244|date=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instruments attached to a control system provided signals used to operate [[solenoid]]s, [[valve]]s, [[Regulator (automatic control)|regulators]], [[circuit breaker]]s, [[relay]]s and other devices. Such devices could control a desired output variable, and provide either remote or automated control capabilities.

Each instrument company introduced their own standard instrumentation signal, causing confusion until the 4-20&amp;nbsp;mA range was used as the standard electronic instrument signal for transmitters and valves. This signal was eventually standardized as ANSI/ISA S50, “Compatibility of Analog Signals for Electronic Industrial Process Instruments", in the 1970s. The transformation of instrumentation from mechanical pneumatic transmitters, controllers, and valves to electronic instruments reduced maintenance costs as electronic instruments were more dependable than mechanical instruments. This also increased efficiency and production due to their increase in accuracy. Pneumatics enjoyed some advantages, being favored in corrosive and explosive atmospheres.&lt;ref name=Anderson2&gt;

===Automatic process control===
[[File:Industrial control loop.jpg|thumb|Example of a single industrial control loop; showing continuously modulated control of process flow.]]
In the early years of [[process control]], process indicators and control elements such as valves were monitored by an operator that walked around the unit adjusting the valves to obtain the desired temperatures, pressures, and flows. As technology evolved pneumatic controllers were invented and mounted in the field that monitored the process and controlled the valves. This reduced the amount of time process operators were needed to monitor the process. Later years the actual controllers were moved to a central room and signals were sent into the control room to monitor the process and outputs signals were sent to the final control element such as a valve to adjust the process as needed. These controllers and indicators were mounted on a wall called a control board. The operators stood in front of this board walking back and forth monitoring the process indicators. This again reduced the number and amount of time process operators were needed to walk around the units. The most standard pneumatic signal level used during these years was 3-15 psig.&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;

===Large integrated computer-based systems===
[[Image:Pneumatische regelaar.jpg|thumb|Pneumatic "Three term" pneumatic [[PID controller]], widely used before electronics became reliable and cheaper and safe to use in hazardous areas (Siemens Telepneu Example)]]
[[File:Kontrollrom Tyssedal.jpg|thumb|A pre-DCS/SCADA era central control room. Whilst the controls are centralised in one place, they are still discrete and not integrated into one system.]] 
[[File:Leitstand 2.jpg|thumb|A DCS control room where plant information and controls are displayed on computer graphics screens. The operators are seated and can view and control any part of the process from their screens, whilst retaining a plant overview.]]
Process control of large industrial plants has evolved through many stages. Initially, control would be from panels local to the process plant. However this required a large manpower resource to attend to these dispersed panels, and there was no overall view of the process. The next logical development was the transmission of all plant measurements to a permanently-manned central control room. Effectively this was the centralisation of all the localised panels, with the advantages of lower manning levels and easier overview of the process. Often the controllers were behind the control room panels, and all automatic and manual control outputs were transmitted back to plant. 

However, whilst providing a central control focus, this arrangement was inflexible as each control loop had its own controller hardware, and continual operator movement within the control room was required to view different parts of the process. With coming of electronic processors and graphic displays it became possible to replace these discrete controllers with computer-based algorithms, hosted on a network of input/output racks with their own control processors. These could be distributed around plant, and communicate with the graphic display in the control room or rooms. The distributed control concept was born. 

The introduction of DCSs and [[SCADA]] allowed easy interconnection and re-configuration of plant controls such as cascaded loops and interlocks, and easy interfacing with other production computer systems. It enabled sophisticated alarm handling, introduced automatic event logging, removed the need for physical records such as chart recorders, allowed the control racks to be networked and thereby located locally to plant to reduce cabling runs, and provided high level overviews of plant status and production levels.

== Applications ==
In some cases the sensor is a very minor element of the mechanism. Digital cameras and wristwatches might technically meet the loose definition of instrumentation because they record and/or display sensed information. Under most circumstances neither would be called instrumentation, but when used to measure the elapsed time of a race and to document the winner at the finish line, both would be called instrumentation.

===Household===
A very simple example of an instrumentation system is a mechanical [[thermostat]], used to control a household furnace and thus to control room temperature. A typical unit senses temperature with a [[bi-metallic strip]]. It displays temperature by a needle on the free end of the strip. It activates the furnace by a [[mercury switch]]. As the switch is rotated by the strip, the mercury makes physical (and thus electrical) contact between electrodes.

Another example of an instrumentation system is a [[Burglar alarm|home security system]]. Such a system consists of 
sensors (motion detection, switches to detect door openings), simple algorithms to detect intrusion, local control (arm/disarm) and remote monitoring of the system so that the police can be summoned. Communication is an inherent part of the design.

Kitchen appliances use sensors for control.
*A refrigerator maintains a constant temperature by measuring the internal temperature.
*A microwave oven sometimes cooks via a heat-sense-heat-sense cycle until sensing done.
*An automatic ice machine makes ice until a [[Miniature snap-action switch|limit switch]] is thrown.
*Pop-up bread [[toaster]]s can operate by time or by heat measurements. 
*Some ovens use a temperature probe to cook until a target internal food temperature is reached.
*A common [[toilet]] refills the water tank until a float closes the valve. The float is acting as a water level sensor.

===Automotive===
Modern automobiles have complex instrumentation. In addition to displays of engine rotational speed and vehicle linear speed, there are also displays of battery voltage and current, fluid levels, fluid temperatures, distance traveled and feedbacks of various controls (turn signals, parking brake, headlights, transmission position). Cautions may be displayed for special problems (fuel low, check engine, tire pressure low, door ajar, seat belt unfastened). Problems are recorded so they can be reported to  [[Vehicle bus|diagnostic equipment]]. Navigation systems can provide voice commands to reach a destination. Automotive instrumentation must be cheap and reliable over long periods in harsh environments. There may be independent [[airbag]] systems which contain sensors, logic and actuators. [[Anti-lock braking system|Anti-skid]] braking systems use sensors to control the brakes, while [[cruise control]] affects throttle position. A wide variety of services can be provided via communication links as the [[OnStar]] system. [[Autonomous car]]s (with exotic instrumentation) have been demonstrated.

===Aircraft===
Early aircraft had a few sensors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cap-ny153.org/aircraftinstrumentation.htm Aircraft Instrumentation - Leroy R. Grumman Cadet Squadron&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; "Steam gauges" converted air pressures into needle deflections that could be interpreted as altitude and airspeed. A magnetic compass provided a sense of direction. The displays to the pilot were as critical as the measurements.

A modern aircraft has a far more sophisticated suite of sensors and displays, which are embedded into [[avionics]] systems. The aircraft may contain [[inertial navigation system]]s, [[global positioning system]]s, [[weather radar]], autopilots, and aircraft stabilization systems. Redundant sensors are used for reliability. A subset of the information may be transferred to a [[Event data recorder|crash recorder]] to aid mishap investigations. Modern pilot displays now include computer displays including [[head-up display]]s.

[[Air traffic control radar beacon system|Air traffic control radar]] is distributed instrumentation system. The ground portion transmits an electromagnetic pulse and receives an echo (at least). Aircraft carry transponders that transmit codes on reception of the pulse. The system displays aircraft map location, an identifier and optionally altitude. The map location is based on sensed antenna direction and sensed time delay. The other information is embedded in the transponder transmission.

===Laboratory instrumentation===
Among the possible uses of the term is a collection of laboratory test equipment controlled by a computer through an IEEE-488 bus (also known as GPIB for General Purpose Instrument Bus or HPIB for Hewlitt Packard Instrument Bus). Laboratory equipment is available to measure many electrical and chemical quantities. Such a collection of equipment might be used to automate the testing of drinking water for pollutants.

== Measurement parameters==
Instrumentation is used to measure many parameters (physical values). These parameters include:

== Instrumentation engineering ==
[[Image:Pump with tank pid en.svg|thumb|The instrumentation part of a [[Piping and instrumentation diagram]] will be developed by an instrumentation engineer.]] 
'''Instrumentation engineering''' is the engineering specialization focused on the principle and operation of measuring instruments that are used in design and configuration of automated systems in electrical, pneumatic domains etc and the control of quantities being measured.
They typically work for industries with [[automated]] processes, such as [[Chemical plant|chemical]] or [[manufacturing]] plants, with the goal of improving system [[productivity]], reliability, safety, optimization and stability.
To control the parameters in a process or in a particular system, devices such as microprocessors, microcontrollers or PLCs are used, but their ultimate aim is to control the parameters of a system.

Instrumentation engineering is loosely defined because the required tasks are very domain dependent. An expert in the biomedical instrumentation of laboratory rats has very different concerns than the expert in rocket instrumentation. Common concerns of both are the selection of appropriate sensors based on size, weight, cost, reliability, accuracy, longevity, environmental robustness and frequency response. Some sensors are literally fired in artillery shells. Others sense thermonuclear explosions until destroyed. Invariably sensor data must be recorded, transmitted or displayed. Recording rates and capacities vary enormously. Transmission can be trivial or can be clandestine, encrypted and low-power in the presence of jamming. Displays can be trivially simple or can require consultation with [[human factors]] experts. Control system design varies from trivial to a separate specialty.

Instrumentation engineers are responsible for integrating the sensors with the recorders, transmitters, displays or control systems, and producing the [[Piping and instrumentation diagram]] for the process. They may design or specify installation, wiring and signal conditioning. They may be responsible for calibration, testing and maintenance of the system.

In a research environment it is common for subject matter experts to have substantial instrumentation system expertise. An astronomer knows the structure of the universe and a great deal about telescopes - optics, pointing and cameras (or other sensing elements). That often includes the hard-won knowledge of the operational procedures that provide the best results. For example, an astronomer is often knowledgeable of techniques to minimize temperature gradients that cause air turbulence within the telescope.

Instrumentation technologists, technicians and mechanics specialize in troubleshooting, repairing and maintaining instruments and instrumentation systems.

=== Typical Industrial Transmitter Signal Types ===
[[Current loop|Current Loop (4-20mA)]] - Electrical

[[Hart Protocol|HART]] - Data signalling often overlaid on a current loop.

[[FOUNDATION Fieldbus|Foundation Fieldbus]] - Data signalling

[[Profibus]] - Data signalling

==Impact of modern development==
Ralph Müller (1940) stated "That the history of physical science is largely the history of instruments and their intelligent use is well known. The broad generalizations and theories which have arisen from time to time have stood or fallen on the basis of accurate measurement, and in several instances new instruments have had to be devised for the purpose. There is little evidence to show that the mind of modern man is superior to that of the ancients. His tools are incomparably better."&lt;ref name="Katz"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Katz|first1=Eric|last2=Light|first2=Andrew|last3=Thompson|first3=William|title=Controlling technology : contemporary issues|date=2002|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst, NY|isbn=978-1573929837|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nny8OoQCZCoC&amp;pg=PA88|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baird"/&gt;{{rp|290}}

Davis Baird has argued that the major change associated with [[Floris Cohen]]{{'}}s identification of a "fourth big scientific revolution" after [[World War II]] is the development of scientific instrumentation, not only in [[chemistry]] but across the sciences.&lt;ref name="Baird"&gt;{{cite journal

As early as 1954, W A Wildhack discussed both the productive and destructive potential inherent in process control.&lt;ref name="Wildhack"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wildhack|first1=W. A.|title=Instrumentation--Revolution in Industry, Science, and Warfare|journal=Science|date=22 October 1954|volume=120|issue=3121|pages=15A–15A|doi=10.1126/science.120.3121.15A|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/120/3121/15A.long|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ability to make precise, verifiable and reproducible measurements of the natural world, at levels that were not previously observable, using scientific instrumentation, has "provided a different texture of the world".&lt;ref name="Hentschel"/&gt; This instrumentation revolution fundamentally changes human abilities to monitor and respond, as is illustrated in the examples of [[DDT]] monitoring and the use of [[Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy|UV spectrophotometry]] and [[gas chromatography]] to monitor [[water pollutants]].&lt;ref name="Morris"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hentschel"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hentschel|first1=Klaus|title=The Instrumental Revolution in Chemistry (Review Essay)|journal=Foundations of Chemistry|date=2003|volume=5|issue=2|pages=179–183|doi=10.1023/A:1023691917565|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1023691917565#/page-1|accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(Jane Bennett) data sheet (b. 7/31/57)}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[United States|American]] political theorist and philosopher. She is professor at the Department of Political Science, [[Johns Hopkins University School of Arts and Sciences#Departments|Johns Hopkins University School of Arts and Sciences]]. She is also the editor of the academic journal ''[[Political Theory (journal)|Political Theory]]''.&lt;ref name=Pol_Theory&gt;{{cite web|title=Political Theory: An International Journal of Political Philosophy|url=http://www.uk.sagepub.com/journalsProdDesc.nav?ct_p=manuscriptSubmission&amp;prodId=Journal200749&amp;crossRegion=eur|publisher=Sage|accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
Jane Bennett originally trained in environmental studies and political science. She then went on to [[Cornell University]] to study environmental science. After Cornell she studied political theory and gained her degree (''[[Latin honors#Types|magna cum laude]]'') in 1979 from [[Siena College]], [[Loudonville, New York]]. Whilst at Siena College Bennett met [[Kathy Ferguson]]. Bennett then went on to the [[University of Massachusetts]] and qualified as a doctor of [[political science]] in 1986.&lt;ref name=Minnesota_Review /&gt;&lt;ref name=CV&gt;{{cite web | title= Jane Bennett | url= http://politicalscience.jhu.edu/bios/jane-bennett/vita%202013%20November.doc | publisher= Department of Political Science, Johns Hopkins University | accessdate= 25 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical work==
Bennett's work considers [[ontology|ontological]] ideas about the [[Speculative realism#Transcendental Materialism / Neo-Vitalism|relationship between humans and 'things']], what she calls "vital materialism",
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"What counts as the material of vital materialism? Is it only human labour and the socio-economic entities made by men using raw materials? Or is materiality more potent than that? How can political theory do a better job of recognizing the active participation of nonhuman forces in every event and every stabilization? Is there a form of theory that can acknowledge a certain ‘thing-power’, that is, the irreducibility of objects to the human meanings or agendas they also embody?"''&lt;ref name="Vital_materialism"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Khan | first = Gulshan | title = Agency, nature and emergent properties: an interview with Jane Bennett | journal = Contemporary Political Theory | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 90–105 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | doi = 10.1057/cpt.2008.43 | date = February 2009 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1057/cpt.2008.43 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Los Angeles Review of Books'']&lt;/ref&gt; Bennett's argument is that, "Edibles, commodities, storms, and metals act as [[Agency (philosophy)|quasi agents]], with their own trajectories, potentialities and tendencies."&lt;ref name=Minnesota_Review&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Watson | first = Janell | title = Eco-sensibilities: interview with Jane Bennett | journal = Minnesota Review | volume = 81 | issue = 1 | pages = 147–158 | publisher = Duke University Press | doi = 10.1215/00265667-2332147 | date = October 2013 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1215/00265667-2332147 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public lectures she has given include "Impersonal Sympathy", a talk theorizing 'sympathy' in which she considered the alchemist-physician [[Paracelsus|Paracelsus (1493-1541)]] and [[Walt Whitman|Walt Whitman's]] collection of poetry, ''[[Leaves of Grass]]''.&lt;ref name=CISSC&gt;{{cite web|title=CISSC Lecture Series: Jane Bennett, Johns Hopkins University: Impersonal Sympathy |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728234301/http://cissc.concordia.ca/lecturesconferencesandevents/2012-13/?share=1|publisher=Center for Interdisciplinary Studies in Society and Culture, Concordia University, Montreal|accessdate=25 July 2014|date=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 Bennett delivered the annual Neal A.

The '''Latin American Public Opinion Project''' (LAPOP) is a research institute specializing in the development, implementation, and analysis of [[public opinion]] [[survey methodology|surveys]]. Founded by [[Mitchell A. Seligson]] over two decades ago, its principal focus is on governance and democracy in [[Latin America]]. The AmericasBarometer is the best-known survey produced by LAPOP.  It is the only survey of democratic public opinion and behavior that covers the Americas ([[North America|North]], [[Central America|Central]], [[South America|South]], and the [[Caribbean]]). It  measures democratic values and behaviors in the Americas using national probability samples of voting-age adults. [[Elizabeth Zechmeister]] is the director of LAPOP. Noam Lupu is associate director of LAPOP.

== History ==

LAPOP has its origins in studies of [[democracy|democratic values]] in Costa Rica. This pioneering public opinion research took place in the 1970s, a time in which much of the rest of Latin America was under the control of [[authoritarianism|authoritarian regimes]], prohibiting studies of public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vanderbilt.edu/magazines/arts-and-science/2010-11/survey-says/ |title=Vanderbilt University's Arts and Sciences Magazine, Fall 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;   As [[democratization]] expanded in Latin America, LAPOP grew in scope and size. Today LAPOP regularly carries out public opinion surveys in nearly every country in Latin America, Canada, the United States, and much of Caribbean.

== Structure ==

LAPOP is housed at [[Vanderbilt University]] in Nashville, Tennessee. Vanderbilt is a research university that has been a leader in the study of Latin America and the Caribbean for over 60 years. At this host institution, a team of faculty, staff, post-doctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students designs and analyzes the public opinion surveys generated by the project. The group also edits and publishes the regular Insights Series reports, each one of which examines a one facet of public opinion. LAPOP’s network extends far beyond the Vanderbilt campus, to include partner institutions throughout the Americas.

LAPOP functions as a consortium, working in partnership with numerous academic and non-governmental institutions in Latin America and the Caribbean. It collaborates with these institutions, sharing ideas for survey content and working together to disseminate the results of the public opinion surveys to the citizens of participating countries. This dissemination of results takes the form of systematic country reports, comparative studies, panel presentations, and media interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanderbilt.edu/lapop/pdfs/At-a-glance-v2.pdf |title=The AmericasBarometer at a Glance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The AmericasBarometer ==

In 2004, LAPOP established the AmericasBarometer as multi-country, regularly-conducted surveys of democratic values and behaviors in the Americas, organized by a consortium of academic and think-tank partners in the hemisphere. The first round included voting-age respondents from 11 countries. The second round of surveys took place in 2006 and included 22 countries from the hemisphere. The third round, 2008, included 24 countries in the Americas. The 2010 and 2012 round included 26 countries across North America, Latin America, and the Caribbean. The 2014/15 round consisted of over 50,000 interviews in 28 countries. The most recent round, 2016/17, comprises 29 national surveys and more than 43,000 interviews.

== Methods and Practices ==

Cutting-edge methods and transparent practices ensure that data collected by LAPOP are of the highest quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanderbilt.edu/lapop/CAM_Survey_Evaluation_Report_Final_11.29.04.pdf |title=Independent Evaluation of LAPOP Surveys}}&lt;/ref&gt;   These methods and practices include the following:

=== Pre-Survey ===
* Solicitation of input from a vast network of academics, practitioners, and policymakers
* Use of Vanderbilt University’s experimental research lab to test new items
* Extensive in-country pre-testing of survey items
* Translation of surveys into more than 15 [[Latin America#Language|languages]] spoken in the Americas
* Expert design of national [[Survey sampling#Probability sampling|probability samples]]
* Approval from Vanderbilt University’s [[Institutional review board|Institutional Review Board]] for the protection of human subjects

=== Implementation ===
* Rigorous training of all interviewers using guidelines published in extensive training manuals
* Partnerships with reputable survey organizations in the regions
* Widespread use of electronic handheld devices ([[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]] and smartphones) and software designed by LAPOP to allow multilingual interviews and extensive validity checks
* Participants are voting-age adults interviewed face to face in their households, except in Canada and the United States where the interviews are web-based

=== Post-survey ===
* Use of cutting-edge statistical programs and methods
* Presentation of results in clear, user-friendly graphs
* Public dissemination of results in surveyed design and methods on the LAPOP website
* Immediate uploading of data into LAPOP’s free interactive data analysis program

LAPOP’s resources and expertise allow it to conduct special projects requested by scholars, government institutions, and agencies concerned with democratic development. These have recently included novel experiments embedded within national surveys to assess issues of ethnicity and violence. In addition, these include an extensive new focus on randomized block experiments as a means of program evaluation.

== Use of LAPOP Data ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1432">'''Loop recording''' is the process of recording [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] continuously to an '''endless tape''' (if [[magnetic tape]] is used) or to [[computer memory]], or recording [[video]] feeds (such as from [[video surveillance]] or camera signals) on a [[video server]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evs.tv/Europe,%20Middle%20East%20Africa/English/Products/Technologies/Loop-Recording/page.aspx/1309 ''Loop recording definition @ EVS'']&lt;/ref&gt; 
This process is a never-ending one: at the end of the internal [[disk drive]], the recording process continues to record at the beginning, erasing the previously recorded material and replacing it with the new [[content (media)|content]].

Generally, it is possible to [[write-protect]] some selected parts (as [[video clip]]s) to prevent erasure.

This process is used on video servers to allow continuous recording, and instant access to any material [[ingestion (content)|ingest]]ed  in the previous hours.  This guarantees that the recorder will never miss an action in some live events such as live [[sport]]s.

== Video servers ==
This process is used in:
* the [[Xt(2)|XT&lt;nowiki&gt;[2]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] server from [[EVS Broadcast Equipment]] company
* the [https://archive.is/20071214141012/http://www.apa-it.at/cms/it/EN/loesungen.html?channel=CH0264&amp;doc=CMS1169550807427 APA-IT LoopRecorder].

The '''M.E.M. (Master of Environmental Management)''' is a degree designed for students with primary interests in careers in [[environmental policy]] and [[analysis]], [[stewardship]], [[education]], [[Consultant|consulting]], or [[management]] dealing with [[natural resource]] or [[Environmental quality|environmental]] issues. The program requires course work in both the [[Natural science|natural]] and [[social science]]s, with a particular focus on the relationship among [[science]], management, and [[policy]]. The ultimate purpose of the [[degree program]] is to prepare students to address ecological and social systems with scientific understanding and an ability to make sense of the complex underlying social and ecological context.

The value of an interdisciplinary environmental degree is best espoused by [[Aldo Leopold]], who obtained a [[Master of Forestry]] degree.

''"One of the requisites for an ecological comprehension of land is an understanding of ecology, and this is by no means co-extensive with 'education'; in fact, much higher education seems deliberately to avoid ecological concepts. An understanding of ecology does not necessarily originate in courses bearing ecological labels; it is quite as likely to be labeled geography, botany, agronomy, history, or economics. This is as it should be...".''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leopold|first=Aldo|title=A Sand County Almanac: And Sketches Here and There|year=1949|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7882">The '''Miami Science Barge''' (also known as the '''Science Barge''') is a floating [[marine laboratory]] and education platform docked in [[Museum Park (Miami)|Museum Park]], [[Miami]], FL since 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sentenac|first1=Hannah|title=Miami Science Barge to Debut in Museum Park Tomorrow for Earth Day|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/arts/miami-science-barge-to-debut-in-museum-park-tomorrow-for-earth-day-8400738|accessdate=8 May 2017|date= April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Barge, designed to help support a more sustainable city, has three main areas of focus: marine ecology and conservation, sustainability, and alternative agriculture. It is completely off-grid and off-pipe and provides approximately enough energy and food production to support an average American family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Arrowsmith|first1=Sue|title=Miami Science Barge offers city children chance to explore nature|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/downtown-miami/article95794857.html|accessdate=8 May 2017|agency=Miami Herald|publisher=McClatchy|date=August 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its first year, over 3000 students came aboard to learn about the innovative technology on the Barge. The vessel is open to the public on Saturday. 
The Miami Science Barge was conceived by Nathalie Manzano and designed by Manzano and [[Theodore Caplow|Ted Caplow]]. They were inspired by the [[Science Barge]] built in 2006 by New York Sun Works, designed by Caplow. The vessels are of similar size and both have a sustainable technology focus, but they respond to very different local environmentsand house differing technology and unique public education programs. The Miami Science Barge emphasizes aquaculture.
The Miami Science Barge was donated in April 2017 to the brand-new Philip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science, which currently owns and operates it.

== Early history == 
In 2015, [[Nathalie Manzano]] and [[Ted Caplow]] of [[CappSci]] won the [[Knight Cities Challenge]] grant competition from the [[John S. and James L. Knight Foundation]] with a proposal to build the Miami Science Barge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dahlberg|first1=Nancy|title=Miami Science Barge wins Knight award|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article16959965.html|accessdate=May 8, 2017|agency=Miami Herald|publisher=McClatchy|date=March 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Barge was a 120x30 steel construction barge from [[Grady Marine]] retrofitted with 2nd-hand [[shipping container]]s in 2015. With the generosity of Beau Payne of P &amp; L Towing, the staff of CappSci were able to design and build the power system and exhibits of the Barge on the Miami River prior to moving it to its official location in Museum Park in downtown Miami, FL.
The Miami Science Barge opened on [[Earth Day]], April 22, 2016. The following April, the Barge was gifted to [[Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science]].

== Technical details ==
The Miami Science Barge has three main areas of focus:

===Sustainability ===
The Barge is fully [[off-grid]]. It utilizes 48 [[solar panel]]s (donated by JinkoSolar) to generate enough power to run all of its systems. These panels are set into five arrays including a [[solar dance floor]] and a [[solar tracking system]]. Power is stored into two sets of batteries: [[lead-acid batteries]], and experimental Aquion [[M-Line battery modules]]. The panels provide about 75Kwh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=PennEnergy Editors|title=JinkoSolar Powers the Miami Science Barge|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2016/08/solar-power-news-jinkosolar-powers-the-miami-science-barge.html|website=Renewable Energy World|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also [[off-pipe]], meaning that all of its fresh water comes from a rainwater catchment system located about the classroom area. The water is stored in a 900-gallon cistern. The salt water comes directly from [[Biscayne Bay]]. No discharge is released from the Barge. Waste water is collected in constructed wetland troughs where the water is filtered or in some cases may evaporate. 
Furthermore, the Barge aimed to utilize only sustainable material in construction, i.e. the [[Kebony]] deck throughout the farm area. Kebony is an eco-friendly alternative to tropical hardwoods, using a bio-based seal instead of a synthetic one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miami Science Barge Opens|url=http://kebony.com/us/blog/miami-science-barge-opens/|website=Kebony.com|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The staff on the Barge also follow strict habits of sustainability, including prohibiting [[single-use plastic]]s from being used on board for events and by diligently cleaning debris found in the notch.

===Alternative agriculture===
On board are a variety of sustainable and unconventional agriculture systems including [[hydroponics]], [[aeroponics]], aquaculture, and aquaponics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miami Science Barge|url=https://ezgrogarden.com/commercial-sytems/miami-science-barge/|website=EZ Grow Gardens|publisher=Commercial Systems, News|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Hydroponics and aeroponics are forms of growing produce that utilizes water and nutrients most efficiently. Aquaculture systems grow fish and other marine creature for consumption so as not to harm the balance in the ocean and aquaponics is a combination of aquaculture and aquaponics, where marine life produce waste which is consumed by plants.
On board is also a [[vertically integrated greenhouse]] (patented by Caplow and Zak W. Adams).

===Marine ecology and conservation===
Along with the [[aquaponic]] and [[aquaculture]] tanks, there are multiple tanks showcasing marine life. Towards the entrance of the Barge, there is a [[coral]] tank, developed with the help of Dr. [[Diego Lirman]] at the [[University of Miami]] and Rescue a Reef. It is the only tank in South Florida representing what [[Coral reef protection#Restoration|coral restoration]] in the wild looks like. Other exhibit tanks show sea life from Biscayne Bay, including [[sea horse]]s, a [[Petrochirus diogenes|giant hermit crab]], erosion-preventing [[sea grass]]es, [[mangrove]]s, and a myriad of local fish.

These tanks are used to educate about the importance of diversity in Miami’s local ecology. Guest scientists are invited most weekends and on the 3rd Wednesday of every month for Sip of Science to promote the conservation of the environment.

== Response ==
The Miami Science Barge opened on [[Earth Day]], April 22, 2016 and was attended by dignitary speakers including City of Miami Commissioner [[Frank Carollo]], who in his remarks called the Barge "a symbol of Miami's diversity not only in people, but in ideas, as well as, a symbol of our community's commitment to environmental education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miami Commissioner &amp; Bayfront Park  Management Trust Chairman Frank Carollo invites the public to the official launching of the Miami Science Barge, on Earth Day April 22nd|url=http://www.miamigov.com/comm/docs/Press_Releases/2016/04-19%20Miami%20Science%20Barge.htm|website=Miamigov.com|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;" Miami Dade County Public Schools Superintendent Alberto Carvalho, Knight Foundation’s Miami Program Director Matt Haggman, and Children Trust’s Founding Board Chair David Lawrence, Jr. 
In December 2016, Miami Science Barge was named one of “The Ten Best Things to Do in Downtown Miami” by Miami New Times&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shim Roth|first1=Minhae|title=The Ten Best Things to Do in Downtown Miami|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/arts/the-ten-best-things-to-do-in-downtown-miami-8981277|accessdate=8 May 2017|agency=Miami New Times|date=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mirza Sahiba''''' ({{lang-pa|ਮਿਰਜ਼ਾ ਸਾਹਿਬਾਂ}}, {{lang|pa|مرزا صاحباں}}, ''{{IAST|mirzā sāhibāṁ}}'') is one of the three popular tragic romances of [[Punjab]]. The other two are ''[[Heer Ranjha]]'', ''[[Sohni Mahiwal]]'' . There are six other popular folklore stories in Punjab: ''[[Momal Rano]]'', [[Sassui Punnhun|Sassi Punhoon]], ''[[Umar Marvi]]'', ''[[LiLa Chanesar]]'', ''[[Noori Jam Tamachi]]'' and ''[[Dhaj, Ror Kumar]]''. These nine tragic romances are popular in Punjab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://punjabiworld.com/Creative-Punjab/Legends-of-Punjab/love-legends-of-punjab.html|title=Love Legends In History of Punjab|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These six and ''[[Sorath Rai Diyach]]'' are originally from [[Sindh]], and along with ''Sohni Mahiwal'' and ''Sassi Punnun'' are commonly known as Seven Queens ({{lang-sd|ست صورميون}}) of [[Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesindhuworld.com/lila_chanesar.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721224737/http://www.thesindhuworld.com/lila_chanesar.html |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are culturally included in both [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] and [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]] traditions.

''Mirza Sahiba'' was first written by the Punjabi sofi poet Hafiz Barkhudar Ranjha from Tahat Hazara District Sargodha Pakistan. Hafiz Barkhudar was student of a Hakeem family, ancestors of Punjab and do Bait under Hakeem family ancestors. That Hakeem family brought Hafiz Sahab from Tahat Hazara district Sargodha to a place in Sialkot Pakistan named Chitti Sheikhan. Hafiz Sahab lived and died in Chitti Sheikhan.

Mirza Khan was the son of Wanjhal Khan, the leader of the Kharal jat/Rajput Tribe origin in Danabad, a town in the [[Jaranwala]] area of [[Faisalabad]], [[Pakistan]]. Sahiba was the daughter of Mahni, the chief of Khewa, a town in Sial Territory in the [[Jhang]] district, Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Mirza_Sahiban|title=Mirza Sahiban - SikhiWiki, free Sikh encyclopedia.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
A long time ago in the village of Kheewa, a town in the control of Sial tribe of [[Jat people|Jats]], a woman gave birth to a baby boy. Unfortunately, the woman died after giving birth and was unable to breastfeed her son. However, another woman nearby had recently given birth to a girl. This woman took it upon herself to help the little boy. She fed this boy as she did her own daughter.

Thus, as is the custom for such occasions, these two children became “milk siblings” because they were given the same milk to drink. Later as the children became adults, the girl, named Fateh Bibi, got married and moved a day’s journey on horseback away to the village of Danababad near present-day Faisalabad. Fateh Bibi married a man named Wanjal, the Sardar of the Kharrals, and they had a strong son named Mirza.

Meanwhile, Fateh Bibi’s milk brother, no longer a boy but a man named Khewa Khan, Sardar of the Sial Jats, had a daughter named Sahiba.

When it was time to enroll the children in school, Mirza’s parents had decided to send him to his “milk uncle’s” house so he could get educated there. Sahiba’s father enrolled her and her “cousin” into classes to learn the Quran together since they were of the same age. 

Mirza did not know that his “cousin” Sahiba was such a beauty one can only dream of beholding. He did not notice her at first when he came to Kheewa to study because they were just children. As the two children grew into adolescence, feelings of love began to blossom between the two. 

One day the adventurous young Mirza took a different path home while walking back from school. There was a bazaar on that street. He saw Sahiba buying some vegetables for her family. He watched as she asked for various squashes and leaves to cook. When the merchant began to weigh her purchases, he weighed out extra because he was lost in her beauty. Mirza, too, was transfixed by her gracefulness and raced all the way home fueled by love.

Mirza became skilled as a horseman and archer as he grew older. He rode on a powerful steed named Bakki who swiftly maneuvered through the land. Mirza was so skillful that every arrow he shot would willfully go exactly where he wanted. Sahiba only grew more and more beautiful with time.

Soon, their love began to blossom. Mirza could not live without his Sahiba. They were lost in their own world. Once, when Sahiba had pronounced her lessons incorrectly, her maulvi beat her with a chimmak.  This thin branch gives a person a burning sting when swatted with it. As Sahiba received her punishment with the chimmak, she spoke to the maulvi. 

Sadly, their days of blissful love did not last. Sahiba’s parents found out about the love affair and sent Mirza back home to his parents. Not too long after that, they arranged Sahiba’s marriage to a man named Tahir Khan. He was from the same town. With Mirza back home, Sahiba’s parents were able to prepare for the wedding without any interruptions. 

Sahiba, via her friend, a Brahmin named Karmu, sent word of her unfortunate marriage to her darling Mirza.  As soon as he heard of this, he made plans to leave.  His family tried to stop him but he would not succumb to their pleas.  He had to go.  Before Mirza left, his father, seeing that there was no other way, went to Mirza and told him that if he went, then he must be sure to return with Sahiba or else it would bring great dishonor. With those words, Wanjal gave his son his blessings to pursue his love.
“Chal, my Bakki,” Mirza, equipped with his bow and arrows, commanded his horse to ride on to the village of Kheewa.

Mirza reached Sahiba on the day of the wedding right before the ceremony was about to proceed. He opened the door to the room Sahiba was waiting in and entered secretly. He admired her; she was dressed in bright red wedding clothes, her delicate hands darkly painted with mehndi. Without waiting another moment, he held her hand and took her away with him on horseback and rode until he thought that they had reached a safe distance.  Tired, he decided to rest by under the shade of a tree while his sweet Sahiba watched over him.

Meanwhile, back at the wedding party, Sahiba brothers called for her to come down to proceed with the ceremonies. When she did not come, her brothers realized that something was wrong. Sahiba’s brothers, the jilted bridegroom, and other male cousins rode on horseback in search for Mirza and Sahiba.

Sahiba, while keeping watch over her slumbering beloved, feared that her brothers would soon catch up. She did not know what to do. If her brothers came and Mirza woke up then her brothers would surely die at the hands of Mirza’s quick arrows.

With the hope of her brothers taking pity on her, Sahiba reached Mirza’s quiver and broke each sharp arrow it contained in half.  She believed that no blood would be spilled this way. Suddenly, Sahiba’s brothers and relatives found the couple under the tree. With one quick shot from Sahiba’s brother’s bow, Mirza awoke to an arrow piercing his throat. Mirza reached for his arrow and saw all the broken pieces. He looked up at Sahiba, searching for an answer in her face but was struck with yet another arrow, this time in the chest. Sahiba threw herself over him and together, they died.

==In popular culture==
The tale of Mirza Sahiban is part of popular [[Punjabi culture]]. There are many folk song versions, including the hit version titled "Mirza" sung by the legendary [[Alam Lohar]]. He was the first main Punjabi singer to bring this story to a song format and had a distinct way of singing it, with extreme vocal strength with Algoza (Jhori) and Chimta in 1941. Since then many other Punjabi singers have followed his style, including [[Noor Jehan]] for the film ''Mirza Jat'', released in 1982.{{cn|date=March 2015}}

There have been various film interpretations of the folk tale.
* ''Mirza Jat'' (1982) is a Pakistani Punjabi film starring [[Shahid (actor)|Shahid Hameed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318449/reference|title=Mirza Jat (1982)|work=[[IMDB]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Hero Hitler in Love]]'' (2011), an Indian Punjabi film starring [[Babbu Maan]] and [[Mouni Roy]], creates a modern Mirza and Sahiban story with a twist.
* ''[[Mirza – The Untold Story]]'' (2012), an Indian Punjabi film, is a modern rendition of Mirza and Sahiban Story, with the title song sung by Arif Lohar, son of (late) Alam Lohar.
* ''[[Mirzya (film)|Mirzya]]'' (2016), an Indian Hindi film directed by [[Rakesh Omprakash Mehra]], is based on Mirza and Sahiban and closely follows the original story. [[Harshvardhan Kapoor]] plays Mirza and [[Saiyami Kher]] plays Sahiba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/WATCH-Harshvardhan-Kapoors-Mirziya-logo-trailer-unveiled/articleshow/50204809.cms?|title=WATCH: Harshvardhan Kapoor's 'Mirziya' logo trailer unveiled!|date=16 Dec 2015|work=[[The Times of India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Mirza Juuliet]]'' (2017), an Indian Hindi film, is a modern retelling of the original story. It is set in [[Uttar Pradesh]], showing the nexus between politicians and criminals.

The '''profundal zone''' is a deep zone of an inland body of freestanding water, such as a [[lake]] or [[pond]], located below the range of effective light penetration.  This is typically below the [[thermocline]], the vertical zone in the water through which [[temperature]] drops rapidly. The temperature difference may be large enough to hamper mixing with the littoral zone in some seasons which causes a decrease in oxygen concentrations.  The profundal is often defined, in accordance with Thienemann (1925), as the deepest, vegetation-free, and muddy zone of the lacustrine benthal.&lt;ref&gt;Thienemann, A. 1925. Die Binnengewässer Mitteleuropas. Eine limnologiche Einführung. Binnengewässer 1. Stuttgart.&lt;/ref&gt; The profundal zone is often part of the [[aphotic zone]].

The lack of light and oxygen in the profundal zone determines the type of biological community that can live in this region and this is distinctly different from the community in the overlying waters.&lt;ref&gt;Thienemann, A. 1920. Untersuchungen über die Beziehungen zwischen dem Sauerstoff gehalt des Wassers und der Zusammensetzung der Fauna in norddeutschen Seen. Archiv für Hydrobiologie 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  The profundal macrofauna is therefore characterized by physiological and behavioural adaptations to low oxygen concentration. [[Chironomidae]] and [[Oligochaetae]] often dominate the benthic fauna of the profundal zone because they possess [[hemoglobin]] like molecules to extract oxygen from poorly oxygenated water.&lt;ref name="IntPanis"&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:RicciocarposNatans8.jpg|thumb|Rosette growth form of the [[liverwort]] ''[[Ricciocarpos natans]]''.]]
In botany, a '''rosette''' is a circular arrangement of leaves or of structures resembling leaves.

In flowering plants, rosettes usually sit near the soil, their structure is an example of a [[Aerial stem modification|modified stem]] in which the [[internode (botany)|internode]] gaps between the leaves do not expand, so that all the leaves remain clustered tightly together and at a similar height.

In [[bryophyte]]s and [[algae]], a rosette results from the repeated branching of the [[thallus]] as the plant grows, resulting in a circular outline.

==Taxonomies==
Many plant [[family (taxonomy)|families]] have varieties with rosette morphology; they are particularly common in [[Asteraceae]] (such as [[dandelion]]s), [[Brassicaceae]] (such as [[cabbage]]), and [[Bromeliaceae]]. The fern, ''[[Blechnum fluviatile]]'' or [[New Zealand]] Water Fern (''kiwikiwi'') is a rosette plant.

==Function in flowering plants==
Often, rosettes form in [[Perennial plant|perennial]] plants whose upper foliage dies back with the remaining vegetation protecting the plant. Another form occurs when [[Internode (botany)|internodes]] along a stem are shortened, bringing the leaves closer together, as in [[lettuce]] and [[dandelion]] and some [[succulent]]s.&lt;ref name="biologie.uni-hamburg.de"&gt;[http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e02/02c.htm Botany online: Features of Flowering Plants - Leaves&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514141753/http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e02/02c.htm |date=2008-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (When plants such as lettuce grow too quickly, the stem lengthens instead, a condition known as [[Bolting (horticulture)|bolting]].) In yet other forms, the rosette persists at the base of the plant (such as the dandelion), and there is a [[taproot]].

===Protection===
[[File:Agave americana4.jpg|right|thumb|Rosette of leaves of ''[[Agave americana]]'']]
Part of the protective function of a rosette like the dandelion is that it is hard to pull from the ground; the leaves come away easily while the taproot is left intact.

Another kind of protection is provided by the ''caulescent rosette'' which is part of the growth form of the giant genus ''[[Espeletia]]'' in South America, which has a well-developed stem above the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evoandes.net/espeletiapage.html shows many images] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705233052/http://www.evoandes.net/espeletiapage.html |date=2008-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In tropical alpine environments a wide variety of plants in different plant families and different parts of the world have evolved this [[growth form]] characterized by evergreen rosettes growing above [[marcescent]] leaves. Examples where this arrangement has been confirmed to improve survival, help water balance, or protect the plant from cold injury are ''[[Espeletia]] schultzii'' and ''Espeletia timotensis'', both from the [[Andes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=688033&amp;q=marcescent+leaves+&amp;uid=788491162&amp;setcookie=yes Goldstein, G. and Meinzer, F.1983. Influence of insulating dead leaves and low temperatures on water balance in an Andean giant rosette plant. ''Plant, Cell &amp; Environment'' 6: 649-656.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2388171 Smith, Alan P.1979. Function of dead leaves in ''Espeletia schultzii'' (Compositae), and Andean caulescent rosette species. ''Biotropica'' 11: 43-47.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form==
The rosette form is the structure, the relationship of the parts, and the variations within it, as shown in the following study from a [[herbarium]]:

*''[[Dryas octopetala]]'' (White Dryas, Rosaceae) has a leaf rosette of leaf blades with a short [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]], slim, egg-shaped leaves with cordate bases with clearly and regularly toothed margins, and single flowers on usually long [[Peduncle (botany)|peduncle]]s or stalks, two to four centimetres across. The flowers have seven to nine, often even more, white egg-shaped petals. The sepals are [[lanceolate]].&lt;ref name=whorl&gt;[http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e02/rosetten.htm Botany online: Features of flowering Plants - Rosettes - Whorls&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Silene nutans]]'' (Nottingham Catchfly, Caryophyllaceae) shows ensiform-lanceolate leaves. The slightly rosette-like ground leaves are bigger and of different shape than the sparse, [[opposite leaves]] on the stem.&lt;ref name=whorl /&gt; This is explained in that side shoots with greatly prolonged internodes may spring from rosettes. They have one or more flowers at their tip, like the [[Primula vulgaris|primrose]]. Especially in biennial plants, the main shoot can, too, grow with prolonged internodes and even branch. It is not unusual that the leaves of the rosette and those of the shoot differ in shape.&lt;ref name="biologie.uni-hamburg.de"/&gt;

As form then, "rosette" is used to describe plants that perpetually grow as a rosette and the immature stage of plants such as some ferns.

[[File:MUSTARD.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Segmented regression|SegReg]] program: yield of mustard ([[colza]]) and soil salinity]]
'''Soil salinity control''' relates to controlling the problem of soil salinity and reclaiming salinized agricultural land.

The aim of soil salinity control is to prevent [[soil degradation]] by [[salination]] and [[land reclamation|reclaim]] already salty (saline) soils. Soil reclamation is also called soil improvement, rehabilitation, remediation, recuperation, or amelioration.

The primary man-made cause of [[Soil salinity|salinization]] is [[irrigation]]. [[river|River water]] or [[groundwater]] used in irrigation contains salts, which remain behind in the soil after the water has [[evaporation|evaporated]].

The primary method of controlling soil salinity is to permit 10-20% of the irrigation water to [[Leaching model|leach]] the soil,that will be drained and discharged through an appropriate [[Drainage system (agriculture)|drainage system]]. The salt concentration of the [[Watertable control|drainage water]] is normally 5 to 10 times higher than that of the irrigation water, thus salt export matches salt import and it will not accumulate.

==The soil salinity problem==

[[soil salinity|Salty (saline) soils]] are [[soil]]s that have a high [[salt]] content.  The predominant salt is normally [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl, "table salt"). [[Saline soils]] are therefore also ''sodic soils'' but there may be sodic soils that are not saline, but [[alkaline soils|alkaline]].

{{quotebox|title=World Soil Salt Degradation|This damage is an average of 2,000 hectares of irrigated land in arid and semi-arid areas daily for more than 20 years across 75 countries (each week the world loses an area larger than Manhattan)...To feed the world's anticipated nine billion people by 2050, and with little new productive land available, it's a case of all lands needed on deck.&amp;mdash;''principal author Manzoor Qadir, Assistant Director, Water and Human Development, at UN University's Canadian-based Institute for Water, Environment and Health''&lt;ref name="physorg102014"&gt;http://phys.org/news/2014-10-world-hectares-farm-soil-daily.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
}}
{{clear}}

According to a study by UN University, about {{convert|62|e6ha|e3sqmi e6acre|abbr=none}}, representing 20% of the world's irrigated lands are affected, up from {{convert|45|e6ha|e3sqmi e6acre|abbr=unit}} in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="physorg102014"/&gt;  In the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]], home to over 10% of the world's population, crop yield losses for [[wheat]], [[rice]], [[sugarcane]] and [[cotton]] grown on salt-affected lands could be 40%, 45%, 48%, and 63%, respectively.&lt;ref name="physorg102014"/&gt;

Salty soils are a common feature and an [[Environmental impact of irrigation|environmental problem]] in [[irrigated land]]s in [[arid]] and [[semi-arid]] regions, resulting in poor or little crop production.&lt;ref&gt;I.P. Abrol, J.S.P Yadav, and F. Massoud 1988. Salt affected soils and their management, Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO), Soils Bulletin 39.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The problems are often associated with high [[water table]]s, caused by a lack of natural [[subsurface drainage]] to the underground. Poor subsurface drainage may be caused by insufficient transport capacity of the [[aquifer]] or because water cannot exit the aquifer, for instance if the aquifer is situated in a [[topographical]] depression.

Worldwide, the major factor in the development of saline soils is a lack of precipitation.  Most naturally saline soils are found in [[arid|(semi)arid regions]] and [[semi arid|climates]] of the earth.

===Primary cause===
[[File:Soil Salinity2.jpg|thumb|250px|Irrigated saline land with poor crop stand]]
The primary cause of man-made salinization is the salt brought in with irrigation water. All irrigation water derived from rivers or groundwater, however 'sweet', contains salts that remain behind in the soil after the water has evaporated.

For example, assuming irrigation water with a low salt concentration of 0.3 g/l (equal to 0.3&amp;nbsp;kg/m³ corresponding to an electric conductivity of about 0.5 FdS/m) and a modest annual supply of irrigation water of 10,000 m³/ha (almost 3&amp;nbsp;mm/day) brings 3,000&amp;nbsp;kg salt/ha each year. In the absence of sufficient natural drainage (as in waterlogged soils) and without a proper leaching and [[drainage]] program to remove salts, this would lead to a high soil salinity and reduced [[crop yield]]s in the long run.

Much of the water used in irrigation has a higher salt content than in this example, which is compounded by the fact that many irrigation projects use a far greater annual supply of water. [[Sugar cane]], for example, needs about 20,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/ha of water per year. As a result, irrigated areas often receive more than 3,000&amp;nbsp;kg/ha of salt per year and some receive as much as 10,000&amp;nbsp;kg/ha/year.

===Secondary cause===
The secondary cause of salinization is [[Waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogging]] in irrigated land. Irrigation causes changes to the natural [[Hydrology (agriculture)|water balance]] of irrigated lands. Large quantities of water in irrigation projects are not consumed by plants and must go somewhere. In irrigation projects it is impossible to achieve 100% irrigation efficiency where all the irrigation water is consumed by the plants. The maximum attainable irrigation efficiency is about 70% but usually it is less than 60%. This means that minimum 30%, but usually more than 40% of the irrigation water is not evaporated and it must go somewhere.

Most of the water lost this way is stored underground which can change the original [[geohydrology|hydrology]] of [[aquifer|local aquifers]] considerably. Many aquifers cannot absorb and transport these quantities of water and so the [[water table]] rises leading to water logging.

Waterlogging causes three problems: 
* The shallow water table and lack of [[Oxygenation (environmental)|oxygenation]] of the root zone reduces the yield of most crops
* It leads to an accumulation of salts brought in with the irrigation water as their removal through the aquifer is blocked
* With the upward [[seepage]] of [[groundwater]] more salts are brought into the soil and the salination is aggravated

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Salt affected area===
Normally, the salinization of agricultural land affects a considerable area of irrigation projects, on the order of 20 to 30%. When the agriculture in such a fraction of the land is abandoned, a new salt and [[Hydrology (agriculture)|water balance]] is attained, a new equilibrium is reached, and the situation becomes stable.

In India alone, thousands of square kilometres have been severely salinized. China and Pakistan do not lag much behind (perhaps China has even more salt affected land than India). A regional distribution of the 3,230,000&amp;nbsp;km² of saline land worldwide is shown in the following table derived from the FAO/UNESCO Soil Map of the World.&lt;ref&gt;R.Brinkman, 1980.

[[File:GOHANA2.jpg|thumb|250px|[[CumFreq]] program: spatial variation of soil salinity]]

===Spatial variation===
Although the principles of the processes of salinization are fairly easy to understand, it is more difficult to explain why certain parts of the land suffer from the problems and other parts do not, or to [[predict]] accurately which part of the land will fall victim. The main reason for this is the variation of natural conditions in time and space, the usually uneven distribution of the irrigation water, and the seasonal or yearly changes of [[agricultural practices]]. Only in lands with undulating [[topography]] is the prediction simple: the depressional areas will degrade the most.

The preparation of salt and water balances&lt;ref name="Balances" /&gt; for distinguishable sub-areas in the [[irrigation]] project, or the use of agro-hydro-salinity models,&lt;ref name="Snellen"&gt;[http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/toolsalt.pdf SaltMod: ''a tool for interweaving of irrigation and drainage for salinity control'']. In: W.B.Snellen (ed.), Towards integration of irrigation, and drainage management. ILRI Special report, p. 41-43. International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt; can be helpful in explaining or predicting the extent and severity of the problems.

==Diagnosis==
[[File:maize egypt.png|thumb|250px|The maize crop (corn) in Egypt has a salt tolerance of ECe=5.5 dS/m beyond which the yield declines &lt;ref&gt; H.J. Nijland and S. El Guindy, ''Crop yields, watertable depth and soil salinity in the Nile Delta, Egypt''. In: Annual report 1983. International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:rice egypt.png|thumb|250px|The rice crop in Egypt has a similar salt tolerance as maize. &lt;ref&gt; On line collection of salt tolerance data of agricultural crops from measurements in farmers' fields [https://www.waterlog.info/croptol.htm] &lt;/ref&gt; ]]

===Measurement===
Soil salinity is measured as the salt [[concentration]] of the soil [[solution]] in tems of g/l or [[electric conductivity]] (EC) in [[Siemens (unit)|dS/m]]. The relation  between these two units is about 5/3 : y g/l =&gt; 5y/3 dS/m. [[Seawater]] may have a salt concentration of 30 g/l (3%) and an EC of 50 dS/m.

The standard for the determination of soil salinity is from an extract of a saturated paste of the soil, and the EC is then written as ECe. The extract is obtained by [[centrifugation]]. The salinity can more easily be measured, without centrifugation, in a 2:1 or 5:1 water:soil mixture (in terms of g water per g dry soil) than from a saturated paste. The relation between ECe and EC&lt;sub&gt;2:1&lt;/sub&gt; is about 4, hence : ECe&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;EC&lt;sub&gt;1:2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;ILRI, 2003, ''This paper discusses soil salinity''. Lecture notes, International Course on Land Drainage International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands. On line: [http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/salinity.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification===
Soils are considered saline when the ECe &gt; 4.&lt;ref&gt;L.A.Richards (Ed.), 1954. Diagnosis and improvement of saline and alkali soils. USDA Agricultural Handbook 60. [http://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htm?docid=10158&amp;page=2 On internet]&lt;/ref&gt; When 4 &lt; ECe &lt; 8, the soil is called slightly saline, when 8 &lt; ECe &lt; 16 it is called (moderately) saline, and when ECe&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;16 severely saline.

===Crop tolerance===
Sensitive crops lose their vigor already in slightly saline soils, most crops are negatively affected by (moderately) saline soils, and only salinity resistant crops thrive in severely saline soils. The University of Wyoming &lt;ref name="Alan"&gt;Alan D. Blaylock, 1994, ''Soil Salinity and Salt tolerance of Horticultural and Landscape Plants. [http://www.wyomingextension.org/agpubs/pubs/WY988.PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Government of Alberta &lt;ref name="Albert"&gt;Government of Alberta, [http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/agdex3303 ''Salt tolerance of Plants'']&lt;/ref&gt; report data on the salt tolerance of plants.

==Principles of salinity control==
[[Drainage system (agriculture)|Drainage]] is the primary method of controlling soil salinity. The system should permit a small fraction of the irrigation water (about 10 to 20 percent, the drainage or leaching fraction) to be drained and discharged out of the irrigation project.
&lt;ref name="Hoorn"&gt;J.W. van Hoorn and J.G. van Alphen (2006), Salinity control. In: H.P. Ritzema (Ed.), Drainage Principles and Applications, p. 533-600, Publication 16, International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands. {{ISBN|90-70754-33-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In irrigated areas where salinity is stable, the salt concentration of the drainage water is normally 5 to 10 times higher than that of the irrigation water. Salt export matches salt import and salt will not accumulate.

When reclaiming already salinized soils, the salt concentration of the drainage water will initially be much higher than that of the irrigation water (for example 50 times higher). Salt export will greatly exceed salt import, so that with the same drainage fraction a rapid desalinization occurs. After one or two years, the soil salinity is decreased so much, that the salinity of the drainage water has come down to a normal value and a new, favorable, equilibrium is reached.

In regions with pronounced [[dry season|dry]] and [[wet season]]s, the drainage system may be operated in the wet season only, and closed during the dry season. This practice of checked or controlled drainage saves irrigation water.

The discharge of salty drainage water may pose ''environmental problems'' to downstream areas. The environmental hazards must be considered very carefully and, if necessary mitigating measures must be taken. If possible, the drainage must be limited to wet seasons only, when the salty effluent inflicts the least harm.

==Drainage systems==
[[File:DrainSection2.png|thumb|left|250px|Parameters of a horizontal drainage system]]
[[File:WellDrain2.png|thumb|right|250px|Parameters of a vertical drainage system]]
Land drainage for soil salinity control is usually by ''horizontal drainage system'' (figure left), but ''vertical systems'' (figure right) are also employed.

The drainage system designed to evacuate salty water also lowers the [[water table]]. To reduce the cost of the system, the lowering must be reduced to a minimum. The highest permissible level of the water table (or the shallowest permissible depth) depends on the irrigation and agricultural practices and kind of crops.

In many cases a seasonal average water table depth of 0.6 to 0.8 m is deep enough. This means that the water table may occasionally be less than 0.6 m (say 0.2 m just after an irrigation or a rain storm). This automatically implies that, in other occasions, the water table will be deeper than 0.8 m (say 1.2 m). The fluctuation of the water table helps in the breathing function of the soil while the expulsion of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) produced by the [[plant]] [[root]]s and the inhalation of fresh [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is promoted.

The establishing of a not too deep water table offers the additional advantage that excessive field irrigation is discouraged, as the crop yield would be negatively affected by the resulting elevated water table, and irrigation water may be saved.

The statements made above on the optimum depth of the water table are very general, because in some instances the required water table may be still shallower than indicated (for example in rice paddies), while in other instances it must be considerably deeper (for example in some [[orchard]]s). The establishment of the optimum depth of the water table is in the realm of [[Watertable control|agricultural drainage criteria]].&lt;ref&gt;''Agricultural Drainage Criteria'', Chapter 17 in: H.P.Ritzema (2006), Drainage Principles and Applications, Publication 16, International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands. {{ISBN|90-70754-33-9}}. On line : [http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/chap17.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soil leaching==
[[File:SoilLeaching2.jpg|thumb|250px|Water balance factors in the soil]]
The [[vadose zone]] of the [[soil]] below the soil surface and the [[watertable]] is subject to four main [[hydrology|hydrological]] inflow and outflow factors:&lt;ref name="Balances" /&gt;
*[[Infiltration (hydrology)|Infiltration]] of rain and [[irrigation]] water (Irr) into the soil through the soil surface (Inf) :
*Inf = Rain + Irr
*[[Evaporation]] of soil water through plants and directly into the air through the soil surface (Evap)
*[[Percolation]] of water from the unsaturated zone soil into the groundwater through the watertable (Perc)
*[[Capillary rise]] of [[groundwater]] moving by capillary suction forces into the unsaturated zone(Cap)
In [[steady state]] (i.e. the amount of water stored in the unsaturated zone does not change in the long run) the [[Hydrology (agriculture)|water balance]] of the unsaturated zone reads: Inflow = Outflow, thus:
*Inf + Cap = Evap + Perc &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; or :
*Irr + Rain + Cap = Evap + Perc
and the ''salt balance'' is
*Irr.Ci + Cap.Cc = Evap.Fc.Ce + Perc.Cp + Ss
where Ci is the salt [[concentration]] of the irrigation water, Cc is the salt concentration of the capillary rise, equal to the salt concentration of the upper part of the groundwater body, Fc is the fraction of the total evaporation transpired by plants, Ce is the salt concentration of the water taken up by the plant roots, Cp is the salt concentration of the percolation water, and Ss is the increase of salt storage in the unsaturated soil. This assumes that the rainfall contains no salts. Only along the coast this may not be true. Further it is assumed that no [[Surface runoff|runoff]] or surface drainage occurs.&lt;br&gt;
The amount of  removed by plants (Evap.Fc.Ce) is usually negligibly small: Evap.Fc.Ce = 0
[[File:SALTMOD4.JPG|thumb|250px|Leaching curves, calibrating leaching efficiency]]
The salt concentration Cp can be taken as a part of the salt concentration of the soil in the unsaturated zone (Cu) giving: Cp=Le.Cu, where Le is the [[Leaching model|leaching efficiency]]. The leaching efficiency is often in the order of 0.7 to 0.8,&lt;ref&gt;R.J.Oosterbaan and M.A.Senna, 1990. Using SaltMod to predict drainage and salinity control in the Nile delta. In: Annual Report 1989, International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands, p. 63-74. See ''Case Study Egypt'' in the SaltMod manual : [http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/saltmod.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; but in poorly [[soil structure|structured]], heavy [[clay]] soils it may be less. In the Leziria Grande polder in the delta of the Tagus river in Portugal it was found that the leaching efficiency was only 0.15.&lt;ref&gt;E.A. Vanegas Chacon, 1990. Using SaltMod to predict desalinization in the Leziria Grande Polder, Portugal. Thesis. Wageningen Agricultural University, The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Assuming that one wishes to avoid the soil salinity to increase and maintain the soil salinity Cu at a desired level Cd we have: &lt;br&gt;
Ss = 0, Cu = Cd and Cp = Le.Cd. Hence the salt balance can be simplified to:
*Perc.Le.Cd = Irr.Ci + Cap.Cc
Setting the amount percolation water required to fulfill this salt balance equal to Lr (the ''leaching requirement'')
it is found that:
*Lr = (Irr.Ci + Cap.Cc) / Le.Cd .
Substituting herein Irr = Evap + Perc &amp;minus; Rain &amp;minus; Cap and re-arranging gives :
*Lr = [ (Evap&amp;minus;Rain).Ci + Cap(Cc&amp;minus;Ci) ] / (Le.Cd &amp;minus; Ci) &lt;ref name="Hoorn" /&gt;
With this the irrigation and drainage requirements for salinity control can be computed too.&lt;br&gt;
In irrigation projects in [[arid|(semi)arid zones]] and [[semi arid|climates]] it is important to check the leaching requirement, whereby the ''field irrigation efficiency'' (indicating the fraction of irrigation water percolating to the underground) is to be taken into account.&lt;br&gt;
The desired soil salinity level Cd depends on the crop tolerance to salt. The [[University of Wyoming]],&lt;ref name="Alan"/&gt; USA, and the [[Government of Alberta]],&lt;ref name= "Albert" /&gt; Canada, report crop tolerance data.

==Strip cropping: an alternative==
[[File:StripCropping.jpg|thumb|250px|Hydrological principles of ''strip cropping'' to control the depth of the water table and the soil salinity]]
In irrigated lands with scarce water resources suffering from drainage (high water table) and soil salinity problems, [[strip cropping]] is sometimes practiced with strips of land where every other strip is irrigated while the strips in between are left permanently [[fallow]].&lt;ref&gt;ILRI, 2000.  ''Irrigation, groundwater, drainage and soil salinity control in the alluvial fan of Garmsar''. Consultancy assignment to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands. On line: [http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/garmsar.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Owing to the water application in the irrigated strips they have a higher [[watertable]] which induces [[Groundwater|flow of groundwater]] to the unirrigated strips. This flow functions as subsurface drainage for the irrigated strips, whereby the water table is maintained at a not-too-shallow depth, [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaching]] of the soil is possible, and the soil salinity can be controlled at an acceptably low level.

In the unirrigated (sacrificial) strips the soil is dry and the groundwater comes up by [[capillary rise]] and evaporates leaving the salts behind, so that here the soil salinizes. Nevertheless, they can have some use for [[livestock]], sowing salinity resistant [[grasses]] or [[weed]]s. Moreover, useful salt resistant trees can be planted like [[Casuarina]], [[Eucalyptus]] or [[Atriplex]], keeping in mind that the trees have deep rooting systems and the salinity of the wet subsoil is less than of the topsoil. In these ways [[wind erosion]] can be controlled. The unirrigated strips can also be used for [[salt]] harvesting.

==Soil salinity models==
{{Expand section|date=October 2007}}
[[File:File-Saltmod8 (2).JPG|thumb|250px|SaltMod components]]
The majority of the computer models available for water and solute transport in the soil (e.g. SWAP,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swap.alterra.nl/ SWAP model]&lt;/ref&gt; DrainMod-S,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bae.ncsu.edu/soil_water/drainmod/models.html DrainMod-S model] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025223837/http://www.bae.ncsu.edu/soil_water/drainmod/models.html |date=2008-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; UnSatChem,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htm?docid=8966 UnSatChem model]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hydrus (software)|Hydrus]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pc-progress.com/en/default.aspx?hydrus-3d Hydrus model]&lt;/ref&gt; ) are based on Richard's [[differential equation]] for the movement of water in unsaturated soil in combination with Fick's differential [[convection–diffusion equation]] for [[advection]] and [[Fick's laws of diffusion|dispersion]] of salts.

The models require input of soil characteristics like the relations between variable unsaturated [[soil moisture]] content, water tension, [[water retention curve]], unsaturated [[hydraulic conductivity]], dispersivity and [[Mass diffusivity|diffusivity]]. These relations vary to a great extent from place to place and from time to time and are not easy to measure. Further, the models are difficult to [[calibration|calibrate]] under farmer's field conditions because the soil salinity here is spatially very variable. The models use short time steps and need at least a daily, if not an hourly, data base of [[hydrology|hydrological]] phenomena. Altogether this makes model application to a fairly large [[project]] the job of a team of specialists with ample facilities.

Simpler models, like [[SaltMod]],&lt;ref name="Snellen" /&gt; based on monthly or seasonal water and soil balances and an empirical capillary rise function, are also available. They are useful for long-term salinity predictions in relation to [[irrigation]] and [[drainage]] practices.

LeachMod,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterlog.info/leachmod.htm LeachMod]&lt;/ref&gt; using the SaltMod principles, helps in analyzing leaching experiments in which the soil salinity was monitored in various root zone layers while the model will optimize the value of the leaching efficiency of each layer so that a fit is obtained of observed with simulated soil salinity values.

Spatial variations owing to variations in [[topography]] can be simulated and predicted using salinity cum [[groundwater model]]s, like [[SahysMod]].

'''''Speaking into the Air: A History of the Idea of Communication,''''' written by American scholar [[John Durham Peters]], is a classic and important work in Commucation area and also the first and most well-known book of John Durham Peters. In this book, the author asserts that communicating like angels is "impossible" but it is not just a tragic fact but also a blessed one. This book talks about the history of communication failure from different aspects like philosophy, politics, media technology and so forth. This book won the [[National Communication Association]] Award in 2000.

== Themes ==
''Speaking into the Air: A history of the Idea of Communication'' studies on Communication failure. It contains five phrases of history of the idea of Communication, Plaeo's eros, The Bible's one-way dissemination, Religious Angle communication in Middle Ages, Spiritual communication in modern philosophy, and the communication idea in modern communication theory. It also involves the subject machines, animals and aliens as horizons of incommunicability.

== Book review ==
At the end of the Introduction "he Problem of Communication", Peters asserts that "dissemination" can be more charming：

"The most beautiful thing about our contact with each other is its free dissemination, not its anguished communion. The ultimate futility of our attempts to "communicate" is not lamentable; it is a handsome condition. The notion of communication deserves to be liberated from its earnestness and spiritualism, its demand for precision and agreement, demands whose long history I attempt to illustrate in this book. The requirement of interpersonal mimesis can be despotic...The idea of communication, as Adorno said, would be a condition in which the only thing that survives the disgraceful fact of our mutual difference is the delight that the difference makes possible."

And then in the first chapter "Dialogue and Dissemination", Peters compares two forms of communication: dialogue and dissemination and makes an argument that “dialogue can be tyrannical and dissemination can be just”, which provides an interesting perspective of one-way communication: dissemination. And my study about dissemination of Chinese literature is based on the pressing industries, is all about book. Compared to radio, television, internet, books like newspaper, magazines and other pressing productions can be more like the media of one-way communication, since we can easily make instant interactions through radio, television, internet but as for books, due to the lack of interaction, the audiences may have more time and freedom to interpret meanings by themselves.

To illustrate, we may use the theory of Encoding and Decoding by Stuart Hall, as shown right:
[[File:Encoding-decoding.gif|thumb]]
A programme can be encoded and decoded separately by different groups of people. In a dialogue or any other means of interaction, encoding and decoding can happen in turn or together frequently within a certain time between the two sides. And because of such strong interaction in it, say, the two sides have hugely different frameworks of knowledge, and then what will happen? Probably, they start to fight against each other... more emotion and non-rationality are filled in. Say, the two sides are more polite and open to the other’s opinions and maybe they have to force themselves to adjust their framework of knowledge and achieve a consistent but not perfectly accepted point at the end. As Peters said, dialogue can be tyrannical. More conflicts and disgraceful compromise may happen in a dialogue. Of course, in a one-way dissemination, say the dissemination of Chinese Contemporary literature books overseas, the process of encoding of Chinese writers is complete without too much distraction from the audiences overseas. The writers can fill their knowledge, feelings and thoughts in their books. And through the dissemination overseas, audiences in the far access the productions and decode the meanings by themselves with less distraction. Of course, the audiences could write book reviews or make direct connections to the authors, and at the same time, the authors could hold book launches or make a speech to make connections with the authors. But this kind of interaction afterwards can’t compete with the counterpart in instant dialogues in a phone call and chats in the social media, where encoding and decoding happen together at the same time. This kind of inspires me to reconsider the beauty of "dissemination"----one-way communication. But we should also realize that either in a dialogue or the dissemination, the failure always exists. Regardless of the tragedy, what we should also keep in mind is that “ the idea of communication, as Adorno said, would be a condition in which the only thing that survives the disgraceful fact of our mutual difference is the delight that the difference makes possible.”

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7166">A '''story arc''' (also '''narrative arc''')&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-narrative-arc-in-literature-852484 "Narrative Arc – What is Narrative Arc in Literature?"]. ThoughtCo.&lt;/ref&gt; is an extended or continuing [[narrative|storyline]] in [[episode|episodic]] storytelling media such as [[television]], [[comic book]]s, [[comic strip]]s, [[boardgames]], [[video game]]s, and [[films]] with each episode following a [[dramatic arc]]. On a [[television program]], for example, the story would unfold over many episodes. In television, the use of the story arc is much more common in [[comedy|comedies]], especially in [[soap opera]]s. In a traditional Hollywood film, the story arc usually follows a three-act format.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, Lew, "Lew Hunter's Screenwriting 434: The Industry's Premier Teacher Reveals the Secrets of the Successful Screenplay", Peregee Books, a division of Penguin, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[Webcomic]]s are more likely to use story arcs than [[comic strip|newspaper comics]], as most web comics have readable archives online that a newcomer to the strip can read in order to understand what is going on. Although story arcs have existed for decades, the term "story arc" was coined in 1988 in relation to the television series ''[[Wiseguy]]'',{{clarification needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Boulware, Hugh (September 18, 1988). [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-09-18/entertainment/8802010198_1_wiseguy-ken-wahl-sonny-steelgrave "Hollywood Not Ken Wahl's Kind Of Town"]. ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and was quickly adapted for other uses.

Many American comic book series are now written in four or six-issue arcs, within a continuing series. Short story arcs are easier to package as [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]]s for resale, and more accessible to the casual reader than the never-ending [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] that once characterised US comics.
A corollary to the absence of continuity, however, is that, as exemplified in 1950s DC ''Superman'' comics, no permanent change to characters or situations occurs, meaning no growth can take place; thus storylines repeat over time in an endless loop.

==Dramatic structure and purpose==
The purpose of a story arc is to move a character or a situation from one state to another; in other words, to [[Peripeteia|effect change]]. This change or transformation often takes the form of either a [[tragedy|tragic]] fall from grace or a reversal of that pattern. One common form in which this reversal is found is a character going from a situation of weakness to one of strength. For example, a poor woman goes on adventures and in the end makes a fortune for herself, or a lonely man falls in love and marries.

Another form of storytelling that offers a change or transformation of [[Character arc|character]] is that of "hero's journey," as laid out in [[Joseph Campbell]]'s theory of the [[monomyth]] in his work, ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]''. [[Christopher Vogler]]'s ''[[The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers]]'' details the same theory specifically for western storytelling.

Story arcs in contemporary drama often follow the pattern of bringing a character to a low point, removing the structures the character depends upon, and then forcing the character to find new strength without those structures. In a story arc, the character undergoes substantial growth or change, which culminates in the [[denouement]] in the last third or quarter of a story.

==In television and radio==
{{See also|Serial (radio and television)}}
Story arcs on television (and also on radio) have existed for decades (one notable (albeit, unusual) example, from the so-called "Golden Age of Radio", being the 1946 [[NBC Red Network|NBC Radio]] Summer-run docudrama serial, ''The Fifth Horseman'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/The_Fifth_Horseman|title=The Fifth Horseman|publisher=|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; which (in part) featured a four-episode arc regarding a hypothetical chain of events (spanning nearly two full "future" decades) surrounding a fictitious [[nuclear holocaust]]), and are common in many countries where multi-episode storylines are the norm (an example being the UK's ''[[Doctor Who]]''), as well as most [[anime]] series.

Many arc-based series in past decades, such as ''[[V (1984 TV series)|V]]'', were often short-lived and found it difficult to attract new viewers; they also rarely appear in traditional [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] (one notable example being the science fiction "novel for television" ''[[Babylon 5]]''). However, the rise of [[DVD]] retail and [[Digital video recorder|DVR]] of television series has worked in arc-based productions' favor as the standard season collection format allows the viewer to have easy access to the relevant episodes. One area of television where story arcs have always thrived, however, is in the realm of the soap opera, and often episodic series have been derisively referred to as "soap operas" when they have adopted story arcs.

Arc-based series draw and reward dedicated viewers, and fans of a particular show follow and discuss different story arcs independently from particular episodes. Story arcs are sometimes split into subarcs, if deemed significant by fans, making it easy to refer to certain episodes if their production order titles are unknown. Episodes not relevant to story arcs (such as "monsters of the week") are sometimes dismissed as [[filler (media)|filler]] by fans, but might be referred to as self-contained or stand-alone episodes by producers.

===Usage in manga and anime===
[[Manga]] and anime are usually good examples of arc-based stories, to the point that most series shorter than twenty-six chapters are a single arc spanning all the chapters. This makes syndication difficult, as episodes watched in isolation often confuse viewers unless watched in conjunction with the series as a whole. Series of thirty chapters or longer usually have multiple arcs.

''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion (TV)|Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'', for example, is a single story arc spanning twenty-six episodes. Other longer anime have multiple story arcs, such as ''[[Bleach (manga)|Bleach]]'', ''[[Higurashi When They Cry|Higurashi no Naku Koro ni]]'', ''[[One Piece]]'', ''[[Naruto]]'', ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' and ''[[Fairy Tail]]''. The anime ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' adapts four different story arcs from the ''Dragon Ball'' manga, each with its own ultimate antagonist, along with original story arcs created for the TV series.

'''Technological momentum''' is a theory about the relationship between [[technology]] and [[society]] over time. The term, which is considered a fourth technological determinism variant,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Philosophy of Technology: From Technical Artefacts to Sociotechnical Systems|last=Vermaas|first=Peter|last2=Kroes|first2=Peter|last3=Franssen|first3=Maarten|last4=van de Poel|first4=Ibo|last5=Houkes|first5=Wybo|publisher=Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers|year=2011|isbn=9781608455980|location=San Rafael, CA|pages=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; was originally developed by the [[history of technology|historian of technology]] [[Thomas P. Hughes]]. The idea is that relationship between technology and society is reciprocal and time-dependent so that one does not determine the changes in the other but both influence each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Green Technology: An A-to-Z Guide|last=Mulvaney|first=Dustin|last2=Robbins|first2=Paul|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2011|isbn=9781412996921|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
Hughes's thesis is a synthesis of two separate models for how technology and society interact. One, ''[[technological determinism]]'', claims that society itself is modified by the introduction of a new technology in an irreversible and irreparable way&amp;mdash;for example, the introduction of the [[automobile]] has influenced the manner in which [[United States of America|American]] cities are designed, a change that can clearly be seen when comparing the pre-automobile cities on the East Coast to the post-automobile cities on the West Coast. Technology, under this model, self-propagates as well&amp;mdash;there is no turning back once the adoption has taken place, and the very existence of the technology means that it will continue to exist in the future.

The other model, ''[[social determinism]]'', claims that society itself controls how a technology is used and developed&amp;mdash;for example, the rejection of [[nuclear power]] technology in the USA amid the public fears after the [[Three Mile Island]] incident.

''Technological momentum'' takes the two models and adds ''time'' as the unifying factor. In Hughes's theory, when a technology is young, deliberate control over its use and scope is possible and enacted by society. However, as a technology matures, and becomes increasingly enmeshed in the society where it was created, its own deterministic force takes hold, achieving technological momentum in the process. According to Hughes this inertia, which is particularly the case for large technological systems with their technological and social components, makes them difficult to influence and steer as they start to go more on their own way, assuming deterministic traits in the process.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In other words, Hughes's says that the relationship between technology and society always starts with a ''social determinism'' model, but evolves into a form of ''technological determinism'' over time and as its use becomes more prevalent and important.

Since its introduction by Hughes, the ''technological momentum'' concept has been applied by a number of other historians of technology.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Consuming Power: A Social History of American Energies'' (1998) by [[David E. Nye]]; "Technology and War: A Bibliographic Essay" by Alex Roland in ''Military Enterprise and Technological Change'' (1985), edited by Merritt Roe Smith; and ''Nuclear Fallacies: How We Have Been Misguided since Hiroshima'' (1985) by Robert W. Malcomson.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, it is considered an effective approach to reconciling the apparently opposite perspectives of the autonomy of technology and the social and political motivations behind technological choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Democratizing Technology: Andrew Feenberg's Critical Theory of Technology|last=Borgmann|first=Albert|last2=Cooper|first2=Simon|last3=Doppelt|first3=Gerlad|last4=Feenberg|first4=Andrew|last5=Glazebrook|first5=Trish|last6=Hickman|first6=Larry|last7=Light|first7=Andrew|last8=Stump|first8=David|last9=Thompson|first9=Paul|publisher=SUNY Press|year=2006|isbn=9780791469170|location=New York|pages=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is able to describe how socially and politically conditioned technological institutions become independent and autonomous over time.

'''William Ernest Stephen Turner''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OBE|FRS}} (22 September 1881 – 27 October 1963) was a British chemist and pioneer of scientific glass technology.&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] accessed 15 July 200&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Turner was born in [[Wednesbury]], [[Staffordshire]] on 22 September 1881. He went to [[King Edward VI Five Ways|King Edward VI Grammar School]], Five Ways, [[Birmingham]], and achieved a BSc (1902) and MSc (1904) in chemistry at the [[University of Birmingham]].&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt;

He married Mary Isobell Marshall (died 1939) and they had 4 children.&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt;

In 1904, he joined the [[University of Sheffield|University College of Sheffield]] as a lecturer, and, in 1915, established the Department of Glass Manufacture, becoming in 1916 the Department of Glass Technology. He remained as its head until his retirement in 1945.&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt;

In 1943, he married Helen Nairn Munro, an artist noted for her glass engraving, and a teacher of glass decoration at the [[Edinburgh College of Art]].&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt; She was provided with a blue dress and shoes in glass fibre cloth (which was then an unusual industrial material). This has been selected as one of the items in the [[BBC]]'s [[A History of the World in 100 Objects]].&lt;ref name=bbc100&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/NolQSkbeRc-6HNQvhF1J_A  BBC A History of the World] Glass Fibre Wedding Dress&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, he established a collection of historical and modern glass which became the [[Turner Museum of Glass]] from his extensive collection, and the wedding dress is on display there.&lt;ref name=bbc100/&gt;&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[http://www.turnermuseum.group.shef.ac.uk/biography.html Turner Museum Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

He died on 27 October 1963.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

==Work==

===Publications===
From 1904 to 1914, he published 21 papers on physical chemistry, mainly on [[molecular weight]]s in solution. However, the bulk of his work from 1917 to 1954 was on the chemistry and technology of glass. Following his retirement, he produced an extensive series on the history of glass technology and on glass in [[archeology]]. Apart from this, in 1909, he wrote a series of articles in the [[Sheffield Daily Telegraph]] about the scientist in industry, in which cooperation with universities was urged.&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt;

===Research===
His early career was strictly academic, largely dealing with the associations of molecules in the liquid state. However, as his articles in the local newspaper showed, he was interested in the application of science to practical industrial problems, and this became the main theme of his work. The beginning of the [[First World War]] cut off [[metallurgy|metallurgical]] supplies from [[Germany]] and [[Austria]], and Turner proposed that the University should help British industry. The work in metallurgy led to enquiries about glass, and in 1915 Turner produced a 'Report on the glass industry of Yorkshire', noting that this was largely unscientific and [[rule of thumb]] in nature. He thereby persuaded the University to set up a Department of Glass Manufacture in 1915 for research and teaching where he remained for the rest of his career, becoming internationally known. The main thrust of his research was on a fundamental understanding of the relationship between the chemical composition and the working properties of glasses.&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt;

In 1916, he founded the [[Society of Glass Technology]], becoming its first secretary. It published a Journal, which he edited until 1951. He was also involved in the formation of the [[International Commission on Glass]].&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

===Teaching===
Turner initially taught physical chemistry, and in 1905 started specific courses for metallurgists. This involvement led him to become President of the Sheffield Society of Applied Metallurgy in 1914. In 1915, the Department of Glass Manufacture began an outreach programme, providing short courses to industry in [[Mexborough]], [[Barnsley]], [[Castleford]] and [[Knottingley]] in addition to Saturday classes in Sheffield. These were extended to glass making centres in [[Derby]], [[Alloa]], [[Glasgow]] and [[London]]. From 1917, full-time day students entered for what became a Bachelor of Technical Science degree. During the [[Second World War]], Turner and other staff of the department provided technical lectures to industries such as those making glass electronic [[vacuum tubes]].&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt;

==Honours==
He was appointed an Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]] in the [[1919 New Year Honours]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=31114 |supp=y |page=460|date= 8 January 1919}}&lt;/ref&gt; for application of science to the glass industry, and in 1938 was appointed a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]]. He was the only person outside Germany to receive the [[Otto Schott]] Medal.&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt;

'''Workplace communication''' is the process of exchanging information and ideas, both verbal and non-verbal, within an organization. An organization may consist of employees from different parts of the society. These may have different cultures and backgrounds, and can be used to different norms. To unite activities of all employees and restrain from any missed deadline or activity that could affect the company negatively, [[communication]] is crucial. Effective workplace communication ensures that all the organizational objectives are achieved. Workplace communication is tremendously important to organizations because it increases productivity and efficiency. Ineffective workplace communication leads to communication gaps between employees, which causes confusion, wastes time, and reduces productivity. Misunderstandings that cause friction between people can be avoided by effective workplace communication.Effective communication, also called open communication, prevents barriers from forming among individuals within companies that might impede progress in striving to reach a common goal. For businesses to function as desired, managers and lower-level employees must be able to interact clearly and effectively with each other through verbal communication and non-verbal communication to achieve specific business goals. Effective communication with clients plays a vital role in development of an organization and success of any business. When communicating, [[nonverbal communication]] must also be taken into consideration. How a person delivers a message has a lot of influence on the meaning of this one. 

Another important aspect to have effective workplace communication is taking into consideration the different backgrounds of employees. "While diversity enriches the environment, it can also cause communication barriers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guo|first1=Kristina L.|last2=Sanchez|first2=Yesenia|last3=Borkowski|first3=Nancy|title=Organizational Behavior in Workplace|date=Dec 23, 2009|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; Difficulties arise when a coworker’s cultural background leads him or her to think differently than another. It is for this reason that knowing about [[intercultural communication]] at work and learning how to treat others without offending them can bring several benefits to the company.

==Method of communication==

Different people absorb information in different ways. To make sure that the information conveyed is understood by all, the method used for communication must be simple, clear, and precise. When presenting vital information, using pictures will make way for easy understanding. The presence of trust inside a corporation will also simplify the use of communication. Relationships must be established between coworkers to create a tension-free workplace. Messages should be sent and received with no alterations. To achieve healthy relationships in the workplace, behaviors such as bullying, taking credit for someone else's work and [[Free rider problem|free riding]] should be avoided. These will create toxic relationships that will, in the long run, impact negatively a company and the productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeIuliis|first1=David, PhD.|title="Workplace Communication"|journal=Communication Research Trends.|date=2016|volume=35|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preferring [[two-way communication]] is considered best for communicating. Adequate importance can be given for discussion, questions and clarifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Henson|first=Baden|title=Communication in the workplace|year=2007|publisher=Wiley|location=Milton, Old|ISBN=0-7314-0650-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

The content of the information plays a major role in workplace communication. The level of detail must be according to the grasping capacity of the audience. Giving too much detail may get the audience bored and too little detail won’t make them involved. Use of [[jargon]] while communicating is not considered good for effective workplace communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sudden|first=Marsha|title=Effective workplace communication : skills for success in life and on the job|year=2007|publisher=JUST Works|location=Indianapolis, Ind.|ISBN=1-59357-433-9|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frequency==

While formal workplace communication that is done too rarely or too often is not good for an organization, frequent informal workplace communication has its benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whitaker|first=Steve |author2=David Frolic |author3=Owen Day-Jones|title=Informal workplace communication: what is it like and how might we support it?|journal=CHI '94 Proceedings of the SIGHS conference on Human factors in computing systems: celebrating interdependence|date=April 24–28, 1994|pages=131–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A perfect balance is required for the proper functioning of an organization. Information must be communicated as and when required rather than holding unnecessary meetings frequently. At the same time crucial information must not be held till the last hour or day, instead they must be communicated early to engage employees in the objectives of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Picardi|first=Richard P.|title=Skills of workplace communication : a handbook for T &amp; D specialists and their organizations|year=2001|publisher=Quorum Books|location=West port, Conn.|ISBN=978-1-56720-362-2|edition=[Online-Gauss.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skills==

Getting the message across efficiently depends on the skills of the communicator such as presentation skills, group facilitation skills, negotiation and written communication skills. Successful communication also depends upon the capacity of the employees to understand the information. This requires providing the employees some basic financial literacy like financial statements, sales, profitability, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Person|first=Sharon J. Person, Steven M.|title=Workplace communication : process and product|year=2007|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|ISBN=0-13-228808-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When selecting a candidate, most employers seek for those who have strong speaking and writing skills. Problem solving and self- motivation are also highly necessary skills among the workplace. These allow rapidly changing environments to become less of a challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stevens|first1=B|title=What communication skills do employers want? Silicon Valley Recruiters Respond|journal=Journal of employment counseling|date=March 2005|volume=42|issue=1|pages=2-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tools==

With the fast evolution of technology, companies have to stay up to date with communication tools that facilitate the workplace communication. Some of these include email, blogs, instant messaging and even social media sites such as [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]]. It is important to keep in mind that sending an email, a fax or a letter does not necessarily mean that communication has taken place. Only when a message has been sent, received and understood by the intended receiver, it can be said that communication has occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guo|first1=Kristina L.|last2=Sanchez|first2=Yesenia|last3=Borkowski|first3=Nancy|title=Organizational Behavior in Workplace|date=Dec 23, 2009|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though they facilitate communication, studies have shown that communication tools may distract employees from their duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=T|last2=Dawson|first2=R|last3=Wilson|first3=D|title=Reducing the effect of email interruption on employees|journal=International Journal of Information Management|date=2003|volume=21|issue=1|page=55-65}}&lt;/ref&gt; To reduce the interrupt effect, methods such as employee training and changing of environment can be implemented. Employees making themselves unavailable during specific times of the day or week can also help resolve this issue. This will increase concentration and as a result, productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Conaill|first1=Brid|last2=Frohlich|first2=David|title=Timespace in the workplace: dealing with interruptions|journal=Conference Companion on Human Factors in Computing Systems|date=1995|volume=CHI 95|pages=262-263|doi=10.1145/223355.223665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The solution to have effective communication in a workplace can be achieved by having a central portal where everybody can access all the relevant information, communications, documents, and contracts in one place. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ramadas|first1=Nidhin|title=Effective tools for workplace communication|url=https://axerosolutions.com/blogs/timeisenhauer/pulse/283/5-foolproof-business-communication-tools-every-company-should-be-using|website=axerosolutions|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Barriers==

Common barriers to effective communication at workplace:

Physical barriers: Physical structure, location and construction of the workplace acts as a barrier to effective communication. Employees seated remotely from each other hinders effective interaction. 

Language barriers: Employees with different native languages will be working in an organization. As everyone in organization are not comfortable with native language of the other person, language acts as a barrier for effective workplace communication. 

Cultural barriers: Employees from different cultures, following different practices will be working in an organization. This cultural diversity among the employees can act as barrier for effective communication at workplace. 

Emotional barriers: Emotional barriers like fear, inferiority, shyness, lack of self confidence and skills will stop an employee in communicating effectively with his colleagues.

Perception barriers: Employees will have different experiences, values, preferences and attitudes.These may lead to a variety of assumptions and can act as a communication barrier.
