{{classic element}}

'''Akasha''' ([[Sanskrit]] ''{{IAST|ākāśa}}'' {{lang|sa|आकाश}}) is a term for either [[space]] or [[Aether (classical element)|æther]] in traditional Indian cosmology, depending on the religion. The term has also been adopted in Western [[Occult|occultism]] and spiritualism in the late 19th century. In [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] it means "sky". In many modern [[Indo-Aryan languages]] and [[Dravidian languages]] the corresponding word (often rendered ''Akash'') retains a generic meaning of "sky".&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of World Philosophy'' by A. Pablo Iannone, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;30. {{ISBN|0-415-17995-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian cosmology==
The word in [[Sanskrit]] is derived from a root ''kāś'' meaning "to be visible". It appears as a masculine noun in [[Vedic Sanskrit]] with a generic meaning of "open space, vacuity". In Classical Sanskrit, the noun acquires the neuter gender and may express the concept of "sky; atmosphere" ([[Manusmrti]], [[Shatapathabrahmana]]).
In [[Vedanta|Vedantic]] philosophy, the word acquires its technical meaning of "an ethereal fluid imagined as pervading the cosmos".

===Hinduism===
In [[Vedantic Hinduism]], Akasha means the basis and essence of all things in the material world; the first element created.  A Vedic mantra “pṛthivyāpastejovāyurākāśāt” indicates the sequence of initial appearance of the five basic gross elements. Thus, first appeared the space, from which appeared air, from that fire or energy, from which the water, and therefrom the earth. It is one of the ''[[Classical element#Classical elements in Hinduism|Panchamahabhuta]],'' or "five gross elements"; its main characteristic is ''[[Shabda]]'' (sound). The direct translation of Akasha is the word meaning "upper sky" or 'space' in Hinduism.

The [[Nyaya]] and [[Vaisheshika]] schools of Hindu philosophy state that Akasha or aether is the fifth physical substance, which is the substratum of the quality of sound.  It is the ''One'', ''Eternal'', and ''All Pervading'' physical substance, which is imperceptible.&lt;ref&gt;''Indian Metaphysics and Epistemology'' by Karl H. Potter, Usharbudh Arya, Motilal Banarsidass Publications, 1977, p.&amp;nbsp;71. {{ISBN|81-208-0309-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Samkhya]] school, Akasha is one of the five [[Mahābhūta]]s (grand physical elements) having the specific property of sound.&lt;ref&gt;''Six Systems of Indian Philosophy; Samkhya and Yoga; Naya and Vaiseshika'' by F. Max Muller, Kessinger Publishing, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;40. {{ISBN|0-7661-4296-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adherents of the heterodox [[Cārvāka]] or Lokāyata philosophy held that this world is made of four elements only. They exclude the fifth, Akasha, because its existence cannot be perceived.&lt;ref&gt;''The Tale of Carvaka'' by Manga Randreas, Mangalakshmi Ravindram, iUniverse, 2005, {{ISBN|0-595-34955-2}}, pg, 270&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jainism===
{{Main|Ākāśa (Jainism)}}
Akasha is space in the [[Jainism|Jain]] conception of the cosmos. Akasha is one of the six ''dravyas'' (substances) and it  accommodates the other five, namely sentient beings or souls (''[[Jīva (Jainism)|jīva]]''), non-sentient substance or matter (''[[pudgala]]''), principle of motion (''[[Dharma (Jainism)|dharma]]''), the principle of rest (''[[adharma]]'') and time (''[[kāla (time)|kāla]]'')

It is all-pervading, infinite and made of infinite space-points.&lt;ref&gt;Acarya Nemicandra; Nalini Balbir (2010) p.11–12&lt;/ref&gt;

It falls into the ''[[Ajiva]]'' category, divided into two parts:  ''Loakasa'' (the part occupied by the material world) and ''Aloakasa'' (the space beyond it which is absolutely void and empty). In ''Loakasa'' the universe forms only a part. Akasha is that which gives space and makes room for the existence of all extended substances.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia of Jainism'' by Narendra Singh, Anmol Publications PVT. LTD., 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;1623. {{ISBN|81-261-0691-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the summit of the ''lokākāśa'' is the ''[[Siddhashila]]'' (abode of the liberated souls).&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, C. (1997). ''A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy'', Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0365-5}}, p.64&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
In [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] Akasha is divided into limited space (ākāsa-dhātu) and endless space (ajatākasā).&lt;ref&gt;''Buddhist Dictionary'' by Nyanatiloka, Buddhist Publication Society, 1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;24-35. {{ISBN|955-24-0019-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vaibhashika]], an early school of Buddhist philosophy, hold Akasha's existence to be real.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Asian Philosophy'' By Oliver Leaman, Contributor Oliver Leaman, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2001, {{ISBN|0-415-17281-0}}, pg. 476&lt;/ref&gt;

Ākāsa is identified as the first [[arūpajhāna|arūpa jhāna]], but usually translates as "infinite space."&lt;ref&gt;''The Ideas and Meditative Practices of Early Buddhism'' By Tilmann Vetter, Brill: Leiden, 1988.  pg. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern reception==
{{see|Akashic records}}
The Western mystic-religious philosophy called [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|Theosophy]] has popularized the word Akasha as an adjective, through the use of the term "Akashic records" or "Akashic library", referring to an etheric compendium of all knowledge and history.

[[Scott Cunningham]] (1995) uses the term Akasha to refer to "the spiritual force that Earth, Air, Fire, and Water descend from".&lt;ref&gt;''Earth, Air, Fire &amp; Water'', Scott Cunningham (Llewellyn, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ervin László]] in ''Science and the Akashic Field: An Integral Theory of Everything'' (2004), based on ideas by [[Rudolf Steiner]], posits "a field of information" as the substance of the cosmos, which he calls  "Akashic field" or "A-field".&lt;ref&gt;[http://integral-review.org/documents/Gidley,%20Evolution%20of%20Consciousness%20as%20Planetary%20Imperative%205,%202007.pdf Gidley, J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27538">'''Alliance Quebec''' (AQ) was a group formed in 1982 to [[Lobbying|lobby]] on behalf of [[English-speaking Quebecers]] in the province of [[Quebec]], Canada. It began as an [[umbrella group]] of many English-speaking organizations and institutions in the province, with approximately 15,000 members.  At its height in the mid-1980s, the group had a network of affiliated anglophone groups throughout the province.  However, a prolonged decline in influence, group cohesion, membership and funding ultimately led to its closure in 2005.

== Early years — constructive engagement: 1982–1989 ==

The [[Parti Québécois]] (PQ), a party that supports the sovereignty of Quebec and the dominant use of [[French language|French]] in most areas of public and business life, won a majority in the [[Quebec National Assembly]] (the province's legislature) in 1976.  The vast majority of Quebec anglophones (i.e., Quebecers who speak English as a first language), who at that time made up approximately 13% of Quebec's population (see [[Language demographics of Quebec]]), did not support this party.&lt;ref name="books.google.ca"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8BtwoGqOAQoC&amp;pg=PA20 |title=Garth Stevenson, '&amp;#39;Community Besieged'&amp;#39;, p.135 |via=[[Google Books]]|date= |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some anglophones formed local lobby groups to promote [[federalism]] and argue against new laws such as the [[Charter of the French Language]] (also known as "Bill 101").  After the Parti Québécois was re-elected in 1981, several of these groups (notably the "Positive Action Committee" and the "Council of Quebec Minorities") joined together in May 1982,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ymUxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8KQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=alliance%20quebec%20convention&amp;pg=1240%2C1642793 |title=Montreal Gazette (February 27, 1982, p.A5) |publisher=News.google.com |date=1982-02-27 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; as "The Alliance of Language Communities in Quebec" (or "Alliance Québec") in an effort to gain more influence and to start a province-level dialogue between linguistic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1CwhnBqgSpwC&amp;pg=PA124 |title=See Marc Levine, '&amp;#39;The Reconquest of Montreal,'&amp;#39; p.124 |via=[[Google Books]]|date=1982-11-05 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AQ's ideology reflected a desire to promote the rights and interests of the English language community while recognizing there were legitimate goals being pursued by the provincial government in promoting the French language, such promotion having strong support in the majority Francophone population. Alliance Quebec's best-known accomplishments from its earliest years included:

* Alliance Quebec's first success was to lobby  the PQ to amend Bill 101. In 1983, the Charter of the French Language was amended (Law 57) to recognize in its preamble to the Charter of the French Language the institutions of the Anglophone community in Québec, abolish language testing for people educated in Quebec, and to widen the use of English in Anglophone communities and public institutions.
* Alliance Quebec also worked to get English language health and social service guarantees. As a result, in 1986, Law 142 was enacted which compels regional authorities to draw up programmes for access in the English language to health and social services throughout Quebec.
* With the financial support and legal leadership of Alliance Quebec, Bill 101's prohibition of English language signs was challenged in court. In 1988, in its decision [[Ford v. Quebec (Attorney General)]], the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] concluded that the prohibition of all other languages but French on public signs and posters and in commercial advertising was in opposition to the freedom of expression but opened the door to the clear predominance of French.  This solution was ultimately adopted by the Government of Quebec and prevails to this day.

The group had widespread grassroots volunteer activity in its early years.  It formed at least 20 regional chapters, including 8 in the anglophone neighbourhoods of Montreal.  The federal government subsidized AQ in an effort to promote minority official language groups in the province, providing it with most of AQ's budget ($1.4 million in 1986).&lt;ref name="news.google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=booxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UagFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=alliance-quebec&amp;pg=5735%2C5704854 |title=Montreal Gazette (May 31, 1986, p.B-5) |publisher=News.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar funding was provided to French language groups outside Quebec.

In addition to AQ's regional chapters, six federally funded anglophone groups outside of Montreal became affiliated with AQ and sent delegates to its annual convention. Affiliated Quebec anglophone universities, [[CEGEP]]s and health and social service institution and community associations were also allowed to send delegates. Institutional members brought AQ substantial public policy expertise and participated in the policy formulation process.

By the end of the 1980s, AQ claimed to have 40,000 people on its membership list&lt;ref name="news.google.com"/&gt; (including members of regional associations affiliated with AQ, such as the [[Townshippers' Association]]). This led to critiques that people who did not renew their memberships were not removed from this list and that the actual number of dues-paying members hovered around 5,000.&lt;ref&gt;Graeme Decarie, CJAD 800 radio (August 1989); see also [http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk2/ftp04/mq24370.pdf Prosperi] at p.59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Alliance Quebec's founders were active in the [[Liberal Party of Quebec]], the main opposition party while the PQ was in government. The Liberal Party of Quebec won the [[Quebec general election, 1985|provincial election of 1985]], and many of AQ's initial leaders were recruited to work for the new government.  Several of AQ's highly educated and bilingual early staff members went on to become Liberal cabinet ministers in later years, such as [[Thomas Mulcair]], [[Kathleen Weil]], and Geoffrey Kelley (Jacques-Cartier), while others served as [[Quebec National Assembly|MNAs]]—Russell Williams ([[Nelligan (electoral district)|Nelligan]]), [[Russell Copeman]] ([[Notre-Dame-de-Grâce (provincial electoral district)|NDG]]).   While this initially gave AQ strong lobbying contacts within the government, the departure of many of the group's founding leaders eventually hurt the group.  Some have argued that the 1985 election was the beginning of a decline in influence of Alliance Quebec, as English-speakers believed the new government was friendlier and so the need for AQ was lower, while the Liberals had more connections with English-speakers than the PQ and so relied less on AQ to transmit their points of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8BtwoGqOAQoC&amp;pg=PA201 |title=Garth Stevenson,'&amp;#39;Community Besieged,'&amp;#39; p.201 |via=[[Google Books]]|date= |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The group also faced criticism, almost since its founding, that it was not aggressive enough in its demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6WUxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SaUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1316,1089228&amp;dq=alliance-quebec&amp;hl=en |title="Alliance Quebec report card: full marks for effort", '&amp;#39;Montreal Gazette'&amp;#39; (June 4, 1983) |publisher=News.google.ca |date=1983-06-04 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1988, AQ's offices were destroyed in a case of [[arson]].  Then-president [[Royal Orr]] sued ''[[Le Journal de Montréal]]'' and [[CFTM-DT|Télé-Métropole]], for falsely reporting that he was the "prime suspect" in setting the blaze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=805&amp;dat=19890823&amp;id=b4oNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JEkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1230,3792772 |title=Candidate faces tough job|work=Stanstead Journal|date=August 23, 1989 |accessdate=August 18, 2017|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8BtwoGqOAQoC&amp;pg=PA203 |author=Garth Stevenson|title=Community Besieged: The Anglophone Minority and the Politics of Quebec |via=[[Google Books]]|publisher=[[McGill-Queen's University Press]]|date=1999|accessdate=August 18, 2017|page=203|ISBN=9780773518391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Middle years — stagnation and infighting: 1989–1998 ==

AQ's weakened bargaining position was brought to prominence in 1989 when the Liberal government passed Bill 178.  Although the Liberal Party had campaigned in 1985 to loosen the legal restrictions on languages other than French, Bill 178 overturned the Supreme Court's "Ford" decision (see above), restoring the prohibition on non-French commercial signage (with an exception for small signs inside stores).   Alliance Quebec's inability to prevent the adoption of Bill 178 by the Liberal government it had perceived as an ally, opened it to criticism from the anglophone community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8BtwoGqOAQoC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;lpg=PA203&amp;dq=%22Alliance+Quebec%22+arson&amp;source=web&amp;ots=R-Ui5LRwTS&amp;sig=eHv98zMAPejzb_XY5fktlZBhFLs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result |title=Garth Stevenson, '&amp;#39;Community Besieged'&amp;#39;, p.204 |via=[[Google Books]]|date= |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Right-wing critics of AQ dubbed it "Compliance Quebec" and "the lamb lobby" for its perceived unwillingness to challenge the government.&lt;ref&gt;Mordecai Richler, Oh Canada, Oh Quebec: Requiem for a Divided Country (Toronto:
Penguin Books, 1992), 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Internal tension arose among the directors of AQ over the issue of denied access to English language schools in the province. Tensions increased over whether or not to support the Liberals in the [[Quebec general election, 1989|Quebec general election of 1989]] in spite of Bill 178.  Some prominent AQ leaders urged a protest vote by anglophones, either by spoiling their ballots or voting for the upstart [[Equality Party (Quebec)|Equality Party]] that opposed the Liberals' legislation. The Equality Party won four seats in the [[National Assembly of Quebec|National Assembly]] in 1989, but quickly lost its support due to infighting, garnering only 0.3% of the [[Quebec general election, 1994#Results|vote in 1994]].  Rebuffed at the ballot box, some of the Equality Party's remaining active members instead concentrated on winning elected positions in Alliance Quebec&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montrealmirror.com/ARCHIVES/1998/040998/cover.html |title=Philip Preville, "Million Dollar Bill", Montreal Mirror (April 9, 1998) |publisher=Montrealmirror.com |date=1998-04-09 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to have AQ promote the Equality Party's platform (notably, favouring a complete repeal of all mandatory use of French in Quebec, and partitioning Quebec in the event of independence). Public infighting between so-called "moderates" (sympathetic to the Liberal Party) and "radicals" (the remaining members of the Equality Party) within AQ throughout the 1990s, along with a gradual decrease in interest among the general Quebec population in [[language politics]], led to the marginalization of AQ in the province's politics.

While infighting preoccupied the board of directors and annual convention, the grassroots elements of AQ became less active. Government funding allowed for a permanent staff for the group, which relied less and less on volunteers. AQ's smallest regional chapters, in Quebec's [[Magdalen Islands]], [[Basse-Côte-Nord|Lower North Shore]] and [[Baie-Comeau]], closed down for lack of members,&lt;ref&gt;Two members of these closed chapters could attend the annual convention: see [http://www.laurentianweb.com/aqinfo1.htm Laurentianweb, "Alliance Quebec Information: Regional Community Organizations"]&lt;/ref&gt; while six of the group's eight chapters on the [[Island of Montreal]] merged in order to avoid closing.&lt;ref&gt;The new Montreal Chapter could send six times as many delegates to the annual convention as the other chapters; see [http://www.laurentianweb.com/aqinfo1.htm LaurentianWeb, "Alliance Quebec Information"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the [[Chief Electoral Officer of Quebec]] investigated alleged irregularities during the [[1995 Quebec sovereignty referendum]], finding among other things that votes in three mainly federalist [[Electoral district (Canada)|ridings]] had been rejected without valid reasons. Alliance Quebec sued the Quebec government to try to force it to re-examine the rejected ballots in all 125 Quebec ridings. The trial judge ruled against AQ in 2000. AQ appealed, but ceased operations in 2005 (see below). In 2008 the Chief Electoral Officer got the court's permission to destroy the ballots after ruling that AQ's appeal had taken too long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/montreal/story/2008/05/01/qc-referendumballots0501.html |title=CBC News (May 1, 2008) |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2008-05-01 |accessdate=2011-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502083406/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/montreal/story/2008/05/01/qc-referendumballots0501.html |archivedate=May 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Final years — radicalization and closure: 1998–2005 ==

In May 1998, the group elected a "radical" president, [[Montreal Gazette]] columnist [[William Johnson (author)|William Johnson]]. Previously a vocal critic of AQ, he won by rallying a group known derisively as "angryphones" (mainly members of the tiny Equality Party and some listeners of right wing talk radio shows, particularly the [[Howard Galganov]] show).  He in turn supported Equality Party members for positions on AQ's board of directors.  Unlike previous presidents, he made no attempt to meet with political leaders, preferring to conduct his lobbying through media, such as on radio talk shows.  Also unlike previous presidents, who generally accepted the objectives of Bill 101 and focused on changing how it was applied, Johnson questioned the commitment to tolerance and human rights of those who supported Bill 101.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g., W. Johnson, "The Historical Background of the Situation of English-speaking Quebecers", quoted in ''[http://www.neuvel.net/Quebec_ling.htm Language and Language Laws in Quebec]''&lt;/ref&gt;

After his election, Johnson organized two demonstrations against stores, in particular [[Eaton's]] and [[The Hudson's Bay Company]], that did not place English on their in-store advertising&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/1998/10/03/signs981003a.html |title=CBC News |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=1998-11-13 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which was once again legal after amendments to the Charter of the French Language in 1994). Johnson told a crowd of demonstrators that he refused an Eaton's offer to put up English signs in their stores if AQ would quietly call off the protest, as Johnson wanted to make it a public issue.  Johnson also had AQ's constitution amended to add his view that Canada's federal government should refuse to recognize a Quebec unilateral [[declaration of independence]].   Johnson also made headlines when the [[Entartistes]] threw a cream pie in his face while he marched in Montreal's 1998 [[Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day]] parade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.canada.com/montrealgazette/features/viewpoints/story.html?id=79c98166-3381-429f-8a64-856ac7f1d527&amp;p=1 |title=Montreal Gazette (16 June 2009) |publisher=.canada.com |date=2009-06-16 |accessdate=2011-04-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017141122/http://www2.canada.com/montrealgazette/features/viewpoints/story.html?id=79c98166-3381-429f-8a64-856ac7f1d527&amp;p=1 |archive-date=2013-10-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson's presidential campaign and his first six months as president temporarily brought more media attention and members to Alliance Quebec, as the PQ government and Quebec nationalist groups publicly criticized AQ's new, more confrontational tone.  However, Johnson called off the group's protests in October 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.highbeam.com/4341/article-1G1-21193947/precarious-peace |title=Maclean's (October 12, 1998) |publisher=Business.highbeam.com |date=1998-10-12 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and AQ's media coverage fell considerably, never to recover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=%22Alliance+Quebec%22+source%3A%22-newswire%22+source%3A%22-wire%22+source%3A%22-presswire%22+source%3A%22-PR%22+source%3A%22-press%22+source%3A%22-release%22+source%3A%22-wikipedia%22&amp;btnG=Search+Archives&amp;scoring=a |title=Google News archive for "Alliance Quebec" |publisher=News.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Johnson's presidency and those of his similarly minded successors also provoked a negative reaction from the mainstream community of anglophones that formerly supported AQ.

The first funding decrease (from $934,000 to $634,000 annually) came in 2001 after twenty anglophone groups ended their affiliation with Alliance Quebec and asked for separate government funding through the newly formed Quebec Community Groups Network.  A second series of funding cuts (to $200,000 annually) came in 2003-2004 after federal government dissatisfaction with AQ's lack of spending controls and a drop in its membership and influence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.francisscarpaleggia.parl.gc.ca/pub_details.asp?lang=en&amp;pubID=1014 Francis Scarpaleggia, MP]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the [[Department of Canadian Heritage]] finally discontinued its grant in 2005 after AQ failed to produce audited [[financial statements]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://cf.groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Pour-le-Pays-du-Quebec/conversations/topics/16057?var=1 T.

== Structure ==

Alliance Quebec was registered as a non-profit association in Quebec, with a headquarters in Montreal.  Anyone could join as a member by paying a nominal fee of $5–$10.  Membership entitled them to participate in the regional chapter in which they lived.  Each regional chapter had its own board of directors and executive and obtained their budget mainly from membership fees.

Each chapter could send 9 delegates to the annual convention, which took place each May in Montreal.  In the 1990s, six chapters in central Montreal merged, which allowed the merged chapter to send up to 54 delegates.  (In the William Johnson era, the [[West Island]] chapter's number of delegates was increased to reflect that it was the chapter with the second-largest number of members.)  A youth commission of members under thirty years of age also existed and could send up to 18 delegates to the convention.  Affiliated groups such as the Townshippers' Association could also send delegates, as could affiliated universities, hospitals and community groups.  The outgoing president and board of directors were also entitled to vote at the convention, representing 41 delegates. In theory, an annual convention could have nearly 400 delegates during the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Goodfellow |url=http://www.laurentianweb.com/aqinfo1.htm#delegate |title="Alliance Quebec Information" (1998) |publisher=LaurentianWeb |date=1998-05-01 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice, the number of delegates attending annual conventions decreased over time as membership fell and affiliated groups stopped participating; the annual convention in 1985 had about 470 delegates&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lhUyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2aUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=eric-maldoff&amp;pg=2286%2C31365 |title=Montreal Gazette (May 1, 1985, p.A4) |publisher=News.google.com |date=1985-05-01 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; while each of the conventions from 1999 onward had under 100 delegates.

The annual convention chose the president and [[treasurer]] of AQ for the upcoming year. (In the William Johnson era, the president's term was lengthened to two years, although each subsequent president resigned before the end of their full two-year term.)  The delegates would also choose the board of directors.  Half of the forty-person board of directors of AQ would be up for election annually for a two-year term; the top twenty candidates who received the most votes being elected.  The new board of directors would meet immediately after the convention to choose the remaining executive positions, including [[vice president]], vice president "off-[[Island of Montreal|island]]" (meaning from outside of Montreal), [[Secretary (club)|secretary]], and [[chairman of the board]].  The group also had an "Advisory Council" of prominent anglophones to advise the group on important issues from time to time, but this fell into disuse by the late 1990s.

The executives and directors were [[Volunteering|volunteer]] positions (although the president received a [[stipend]].)  There were also a number of paid staff members (around two dozen in 1994),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk2/ftp04/mq24370.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; such as a general director, a fundraiser, receptionists, researchers and organizers, paid for mainly from federal government grants.

For most of its existence, AQ also maintained committees to study issues.  These included (at various times)committees for health and social services, education, access to English schools, youth employment, legal affairs, communication, internal rules, and membership.  Some committees organized events and activities. One of these activities, "Youth Employment Services", became independent of AQ in the 1990s and continues to operate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yesmontreal.ca/yes.php] Youth Employment Services website&lt;/ref&gt;  Larger chapters also had some committees, especially in the group's early years.

{{Hinduism}}
'''Ananyatā''' ([[Sanskrit]]:अनन्यता) means – 'having no equal', 'matchless', 'peerless', 'identity', 'sameness' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=V.S.Apte|publisher=Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|page=75|url= http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/search3advanced?dbname=apte&amp;query=%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BE&amp;matchtype=exact&amp;display=utf8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a form of devotion in which the devotee is solely dependent on God. ''Ananyata'' is the doctrine that makes no distinction between God and the Atman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the Hindu World part 2|publisher=Concept Publishing|pages=434–435|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=WjDcd0cTFxQC&amp;pg=PA435&amp;dq=ananyata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ma-0VPrPOMyWuATny4DQDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=ananyata&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Narada Bhakti Sutra]]s No. IX and X read as follows :- &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Yoga of Spiritual Devotion|author=Prem Prakash|publisher=Inner Traditions|pages=23–25|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=LrlzAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=ananyata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fa60VK2BMImgugTe54HgBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=ananyata&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:तस्मिन्ननन्यता तद्विरोधिशूदासीनता च |

: " Inner stillness, furthermore, requires a single-hearted intention, and disinterest in what is antagonistic to spiritual devotion. "

:अन्याश्रयाणां त्यागोऽनन्यता |

: " When one is single-hearted, one relinquishes seeking security in anything other than God. "

With these words [[Narada|Nārada]] explains ''ananyatā'' as the state in which the mind of the devotee does not waver or goes astray, remains one-pointed ever steady in the contemplation of God to the exclusion of everything else, in that state everything is envisioned in God as His cosmic play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Secrets of Bhakti|author=Taoshobuddha|publisher=Brij Saksena|page=24|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=eyvkAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=ananyata+vedanta&amp;dq=ananyata+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NLC0VLTYDoyJuASlv4GABQ&amp;redir_esc=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita Vedantists]], ''ananyatā'' means absolute oneness or non-otherness of the individual self (''[[Jiva]]'') and the Universal Self (''[[Brahman]]''), the absolute height of enlightenment, ''atmaikatya'' which is the absolute identity of the phenomenal selves with the Supreme Self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of Sankar’s Advaita Vedanta|author=Shyama Kumar Chattopadhyaya|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|page=6|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=IPasbJW-1PwC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=ananyata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fa60VK2BMImgugTe54HgBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=ananyata&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6833">In the mathematical subject of [[geometric group theory]], the '''Baumslag–Gersten group''', also known as the '''Baumslag group''', is a particular [[one-relator group]] exhibiting some remarkable properties regarding its finite [[quotient group]]s, its [[Dehn function]] and the complexity of its [[word problem for groups|word problem]].

The group is given by the [[group presentation|presentation]]

: &lt;math&gt; G=\langle a,t \mid a^{a^t}=a^2\rangle =\langle a, t \mid (t^{-1}a^{-1}t) a (t^{-1} at)=a^2 \rangle  &lt;/math&gt;

Here exponential notation for group elements denotes conjugation, that is, for &lt;math&gt;g, h\in G, g^h=h^{-1}gh.&lt;/math&gt;

==History==
The Baumslag–Gersten group ''G'' was originally introduced in a 1969 paper of [[Gilbert Baumslag]],&lt;ref name=B&gt; Gilbert Baumslag, ''A non-cyclic one-relator group all of whose finite factor groups are cyclic'', [[Journal of the Australian Mathematical Society]] '''10''' (1969) 497–498. {{MR|0254127}} &lt;/ref&gt; as an example of a non-[[residually finite]] [[one-relator group]] with an additional remarkable property that all finite [[quotient group]]s of this group are cyclic. Later, in 1992, Gersten&lt;ref name=Ger&gt;S. M. Gersten, ''Dehn functions and &lt;math&gt;l_1&lt;/math&gt;-norms of finite presentations''. Algorithms and classification in combinatorial group theory (Berkeley, CA, 1989), 195–224, Math. Sci. Res. Inst. Publ., 23, Springer, New York, 1992. {{doi|10.1007/978-1-4613-9730-4_9}} {{MR|1230635}} &lt;/ref&gt; showed that ''G'', despite being a one-relator group given by a rather simple presentation, has the [[Dehn function]] growing very quickly, namely faster than any fixed iterate of the exponential function. This example remains the fastest known growth of the Dehn function among one-relator groups. In 2011 Myasnikov, Ushakov and Won proved that ''G'' has the [[word problem for groups|word problem]] solvable in polynomial time.

==Baumslag-Gersten group as an HNN extension==

The Baumslag–Gersten group ''G'' can also be realized as an [[HNN extension]] of the [[Baumslag–Solitar group]] &lt;math&gt;BS(1,2)=\langle a, b\mid a^b=a^2\rangle &lt;/math&gt; with stable letter ''t'' and two cyclic associated subgroups&lt;math&gt;\langle a\rangle, \langle b\rangle &lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;G=\langle a,t \mid a^{a^t}=a^2\rangle=\langle a,b,t \mid a^b=a^2, a^t=b\rangle.  &lt;/math&gt;

==Properties of the Baumslag–Gersten group ''G''==

*Every finite [[quotient group]] of ''G'' is [[cyclic group|cyclic]]. In particular, the group ''G'' is not [[residually finite group|residually finite]].&lt;ref name=B/&gt;
*An endomorphism of ''G'' is either an automorphism or its image is a cyclic subgroup of ''G''. In particular the group ''G'' is [[Hopfian group|Hopfian]] and [[co-Hopfian group|co-Hopfian]].&lt;ref name=Br&gt;

'''''Beyond Natural Selection''''' is a 1991 book by Robert G. Wesson, published by [[MIT Press]].&lt;ref&gt;Ranger-Moore, James. (1992). ''Beyond Natural Selection by Robert G. Wesson''. ''[[Contemporary Sociology]]''. Vol. 21, No. 2. pp. 220-221.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/beyond-natural-selection "Beyond Natural Selection"]. [[MIT Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Wesson argues for the case of pluralism in [[biology]]. He suggests alternative mechanisms of evolution rather than [[natural selection]]. Wesson argues that [[reductionism]] is inadequate and looks for [[chaos theory]] as an example of a different approach that is needed to explain evolution. The book provides unsolved problems that Wesson believed natural selection could not account for.&lt;ref&gt;Wettersten, John. (1994). ''Beyond Natural Selection by Robert Wesson''. [[Review of Metaphysics]]. Vol. 47, No. 3, pp. 645-647.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

The paleontologist Joseph G. Carter in a critical review for the ''[[American Scientist]]'' wrote the book "includes innumerable oversimplifications and misrepresentations of both evolutionary theory and the paleontological record." Carter noted that the book was filled with errors such as Wesson's claim there is a lack of [[transitional fossil]]s. Carter wrote that the "book approaches the scientific illiteracy" of the intelligent design text ''[[Of Pandas and People]]'', and concluded it was an "embarrassment to the editors of the MIT Press".&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Joseph G. (1992). ''Beyond Natural Selection by Robert Wesson''. ''[[American Scientist]]''. Vol. 80, No. 5. p. 493.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecologist [[Arthur Shapiro (ecologist)|Arthur M. Shapiro]] in a review for ''[[The Quarterly Review of Biology]]'' negatively reviewed the book for misunderstanding evolutionary biology and poor scholarship. According to Shapiro he "found an average of just over one error... per page by checking pages of this book at random."&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, Arthur M. (1993). ''Beyond Natural Selection: A Bradford Book by Robert Wesson''. ''[[The Quarterly Review of Biology]]''. Vol. 68, No. 2. p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Peter J. Bowler]] compared the book to anti-Darwinian and [[Creationism|creationist]] works. He criticized the book for utilizing [[straw man]] arguments and presenting no valid scientific alternative to natural selection. Bowler noted that it is "easy to criticize an established theory, much more difficult to come up with a workable alternative... Hand waving about the creative power of the organism makes a nice-sounding philosophical position but a poor scientific theory".&lt;ref&gt;Bowler, Peter J. (1994). ''Beyond Natural Selection (Paperback Edn) by Robert Wesson''. Biology and Environment: Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. Vol. 94B, No. 1. p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[philosophy of thermal and statistical physics]], the '''Brownian ratchet''' or '''Feynman-Smoluchowski ratchet'''  is a [[thought experiment]] about an apparent [[perpetual motion]] machine first analysed in 1912 by Polish physicist [[Marian Smoluchowski]]&lt;ref name="Smoluchowski"&gt;M. von Smoluchowski (1912) Experimentell nachweisbare, der Ublichen Thermodynamik widersprechende Molekularphenomene, ''Phys.

The simple machine, consisting of a tiny [[paddle wheel]] and a [[ratchet (device)|ratchet]], appears to be an example of a [[Maxwell's demon]], able to extract useful work from [[thermal fluctuations|random fluctuations]] (heat) in a system at [[thermal equilibrium]] in violation of the [[second law of thermodynamics]].  Detailed analysis by Feynman and others showed why it cannot actually do this.

==The machine==
The device consists of a gear known as a [[ratchet (device)|ratchet]] that rotates freely in one direction but is prevented from rotating in the opposite direction by a [[pawl]].  The ratchet is connected by an axle to a [[paddle wheel]] that is immersed in a [[fluid]] of [[molecule]]s at [[temperature]] &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt;.  The molecules constitute a [[heat bath]] in that they undergo random [[Brownian motion]] with a mean [[kinetic energy]] that is determined by the [[temperature]].  The device is imagined as being small enough that the impulse from a single molecular collision can turn the paddle.  Although such collisions would tend to turn the rod in either direction with equal probability, the pawl allows the ratchet to rotate in one direction only. The net effect of many such random collisions would seem to be that the ratchet rotates continuously in that direction.  The ratchet's motion then can be used to do [[work (physics)|work]] on other systems, for example lifting a weight (''m'') against gravity.  The energy necessary to do this work apparently would come from the heat bath, without any heat gradient. Were such a machine to work successfully, its operation would violate the [[second law of thermodynamics]], one form of which states: "It is impossible for any device that operates on a cycle to receive heat from a single reservoir and produce a net amount of work."

==Why it fails==
Although at first sight the Brownian ratchet seems to extract useful work from Brownian motion, Feynman demonstrated that if the entire device is at the same temperature, the ratchet will not rotate continuously in one direction but will move randomly back and forth, and therefore will not produce any useful work.  The reason is that since the pawl is at the same temperature as the paddle, it will also undergo Brownian motion, "bouncing" up and down.  It therefore will intermittently fail by allowing a ratchet tooth to slip backward under the pawl while it is up.  Another issue is that when the pawl rests on the sloping face of the tooth, the spring which returns the pawl exerts a sideways force on the tooth which tends to rotate the ratchet in a backwards direction.    Feynman demonstrated that if the temperature &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt; of the ratchet and pawl is the same as the temperature &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; of the paddle, then the failure rate must equal the rate at which the ratchet ratchets forward, so that no net motion results over long enough periods or in an ensemble averaged sense.&lt;ref name="Feynman" /&gt; A simple but rigorous proof that no net motion occurs no matter what shape the teeth are was given by [[Marcelo Osvaldo Magnasco|Magnasco]].&lt;ref name="forced"&gt;{{cite journal

If, on the other hand, &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt; is smaller than &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt;, the ratchet will indeed move forward, and produce useful work.  In this case, though, the energy is extracted from the temperature gradient between the two thermal reservoirs, and some [[waste heat]] is exhausted into the lower temperature reservoir by the pawl.  In other words, the device functions as a miniature [[heat engine]], in compliance with the second law of thermodynamics. Conversely, if &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt; is greater than &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt;, the device will rotate in the opposite direction.

The Feynman ratchet model led to the similar concept of [[Brownian motor]]s, [[nanomachine]]s which can extract useful work not from thermal noise but from [[chemical potential]]s and other microscopic [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|nonequilibrium]] sources, in compliance with the laws of thermodynamics.&lt;ref name="forced" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diode]]s are an electrical analog of the ratchet and pawl, and for the same reason cannot produce useful work by rectifying [[Johnson noise]] in a circuit at uniform temperature.

nonvanishing correlation function of odd order greater than one.

==History==
The [[ratchet and pawl]] was first discussed as a Second Law-violating device by [[Gabriel Lippmann]] in 1900.&lt;ref name="Harmer"&gt;

  | accessdate = 2010-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912, Polish physicist [[Marian Smoluchowski]]&lt;ref name="Smoluchowski" /&gt; gave the first correct qualitative explanation of why the device fails; thermal motion of the pawl allows the ratchet's teeth to slip backwards.  Feynman did the first quantitative analysis of the device in 1962 using the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]], showing that if the temperature of the paddle ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' was greater than the temperature of the ratchet ''T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', it would function as a [[heat engine]], but if ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' there would be no net motion of the paddle.  In 1996, [[Juan Parrondo]] and Pep Español used a variation of the above device in which no ratchet is present, only two paddles, to show that the axle connecting the paddles and ratchet conducts heat between reservoirs; they argued that although Feynman's conclusion was correct, his analysis was flawed because of his erroneous use of the [[Quasistatic process|quasistatic]] approximation, resulting in incorrect equations for efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:Brillouin-Paradoxon.svg|thumb|Brillouin paradox: an electrical analogue of the Brownian ratchet.]]

[[Léon Brillouin]] in 1950 discussed an electrical circuit analogue that uses a [[rectifier]] (such as a diode) instead of a ratchet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.78.627.2| title = Can the Rectifier Become a Thermodynamical Demon?| year = 1950| last1 = Brillouin | first1 = L.| journal = Physical Review| volume = 78| issue = 5| pages = 627-628|bibcode = 1950PhRv...78..627B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was the diode would rectify the [[Johnson noise]] thermal current fluctuations produced by the [[resistor]], generating a [[direct current]]  which could be used to perform work. In the detailed analysis it was shown that the thermal fluctuations within the diode generate an [[electromotive force]] that cancels the voltage from rectified current fluctuations.  Therefore, just as with the ratchet, the circuit will produce no useful energy if all the components are at thermal equilibrium (at the same temperature); a DC current will be produced only when the diode is at a lower temperature than the resistor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1063/1.1652709| title = Spontaneous Reverse Current Due to the Brillouin EMF in a Diode| year = 1969| last1 = Gunn | first1 = J.

==Granular gas==
Researchers from the University of Twente, the University of Patras in Greece, and the Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter have constructed a Feynman-Smoluchowski engine which, when not in thermal equilibrium, converts pseudo-[[Brownian motion]] into [[work (physics)|work]] by means of a [[Granular material#Granular gases|granular gas]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fom.nl/live/english/news/artikel.pag?objectnumber=120223 "Classical thought experiment brought to life in granular gas"], ''[[Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter]]'', Utrecht, 18 June 2010. Retrieved on 2010-06-24.&lt;/ref&gt; which is a conglomeration of solid particles vibrated with such vigour that the system assumes a gas-like state.  The constructed engine consisted of four vanes which were allowed to rotate freely in a vibrofluidized granular gas.&lt;ref name="eshuis"&gt;

This seems to contradict Feynman's hypothesis.  However, this system is not in perfect thermal equilibrium: energy is constantly being supplied to maintain the fluid motion of the beads.  Vigorous vibrations on top of a shaking device mimic the nature of a molecular gas.  Unlike an [[ideal gas]], though, in which tiny particles move constantly, stopping the shaking would simply cause the beads to drop.  In the experiment, this necessary out-of-equilibrium environment was thus maintained.  Work was not immediately being done, though; the ratchet effect only commenced beyond a critical shaking strength.  For very strong shaking, the vanes of the paddle wheel interacted with the gas, forming a convection roll, sustaining their rotation.&lt;ref name="eshuis" /&gt;  The experiment was [http://stilton.tnw.utwente.nl/dryquicksand/ratchet/ratchet.html filmed].

The '''common beisa oryx''' (''Oryx beisa beisa'') also known as the '''beisa oryx''' is a [[nominate subspecies]] of the [[East African oryx]] native to the [[Horn of Africa]] and [[Kenya]]. It is closely related to the [[fringe-eared oryx]]. 
There are five species of Oryx. Although they are very similar in appearance they have few distinct characteristics. Common Beisa Oryx have fringe-ears and black tufts of hair that extend past their ears. However, all species of Oryx are compact and muscular with relative long bodies and broad necks. There are not any marked difference between male and female Oryx. 
The Common Beisa Oryx enjoy feeding on variety of grass species. They feed during the day when the plants hold the most water. During dry season, they feed on poisonous adenium plant. 

==Habitat==
Beisa oryx once inhibited a large region of Northeastern Africa, from Sudan to Africa down to Tanzania, but it has been going extinct rapidly. Now they mostly remain in Ethiopia and Northern Kenya. Beisa oryx stay in bushland and grassland areas. During wet season, they move to high ground, avoid tall grass and saturated areas. They move great distant to find a perfect location and stay for few seasons.

{{redirect|Compactness}}
[[File:Compact.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|The interval {{math|''A'' {{=}} (−∞, −2]}} is not compact because it is not bounded. The interval {{math|''C'' {{=}} (2, 4)}} is not compact because it is not closed. The interval {{math|''B'' {{=}} [0, 1]}} is compact because it is both closed and bounded.]]
In [[mathematics]], and more specifically in [[general topology]], '''compactness''' is a property that generalizes the notion of a subset of [[Euclidean space]] being [[closed set|closed]] (that is, containing all its [[limit point]]s) and [[bounded set|bounded]] (that is, having all its points lie within some fixed distance of each other). Examples include a [[closed interval]], a [[rectangle]], or a finite set of points. This notion is defined for more general [[topological space]]s than Euclidean space in various ways.

One such generalization is that a topological space is [[sequentially compact|''sequentially'' compact]] if every [[infinite sequence]] of points sampled from the space has an infinite [[subsequence]] that converges to some point of the space. The [[Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem]] states that a subset of Euclidean space is compact in this sequential sense if and only if it is closed and bounded. Thus, if one chooses an infinite number of points in the ''closed'' [[unit interval]] {{math|[0, 1]}} some of those points will get arbitrarily close to some real number in that space. For instance, some of the numbers {{nowrap|1/2, 4/5, 1/3, 5/6, 1/4, 6/7, &amp;hellip;}} accumulate to 0 (others accumulate to 1). The same set of points would not accumulate to any point of the ''open'' unit interval {{math|(0, 1)}}; so the open unit interval is not compact. Euclidean space itself is not compact since it is not bounded. In particular, the sequence of points {{nowrap|0, 1, 2, 3, …}} has no subsequence that converges to any real number.

Apart from closed and bounded subsets of Euclidean space, typical examples of compact spaces include spaces consisting not of geometrical points but of [[function space|functions]]. The term ''compact'' was introduced into mathematics by [[Maurice Fréchet]] in 1904 as a distillation of this concept.  Compactness in this more general situation plays an extremely important role in [[mathematical analysis]], because many classical and important theorems of 19th-century analysis, such as the [[extreme value theorem]], are easily generalized to this situation.  A typical application is furnished by the [[Arzelà–Ascoli theorem]] or the [[Peano existence theorem]], in which one is able to conclude the existence of a function with some required properties as a limiting case of some more elementary construction.

Various equivalent notions of compactness, including [[Sequentially compact space|sequential compactness]] and [[limit point compact]]ness, can be developed in general [[metric space]]s. In general topological spaces, however, different notions of compactness are not necessarily equivalent. The most useful notion, which is the standard definition of the unqualified term ''compactness'', is phrased in terms of the existence of finite families of [[open set]]s that "[[Cover (topology)|cover]]" the space in the sense that each point of the space lies in some set contained in the family. This more subtle notion, introduced by [[Pavel Alexandrov]] and [[Pavel Urysohn]] in 1929, exhibits compact spaces as generalizations of [[finite set]]s.  In spaces that are compact in this sense, it is often possible to patch together information that holds [[local property|locally]]&amp;mdash;that is, in a neighborhood of each point&amp;mdash;into corresponding statements that hold throughout the space, and many [[#Theorems|theorems]] are of this character.

The term '''compact set''' is sometimes a synonym for compact space, but usually refers to a [[#Compactness of subsets|compact subspace]] of a topological space.

== Historical development ==
In the 19th century, several disparate mathematical properties were understood that would later be seen as consequences of compactness.  On the one hand, [[Bernard Bolzano]] ([[#CITEREFBolzano1817|1817]]) had been aware that any bounded sequence of points (in the line or plane, for instance) has a subsequence that must eventually get arbitrarily close to some other point, called a [[limit point]].  Bolzano's proof relied on the [[method of bisection]]: the sequence was placed into an interval that was then divided into two equal parts, and a part containing infinitely many terms of the sequence was selected.  The process could then be repeated by dividing the resulting smaller interval into smaller and smaller parts until it closes down on the desired limit point.  The full significance of [[Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem|Bolzano's theorem]], and its method of proof, would not emerge until almost 50 years later when it was rediscovered by [[Karl Weierstrass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kline|1972|pp=952–953}}; {{harvnb|Boyer|Merzbach|1991|p=561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1880s, it became clear that results similar to the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem could be formulated for [[function spaces|spaces of functions]] rather than just numbers or geometrical points. The idea of regarding functions as themselves points of a generalized space dates back to the investigations of [[Giulio Ascoli]] and [[Cesare Arzelà]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kline|1972|loc=Chapter 46, §2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The culmination of their investigations, the [[Arzelà–Ascoli theorem]], was a generalization of the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem to families of [[continuous function]]s, the precise conclusion of which was that it was possible to extract a [[uniform convergence|uniformly convergent]] sequence of functions from a suitable family of functions.  The uniform limit of this sequence then played precisely the same role as Bolzano's "limit point".  Towards the beginning of the twentieth century, results similar to that of Arzelà and Ascoli began to accumulate in the area of [[integral equation]]s, as investigated by [[David Hilbert]] and [[Erhard Schmidt]].  For a certain class of [[Green's function|Green functions]] coming from solutions of integral equations, Schmidt had shown that a property analogous to the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem held in the sense of [[mean convergence]]&amp;mdash;or convergence in what would later be dubbed a [[Hilbert space]].  This ultimately led to the notion of a [[compact operator]] as an offshoot of the general notion of a compact space. It was [[Maurice René Fréchet|Maurice Fréchet]] who, in [[#CITEREFFréchet1906|1906]], had distilled the essence of the Bolzano–Weierstrass property and coined the term ''compactness'' to refer to this general phenomenon (he used the term already in his 1904 paper&lt;ref&gt;Frechet, M. 1904. Generalisation d'un theorem de Weierstrass. Analyse Mathematique.&lt;/ref&gt; which led to the famous 1906 thesis).

However, a different notion of compactness altogether had also slowly emerged at the end of the 19th century from the study of the [[linear continuum|continuum]], which was seen as fundamental for the rigorous formulation of analysis.  In 1870, [[Eduard Heine]] showed that a [[continuous function]] defined on a closed and bounded interval was in fact [[uniformly continuous]].  In the course of the proof, he made use of a lemma that from any countable cover of the interval by smaller open intervals, it was possible to select a finite number of these that also covered it. The significance of this lemma was recognized by [[Émile Borel]] ([[#CITEREFBorel1895|1895]]), and it was generalized to arbitrary collections of intervals by [[Pierre Cousin]] (1895) and [[Henri Lebesgue]] ([[#CITEREFLebesgue1904|1904]]).  The [[Heine–Borel theorem]], as the result is now known, is another special property possessed by closed and bounded sets of real numbers.

This property was significant because it allowed for the passage from [[local property|local information]] about a set (such as the continuity of a function) to global information about the set (such as the uniform continuity of a function).  This sentiment was expressed by {{harvtxt|Lebesgue|1904}}, who also exploited it in the development of the [[Lebesgue integral|integral now bearing his name]].  Ultimately the Russian school of [[point-set topology]], under the direction of [[Pavel Alexandrov]] and [[Pavel Urysohn]], formulated Heine–Borel compactness in a way that could be applied to the modern notion of a [[topological space]].  {{harvtxt|Alexandrov|Urysohn|1929}} showed that the earlier version of compactness due to Fréchet, now called (relative) [[sequential compactness]], under appropriate conditions followed from the version of compactness that was formulated in terms of the existence of finite subcovers.  It was this notion of compactness that became the dominant one, because it was not only a stronger property, but it could be formulated in a more general setting with a minimum of additional technical machinery, as it relied only on the structure of the open sets in a space.
&lt;!--
One of the main reasons for studying compact spaces is because they are in some ways very similar to [[finite set]]s: there are many results which are easy to show for finite sets, whose proofs carry over with minimal change to compact spaces. Here is an example:

* Suppose ''X'' is a [[Hausdorff space]], and we have a point ''x'' in ''X'' and a finite subset ''A'' of ''X'' not containing ''x''. Then we can [[separated sets|separate]] ''x'' and ''A'' by [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhoods]]: for each ''a'' in ''A'', let ''U''(''x'') and ''V''(''a'') be disjoint neighborhoods containing ''x'' and ''a'', respectively. Then the intersection of all the ''U''(''x'') and the union of all the ''V''(''a'') are the required neighborhoods of ''x'' and ''A''.

Note that if ''A'' is [[Infinity|infinite]], the proof fails, because the intersection of arbitrarily many neighborhoods of ''x'' might not be a neighborhood of ''x''. The proof can be "rescued", however, if ''A'' is compact: we simply take a finite subcover of the cover {{math|{''V''(''a'') : ''a'' ∈ A}}} of ''A'', then intersect the corresponding finitely many ''U''(''x''). In this way, we see that in a Hausdorff space, any point can be separated by neighborhoods from any compact set not containing it. In fact, repeating the argument shows that any two disjoint compact sets in a Hausdorff space can be separated by neighborhoods&amp;nbsp;– note that this is precisely what we get if we replace "point" (i.e. [[singleton set]]) with "compact set" in the Hausdorff [[separation axiom]]. Many of the arguments and results involving compact spaces follow such a pattern.
--&gt;

==Basic examples==
Any [[finite topological space|finite space]] is trivially compact. A non-trivial example of a compact space is the (closed) [[unit interval]] {{closed-closed|0,1}} of [[real number]]s.  If one chooses an infinite number of distinct points in the unit interval, then there must be some [[accumulation point]] in that interval. For instance, the odd-numbered terms of the sequence {{nowrap|1, 1/2, 1/3, 3/4, 1/5, 5/6, 1/7, 7/8, ...}} get arbitrarily close to&amp;nbsp;0, while the even-numbered ones get arbitrarily close to&amp;nbsp;1.  The given example sequence shows the importance of including the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] points of the interval, since the [[limit point]]s must be in the space itself — an open (or half-open) interval of the real numbers is not compact. It is also crucial that the interval be [[bounded set|bounded]], since in the interval {{closed-open|0,∞}} one could choose the sequence of points {{nowrap|0, 1, 2, 3, ...}}, of which no sub-sequence ultimately gets arbitrarily close to any given real number.

In two dimensions, closed [[Disk (mathematics)|disks]] are compact since for any infinite number of points sampled from a disk, some subset of those points must get arbitrarily close either to a point within the disc, or to a point on the boundary.  However, an open disk is not compact, because a sequence of points can tend to the boundary without getting arbitrarily close to any point in the interior.  Likewise, spheres are compact, but a sphere missing a point is not since a sequence of points can tend to the missing point, thereby not getting arbitrarily close to any point ''within'' the space.  Lines and planes are not compact, since one can take a set of equally-spaced points in any given direction without approaching any point.

==Definitions==
Various definitions of compactness may apply, depending on the level of generality.  A subset of [[Euclidean space]] in particular is called compact if it is [[closed set|closed]] and [[bounded set|bounded]].  This implies, by the [[Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem]], that any infinite [[sequence (mathematics)|sequence]] from the set has a [[subsequence]] that converges to a point in the set.  Various equivalent notions of compactness, such as [[sequential compactness]] and [[limit point compact]]ness, can be developed in general [[metric space]]s.

In general [[topological space]]s, however, the different notions of compactness are not equivalent, and the most useful notion of compactness&amp;mdash;originally called ''bicompactness''&amp;mdash;is defined using [[cover (topology)|cover]]s consisting of [[open set]]s (see ''Open cover definition'' below). That this form of compactness holds for closed and bounded subsets of Euclidean space is known as the [[Heine–Borel theorem]]. Compactness, when defined in this manner, often allows one to take information that is known [[local property|locally]]&amp;mdash;in a [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] of each point of the space&amp;mdash;and to extend it to information that holds globally throughout the space.  An example of this phenomenon is Dirichlet's theorem, to which it was originally applied by Heine, that a continuous function on a compact interval is [[uniformly continuous]]; here, continuity is a local property of the function, and uniform continuity the corresponding global property.

===Open cover definition===

Formally, a [[topological space]] {{mvar|X}} is called ''compact'' if each of its [[open cover]]s has a [[finite set|finite]] [[subcover]]. That is, {{mvar|X}} is compact if for every collection {{mvar|C}} of open subsets of {{mvar|X}} such that

:&lt;math&gt;X = \bigcup_{x \in C}x&lt;/math&gt;,

there is a '''finite''' subset {{mvar|F}} of {{mvar|C}} such that

:&lt;math&gt;X = \bigcup_{x \in F}x.&lt;/math&gt;

Some branches of mathematics such as [[algebraic geometry]], typically influenced by the French school of [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]], use the term ''quasi-compact'' for the general notion, and reserve the term ''compact'' for topological spaces that are both [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] and ''quasi-compact''.  A compact set is sometimes referred to as a ''compactum'', plural ''compacta''.

===Compactness of subsets===
A subset {{mvar|K}} of a topological space {{mvar|X}} is said to be compact if it is compact as a subspace (in the [[subspace topology]]).  That is, {{mvar|K}} is compact if for every arbitrary collection {{mvar|C}} of open subsets of {{mvar|X}} such that

:&lt;math&gt;K \subseteq \bigcup_{c \in C} c&lt;/math&gt;,

there is a '''finite''' subset {{mvar|F}} of {{mvar|C}} such that

:&lt;math&gt;K \subseteq \bigcup_{c \in F} c&lt;/math&gt;.

Compactness is a "topological" property. That is, if &lt;math&gt;K \subset Z \subset Y&lt;/math&gt;, with subset {{mvar|Z}} equipped with the subspace topology, then {{mvar|K}} is compact in {{mvar|Z}} if and only if {{mvar|K}} is compact in {{mvar|Y}}.

===Equivalent definitions===
Assuming the [[axiom of choice]], the following are equivalent:
# A topological space ''X''  is compact.
# Every [[open cover]] of ''X'' has a finite [[subcover]].
# ''X'' has a sub-base such that every cover of the space by members of the sub-base has a finite subcover ([[Alexander's sub-base theorem]])
# Any collection of closed subsets of ''X'' with the [[finite intersection property]] has nonempty intersection.
# Every [[Net (mathematics)|net]] on ''X'' has a convergent subnet (see the article on [[Net (mathematics)|nets]] for a proof).
# Every [[mathematical filter|filter]] on ''X'' has a convergent refinement.
# Every net on ''X'' has a cluster point.
# Every filter on ''X'' has a cluster point.
# Every [[ultrafilter]] on ''X'' converges to at least one point.
# Every infinite subset of ''X'' has a [[complete accumulation point]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Kelley|1955|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Euclidean space====
For any [[subset]] ''A'' of [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''A'' is compact if and only if it is [[closed set|closed]] and [[bounded set|bounded]]; this is the [[Heine–Borel theorem]].

As a [[Euclidean space]] is a metric space, the conditions in the next subsection also apply to all of its subsets. Of all of the equivalent conditions, it is in practice easiest to verify that a subset is closed and bounded, for example, for a closed [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] or closed ''n''-ball.

====Metric spaces====
For any metric space (''X'', ''d''), the following are equivalent:
# (''X'', ''d'') is compact.
# (''X'', ''d'') is [[completeness (topology)|complete]] and [[totally bounded]] (this is also equivalent to compactness for [[uniform space]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arkhangel'skii|Fedorchuk|1990|loc=Theorem 5.3.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# (''X'', ''d'') is sequentially compact; that is, every [[sequence]] in ''X'' has a convergent subsequence whose limit is in ''X'' (this is also equivalent to compactness for [[first-countable]] [[uniform space]]s).
# (''X'', ''d'') is limit point compact; that is, every infinite subset of ''X'' has at least one [[limit point]] in ''X''.
# (''X'', ''d'') is an image of a continuous function from the [[Cantor set]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willard|1970}} Theorem 30.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

A compact metric space (''X'', ''d'') also satisfies the following properties:
# [[Lebesgue's number lemma]]: For every open cover of ''X'', there exists a number {{nowrap|''δ'' &gt; 0}} such that every subset of ''X'' of diameter &lt; ''δ'' is contained in some member of the cover.
# (''X'', ''d'') is [[second-countable space|second-countable]], [[Separable space|separable]] and [[Lindelöf space|Lindelöf]] – these three conditions are equivalent for metric spaces. The converse is not true; e.g., a countable discrete space satisfies these three conditions, but is not compact.
# ''X'' is closed and bounded (as a subset of any metric space whose restricted metric is ''d''). The converse may fail for a non-Euclidean space; e.g. the [[real line]] equipped with the [[discrete metric]] is closed and bounded but not compact, as the collection of all [[Singleton (mathematics)|singletons]] of the space is an open cover which admits no finite subcover. It is complete but not totally bounded.

====Characterization by continuous functions====
Let ''X'' be a topological space and C(''X'') the ring of real continuous functions on ''X''.  For each ''p''&amp;isin;''X'', the evaluation map &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ev}_p\colon C(X)\to \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;
given by ev&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''f'')=''f''(''p'') is a ring homomorphism.  The [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of ev&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[maximal ideal]], since the [[residue field]] {{nowrap|C(''X'')/ker ev&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the field of real numbers, by the [[first isomorphism theorem]].  A topological space ''X'' is [[pseudocompact space|pseudocompact]] if and only if every maximal ideal in C(''X'') has residue field the real numbers.  For [[completely regular space]]s, this is equivalent to every maximal ideal being the kernel of an evaluation homomorphism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gillman|Jerison|1976|loc=§5.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are pseudocompact spaces that are not compact, though.

In general, for non-pseudocompact spaces there are always maximal ideals ''m'' in C(''X'') such that the residue field C(''X'')/''m'' is a ([[non-archimedean field|non-archimedean]]) [[hyperreal field]].  The framework of [[non-standard analysis]] allows for the following alternative characterization of compactness:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robinson||loc=Theorem 4.1.13}}&lt;/ref&gt; a topological space ''X'' is compact if and only if every point ''x'' of the natural extension ''*X'' is [[infinitesimal|infinitely close]] to a point ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of ''X'' (more precisely, ''x'' is contained in the [[monad (non-standard analysis)|monad]] of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;).

====Hyperreal definition====
A space ''X'' is compact if its [[hyperreal number|hyperreal extension]] ''*X'' (constructed, for example, by the [[ultrapower construction]]) has the property that every point of ''*X'' is infinitely close to some point of ''X''⊂''*X''. For example, an open real interval {{nowrap|''X'' {{=}} (0, 1)}} is not compact because its hyperreal extension *(0,1) contains infinitesimals, which are infinitely close to 0, which is not a point of ''X''.

== Properties of compact spaces ==

===Functions and compact spaces===
A [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] image of a compact space is compact.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arkhangel'skii|Fedorchuk|1990|loc=Theorem 5.2.2}}; See also {{planetmathref|id=4689|title=Compactness is preserved under a continuous map}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This implies the [[extreme value theorem]]: a continuous real-valued function on a nonempty compact space is bounded above and attains its supremum.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arkhangel'skii|Fedorchuk|1990|loc=Corollary 5.2.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Slightly more generally, this is true for an upper semicontinuous function.) As a sort of converse to the above statements, the pre-image of a compact space under a [[proper map]] is compact.

===Compact spaces and set operations===
A closed subset of a compact space is compact,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arkhangel'skii|Fedorchuk|1990|loc=Theorem 5.2.3}}; {{planetmathref|id=4177|title=Closed set in a compact space is compact}}; {{planetmathref|id=4691|title=Closed subsets of a compact set are compact}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a finite union of compact sets is compact.

The [[product topology|product]] of any collection of compact spaces is compact. (This is [[Tychonoff's theorem]], which is equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]].)

Every topological space ''X'' is an open [[dense topological subspace|dense subspace]] of a compact space having at most one point more than ''X'', by the [[Compactification (mathematics)|Alexandroff one-point compactification]].  By the same construction, every [[locally compact]] Hausdorff space ''X'' is an open dense subspace of a compact Hausdorff space having at most one point more than ''X''.

===Ordered compact spaces===
A nonempty compact subset of the [[real number]]s has a greatest element and a least element.

Let ''X'' be a [[total order|simply ordered]] set endowed with the [[order topology]]. Then ''X'' is compact if and only if ''X'' is a [[complete lattice]] (i.e. all subsets have suprema and infima).&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Steen|Seebach|1995|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
* Any [[finite topological space]], including the [[empty set]], is compact.  More generally, any space with a [[finite topology]] (only finitely many open sets) is compact; this includes in particular the [[trivial topology]].
* Any space carrying the [[cofinite topology]] is compact.
* Any [[locally compact]] Hausdorff space can be turned into a compact space by adding a single point to it, by means of [[Alexandroff one-point compactification]]. The one-point compactification of '''R''' is homeomorphic to the circle '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;; the one-point compactification of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is homeomorphic to the sphere '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Using the one-point compactification, one can also easily construct compact spaces which are not Hausdorff, by starting with a non-Hausdorff space.
* The [[right order topology]] or [[left order topology]] on any bounded [[totally ordered set]] is compact. In particular, [[Sierpiński space]] is compact.
* No [[discrete space]] with an infinite number of points is compact. The collection of all [[Singleton (mathematics)|singletons]] of the space is an open cover which admits no finite subcover. Finite discrete spaces are compact.
* In '''R''' carrying the [[lower limit topology]], no uncountable set is compact.
* In the [[cocountable topology]] on an uncountable set, no infinite set is compact. Like the previous example, the space as a whole is not [[locally compact]] but is still [[Lindelöf space|Lindelöf]].
* The closed [[unit interval]] {{closed-closed|0,1}} is compact. This follows from the [[Heine–Borel theorem]]. The open interval {{open-open|0,1}} is not compact: the [[open cover]] &lt;math&gt;\left ( \frac{1}{n}, 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right )&lt;/math&gt; for {{math|1={{mvar|n}} = 3, 4, … }} does not have a finite subcover. Similarly, the set of ''[[rational numbers]]'' in the closed interval {{closed-closed|0,1}} is not compact: the sets of rational numbers in the intervals &lt;math&gt;\left[0,\frac{1}{\pi}-\frac{1}{n}\right] \ \text{and} \ \left[\frac{1}{\pi}+\frac{1}{n},1\right]&lt;/math&gt; cover all the rationals in [0,&amp;nbsp;1] for {{math|1={{mvar|n}} = 4, 5, ... }} but this cover does not have a finite subcover. Here, the sets are open in the subspace topology even though they are not open as subsets of&amp;nbsp;'''R'''.
* The set '''R''' of all real numbers is not compact as there is a cover of open intervals that does not have a finite subcover. For example, intervals {{open-open|{{mvar|n}}−1, {{mvar|n}}+1}} , where {{mvar|n}} takes all integer values in '''Z''', cover '''R''' but there is no finite subcover.
* On the other hand, the [[extended real number line]] carrying the analogous topology ''is'' compact; note that the cover described above would never reach the points at infinity.  In fact, the set has the [[homeomorphism]] to [-1,1] of mapping each infinity to its corresponding unit and every real number to its sign multiplied by the unique number in the positive part of interval that results in its absolute value when divided by one minus itself, and since homeomorphisms preserve covers, the Heine-Borel property can be inferred.
* For every [[natural number]] {{mvar|n}}, the [[n-sphere|{{mvar|n}}-sphere]] is compact. Again from the Heine–Borel theorem, the closed unit ball of any finite-dimensional [[normed vector space]] is compact. This is not true for infinite dimensions; in fact, a normed vector space is finite-dimensional if and only if its [[closed unit ball]] is compact.
* On the other hand, the closed unit ball of the dual of a normed space is compact for the weak-* topology. ([[Alaoglu's theorem]])
* The [[Cantor set]] is compact. In fact, every compact metric space is a continuous image of the Cantor set.
* Consider the set ''K'' of all functions ''f'' : '''R''' → [0,1] from the real number line to the closed unit interval, and define a topology on ''K'' so that a sequence &lt;math&gt;\{f_n\}&lt;/math&gt; in ''K'' converges towards &lt;math&gt;f\in K&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\{f_n(x)\}&lt;/math&gt; converges towards ''f''(''x'') for all real numbers ''x''. There is only one such topology; it is called the topology of [[pointwise convergence]] or the [[product topology]]. Then ''K'' is a compact topological space; this follows from the [[Tychonoff theorem]].
* Consider the set ''K'' of all functions ''f''&amp;nbsp;: {{closed-closed|0,1}}&amp;nbsp;→ {{closed-closed|0,1}} satisfying the [[Lipschitz condition]] |''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''f''(''y'')|&amp;nbsp;≤ |''x''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''y''| for all ''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;{{closed-closed|0,1}}.  Consider on ''K''&amp;thinsp; the metric induced by the [[uniform convergence|uniform distance]] &lt;math&gt;d(f,g)=\sup_{x \in [0, 1]} |f(x)-g(x)|.&lt;/math&gt; Then by [[Arzelà–Ascoli theorem]] the space ''K'' is compact.
* The [[spectrum of an operator|spectrum]] of any [[bounded linear operator]] on a [[Banach space]] is a nonempty compact subset of the [[complex number]]s '''C'''. Conversely, any compact subset of '''C''' arises in this manner, as the spectrum of some bounded linear operator. For instance, a diagonal operator on the Hilbert space [[sequence spaces#ℓp spaces|&lt;math&gt;\ell^2&lt;/math&gt;]] may have any compact nonempty subset of '''C''' as spectrum.

=== Algebraic examples ===
* [[Compact group]]s such as an [[orthogonal group]] are compact, while groups such as a [[general linear group]] are not.
* Since the [[p-adic numbers|''p''-adic integers]] are [[homeomorphic]] to the Cantor set, they form a compact set.
* The [[spectrum of a ring|spectrum]] of any [[commutative ring]] with the [[Zariski topology]] (that is, the set of all prime ideals) is compact, but never [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] (except in trivial cases). In algebraic geometry, such topological spaces are examples of quasi-compact [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]], "quasi" referring to the non-Hausdorff nature of the topology.
* The [[spectrum of a boolean algebra|spectrum of a Boolean algebra]] is compact, a fact which is part of the [[Stone representation theorem]]. [[Stone space]]s, compact [[totally disconnected space|totally disconnected]] Hausdorff spaces, form the abstract framework in which these spectra are studied.  Such spaces are also useful in the study of [[profinite group]]s.
* The [[structure space]] of a commutative unital [[Banach algebra]] is a compact Hausdorff space.
* The [[Hilbert cube]] is compact, again a consequence of Tychonoff's theorem.
* A [[profinite group]] (e.g., Galois group) is compact.

'''Conceptual graphs''' ('''CGs''') are a formalism for [[knowledge representation]]. In the first published paper on CGs, [[John F. Sowa]] {{harv|Sowa|1976}} used them to represent the [[conceptual schema]]s used in [[database system]]s. The first book on CGs {{harv|Sowa|1984}} applied them to a wide range of topics in [[artificial intelligence]], [[computer science]], and [[cognitive science]].

== Since 1984, the model has been developed along three main directions: ==

=== A graphical interface for first-order logic ===
[[Image:Cat-on-mat.svg|thumb|left|250px|Elsie the cat is sitting on a mat]]
In this approach, a formula in [[first-order logic]] (predicate calculus) is represented by a labeled graph.

A linear notation, called the Conceptual Graph Interchange Format (CGIF), has been standardized in the [[ISO standard]] for [[common logic]].

The diagram above is an example of the ''display form'' for a conceptual graph. Each box is called a ''concept node'', and each oval is called a ''relation node''. In CGIF, this CG would be represented by the following statement:

{{code|[Cat Elsie] [Sitting *x] [Mat *y] (agent ?x Elsie) (location ?x ?y)}}

In CGIF, brackets enclose the information inside the concept nodes, and parentheses enclose the information inside the relation nodes. The letters x and y, which are called ''coreference labels'', show how the concept and relation nodes are connected. In CLIF, those letters are mapped to variables, as in the following statement:

{{code|(exists ((x Sitting) (y Mat)) (and (Cat Elsie) (agent x Elsie) (location x y)))}}

As this example shows, the asterisks on the coreference labels {{code|*x}} and {{code|*y}} in CGIF map to existentially quantified variables in CLIF, and the question marks on {{code|?x}} and {{code|?y}} map to bound variables in CLIF. A universal quantifier, represented {{code|@every*z}} in CGIF, would be represented {{code|forall (z)}} in CLIF.

Reasoning can be done by translating graphs into logical formulas, then applying a logical inference engine.

=== Diagrammatic calculus of logics ===
Another research branch continues the work on [[existential graph]]s of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], which were one of the origins of conceptual graphs as proposed by Sowa. In this approach, developed in particular by Dau {{harv|Dau|2003}}, conceptual graphs are conceptual [[diagram]]s rather than graphs in the sense of [[graph theory]], and reasoning operations are performed by operations on these diagrams.

=== Graph-based knowledge representation and reasoning model ===
Key features of GBKR, the graph-based knowledge representation and reasoning model developed by Chein and Mugnier and the Montpellier group {{harv|Chein|Mugnier|2009}}, can be summarized as follows:

* All kinds of knowledge (ontology, rules, constraints and facts) are labeled graphs, which provide an intuitive and easily understandable means to represent knowledge.
* Reasoning mechanisms are based on graph notions, basically the classical notion of [[graph homomorphism]]; this allows, in particular, to link basic reasoning problems to other fundamental problems in computer science (problems concerning [[Conjunctive query|conjunctive queries]] in [[relational database]]s, [[constraint satisfaction problem]], etc.
* The formalism is logically founded, i.e., it has a semantics in [[first-order logic]] and the inference mechanisms are sound and complete with respect to deduction in first-order logic.
* From a computational viewpoint, the graph homomorphism notion was recognized in the 1990s as a central notion, and complexity results and efficient algorithms have been obtained in several domains.

COGITANT and COGUI are tools that implement the GBKR model. COGITANT is a library of [[C++]] classes that implement most of the GBKR notions and reasoning mechanisms. COGUI is a graphical user interface dedicated to the construction of a GBKR knowledge base (it integrates COGITANT and, among numerous functionalities, it contains a translator from GBKR to [[RDF Schema|RDF/S]] and conversely).

==== Sentence generalization and generalization diagrams ====
Sentence [[generalization]] and generalization diagrams can be defined as a special sort of conceptual graphs which can be constructed automatically from syntactic [[parse tree]]s and support semantic classification task {{harv|Galitsky et al|2010}}. Similarity measure between syntactic parse trees can be done as a generalization operation on the lists of sub-trees of these trees. The diagrams are representation of mapping between the [[syntax]] generalization level and [[semantics]] generalization level (anti-unification of [[logic forms]]). Generalization diagrams are intended to be more accurate semantic representation than conventional conceptual graphs for individual sentences because only syntactic commonalities are represented at semantic level.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5161">'''Contemplative psychotherapy''' is an approach to psychotherapy that includes the use of personal contemplative practices and insights informed by the spiritual tradition of Buddhism.  Contemplative psychotherapy differs from other, more traditional methods of counseling in that the therapist brings to the therapeutic relationship qualities of [[mindfulness]] and [[Karuṇā|compassion]] in order to help clients access their fundamental goodness and natural wisdom. The practice of Contemplative Psychotherapy grew out of a dialogue between Tibetan Buddhist master [[Trungpa Rinpoche|Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche]] and Western psychologists and psychiatrists.  This discussion led to the opening of the Contemplative Psychotherapy Department at [[Naropa University]] in 1978 by Edward M. Podvoll, a psychiatrist, psychoanalyst and dedicated student of Trungpa.&lt;ref name=Kaklauskas&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Francis J. Kaklauskas|editor2=Susan Nimanheminda|editor3=Louis Hoffman|title=Brilliant Sanity: Buddhist Approaches to Psychotherapy|publisher=Universities of the Rockies Press|location=Colorado Springs, CO}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|ix}}

Contemplative psychotherapy may be said to have two parents: the 2,500-year-old wisdom tradition of Buddhism and the clinical traditions of Western Psychology, especially the Humanistic school.  Like all offspring it has much in common with both of its parents and yet is uniquely itself at the same time.  From Buddhism comes the practice of [[Mindfulness|mindfulness/awareness meditation]], together with a highly sophisticated understanding of the functioning of the mind in sanity and in confusion.  From Western psychology come the investigation of the stages of human development, a precise language for discussing mental disturbance and the intimate method of working with others known as "psychotherapy". The root teaching of the contemplative psychotherapy program is the notion of "brilliant sanity".  This means that we all have within us a natural dignity and wisdom. Practitioners of contemplative psychotherapy become experts at recognizing sanity within even the most confused and distorted states of mind and are trained to nurture this sanity in themselves and in their clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wegela|first=Karen Kissel|title=The Courage to be Present: Buddhism, Psychotherapy, and the Awakening of Natural Wisdom|year=2009|publisher=Shambhala|location=Boston, MA|pages=175–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core ideas==

===Brilliant sanity===

The basic premise of contemplative psychotherapy rests on the notion of ''"brilliant sanity"'', which suggests that we all have within us a natural dignity and wisdom and that our basic nature is characterized by clarity, openness, and compassion. This wisdom may be temporarily covered over, but it is there and may be cultivated. Practitioners of contemplative psychotherapy become experts at recognizing sanity within even the most confused and distorted states of mind and are trained to nurture this sanity in themselves and in their clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wegela|first=Karen Kissel|title=Contemplative Psychotherapy: A Path of Uncovering Brilliant Sanity|journal=Journal of Contemplative Psychotherapy|year=1994|volume=IX|pages=27–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;     

===Contemplative practice===
Buddhist psychology emphasizes the primacy of immediate experience. In the training of a contemplative psychotherapist, theoretical training is balanced with experiential training. By studying and experiencing his or her own mind, the contemplative therapist can then study and experience accurately the mind of others while engaging in therapeutic practices. The study of one's own mind can be achieved through meditation practice and body/mind awareness disciplines.&lt;ref name=Kaklauskas/&gt;{{rp|vi–vii}}

===Maitri space awareness===

Space awareness practice is designed to intensify and familiarize oneself with different
emotional and psychological states: both the "wisdom" aspects and the confused aspects. Maitri space awareness practice, when integrated with sitting meditation within a community environment, can assist practitioners in recognizing their own patterns, become friendly toward themselves in different states of mind, and develop genuine humor and compassion toward themselves and others. This often leads to relaxation and fearlessness in working with others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Trungpa|first=Chogyam|title=The Sanity We Are Born With|year=2005|publisher=Shambhala|location=Boston, MA|pages=165–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Body, speech and mind practice===

Contemplative psychotherapy makes use of the Body-Speech-Mind approach to clinical supervision as a way to bring the client, the client's world and the therapeutic relationship (as experienced by the contemplative psychotherapist) vividly into the group supervisory situation. This presence in turn is used to directly facilitate working with energetic and conceptual obstacles and provides a basis for subsequent therapeutic interventions.&lt;ref name=Kaklauskas/&gt;{{rp|175–194}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2405">In [[mathematics]] &amp;mdash; specifically, in [[large deviations theory]] &amp;mdash; the '''contraction principle''' is a [[theorem]] that states how a large deviation principle on one space "pushes forward" (via the [[Pushforward measure|pushforward]] of a probability measure) to a large deviation principle on another space ''via'' a [[continuous function]].

==Statement of the theorem==

Let ''X'' and ''Y'' be [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[topological space]]s and let (''&amp;mu;''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; be a family of [[probability measure]]s on ''X'' that satisfies the large deviation principle with [[rate function]] ''I''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;+∞].  Let ''T''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''Y'' be a continuous function, and let ''&amp;nu;''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''T''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;(''&amp;mu;''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&lt;/sub&gt;) be the push-forward measure of ''&amp;mu;''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&lt;/sub&gt; by ''T'', i.e., for each [[measurable set]]/event ''E''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''Y'',  ''&amp;nu;''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&lt;/sub&gt;(''E'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''&amp;mu;''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''E'')).  Let

:&lt;math&gt;J(y) := \inf \{ I(x) \mid x \in X \text{ and } T(x) = y \},&lt;/math&gt;

with the convention that the [[infimum]] of ''I'' over the [[empty set]] ∅ is +∞.  Then:
* ''J''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''Y''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;+∞] is a rate function on ''Y'',
* ''J'' is a good rate function on ''Y'' if ''I'' is a good rate function on ''X'', and
*  (''&amp;nu;''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&amp;gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; satisfies the large deviation principle on ''Y'' with rate function ''J''.

[[File:Avvakum by Pyotr Yevgenyevich Myasoyedov.jpg|thumb|The "[[baptism]] by fire" of [[Old Believer]] leader [[Avvakum]] in 1682]]

'''Death by burning''' is an execution method involving deliberately causing [[death]] through the effects of [[combustion]] or exposure to extreme heat. It has a long history as a form of [[capital punishment]], and many societies have employed it for activities considered criminal such as [[treason]], rebellious actions by slaves, [[heresy]], [[witchcraft]], [[arson]] (in Japan) and sexual transgressions, such as [[incest]] or [[homosexuality]].

The best known executions of this type are those where the condemned is bound to a large wooden stake and a fire lit beneath them. This is usually called '''burning at the stake''', or in some cases, ''[[auto-da-fé]]''. For burnings at the stake, if the fire was large (for instance, when a number of [[prison]]ers were [[executed]] at the same time), death often came from [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] before flames actually caused lethal harm to the body. If the fire was small, however, the condemned would burn for some time until death from [[hypovolemia]] (the loss of blood or other fluids, since extensive burns often require large amounts of intravenous fluid, because the subsequent inflammatory response causes significant capillary fluid leakage and oedema), [[heatstroke]] or the simple [[thermal decomposition]] of vital body parts.&lt;ref&gt;''Murphy'' (2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=tXywBrmhPTUC&amp;pg=PA67 pp. 67–68]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of death resulting from exposure to extreme heat are known. For example, pouring substances such as molten metal onto a person (or down their throat or into their ears), as well as enclosing persons within, or attaching them to, [[brazen bull|metal contraptions]] subsequently heated. Immersion in a heated liquid as a form of execution is considered distinct from death by burning, and classified as [[death by boiling]].

==Historical usage==

===Antiquity===

====Ancient Near East====

=====Old Babylonia=====
The 18th century BC law code promulgated by [[Babylonian King|Babylonian]] king [[Hammurabi]] specifies several crimes in which death by burning was thought appropriate. Looters of houses on fire could be cast into the flames, and priestesses who abandoned cloisters and began frequenting inns and taverns could also be punished by being burnt alive. Furthermore, a man who began committing incest with his mother after the death of his father could be ordered by courts to be burned alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Roth'' (2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=awrOHv-gtqQC&amp;pg=PA5 p. 5]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Ancient Egypt=====
In [[Ancient Egypt]], several incidents of burning alive perceived rebels are attested. For example, [[Senusret I]] (r. 1971–1926&amp;nbsp;BC) is said to have rounded up the rebels in campaign, and burnt them as human torches. Under the civil war flaring under [[Takelot II]] more than a thousand years later, the Crown Prince Osorkon showed no mercy, and burned several rebels alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Wilkinson'' (2011): Senusret I incident, [https://books.google.com/books?id=P07rgiJjsk4C&amp;pg=PA169 p. 169] Osorkon incident, [https://books.google.com/books?id=P07rgiJjsk4C&amp;pg=PA412 p. 412]&lt;/ref&gt; On the statute books, at least, women committing adultery might be burned to death. [[Jon Manchip White]], however, did not think capital judicial punishments were often carried out, pointing to the fact that the [[pharaoh]] had to personally ratify each verdict.&lt;ref&gt;''White'' (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=GVhQ_lDWq0EC&amp;pg=PA167 p. 167]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Greek historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] (fl. 1st century BC) asserts that the Egyptians had a particularly terrible punishment for children who murdered their parents: With sharpened reeds, bits of flesh the size of a finger were cut from the criminal's body. Then he was placed on a bed of thorns and burnt alive.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/1D*.html 1.77.8], accessed at [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/home.html LacusCurtius]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Assyria=====
In the [[Middle Assyrian period]], paragraph 40 in a preserved law text concerns the obligatory unveiled face for the professional prostitute, and the concomitant punishment if she violated that by veiling herself (the way wives were to dress in public):
{{quote|A prostitute shall not be veiled. Whoever sees a veiled prostitute shall seize her ... and bring her to the palace entrance. ... they shall pour hot pitch over her head.&lt;ref&gt;''Schneider'' (2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=4hHLe60cYBcC&amp;pg=PA154 p. 154]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrians]], mass executions seem to have been not only designed to instill terror and to enforce obedience, but also as proof of their might. For example, Neo-Assyrian King [[Asuhurnasirpal II]] (r. 883–859 BC) was evidently proud enough of his bloody work that he committed it to monument and eternal memory as follows:&lt;ref&gt;''Olmstead'' (1918) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1946342 p. 66]&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|I cut off their hands, I burned them with fire, a pile of the living men and of heads over against the city gate I set up, men I impaled on stakes, the city I destroyed and devastated, I turned it into mounds and ruin heaps, the young men and the maidens in the fire I burned.}}

====Hebraic tradition====
In [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 38, [[Judah (biblical person)|Judah]] orders [[Tamar (Genesis)|Tamar]]—the widow of his son, living in her father's household—to be burned when she is believed to have become pregnant by an extramarital sexual relation. Tamar saves herself by proving that Judah is himself the father of her child. In the [[Book of Jubilees]], the same story is basically told, with some intriguing differences, according to Caryn A. Reeder. In Genesis, Judah is exercising his patriarchal power at a distance, whereas he and the relatives seem more actively involved in Tamar's impending execution.&lt;ref&gt;''Reeder'' (2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=PiNSpBdtsCgC&amp;pg=PA82 p. 82]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hebraic law, death by burning was prescribed for ten forms of sexual crimes: The imputed crime of Tamar, namely that a married daughter of a priest commits adultery, and nine versions of relationships considered as incestuous, such as having sex with one's own daughter, or granddaughter, but also, for example, to have sex with one's mother-in-law or with one's wife's daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Full list in ''Quint'' (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=2nEZQXWsXG4C&amp;pg=PA257 p. 257]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Mishnah]], the following manner of burning the criminal is described:
{{quote|The obligatory procedure for execution by burning: They immersed him in dung up to his knees, rolled a rough cloth into a soft one and wound it about his neck. One pulled it one way, one the other until he opened his mouth. Thereupon one ignites the (lead) wick and throws it in his mouth, and it descends to his bowels and sears his bowels.}}

That is, the person dies from being fed molten lead.&lt;ref&gt;Quotation from ''Ben-Menahem, Edrei, Hecht'' (2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=J-ZE_BJpJnIC&amp;pg=PA111 p. 111]&lt;/ref&gt; The Mishnah is, however, a fairly late collections of laws, from about the 3rd century AD, and scholars believe it ''replaced'' the actual punishment of burning in the old biblical texts.&lt;ref&gt;On this view, see for example, ''Zvi Gilat, Lifshitz'' (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=4h8iAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA62 p. 62, footnote 73]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ancient Rome====
In the 6th century AD collection of the sayings and rulings of the pre-eminent jurists from earlier ages, the [[Digest (Roman law)|Digest]], a number of crimes are regarded as punishable by death by burning. The 3rd century jurist [[Ulpian]], for example, says that enemies of the state, and deserters to the enemy are to be burned alive. His rough contemporary, the juristical writer [[Callistratus (jurist)|Callistratus]] mentions that arsonists are typically burnt, as well as slaves who have conspired against the well-being of their masters (this last also, on occasion, being meted out to free persons of "low rank").&lt;ref&gt;See ''Watson'' (1998) '''Ulpian''', section 48.19.8.2, p. 361. '''Callistratus''', sections 48.19.28.11–12, p. 366&lt;/ref&gt; The punishment of burning alive arsonists (and traitors) seems to have been particularly ancient; it was included in the [[Twelve Tables]], a mid-5th BC law code, that is, about 700 years prior to the times of Ulpian and Callistratus.&lt;ref&gt;''Kyle'' (2002), [https://books.google.com/books?id=x4vekGBc_McC&amp;pg=PA53 p. 53]&lt;/ref&gt; According to ancient reports, [[Roman Empire|Roman]] authorities executed many of the early [[Martyr#In Christianity|Christian martyrs]] by burning. An example of this is the earliest chronicle of a martyrdom, that of [[Polycarp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.iv.iv.html|title=ANF01. The Apostolic Fathers with Justin Martyr and Irenaeus - Christian Classics Ethereal Library|website=www.ccel.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes this was by means of the ''[[tunica molesta]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Juvenal]] has an extended description of the tunica molesta, the punishment as meted out by Emperor [[Nero]] as contained in [[Tacitus]] matches the concept. See, for example ''Pagán'' (2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=bHzMYrWHjVoC&amp;pg=PA53 p. 53]&lt;/ref&gt; a flammable tunic:&lt;ref&gt;''Miley'' (1843), [https://books.google.com/books?id=iSsLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA223 pp. 223–224]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Siemiradski Fackeln.jpg|thumb|[[Nero's Torches]].]]

{{quote|... the Christian, stripped naked, was forced to put on a garment called the tunica molesta, made of papyrus, smeared on both sides with wax, and was then fastened to a high pole, from the top of which they continued to pour down burning pitch and lard, a spike fastened under the chin preventing the excruciated victim from turning the head to either side, so as to escape the liquid fire, until the whole body, and every part of it, was literally clad and cased in flame.}}

In AD 326, [[Constantine the Great]] promulgated a law that increased the penalties for parentally non-sanctioned "abduction" of their girls, and concomitant sexual intercourse/rape. The man would be burnt alive without the possibility of appeal, and the girl would receive the same treatment if she had participated willingly. Nurses who had corrupted their female wards and led them to sexual encounters would have molten lead poured down their throats.&lt;ref&gt;Law text found in ''Pharr'' (2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=-ROBb7SIvYgC&amp;pg=PA244 pp. 244–245] The full law was changed in context to the penalties just 20 years later by Constantine's son, [[Constantius II]], for free citizens aiding and abetting in the abduction, to an unspecified "capital punishment". The full severity of the law was to be kept, however, for slaves. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-ROBb7SIvYgC&amp;pg=PA245 p. 245], ''ibidem''&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Constantine also passed a law that said if a woman married her own slave, both would be subjected to capital punishment, the slave by burning.&lt;ref&gt;Law text in [[Codex Justinianus]] 9.11.1, as referred to in ''Winroth, Müller, Sommar'' (2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=4smZ4JjGJcsC&amp;pg=PA107 p. 107]&lt;/ref&gt; In AD 390, Emperor Theodosius issued an edict against male prostitutes and brothels offering such services; those found guilty should be burned alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Pickett'' (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=XH-SMq-NKf0C&amp;pg=PR21 p. xxi]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ritual child sacrifice in Carthage====
{{further|Religion in Carthage}}
[[File:Bardo National Museum tanit.jpg|left|thumb|100px|Tanit with a lion's head]]

Beginning in the early 3rd century BC, Greek and Roman writers have commented on the purported institutionalized [[child sacrifice]] the North African [[Carthaginians]] are said to have performed in honour of the gods [[Baal Hammon]] and [[Tanit]]. The earliest writer, [[Cleitarchus]] is among the most explicit. He says live infants were placed in the arms of a bronze statue, the statue's hands over a brazier, so that the infant slowly rolled into the fire. As it did so, the limbs of the infant contracted and the face was distorted into a sort of laughing grimace, hence called "the act of laughing". Other, later authors such as [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Plutarch]] says the throats of the infants were generally cut, before they were placed in the statue's embrace&lt;ref&gt;On ritual description, Plutarch, and in general, see ''Markoe'' (2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=smPZ-ou74EwC&amp;pg=PA132 pp. 132–136] On Diodorus, see ''Schwartz, Houghton, Macchiarelli, Bondioli'' (2010), [http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0009177 Skeletal remains..do not support] on phrase "the act of laughing", see for example, ''Decker'' (2001), [http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/uc_decker_carthrel3.htm p. 3]&lt;/ref&gt; In the vicinity of ancient Carthage, large scale grave yards containing the incinerated remains of infants, typically up to the age of 3, have been found; such graves are called "tophets". However, some scholars have argued that these findings are not evidence of ''systematic'' child sacrifice, and that estimated figures of ancient natural infant mortality (with cremation afterwards and reverent separate burial) might be the real historical basis behind the hostile reporting from non-Carthaginians. A late charge of the imputed sacrifice is found by the North African bishop [[Tertullian]], who says that child sacrifices were still carried out, in secret, in the countryside at his time, 3rd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;'''Generally accepting''' the tradition of child sacrifice, see ''Markoe'' (2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=smPZ-ou74EwC&amp;pg=PA132 pp. 132–136] '''Generally skeptical''', see ''Schwartz, Houghton, Macchiarelli, Bondioli'' (2010), [http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0009177 Skeletal remains..do not support]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Celtic traditions====
According to [[Julius Caesar]], the ancient [[Celts]] practiced the burning alive of humans in a number of settings. For example, in Book 6, chapter 16, he writes of the Druidic sacrifice of criminals within huge [[Wicker man|wicker frames shaped as men]]:
{{quote|Others have figures of vast size, the limbs of which formed of [[Salix viminalis|osiers]] they fill with living men, which being set on fire, the men perish enveloped in the flames. They consider that the [[oblation]] of such as have been taken in theft, or in robbery, or any other offence, is more acceptable to the immortal gods; but when a supply of that class is wanting, they have recourse to the oblation of even the innocent.}}

Slightly later, in Book 6, chapter 19, Caesar also says the Celts perform, on the occasion of death of great men, the funeral sacrifice on the pyre of living [[slaves]] and dependants ascertained to have been "beloved by them". Earlier on, in Book 1, chapter 4, he relates of the conspiracy of the nobleman [[Orgetorix]], charged by the Celts for having planned a ''coup d'état'', for which the customary penalty would be burning to death. It is said Orgetorix committed suicide to avoid that fate.&lt;ref&gt;''Julius Caesar, McDevitt, Bohn'' (1851) '''On penalty for conspiracy''', [https://books.google.com/books?hl=no&amp;id=7FsIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA4 p. 4] '''On criminals in large wicker frames''', [https://books.google.com/books?hl=no&amp;id=7FsIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA149 p. 149] '''On funeral human sacrifice''', [https://books.google.com/books?hl=no&amp;id=7FsIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=P150 pp.&amp;nbsp;150–151]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human sacrifice around the Eastern Baltic===
Throughout the 12th–14th centuries, a number of non-Christian peoples living around the Eastern [[Baltic Sea]], such as [[Old Prussians]] and [[Lithuanians]] were charged by Christian writers with performing human sacrifice. For example, [[Pope Gregory IX]] issued a [[papal bull]] denouncing an alleged practice among the Prussians, that girls were dressed in fresh flowers and wreaths and were then burned alive as offerings to evil spirits.&lt;ref&gt;This case, and a number of others in ''Pluskowski'' (2013), pp.[https://books.google.com/books?id=-8NykshHHesC&amp;pg=PA77 77–78]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian states===
[[File:Filip2 albigensti.jpg|thumb|The burning of the [[Catharism|Cathar]] heretics]]

====Eastern Roman Empire====
Under 6th-century emperor [[Justinian I]], the death penalty had been decreed for impenitent [[Manicheans]], but a specific punishment was not made explicit. By the 7th century, however, those found guilty of "dualist heresy" could risk being burned at the stake.&lt;ref&gt;''Hamilton, Hamilton, Stoyanov'' (1998), [https://books.google.com/books?id=uH-8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA13 p. 13, footnote 42]&lt;/ref&gt; Those found guilty of performing magical rites, and corrupting sacred objects in the process, might face death by burning, as evidenced in a 7th-century case.&lt;ref&gt;''Haldon'' (1997), [https://books.google.com/books?id=pSHmT1G_5T0C&amp;pg=PA333 p. 333, footnote 22]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 10th century AD, the Byzantines instituted death by burning for [[parricides]], i.e. those who had killed their own relatives, replacing the older punishment of ''[[poena cullei]]'', the stuffing of the convict in a leather sack along with a rooster, a viper, a dog and a monkey, and then throwing the sack into the sea.&lt;ref&gt;''Trenchard-Smith, Turner'' (2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=2ombkgpGt_AC&amp;pg=PA48 p. 48, footnote 58]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medieval Inquisition and the burning of heretics====
[[File:Templars Burning.jpg|left|thumb|Burning of the [[Knights Templar]], 1314]]

Civil authorities burned persons judged to be [[Heresy|heretics]] under the [[medieval]] [[Inquisition]].  Burning heretics had become customary practice in the latter half of the twelfth century in continental Europe, and death by burning became ''statutory'' punishment from the early 13th century. Death by burning for heretics was made positive law by [[Pedro II of Aragon]] in 1197. In 1224, [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], made burning a legal alternative, and in 1238, it became the principal punishment in the Empire. In Sicily, the punishment was made law in 1231, whereas in France, [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] made it binding law in 1270.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/folkwaysastudys01sumngoog|title=Folkways|first=William Graham|last=Sumner|date=26 November 1979|publisher=New York : Arno Press|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As England in the 15th century grew weary of the teachings of [[John Wycliffe]] and the [[Lollards]], kings, priests, and parliaments reacted with fire. In 1401, Parliament passed the [[De heretico comburendo]] act, which can be loosely translated as "Regarding the burning of heretics." Lollard persecution would continue for over a hundred years in England. The [[Fire and Faggot Parliament]] met in May 1414 at [[Grey Friars Priory]] in [[Leicester]] to lay out the notorious [[Suppression of Heresy Act 1414]], enabling the burning of heretics by making the crime enforceable by the [[Justices of the peace]]. [[John Oldcastle]], a prominent Lollard leader, was not saved from the gallows by his old friend [[Henry V of England|King Henry V]]. Oldcastle was hanged and his gallows burned in 1417. [[Jan Hus]] was burned at the stake after being accused at the Roman Catholic [[Council of Constance]] (1414–18) of heresy. The ecumenical council also decreed that the remains of [[John Wycliffe]], dead for 30 years, should be exhumed and burned. (This [[posthumous execution]] was carried out in 1428.)

====Burnings of Jews====
[[File:Jews burned to death in Strasbourg Feb. 14 1349 during the Black Death.jpg|thumb|Jews burned to death in the Strasbourg massacre]]

Several incidents are recorded of massacres on Jews from the 12th through 16th centuries in which they were burned alive, often on account of the [[blood libel]]. In 1171 in [[Blois]], for example, 51 Jews were burned alive (the entire adult community). In 1191, King [[Philip Augustus]] ordered around 100 Jews burnt alive.&lt;ref&gt;Both incidents in ''Weiss'' (2004), [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=oJOvpkHg7msC |page=104 }} p. 104]&lt;/ref&gt; That Jews purportedly performed [[host desecration]] also led to mass burnings; In 1243 in [[Beelitz]], the entire Jewish community was burnt alive, and in 1510 in Berlin, some 26 Jews were burnt alive for the same crime.&lt;ref&gt;''Prager, Telushkin'' (2007), [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=VK0llzUqQ2YC |page=87 }} p. 87]&lt;/ref&gt; During the "[[Black Death]]" in the mid-14th century a spate of large-scale [[Black Death Jewish persecutions|massacres]] occurred. One libel was that the Jews had [[well poisoning|poisoned the wells]]. In 1349, as panic grew along with the increasing death toll from the plague, general massacres, but also specifically mass burnings, began to occur. Six hundred (600) Jews were burnt alive in [[Basel]] alone. A large mass burning occurred in [[Strasbourg]], where several hundred Jews were burnt alive in what became known as the [[Strasbourg massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;''Kantor'' (2005)  [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=6uK5pa3R4d8C |page=203 |title=Codex Judaica: Chronological Index of Jewish History, Covering 5,764 Years of Biblical, Talmudic &amp; Post-Talmudic History }} p. 203]&lt;/ref&gt;

A Jewish male, Johannes Pfefferkorn, met a particularly gruesome death in 1514 in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]]. He had been charged with a number of crimes, such as having impersonated a priest for twenty years, performed [[host desecration]], stolen Christian children to be tortured and killed by other Jews, poisoning 13 people and poisoning wells. He was lashed to a pillar in such a way that he could run about it. Then, a ring of glowing coal was made around him, a fiery ring that was gradually pushed ever closer to him, until he was roasted to death.&lt;ref&gt;''Bülau'' (1860), [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=z4YBAAAAQAAJ |page=423 }} pp. 423–424]&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Lepers' Plot of 1321====
Not only Jews could be victims of mass hysteria on charges like that of poisoning wells. This particular charge, well-poisoning, was the basis for a [[1321 leper scare|large scale hunt of lepers in 1321 France]]. In the spring of 1321, in [[Périgueux]], people became convinced that the local lepers had poisoned the wells, causing ill-health among the normal populace. The lepers were rounded up and burned alive. The action against the lepers didn't stay local, though, but had repercussions throughout France, not least because [[Philip V of France|King Philip V]] issued an order to arrest all lepers, those found guilty to be burnt alive. Jews became tangentially included as well; at [[Chinon]] alone, 160 Jews were burnt alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Richards'' (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=saXbAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA161 pp. 161–163]&lt;/ref&gt; All in all, around 5000 lepers and Jews are recorded in one tradition to have been killed during the Lepers' Plot hysteria.&lt;ref&gt;''John, Pope'' (2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=-_fnv5pmECsC&amp;pg=PA177 p. 177]&lt;/ref&gt;

The charge of the lepers' plot was not wholly confined to France; existent records from England show that on [[Jersey]] the same year, at least one family of lepers were burnt alive for having poisoned others.&lt;ref&gt;''Smirke'' (1865), [https://books.google.com/books?id=G4dbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA326 pp. 326–331]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spanish Inquisition against Moriscos and Marranos====
[[File:Witch-scene4.JPG|thumb|The burning of a 16th-century Dutch [[Anabaptist]], Anneken Hendriks, who was charged with heresy.]]
The [[Spanish Inquisition]] was established in 1478, with the aim of preserving Catholic orthodoxy; some of its principal targets were "[[Marranos]]", formally converted Jews thought to have relapsed into Judaism, or the [[Moriscos]], formally converted Muslims thought to have relapsed into Islam. The public executions of the Spanish Inquisition were called [[autos-da-fé]]; convicts were "released" (handed over) to secular authorities in order to be burnt.

Estimates of how many were executed on behest of the Spanish Inquisition have been offered from early on; historian [[Hernando del Pulgar]] (1436–c. 1492) estimated that 2000 people were burned at the stake between 1478 and 1490.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Kamen]], ''The Spanish Inquisition: A Historical Revision.'', p. 62, (Yale University Press, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates range from 30,000 to 50,000 burnt at the stake (alive or not) at the behest of the Spanish Inquisition during its 300 years of activity have previously been given and are still to be found in popular books.&lt;ref&gt;On mercy, and 50,000 estimate, for Marranos ''Telchin'' (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K7QH76_HdIC&amp;pg=PA41 p. 41] On 30,000 estimate of Marranos ''killed'', see ''Pasachoff, Littman'' (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=z4eaj09hscAC&amp;pg=PA151 p. 151]&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1481, in what is said to be the first auto-da-fé, six Marranos were burnt alive in [[Seville]]. In November 1481, 298 Marranos were burnt publicly at the same place, their property confiscated by the Church.&lt;ref&gt;These information are included in the appendix, "Historical Notes" to the novel "The Hidden Scroll" ''Anouchi'' (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=pbP-yZL00eAC&amp;pg=PT471 p. 471]&lt;/ref&gt; Not all Maranos executed by being burnt at the stake seem to have been burnt alive. If the Jew "confessed his heresy", the Church would show mercy, and he would be strangled prior to the burning. Autos-da-fé against Maranos extended beyond the Spanish heartland. In Sicily, in 1511–15, 79 were burnt at the stake, while from 1511 to 1560, 441 Maranos were condemned to be burned alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Cipolla'' (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Sggys-_O-2cC&amp;pg=PA91 p. 91]&lt;/ref&gt; In Spanish American colonies, autos-da-fé were held as well. For example, in 1664, a man and his wife were burned alive in [[Río de la Plata]], and in 1699, a Jew was burnt alive in [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref&gt;''Stillman, Zucker'' (1993) '''On the Río de la Plata incident''', see ''Matilde Gini de Barnatan'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=yq7VUKWz5dwC&amp;pg=PA144 p. 144], '''on Mexico City incident''', see ''Eva Alexandra Uchmany'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=yq7VUKWz5dwC&amp;pg=PA128 p. 128]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1535, five Moriscos were burned at the stake on [[Majorca]], the images of a further four were also [[Burn in effigy|burnt in effigy]], since the actual individuals had managed to flee. During the 1540s, some 232 Moriscos were paraded in autos-da-fé in [[Zaragoza]]; five of those were burnt at the stake.&lt;ref&gt;''Carr'' (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=netlOtzI6R8C&amp;pg=PA101 p. 101]&lt;/ref&gt; The claim that out of 917 Moriscos appearing in autos of the Inquisition in [[Granada]] between 1550–95, just 20 were executed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/spanishinquisition2|title=The Spanish Inquisition A Historical Revision FOURTH EDITION By Henry Kamen|first=|last=Henry Kamen|publisher=|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; seems at odds with the English government's state papers which claim that, while at war with Spain, they received a report from Seville of 17 June 1593 that over 70 of the richest men of Granada were burnt.&lt;ref&gt;List And Analysis of State Papers Foreign, Jul 1593 – Dec 1594. v.5; p.444 (595): by Public Record Office ({{ISBN|9780114402181}})&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 1728 as many as 45 Moriscos were recorded burned for heresy.&lt;ref&gt;''Matar'' (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=z2QRd_rbWu8C&amp;pg=PR21 p. xxi]&lt;/ref&gt; In the May 1691 "bonfire of the Jews", Rafael Valls, Rafael Benito Terongi and [[Caterina Tarongí|Catalina Terongi]] were burned alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/07/world/europe/07iht-spain07.html|title=In Majorca, Atoning for the Sins of 1691|first=Doreen|last=Carvajal|publisher=|accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nachman Seltzer,''Incredible'', Shaar Press, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

====Portuguese Inquisition at Goa====
In 1560, the [[Portuguese Inquisition]] opened offices in the Indian colony [[Goa]], known as [[Goa Inquisition]]. Its aim was to protect Catholic orthodoxy among new converts to Christianity, and retain hold on the old, particularly against "Judaizing" deviancy. From the 17th century, Europeans were shocked at the tales of how brutal and extensive the activities of the Inquisition were.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} What modern scholars have established, is that some 4046 individuals in the time 1560–1773 received some sort of punishment from the Portuguese Inquisition, whereof 121 persons were condemned to be burned alive, of those 57 who actually suffered that fate, while the rest escaped it, and were burnt in effigy, instead.&lt;ref&gt;Already noted originally by ''Hunter'' (1886), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vdv7AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA253 pp. 253–254], see also ''Salomon, Sassoon, Saraiva'' (2001), pp. 345–347&lt;/ref&gt; For the Portuguese Inquisition in total, not just at Goa, modern estimates of persons actually executed on its behest is about 1200, whether burnt alive or not.&lt;ref&gt;See extensive table at [[Portuguese Inquisition]], ''de Almeida'' (1923), in particular p. 442&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legislation concerning "crimes against nature"====
[[File:Burning of Sodomites.jpg|left|thumb|Burning of two [[homosexuals]] at the stake outside [[Zürich]], 1482 ([[Spiezer Schilling]])]]

From the 12th to the 18th centuries, various European authorities legislated (and held judicial proceedings) against sexual crimes such as [[sodomy]] or [[bestiality]]; often, the prescribed punishment was that of death by burning. Many scholars think that the first time death by burning appeared within explicit codes of law for the crime of sodomy was at the ecclesiastical 1120 [[Council of Nablus]] in the [[Crusaders|crusader]] [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. Here, if public repentance were done, the death penalty might be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;See for '''first time''' ''Heng'' (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=pRXvHbNLPQ0C&amp;pg=PA56 p. 56] on '''option of public repentance''' ''Puff, Bennett, Karras'' (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=QThLAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA387 p. 387]&lt;/ref&gt; In Spain, the earliest records for executions for the crime of sodomy are from the 13th–14th centuries, and it is noted there that the preferred mode of execution was death by burning. The Partidas of King Alfonso "El Sabio" condemned sodomites to be castrated and hung upside down to die from the bleeding, following the old testament phrase "their blood shall be upon them".&lt;ref&gt;''Pickett'' (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=XH-SMq-NKf0C&amp;pg=PA178 p. 178]&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Geneva]], the first recorded burning of sodomites occurred in 1555, and up to 1678, some two dozen met the same fate. In [[Venice]], the first burning took place in 1492, and a monk was burnt as late as 1771.&lt;ref&gt;'''On Geneva and Venice''', see ''Coward, Dynes, Donaldson'' (1992), [https://books.google.com/books?id=y8_Ya2s3zN8C&amp;pg=PA36 p. 36]&lt;/ref&gt; The last case in France where two men were condemned by court to be burned alive for engaging in consensual homosexual sex was in 1750 (although, it seems, they were actually strangled prior to being burned). The last case in France where a man was condemned to be burned for a murderous rape of a boy occurred in 1784.&lt;ref&gt;''Crompton'' (2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=TfBYd9xVaXcC&amp;pg=PA450 p. 450]&lt;/ref&gt;

Crackdowns and the public burning of a couple of homosexuals might lead to local panic, and persons thus inclined fleeing from the place. The traveller [[William Lithgow (traveller and author)|William Lithgow]] witnessed such a dynamic when he visited [[Malta]] in 1616 :{{quote|''The fifth day of my staying here, I saw a Spanish soldier and a Maltezen boy burnt in ashes, for the public profession of sodomy; and long before night, there were above an hundred bardassoes, whorish boys, that fled away to Sicily in a galliot, for fear of fire; but never one bugeron stirred, being few or none there free of it.''&lt;ref&gt;''Lithgow'' (1814), [https://books.google.com/books?id=whMwAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA305 p. 305]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Augsburg-Perlachkirche.jpg|thumb|Perlachturm with [[St. Peter am Perlach|St.&amp;nbsp;Peter by Perlach]]]]
The actual punishment meted out to, for example, [[pederasts]] could differ according to status. While both in 1532 and 1409 [[Augsburg]] two men were burned alive for their offenses, a rather different procedure was meted out to four ''clerics'' in the 1409 case guilty of the same offence: Instead of being burnt alive, they were locked into a wooden casket that was hung up in the [[Perlachturm]] and they starved to death in that manner.&lt;ref&gt;''Osenbrüggen'' (1860), [https://books.google.com/books?id=X9NCAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA290 p. 290]&lt;/ref&gt;

====The 1532 penal code of Charles V====
In 1532, Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] promulgated his penal code [[Constitutio Criminalis Carolina]]. A number of crimes were punishable with death by burning, such as coin forgery, arson, and sexual acts "contrary to nature".&lt;ref&gt;specified as men or women found guilty of same-sex sexual behaviour or guilty of having had sex with animals.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, those guilty of aggravated theft of sacred objects from a church could be condemned to be burnt alive.&lt;ref&gt;As late as in 1730 [[Poznań|Posen]], a church robber had his right hand cut off, and the stump covered in pitch. Then, the pitch was ignited, and the person was burnt alive on a pyre as well. ''Oehlschlaeger'' (1866), [https://books.google.com/books?id=F41aAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA55 p. 55]&lt;/ref&gt; Only those found guilty of ''malevolent'' witchcraft&lt;ref&gt;No fixed penalty was placed on performing acts of witchcraft that had caused no harm&lt;/ref&gt; could be punished by death by fire.&lt;ref&gt;All in ''Koch'' (1824) '''Coin forgers''': [https://books.google.com/books?id=nBZDAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA52 Article 111, p. 52], '''Malevolent witchcraft''': [https://books.google.com/books?id=nBZDAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA55 Article 109, p. 55] '''Sexual acts contrary to nature''':[https://books.google.com/books?id=nBZDAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA58 Article 116, p. 58], '''Arson''':[https://books.google.com/books?id=nBZDAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA61 Article 125, p. 61], '''Theft of sacred objects''': [https://books.google.com/books?id=nBZDAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA84 Article 172, p. 84]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====The last burnings from 1804 and 1813=====
According to the jurist {{Interlanguage link multi|Eduard Osenbrüggen|de}}, the last case he knew of where a person had been judicially burned alive on account of arson in Germany happened in 1804, in [[:de:Hötzelsroda|Hötzelsroda]], close by [[Eisenach]].&lt;ref&gt;''Osenbrüggen'' (1854), [https://books.google.com/books?id=C-4PAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA21 p. 21]  For a similar, more modern assessment, as well as locating the incident to Hötzelsroda, see Dietze (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; The manner in which Johannes Thomas&lt;ref&gt;Last name "Mothas" used in extended account in ''Bischoff, Hitzig'' (1832), real name "Thomas" given in ''Herden'' (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=wVNuf9VEhGkC&amp;pg=PA89 p. 89]&lt;/ref&gt; was executed on 13 July that year is described as follows: Some feet above the actual pyre, attached to a stake, a wooden chamber had been constructed, into which the delinquent was placed. Pipes or chimneys, filled with sulphuric material led up to the chamber, and that was first lit, so that Thomas died from inhaling the sulphuric smoke, rather than being strictly burnt alive, before his body was consumed by the general fire. Some 20,000 people had gathered to watch Thomas' execution.&lt;ref&gt;On the manner of execution according to the original account, see ''Bischoff, Hitzig'' (1832), [https://books.google.com/books?id=88dCAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA178 p. 178] Contemporary newspaper notice, ''Hübner'' (1804), [https://books.google.com/books?id=jyVEAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PT964 p. 760, column 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Thomas is regarded as the last to have been actually executed by means of fire (in this case, through suffocation), the couple Johann Christoph Peter Horst and his lover [[Friederike Luise Delitz|Friederike Louise Christiane Delitz]], who had made a career of robberies in the confusion made by their acts of arson, were condemned to be burnt alive in Berlin 28 May 1813. They were, however, according to [[Gustav Radbruch]], secretly strangled just prior to being burnt, namely when their arms and legs were tied fast to the stake.&lt;ref&gt;'''Original account''' by investigating police officer Heinrich L. Hermann, ''Hermann'' (1818) '''Gustav Rudbrach's mention''' ''Rudbrach'' (1992), [https://books.google.com/books?id=3JOVbGPdrjYC&amp;pg=PA247 p. 247] '''Precise moment of strangulation''' ''Gräff'' (1834), [https://books.google.com/books?id=v8ZDAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA56 p. 56] '''Modern newspaper article''' ''Springer'' (2008), [http://www.yasni.de/ext.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.welt.de%2Fregionales%2Fberlin%2Farticle2489746%2FDas-letzte-Feuer.html&amp;name=Christiane+Delitz&amp;cat=news&amp;showads=1 Das Letzte Feuer]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although these two cases are the last where execution by burning might be said to have been ''carried out'' in some degree, Eduard Osenbrüggen mentions that ''verdicts'' to be burned alive were given in several cases in different German states afterwards, such as in cases from 1814, 1821, 1823, 1829 and finally in a case from 1835.&lt;ref&gt;''Osenbrüggen'' (1854), [https://books.google.com/books?id=C-4PAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA21 pp. 21–22, footnote 83]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Witch-hunts====
[[File:Wickiana5.jpg|thumb|Burning of three witches in [[Baden, Switzerland|Baden]] (1585), painted by [[Johann Jakob Wick]]]]

Burning was used by Christians during the [[Witch-hunt#Early Modern Europe|witch-hunts of Europe]]. The penal code known as the [[Constitutio Criminalis Carolina]] (1532) decreed that sorcery throughout the [[Holy Roman Empire]] should be treated as a criminal offence, and if it purported to inflict injury upon any person the witch was to be burnt at the stake. In 1572, [[Augustus, Elector of Saxony]] imposed the penalty of burning for witchcraft of every kind, including simple fortunetelling.&lt;ref&gt;''Thurston'' (1912) [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15674a.htm%20New%20Advent Witchcraft], 2010 web resource. {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the latter half of the 18th century, the number of "[[Nine million victims|nine million witches]] burned in Europe" has been bandied about in popular accounts and media, but has never had a following among specialist researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Professional researchers in the 19th, and early 20th century tended to ''refuse'' giving any quantification at all but, when pushed, typically landed on about 100,000 to 1 million victims&lt;/ref&gt; Today, based on meticulous study of trial records, ecclesiastical and inquisitorial registers and so on, as well as on the utilization of modern statistical methods, the specialist research community on witchcraft has reached an agreement for roughly 40,000–50,000 people executed for witchcraft in Europe in total,&lt;ref&gt;A lowest bound of 30,000 and a highest upper bound of 100,000 still within acceptability, but with a minority of professional researchers supporting either of them.&lt;/ref&gt; and by no means all of them executed by being burned alive. Furthermore, it is solidly established that the peak period of witch-hunts was the century 1550–1650, with a slow increase preceding it, from the 15th century onward, as well as a sharp drop following it, with "witch-hunts" having basically fizzled out by the first half of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Wolfgang Behringer]] (1998) on the history of witch-counting, and on specialist academic consensus, [http://www.historicum.net/themen/hexenforschung/thementexte/rezeption/art/Neun_Millionen/html/ca/0e43e9dea3a4144c50997da6aa74bd34/ Neun Millionen Hexen] Originally published in GWU 49 (1998) pp. 664–685, web publication 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

====Denmark====
In Denmark, after the [[Protestant Reformation|1536 reformation]], [[Christian IV of Denmark]] (r. 1588–1648) encouraged the practice of burning witches, in particular by the law against witchcraft in 1617. In [[Jutland]], the mainland part of Denmark,  more than half the recorded cases of witchcraft in the 16th and 17th centuries occurred after 1617.  Rough estimates says about a thousand persons were executed due to convictions for [[witchcraft]] in the 1500–1600s, but it is not wholly clear if all of the transgressors were burned to death.&lt;ref&gt;For Denmark, see for example, ''Burns'' (2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qr6_q-chR6MC&amp;pg=PA64 pp. 64–65]&lt;/ref&gt;

====England====
[[Mary I of England|Mary I]] ordered hundreds of [[Protestants]] burnt at the stake during her reign (1553–58) in what would be known as the "[[List of Protestant martyrs of the English Reformation#List of Marian Martyrs|Marian Persecutions]]" earning her the epithet of 'Bloody' Mary.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Foxe]] is particularly mentioned in being assiduous at documenting such cases of persecutions. See, ''Miller'' (1972), [https://books.google.com/books?id=3S89AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA72 p. 72]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those martyred by Mary and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] are listed in ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|Actes and Monuments]]'', written by Foxe in 1563 and 1570.
[[Edward Wightman]], a Baptist from [[Burton on Trent]], was the last person burned at the stake for [[heresy]] in England in [[Lichfield|Lichfield, Staffordshire]] on 11 April 1612.&lt;ref&gt;For claim of being last heretic burned at the stake, see for example, ''Durso'' (2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=68jfRYQo3zsC&amp;pg=PA29 p. 29]&lt;/ref&gt; Although cases can be found of burning heretics in the 16th and 17th centuries England, that penalty for heretics was historically relatively new. For example, it did not exist in 14th century England, and when the bishops in England petitioned King [[Richard II]] to institute death by burning for heretics in 1397, he flatly refused, and no one was burnt for heresy during his reign.&lt;ref&gt;''Sayles'' (1971) [https://books.google.com/books?id=HVQLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA31 p. 31]&lt;/ref&gt; Just one year after his death, however, in 1401, [[William Sawtrey]] was burnt alive for heresy.&lt;ref&gt;''Richards'' (1812), [https://books.google.com/books?id=JRkwAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1190 p. 1190]&lt;/ref&gt; Death by burning for heresy was formally abolished by King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in 1676.&lt;ref&gt;''Willis-Bund'' (1982), [https://books.google.com/books?id=2gA9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA95 p. 95]&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional punishment for women found guilty of treason was to be [[Burning of women in England|burned at the stake]], where they did not need to be publicly displayed naked, whereas men were [[hanged, drawn and quartered]]. The jurist [[William Blackstone]] argued as follows for the differential punishment of females vs. males:
{{quote|For as the decency due to sex forbids the exposing and public mangling of their bodies, their sentence (which is to the full as terrible to sensation as the other) is to be drawn to the gallows and there be burned alive&lt;ref&gt;Direct citation in ''McLynn'' (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ylf8t7uSGJEC&amp;pg=PA122 p. 122]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, as described in Camille Naish's "Death Comes to the Maiden", in practice, the woman's shift would burn away at the beginning, and she would be left naked anyway.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} There were two types of treason, [[high treason]] for crimes against the sovereign, and [[petty treason]] for the murder of one's lawful superior, including that of a husband by his wife. Commenting on the 18th century execution practice, Frank McLynn says that most convicts condemned to burning were not burnt alive, and that the executioners made sure the women were dead before consigning them to the flames.&lt;ref&gt;''McLynn'' (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ylf8t7uSGJEC&amp;pg=PA122 p. 122]&lt;/ref&gt;

The last to have been condemned to death for "petty treason" was Mary Bailey, whose body was burned in 1784. The last woman to be convicted for "high treason", and have her body burnt, in this case for the crime of coin forgery, was [[Catherine Murphy (counterfeiter)|Catherine Murphy]] in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;Comprehensive list at capitalpunishmentuk.org, [http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/burning.html Burning at the stake].&lt;/ref&gt; The last case where a woman was actually burnt alive in England is that of [[Catherine Hayes (murderer)|Catherine Hayes]] in 1726, for the murder of her husband. In this case, one account says this happened because the executioner accidentally set fire to the pyre before he had hanged Hayes properly.&lt;ref&gt;''O'Shea'' (1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=YvdKyEJo0osC&amp;pg=PA3 p. 3]&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Rictor Norton]] has assembled a number of contemporary newspaper reports on the actual death of Mrs. Hayes, internally somewhat divergent. The following excerpt is one example: {{quote|The fuel being placed round her, and lighted with a torch, she begg’d for the sake of Jesus, to be strangled first: whereupon the Executioner drew tight the halter, but the flame coming to his hand in the space of a second, he let it go, when she gave three dreadful shrieks; but the flames taking her on all sides, she was heard no more; and the Executioner throwing a piece of timber into the Fire, it broke her skull, when her brains came plentifully out; and in about an hour more she was entirely reduced to ashes.&lt;ref&gt;See website article, [http://rictornorton.co.uk/grubstreet/hayes.htm The Case of Catherine Hayes] at [http://rictornorton.co.uk/ rictornorton.co.uk] See also the detailed synthesis at capitalpunishmentuk.org, [http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/hayes.html Catherine Hayes burnt for Petty Treason]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Scotland====
[[James VI of Scotland]] (later [[James I of England]]) shared the Danish king's interest in witch trials. This special interest of the king resulted in the [[North Berwick witch trials]], which led more than seventy people to be accused of witchcraft in [[Scotland]] due to inclement weather. James sailed in 1590 to Denmark to meet his betrothed, [[Anne of Denmark]], who, ironically, is believed by some to have secretly converted to Roman Catholicism herself from Lutheranism around 1598, although historians are divided on whether she ever was received into the Roman Catholic faith.&lt;ref&gt;"Some time in the 1590s, Anne became a Roman Catholic." ''Wilson'' (1963), p. 95 "Some time after 1600, but well before March 1603, Queen Anne was received into the Catholic Church in a secret chamber in the royal palace" ''Fraser'' (1997), p. 15  "The Queen ... [converted] from her native Lutheranism to a discreet, but still politically embarrassing Catholicism which alienated many ministers of the Kirk" ''Croft'' (2003), pp. 24–25 "Catholic foreign ambassadors—who would surely have welcomed such a situation—were certain that the Queen was beyond their reach. 'She is a Lutheran', concluded the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] envoy Nicolo Molin in 1606." ''Stewart'' (2003), p. 182 "In 1602 a report appeared, claiming that Anne ... had converted to the Catholic faith some years before. The author of this report, the Scottish [[Jesuit]] [[Robert Abercromby (missionary)|Robert Abercromby]], testified that James had received his wife's desertion with equanimity, commenting, 'Well, wife, if you cannot live without this sort of thing, do your best to keep things as quiet as possible.' Anne would, indeed, keep her religious beliefs as quiet as possible: for the remainder of her life—even after her death—they remained obfuscated." ''Hogge'' (2005), pp. 303–304&lt;/ref&gt;

The last to be executed as a witch in Scotland was [[Janet Horne]] in 1727, condemned to death for using her own daughter as a flying horse in order to travel. Janet Horne was burnt alive in a tar barrel.&lt;ref&gt;''Pavlac'' (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=KCjlptFEMZsC&amp;pg=PA145 p. 145]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ireland====
[[Petronilla de Meath]] (c. 1300–1324) was the maidservant of Dame [[Alice Kyteler]], a 14th-century [[Hiberno-Norman]] noblewoman. After the death of Kyteler's fourth husband, the widow was accused of practicing [[witchcraft]] and Petronilla of being her accomplice. Petronilla was tortured and forced to proclaim that she and Kyteler were guilty of witchcraft. Petronilla was then flogged and eventually burnt at the stake on 3 November 1324, in [[Kilkenny]], Ireland.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;''de Ledrede, Wright'' (1843)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de ''Ledrede, Davidson, Ward'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Hers was the first known case in the history of the [[British Isles]] of death by fire for the crime of [[heresy]]. Kyteler was charged by the [[Bishop of Ossory]], Richard de Ledrede, with a wide slate of crimes, from [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] and [[demonism]] to the murders of several husbands. She was accused of having illegally acquired her wealth through [[witchcraft]], which accusations came principally from her stepchildren, the children of her late husbands by their previous marriages. The trial predated any formal witchcraft statute in Ireland, thus relying on [[canon law|ecclesiastical law]] (which treated witchcraft as [[heresy]]) rather than [[English common law]] (which treated it as a [[felony]]). Under torture, Petronilla claimed she and her mistress applied a magical ointment to a wooden beam, which enabled both women to fly. She was then forced to proclaim publicly that Lady Alice and her followers were guilty of witchcraft.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Some were convicted and whipped, but others, Petronilla included, were [[Burning at the stake|burnt at the stake]]. With the help of relatives, Alice Kyteler fled, taking with her Petronilla's daughter, Basilia.&lt;ref&gt;Story of flight in contemporary chronicle ''Gilbert'' (2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=R_w-CZ0eXnYC&amp;pg=PR134 p. cxxxiv]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895, [[Bridget Cleary]] (née Boland), a [[County Tipperary]] woman, was burnt by her husband and others, the stated motive for the crime being the belief that the real Bridget had been abducted by [[fairy|fairies]] with a [[changeling]] left in her place. Her husband claimed to have slain only the changeling. The gruesome nature of the case prompted extensive press coverage. The trial was closely followed by newspapers in both Ireland and Britain.&lt;ref name="McCullough-NYT"&gt;''McCullough'' (2000), [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE4D91E3AF93BA35753C1A9669C8B63 The Fairy Defense]&lt;/ref&gt; As one reviewer commented, nobody, with the possible exception of the presiding judge, thought it was an ordinary murder case.&lt;ref name="McCullough-NYT"/&gt;

===Slavery and colonialism in the Americas===
[[File:Execution of Mariana de Carabajal.jpg|thumb|Execution of [[Francisca Nuñez de Carabajal|Mariana de Carabajal]] (converted Jew), Mexico City, 1601]]

====North America====
[[File:Modocs Scalping and Torturing Prisoners.jpg|thumb|Native Americans scalping and roasting their prisoners, published in 1873]]
Indigenous North Americans often used burning as a form of execution, against members of other tribes or white settlers during the 18th and 19th centuries. Roasting over a slow fire was a customary method.&lt;ref&gt;''Scott'' (1940) p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; {See [[Captives in American Indian Wars]]}

In [[Massachusetts]], there are two known cases of burning at the stake. First, in 1681, a slave named Maria tried to kill her owner by setting his house on fire. She was convicted of arson and burned at the stake in [[Roxbury, Massachusetts|Roxbury]].&lt;ref name="Maria, Burned at the Stake"&gt;CelebrateBoston.com (2014), [http://www.celebrateboston.com/crime/puritan-burned-at-stake-maria.htm "Maria, Burned at the Stake"]&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently, a slave named Jack, convicted in a separate arson case, was hanged at a nearby gallows, and after death his body was thrown into the fire with that of Maria. Second, in 1755, a group of slaves had conspired and killed their owner, with servants Mark and Phillis executed for his murder. Mark was hanged and his body [[gibbet]]ed, and Phillis burned at the stake, at [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]].&lt;ref name="Mark and Phillis Executions"&gt;[http://www.celebrateboston.com/crime/puritan-mark-and-phillis-executions.htm Mark and Phillis Executions] (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Montreal]], then part of [[New France]], [[Marie-Joseph Angélique]], a black slave, was sentenced to being burned alive for an arson which destroyed 45 homes and a hospital in 1734. The sentence was commuted on appeal to burning after death by stangulation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marie-Joseph Angélique]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=June 2018}}

In New York, several burnings at the stake are recorded, particularly following suspected slave revolt plots. In 1708, one woman was burnt and one man hanged. In the aftermath of the [[New York Slave Revolt of 1712]], 20 people were burnt (one of the leaders slowly roasted, before he died after 10 hours of torture&lt;ref&gt;''McManus'' (1973), [https://books.google.com/books?id=2H3S1OLtmagC&amp;pg=PA86 p. 86]&lt;/ref&gt;) and during the alleged [[New York Conspiracy of 1741|slave conspiracy of 1741]], at least 13 slaves were burnt at the stake.&lt;ref&gt;''Hoey'' (1974),[http://www.americanheritage.com/content/terror-new-york--1741 Terror in New York–1741]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bartolomé de las Casas]], a 16th-century eyewitness to the brutal subjugation of the Native Americans by the Spanish conquistadores, has left a particularly harrowing description of how roasting alive was a favoured technique of repression:&lt;ref&gt;''De las Casas'' (1974), [https://books.google.com/books?id=krP0qAvXK4QC&amp;pg=PA34 pp. 34–35]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|They usually dealt with the chieftains and nobles in the following way: they made a grid of rods which they placed on forked sticks, then lashed the victims to the grid and lighted a smoldering fire underneath, so that little by little, as those captives screamed in despair and torment, their souls would leave them. I once saw this, when there were four or five nobles lashed on grids and burning; I seem even to recall that there were two or three pairs where others were burning, and because they uttered such loud screams that they disturbed the captain's sleep, he ordered them to be strangled. And the constable, who was worse than an executioner, did not want to obey that order (and I know the name of that constable and know his relatives in Seville), but instead put a stick over the victims' tongues, so they could not make a sound, and he stirred up the fire, but not too much, so that they roasted slowly, as he liked.}}

The last known burning by the Spanish Colonial government in Latin America was of Mariana de Castro, in [[Lima, Peru]] {{Why?|date=November 2013}} in February 1732.&lt;ref&gt;''Carvacho'' (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?hl=no&amp;id=P30WGMWwsqMC&amp;pg=PA62 p. 62] "y que habiendo llegado el caso de practicar lo determinado por el Consejo en auto de 4 de febrero de 1732, ... acordaron, después de revisar la causa de Mariana de Castro y lo determinado por la Suprema el 4 de febrero de 1732"&lt;/ref&gt;

====British West Indies====
In 1760, the slave rebellion known as [[Tacky's War]] broke out in [[Jamaica]]. Apparently, some of the defeated rebels were burned alive, while others were gibbeted alive, left to die of thirst and starvation.&lt;ref&gt;''Waddell'' (1863), [https://books.google.com/books?id=bt71nHmVezMC&amp;pg=PA19 p. 19]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1774, nine African slaves at [[Tobago]] were found complicit of murdering a white man. Eight of them had first their right arms chopped off, and were then burned alive bound to stakes, according to the report of an eyewitness.&lt;ref&gt;''Blake'' (1857), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z6lDAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA154 pp. 154–155]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dutch Suriname====
In 1855 the Dutch abolitionist and historian [[:nl:Julien Wolbers|Julien Wolbers]] spoke to the Anti Slavery Society in Amsterdam. Painting a dark picture of the condition of slaves in Suriname, he mentions in particular that as late as in 1853, just two years previously, "three Negroes were burnt alive".&lt;ref&gt;''Woblers'' (1855), [https://books.google.com/books?id=WqcNAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA205 p. 205]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek War of Independence===
The [[Greek War of Independence]] in the 1820s contained several instances of death by burning. When the Greeks in April 1821 captured a corvette near Hydra, the Greeks chose to roast to death the 57 Ottoman crew members. After the fall of [[Tripolitsa Massacre|Tripolitsa]] in September 1821, European officers were horrified to note that not only were Muslims suspected of hiding money being slowly roasted after having had their arms and legs cut off but, in one instance, three Muslim children were roasted over a fire while their parents were forced to watch. On their part, the Ottomans committed many similar acts; for example, in retaliation they gathered up Greeks in Constantinople, throwing several of them into huge ovens, baking them to death.&lt;ref&gt;[[William St Clair]], ''That Greece Might Still Be Free'' (2008) ''Hydra incident'', p. xxiv, ''those suspected of hiding money'', p. 45, ''the three Turkish children'', p. 77, ''baked in ovens'', p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic countries===

====Followers of a false claimant of prophethood====
The Arab chieftain [[Tulayha|Tulayha ibn Khuwaylid ibn Nawfal al-Asad]] set himself up as a prophet in AD 630. Tulayha had a strong following which was, however, soon quashed in the so-called [[Ridda Wars]]. He himself escaped, though, and later was reconverted to Islam, but many of his rebel followers were burnt to death; his mother chose to embrace the same fate.&lt;ref&gt;''Zurkhana, Houtsma'' (1987), [https://books.google.com/books?id=wpM3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA830 p. 830]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=Please refer to a trustworthy sources, such as Muslims' classical books|date=December 2016}}

====Catholic monks in 13th-century Tunis and Morocco====
A number of monks are said to have been burnt alive in [[Tunis]] and [[Morocco]] in the 13th century. In 1243, two English monks, Brothers Rodulph and Berengarius, after having secured the release of some 60 captives, were charged with being English spies, and were burnt alive on 9 September. In 1262, Brothers Patrick and William, again having freed captives, but also sought to proselytize among Muslims, were burnt alive in Morocco. In 1271, 11 Catholic monks were burnt alive in Tunis. Several other cases are reported.&lt;ref&gt;''Digby'' (1853), [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K06AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA342 pp. 342–345]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Converts to Christianity====

[[Apostasy in Islam|Apostasy]], i.e. the act of converting to another religion, was (and remains so in a few countries) punishable with death.
 
The French traveller [[Jean de Thevenot]], traveling the East in the 1650s, says: ''"Those that turn Christians, they burn alive, hanging a bag of Powder about their neck, and putting a [[Pitch (resin)|pitched]] Cap upon their Head."''&lt;ref&gt;''De Thevenot, Lovell'' (1687), [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=69&amp;id=6q9EAAAAcAAJ p. 69]&lt;/ref&gt; Travelling the same regions some 60 years earlier, [[Fynes Moryson]] writes:
{{quote|''A Turke forsaking his Fayth and a Christian speaking or doing anything against the law of [[Muhammad|Mahomett]] are burnt with fyer.''&lt;ref&gt;''Moryson, Hadfield'' (2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=fl6gkL5h6A0C&amp;pg=PA171 p. 171]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

(''NOTE:'' De Thevenot says Christians committing blasphemy against Islam were impaled, rather than burnt, if they do not convert to Islam.)

====Muslim heretics====

''[[Certain accursed ones of no significance]]'' is the term used by [[Taş Köprü Zade]] in the ''Şakaiki Numaniye'' to describe some members of the [[Hurufiyya]] who became intimate with the Sultan [[Mehmed II]] to the extent of initiating him as a follower. This alarmed members of the [[Ulema]], particularly Mahmut Paşa, who then consulted Mevlana Fahreddin. Fahreddin hid in the Sultan's palace and heard the [[Hurufi]]s propound their doctrines. Considering these heretical, he reviled them with curses. The [[Hurufi]]s fled to the Sultan, but Fahreddin's denunciation of them was so virulent that [[Mehmed II]] was unable to defend them. Farhreddin then took them in front of the [[Üç Şerefeli Mosque]], [[Edirne]], where he publicly condemned them to death. While preparing the fire for their execution, Fahreddin accidentally set fire to his beard. However the [[Hurufi]]s were burnt to death.

====Barbary States, 18th century====
[[John Braithwaite (author)|John Braithwaite]], staying in [[Morocco]] in the late 1720s, says that apostates from Islam would be burnt alive:
{{quote|''THOSE that can be proved after Circumcision to have revolted, are stripped quite naked, then anointed with Tallow, and with a Chain about the Body, brought to the Place of Execution, where they are burnt.''}}

Similarly, he notes that non-Muslims entering mosques or being blasphemous against Islam will be burnt, unless they convert to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;''Braithwaite''(1729)On apostates citation, see [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=366&amp;id=iJA_AAAAMAAJ p. 366], on the conditional fate of non-Muslims, see [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=355&amp;id=iJA_AAAAMAAJ p. 355]&lt;/ref&gt; The chaplain for the English in [[Algiers]] at the same time, [[Thomas Shaw (divine and traveller)|Thomas Shaw]], wrote that whenever capital crimes were committed either by Christian slaves or Jews, the Christian or Jew was to be burnt alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Shaw'' (1757), [https://books.google.com/books?id=0c4GAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA253 p. 253]&lt;/ref&gt; Several generations later, in Morocco in 1772, a Jewish interpreter to the British, and a merchant in his own right, sought from the [[Mohammed ben Abdallah|Emperor of Morocco]] restitution for some goods confiscated, and was burnt alive for his impertinence. His widow made her woes clear in a letter to the British.&lt;ref&gt;''Stillman'' (1979), [https://books.google.com/books?id=bFN2ismyhEYC&amp;pg=PA310 pp. 310–311]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1792 in [[Ifrane]], Morocco, 50 Jews preferred to be burned alive, rather than convert to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;''Kantor'' (1993), [https://books.google.com/books?id=1SD_AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA230 p. 230]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1794 in Algiers, the Jewish Rabbi Mordecai Narboni was accused of having maligned Islam in a quarrel with his neighbour. He was ordered to be burnt alive unless he converted to Islam, but he refused and was therefore executed on 14 July 1794.&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.jewishgen.org/wconnect/wc.dll?jg~jgsys~josdates JOS Calendar Conversion Results], ''Hirschberg'' (1981), [https://books.google.com/books?id=g_mh5fuel0QC&amp;pg=PA20 p. 20]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1793, Ali Benghul made a short-lived ''coup d'état'' in [[Tripoli]], deposing the ruling [[Karamanli dynasty]]. During his short, violent reign he seized for example, the two interpreters for the Dutch and English consuls, both of them Jews, and roasted them over a slow fire, on charges of conspiracy and espionage.&lt;ref&gt;''Tully'' (1817), [https://books.google.com/books?id=QBkQAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA365 p. 365]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Persia====
During a famine in Persia in 1668, the government took severe measures against those trying to profiteer from the misfortune of the populace. Restaurant owners found guilty of profiteering were slowly roasted on spits, and greedy bakers were baked in their own ovens.&lt;ref&gt;''Ferrier'' (1996), [https://books.google.com/books?id=5CLkDgmVs1QC&amp;pg=PA94 p. 94]&lt;/ref&gt;

A physician, Dr C.J. Wills, traveling through [[Persia]] in 1866–81 noted that shortly before his (Wills') arrival, a "priest" had been burned alive. Wills wrote:&lt;ref&gt;''Wills'' (1891), [http://openlibrary.org/books/OL7180554M/In_the_land_of_the_lion_and_sun p. 204]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|''Just prior to my first arrival in Persia, the "Hissam-u-Sultaneh", another uncle of the king, had burned a priest to death for a horrible crime and murder; the priest was chained to a stake, and the matting from the mosques piled on him to a great height, the pile of mats was lighted and burnt freely, but when the mats were consumed the priest was found groaning, but still alive. The executioner went to Hissam-u-Sultaneh who ordered him to obtain more mats, pour naphtha on them, and apply a light, which 'after some hours' he did.''}}

===Roasting by means of heated metal===
The previous cases concern primarily death by burning through contact with open fire or burning material; a slightly different principle is to enclose an individual within, or attach him to, a metal contraption which is subsequently heated. In the following, some reports of such incidents, or anecdotes about such are included.

====The brazen bull====
[[File:Pierre Woeiriot Phalaris.jpg|thumb|Perillos being forced into the brazen bull that he built for Phalaris]]

Perhaps the most infamous example of a [[brazen bull]], which is a hollow metal structure shaped like a bull within which the condemned is put, and then roasted alive as the metal bull is gradually heated up, is the one allegedly constructed by Perillos of [[Athens]] for the 6th-century BC tyrant [[Phalaris]] at [[Agrigentum]], [[Sicily]]. As the story goes, the first victim of the bull was its constructor Perillos himself. The historian George Grote was among those regarding this story as having sufficient evidence behind it to be true, and points particularly to that the Greek poet [[Pindar]], working just one or two generations after the times of Phalaris refers to the brazen bull. A bronze bull was, in fact, one of the spoils of victory when the [[Carthaginians]] conquered Agrigentum.&lt;ref&gt;''Grote'' (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=62HlSNN2lqQC&amp;pg=PA305 p. 305, footnote 1]&lt;/ref&gt; The story of a brazen bull as an execution device is not wholly unique. About 1000 years later, for example, in AD 497, it can be read in an old chronicle about the [[Visigoths]] on the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and the south of France:
{{quote|[[Burdunellus]] became a tyrant in Spain and a year later was ... handed over by his own men and having been sent to [[Toulouse]], he was placed inside a bronze bull and burnt to death.&lt;ref&gt;Quote and extrapolation to be found in ''Collins'' (2004), p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Fate of a Scottish regicide====
[[Walter Stewart, Earl of Atholl]] was a Scottish nobleman complicit in the murder of King [[James I of Scotland]]. On 26 March 1437 Stewart had a red hot iron crown placed upon his head, was cut in pieces alive, his heart was taken out, and then thrown in a fire. A papal [[nuncio]], the later Pope [[Pius II]] witnessed the execution of Stewart and his associate [[Sir Robert Graham]], and, reportedly, said he was at a loss to determine whether the ''crime'' committed by the regicides, or the ''punishment'' of them was the greater.&lt;ref&gt;''Encycl. Perth.'' (1816), [https://books.google.com/books?id=VoJnKgmUH54C&amp;pg=PA131 p. 131, column 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

====György Dózsa on the iron throne====
[[File:GeorgheDoja.jpg|thumb|right|Dózsa's execution (contemporary woodcut)]]
[[György Dózsa]] led a peasants' revolt in Hungary, and was captured in 1514. He was bound to a glowing iron throne and a likewise hot iron crown was placed on his head, and he was roasted to death.&lt;ref&gt;''Klein'' (1833), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ppwAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA351 p. 351]&lt;/ref&gt;

====The tale of the murderous midwife====
In a few English 18th- and 19th-century newspapers and magazines, a tale was circulated about the particularly brutal manner in which a French midwife was put to death on 28 May 1673 in Paris. No fewer than 62 infant skeletons were found buried on her premises, and she was condemned on multiple accounts of abortion/infanticide. One detailed account of her supposed execution runs as follows:
{{quote|A gibbet was erected, under which a fire was made, and the prisoner being brought to the place of execution, was hung up in a large iron cage, in which were also placed sixteen wild cats, which had been catched in the woods for the purpose.—When the heat of the fire became too great to be endured with patience, the cats flew upon the woman, as the cause of the intense pain they felt.—In about fifteen minutes they had pulled out her intrails, though she continued yet alive, and sensible, imploring, as the greatest favour, an immediate death from the hands of some charitable spectator. No one however dared to afford her the least assistance; and she continued in this wretched situation for the space of thirty-five minutes, and then expired in unspeakable torture. At the time of her death, twelve of the cats were expired, and the other four were all dead in less than two minutes afterwards.}}

The English commentator adds his own view on the matter:{{quote|However cruel this execution may appear with regard to the poor animals, it certainly cannot be thought too severe a punishment for such a monster of iniquity, as could calmly proceed in acquiring a fortune by the deliberate murder of such numbers of unoffending, harmless innocents. And if a method of executing murderers, in a manner somewhat similar to this was adapted in England, perhaps the horrid crime of murder might not so frequently disgrace the annals of the present times.&lt;ref&gt;''Stevens'' (1764), [https://books.google.com/books?id=DIsfAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA522 pp. 522–523]&lt;/ref&gt; }}

===Pouring molten metal down the throat or ears===

====Molten gold poured down the throat====
A number of stories concern individuals who are said to have been executed by having molten gold (melting point 1064&amp;nbsp;°C/1947&amp;nbsp;°F) poured down their throats. For example, in 88 BC, [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]] captured the Roman general [[Manius Aquillius (consul 101 BC)|Manius Aquillius]], and executed him by pouring molten gold down his throat.&lt;ref&gt;''Steel'' (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ae63Gjp21SgC&amp;pg=PA98 p. 98]&lt;/ref&gt; A popular but unsubstantiated rumor also had the Parthians executing the famously greedy Roman general [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]] in this manner in 53 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Licinius Crassus]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Genghis Khan]] is said to have poured molten gold down the throat of a perfidious governor in 1220,&lt;ref&gt;''Saunders'' (2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=nFx3OlrBMpQC&amp;pg=PA57 p. 57] According to the 13th-century historian [[Shihab al-Din Muhammad al-Nasawi|al-Nasawi]], the governor Inal Khan (who had assassinated the Mongol ambassadors and thus given Genghis Khan cause to invade), had the molten gold poured into his eyes and ears, rather than down his throat. ''Cameron, Sela'' (2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=SAX5ohFkcVgC&amp;pg=PA128 p. 128]&lt;/ref&gt; and an early 14th-century chronicle mentions that his grandson [[Hulagu Khan]] did likewise to the sultan [[Al-Musta'sim]] after the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|fall of Baghdad in 1258]] to the Mongol army.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford regards the Hulagu story as a legend ''Crawford'' (2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BfNqgYlo9fMC&amp;pg=PA149 p. 149]&lt;/ref&gt; (Marco Polo's version is that [[Al-Musta'sim]] was locked without food or water to starve in his treasure room)
[[File:Theodor de Bry 78.jpeg|thumb|[[Theodor de Bry]] engraving of a Conquistador being executed by gold]]
The Spanish in 16th-century Americas gave horrified reports that the Spanish who had been captured by the natives (who had learnt of the Spanish thirst for gold) had their feet and hands bound, and then molten gold poured down their throats as the victims were mocked: "Eat, eat gold, Christians".&lt;ref&gt;''Cummins, Cole, Zorach'' (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=IUKBQfzKlIYC&amp;pg=PA99 p. 99]&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 19th century reports from the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Kingdom of Siam]] (present day [[Thailand]]) stated that those who have defrauded the public treasury could have either molten gold or silver poured down their throat.&lt;ref&gt;''Begbie'' (1834), [https://books.google.com/books?id=0MwNAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA447 p. 447]&lt;/ref&gt;

====A punishment for inebriation and tobacco smoking====
The 16th-/early 17th-century prime minister [[Malik Ambar]] in the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] [[Ahmadnagar Sultanate]] would not tolerate inebriation among his subjects, and would pour molten lead (melting point 327&amp;nbsp;°C/621.43&amp;nbsp;°F) down the mouths of those caught in that condition.&lt;ref&gt;''Eaton'' (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=DNNgdBWoYKoC&amp;pg=PA121 p. 121]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in the 17th century [[Sultanate of Aceh]] Sultan [[Iskandar Muda]] (r. 1607–36) is said to have poured molten lead into the mouths of at least two drunken subjects.&lt;ref&gt;''Peletz'' (2002), [https://books.google.com/books?id=q4TA4hjqjJ0C&amp;pg=PA28 p. 28]&lt;/ref&gt; Military discipline in 19th-century [[Burma]] was reportedly harsh, with strict prohibition of smoking [[opium]] or drinking [[arrack]]. Some monarchs, it appears, had ordained pouring molten lead down the throats of those who drank anyway, "but it has been found necessary to relax this severity, in order to conciliate the army"&lt;ref&gt;''Buckingham'' (1835), [https://books.google.com/books?id=qrhHAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA250 p. 250]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shah [[Safi of Persia|Safi I]] of Persia is said to have abhorred tobacco, and apparently in 1634, he prescribed the punishment of pouring molten lead into the throats of smokers.&lt;ref&gt;''Berger, Sicker'' (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=4jjhnbu8ytEC&amp;pg=PA6 p. 6]&lt;/ref&gt;

====A Mongol punishment for horse thieves====
According to historian Pushpa Sharma, stealing a horse was considered the most heinous offence within the Mongol army, and the culprit would either have molten lead poured into his ears, or alternatively, his punishment would be the breaking of the spinal cord or beheading.&lt;ref&gt;''Sharma, Srivastava'' (1981), [https://books.google.com/books?id=nKJiBUFrmfoC&amp;pg=PA361 p. 361]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese tradition of Buddhist self-immolation===
Apparently, for many centuries, a tradition of devotional [[self-immolation]] existed among [[Buddhist]] monks in China. One monk who immolated himself in AD 527, explained his intent a year before, in the following manner:
{{quote|The body is like a poisonous plant; it would really be right to burn it and extinguish its life. I have been weary of this physical frame for many a long day. I vow to worship the buddhas, just like Xijian.&lt;ref&gt;''Benn'' (2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=dWL6EEkL8goC&amp;pg=PA3 p. 3]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A severe critic in the 16th century wrote the following comment on this practice:
{{quote|There are demonic people ... who pour on oil, stack up firewood, and burn their bodies while still alive. Those who look on are overawed and consider it the attainment of enlightenment. This is erroneous.&lt;ref&gt;''Benn'' (2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=dWL6EEkL8goC&amp;pg=PA198 pp. 198–199]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Japanese persecution of Christians===
{{further|Persecution of Christians in Japan}}
In the first half of the 17th century, Japanese authorities sporadically persecuted Christians, with some executions seeing persons being burnt alive. At [[Nagasaki]] in 1622, for example, some 25 monks were burnt alive,&lt;ref&gt;''Lee'' (2010),[https://books.google.com/books?id=LKj2B9vd7HsC&amp;pg=PA121 pp. 121–122]&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Edo]] in 1624, 50 Christians were burnt alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Matsumoto'' (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=kF1sTidtP_sC&amp;pg=PA73 p. 73]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stories of cannibalism===

====Americas====
Even fateful encounters with cannibals are recorded: in 1514, in the Americas, Francis of Córdoba and five companions were, reportedly, caught, impaled on spits, roasted and eaten by the natives. In 1543, such was also the end of a previous bishop, [[Vincente de Valverde|Vincent de Valle Viridi]].&lt;ref&gt;''Perckmayr'' (1738), [https://books.google.com/books?id=3lpBAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA628 p. 628]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fiji====
In 1844, the missionary John Watsford wrote a letter about the internecine wars on [[Fiji]], and how captives could be eaten, after being roasted alive:
{{quote|At Mbau, perhaps, more human beings are eaten than anywhere else. A few weeks ago they ate twenty-eight in one day. They had seized their wretched victims while fishing, and brought them alive to Mbau, and there half-killed them, and then put them into their ovens. Some of them made several vain attempts to escape from the scorching flame.&lt;ref&gt;''Calvert, Rowe'' (1858), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ov1EAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA258 p. 258]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The actual manner of the roasting process was described by the missionary pioneer David Cargill, in 1838:
{{quote|When about to be immolated, he is made to sit on the ground with his feet under his thighs and his hands placed before him. He is then bound so that he cannot move a limb or a joint. In this posture he is placed on stones heated for the occasion (and some of them are red-hot), and then covered with leaves and earth, to be roasted alive. When cooked, he is taken out of the oven and, his face and other parts being painted black, that he may resemble a living man ornamented for a feast or for war, he is carried to the temple of the gods and, being still retained in a sitting posture, is offered as a propitiatory sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Hogg'' (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Immolation of widows===

====Indian subcontinent====
{{main|Sati (practice)|l1=Sati}}
[[File:A Hindoo Widow Burning Herself with the Corpse of her Husband.jpg|thumb|A [[Hindu]] widow burning herself with the corpse of her husband, 1820s]]
[[File:Burning of a Widow.jpg|thumb|''Ceremony of Burning a Hindu Widow with the Body of her Late Husband'', from ''Pictorial History of China and India'', 1851]]

Sati refers to a [[funeral]] practice among some communities of [[Indian subcontinent]] in which a recently widowed woman [[Self-immolation|immolates herself]] on her husband's [[funeral pyre]]. The first reliable evidence for the practice of ''sati'' appears from the time of the [[Gupta Empire]] (AD 400),  when instances of sati began to be marked by inscribed memorial stones.&lt;ref name="Shastri"&gt;Shakuntala Rao Shastri, ''Women in the Sacred Laws''—the later law books (1960), also reproduced online at [http://www.hindubooks.org/women_in_the_sacredlaws/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408222221/http://www.hindubooks.org/women_in_the_sacredlaws/ |date=8 April 2014 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one model of history thinking, the practice of ''sati'' only became really widespread with the Muslim invasions of India, and the practice of ''sati'' now acquired a new meaning as a means to preserve the honour of women whose men had been slain. As S.S.Sashi lays out the argument, "The argument is that the practice came into effect during the Islamic invasion of India, to protect their honor from Muslims who were known to commit mass rape on the women of cities that they could capture successfully."&lt;ref&gt;''Sashi'' (1996), p.115&lt;/ref&gt; It is also said that according to the memorial stone evidence, the practice was carried out in appreciable numbers in western and southern parts of India, and even in some areas, before pre-Islamic times.&lt;ref&gt;For Yang's full discussion back and forth, see ''Yang, Sarkar, Sarkar'' (2008), [http://books.google.no/books?id=GEPYbuzOwcQC&amp;pg=PA21 pp.21-23]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the rulers and activist of the time sought actively to suppress the practice of ''sati''.&lt;ref name=Columbia&gt;S.M. ''Ikram, Embree'' (1964) [http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00islamlinks/ikram/part2_17.html XVII. "Economic and Social Developments under the Mughals"]  This page maintained by Prof. [[Frances Pritchett]], [[Columbia University]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The British began to compile statistics of the incidences of ''sati'' for all their domains from 1815 and onwards. The official statistics for [[Bengal]] represents that the practice was much more common here than elsewhere, recorded numbers typically in the range 500-600 per year, up to the year 1829, when the British authorities banned the practice.&lt;ref&gt;These statistics are further researched and discussed by other scholars, for their reliability (in particular, ''objections'' to that) and representation, see  '''For detailed official statistical information 1815-1829''',''Yang, Sarkar, Sarkar'' (2008), [http://books.google.no/books?id=GEPYbuzOwcQC&amp;pg=PA23 pp.23-25] see pages 24 and 25 in particular, history behind them, p.23&lt;/ref&gt; Since 19th - 20th Century, the practice remains outlawed in Indian subcontinent.

[[Jauhar]] was a practice among royal Hindu women to prevent capture by Muslim conquerors.

====Bali and Nepal====
The practice of burning widows has not been restricted to the Indian subcontinent; at [[Bali]], the practice was called ''masatia'' and, apparently, restricted to the burning of royal widows. Although the Dutch colonial authorities had banned the practice, one such occasion is attested as late as in 1903, probably for the last time.&lt;ref&gt;For notice of estimate of last time, see ''Schulte Nordholt'' (2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZUVlAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA211 pp. 211–212, footnote 56]  For estimate of restriction to royal widows, see ''Wiener'' (1995), [https://books.google.com/books?id=GE1uc1UNXNYC&amp;pg=PA267 p. 267]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Nepal]], the practice was not banned until 1920.&lt;ref&gt;''Mittra, Kumar'' (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=hYEQGam5hVgC&amp;pg=PA200 p. 200]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditions in sub-Saharan African cultures===
C.H.L. Hahn&lt;ref&gt;Biographical entry of C.H.L. Hahn at [http://www.klausdierks.com/Biographies/Biographies_H.htm BIOGRAPHIES OF NAMIBIAN PERSONALITIES]&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that within the O-ndnonga tribe among the [[Ovambo people]] in modern-day [[Namibia]], abortion was not used at all (in contrast to among the other tribes), and that furthermore, if two young unwed individuals had sex resulting in pregnancy, then both the girl and the boy were "taken out to the bush, bound up in bundles of grass and ... burnt alive."&lt;ref&gt;''Hahn'' (1966), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z8Z3FQXOiNEC&amp;pg=PA33 p. 33]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislation against the practice===
In 1790, Sir Benjamin Hammett introduced a bill into [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] to end the practice of judicial burning. He explained that the year before, as [[Sheriff]] of London, he had been responsible for the burning of [[Catherine Murphy (counterfeiter)|Catherine Murphy]], found guilty of [[counterfeit]]ing, but that he had allowed her to be hanged first. He pointed out that as the law stood, he himself could have been found guilty of a crime in not carrying out the lawful punishment and, as no woman had been burnt alive in the kingdom for more than half a century, so could all those still alive who had held an official position at all of the previous burnings. The [[Treason Act 1790]] was duly passed by Parliament and given [[royal assent]] by King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] (30 George III. C. 48).&lt;ref&gt;''Wilson'' (1853), [https://books.google.com/books?id=JdkHAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA4 p. 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern burnings==
===Retaliation against Nazis===
[[Benjamin B. Ferencz]], one of the prosecutors in the [[Nuremberg trials]] who, in May 1945, investigated occurrences at the [[Ebensee concentration camp]], and narrated them to Tom Hofmann, a family member and biographer. He was completely outraged at what the Nazis had done there. When people discovered an SS guard who attempted to flee, they tied him to one of the metal trays used to transport bodies into the crematorium. They then proceeded to light the oven, and slowly roast the SS guard to death, taking him in and out of the oven several times. Ferencz said to Hofmann that at the time, he was in no position to stop the proceedings of the mob, and frankly admitted that he had not been inclined to try. Hofmann adds, "There seemed to be no limit to human brutality in wartime."&lt;ref&gt;''Hofmann'' (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=JXZzAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA86 p. 86]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lynching of Germans in Czechoslovakia===

During the [[expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia]] after the end of [[World War II]], a number of massacres against the German minority occurred. In one case in Prague in May 1945, a Czech mob hanged several Germans upside down on lampposts, doused them in fuel and set them on fire, burning them alive.&lt;ref&gt;Wilfried F. Schoeller: [http://www.deutschlandfunk.de/rueckkehr-in-die-verschollene-geschichte.700.de.html?dram:article_id=83403 ''Rückkehr in die verschollene Geschichte''] [[Deutschlandfunk]].de, 16 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gernot Facius: [https://www.welt.de/debatte/kolumnen/Meine-Woche/article6060701/Kleines-Wunder-an-der-Moldau.html ''Kleines Wunder an der Moldau''] [[Die Welt|Welt.de]], 10 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=June 2018}}

===Necklacing===
[[Necklacing]] is the practice of summary execution and torture carried out by forcing a rubber tire, filled with petrol, around a victim's chest and arms, and setting it on fire. The victim may take up to 20 minutes to die, suffering severe burns in the process. The method was widely used in [[Haiti]] and [[South Africa]].

===Extrajudicial burnings in Latin America===

In [[Rio de Janeiro, Brazil]], [[Necklacing|burning people standing inside a pile of tires]] is a common form of murder used by drug dealers to punish those who have supposedly collaborated with the police. This form of burning is called ''micro-ondas'' (microwave oven).&lt;ref&gt;''Grellet'' (2010) [http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/740136-autorizado-a-visitar-familia-condenado-por-morte-de-tim-lopes-foge-da-prisao.shtml Autorizado a visitar família..]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fenapef.org.br/fenapef/noticia/index/17079|title=Polícia encontra 4 corpos que seriam de traficantes queimados com pneus|language=Portuguese|publisher=Federação Nacional dos Policiais Federais|date=18 September 2008|author=O Globo|accessdate=6 July 2013|location=[[Rio de Janeiro]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925094951/http://www.fenapef.org.br/fenapef/noticia/index/17079|archive-date=25 September 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordreference.com/pten/micro-ondas|title=micro-ondas|publisher=WordReference|accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film ''[[Tropa de Elite]]'' (''Elite Squad'')  and the video game ''[[Max Payne 3]]'' contain scenes depicting this practice.&lt;ref name="A Revista Veja, o PT e as Tendências"&gt;''França'' (2002), [http://veja.abril.com.br/300102/p_094.html Como na Chicago de Capone]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Guatemalan Civil War]] the Guatemalan Army and security forces carried out an unknown number of extrajudicial killings by burning. In one instance in March 1967, Guatemalan guerrilla and poet [[Otto René Castillo]] was captured by Guatemalan government forces and taken to [[Zacapa]] army barracks alongside one of his comrades, Nora Paíz Cárcamo. The two were interrogated, tortured for four days, and burned alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Paige'' (1983), pp. 699–737&lt;/ref&gt; Other reported instances of immolation by Guatemalan government forces occurred in the Guatemalan government's rural counterinsurgency operations in the Guatemalan Altiplano in the 1980s. In April 1982, 13 members of a Quanjobal Pentecostal congregation in Xalbal, [[Ixcan]], were burnt alive in their church by the Guatemalan Army.&lt;ref&gt;''Garrard-Burnett'' (2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BXWwm7jo-hEC&amp;pg=PA141 p. 141]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 August 1996, a Mexican man, Rodolfo Soler Hernandez, was burned to death in [[Playa Vicente|Playa Vicente, Mexico]], after he was accused of raping and strangling a local woman to death. Local residents tied Hernandez to a tree, doused him in a flammable liquid and then set him ablaze. His death was also filmed by residents of the village. Shots taken before the killing showed that he had been badly beaten. On 5 September 1996, Mexican television stations broadcast footage of the murder. Locals carried out the killing because they were fed up with crime and believed that the police and courts were both incompetent. Footage was also shown in the 1998 [[shockumentary]] film, ''[[Banned from Television]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

A young Guatemalan woman, Alejandra María Torres, was attacked by a mob in [[Guatemala City]] on 15 December 2009. The mob alleged that Torres had attempted to rob passengers on a bus. Torres was beaten, doused with gasoline, and set on fire, but was able to put the fire out before sustaining life-threatening burns. Police intervened and arrested Torres. Torres was forced to go topless throughout the ordeal and subsequent arrest, and many photographs were taken and published. Approximately 219 people were lynched in Guatemala in 2009, of whom 45 died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In [[Chile]] during public mass protests held against the military regime of General [[Augusto Pinochet]] on 2 July 1986, engineering student [[Carmen Gloria Quintana]], 18, and Chilean-American photographer [[Rodrigo Rojas DeNegri]], 19, were arrested by a [[Chilean Army]] patrol in the [[Los Nogales]] neighborhood of [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]]. The two were searched and beaten before being doused in gasoline and burned alive by Chilean troops.

===Lynchings and mass killings by burning in the US===

During the 1980 [[New Mexico State Penitentiary riot]], a number of inmates were burnt to death by fellow inmates, who used [[blow torch]]es. Modern burnings continued as a method of [[lynching in the United States]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in the [[Southern United States|South]]. One of the most notorious extrajudicial burnings in modern history occurred in [[Waco, Texas]] on 15 May 1916. [[Jesse Washington lynching|Jesse Washington]], an African-American [[farmhand]], after having been convicted of the rape and subsequent murder of a white woman, was taken by a mob to a bonfire, castrated, doused in [[coal oil]], and hanged by the neck from a chain over the bonfire, slowly burning to death. A postcard from the event still exists, showing a crowd standing next to Washington's charred corpse with the words on the back "This is the barbecue we had last night. My picture is to the left with a cross over it. Your son, Joe". This attracted international condemnation and is remembered as the "[[Waco Horror]]".&lt;ref&gt;''DuBois'' (1916), [http://dl.lib.brown.edu/pdfs/1292363091648500.pdf pp. 1–8] ([https://www.webcitation.org/6FXqUzw4u?url=http://dl.lib.brown.edu/pdfs/1292363091648500.pdf Archive])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wade Goodwyn|Goodwyn, Wade]].

The '''Dehaene–Changeux model''' ('''DCM'''), also known as the '''global neuronal workspace''' or the '''global cognitive workspace model''' is a part of [[Bernard Baars]]'s "[[Global Workspace Theory|global workspace model]]" for consciousness.

It is a [[computer model]] of the [[neural correlates of consciousness]] programmed as a [[neural network]]. It attempts to reproduce the [[swarm behaviour]] {{clarify|date=November 2011}} of the [[brain]]'s ''higher cognitive functions'' such as [[consciousness]], [[decision-making]]&lt;ref&gt;Dehaene S, Changeux JP. '''Reward-dependent learning in neuronal networks for planning and decision making.''' Prog Brain Res. 2000;126:217-29.&lt;/ref&gt; and the central [[executive functions]]. It was developed by cognitive neuroscientists [[Stanislas Dehaene]] and [[Jean-Pierre Changeux]] beginning in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Dehaene S, Changeux JP. '''Experimental and theoretical approaches to conscious processing.''' Neuron. 2011 Apr 28;70(2):200-27.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used to provide a predictive framework to the study of [[inattentional blindness]] and the solving of the [[Tower of London test]].&lt;ref&gt;Changeux JP, Dehaene S. '''Hierarchical neuronal modeling of cognitive functions: from synaptic transmission to the Tower of London.''' Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences, Série III. 1998 Feb–Mar;321(2–3):241-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dehaene S, Changeux JP, Nadal JP. '''Neural networks that learn temporal sequences by selection.''' Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1987 May;84(9):2727-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Dehaene–Changeux model was initially established as a [[spin glass]] neural network attempting to represent [[learning]] and to then provide a stepping stone towards [[machine learning|artificial learning]] among other objectives. It would later be used to predict observable reaction times within the [[Priming (psychology)|priming paradigm]]&lt;ref&gt;Epub 2010 Jan 25. Van den Bussche E, Hughes G, Humbeeck NV, Reynvoet B '''The relation between consciousness and attention: an empirical study using the priming paradigm.''' Conscious Cogn. 2010 Mar;19(1):86–97..&lt;/ref&gt; and in inattentional blindness.

==Structure==

===General structure===
The Dehaene–Changeux model is a meta neural network (i.e. a network of neural networks) composed of a very large number of [[integrate-and-fire]] [[neuron]]s programmed in either a [[stochastic]] or deterministic way. The neurons are organised in complex [[Thalamo-cortico-thalamic circuits|thalamo-cortical columns]] with long-range connexions and a critical role {{clarify|date=November 2011}} played by the interaction between [[Constantin von Economo|von Economo's areas]]. Each thalamo-cortical column is composed of [[pyramidal cell]]s and [[Interneuron|inhibitory interneurons]] receiving a long-distance excitatory [[Neuromodulation (biology)|neuromodulation]] which could represent [[noradrenergic]] input.

===A swarm and a multi-agent system composed of neural networks===
{{Synthesis|section|date=November 2011}}
Among others Cohen &amp; Hudson (2002) had already used "''Meta neural networks as intelligent agents for diagnosis ''"&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, M.E.;  Hudson, D.L.;  Meta neural networks as intelligent agents for diagnosis Neural Networks, 2002. IJCNN '02. Proceedings of the 2002 International Joint Conference on 233 – 238&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to Cohen &amp; Hudson, Dehaene &amp; Changeux have established their model as an interaction of meta-neural networks (thalamocortical columns) themselves programmed in the manner of a "''hierarchy of neural networks that together act as an intelligent agent''", in order to use them as a system composed of a large scale of inter-connected intelligent agents for predicting the self-organized behaviour of the neural correlates of consciousness. It may also be noted that Jain et al. (2002) had already clearly identified [[spiking neuron]]s as intelligent agents&lt;ref&gt;L. C. Jain, Zhengxin Chen, Nikhil Ichalkaranje Intelligent agents and their applications Volume 98 de Studies in fuzziness and soft computing&lt;/ref&gt; since the lower bound for computational power of networks of [[Artificial neuron|spiking neurons]] is the capacity to simulate in real-time for boolean-valued inputs any [[Turing machine]].&lt;ref&gt;Maas, W. Lower Bound for the computational power of networks of spking neurons [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.55.933]&lt;/ref&gt; The '''DCM''' being composed of a very large number of interacting sub-networks which are themselves intelligent agents, it is formally a [[Multi-agent system]] programmed as a [[Swarm]] or neural networks and ''a fortiori'' of spiking neurons.

[[File:Dehaene &amp; Changeux 2005 PLOS (ccreative commons).png|thumb|900px|center|The three levels of [[complexity]] of the global workspace model: the [[Integrate and fire#Integrate-and-fire|integrate-and-fire]] neuron, the thalamo-cortical bundle and the long-range connexion. The authors provide the legend: "Shown are the constituents of the simulation (upper diagrams) and typical patterns of spontaneous activity that they can produce (lower tracings). We simulated a nested architecture in which spiking neurons (A) are incorporated within thalamocortical columns (B), which are themselves interconnected hierarchically by local and long-distance cortical connections (C) (see ''Materials and methods'' for details). While single neurons may generate sustained oscillations of [[membrane potential]]s (A), only the column and network levels generate complex waxing-and-waning [[Electroencephalography|EEG]]-like oscillations (B) and [[metastable]] global states of sustained firing (C)."&lt;ref&gt;Dehaene S, Changeux J-P (2005) '''Ongoing Spontaneous Activity Controls Access to Consciousness: A Neuronal Model for Inattentional Blindness.''' PLoS Biol 3(5): e141. {{doi|10.1371/journal.pbio.0030141}} image in full open source&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Behavior==
The DCM exhibits several surcritical {{clarify|date=November 2011}} [[Emergence|emergent behaviors]] such as [[multistability]] and a [[Hopf bifurcation]] between two very different regimes which may represent either [[sleep]] or [[arousal]] with a various [[all-or-none]] behaviors which Dehaene et al. use to determine a testable taxonomy between different states of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Dehaene S, Changeux JP, Naccache L, Sackur J, Sergent C. '''Conscious, preconscious, and subliminal processing: a testable taxonomy.''' Trends Cogn Sci. 2006 May;10(5):204-11. Epub 2006 Apr 17.&lt;/ref&gt; {{clarify|date=November 2011}}

==Scholarly reception==

===Self-organized criticality===
The Dehaene-Changeux Model contributed to the study of [[nonlinearity]] and [[self-organized criticality]] in particular as an explanatory model of the brain's emergent behaviors, including consciousness. Studying the brain's phase-locking and large-scale synchronization, Kitzbichler et al. (2011a) confirmed that criticality is a property of human brain functional network organization at all frequency intervals in the brain's physiological bandwidth.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzbichler MG, Smith ML, Christensen SR, Bullmore E. '''Broadband criticality of human brain network synchronization.''' PLoS Comput. Biol. 2009 Mar;5(3):e1000314. Epub 2009 Mar 20. {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, exploring the neural dynamics of cognitive efforts after, ''inter alia'', the Dehaene-Changeux Model, Kitzbichler et al. (2011b) demonstrated how cognitive effort breaks the [[modularity of mind]] to make human brain functional networks transiently adopt a more efficient but less economical configuration.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzbichler MG, Henson RN, Smith ML, Nathan PJ, Bullmore ET. '''Cognitive effort drives workspace configuration of human brain functional networks.''' J Neurosci. 2011 Jun 1;31(22):8259-70.&lt;/ref&gt; Werner (2007a) used the Dehaene-Changeux Global Neuronal Workspace to defend the use of statistical physics approaches for exploring phase transitions, scaling and universality properties of the so-called "Dynamic Core" of the brain, with relevance to the macroscopic electrical activity in [[EEG]] and [[Electromyography|EMG]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cogprints.org/5275/1/BrainDynamics.pdf Werner G. '''Brain dynamics across levels of organization.''' J Physiol Paris. 2007 Jul–Nov;101(4–6):273-9. Epub 2008 Jan 8.]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, building from the Dehaene-Changeux Model, Werner (2007b) proposed that the application of the twin concepts of scaling and universality of the theory of non-equilibrium phase transitions can serve as an informative approach for elucidating the nature of underlying neural-mechanisms, with emphasis on the dynamics of recursively [[Reentry (neural circuitry)|reentrant]] activity flow in intracortical and cortico-subcortical neuronal loops. [[Karl Friston|Friston]] (2000) also claimed that "''the nonlinear nature of asynchronous coupling enables the rich, context-sensitive interactions that characterize real brain dynamics, suggesting that it plays a role in functional integration that may be as important as synchronous interactions''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1692735/pdf/10724457.pdf | pmc=1692735 | pmid=10724457 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2000.0560 | volume=355 | title=The labile brain.

===States of consciousness and phenomenology===
It contributed to the study of phase transition in the brain under sedation, and notably GABA-ergic sedation such as that induced by propofol (Murphy et al. 2011, Stamatakis et al. 2010).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coma.ulg.ac.be/papers/vs/murphy_propofol.pdf Murphy M, Bruno MA, Riedner BA, Boveroux P, Noirhomme Q, Landsness EC, Brichant JF, Phillips C, Massimini M, Laureys S, Tononi G, Boly M.Propofol '''anesthesia and sleep: a high-density EEG study.''' Sleep. 2011 Mar 1;34(3):283-91A.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0014224 Stamatakis EA, Adapa RM, Absalom AR, Menon DK. '''Changes in resting neural connectivity during propofol sedation.''' PLoS One. 2010 Dec 2;5(12):e14224.] {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dehaene-Changeux Model was contrasted and cited in the study of [[collective consciousness]] and its pathologies (Wallace et al. 2007).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tbiomed.com/content/4/1/10 Wallace RM, Fullilove MT, Fullilove RE, Wallace DN. '''Collective consciousness and its pathologies: understanding the failure of AIDS control and treatment in the United States.''' Theor Biol Med Model. 2007 Feb 26;4:10. ]&lt;/ref&gt; Boly et al. (2007) used the model for a reverse somatotopic study, demonstrating a correlation between baseline brain activity and somatosensory perception in humans.&lt;ref&gt;Boly M, Balteau E, Schnakers C, Degueldre C, Moonen G, Luxen A, Phillips C, Peigneux P, Maquet P, Laureys S. '''Baseline brain activity fluctuations predict somatosensory perception in humans.''' Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 Jul 17;104(29):12187-92. Epub 2007 Jul 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Boly et al. (2008) also used the DCM in a study of the baseline state of consciousness of the human brain's [[default network]].&lt;ref&gt;Boly M, Phillips C, Tshibanda L, Vanhaudenhuyse A, Schabus M, Dang-Vu TT, Moonen G, Hustinx R, Maquet P, Laureys S.

The '''EATPUT''' model is a model for analyzing an [[information system]] designed by [[Anthony Debons]] of
the [[University of Pittsburgh]]'s [[University of Pittsburgh School of Information Sciences|School of Information Science]] in 1961. It has been widely used in the fields of information systems and information science, in a variety of areas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_q=EATPUT-model Google Scholar search for articles citing the EATPUT model]&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the use of the model in the design of information systems to serve remote islands.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, C. (1992). [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/10049713/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 A Micronesian information system: An application of EATPUT model.] ''Journal of the American Society for Information Science'', 43(9), 594-601.&lt;/ref&gt;

The EATPUT model is so called because of the six fundamental components, which taken together form the acronym EATPUT.

== Event ==

The Event Phase details occurrences relevant to the information system and their representation to the information system.  Representation to the system could take many forms such as sound or digitally coded data, depending on the information system.  For example, a weather predicting machine's event could be an increase in humidity, represented to the system as directly as an increase in water vapor in the air.

The Acquisition Phase is the sensor of an information system.  The Acquisition Phase is where the system captures its data pertaining to the Event Phase.  Continuing with the example of a weather predicting machine, the increase in water vapor in the air is detected by an instrument on the device.

== Transmission ==
Transmission actually occurs between each phase, but its most important (and most aesthetically pleasing to the acronym EATPUT) occurrence is the one between the Acquisition and Processing phases.  Transmission is a fairly straightforward concept; it is how the different components and phases of an information system communicate with each other.  Continuing with the weather predicting machine example again, the water vapor sensors might code the information digitally (this process itself would require yet another information system) and send it to the next phase.

== Processing ==
Processing is where the data is ordered, stored, retrieved, and operated on appropriately in order to form knowledge.  The amount of humidity can be compared to past years and general meteorological principles in order to analyze the event of higher or lower humidity and translate it to something more useful (e.g. "the humidity is 60%).

== Utilization ==
The Utilization Phase of the system evaluates and interprets the Processing Phase's result.  60% humidity might mean that the chance of a thunderstorm is higher.

== Transfer ==
The Transfer Phase is the action component of the system, the implementation of the knowledge the other phases have generated.  Perhaps the weather predicting machine, as it becomes more and more certain a severe thunderstorm is likely, will notify a human that can declare an appropriate storm warning or use the information for the television weather forecast.

{{Anthropology |methods}}

In [[anthropology]], [[folkloristics]], and the [[social sciences|social]] and [[behavioral sciences]], '''emic''' and '''etic''' refer to two kinds of [[field research]] done and viewpoints obtained:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.sil.org/~headlandt/ee-intro.htm |title=EE intro |publisher=SIL}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''emic,'' from within the [[social group]] (from the perspective of the subject) and ''etic,'' from outside (from the perspective of the observer).

==Definitions==
"The emic approach investigates how local people think" (Kottak, 2006): How they perceive and categorize the world, their rules for behavior, what has meaning for them, and how they imagine and explain things. "The etic (scientist-oriented) approach shifts the focus from local observations, categories, explanations, and interpretations to those of the anthropologist.  The etic approach realizes that members of a culture often are too involved in what they are doing..... to interpret their cultures impartially. When using the etic approach, the [[ethnographer]] emphasizes what he or she considers important."&lt;ref&gt;Kottak, Conrad (2006). ''Mirror for Humanity'', p. 47. McGraw-Hill, New York. {{ISBN|978-0-07-803490-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although emics and etics are sometimes regarded as inherently in conflict and one can be preferred to the exclusion of the other, the complementarity of emic and etic approaches to anthropological research has been widely recognized, especially in the areas of interest concerning the characteristics of human nature as well as the form and function of human social systems.&lt;ref&gt;Jingfeng, Xia (2013). ''An Anthropological Emic-Etic Perspective On Open Access Practices'' Academic Search Premier.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote | …Emic knowledge and interpretations are those existing within a culture, that are ‘determined by local custom, meaning, and belief’ (Ager and Loughry, 2004: n.p.) and best described by a 'native' of the culture. Etic knowledge refers to generalizations about human behavior that are considered universally true, and commonly links cultural practices to factors of interest to the researcher, such as economic or ecological conditions, that cultural insiders may not consider very relevant (Morris et al., 1999).}}
Emic and etic approaches of understanding behavior and personality fall under the study of cultural anthropology. [[Cultural anthropology]] states that people are shaped by their cultures and their subcultures, and we must account for this in the study of personality.  One way is looking at things through an emic approach. This approach "is culture specific because it focuses on a single culture and it is understood on its own terms."  As explained below, the term "emic" originated from the specific linguistic term "phonemic", from ''[[phoneme]]'', which is a language-specific way of abstracting [[speech sound]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Friedman | first1 = Howard S | first2 = Miriam W | last2 = Schustack | title = Personality: Classic Theories and Modern Research | place = Boston | publisher = Pearson Allyn &amp; Bacon | year = 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://psychology.geckos.sis.org.cn/2011/10/using-one-or-more-examples-explain-emic-and-etic-concepts-akane/ |title=Using one or more examples explain emic &amp; etic concepts |last=Akane |publisher=SIS |place=[[China|CN]] |date=October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121203103812/http://psychology.geckos.sis.org.cn/2011/10/using-one-or-more-examples-explain-emic-and-etic-concepts-akane/ |archivedate=2012-12-03 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*An 'emic' account is a description of behavior or a belief in terms meaningful (consciously or unconsciously) to the actor; that is, an emic account comes from a person within the culture.  Almost anything from within a culture can provide an emic account.
*An 'etic' account is a description of a [[behavior]] or belief by a social analyst or scientific observer (a student or scholar of anthropology or sociology, for example), in terms that can be applied across cultures; that is, an etic account attempts to be 'culturally neutral', limiting any ethnocentric, political, and/or cultural bias or alienation by the observer.
When these two approaches are combined, the “richest” view of a culture or society can be understood. On its own, an emic approach would struggle with applying overarching values to a single culture. The etic approach is helpful in enabling researchers to see more than one aspect of one culture, and in applying observations to cultures around the world.

==History==
The terms were coined in 1954 by linguist [[Kenneth Pike]], who argued that the tools developed for describing [[linguistics|linguistic]] behaviors could be adapted to the description of any human social behavior. As Pike noted, social scientists have long debated whether their knowledge is objective or subjective.  Pike's innovation was to turn away from an [[epistemological]] debate, and turn instead to a methodological solution. ''Emic'' and ''etic'' are derived from the [[Linguistics|linguistic]] terms [[phoneme|phonemic]] and [[phonetic]] respectively, which are in turn derived from Greek roots.&lt;ref&gt;Liddell, H.G. &amp; Scott, R. (1940). A Greek-English Lexicon. revised and augmented throughout by Sir Henry Stuart Jones. with the assistance of. Roderick McKenzie. Oxford: Clarendon Press&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of a truly objective description was discounted by Pike himself in his original work; he proposed the emic/etic dichotomy in anthropology as a way around philosophic issues about the very nature of [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The terms were also championed by [[anthropology|anthropologists]] [[Ward Goodenough]] and [[Marvin Harris]] with slightly different connotations from those used by Pike. Goodenough was primarily interested in understanding the culturally specific meaning of specific beliefs and practices; Harris was primarily interested in explaining human behavior.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Pike, Harris, and others have argued that cultural "insiders" and "outsiders" are equally capable of producing emic ''and'' etic accounts of their culture. Some researchers use "etic" to refer to objective or outsider accounts, and "emic" to refer to subjective or insider accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sil.org/~headlandt/ee-intro.htm|title=Thomas N. Headland: Controversies: Etic-Emic Introduction|website=Sil.org|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Margaret Mead]] was an anthropologist who studied the patterns of adolescence in Samoa. She discovered that the difficulties and the transitions that adolescents faced are culturally influenced. The hormones that are released during puberty can be defined using an etic framework, because [[adolescents]] globally have the same [[hormones]] being secreted. However, Mead concluded that how adolescents respond to these hormones is greatly influenced by their cultural norms. Through her studies, Mead found that simple classifications about behaviors and [[personality]] could not be used because peoples’ cultures influenced their behaviors in such a radical way.  Her studies helped create an emic approach of understanding behaviors and personality. Her research deduced that culture has a significant impact in shaping an individual’s personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/mead/field-sepik.html|title=Papua New Guinea: Sex and Temperament - Margaret Mead: Human Nature and the Power of Culture - Exhibitions - Library of Congress|work=loc.gov|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Jung]], a Swiss [[psychoanalyst]], is a researcher who took an etic approach in his studies. Jung studied [[mythology]], [[religion]], ancient rituals, and [[dreams]] leading him to believe that there are [[archetypes]] that can be identified and used to categorize people’s behaviors. Archetypes are universal structures of the collective unconscious that refer to the inherent way people are predisposed to perceive and process information.  The main archetypes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/personalitydevelopment/tp/archetypes.htm|title=What Are Jung's 4 Major Archetypes?|author=Kendra Cherry|work=About.com Education|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Jung studied were the [[persona]] (how people choose to present themselves to the world), the [[anima and animus|animus]]/ anima (part of people experiencing the world in viewing the opposite sex, that guides how they select their romantic partner), and the [[shadow]] (dark side of personalities because people have a concept of evil. Well-adjusted people must integrate both good and bad parts of themselves). Jung looked at the role of the [[mother]] and deduced that all people have mothers and see their mothers in a similar way; they offer nurture and comfort. His studies also suggest that “infants have evolved to suck milk from the breast, it is also the case that all children have inborn tendencies to react in certain ways.” This way of looking at the mother is an etic way of applying a concept cross-culturally and universally.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Importance as regards personality==
Emic and etic approaches are important to understanding personality because problems can arise “when concepts, measures, and methods are carelessly transferred to other cultures in attempts to make cross- cultural generalizations about personality.” It is hard to apply certain generalizations of behavior to people who are so diverse and culturally different. One example of this is the F-scale (Macleod).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/authoritarian-personality.html|title=Theories of Personality|work=simplypsychology.org|accessdate=21 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024113220/http://www.simplypsychology.org/authoritarian-personality.html|archivedate=24 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[F-scale (personality test)|F-scale]], which was created by [[Theodor Adorno]], is used to measure [[Authoritarian Personality]], which can, in turn, be used to predict prejudiced behaviors. This test, when applied to Americans accurately depicts [[prejudices]] towards black individuals. However, when a study was conducted in [[South Africa]] using the F-Scale, (Pettigrew and Friedman) &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; results did not predict any anti-Black prejudices. This study used emic approaches of study by conducting interviews with the locals and etic approaches by giving participants generalized personality tests.

'''''God's Debris: A Thought Experiment''''' is a 2001 novella by ''[[Dilbert]]'' creator [[Scott Adams]].

''God's Debris'' espouses a [[philosophy]] based on the idea that the simplest explanation tends to be the best. It proposes a form of [[pandeism]] and [[monism]], postulating that an [[omnipotence|omnipotent]] god annihilated himself in the [[Big Bang]], because an [[omniscience|omniscient]] entity would already know everything possible except his own lack of existence, and exists now as the smallest units of [[matter]] and the law of [[probability]], or "God's debris".

The introduction disclaims any personal views held by the author, "The opinions and philosophies expressed by the characters are not my own, except by coincidence in a few spots not worth mentioning".&lt;ref&gt;''God's Debris'', page X&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The central character, according to the introduction, knows "everything. Literally everything." Adams, whose knowledge is as incomplete as the next person, got around this by using the aforementioned "simplest explanation" for each concept raised in the book because, while "in this complicated world the simplest explanation is usually dead wrong", a more simple explanation often sounds more right and more convincing than anything complex.

This character, the Avatar, defines God as primordial matter (like [[quarks]] and [[lepton]]s) and the law of [[probability]]. He offers recommendations on everything from an alternative theory for [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|planetary motion]] to successful recipes for [[personal relationship|relationships]] under his system. He proposes that God is currently reassembling himself through the continuing formation of a [[collective intelligence]] in the form of the [[human race]], modern examples of which include the development of the internet; this is related to the idea of the [[Omega Point]].

However, in the introduction, Adams describes ''God's Debris'' as a [[thought experiment]], challenging readers to differentiate its scientifically accepted theories from "creative baloney designed to sound true," and to "Try to figure out what's wrong with the simplest explanation."&lt;ref&gt;''God's Debris'', page XI&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Levels of consciousness ===
The chapter "Fifth Level" (p.&amp;nbsp;124) describes five levels of human awareness, or consciousness.
* Level 1: [[Consciousness]] at birth: pure [[innocence]], [[self-awareness]].
* Level 2: Awareness of others, and acceptance of authority (a [[belief system]]).
* Level 3: Awareness that some beliefs may be wrong, but not sure which ones.
* Level 4: [[Skepticism]] and adoption of the [[scientific method]].
* Level 5: Avatar level, understanding that the human mind is a [[Maya (illusion)|delusion]]-generating machine, and that science is another belief system, albeit a useful one.

== Philosophical roots ==
The book subscribes to the [[George Lakoff|Lakoffian]] point of view, in that the mind is viewed as a "delusion generator" rather than a window to true understanding. As [[George Lakoff]] said: "Our ordinary conceptual system, in terms of which we both think and act, is fundamentally metaphorical in nature."

The particular philosophy espoused has been identified as a form of [[pandeism]], the concept that a god created the universe by becoming the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Knujon Mapson, ''Pandeism: An Anthology'' (2017), p. 31-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication ==
Given Adams' fame as the author of the ''Dilbert'' comics, publishers were wary of publishing any book by Adams without ''Dilbert'' content. The book was therefore released initially as an [[e-book]] (with comparatively small "publishing" costs). Based on its rapid success, however, it was also quickly released in hard-cover format. The book can be found on-line (see external links below).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1721">[[David Hume]] coined a sceptical, reductionist viewpoint on causality that inspired the [[Logical positivism|logical-positivist]] definition of [[empirical law]] that "is a regularity or universal generalization of the form 'All Cs are Es' or, whenever C, then E".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.pl/books/about/Philosophy_of_Economics.html?id=I98uLgEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Philosophy of Economics: A Contemporary Introduction|last=Reiss|first=Julian|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415881166|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Scottish philosopher and economist believed that human mind is not equipped with the ability to observe causal relations. What can be seen is one event following another. The reductionist approach to causation can be exemplified with the case of two [[billiard balls]]: one ball is moving, hits another one and stops, and the second ball is moving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maziarz|first=Mariusz|date=|year=2015|title=A review of the Granger-causality fallacy|url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/bus/jphile/v8y2015i2n6.html|journal=The Journal of Philosophical Economics|volume=8|issue=2|pages=86–205|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "'''identifiable victim effect'''" refers to the tendency of individuals to offer greater aid when a specific, identifiable person ("victim") is observed under hardship, as compared to a large, vaguely defined group with the same need.&lt;ref name= "Jenni &amp; Loewenstein, 1997"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jenni|first=Karen|last2=Loewenstein|first2=George|date=1997-05-01|title=Explaining the Identifiable Victim Effect|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1007740225484|journal=Journal of Risk and Uncertainty|language=en|volume=14|issue=3|pages=235–257|doi=10.1023/A:1007740225484|issn=0895-5646}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect is also observed when subjects administer [[punishment]] rather than reward. Research has shown that individuals can be more likely to mete out punishment, even at their own expense, when they are punishing specific, identifiable individuals ("perpetrators").&lt;ref name= "Small &amp; Loewenstein, 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Small|first=Deborah A.|last2=Loewenstein|first2=George|date=2005-12-01|title=The devil you know: the effects of identifiability on punishment|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bdm.507/abstract|journal=Journal of Behavioral Decision Making|language=en|volume=18|issue=5|pages=311–318|doi=10.1002/bdm.507|issn=1099-0771}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concrete images and representations are often more powerful sources of persuasion than are abstract statistics.&lt;ref name="Collins &amp; Taylor, 1988"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collins|first=Rebecca L.|last2=Taylor|first2=Shelley E.|last3=Wood|first3=Joanne V.|last4=Thompson|first4=Suzanne C.|date=1988-01-01|title=The vividness effect: Elusive or illusory?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022103188900418|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=24|issue=1|pages=1–18|doi=10.1016/0022-1031(88)90041-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Ryan White]] contracted [[HIV/AIDS|HIV]] at age 13 and struggled with the disease until succumbing some six years later. Following his death, the US congress passed the [[Ryan White Care Act]], which funded the largest set of services for people living with the AIDS in the country.&lt;ref name= "Ryan"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dhhr.wv.gov/oeps/std-hiv-hep/HIV_AIDS/caresupport/Pages/RyanWhiteCareAct.aspx|title=Ryan White and Care Act History|last=|first=|date=|website=dhhr.wv.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect is epitomized by the phrase (commonly attributed to [[Joseph Stalin]]) "A single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic."&lt;ref&gt;http://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/05/21/death-statistic/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
The conceptualization of the identifiable victim effect as it is known today is commonly attributed to American economist [[Thomas Schelling]]. He wrote that harm to a particular person invokes “anxiety and sentiment, guilt and awe, responsibility and religion, [but]…most of this awesomeness disappears when we deal with statistical death”.&lt;ref name="Schelling, 1968"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schelling|first=Thomas, C|date=|year=1968|editor-last=Chase|title=The Life You Save May Be Your Own|url=|journal=Problems in public expenditure analysis (pp. 127–162). :|publisher=The Brookings Institution|volume=|pages=127–162|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explanations ==

=== ''Ex post'' vs ''ex ante'' evaluation ===

The decision to save an identifiable victim is made ''ex post'', meaning it is done ''after'' the victim is in danger. In contrast, the decision to save a statistical victim is often made ''ex ante'', as a pre-emptive measure to ''prevent'' the individual from being in danger.&lt;ref name="Weinstein, Shepard, &amp; Pliskin, 1980"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weinstein|first=M|last2=Shepard|first2=D|last3=Pliskin|first3=J|year=1980|title=The Economic Value of Changing Mortality Probabilities: A Decision-Theoretic Approach|url=|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|volume=94 |issue=2|pages=373–396|via=|doi=10.2307/1884546}}&lt;/ref&gt; When people consider the risks of not helping a victim, they consider the probability of being responsible and blamed.&lt;ref name="Douglas, 2017"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-7B2338nHGgC&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q=douglas%20risk%20and%20blame|title=Risk and Blame|last=Douglas|first=Professor Mary|last2=Douglas|first2=Professor of Anthropology Mary|date=2013-06-17|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136490040|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This probability is much greater with identifiable victims than with statistical victims because one cannot accurately predict the likelihood of a tragedy occurring in the future and thus cannot be held responsible for tragedies that ''might'' occur in the future.&lt;ref name= "Jenni &amp; Loewenstein, 1997" /&gt; (Although, Jenni, &amp; Loewenstein (1997) have found no evidence to support the effect of ex post/ex ante on IVE)

This explanation is closest to what Thomas Schelling implied in his now-famous paper.

=== Vividness ===
Identifiable victims, as their name suggests, have features that make them identifiable. Details about their predicament, family background, educational history, etc., are shared through the media and brought to public attention. The stories are emotional, with victims often portrayed as innocent and helpless. For example, Perrault et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perrault|first=Evan K.|last2=Silk|first2=Kami J.|last3=Sheff|first3=Sarah|last4=Ahn|first4=Jisoo|last5=Hoffman|first5=Alice|last6=Totzkay|first6=Daniel|date=2015-10-02|title=Testing the Identifiable Victim Effect With Both Animal and Human Victims in Anti-Littering Messages|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/08824096.2015.1089857|journal=Communication Research Reports|volume=32|issue=4|pages=294–303|doi=10.1080/08824096.2015.1089857|issn=0882-4096}}&lt;/ref&gt; tested an identifiable human victim message, in relation to an identifiable animal victim (i.e., a squirrel) using the context of the consequences of littering, and found the identifiable animal message - an innocent and helpless creature - elicited greater levels of distress and empathy than the identifiable human message. Images and videos of the victim are often shared, and the public is able to follow the victim's predicament in real-time. Studies have previously indicated that people respond more to concrete, graphic information than abstract, statistical information.&lt;ref name= "Nisbett, 1980"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human Inference: Strategies and Shortcomings of Social Judgment|last=Nisbett|first=Richard|last2=Ross|first2=Lee|publisher=Prentice-Hall|year=1980|isbn=978-0134451305|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vividness of identifiable victims creates a sense of familiarity and social closeness(opposite of social distance).Therefore, identifiable victims elicit greater reactions from people than statistical victims. (Although, Jenni, &amp; Loewenstein (1997) have found no evidence to support this effect)

=== Certainty effect, risk-seeking for losses and loss aversion ===

The certainty effect and risk seeking for losses reinforce each other. The [[certainty effect]] is the inclination to place disproportionately greater weighting to certain outcomes than to uncertain but likely outcomes.&lt;ref name= "Kanheman &amp; Tversky, 1979"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel|last2=Tversky|first2=Amos|date=1979-01-01|title=Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision under Risk|jstor=1914185|journal=Econometrica|volume=47|issue=2|pages=263–291|doi=10.2307/1914185}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consequences to identifiable victims are viewed as certain to occur whereas the consequences to statistical victims are viewed as probabilistic.&lt;ref name= "Jenni &amp; Loewenstein, 1997" /&gt; Research has also shown the tendency of people to be risk-seeking for losses.&lt;ref name= "Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1986"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tversky|first=Amos|last2=Kahneman|first2=Daniel|date=1986-01-01|title=Rational Choice and the Framing of Decisions|jstor=2352759|journal=The Journal of Business|volume=59|issue=4|pages=S251–S278}}&lt;/ref&gt; A certain loss is viewed more negatively than an uncertain loss with the same expected value. Closely related to this is people tend to be loss averse.&lt;ref name= "Kanheman &amp; Tversky, 1979" /&gt; They view saving a statistical life as a gain whereas saving an identifiable victim is seen as avoiding a loss. Together, these effects result in people being more likely to aid identifiable, certain victims than statistical, uncertain victims.

=== Response to the relative size of the reference group ===

Risk that is concentrated is perceived as greater than the same risk dispersed over a wider population. Identifiable victims are their own reference group; if they do not receive aid then the entire reference group is regarded to perish.&lt;ref name= "Jenni &amp; Loewenstein, 1997" /&gt; To illustrate this point, consider an explosion at an offshore oil rig where 50 people work. Suppose all 50 people die in the explosion, this represents 50 of the thousands of people working on offshore oil rigs. Yet, the reference group is not the thousands of people working on offshore oil rigs but rather the 50 people working on that particular offshore oil rig. Therefore, this is perceived as 50 of 50 people certain to die so by aiding them, a significant proportion of the reference group can be saved.

People's response to the proportion of the reference group that can be saved is such a significant contributor to the identifiable victim effect that this effect could be re-labelled as the “percentage of reference group saved effect”.&lt;ref name= "Jenni &amp; Loewenstein, 1997" /&gt;

== Implications and examples ==

=== Aiding ===
One implication of the identifiable victim effect is identifiable victims are more likely to be helped than statistical victims.&lt;ref name= "Small &amp; Loewenstein, 2003"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Small|first=Deborah A.|last2=Loewenstein|first2=George|date=2003-01-01|title=Helping a Victim or Helping the Victim: Altruism and Identifiability|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1022299422219|journal=Journal of Risk and Uncertainty|language=en|volume=26|issue=1|pages=5–16|doi=10.1023/A:1022299422219|issn=0895-5646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An incident that frequently features in literature is the aid given to Jessica McClure and her family.&lt;ref name= "Loewenstein &amp; Small, 2005" /&gt; On October 14, 1987, 18-month old Jessica McClure fell into a narrow well in her aunt's home cum day-care centre in Midland, Texas.&lt;ref name= "Loewenstein &amp; Small, 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loewenstein|first=George|last2=Small|first2=Deborah|last3=Strnad|first3=Jeff|date=2005-03-01|title=Statistical, Identifiable and Iconic Victims and Perpetrators|ssrn=678281|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within hours, 'Baby Jessica', as she became known, made headlines around the US. The public reacted with sympathy towards her ordeal. While teams of rescue workers, paramedics and volunteers worked to successfully rescue 'Baby Jessica' in 58 hours, a total of $700,000 was amassed in that time. Even after being discharged from hospital, the McClure family were flooded with cards and gifts from members of the public as well as a visit from then-Vice President George H.W. Bush and a telephone call from then-President Ronald Reagan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/baby-jessica-rescued-from-a-well-as-the-world-watches|title=October 16, 1987 : Baby Jessica rescued from a well as the world watches|first=|date=2011|website=history.com|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-12|quote=|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Punishment ===
The identifiable victim effect is suggested to be a specific case of a more general 'identifiable other effect'.&lt;ref name= "Loewenstein &amp; Small, 2005" /&gt; As such, it also has an effect on punishments. People prefer to punish identified transgressors rather than unidentified transgressors when given a choice between the two. People also exert more severe punishments on identified than unidentified transgressors.&lt;ref name= "Small &amp; Loewenstein, 2005" /&gt;

Individuals are also more likely to assign blame to an identified transgressor if they feel they have been wronged. There is also an increased desire for harsh punishments that persists even when self-sacrifice is required in order to punish the transgressor. This effect can possibly be explained by the increased anger felt towards an identified rather than an unidentified transgressor. This supports the theory of “vividness” as a source of the identifiable victim effect (Small &amp; Loewenstein, 2005).&lt;ref name = "Small &amp; Loewenstein, 2005" /&gt;

=== Public policy ===

==== Healthcare ====

The identifiable victim effect may also influence healthcare, both at the individual and national level (Redelmeir &amp; Tversky, 1990).&lt;ref name= "Redelmeir &amp; Tversky, 1990"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Redelmeir | first1 = D. A. | last2 = Tversky | first2 = A. | year = 1990 | title = Discrepancy between medical decisions for individual patients and for groups | url = https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3840/ba46475c2c8d39bb786d304584cb84ae0a10.pdf#page=904 | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 322 | issue = 16| pages = 1162–1164 | doi=10.1056/nejm199004193221620}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the individual level, doctors are more likely to recommend expensive, but potentially life-saving, treatments to an individual patient rather than to a group of patients. This effect is not limited to medical professionals, as laymen demonstrate this same bias towards providing more expensive treatments for individual patients (Redelmeir &amp; Tversky, 1990).&lt;ref name= "Redelmeir &amp; Tversky, 1990" /&gt; On the national level, the American people are far more likely to contribute to an expensive treatment to save the life of one person rather than spend much smaller amounts on [[Preventive healthcare|preventative measures]] that could save the lives of thousands per year. A function of American [[individualism]], this nationwide bias towards expensive treatments is still prevalent today (Toufexis &amp; Bjerklie, 1993).&lt;ref name= "Toufexis &amp; Bjerklie, 1993"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Toufexis | first1 = A. | last2 = Bjerklie | first2 = D. | year = 1993 | title = The ultimate choice | url = http://web.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.nd.edu/ehost/detail/detail?sid=938602b4-df0c-46ad-9002-c3a01fe3bf00%40sessionmgr4009&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=4214&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=9308240013&amp;db=aph | journal = Time | volume = 142 | issue = 9| page = 43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Ryan White Care Act =====
The need to tackle the problems faced by AIDS sufferers was brought to the political forefront as a result of the legal and social plight of one particular AIDS victim, Ryan White. His circumstances and campaign for greater funding for AIDS research were widely publicised in the media which culminated in legislation being passed to provide financial support to AIDS sufferers and their families in 1990 shortly after White's death.&lt;ref name= "Ryan" /&gt;

==== Criminal justice ====

Since the identifiable victim effect can influence punishment, it has the potential to undermine the system of trial by jury (Small &amp; Loewenstein, 2005).&lt;ref name= "Small &amp; Loewenstein, 2005" /&gt; Jurors, when deliberating, work with an identifiable perpetrator, and thus may attach negative emotions (e.g. disgust, anger) to the individual or assign increased blame when handing down a harsh sentence. Policymakers, who are unable to see the individual offender, being almost entirely emotionally removed, may actually have intended a more lenient sentence. This may produce a harsher verdict than the legal guidelines recommend or allow. On the other extreme, jurors may feel [[sympathy]], relating with the perpetrator on a level not experienced by policymakers, leading to a milder verdict than legally appropriate or allowable (Small &amp; Loewenstein, 2005).&lt;ref name = "Small &amp; Loewenstein, 2005" /&gt;

Typically in crime investigations, law enforcement forces conceal any information regarding the identities of the suspects until they have strong evidence that the suspects are credible. When identities of suspects are revealed through description of their features or release of their images, media coverage and public discussion on the issue grows. On one side, the public discourse can become increasingly negative and hostile, or, if the perpetrator is sympathetic, support for the perpetrator may grow. This is because people experience a greater emotional reaction towards a concrete, identifiable perpetrator than an abstract, unidentifiable one.&lt;ref name = "Small &amp; Loewenstein, 2005" /&gt;

=====Brady Bill =====
[[James Brady|James S. Brady]], the then-White House press secretary, was among three collateral damage victims in the attempted assassination of President Reagan in 1981. Brady was explicitly named in reports of the shooting in contrast to the other two injured, a District of Columbia police officer and a Secret Service agent. The political reaction was largely focused on the injuries of Brady which led to the enactment of the [[Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act|Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993]]. It states that it is mandatory for firearm dealers to perform background searches on firearm purchasers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/brady-act-gun-buyer-background-checks-3321492|title=Brady Act Gun Buyer Background Checks|last=Longley|first=Robert|date=August 23, 2016|website=thoughtco.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Business ethics ===

According to a 2016 study by Yam and Reynolds, the growing absence of the identifiable victim effect in the business world may contribute to an increase in unethical business behavior.&lt;ref name= "Yam &amp; Reynolds, 2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yam | first1 = K. C. | last2 = Reynolds | first2 = S. J. | year = 2016 | title = The effects of victim anonymity on unethical behavior | url = https://link-springer-com.proxy.library.nd.edu/article/10.1007/s10551-014-2367-5 | journal = Journal of Business Ethics | volume = 136 | issue = 1| pages = 13–22 | doi=10.1007/s10551-014-2367-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; With an increasingly [[Globalization|globalized]] business framework, the identifiable victim effect may become naturally mediated, freeing business leaders and employees alike to engage in unethical behavior without guilt or emotional distress. This may be possible because globalization results in less face-to-face contact, decreasing the identifiability of possible victims. Research suggests that business leaders, as well as workers, are more likely to engage in unethical behavior when the victims of their behavior are anonymous. At the executive level, one possible result of this is worker [[commodification]] and exploitation. At the worker level, employees of a company are possibly more likely to steal from the company or lie on a report if they do not believe this behavior will negatively affect a recognizable coworker. A decrease in recognizable coworkers could thus potentially lead to an increase in unethical behavior by workers (Yam &amp; Reynolds, 2016).&lt;ref name= "Yam &amp; Reynolds, 2016" /&gt; Research also suggests that outside observers, not only perpetrators, view unethical behavior as less unethical if the victim of the unethical behavior is unidentified (Gino, Shu, &amp; Bazerman, 2010).&lt;ref name= "Gino, Shu, &amp; Bazerman, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gino | first1 = F. | last2 = Shu | first2 = L. L. | last3 = Bazerman | first3 = M. H. | year = 2010 | title = Nameless + harmless = blameless: When seemingly irrelevant factors influence judgment of (un)ethical behavior | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com.proxy.library.nd.edu/science/article/pii/S0749597809001022 | journal = Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes | volume = 111 | issue = 2| pages = 93–101 | doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2009.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could possibly result in less public outcry against unethical practices in a globalized business environment, where the victims are often unseen.

== Moderating factors ==

=== Attachment anxiety ===

High levels of [[Attachment in adults|attachment anxiety]] may increase the power of identifiable victim effect. Research indicates that individuals with high levels of attachment anxiety may donate more to identified victims and donate less to unidentified victims than the average person (Kogut &amp; Kogut, 2013).&lt;ref name="Kogut &amp; Kogut, 2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kogut | first1 = T. | last2 = Kogut | first2 = E. | year = 2013 | title = Exploring the relationship between adult attachment style and the identifiable victim effect in helping behavior | url = http://isiarticles.com/bundles/Article/pre/pdf/73400.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = 4| pages = 651–660 | doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2013.02.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study by Kogut and Kogut, attachment anxiety may reduce the expression of [[Altruism|altruistic tendencies]], commonly demonstrated by charitable giving. Researchers hypothesize that this is because anxiously-attached individuals focus their time and energy on dealing with their own vulnerabilities, leaving them no mental energy to focus on the well-being of others. However, this would only be true of the unidentified individual. When faced with an identified victim, individuals who are anxiously attached tend to donate more money than the average individual. This aligns with past research indicating that anxiously attached people experience significantly more personal distress than those securely attached when confronted with victims in need (Mikulincer et al., 2001).&lt;ref name="Mikulincer et al., 2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mikulincer | first1 = M. | last2 = Gillath | first2 = O. | last3 = Halevy | first3 = V. | last4 = Avihou | first4 = N. | last5 = Avidan | first5 = S. | display-authors = 5 | last6 = et al | year = 2001 | title = Attachment theory and reactions to others' needs: Evidence that activation of the sense of attachment security promotes empathic responses | url = http://psycnet.apa.org.proxy.library.nd.edu/journals/psp/81/6/1205/ | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 81 | issue = 6| pages = 1205–1224 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.81.6.1205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although anxiously-attached people may participate in [[prosocial behavior]]s, such as donating money to a charity, their actions are suggested not to be the result of altruistic tendencies, but instead "positively correlated with egoistic, rather than altruistic motives for helping and volunteering."(p 652)(Kogut, T. &amp; Kogut E., 2013).&lt;ref name="Kogut &amp; Kogut, 2013" /&gt; Thus, researchers hypothesize that anxiously attached individuals are more likely to help identified victims only because they will personally benefit. This is possibly because the identified victim can fulfill the desire for personal attachment, not because the victim is in need. It is important to note that their increased helpfulness only extends to easy, effortless actions, such as donating money. It does not extend to particularly difficult or effortful actions, such as donating time (Kogut &amp; Kogut, 2013).&lt;ref name="Kogut &amp; Kogut, 2013" /&gt;

=== Guilt ===

Research suggests that guilt reduces the power of the identifiable victim effect (Yam &amp; Reynolds, 2016).&lt;ref name= "Yam &amp; Reynolds, 2016" /&gt; Before engaging in a behavior, an individual conducts an assessment of the possible emotional outcomes of that behavior. An individual is drawn towards behaviors that would make them happy and repulsed by those that would make them upset. Thus, a person with a high level of guilt is drawn towards altruistic acts because they serve to alleviate the negative emotions that they are experiencing. Consequently, the presence of guilt may actually increase the occurrence of altruistic behavior, such as charitable donations, regardless of whether the victim they are helping is identified or not. Research also suggests that anticipated guilt reduces the occurrence of unethical behavior that may negatively affect an identified victim (Yam &amp; Reynolds, 2016).&lt;ref name= "Yam &amp; Reynolds, 2016" /&gt; This may be because knowingly and negatively affecting a recognizable victim causes the individual engaging in unethical behavior to experience distress and negative emotions.

=== Reasoning style ===

Research suggests that individual differences in reasoning style moderate the identifiable victim effect (Friedrich &amp; McGuire, 2010).&lt;ref name= "Friedrich &amp; McGuire, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Friedrich | first1 = J. | last2 = McGuire | first2 = A. | year = 2010 | title = Individual differences in reasoning style as a moderator of the identifiable victim effect | url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15534511003707352 | journal = Social Influence | volume = 5 | issue = 3| pages = 182–201 | doi=10.1080/15534511003707352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two different methods of reasoning are “experiential” and “rational”. [[Cognitive-experiential self-theory#Intuitive-experiential system|Experiential thinking]] (e.g. emotionally-based thinking) is automatic, contextual and fluid, and [[Cognitive-experiential self-theory#Analytical-rational system|rational thinking]] (e.g. logically-based thinking) is deliberative, analytical, and decontextualized. Experiential thinking styles may increase the power of the identifiable victim effect, and rational thinking styles may decrease the power of the identifiable victim effect. Researchers theorize that these differences result because experiential thinkers rely on emotional responses towards an issue when making a decision. In contrast, rational thinkers analyze the situation as a whole before making a decision. Thus, a person thinking rationally would respond to all victims equally, not giving preference to those specifically named or otherwise identified, just as experiential thinkers would be drawn towards the more emotionally charged identified victim (Friedrich &amp; McGuire, 2010).&lt;ref name= "Friedrich &amp; McGuire, 2010" /&gt;

== Criticism ==
The identifiable victim effect has been contested in academia. Critics argue that, when a victim is identified, information such as age and gender of the victim are revealed and people are especially sympathetic in response to that information rather than to identifiability ''per se''.&lt;ref name= "Small &amp; Loewenstein, 2003" /&gt;

In 2003, Deborah Small and George Loewenstein conducted an experiment that mitigated this issue. Identifiability was strictly limited to the ''determination'' of the victim's identity.&lt;ref name= "Small &amp; Loewenstein, 2003" /&gt; Therefore, the victim had already been identified regardless of whether the participants had known anything specific about their identity or not. The circumstances of the victim were more palpable and thus elicited greater sympathy from participants. In contrast, the identities of statistical victims were not yet determined. As such, participants found it more difficult to sympathize with indeterminate victims.

=== Identification ===

In certain situations, identification of a victim can actually reduce the amount of help offered to that individual. Research suggests that if an individual is seen as responsible for their plight, people are less likely to offer help than if the victim was not identified at all (Kogut, 2011).&lt;ref name= "Kogut, 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kogut | first1 = T | year = 2011 | title = Someone to blame: when identifying a victim decreases helping | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.library.nd.edu/store/10.1002/bdm.492/asset/492_ftp.pdf?v=1&amp;t=j1vk6fsl&amp;s=1a3860951722425fce0c1b7d8c04c57cc7ec8f93 | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 47 | issue = 4| pages = 748–755 | doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2011.02.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most research dedicated to the identifiable victim effect avoids the topic of blame, using explicitly blameless individuals, such as children suffering from an illness (Kogut &amp; Ritov, 2005).&lt;ref name= "Kogut &amp; Ritov, 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kogut | first1 = T. | last2 = Ritov | first2 = I. | year = 2005 | title = The "identified victim" effect: an identified group, or just a single individual? | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.library.nd.edu/store/10.1002/bdm.492/asset/492_ftp.pdf?v=1&amp;t=j1vk6fsl&amp;s=1a3860951722425fce0c1b7d8c04c57cc7ec8f93 | journal = Journal of Behavioral Decision Making | volume = 18 | issue = 3| pages = 157–165 | doi=10.1002/bdm.492}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are real-world situations where victims may be seen as to blame for their current situation. For example, in a 2011 study by Kogut, individuals were less likely to offer help to an AIDS victim if the victim had contracted AIDS through sexual contact than if the individual was born with AIDS. In other words, individuals were less likely to offer help to victims if they were seen as at least partially responsible for their plight. A meta-study conducted in 2016 supports these findings, reporting that charitable donations were highest when the victim showed little responsibility for their victimization (Lee &amp; Feeley, 2016).&lt;ref name= "Lee &amp; Feeley, 2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = S. | last2 = Feeley | first2 = T. H. | year = 2016 | title = The identifiable victim effect: A meta-analytic review | url = http://www.tandfonline.com.proxy.library.nd.edu/doi/abs/10.1080/15534510.2016.1216891 | journal = Social Influence | volume = 11 | issue = 3| pages = 199–215 | doi=10.1080/15534510.2016.1216891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In such cases where victim blaming is possible, identification of individuals may not induce sympathy and may actually increase negative perception of the victim (Kogut, 2011).&lt;ref name= "Kogut, 2011" /&gt; This reduction in help is even more pronounced if the individual believes in the [[Just-world hypothesis|just world hypothesis]], which is the tendency for people to blame the victim for what has happened to them. This pattern of blame results from a desire to believe that the world is predictable and orderly and that those who suffer must have done something to deserve their suffering.

=== Individual applicability  ===

Research may indicate that the identifiable victim effect only affects identified individuals, not identified groups (Kogut &amp; Ritov, 2005).&lt;ref name= "Kogut &amp; Ritov, 2005" /&gt; A 2005 study by Kogut and Ritov asked participants how much they would be willing to donate to either a critically ill child or a group of eight critically ill children. Although identification of the individual child increased donations, identification of the group of children as a whole did not. Researchers also found that, although both the individual and group evoked similar amounts of empathy, individual victims evoked more emotional distress than groups of victims. Continuing from this, researchers hypothesized that [[Psychological pain|emotional distress]], not empathy, appears to be positively correlated with desire to help, or “willingness to contribute.” This supports the idea that altruistic acts may serve as coping mechanisms to alleviate negative emotions, such as guilt (Yam &amp; Reynolds, 2016).&lt;ref name= "Yam &amp; Reynolds, 2016" /&gt; This also supports later research that suggests distress and sympathy are the driving emotional factors behind the identifiable victim effect (Erlandsson, Björklund, &amp; Bäckström, 2015).&lt;ref name= "Erlandsson, Björklund, &amp; Bäckström, 2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Erlandsson | first1 = A. | last2 = Björklund | first2 = F. | last3 = Bäckström | first3 = M. | year = 2015 | title = Emotional reactions, perceived impact and perceived responsibility mediate the identifiable victim effect, proportion dominance effect and in-group effect respectively | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com.proxy.library.nd.edu/science/article/pii/S0749597814001022 | journal = Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes | volume = 127 | issue = | pages = 1–14 | doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2014.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''''in loco parentis''''', [[Latin]] for "in the place of a parent"&lt;ref name="law.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.law.com/default2.asp?typed=in+loco+parentis&amp;type=1&amp;submit1.x=86&amp;submit1.y=20&amp;submit1=Look+up |title=Law.com Law Dictionary - ''in loco parentis'' |accessdate=2008-09-03 |work= |publisher=Law.com |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the legal responsibility of a person or organization to take on some of the functions and responsibilities of a [[parent]].  Originally derived from English [[common law]], it is applied in two separate areas of the law.

First, it allows institutions such as colleges and schools to act in the best interests of the [[student]]s as they see fit, although not allowing what would be considered violations of the students' [[civil liberties]].&lt;ref name="law.com" /&gt;

Second, this doctrine can provide a non-biological parent to be given the legal rights and responsibilities of a biological parent if they have held themselves out as the parent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2007/02/utah-high-court-denies-parental-rights.php An example of family law ''in loco parentis''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421152559/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2007/02/utah-high-court-denies-parental-rights.php |date=21 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''in loco parentis'' doctrine is distinct from the doctrine of ''[[parens patriae]]'', the psychological parent doctrine, and [[adoption]].&lt;ref name="In Loco Parentis -- Quaqua Society"&gt;[http://www.quaqua.org/inlocoparentis.htm In Loco Parentis -- Quaqua Society&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Primary and secondary education==
[[Cheadle Hulme School]], founded in Manchester, England, in 1855, adopted ''in loco parentis'' as its motto, well before the world's first public education act, the [[Elementary Education Act 1870]]. The school was established to educate and care for orphans and children of distressed parents.

{{cn span|date=February 2017|text=''In loco parentis'' had only precedent legal meaning for [[ward of court|wards of court]]. The founding of Cheadle Hulme School, otherwise known as Manchester Warehousemen and Clerks Orphans Schools, became the first time the expression was used with legal standing in the educational field.}}

The first major limitation to this came in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case ''[[West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette]]'' (1943), in which the court ruled that students cannot be forced to salute the [[flag of the United States|American flag]].  More prominent change came in the 1960s and 1970s in such cases as ''[[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District]]'' (1969), when the Supreme Court decided that "conduct by the student, in class or out of it, which for any reason - whether it stems from time, place, or type of behavior - materially disrupts classwork or involves substantial disorder or invasion of the rights of others is, of course, not immunized by the constitutional guarantee of [[freedom of speech]]."  Adult speech is also limited by "time, place and manner" restrictions and therefore such limits do not rely on schools acting in loco parentis.

In ''[[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District]]'' (1969), the Supreme Court held that for school officials to justify censoring speech, they "must be able to show that [their] action was caused by something more than a mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint," allowing schools to forbid conduct that would "materially and substantially interfere with the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school." The Court found that the actions of the Tinkers in wearing armbands did not cause disruption and held that their activity represented constitutionally protected symbolic speech.

In ''[[New Jersey v. T.L.O.]]'' (1985) Justice White wrote:  "In carrying out searches and other disciplinary functions pursuant to such policies, school officials act as representatives of the State, not merely as surrogates for the parents, and they cannot claim the parents' immunity from the strictures of the Fourth Amendment."  The case upheld the search of a purse while on public school property based upon reasonable suspicion, indicating there is a balancing between the student's legitimate [[expectation of privacy]] and the public school's interest in maintaining order and discipline.   However, in ''[[Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier]]'' (1987) the Supreme Court ruled that "[[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights of students in the public schools are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings, and must be applied in light of the special characteristics of the school environment" and schools may censor school-sponsored publications (such as a school newspaper) if content is "...inconsistent with its basic educational mission."  Other student issues such as school [[dress code]]s along with locker, cell phone, and personal laptop computer searches by public school officials have not yet been tested in the Supreme Court.

Private institutions are given significantly more authority over their students than public ones, and are generally allowed to arbitrarily dictate rules.  In the [[Kentucky Supreme Court|Kentucky State Supreme Court]] case ''[[Gott v. Berea College]]'' (1913), it was upheld that a "college or university may prescribe requirements for admission and rules for the conduct of its students, and one who enters as a student implicitly agrees to conform to such rules of government", while publicly funded institutions could not claim the same ability.

In ''Morse v. Frederick'' (2007) Justice [[Clarence Thomas]], concurring with the majority, argued that ''Tinker's'' ruling contradicted "the traditional understanding of the judiciary's role in relation to public schooling," and ignored the history of public education (127 S.Ct. 2634).  He believed the judiciary's role to determine whether students have freedom of expression was limited by ''in loco parentis''.  He cited ''[[Lander v. Seaver]]'' (1859), which held that ''in loco parentis'' allowed schools to punish student expression that the school or teacher believed contradicted the school's interests and educational goals.  This ruling declared that the only restriction the doctrine imposed were acts of legal malice or acts that caused permanent injury.  Neither of these were the case with Tinker.

==Higher education==
Though ''in loco parentis'' continues to apply to primary and secondary education in the U.S., application of the concept has largely disappeared in [[higher education]]. This was not always the case.

Prior to the 1960s, undergraduates were subject to many restrictions on their private lives. Women were generally subject to [[curfew]]s as early as 10:00, and dormitories were sex-segregated. Some universities expelled students—especially female students—who were somehow "morally" undesirable. More importantly, universities saw fit to restrict [[freedom of speech]], on campus, often forbidding organizations out of favor or with different views from speaking, organizing, demonstrating, or otherwise acting on campus. These restrictions were severely criticized by the student movements of the 1960s, and the [[Free Speech Movement]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] formed partly on account of them, inspiring students elsewhere to step up their opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Movement and the Sixties |last=Anderson |first=Terry H. |authorlink=Terry H. Anderson |year=1996|publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-510457-8 |pages= }}{{page needed|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The landmark 1961 case ''[[Dixon v. Alabama]]'' was the beginning of the end for ''in loco parentis'' in U.S. higher education.  The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] found that [[Alabama State University|Alabama State College]] could not summarily expel students without due process.  However, that still does not prevent students who exercise their rights from being subject to more legal action for violation of institutional rules.&lt;ref name=bluto&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hoover |first=Eric |date=5 September 2008 |title='Animal House' at 30: O Bluto, Where Art Thou? |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Animal-House-at-30-O/28169 |journal=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |volume=55 |issue=2 |pages=34–35}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13126">In the context of an evolving [[information society]], the term '''information ecology''' marks a connection between [[ecology|ecological]] ideas with the dynamics and properties of the increasingly dense, complex and important digital informational environment and has been gaining acceptance in a growing number of disciplines. "Information ecology" often is used as [[metaphor]], viewing the informational space as an [[ecosystem]].

Information ecology is a science which studies the laws governing the influence of information summary on the formation and functioning of [[biosystem]]s, including that of individuals, human [[communities]] and humanity in general and on the health and psychological, physical and social well-being of the human being; and which undertakes to develop methodologies to improve the information environment {{Harv|Eryomin|1998}}.

Information ecology also makes a connection to the concept of [[collective intelligence]] and [[knowledge ecology]] {{Harv|Pór|2000}}.  Eddy et. al. (2014) use information ecology for science-policy integration in ecosystems-based management (EBM).

==Language of ecology==
Information ecology draws on the language of ecology - [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]], [[species]], [[evolution]], [[ecosystem]], [[ecological niche|niche]], growth, equilibrium, etc. - to describe and analyze [[information systems]] from a perspective that considers the distribution and abundance of [[organism]]s, their relationships with each other, and how they influence and are influenced by their [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. The virtual lack of boundaries between information systems and the impact of [[information technology]] on economic, social and environmental activities frequently calls on an [[information ecologist]] to consider local information ecosystems in the context of larger systems, and of the evolution of global information ecosystems. See also [[list of ecology topics]].

== Networked information economy ==

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yochai Benkler]] provides an analytic framework for the emergence of the networked [[information economy]] that draws deeply on the language and perspectives of information ecology together with observations and analyses of high-visibility examples of successful [[peer production]] processes, citing Wikipedia as a prime example.

[[Bonnie Nardi]] and [[Vicki O'Day]] in their book "Information Ecologies: Using Technology with Heart,"  {{Harv|Nardi|O’Day|1999}} apply the ecology metaphor to local environments, such as libraries and schools, in preference to the more common metaphors for technology as tool, text, or system.

== In different domains / disciplines ==

=== Anthropology ===
Nardi and O’Day’s book represents the first specific treatment of information ecology by anthropologists. H.E. Kuchka&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kuchka.org/information-ecology|title=Information Ecology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; situates information within socially-distributed cognition of cultural systems. Casagrande and Peters&lt;ref&gt;Casagrande, D.G., &amp; C. Peters. 2013. Ecomyopia meets the longue durée: An information ecology of the increasingly arid Southwestern United States. Pp. 97-144 in H. Kopnina &amp; E. Shoreman (Eds.), Environmental Anthropology: Future Directions. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; use information ecology for an anthropological critique of Southwest US water policy. Stepp (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kuchka.org/sites/default/files/stepp.pdf |title=Data |website=kuchka.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; published a prospectus for the anthropological study of information ecology.

=== Knowledge management ===
Information ecology was used as book title by Thomas H. Davenport and Laurence Prusak {{Harv|Davenport|Prusak|1997}}, with a focus on the organization dimensions of information ecology. There was also an academic research project at [[Distributed Systems Technology Centre|DSTC]] called ''Information ecology'', concerned with distributed information systems and online communities.

=== Law ===
Law schools represent another area where the phrase is gaining increasing acceptance, e.g.
NYU Law School Conference Towards a Free Information Ecology&lt;ref&gt;
Conference [http://www1.law.nyu.edu/ili/conferences/freeinfo2000/aboutconf/index.html A Free Information Ecology in the Digital Environment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329043908/http://www.law.nyu.edu/ili/conferences/freeinfo2000/aboutconf/index.html |date=2009-03-29 }}, New York University School of Law, March 31, 2000 to Sunday, April 2, 2000
&lt;/ref&gt;  and a lecture series on Information ecology at Duke University Law School's [[Center for the Study of the Public Domain]].

=== Library science ===
The field of [[library science]] has seen significant adoption of the term and librarians have been described by Nardi and O'Day as a "keystone species in information ecology",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/digiref/archive/nardi.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-12-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060307005156/http://www.loc.gov/rr/digiref/archive/nardi.html |archive-date=2006-03-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/sfsla/bulletin/sepoct00/info_ecology.html |accessdate=April 2, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040502182859/http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/sfsla/bulletin/sepoct00/info_ecology.html |archivedate=May 2, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and references to information ecology range as far afield as the Collaborative Digital Reference Service of the Library of Congress,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/digiref/source/CDRS-KB-CNI.PPT |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-12-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060307010141/http://www.loc.gov/rr/digiref/source/CDRS-KB-CNI.PPT |archive-date=2006-03-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to children's library database administrator in Russia.

=== Biology ===
There has also been increasing use of "information ecology" as a concept among ecologists involved in digital mapping of botanical resources, including research by Zhang Xinshi at the Institute of Botany of the China Academy of Science; also see a presentation to the Information Ecology SIG at Yale University's Forestry School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/files/dpu-pip/ien-iie.ppt]{{Dead link|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human Ecology ===
From the analysis of specific examples of the nature and physiology are determined 10 axioms and laws of information ecology, which serves as the basis for creating information strategies and tactics in social, economic, political and other spheres that affect [[human health]] and human communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291074682_Eryomin_AL_Nature_and_Physiology_of_the_Informational_Human_Ecology_Ecology_of_Human_-_2000_-_No2_-_P55-60_Eremin_AL_Priroda_i_fiziologia_informacionnoj_ekologii_celoveka_Ekologia_celoveka_-_2000_-_No|title=Eryomin A.L.

=== Science-Policy Integration (SPI) / Ecosystems-Based Management (EBM) ===
Eddy et. al. (2014) use principles of information ecology to develop a framework for integrating scientific information in decision-making in ecosystem-based management (EBM).  Using a metaphor of how a species adapts to environmental changes through information processing, they developed a 3-tiered model that differentiates primary, secondary and tertiary levels of information processing, within both the technical and human domains.

'''Karamanlı Turkish''' is both a form of written Turkish, and a dialect of [[Turkish language|Turkish]] spoken by the [[Karamanlides]], a community of Turkish-speaking [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]] in [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Turkey. While the official Ottoman Turkish was written in the [[Arabic script]], the Karamanlides used the [[Greek alphabet]] for writing its form of Turkish. Such texts are called '''Karamanlidika''' (Καραμανλήδικα / Καραμανλήδεια γραφή) or '''Karamanli Turkish''' today. Karamanli Turkish had its own literary tradition and produced numerous published works in print in the 19th century, some of them published by Evangelinos Misailidis, by the Anatoli or Misailidis publishing house (Misailidis 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;134).

Karamanli writers and speakers were expelled from Turkey as part of the [[Greek-Turkish population exchange]] of 1923. Some speakers preserved their language in the diaspora. The writing form stopped being used immediately after the Turkish state adopted the Latin alphabet.

A fragment of a Manuscript written in Karamanli was also found in the [[Cairo Geniza]].&lt;ref&gt;Julia Krivoruchko Karamanli – a new language variety in the Genizah: T-S AS 215.255 http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/Taylor-Schechter/fotm/july-2012/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Loneliness''' is a complex and usually unpleasant [[emotion]]al response to [[Social isolation|isolation]]. Loneliness typically includes anxious feelings about a lack of [[Interpersonal relationship|connection]] or [[communication]] with other beings, both in the present and extending into the future. As such, loneliness can be felt even when surrounded by other people. The causes of loneliness are varied and include social, mental, emotional, and physical factors.

Research has shown that loneliness is prevalent throughout society, including people in marriages, relationships, families, veterans, and those with successful careers.&lt;ref name="Peplau, L.A. 1982 pp. 1-18"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Peplau |first1=L.A. |last2=Perlman |first2=D. |year=1982 |chapter=Perspectives on loneliness |editor1-first=Letitia Anne |editor1-last=Peplau |editor2-first=Daniel |editor2-last=Perlman |title=Loneliness: A sourcebook of current theory, research and therapy |pages=1–18 |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=978-0-471-08028-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been a long explored theme in the literature of human beings since classical antiquity. Loneliness has also been described as [[social pain]]—a psychological mechanism meant to motivate an individual to seek social connections.&lt;ref name="Science of Loneliness.com"&gt;Cacioppo, John; [[William Patrick, author|Patrick, William]], ''Loneliness: Human Nature and the Need for Social Connection'', New York : W.W. Norton &amp; Co., 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-393-06170-3}}.

==Common causes==
People can experience loneliness for many reasons, and many life events may cause it, such as a lack of [[friendship]] relations during [[childhood]] and [[adolescence]], or the physical absence of meaningful people around a person. At the same time, loneliness may be a symptom of another [[social]] or [[Psychology|psychological]] problem, such as [[Dysthymia|chronic depression]].

Many people experience loneliness for the first time when they are left alone as [[infants]]. It is also a very common, though normally temporary, consequence of a [[Relationship breakup|breakup]], [[divorce]], or loss of any important [[long-term relationship]]. In these cases, it may stem both from the loss of a specific person and from the withdrawal from [[social circle]]s caused by the event or the associated sadness.

The loss of a significant person in one's life will typically initiate a [[grief|grief response]]; in this situation, one might feel lonely, even while in the company of others. Loneliness may also occur after the birth of a [[child]] (often expressed in [[postpartum depression]]), after [[marriage]], or following any other socially disruptive event, such as moving from one's home town into an unfamiliar [[community]], leading to [[homesickness]]. Loneliness can occur within unstable [[marriages]] or other close [[interpersonal relationship|relationships]] of a similar nature, in which feelings present may include [[anger]] or [[resentment]], or in which the feeling of [[love]] cannot be given or received. Loneliness may represent a dysfunction of [[Interpersonal communication|communication]], and can also result from places with low [[Population density|population densities]] in which there are comparatively few people to interact with. Loneliness can also be seen as a [[social phenomenon]], capable of spreading like a disease. When one person in a group begins to feel lonely, this feeling can spread to others, increasing everybody's risk for feelings of loneliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Parker |first=Pope |url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/01/why-loneliness-can-be-contagious/ |title=Why loneliness can be contagious |accessdate=10 December 2012 |work=The New York Times |date=1 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; People can feel lonely even when they are surrounded by other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1943748,00.html#ixzz0YZghiRRl |title=Feeling Alone Together: How Loneliness Spreads |publisher=Time.com |date=1 December 2009 |accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[twin study]] found evidence that [[genetics]] account for approximately half of the measurable differences in loneliness among adults, which was similar to the heritability estimates found previously in children. These genes operate in a similar manner in males and females. The study found no common environmental contributions to adult loneliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10519-005-6040-8 |title=Genetic and Environmental Contributions to Loneliness in Adults: The Netherlands Twin Register Study |year=2005 |last1=Boomsma |first1=Dorret I. |last2=Willemsen |first2=Gonneke |last3=Dolan |first3=Conor V. |last4=Hawkley |first4=Louise C. |last5=Cacioppo |first5=John T. |journal=Behavior Genetics |volume=35 |issue=6 |pages=745–52 |pmid=16273322|citeseerx=10.1.1.453.498 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typology==

===Feeling lonely vs. being socially isolated===
There is a clear distinction between feeling lonely and being socially isolated (for example, a [[loner]]). In particular, one way of thinking about loneliness is as a discrepancy between one's necessary and achieved levels of [[Interpersonal relationship|social interaction]],&lt;ref name="Peplau, L.A. 1982 pp. 1-18"/&gt; while [[solitude]] is simply the lack of contact with people. Loneliness is therefore a subjective experience; if a person thinks they are lonely, then they are lonely. People can be lonely while in solitude, or in the middle of a crowd. What makes a person lonely is the fact that they need more social interaction or a certain type of social interaction that is not currently available. A person can be in the middle of a party and feel lonely due to not talking to enough people. Conversely, one can be alone and not feel lonely; even though there is no one around that person is not lonely because there is no desire for social interaction. There have also been suggestions that each person has their own optimal level of social interaction. If a person gets too little or too much social interaction, this could lead to feelings of loneliness or [[over-stimulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Suedfeld |first1=P. |year=1989 |chapter=Past the reflection and through the looking-glass: Extending loneliness research |editor1-first=M. |editor1-last=Hojat |editor2-first=R. |editor2-last=Crandall |title=Loneliness: Theory, research and applications |pages=51–6 |location=Newbury Park, California |publisher=Sage Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solitude can have positive effects on individuals. One [[Research|study]] found that, although time spent alone tended to depress a person's mood and increase feelings of loneliness, it also helped to improve their [[Cognition|cognitive state]], such as improving [[Attention|concentration]]. Furthermore, once the alone time was over, people's moods tended to increase significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Larson |first1=R. |last2=Csikszentmihalyi |first2=M. |last3=Graef |first3=R. |year=1982 |chapter=Time alone in daily experience: Loneliness or renewal? |editor1-first=Letitia Anne |editor1-last=Peplau |editor2-first=Daniel |editor2-last=Perlman |title=Loneliness: A sourcebook of current theory, research and therapy |pages=41–53 |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=978-0-471-08028-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solitude is also associated with other positive growth experiences, [[Religion|religious]] experiences, and [[Identity (social science)|identity]] building such as solitary quests used in [[rites of passage]]s for adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Suedfeld |first1=P. |year=1982 |chapter=Aloneness as a healing experience |editor1-first=Letitia Anne |editor1-last=Peplau |editor2-first=Daniel |editor2-last=Perlman |title=Loneliness: A sourcebook of current theory, research and therapy |pages=54–67 |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=978-0-471-08028-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loneliness can also play an important role in the [[creativity|creative]] process. In some people, temporary or prolonged loneliness can lead to notable [[art]]istic and creative expression, for example, as was the case with [[poet]]s [[Emily Dickinson]] and [[Isabella di Morra]], and numerous [[musician]]s{{Who|date=May 2017}}. This is not to imply that loneliness itself ensures this creativity, rather, it may have an influence on the subject matter of the artist and more likely be present in individuals engaged in creative activities.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===Transient vs. chronic loneliness===
The other important typology of loneliness focuses on the [[time]] perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=de Jong-Gierveld |first1=J. |last2=Raadschelders |first2=J. |year=1982 |chapter=Types of loneliness |editor1-first=Letitia Anne |editor1-last=Peplau |editor2-first=Daniel |editor2-last=Perlman |title=Loneliness: A sourcebook of current theory, research and therapy |pages=105–19 |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=978-0-471-08028-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect, loneliness can be viewed as either [[wikt:transient|transient]] or [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]]. It has also been referred to as state and trait loneliness.

Transient (state) loneliness is temporary in nature, caused by something in the environment, and is easily relieved. Chronic (trait) loneliness is more permanent, caused by the person, and is not easily relieved.&lt;ref&gt;Duck, S. (1992). Human relations (2nd ed.).  London: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when a person is sick and cannot socialize with friends would be a case of transient loneliness. Once the person got better it would be easy for them to alleviate their loneliness. A person who feels lonely regardless of if they are at a family gathering, with friends, or alone is experiencing chronic loneliness. It does not matter what goes on in the surrounding environment, the experience of loneliness is always there.

===Loneliness as a human condition===
The [[existentialist]] school of thought views loneliness as the essence of being [[human]]. Each human being comes into the world alone, travels through life as a separate person, and ultimately dies alone. Coping with this, accepting it, and learning how to direct our own lives with some degree of grace and satisfaction is the [[human condition]].&lt;ref name="Exist"&gt;''[http://www.philosophicalsociety.com/Archives/An%20Existential%20View%20Of%20Loneliness.htm An Existential View of Loneliness]'' - Carter, Michele; excerpt from ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20111007024245/http://www.parkridgecenter.org/Page437.html Abiding Loneliness: An Existential Perspective]'', Park Ridge Center, September 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[philosopher]]s, such as [[Sartre]], believe in an epistemic loneliness in which loneliness is a fundamental part of the human condition because of the paradox between people's consciousness desiring [[Meaning of life|meaning in life]] and the isolation and nothingness of the [[universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tomšik |first1=Robert |title=Relationship of loneliness and meaning of life among adolescents. In Current Trends in Educational Science and Practice VIII : International Proceedings of Scientific Studies |date=2015 |publisher=UKF |location=Nitra |isbn=978-80-558-0813-0 |pages=66-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, other existentialist thinkers argue that human beings might be said to actively engage each other and the universe as they communicate and create, and loneliness is merely the feeling of being cut off from this process.

==Frequency==
There are several estimates and indicators of loneliness. It has been estimated that approximately 60 million people in the [[United States]], or 20% of the total population, feel lonely.&lt;ref name="Science of Loneliness.com"/&gt; Another study found that 12% of Americans have no one with whom to spend free time or to discuss important matters.&lt;ref&gt;Christakis, N. A. &amp; Fowler, J. H. (2009). Connected: The surprising power of our social networks and how they shape our lives. New York, NY: Little, Brown and Company.{{page needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research suggests that this rate has been increasing over time. The ''General Social Survey'' found that between 1985 and 2004, the number of people the average American discusses important matters with decreased from three to two. Additionally, the number of Americans with no one to discuss important matters with tripled&lt;ref&gt;Olds, J. &amp; Schwartz, R. S. (2009). ''The lonely American: Drifting apart in the 21st century''. Boston, MA: Beacon Press{{page needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (though this particular study may be flawed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://asr.sagepub.com/content/74/4/657.abstract|title=The 2004 GSS Finding of Shrunken Social Networks: An Artifact?|volume=74|issue=4|pages=657–669|work=sagepub.com|doi=10.1177/000312240907400408|year=2009|last1=Fischer|first1=Claude S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  In the UK research by [[Age UK]] shows half a million people more than 60 years old spend each day alone without social interaction and almost half a million more see and speak to no one for 5 or 6 days a week.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/06/half-a-million-older-people-spend-every-day-alone-poll-shows  Half a million older people spend every day alone, poll shows] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the ''Community Life Survey, 2016 to 2017'', by the UK's [[Office for National Statistics]], found that young adults in [[England]] aged 16 to 24 reported feeling lonely more often than those in older age groups.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/articles/lonelinesswhatcharacteristicsandcircumstancesareassociatedwithfeelinglonely/2018-04-10 Loneliness - What characteristics and circumstances are associated with feeling lonely?] Analysis of characteristics and circumstances associated with loneliness in England using the Community Life Survey, 2016 to 2017. Published by the ''Office for National Statistics''. Published 10 April 2018. Retrieved 25 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Loneliness appears to have intensified in every society in the world as modernization occurs. A certain amount of this loneliness appears to be related to greater migration, smaller household sizes, a larger degree of [[media consumption]] (all of which have positive sides as well in the form of more opportunities, more choice in family size, and better access to information), all of which relates to [[social capital]].

Within [[Developed country|developed nations]], loneliness has shown the largest increases among two groups: seniors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://seniorjournal.com/NEWS/Aging/5-11-21-SeniorsAreLonely.htm |title=Most Senior Citizens Experience Loneliness, Say Researchers |accessdate=2012-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226045830/http://seniorjournal.com/NEWS/Aging/5-11-21-SeniorsAreLonely.htm |archivedate=26 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isolatedseniors.ca/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815113613/http://isolatedseniors.ca/ |archivedate=15 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and people living in low-density suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetizen.com/node/49370|title=Isolation and Dissatisfaction in the Suburbs|work=Planetizen:  The Urban Planning, Design, and Development Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geog.ubc.ca/~ewyly/u200/suburbia.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Seniors living in suburban areas are particularly vulnerable, for as they lose the ability to drive, they often become "stranded" and find it difficult to maintain [[interpersonal relationship]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.governing.com/topics/transportation-infrastructure/Stranded-Seniors.html|title=Stranded Seniors|work=governing.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loneliness is prevalent in vulnerable groups in society.  In New Zealand the fourteen surveyed groups with the highest prevalence of loneliness most/all of the time in descending order are: disabled, recent migrants, low income households, unemployed, single parents, rural (rest of South Island), seniors aged 75+, not in the labour force, youth aged 15-24, no qualifications, not housing owner-occupier, not in a family nucleus, Māori, and low personal income.&lt;ref name="Loneliness NZ"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Comber |first1=Cathy |title=Ms |url=https://www.loneliness.org.nz/nz/facts/loneliness-prevalent-in-the-vulnerable/ |website=www.loneliness.org.nz |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Americans seem to report more loneliness than any other country, though this finding may simply be an effect of greater research volume. A 2006 study in the ''[[American Sociological Review]]'' found that Americans on average had only two close friends in which to confide, which was down from an average of three in 1985. The percentage of people who noted having no such [[confidant]] rose from 10% to almost 25%, and an additional 19% said they had only a single confidant, often their [[spouse]], thus raising the risk of serious loneliness if the relationship ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1177/000312240607100301 |title=Social Isolation in America: Changes in Core Discussion Networks over Two Decades |year=2006 |last1=McPherson |first1=M. |last2=Smith-Lovin |first2=L. |last3=Brashears |first3=M. E. |journal=American Sociological Review |volume=71 |issue=3 |pages=353–75|citeseerx=10.1.1.101.6700 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern office environment has been demonstrated to give rise to loneliness. This can be especially prevalent in individuals prone to social isolation who can interpret the business focus of co-workers for a deliberate ignoring of needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Sarah|title=Loneliness in the Workplace|date=16 May 2008|publisher=VDM Verlag Dr. Mull Ed Beasleyschaft &amp; Co.|isbn=978-3-639-02734-1}}{{page needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether a [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]] exists between [[Internet]] usage and loneliness is a subject of controversy, with some findings showing that Internet users are lonelier&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Carole |last=Hughes |year=1999 |title=The relationship of use of the Internet and loneliness among college students |type=PhD Thesis |publisher=Boston College |oclc=313894784}}{{page needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others showing that lonely people who use the Internet to keep in touch with loved ones (especially seniors) report less loneliness, but that those trying to make friends online became lonelier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1089/cpb.2007.0010 |title=Internet Use and Loneliness in Older Adults |year=2008 |last1=Sum |first1=Shima |last2=Mathews |first2=R.

The one apparently unequivocal finding of correlation is that long driving commutes correlate with dramatically higher reported feelings of loneliness (as well as other negative health impacts).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2011/05/your_commute_is_killing_you.html{{full citation needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/04/16/070416fa_fact_paumgarten?currentPage=3{{full citation needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==

===Mental health===
[[File:Thoma Loneliness.jpg|thumb|''Loneliness'' by [[Hans Thoma]] ([[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]] in [[Warsaw]])]]

Loneliness has been linked with [[depression (mood)|depression]], and is thus a risk factor for [[suicide]].&lt;ref name="PsychTo"&gt;''[https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/articles/200307/the-dangers-loneliness The Dangers of Loneliness]'' - Marano, Hara Estroff; ''[[Psychology Today]]'' Thursday 21 August 2003&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Durkheim]] has described loneliness, specifically the inability or unwillingness to live for others, i.e. for friendships or altruistic ideas, as the main reason for what he called ''egoistic suicide''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Polina |last=Shelkova |year=2010 |title=Loneliness |url=http://www.vzmakh.ru/refero/english/2009-2010/loneless.doc}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=July 2013}} In adults, loneliness is a major precipitant of depression and [[alcoholism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Marano |first=Hara |title=The Dangers of Loneliness |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200308/the-dangers-loneliness |accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who are socially isolated may report poor [[sleep]] quality, and thus have diminished restorative processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0889-1591(02)00073-9 |title=Loneliness and pathways to disease |year=2003 |last1=Hawkley |first1=Louise C |last2=Cacioppo |first2=John T |journal=Brain, Behavior, and Immunity |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=98–105 |pmid=12615193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loneliness has also been linked with a [[Schizoid personality disorder|schizoid character type]] in which one may see the world differently and experience [[social alienation]], described as ''the self in exile''.&lt;ref name=Klein&gt;{{cite book |title=Disorders of the Self: Secret Pure Schizoid Cluster Disorder |year=1995 |pages=25–7 |last1=Masterson |first1=James F. |last2=Klein |first2=Ralph |quote=Klein was Clinical Director of the Masterson Institute and Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York |authorlink1=James F. Masterson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[children]], a lack of social connections is directly linked to several forms of [[Anti-social behaviour|antisocial]] and [[self-destructive]] behavior, most notably [[Hostility|hostile]] and [[juvenile delinquency|delinquent]] behavior. In both children and adults, loneliness often has a negative impact on [[learning]] and [[memory]]. Its disruption of [[sleep]] patterns can have a significant impact on the ability to function in everyday life.&lt;ref name="PsychTo"/&gt;

Research from a large-scale study published in the journal [[Psychological Medicine]], showed that "lonely [[millennial]]s are more likely to have mental health problems, be out of work and feel pessimistic about their ability to succeed in life than their peers who feel connected to others, regardless of gender or wealth".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/apr/24/loneliness-linked-to-major-life-setbacks-for-millennials-study-says Loneliness linked to major life setbacks for millennials, study says].

Pain, depression, and fatigue function as a symptom cluster and thus may share common risk factors. Two longitudinal studies with different populations demonstrated that loneliness was a risk factor for the development of the pain, depression, and fatigue symptom cluster over time.  These data also highlight the health risks of loneliness; pain, depression, and fatigue often accompany serious illness and place people at risk for poor health and mortality.&lt;ref&gt;Jaremka, L.M., Andridge, R.R., Fagundes, C.P., Alfano, C.M., Povoski, S.P., Lipari, A.M., Agnese, D.M., Arnold, M.W., Farrar, W.B., Yee, L.D.

Health Psychology, 38, 1310-1317.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical health===
Chronic loneliness can be a serious, life-threatening health condition. It has been found to be associated with an increased risk of [[stroke]] and [[cardiovascular disease]].&lt;ref name="pfizer"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Loneliness and Isolation: Modern Health Risks|url = http://www.thepfizerjournal.com/default.asp?a=article&amp;j=tpj15&amp;t=Loneliness%20and%20Isolation%3A%20Modern%20Health%20Risks|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060128104835/http://www.thepfizerjournal.com/default.asp?a=article&amp;j=tpj15&amp;t=Loneliness%20and%20Isolation%3A%20Modern%20Health%20Risks|archivedate = 28 January 2006|journal = The Pfizer Journal|year = 2000|volume = IV|issue = 4|postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loneliness shows an increased incidence of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and obesity.&lt;ref name="Cacioppo, J 2010 p218-227"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cacioppo | first1 = J. | last2 = Hawkley | first2 = L. | year = 2010 | title = Loneliness Matters: A Theorectical and Empirical Review of Consequences and Mechanisms | url = | journal = Annals of Behavioral Medicine | volume = 40 | issue = 2| pages = 218–227 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loneliness is shown to increase the concentration of [[cortisol]] levels in the body.&lt;ref name="Cacioppo, J 2010 p218-227"/&gt; Prolonged, high cortisol levels can cause anxiety, depression, digestive problems, heart disease, sleep problems, and weight gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/stress-management/in-depth/stress/art-20046037|title=Chronic stress puts your health at risk|publisher=|accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

″Loneliness has been associated with impaired cellular immunity as reflected in lower [[Natural killer cell|natural killer (NK) cell]] activity and higher antibody titers to the Epstein Barr Virus and human herpes viruses".&lt;ref name="Cacioppo, J 2010 p218-227"/&gt; Because of impaired cellular immunity, loneliness among young adults shows vaccines, like the flu vaccine, to be less effective.&lt;ref name="Cacioppo, J 2010 p218-227"/&gt; Data from studies on loneliness and HIV positive men suggests loneliness increases disease progression.&lt;ref name="Cacioppo, J 2010 p218-227"/&gt;

===Physiological mechanisms link to poor health===

There are a number of potential physiological mechanisms linking loneliness to poor health outcomes. In 2005, results from the American ''[[Framingham Heart Study]]'' demonstrated that lonely men had raised levels of [[Interleukin 6|Interleukin 6 (IL-6)]], a blood chemical linked to [[heart disease]]. A 2006 study conducted by the ''Center for Cognitive and Social Neuroscience'' at the [[University of Chicago]] found loneliness can add thirty points to a blood pressure reading for adults over the age of fifty. Another finding, from a survey conducted by [[John Cacioppo]] from the [[University of Chicago]], is that doctors report providing better [[Health care|medical care]] to patients who have a strong network of family and friends than they do to patients who are alone. Cacioppo states that loneliness impairs [[cognition]] and [[will (philosophy)|willpower]], alters [[DNA]] [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] in [[White blood cell|immune cells]], and leads over time to [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]].&lt;ref name="Science of Loneliness.com"/&gt; Lonelier people are more likely to show evidence of viral reactivation than less lonely people.&lt;ref name = "Ja_herpesvirus"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.psyneuen.2012.11.016 |title=Loneliness predicts pain, depression, and fatigue: Understanding the role of immune dysregulation |year=2013 |last1=Jaremka |first1=Lisa M. |last2=Fagundes |first2=Christopher P. |last3=Glaser |first3=Ronald |last4=Bennett |first4=Jeanette M. |last5=Malarkey |first5=William B. |last6=Kiecolt-Glaser |first6=Janice K. |journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology |volume=38 |issue=8 |pages=1310–7 |pmid=23273678 |pmc=3633610}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lonelier people also have stronger inflammatory responses to acute stress compared with less lonely people; inflammation is a well known risk factor for age-related diseases.&lt;ref name = "Ja_inflammation"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0956797612464059 |title=Loneliness Promotes Inflammation During Acute Stress |year=2013 |last1=Jaremka |first1=Lisa M. |last2=Fagundes |first2=Christopher P. |last3=Peng |first3=Juan |last4=Bennett |first4=Jeanette M. |last5=Glaser |first5=Ronald |last6=Malarkey |first6=William B. |last7=Kiecolt-Glaser |first7=Janice K. |journal=Psychological Science |volume=24 |issue=7 |pages=1089–97 |pmid=23630220 |pmc=3825089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When someone feels left out of a situation, they feel excluded and one possible side effect is for their body temperature to decrease. When people feel excluded blood vessels at the periphery of the body may narrow, preserving core body heat. This class protective mechanism is known as vasoconstriction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ijzerman|first=Hans|title=Getting the cold shoulder|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/09/opinion/sunday/the-chill-of-loneliness.html|accessdate=1 November 2012|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatments and prevention==
There are many different ways used to treat loneliness, [[social isolation]], and [[clinical depression]]. The first step that most doctors recommend to patients is [[therapy]]. Therapy is a common and effective way of treating loneliness and is often successful. Short-term therapy, the most common form for lonely or depressed patients, typically occurs over a period of ten to twenty weeks. During therapy, emphasis is put on understanding the cause of the problem, reversing the negative thoughts, feelings, and attitudes resulting from the problem, and exploring ways to help the patient feel connected. Some doctors also recommend [[group therapy]] as a means to connect with other sufferers and establish a support system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.depression.com/psychotherapy.html |title=Psychotherapy |accessdate=29 March 2008 |work=Depression.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Doctors also frequently prescribe [[anti-depressants]] to patients as a stand-alone treatment, or in conjunction with therapy. It may take several attempts before a suitable anti-depressant medication is found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=The Truth About Antidepressants | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.webmd.com/depression/features/truth-about-antidepressants?page=2 | work =WebMD | pages = | accessdate = 30 March 2008 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative approaches to treating depression are suggested by many doctors. These treatments include [[exercise]], [[dieting]], [[hypnosis]], [[electro-shock therapy]], [[acupuncture]], and [[herbal remedies|herbs]], amongst others. Many patients find that participating in these activities fully or partially alleviates symptoms related to depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Alternative treatments for depression | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.webmd.com/depression/alternative-therapies-depression?page=2 | work =WebMD | pages = | accessdate = 30 March 2008 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Paro robot.jpg|thumb|[[Paro (robot)|Paro]], a robot pet seal classified as a medical device by U.S. regulators]]
Another treatment for both loneliness and depression is [[pet]] therapy, or [[animal-assisted therapy]], as it is more formally known. Studies and surveys, as well as [[anecdotal evidence]] provided by volunteer and community organizations, indicate that the presence of animal companions such as [[dog]]s, [[cat]]s, [[rabbit]]s, and [[guinea pig]]s can ease feelings of depression and loneliness among some sufferers. Beyond the companionship the animal itself provides there may also be increased opportunities for socializing with other pet owners. According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] there are a number of other health benefits associated with pet ownership, including lowered [[blood pressure]] and decreased levels of [[cholesterol]] and [[triglycerides]].&lt;ref name="Pets"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/health_benefits.htm Health Benefits of Pets] (from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]). Retrieved 14 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nostalgia]] has also been found to have a restorative effect, counteracting loneliness by increasing perceived social support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02194.x |title=Counteracting Loneliness: On the Restorative Function of Nostalgia |year=2008 |last1=Zhou |first1=Xinyue |last2=Sedikides |first2=Constantine |last3=Wildschut |first3=Tim |last4=Gao |first4=Ding-Guo |journal=Psychological Science |volume=19 |issue=10 |pages=1023–9 |pmid=19000213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1989 study found that the social aspect of [[religion]] had a significant negative association with loneliness among [[elderly]] people. The effect was more consistent than the effect of social relationships with family and friends, and the subjective concept of [[religiosity]] had no significant effect on loneliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/073346488900800109 |title=Religiosity and Loneliness Among the Elderly |year=1989 |last1=Johnson |first1=D. P. |last2=Mullins |first2=L. C. |journal=Journal of Applied Gerontology |volume=8 |pages=110–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study compared the effectiveness of four interventions: improving social skills, enhancing social support, increasing opportunities for social interaction, addressing abnormal social cognition (faulty thoughts and patterns of thoughts). The results of the study indicated that all interventions were effective in reducing loneliness, possibly with the exception of social skill training. Results of the meta-analysis suggest that correcting maladaptive social cognition offers the best chance of reducing loneliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1088868310377394 |title=A Meta-Analysis of Interventions to Reduce Loneliness |year=2010 |last1=Masi |first1=C.

The soil salinity on the ''x''-axis is represented by electric conductivity (ECe). In this example the crop has a salt tolerance (threshold) of ECe&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;Pb&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp;dS/m beyond which the yield diminishes.]]

The '''Maas–Hoffman model''' is a mathematical tool to characterize the relation between [[crop production]] and [[soil salinity]]. It describes the crop response by a broken line of which the first part is horizontal and the second is sloping downward.&lt;ref&gt;Maas EV, Hoffman GJ, 1977. ''Crop salt tolerance-current assessment''. Journal of the Irrigation and Drainage Division, American Society of Civil Engineers 103: 115-134.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''breakpoint'' (Pb) or ''threshold'' is also called ''tolerance'' because up to that point the yield is unaffected by the salinity, so the salt is tolerated, while at greater salinity values the crops are affected negatively and the yield goes down.

==Mathematics==

Mathematically the two lines are represented by the equations:

: ''Y'' = ''C'' &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [''X''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;Pb]
: ''Y'' = ''AX'' + ''B'' &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  [''X''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;Pb]

where ''Y''&amp;nbsp;= crop production or yield, ''C''&amp;nbsp;= maximum yield, ''X''&amp;nbsp;= soil salinity, ''A''&amp;nbsp;= slope (regression coefficient) of the descending line, and ''B''&amp;nbsp;= regression constant of that line.

In the example of the figure: ''C'' = 1.2, ''A'' = —0.10, Pb = 7.0

The value of Pb is to be found by [[regression analysis]] and [[optimization]] so that the [[goodness of fit]] of the data to the model is maximum.

The Maas–Hoffman model is used in [[Crop tolerance to seawater#Modeling|crop tolerance to seawater]].
[[File:Maas-Hoffman model inverted.png|thumb|350px|Inverted Maas-Hoffman model for the relation between crop yield and depth of the watertable]]

==Inverted model==

For growth factors, like the depth of the [[watertable]], that affect crop production negatively at low values while there is no effect at high values, the inverted Maas–Hoffman model can be used.

According to the teachings of Mahāyāna traditions, "Mahāyāna" also refers to the path of the [[Bodhisattva]] seeking complete enlightenment for the benefit of all sentient beings, also called "Bodhisattvayāna", or the "Bodhisattva Vehicle".&lt;ref name="autogenerated38"&gt;[[Damien Keown]] (2003), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=985a1M7L1NcC&amp;pg=PA38 A Dictionary of Buddhism]'', [[Oxford University Press]], p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|"The Mahayana, 'Great Vehicle' or 'Great Carriage' (for carrying all beings to nirvana), is also, and perhaps more correctly and accurately, known as the Bodhisattvayana, the bodhisattva's vehicle." - Warder, A.K.

A samyaksaṃbuddha can establish the [[Dharma]] and lead disciples to enlightenment. Mahayana Buddhists teach that enlightenment can be attained in a single lifetime, and this can be accomplished even by a layperson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mahayana Buddhism:  What is Mahayana Buddhism?|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/mahayana|website=religionfacts.com|publisher=[[ReligionFacts]]|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mahāyāna tradition is the largest major tradition of Buddhism existing today, with 53.2% of practitioners, compared to 35.8% for [[Theravada]] and 5.7% for [[Vajrayana]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson |first1=Todd M. |last2=Grim |first2=Brian J. |title=The World's Religions in Figures: An Introduction to International Religious Demography |url=http://media.johnwiley.com.au/product_data/excerpt/47/04706745/0470674547-196.pdf |accessdate=2 September 2013 |year=2013 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=Hoboken, NJ |page=36 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020100448/http://media.johnwiley.com.au/product_data/excerpt/47/04706745/0470674547-196.pdf |archivedate=20 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of its history, Mahāyāna Buddhism spread from India to various other [[South Asia|South]], [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]]n countries such as [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]], [[Bhutan]], [[China]], [[Taiwan]], [[Mongolia]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]], [[Vietnam]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]]. Mahayana Buddhism also spread to other South and Southeast Asian countries, such as [[Afghanistan]], [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], the [[Maldives]], [[Pakistan]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Burma]], [[Iran]] and other Central Asian countries before being replaced by Theravada Buddhism or other religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sZRGAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;dq=buddhist+viharas+found+in+modern+day+iran&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6fa8kamUbK&amp;sig=TrrlAWcGC-OtT9yWpqHTrnfrPG0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxxY-w8ZPYAhUOw2MKHbBkCpIQ6AEIdDAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=buddhist%20viharas%20found%20in%20modern%20day%20iran&amp;f=false |last=Foltz |first=Richard |title=Religions of Iran:From Prehistory to the Present |page=95 |quote=In the centuries before the Arab conquests Buddhism was spread throughout the eastern Iranian world.

Large Mahāyāna scholastic centers thrived during the latter period of Buddhism in India, between the seventh and twelfth centuries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Major traditions of Mahāyāna Buddhism today include [[Chan Buddhism]], [[Korean Seon]], [[Japanese Zen]], [[Pure Land Buddhism]], [[Nichiren Buddhism]] and [[Buddhism in Vietnam|Vietnamese Buddhism]]. It may also include the [[Vajrayana]] traditions of [[Tiantai]],  [[Tendai]], [[Shingon Buddhism]], and [[Tibetan Buddhism]], which add esoteric teachings to the Mahāyāna tradition.

==Etymology==

According to Jan Nattier, the term ''Mahāyāna'' ("Great Vehicle") was originally an honorary synonym for ''Bodhisattvayāna'' ("[[Bodhisattva]] Vehicle")&lt;ref name="Nattier, Jan 2003 p. 174"&gt;Nattier, Jan (2003), ''A few good men: the Bodhisattva path according to the Inquiry of Ugra'': p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;— the vehicle of a bodhisattva seeking [[buddhahood]] for the benefit of all sentient beings.&lt;ref name="autogenerated38"/&gt; The term ''Mahāyāna'' (which had earlier been used simply as an epithet for Buddhism itself) was therefore adopted at an early date as a synonym for the path and the teachings of the bodhisattvas. Since it was simply an honorary term for ''Bodhisattvayāna'', the adoption of the term ''Mahāyāna'' and its application to Bodhisattvayāna did not represent a significant turning point in the development of a Mahāyāna tradition.&lt;ref name="Nattier, Jan 2003 p. 174"/&gt;

The earliest Mahāyāna texts often use the term ''Mahāyāna'' as a synonym for ''Bodhisattvayāna'', but the term ''[[Hinayana|Hīnayāna]]'' is comparatively rare in the earliest sources. The presumed dichotomy between ''Mahāyāna'' and ''Hīnayāna'' can be deceptive, as the two terms were not actually formed in relation to one another in the same era.&lt;ref&gt;Nattier, Jan (2003), ''A few good men: the Bodhisattva path according to the Inquiry of Ugra'': p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the earliest and most important references to ''Mahāyāna'' are those that occur in the ''[[Lotus Sutra|Lotus Sūtra]]'' (Skt. ''Saddharma Puṇḍarīka Sūtra'') dating between the 1st century BCE and the 1st century CE.&lt;ref&gt;W. Rahula, (1996). [http://www.budsas.org/ebud/ebdha125.htm ''Theravada - Mahayana Buddhism'']; in: "Gems of Buddhist Wisdom", Buddhist Missionary Society, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia&lt;/ref&gt; Seishi Karashima has suggested that the term first used in an earlier [[Gāndhārī language|Gandhāri]] [[Prakrit]] version of the ''Lotus Sūtra'' was not the term ''mahāyāna'' but the Prakrit word ''mahājāna'' in the sense of ''mahājñāna'' (great knowing).&lt;ref name=Williams2004&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Buddhism. Vol. 3. The origins and nature of Mahāyāna Buddhism.'' Routledge. 2004. p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karashima, Seishi (2000), [https://web.archive.org/web/20070705053037/http://iriab.soka.ac.jp/orc/Publications/ARIRIAB/pdf/ARIRIAB-04.pdf Who composed the Lotus Sutra?], Annual Report of The International Research Institute for Advanced Buddhology at Soka University  4, p. 170 (note 115)&lt;/ref&gt; At a later stage when the early Prakrit word was converted into Sanskrit, this ''mahājāna'', being phonetically ambivalent, was mistakenly converted into ''mahāyāna'', possibly because of what may have been a double meaning in the famous [[Upaya#Parable of the burning house|Parable of the Burning House]], which talks of three vehicles or carts (Skt: ''yāna'').{{refn|group=note|Karashima: "I have assumed that, in the earliest stage of the transmission of ''the Lotus Sūtra'', the Middle Indic forn ''jāṇa'' or *''jāna'' (Pkt &amp;lt; Skt ''jñāna'', ''yāna'') had stood in these places ... I have assumed, further, that the Mahāyānist terms ''buddha-yānā'' ("the Buddha-vehicle"), ''mahāyāna'' ("the great vehicle"), ''hīnayāna'' ("the inferior vehicle") meant originally ''buddha-jñāna'' ("buddha-knowledge"), ''mahājñāna'' ("great knowledge") and ''hīnajñāna'' ("inferior knowledge")."

===Origins===

The origins of Mahāyāna are still not completely understood.&lt;ref name="Hirakawa Akira 1993, p. 260"&gt;Akira, Hirakawa (translated and edited by Paul Groner) (1993. ''A History of Indian Buddhism''. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass: p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest Western views of Mahāyāna assumed that it existed as a separate school in competition with the so-called "Hīnayāna" schools. The earliest Mahāyāna texts often depict strict adherence to the path of a bodhisattva, and engagement in the ascetic ideal of a monastic life in the wilderness, akin to the ideas expressed in the ''[[Rhinoceros Sutra|Rhinoceros Sūtra]]''.{{refn|group=note|"As scholars have moved away from this limited corpus, and have begun to explore a wider range of Mahayana sūtras, they have stumbled on, and have started to open up, a literature that is often stridently ascetic and heavily engaged in reinventing the forest ideal, an individualistic, antisocial, ascetic ideal that is encapsulated in the apparently resurrected image of “wandering alone like a rhinoceros”. ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 494}}

The earliest textual evidence of "Mahāyāna" comes from [[sūtras]] originating around the beginning of the common era. Jan Nattier has noted that some of the earliest Mahāyāna texts such as the ''[[Ugrapariprccha Sutra|Ugraparipṛccha Sūtra]]'' use the term "Mahāyāna", yet there is no doctrinal difference between Mahāyāna in this context and the early schools, and that "Mahāyāna" referred rather to the rigorous emulation of [[Gautama Buddha]] in the path of a bodhisattva seeking to become a fully enlightened buddha.&lt;ref name="Nattier, Jan 2003 p. 193-194"&gt;Nattier, Jan (2003), ''A few good men: the Bodhisattva path according to the Inquiry of Ugra'': p. 193-194&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also no evidence that Mahāyāna ever referred to a separate formal school or sect of Buddhism, but rather that it existed as a certain set of ideals, and later doctrines, for bodhisattvas.&lt;ref name="Nattier, Jan 2003 p. 193-194"/&gt; Paul Williams has also noted that the Mahāyāna never had nor ever attempted to have a separate [[Vinaya]] or ordination lineage from the [[early schools of Buddhism]], and therefore each [[bhikkhu|bhikṣu]] or [[bhikkhuni|bhikṣuṇī]] adhering to the Mahāyāna formally belonged to an early school. Membership in these ''nikāyas'', or monastic sects, continues today with the [[Dharmaguptaka]] nikāya in East Asia, and the [[Mulasarvastivada|Mūlasarvāstivāda]] nikāya in [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Therefore, Mahāyāna was never a separate rival sect of the early schools.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul (2008) ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations'': pp. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Harrison clarifies that while monastic Mahāyānists belonged to a nikāya, not all members of a nikāya were Mahāyānists.&lt;ref&gt;Guang Xing. The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya Theory. 2004. p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; From Chinese monks visiting India, we now know that both Mahāyāna and non-Mahāyāna monks in India often lived in the same monasteries side by side.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul (2000) ''Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition'': p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible that, formally, Mahāyāna would have been understood as a group of monks or nuns within a larger monastery taking a vow together (known as a "''kriyākarma''") to memorize and study a Mahāyāna text or texts.

The Chinese monk [[Yijing (monk)|Yijing]], who visited India in the 7th century CE, distinguishes Mahāyāna from Hīnayāna as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul (2008) ''Mahāyāna Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations'': p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Both adopt one and the same Vinaya, and they have in common the prohibitions of the five offences, and also the practice of the [[Four Noble Truths]]. Those who venerate the bodhisattvas and read the Mahayana sūtras are called the Mahāyānists, while those who do not perform these are called the Hīnayānists.}}

Much of the early extant evidence for the origins of Mahāyāna comes from early Chinese translations of Mahāyāna texts. These Mahāyāna teachings were first propagated into [[China]] by [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokakṣema]], the first translator of Mahāyāna sūtras into [[Chinese language|Chinese]] during the 2nd century CE.{{refn|group=note|"The most important evidence&amp;nbsp;— in fact the only evidence&amp;nbsp;— for situating the emergence of the Mahayana around the beginning of the common era was not Indian evidence at all, but came from China. Already by the last quarter of the 2nd century CE, there was a small, seemingly idiosyncratic collection of substantial Mahayana sutras translated into what Erik Zürcher calls 'broken Chinese' by an Indoscythian, whose Indian name has been reconstructed as Lokaksema." ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 492}}

===Earliest Mahayana sutras===

Based on the testimony of [[Chandrakirti|Candrakīrti]] (7th cent.) several scholars have suggested that the [[Prajnaparamita|Prajñāpāramitā sūtras]], which are among the earliest [[Mahayana sutras]],&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Buddhist Thought.'' Routledge, 2000, pages 131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations 2nd edition.'' Routledge, 2009, pg. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; developed among the [[Mahāsāṃghika]] along the [[Krishna River|Kṛṣṇa River]] in the [[Andhra Pradesh#Early history|Āndhra]] region of southern India.&lt;ref name=Xing65-66&gt;Guang Xing. ''The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya Theory.'' 2004. pp. 65-66 "Several scholars have suggested that the Prajñāpāramitā probably developed among the Mahasamghikas in Southern India, in the Andhra country, on the Krishna River."&lt;/ref&gt; However, more recently Seishi Karashima has argued for their origin in the Gandhara region.&lt;ref&gt;Karashima, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The earliest Mahāyāna sūtras include the very first versions of the [[Prajñāpāramitā]] genre, along with texts concerning [[Aksobhya|Akṣobhya Buddha]], which were probably written down in the 1st century BCE in the south of India.&lt;ref name="Hirakawa Akira 1993, p. 263"&gt;Akira, Hirakawa (translated and edited by Paul Groner) (1993. ''A History of Indian Buddhism''. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass: pp. 253, 263, 268&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The south (of India) was then vigorously creative in producing Mahayana Sutras"&amp;nbsp;– Warder, A.K. (3rd edn. 1999). ''Indian Buddhism'': p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt; Guang Xing states, "Several scholars have suggested the Prajñāpāramitā probably developed among the Mahāsāṃghikas in southern India, in the Āndhra country, on the Kṛṣṇa River."&lt;ref name=Xing65-66/&gt; [[A.K. Warder]] believes that "the Mahāyāna originated in the south of India and almost certainly in the Āndhra country."&lt;ref&gt;Warder, A.K. ''Indian Buddhism''. 2000. p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthony Barber and Sree Padma note that "historians of Buddhist thought have been aware for quite some time that such pivotally important Mahayana Buddhist thinkers as [[Nāgārjuna]], [[Dignaga]], [[Candrakīrti]], [[Āryadeva]], and [[Bhavaviveka]], among many others, formulated their theories while living in Buddhist communities in Āndhra."&lt;ref&gt;Padma, Sree. Barber, Anthony W. ''Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra.'' SUNY Press 2008, pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; They note that the ancient Buddhist sites in the lower Kṛṣṇa Valley, including [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]], [[Nagarjunakonda|Nāgārjunakoṇḍā]] and [[Jaggaiahpet|Jaggayyapeṭa]] "can be traced to at least the third century BCE, if not earlier."&lt;ref&gt;Padma, Sree. Barber, Anthony W. ''Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra.'' SUNY Press 2008, pg. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Akira Hirakawa notes the "evidence suggests that many Early Mahayana scriptures originated in South India."&lt;ref&gt;Akira, Hirakawa (translated and edited by Paul Groner) (1993. ''A History of Indian Buddhism''. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass: p. 252, 253&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars think that the earliest Mahāyāna sūtras were mainly composed in the south of India, and later the activity of writing additional scriptures was continued in the north.{{refn|group=note|Warder: "The sudden appearance of large numbers of (Mahayana) teachers and texts (in North India in the second century AD) would seem to require some previous preparation and development, and this we can look for in the South." - Warder, A.K. (3rd edn. 1999). ''Indian Buddhism'': p. 335.}} However, the assumption that the presence of an evolving body of Mahāyāna scriptures implies the contemporaneous existence of distinct religious movement called "Mahāyāna", may be a serious misstep.{{refn|group=note|"But even apart from the obvious weaknesses inherent in arguments of this kind there is here the tacit equation of a body of literature with a religious movement, an assumption that evidence for the presence of one proves the existence of the other, and this may be a serious misstep." - ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 493}} Some scholars further speculate that the [[Prajñāpāramitā]] sūtras were written in response to the ultrarealism of [[abhidharma]].&lt;ref&gt;Skilton, Andrew (2004 ). ''A Concise History of Buddhism.'' p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some early Mahāyāna sūtras were translated by the [[Kushan|Kuṣāṇa]] monk [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokakṣema]], who came to China from the kingdom of [[Gandhara|Gandhāra]]. His first translations to Chinese were made in the Chinese capital of [[Luoyang]] between 178 and 189 CE.&lt;ref&gt;''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 492&lt;/ref&gt; Some Mahāyāna sūtras translated during the 2nd century CE include the following:&lt;ref&gt;Akira, Hirakawa (translated and edited by Paul Groner) (1993).

This corpus of texts often emphasizes ascetic practices and forest dwelling, absorbed in states of meditative concentration.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul (2008) ''Mahāyāna Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations:'' p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Harrison points to the enthusiasm in the Lokakṣema sūtra corpus for the extra ascetic practices, for dwelling in the forest, and above all for states of meditative absorption (''[[Samadhi (Buddhism)|samādhi]]''). Meditation and meditative states seem to have occupied a central place in early Mahāyāna, certainly because of their spiritual efficacy but also because they may have given access to fresh revelations and inspiration.}}

===Earliest inscriptions===

The earliest stone inscription containing a recognizably Mahāyāna formulation and a mention of the Buddha [[Amitābha]] was found in the Indian subcontinent in [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], and dated to around 180 CE. Remains of a statue of a Buddha bear the [[Brāhmī script|Brāhmī]] inscription: "Made in the year 28 of the reign of King [[Huvishka|Huviṣka]], ... for the Blessed One, the Buddha Amitābha." There is also some evidence that Emperor Huviṣka himself was a follower of Mahāyāna Buddhism, and a Sanskrit manuscript fragment in the [[Schoyen Collection|Schøyen Collection]] describes Huviṣka as having "set forth in the Mahāyāna."&lt;ref&gt;Neelis, Jason. ''Early Buddhist Transmission and Trade Networks.'' 2010. p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of the name "Mahāyāna" in Indian inscriptions in the period before the 5th century is very limited in comparison to the multiplicity of Mahāyāna writings transmitted from [[Central Asia]] to [[China]] at that time.{{refn|group=note|"Certainly, we have for this period an extensive body of inscriptions from virtually all parts of India. ... But nowhere in this extensive body of material is there any reference, prior to the fifth century, to a named Mahāyāna.", ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 493}}{{refn|group=note|"What is particularly disconcerting here is the disconnect between expectation and reality: We know from Chinese translations that large numbers of Mahāyāna sutras were being composed in the period between the beginning of the common era and the fifth century. But outside of texts, at least in India, at exactly the same period, very different&amp;nbsp;— in fact seemingly older&amp;nbsp;— ideas and aspirations appear to be motivating actual behavior, and old and established Hinayana groups appear to be the only ones that are patronized and supported., ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 494}}{{refn|group=note|"In other words, once nontextual evidence is taken into account the picture changes dramatically. Rather than being datable to the beginning of the common era, this strand of Mahayana Buddhism, at least, appeared to have no visible impact on Indian Buddhist cult practice until the 2nd century, and even then what impact it had was extremely isolated and marginal, and had no lasting or long-term consequences&amp;nbsp;— there were no further references to Amitabha in Indian image inscriptions. Almost exactly the same pattern occurs (concerning Mahayana) on an even broader scale when nontextual evidence is considered." - ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 493}}

===Early Mahāyāna Buddhism===

During the period of early Mahāyāna Buddhism, four major types of thought developed: [[Madhyamaka|Mādhyamaka]], [[Yogacara|Yogācāra]], [[Buddha-nature]] (''Tathāgatagarbha''), and [[Buddhist logic]] as the last and most recent.&lt;ref&gt;Akira, Hirakawa (translated and edited by Paul Groner) (1993. ''A History of Indian Buddhism''. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass: p. 8,9&lt;/ref&gt; In India, the two main philosophical schools of the Mahāyāna were the Mādhyamaka and the later Yogācāra.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter (1993). ''An Introduction to Buddhism.'' Cambridge University Press: p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Kushan Empire]], Mahayana Buddhism teachings encouraged societies to give generous donations to the Buddhist monasteries, which gave the people "religious merits".&lt;ref&gt;Xinru Liu, ''The Silk Road in World History'', (New York: Oxford University Press, 2010), 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier stage forms of Mahāyāna such as the doctrines of Prajñāpāramitā, Yogācāra, Buddha Nature, and the [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land]] teachings are still popular in East Asia. In some cases these have spawned new developments, while in others they are treated in the more traditional syncretic manner. Paul Williams has noted that in this tradition in the Far East, primacy has always been given to study of the sūtras.&lt;ref name="Williams, Paul 1989 p.103"&gt;Williams, Paul (1989). ''Mahayana Buddhism'': p.103&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gandhara, bodhisattva assiso, II sec..JPG|thumb|upright|[[Bodhisattva]] seated in [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]]. [[Afghanistan]], 2nd century]]

Few things can be said with certainty about Mahāyāna Buddhism,{{refn|group=note|"There are, it seems, very few things that can be said with certainty about Mahayana Buddhism", ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 492}} especially its early Indian form, other than that the Buddhism practiced in China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Korea, Tibet, and Japan is Mahāyāna Buddhism.{{refn|group=note|"But apart from the fact that it can be said with some certainty that the Buddhism embedded in China, Korea, Tibet, and Japan is Mahayana Buddhism, it is no longer clear what else can be said with certainty about Mahayana Buddhism itself, and especially about its earlier, and presumably formative, period in India.", ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 492}} Mahāyāna can be described as a loosely bound collection of many teachings with large and expansive doctrines that are able to exist simultaneously.{{refn|group=note|"It has become increasingly clear that Mahayana Buddhism was never one thing, but rather, it seems, a loosely bound bundle of many, and&amp;nbsp;— like Walt Whitman&amp;nbsp;— was large and could contain, in both senses of the term, contradictions, or at least antipodal elements." - ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 492}}

Mahāyāna constitutes an inclusive tradition characterized by plurality and the adoption of new [[Mahayana sutras]] in addition to the earlier [[Āgama (Buddhism)|āgama]]s. Mahāyāna sees itself as penetrating further and more profoundly into the Buddha's [[Dharma]]. An Indian commentary on the ''[[Mahāyānasaṃgraha]]'', entitled ''Vivṛtaguhyārthapiṇḍavyākhyā'', gives a classification of teachings according to the capabilities of the audience:&lt;ref&gt;Hamar, Imre. ''Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism.'' 2007. p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[A]ccording to disciples' grades, the Dharma is [classified as] inferior and superior. For example, the inferior was taught to the merchants [[Trapusa and Bahalika|Trapuṣa and Ballika]] because they were ordinary men; the middle was [[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta|taught to the group of five]] because they were at the stage of saints; the eightfold ''Prajñāpāramitās'' were taught to bodhisattvas, and [the ''Prajñāpāramitās''] are superior in eliminating conceptually imagined forms.}}

There is also a tendency in Mahāyāna sūtras to regard adherence to these sūtras as generating spiritual benefits greater than those that arise from being a follower of the non-Mahāyāna approaches to Dharma. Thus the ''[[Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra]]'' claims that the Buddha said that devotion to Mahāyāna is inherently superior in its virtues to following the [[śrāvaka]] or [[pratyekabuddha]] paths.&lt;ref&gt;Hookham, Dr. Shenpen, trans. (1998). ''The Shrimaladevi Sutra''. Oxford: Longchen Foundation: p.27&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamental principles of Mahāyāna doctrine were based on the possibility of universal liberation from [[dukkha]] for all beings (hence the "Great Vehicle") and the existence of buddhas and bodhisattvas embodying Buddha-nature. The Pure Land school of Mahāyāna simplifies the expression of [[Faith in Buddhism|faith]] by allowing salvation to be alternatively obtained through the grace of the buddha [[Amitābha]] by having faith and devoting oneself to [[nianfo|mindfulness of the Buddha]]. This [[Buddhist devotion|devotional lifestyle]] of Buddhism has greatly contributed to the success of Mahāyāna in East Asia, where spiritual elements traditionally relied upon mindfulness of the Buddha, mantras and [[dhāraṇī]]s, and reading sutras. In Chinese Buddhism, most monks, let alone lay people, practice Pure Land, some combining it with [[Chan Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;Welch (1967). ''Practice of Chinese Buddhism''. Harvard: p. 396&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Mahāyāna schools believe in supernatural bodhisattvas who devote themselves to the [[pāramitā]]s, ultimate knowledge (Skt. ''sarvajñāna''), and the liberation of all sentient beings.

===Bodhisattva===
{{Main|Bodhisattva}}
The Mahāyāna tradition holds that pursuing only the release from suffering and attainment of Nirvāṇa is too narrow an aspiration, because it lacks the motivation of actively resolving to liberate all other sentient beings from [[saṃsāra]], "suffering". One who engages in this path is called a bodhisattva. Bodhisattvas could reach nirvana, but they believe it is more important to help others on their path of finding nirvana rather than committing fully to nirvana themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Xinru Liu, ''The Silk Road in World History'', (New York: Oxford University Press, 2010), 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

The defining characteristic of a bodhisattva is [[bodhicitta]], the intention to achieve omniscient Buddhahood ([[Trikaya]]) as fast as possible, so that one may benefit infinite sentient beings. Sometimes the term bodhisattva is used more restrictively to refer to those sentient beings on the [[Bhūmi (Buddhism)|grounds]]. As Ananda Coomaraswamy notes, "The most essential part of the Mahayana is its emphasis on the Bodhisattva ideal, which replaces that of the [[arhat]], or ranks before it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Coomaraswamy|first=Ananda |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Buddha and the Gospel of Buddhism |year=1975 |publisher=University Books, Inc. |location=Boston|page=229 |lccn=64056434}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mahāyāna teachings, being a high-level bodhisattva involves possessing a mind of great compassion and [[prajñā (Buddhism)|prajñā]] (wisdom) to realize the reality of inherent [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]] and [[pratītyasamutpāda|dependent origination]]. Mahāyāna teaches that the practitioner will finally realize the attainment of [[Buddhahood]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Six pāramitās are traditionally required for bodhisattvas:{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Expedient means===
{{Main|Upaya}}
Expedient means&lt;ref&gt;Pye, Michael (1978). Skilful Means&amp;nbsp;— A concept in Mahayana Buddhism. London, UK: Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co. Ltd. {{ISBN|0-7156-1266-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Skt. ''[[upaya|upāya]]'') is found in the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'', one of the earliest-dated sutras, and is accepted in all Mahāyāna schools of thought. It is any effective method that aids awakening. It does not necessarily mean that some particular method is "untrue" but is simply any means or stratagem that is conducive to spiritual growth and leads beings to awakening and [[nirvana]]. Expedient means could thus be certain motivational words for a particular listener or even the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] itself. Basic Buddhism (what Mahāyāna would term ''[[śrāvakayāna]]'' or ''[[pratyekabuddhayāna]]'') is an expedient method for helping people begin the noble Buddhist path and advance quite far. But the path is not wholly traversed, according to some schools, until the practitioner has striven for and attained Buddhahood for the liberation of all other sentient beings from suffering.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Some scholars have stated that the exercise of expedient means, "the ability to adapt one's message to the audience, is also of enormous importance in the Pāli canon."{{refn|group=note|Gombrich: "It is true that the term translated 'expounding in means', upaya-kausalya, is post-canonical, but the exercise of expounding to which it refers, the ability to adapt one's message to the audience, is of enormous importance in the Pali Canon." Gombrich, Richard F. (1997). ''How Buddhism Began''. Munshiram Manoharlal: p. 17}} In fact the Pāli term ''upāya-kosalla'' does occur in the Pāli Canon, in the ''Sangiti Sutta'' of the ''Digha Nikāya''.&lt;ref&gt;Walshe, M. trans. (1987). ''Thus Have I Heard: the Long Discourses of the Buddha''. Wisdom: p. 486&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberation===
Mahāyāna Buddhism includes a rich cosmology, with various Buddhas and bodhisattvas residing in different worlds and buddha-realms. The concept of [[trikaya|the three bodies]] (''trikāya'') supports these constructions, making the Buddha himself a transcendental figure. Dr. Guang Xing describes the Mahāyāna Buddha as "an omnipotent divinity endowed with numerous supernatural attributes and qualities ...[He] is described almost as an omnipotent and almighty godhead."&lt;ref&gt;Guang Xing (2005). ''The Three Bodies of the Buddha: The Origin and Development of the Trikaya Theory''. Oxford: Routledge Curzon: pp.1 and 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Under various conditions, the realms Buddha presides over could be attained by devotees after their death so, when reborn, they could strive towards buddhahood in the best possible conditions. Depending on the sect, liberation into a buddha-realm can be obtained by faith, visualization, or sometimes even by the repetition of Buddha's name. These practices are common in Pure Land Buddhism.{Dr. Guang Xing, The Three Bodies of the Buddha: The Origin and Development of the Trikaya Theory, RoutledgeCurzon, Oxford, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;1}

===Buddha nature===
[[File:Ajanta Ellora buddha statue aurangabad maharastra.jpg|thumb|The Buddha flanked by [[bodhisattva]]s. Cave 4, [[Ajanta Caves|Ajaṇṭā Caves]], [[Maharashtra|Mahārāṣtra]], India]]

{{Main|Buddha nature}}

''Buddha-nature'', ''Buddha-dhatu'' or ''Buddha Principle'' ([[Sanskrit|Skt]]: ''Buddha-dhātu'', ''Tathāgatagarbha''; [[Japanese language|Jap]]: ''Bussho''), is taught differently in various Mahayana Buddhism traditions. Broadly speaking Buddha-nature is concerned with ascertaining what allows sentient beings to become Buddhas.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Buddhist Thought.'' Routledge 2000, page 160.&lt;/ref&gt; The term, Buddha nature, is a translation of the Sanskrit coinage, 'Buddha-dhātu', which seems first to have appeared in the ''[[Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Paul Williams, ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations'', Second Edition, Routledge, Oxford, 2009, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; where it refers to "a sacred nature that is the basis for [beings'] becoming buddhas",&lt;ref name="Kevin Trainor 2004, p. 207"&gt;Kevin Trainor, ''Buddhism: The Illustrated Guide'', Oxford University Press, 2004, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; and where it is also spoken of as the 'Self' (''atman'').&lt;ref name="Professor Michael Zimmermann 2002 pp. 82"&gt;Zimmermann, Michael (2002), [https://web.archive.org/web/20131111023508/http://iriab.soka.ac.jp/orc/Publications/BPPB/pdf/BPPB-06.pdf  ''A Buddha Within: The Tathāgatagarbhasūtra''], Biblotheca Philologica et Philosophica Buddhica VI, The International Research Institute for Advanced Buddhology, Soka University, pp. 82-83&lt;/ref&gt;

It is called ''Tathāgatagarbha'' ''Buddha-dhātu'' at the stage of sentient beings because it is covered with defilements, and it is called ''[[Dharmakaya|Dharmakāya]]'' at the stage of Buddhahood, because its pure nature is revealed.&lt;ref&gt;Xing Guang (2005), ''The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikāya Theory'', p.88&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|The Dharmakaya is in "Tibetan Buddhism [...] considered to be equivalent to the mind of the Buddha", since it is synonymous with perfect enlightenment (saṃbodhi).&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of Buddhism "dharma-kaya", Oxford University Press 2003&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The teaching of a "Buddha nature" (Skt. ''tathāgatagarbha'') may be based on the "[[luminous mind]]" concept found in the ''[[Āgama (Buddhism)|Āgamas]]''. The essential idea, articulated in the Buddha nature sūtras, but not accepted by all Mahāyānists, is that no being is without a concealed but indestructible interior link to the awakening of ''[[bodhi]]'' and that this link is an uncreated element (''dhātu'') or principle deep inside each being, which constitutes the deathless, diamond-like "essence of the self".&lt;ref&gt;''Nirvāṇa Sūtra''&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2014}} The ''Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra'' states: "The essence of the Self (''ātman'') is the subtle Buddha nature..." while the later ''[[Lankavatara Sutra|Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]]'' states that the Buddha nature might be taken to be self (''ātman''), but it is not. In the ''sagathakam'' section of that same sutra, however, the Tathagatagarbha as the Self is not denied, but affirmed: "The ''Atma'' [Self] characterised with purity is the state of self-realization; this is the Tathagata's Womb (''garbha''), which does not belong to the realm of the theorisers."&lt;ref&gt;Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki, ''The Lankavatara Sutra'', Prajna Press, Boulder, 1978, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; In the Buddha nature class of sūtras, the word "self" (''ātman'') is used in a way defined by and specific to these sūtras. (See [[Atman (Buddhism)]].)

[[File:Descent of Amida and 25 Bodhisattvas (Fukushima Museum).jpg|thumb|150px|''Descent of [[Amitābha|Amida]] and 25 [[Bodhisattva]]s'', [[Kamakura period]] (1185-1333), [[Fukushima Museum]], [[Japan]]]]

According to some scholars, the Buddha nature discussed in some Mahāyāna sūtras does not represent a substantial self (''ātman''); rather, it is a positive language and expression of [[Shunyata|emptiness]] (''śūnyatā'') and represents the potentiality to realize Buddhahood through Buddhist practices.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071023073728/http://zencomp.com/greatwisdom/ebud/ebdha191.htm Heng-Ching Shih, ''The Significance Of "Tathagatagarbha"—A Positive Expression Of "Sunyata".'']&lt;/ref&gt; It is the "[[true self]]" in representing the innate aspect of the individual that makes actualizing the ultimate personality possible.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The actual "seeing and knowing" of this Buddha essence is said to usher in nirvanic liberation. This Buddha essence or "Buddha nature" is stated to be found in every single person, ghost, god and sentient being. In the Buddha nature sūtras, the Buddha is portrayed as describing the Buddha essence as uncreated, deathless and ultimately beyond rational grasping or conceptualisation. Yet, it is this already real and present, hidden internal element of [[bodhi|awakeness]] (''bodhi'') that, according to the Buddha nature sūtras, prompts beings to seek liberation from worldly suffering, and lets them attain the spotless bliss that lies at the heart of their being. Once the veils of negative thoughts, feelings, and unwholesome behaviour (the ''[[Kleśā (Buddhism)|kleśas]]'') are eliminated from the mind and character, the indwelling Buddha principle (''Buddha-dhātu'': Buddha nature) can shine forth unimpededly and transform the seer into a Buddha.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Prior to the period of these sūtras, Mahāyāna [[metaphysics]] was dominated by teachings on [[Shunyata|emptiness]], in the form of [[Madhyamaka]] philosophy. The language used by this approach is primarily negative, and the Buddha nature genre of sūtras can be seen as an attempt to state orthodox Buddhist teachings of [[dependent origination]] and on the mysterious reality of nirvana using positive language instead, to prevent people from being turned away from Buddhism by a false impression of nihilism. In these sūtras the perfection of the wisdom of not-self is stated to be the true self; the ultimate goal of the path is then characterized using a range of positive language that had been used in Indian philosophy previously by essentialist philosophers, but was now transmuted into a new Buddhist vocabulary that described a being who has successfully completed the Buddhist path.&lt;ref&gt;King, Sallie B. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927131119/http://www.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/nlarc/pdf/Pruning%20the%20bodhi%20tree/Pruning%209.pdf  ''The Doctrine of Buddha-Nature is impeccably Buddhist'']. In: Jamie Hubbard (ed.), Pruning the Bodhi Tree: The Storm Over Critical Buddhism, Univ of Hawaii Press 1997, pp. 174-179. {{ISBN|0824819497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different view is propounded by Tathagatagarbha specialist,  Michael Zimmermann, who sees key Buddha-nature sutras such as the ''Nirvana Sutra'' and the ''Tathagatagarbha Sutra'', as well as the ''Lankavatara Sutra'', enunciating an affirmative vision of an eternal, indestructible Buddhic Self. Zimmermann observes:&lt;ref name="Professor Michael Zimmermann 2002 pp. 82"/&gt;

{{quote|the existence of an eternal, imperishable self, that is, buddhahood, is definitely the basic point of the ''TGS'' [''Tathagatagarbha Sutra''] ... the ''Mahaparinirvanasutra'' and the ''Lankavatarasutra'' characterize the ''tathagatagarbha'' explicitly as ''atman'' [Self].}}

The ''[[Uttaratantra]]'' (an [[Exegesis|exegetical]] treatise on [[Buddha nature]]) sees Buddha nature not as [[samskrta|caused and conditioned]] (''saṃskṛta''), but as eternal, uncaused, unconditioned, and incapable of being destroyed, although temporarily concealed within worldly beings by adventitious defilements.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian, C. D. (2005), ''Metaphysics and Mysticism in Mahayana Buddhism''. Delhi: Sri Satguru Publications: p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; According to C. D. Sebastian, the ''Uttaratantra's'' reference to a transcendental self (''[[Ātman (Buddhism)|ātma]]-[[paramita|pāramitā]]'') should be understood as "the unique essence of the universe",&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian, C. D. (2005), ''Metaphysics and Mysticism in Mahayana Buddhism''. Delhi: Sri Satguru Publications: p. 151; cf. also p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; thus the universal and [[immanent]] essence of Buddha nature is the same throughout time and space.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian,  C. D. (2005), ''Metaphysics and Mysticism in Mahayana Buddhism''. Delhi: Sri Satguru Publications: p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scriptures==

===Āgamas===

{{Main|Mahayana sutras}}
Mahāyāna Buddhism takes the basic teachings of the Buddha as recorded in early scriptures as the starting point of its teachings, such as those concerning karma and rebirth, [[Anatman|anātman]], [[Shunyata|emptiness]], [[dependent origination]], and the [[Four Noble Truths]]. Mahāyāna Buddhists in East Asia have traditionally studied these teachings in the [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Āgamas]] preserved in the [[Chinese Buddhist canon]]. "Āgama" is the term used by those traditional Buddhist schools in India who employed Sanskrit for their basic canon. These correspond to the [[Nikāya]]s used by the Theravāda school. The surviving Āgamas in Chinese translation belong to at least two schools, while most of the Āgamas teachings were never translated into Tibetan.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In addition to accepting the essential scriptures of the [[early Buddhist schools]] as valid, Mahāyāna Buddhism maintains large collections of sūtras that are not used or recognized by the Theravāda school. These were not recognized by some individuals in the early Buddhist schools. In other cases, Buddhist communities were divided along these doctrinal lines. In Mahāyāna Buddhism, the [[Mahayana sutras|Mahāyāna sūtras]] are often given greater authority than the Āgamas. The first of these Mahāyāna-specific writings were written probably around the 1st century BCE&lt;ref name="Hirakawa Akira 1993, p. 252"&gt;Akira, Hirakawa (translated and edited by Paul Groner) (1993). ''A History of Indian Buddhism''. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass: p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; or 1st century CE.&lt;ref name="Buddhism 2004, page 293"&gt;''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 4th century Mahāyāna abhidharma work ''Abhidharmasamuccaya'', [[Asanga|Asaṅga]] refers to the collection which contains the āgamas as the ''Śrāvakapiṭaka'' and associates it with the [[sravaka|śrāvaka]]s and [[pratyekabuddha]]s.&lt;ref name="autogenerated199"&gt;Boin-Webb, Sara (tr). Rahula, Walpola (tr). Asanga. ''Abhidharma Samuccaya: The Compendium of Higher Teaching.'' 2001. pp. 199-200&lt;/ref&gt; Asaṅga classifies the Mahāyāna sūtras as belonging to the ''Bodhisattvapiṭaka'', which is designated as the collection of teachings for bodhisattvas.&lt;ref name="autogenerated199"/&gt;

===Turnings of the Dharma Wheel===

Dating back at least to the ''[[Sandhinirmocana Sutra|Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra]]'' is a classification of the corpus of Buddhism into three categories, based on ways of understanding the nature of reality, known as the "[[three turnings of the wheel of dharma|Three Turnings of the Dharma Wheel]]". According to this view, there were three such "turnings":&lt;ref name=Kitagawa80&gt;[[Joseph Kitagawa|Kitagawa, Joseph Mitsuo]] (2002). ''The Religious Traditions of Asia: Religion, History, and Culture''. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-7007-1762-5}}: p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

#In the first turning, the Buddha taught the [[Four Noble Truths]] at [[Varanasi]] for those in the [[shravaka|śravaka]] vehicle. It is described as marvelous and wonderful, but requiring interpretation and occasioning controversy.&lt;ref name=Samdhinirmocana&gt;Keenan, John (2000). ''The Scripture on the Explication of the Underlying Meaning''. Numata Center. {{ISBN|1-886439-10-9}}: p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrines of the first turning are exemplified in the ''[[Dhammacakkapavattana Sutta|Dharmacakra Pravartana Sūtra]]''. This turning represents the earliest phase of the Buddhist teachings and the earliest period in the history of Buddhism.
#In the second turning, the Buddha taught the Mahāyāna teachings to the bodhisattvas, teaching that all phenomena have no-essence, no arising, no passing away, are originally quiescent, and essentially in cessation. This turning is also described as marvelous and wonderful, but requiring interpretation and occasioning controversy.&lt;ref name=Samdhinirmocana /&gt; Doctrine of the second turning is established in the Prajñāpāramitā teachings, first put into writing around 100 BCE. In Indian philosophical schools, it is exemplified by the Mādhyamaka school of [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]].
#In the third turning, the Buddha taught similar teachings to the second turning, but for everyone in the three vehicles, including all the śravakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas. These were meant to be completely explicit teachings in their entire detail, for which interpretations would not be necessary, and controversy would not occur.&lt;ref name=Samdhinirmocana /&gt; These teachings were established by the ''Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra'' as early as the 1st or 2nd century CE.&lt;ref name="Powers_1993"&gt;{{Citation |last=Powers |first=John |year=1993 |title=Hermeneutics and tradition in the Saṃdhinirmocana-sūtra |publisher=Brill Academic Publishers |pages=4–11 |isbn=90-04-09826-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Indian philosophical schools, the third turning is exemplified by the Yogācāra school of Asaṅga and [[Vasubandhu]].

Some traditions of Tibetan Buddhism consider the teachings of Esoteric Buddhism and Vajrayāna to be the third turning of the Dharma Wheel. Tibetan teachers, particularly of the [[Gelug]]pa school, regard the second turning as the highest teaching, because of their particular interpretation of Yogācāra doctrine. The [[Tathagatagarbha|Buddha Nature]] teachings are normally included in the third turning of the wheel.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} The Chinese tradition has a different scheme.

The Chinese T'ien-T'ai believed the Buddha taught over Five Periods. These are:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Soka Gakkai Dictionary of Buddhism, 'Five Periods'&lt;/ref&gt;

# The Flower Garland Period.
# The Agama Period.
# The Correct and Equal Period (provisional Mahayana Sutras, including the Amida, Mahavairochana and Vimalakirti Sutras).
# The Wisdom Period (Perfection of Wisdom Sutras).
# The Lotus and Nirvana Period (when Shakyamuni taught from the standpoint of his Enlightenment).

===Early canon===
Scholars have noted that many key Mahāyāna ideas are closely connected to the earliest texts of Buddhism. The seminal work of Mahāyāna philosophy, [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna's]] ''[[Mulamadhyamakakarika|Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]'', mentions the canon's ''Katyāyana Sūtra'' (SA 301) by name, and may be an extended commentary on that work.&lt;ref&gt;Kalupahana, David (2006). ''Mulamadhyamakakarika of Nagarjuna.'' Motilal Banarsidass: p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Nāgārjuna systematized the [[Madhyamaka|Mādhyamaka]] school of Mahāyāna philosophy. He may have arrived at his positions from a desire to achieve a consistent exegesis of the Buddha's doctrine as recorded in the canon. In his eyes the Buddha was not merely a forerunner, but the very founder of the Mādhyamaka system.&lt;ref&gt;Lindtner, Christian (1997). ''Master of Wisdom.'' Dharma Publishing: p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt; Nāgārjuna also referred to a passage in the canon regarding "[[Nirvana#Luminous consciousness|nirvanic consciousness]]" in two different works.&lt;ref&gt;Lindtner, Christian (1997). ''Master of Wisdom.'' Dharma Publishing: p. 322. Lindtner says that Nāgārjuna is referencing the DN.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yogacara|Yogācāra]], the other prominent Mahāyāna school in dialectic with the Mādhyamaka school, gave a special significance to the canon's ''Lesser Discourse on Emptiness'' (MA 190).&lt;ref&gt;Nagao, Gadjin M.; Kawamura, Leslie S., trans. (1991). ''Madhyamika and Yogachara.'' Albany: SUNY Press: p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; A passage there (which the discourse itself emphasizes) is often quoted in later Yogācāra texts as a true definition of [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]].&lt;ref&gt;Nagao, Gadjin M.; Kawamura, Leslie S., trans. (1991). ''Madhyamika and Yogachara.'' Albany: SUNY Press: p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Walpola Rahula]], the thought presented in the Yogācāra school's ''[[Abhidharma-samuccaya]]'' is undeniably closer to that of the Pali [[Nikayas]] than is that of the Theravadin [[Abhidhamma]].&lt;ref&gt;Dan Lusthaus, ''Buddhist Phenomenology.'' Routledge, 2002, page 44, note 5. Lusthaus draws attention to Rahula's ''Zen and the Taming of the Bull.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the Mādhyamikas and the Yogācārins saw themselves as preserving the Buddhist Middle Way between the extremes of nihilism (everything as unreal) and substantialism (substantial entities existing). The Yogācārins criticized the Mādhyamikas for tending towards nihilism, while the Mādhyamikas criticized the Yogācārins for tending towards substantialism.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter (1993). ''An Introduction to Buddhism.'' Cambridge University Press: p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Key Mahāyāna texts introducing the concepts of [[bodhicitta]] and [[Buddha nature]] also use language parallel to passages in the canon containing the Buddha's description of "[[luminous mind]]" and appear to have evolved from this idea. &lt;ref&gt;Analayo "The Luminous Mind in Theravāda and Dharmaguptaka Discourses" Journal of the Oxford Centre for Buddhist Studies, 2017, 13: 10-51;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter (1989).Consciousness Mysticism in the Discourses of the Buddha.

In the early Buddhist texts, and as taught by the modern Theravada school, the goal of becoming a teaching Buddha in a future life is viewed as the aim of a small group of individuals striving to benefit future generations after the current Buddha's teachings have been lost, but in the current age there is no need for most practitioners to aspire to this goal. Theravada texts do, however, hold that this is a more perfectly virtuous goal.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter (2000). ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics''. Cambridge University Press: p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Williams writes that some modern Theravada meditation masters in [[Thailand]] are popularly regarded as bodhisattvas.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Williams, ''Mahāyāna Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations.'' Taylor &amp; Francis, 1989, page 328.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Cholvijarn observes that prominent figures associated with the [[Dhammakaya Movement|Self perspective]] in Thailand have often been famous outside scholarly circles as well, among the wider populace, as Buddhist meditation masters and sources of miracles and sacred [[amulet]]s. Like perhaps some of the early Mahāyāna forest hermit monks, or the later Buddhist Tantrics, they have become people of power through their meditative achievements. They are widely revered, worshipped, and held to be arhats or (note!) bodhisattvas.}}

===Theravāda and Hīnayāna===
In the 7th century, the Chinese Buddhist monk [[Xuanzang]] describes the concurrent existence of the [[Mahavihara|Mahāvihara]] and the [[Abhayagiri Dagaba|Abhayagiri]] Vihara in [[Sri Lanka]]. He refers to the monks of the Mahāvihara as the "Hīnayāna Sthaviras" (''Theras''), and the monks of the Abhayagiri Vihara as the "Mahāyāna Sthaviras".&lt;ref&gt;Baruah, Bibhuti. ''Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism.'' 2008. p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Xuanzang further writes:&lt;ref&gt;Hirakawa, Akira. Groner, Paul. ''A History of Indian Buddhism: From Śākyamuni to Early Mahāyāna.'' 2007. p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The Mahāvihāravāsins reject the Mahāyāna and practice the Hīnayāna, while the Abhayagirivihāravāsins study both Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna teachings and propagate the ''[[Tripiṭaka]]''.}}

The modern Theravāda school is usually described as belonging to Hīnayāna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Monier-Williams |first=Sir Monier |year=1889 |title=Buddhism in Its Connexion with Brāhmanism and Hindūism: And in Its Contrast with Christianity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uiUVAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Buddhism&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1&amp;ei=ykWVSNfIPIbujgGgrbXqAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Buddhism&amp;f=false |publisher=John Murray}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gombrich&gt;Gombrich, Richard Francis (1988).

''The Oxford Handbook of Global Religions'': P.83&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors have argued that it should not be considered such from the Mahāyāna perspective. Their view is based on a different understanding of the concept of Hīnayāna. Rather than regarding the term as referring to any school of Buddhism that hasn't accepted the Mahāyāna canon and doctrines, such as those pertaining to the role of the bodhisattva,&lt;ref name=gombrich/&gt;&lt;ref name=gellner/&gt; these authors argue that the classification of a school as "Hīnayāna" should be crucially dependent on the adherence to a specific [[phenomenology of religion|phenomenological]] position. They point out that unlike the now-extinct [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivāda]] school, which was the primary object of Mahāyāna criticism, the Theravāda does not claim the existence of independent [[Dharma#In Buddhist phenomenology|entities]] (''dharmas''); in this it maintains the attitude of early Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Frank J. and Mahinda, Deegalle (1996). ''Pali Buddhism.'' Routledge Press: p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;King, Richard (1999). ''Indian Philosophy: An Introduction to Hindu and Buddhist Thought.'' Edinburgh University Press: p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nyanaponika, Nyaponika Thera, Nyanaponika, Bhikkhu Bodhi (1998). ''Abhidhamma Studies: Buddhist Explorations of Consciousness and Time.'' Wisdom Publications: p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents of Mahāyāna Buddhism disagreed with the substantialist thought of the Sarvāstivādins and [[Sautrantika|Sautrāntikas]], and in emphasizing the doctrine of [[sunyata|emptiness]], Kalupahana holds that they endeavored to preserve the early teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Kalupahana, David (2006). ''Mulamadhyamakakarika of Nagarjuna.'' Motilal Banarsidass: p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The Theravādins too refuted the Sarvāstivādins and Sautrāntikas (and other schools) on the grounds that their theories were in conflict with the non-substantialism of the canon. The Theravāda arguments are preserved in the ''[[Kathavatthu|Kathāvatthu]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kalupahana, David (2006). ''Mulamadhyamakakarika of Nagarjuna.'' Motilal Banarsidass: p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some contemporary Theravādin figures have indicated a sympathetic stance toward the Mahāyāna philosophy found in texts such as the ''[[Heart Sutra|Heart Sūtra]]'' (Skt. ''Prajñāpāramitā Hṛdaya'') and Nāgārjuna's ''[[Mulamadhyamakakarika|Fundamental Stanzas on the Middle Way]]'' (Skt. ''Mūlamadhyamakakārikā'').&lt;ref&gt;Lopez, Donald S. and Dge-ʼdun-chos-ʼphel (2006). ''The Madman's Middle Way: Reflections on Reality of the Tibetan Monk Gendun Chopel.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6323">'''Meinong's jungle''' is the name given to the repository of non-existent entities in the [[ontology]] of [[Alexius Meinong]].&lt;ref name=jacquette/&gt;

==Overview==
Meinong, an [[Austria]]n [[philosopher]] active at the turn of the [[20th century philosophy|20th century]], believed that since non-existent things could apparently be [[reference|referred to]], they must have some sort of [[being]], which he termed ''sosein'' ("being so"). A [[unicorn]] and a [[pegasus]] are both non-being; yet it's true that unicorns have horns and pegasi have wings. Thus non-existent things like unicorns, square circles, and golden mountains can have different properties, and must have a 'being such-and-such' even though they lack 'being' proper.&lt;ref name=jacquette/&gt; The strangeness of such entities led to this ontological realm being referred to as "Meinong's jungle". The jungle is described in Meinong's work ''Über Annahmen'' (1902).&lt;ref name=kneale/&gt; The name is credited to [[William Kneale (logician)|William C. Kneale]], whose ''Probability and Induction'' (1949) includes the passage "after wandering in Meinong's jungle of subsistence ... philosophers are now agreed that propositions cannot be regarded as ultimate entities".&lt;ref name=kneale&gt;{{cite book|title=Probability and Induction |first=William C. |last=Kneale |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1949 |oclc=907671 |pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Meinongian theory of objects (''Gegenstandstheorie'') was influential in the debate over [[sense and reference]] between [[Gottlob Frege]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] which led to the establishment of [[analytic philosophy]] and contemporary [[philosophy of language]]. Russell's [[theory of descriptions]], in the words of [[P.M.S. Hacker]], enables him to "thin out the luxuriant Meinongian jungle of entities (such as the round square), which, it had appeared, must ''in some sense'' subsist in order to be talked about".&lt;ref name=hacker&gt;{{cite book | last = Hacker | first = P. M. S. |authorlink=Peter Hacker | title = Insight and Illusion | publisher = Clarendon Press | location = Oxford | year = 1986 | isbn = 0-19-824783-4 |pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the theory of descriptions, speakers are not committed to asserting the existence of referents for the names they use.

Meinong's jungle is cited as an objection to Meinong's semantics, as the latter commits one to ontically undesirable objects;&lt;ref name=jacquette&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacquette |first=Dale |title=On Defoliating Meinong's Jungle |journal=Axiomathes |issue=1–2 |year=1996 |pages=17–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is desirable to be able to speak meaningfully about unicorns, the objection goes, but not to have to believe in them. [[Nominalism|Nominalists]] (who believe that general or abstract terms and [[wikt:predicate|predicates]] exist but that either [[universals]] or [[abstract objects]] do not) find Meinong's jungle particularly unpalatable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Klima |editor=Karel Lambert | first = Gyula | title = New Essays in Free Logic | publisher = Kluwer Academic Publishers | location = Boston | year = 2001 | isbn = 1-4020-0216-5 |chapter=Existence and Reference in Medieval Logic |pages=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Colin McGinn]] puts it, "[g]oing naively by the linguistic appearances leads not only to logical impasse but also to metaphysical extravagance—as with Meinong's jungle, infested with shadowy Being."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = McGinn | first = Colin |authorlink=Colin McGinn | title = The Problem of Consciousness | publisher = Blackwell | location = Oxford | year = 1993 | isbn = 0-631-18803-7 |pages=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; An uneasiness with the [[ontological commitment]]s of Meinong's theory is commonly expressed in the ''bon mot'' "we should cut back Meinong's jungle with [[Occam's razor]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Smith | first = A. D. | title = The Problem of Perception | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-674-00841-3 |pages=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meinong's jungle was defended by [[modal realism|modal realists]], whose [[possible world semantics]] offered a more palatable variation of Meinong's ''Gegenstandstheorie'', as [[Jaakko Hintikka]] explains:
{{quote|If you ask "Where are the non-existent objects?" the answer is, "Each in its own possible world." The only trouble with that notorious thicket, Meinong's jungle, is that it has not been zoned, plotted and divided into manageable lots, better known as possible worlds.|sign=Hintikka, Jaakko|source=''The Logic of Epistemology and the Epistemology of Logic'', p.&amp;nbsp;40&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hintikka | first = Jaakko | authorlink=Jaakko Hintikka |title = The Logic of Epistemology and the Epistemology of Logic | publisher = Kluwer Academic | year = 1989 | isbn = 0-7923-0040-8 |pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, modal realists retain the problem of explaining reference to impossible objects such as square circles. For Meinong, such objects simply have a 'being so' that precludes their having ordinary 'being'. But this entails that 'being so' in Meinong's sense is not equivalent to existing in a possible world.

[[Image:Le Voyage dans la lune.jpg|thumb|right|Early model use from "[[A Trip to the Moon]]"]]
A '''miniature effect''' is a [[special effect]] created for motion pictures and television programs using [[scale model]]s. Scale models are often combined with [[high speed photography]] or [[Matte (filmmaking)|matte shots]] to make gravitational and other effects appear convincing to the viewer. The use of miniatures has largely been superseded by [[computer-generated imagery]] in the contemporary cinema.

Where a miniature appears in the foreground of a shot, this is often very close to the camera lens — for example when matte painted backgrounds are used. Since the exposure is set to the object being filmed so the actors appear well lit, the miniature must be over-lit in order to balance the exposure and eliminate any depth of field differences that would otherwise be visible. This foreground miniature usage is referred to as [[forced perspective]]. Another form of miniature effect uses [[stop motion]] [[animation]].

Use of scale models in the creation of visual effects by the entertainment industry dates back to the earliest days of cinema.  Models and miniatures are copies of people, animals, buildings, settings and objects. Miniatures or models are used to represent things that do not really exist, or that are too expensive or difficult to film in reality, such as explosions, floods or fires.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oscars.org/teachersguide/visualeffects/activity1.html Visual Effects | Activity 1 | Teacher's Resource Guide | YMI, Ltd./AMPAS] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905085905/http://www.oscars.org/teachersguide/visualeffects/activity1.html |date=September 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== From 1900 to the mid-1960s ==
French director [[Georges Méliès]] incorporated special effects in his 1902 film ''[[A Trip to the Moon|Le Voyage dans la Lune]]'' (''A Trip to the Moon'') — including double-exposure, split screens, miniatures and stop-action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chmielewski|first=Dawn|title=A medium in motion|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/cl-ca-125filmtech21may21,0,6395197.story|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=May 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most influential visual effects films of these early years such as ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927), ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941), ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' (1954) ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1956).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemaweb.com/silentfilm/bookshelf/10_cbd_4.htm|title=Motion Picture Directing&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1933 film ''[[King Kong]]'' made extensive use of miniature effects including scale models and stop-motion animation of miniature elements.

== From the mid-1960s ==
[[Image:Discovery1b.JPG|thumb|right|2001's Discovery miniature]]The use of miniatures in ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animated-news.com/2007/ves-unveils-“50-most-influential-visual-effects-films-of-all-time” VES Unveils “50 Most Influential Visual Effects Films of All Time”]&lt;/ref&gt; was a major development. In production for three years, the film was a significant advancement in creating convincing models.

In the early 1970s, miniatures were often used to depict disasters in such films as ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (1972 film)|The Poseidon Adventure]]'' (1972), ''[[Earthquake (1974 film)|Earthquake]]'' (1974) and ''[[The Towering Inferno (film)|The Towering Inferno]]'' (1975).

The resurgence of the science fiction genre in film in the late 1970s saw miniature fabrication rise to new heights in such films as  ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', (1977), ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (also 1977), ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979), ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'' (1979) and ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982). Iconic film sequences such as the tanker truck explosion from ''[[The Terminator]]'' (1984) and the bridge destruction in ''[[True Lies]]'' (1994) were achieved through the use of large-scale miniatures.

== Largely replaced by CGI ==
The release of ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993) was a turning point in the use of computers to create effects for which physical miniatures would have previously been employed.

While the use of computer generated imagery (CGI) has largely overtaken their use since then, they are still often employed, especially for projects requiring physical interaction with fire, explosions or water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalcontentproducer.com/mag/video_miniatures_digital_world/ |title=Miniatures In a Digital World |publisher=Digitalcontentproducer.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Slurpasaur ===
"Slurpasaur" is a nickname given to optically enlarged [[reptile]]s (and occasionally other animals) that are presented as [[dinosaur]]s in motion pictures.

Concurrently with [[Willis O'Brien]] and others in making [[stop-motion]] animated dinosaurs since the early days of cinema, producers have used optically enlarged lizards, often with horns and fins glued on, to represent dinosaurs, to cut costs, and to present a living analog to dinosaurs, despite huge morphological differences between dinosaurs and reptiles. The first film that used reptiles dressed as dinosaurs was [[D.W. Griffith]]'s [[Brute Force (1914 film)|''Brute Force'']].  Various slurpasaurs appeared in the [[The Mysterious Island (1929 film)|1929 film version of ''The Mysterious Island'']], the 1933 British film ''Secret of the Loch'', and the 1936 ''Flash Gordon'' serial. The first major use of the slurpasaur was in ''[[One Million B.C.]]'' (1940), which included a pig dressed as a triceratops, with the [[special effects]] in this film re-used often, such as in the 1955 movie ''[[King Dinosaur]]''.

Other notable films with slurpasaurs include ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth (1959 film)|Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'' (1959) and ''[[The Lost World (1960 film)|The Lost World]]'' (1960). The former featured reptiles with attached tall spinal fans, simulating [[Dimetrodon]]s and looked superficially similar to those creatures, as Dimetrodons had a low slung body structure more reminiscent of lizards. The latter is notable for a dinosaur battle wherein a [[monitor lizard]] and a young [[American alligator|alligator]] engage in an unsimulated, fierce battle. On the 1960 ''Lost World'', O'Brien, who did the stop-motion dinosaurs for the original, was hired as the effects technician, but was disappointed that producer Irwin Allen opted for live animals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18539">'''Mode deactivation therapy''' ('''MDT''') is a [[psychotherapy|psychotherapeutic]] approach that addresses dysfunctional emotions, maladaptive behaviors and cognitive processes and contents through a number of [[goal-oriented]], explicit systematic procedures. The name refers to the process of mode deactivation that is based on the concept of cognitive modes as introduced by [[Aaron T. Beck]]. The MDT methodology was developed by [[Jack A. Apsche]] by combining the unique validation–clarification–redirection (VCR) process step with elements from [[acceptance and commitment therapy]] (ACT), [[dialectical behavior therapy]] (DBT), and [[mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]] to bring about durable behavior change.

==Theory==
Mode deactivation therapy (MDT) was developed by [[Jack A. Apsche]] who recognized shortcomings of cognitive theory and cognitive-behavioral therapies, especially for the treatment of populations with complex psychological problems. [[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy]] (CBT) was primarily conceptualized through an integration of [[behavior therapy]] with [[cognitive psychology]] that were formulated by [[Aaron T. Beck]]. As such, the CBT approaches focus primarily on the present rather than the past, behavioral change as the main goal, and current processes that are maintaining the problem rather than the root causes.&lt;ref name=CBT-Intro&gt;{{Cite book |vauthors=Westbrook D, Kennerley H, Kirk J | title= An introduction to Cognitive Behavior Therapy | edition= 2 | publisher= Sage | location= Thousand Oaks, CA | isbn= 9781848606876}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally CBT views problem manifestation as brought about by dysfunctional thinking, which is disputed as irrational beliefs and replaced with the use of logical arguments.

Eventually some practitioners realized that dysfunctional cognitions should not be disputed. As a result, a new wave of cognitive-behavioral therapies began to form, which was termed the "third wave" by Prof. [[Steven C. Hayes]], who went on to develop [[Relational frame theory]] and [[Acceptance and commitment therapy]]. ([[Behaviour therapy]] was the first wave and [[Cognitive therapy]] was the second.) Dr. [[Jack A. Apsche]] agreed in general with this principle, but also believed that there is value in exploring the origins of maladaptive thought processes in addition to validating their existence as reasonable given an individual's past experiences upon which his or her core beliefs are based.

[[Aaron T. Beck]] asserted that how people feel and behave are largely determined by their thought processes or cognitions, which may make us vulnerable to psychological distress. These vulnerabilities are related to personality structures—a person's fundamental beliefs about themselves and the world around them. Personality structures largely develop as a result of responding to environmental stimuli and experiences. When these are distressing and deprive a person of psychological needs, the coping mechanism may be viewed as maladaptive compared with normal circumstances. The personality structures are referred to as cognitive schemas, which—in combinations—inform a person how to behave in a certain situation. Cognitive schemas are often automatically activated and group together to form cognitive modes that are deep-seated and durable behavioral manifestations such as depression and aggression.

In MDT these modes and their associated core beliefs are validated and normalized in the client's perspective by cultivating awareness and acceptance rather than disputing any belief as irrational or "bad". The proposition is that awareness and acceptance improves the therapist-client bond, client cooperation, commitment and motivation, which enables an effective and durable therapeutic change process.

==Practice==
The application of MDT integrates the unique validation–clarification–redirection (VCR) process step with selected elements from [[Acceptance and commitment therapy]], [[Dialectical behavior therapy]], and [[mindfulness (psychology)]] through a systematic and collaborative case conceptualization and implementation process.

===Assessment===
The case conceptualization forms the blueprint of the MDT planning and implementation process, and is based on a systematic assessment procedure that is aimed at identifying, clarifying, and formulating the core beliefs → fears → thoughts and feelings → behavior sequence. First, a semi-structured clinical interview is conducted to form the foundation of further psychometric testing. The client typology survey is completed by the therapist with inputs from the client, parent/guardian, family members, and other records, including arrest and medical where relevant. It includes family information, substance abuse, medical, neglect, physical and sexual abuse and offending history, educational, emotional, behavioral, physiological, and interpersonal information. The expectations of treatment and willingness to cooperate are also noted.

Second, the Strength of Fears Questionnaire is completed and scored. The 60-item 4-point Likert scale responses is scored to examine five sub-categories of fear, namely personal reactive-external, personal reactive-internal/self-concept, environmental, physical, and abuse. The test is sensitive to the detection of trauma and identifies and rates specific fear and associated situations. Life-interfering fears are also identified.

Then, the client completes the Compound Core Beliefs Questionnaire (CCBQ), a 96-item 4-point Likert scale form (short version). The score primarily informs the therapist of the client's personality traits and structure, as well as potential life-threatening and treatment-interfering beliefs. Hereby, the CCBQ helps identify the client's underlying beliefs and thoughts that guide his or her behavior. Each belief is clarified and completed with examples.

===Case conceptualization===
The results and analyses of the client typology, Fear Assessment and Compound Core Beliefs Questionnaire (CCBQ) are used to compile the Triggers, Fears, Avoids, and Compound Core Beliefs Correlation (TFAB) and the Conglomerate of Beliefs and Behaviors (COBB) worksheets. A situational analysis associate the problem beliefs, fears, and behaviors with triggers to identify the mode activation processes that have to be deactivated. The collaborative case conceptualization process is completed with the Functional Treatment Development Form (FTDF), which informs and monitors the treatment planning and progress.

The TFAB form is used to link specific triggers with fears and core beliefs, while the COBB takes the process one step further by associating each core belief with a specific behavior. Now functional alternative beliefs, healthy alternative thoughts and compensatory strategies are identified, which is developed and reinforced through the validation–clarification–redirection (VCR) process.

===Validation–clarification–redirection===
The validation–clarification–redirection (VCR) of the functional alternative belief is what separates MDT from other CBT-based approaches. In validation, the therapist explores the grain of truth in the client's perceptions or beliefs and views them as reasonable responses given his or her life experiences. In clarification, the content of the client's responses is elucidated while awareness and acceptance is encouraged. In redirection, the therapist moves the client towards accepting a functional alternative belief through commitment and motivation to work towards positive alternatives that are more supportive of his or her life goals and aspirations.

===Mindfulness===
[[Mindfulness]] is defined as a mental state achieved by focusing one’s awareness on the present moment, while calmly acknowledging and accepting one’s feelings, thoughts, and bodily sensations. It is helpful to cultivate awareness and acceptance of distressful thoughts and feelings in the present, a state that is necessary to be able to consciously affect change in one's condition. MDT utilizes this perspective to normalize the client's thoughts and feelings, while developing healthier functional alternative beliefs. Remember that problem thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are the products of dysfunctional core beliefs that are often cultivated by distressful events.

==Applications==
MDT was specifically developed as a psychotherapy protocol for adolescents with complex problems such as conduct, mood, and mixed personality disorders that are co-existing with trauma-related and substance abuse issues, aggression. This type of psychopathology constellation is typically associated with childhood abuse and neglect.&lt;ref name="Swart1"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1= Swart | first1= Joan | last2= Apsche | first2= Jack A. | title= Family Mode Deactivation Therapy (FMDT): A randomized controlled trial for adolescents with complex issues | journal= International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy | year= 2014 | volume= 9 | pages= 11–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MDT methodology was proved effective to treat adolescent populations aged 14- to 18-years with a variety of problems. These include [[Conduct disorder]], [[Oppositional defiant disorder]], [[Substance use disorder]], mixed multiple [[Personality disorder]], [[Posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), [[Mood disorder]], [[Aggression]], Sexual offending, and [[Child abuse]].&lt;ref name="Swart1" /&gt; In addition to this complex population, other conditions that are often considered as difficult-to-treat also had effective outcomes compared to traditional CBT approaches. These include aggressive narcissistic, antisocial, and psychopathic youth. Although the research studies to date have not included adults or adolescent females, there are no apparent reason why the MDT treatment approach would not be equally effective for these populations.

MDT is also applied in a family context. In fact, involving the family in the MDT treatment process has proven to be beneficial to improve collaboration, treatment outcome, and durability of changes.&lt;ref name="Swart2"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1= Swart | first1= Joan | last2= Apsche | first2= Jack A. | title= Family Mode Deactivation Therapy (MDT) mediation analysis | journal= International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy | year= 2014 | volume= 9 | pages= 1–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; MDT has been applied in outpatient and institutional settings.

==Evaluation of effectiveness==
To date, there has been 10 separate MDT research studies.&lt;ref name="Swart3"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1= Swart | first1= Joan | last2= Apsche | first2= Jack A. | title= Mode Deactivation Therapy: Reanalysis and Interpretation | journal= International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy | year= in press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results of a meta-analysis suggest that there is a large effect size for both family-based and individual Mode Deactivation Therapy (MDT).&lt;ref name="Bass1"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1= Bass | first1= Cristopher | last2= Apsche | first2= Jack A. | title= Update and review of Mode Deactivation Therapy family and individual meta-analysis | journal= International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy | year= 2014 | volume= 9 | pages= 39–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a significant reduction of all negative behaviors from intake to post-treatment and beyond as measured by the [[Child Behavior Checklist]] (CBCL) and [[State-Trait Anxiety Inventory]] (STAXI-II). Conventional treatments for the same populations produced insignificant change.&lt;ref name="Swart3" /&gt; Applying MDT, the CBCL internalizing and externalizing scales declined by an average of about 35% and the STAXI total anger expression decreased by a similar margin (37%). Comparative improvements with treatment as usual were consistently around 5%.

==Criticisms==
In a review of the 2010-book,&lt;ref name=MDT_Book&gt;{{Cite book |vauthors=Apsche JA, DiMeo L |title= Mode Deactivation Therapy for aggression and oppositional behavior in adolescents: An integrative methodology using ACT, DBT, and CBT |year=2010 |publisher= New Harbinger |location= Oakland, CA  |isbn= 978-1608821075}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nancy Calleja,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1177/1066480713505071 | title= Book review: Mode deactivation therapy for aggression and oppositional behavior in adolescents |year=2014 | last1= Calleja | first1= Nancy D. | journal= The Family Journal | volume= 22 | pages= 135–136}}&lt;/ref&gt; remarked that MDT also incorporated a psychodynamic element by exploring early childhood experiences and deterministic behaviors. "Whereas some believe that this type of theoretical eclecticism is precisely what is needed to treat complex issues, others may have difficulty finding coherence in this type of model." (p.&amp;nbsp;136). Furthermore, as an approach that is claimed to be evidence-based, research that support the conceptual model remain fairly limited, especially independent studies.

'''Multitude''' is a term for a group of people who cannot be classed under any other distinct category, except for their shared fact of existence. The term has a history of use reaching back to antiquity, but took on a strictly political concept when it was first used by [[Machiavelli]] and reiterated by [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]]. The multitude is a concept of a population that has not entered into a social contract with a sovereign political body, such that individuals retain the capacity for political self-determination. A multitude typically classified as a quantity exceeding 100. For [[Hobbes]] the multitude was a rabble that needed to enact a [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|social contract]] with a monarch, thus turning them from a multitude into a people. For Machiavelli and Spinoza both, the role of the multitude vacillates between admiration and contempt. Recently the term has returned to prominence as a new model of resistance against global systems of power as described by political theorists [[Michael Hardt]] and [[Antonio Negri]] in their international best-seller [[Empire (Negri and Hardt book)|''Empire'']] (2000) and expanded upon in their ''[[Multitude: War and Democracy in the Age of Empire]]'' (2004). Other theorists recently began to use the term include political thinkers associated with [[Autonomist Marxism]] and its sequelae, including [[Sylvère Lotringer]], [[Paolo Virno]], and thinkers connected with the eponymous review ''[[Multitudes]]''.

==History==
The concept originates in Machiavelli’s ''[[Discourses on Livy|Discorsi]]''. It is, however, with [[Hobbes]]'s recasting of the concept as the war-disposed, dissolute pole of the opposition between a Multitude and a People in ''[[De Cive]]'', that Spinoza’s conceptualization seems, according to Negri, contrasted.&lt;ref&gt;Negri, ''The Savage Anomaly'', pp. 109, 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

The multitude is used as a term and implied as a concept throughout Spinoza's work. In the ''[[Tractatus Theologico-Politicus]]'', for instance, he acknowledges that the (fear of
the) power (potentia) of the multitude is the limit of sovereign power (potestas): ‘Every ruler has
more to fear from his own citizens […] than from any foreign enemy, and it is this “fear of the
masses” […that is] the principal brake on the power of the sovereign or state.’ The explication of
this tacit concept, however, only comes in Spinoza's last and unfinished work known as the ''[[Political Treatise]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;It must next be observed, that in laying foundations it is very necessary to study the human passions: and it is not enough to have shown, what ought to be done, but it ought, above all, to be shown how it can be effected, that men, whether led by passion or reason, should yet keep the laws firm and unbroken. For if the constitution of the dominion, or the public liberty depends only on the weak assistance of the laws, not only will the citizens have no security for its maintenance […], but it will even turn to their ruin. […] And, therefore, it would be far better for the subjects to transfer their rights absolutely to one man, than to bargain for unascertained and empty, that is unmeaning, terms of liberty, and so prepare for their posterity a way to the most cruel servitude. But if I succeed in showing that the foundation of monarchical dominion […], are firm and cannot be plucked up, without the indignation of the larger part of an armed multitude, and that from them follow peace and security for king and multitude, and if I deduce this from general human nature, no one will be able to doubt, that these foundations are the best and the true ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The concept of the multitude resolves the tension that scholars have observed in Spinoza’s
political project between the insistence on the benign function of sovereignty (as witnessed in the
quotation above) and the insistence on individual freedom. It is, we see here, a truly
revolutionary concept, and it is not difficult to see why Spinoza’s contemporaries (and, as for instance [[Étienne Balibar]] has implied, even Spinoza himself {{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}) saw it as a dangerous political idea.

==Reiteration by Negri and Hardt==
Negri describes the multitude in his ''The Savage Anomaly'' as an unmediated, [[revolutionary]], immanent, and positive collective social subject which can found a ‘nonmystified’ form of democracy (p.&amp;nbsp;194). In his more recent writings with [[Michael Hardt]], however, he does not so much offer a direct definition, but presents the concept through a series of mediations. In [[Empire (Negri and Hardt book)|''Empire'']] it is mediated by the concept of Empire (the new global constitution that Negri and Hardt describe as a copy of [[Polybius]]'s description of Roman government):

&lt;blockquote&gt;New figures of struggle and new subjectivities are produced in the conjecture of events, in the universal nomadism […] They are not posed merely against the imperial system—they are not simply negative forces. They also express, nourish, and develop positively their own constituent projects. […] This constituent aspect of the movement of the multitude, in its myriad faces, is really the positive terrain of the historical construction of Empire, […] an antagonistic and creative positivity. The deterritorializing power of the multitude is the productive force that sustains Empire and at the same time the force that calls for and makes necessary its destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; as to this 'positive' or 'constituent' aspect of the Multitude:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Certainly, there must be a moment when reappropriation [of wealth from capital] and selforganization [of the multitude] reach a threshold and configure a real event. This is when the political is really affirmed—when the genesis is complete and self-valorization, the cooperative convergence of subjects, and the proletarian management of production become a constituent power. […] We do not have any models to offer for this event. Only the multitude through its practical experimentation will offer the models and determine when and how the possible becomes real.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In their sequel ''[[Multitude: War and Democracy in the Age of Empire]]'' they still refrain from a clear definition of the concept but approach the concept through mediation of a host of ‘contemporary’ phenomena, most importantly the new type of postmodern war they postulate and the history of post-WWII resistance movements. It remains a rather vague concept which is assigned a revolutionary potential without much theoretical substantiation apart from a generic potential of love.

Sylvère Lotringer has criticized Negri and Hardt's use of the concept for its ostensible return to the dialectical dualism in the introduction to Paulo Virno's ''A Grammar of the Multitude'' (see external links).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17040">In [[philosophy]] and [[mathematics]], '''Newcomb's paradox''', also referred to as '''Newcomb's problem''', is a [[thought experiment]] involving a game between two players, one of whom purports to be able to predict the future. Whether the problem actually is a [[paradox]] is disputed.

Newcomb's paradox was created by [[William Newcomb]] of the [[University of California]]'s [[Lawrence Livermore Laboratory]]. However, it was first analyzed and was published in a philosophy paper spread to the philosophical community by [[Robert Nozick]] in 1969,&lt;ref name='nozick'&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Nozick|title=Essays in Honor of Carl G Hempel|chapter=Newcomb's Problem and Two Principles of Choice|url=http://faculty.arts.ubc.ca/rjohns/nozick_newcomb.pdf|editor-last=Rescher|editor-first=Nicholas|year=1969|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appeared in the March 1973 issue of Scientific American, in [[Martin Gardner]]'s "[[Mathematical Games (column)|Mathematical Games]]."&lt;ref name='sciam'&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Scientific American|author=Gardner, Martin|date=March 1974|title=Mathematical Games|at=p. 102}} Reprinted with an addendum and annotated bibliography in his book ''The Colossal Book of Mathematics'' ({{ISBN|0-393-02023-1}})&lt;/ref&gt; Today it is a much debated problem in the philosophical branch of [[decision theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Causal Decision Theory|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/decision-causal/|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=The Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The problem==
There is a predictor, a player, and two boxes designated A and B. The player is given a choice between taking only box B, or taking both boxes A and B. The player knows the following:&lt;ref name="Wolpert"&gt;{{cite journal |first=D. H. |last=Wolpert |first2=G. |last2=Benford |title=The lesson of Newcomb's paradox |journal=[[Synthese]]|date=June 2013 |volume=190 |issue=9 |pages=1637–1646 |doi=10.1007/s11229-011-9899-3 |jstor=41931515}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Box A is clear, and always contains a visible $1,000.
* Box B is opaque, and its content has already been set by the predictor:
** If the predictor has predicted the player will take both boxes A and B, then box B contains nothing.
** If the predictor has predicted that the player will take only box B, then box B contains $1,000,000.
Even while the player knows the above, he does not know what prediction has been made prior to his making a choice.

==Game theory strategies==
{| class="wikitable"
! Predicted choice !! Actual choice !! Payout

|-
|A + B || B || $0
|-
|B || A + B || $1,001,000
|-
|B || B || $1,000,000
|}
In his 1969 article, Nozick noted that "To almost everyone, it is perfectly clear and obvious what should be done. The difficulty is that these people seem to divide almost evenly on the problem, with large numbers thinking that the opposing half is just being silly."&lt;ref name="Wolpert" /&gt; The problem continues to divide philosophers today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bellos|first1=Alex|title=Newcomb's problem divides philosophers. Which side are you on?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/alexs-adventures-in-numberland/2016/nov/28/newcombs-problem-divides-philosophers-which-side-are-you-on|accessdate=13 April 2018|work=the Guardian|date=28 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bourget, D., &amp; Chalmers, D. J. (2014). What do philosophers believe?. Philosophical Studies, 170(3), 465-500.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Game theory]] offers two strategies for this game that rely on different principles: the [[expected utility hypothesis|expected utility]] principle and the [[strategic dominance]] principle. The problem is called a ''paradox'' because two analyses that both sound intuitively logical give conflicting answers to the question of what choice maximizes the player's payout.
* Considering the expected utility when the probability of the predictor being right is almost certain or certain, the player should choose box B. This choice statistically maximizes the player's winnings, setting them at about $1,000,000 per game.
* Under the dominance principle, the player should choose the strategy that is ''always'' better; choosing both boxes A and B will ''always'' yield $1,000 more than only choosing B. However, the expected utility of "always $1,000 more than B" depends on the statistical payout of the game; when the predictor's prediction is almost certain or certain, choosing both A and B sets player's winnings at about $1,000 per game.

[[David Wolpert]] and [[Gregory Benford]] suggest that there is no conflict between the two strategies; Newcomb's problem actually represents two different games with different probabilistic outcomes, and the conflict arises because of this imprecise definition of the game. They also note that the optimal strategy for either of the games does not depend on the infallibility of the predictor, and the questions of causality, determinism, and free will do not factor into these strategies.&lt;ref name="Wolpert" /&gt;

==Causality and free will==
{| class="wikitable"
! Predicted choice !! Actual choice !! Payout
|-
|A + B || A + B || $1,000
|-
|B || B || $1,000,000
|}
Causality issues arise when the predictor is posited as [[infallible]] and incapable of error; Nozick avoids this issue by positing that the predictor's predictions are "''almost'' certainly" correct, thus sidestepping any issues of infallibility and causality. Nozick also stipulates that if the predictor predicts that the player will choose randomly, then box B will contain nothing. This assumes that inherently random or unpredictable events would not come into play anyway during the process of making the choice, such as [[free will]] or [[quantum mind]] processes.&lt;ref name='langan'&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Noesis|author=Christopher Langan|issue=44|title=The Resolution of Newcomb's Paradox|url=http://megasociety.org/noesis/44/newcomb.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these issues can still be explored in the case of an infallible predictor. Under this condition, it seems that taking only B is the correct option. This analysis argues that we can ignore the possibilities that return $0 and $1,001,000, as they both require that the predictor has made an incorrect prediction, and the problem states that the predictor is never wrong. Thus, the choice becomes whether to take both boxes with $1,000 or to take only box B with $1,000,000—so taking only box B is always better.

[[William Lane Craig]] has suggested that, in a world with perfect predictors (or [[Time travel|time machines]], because a time machine could be used as a mechanism for making a prediction), [[retrocausality]] can occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Craig |year=1987 |url=http://www.leaderu.com/offices/billcraig/docs/newcomb.html |title=Divine Foreknowledge and Newcomb's Paradox |journal=Philosophia |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=331–350 |doi=10.1007/BF02455055}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a person truly knows the future, and that knowledge affects their actions, then events in the future will be causing effects in the past. The chooser's choice will have already ''caused'' the predictor's action. Some have concluded that if time machines or perfect predictors can exist, then there can be no [[free will]] and choosers will do whatever they're fated to do. Taken together, the paradox is a restatement of the old contention that free will and [[determinism]] are incompatible, since determinism enables the existence of perfect predictors. Put another way, this paradox can be equivalent to the [[grandfather paradox]]; the paradox presupposes a perfect predictor, implying the "chooser" is not free to choose, yet simultaneously presumes a choice can be debated and decided. This suggests to some that the paradox is an artifact of these contradictory assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Craig |first=William Lane |authorlink=William Lane Craig |year=1988 |title=Tachyons, Time Travel, and Divine Omniscience |journal=[[The Journal of Philosophy]] |volume=85 |issue=3 |pages=135–150 |jstor=2027068|doi=10.2307/2027068 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gary Drescher]] argues in his book ''Good and Real'' that the correct decision is to take only box B, by appealing to a situation he argues is analogous—a rational agent in a deterministic universe deciding whether or not to cross a potentially busy street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Drescher |first=Gary |authorlink=Gary Drescher |year=2006 |title=Good and Real: Demystifying Paradoxes from Physics to Ethics |isbn=978-0262042338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrew David Irvine|Andrew Irvine]] argues that the problem is structurally isomorphic to [[Braess' paradox]], a non-intuitive but ultimately non-paradoxical result concerning equilibrium points in physical systems of various kinds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Andrew |last=Irvine |title=How Braess' paradox solves Newcomb's problem |journal=International Studies in the Philosophy of Science |volume=7 |issue=2 |year=1993 |pages=141–60 |doi=10.1080/02698599308573460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influencing the predictor==
Simon Burgess has argued that we need to recognize two stages to the problem. The first stage is that before which the predictor has gained all the information on which the prediction will be based. If, for example, we suppose that the prediction is at least partially based on a brain scan of the player then the first stage will not be over at least until that brain scan has been taken. An important point to appreciate is that while the player is still in that first stage, they will presumably be able to influence the predictor's prediction (e.g., by committing to taking only one box). The second stage commences after the completion of the brain scan (and/or after the gathering of any other information on which the prediction is based). As Burgess points out, the first stage is the one in which all of us currently find ourselves. Moreover, there is a clear sense in which the first stage is more significant than the second because it is then that the player can determine whether the $1,000,000 is in box B. Once they get to the second stage, the best that can be done is to determine whether to get the $1,000 in box A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burgess|first=Simon|title=Newcomb's problem: an unqualified resolution|journal=Synthese|date=January 2004|volume=138|issue=2|pages=261–287|doi=10.1023/b:synt.0000013243.57433.e7 |jstor=20118389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those persuaded by Burgess's approach do not say either that it is simply rational to take just box B or that it is conversely rational to take both boxes, but
rather argue a player should make their decision while in the first stage and that that decision should be to commit to only box B. Once in the second stage, the rational decision would be to take both boxes, although by that stage the player should already have made up their mind to take just box B. Burgess has repeatedly emphasized that he is not arguing that the player should change their mind on getting to the second stage. The safe and rational strategy to adopt is to simply make a commitment to just box B while in the first stage and to have no intention of wavering from that commitment, i.e., make an 'unqualified resolution'. Burgess points out that those who make no such commitment and therefore miss out on the $1,000,000 have simply failed to be prepared. In a more recent paper Burgess has explained that, given his analysis, Newcomb's problem should be seen as being akin to the [[Kavka's toxin puzzle|toxin puzzle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burgess|first=Simon|title=Newcomb's problem and its conditional evidence: a common cause of confusion|journal=Synthese |date=February 2012 |volume=184 |issue=3 |pages=319–339 |doi=10.1007/s11229-010-9816-1 |jstor=41411196}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because both problems highlight the fact that one can have a reason to intend to do something without having a reason to actually do it.

With regard to causal structure, Burgess has consistently followed Ellery Eells and others in treating Newcomb's problem as a common cause problem. Contrary to David Lewis, he argues against the idea that Newcomb's problem is another version of the [[prisoner's dilemma]]. Burgess's argument on this point emphasizes the contrasting causal structures of the two problems.

==Consciousness==
Newcomb's paradox can also be related to the question of machine consciousness, specifically if a perfect simulation of a person's brain will generate the consciousness of that person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |first=R. M. |last=Neal |title=Puzzles of Anthropic Reasoning Resolved Using Full Non-indexical Conditioning |work=|eprint=math.ST/0608592  |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Suppose we take the predictor to be a machine that arrives at its prediction by simulating the brain of the chooser when confronted with the problem of which box to choose. If that simulation generates the consciousness of the chooser, then the chooser cannot tell whether they are standing in front of the boxes in the real world or in the virtual world generated by the simulation in the past. The "virtual" chooser would thus tell the predictor which choice the "real" chooser is going to make.

==Fatalism==
Newcomb's paradox is related to [[fatalism|logical fatalism]] in that they both suppose absolute certainty of the future. In logical fatalism, this assumption of certainty creates circular reasoning ("a future event is certain to happen, therefore it is certain to happen"), while Newcomb's paradox considers whether the participants of its game are able to affect a predestined outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Dummett|first1=Michael|title=The Seas of Language|publisher=Clarendon Press Oxford|year=1996|pages=352–358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extensions to Newcomb's problem==
Many thought experiments similar to or based on Newcomb's problem have been discussed in the literature.&lt;ref name='nozick'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Yudkowsky-TDT'&gt;[http://intelligence.org/files/TDT.pdf Timeless Decision Theory]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a quantum-theoretical version of Newcomb's problem in which box B is [[quantum entanglement|entangled]] with box A has been proposed.&lt;ref name='Piotrowski'&gt;{{cite journal|journal=International Journal of Quantum Information|volume=1|issue=3|year=2003|pages=395–402|url=http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S0219749903000279|author1=Piotrowski, Edward|author2=Jan Sladowski |title=Quantum solution to the Newcomb's paradox|doi=10.1142/S0219749903000279|arxiv=quant-ph/0202074}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The meta-Newcomb problem===
Another related problem is the meta-Newcomb problem.&lt;ref name='bostrom'&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Analysis|volume=61|issue=4|author=Bostrom, Nick|year=2001|title=The Meta-Newcomb Problem|pages=309–310|doi=10.1093/analys/61.4.309}}&lt;/ref&gt; The setup of this problem is similar to the original Newcomb problem. However, the twist here is that the predictor may elect to decide whether to fill box B after the player has made a choice, and the player does not know whether box B has already been filled. There is also another predictor: a "meta-predictor" who has correctly predicted ''every'' outcome in the past, and who predicts the following: "Either you will choose both boxes, and the predictor will make its decision after you, or you will choose only box B, and the predictor will already have made its decision."

In this situation, a proponent of choosing both boxes is faced with the following dilemma: if the player chooses both boxes, the predictor will not yet have made its decision, and therefore a more rational choice would be for the player to choose box B only. But if the player so chooses, the predictor will already have made its decision, making it impossible for the player's decision to affect the predictor's decision.&lt;ref name='Yudkowsky-TDT'/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9232">'''Philosophical analysis''' (from {{lang-el|Φιλοσοφική ανάλυση}}) is the techniques typically used by [[philosopher]]s in the [[analytic philosophy|analytic tradition]] that involve "breaking down" (i.e. analyzing) philosophical issues. Arguably the most prominent of these techniques is the analysis of [[concept]]s (known as ''conceptual analysis'').

==Method of analysis==
While analysis is characteristic of the analytic tradition in philosophy, what is to be analyzed (the ''analysandum'') often varies. Some philosophers focus on analyzing linguistic phenomena, such as [[sentence (linguistics)|sentences]], while others focus on psychological phenomena, such as [[sense data]]. However, arguably the most prominent analyses are of concepts or [[proposition]]s, which is known as ''conceptual analysis'' (Foley 1996).

Conceptual analysis consists primarily in breaking down or analyzing concepts into their constituent parts in order to gain knowledge or a better understanding of a particular philosophical issue in which the concept is involved (Beaney 2003). For example, the [[problem of free will]] in philosophy involves various key concepts, including the concepts of freedom, moral responsibility, determinism, ability, etc. The method of conceptual analysis tends to approach such a problem by breaking down the key concepts pertaining to the problem and seeing how they interact. Thus, in the long-standing debate on whether [[free will]] is compatible with the doctrine of [[determinism]], several philosophers have proposed analyses of the relevant concepts to argue for either [[compatibilism]] or [[incompatibilism]].

A famous author of conceptual analysis at its best is Bertrand Russell's [[theory of descriptions]]. Russell attempted to analyze propositions that involved ''definite descriptions'' (such as "The tallest spy"), which pick out a unique individual, and ''indefinite descriptions'' (such as "a spy"), which pick out a set of individuals. Take Russell's analysis of definite descriptions as an example.&lt;ref&gt;Note that this explication is only of a part of Russell's theory of descriptions and is quite brief and oversimplified.&lt;/ref&gt; Superficially, definite descriptions have the standard subject-predicate form of a proposition. For example, "The present [[king of France]] is [[baldness|bald]]" appears to be predicating "baldness" of the subject "the present king of France". However, Russell noted that this is problematic, because there is no present king of France (France is [[France#Republics and Empires (1792-)|no longer a monarchy]]). Normally, to decide whether a proposition of the standard subject-predicate form is true or false, one checks whether the subject is in the extension of the predicate. The proposition is then true if and only if the subject is in the extension of the predicate. The problem is that there is no present king of France, so the present king of France cannot be found on the list of bald things or non-bald things. So, it would appear that the proposition expressed by "The present king of France is bald" is neither true nor false. However, analyzing the relevant concepts and propositions, Russell proposed that what definite descriptions really express are not propositions of the subject-predicate form, but rather they express existentially quantified propositions. Thus, "The present king of France" is ''analyzed'', according to Russell's theory of descriptions, as "There exists an individual who is currently the king of France, there is only one such individual, and that individual is bald." Now one can determine the [[truth value]] of the proposition. Indeed, it is false, because it is not the case that there exists a unique individual who is currently the king of France and is bald—since there is no present king of France (Bertolet 1999).

==Controversy==
While the method of analysis is characteristic of contemporary analytic philosophy, its status continues to be a source of great controversy even among analytic philosophers. Several current criticisms of the analytic method derive from W.V. Quine's famous rejection of the [[analytic–synthetic distinction]]. While Quine's critique is well-known, it is highly controversial.

Further, the analytic method seems to rely on some sort of definitional structure of concepts, so that one can give necessary and sufficient conditions for the application of the concept. For example, the concept "bachelor" is often analyzed as having the concepts "unmarried" and "male" as its components. Thus, the definition or analysis of "bachelor" is thought to be an unmarried male. But one might worry that these so-called necessary and sufficient conditions do not apply in every case. Wittgenstein, for instance, argues that language (e.g., the word 'bachelor') is used for various purposes and in an indefinite number of ways. Wittgenstein's famous thesis states that meaning is determined by use. This means that, in each case, the meaning of 'bachelor' is determined by its use in a context. So if it can be shown that the word means different things across different contexts of use, then cases where its meaning cannot be essentially defined as 'married bachelor' seem to constitute counterexamples to this method of analysis. This is just one example of a critique of the analytic method derived from a critique of definitions. There are several other such critiques (Margolis &amp; Laurence 2006). This criticism is often said to have originated primarily with Wittgenstein's ''Philosophical Investigations''.

A third critique of the method of analysis derives primarily from psychological critiques of [[intuition (psychology)|intuition]]. A key part of the analytic method involves analyzing concepts via "intuition tests". Philosophers tend to motivate various conceptual analyses by appeal to their intuitions about thought experiments. (See DePaul and Ramsey (1998) for a collection of current essays on the controversy over analysis as it relates to intuition and [[reflective equilibrium]].)

In short, some philosophers feel strongly that the analytic method (especially conceptual analysis) is essential to and defines philosophy—e.g. Jackson (1998), Chalmers (1996), and Bealer (1998). Yet, some philosophers argue that the method of analysis is problematic—e.g. Stich (1998) and Ramsey (1998). Some, however, take the middle ground and argue that while analysis is largely a fruitful method of inquiry, philosophers should not limit themselves to only using the method of analysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9632">'''Pontryagin's maximum (or minimum) principle''' is used in [[optimal control]] theory to find the best possible control for taking a [[dynamical system]] from one state to another, especially in the presence of constraints for the state or input controls. It was formulated in 1956 by the Russian mathematician [[Lev Pontryagin]] and his students.&lt;ref&gt;See ref. below for first published work.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has as a special case the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]] of the [[calculus of variations]].

The principle states, informally, that the ''control Hamiltonian'' must take an extreme value over controls in the set of all permissible controls. Whether the extreme value is maximum or minimum depends both on the problem and on the sign convention used for defining the Hamiltonian. The normal convention, which is the one used in [[Hamiltonian (control theory)|Hamiltonian]], leads to a maximum hence ''maximum principle'' but the sign convention used in this article makes the extreme value a minimum.

If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of values of permissible controls then the principle states that the optimal control &lt;math&gt;u^*&lt;/math&gt; must satisfy:
:&lt;math&gt;H(x^*(t),u^*(t),\lambda^*(t),t) \leq H(x^*(t),u,\lambda^*(t),t), \quad \forall u \in \mathcal{U}, \quad t \in [t_0, t_f]&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x^*\in C^1[t_0,t_f]&lt;/math&gt; is the optimal state trajectory and &lt;math&gt;\lambda^* \in BV[t_0,t_f]&lt;/math&gt; is the optimal [[costate]] trajectory.&lt;ref&gt;More info on [[Smoothness#Order of continuity|C&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]] and [[Bounded variation|BV]] spaces&lt;/ref&gt;

The result was first successfully applied to minimum time problems where the input control is constrained, but it can also be useful in studying state-constrained problems.

Special conditions for the Hamiltonian can also be derived. When the final time &lt;math&gt;t_f&lt;/math&gt; is fixed and the Hamiltonian does not depend explicitly on time &lt;math&gt;\left(\tfrac{\partial H}{\partial t} \equiv 0\right)&lt;/math&gt;, then:
:&lt;math&gt;H(x^*(t),u^*(t),\lambda^*(t)) \equiv \mathrm{constant}\,&lt;/math&gt;
and if the final time is free, then:
:&lt;math&gt;H(x^*(t),u^*(t),\lambda^*(t)) \equiv 0.\,&lt;/math&gt;
More general conditions on the optimal control are given below.

When satisfied along a trajectory, Pontryagin's minimum principle is a [[necessary condition]] for an optimum. The [[Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation]] provides a [[Necessity and sufficiency|necessary and sufficient condition]] for an optimum, but this condition must be satisfied over the whole of the state space.

While the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation admits [[Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation#Extension to stochastic problems|a straightforward extension]] to stochastic optimal control problems, the minimum principle does not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yong|first1=J.|last2=Zhou|first2=X. Y.|title=Stochastic Controls: Hamiltonian Systems and HJB Equations|date=1999|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maximization and minimization==

The principle was first known as ''Pontryagin's maximum principle'' and its proof is historically based on maximizing the Hamiltonian. The initial application of this principle was to the maximization of the terminal speed of a rocket. However, as it was subsequently mostly used for minimization of a performance index it has here been referred to as the ''minimum principle''.  Pontryagin's book solved the problem of minimizing a performance index.&lt;ref&gt;See p.13 of the 1962 book of Pontryagin et al. referenced below.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notation==
In what follows we will be making use of the following notation.
:&lt;math&gt;
\Psi_T(x(T))= \frac{\partial \Psi(x)}{\partial T}|_{x=x(T)} \,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\Psi_x(x(T))=\begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial
\Psi(x)}{\partial x_1}|_{x=x(T)} &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial
\Psi(x)}{\partial x_n} |_{x=x(T)}
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
H_x(x^*,u^*,\lambda^*,t)=\begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_1}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*,\lambda=\lambda^*}
&amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_n}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*,\lambda=\lambda^*}
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
L_x(x^*,u^*)=\begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_1}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*}
&amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_n}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*}
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
f_x(x^*,u^*)=\begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_1}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*} &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_n}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*} \\
\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ \frac{\partial f_n}{\partial x_1}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*} &amp;
\ldots &amp; \frac{\partial f_n}{\partial x_n}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*}
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Formal statement of necessary conditions for minimization problem==
Here the necessary conditions are shown for minimization of a functional. Take &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to be the state of the [[dynamical system]] with input &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, such that
:&lt;math&gt;
\dot{x}=f(x,u), \quad x(0)=x_0, \quad u(t) \in \mathcal{U}, \quad t \in
[0,T]
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of admissible controls and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the terminal (i.e., final) time of the system. The control &lt;math&gt;u \in \mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; must be chosen for all &lt;math&gt;t \in [0,T]&lt;/math&gt; to minimize the objective functional &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; which is defined by the application and can be abstracted as

:&lt;math&gt;
J=\Psi(x(T))+\int^T_0 L(x(t),u(t)) \,dt
&lt;/math&gt;

The constraints on the system dynamics can be adjoined to the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; by introducing time-varying [[Lagrange multipliers|Lagrange multiplier]] vector &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, whose elements are called the costates of the system. This motivates the construction of the [[Hamiltonian (control theory)|Hamiltonian]] &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; defined for all &lt;math&gt;t \in [0,T]&lt;/math&gt; by:
:&lt;math&gt;
H(x(t),u(t),\lambda(t),t)=\lambda^{\rm T}(t)f(x(t),u(t))+L(x(t),u(t)) \,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\lambda^{\rm T}&lt;/math&gt; is the transpose of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

Pontryagin's minimum principle states that the optimal state trajectory &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt;, optimal control &lt;math&gt;u^*&lt;/math&gt;, and corresponding Lagrange multiplier vector &lt;math&gt;\lambda^*&lt;/math&gt; must  minimize the Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; so that

:&lt;math&gt;
(1) \qquad H(x^*(t),u^*(t),\lambda^*(t),t)\leq H(x^*(t),u,\lambda^*(t),t) \,
&lt;/math&gt;

for all time &lt;math&gt;t \in [0,T]&lt;/math&gt; and for all permissible control inputs &lt;math&gt;u \in \mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;. It must also be the case that

:&lt;math&gt;
(2) \qquad \Psi_T(x(T))+H(T)=0 \,
&lt;/math&gt;

Additionally, the [[costate equations]]

:&lt;math&gt;
(3) \qquad -\dot{\lambda}^{\rm T}(t)=H_x(x^*(t),u^*(t),\lambda(t),t)=\lambda^{\rm T}(t)f_x(x^*(t),u^*(t))+L_x(x^*(t),u^*(t))
&lt;/math&gt;

must be satisfied. If the final state &lt;math&gt;x(T)&lt;/math&gt; is not fixed (i.e., its differential variation is not zero), it must also be that the terminal costates are such that

:&lt;math&gt;
(4) \qquad \lambda^{\rm T}(T)=\Psi_x(x(T)) \,
&lt;/math&gt;

These four conditions in (1)-(4) are the necessary conditions for an optimal control. Note that (4) only applies when &lt;math&gt;x(T)&lt;/math&gt; is free. If it is fixed, then this condition is not necessary for an optimum.

The word [[probability]] has been used in a variety of ways since it was first applied to the mathematical study of [[games of chance]].  Does probability measure the real, physical tendency of something to occur or is it a measure of how strongly one believes it will occur, or does it draw on both these elements?  In answering such questions, mathematicians interpret the probability values of [[probability theory]].

There are two broad categories&lt;ref name=SEPIP&gt;{{Citation

"There are several schools of thought regarding the interpretation of probabilities, none of them without flaws, internal contradictions, or paradoxes." (p 1129) 
"There are no standard classifications of probability interpretations, and even the more popular ones may suffer subtle variations from text to text." (p 1130) 
The classification in this article is representative, as are the authors and ideas claimed for each classification.&lt;/ref&gt; of '''probability interpretations''' which can be called "physical" and "evidential" probabilities.  Physical probabilities, which are also called objective or [[frequency probability|frequency probabilities]], are associated with random physical systems such as roulette wheels, rolling dice and radioactive atoms.  In such systems, a given type of event (such as a die yielding a six) tends to occur at a persistent rate, or "relative frequency", in a long run of trials.  Physical probabilities either explain, or are invoked to explain, these stable frequencies. The two main kinds of theory of physical probability are [[frequency probability|frequentist]] accounts (such as those of Venn,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Logic of Chance |last= Venn |first= John |authorlink= John Venn |year= 1876 |publisher= MacMillan |location= London |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=es0AAAAAcAAJ |accessdate=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reichenbach&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The theory of probability, an inquiry into the logical and mathematical foundations of the calculus of probability |last= Reichenbach |first= Hans |authorlink= Hans Reichenbach |year= 1948 |publisher= University of California Press}}  English translation of the original 1935 German.

Evidential probability, also called [[Bayesian probability]], can be assigned to any statement whatsoever, even when no random process is involved, as a way to represent its subjective plausibility, or the degree to which the statement is supported by the available evidence.  On most accounts, evidential probabilities are considered to be degrees of belief, defined in terms of dispositions to gamble at certain odds.  The four main evidential interpretations are the classical (e.g. Laplace's)&lt;ref name=LaPlace /&gt; interpretation, the subjective interpretation (de Finetti&lt;ref name=deF&gt;{{cite book |last1= de Finetti |first1= Bruno |authorlink1= Bruno de Finetti |editor1-first= H.

There are also evidential interpretations of probability covering groups, which are often labelled as 'intersubjective' (proposed by [[Donald A. Gillies|Gillies]]&lt;ref name=gil&gt;{{cite book | last = Gillies | first = Donald |authorlink= Donald A.

Some interpretations of probability are associated with approaches to [[statistical inference]], including theories of [[estimation theory|estimation]] and [[Statistical hypothesis testing|hypothesis testing]].  The physical interpretation, for example, is taken by followers of "frequentist" statistical methods, such as [[Ronald Fisher]], [[Jerzy Neyman]] and [[Egon Pearson]]. Statisticians of the opposing [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] school typically accept the existence and importance of physical probabilities, but also consider the calculation of evidential probabilities to be both valid and necessary in statistics.  This article, however, focuses on the interpretations of probability rather than theories of statistical inference.

The terminology of this topic is rather confusing, in part because probabilities are studied within a variety of academic fields. The word "frequentist" is especially tricky. To philosophers it refers to a particular theory of physical probability, one that has more or less been abandoned. To scientists, on the other hand, "[[frequentist probability]]" is just another name for physical (or objective) probability. Those who promote Bayesian inference view "frequentist statistics" as an approach to statistical inference that recognises only physical probabilities.  Also the word "objective", as applied to probability, sometimes means exactly what "physical" means here, but is also used of evidential probabilities that are fixed by rational constraints, such as logical and epistemic probabilities.

{{quote|It is unanimously agreed that statistics depends somehow on probability. But, as to what probability is and how it is connected with statistics, there has seldom been such complete disagreement and breakdown of communication since the Tower of Babel. Doubtless, much of the disagreement is merely terminological and would disappear under sufficiently sharp analysis.|(Savage, 1954, p 2)&lt;ref name=savage /&gt;}}

==Philosophy==
The '''philosophy of probability''' presents problems chiefly in matters of [[epistemology]] and the uneasy interface between [[mathematics|mathematical]] concepts and ordinary language as it is used by non-mathematicians.
[[Probability theory]] is an established field of study in mathematics.  It has its origins in correspondence discussing the mathematics of [[games of chance]] between [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Pierre de Fermat]] in the seventeenth century,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~bskyrms/bio/readings/pascal_fermat.pdf Fermat and Pascal on Probability] (@ socsci.uci.edu)&lt;/ref&gt; and was formalized and rendered [[axiom]]atic as a distinct branch of mathematics by [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] in the twentieth century.  In axiomatic form, mathematical statements about probability theory carry the same sort of epistemological confidence within the [[philosophy of mathematics]] as are shared by other mathematical statements.&lt;ref&gt;Laszlo E. Szabo, ''[http://philosophy.elte.hu/colloquium/2001/October/Szabo/angol011008/angol011008.html A Physicalist Interpretation of Probability]'' (Talk presented on the Philosophy of Science Seminar, Eötvös, Budapest, 8 October 2001.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laszlo E. Szabo, Objective probability-like things with and without  objective indeterminism, Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics 38 (2007) 626–634 (''[http://philosophy.elte.hu/leszabo/Preprints/lesz_no_probability_preprint.pdf Preprint]'')&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematical analysis originated in observations of the behaviour of game equipment such as [[playing card]]s and [[dice]], which are designed specifically to introduce random and equalized elements; in mathematical terms, they are subjects of [[Principle of indifference|indifference]].  This is not the only way probabilistic statements are used in ordinary human language: when people say that "''it will probably rain''", they typically do not mean that the outcome of rain versus not-rain is a random factor that the odds currently favor; instead, such statements are perhaps better understood as qualifying their expectation of rain with a degree of confidence.  Likewise, when it is written that "the most probable explanation" of the name of [[Ludlow, Massachusetts]] "is that it was named after [[Roger Ludlow]]", what is meant here is not that Roger Ludlow is favored by a random factor, but rather that this is the most plausible explanation of the evidence, which admits other, less likely explanations.

[[Thomas Bayes]] attempted to provide a [[logic]] that could handle varying degrees of confidence; as such, [[Bayesian probability]] is an attempt to recast the representation of probabilistic statements as an expression of the degree of confidence by which the beliefs they express are held.

Though probability initially had somewhat mundane motivations, its modern influence and use is widespread ranging from [[evidence-based medicine]], through [[Six sigma]], all the way to the [[Probabilistically checkable proof]] and the [[String theory landscape]].

==Classical definition==
{{Main|Classical definition of probability}}
The first attempt at mathematical rigour in the field of probability, championed by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], is now known as the '''classical definition'''. Developed from studies of games of chance (such as rolling [[dice]]) it states that probability is shared equally between all the possible outcomes, provided these outcomes can be deemed equally likely.&lt;ref name=SEPIP /&gt; (3.1)

{{Quotation|The theory of chance consists in reducing all the events of the same kind to a certain number of cases equally possible, that is to say, to such as we may be equally undecided about in regard to their existence, and in determining the number of cases favorable to the event whose probability is sought. The ratio of this number to that of all the cases possible is the measure of this probability, which is thus simply a fraction whose numerator is the number of favorable cases and whose denominator is the number of all the cases possible.|Pierre-Simon Laplace|A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities&lt;ref name=LaPlace&gt;Laplace, P. S., 1814, English edition 1951, A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities, New York: Dover Publications Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{clear}}
[[Image:Dice.jpg|thumb|180px|right|The classical definition of probability works well for situations with only a finite number of equally-likely outcomes.]]
This can be represented mathematically as follows:
If a random experiment can result in N mutually exclusive and equally likely outcomes and if N&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; of these outcomes result in the occurrence of the event A, the '''probability of A''' is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;P(A) = {N_A \over N} &lt;/math&gt;.

There are two clear limitations to the classical definition.&lt;ref name="Spanos"&gt;{{cite book | last = Spanos | first = Aris | title = Statistical foundations of econometric modelling | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 1986 | isbn = 978-0521269124 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, it is applicable only to situations in which there is only a 'finite' number of possible outcomes. But some important random experiments, such as tossing a [[coin]] until it rises heads, give rise to an [[Infinity|infinite]] set of outcomes. And secondly, you need to determine in advance that all the possible outcomes are equally likely without relying on the notion of probability to avoid circularity—for instance, by symmetry considerations.

==Frequentism==
[[Image:Roulette wheel.jpg|left|200px|thumb|For frequentists, the probability of the ball landing in any pocket can be determined only by repeated trials in which the observed result converges to the underlying probability ''in the long run''.]]
{{Main|Frequency probability}}
Frequentists posit that the probability of an event is its relative frequency over time,&lt;ref name=SEPIP /&gt; (3.4) i.e., its relative frequency of occurrence after repeating a process a large number of times under similar conditions. This is also known as [[aleatory]] probability.  The events are assumed to be governed by some [[randomness|random]] physical phenomena, which are either phenomena that are predictable, in principle, with sufficient information (see [[determinism]]); or phenomena which are essentially unpredictable. Examples of the first kind include tossing [[dice]] or spinning a [[roulette]] wheel; an example of the second kind is [[radioactive decay]]. In the case of tossing a fair coin, frequentists say that the probability of getting a heads is 1/2, not because there are two equally likely outcomes but because repeated series of large numbers of trials demonstrate that the empirical frequency converges to the limit 1/2 as the number of trials goes to infinity.

If we denote by &lt;math&gt;\textstyle n_a&lt;/math&gt; the number of occurrences of an event &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; \textstyle n&lt;/math&gt; trials, then if &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to +\infty}{n_a \over n}=p &lt;/math&gt;  we say that ''&lt;math&gt;\textstyle P(\mathcal{A})=p&lt;/math&gt;.

The frequentist view has its own problems. It is of course impossible to actually perform an infinity of repetitions of a random experiment to determine the probability of an event. But if only a finite number of repetitions of the process are performed, different relative frequencies will appear in different series of trials. If these relative frequencies are to define the probability, the probability will be slightly different every time it is measured. But the real probability should be the same every time. If we acknowledge the fact that we only can measure a probability with some error of measurement attached, we still get into problems as the error of measurement can only be expressed as a probability, the very concept we are trying to define. This renders even the frequency definition circular; see for example “[https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/Preprints/611.pdf What is the Chance of an Earthquake?]” &lt;ref&gt;Freedman, David and Philip B. Stark (2003)"What is the Chance of an Earthquake?" Earthquake Science and Seismic Risk.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subjectivism==
[[Image:Tokyo Racecourse 3.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Gambling]] odds reflect the average bettor's 'degree of belief' in the outcome.]]
{{Main|Bayesian probability}}
Subjectivists, also known as '''Bayesians''' or followers of '''epistemic probability''', give the notion of probability a subjective status by regarding it as a measure of the 'degree of belief' of the individual assessing the uncertainty of a particular situation. [[Epistemic]] or subjective probability is sometimes called '''[[Credence (statistics)|credence]]''', as opposed to the term '''chance''' for a propensity probability.

Some examples of epistemic probability are to assign a probability to the proposition that a proposed law of physics is true, and to determine how probable it is that a suspect committed a crime, based on the evidence presented.

Gambling odds don't reflect the bookies' belief in a likely winner, so much as the other bettors' belief, because the bettors are actually betting against one another.  The odds are set based on how many people have bet on a possible winner, so that even if the high odds players always win, the bookies will always make their percentages anyway.

The use of Bayesian probability raises the philosophical debate as to whether it can contribute valid [[theory of justification|justifications]] of [[belief]].

Bayesians point to the work of [[Frank P. Ramsey|Ramsey]]&lt;ref name=ramsey /&gt; (p 182) and [[Bruno de Finetti|de Finetti]]&lt;ref name=deF /&gt; (p 103) as proving that subjective beliefs must follow the [[laws of probability]] if they are to be [[Coherence (physics)|coherent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jaynes | first = E. T. | title = Probability theory the logic of science | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK New York, NY | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0521592710 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Evidence casts doubt that humans will have coherent beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kahneman | first = Daniel | title = Thinking, fast and slow | publisher = Farrar, Straus and Giroux | location = New York | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-0374275631 }}  The book contains numerous examples of the difference between idealized and actual thought.  "[W]hen called upon to judge probability, people actually judge something else and believe they have judged probability." (p 98)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grove | first1 = William M. | last2 = Meehl | first2 = Paul E. | title = Comparative efficiency of informal (subjective, impressionistic) and formal (mechanical, algorithmic) prediction procedures: The clinical-statistical controversy | journal = Psychology, Public Policy, and Law | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 293–332 | year = 1996 | doi = 10.1037/1076-8971.2.2.293 | url = http://www.tc.umn.edu/~pemeehl/167GroveMeehlClinstix.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111030214359/http://www.tc.umn.edu/~pemeehl/167GroveMeehlClinstix.pdf | archivedate = 30 October 2011 | df = dmy-all | citeseerx = 10.1.1.471.592 }}  Statistical decisions are consistently superior to the subjective decisions of experts.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of Bayesian probability involves specifying a [[prior probability]]. This may be obtained from consideration of whether the required prior probability is greater or lesser than a reference probability{{Clarify|date=April 2010}} associated with an [[urn model]] or a [[thought experiment]].  The issue is that for a given problem, multiple thought experiments could apply, and choosing one is a matter of judgement: different people may assign different prior probabilities, known as the [[reference class problem]].
The "[[sunrise problem]]" provides an example.

==Propensity==
{{Main|Propensity probability}}

Propensity theorists think of probability as a physical propensity, or disposition, or tendency of a given type of physical situation to yield an outcome of a certain kind or to yield a long run relative frequency of such an outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Peterson | first = Martin | title = An introduction to decision theory | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK New York | year = 2009 | page = 140 | isbn = 978-0521716543 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of objective probability is sometimes called 'chance'.

Propensities, or chances, are not relative frequencies, but purported causes of the observed stable relative frequencies.  Propensities are invoked to explain why repeating a certain kind of experiment will generate given outcome types at persistent rates, which are known as propensities or chances. Frequentists are unable to take this approach, since relative frequencies do not exist for single tosses of a coin, but only for large ensembles or collectives (see "single case possible" in the table above).&lt;ref name="de Elía" /&gt; In contrast, a propensitist is able to use the [[law of large numbers]] to explain the behaviour of long-run frequencies.  This law, which is a consequence of the axioms of probability, says that if (for example) a coin is tossed repeatedly many times, in such a way that its probability of landing heads is the same on each toss, and the outcomes are probabilistically independent, then the relative frequency of heads will be close to the probability of heads on each single toss.  This law allows that stable long-run frequencies are a manifestation of invariant ''single-case'' probabilities. In addition to explaining the emergence of stable relative frequencies, the idea of propensity is motivated by the desire to make sense of single-case probability attributions in quantum mechanics, such as the probability of [[Radioactive decay|decay]] of a particular [[atom]] at a particular time.

The main challenge facing propensity theories is to say exactly what propensity means.  (And then, of course, to show that propensity thus defined has the required properties.)  At present, unfortunately, none of the well-recognised accounts of propensity comes close to meeting this challenge.

A propensity theory of probability was given by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]].&lt;ref name="Miller 1975 123–132"&gt;{{Cite journal| last= Miller|first=Richard W.| authorlink6=Richard W.

Peirce, however.&lt;ref name="Miller 1975 123–132"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haack 1977 63–104"/&gt; Popper noted that the outcome of a physical experiment is produced by a certain set of "generating conditions".  When we repeat an experiment, as the saying goes, we really perform another experiment with a (more or less) similar set of generating conditions.  To say that a set of generating conditions has propensity ''p'' of producing the outcome ''E'' means that those exact conditions, if repeated indefinitely, would produce an outcome sequence in which ''E'' occurred with limiting relative frequency ''p''.  For Popper then, a deterministic experiment would have propensity 0 or 1 for each outcome, since those generating conditions would have same outcome on each trial. In other words, non-trivial propensities (those that differ from 0 and 1) only exist for genuinely indeterministic experiments.

A number of other philosophers, including [[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]] and [[Donald A. Gillies]], have proposed propensity theories somewhat similar to Popper's.

Other propensity theorists (e.g. Ronald Giere&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Ronald N. Giere]] |title=Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics |chapter=Objective Single Case Probabilities and the Foundations of Statistics |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/bookseries/0049237X |chapter-url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049237X09703805 |volume=73 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |year=1973 |isbn=978-0-444-10491-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;) do not explicitly define propensities at all, but rather see propensity as defined by the theoretical role it plays in science.  They argued, for example, that physical magnitudes such as [[electrical charge]] cannot be explicitly defined either, in terms of more basic things, but only in terms of what they do (such as attracting and repelling other electrical charges).  In a similar way, propensity is whatever fills the various roles that physical probability plays in science.

What roles does physical probability play in science?  What are its properties?  One central property of chance is that, when known, it constrains rational belief to take the same numerical value.  David Lewis called this the ''Principal Principle'',&lt;ref name=SEPIP /&gt; (3.3 &amp; 3.5) a term that philosophers have mostly adopted. For example, suppose you are certain that a particular biased coin has propensity 0.32 to land heads every time it is tossed.  What is then the correct price for a gamble that pays $1 if the coin lands heads, and nothing otherwise?  According to the Principal Principle, the fair price is 32 cents.

==Logical, epistemic, and inductive probability==
{{Main|Probabilistic logic}}

It is widely recognized that the term "probability" is sometimes used in contexts where it has nothing to do with physical randomness.  Consider, for example, the claim that the extinction of the dinosaurs was '''probably''' caused by a large meteorite hitting the earth.  Statements such as "Hypothesis H is probably true" have been interpreted to mean that the (presently available) [[empirical evidence]] (E, say) supports H to a high degree.  This degree of support of H by E has been called the '''logical''' probability of H given E, or the '''epistemic probability''' of H given E, or the '''inductive probability''' of H given E.

The differences between these interpretations are rather small, and may seem inconsequential. One of the main points of disagreement lies in the relation between probability and belief.  Logical probabilities are conceived (for example in [[John Maynard Keynes|Keynes]]' [[A Treatise on Probability|Treatise on Probability]]&lt;ref name=keynes /&gt;) to be objective, logical relations between propositions (or sentences), and hence not to depend in any way upon belief.  They are degrees of (partial) [[entailment]], or degrees of [[logical consequence]], not degrees of [[belief]].  (They do, nevertheless, dictate proper degrees of belief, as is discussed below.)  [[Frank P. Ramsey]], on the other hand, was skeptical about the existence of such objective logical relations and argued that (evidential) probability is "the logic of partial belief".&lt;ref name=ramsey /&gt; (p 157)  In other words, Ramsey held that epistemic probabilities simply ''are'' degrees of rational belief, rather than being logical relations that merely ''constrain'' degrees of rational belief.

Another point of disagreement concerns the ''uniqueness'' of evidential probability, relative to a given state of knowledge.  [[Rudolf Carnap]] held, for example, that logical principles always determine a unique logical probability for any statement, relative to any body of evidence.  Ramsey, by contrast, thought that while degrees of belief are subject to some rational constraints (such as, but not limited to, the axioms of probability) these constraints usually do not determine a unique value.  Rational people, in other words, may differ somewhat in their degrees of belief, even if they all have the same information.

==Prediction==
{{Main|Predictive inference}}
An alternative account of probability emphasizes the role of ''prediction'' – predicting future observations on the basis of past observations, not on unobservable parameters. In its modern form, it is mainly in the Bayesian vein. This was the main function of probability before the 20th century,&lt;ref name="geisser"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=wfdlBZ_iwZoC Predictive Inference: An Introduction]'', [[Seymour Geisser]], [[CRC Press]], 1993 {{isbn|0-412-03471-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
but fell out of favor compared to the parametric approach, which modeled phenomena as a physical system that was observed with error, such as in [[celestial mechanics]].

The modern predictive approach was pioneered by [[Bruno de Finetti]], with the central idea of [[exchangeability]] – that future observations should behave like past observations.&lt;ref name="geisser" /&gt; This view came to the attention of the Anglophone world with the 1974 translation of de Finetti's book,&lt;ref name="geisser" /&gt; and has
since been propounded by such statisticians as [[Seymour Geisser]].

==Axiomatic probability==
The mathematics of probability can be developed on an entirely axiomatic basis that is independent of any interpretation: see the articles on [[probability theory]] and [[probability axioms]] for a detailed treatment.

[[File:Example of a set.svg|thumb|A set of polygons in an [[Euler diagram]]]]

In [[mathematics]], a '''set''' is a collection of distinct objects, considered as an [[object (mathematics)|object]] in its own right. For example, the numbers 2, 4, and 6 are distinct objects when considered separately, but when they are considered collectively they form a single set of size three, written {2,4,6}. The concept of a set is one of the most fundamental in mathematics. Developed at the end of the 19th century, [[set theory]] is now a ubiquitous part of mathematics, and can be used as a foundation from which nearly all of mathematics can be derived. In [[mathematics education]], elementary topics from set theory such as [[Venn diagram]]s are taught at a young age, while more advanced concepts are taught as part of a university degree.

The German word ''Menge'', rendered as "set" in English, was coined by [[Bernard Bolzano]] in his work ''[[The Paradoxes of the Infinite]]''.

==Definition==
[[File:Passage with the set definition of Georg Cantor.png|thumb|Passage with a translation of the original set definition of Georg Cantor. The German word ''Menge'' for ''set'' is translated with ''aggregate'' here.]]
A set is a well-defined collection of distinct objects. The objects that make up a set (also known as the set's ''[[element (mathematics)|element]]s'' or ''members'') can be anything: numbers, people, letters of the alphabet, other sets, and so on. [[Georg Cantor]], one of the founders of set theory, gave the following definition of a set at the beginning of his ''[http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/index.php?id=pdf&amp;no_cache=1&amp;IDDOC=36218 Beiträge zur Begründung der transfiniten Mengenlehre]'':&lt;ref&gt;"Eine Menge, ist die Zusammenfassung bestimmter, wohlunterschiedener Objekte unserer Anschauung oder unseres Denkens – welche Elemente der Menge genannt werden – zu einem Ganzen." {{cite web |url=http://www.brinkmann-du.de/mathe/fos/fos01_03.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610133240/http://brinkmann-du.de/mathe/fos/fos01_03.htm |archivedate=2011-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|A set is a gathering together into a whole of definite, distinct objects of our perception [Anschauung] or of our thought—which are called elements of the set.}}

Sets are conventionally denoted with [[capital letters]]. Sets ''A'' and ''B'' are equal [[if and only if]] they have precisely the same elements.&lt;ref name="Stoll"&gt;
{{Cite book  | last = Stoll  | first = Robert  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = Sets, Logic and Axiomatic Theories  | publisher = W. H. Freeman and Company  | series =   | volume =   | edition =   | date =   | location =   | pages = 5  | language =   | url =   | doi =   | id =   | isbn =  | mr =   | zbl =   | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For technical reasons, Cantor's definition turned out to be inadequate; today, in contexts where more rigor is required, one can use [[axiomatic set theory]], in which the notion of a "set" is taken as a [[primitive notion]] and the properties of sets are defined by a collection of [[axiom]]s. The most basic properties are that a set can have elements, and that two sets are equal (one and the same) if and only if every element of each set is an element of the other; this property is called the ''extensionality of sets''.

==Describing sets==
{{Main article|Set notation}}
There are two ways of describing, or specifying the members of, a set. One way is by [[intensional definition]], using a rule or semantic description:

:''A'' is the set whose members are the first four positive [[integer]]s.
:''B'' is the set of colors of the [[Flag of France|French flag]].

The second way is by [[extension (semantics)|extension]] – that is, listing each member of the set.  An [[Extensional and intensional definitions|extensional definition]] is denoted by enclosing the list of members in [[curly bracket]]s:

:''C'' = {4, 2, 1, 3}
:''D'' = {blue, white, red}.

One often has the choice of specifying a set either intensionally or extensionally.  In the examples above, for instance, ''A'' = ''C'' and ''B'' = ''D''.

In an extensional definition, a set member can be listed two or more times, for example, {11, 6, 6}.  However, per extensionality, two definitions of sets which differ only in that one of the definitions lists members multiple times define the same set.  Hence, the set {11, 6, 6} is identical to the set {11, 6}. Moreover, the order in which the elements of a set are listed is irrelevant (unlike for a [[sequence]] or [[tuple]]).  We can illustrate these two important points with an example:
:{6, 11} = {11, 6} = {11, 6, 6, 11} .

For sets with many elements, the enumeration of members can be abbreviated. For instance, the set of the first thousand positive integers may be specified extensionally as

:{1, 2, 3, ..., 1000},

where the [[Ellipsis#In mathematical notation|ellipsis]] ("...") indicates that the list continues in the obvious way.

The notation with braces may also be used in an intensional specification of a set.  In this usage, the braces have the meaning "the set of all ...". So, ''E'' = {playing card suits} is the set whose four members are {{nowrap|♠, ♦, ♥, and ♣.}}  A more general form of this is [[set-builder notation]], through which, for instance, the set ''F'' of the twenty smallest integers that are four less than [[square number|perfect square]] can be denoted

:''F'' = {''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 4 : ''n'' is an integer; and 0 ≤ ''n'' ≤ 19}.

In this notation, the [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] (":") means "such that", and the description can be interpreted as "''F'' is the set of all numbers of the form ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 4, such that ''n'' is a whole number in the range from 0 to 19 inclusive." Sometimes the [[vertical bar]] ("|") is used instead of the colon.

==Membership==
{{Main article|Element (mathematics)}}
If ''B'' is a set and ''x'' is one of the objects of ''B'', this is denoted ''x'' ∈ ''B'', and is read as "x belongs to B", or "x is an element of B". If ''y'' is not a member of ''B'' then this is written as ''y'' ∉ ''B'', and is read as "y does not belong to B".

For example, with respect to the sets ''A'' = {1,2,3,4}, ''B'' = {blue, white, red}, and ''F'' = {''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 4 : ''n'' is an integer; and 0 ≤ ''n'' ≤ 19} defined above,
:4 &amp;isin; ''A'' and 12 &amp;isin; ''F''; but
:9 &amp;notin; ''F'' and green &amp;notin; ''B''.

===Subsets===
{{Main article|Subset}}
If every member of set ''A'' is also a member of set ''B'', then ''A'' is said to be a ''subset'' of ''B'', written ''A'' ⊆ ''B'' (also pronounced ''A is contained in B''). Equivalently, we can write ''B'' ⊇ ''A'', read as ''B is a superset of A'', ''B includes A'', or ''B contains A''. The [[relation (mathematics)|relationship]] between sets established by ⊆ is called ''inclusion'' or ''containment''.

If ''A'' is a subset of, but not equal to, ''B'', then ''A'' is called a ''proper subset'' of ''B'', written ''A'' ⊊ ''B'' (''A is a proper subset of B'') or ''B'' ⊋ ''A'' (''B is a proper superset of A'').

The expressions ''A'' ⊂ ''B'' and ''B'' ⊃ ''A'' are used differently by different authors; some authors use them to mean the same as ''A'' ⊆ ''B'' (respectively ''B'' ⊇ ''A''), whereas others use them to mean the same as ''A'' ⊊ ''B'' (respectively ''B'' ⊋ ''A'').

[[File:Venn A subset B.svg|thumb|150px|{{center|''A'' is a '''subset''' of ''B''}}]]

Examples:
:* The set of all men is a proper [[subset]] of the set of all people.
:* {1, 3} &amp;sube; {1, 2, 3, 4}.
:* {1, 2, 3, 4} &amp;sube; {1, 2, 3, 4}.

The [[empty set]] is a subset of every set and every set is a subset of itself:
:* &amp;empty; &amp;sube; ''A''.
:* ''A'' &amp;sube; ''A''.

Every set is a subset of the [[universal set]]:
:* ''A'' &amp;sube; ''U''.

An obvious but useful identity, which can often be used to show that two seemingly different sets are equal:
:* {{nowrap|1=''A'' = ''B''}} if and only if {{nowrap|''A'' &amp;sube; ''B''}} and {{nowrap|''B'' &amp;sube; ''A''}}.

A [[partition of a set]] ''S'' is a set of nonempty subsets of ''S'' such that every element ''x'' in ''S'' is in exactly one of these subsets.

===Power sets===
{{Main article|Power set}}
The power set of a set ''S'' is the set of all subsets of ''S''. The power set contains ''S'' itself and the empty set because these are both subsets of ''S''. For example, the power set of the set {1, 2, 3} is {{1, 2, 3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1}, {2}, {3}, &amp;empty;}. The power set of a set ''S'' is usually written as ''P''(''S'').

The power set of a finite set with ''n'' elements has 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; elements. For example, the set {1, 2, 3} contains three elements, and the power set shown above contains 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 8 elements.

The power set of an infinite (either [[countable]] or [[uncountable]]) set is always uncountable. Moreover, the power set of a set is always strictly "bigger" than the original set in the sense that there is no way to pair every element of ''S'' with exactly one element of ''P''(''S''). (There is never an onto map or [[surjection]] from ''S'' onto ''P''(''S'').)

Every partition of a set ''S'' is a subset of the powerset of ''S''.

==Cardinality==
{{Main article|Cardinality}}

The cardinality |&amp;thinsp;''S''&amp;thinsp;| of a set ''S'' is "the number of members of ''S''." For example, if  {{nowrap|1=''B'' = {''blue, white, red''} }}, then {{nowrap|1={{!}}&amp;thinsp;''B''&amp;thinsp;{{!}} = 3.}}

There is a unique set with no members, called the ''[[empty set]]'' (or the ''null set''), which is denoted by the symbol ∅ (other notations are used; see [[empty set]]).  The cardinality of the empty set is zero. For example, the set of all three-sided squares has zero members and thus is the empty set. Though it may seem trivial, the empty set, like the [[0 (number)|number zero]], is important in mathematics. Indeed, the existence of this set is one of the fundamental concepts of [[axiomatic set theory]].

Some sets have [[Infinite set|infinite]] cardinality.  The set '''N''' of [[natural number]]s, for instance, is infinite. Some infinite cardinalities are greater than others.  For instance, the set of [[real number]]s has greater cardinality than the set of natural numbers. However, it can be shown that the cardinality of (which is to say, the number of points on) a [[straight line]] is the same as the cardinality of any [[line segment|segment]] of that line, of the entire [[plane (mathematics)|plane]], and indeed of any [[dimension (mathematics)|finite-dimensional]] [[Euclidean space]].

==Special sets==
There are some sets or kinds of sets that hold great mathematical importance and are referred to with such regularity that they have acquired special names and notational conventions to identify them. One of these is the [[empty set]], denoted {} or ∅. A set with exactly one element, x, is a [[unit set]], or singleton, {x}.&lt;ref name="Stoll"/&gt;

Many of these sets are represented using [[blackboard bold]] or bold typeface. Special sets of numbers include
* '''P''' or ℙ, denoting the set of all [[prime number|primes]]: '''P''' = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, ...}.
* '''N''' or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, denoting the set of all [[natural number]]s: '''N''' = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...} (sometimes defined excluding 0).
* '''Z''' or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, denoting the set of all [[integer]]s (whether positive, negative or zero): '''Z''' = {..., −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, ...}.
* '''Q''' or ℚ, denoting the set of all [[rational number]]s (that is, the set of all [[proper fraction|proper]] and [[improper fraction]]s): '''Q''' = {''a''/''b'' : ''a'', ''b'' ∈ '''Z''', ''b'' ≠ 0}. For example, 1/4 ∈ '''Q''' and 11/6 ∈ '''Q'''. All integers are in this set since every integer ''a'' can be expressed as the fraction ''a''/1 ('''Z''' ⊊ '''Q''').
* '''R''' or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, denoting the set of all [[real number]]s. This set includes all rational numbers, together with all [[irrational number|irrational]] numbers (that is, [[algebraic number]]s that cannot be rewritten as fractions such as {{radic|2}}, as well as [[transcendental numbers]] such as [[Pi|&amp;pi;]], [[e (mathematical constant)|''e'']]).
* '''C''' or ℂ, denoting the set of all [[complex number]]s: '''C''' = {''a'' + ''bi'' : ''a'', ''b'' ∈ '''R'''}. For example, 1 + 2''i'' ∈ '''C'''.
* '''H''' or ℍ, denoting the set of all [[quaternion]]s: '''H''' = {''a'' + ''bi'' + ''cj'' + ''dk'' : ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' ∈ '''R'''}. For example, 1 + ''i'' + 2''j'' − ''k'' ∈ '''H'''.

Positive and negative sets are denoted by a superscript - or +. For example, ℚ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; represents the set of positive rational numbers.

Each of the above sets of numbers has an infinite number of elements, and each can be considered to be a proper subset of the sets listed below it. The primes are used less frequently than the others outside of [[number theory]] and related fields.

==Basic operations==
There are several fundamental operations for constructing new sets from given sets.

===Unions===
[[File:Venn0111.svg|thumb|&lt;div class="center"&gt;The '''union''' of ''A'' and ''B'', denoted {{nowrap|''A'' ∪ ''B''}}&lt;/div&gt;]]
{{Main article|Union (set theory)}}
Two sets can be "added" together. The ''union'' of ''A'' and ''B'', denoted by ''A''&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;''B'', is the set of all things that are members of either ''A'' or ''B''.

Examples:
:* {{nowrap|1={1, 2} ∪ {1, 2} = {1, 2}. }}
:* {{nowrap|1={1, 2} ∪ {2, 3} = {1, 2, 3}. }}
:* {1, 2, 3} ∪ {3, 4, 5} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

'''Some basic properties of unions:'''
:* {{nowrap|1=''A'' ∪ ''B'' = ''B'' ∪ ''A''.}}
:* {{nowrap|1=''A'' ∪ (''B'' ∪ ''C'') = (''A'' ∪ ''B'') ∪ ''C''.}}
:* {{nowrap|1=''A'' &amp;sube; (''A'' ∪ ''B'').}}
:* {{nowrap|1=''A'' ∪ ''A'' = ''A''.}}
:* {{nowrap|1=''A'' ∪ ''U'' = ''U''.}}
:* {{nowrap|1=''A'' ∪ &amp;empty; = ''A''.}}
:* {{nowrap|''A'' &amp;sube; ''B''}} [[if and only if]] {{nowrap|1=''A'' ∪ ''B'' = ''B''.}}

===Intersections===
{{Main article|Intersection (set theory)}}
A new set can also be constructed by determining which members two sets have "in common". The ''intersection'' of ''A'' and ''B'', denoted by {{nowrap|''A'' ∩ ''B'',}} is the set of all things that are members of both ''A'' and ''B''. If {{nowrap|1=''A'' ∩ ''B'' = ∅,}} then ''A'' and ''B'' are said to be ''disjoint''.
[[File:Venn0001.svg|thumb|&lt;div class="center"&gt;The '''intersection''' of ''A'' and ''B'', denoted {{nowrap|''A'' ∩ ''B''.}}&lt;/div&gt;]]

Examples:
:* {{nowrap|1={1, 2} ∩ {1, 2} = {1, 2}.}}
:* {{nowrap|1={1, 2} ∩ {2, 3} = {2}.}}

'''Some basic properties of intersections:'''
:* {{nowrap|1=''A'' ∩ ''B'' = ''B'' ∩ ''A''.}}
:* {{nowrap|1=''A'' ∩ (''B'' ∩ ''C'') = (''A'' ∩ ''B'') ∩ ''C''.}}
:* {{nowrap|''A'' ∩ ''B'' &amp;sube; ''A''.}}
:* {{nowrap|1=''A'' ∩ ''A'' = ''A''.}}
:* {{nowrap|1=''A'' ∩ ''U'' = ''A''.}}
:* {{nowrap|1=''A'' ∩ &amp;empty; = &amp;empty;.}}
:* {{nowrap|''A'' &amp;sube; ''B''}} [[if and only if]] {{nowrap|    1=''A'' ∩ ''B'' = ''A''.}}

===Complements===
[[File:Venn0100.svg|thumb|&lt;div class="center"&gt;The '''relative complement'''&lt;br/&gt;of ''B'' in ''A''&lt;/div&gt;]]
[[File:Venn1010.svg|thumb|&lt;div class="center"&gt;The '''complement''' of ''A'' in ''U''&lt;/div&gt;]]
[[File:Venn0110.svg|thumb|&lt;div class="center"&gt;The '''symmetric difference''' of ''A'' and ''B''&lt;/div&gt;]]
{{Main article|Complement (set theory)}}
Two sets can also be "subtracted". The ''relative complement'' of ''B'' in ''A'' (also called the ''set-theoretic difference'' of ''A'' and ''B''), denoted by {{nowrap|''A'' \ ''B''}} (or {{nowrap|''A'' − ''B''}}), is the set of all elements that are members of ''A'' but not members of ''B''. Note that it is valid to "subtract" members of a set that are not in the set, such as removing the element ''green'' from the set {{nowrap|{1, 2, 3};}} doing so has no effect.

In certain settings all sets under discussion are considered to be subsets of a given [[universe (mathematics)|universal set]] ''U''. In such cases, {{nowrap|''U'' \ ''A''}} is called the ''absolute complement'' or simply ''complement'' of ''A'', and is denoted by ''A''&amp;prime;.
:* {{nowrap|1=''A''&amp;prime; = ''U'' \ ''A''}}

Examples:
:* {{nowrap|1={1, 2} \ {1, 2} = &amp;empty;.}}
:* {{nowrap|1={1, 2, 3, 4} \ {1, 3} = {2, 4}.}}
:* If ''U'' is the set of integers, ''E'' is the set of even integers, and ''O'' is the set of odd integers, then ''U'' \ ''E'' = ''E''&amp;prime; = ''O''.

Some basic properties of complements:
:* {{nowrap|1=''A'' \ ''B'' ≠ ''B'' \ ''A''}} for {{nowrap|1=''A'' ≠ ''B''}}.
:* {{nowrap|1=''A'' ∪ ''A''&amp;prime; = ''U''.}}
:* {{nowrap|1=''A'' ∩ ''A''&amp;prime; = &amp;empty;.}}
:* {{nowrap|1=(''A''&amp;prime;)&amp;prime; = ''A''.}}
:* {{nowrap|1=&amp;empty; \ ''A'' = &amp;empty;.}}
:* {{nowrap|1=''A'' \ &amp;empty; = ''A''.}}
:* {{nowrap|1=''A'' \ ''A'' = &amp;empty;.}}
:* {{nowrap|1=''A'' \ ''U'' = &amp;empty;.}}
:* {{nowrap|1=''A'' \ ''A''&amp;prime; = ''A''}} and {{nowrap|1=''A''&amp;prime; \ ''A'' = ''A''&amp;prime;.}}
:* {{nowrap|1=''U''&amp;prime; = &amp;empty;}} and {{nowrap|1=&amp;empty;&amp;prime; = ''U''.}}
:* {{nowrap|1=''A'' \ ''B'' = ''A'' ∩ ''B''&amp;prime;}}.
:* if {{nowrap|''A'' &amp;sube; ''B''}} then {{nowrap|1=''A'' \ ''B'' = &amp;empty;.}}

An extension of the complement is the [[symmetric difference]], defined for sets ''A'', ''B'' as
:&lt;math&gt;A\,\Delta\,B = (A \setminus B) \cup (B \setminus A).&lt;/math&gt;
For example, the symmetric difference of {7,8,9,10} and {9,10,11,12} is the set {7,8,11,12}. The power set of any set becomes a [[Boolean ring]] with symmetric difference as the addition of the ring (with the empty set as neutral element) and intersection as the multiplication of the ring.

===Cartesian product===
{{Main article|Cartesian product}}
A new set can be constructed by associating every element of one set with every element of another set.  The ''Cartesian product'' of two sets ''A'' and ''B'', denoted by ''A'' × ''B'' is the set of all [[ordered pairs]] (''a'', ''b'') such that ''a'' is a member of ''A'' and ''b'' is a member of ''B''.

Examples:
* {{nowrap|1={1, 2} × {red, white, green} = {(1, red), (1, white), (1, green), (2, red), (2, white), (2, green)}.}}
* {{nowrap|1={1, 2} × {1, 2} = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)}.}}
* {{nowrap|1={a, b, c} × {d, e, f} = {(a, d), (a, e), (a, f), (b, d), (b, e), (b, f), (c, d), (c, e), (c, f)}.}}

Some basic properties of Cartesian products:
* {{nowrap|1=''A'' × [[∅]] = ∅.}}
* {{nowrap|1=''A'' × (''B'' ∪ ''C'') = (''A'' × ''B'') ∪ (''A'' × ''C'').}}
* {{nowrap|1=(''A'' ∪ ''B'') × ''C'' = (''A'' × ''C'') ∪ (''B'' × ''C'').}}
Let ''A'' and ''B'' be finite sets; then the [[Set (mathematics)#Cardinality|cardinality]] of the Cartesian product is the product of the cardinalities:
* |&amp;thinsp;''A'' × ''B''&amp;thinsp;| = |&amp;thinsp;''B'' × ''A''&amp;thinsp;| = |&amp;thinsp;''A''&amp;thinsp;| × |&amp;thinsp;''B''&amp;thinsp;|.

==Applications==
Set theory is seen as the foundation from which virtually all of mathematics can be derived. For example, [[Algebraic structure|structures]] in [[abstract algebra]], such as [[Group (mathematics)|groups]], [[Field (mathematics)|fields]] and [[Ring (mathematics)|rings]], are sets [[Closure (mathematics)|closed]] under one or more operations.

One of the main applications of naive set theory is constructing [[Relation (mathematics)|relations]].  A relation from a [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] ''A'' to a [[codomain]] ''B'' is a subset of the Cartesian product ''A'' × ''B''.  Given this concept, we are quick to see that the set ''F'' of all ordered pairs (''x'', ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), where ''x'' is real, is quite familiar.  It has a domain set '''R''' and a codomain set that is also '''R''', because the set of all squares is subset of the set of all real numbers.  If placed in functional notation, this relation becomes ''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  The reason these two are equivalent is for any given value, ''y'' that the function is defined for, its corresponding ordered pair, (''y'', ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is a member of the set ''F''.
&lt;!-- Expand --&gt;

==Axiomatic set theory==
{{Main article|Axiomatic set theory}}
Although initially [[naive set theory]], which defines a set merely as ''any [[well-defined]]'' collection, was well accepted, it soon ran into several obstacles. It was found that this definition spawned [[:Category:Paradoxes of naive set theory|several paradoxes]], most notably:
*[[Russell's paradox]]—It shows that the "set of all sets that ''do not contain themselves''," i.e. the "set" { ''x'' : ''x'' is a set and ''x'' ∉ ''x'' } does not exist.
*[[Cantor's paradox]]—It shows that "the set of all sets" cannot exist.

The reason is that the phrase ''well-defined'' is not very well-defined. It was important to free set theory of these paradoxes because nearly all of mathematics was being redefined in terms of set theory. In an attempt to avoid these paradoxes, set theory was axiomatized based on [[first-order logic]], and thus '''[[axiomatic set theory]]''' was born.

For most purposes, however, [[naive set theory]] is still useful.

==Principle of inclusion and exclusion==
{{Main|Inclusion–exclusion principle}}
[[Image:A union B.svg|thumb|The inclusion-exclusion principle can be used to calculate the size of the union of sets: the size of the union is the size of the two sets, minus the size of their intersection.]]

The inclusion–exclusion principle is a counting technique that can be used to count the number of elements in a union of two sets, if the size of each set and the size of their intersection are known. It can be expressed symbolically as
:&lt;math&gt; |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|.&lt;/math&gt;

A more general form of the principle can be used to find the cardinality of any finite union of sets:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left|A_{1}\cup A_{2}\cup A_{3}\cup\ldots\cup A_{n}\right|=&amp; \left(\left|A_{1}\right|+\left|A_{2}\right|+\left|A_{3}\right|+\ldots\left|A_{n}\right|\right) \\
&amp;{} - \left(\left|A_{1}\cap A_{2}\right|+\left|A_{1}\cap A_{3}\right|+\ldots\left|A_{n-1}\cap A_{n}\right|\right) \\
&amp;{} + \ldots \\
&amp;{} + \left(-1\right)^{n-1}\left(\left|A_{1}\cap A_{2}\cap A_{3}\cap\ldots\cap A_{n}\right|\right).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

== De Morgan's laws ==
[[Augustus De Morgan]] stated [[De Morgan's laws|two laws]] about sets.

If A and B are any two sets then,

* '''(A ∪ B)′ = A′ ∩ B′'''
The complement of A union B equals the complement of A intersected with the complement of B.

* '''(A ∩ B)′ = A′ ∪ B′'''
The complement of A intersected with B is equal to the complement of A union to the complement of B.

{{SikhBeliefs}}
'''Simran''' ({{lang-pa|ਸਿਮਰਨ}}, {{lang-hi|सिमरण, सिमरन }}) is a Punjabi word derived from the [[Sanskrit]] word {{lang|sa|स्मरण}} (''smaraṇa'', "the act of remembrance, reminiscence, and recollection") which leads to the realization of what may be the highest aspect and purpose in one's life. It is the continuous remembrance of the finest aspect of the self, and/or the continuous remembrance (or feeling) of God, thus used for introducing [[spirituality]]. This state is maintained continuously while carrying out the worldly works outside.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oshoworld.com/discourses/audio_hindi.asp?album_id=36 Ek Omkaar Satnam Audio Discourse]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gurmukhi ==

''Simran'' is a commonly used term as a verb in [[Gurmukhi]], which refers to 'meditating' of the [[Nām]], the ultimate feeling of Ultimate. Sikhism is a distinct contemporary faith, whereby the Realization of God can be realized purely through individual devotion, without subjection to rites and rituals that have recently become the business of avaricious priests and that would impede the pure search for truth in Sikhism.

It says in the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] that through Simran one is purified and attains [[salvation]] or '[[Moksha|mukti]]'. This is because 'si-mar' means 'to die over', thus indicating to death of ego, allowing truth [[two truths|ultimate truth]] or [[Sat (Sanskrit)|sat]] to appear.

On page 202 of the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], [[Guru]]ji writes:

{{Quote|Meditating, meditating in remembrance, I have found peace.&lt;br&gt;(simar simar sukh paa-i-aa.) }}

This hymn teaches a person who wishes to gain from this human life, one must attain a higher spiritual state by become free of attachment by realizing that all that is, is empty. Thereby, merit is acquired by devoutly repeating, comprehending and living by the sacred word every day so as to progressively reveal the divine and [[two truths|ultimate truth]] to the person who earnestly seeks it:

[[Guru Ram Das]] says in ''Sarang ki var'' ([[Guru Granth Sahib]], 1242):

{{Quote|[[Nām]], the incorruptible is beyond our comprehending.

At the same time, it is our constant companion and preserves all creation. Therefore, truth will disclose itself unto us and lets us perceive it in our hearts. It is through earnestness that we can meet with such a truth.|}}

== Sant Mat ==

In [[Sant Mat]] the word Simran is used for the spiritual practice of repeating the [[mantra]] given by the [[Satguru]] during [[initiation]]. The mantra itself is also called Simran. Simran repetition is done during [[meditation]] and also outside it,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kirpalsingh-teachings.org/index.php/en/books-sant-kirpal-singh/jap-ji-the-message-of-guru-nanak/602-simran-what-it-means-and-its-uses.html Simran What it means and its uses], by [[Kirpal Singh]].&lt;/ref&gt; however this mantra is later dropped in favor of real feeling of self or the God, which happens due to breaking out of monotony through Jap. Thus mantra is used only till the point, monotony and previously formed patterns are broken. After it pure Simran is carried by the sadhak.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13131">A '''solar bus''' or '''solar-charged bus''' is a [[bus]] which is powered exclusively or mainly by [[solar energy]].  A solar-powered bus service is referred to as a '''solar bus service'''.  The use of the term "solar bus" normally implies that solar energy is used not only for powering electric equipment on the bus, but also for the [[propulsion]] of the vehicle.

Existing solar buses are [[battery electric bus]]es or (in the case of hybrid solar buses) [[hybrid bus]]es equipped with [[Electric-vehicle battery|batteries]] which are recharged from solar (or other) power sources; a launch of a solar bus service often goes hand in hand with investments for large-scale installations of stationary [[solar panel]]s with [[photovoltaic cell]]s.  Similarly as other [[solar vehicle]]s, many solar buses have photovoltaic cells contained in [[solar panel]]s on the vehicle's roof which convert the [[sun]]'s energy directly into [[electric energy]] to be used by the engine.

The introduction of solar buses and other [[green vehicle]]s for purposes of [[public transport]] forms a part of [[sustainable transport]] schemes.

== About ==

=== Solar-only and solar-electric bus services ===
The distinction between a solar-only electric bus and an electro-solar bus is fluid, as the distinction depends on the actual usage: whether the bus is recharged from solar or other power sources.

Solar-only bus services involve recharging the bus from solar energy, usually from solar panel-covered [[bus station]] [[Canopy (building)|canopies]].  The concept is similar to that of [[solar parking plot]] for cars and bicycles, where vehicles can re-charge while parked.  The need for recharging poses constraints on the run and standstill times of the bus.  The implementation of a solar bus service benefits from an optimization of over-all requirements for the specific bus service.&lt;ref name="ait-2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ait.ac.at/fileadmin/cmc/downloads/Magazine/Neu/Tomorrow_Today_Dezember_2011_en.pdf |pages=22–25 |title=The right drive for e-mobility |publisher= |date=December 2011 |accessdate=2013-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electro-solar buses are powered additionally from electric power [[Electric power transmission|transmitted]] from power plants; hybrid solar buses may be equipped with [[hybrid engine]]s.

=== Commercially available shuttle buses ===
Open air low-speed electric shuttle sightseeing buses equipped with a solar panel-covered roof are produced in series and are commercially available.  According to the producers, the solar panels save energy and prolong the battery life cycle.

== Use ==

=== Australia ===
The '''Tindo''' solar battery-charged bus ("Tindo", [[Kaurna language|Kaurna]] word for ''sun'') is an experimental [[battery electric vehicle]] that operates in [[Adelaide|Adelaide, Australia]]. It is the world's first solar bus, operating since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnn.com/green-tech/transportation/photos/7-modern-solar-powered-vehicles/tindo-solar-bus |title=7 modern solar-powered vehicles: Tindo Solar Bus &amp;#124; MNN - Mother Nature Network |publisher=MNN |date= |accessdate=2013-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses 100% solar power, is equipped with a [[Regenerative brake|regenerative braking system]] and air conditioning and can carry up to 40 persons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Kien |last1=To |first2=John E. |last2=Fernández |title=Alternative urban technologies demonstration projects for innovative cities |work=Third International Engineering Systems Symposium, CESUN 2012, Delft University of Technology |date=18–20 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 25 of whom are seated.  The bus itself is not equipped with solar panels.  It receives electric power from a [[photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] system on Adelaide's central [[bus station]].  Hailed as the world's first bus service powered exclusively by solar power, the bus service connects Adelaide City and North Adelaide as part of Adelaide City's sustainable transport agenda.  The Tindo is part of the 98A and 98C bus service (until recently known as the Adelaide Connector) which is offered as [[free public transport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecogeek.org/content/view/1245/ |title=All-Electric, Solar-Powered, Free Bus!!! |publisher=Ecogeek.org |date=2007-12-27 |accessdate=2013-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908184215/http://www.ecogeek.org/content/view/1245/ |archivedate=2009-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yoursay.adelaidecitycouncil.com/city-connector-bus |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222075212/http://yoursay.adelaidecitycouncil.com/city-connector-bus |archivedate=2015-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
Within the Chinese government's program for clean transport sector, [[China]]'s first solar hybrid buses were put in operation in July 2012 in the city of [[Qiqihar]]. Its engine is powered by [[lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion batteries]] which are fed by solar panels installed on the bus roof. It is claimed that each bus consumes 0.6 to 0.7 kilowatt-hours of electricity per kilometer and can transport up to 100 persons, and that the use of solar panels prolongs the batteries' lifetime by 35 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://naftcenews.wvu.edu/naftc_enews/2012/9/7/china-reveals-new-solar-buses |title=China Reveals New Solar Buses |publisher=[[West Virginia University]] |date=2012-09-07 |accessdate=2013-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009112858/http://naftcenews.wvu.edu/naftc_enews/2012/9/7/china-reveals-new-solar-buses |archivedate=2015-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
Austria's first solar-powered bus was put in operation in the village of [[Perchtoldsdorf]]. Its [[powertrain]], operating strategy, and [[design specification]] were specifically optimized in view of its planned regular service routes.  It has been in trial operation since autumn 2011.&lt;ref name="ait-2013"/&gt;

The [[Hybrid electric bus#Tribrid Bus|tribrid bus]] is a [[hybrid electric bus]] developed by the [[University of Glamorgan]], [[Wales]], for use as student transport between the University’s different campuses.  It is powered by [[hydrogen fuel]] or [[solar cell]]s, batteries and [[ultracapacitor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Green 'tribrid' minibus unveiled|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/7436908.stm |work=BBC |date=2008-06-05 |accessdate=2013-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Launch of Europe's First Tribrid Green Minibus |url=http://news.glam.ac.uk/news/en/2008/may/30/launch-europes-first-tibrid-green-minibus/ |work= |date=2008-05-30 |accessdate=2013-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UK ===

The first Solar Bus in the UK launched in [[Brighton]] April 2017. Following a marathon six week effort from hundreds of local people, [[The Big Lemon]] and [[Brighton Energy Coop]]'s joint Solar Bus project has won funding from the M&amp;S Community Energy Fund to cover the roof of [[The Big Lemon]]’s bus depot in solar panels to power the new electric buses on clean green renewable energy.  The bus was named by one of the Solar Roof partners, Viper IT Solutions and is called "Om Shanti".

The 120 solar panels will generate 30,000kW of electricity – the equivalent of 1.8 million boiled kettles. With no emissions, the Solar Buses will reduce noxious gases in some of Brighton and Hove’s most polluted areas and will power the 52 route between Woodingdean and [[Brighton]] on 100% renewable energy.

The Solar Bus project was one of 199 different applications to the scheme, 125 of which were shortlisted.  These were put to public vote for six weeks during September and October and the voting process also included the option to donate to the project via the Crowdfunding platform.

The Solar Bus project was one of 19 regional winners, with 1549 votes, 170 pledges, and a total of £13,325 raised through crowdfunding, almost half the total amount of £28,798 raised through the scheme nationally.  The project will benefit from £12,500 funding from M&amp;S Energy which, together with the £13,325 crowdfunding donations will fund the solar array on the roof of the bus depot.

===Uganda===
The Kayoola Solar Bus is a 35-seater electric solar bus with zero tailpipe emissions, a range of 80 km, with latent range extension from the real-time charging enabled by the roof mounted solar panels. The development of the Kayoola Solar Bus Concept represents the commitment of the Kiira Motors Project to championing the progressive development of local capacity for Vehicle Technology Innovation, a key ingredient for institutionalizing a sustainable Vehicle Manufacturing Industry in Uganda. &lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2016/02/15/africa/africa-solar-bus-kiira-uganda/index.html?iid=ob_lockedrail_topeditorial&amp;iref=obnetwork&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://kiiramotors.com/kayoola.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The Solar Buzz is a 14-seater US Electricar bus, made in 1994, that has been repurposed as the world's first truly solar bus in [[Truth or Consequences, New Mexico]] in 2011.  The Buzz has 2 KW in homemade solar panels on the roof, 40 golf cart batteries, 2 electric motors, and has no tailpipe.  The power required to go one mile is the same as the power required to make a pot of coffee:  around 700 Wh.  The Solar Buzz is an IntraCity bus approved by the state Public Regulation Commission (#56817) in 2015 and is a commercial daytime private shuttle service with a US$3 Fare, operated by Hot Springs Transit, LLC.  &lt;ref&gt;http://krqe.com/2016/01/28/new-mexico-woman-invents-states-first-solar-powered-bus/&lt;/ref&gt; Hot Springs Transit provides transit service to the 6100 person population of Truth or Consequences.

== Other forms of green bus transport ==

=== Non-solar powered engines ===
Solar panels are also used for powering electronic devices of the bus such as heating and air conditioning, even in buses with non-solar-powered engine. In the US, such buses are advertised to meet [[anti-idling]] regulations in several states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Bauer introduces solar bus powering system at BusCon |url=http://www.metro-magazine.com/news/story/2010/10/gary-bauer-introduces-solar-bus-powering-system-at-buscon.aspx |work=metro magazine |date=2010-10-06 |accessdate=2013-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Refitting existing non-existing vehicles with photovoltaic panels that feed the original battery with additional electric power has been shown to have the potential for making a substantial contribution to [[CO2 emission]] mitigation and to the [[pollution prevention|reduction of pollution]].&lt;ref name="Donno-2012"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Monica |last1=Donno |first2=Aleck |last2=Ferrari |first3=Annalisa |last3=Scarpelli |first4=Pietro |last4=Perlo |first5=Alberto |last5=Bocca |title=Mechatronic system for energy efficiency in bus transport |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6176493&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6176493 |work=Design, Automation &amp; Test in Europe Conference &amp; Exhibition, 2012 |pages=342–343 |date=12–16 March 2012 |accessdate=2013-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The thus transformed buses are however not solar buses in the strict sense of the word, as they do not use solar energy for propulsion.  The use of buses in public transport implies frequent stops with the opening and closing of doors, which influence the way the energy of the battery is used.&lt;ref name="Donno-2012"/&gt;

=== Renewable energy powered ===
In principle also [[trolleybus]]es or other non-autonomous electric buses or alternately powered buses such as [[fuel cell bus]]es or [[dual-mode bus]]es could be used for solar bus services, provided the origin of all or most of the energy used for propulsing the bus would be solar energy. In practice however such systems also draw on other sources of energy, at least also other [[renewable energy]] sources such as [[wind energy]]. An example is that the city of [[Hamburg]], Germany, received the 2011 [[European Green Capital Award]] for, among others, its fuel cell bus service that is claimed to be the world's largest hydrogen-powered bus fleet and is intended to use hydrogen generated from solar and wind energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/europeangreencapital/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Hamburg_DE_LowResolution_DE-new1.pdf |page=8 |title=Hamburg, Preisträger 2011,  |publisher=[[European Commission]] |date= |language=German |accessdate=2013-01-13}}, {{DOI|10.2779/78216}}, {{ISBN|978-92-79-21368-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematically, the Solow–Swan model is a [[nonlinear system]] consisting of a single [[ordinary differential equation]] that models the evolution of the ''[[per capita]]'' stock of capital. Due to its particularly attractive mathematical characteristics, Solow–Swan proved to be a convenient starting point for various extensions. For instance, in 1965, [[David Cass]] and [[Tjalling Koopmans]] integrated [[Frank P. Ramsey|Frank Ramsey's]] analysis of consumer optimization, thereby endogenizing the [[saving rate]], to create what is now known as the [[Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans model]].

== Background ==
The neo-classical model was an extension to the 1946 Harrod–Domar model that included a new term: productivity growth.  Important contributions to the model came from the work done by Solow and by Swan in 1956, who independently developed relatively simple growth models.&lt;ref name="Solow1956"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Solow | first1 = Robert M. | author-link1 = Robert Solow | title = A contribution to the theory of economic growth | journal = [[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] | volume = 70 | issue = 1 | pages = 65–94 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Oxford Journals]] | doi = 10.2307/1884513 | date = February 1956 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1884513 | jstor = 1884513 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/Solow1956.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Swan1956"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Swan |first=Trevor W. | author-link1 = Trevor Swan |date = November 1956 |title=Economic growth and capital accumulation |journal=Economic Record |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=334–361 | publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]] |doi= 10.1111/j.1475-4932.1956.tb00434.x |url= https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-4932.1956.tb00434.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Solow's model fitted available data on [[United States|US]] economic growth with some success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Solow | first1 = Robert M. | author-link1 = Robert Solow |year=1957 |month= |title=Technical change and the aggregate production function |journal=[[Review of Economics and Statistics]] |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=312–320 |doi=10.2307/1926047 | publisher= [[MIT Press|The MIT Press]] |url= https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1926047 |jstor= 1926047 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://faculty.georgetown.edu/mh5/class/econ489/Solow-Growth-Accounting.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 Solow was awarded the [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel|Nobel Prize in Economics]] for his work.

=== Extension to the Harrod–Domar model ===
Solow extended the Harrod–Domar model by adding labor as a [[factor of production]] and capital-output ratios that are not fixed as they are in the Harrod–Domar model. These refinements allow increasing [[capital intensity]] to be distinguished from technological progress. Solow sees the [[Leontief production function|fixed proportions production function]] as a "crucial assumption" to the instability results in the Harrod-Domar model. His own work expands upon this by exploring the implications of alternative specifications, namely the [[Cobb–Douglas production function|Cobb-Douglass]] and the more general [[Constant elasticity of substitution#CES production function|Constant Elasticity of Substitution]].&lt;ref name="Solow1956" /&gt; Although this has become the canonical and celebrated story&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blume|first=Lawrence E.|last2=Sargent|first2=Thomas J.|date=2015-03-01|title=Harrod 1939|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecoj.12224/abstract|journal=The Economic Journal|language=en|volume=125|issue=583|pages=350–377|doi=10.1111/ecoj.12224|issn=1468-0297}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the history of economics, featured in many economic textbooks,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Besomi|first=Daniele|date=2001|title=Harrod's dynamics and the theory of growth: the story of a mistaken attribution|jstor=23599721|journal=Cambridge Journal of Economics|volume=25|issue=1|pages=79–96|doi=10.2307/23599721}}&lt;/ref&gt; recent reappraisal of Harrod's work has contested it.

=== Long-run implications ===
The standard Solow model predicts that in the long run, economies converge to their [[Steady-state economy|steady state]] equilibrium and that permanent growth is achievable only through technological progress. Both shifts in saving and in populational growth cause only level effects in the long-run (i.e. in the absolute value of real income per capita).

An interesting implication of Solow's model is that poor countries should grow faster and eventually catch-up to richer countries. This [[Convergence (economics)|convergence]] could be explained by:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advanced Macroeconomics|last=Romer|first=David|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2006|isbn=9780072877304|location=|pages=31–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lags in the diffusion on knowledge. Differences in real income might shrink as poor countries receive better technology and information; 
* Efficient allocation of international capital flows, since the rate of return on capital should be higher in poorer countries. In practice, this is seldom observed and is known as [[Lucas paradox|Lucas' paradox]];
* A mathematical implication of the model (assuming poor countries have not yet reached their steady state). 
[[William Baumol|Baumol]] attempted to verify this empirically and found a very strong correlation between a countries' output growth over a long period of time (1870 to 1979) and its initial wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baumol|first=William J.|date=1986|title=Productivity Growth, Convergence, and Welfare: What the Long-Run Data Show|jstor=1816469|journal=The American Economic Review|volume=76|issue=5|pages=1072–1085|doi=10.2307/1816469}}&lt;/ref&gt; His findings were later contested by [[J. Bradford DeLong|DeLong]] who claimed that both the non-randomness of the sampled countries, and potential for significant measurement errors for estimates of real income per capita in 1870, biased Baumol's findings. DeLong concludes that there is little evidence to support the convergence theory.

=== Assumptions ===
The key assumption of the neoclassical growth model is that capital is subject to [[diminishing returns]] in a closed economy.

→Given a fixed stock of labor, the impact on output of the last unit of capital accumulated will always be less than the one before.

→Assuming for simplicity no technological progress or labor force growth, diminishing returns implies that at some point the amount of new capital produced is only just enough to make up for the amount of existing capital lost due to depreciation.{{ref|depreciation}} At this point, because of the assumptions of no technological progress or labor force growth, we can see the economy ceases to grow.

→Assuming non-zero rates of labor growth complicate matters somewhat, but the basic logic still applies{{ref|SteadStateWhen}} – in the short-run, the rate of growth slows as diminishing returns take effect and the economy converges to a constant "steady-state" rate of growth (that is, ''no'' economic growth per-capita).

→Including non-zero technological progress is very similar to the assumption of non-zero workforce growth, in terms of "effective labor": a new steady state is reached with constant output per ''worker-hour required for a unit of output''. However, in this case, per-capita output grows at the rate of technological progress in the "steady-state"{{ref|MacroEconomics248}} (that is, the rate of [[productivity]] growth).

=== Variations in the effects of productivity ===
In the Solow–Swan model the unexplained change in the growth of output after accounting for the effect of capital accumulation is called the [[Solow residual]].  This residual measures the exogenous increase in [[total factor productivity]] (TFP) during a particular time period.  The increase in TFP is often attributed entirely to technological progress, but it also includes any permanent improvement in the efficiency with which factors of production are combined over time. Implicitly TFP growth includes any permanent productivity improvements that result from improved management practices in the private or public sectors of the economy. Paradoxically, even though TFP growth is exogenous in the model, it cannot be observed, so it can only be estimated in conjunction with the simultaneous estimate of the effect of capital accumulation on growth during a particular time period.

The model can be reformulated in slightly different ways using different productivity assumptions, or different measurement metrics:
*{{Anchor|ALP}}Average Labor Productivity ('''ALP''') is economic output per labor hour.
*[[Multifactor productivity]] ('''MFP''') is output divided by a weighted average of capital and labor inputs. The weights used are usually based on the aggregate input shares either factor earns. This ratio is often quoted as: 33% return to capital and 67% return to labor (in Western nations).

In a growing economy, capital is accumulated faster than people are born, so the denominator in the growth function under the MFP calculation is growing faster than in the ALP calculation. Hence, MFP growth is almost always lower than ALP growth. (Therefore, measuring in ALP terms increases the apparent [[capital deepening]] effect.) MFP is measured by the "[[Solow residual]]", not ALP.

== Mathematics of the model ==
The [[textbook]] Solow–Swan model is set in [[Discrete time and continuous time|continuous-time]] world with no government or international trade. A single [[Good (economics)|good]] (output) is produced using two [[factors of production]], labor (&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;) and capital (&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;) in an [[aggregate production function]] that satisfies the [[Inada conditions]], which imply that the [[elasticity of substitution]] must be asymptotically equal to one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barelli |first=Paulo |last2=Pessôa |first2=Samuel de Abreu |title=Inada conditions imply that production function must be asymptotically Cobb–Douglas |journal=Economics Letters |volume=81 |issue=3 |year=2003 |pages=361–363 |doi=10.1016/S0165-1765(03)00218-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Litina |first=Anastasia |first2=Theodore |last2=Palivos |year=2008 |title=Do Inada conditions imply that production function must be asymptotically Cobb–Douglas? A comment |journal=[[Economics Letters]] |volume=99 |issue=3 |pages=498–499 |doi=10.1016/j.econlet.2007.09.035 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;Y(t)=K(t)^{\alpha}(A(t)L(t))^{1-\alpha}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; denotes time, &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; is the elasticity of output with respect to capital, and &lt;math&gt;Y(t)&lt;/math&gt; represents total production. &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; refers to labor-augmenting technology or “[[knowledge]]”, thus &lt;math&gt;AL&lt;/math&gt; represents effective labor. All factors of production are fully employed, and initial values &lt;math&gt;A(0)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;K(0)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;L(0)&lt;/math&gt; are given. The number of workers, i.e. labor, as well as the level of technology grow exogenously at rates &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, respectively:

:&lt;math&gt;L(t) = L(0)e^{nt}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A(t) = A(0)e^{gt}&lt;/math&gt;

The number of effective units of labor, &lt;math&gt;A(t)L(t)&lt;/math&gt;, therefore grows at rate &lt;math&gt;(n+g)&lt;/math&gt;. Meanwhile, the [[stock]] of capital [[Depreciation (economics)|depreciates]] over time at a constant rate &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;. However, only a fraction of the output (&lt;math&gt;cY(t)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;0&lt;c&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;) is [[Consumption (economics)|consumed]], leaving a saved share &lt;math&gt; s = 1-c &lt;/math&gt; for [[investment]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{K}(t) = s \cdot Y(t) - {\delta} \cdot K(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\dot{K}&lt;/math&gt; is shorthand for &lt;math&gt;\frac{dK(t)}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;, the derivative with respect to time. Derivative with respect to time means that it is the change in capital stock—output that is neither consumed nor used to replace worn-out old capital goods is net investment.

Since the production function &lt;math&gt;Y(K, AL)&lt;/math&gt; has constant [[returns to scale]], it can be written as output per effective unit of labour:&lt;ref group=note&gt;Step-by-step calculation: &lt;math&gt;y(t) = \frac{Y(t)}{A(t)L(t)} = \frac{K(t)^{\alpha}(A(t)L(t))^{1-\alpha}}{A(t)L(t)} = \frac{K(t)^{\alpha}}{(A(t)L(t))^{\alpha}} = k(t)^{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y(t) = \frac{Y(t)}{A(t)L(t)} = k(t)^{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

The main interest of the model is the dynamics of [[capital intensity]] &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, the capital stock per unit of effective labour. Its behaviour over time is given by the key equation of the Solow–Swan model:&lt;ref group=note&gt;Step-by-step calculation: &lt;math&gt;\dot{k}(t) = \frac{\dot{K}(t)}{A(t)L(t)} - \frac{K(t)}{[A(t)L(t)]^2}[A(t)\dot{L}(t)+L(t)\dot{A}(t)] = \frac{\dot{K}(t)}{A(t)L(t)} - \frac{K(t)}{A(t)L(t)} \frac{\dot{L}(t)}{L(t)} - \frac{K(t)}{A(t)L(t)} \frac{\dot{A}(t)}{A(t)}&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\dot{K}(t) = sY(t) - {\delta}K(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\frac{\dot{L}(t)}{L(t)}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\frac{\dot{A}(t)}{A(t)}&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, the equation simplifies to &lt;math&gt;\dot{k}(t) = s\frac{Y(t)}{A(t)L(t)} - \delta\frac{K(t)}{A(t)L(t)} - n\frac{K(t)}{A(t)L(t)} - g\frac{K(t)}{A(t)L(t)} = sy(t) - {\delta}k(t) - nk(t) - gk(t)&lt;/math&gt;. As mentioned above, &lt;math&gt;y(t) = k(t)^{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{k}(t) = sk(t)^{\alpha} - (n + g + \delta)k(t)&lt;/math&gt;

The first term, &lt;math&gt;sk(t)^{\alpha} = sy(t)&lt;/math&gt;, is the actual investment per unit of effective labour: the fraction &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; of the output per unit of effective labour &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt; that is saved and invested. The second term, &lt;math&gt;(n + g + \delta)k(t)&lt;/math&gt;, is the “break-even investment”: the amount of investment that must be invested to prevent &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; from falling.&lt;ref name="Romer2011"&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Romer |authorlink=David Romer |chapter=The Solow Growth Model |title=Advanced Macroeconomics |edition=Fourth |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2011 |pages=6–48 |isbn=978-0-07-351137-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16}} The equation implies that &lt;math&gt;k(t)&lt;/math&gt; converges to a steady-state value of &lt;math&gt;k^*&lt;/math&gt;, defined by &lt;math&gt;sk(t)^{\alpha} = (n + g + \delta)k(t)&lt;/math&gt;, at which there is neither an increase nor a decrease of capital intensity:

:&lt;math&gt;k^* = \left( \frac{s}{n + g + \delta} \right)^{\frac{1}{1-\alpha}} \,&lt;/math&gt;

at which the stock of capital &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; and effective labour &lt;math&gt;AL&lt;/math&gt; are growing at rate &lt;math&gt;(n + g)&lt;/math&gt;. By assumption of constant returns, output &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is also growing at that rate. In essence, the Solow–Swan model predicts that an economy will converge to a [[balanced-growth equilibrium]], regardless of its starting point. In this situation, the growth of output per worker is determined solely by the rate of [[technological progress]].&lt;ref name="Romer2011" /&gt;{{rp|18}}

Since, by definition, &lt;math&gt; \frac{K(t)}{Y(t)} = k(t)^{1-\alpha} &lt;/math&gt;, at the equilibrium &lt;math&gt;k^*&lt;/math&gt; we have
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{K(t)}{Y(t)} = \frac{s}{n + g + \delta} &lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, at the equilibrium, the capital/output ratio depends only on the saving, growth, and depreciation rates. This is the Solow–Swan model's version of the [[Golden rule savings rate|golden rule saving rate]].

Since &lt;math&gt; {\alpha}&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;, at any time &lt;math&gt; t&lt;/math&gt; the marginal product of capital &lt;math&gt;K(t)&lt;/math&gt; in the Solow–Swan model is inversely related to the capital/labor ratio.
:&lt;math&gt;MPK=\frac{\partial Y}{\partial K}= {\alpha}A^{1-\alpha}/(K/L)^{1-\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

If productivity &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; is the same across countries, then countries with less capital per worker &lt;math&gt;K/L&lt;/math&gt; have a higher marginal product, which would provide a higher return on capital investment.  As a consequence, the model predicts that in a world of open market economies and global financial capital, investment will flow from rich countries to poor countries, until capital/worker &lt;math&gt;K/L&lt;/math&gt; and income/worker &lt;math&gt;Y/L&lt;/math&gt; equalize across countries.

Since the marginal product of physical capital is not higher in poor countries than in rich countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1162/qjec.122.2.535| title = The Marginal Product of Capital| journal = The Quarterly Journal of Economics| volume = 122| issue = 2| pages = 535–68 | year = 2007| last1 = Caselli | first1 = F.| last2 = Feyrer | first2 = J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the implication is that productivity is lower in poor countries. The basic Solow model cannot explain why productivity is lower in these countries.  Lucas suggested that lower levels of human capital in poor countries could explain the lower productivity.&lt;ref name="Lucas1990"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lucas | first1 = Robert | author-link =Robert E. Lucas, Jr. | year=1990 |title= Why doesn't Capital Flow from Rich to Poor Countries? | journal = [[American Economic Review]] | volume = 80| pages = 92–96| issue = 2 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If one equates the [[marginal product of capital]] &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial Y}{\partial K}&lt;/math&gt; with the [[rate of profit|rate of return]] &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; (such approximation is often used in [[neoclassical economics]]), then, for our choice of the production function
:&lt;math&gt; \alpha = \frac{K\frac{\partial Y}{\partial K}}{Y} = \frac{rK}{Y} \, &lt;/math&gt;
so that &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of income appropriated by capital. Thus, Solow–Swan model assumes from the beginning that the labor-capital split of income remains constant.

== Mankiw–Romer–Weil version of model ==

=== Addition of human capital ===
[[N. Gregory Mankiw]], [[David Romer]], and [[David Weil]] created a [[human capital]] augmented version of the Solow–Swan model that can explain the failure of international investment to flow to poor countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mankiw | first1 = N. Gregory | last2 = Romer | first2 = David | last3 = Weil | first3 = David N. | date=May 1992 | title = A Contribution to the Empirics of Economic Growth | journal = The Quarterly Journal of Economics | volume = 107 | issue = 2 | pages = 407–437 | publisher =  | jstor = 2118477 | doi = 10.2307/2118477 | url =  | format =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this model output and the marginal product of capital (K) are lower in poor countries because they have less human capital than rich countries.

Similar to the textbook Solow–Swan model, the production function is of Cobb–Douglas type:
:&lt;math&gt;Y(t) = K(t)^{\alpha} H(t)^{\beta} (A(t)L(t))^{1 - \alpha - \beta}&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;H(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the stock of human capital, which depreciates at the same rate &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; as physical capital. For simplicity, they assume the same function of accumulation for both types of capital. Like in Solow–Swan, a fraction of the outcome, &lt;math&gt;sY(t)&lt;/math&gt;, is saved each period, but in this case split up and invested partly in physical and partly in human capital, such that &lt;math&gt;s = s_{K} + s_{H}&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, there are two fundamental dynamic equations in this model:
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{k} = s_{K}k^{\alpha}h^{\beta} - (n + g + \delta)k&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{h} = s_{H}k^{\alpha}h^{\beta} - (n + g + \delta)h&lt;/math&gt;
The balanced (or steady-state) equilibrium growth path is determined by &lt;math&gt;\dot{k} = \dot{h} = 0&lt;/math&gt;, which means &lt;math&gt;s_{K}k^{\alpha}h^{\beta} - (n + g + \delta)k = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s_{H}k^{\alpha}h^{\beta} - (n + g + \delta)h = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Solving for the steady-state level of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; yields:
:&lt;math&gt;k^* = \left( \frac{s_{K}^{1 - \beta} s_{H}^{\beta}}{n + g + \delta} \right)^{\frac{1}{1- \alpha- \beta}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;h^* = \left( \frac{s_{K}^{\alpha} s_{H}^{1- \alpha}}{n + g + \delta} \right)^{\frac{1}{1- \alpha- \beta}}&lt;/math&gt;
In the steady state, &lt;math&gt;y^{*} = (k^{*})^{\alpha} (h^{*})^{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Econometric estimates ===
Klenow and Rodriguez-Clare cast doubt on the validity of the augmented model because Mankiw, Romer, and Weil's estimates of &lt;math&gt;{\beta}&lt;/math&gt; did not seem consistent with accepted estimates of the effect of increases in schooling on workers' salaries. Though the estimated model explained 78% of variation in income across countries, the estimates of &lt;math&gt;{\beta}&lt;/math&gt; implied that human capital's external effects on national income are greater than its direct effect on workers' salaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Klenow|first=Peter J.|last2=Rodriguez-Clare|first2=Andres|editor-first=Ben S.|editor1-last=Bernanke|editor2-first=Julio|editor2-last=Rotemberg|title=NBER Macroeconomics Annual 1997, Volume 12|publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research |date=January 1997 |pages=73–114|chapter=The Neoclassical Revival in Growth Economics: Has It Gone Too Far? |chapterurl=https://www.nber.org/chapters/c11037|isbn=0-262-02435-7|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accounting for external effects ===
Theodore Breton provided an insight that reconciled the large effect of human capital from schooling in the Mankiw, Romer and Weil model with the smaller effect of schooling on workers' salaries. He demonstrated that the mathematical properties of the model include significant external effects between the factors of production, because human capital and physical capital are multiplicative factors of production.&lt;ref name = breton&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S1365100511000824| title = Were Mankiw, Romer, and Weil Right? A Reconciliation of the Micro and Macro Effects of Schooling on Income| journal = Macroeconomic Dynamics| volume = 17| issue = 5| pages = 1023–1054| year = 2013| last1 = Breton | first1 = T. R. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The external effect of human capital on the productivity of physical capital is evident in the marginal product of physical capital:
:&lt;math&gt;MPK=\frac{\partial Y}{\partial K}= {\alpha}A^{1-\alpha}(H/L)^{\beta}/(K/L)^{1-\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

He showed that the large estimates of the effect of human capital in cross-country estimates of the model are consistent with the smaller effect typically found on workers' salaries when the external effects of human capital on physical capital and labor are taken into account. This insight significantly strengthens the case for the Mankiw, Romer, and Weil version of the Solow–Swan model. Most analyses criticizing this model fail to account for the pecuniary external effects of both types of capital inherent in the model.&lt;ref name = breton/&gt;

=== Total factor productivity ===
The exogenous rate of TFP ([[total factor productivity]]) growth in the Solow–Swan model is the residual after accounting for capital accumulation. The Mankiw, Romer, and Weil model provide a lower estimate of the TFP (residual) than the basic Solow–Swan model because the addition of human capital to the model enables capital accumulation to explain more of the variation in income across countries. In the basic model, the TFP residual includes the effect of human capital because human capital is not included as a factor of production.

== Conditional convergence ==
The Solow–Swan model augmented with human capital predicts that the income levels of [[developing nation|poor countries]] will tend to [[Catch-up effect|catch up]] with or '''converge''' towards the income levels of rich countries if the poor countries have similar savings rates for both physical capital and human capital as a share of output, a process known as conditional convergence. However, savings rates vary widely across countries.  In particular, since considerable financing constraints exist for investment in schooling, savings rates for human capital are likely to vary as a function of cultural and ideological characteristics in each country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00131881.2013.801241| title = The role of education in economic growth: Theory, history and current returns| journal = Educational Research| volume = 55| issue = 2| pages = 121| year = 2013| last1 = Breton | first1 = T. R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1950s, output/worker in rich and poor countries generally has not converged, but those poor countries that have greatly raised their savings rates have experienced the income convergence predicted by the Solow–Swan model.  As an example, output/worker in [[Japan]], a country which was once relatively poor, has converged to the level of the rich countries. Japan experienced high growth rates after it raised its savings rates in the 1950s and 1960s, and it has experienced slowing growth of output/worker since its savings rates stabilized around 1970, as predicted by the model.

The per-capita income levels of the southern states of the United States have tended to converge to the levels in the Northern states. The observed convergence in these states is also consistent with the '''conditional convergence''' concept. Whether absolute convergence between countries or regions occurs depends on whether they have similar characteristics, such as:
* [[Education]] policy
* Institutional arrangements
* [[Free market]]s internally, and [[free trade|trade policy]] with other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Robert J. |last1=Barro |authorlink1=Robert J.

Additional evidence for conditional convergence comes from multivariate, cross-country regressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Robert J. |last1=Barro |authorlink1=Robert J. Barro |first2=Xavier |authorlink2=Xavier Sala-i-Martin |last2=Sala-i-Martin |chapter=Growth Models with Exogenous Saving Rates |title=Economic Growth |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2004 |edition=Second |isbn=0-262-02553-1 |pages=461–509 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If productivity growth were associated only with high technology then the introduction of information technology should have led to a noticeable productivity acceleration over the past twenty years; but it has not: ''see'': [[Solow computer paradox]].  Instead, world productivity appears to have increased relatively steadily since the 19th century.

[[Econometric]] analysis on Singapore and the other "[[East Asian Tigers]]" has produced the surprising result that although output per worker has been rising, almost none of their rapid growth had been due to rising per-capita productivity (they have a low "[[Solow residual]]").&lt;ref name="framework"/&gt;

'''Somatic experiencing''' is a form of [[alternative medicine|alternative therapy]] aimed at relieving the symptoms of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) and other mental and physical trauma-related health problems by focusing on the client's perceived body sensations (or somatic experiences). It was created by trauma therapist Peter A. Levine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=van der Kolk|first1=Bessel|author-link=Bessel van der Kolk|title=The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma|date=2014|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9781101608302|page=217|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sessions are normally done in person, and involve a client tracking his or her own experience.&lt;ref name="Scaer 2005"&gt;Scaer, Robert C.: ''The Trauma Spectrum. Hidden Wounds and Human Resiliency''. W.W. Norton &amp; Company, N.Y. &amp; London, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|255–256}} Practitioners are often mental health practitioners such as social workers, psychologists, marriage and family therapists (MFTs) or psychotherapists, but may also be nurses, physicians, [[Bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodyworkers]], physical therapists, chaplains, clergy, or members of other professions. Certified practitioners complete a three-year training course (216 hours of instruction) and must complete 18 hours of case consultations and 12 hours of personal sessions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seaustralia.com.au/somatic-experiencing-australia_professional_training/ Somatic experiencing Australia training], Retrieved 2 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Somatic Experiencing is used for shock trauma in the short term and for developmental trauma as an adjunct to psychotherapy that may span years.

Somatic Experiencing attempts to promote awareness and release physical tension that remains in the aftermath of trauma.&lt;ref name="Scaer 2005"/&gt;{{rp|43–50}}&lt;ref name="Scaer 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scaer|first1=Robert C.|title=The Body Bears the Burden: Trauma, Dissociation, and Disease|date=2001|publisher=The Haworth Press|isbn=0789033348|pages=275|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Body_Bears_the_Burden.html?id=C30EbO7GDMIC|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|38–40}}

==Methods==

Another element of Somatic Experiencing therapy is "pendulation",&lt;ref name="Scaer 2005"/&gt;{{rp|255}} the movement between regulation and dysregulation. The client is helped to move to a state where he or she is dysregulated (i.e. is aroused or frozen, demonstrated by physical symptoms such as pain or numbness) and then iteratively helped to return to a state of regulation. The goal is to allow the client to resolve the physical and mental difficulties caused by the trauma, and thereby to be able to respond appropriately to everyday situations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mary-ware.com/how-does-se-work.html Mary ware Somatic Experiencing], Retrieved 2 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

"Resources" are defined as anything that helps the client's [[autonomic nervous system]] return to a regulated state. This might be the memory of someone close to them, a physical item that might ground them in the present moment, or other supportive elements that minimize distress. In the face of arousal, "discharge" is facilitated to allow the client's body to return to a regulated state. Discharge may be in the form of tears, a warm sensation, unconscious movement, the ability to breathe easily again, or other responses which demonstrate the autonomic nervous system returning to its baseline. The intention of this process is to reinforce the client's inherent capacity to self-regulate.
 
Somatic experiencing is used for both shock trauma and developmental trauma. Shock trauma is loosely defined as a single-episode traumatic event such as a car accident, natural disaster such as an earthquake, battlefield incident, physical attack, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gomentor.com/articles/shock-trauma Gomentor shock trauma], Retrieved 2 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Developmental trauma refers to various kinds of psychological damage that occur during child development when a child has insufficient or detrimental attention from the primary caregivers.&lt;ref name="Scaer 2005" /&gt;{{rp|99–125}}{{Request quotation|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://weinholds.org/what-is-developmental-trauma-2/ Weinholds developmental trauma], retrieved 2 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17331">In [[differential geometry]], a  '''tensor density''' or '''relative tensor''' is a generalization of the [[tensor field]] concept. A tensor density transforms as a tensor field when passing from one coordinate system to another (see [[tensor field]]), except that it is additionally multiplied or ''weighted'' by a power ''W'' of the [[Jacobian determinant]] of the coordinate transition function or its absolute value.  A distinction is made among (authentic) tensor densities, pseudotensor densities, even tensor densities and odd tensor densities. Sometimes tensor densities with a negative weight ''W'' are called '''tensor capacity.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Definition==
{{Refimprove|date=September 2012}}
Some authors classify tensor densities into the two types called (authentic) tensor densities and pseudotensor densities in this article.  Other authors classify them differently, into the types called even tensor densities and odd tensor densities.  When a tensor density weight is an integer there is an equivalence between these approaches that depends upon whether the integer is even or odd.

Note that these classifications elucidate the different ways that tensor densities may transform somewhat pathologically under orientation-''reversing'' coordinate transformations.  Regardless of their classifications into these types, there is only one way that tensor densities transform under orientation-''preserving'' coordinate transformations.

In this article we have chosen the convention that assigns a weight of +2 to the determinant of the metric tensor expressed with [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]] indices. With this choice, classical densities, like charge density, will be represented by tensor densities of weight +1. Some authors use a sign convention for weights that is the negation of that presented here.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{harvnb|Weinberg|1972}} pp 98. The chosen convention involves in the formulae below the [[Jacobian determinant]] of the inverse transition {{math|''x'' → {{overbar|''x''}}}}, while the opposite convention considers the forward transition {{math|{{overbar|''x''}} → ''x''}} resulting in a flip of sign of the weight.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tensor and pseudotensor densities ===
For example, a mixed rank-two (authentic) tensor density of weight ''W'' transforms as:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=M.R. Spiegel |author2=S. Lipcshutz |author3=D. Spellman | title=Vector Analysis |edition=2nd| publisher=Schaum's Outline Series | location=New York | year=2009|page=198| isbn=978-0-07-161545-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=McGraw Hill Encyclopaedia of Physics|edition=2nd| author=C.B. Parker| year=1994|page=1417|isbn=0-07-051400-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
{\mathfrak{T}}^\alpha_\beta =
\left( \det{\left[\frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\iota}}{\partial {x}^{\gamma}}\right]} \right)^{W} \, \frac{\partial {x}^{\alpha}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\delta}} \, \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\epsilon}}{\partial {x}^{\beta}} \, \bar{\mathfrak{T}}^{\delta}_{\epsilon}
\,,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''((authentic) tensor density of (integer) weight ''W'')'''
where &lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathfrak{T}}&lt;/math&gt; is the rank-two tensor density in the &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt; coordinate system, &lt;math&gt;{\mathfrak{T}}&lt;/math&gt; is the transformed tensor density in the &lt;math&gt;{x}&lt;/math&gt; coordinate system; and we use the [[Jacobian determinant]].  Because the determinant can be negative, which it is for an orientation-reversing coordinate transformation, this formula is applicable only when ''W'' is an integer. (However, see even and odd tensor densities below.)

We say that a tensor density is a pseudotensor density when there is an additional sign flip under an orientation-reversing coordinate transformation.  A mixed rank-two pseudotensor density of weight ''W'' transforms as
:&lt;math&gt;
{\mathfrak{T}}^\alpha_\beta =
\sgn\left( \det{\left[\frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\iota}}{\partial {x}^{\gamma}}\right]} \right)
\left( \det{\left[\frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\iota}}{\partial {x}^{\gamma}}\right]} \right)^{W} \, \frac{\partial {x}^{\alpha}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\delta}} \, \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\epsilon}}{\partial {x}^{\beta}} \, \bar{\mathfrak{T}}^{\delta}_{\epsilon}
\,,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''(pseudotensor density of (integer) weight ''W'')'''
where sgn(&amp;nbsp;) is a function that returns +1 when its argument is positive or −1 when its argument is negative.

=== Even and odd tensor densities ===
The transformations for even and odd tensor densities have the benefit of being well defined even when ''W'' is not an integer.  Thus one can speak of, say, an odd tensor density of weight +2 or an even tensor density of weight −1/2.

When ''W'' is an even integer the above formula for an (authentic) tensor density can be rewritten as
:&lt;math&gt;
{\mathfrak{T}}^\alpha_\beta =
\left\vert \det{\left[\frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\iota}}{\partial {x}^{\gamma}}\right]} \right\vert^{W} \, \frac{\partial {x}^{\alpha}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\delta}} \, \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\epsilon}}{\partial {x}^{\beta}} \, \bar{\mathfrak{T}}^{\delta}_{\epsilon}
\,.&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''(even tensor density of weight ''W'')'''

Similarly, when ''W'' is an odd integer the formula for an (authentic) tensor density can be rewritten as
:&lt;math&gt;
{\mathfrak{T}}^\alpha_\beta =
\sgn \left( \det{\left[\frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\iota}}{\partial {x}^{\gamma}}\right]} \right)
\left\vert \det{\left[\frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\iota}}{\partial {x}^{\gamma}}\right]} \right\vert^{W} \, \frac{\partial {x}^{\alpha}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\delta}} \, \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\epsilon}}{\partial {x}^{\beta}} \, \bar{\mathfrak{T}}^{\delta}_{\epsilon}
\,.&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''(odd tensor density of weight ''W'')'''

=== Weights of zero and one ===
A tensor density of any type that has weight zero is also called an '''absolute tensor'''.  An (even) authentic tensor density of weight zero is also called an '''ordinary tensor'''.

If a weight is not specified but the word "relative" or "density" is used in a context where a specific weight is needed, it is usually assumed that the weight is +1.

=== Algebraic properties ===
#A linear combination of tensor densities of the same type and weight {{math|''W''}} is again a tensor density of that type and weight.
#A product of two tensor densities of any types and with weights {{math|''W''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''W''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a tensor density of weight {{math|''W''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''W''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  
#:A product of authentic tensor densities and pseudotensor densities will be an authentic tensor density when an even number of the factors are pseudotensor densities; it will be a pseudotensor density when an odd number of the factors are pseudotensor densities.  Similarly, a product of even tensor densities and odd tensor densities will be an even tensor density when an even number of the factors are odd tensor densities; it will be an odd tensor density when an odd number of the factors are odd tensor densities.
#The contraction of indices on a tensor density with weight {{math|''W''}} again yields a tensor density of weight {{math|''W''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weinberg|1972}} p 100.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Using (2) and (3) one sees that raising and lowering indices using the metric tensor (weight 0) leaves the weight unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weinberg|1972}} p 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Matrix inversion and matrix determinant of tensor densities ===
If &lt;math&gt;{\mathfrak{T}}_{\alpha\beta}&lt;/math&gt; is a non-singular matrix and a rank-two tensor density of weight ''W'' with covariant indices then its matrix inverse will be a rank-two tensor density of weight −''W'' with contravariant indices.  Similar statements apply when the two indices are contravariant or are mixed covariant and contravariant.

If &lt;math&gt;{\mathfrak{T}}_{\alpha\beta}&lt;/math&gt; is a rank-two tensor density of weight ''W'' with covariant indices then the matrix determinant &lt;math&gt;\det {\mathfrak{T}}_{\alpha\beta}&lt;/math&gt; will have weight {{math|''NW'' + 2}}, where ''N'' is the number of space-time dimensions.  If &lt;math&gt;{\mathfrak{T}}^{\alpha\beta}&lt;/math&gt; is a rank-two tensor density of weight ''W'' with contravariant indices then the matrix determinant &lt;math&gt;\det {\mathfrak{T}}^{\alpha\beta}&lt;/math&gt; will have weight {{math|''NW'' − 2}}.  The matrix determinant &lt;math&gt;\det {\mathfrak{T}}^{\alpha}_{~\beta}&lt;/math&gt; will have weight ''NW''.

== General relativity ==
{{General relativity sidebar}}

===Relation of Jacobian determinant and metric tensor===
Any non-singular ordinary tensor &lt;math&gt;T_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; transforms as
:&lt;math&gt;T_{\mu\nu} = \frac{\partial \bar{x}^\kappa}{\partial {x}^\mu} \bar{T}_{\kappa\lambda} \frac{\partial \bar{x}^\lambda}{\partial {x}^\nu} \,,&lt;/math&gt;
where the right-hand side can be viewed as the product of three matrices.  Taking the determinant of both sides of the equation (using that the determinant of a matrix product is the product of the determinants), dividing both sides by &lt;math&gt;\det(\bar{T}_{\kappa\lambda})&lt;/math&gt;, and taking their square root gives
:&lt;math&gt;\left\vert \det{\left[\frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\iota}}{\partial {x}^{\gamma}}\right]} \right\vert = \sqrt{\frac{\det({T}_{\mu\nu})}{\det(\bar{T}_{\kappa\lambda})}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

When the tensor ''T'' is the [[metric tensor]], &lt;math&gt;{g}_{\kappa\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}^{\iota}&lt;/math&gt; is a locally inertial coordinate system where &lt;math&gt;\bar{g}_{\kappa\lambda} = \eta_{\kappa\lambda} =&lt;/math&gt;diag(−1,+1,+1,+1), the [[Minkowski metric]], then &lt;math&gt;\det(\bar{g}_{\kappa\lambda}) = \det(\eta_{\kappa\lambda}) =&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1 and so
:&lt;math&gt;\left\vert \det{\left[\frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\iota}}{\partial {x}^{\gamma}}\right]} \right\vert = \sqrt{-{g}}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;{g} = \det ({g}_{\mu \nu})&lt;/math&gt; is the determinant of the metric tensor &lt;math&gt;{g}_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Use of metric tensor to manipulate tensor densities===
Consequently, an even tensor density, &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{T}^{\mu \dots}_{\nu \dots}&lt;/math&gt;, of weight ''W'', can be written in the form
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{T}^{\mu \dots}_{\nu \dots} = \sqrt{-g}\;^W T^{\mu \dots}_{\nu \dots} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;T^{\mu \dots}_{\nu \dots} \,&lt;/math&gt; is an ordinary tensor.  In a locally inertial coordinate system, where &lt;math&gt;g_{\kappa\lambda} = \eta_{\kappa\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;, it will be the case that &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{T}^{\mu \dots}_{\nu \dots}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T^{\mu \dots}_{\nu \dots} \,&lt;/math&gt; will be represented with the same numbers.

When using the metric connection ([[Levi-Civita connection]]), the [[covariant derivative]] of an even tensor density is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{T}^{\mu \dots}_{\nu \dots ; \alpha} = \sqrt{-g}\;^W T^{\mu \dots}_{\nu \dots ; \alpha} = \sqrt{-g}\;^W (\sqrt{-g}\;^{-W} \mathfrak{T}^{\mu \dots}_{\nu \dots})_{;\alpha} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

For an arbitrary connection, the covariant derivative is defined by adding an extra term, namely
:&lt;math&gt;- W \, \Gamma^{\delta}_{~\delta \alpha} \, \mathfrak{T}^{\mu \dots}_{\nu \dots} \,&lt;/math&gt;

to the expression that would be appropriate for the covariant derivative of an ordinary tensor.

Equivalently, the product rule is obeyed
:&lt;math&gt;(\mathfrak{T}^{\mu \dots}_{\nu \dots} \mathfrak{S}^{\sigma \dots}_{\tau \dots})_{; \alpha} = (\mathfrak{T}^{\mu \dots}_{\nu \dots; \alpha}) \mathfrak{S}^{\sigma \dots}_{\tau \dots} + \mathfrak{T}^{\mu \dots}_{\nu \dots} (\mathfrak{S}^{\sigma \dots}_{\tau \dots; \alpha}) \,,&lt;/math&gt;
where, for the metric connection, the covariant derivative of any function of &lt;math&gt;g_{\kappa\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; is always zero,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
g_{\kappa\lambda ; \alpha} &amp; = 0 \\
(\sqrt{-g}\;^W)_{; \alpha} &amp; = (\sqrt{-g}\;^W)_{, \alpha} - W \Gamma^{\delta}_{~\delta \alpha} \sqrt{-g}\;^W = \frac W2 g^{\kappa\lambda} g_{\kappa\lambda,\alpha} \sqrt{-g}\;^W - W \Gamma^{\delta}_{~\delta \alpha} \sqrt{-g}\;^W = 0 \,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==
{{see also|Maxwell's equations in curved spacetime}}

The expression &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-g}&lt;/math&gt; is a scalar density.  By the convention of this article it has a weight of +1.  &lt;!-- Under the usual convention that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x^2} = |x|&lt;/math&gt; when ''x'' is a real number, the scalar density &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-g}&lt;/math&gt; transforms as an (even) pseudoscalar density rather than as an (odd) authentic scalar density:
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-\det\left(g_{\alpha\beta}\right)}
=\sqrt{-\det\left(\frac{\partial \bar{x}^\mu}{\partial x^\alpha}\bar{g}_{\mu\nu}\frac{\partial \bar{x}^\nu}{\partial x^\beta}\right)}
=\sqrt{-\det\left(\bar{g}_{\mu\nu}\right) \det\left(\frac{\partial \bar{x}^\mu}{\partial x^\alpha}\right)^2}
=\left|\det\left(\frac{\partial \bar{x}^\mu}{\partial x^\alpha}\right)\right| \sqrt{-\det\left(\bar{g}_{\mu\nu}\right)}
\,.&lt;/math&gt;
However, this distinction is not made by many authors, especially in discussions focused on orientation-preserving coordinate transformations, in which the distinction is moot. --&gt;

The density of electric current &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{J}^\mu&lt;/math&gt; (''e.g.'', &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{J}^2&lt;/math&gt; is the amount of electric charge crossing the 3-volume element &lt;math&gt;d x^3 \, d x^4 \, d x^1&lt;/math&gt; divided by that element — do not use the metric in this calculation) is a contravariant vector density of weight +1.  It is often written as &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{J}^\mu = J^\mu \sqrt{-g}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{J}^\mu = \varepsilon^{\mu\alpha\beta\gamma} \mathcal{J}_{\alpha\beta\gamma} / 3!&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;J^\mu\,&lt;/math&gt; and the [[differential form]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{J}_{\alpha\beta\gamma}&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;!-- (even) authentic --&gt; absolute tensors&lt;!-- , whereby &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{J}^\mu&lt;/math&gt; has the same (even) pseudo vs. (odd) authentic type as &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-g}&lt;/math&gt; --&gt;, and where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon^{\mu\alpha\beta\gamma}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Levi-Civita symbol]]; see below.

The density of [[Lorentz force]] &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{f}_\mu&lt;/math&gt; (''i.e.'', the linear momentum transferred from the electromagnetic field to matter within a 4-volume element &lt;math&gt;d x^1 \, d x^2 \, d x^3 \, d x^4&lt;/math&gt; divided by that element — do not use the metric in this calculation) is a covariant vector density of weight +1.  &lt;!-- It has the same (even) pseudo vs. (odd) authentic type as &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{J}^\mu&lt;/math&gt;. --&gt;

In ''N''-dimensional space-time, the [[Levi-Civita symbol]] may be regarded as either a rank-''N'' covariant (odd) authentic tensor density of weight −1 (ε&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;…α&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) or a rank-''N'' contravariant (odd) authentic tensor density of weight +1 (ε&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;…α&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). Notice that the Levi-Civita symbol (so regarded) does ''not'' obey the usual convention for raising or lowering of indices with the metric tensor. That is, it is true that
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon^{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}\,g_{\alpha\kappa}\,g_{\beta\lambda}\,g_{\gamma\mu}g_{\delta\nu} \,=\, \varepsilon_{\kappa\lambda\mu\nu}\,g \,,&lt;/math&gt;
but in general relativity, where &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is always negative, this is never equal to &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{\kappa\lambda\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[determinant]] of the metric tensor,
:&lt;math&gt;g = \det\left(g_{\rho\sigma}\right) = \frac{1}{4!} \varepsilon^{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta} \varepsilon^{\kappa\lambda\mu\nu} g_{\alpha\kappa} g_{\beta\lambda} g_{\gamma\mu} g_{\delta\nu}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
is an (even) authentic scalar density of weight +2.

'''''The Behavior of Organisms''''' is [[B.F. Skinner]]'s first book and was published in May 1938 as a volume of the Century Psychology Series.&lt;ref&gt;B.F. Skinner (1938). ''The Behavior of Organisms: An Experimental Analysis.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: B.F. Skinner Foundation. {{ISBN|1-58390-007-1}}, {{ISBN|0-87411-487-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It set out the parameters for the discipline that would come to be called the [[experimental analysis of behavior]] (EAB) and [[Behavior analysis#21st century behavior analysis|Behavior Analysis]]. This book was reviewed in 1939 by [[Ernest R. Hilgard]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernest R. Hilgard (1939). [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/pagerender.fcgi?artid=1338876&amp;pageindex=1 "Review of B.F. Skinner's ''The Behavior of Organisms''".] ''Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior'' (1988), 50(2), pp. 283–286.&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner looks at science behavior and how the analysis of behavior produces data which can be studied, rather than acquiring data through a conceptual or neural  process. In the book, behavior is classified either as respondent or operant behavior, where respondent behavior is caused by an observable stimulus and operant behavior is where there is no observable stimulus for a behavior. The behavior is studied in depth with rats and the feeding responses they exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Skinner|first=B.F.|title=The behavior of organisms: an experimental analysis|year=1938|publisher=Appleton-Century|location=Oxford, England|pages=457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{listen|filename=17.4 kHz sound.ogg|align=right|title=The Mosquito ringtone|description= This is a 10-second sample of an audio clip at a frequency of approximately 17.4 kHz.&lt;ref name=MK4&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.compoundsecurity.co.uk/security-equipment-mosquito-mk4-anti-loitering-device#key-spec |title=The Mosquito MK4 Anti-Loitering device – Key specifications |publisher=Compoundsecurity.co.uk |date=21 February 2008 |accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''The Mosquito''' or '''Mosquito alarm''' is an electronic device used to deter [[loitering]] by young people by emitting sound at high frequency, in some versions so it can be heard mostly by younger people. The devices have attracted controversy on the basis of human rights and discrimination concerns.

The device is marketed as a safety and security tool for preventing youths from congregating in specific areas. As such, it is promoted to reduce [[anti-social behaviour]], such as loitering,  [[vandalism]], [[recreational drugs|drug use]], drug distribution, and violence. In the UK, over 3,000 have been sold, mainly for use outside shops and near [[transport hub]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7759818.stm Now crime gadget can annoy us all], BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; The device is also sold in Australia, France, Denmark, Italy,  Spain, Germany, Switzerland, Canada and the USA.&lt;ref name=epochtimes&gt;The Epoch Times. 6 August 2008. Joan Delaney, [http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/canada/mosquito-high-frequency-repellent-2280.html ''‘Mosquito’ Prompts Teens to Buzz Off ''.]. Retrieved 6 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics say that it discriminates against young people and infringes their human rights, while supporters argue that making the Mosquito illegal would infringe the rights of shopkeepers who suffer business losses when "unruly teenagers" drive away their customers.&lt;ref name=walesonline&gt;{{cite web|author=Steffan Rhys |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2008/02/11/mosquito-device-inventor-tells-campaign-to-buzz-off-91466-20459944/ |title=News – Wales News – Mosquito device inventor tells campaign to buzz off |publisher=WalesOnline |date=11 February 2008 |accessdate=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mosquito distributors have said that they keep standards to ensure that the device is not abused, and Howard Stapleton who invented the device has asked European governments to legislate guidelines governing its use.&lt;ref name=epochtimes/&gt;

The newest version of the device, launched late in 2008, has two frequency settings, one of approximately 17.4 [[hertz|kHz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pd.npr.org/anon.npr-mp3/atc/atc_teenbuzz.mp3?dl=1 |title=MP3 sample of the 17.4&amp;nbsp;kHz tone |accessdate=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; that can generally be heard only by young people, and another at 8 kHz that can be heard by most people. The maximum potential output [[Sound_pressure#Sound_pressure_level|sound pressure level]] is stated by the manufacturer to be 108 [[decibel|decibels (dB)]], and the manufacturer's product specification furthermore states that the sound can typically be heard by people below 25 years of age.&lt;ref name=MK4 /&gt; The ability to hear high frequencies deteriorates in most humans with age (a condition known as [[presbycusis]]), typically observable by the age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/bring-science-home-high-frequency-hearing/ |title=Sonic Science: The High-Frequency Hearing Test |author=Education.com |work=[[Scientific American]] |date=23 May 2013 |accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Mosquito machine was invented by Howard Stapleton in 2005, and was originally tested in [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]], [[South Wales]], where it was successful in reducing [[teenagers]] loitering near a [[grocery store]].&lt;ref Name="Lyall"&gt;{{cite news|first=Sarah|last=Lyall|authorlink=Sarah Lyall|title=This Mosquito makes unruly teenagers buzz off|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=28 November 2005|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/28/world/europe/this-mosquito-makes-unruly-teenagers-buzz-off.html|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was born after he was irritated by a factory noise when he was a child.&lt;ref name="BBC051108"&gt;{{cite news|title=Noise machine deters shop gangs |publisher=BBC|date=8 November 2005|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/south_east/4415318.stm | accessdate =11 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The push to create the product was when Mr. Stapleton's 17-year-old daughter went to the store to buy milk and was harassed by a group of 12 to 15-year-olds. Using his children as test subjects, he determined the frequency of "The Mosquito."&lt;ref&gt;Discovery's Science Channel "Weird Connections" Episode 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mosquito was released to the mainstream market in 2005, through Stapleton's company Compound Security Solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/business/business-news/lifes-buzz-mosquito-inventor-2367385|title=Life's a buzz for Mosquito inventor|last=Williamson|first=David|date=11 November 2005|work=Wales Online|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current device has two settings: the high frequency sound targeted at youth, and another that can be heard by everyone. The range of the sound is {{convert|140|ft|0}} with the [[sound baffle]], and {{convert|200|ft|0}} without. It requires a 24-volt DC or 15-volt AC power supply.

A device installed in a [[SPAR|Spar]] shop in Caerleon Road in [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], South Wales&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4839346.stm |title=Anti-gang noise box switched off |publisher=BBC News |date=24 March 2006 |accessdate=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; was banned after three months by the Newport Community Safety Partnership, a partnership set up to meet the requirements of the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]], with members including [[Newport City Council]], [[Gwent Police]], Newport Local Health Board, South Wales Fire Service, representatives of [[Her Majesty's Customs and Excise|Customs and Excise]], and the [[Welsh Assembly Government]]. Despite the ban, another Spar shop in Newport installed the device. A Newport Community Safety Partnership spokesman said: "Any view expressed by the Partnership does not stop any business or private company from purchasing these devices. They must ensure these systems comply with the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/archive/2006/04/12/Gwent+Archive/4625078._Mosquito__returns_to_zap_the_rowdies/ |title='Mosquito' returns to zap the rowdies |publisher=South Wales Argus |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426175910/http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/archive/2006/04/12/Gwent+Archive/4625078._Mosquito__returns_to_zap_the_rowdies/ |archive-date=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008, in response to a national campaign launched by the [[Children’s Commissioner for England]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/news/3500-ultra-sonic-dispersal-devises-told-buzz |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207104553/http://www.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/news/3500-ultra-sonic-dispersal-devises-told-buzz |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 February 2017 |title=3,500 ultra-sonic dispersal devises told to Buzz Off |date=12 February 2008 |accessdate=1 February 2017 |publisher=Office of the Children's Commissioner }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty]], and the [[National Youth Agency]], the government issued a statement insisting that "'Mosquito alarms are not banned and the government has no plans to ban them".&lt;ref name=walesonline/&gt;

===Teen Buzz ringtone===

The sound was made into a mobile phone [[ringtone]], which could not be heard by teachers if the phone rang during a class.&lt;ref Name="GadgetSpy "&gt;{{cite web

==Awards==

The Mosquito won the [[Ig Nobel]] for Peace in 2006. The Ig Nobels celebrate the quirkier side of serious scientific endeavour, honouring "achievements that first make people laugh, and then make them think".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/oct/06/science.highereducation |title=Electronic teenager repellant and scraping fingernails, the sounds of Ig Nobel success &amp;#124; UK news |work=The Guardian  |date= 6 October 2006|accessdate=21 June 2009 | location=London | first=Alok | last=Jha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health effects==

The German [[Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] stated in a report on The Mosquito, entitled ''"Use of ultrasonic noise channels not entirely safe"'':

{{quote|The results of the examination are now available. The auditors were not able to certify this device as completely safe.

The risk to the target group of teenagers and young adults is relatively low. They can leave the area when they hear the sound. On the other hand small children and infants are especially at risk, due to lengthy exposure to the sound, because the adults themselves do not perceive the noise. Moreover, the [[ultrasound]] affects not only hearing. Disruption of the equilibrium senses, as well as other extra-aural effects are well known. With the sound levels that can be reached by the device, the onset of dizziness, headache, nausea and impairment is to be expected. This is not the limit of the total risks to safety and health.&lt;ref name="baua"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baua.de/nn_5858/de/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/2007/12/pm079-07.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927131822/http://www.baua.de/nn_5858/de/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/2007/12/pm079-07.html |archive-date=27 September 2011 |title=Einsatz von Ultraschall-Störgeräusch-Sendern nicht ganz unbedenklich |publisher=German Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health |date=14 December 2007 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

In a United Kingdom survey of the relevant studies of adults exposed to high frequency sound in an occupational context for the [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE) in 2001, it was concluded that the studies were inadequate to establish guidelines for safe exposure.&lt;ref&gt;[[Health and Safety Executive]]. Institute of Sound and Vibration Research. [http://www.hse.gov.uk/research/crr_pdf/2001/crr01343.pdf ''Damage to human hearing by airborne sound of very high frequency or ultrasonic frequency'']. Retrieved 23 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mosquito's manufacturer relies on these inconclusive adult studies to justify the safety of the device.&lt;ref&gt;compoundsecurity.co.uk.

The [[National Autistic Society]] said in 2008 that it was "extremely concerned" about possible harmful effects of the devices upon people with autism.&lt;ref name="brookfield"/&gt; Since autism causes auditory [[hypersensitivity]], individuals with this disability can have more intense reactions to this sound, especially if they are also under 25.{{cn|date=November 2015}} Since autism can also affect communication skills, some individuals may not be able to communicate their discomfort to caregivers.{{cn|date=November 2015}} A supermarket in [[Longridge]], England, removed a mosquito device in 2008 after a campaign by a 19-year-old Paul Brookfield, who has autism. Brookfield contended that the device was causing him pain due to his disability.&lt;ref name="brookfield"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/may/04/supermarkets.retail1 ''Store drops anti-yob device'']. Retrieved 16 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other disabilities may be exacerbated by the device. In March 2009, a child who had recently undergone ear surgery reported that the device set off her tinnitus, causing significant pain. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childrensrights.ie/sites/default/files/submissions_reports/files/BriefingNoteMosquitoMarch09_0.pdf ''Children’s Rights Alliance Briefing Note on the Mosquito Device''].

==Support of the Mosquito==

The Mosquito has received support and endorsements from municipalities, school districts, property management companies, convenience stores and other organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compoundsecurity.co.uk/about-us/testimonials|title=Testimonials From Our Clients|publisher=Compound Security Systems|accessdate=17 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rochdale Safer Communities Partnership said the borough was committed to the continued use of the Mosquito:

"We feel totally justified in deploying Mosquito devices in the borough of Rochdale to give the community respite in cases of acute anti-social behaviour and youth nuisance," she said. "We use the devices when there are large groups of young people making life a problem for residents and businesses, as we are very keen not to let problems of anti-social behaviour escalate."&lt;ref name="manchestereveningnews.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/s/1036237_mosquito_device_defended_|title='Mosquito device' defended |last=Ottewell|first=David|date=13 February 2008|work=Manchester Evening News|accessdate=17 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Association of Convenience Stores (ACS) also supports the usage of the device,&lt;ref name="manchestereveningnews.co.uk"/&gt; and so does British Retail Consortium (BRC), stating that "Not all young people are involved in violence, but given that some retail staff are facing a level of insolence [from teenagers] they have to have the option of doing what they can to protect themselves. They are entitled to discourage threatening groups from hanging around or in their shops."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.personneltoday.com/articles/2008/02/14/44435/anti-yob-mosquito-device-backed-by-british-retail-consortium.html|title=Anti-yob 'mosquito' device backed by British Retail Consortium|last=Peacock|first=Louisa|date=14 February 2008|work=Personnel Today|accessdate=17 March 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202211252/http://www.personneltoday.com/articles/2008/02/14/44435/anti-yob-mosquito-device-backed-by-british-retail-consortium.html|archivedate=2 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Maple Ridge, Pitt Meadows and Vancouver west side school districts in British Columbia, Canada, the device has been credited with lowering exterior vandalism at one school by about 40%.&lt;ref name=epochtimes /&gt;

==Opposition==

Opposition categorises it as an indiscriminate&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7240180.stm |title=Calls to ban 'anti-teen' device |publisher=BBC News |date=12 February 2008 |accessdate=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name="Mahadevan"&gt;{{cite web |last=Mahadevan |first=Janaki |title=Campaigners call for Mosquito alarm ban |publisher=Watford Observer |date=14 February 2008 |url=http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/news/2043241.campaigners_call_for_mosquito_alarm_ban/ | accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[sonic weapon]] which succeeds only in demonising children and young people and may breach their human rights.&lt;ref name=BBC3/&gt;  The [[National Youth Rights Association]] has met with some success fighting the devices in the United States.&lt;ref name=NYRA&gt;{{cite news|url=http://youthrights.org/2011/06/22/hastings-debates-pitching-out-teen-vandals/ |title=Hastings Debates Pitching Out Teen Vandals |publisher=StarTribune |date=22 June 2011 |accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYRA2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://youthrights.org/2010/10/04/gallery-place-mosquito-swatted-down/ |title=Gallery Place “Mosquito” Swatted Down |publisher=NBC 4 Washington |date=4 October 2010 |accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A UK campaign called "Buzz off" is calling for The Mosquito to be banned.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; [[Shami Chakrabarti]], director of Liberty, has claimed that the sound is "untested [and] unregulated" and that it can be a "sonic weapon directed against children and young people." [[Albert Aynsley-Green]], the former Children’s Commissioner for England, criticised the devices for indiscriminately targeting all children and babies regardless of their behaviour. He described such measures as "demonising children and young people", and creating a "dangerous and widening divide" between the young and the old.&lt;ref Name="Mahadevan"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC2&gt;{{cite news | date=9 June 2008 | title=UK society 'demonising' children | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7443104.stm | accessdate=14 June 2011 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The device was singled out for criticism in a joint report by children's commissioners for all parts of the UK, which formed part of a United Nations review of standards in the UK.&lt;ref name=BBC2/&gt; A report for the [[Council of Europe]] called for a ban in 2010, suggesting use of the Mosquito may breach human rights law.&lt;ref name=BBC3&gt;{{cite news | date=28 June 2010 | title=Calls to ban Mosquito 'teen repellent' device ruled out | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10442500 | accessdate=14 June 2011 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, the device was banned on all Council and Partnership buildings in Sheffield following a successful campaign led by the then Member of UK Youth Parliament for Sheffield, [[Harrison Carter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheffieldtelegraph.co.uk/news/local/local-teen-wins-campaign-to-ban-controversial-device-1-3104497|title=Local teen wins campaign to ban controversial device|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheffield is the largest city in the country with such a ban in place. It was recognised by the UK Government in their Positive For Youth document, published by the Department for Education in January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Positive for Youth: A new approach to cross-government policy for young people aged 13 to 19 |url=http://media.education.gov.uk/assets/files/positive%20for%20youth.pdf |publisher=[[Department for Education]] |date=2011 |page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy paper acts to set out a new-approach to cross government policy for young people aged 13–19. Although mentioned in the document, a national ban of the mosquito device was not in the Coalition Agreement, and is not part of current Government policy.

In July 2014, a new campaign was started in order to get a mosquito device removed from the public library in [[Milford Haven]], [[Pembrokeshire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/remove-mosquito-device-audio-weapon-from-milford-haven-library|title=Remove Mosquito Device/Audio Weapon from Milford Haven Library!|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milfordmercury.co.uk/news/11330284.display/|title='Mosquito' alarm campaign grows wings|work=Milford Mercury|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/Nodeterentatmhl?fref=ts|title=Stop The Mosquito Device/Anti-Teen Weapon at Milford Haven Library|work=Facebook|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is ongoing.

In 2016, a shopping centre in Queensland, Australia removed the device after two years of campaigning by a local lawyer, due to it discriminating young people. It had been installed in the centre for 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/30/national-ban-sought-on-sonic-anti-loitering-device-aimed-at-young-people |title=National ban sought on sonic anti-loitering device aimed at young people |date=30 June 2016 |last=Robertson |first=Joshua|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==

Campaigners and authorities in many countries have stated that they believe the device to breach human rights&lt;ref name=autogenerated3/&gt; and may even constitute assault.&lt;ref name="archives.tcm.ie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/archives/2007/0530/ireland/using-mosquito-devices-on-children-could-constitute-assault-says-ombudsman-33884.html |title=Using mosquito devices on children could constitute assault, says ombudsman |publisher=Irish Examiner |date=30 May 2007 |accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty]] has expressed concern that the device may violate sections 8 and 14 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|author=Florian Rötzer |url=http://www.heise.de/tp/r4/artikel/24/24893/1.html |title=TP: Akustische Waffe oder harmlose Teenagerabwehr? |publisher=Heise.de |date=20 March 2007 |accessdate=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United Kingdom's [[Human Rights Act 1998]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/news-and-events/mosquito-device.shtml |title=The Mosquito Device |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928044813/http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/news-and-events/mosquito-device.shtml |archive-date=28 September 2007 |publisher=[[Liberty (advocacy group)|Liberty]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Committee on Culture, Science and Education of the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] prepared a report stating that this device violates many articles of both the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and the [[United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child]], and should be banned in Europe, because it is often "painful" and causes "degrading and discriminatory consequences for young people".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |title=Recommendation 1930 (2010): Prohibiting the marketing and use of the “Mosquito” youth dispersal device |url=http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/Xref-XML2HTML-EN.asp?fileid=17891&amp;lang=en |last=Wach |first=Piotr |date=25 June 2010 |publisher=[[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] |accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2008, Baroness Sarah Ludford [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] moved a motion to the [[European Parliament]] to ban the use of the Mosquito. It failed to get enough signatures from MEPs to proceed to a full debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisisplymouth.co.uk/news/EU-rejects-bid-ban-Mosquito/article-326093-detail/article.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712032930/http://www.thisisplymouth.co.uk/news/EU-rejects-bid-ban-Mosquito/article-326093-detail/article.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 July 2009 |title=EU rejects bid to ban Mosquito |publisher=Thisisplymouth.co.uk |date=14 September 2008 |accessdate=21 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Belgium, a resolution was passed by the House in June 2008 asking the government to take all necessary measures to prohibit the use of devices like the Mosquito on Belgian territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rtlinfo.be/rtl/archive/article/143873?&amp;archiveYear=2008 |title=Le Mosquito proche d'être interdit en Belgique? |trans-title=The Mosquito close to being banned in Belgium? |date=26 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720013128/http://www.rtlinfo.be/rtl/archive/article/143873?&amp;archiveYear=2008 |archive-date=20 July 2009|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legality of the device has also been tested in the French courts, where the Tribunal de Grande Instance de [[Saint-Brieuc]] prohibited the use of The Mosquito within its municipality, and ordered a private individual to pay €2,000 compensation after operating the device outside their house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=lefigaro.fr |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualites/2008/04/30/01001-20080430ARTFIG00369-la-justice-interdit-le-boitier-anti-jeunes.php |title=Le Figaro – Actualités : La justice interdit le boîtier anti-jeunes |work=[[Le Figaro]]|date=30 April 2008 |accessdate=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Ireland's Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997, anyone who "directly or indirectly applies force to or causes an impact on the body of another... without the consent of the other" (force including "application of [any] form of energy"), is guilty of committing assault. This issue has been raised in relation to the Mosquito device by Ireland's Ombudsman for Children following legal advice provided by Youth Work Ireland,&lt;ref name="archives.tcm.ie"/&gt; but has yet to be tested in the Irish courts.

In the United Kingdom, the manufacturers claim that the tones are broadcast at 75&amp;nbsp;dB,{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} meaning that the product falls within the government's auditory-safety limits, although the German news source [[Heise News Ticker|Heise]] reported the device emits 85&amp;nbsp;dB.,&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; and websites{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} selling the Mosquito claim it can go up to 95dB with a special chip, which in reality allows the Mosquito to reach 104dB.&lt;ref name="baua" /&gt; The government of the United Kingdom issued a statement in 2008 stating that "'Mosquito alarms are not banned and the government has no plans to ban them".&lt;ref name=walesonline /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7241527.stm |title=No plan to ban 'anti-teen' device |publisher=BBC News |date=12 February 2008 |accessdate=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English county of [[Kent]] has chosen not to allow the usage of the Mosquito on council-owned buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/jun/13/localgovernment.youngpeople |title=Kent bans high-pitch Mosquito which targets youths |work=The Guardian  |date=13 June 2008 |accessdate=21 June 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], specifically in [[abstract algebra]], a '''torsion-free abelian group''' is an [[abelian group]] which has no non-trivial [[torsion (algebra)|torsion]] elements; that is, a [[group (mathematics)|group]] in which the [[group operation]] is [[commutative property|commutative]] and the [[identity element]] is the only element with finite [[order (group theory)|order]].  That is, multiples of any element other than the identity element generate an infinite number of distinct elements of the group.

== Definitions ==
{{main|Abelian group}}

An '''[[abelian group]]''' &lt;math&gt; \langle G, * ,e\rangle &lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''torsion-free''' if no element other than the identity &lt;math&gt; e &lt;/math&gt; is of finite [[Order (group theory)|order]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Fraleigh|1976|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hungerford|1974|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compare this notion to that of a '''torsion group''' where every element of the group is of finite order. 

A natural example of a torsion-free group is &lt;math&gt; \langle \mathbb Z,+,0\rangle &lt;/math&gt;, as only the integer 0 can be added to itself finitely many times to reach 0.

==Properties==
* A torsion-free abelian group has no non-trivial finite [[subgroup (mathematics)|subgroup]]s.
* A [[generating set of a group#finitely generated group|finitely generated]] torsion-free abelian group is [[free abelian group|free]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Troy weight''' is a system of [[Physical unit|unit]]s of [[mass]] customarily used for [[precious metal]]s and [[gemstone]]s. One troy ounce (abbreviated "t oz" or "oz t") is equal to {{val|31.1034768|ul=grams}}, (or about 1.0971 oz. [[avoirdupois]], the "avoirdupois" ounce being the most common definition of an "ounce" in the US).&lt;ref name=nist&gt;https://www.nist.gov/file/330151 pdf National Institute of Standards and Technology - Handbook 44 - Appendix C - General Tables of Units of Measurement&lt;/ref&gt; There are only 12 troy ounces per troy pound, rather than the 16 ounces per pound found in the more common [[Avoirdupois | avoirdupois system]]. The avoirdupois pound has 7000 [[Grain (unit)|grains]] whereas the troy pound has only 5760  grains (i.e. 12 × 480 grains). Both systems use the same grain defined by the [[international yard and pound]] agreement of 1959 as  {{val|0.06479891|u=grams}}. Therefore, the troy ounce is {{convert|480|gr|sigfig=4|disp=or}}, compared with the avoirdupois ounce, which is {{convert|437.5|gr|disp=or}}. The troy ounce, then, is about 10% heavier (ratio 192/175) than the avoirdupois ounce. Although troy ounces are still used to weigh [[gold]], [[silver]], and [[gemstone]]s, troy weight is no longer used in most other applications. One troy ounce of [[Gold as an investment|gold]] is denoted with the [[ISO 4217|ISO 4217 currency code]] XAU, while one troy ounce of [[Silver as an investment|silver]] is denoted as XAG.&lt;ref name="currency-iso.org"&gt;{{Cite web

==Etymology==
Troy weight probably takes its name from the French market town of [[Troyes]] in France where English merchants traded at least as early as the early 9th century.&lt;ref name="OED3troy2"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|chapter-url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/206831|date=June 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|chapter=troy, n.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|quote=The received opinion is that it took its name from a weight used at the fair of Troyes in France}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Partridge|first=Eric|authorlink=Eric Partridge|title=Origins: A Short Etymological Dictionary of Modern English|year=1958|publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul|location=London|page=3566|chapter=Trojan|oclc=250202885|quote=…the great fairs established for all Europe the weight-standard ''Troyes'', whence…''Troy''…}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "troy" is first attested in 1390, describing the weight of a platter, in an account of the travels in Europe of the [[Henry IV of England#Relationship with Richard II|Earl of Derby]].&lt;ref name="OED3troy2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=L.

Charles Moore Watson (1844–1916) proposes an alternative etymology:  ''The Assize of Weights and Measures'' (also known as ''[[Weights and Measures Acts (UK)#Acts of Parliament|Tractatus de Ponderibus et Mensuris]]''), one of the [[statutes of uncertain date]] from the reign of either [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] or [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], thus before 1307, specifies "troni ponderacionem"—which the Public Record Commissioners translate as "troy weight".  The word "troni" refers to markets.  Watson finds the dialect word "troi", meaning a [[Weighing scale|balance]] in Wright's Dialect Dictionary.  Troy weight referred to the tower system; the earliest reference to the modern troy weights is in 1414.&lt;ref name="CMW1910"&gt;{{cite book|last=Watson|first=Charles Moore|title=British weights and measures as described in the laws of England from Anglo-Saxon times|url=https://archive.org/stream/britishweightsme00watsuoft/britishweightsme00watsuoft_djvu.txt|year=1910|publisher=John Murray|location=London|page=82|oclc=4566577|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401195759/http://archive.org/stream/britishweightsme00watsuoft/britishweightsme00watsuoft_djvu.txt|archivedate=2016-04-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Joseph|authorlink=Joseph Wright (linguist)|title=The English dialect dictionary|volume=6|year=1898|publisher=English Dialect Society|location=Oxford|page=250|oclc=63381077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Many aspects of the troy weight system were indirectly derived from the [[Roman currency|Roman monetary system]]. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] used bronze bars of varying weights as currency. An {{Lang|la|[[aes grave]]}} ("heavy bronze") weighed one [[Pound (mass)|pound]]. One twelfth of an {{lang|la|aes grave}} was called an {{lang|la|[[Ancient Roman units of measurement#Weight|uncia]]}}, or in English, an "ounce". Before the adoption of the metric system, many systems of troy weights were in use in various parts of Europe, among them Holland troy, Paris troy, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Kelly, LL.D. - [https://books.google.com/books?id=iqtLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=%22The+Universal+Cambist%22+%22when+silver+is+sold+in+bars%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=L5q-TojYF6OziQK37cmoCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Universal Cambist and Commercial Instructor, Vol. 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327193151/https://books.google.com/books?id=iqtLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=%22The+Universal+Cambist%22+%22when+silver+is+sold+in+bars%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=L5q-TojYF6OziQK37cmoCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwAA |date=2017-03-27 }} p. 20 (1811)&lt;/ref&gt; Their values varied from one another by up to several percentage points.

The troy ounce in use today is essentially the same as the British Imperial troy ounce (1824–1971), adopted as an official weight standard for [[United States]] coinage by Act of Congress on May 19, 1828.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The British Imperial troy ounce (known more commonly simply as the imperial troy ounce) was based on, and virtually identical with, the pre-1824 British troy ounce and the pre-1707 English troy ounce. (1824 was the year the British Imperial system of weights and measures was adopted, 1707 was the year of the [[Acts of Union 1707|Act of Union]] which created the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].) Troy ounces have been used in England since about 1400 and the English troy ounce was officially adopted for coinage in 1527. Before that time, various sorts of troy ounces were in use on the continent.&lt;ref name="1977zupko"&gt;{{cite book

The troy ounce and grain were also part of the [[apothecaries' system]]. This was long used in medicine, but has now been largely replaced by the [[metric system]] (milligrams).&lt;ref name="dictionary.com"&gt;{{cite web | title=Troy Ounce | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/troy%20ounce | work=WordNet 3.0, Dictionary.com | publisher=Princeton University | accessdate=2008-01-10 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226004653/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/troy%20ounce | archivedate=2008-02-26 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only troy weight in widespread use today is the British Imperial troy ounce and its American counterpart. Both are currently based on a grain of 0.06479891&amp;nbsp;gram (exact, by definition), with 480 grains to a troy ounce (compared with {{frac|437|1|2}} grains for an ounce avoirdupois).

The British Empire abolished the 12-ounce troy pound in the 19th century, though it has been retained (although rarely used) in the American system.

===Origin===
The origin of the troy weight system is unknown. Although the name probably comes from the [[Champagne fairs]] at [[Troyes]], in northeastern France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the units themselves may be of more northern origin.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} English troy weights were nearly identical to the troy weight system of [[Bremen]]. (The Bremen troy ounce had a mass of 480.8 British Imperial grains.)&lt;ref name="1977zupko"/&gt;

An alternative suggestion is that the weights come from the Muslim domains by way of the Gold [[Dirham|Dirhem]] (47.966 British Imperial grains), in the manner that [[King Offa]]'s weights were derived from the silver Dirhem (about 45.0 British grains).

According to Watson, troy relates to a dialect word '''troi''' (balance).  Then troy weight is a style of weighing, like [[auncel]] or [[bismar]] weights, or other kindred methods.  The troy weight then refers to weighing of small precious or potent goods, such as [[bullion]] and medicines.&lt;ref name="CMW1910"/&gt;

=== Use in other countries ===
Troy ounces are still often used in precious metal markets in countries that otherwise use [[International System of Units]] (SI),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boerse-frankfurt.de/de/rohstoffe/xetra+gold|title=Börse Frankfurt: Aktien, Kurse, Charts und Nachrichten|author=|date=|website=www.boerse-frankfurt.de|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101044103/http://www.boerse-frankfurt.de/de/rohstoffe/xetra+gold|archivedate=1 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perthmint.com.au/education_uom.aspx|title=Units of Measure - The Perth Mint|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924071802/http://www.perthmint.com.au/education_uom.aspx|archivedate=2015-09-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; except in [[East Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.numismaster.com/ta/numis/Article.jsp?ArticleId=28158|title=Do grams or ounces win?|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506234211/http://www.numismaster.com/ta/numis/Article.jsp?ArticleId=28158|archivedate=2016-05-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[People's Bank of China]], in particular, which has never historically used troy measurements, has begun issuing [[Chinese Gold Panda#The 2016 Panda gold coin|Gold Pandas]] minted according to [[International System of Units|SI weights]].

==Units of measurement==
[[File:comparison of pounds.svg|thumb|400px|Chart comparing the mass (in grams) of tower, Troy, merchant, avoirdupois and London pounds. Each colored block represents one ounce (gold=Troy, blue= avoirdupois, purple=tower)]]

=== Troy pound ===
The troy pound is 5 760&amp;nbsp;grains (≈ 373.24&amp;nbsp;g, 12&amp;nbsp;oz&amp;nbsp;t), while an [[avoirdupois]] pound is approximately 21.53% heavier at 7 000&amp;nbsp;grains (≈ 453.59&amp;nbsp;g).

=== Troy ounce (oz&amp;nbsp;t) ===
One troy ounce (oz&amp;nbsp;t) is equal to {{nowrap|31.103 476 8}} grams.
Also equal to {{nowrap|1.097 142 86}} avoirdupois ounces, exactly {{frac|192|175}}, or about 10% larger.

=== Pennyweight (dwt) ===
{{main|Pennyweight}}

The pennyweight symbol is ''dwt''. There are 24 grains in 1 dwt, and 20 dwt in one troy ounce. Because there were 12 troy ounces in the old troy pound, there would have been 240 pennyweights to the pound—the basis of the fact that the old [[pound sterling|British pound sterling]] of currency contained 240 pence. (However, prior to 1526, English [[pound sterling]] was based on the [[tower pound]], which is {{frac|15|16}} of a troy pound.) The ''d'' in ''dwt'' stands for ''[[denarius]]'', the ancient Roman coin that equates loosely to a penny. The symbol ''d'' for penny can be recognized in the notation for British pre-decimal pennies, in which pounds, shillings, and pence were indicated using the symbols ''£'', ''s'', and ''d'', respectively. For example, ''£6 11s 8d'' indicated six pounds, eleven shillings, and eight pence.

=== Troy grain ===
{{main|Grain (mass)}}

=== Mint weights ===
Mint weights, also known as ''moneyers' weights'' were legalised by Act of Parliament dated 17 July 1649 entitled ''An Act touching the monies and coins of England''. A grain is 20 mites, a mite is 24 droits, a droit is 20 perits, a perit is 24 blanks.&lt;ref name="Britain)1891"&gt;{{cite book|author=Philological Society (Great Britain)|title=A new English dictionary on historical principles: founded mainly on the materials collected by the Philological Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k2xXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA675|accessdate=21 April 2012|year=1891|publisher=Clarendon Press|page=675|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627192804/http://books.google.com/books?id=k2xXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA675|archivedate=27 June 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miege"&gt;{{cite book|author=Miege, Guy|title=The Present State of Great Britain and Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BDs2AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA307&amp;lpg=PA307#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 June 2017|year=1738|publisher=J.

==Scottish system==
In Scotland, the Incorporation of Goldsmiths of the City of Edinburgh used a system in multiples of sixteen. (''See Assay-Master's Accounts, 1681–1702, on loan from the Incorporation to the National Archives of Scotland''.) Thus, there were 16 drops to the troy ounce, 16 ounces to the troy pound, and 16 pounds to the troy stone. The Scots had several other ways of measuring precious metals and gems, but this was the common usage for gold and silver.

The Pound was 7716 BI grains, but after the union, rounded to 7680 BI grains.  This divides to 16 ounces, each of 16 drops, each of 30 grains.  The rounding makes the ounce and grain equal to the English standard.

==Dutch system==
The Dutch troy system is based on a Mark, of 8 Ounces, the ounce of 20 Engels (pennyweight), the Engel of 32 As. The mark was rated as 3798 Grains, English troy, or 246.084 metric grams.  The divisions are identical to the tower system.&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=Patric|title=Universal Cambist|year=1835|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{English pounds}}

The troy system was used in the [[apothecaries' system]], but with different further subdivisions.

==Relationship to British coinage==
King [[Offa]]'s [[currency]] reform replaced the [[sceat]] with the [[silver]] [[penny]].  This coin was derived from half of a silver [[dirhem]].  The weights were then derived by a count of coins, by a mix of [[Charlemagne]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] systems.  A [[shilling]] was set to twelve [[pence]], an [[ounce]] to twenty pence, and a [[British pound|pound]] to twelve ounces or twenty shillings.  The penny was quite a lot of money, so weight by coins was not a general practice.

Later kings debased the coin, both in weight and fineness.  The original pound divided was the [[tower pound]] of 5400 [[grain]]s, but a later pound of 5760 grains displaced it.  Where once 240 pence made a tower pound (and 256 make a troy pound), by the time of the [[Weights and Measures Acts (UK)|United Kingdom Weights and Measures Act]] of 1824, a troy pound gives 792 silver pence, still minted as such as [[Maundy Money]].

[[Sterling silver|Sterling]] originally referred to the Norman silver penny of the late 11th century.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} The coin was minted to a fineness of 11 oz, 2 dwt (in the pound), or 925 [[Millesimal fineness]].

[[File:Federico zuccari, porta virtutis, 1585 circa (urbino, gn delle marche) 07 invidia.jpg|thumb|Allegorical representation of the Vice of [[Envy]], by [[Federico Zuccari]]]]
'''Vice''' is a practice, behaviour, or [[Habit (psychology)|habit]] generally considered [[Morality|immoral]], [[sin]]ful, [[crime|criminal]], [[rude]], [[taboo]], depraved, or degrading in the associated society. In more minor usage, vice can refer to a fault, a negative character trait, a defect, an infirmity, or a bad or unhealthy habit (such as an [[addiction to smoking]]). Vices are usually associated with a transgression in a person's character or temperament rather than their morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=did;cc=did;rgn=main;view=text;idno=did2222.0000.010,|title='Jaucourt, Louis, chevalier de.

The opposite of vice is [[virtue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesaurus.com/browse/vice|title=Vice|publisher=Thesaurus.com|accessdate=2012-06-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524010228/http://thesaurus.com/browse/vice|archivedate=2012-05-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The modern English term that best captures its original meaning is the word ''vicious'', which means "full of vice". In this sense, the word ''vice'' comes from the [[Latin]] word ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#vitium|vitium]]'', meaning "failing or defect".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=vice+&amp;searchmode=none|title=Vice|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2012-06-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129114109/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=vice+&amp;searchmode=none|archivedate=2014-11-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(This meaning is completely separate from the word ''vice'' when used as an official title to indicate a [[wikt:deputy|deputy]], substitute or subordinate, as in [[vice president]], vice-chancellor or [[viceroy]]. The etymology of this usage derives from the Latin prefix ''vice-'', meaning "in the place of".)

== Law enforcement ==
Depending on the country or jurisdiction, vice crimes may or may not be treated as a separate category in the criminal codes. Even in jurisdictions where vice is not explicitly delineated in the legal code, the term ''vice'' is often used in law enforcement and judicial systems as an umbrella for crimes involving activities that are considered inherently immoral, regardless of the legality or objective harm involved.

In the United Kingdom, the term ''vice'' is commonly used in law and law enforcement to refer to criminal offences related to [[prostitution]] and pornography.&lt;ref name="police"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.met.police.uk/co/clubs_and_vice/index.htm|title=Metropolitan Police Service - Please Wait...|publisher=met.police.uk|accessdate=2014-09-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511230918/http://www.met.police.uk/co/clubs_and_vice/index.htm|archivedate=2013-05-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the term is also used to refer to [[drug prohibition law|crimes related to drugs]], alcohol, and gambling.&lt;ref name="Hess 2008 p. 209"&gt;Hess (2008), p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vice squad===

{{redirect|Vice squad}}
A vice squad, also called a vice unit or a morality squad, is (though not always) a police division, whose focus is to restrain or suppress moral crimes. Though what is considered or accepted as a ''moral'' crime by society often varies considerably according to local laws or customs between nations, countries, or states, it often includes activities such as [[gambling]], [[narcotics]], [[pornography]], and [[alcohol law|illegal sales of alcoholic beverages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/vice+squad|title=Vice squad|publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=2012-05-31|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050921013607/http://www.thefreedictionary.com/vice%20squad|archivedate=2005-09-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vice squads do not concentrate on crimes like [[fraud]] and murder.

[[Religious police]], for example [[islamic religious police]] units or [[sharia]] police in certain parts of the [[Arab world|Arab-speaking world]], are morality squads that also monitors for example [[Islam and clothing|dress codes]], observance of store-closures during prayer time, [[Islamic dietary laws|consumption of unlawful beverages or foods]], [[zina|unrelated males and females socializing]], and homosexual behavior.

=== Buddhism ===
{{see also|Buddhist views on sin}}
In the [[Sarvastivadin]] tradition of [[Buddhism]], there are 108 defilements, or vices, which are prohibited. These are subdivided into 10 bonds and 98 proclivities.&lt;ref name="Hirasawa 1998 p. 202"&gt;Hirakawa (1998), p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; The 10 bonds are the following:&lt;ref name="Hirasawa 1998 p. 202" /&gt;
* Absence of [[shame]]
* Absence of [[embarrassment]]
* Jealousy

[[File:Stiftskirche Niederhaslach Glasfenster (Kampf der Tugenden mit dem Laster).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Virtue]]s fighting vices, stained glass window (14th century) in the [[Niederhaslach Church]]]]

Christians believe there are two kinds of vice:{{Citation needed|reason=Can it be stated that these distinctions truly apply broadly across the entire Christian world?|date=April 2010}}
* Vices that come from the physical organism as instincts, which can become perverse (such as lust)
* Vices that come from false idolatry in the spiritual realm

The first kind of vice, though sinful, is believed less serious than the second. Vices recognized as spiritual by Christians include [[blasphemy]] ([[Sacred|holiness]] betrayed), [[apostasy]] ([[faith]] betrayed), despair ([[hope]] betrayed), [[hatred]] ([[Love (religious views)|love]] betrayed), and indifference (scripturally, a "hardened heart"). Christian theologians have reasoned that the most destructive vice equates to a certain type of [[pride]] or the complete idolatry of the self. It is argued that through this vice, which is essentially competitive, all the worst evils come into being. In Christian theology, it originally led to the [[Fall of Man]], and, as a purely diabolical spiritual vice, it outweighs anything else often condemned by the Church.

==== Roman Catholicism ====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Lust]] --&gt;
The [[Roman Catholic|Roman Catholic Church]] distinguishes between vice, which is a habit of sin, and the sin itself, which is an individual morally wrong act. Note that in Roman Catholicism, the word "sin" also refers to the state that befalls one upon committing a morally wrong act. In this section, the word always means the sinful act. It is the sin, and not the vice, that deprives one of God's [[sanctifying grace]] and renders one deserving of God's [[Hell in Christian beliefs#hell in Rom Cath|punishment]]. [[Thomas Aquinas]] taught that "absolutely speaking, the sin surpasses the vice in wickedness".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15403c.htm Entry for ''vice''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405184628/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15403c.htm |date=2007-04-05 }} at NewAdvent.org online Catholic Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, even after a person's sins have been [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|forgiven]], the underlying habit (the vice) may remain. Just as vice was created in the first place by repeatedly yielding to the temptation to sin, so vice may be removed only by repeatedly resisting temptation and performing virtuous acts; the more entrenched the vice, the more time and effort needed to remove it. Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]] says that following rehabilitation and the acquisition of virtues, the vice does not persist as a habit, but rather as a mere disposition, and one that is in the process of being eliminated. Medieval illuminated manuscripts circulated with colorful schemas for developing proper attitudes, with scriptural allusions modelled on nature: the [[tree of virtues]] as blossoming flowers or vices bearing sterile fruit, The Renaissance writer [[Pietro Bembo]] is credited with reaffirming and promoting the Christian perfection of classical humanism. Deriving all from love (or the lack thereof) his&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italnet.nd.edu/Dante/images/tp1515/1515.wc3.150dpi.jpeg Flow diagram leading to the deeper-seated vices in purgatory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505235431/http://www.italnet.nd.edu/Dante/images/tp1515/1515.wc3.150dpi.jpeg |date=2012-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; schemas were added as supplements&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italnet.nd.edu/Dante/text/1515.venice.html Aldus' second edition printing of Dante's Divine Comedy, Venice 1502.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205212641/http://www.italnet.nd.edu/Dante/text/1515.venice.html |date=2012-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the newly invented technology of printing by [[Aldus Manutius]] in his editions of Dante's Divine Comedy dating from early in the 16th century.

=== Dante's seven deadly vices ===
The poet [[Dante Alighieri]] listed the following [[Seven deadly sins|seven deadly vices]], associating them structurally&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wolfram.demon.co.uk/purgatory4.gif |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205191100/http://www.wolfram.demon.co.uk/purgatory4.gif |archivedate=2012-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as flaws in the soul's inherent capacity for goodness as made in the Divine Image yet perverted by the Fall:

#[[Hubris|Pride]] or [[vanity]]: an excessive love of the self (holding the self outside of its proper position regarding God or fellows; Dante's definition was "love of self perverted to hatred and contempt for one's neighbour"). In the Latin lists of the [[Seven Deadly Sins]], pride is referred to as ''superbia''.
#[[Envy]] or [[jealousy]]: resentment of others for their possessions (Dante: "love of one's own good perverted to a desire to deprive other men of theirs"). In the Latin lists of the Seven Deadly Sins, envy is referred to as ''invidia''.
#[[Wrath]] or [[anger]]: feelings of hatred, revenge or denial, as well as punitive desires outside of justice (Dante's description was "love of justice perverted to revenge and spite"). In the Latin lists of the Seven Deadly Sins, wrath is referred to as ''ira'', which primitive vices tempt astray by increasingly '''perverting''' the proper purpose of charity, directing it inwards, leading to a disorded navel-gazing preoccupation with personal goods in isolation absent proper harmonious relations leading to violent disruption of balance with others.
#[[Sloth (deadly sin)|Sloth]] or [[laziness]]: idleness and wastefulness of time or other allotted resources. Laziness is condemned because it results in others having to work harder; also, useful work will not be done. Sloth is referred to in Latin as ''accidie'' or ''acedia'', which vice tempts a self-aware soul to be too easily satisfied, '''thwarting''' charity's purpose as insufficiently perceptible within the soul itself or abjectly indifferent in relationship with the needs of others and their satisfaction, an escalation in evil, more odious than the passion of hate
#[[Seven deadly sins#Greed|Avarice]] (covetousness, greed): a desire to possess more than one has need or use for (or according to Dante, "excessive love of money and power"). In the Latin lists of the Seven Deadly Sins, avarice is referred to as ''avaritia''.
#[[Gluttony]]:  overindulgence in food, drink or intoxicants, or misplaced desire of food as a pleasure for its sensuality ("excessive love of pleasure" was Dante's rendering). In the Latin lists of the Seven Deadly Sins, gluttony is referred to as ''gula''.
#[[Lust]]: excessive sexual desire. Dante's criterion was that "lust detracts from true love". In the Latin lists of the Seven Deadly Sins, lust is referred to as ''luxuria'', which vices tempt cultivated souls in their ability to direct charity's proper purpose to good things or actions, by '''indulging excess'''. Thus in Dante's estimation the soul's detachment from sensual appetites become the vices most difficult to tame, urges not as easily curbed by mere good manners since inflamed via appropriate use rather than inappropriate misuse. Hence conventional respect for the ninth and tenth commandments against coveting and social customs that encourage custody of the eyes and ears become prudent adjuncts to training against vice.
The first three terraces of purgatory expiate the sins which can be considered to arise from love perverted, that is, sins which arise from the heart of the sinner being set upon something which is wrong in the eyes of God. Those being purged here must have their love set upon the right path. The fourth terrace of purgatory expiates the sins which can be considered to arise from love defective, that is, love which, although directed towards the correct subjects is too weak to drive the sinner to act as they should. Those being purged here must have their love strengthened so as to drive them correctly. The fifth, sixth, and seventh terraces of purgatory expiate the sins which can be considered to arise from love excessive, that is, love which although directed towards ends which God considers good is directed towards them too much for the sinner to gain bliss from them, and also so that the sinner is distracted from the love of other things of which God approves. Their love must be cooled to a more sensible level.

In [[mathematics]], '''Voigt notation''' or '''Voigt form''' in [[multilinear algebra]] is a way to represent a [[symmetric tensor]] by reducing its order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a few variants and associated names for this idea: '''Mandel notation''', '''Mandel–Voigt notation''' and '''Nye notation''' are others found. '''Kelvin notation''' is a revival by Helbig&lt;ref name="Helbig"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; of old ideas of [[Lord Kelvin]]. The differences here lie in certain weights attached to the selected entries of the tensor. Nomenclature may vary according to what is traditional in the field of application.

For example, a 2&amp;times;2 symmetric tensor '''''X''''' has only three distinct elements, the two on the diagonal and the other being off-diagonal. Thus it can be expressed as the vector

:&lt;math&gt;\langle x_{1 1}, x_{2 2}, x_{1 2}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

As another example:

The stress tensor (in matrix notation) is given as
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\sigma}=
\left[{\begin{matrix}
  \sigma_{xx} &amp; \sigma_{xy} &amp; \sigma_{xz} \\
  \sigma_{yx} &amp; \sigma_{yy} &amp; \sigma_{yz} \\
  \sigma_{zx} &amp; \sigma_{zy} &amp; \sigma_{zz}
\end{matrix}}\right].
&lt;/math&gt;

In Voigt notation it is simplified to a 6-dimensional vector:
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde\sigma= (\sigma_{xx}, \sigma_{yy}, \sigma_{zz},
  \sigma_{yz},\sigma_{xz},\sigma_{xy}) \equiv (\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \sigma_3, \sigma_4, \sigma_5, \sigma_6).
&lt;/math&gt;

The strain tensor, similar in nature to the stress tensor—both are symmetric second-order tensors --, is given in matrix form as
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\epsilon}=
\left[{\begin{matrix}
  \epsilon_{xx} &amp; \epsilon_{xy} &amp; \epsilon_{xz} \\
  \epsilon_{yx} &amp; \epsilon_{yy} &amp; \epsilon_{yz} \\
  \epsilon_{zx} &amp; \epsilon_{zy} &amp; \epsilon_{zz}
\end{matrix}}\right].
&lt;/math&gt;

Its representation in Voigt notation is
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde\epsilon= (\epsilon_{xx}, \epsilon_{yy}, \epsilon_{zz},
  \gamma_{yz},\gamma_{xz},\gamma_{xy}) \equiv (\epsilon_1, \epsilon_2, \epsilon_3, \epsilon_4, \epsilon_5, \epsilon_6),
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{xy}=2\epsilon_{xy}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{yz}=2\epsilon_{yz}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{zx}=2\epsilon_{zx}&lt;/math&gt; are engineering shear strains.

The benefit of using different representations for stress and strain is that the scalar invariance
:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot\boldsymbol{\epsilon} = \sigma_{ij}\epsilon_{ij} = \tilde\sigma \cdot \tilde\epsilon
&lt;/math&gt;
is preserved.

Likewise, a three-dimensional symmetric fourth-order tensor can be reduced to a 6&amp;times;6 matrix.

== Mnemonic rule ==
A simple [[Mnemonic|mnemonic rule]] for memorizing Voigt notation is as follows:

* Write down the second order tensor in matrix form (in the example, the stress tensor)
* Strike out the diagonal
* Continue on the third column
* Go back to the first element along the first row.

Voigt indexes are numbered consecutively from the starting point to the end (in the example, the numbers in blue).

[[File:Voigt notation Mnemonic rule.svg|180px]]

==Mandel notation==
For a symmetric tensor of second rank
:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\sigma}=
\left[{\begin{matrix}
  \sigma_{11} &amp; \sigma_{12} &amp; \sigma_{13} \\
  \sigma_{21} &amp; \sigma_{22} &amp; \sigma_{23} \\
  \sigma_{31} &amp; \sigma_{32} &amp; \sigma_{33}
\end{matrix}}\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

only six components are distinct, the three on the diagonal and the others being off-diagonal. 
Thus it can be expressed, in Mandel notation, as the vector
:&lt;math&gt; 
\tilde \sigma ^M=
\langle \sigma_{11}, 
\sigma_{22},
\sigma_{33},
\sqrt 2 \sigma_{23},
\sqrt 2 \sigma_{13},
\sqrt 2 \sigma_{12}
\rangle. &lt;/math&gt;

The main advantage of Mandel notation is to allow the use of the same conventional operations used with vectors,
for example:
:&lt;math&gt; \tilde \sigma : \tilde \sigma = \tilde \sigma^M \cdot \tilde \sigma^M = 
\sigma_{11}^2 +
\sigma_{22}^2 +
\sigma_{33}^2 +
2 \sigma_{23}^2 +
2 \sigma_{13}^2 +
2 \sigma_{12}^2.
&lt;/math&gt;

A symmetric tensor of rank four satisfying &lt;math&gt; D_{ijkl} = D_{jikl} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; D_{ijkl} = D_{ijlk} &lt;/math&gt; has 81 components in three-dimensional space, but only 36 
components are distinct. Thus, in Mandel notation, it can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt; \tilde D^M=
\begin{pmatrix}
  D_{1111} &amp; D_{1122} &amp; D_{1133}  &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{1123} &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{1113} &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{1112} \\
  D_{2211} &amp; D_{2222} &amp; D_{2233}  &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{2223} &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{2213} &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{2212} \\
  D_{3311} &amp; D_{3322} &amp; D_{3333}  &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{3323} &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{3313} &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{3312} \\
  \sqrt 2 D_{2311} &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{2322} &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{2333}  &amp; 2 D_{2323} &amp; 2 D_{2313} &amp; 2 D_{2312} \\
  \sqrt 2 D_{1311} &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{1322} &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{1333}  &amp; 2 D_{1323} &amp; 2 D_{1313} &amp; 2 D_{1312} \\
  \sqrt 2 D_{1211} &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{1222} &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{1233}  &amp; 2 D_{1223} &amp; 2 D_{1213} &amp; 2 D_{1212} \\
\end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==
The notation is named after physicist [[Woldemar Voigt]].  It is useful, for example, in calculations involving constitutive models to simulate materials, such as the generalized [[Hooke's law]], as well as [[finite element analysis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hooke's law has a symmetric fourth-order stiffness tensor with 81 components (3&amp;times;3&amp;times;3&amp;times;3), but because the application of such a rank-4 tensor to a symmetric rank-2 tensor must yield another symmetric rank-2 tensor, not all of the 81 elements are independent. Voigt notation enables such a rank-4 tensor to be &lt;i&gt;represented&lt;/i&gt; by a 6&amp;times;6 matrix. However, Voigt's form does not preserve the sum of the squares, which in the case of Hooke's law has geometric significance. This explains why weights are introduced (to make the mapping an [[isometry]]).

A discussion of invariance of Voigt's notation and Mandel's notation be found in Helnwein (2001).&lt;ref name="Helnwein"&gt;{{cite journal

'''''Where Mathematics Comes From: How the Embodied Mind Brings Mathematics into Being''''' (hereinafter ''WMCF'') is a book by [[George Lakoff]], a [[cognitive linguistics|cognitive linguist]], and [[Rafael E. Núñez]], a [[psychologist]]. Published in 2000, ''WMCF'' seeks to found a [[cognitive science of mathematics]], a theory of [[embodied philosophy|embodied]] mathematics based on [[conceptual metaphor]].

==''WMCF'' definition of mathematics==
Mathematics makes up that part of the human conceptual system that is special in the following way:
:"It is precise, consistent, stable across time and human communities, symbolizable, calculable, generalizable, universally available, consistent within each of its subject matters, and effective as a general tool for description, explanation, and prediction in a vast number of everyday activities, [ranging from] sports, to building, business, technology, and science." (''WMCF'', pp. 50, 377)

Nikolay Lobachevsky said "There is no branch of mathematics, however abstract, which may not some day be applied to phenomena of the real world." A common type of [[conceptual blending]] process would seem to apply to the entire mathematical procession.

== Human cognition and mathematics ==
Lakoff and Núñez's avowed purpose is to begin laying the foundations for a truly scientific understanding of mathematics, one grounded in processes common to all human cognition. They find that four distinct but related processes [[metaphor]]ically structure basic arithmetic: object collection, object construction, using a measuring stick, and moving along a path.

''WMCF'' builds on earlier books by Lakoff (1987) and Lakoff and Johnson (1980, 1999), which analyze such concepts of [[metaphor]] and image schemata from second-generation [[cognitive science]].  Some of the concepts in these earlier books, such as the interesting technical ideas in Lakoff (1987), are absent from ''WMCF''.

Lakoff and Núñez hold that mathematics results from the human cognitive apparatus and must therefore be understood in cognitive terms. ''WMCF'' advocates (and includes some examples of) a ''cognitive idea analysis'' of [[mathematics]] which analyzes mathematical ideas in terms of the human experiences, metaphors, generalizations, and other cognitive mechanisms giving rise to them. A standard mathematical education does not develop such idea analysis techniques because it does not pursue considerations of A) what structures of the mind allow it to do mathematics or B) the [[philosophy of mathematics]].

Lakoff and Núñez start by reviewing the psychological literature, concluding that human beings appear to have an innate ability, called [[subitizing]], to count, add, and subtract up to about 4 or 5. They document this conclusion by reviewing the literature, published in recent decades, describing experiments with infant subjects. For example, infants quickly become excited or curious when presented with "impossible" situations, such as having three toys appear when only two were initially present.

The authors argue that mathematics goes far beyond this very elementary level due to a large number of [[metaphor]]ical constructions. For example, the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] position that all is number, and the associated crisis of confidence that came about with the discovery of the irrationality of the [[square root of two]], arises solely from a metaphorical relation between the length of the diagonal of a square, and the possible numbers of objects.

Much of ''WMCF'' deals with the important concepts of [[infinity]] and of limit processes, seeking to explain how finite humans living in a finite world could ultimately conceive of the [[actual infinite]]. Thus much of ''WMCF'' is, in effect, a study of the [[epistemology|epistemological]] foundations of the [[calculus]]. Lakoff and Núñez conclude that while the [[potential infinite]] is not metaphorical, the actual infinite is. Moreover, they deem all manifestations of actual infinity to be instances of what they call the "Basic Metaphor of Infinity", as represented by the ever-increasing sequence 1, 2, 3, ...

''WMCF'' emphatically rejects the [[Platonism|Platonistic]] [[philosophy of mathematics]]. They emphasize that all we know and can ever know is ''human mathematics'', the mathematics arising from the human intellect. The question of whether there is a "transcendent" mathematics independent of human thought is a meaningless question, like asking if colors are transcendent of human thought—colors are only varying wavelengths of light, it is our interpretation of physical stimuli that make them colors.

''WMCF'' (p.&amp;nbsp;81) likewise criticizes the emphasis mathematicians place on the concept of [[closure (mathematics)|closure]]. Lakoff and Núñez argue that the expectation of closure is an artifact of the human mind's ability to relate fundamentally different concepts via metaphor.

''WMCF'' concerns itself mainly with proposing and establishing an alternative view of mathematics, one grounding the field in the realities of human biology and experience. It is not a work of technical mathematics or philosophy. Lakoff and Núñez are not the first to argue that conventional approaches to the philosophy of mathematics are flawed. For example, they do not seem all that familiar with the content of Davis and [[Reuben Hersh|Hersh]] (1981), even though the book warmly acknowledges Hersh's support.

Lakoff and Núñez cite [[Saunders Mac Lane]] (the inventor, with [[Samuel Eilenberg]], of [[category theory]]) in support of their position. ''[[Mathematics, Form and Function]]'' (1986), an overview of mathematics intended for philosophers, proposes that mathematical concepts are ultimately grounded in ordinary human activities, mostly interactions with the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;See especially the table in Mac Lane (1986), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Educators have taken some interest in what ''WMCF'' suggests about how mathematics is learned, and why students find some elementary concepts more difficult than others.

==Examples of mathematical metaphors==
[[Conceptual metaphor]]s described in ''WMCF'', in addition to the Basic Metaphor of Infinity, include:
*[[Arithmetic]] is motion along a path, object collection/construction;
*Change is motion;
*[[Set (mathematics)|Sets]] are containers, objects;
*[[continuous function|Continuity]] is gapless;
*Mathematical systems have an "essence," namely their [[axiom]]atic [[algebraic structure]];
*[[Function (mathematics)|Function]]s are sets of [[ordered pair]]s, curves in the [[Cartesian plane]];
*Geometric figures are objects in space;
*[[Logical independence]] is geometric [[orthogonal]]ity;
*[[Number]]s are sets, object collections, physical segments, points on a line;
*Recurrence is circular.
Mathematical reasoning requires [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] ranging over some [[universe of discourse]], so that we can reason about generalities rather than merely about particulars. ''WMCF'' argues that reasoning with such variables implicitly relies on what it terms the Fundamental [[Metonymy]] of Algebra.

==Example of metaphorical ambiguity==
''WMCF'' (p.&amp;nbsp;151) includes the following example of what the authors term "metaphorical ambiguity." Take the set &lt;math&gt;A = \{\{\emptyset\},\{\emptyset, \{\emptyset\}\}\}.&lt;/math&gt; Then recall two bits of standard terminology from [[naive set theory|elementary set theory]]:
#The [[recursively enumerable set|recursive]] construction of the [[Set-theoretic definition of natural numbers|ordinal natural numbers]], whereby 0 is &lt;math&gt;\empty&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;n \cup \{n\}.&lt;/math&gt;
#The [[ordered pair]] (''a,b''), defined as &lt;math&gt;\{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}.&lt;/math&gt;
By (1), ''A'' is the set {1,2}. But (1) and (2) together say that ''A'' is also the ordered pair (0,1). Both statements cannot be correct; the [[ordered pair]] (0,1) and the unordered pair {1,2} are fully distinct concepts. Lakoff and Johnson (1999) term this situation "metaphorically ambiguous." This simple example calls into question any [[platonism|Platonistic]] foundations for mathematics.

While (1) and (2) above are admittedly canonical, especially within the consensus [[set theory]] known as the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel axiomatization]], ''WMCF'' does not let on that they are but one of several definitions that have been proposed since the dawning of set theory. For example, [[Frege]], ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', and [[New Foundations]] (a body of [[axiomatic set theory]] begun by [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]] in 1937) define [[cardinal number|cardinals]] and [[ordinal number|ordinals]] as [[equivalence class]]es under the [[relation (mathematics)|relations]] of [[equinumerosity]] and [[ordinal number|similarity]], so that this conundrum does not arise. In Quinian set theory, ''A'' is simply an instance of the number 2. For technical reasons, defining the ordered pair as in (2) above is awkward in Quinian set theory. Two solutions have been proposed:
*A variant set-theoretic definition of the ordered pair more complicated than the usual one;
*Taking ordered pairs as primitive.

==The Romance of Mathematics==
The "Romance of Mathematics" is ''WMCF''{{'}}s light-hearted term for a perennial philosophical viewpoint about mathematics which the authors describe and then dismiss as an intellectual myth:
* Mathematics is transcendent, namely it exists independently of human beings, and structures our actual physical [[universe]] and any possible universe. Mathematics is the language of nature, and is the primary conceptual structure we would have in common with extraterrestrial aliens, if any such there be.
*[[Mathematical proof]] is the gateway to a realm of transcendent truth.
* [[Reasoning]] is [[logic]], and logic is essentially mathematical. Hence mathematics structures all possible reasoning.
* Because mathematics exists independently of human beings, and reasoning is essentially mathematical, reason itself is disembodied. Therefore, [[artificial intelligence]] is possible, at least in principle.

It is very much an open question whether ''WMCF'' will eventually prove to be the start of a new school in the [[philosophy of mathematics]]. Hence the main value of ''WMCF'' so far may be a critical one: its critique of [[Platonism]] and romanticism in mathematics.

== Critical response ==

{{Refimprove section|date=July 2007}}}}

Many working mathematicians resist the approach and conclusions of Lakoff and Núñez. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060716051333/perso.unifr.ch/rafael.nunez/reviews.html Reviews] by mathematicians of ''WMCF'' in professional journals, while often respectful of its focus on conceptual strategies and metaphors as paths for understanding mathematics, have taken exception to some of the ''WMCF''{{'}}s philosophical arguments on the grounds that mathematical statements have lasting 'objective' meanings. For example, [[Fermat's last theorem]] means exactly what it meant when [[Fermat]] initially proposed it 1664. Other reviewers have pointed out that multiple conceptual strategies can be employed in connection with the same mathematically defined term, often by the same person (a point that is compatible with the view that we routinely understand the 'same' concept with different metaphors). The [[metaphor]] and the conceptual strategy are not the same as the formal [[definition]] which mathematicians employ. However, ''WMCF'' points out that formal definitions are built using words and symbols that have meaning only in terms of human experience.

Critiques of ''WMCF'' include the humorous:
:"It's difficult for me to conceive of a metaphor for a real number raised to a complex power, but if there is one, I'd sure like to see it." — Joseph Auslander&lt;ref name=Sutcliffe&gt;[http://www.sutcliffe.com/blog/?m=200709 What is the Nature of Mathematics?], Michael Sutcliffe, referenced February 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
and the physically informed:

:"But their analysis leaves at least a couple of questions insufficiently answered. For one thing, the authors ignore the fact that brains not only observe nature, but also are part of nature. Perhaps the math that brains invent takes the form it does because math had a hand in forming the brains in the first place (through the operation of natural laws in constraining the evolution of life). Furthermore, it's one thing to fit equations to aspects of reality that are already known. It's something else for that math to tell of phenomena never previously suspected. When Paul Dirac's equations describing electrons produced more than one solution, he surmised that nature must possess other particles, now known as antimatter. But scientists did not discover such particles until after Dirac's math told him they must exist. If math is a human invention, nature seems to know what was going to be invented."&lt;ref name=Sutcliffe/&gt;

Lakoff made his reputation by linking [[linguistics]] to [[cognitive science]] and the analysis of [[metaphor]]. Núñez, educated in [[Switzerland]], is a product of [[Jean Piaget]]'s school of [[cognitive psychology]] as a basis for logic and mathematics. Núñez has thought much about the foundations of [[real analysis]], the [[real number|real]] and [[complex number]]s, and the Basic Metaphor of Infinity. These topics, however, worthy though they be, form part of the superstructure of mathematics. Cognitive science should take more interest in the [[foundations of mathematics]]. And indeed, the authors do pay a fair bit of attention early on to [[logic]], [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] and the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms]], even lingering a bit over [[group theory]]. But neither author is well-trained in [[first-order logic|logic]] (there is no index entry for "[[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]" or "quantification"), the philosophy of set theory, the [[axiomatic method]], [[metamathematics]], and [[model theory]]. Nor does ''WMCF'' say enough about the derivation of [[number system]]s (the [[Peano axioms]] go unmentioned), [[abstract algebra]], [[equivalence relation|equivalence]] and [[partial order|order]] relations, [[mereology]], [[topology]], and [[geometry]].

Lakoff and Núñez tend to dismiss the negative opinions mathematicians have expressed about ''WMCF'', because their critics do not appreciate the insights of cognitive science. Lakoff and Núñez maintain that their argument can only be understood using the discoveries of recent decades about the way human brains process language and meaning. They argue that any arguments or criticisms that are not grounded in this understanding cannot address the content of the book.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.unifr.ch/perso/nunezr/warning.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020613231421/http://www.unifr.ch/perso/nunezr/warning.html |date=June 13, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been pointed out that it is not at all clear that ''WMCF'' establishes that the claim "intelligent alien life would have mathematical ability" is a myth. To do this, it would be required to show that intelligence and mathematical ability are separable, and this has not been done. On Earth, intelligence and mathematical ability seem to go hand in hand in all life-forms, as pointed out by [[Keith Devlin]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Keith|last=Devlin|title=The Math Instinct / Why You're a Mathematical Genius (Along with Lobsters, Birds, Cats and Dogs)|year=2005|publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press|isbn=1-56025-839-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of ''WMCF'' have not explained how this situation would (or even could) be different anywhere else.

Lakoff and Núñez also appear not to appreciate the extent to which [[intuitionist]]s and [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructivist]]s have anticipated their attack on the Romance of (Platonic) Mathematics. [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer|Brouwer]], the founder of the [[intuitionist]]/[[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructivist]] point of view, in his dissertation ''On the Foundation of Mathematics'', argued that mathematics was a mental construction, a free creation of the mind and totally independent of logic and language. He goes on to upbraid the formalists for building verbal structures that are studied without intuitive interpretation. Symbolic language should not be confused with mathematics; it reflects, but does not contain, mathematical reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=David M.|last=Burton|title=The History of Mathematics / An Introduction|edition=7th|publisher=McGraw-Hill|page=712|year=2011|isbn=978-0-07-338315-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summing up==
''WMCF'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;378–79) concludes with some key points, a number of which follow. Mathematics arises from our bodies and brains, our everyday experiences, and the concerns of human societies and cultures. It is:
*The result of normal adult cognitive capacities, in particular the capacity for conceptual metaphor, and as such is a human universal. The ability to construct [[conceptual metaphor]]s is neurologically based, and enables humans to reason about one domain using the language and concepts of another domain. [[Conceptual metaphor]] is both what enabled mathematics to grow out of everyday activities, and what enables mathematics to grow by a continual process of analogy and abstraction;
*[[Symbol]]ic, thereby enormously facilitating precise calculation;
*Not transcendent, but the result of human [[evolution]] and [[culture]], to which it owes its effectiveness. During experience of the world a connection to mathematical ideas is going on within the human mind;
*A system of human concepts making extraordinary use of the ordinary tools of human cognition;
*An open-ended creation of human beings, who remain responsible for maintaining and extending it;
*One of the greatest products of the collective human imagination, and a magnificent example of the beauty, richness, complexity, diversity, and importance of human ideas.

The cognitive approach to [[formal system]]s, as described and implemented in ''WMCF'', need not be confined to mathematics, but should also prove fruitful when applied to formal logic, and to formal philosophy such as [[Edward Zalta]]'s [http://mally.stanford.edu/theory.html theory of abstract objects]. Lakoff and Johnson (1999) fruitfully employ the cognitive approach to rethink a good deal of the [[philosophy of mind]], [[epistemology]], [[metaphysics]], and the [[history of ideas]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9530">A '''zone diagram''' is a certain geometric object which a variation on the notion of [[Voronoi diagram]]. It was introduced by [[Tetsuo Asano]], [[Jiří Matoušek (mathematician)|Jiri Matousek]], and [[Takeshi Tokuyama]] in 2007.&lt;ref name=AMT2007zd/&gt;

Formally, it is a fixed point of a certain function. Its existence or uniqueness are not clear in advance and have been established only in specific cases. Its computation is not obvious too.

==A particular but informative case==
Consider a group of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; different points &lt;math&gt;\{p_1,\ldots,p_n\}&lt;/math&gt; in the [[Euclidean plane]]. Each point is called a site. When we speak about the [[Voronoi diagram]] induced by these sites, we associate to the site &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{p_k}&lt;/math&gt; the set &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{R_k}&lt;/math&gt; of all points in the plane whose distance to the given site &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{p_k}&lt;/math&gt; is not greater to their distance to any other site &lt;math&gt;p_j,\,j\neq k&lt;/math&gt;. The collection &lt;math&gt;(R_k)_{k=1}^n&lt;/math&gt; of these regions is the Voronoi diagram associated with these sites, and it induces a decomposition of the [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] into regions: the Voronoi regions (Voronoi cells).

In a zone diagram  the region associated with the site &lt;math&gt;p_k&lt;/math&gt; is defined a little bit differently: instead of associating it the set of all points whose distance to &lt;math&gt;p_k&lt;/math&gt; is not greater than their distance to the other sites, we associate to &lt;math&gt;p_k&lt;/math&gt; the set &lt;math&gt;R_k&lt;/math&gt; of all points in the plane whose distance to &lt;math&gt;p_k&lt;/math&gt; is not greater than their distance to any other region. Formally,

:&lt;math&gt;R_k=\{x\,|\,\,d(x,p_k)\leq d(x,R_j),\,\text{for all}\, j\neq k\}&lt;/math&gt;.
Here &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{d(a,b)}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[euclidean distance]] between the points &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d(x,A)=\inf\{d(x,a) \,|\, a\in A\}&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and the set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. In addition, &lt;math&gt;x=(x_1,x_2)\in \mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;  since we consider the plane. The tuple &lt;math&gt;(R_k)_{k=1}^n&lt;/math&gt; is the zone diagram associated with the sites.

The problem with this definition is that it seems circular:  in order to know &lt;math&gt;R_k&lt;/math&gt; we should know &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{R_j}&lt;/math&gt; for each index &lt;math&gt;j,\,j\neq k&lt;/math&gt; but each such &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{R_j}&lt;/math&gt; is defined in terms of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{R_k}&lt;/math&gt;. On a second thought, we see that actually the [[tuple]] &lt;math&gt;(R_k)_{k=1}^n&lt;/math&gt; is a solution of the following system of equations:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
R_1=\{x\in \mathbb{R}^2\,|\,\,d(x,p_1)\leq d(x,R_j),\,\text{for all}\, j\neq 1\}\\
\vdots\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\vdots\\
R_n=\{x\in \mathbb{R}^2\,|\,\,d(x,p_n)\leq d(x,R_j),\,\text{for all}\, j\neq n\}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Rigorously, a zone diagram is any solution of this system, if such a solution exists. This definition can be extended without essentially any change to higher dimensions, to sites which are not necessarily points, to infinitely many sites, etc.

==Interpretation==
In some settings, such as the one described above, a zone diagram can be interpreted as a certain equilibrium between mutually hostile kingdoms,.&lt;ref name=AMT2007zd/&gt;&lt;ref name=RR2009/&gt; In a discrete setting it can be interpreted as a stable configuration in a certain combinatorial game.&lt;ref name=RR2009/&gt;

==Formal definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{(X,d)} &lt;/math&gt; be a [[metric space]] and let &lt;math&gt; \displaystyle{K} &lt;/math&gt; be a set of at least 2 elements (indices), possibly infinite. Given a tuple &lt;math&gt; (P_k)_{k\in K} &lt;/math&gt; of nonempty subsets of &lt;math&gt; \displaystyle{X} &lt;/math&gt;, called the sites, a zone diagram  with respect to this [[tuple]] is a tuple &lt;math&gt; R=(R_k)_{k\in K} &lt;/math&gt; of subsets of &lt;math&gt; \displaystyle{X} &lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt; k\in K&lt;/math&gt; the following equation is satisfied:

:&lt;math&gt;
R_k=\{x\in X\,|\,\,d(x,P_k)\leq d(x,R_j),\,\text{for all}\, j\neq k\}.
&lt;/math&gt;

==Zone diagram as a fixed point==
The system of equations which defines the zone diagram can be represented as a fixed point of a function defined on a product space. Indeed, for each index &lt;math&gt;k\in K&lt;/math&gt; let &lt;math&gt; \displaystyle{X_k}&lt;/math&gt; be the set of all nonempty subsets of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{X}&lt;/math&gt;.
Let

:&lt;math&gt;Y=\prod_{k\in K} X_k &lt;/math&gt;

and let &lt;math&gt;\text{Dom}:Y\to Y &lt;/math&gt; be the function defined by &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\text{Dom}(R)=S}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;S=(S_k)_{k\in K}&lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt;
S_k=\{x\in X\,|\,\,d(x,P_k)\leq d(x,R_j),\,\text{for all}\, j\neq k\}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Then  &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a zone diagram if and only if it is a [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] of '''Dom''', that is, &lt;math&gt;R=\displaystyle{\text{Dom}(R)}&lt;/math&gt;. Viewing zone diagrams as fixed points is useful since in some settings known tools or approaches from [[fixed point theory]] can be used for investigating them and
deriving relevant properties (existence,  etc.).

==Existence and uniqueness==
Following the pioneering work of Asano et al.&lt;ref name=AMT2007zd/&gt; (existence and uniqueness of the zone diagram in the euclidean plane with respect to finitely many point sites), several existence or existence and uniqueness results have been published. As of 2012, the most general results which have been published are:

* '''2 sites (existence):''' there exists at least one zone diagram for any pair of arbitrary sites in any [[metric space]]. In fact, this existence result holds in any [[m-space]] &lt;ref name=RR2009/&gt; (a generalization of [[metric space]] in which, for instance, the distance function may be negative and may not satisfy the triangle inequality).
* '''More than 2 sites (existence):''' there exists a zone diagram of finitely many [[Compact space|compact]] and disjoint sites contained in the interior of a compact and [[convex subset]] of a [[uniformly convex space]]. This result actually holds in a more general setting.&lt;ref name=KRR20123/&gt;
* '''More than 2 sites (existence and uniqueness):''' there exists a unique zone diagram with respect to any collection (possibly infinite) of closed and positively separated sites in any finite-dimensional [[euclidean space]]. Positively separated means that there exists a positive lower bound on the distance between any two sites. A similar result was formulated for the case in which the normed space is  finite-dimensional and is both uniformly convex and uniformly smooth.&lt;ref name=KMT20123/&gt;
* '''non-uniqueness''': simple examples are known even for the case of two point sites,.&lt;ref name=RR2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=KMT20123/&gt;

==Computation==
More information is needed.

==Related objects and possible applications==
In addition to [[Voronoi diagrams]], zone diagrams are closely related to other geometric objects such as [[double zone diagrams]],&lt;ref name=RR2009/&gt; [[trisectors]],&lt;ref name=AMT2007dt/&gt; [[k-sectors]],&lt;ref name=IKMRT2010/&gt; [[mollified zone diagrams]]&lt;ref name=dBKK2011/&gt; and as a result may be used for solving problems related to robot motion and VLSI design,.&lt;ref name=AMT2007dt/&gt;&lt;ref name=IKMRT2010/&gt;
