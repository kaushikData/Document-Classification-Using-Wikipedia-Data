'''Alexandra (Alex) Z. Worden''' (born 1970) is a marine microbial ecologist and genome scientist. She leads the microbial ecology research group at the [[Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute]] where she holds the position of Senior Scientist. Her laboratory also bridges with the Ocean Sciences Department at the [[University of California Santa Cruz]] where she is Professor Adjunct.
 
Worden’s research focuses on the physiology and ecology of eukaryotic phytoplankton, unicellular organisms that are responsible for a large portion of ocean primary production (photosynthetic uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide). Worden’s early work focused on methods development for directly investigating populations in the nature environment and their roles in the [[carbon cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/fetch?CALLER=EN_NEWS&amp;ACTION=D&amp;SESSION=&amp;RCN=30681|title=European Commission : CORDIS : News and Events : Green genes provide insights into climate change|website=cordis.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7kY4GQAgIg|title=JGI Community Faces: Alexandra Z. Worden|first=|last=DOE Joint Genome Institute|date=16 October 2008|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theme has persisted throughout her research career.

As a postdoctoral fellow at [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] Worden was recognized for establishing the importance of small eukaryotic phytoplankton known as [[picoeukaryotes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.4319/lo.2004.49.1.0168 | volume=49 | issue=1 | title=Assessing the dynamics and ecology of marine picophytoplankton: The importance of the eukaryotic component | journal=Limnology and Oceanography | pages=168–179 | author=Worden Alexandra Z| citeseerx=10.1.1.527.5206 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(15)00324-3.pdf |title=Research |website=cell.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second study by Worden while in the laboratory of [[Farooq Azam]] overturned the idea that ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' existed primarily attached to copepods in aquatic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Worden AZ, Seidel M, Smriga S, Wick A, Malfatti F, Bartlett D, Azam F | year = 2006 | title = Trophic regulation of Vibrio cholerae in coastal marine waters | journal = Environmental Microbiology | volume = 8 | pages = 21&amp;ndash;29 | pmid = 16343318 | doi=10.1111/j.1462-2920.2005.00863.x | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was considered important for understanding ecology of this human pathogen and vectors for transmission of infective cells. She and Azam also introduced the concept of Ecosystems Biology (also spelled Eco-systems Biology or (Eco)-systems Biology), coining the term in a 2004 perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=15016987|year=2004|author1=Azam|first1=F|title=Oceanography.

Z.|doi=10.1126/science.1093892}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was embraced by the scientific community in several later perspectives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=18587409|year=2008|author1=Raes|first1=J|title=Molecular eco-systems biology: Towards an understanding of community function|journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology|volume=6|issue=9|pages=693–9|last2=Bork|first2=P|doi=10.1038/nrmicro1935}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=3196472|year=2011|author1=Karsenti|first1=E|title=A Holistic Approach to Marine Eco-Systems Biology|journal=PLoS Biology|volume=9|issue=10|pages=e1001177|last2=Acinas|first2=S.

A Jacques Monod conference on Marine Eco-Systems Biology was initiated in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrs.fr/insb/cjm/2015/Boyen_e.html|title=CNRS - Conférences Jacques Monod 2015|website=www.cnrs.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worden pioneered eukaryotic "targeted metagenomics" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cuvelier ML| year = 2010 | title = Targeted metagenomics and ecology of globally important uncultured eukaryotic phytoplankton| journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 107 | pages = 14679&amp;ndash;84 | pmid = 20668244 | issue = 33 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1001665107 | pmc=2930470|display-authors=etal| bibcode = 2010PNAS..10714679C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Raven JA| year = 2012 | title = Algal biogeography: metagenomics shows distribution of a picoplanktonic pelagophyte | journal = Current Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 17 | pages = R675&amp;ndash;7 | doi= 10.1016/j.cub.2012.07.030| pmid = 22974994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(15)00324-3|title=Biology’s dark matter|first=Cyrus|last=Martin|date=20 April 2015|journal=Current Biology|volume=25|issue=8|pages=R301–R307|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2015.03.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein cells of particular interest are separated from the masses using [[flow cytometry]] (on a ship) and genomes are then sequenced from only the cells of greatest interest.

She is a proponent of [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] education and innovation and has highlighted the need for relevant "...role models to inspire greater diversity and creativity" in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tos.org/oceanography/issue/volume-27-issue-04-supplement|title=Volume 27 Issue 04 Supplement - Oceanography|website=www.tos.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Worden started her laboratory in 2004 as Assistant Professor at the [[Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science]] in Miami, Florida USA. In 2004 she was also awarded a Young Investigator in [https://www.moore.org/initiative-strategy-detail?initiativeId=marine-microbiology-initiative Marine Microbiology] Award&lt;ref&gt;http://aslo.org/bulletin/04_v13_i4.pdf ASLO Bulletin Vol 13 (4) December 2004&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation]]. In 2007 she was hired to build a microbial ecology research group at [[MBARI]] on the U.S. West Coast under the leadership of [[Marcia McNutt]]. In 2009, Worden was named a scholar of the [[Canadian Institute for Advanced Research]] (CIFAR), later becoming a fellow of CIFAR (2011). She became a GBMF Marine Investigator in 2013, an award given for her "creativity, innovation, and potential to make major, new breakthroughs"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goodtimes.sc/uncategorized/mini-microbes-make-a-big-splash/|title=Mini Microbes Make A Big Splash - Good Times Santa Cruz|website=goodtimes.sc}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was elected as a Fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.asm.org/index.php/asm-newsroom2/press-releases/94046-78-fellows-elected-to-the-american-academy-of-microbiology|title=78 Fellows Elected to the American Academy of Microbiology|first=Joanna|last=Urban|website=www.asm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Worden attended [[Wellesley College]], where she received a B.A. in history, and performed a concentration in Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences coursework at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. At the latter she worked in the laboratories of John M. Edmond,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/12.000/www/m2005/a2/finalwebsite/environ/locale/jedmond.shtml|title=JOHN EDMOND|website=web.mit.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reginald Newell and [[Sallie W.

'''Amil Kumar Das''' (1902&amp;nbsp;– February 18, 1961) was an [[India]]n [[astronomer]].
During the [[International Geophysical Year]],  observatories in [[Madrid]], [[India]], and [[Manila]] were responsible for monitoring solar effects. The [[Kodaikanal Solar Observatory]] in [[South India]] performed this monitoring using their recently built [[Kodaikanal Solar Observatory#Solar Tunnel Telescope|solar tunnel telescope]]. Dr. Das was the director of the Kodaikanal observatory at this time. In 1960 he was responsible for installing a tower/tunnel telescope at the facility that would be used to perform some of the first ever helioseismology investigations.&lt;ref name="bappu"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bappu|first=M.K.V.|date=June 2000|title=The Kodaikanal Observatory - A Historical Account |journal= Journal of Astrophysics and Astronomy|publisher=Indian Academy of Sciences|location=Bangalore|volume=21|pages=105|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/JApA./0021//0000105.000.html|doi=10.1007/bf02702374|bibcode=2000JApA...21..103.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aristid Lindenmayer''' (17 November 1925 – 30 October 1989) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[biologist]]. In 1968 he developed a type of [[formal languages]] that is today called [[L-system]]s or Lindenmayer Systems. Using those systems Lindenmayer modelled the behaviour of cells of plants. L-systems nowadays are also used to model whole plants.

[[Image:Fractal weeds.jpg|thumb|300px|Plant generated using an L-system in 3D.]]
Lindenmayer worked with [[yeast]] and filamentous [[fungi]] and studied the growth patterns of various types of algae, such as the blue/green bacteria [[Anabaena|''Anabaena catenula'']]. Originally the L-systems were devised to provide a formal description of the development of such simple multicellular organisms, and to illustrate the neighbourhood relationships between plant cells. Later on, this system was extended to describe higher plants and complex branching structures.

==Career==
Lindenmayer studied chemistry and biology at the [[Eötvös Loránd University|University of Budapest]] from 1943 to 1948. He received his Ph.D. in plant physiology in
1956 at the [[University of Michigan]].&lt;ref name="Franklin1974"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Franklin|title=The Rhode Island Almanack|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7TIIAAAAIAAJ|year=1974|publisher=John Carter Brown Library|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 he became professor in Philosophy of Life Sciences and Biology at the [[Utrecht University|University of Utrecht]], The Netherlands. From 1972 onward he headed the Theoretical Biology Group at Utrecht University.&lt;ref&gt;Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz, Martin de Boer (1991) Obituary Aristid Lindenmayer (1925-1989), ''Int. J.

'''Arnold Patrick Spencer-Smith''' (1883&amp;ndash;1916) was a British clergyman and amateur photographer who joined [[Sir Ernest Shackleton]]'s [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]], 1914&amp;ndash;17, as Chaplain and photographer on the [[Ross Sea party]]. The hardship of the expedition resulted in Spencer-Smith's death. [[Cape Spencer-Smith]] on [[White Island (Ross Archipelago)|White Island]] at {{coord|78|00|S|167|27|E}} is named in his honour.

==Biography==
Born in Streatham (he shared his birthday, 17 March, with [[Lawrence Oates|Captain Lawrence Oates]] but was three years younger&lt;ref&gt;Tyler-Lewis, p77&lt;/ref&gt;), he attended Westminster City School,&lt;ref&gt;Westminster City School and its Origins by R.Carrington Published by kind permission of the United Westminster Schools Foundation and the Governors of Westminster City School. 1983&lt;/ref&gt; [[King's College London]] and [[Queen's College, Cambridge]].  He did not attend his exams and was given a pass degree in history.&lt;ref name=queens/&gt; After a few years teaching at  [[Merchiston Castle School]], [[Edinburgh]], Spencer-Smith was ordained as deacon into the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]] in 1910, subsequently being appointed [[curate]] of All Saints, Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;APS-S biog. summary on http://www.heritage.antarctica.org/AHT/CrewRossSeaParty&lt;/ref&gt; He was ordained as [[priest]] shortly before leaving England to join the Aurora.&lt;ref&gt;Tyler-Lewis, p40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expedition member==
It is unclear how he came to join the expedition.  One version is that he had wanted to enlist in the army at the outbreak of war, but as a clergyman was barred from combatant service.  He therefore volunteered himself to Shackleton as a replacement for one of the original party who had left for active service.&lt;ref&gt;Huntford, pp412-13&lt;/ref&gt;  After arrival in [[Antarctica]] his unfamiliarity with polar work and limited physical stamina were in evidence during the first (January&amp;ndash;March 1915) depot-laying journey, before he was sent back to base by expedition leader [[Aeneas Mackintosh]].&lt;ref&gt;Huntford p414&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 1915 winter season he worked at the [[Cape Evans]] base, mainly in the darkroom where he sometimes held religious services.&lt;ref&gt;Huntford, p452&lt;/ref&gt;

The circumstances of the expedition, after the depletion of the shore party following the loss of [[SY Aurora]] in May 1915, meant that Spencer-Smith was required for the main depot journey to the [[Beardmore Glacier]] during the 1915&amp;ndash;16 summer season, irrespective of his physical limitations.&lt;ref&gt;It is likely that, had the ''Aurora'' remained moored, other members of the ship's party would have fortified the shore party and the physical demands on Spencer-Smith would have lessened&lt;/ref&gt;  In this he showed no reluctance and worked tirelessly.  However, worn down by the preliminary work of hauling stores up to the base depot at [[Minna Bluff]] during the four-month period September&amp;ndash;December 1915, he was unable to sustain the physical effort required on the main depot-laying journey south, and collapsed before the Beardmore was reached. Thereafter he had to be carried on the sledge, unable to help himself and dependent on [[Ernest Wild]] for his most basic needs.&lt;ref&gt;Bickel, p143&lt;/ref&gt;  The party nevertheless completed its depot-laying mission and struggled back northward in worsening weather conditions, each man growing weaker as [[scurvy]] took hold, and progress forward was with acute difficulty.  Spencer-Smith, uncomplaining but in the latter stages occasionally delirious,&lt;ref&gt;Bickel, p182&lt;/ref&gt; died on the Barrier on 9 March 1916, aged 32, two days before the safety of [[Hut Point]] was finally reached.  He was buried in the ice.&lt;ref&gt;Bickel, p191&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnold Spencer-Smith was unmarried. He dedicated a final diary entry, 7 March 1916, to his father, mother, brothers and sisters.  He is commemorated by Cape Spencer-Smith on White Island at {{coord|78|00|S|167|27|E}}.

==His wallet==
In 1999 a team of investigators entered [[Scott's Hut|Captain Scott's hut]] at [[Cape Evans]], and found a wallet with three photographs of a camping expedition in it. After extensive investigations it was established that this wallet had belonged to Arnold Spencer-Smith.&lt;ref&gt;The Australian, Christmas Weekend Edition 24, 6 December 1999, Bruce Montgomery - cited by Queens&lt;/ref&gt; The wallet, mislaid in 1915, was thus found after 84 years.&lt;ref name=queens&gt;{{cite web |title=Heroism and Tragedy in the Antarctic |author=Jonathan Holmes |url=http://www.queens.cam.ac.uk/queens/record/2000/History/Antarctic.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812081411/http://www.queens.cam.ac.uk/Queens/Record/2000/History/Antarctic.html |archivedate=August 12, 2007 |accessdate=September 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1513">'''Bediasite''' is a form or type of [[tektite]].  It originates in an area in the eastern part of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]] centered on the small town of [[Bedias, Texas|Bedias]] which is {{convert|74|mi|km}} north west of [[Houston, Texas|Houston]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geobytes.com/CityDistanceTool.htm?d&amp;pt_1=ustxhous&amp;pt_2=ustxbedi Geobytes]&lt;/ref&gt;  They are found in about nine Texas Counties in an area of over {{convert|7000|sqmi|km2}}.  The largest specimen ever found is just over 200 grams.

Virgil Barnes was one of the first scientists to study Bediasites in depth.  The first identified Bediasite was brought to the [[University of Texas]] at Austin in 1936 by George D. Ramsey and was identified by Virgil Barnes.&lt;ref&gt;"Contributions" 477.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bediasites are part of the 34-million-year-old North American strewnfield coming from the [[Chesapeake Bay impact crater]].&lt;ref&gt;Koeberl 1265.&lt;/ref&gt;  Two strewnfields and tektite groups are associated with this impact:  the black Bediasites in Texas and the green [[Georgiaites]] in Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;Ridpath 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[theoretical physics]], '''boundary conformal field theory''' ('''BCFT''') is a [[conformal field theory]] defined on a [[spacetime]] with a boundary (or boundaries). Different kinds of boundary conditions for the fields may be imposed on the fundamental fields; for example, [[Neumann boundary condition]] or [[Dirichlet boundary condition]] is acceptable for free [[boson]]ic fields. BCFT was developed by John Cardy.

In the context of [[string theory]], physicists are often interested in two-dimensional BCFTs. The specific types of boundary conditions in a specific CFT describe different kinds of [[D-branes]].

BCFT is also used in condensed matter physics - it can be used to study boundary critical behavior and to solve quantum impurity models.

'''Carreau fluid''' is a type of [[generalized Newtonian fluid]] where viscosity, &lt;math&gt;
\mu_{\operatorname{eff}}&lt;/math&gt;, depends upon the [[shear rate]], &lt;math&gt;\dot \gamma&lt;/math&gt;, by the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mu_{\operatorname{eff}}(\dot \gamma) = \mu_{\operatorname{\inf}} + (\mu_0 - \mu_{\operatorname{\inf}}) \left(1+\left(\lambda \dot \gamma\right) ^2 \right) ^ {\frac {n-1} {2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Where: &lt;math&gt;\mu_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mu_{\operatorname{\inf}}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are material coefficients.

&lt;math&gt;\mu_0&lt;/math&gt; = viscosity at zero shear rate (Pa.s)

&lt;math&gt;\mu_{\operatorname{\inf}}&lt;/math&gt; = viscosity at infinite shear rate (Pa.s)

&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; = relaxation time (s)

&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; = power index


At low shear rate (&lt;math&gt; \dot \gamma \ll 1/\lambda &lt;/math&gt;) a Carreau fluid behaves as a [[Newtonian fluid]] with viscosity &lt;math&gt; \mu_0 &lt;/math&gt;. At intermediate shear rates (&lt;math&gt; \dot \gamma \gtrsim 1/\lambda &lt;/math&gt;), a Carreau fluid behaves as a [[Power-law fluid]].  At high shear rate, which depends on the power index &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; and the infinite shear-rate viscosity &lt;math&gt; \mu_{\operatorname{\inf}} &lt;/math&gt;, a Carreau fluid behaves as a [[Newtonian fluid]] again with viscosity &lt;math&gt; \mu_{\operatorname{\inf}} &lt;/math&gt;.

The model was first proposed by [[Pierre Carreau]].

'''Chou's invariance theorem''', named after [[Kuo-Chen Chou]], was developed to address a problem raised in [[bioinformatics]] and [[cheminformatics]] related to [[multivariate statistics]]. Where a distance that would, in standard [[statistical theory]], be defined as a [[Mahalanobis distance]] cannot be defined in this way because the relevant [[covariance matrix]] is [[singular matrix|singular]].  One effective approach to solve this problem would be to reduce the [[Dimension (vector space)|dimension]] of the multivariate space until the relevant covariance matrix is [[invertible matrix|invertible]] or well defined. This can be achievable by simply omitting one or more of the original components until the matrix concerned is no longer singular. Chou's invariance theorem says that it does not matter which of the components or coordinates are selected for removal because exactly the same final value would be obtained. 

== Background ==
When using [[Mahalanobis distance]] or covariant discriminant&lt;ref name=chou01/&gt;  to calculate the similarity of two proteins based on their [[amino acid]] compositions, to avoid the divergence problem due to the normalization condition imposed to their 20 constituent components, a dimension-reduced operation is needed by leaving out one of the 20 components and making the remaining 19 components completely independent.  However, which one of the 20 components should be removed? Will the result be different by removing a different component? The same problems also occur when the calculation is based on (20&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''λ'')-D (dimensional) [[pseudo amino acid composition]], where λ is an integer. 
Generally speaking, to calculate the [[Mahalanobis distance]] or covariant discriminant between two vectors each with Ω normalized components, the dimension-reduced operation is needed and hence the aforementioned problems are always to occur.  To address these problems, the Chou's Invariance Theorem was developed in 1995.

==Essence==
According to the Chou’s invariance theorem, the outcome of the [[Mahalanobis distance]] or covariant discriminant will remain the same regardless of which one of the components is left out. Accordingly, any one of the constituent normalized components can be left out to overcome the divergence problem without changing the final result for [[Mahalanobis distance]] or covariant discriminant.

==Proof==
The rigorous mathematical proof for the theorem was given in the appendix of a paper by Chou, &lt;ref name=chou02/&gt; or appendix E of a review paper by Chou and Zhang &lt;ref name=chou03/&gt;

==Applications==
The theorem has been used in predicting protein subcellular localization,&lt;ref name=pan01/&gt; identifying apoptosis protein subcellular location,&lt;ref name=zhou01/&gt; predicting protein structural classification,&lt;ref name=zhou02/&gt;&lt;ref name=zhou03/&gt; as well as identifying various other important attributes for proteins.

'''Citizen science''' ('''CS'''; also known as '''community science''', '''crowd science''', '''crowd-sourced science''', '''civic science''', '''volunteer monitoring''', or '''networked science''') is [[scientific research]] conducted, in whole or in part, by [[amateur]] (or nonprofessional) [[scientist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gura, Trisha|title=Citizen science: amateur experts|journal=Nature|volume=496|issue=7444|year=2013|pages=259–261|doi=10.1038/nj7444-259a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citizen science is sometimes described as "[[public participation]] in scientific research," [[participatory monitoring]], and [[participatory action research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Hand |first1 = E. |title = Citizen science: People power |doi = 10.1038/466685a |journal = Nature |volume = 466 |issue = 7307 |pages = 685–687 |year = 2010 |pmid = 20686547|pmc =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

The term CS has multiple origins, as well as differing concepts.&lt;ref name="Re&amp;Po"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0963662513497324|title=Citizen science as seen by scientists: Methodological, epistemological and ethical dimensions|author1=H.

A CAISE Inquiry Group Report|journal=Washington, D.C.: Center for Advancement of Informal Science Education (CAISE)|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alan Irwin, a British sociologist, defines CS as "developing concepts of scientific citizenship which foregrounds the necessity of opening up science and science policy processes to the public".&lt;ref name=Re&amp;Po/&gt; Irwin sought to reclaim two dimensions of the relationship between citizens and science: 1) that science should be responsive to citizens' concerns and needs; and 2) that citizens themselves could produce reliable scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rightful Place of Science: Citizen Science|last=Cavalier|first=Darlene|last2=Kennedy|first2=Eric|publisher=Consortium for Science, Policy &amp; Outcomes|year=2016|isbn=9780692694831|location=Tempe, AZ|page=54|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American ornithologist Rick Bonney, unaware of Irwin's work, defined CS as projects in which nonscientists, such as amateur birdwatchers, voluntarily contributed scientific data. This describes a more limited role for citizens in scientific research than Irwin's conception of the term.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The terms ''citizen science'' and ''citizen scientists'' entered the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (''OED'') in June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New words list June 2014|url=http://public.oed.com/the-oed-today/recent-updates-to-the-oed/previous%20updates/june-2014-update/new-words-list-june-2014|publisher=Oxford English Dictionary|accessdate=3 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509083230/http://public.oed.com/the-oed-today/recent-updates-to-the-oed/previous%20updates/june-2014-update/new-words-list-june-2014|archivedate=9 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zoo_OED&gt;{{cite web|title='Citizen science' added to Oxford English Dictionary|url=https://daily.zooniverse.org/2014/09/16/citizen-science-in-dictionary|publisher=The Daily Zooniverse|date=16 September 2014|accessdate=3 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616165001/https://daily.zooniverse.org/2014/09/16/citizen-science-in-dictionary/|archivedate=16 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Citizen science" is defined as "scientific work undertaken by members of the general public, often in collaboration with or under the direction of professional scientists and scientific institutions".&lt;ref name=Zoo_OED/&gt; "Citizen scientist" is defined as: (a) "a scientist whose work is characterized by a sense of responsibility to serve the best interests of the wider community (now rare)"; or (b) "a member of the general public who engages in scientific work, often in collaboration with or under the direction of professional scientists and scientific institutions; an amateur scientist".&lt;ref name=Zoo_OED/&gt; The first use of the term "citizen scientist" can be found in the magazine ''[[New Scientist]]'' in an article about [[ufology]] from October 1979.&lt;ref name=Oberg&gt;{{cite magazine|title=The Failure of the 'Science' of Ufology|author=James Oberg|journal=New Scientist|date=11 October 1979|volume=84|issue=1176|pages=102–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muki Haklay cites, from a policy report for the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars|Wilson Center]] entitled "Citizen Science and Policy: A European Perspective", an alternate first use of the term "citizen science" by R. Kerson in the magazine ''[[MIT Technology Review]]'' from January 1989.&lt;ref name=1stUse&gt;{{cite web|author=Muki Haklay|title=Citizen Science and Policy: A European Perspective|url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/Citizen_Science_Policy_European_Perspective_Haklay.pdf|publisher=Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars|page=11|date=2015|accessdate=3 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018170921/https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/Citizen_Science_Policy_European_Perspective_Haklay.pdf|archivedate=18 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kerson&gt;{{cite magazine|author=R.

A ''"Green Paper on Citizen Science"'' was published in 2013 by the [[European Commission]]'s Digital Science Unit and Socientize.eu, which included a definition for CS, referring to "the general public engagement in scientific research activities when citizens actively contribute to science either with their intellectual effort or surrounding knowledge or with their tools and resources.

Citizen science may be performed by individuals, teams, or networks of volunteers. Citizen scientists often partner with professional scientists to achieve common goals. Large volunteer networks often allow scientists to accomplish tasks that would be too expensive or time consuming to accomplish through other means.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Silvertown|first=Jonathan|title=A new dawn for citizen science|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2009.03.017|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=24|issue=9|pages=467–471|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2009.03.017|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative definitions===

Other definitions for citizen science have also been proposed. For example, Bruce Lewenstein of [[Cornell University]]'s [[Communication studies|Communication]] and [[Science and technology studies|S&amp;TS]] departments describes 3 possible definitions:&lt;ref name=Lewenstein_2004&gt;{{cite web|title=What does citizen science accomplish?|author=B.

* The engagement of nonscientists in true decision-making about policy issues that have technical or scientific components.&lt;ref name=Lewenstein_2004/&gt;
* The engagement of research scientists in the democratic and policy process.&lt;ref name=Lewenstein_2004/&gt;

Further, Muki Haklay offers an overview of the typologies of the level of citizen participation in citizen science, which range from "crowdsourcing" (level 1), where the citizen acts as a sensor, to "distributed intelligence" (level 2), where the citizen acts as a basic interpreter, to "participatory science", where citizens contribute to problem definition and data collection (level 3), to "extreme citizen science", which involves collaboration between the citizen and scientists in problem definition, collection and data analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Haklay, Muki (2012) in Citizen Science and Volunteered Geographic Information: Overview and Typology of Participation. Crowdsourcing Geographic Knowledge. 2013, pp. 105–122.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 [[Mashable]] article defines a citizen scientist as: "Anybody who voluntarily contributes his or her time and resources toward scientific research in partnership with professional scientists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2014/05/26/citizen-science/|title=What Is Citizen Science, and How Can You Get Involved?|author=Eric Larson|date=26 May 2014|work=Mashable|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110231048/http://mashable.com/2014/05/26/citizen-science/|archivedate=10 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the Australian Citizen Science Association released their definition which states "Citizen science involves public participation and collaboration in scientific research with the aim to increase scientific knowledge."&lt;ref name=ACSA_1&gt;{{cite web| title=What is Citizen Science?| url=https://citizenscience.org.au/who-we-are| publisher=Australian Citizen Science Association| access-date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ACSA_2&gt;{{cite web| title=Discover Another Side of Scientific Research| url=https://citizenscience.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Australian-Citizen-Science-Association-brochure.pdf| publisher=Australian Citizen Science Association| access-date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the book "Analyzing the Role of Citizen Science in Modern Research" defined citizen science as "work undertaken by civic educators together with citizen communities to advance science, foster a broad scientific mentality, and/or encourage democratic engagement, which allows society to deal rationally with complex modern problems".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Analyzing the role of citizen science in modern research|author=Ceccaroni, L., &amp; Piera, J.

In a [[Smart City]] era, Citizen Science relays on various web-based tools (eg.[[Web mapping|WebGIS)]] and becomes Cyber Citizen Science.&lt;ref name=WebGIS_1&gt;{{cite journal| title=Citizen science and WebGIS for outdoor advertisement visual pollution assessment| author1=S. Chmielewski| author2=M. Samulowska| author3=M. Lupa| author4=B.

These projects are generally passive. Computation tasks are performed by volunteers' computers and require little involvement beyond initial setup. There is disagreement as to whether these projects should be classified as citizen science.

The astrophysicist and [[Galaxy Zoo]] co-founder [[Kevin Schawinski]] stated: "We prefer to call this [Galaxy Zoo] citizen science because it's a better description of what you're doing; you're a regular citizen but you're doing science. Crowd sourcing sounds a bit like, well, you're just a member of the crowd and you're not; you're our collaborator. You're pro-actively involved in the process of science by participating."&lt;ref name=AnthonyWilliams&gt;{{cite web|title=Crowdsourcing versus citizen science|author=A.

Compared to SETI@home, "Galaxy Zoo volunteers do real work. They're not just passively running something on their computer and hoping that they'll be the first person to find aliens. They have a stake in science that comes out of it, which means that they are now interested in what we do with it, and what we find."&lt;ref name=AnthonyWilliams/&gt;

Citizen policy may be another result of citizen science initiatives. Bethany Brookshire (pen name SciCurious) writes: "If citizens are going to live with the benefits or potential consequences of science (as the vast majority of them will), it's incredibly important to make sure that they are not only well informed about changes and advances in science and technology, but that they also ... are able to ... influence the science policy decisions that could impact their lives."&lt;ref name=SciCur&gt;{{cite web|title=Citizen Science, Citizen Policy|author=SciCurious|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/scicurious-brain/citizen-science-citizen-policy/|publisher=Scientific American|date=7 January 2013|accessdate=23 April 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423064500/https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/scicurious-brain/citizen-science-citizen-policy/|archivedate=23 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits and limitations===

In a research report published by the [[National Park Service]] in 2008, Brett Amy Thelen and Rachel K. Thiet mention the following concerns, previously reported in the literature, about the validity of volunteer-generated data:&lt;ref name=Cape_Cod_CS&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.nps.gov/ParkScience/index.cfm?ArticleID=236&amp;Page=1 |title=Cultivating connection: Incorporating meaningful citizen science into Cape Cod National Seashore's estuarine research and monitoring programs |author1=Thelen, Brett Amy |author2=Thiet, Rachel K. |journal=Park Science |volume=25 |issue=1 |year=2008 |ISSN=1090-9966 |publisher=ParkScience |accessdate=2012-10-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101174310/http://www.nature.nps.gov/ParkScience/index.cfm?ArticleID=236&amp;Page=1 |archivedate=2014-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some projects may not be suitable for volunteers, for instance, when they use complex research methods or require arduous or repetitive work.&lt;ref name=Cape_Cod_CS/&gt;
* If volunteers lack proper training in research and monitoring protocols, they are at risk of introducing bias into the data.&lt;ref name=Cape_Cod_CS/&gt;
* Members may lie about data. This risk is even greater when bounties are awarded as an incentive to participate.&lt;ref name=Cape_Cod_CS/&gt;

The question of data accuracy, in particular, remains open.&lt;ref name="Frías 2018"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frías |first1=O. |last2=Bautista |first2=L. M. |last3=Dénes |first3=F.

M. Gardiner |author2=L. L. Allee |author3=P. M. J. Brown |author4=J. E. Losey |author5=H. E. Roy |author6=R.

In December 2016, authors M. Kosmala, A. Wiggins, A. Swanson and B. Simmons published a study in the journal [[Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment]] called "Assessing Data Quality in Citizen Science".&lt;ref name=ADQ&gt;{{cite journal| author1=Margaret Kosmala| author2=Andrea Wiggins| author3=Alexandra Swanson| author4=Brooke Simmons| title=Assessing Data Quality in Citizen Science| journal=[[Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment]]| volume=14| issue=10| pages=551–560| date=1 December 2016| doi=10.1002/fee.1436}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abstract describes how ecological and environmental CS projects have enormous potential to advance science. Also, CS projects can influence policy and guide resource management by producing [[dataset]]s that are otherwise infeasible to generate.&lt;ref name=ADQ/&gt; In the section "In a Nutshell" (pg3), four condensed conclusions are stated. They are:&lt;ref name=ADQ/&gt;

{{quote frame|
# Datasets produced by volunteer CSs can have reliably high quality, on par with those produced by professionals.
# Individual volunteer accuracy varies, depending on task difficulty and volunteer experience. Multiple methods exist for boosting accuracy to required levels for a given project.
# Most types of [[bias]] found in CS datasets are also found in professionally produced datasets and can be accommodated using existing statistical tools.
# Reviewers of CS projects should look for iterated project design, standardization and appropriateness of volunteer protocols and data analyses, capture of [[metadata]], and accuracy assessment.
}}

They conclude that as CS continues to grow and mature, a key metric of project success they expect to see will be a growing awareness of data quality. They also conclude that CS will emerge as a general tool helping "to collect otherwise unobtainable high-quality data in support of policy and resource management, conservation monitoring, and basic science."&lt;ref name=ADQ/&gt;

A study of Canadian lepidoptera datasets published in 2018 compared the use of a professionally curated dataset of butterfly specimen records with four years of data from a CS program, [[eButterfly]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Semeniuk |first1=Ivan |title=The butterfly effect: How Canadians and their smartphones are helping scientists map species diversity |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/technology/science/article-the-butterfly-effect-how-canadians-and-their-smartphones-are-helping/ |accessdate=13 October 2018 |publisher=The Globe and Mail |date=7 October 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181013040152/https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/technology/science/article-the-butterfly-effect-how-canadians-and-their-smartphones-are-helping/ |archivedate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Soroye |first1=Peter |last2=Ahmed |first2=Najeeba |last3=Kerr |first3=Jeremy T. |title=Opportunistic citizen science data transform understanding of species distributions, phenology, and diversity gradients for global change research |journal=Global Change Biology |date=3 July 2018 |doi=10.1111/gcb.14358 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/gcb.14358 |accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eButterfly dataset was used as it was determined to be of high quality because of the expert vetting process used on the site, and there existed a historic dataset covering the same geographic area consisting of specimen data, much of it institutional.  The authors note that, in this case, CS data provides both novel and complementary information to the specimen data. Five new species were reported from the CS data, and geographic distribution information was improved for over 80% of species in the combined dataset when CS data was included. 

====Law====
{{main article|Wyoming Senate Files 12 and 80 2015 'Trespassing To Collect Data'}}
In March 2015, the state of [[Wyoming]] passed new laws (Senate Files 12 and 80) clarifying that trespassing laws applied even if the trespasser's intention was to gather data to further a U.S. government science program.&lt;ref name=CourthouseNewsService&gt;{{cite web|author=Emma Gannon|title=Wyoming Criminalizes Citizen Science|url=http://www.courthousenews.com/2015/05/18/wyoming-criminalizes-citizen-science.htm|publisher=Courthouse News Service|date=18 May 2015|accessdate=29 December 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160209050810/http://www.courthousenews.com/2015/05/18/wyoming-criminalizes-citizen-science.htm|archivedate=9 February 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hampered some CS researchers who were collecting data while on other people's land.

# Citizen science projects actively involve citizens in scientific endeavour that generates new knowledge or understanding. Citizens may act as contributors, collaborators, or as project leader and have a meaningful role in the project.
# Citizen science projects have a genuine science outcome. For example, answering a research question or informing conservation action, management decisions or environmental policy.
# Both the professional scientists and the citizen scientists benefit from taking part. Benefits may include the publication of research outputs, learning opportunities, personal enjoyment, social benefits, satisfaction through contributing to scientific evidence e.g. to address local, national and international issues, and through that, the potential to influence policy.
# Citizen scientists may, if they wish, participate in multiple stages of the scientific process. This may include developing the research question, designing the method, gathering and analysing data, and communicating the results.
# Citizen scientists receive feedback from the project. For example, how their data are being used and what the research, policy or societal outcomes are.
# Citizen science is considered a research approach like any other, with limitations and biases that should be considered and controlled for. However unlike traditional research approaches, citizen science provides opportunity for greater public engagement and democratisation of science.
# Citizen science project data and meta-data are made publicly available and where possible, results are published in an open access format. Data sharing may occur during or after the project, unless there are security or privacy concerns that prevent this.
# Citizen scientists are acknowledged in project results and publications.
# Citizen science programmes are evaluated for their scientific output, data quality, participant experience and wider societal or policy impact.
# The leaders of citizen science projects take into consideration legal and ethical issues surrounding copyright, intellectual property, data sharing agreements, confidentiality, attribution, and the environmental impact of any activities.

In "Global change and local solutions: Tapping the unrealized potential of citizen science for biodiversity research" by Theobald et al. 2015, the authors surveyed 388 unique biodiversity-based projects.&lt;ref name=Theo&amp;Ett/&gt; Quoting: "We estimate that between 1.36 million and 2.28 million people volunteer annually in the 388 projects we surveyed, though variation is great" and that "the range of in-kind contribution of the volunteerism in our 388 citizen science projects as between $667 million to $2.5 billion annually."&lt;ref name=Theo&amp;Ett/&gt;  

Worldwide participation in citizen science continues to grow.

In 2014, a study was published called "Citizen Science and Lifelong Learning" by R. Edwards in the journal Studies in the Education of Adults.&lt;ref name=CSLL&gt;{{cite journal| title=Citizen Science and Lifelong Learning| author=R.

He continues: "Yet there has been little educational exploration of such projects to date."&lt;ref name=CSLL/&gt; He describes that "there has been limited exploration of the educational backgrounds of adult contributors to citizen science". Edwards explains that CS contributers are referred to as volunteers, citizens or as amateurs. He ends the abstract: "The article will explore the nature and significance of these different characterisations and also suggest possibilities for further research."&lt;ref name=CSLL/&gt;

In the journal Microbiology and Biology Education a study was published by Shah and Martinez (2015) called "Current Approaches in Implementing Citizen Science in the Classroom".&lt;ref name=CurrApp&gt;{{cite journal| title=Current Approaches in Implementing Citizen Science in the Classroom| author1=H.R.

In November 2017, authors Mitchell, Triska and Liberatore published a study in [[PLOS|Public Library of Science]] titled "Benefits and Challenges of Incorporating Citizen Science into University Education".&lt;ref name=Bene&amp;Chall&gt;{{cite journal| title=Benefits and Challenges of Incorporating Citizen Science into University Education| author1=N.

It reports that CS has been used for first year university students as a means to experience research. They continue: "Surveys of more than 1500 students showed that their environmental engagement increased significantly after participating in data collection and data analysis."&lt;ref name=Bene&amp;Chall/&gt; However, only a third of students agreed that data collected by CSs was reliable. A positive outcome of this was that the students were more careful of their own research. The abstract ends: "If true for citizen scientists in general, enabling participants as well as scientists to analyse data could enhance data quality, and so address a key constraint of broad-scale citizen science programs."&lt;ref name=Bene&amp;Chall/&gt;

== History ==

"Citizen science" is a fairly new term but an old practice. Prior to the 20th century, science was often the pursuit of [[gentleman scientist]]s, amateur or self-funded researchers such as Sir [[Isaac Newton]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], and [[Charles Darwin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Silvertown | first1 = J | year = 2009 | title = A new dawn for citizen science | url = | journal = Trends in Ecology and Evolution | volume = 24 | issue = 9| pages = 467–471 | doi=10.1016/j.tree.2009.03.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-20th century, however, science was dominated by researchers employed by universities and government research laboratories. By the 1970s, this transformation was being called into question. Philosopher [[Paul Feyerabend]] called for a "democratization of science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Paul Feyerabend |author-link=Paul Feyerabend |title=Science in a free society |publisher=[[New Left Books]]|location=London |year=1982 |pages= |isbn=0-86091-753-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biochemist [[Erwin Chargaff]] advocated a return to science by nature-loving amateurs in the tradition of [[René Descartes|Descartes]], Newton, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]], and [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]&amp;mdash;science dominated by "amateurship instead of money-biased technical bureaucrats".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Erwin Chargaff |author-link=Erwin Chargaff |title=Heraclitean fire: sketches from a life before nature |publisher=[[Rockefeller University Press]] |location=New York |year=1978 |pages= |isbn=0-87470-029-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study from 2016 indicates that the largest impact of citizen science is in research on biology, conservation and ecology, and is utilized mainly as a methodology of collecting and classifying data.&lt;ref name=kullberg&gt;{{cite journal|author1=C.

===Amateur astronomy===
{{main article|Amateur astronomy}}
[[File:Telescope trailer 22.jpg|right|thumb|250px|upright|Amateur astronomers can build their own equipment and can hold star parties and gatherings, such as [[Stellafane]].]]

Collectively, amateur astronomers observe a variety of celestial objects and phenomena sometimes with [[Amateur telescope making|equipment that they build themselves]]. Common targets of amateur astronomers include the Moon, planets, stars, comets, meteor showers, and a variety of [[deep-sky object]]s such as star clusters, galaxies, and nebulae. Observations of comets and stars are also used to measure the local level of [[skyglow|artificial skyglow]].&lt;ref name="GaN"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kyba|first=Christopher C.

===Butterfly counts===
{{main article|Butterfly count}}
Butterfly counts have a long tradition of involving individuals in the study of butterflies' range and their relative abundance. Two long-running programs are the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (started in 1976) and the [[North American Butterfly Association]]'s Butterfly Count Program (started in 1975).&lt;ref name=UKBMS&gt;{{cite web|title=The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS)|url=http://www.ukbms.org|accessdate=29 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230125155/http://www.ukbms.org/|archivedate=30 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NABA_BCD&gt;{{cite web|author=Leslie Ries|title=Analyzing the NABA Butterfly Count Data|url=http://www.naba.org/pubs/ab141/ab141count_column.pdf|accessdate=29 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223114316/http://www.naba.org/pubs/ab141/ab141count_column.pdf|archivedate=23 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various protocols for monitoring butterflies and different organizations support one or more of transects, counts and/or opportunistic sightings.&lt;ref name=NA_Goal&gt;{{cite web|title=Goal 1: Track all North American butterfly monitoring|url=http://www.nab-net.org/goal-1|accessdate=29 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230133120/http://www.nab-net.org/goal-1|archivedate=30 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[eButterfly]] is an example of a program designed to capture any of the three types of counts for observers in North America.

===Ornithology===
{{main article|Birdwatching}}
Citizen science projects have become increasingly focused on providing benefits to scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;Bonney, R. and LaBranche, M. (2004). Citizen Science: Involving the Public in Research. ASTC Dimensions. May/June 2004, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baretto | first1 = C. | last2 = Fastovsky | first2 = D. | last3 = Sheehan | first3 = P. | year = 2003 | title = A Model for Integrating the Public into Scientific Research | url = | journal = [[Journal of Geoscience Education]] | volume = 50 | issue = 1| pages = 71–75 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCaffrey, R.E. (2005). Using Citizen Science in Urban Bird Studies. Urban Habitats. 3 (1). p. 70-86.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[North American Bird Phenology Program]] (historically called the Bird Migration and Distribution records) may have been the earliest collective effort of citizens collecting ornithological information in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bpp/|title=North American Phenology Program|publisher=|accessdate=30 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729190651/http://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bpp/|archivedate=29 July 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program, dating back to 1883, was started by Wells Woodbridge Cooke. Cooke established a network of observers around North America to collect bird migration records. The [[National Audubon Society|Audubon Society]]'s [[Christmas Bird Count]], which began in 1900, is another example of a long-standing tradition of citizen science which has persisted to the present day.  Citizen scientists help gather data that will be analyzed by professional researchers, and can be used to produce bird population and biodiversity indicators.

Raptor migration research relies on the data collected by the [[hawkwatching]] community. This mostly volunteer group counts migrating accipiters, buteos, falcons, harriers, kites, eagles, osprey, vultures and other raptors at hawk sites throughout North America during the spring and fall seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Bird!": An Exploration of Hawkwatching|last=Wargo|first=Brian M.|publisher=BMW Endeavors, LLC|year=2016|isbn=978-1-945226-00-7|location=McKees Rocks|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The daily data is uploaded to hawkcount.org where it can be viewed by professional scientists and the public.

Such indices can be useful tools to inform management, resource allocation, policy and planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Devictor | first1 = V. | last2 = Whittaker | first2 = R.

"French citizens monitoring ordinary birds provide tools for conservation and ecological sciences". Acta Oecologica-International Journal of
Ecology, 44, 58–66.&lt;/ref&gt; This provides a cost-effective alternative to government monitoring.

Similarly, data collected by citizen scientists as part of BirdLife Australia's has been analysed to produce the first-ever Australian Terrestrial Bird Indices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian birdlife|url=http://birdlife.org.au/state-of-birds|accessdate=30 December 2015|date=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Citizen oceanography ===
The concept of citizen science has been extended to the ocean environment for characterizing ocean dynamics and tracking [[marine debris]]. For example, the mobile app Marine Debris Tracker is a joint partnership of [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] and the [[University of Georgia]].&lt;ref name=MDT&gt;{{cite web| title=Marine Debris Tracker| publisher=Marine Debris Tracker| url=http://www.marinedebris.engr.uga.edu| access-date=19 March 2018| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171227041320/http://www.marinedebris.engr.uga.edu/| archivedate=27 December 2017| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long term sampling efforts such as the [[Continuous Plankton Recorder|continuous plankton recorder]] has been fitted on ships of opportunity since 1931. Plankton collection by sailors and subsequent genetic analysis was pioneered in 2013 by Indigo V Expeditions as a way to better understand marine microbial structure and function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Common Oceanographer: Crowdsourcing the Collection of Oceanographic Data|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001947|journal = PLoS Biol|date = 2014-09-09|pmc = 4159111|pmid = 25203659|pages = e1001947|volume = 12|issue = 9|doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001947|first = Federico M.|last = Lauro|first2 = Svend Jacob|last2 = Senstius|first3 = Jay|last3 = Cullen|first4 = Russell|last4 = Neches|first5 = Rachelle M.|last5 = Jensen|first6 = Mark V.|last6 = Brown|first7 = Aaron E.|last7 = Darling|first8 = Michael|last8 = Givskov|first9 = Diane|last9 = McDougald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Citizen study of coral reefs ===
Citizen science has recently developed in [[Coral reef]] studies. 

[[Underwater photography]] has become more and more popular since the early 2000s, resulting on millions of pictures posted every year on various websites and social media. This mass of documentation is endowed with an enormous scientific potential, as millions of tourists possess a much superior coverage power than professional scientists, who can not allow themselves to spend so much time in the field. 
As a consequence, several participative sciences programs have been developped, supported by geo-localization and identification web sites (such as [https://www.inaturalist.org/ iNaturalist.org]). Another example, the ''Monitoring through many eyes'' project collates thousands of underwater images of the [[Great Barrier Reef]] and provides an interface for elicitation of reef health indicators.&lt;ref name=MTME&gt;{{cite web|title=Monitoring through many eyes project homepage|url=https://www.virtualreef.org.au|publisher=Queensland Government, Queensland University of Technology, CRCSI|accessdate=10 May 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301205255/https://www.virtualreef.org.au/|archivedate=1 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] offers opportunities for volunteer participation. By taking measurements in [[United States National Marine Sanctuary|The United States' National Marine Sanctuaries]], citizens are able to contribute data to a variety of [[marine biology]] projects. By enabling these citizens, [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] benefited from 137,000 hours of research during 2016.&lt;ref name=MTME_2&gt;{{cite web| title=Volunteers help to ensure national marine sanctuaries remain America's underwater treasures for future generations| url=https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/involved/volunteer_future.html| publisher=National Ocean Servi, NOAA, Department of Commerce| accessdate=5 September 2017| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906034716/https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/involved/volunteer_future.html| archivedate=6 September 2017| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There also exist protocols for auto-organization and self-teaching aimed at biodiversity-interested snorkelers, in order for them to turn their observations into sound scientific data, available for research. This kind of approach has been successfully used in [[Réunion island]], allowing for tens of new records and even new species&lt;ref name="CBM2018"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bourjon |first1=Philippe |last2=Ducarme |first2=Frédéric |last3=Quod |first3=Jean-Pascal |last4=Sweet |first4=Michael |year=2018 |title=Involving recreational snorkelers in inventory improvement or creation: a case study in the Indian Ocean |url=http://application.sb-roscoff.fr/cbm/article.htm?execution=e2s1 |journal=Cahiers de Biologie Marine |volume=59 |issue= |pages=451 - 460 |doi=10.21411/CBM.A.B05FC714 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Art history ===
Citizen science has a long tradition in [[Natural science]]. But nowadays, citizen science projects can also be found in various fields of science like [[Art history]]. For example, the [[Zooniverse (citizen science project)|Zooniverse]] project AnnoTate is a transcription tool developed to enable volunteers to read and transcribe the personal papers of British-born and émigré artists.&lt;ref name=AnnoTate&gt;{{cite web|title=AnnoTate homepage|url=https://anno.tate.org.uk|publisher=Zooniverse|accessdate=2 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507142819/https://anno.tate.org.uk/|archivedate=7 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The papers are drawn from the [[Tate Britain|Tate Archive]]. Another example of citizen science in art history is [[Human-based computation game#Artigo|ARTigo]].&lt;ref name=Artigo&gt;{{cite web|title=ARTigo homepage|url=http://www.artigo.org|publisher=ARTigo|accessdate=2 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601154649/http://www.artigo.org/|archivedate=1 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ARTigo collects [[Semantics|semantic]] data on artworks from the footprints left by players of games featuring artwork images. From these footprints, ARTigo automatically builds a [[semantic search]] engine for artworks.

===Modern technology===
Newer technologies have increased the options for citizen science.&lt;ref name=BBC_NewEra&gt;{{cite web|author=Dan Drollette|title=Citizen science enters a new era|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120329-citizen-science-enters-a-new-era?selectorSection=technology|publisher=BBC|date=29 March 2012|accessdate=4 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018015022/http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120329-citizen-science-enters-a-new-era?selectorSection=technology|archivedate=18 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citizen scientists can build and operate their own instruments to gather data for their own experiments or as part of a larger project.

===Seismology===

Since 1975, in order to improve earthquake detection and collect useful information, the [[European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre]] monitors the visits of earthquake eyewitnesses to its website and relies on Facebook and Twitter.&lt;ref name=EMSC&gt;{{cite web| title=EMSC History| url=https://www.emsc-csem.org/about| publisher=The European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre| access-date=16 January 2018| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908143401/https://www.emsc-csem.org/about/| archivedate=8 September 2017| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrology===

Citizen science has been used to provide valuable data in [[hydrology]] (catchment science), notably flood risk, [[water quality]] and [[water resource management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Starkey|first1=Eleanor|last2=Parkin|first2=Geoff|last3=Birkinshaw|first3=Steve|last4=Large|first4=Andy|last5=Quinn|first5=Paul|last6=Gibson|first6=Ceri|title=Demonstrating the value of community-based (‘citizen science’) observations for catchment modelling and characterisation|journal=Journal of Hydrology|date=2017|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169417301646|doi=10.1016/j.jhydrol.2017.03.019|bibcode=2017JHyd..548..801S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Involvement in UK Catchment Management|url=http://www.fwr.org/Catchment/frr0021.pdf|publisher=Foundation for Water Research|accessdate=27 April 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428053522/http://www.fwr.org/Catchment/frr0021.pdf|archivedate=28 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A growth in internet use and smartphone ownership has allowed users to collect and share real-time flood-risk information using, for example, social media and web-based forms. Although traditional data collection methods are well-established, citizen science is being used to fill the data gaps on a local level, and is therefore meaningful to individual communities. It has been demonstrated that citizen science is particularly advantageous during a [[flash flood]] because the public are more likely to witness these rarer hydrological events than scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newcastle University|title=Communities can fill the gaps on flooding|url=http://www.ncl.ac.uk/press/news/2017/04/communityfloodmonitoring/|accessdate=27 April 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428051503/http://www.ncl.ac.uk/press/news/2017/04/communityfloodmonitoring/|archivedate=28 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Africa and South America==

There are many CS projects in [[Africa]] and [[South America]]. Some examples in Africa are:

*In [[South Africa]] (SA), CS projects include: the Stream Assessment Scoring System (miniSASS) which "encourages enhanced catchment management for water security in a climate stressed society."&lt;ref name=SASS&gt;{{cite web|title=Healthy Rivers – Healthy people: Citizen Science for sustainable water management in a climate stressed society|url=http://www.wessa.org.za/what-we-do/water-programme/healthy-rivers-healthy-people.htm|publisher=The Wildlife and Environment Society of South Africa|date=2014|accessdate=20 July 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817021400/http://www.wessa.org.za/what-we-do/water-programme/healthy-rivers-healthy-people.htm|archivedate=17 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In June 2016, citizen science experts from across East Africa gathered in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]] for a symposium organised by the Tropical Biology Association (TBA) in partnership with the Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology (CEH). The aim was "to harness the growing interest and expertise in East Africa to stimulate new ideas and collaborations in citizen science." Rosie Trevelyan of the TBA said: "We need to enhance our knowledge about the status of Africa's species and the threats facing them.  And scientists can't do it all on their own. At the same time, citizen science is an extremely effective way of connecting people more closely to nature and enrolling more people in conservation action".&lt;ref name=TBA_CEH&gt;{{cite web|title=Citizen science takes a leap forward in East Africa|url=http://www.tropical-biology.org/citizen-science-takes-a-leap-forward-in-east-africa|publisher=Tropical Biology Association|date=June 2016|accessdate=20 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160712090949/http://www.tropical-biology.org/citizen-science-takes-a-leap-forward-in-east-africa/|archivedate=12 July 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Within the [[Republic of the Congo]], the territories of an indigenous people have been mapped so that "the Mbendjele tribe can protect treasured trees from being cut down by logging companies". An Android open-source app called Sapelli was used by the Mbendjele which helped them map "their tribal lands and highlighted trees that were important to them, usually for medicinal reasons or religious significance. Congolaise Industrielle des Bois then verified the trees that the tribe documented as valuable and removed them from its cutting schedule. The tribe also documented illegal logging and poaching activities."&lt;ref name=Mb_Sapelli&gt;{{cite web|title=Mapping Indigenous Territories in Africa|url=http://www.esri.com/esri-news/arcnews/winter16articles/mapping-indigenous-territories-in-africa|publisher=Esri|date=2016|accessdate=20 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801073639/http://www.esri.com/esri-news/arcnews/winter16articles/mapping-indigenous-territories-in-africa|archivedate=1 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In West Africa, the irradication of the recent outbreak of [[Ebola virus disease]] was partly helped by CS. "Communities learnt how to assess the risks posed by the disease independently of prior cultural assumptions, and local empiricism allowed cultural rules to be reviewed, suspended or changed as epidemiological facts emerged." "Citizen science is alive and well in all three Ebola-affected countries. And if only a fraction of the international aid directed at rebuilding health systems were to be redirected towards support for citizen science, that might be a fitting memorial to those who died in the epidemic."&lt;ref name=WA_Ebola&gt;{{cite web|title=How black bin bags and common sense helped end an epidemic, and what we can learn from it|author=Paul Richards|url=http://africanarguments.org/2016/05/19/how-black-bin-bags-and-common-sense-helped-end-ebola-and-what-we-can-learn-from-it|publisher=African Arguments|date=19 May 2016|accessdate=20 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630015128/http://africanarguments.org/2016/05/19/how-black-bin-bags-and-common-sense-helped-end-ebola-and-what-we-can-learn-from-it/|archivedate=30 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 2015 the [[Asháninka people]] from Apiwtxa, which crosses the border between [[Brazil]] and [[Peru]], began using the Android app Sapelli to monitor their land. The Ashaninka have "faced historical pressures of disease, exploitation and displacement, and today still face the illegal invasion of their lands by loggers and hunters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5548">[[File:Descartes-1637-b001 (1).jpg|thumb|First page of "La dioptrique" by René Descartes]]
"'''La dioptrique'''" (in English "'''Dioptrique'''", "'''Optics'''", or "'''Dioptrics'''"), is a short treatise published in 1637 included in one of the ''Essays'' written with ''[[Discourse on the Method]]'' by [[Rene Descartes]]. In this essay Descartes uses various models to understand the properties of light. This essay is known as Descartes' greatest contribution to optics, as it is the first publication of the Law of Refraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Osler|first=Margaret J|title=Reconfiguring the World: Nature, God, and Human Understanding from the Middle Ages to Early Modern Europe|year=2010|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, Maryland|isbn=978-0-8018-9656-9|pages=105–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First Discourse: On Light==
[[File:Descartes-1637-b006 (1).jpg|thumb|Page of Descartes' "La dioptrique" with the wine vat example.]]
The first discourse captures Descartes' theories on the nature of [[light]]. In the first model, he compares light to a stick that allows a blind person to discern his environment through touch. Descartes says:
:You have only to consider that the differences which a blind man notes among trees, rocks, water, and similar things through the medium of his stick do not seem less to him than those among red, yellow, green, and all the other colors seem to us; and that nevertheless these differences are nothing other, in all these bodies, than the diverse ways of moving, or of resisting the movements of, this stick. &lt;ref name="Descartes1637"&gt;{{cite book|last=Descartes|first=René|title=Discourse on Method, Optics, Geometry, and Meteorology|year=1637}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Descartes' second model on light uses his [[theory of the elements]] to demonstrate the rectilinear transmission of light as well as the movement of light through solid objects. He uses a metaphor of wine flowing through a vat of grapes, then exiting through a hole at the bottom of the vat.
:Now consider that, since there is no vacuum in Nature as almost all the Philosophers affirm, and since there are nevertheless many pores in all the bodies that we perceive around us, as experiment can show quite clearly, it is necessary that these pores be filled with some very subtle and very fluid material, extending without interruption from the stars and planets to us. Thus, this subtle material being compared with the wine in that vat, and the less fluid or heavier parts, of the air as well as of other transparent bodies, being compared with the bunches of grapes which are mixed in, you will easily understand the following: Just as the parts of this wine...tend to go down in a straight line through the hole [and other holes in the bottom of the vat]...at the very instant that it is open...without any of those actions being impeded by the others, nor by the resistance of the bunches of grapes in this vat...in the same way, all of the parts of the subtle material, which are touched by the side of the sun that faces us, tend in a straight line towards our eyes at the very instant that we open them, without these parts impeding each other, and even without their being impeded by the heavier particles of transparent bodies which are between the two.&lt;ref name="Descartes1637" /&gt;

==Second Discourse: On Refraction==
[[File:Descartes-1637-b011.jpg|thumb|Page of Descartes' "La dioptrique" with the tennis ball example.]]
Descartes uses a tennis ball to create a proof for the laws of [[reflection (physics)|reflection]] and [[refraction]] in his third model. This was important because he was using real-world objects (in this case, a tennis ball) to construct mathematical theory. Descartes' third model creates a mathematical equation for the Law of Refraction, characterized by the angle of incidence equalling the angle of refraction. In today's notation, the law of refraction states,
:: sin ''i'' = ''n'' sin ''r'', where ''i'' is the angle of incidence, ''r'' is the angle of refraction, and ''n'' is the index of refraction. Using a tennis ball, Descartes would compare the projection of a ray of light to the way a ball moves when it is thrown up against another object. 

==Controversy==
The astronomer [[Jean-Baptiste Morin (mathematician)|Jean-Baptiste Morin]] was noted as one of the first people to question Descartes' method in creating his theories.
:...Descartes would not accept Morin's objections that the demonstrations in the ''Dioptric'' are circular or that the proposed explanations are artificial. He grants that 'to prove some effects by a certain cause, then to prove this cause by the same effects', is arguing in a circle; but he would not admit that it is circular to explain some effects by a cause, and then to prove that the cause by the same effects, 'for there is a great difference between ''proving'' and ''explaining'''. Descartes points out that he used the word 'demonstration'...to mean either one or the other 'in accordance with common usage, and not in the particular sense given to it by Philosophers'. Then he adds: 'it is not a circle to prove a cause by several effects which are known otherwise, then reciprocally to prove some other effects by this cause'. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sabra|first=A.I.|title=Theories of Light from Descartes to Newton|year=1981|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0521240948|pages=17–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[hypothesis]] of '''effective evolutionary time'''&lt;ref name="Latitudinal gradients(1992)"&gt;K. Rohde: Latitudinal gradients in species diversity: the search for the primary cause, Oikos, 65, 514-527,1992.&lt;/ref&gt; attempts to explain gradients, in particular latitudinal gradients, in species diversity. It was originally named "time hypothesis".&lt;ref name="Latitudinal gradients(1978a)"&gt;K. Rohde: Latitudinal gradients in species diversity and their causes. I. A review of the hypotheses explaining the gradients. Biologisches Zentralblatt 97, 393-403, 1978a.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Latitudinal gradients(1978b)"&gt;K. Rohde: Latitudinal gradients in species diversity and their causes. II. Marine parasitological evidence for a time hypothesis. Biologisches Zentralblatt 97, 405-418, 1978b.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Low (warm) latitudes contain significantly more species than high (cold) latitudes. This has been shown for many animal and plant groups, although exceptions exist (see [[latitudinal gradients in species diversity]]). An example of an exception is [[helminths]] of marine mammals, which have the greatest diversity in northern temperate seas, possibly because of small population densities of hosts in tropical seas that prevented the evolution of a rich helminth fauna, or because they originated in temperate seas and had more time for speciations there. It has become more and more apparent that species diversity is best correlated with environmental temperature and more generally environmental energy. These findings are the basis of the hypothesis of effective evolutionary time. Species have accumulated fastest in areas where temperatures are highest. [[Mutation rates]] and [[speed of selection]] due to faster physiological rates are highest, and generation times which also determine speed of selection, are smallest at high temperatures. This leads to a faster accumulation of species, which are absorbed into the abundantly available [[vacant niches]], in the tropics. Vacant niches are available at all latitudes, and differences in the number of such niches can therefore not be the limiting factor for species richness. The hypothesis also incorporates a time factor: habitats with a long undisturbed evolutionary history will have greater diversity than habitats exposed to disturbances in evolutionary history.

The hypothesis of effective evolutionary time offers a causal explanation of diversity gradients, although it is recognized that many other factors can also contribute to and modulate them.

==Historical aspects==

Some aspects of the hypothesis are based on earlier studies. [[Bernhard Rensch]],&lt;ref&gt;B. Rensch: Neuere Probleme der Abstammungslehre. Die transspezifische Evolution. Encke, Stuttgart, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; for example, stated that evolutionary rates also depend on temperature: numbers of generation in [[poikilotherm]]s, but sometimes also in homoiotherms ([[homoiothermic]]), are greater at higher temperatures and the effectiveness of selection is therefore greater. Ricklefs refers to this hypothesis as "hypothesis of evolutionary speed" or "higher speciation rates".&lt;ref&gt;R.E. Ricklefs: Ecology. Nelson and Sons, London, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Genera of Foraminifera in the Cretaceous and families of Brachiopoda in the Permian have greater evolutionary rates at low than at high latitudes.&lt;ref&gt;F.G. Stehli, E.G. Douglas and N.D. Newell:  Generation and maintenance of gradients in taxonomic diversity. Science 164, 947-949, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; That mutation rates are greater at high temperatures has been known since the classical investigations of [[Nikolay Timofeev-Ressovsky|Timofeev-Ressovsky]] et al. (1935),&lt;ref&gt;N.W. [[Timofeeff-Ressovsky]], K.G. Zimmer und M. Delbrück: Über die Natur der Genmutation und der Genstruktur. Nachrichten aus der Biologie der Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften Göttingen I, 189-245, 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; although few later studies have been conducted. Also, these findings were not applied to evolutionary problems.

The hypothesis of effective evolutionary time differs from these earlier approaches as follows. It proposes that species diversity is a direct consequence of temperature-dependent processes and the time ecosystems have existed under more or less equal conditions. Since vacant niches into which new species can be absorbed are available at all latitudes, the consequence is accumulation of more species at low latitudes.&lt;ref name ="Latitudinal gradients(1992)"/&gt; All earlier approaches remained without basis without the assumption of vacant niches, as there is no evidence that niches are generally narrower in the tropics, i.e., an accumulation of species cannot be explained by subdivision of previously utilized niches (see also [[Rapoport's rule]]). The hypothesis, in contrast to most other hypotheses attempting to explain latitudinal or other gradients in diversity, does not rely on the assumption that different latitudes or habitats generally have different "ceilings" for species numbers, which are higher in the tropics than in cold environments.  Such different ceilings are thought to be, for example, determined by heterogeneity or area of the habitat. But  such factors, although not setting ceilings, may well modulate the gradients.

==Recent studies==

A considerable number of recent studies support the hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Nonequilibrium Ecology(1992)"&gt;K. Rohde: ''[http://www.cambridge.org/9780521674553 Nonequilibrium Ecology]'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2005b, 223 pp. {{ISBN|0-521-67455-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, diversity of marine [[benthos]], interrupted by some collapses and plateaus, has risen from the Cambrian to the Recent, and  there is no evidence that saturation has been reached.&lt;ref&gt;D.Jablonski: The future of the fossil record, Science 284, 2114-2116, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Rates of diversification per time unit for birds and butterflies increase towards the tropics.&lt;ref&gt;M. Cardillo: Latitude and rates of diversification in birds and butterflies. Proceedings of the Royal Society London 266, 1221-1225,1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Allen et al. found a general correlation between environmental temperature and species richness for North and Central American trees, for amphibians, fish, Prosobranchia and fish parasites. They showed that species richness can be predicted from the biochemical kinetics of metabolism, and concluded that evolutionary rates are determined by generation times and mutation rates both correlated with metabolic rates which have the same Boltzmann relation with temperature. They further concluded that these findings support the mechanisms for latitudinal gradients proposed by Rohde.&lt;ref&gt;A.P. Allen, J.H. Brown, and J.F. Gillooly: Global biodiversity, biochemical kinetics, and the energetic-equivalence rule. Science, 297, 1545-1548, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Gillooly et al. (2002) described a general model also based on first principles of allometry and biochemical kinetics which makes predictions about generation times as a function of body size and temperature.&lt;ref&gt;J.F. Gillooly, E.L. Charnov, G.B. West,  M.Van Savage, and J.H. Brown: Effects of size and temperature on developmental time. Nature 417, 70–73, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical findings support the predictions: in all cases that were investigated (birds, fish, amphibians, aquatic insects, zooplankton) generation times are negatively correlated with temperature. Brown et al.(2004) further developed these findings to a general metabolic theory of ecology.&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Brown, J.F. Gillooly, A.P. Allen, M. Van Savage, and G.. West,. (2004). [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1890/03-9000 Toward a metabolic theory of ecology]. Ecology 85, 1771-1789.&lt;/ref&gt; Indirect evidence points to increased mutation rates at higher temperatures,&lt;ref&gt;C. Bazin, P. Capy, D. Higuet, and T. Langin, T.: Séquences d’AND mobiles et évolution du génome. Pour Sci., Hors. Sér. Janvier 97, 106-109., 1997 (zitiert in. Harmelin-Vivien 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.L. Harmelin-Vivien: Energetics and fish diversity on coral reefs. In: Sale, P.F. Hrsg. Coral reef fishes. Dynamics and diversity in a complex ecosystem.

Ward and M.Yuan: Energy gradients and the geographical distribution of local ant diversity. [[Oecologia]] 140, 407-413, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, computer simulations using the Chowdhury eosystem model have shown that results correspond most closely to empirical data when the number of vacant niches is kept large.&lt;ref&gt;K. Rohde and D. Stauffer: "Simulation of geographical trends in Chowdhury ecosystem model", Advances in Complex Systems 8, 451-464, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Rohde gives detailed discussions of these and other examples.&lt;ref name="Nonequilibrium Ecology(1992)"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. Rohde: Eine neue Ökologie. Aktuelle Probleme der evolutionären Ökologie". Naturwissenschaftliche Rundschau, 58, 420-426, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular importance is the study by Wright et al. (2006) which was specifically designed to test the hypothesis. It showed that molecular substitution rates of tropical woody plants are more than twice as large as those of temperate species, and that more effective [[genetic drift]] in smaller tropical populations cannot be responsible for the differences, leaving only direct temperature effects on mutation rates as an explanation.&lt;ref&gt;S. Wright, J.  Keeling  and L. Gillman 2006.  The road from Santa Rosalia: a faster tempo of evolution in tropical climates. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 103, 7718 –7722.&lt;/ref&gt; Gillman et al. (2009) examined 260 mammal species of 10 orders and 29 families and found that substitution rates in the cytochrome B gene were substantially faster in species at warm latitudes and elevations, compared with those from cold latitudes and elevations. A critical examination of the data showed that this cannot be attributed to gene drift or body mass differentials. The only possibilities left are a Red Queen effect or direct effects of thermal gradients (including possibly an effect of torpor/hibernation differentials). Rohde (1992, 1978) had already pointed out that “it may well be that mammalian diversity is entirely determined by the diversity of plants and poikilothermic animals further down in the hierarchy”, i.e., by a Red Queen effect. He also pointed out that exposure to irradiation including light is known to cause mutations in mammals, and that some homoiothermic animals have shorter generation times in the tropics, which - either separately or jointly - may explain the effect found by Gillman et al.&lt;ref&gt;Gillman, L.N., Keeling, D.J., Ross,H.A. and Wright, S.D. 2009. Latitude, elevation and the tempo of molecular evolution in mammals. Proceedings of the Royal Society B 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Gillman et al. (2010) extended their earlier study on plants &lt;ref&gt;S. Wright, J.  Keeling  and L. Gillman. 2006.  The road from Santa Rosalia: a faster tempo of evolution in tropical climates. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 103, 7718 –7722.&lt;/ref&gt; by determining whether the effect is also found within highly conserved DNA. They examined the 18S ribosomal gene in the same 45 pairs of plants. And indeed, the rate of evolution was 51% faster in the tropical than their temperate sister species. Furthermore, the substitution rate in 18S correlated positively with that in the more variable ITS. These result lend further very strong support to the hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;Gillman L.N., Keeling D.J., Gardner R.C., Wright S.D. Faster evolution of highly conserved DNA in tropical plants. Journal of evolutionary Biology 23, 1327-1330,2010&lt;/ref&gt; Wright et al. (2010) tested the hypothesis on 188 species of amphibians belonging to 18 families, using mitochondrial RNA genes 12S and 16S, and found substantially faster substitution rates for species living in warmer habitats at both lower latitudes and lower elevations.&lt;ref&gt;Wright S.D., Gillman L.N., Ross H.A. and Keeling D.J. Energy and tempo of evolution in amphibians. Global Ecology and Biogeography 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the hypothesis has now been confirmed for several genes and for plants and animals.

Vázquez, D.P. and Stevens, R.D. (2004) conducted a metaanalysis of previous studies and found no  evidence that niches are generally narrower in the tropics than at high latitudes.&lt;ref&gt;Vázquez, D.P. and Stevens, R.D. The latitudinal gradient in niche breadth: concepts and evidence. American Naturalist 164, E1- E19, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be explained only by the assumption that niche space was not and is not saturated, having the capacity to absorb new species without affecting the niche width of species already present, as predicted by the hypothesis.

==Depth gradients==

Species diversity in the deepsea has been largely underestimated until recently (e.g., Briggs 1994: total marine diversity less than 200,000 species).&lt;ref&gt;J. C.Briggs. Species diversity: land and sea compared. Systematic Biology 43, 130-135, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Although our knowledge is still very fragmentary, some recent studies appear to suggest much greater species numbers (e.g., Grassle and Maciolek 1992: 10 million macroinvertebrates in soft bottom sediments of the deepsea).&lt;ref&gt;J F. Grassle and N .J. Maciolek: Deepsea species richness: regional and local diversity estimates from, quantitative bottom samples. American Naturalist 139, 313-341, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies must show whether this can be verified.&lt;ref&gt;K. Rohde: Ecology and biogeography of marine parasites. Advances in marine biology 43,1-86, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; A rich diversity in the deepsea can be explained by the hypothesis of effective evolutionary time: although temperatures are low, conditions have been more or less equal over large time spans, certainly much larger than in most or all surface waters.

'''Emanuel Anthony Posselt''' (1858–1921) was an authority on [[Jacquard loom]]s and weaving. His book on the Jacquard machine is considered to be a classic.&lt;ref name=csbio&gt;[https://www.cs.arizona.edu/patterns/weaving/webdocs/pea_bibl.pdf cs.arizona.edu: "Emanuel Anthony Posselt"], by Ralph E. Griswold&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Posselt, the son of Emanuel Anthony and Elizabeth (Demuth) Posselt, was born in [[Liberec|Reichenberg, Austrian Empire]] (current Liberec, [[Czech Republic]]) on 21 August 1858. Emanuel graduated in 1876 from the [[Imperial Government Weaving School]], also in Reichenberg. During the next two years, he visited most of the important textile manufacturing cities in Europe, and during this time he managed his father's textile mills. In August 1878, he went to the United States, where he worked until 1884 for various textile mills in New England and Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=csbio/&gt;

In 1884, Posselt became the inaugural director of the textile division of [[Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art]]. In 1891, he resigned that position to accept the editorship of the [[Textile Record of North America]], at the time a leading trade journal.&lt;ref name=csbio/&gt;

Posselt then established a private textile academy and a textile trade book business. He published his own work on the Jacquard machine, the technology of textile design, textile calculations, and cotton, wool and silk industries; as well as works by other authors, such as Gardner on wool dyeing.  The series ''Hand Books of the Textile Industry'' and ''Posselt's Textile Library'', as well as ''Posselt's Textile Journal'' that ran between 1907 and 1923, are his own.  The last was the immediate forerunner of [[Textile World]].&lt;ref name=csbio/&gt;

Posselt died in 1921.&lt;ref name=csbio/&gt;

==Family==

Posselt married in July 1884 at [[Colchester, Vermont]] Anna Clera Pollinger, by whom he had three children: Anna (1896), Elwood (1906) and Gertrude (1908).&lt;ref name=csbio/&gt;

'''Enewetak Atoll''' ({{IPAc-en|ɛ|ˈ|n|iː|w|ə|ˌ|t|ɔː|k|,_|ˌ|ɛ|n|ɪ|ˈ|w|iː|t|ɔː|k}};&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Oxford Dictionaries|Eniwetok}}&lt;/ref&gt; also spelled '''Eniwetok Atoll''' or sometimes '''Eniewetok'''; {{lang-mh|Ānewetak}}, {{IPAc-mh|ya|yay|n|yoy|oy|we|wey|ey|T|hah|k}}, or {{lang|mh|Āne-wātak}}, {{IPAc-mh|ya|yay|n|yoy|oy|-|wa|way|ay|T|hah|k}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trussel2.com/MOD/LocA.htm#%C4%80newetak|title=Marshallese-English Dictionary - Place Name Index|website=www.trussel2.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a large [[coral atoll]] of 40 islands in the [[Pacific Ocean]] and with its 850 people forms a legislative district of the [[Ralik Chain]] of the [[Marshall Islands]]. With a [[land area]] total less than {{convert|5.85|km2|sqmi}}, it is no higher than 5 meters and surrounds a deep central [[lagoon]], {{convert|80|km|mi}} in [[circumference]]. It is the second-westernmost atoll of the Ralik Chain and is {{convert|305|km|mi}} west from [[Bikini Atoll]]. 

[[Nuclear testing]] by the [[US]] totaling more than 30 megatons of [[TNT]] took place during the [[cold war]]; in 1977–1980, a concrete dome (the Runit Dome) was built on [[Runit Island]] to deposit [[radioactive]] soil and debris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utaot.com/2013/01/25/the-nuclear-trash-can-of-the-pacific-on-enewetak-atoll|title=Enewetak Atoll – nuclear trash can of the pacific  – UTAOT|website=www.utaot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Runit Dome is deteriorating and could be breached by a typhoon, though the sediments in the lagoon are even more radioactive than those which are contained.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/04/opinion/a-pacific-isle-radioactive-and-forgotten.html A Pacific isle radioactive and forgotten], ''[[The New York Times]]'', Michael B.

== Etymology ==
The [[U.S. government]] referred to the atoll as "Eniwetok" until 1974, when it changed its official spelling to "Enewetak" (along with many other Marshall Islands [[place name]]s, to more properly reflect their [[pronunciation]] by the Marshall Islanders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Barton C. |last=Hacker |title=Elements of controversy : the Atomic Energy Commission and radiation safety in nuclear weapons testing, 1947–1974 |location=Berkeley, CA |publisher=University of California Press |year=1994 |page=14 |isbn=0520083237 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The first European visitor to Enewetak, Spanish explorer [[Alvaro de Saavedra]], arrived on 10 October 1529.{{sfn|Hezel|1983|p=16-17}}&lt;ref&gt;Brand, Donald D. ''The Pacific Basin: A History of its Geographical Explorations'' The American Geographical Society, New York, 1967, p.122&lt;/ref&gt; He called the island "Los Jardines" (The Gardens). In 1794 sailors aboard the British merchant [[sloop]] ''Walpole'' called the islands "Brown's Range" (thus the Japanese name "Brown Atoll"). It was visited by about a dozen ships before the establishment of the German colony of the [[Marshall Islands]] in 1885. With the rest of the Marshalls, Enewetak was captured by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] in 1914 during World War I and mandated to the [[Empire of Japan]] by the [[League of Nations]] in 1920. The Japanese administered the island under the [[South Pacific Mandate]], but mostly left affairs in hands of traditional local leaders until the start of 
World War II. The atoll, together with other part of Marshall Islands located to the west of 164°E, was placed under the governance of Pohnpei district during the Japanese administration period, and is different from rest of Marshall Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teikoku-denmo.jp/history/honbun/dainanyou.html|title=昔はサイパンもパラオも「日本」だった ── 日本の南洋群島統治|website=teikoku-denmo.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1942, the Japanese built an airfield on Engebi Island. As they used it only for refueling planes between [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] and islands to the east, no aviation personnel were stationed there and the island had only 
token defenses. When the [[Gilberts]] fell to the United States, the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] assigned defense of the atoll to the [[1st Amphibious Brigade]], formed from the 3rd Independent Garrison, which had previously been stationed in [[Manchukuo]]. The 1st Amphibious Brigade arrived on January 4, 1944. Some 2,586 of its 3,940 men were left to defend Eniwetok Atoll, supplemented by aviation personnel, civilian employees, and laborers. However, they were unable to finish the fortifications before the American attack came in February. During the ensuing [[Battle of Eniwetok]], the Americans captured Enewetak in a five-day amphibious operation. Fighting mainly took place on Engebi Islet, site of the most important Japanese installation, although some combat occurred on the main islet of Enewetak itself and on Parry Island, where there was a Japanese seaplane base.

Following its capture, the anchorage at Enewetak became a major [[USS Cascade (AD-16)#Service Squadron 4 and Service Squadron 10|forward base]] for the U.S. Navy. The daily average of ships present during the first half of July 1944 was 488; during the second half of July the daily average number of ships at Enewetak was 283.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Worrall Reed.

In 1950, [[John C. Woods]], who executed the Nazi war criminals convicted at the [[Nuremberg Trials]], was accidentally electrocuted here.

After the end of World War II, Enewetak came under the control of the United States as part of the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]] until the independence of the Marshall Islands in 1986. During its tenure, the United States evacuated the local residents many times, often involuntarily.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} The atoll was used for [[nuclear testing]] as part of the [[Pacific Proving Grounds]]. Before testing commenced, the U.S. exhumed the bodies of United States servicemen killed in the Battle of Enewetak and returned them to the United States to be re-buried by their families. Forty-three nuclear tests were fired at Enewetak from 1948 to 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, Sarah and Moltz, James Clay. ''Nuclear Weapons and Nonproliferation: A Reference Book.'' Santa Barbara, Calif.: ABC-CLIO, 2002, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[hydrogen bomb]] test, code-named [[Ivy Mike]], occurred in late 1952 as part of [[Operation Ivy]]; it vaporized the islet of [[Elugelab]]. This test included [[B-17 Flying Fortress]] drones to fly through the [[radioactive fallout|radioactive cloud]] to test onboard samples. B-17 mother ships controlled the drones while flying within visual distance of them. In all 16 to 20 B-17s took part in this operation, of which half were controlling aircraft and half were drones. To examine the explosion clouds of the nuclear bombs in 1957/58 several rockets (mostly from [[rockoon]]s) were launched. One USAF airman was lost at sea during the tests.

[[File:Runit Dome 001.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the [[Runit Dome]]. The dome is placed in the crater created by the "Cactus" nuclear weapons test in 1958.]]
A radiological survey of Enewetak was conducted from 1972 to 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Giff. "Paradise Lost." ''Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.'' December 1980, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, the United States military began [[decontamination]] of Enewetak and other islands. During the three-year, $100 million cleanup process, the military mixed more than {{convert|80000|m3|cuyd}} of contaminated soil and debris&lt;ref name="Schwartz"&gt;Schwartz, Stephen I. ''Atomic Audit: The Costs and Consequences of U.S. Nuclear Weapons Since 1940.'' Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution Press, 1998, p. 380.&lt;/ref&gt; from the islands with [[Portland cement]] and buried it in an atomic blast crater on the northern end of the atoll's [[Runit Island]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, ''Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists'', p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A 15 kiloton nuclear weapon exploded but did not undergo nuclear fission on Runit, scattering plutonium over the island. Runit Island is not habitable for the next 24,000 years, which is why it was chosen for the nuclear waste repository. See: Wargo, John. ''Green Intelligence: Creating Environments That Protect Human Health.'' New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 2009, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The material was placed in the {{convert|9.1|m|ft|adj=on}} deep, {{convert|110|m|ft|adj=on}} wide crater created by the May 5, 1958, "[[Operation Hardtack I|Cactus]]" nuclear weapons test. A dome composed of 358 concrete panels, each {{convert|46|cm|in}} thick, was constructed over the material. The final cost of the cleanup project was $239 million.&lt;ref name="Schwartz" /&gt; The United States government declared the southern and western islands in the atoll safe for habitation in 1980,&lt;ref&gt;The government said that the northern islands would not be safe for inhabitation until 2010. See: Johnson, ''Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; and residents of Enewetak returned that same year.&lt;ref&gt;Linsley, Gordon.

Les Ulis: EDP Sciences, 2004, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;  The military members who participated in that cleanup mission are suffering from many health issues, but the U.S. Government is refusing to provide health coverage. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Dave|last=Philipps|title=Troops Who Cleaned Up Radioactive Islands Can’t Get Medical Care|work=The New York Times|date=Jan 28, 2017|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/troops-radioactive-islands-medical-care.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 177 of the 1983 Compact of Free Association between the governments of the United States and the Marshall Islands&lt;ref&gt;The Compact was ratified by both nations in 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; establishes a process for Marshallese to make a claim against the United States government as a result of damage and injury caused by nuclear testing. That same year, an agreement was signed to implement Section 177 which established a $150 million trust fund. The fund was intended to generate $18 million a year, which would be payable to claimants on an agreed-upon schedule. If the $18 million a year generated by the fund was not enough to cover claims, the [[principal (finance)|principal]] of the fund could be used.&lt;ref&gt;Louka, Elli. ''Nuclear Weapons, Justice and the Law.'' Northampton, Mass.: Edward Elgar, 2011, p. 161-162.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graham"&gt;[http://www.yokwe.net/index.php?module=News&amp;func=display&amp;sid=2591 Graham, Bill.

United States House of Representatives. May 20, 2010.] Accessed 2012-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Marshall Islands]] [[Nuclear Claims Tribunal]] was established to adjudicate claims. In 2000, the tribunal made a compensation award to the people of Enewetak consisting of $107.8 million for environmental restoration; $244 million in damages to cover economic losses caused by loss of access and use of the atoll; and $34 million for hardship and suffering.&lt;ref name="Graham" /&gt; In addition, as of the end of 2008, another $96.658 million in individual damage awards were made. Only $73.526 million of the individual claims award has been paid, however, and no new awards were made between the end of 2008 and May 2010.&lt;ref name="Graham" /&gt; Due to stock market losses, payments rates that have outstripped fund income, and other issues, the fund was nearly exhausted as of May 2010 and unable to make any additional awards or payments.&lt;ref name="Graham" /&gt; A lawsuit by Marshallese arguing that "changed circumstances" made Nuclear Claims Tribunal unable to make just compensation was dismissed by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Richey |first=Warren |title=Supreme Court: No Review of Award for US Nuclear Weapons Tests |work=''Christian Science Monitor'' |date=April 5, 2010 |url=https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2010/0405/Supreme-Court-No-review-of-award-for-US-nuclear-weapons-tests}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 2000 environmental restoration award included funds for additional cleanup of radioactivity on Enewetak. Rather than scrape the topsoil off, replace it with clean topsoil, and create another radioactive waste repository dome at some site on the atoll (a project estimated to cost $947 million), most areas still contaminated on Enewetak were treated with [[potassium]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Cesium]], which is highly radioactive, is chemically similar to potassium. Since the atoll is deficient in potassium, plants absorb cesium from the ground instead. This makes the plants inedible. Cesium also is deposited in the muscles of the human body, just as potassium is. See: {{cite book |last=Firth |first=Stewart |title=Nuclear Playground |location=Honolulu |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |year=1987 |page=36 |isbn=0824811445 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soil that could not be effectively treated for human use was removed and used as fill for a [[causeway]] connecting the two main islands of the atoll (Enewetak and Parry). The cost of the potassium decontamination project was $103.3 million.&lt;ref name="Graham" /&gt;

It is projected that the majority of the atoll will be fit for human habitation by the year 2026–2027 after nuclear decay, de-contamination and [[environmental remediation]] efforts create sufficient dose reductions.&lt;ref name="wlstorage.net"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wlstorage.net/file/crs/RL33029.pdf |title=Loss-of-Damages From U.S. Nuclear Testing in the Marshall Islands: Technical Analysis of the Nuclear Claims Tribunal Methodology and Alternative Estimate}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in November 2017, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] reported that rising sea levels caused by climate change are seeping inside the dome, causing radioactive material to leak out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Willacy|first=Mark|title=A poison in tour island|work=ABC|date=November 27, 2017|accessdate=November 27, 2017|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-11-27/the-dome-runit-island-nuclear-test-leaking-due-to-climate-change/9161442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eniwetok Airfield==
{{distinguish|Enewetak Auxiliary Airfield}}
Men from the [[Seebee|110th Naval Construction Battalion]] arrived on Eniwetok between 21 and 27 February 1944 and began clearing the island for construction of a bomber airfield. A {{convert|2100|m|ft|adj=on}} by {{convert|120|m|ft|adj=on}} runway with taxiways and supporting facilities was built. The first plane landed on 11 March. By 5 April the first operational bombing mission was conducted.{{sfn|Bureau of Yards and Docks|1947|p=325}}
The base was later named for Lieutenant [[John H. Stickell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carey|first=Alan|title=The Reluctant Raiders: The Story of United States Navy Bombing Squadron VB/VPB-109 During World War II |publisher=Schiffer Publishing|year=1999|isbn=9780764307577|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morison |first=Samuel|title=History of United States Naval Operations in World War II.

The airstrip is now abandoned and its surface partially covered by sand.

==Parry Island seaplane base==
The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] had developed a seaplane base on Parry Island. Following its capture on 22 February, Seebees from the 110th Naval Construction Battalion expanded the base, building a coral-surfaced parking area and shops for minor aircraft and engine overhaul. A marine ways was installed on a Japanese pier and boat-repair shops were also erected.{{sfn|Bureau of Yards and Docks|1947|p=325}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17955">'''Expectancy-value theory''' has been developed in many different fields including education, health, communications, marketing and economics. Although the model differs in its meaning and implications for each field, the general idea is that there are expectations as well as values or beliefs that affect subsequent behavior.

==Education model==

===History and model overview===
[[John William Atkinson]] developed the expectancy-value theory in the 1950s and 1960s in an effort to understand the achievement motivation of individuals.&lt;ref name="Eccles1983"&gt;Eccles, J. (1983). Expectancies, values, and academic behaviors. In J. T. Spence (Ed.), Achievement and achievement motives: Psychological and sociological approaches (pp. 75-146). San Francisco, CA: W. H. Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, [[Jacquelynne Eccles]] expanded this research into the field of education.&lt;ref name="Eccles1983" /&gt; According to expectancy-value theory, students' achievement and achievement related choices are most proximally determined by two factors,&lt;ref name="Eccles1983" /&gt; expectancies for success, and subjective task values. Expectancies refer to how confident an individual is in his or her ability to succeed in a task whereas task values refer to how important, useful, or enjoyable the individual perceives the task. Theoretical&lt;ref name="Eccles1983"/&gt;  and empirical;&lt;ref name="Nagengast2011"&gt;Nagengast, B., Marsh, H. W., Scalas, L. F., Xu, M. K., Hau, K. T., &amp; Trautwein, U. (2011). Who took the "×" out of expectancy-value theory? A psychological mystery, a substantive-methodological synergy, and a cross-national generalization. Psychological Science, 22(8), 1058-1066.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trautwein2012"&gt;Trautwein, U., Marsh, H. W., [[Nagengast, B.]], Lüdtke, O., Nagy, G., &amp; Jonkmann, K. (2012). Probing for the multiplicative term in modern expectancy–value theory: A latent interaction modeling study. Journal of educational psychology, 104(3), 763-777.&lt;/ref&gt; work suggests that expectancies and values interact to predict important outcomes such as engagement, continuing interest, and academic achievement.  Other factors, including demographic characteristics, [[Stereotype|stereotypes]], prior experiences, and perceptions of others' beliefs and behaviors affect achievement related outcomes indirectly through these expectancies and values. This model has most widely been applied and used in research in the field of education.

===Expectancies===
Expectancies are specific beliefs individuals have regarding their success on certain tasks they will carry out in the short-term future or long-term future.&lt;ref name="EcclesWig2002"&gt;Eccles, J. S. &amp; Wigfield, A. (2002). Motivational beliefs, values, and goals. Annual Review of Psychology, 53, 109-132.&lt;/ref&gt; The expectancies an individual has shaped their behaviors as well as the choices they make. For example, a high school student might believe that they really struggle on standardized tests. This leads them to expect that they will perform poorly on the SAT. These beliefs then impact their actual performance on the SAT. These expectancies are tied to concepts such as self-concept and self-efficacy. [[Self-concept]] is a broad concept that involves one's beliefs about their own abilities to reach their goals.&lt;ref name="BongSkaalvik203"&gt;Bong, M. &amp; Skaalvik, E.M. (2003). Academic self-concept and self-efficacy: How different are they really?. ''[[Educational Psychology Review]]'', 15(1), 1-40.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Self-efficacy]] is similar in an academic context, because it involves one's beliefs about their abilities and competence; however, it is specific to certain domains, such as math and history.&lt;ref name="BongSkaalvik203"/&gt;

===Subjective task values===

According to Eccles and colleagues&lt;ref name="Eccles1983"/&gt; subjective task value can be thought of the motivation that allows an individual to answer the question "Do I Want to do This Activity and Why?"&lt;ref name="WigCam2010A"&gt;Wigfield. A., Cambria. J., "Student's achievement values, goal orientations, and interest: Definitions, development, and relations to achievement outcomes, " ''Developmental Review'' 30, 2010, 1-35.&lt;/ref&gt; Subjective task values can be broken into four subcategories:&lt;ref name="Eccles1983"/&gt; Attainment Value (Importance for identity or self), Intrinsic Value (Enjoyment or Interest), Utility Value (Usefulness or Relevance), and Cost(loss of time, overly-high effort demands, loss of valued alternatives, or negative psychological experiences such as stress). Traditionally, attainment value and intrinsic value are more highly correlated. What's more, these two constructs tend to be related to intrinsic motivation, interest, and task persistence.&lt;ref name="Hulleman2008"&gt;Hulleman, C. S., Durik, A. M., Schweigert, S. B., &amp; Harackiewicz, J. M. (2008). Task values, achievement goals, and interest: An integrative analysis. Journal of Educational Psychology, 100(2), 398-416&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, utility value has both intrinsic and extrinsic components.&lt;ref name="SD&amp;W2004"&gt;Simons, J., Dewitte, S., &amp; Lens, W. (2004). The role of different types of instrumentality in motivation, study strategies, and performance: know why you learn, so you'll know what you learn! The British journal of educational psychology, 74(Pt 3), 343-60. doi:10.1348/0007099041552314&lt;/ref&gt; and has been related to both intrinsic and extrinsic outcomes such as course performance and interest.&lt;ref name="H&amp;H2009"&gt;Hulleman, C. S., &amp; Harackiewicz, J. M. (2009). Promoting interest and performance in high school science classes. Science, 326(5958), 1410-1412&lt;/ref&gt; Other research shows that utility value has time-dependent characteristics as well.&lt;ref name="H&amp;L1999"&gt;Husman, J., &amp; Lens, W. (1999). The role of the future in student motivation. Educational Psychologist, 34(2), 113-125&lt;/ref&gt; Cost has been relatively neglected in the empirical research;&lt;ref name="WigCam2010A"/&gt; however, the construct has received some attention more recently.&lt;ref name="Luttrell2010"&gt;Luttrell, V. R., Callen, B. W., Allen, C. S., Wood, M. D., Deeds, D. G., &amp; Richard, D. C. (2010). The mathematics value inventory for general education students: Development and initial validation. Educational and Psychological measurement, 70(1), 142-160.&lt;/ref&gt; Feather combined subjective task values with more universal human values&lt;ref name="WE&amp;T2004"&gt;Wigfield, A., Tonks, S., &amp; Eccles, J. S. (2004). Expectancy-value theory in cross-cultural perspective. In D. M. McInerney &amp; S. Van Etten (Eds.), Research on sociocultural influences on motivation and learning, volume 4: Big theories revisited (pp. 165-198). Greenwich, CT: Information Age Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; and suggested that the former are just one type of general human motives that help to direct behavior.

===Applications===

====Developmental trajectories====
Researchers have found that expectancies and values can be distinguished as separate types of motivation as early as 6 years old.&lt;ref name="WigCam2010B"&gt;Wigfield, A., &amp; Cambria, J. (2010). Expectancy-value theory: Retrospective and prospective. Advances in motivation and achievement, 16, 35-70&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, types of value (e.g., attainment vs. utility) can be distinguished within an academic domain as early as fifth grade.&lt;ref name = "WigCam2010B"/&gt; Generally speaking, Eccles and colleagues&lt;ref name="Eccles1983" /&gt; implicate a wide array of different factors that determine an individual's expectancies and values, including: 
* the cultural milieu
* socializer's beliefs and behaviors
* differential aptitudes of the individual
* previous achievement-related experiences
* individual perceptions of social beliefs
* individual's interpretations of experiences
* affective memories
* general goals
* self-concepts
Experts agree that student motivation tends to decline throughout their time in school.&lt;ref name="EcclesWig2002"/&gt; Longitudinal research has confirmed this general trend of motivational decline and also demonstrated that motivation is domain specific.&lt;ref name="Jacobs2002"&gt;Jacobs, J. E., Lanza, S., Osgood, D. W., Eccles, J. S., &amp; Wigfield, A. (2002). Changes in children's self-competence and values: Gender and domain differences across grades one through twelve. Child development, 73(2), 509-527&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have also demonstrated that there are gender differences in motivation.&lt;ref name="Eccles1983"/&gt; Motivation decline is particularly steep for Math achievement, but less so for reading or sports domains among both boys and girls.&lt;ref name="Jacobs2002"/&gt; Researchers offer two general explanations for these declines in motivation.&lt;ref name="WE&amp;T2004"/&gt; The first is that students' conceptualizations of different domains become more complex and nuanced—they differentiate between subdomains, which results in an appearance of mean-level decrease. In fact, children as young as 11 years old have demonstrated that they can differentiate between academic domains.&lt;ref name="WigCam2010B"/&gt; The second is that the focus of their environment changes as they age. As students reach higher grades, the focus shifts from learning to achievement. In fact, a large body of research exists showing that shifts from learning to performance as an educational focus can be detrimental to student motivation.&lt;ref name="Hulleman2010"&gt;Hulleman, C. S., Schrager, S. M., Bodmann, S. M., &amp; Harackiewicz, J. M. (2010). A meta-analytic review of achievement goal measures: Different labels for the same constructs or different constructs with similar labels?. Psychological bulletin, 136(3), 422.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Interventions====
Expectancy-value theory constructs can and have been applied to intervention programs that strive to change motivational beliefs. These interventions are able to increase expectancy&lt;ref name ="Blackwell2007"&gt;Blackwell, L. S., Trzesniewski, K. H., &amp; Dweck, C. S. (2007). Implicit theories of intelligence predict achievement across an adolescent transition: A longitudinal study and an intervention. Child development, 78(1), 246-263.&lt;/ref&gt; and value&lt;ref name = "Hulleman2010"/&gt; or decrease cost.&lt;ref name = "R&amp;B2011"&gt;Ramirez, G., &amp; Beilock, S. L. (2011). Writing about testing worries boosts exam performance in the classroom. science, 331(6014), 211-213.&lt;/ref&gt; Such interventions not only target motivation, but also ultimately increase general student achievement and help to close traditionally problematic achievement gaps.&lt;ref name = "H&amp;H2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Good2003"&gt;Good, C., Aronson, J., &amp; Inzlicht, M. (2003). Improving Adolescents' Standardized Test Performance: An Intervention to Reduce the Effects of Stereotype Threat. Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology, 24, 645-662.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, value- focused interventions have been developed to help teachers design their curriculum in ways that allow students to see the connections between the material they learn in the classroom and their own lives.&lt;ref name="H&amp;H2009"/&gt; Promoting interest and performance in high school science classes.&lt;ref name ="H&amp;H2009"/&gt; This intervention is able to boost student's performance and interest, particularly for students who have low initial expectancy. According to the expectancy-value theory, this intervention is effective because it increases students interest in the material.&lt;ref name="H&amp;H2009"/&gt;

==Psychology, health, communications, marketing, and economics model==
Expectancy-value theory was originally created in order to explain and predict individual's attitudes toward objects and actions. Originally the work of [[psychologist]] [[Martin Fishbein]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}, the [[theory]] states that attitudes are developed and modified based on assessments about beliefs and values. Primarily, the theory attempts to determine the [[Mind|mental]] [[calculation]]s that take place in attitude development. Expectancy-value theory has been used to develop other theories and is still utilized today in numerous fields of study.

===History===
Dr. Martin Fishbein is credited with developing the expectancy-value theory (EVT) in the early to mid-1970s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} It is sometimes referred to as Fishbein's expectancy-value theory or simply expectancy-value model. The primary work typically cited by scholars referring to EVT is Martin Fishbein and [[Icek Ajzen]]'s 1975 book called ''Belief, Attitude, Intention, and Behavior: An Introduction to Theory and Research''. The seed work of EVT can be seen in Fishbein's doctoral dissertation, ''A Theoretical and Empirical Investigation of the Interrelation between Belief about an Object and the Attitude toward that Object'' (1961, UCLA) and two subsequent articles in 1962 and 1963 in the journal ''Human Relations''. Fishbein's work drew on the writings of researchers such as Ward Edwards, [[Milton J. Rosenberg]], Edward Tolman, and [[John B. Watson]].

===Concepts===
EVT has three basic components. First, individuals respond to novel information about an item or action by developing a belief about the item or action. If a belief already exists, it can and most likely will be modified by new information. Second, individuals assign a value to each attribute that a belief is based on. Third, an expectation is created or modified based on the result of a calculation based on beliefs and values. For example, a student finds out that a professor has a reputation for being humorous. The student assigns a positive value to humor in the classroom, so the student has the expectation that their experience with the professor will be positive. When the student attends class and finds the professor humorous, the student calculates that it is a good class. EVT also states that the result of the calculation, often called the "attitude", stems from complex equations that contain many belief/values pairs. Fishbein and Ajzen (1975) represented the theory with the following equation where attitudes (a) are a factorial function of beliefs (b) and values (v).

Theory of Reasoned Action:
Formula
In its simplest form, the TRA can be expressed as the following equation:
&lt;math&gt;BI {{=}} (AB)W_1 + (SN)W_2&lt;/math&gt;

where:
&lt;math&gt;BI&lt;/math&gt; = behavioral intention

&lt;math&gt;(AB)&lt;/math&gt; = one's attitude toward performing the behavior

&lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; = empirically derived weights

&lt;math&gt;SN&lt;/math&gt; = one's subjective norm related to performing the behavior

(Source: Hale, 2002)

===Current usage===
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Fishbein and Ajzen expanded expectancy-value theory into the [[theory of reasoned action]] (TRA). Later Ajzen posited the [[theory of planned behavior]] (TPB) in his book ''Attitudes, Personality, and Behavior'' (1988). Both TRA and TPB address predictive and explanatory weaknesses with EVT and are still prominent theories in areas such as health communication research, marketing, and economics. Although not used as much since the early 1980s, EVT is still utilized in research within fields as diverse as audience research (Palmgreen &amp; Rayburn, 1985) advertising (Shoham, Rose, &amp; Kahle 1998; Smith &amp; Vogt, 1995), child development (Watkinson, Dwyer, &amp; Nielsen, 2005), education (Eklof, 2006; Ping, McBride, &amp; Breune, 2006), health communication (Purvis Cooper, Burgoon, &amp; Roter, 2001; Ludman &amp; Curry, 1999), and organization communication (Westaby, 2002).

The '''Finnish-Russian University Cooperation in Telecommunication''' ('''FRUCT''') is an independent [[open innovation|Open Innovation]] Association developing [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] [[R&amp;D]] ecosystem of Russia and Finland. In the beginning association was oriented on technologies of [[Nokia]] corporation. Association is known for its educational and R&amp;D activities focused on improvement of the innovation ecosystem of Russia and Finland, competitiveness of the graduate students and development of cooperation between universities and industrial research groups.

== History ==
History of FRUCT Association started in 2007 when Sergey Balandin (Principal Scientist of [[Nokia Research Center]]), Eugeny Krouk (Professor of [[Saint Petersburg State University of Aerospace Instrumentation]]) and Jarkko Paavola (Professor of [[University of Turku]]) agreed to create joint work group to increase relevance and quality of students' research by involving [[IT and ICT]] experts from academia and industry to supervision of the projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fruct.org Main web resource of FRUCT Association]&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning FRUCT attracted attention of the regional media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hotuser.ru/forstudents/1403--fruct FRUCT Association overview article in Informatization and Education online journal]&lt;/ref&gt; The first seminar of the work group&lt;ref&gt;[http://fruct.ru/seminar1 Web page of the 1st FRUCT seminar]&lt;/ref&gt; was held in [[St. Petersburg]] in May 2007, where the group was reorganized into the independent informal open innovations community. FRUCT Association is voluntary community that combines R&amp;D forces of its members using [[Communities of Innovation|Open Innovations]] principles to create critical mass of competences and world-class competitive results.&lt;ref&gt;[http://habrahabr.ru/post/55644/ FRUCT initiative — general description] // HabraHabr {{ref-ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Nowadays more than twenty teams from universities of Russia, Finland, Ukraine and Denmark, [[:ru:СПИИРАН|Research Institute of RAS]], [[Nokia]], [[Nokia Siemens Networks]] have joined FRUCT Association. The Association is represented and managed by companies FRUCT LLC (Russia) and FRUCT Oy (Finland). FRUCT Association is an official partner of [[IEEE Communications Society]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://host.comsoc.org/sistersocieties/fruct/index.html List of IEEE Communications Society partner organizations, web site IEEE] at IEEE Communications Society&lt;/ref&gt; and a member of [[European Connected Health Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.echalliance.com/membership.asp?PageId=123&amp;id=123 European Connected Health Alliance Partners List]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
FRUCT Association is an incubator of competences and new businesses developed in research cooperation of universities and industry. The main aim of FRUCT projects is gradual establishment of cooperation and long-term partnership between the member teams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spbit.ru/news/n46404/ Nokia highlighted in St. Petersburg. Initiatives WidSets and FRUCT] // SPbIT {{ref-ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; FRUCT Association actively involves in research process undergraduates and PhD students,&lt;ref&gt;[http://habrahabr.ru/post/55644/ Initiative FRUCT — general description] // Studying process in IT — HabraHabr {{ref-ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; helps in formation of research communities in IT and ICT areas and promotes prestige of research career among young people. In most of FRUCT projects undergraduates and PhD students are the main developers, who solve problems with help and supervision of academia and industrial experts.&lt;br /&gt;
The set of activities is targeted to create the complete innovation cycle for competence and business development. The cycle starts by identification of the most promising research topics based on public information about long-term research vision and priorities of industrial leaders. Depending on the problem scale and long-team importance of the topic, FRUCT creates working group or project team to address it. Each group and project team is formed as a distributed R&amp;D consortium with clear definition of member roles. The teams solve scientific and technological tasks based on own vision and industrial requests. Administratively project team members belong to regional FRUCT laboratories. FRUCT laboratories are organized at regional FRUCT universities. Most of the laboratory members are official employees of universities, which most of time working for FRUCT projects. After the required level of competences is gained the team either organizes innovation startup or start large research project by using regional and cross-border grants.

=== Support of research ===

Ideas of FRUCT projects can be originated by university professors and industrial experts. In this case the project initiator takes obligation to be the project supervisor. Also undergraduate and PhD students can propose topics of new projects. Student proposals are reviewed and commented by FRUCT advisory board. The preference is given to proposals that have large R&amp;D potential and project targeted in development of practical applications and innovative software-hardware solutions. For approved proposals FRUCT appoints supervisors and scientific advisors.&lt;br /&gt;
Accepted FRUCT projects can apply for support to cover part of direct implementation expenses, e.g., traveling to conferences, books, purchases of hardware, etc. The best students are recommended to take part in various contests, grant and scholarship programs, etc.
The project progress should be presented twice a year at FRUCT conferences. Project progress update consists of a report in form of conference paper, presentation and training or demo when applicable. As a result of each project at least one paper should be published in the proceedings of an international conference or journal. FRUCT conference has its own proceedings and the best papers from them are recommended for IEEE and journals publication. In addition, for papers accepted to publication in the recommended conferences, the main student author can apply for a grant to cover related travel expenses. Such travel grants are provided by FRUCT industrial members, e.g., Nokia Corporation.

=== Support of education ===
[[File:FRUCT SPb GUAP 2008.jpg|thumb|Openining of 3rd FRUCT conference, St. Petersburg, [[Saint Petersburg State University of Aerospace Instrumentation]], 2008]]
Actualization and renewal of education is the key priority of FRUCT association. Association regularly organizes open free of charge conferences, trainings and special courses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fruct.org/pastevents List of the past FRUCT events]&lt;/ref&gt; The main FRUCT conferences are organized twice a year - in the last week of April (in Russia) and second week of November (in Finland). The conference program consists of technological trainings, lectures of world-class IT and ICT experts, reports of FRUCT teams and demos of developed solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petrsu.ru/news.html?action=single&amp;id=4720 9th FRUCT conference in PetrSU] // PetrSU&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mit.spbau.ru/node/212 AU Students' participation in FRUCT] // SPbAU RAS&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.russoft.ru/news/2012/2/27 Finnish-Russia conference FRUCT will take place in St.-Petersburg] // Russoft&lt;/ref&gt; The conference length is 5 days, including days for trainings and developer contests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://club.cnews.ru/FRUCT Published FRUCT materials on CNews Club resource] {{ref-ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accepted conference papers are published in proceedings ({{ISSN|2305-7254}}), which are also available for free download at FRUCT site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fruct.org/trainings FRUCT materials available for free download]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
FRUCT organizes free-of-charge winter and summer schools (duration 1–3 weeks). Main topics of the schools are chosen accordingly with the industrial trends and regional FRUCT teams priorities. FRUCT cooperates and is a partner in many international educational programs such as [[PERCCOM]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://perccom.blog.univ-lorraine.fr/partners/associated-partners/companies/ List of Erasmus Mundus PERCCOM program partners]&lt;/ref&gt;
Active academic exchange between association members is used for popularizations of new disciplines and courses, plus organization of open lectures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifmo.ru/event/2179 Open lecture «Finnish-Russian cooperation FRUCT and NordSecMob program» in ITMO] {{ref-ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it is appropriate the academic course is transformed to intensive 3–7 days course. With the help of the industrial partners best students are getting material support to participate in such programs.
FRUCT supporting development of the exchange programs between FRUCT member universities. For example, international master programs in IT field of Tampere University of Technology and Erasmus Mundus NordSecMob of [[:fi:Aalto-yliopisto|Aalto University]].

=== Professional communities ===
FRUCT supports development and coordinates work of 4 professional communities: Russian Mobile Linux Community,&lt;ref&gt;[http://meego.e-werest.org Web site of Russian developers for Mobile Linux] {{ref-ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian Qt community,&lt;ref&gt;[http://qt.e-werest.org Web site of Russian Qt community]&lt;/ref&gt; Regional mobile Healthcare (m-Health) community&lt;ref&gt;[http://mhealth.e-werest.org Web site of the regional mobile Healthcare (m-Health) community] {{ref-ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; and regional [[Internet of Things|IoT]] and Smart Spaces community «Are You Smart».&lt;ref&gt;[http://rusmart.e-werest.org Web site of regional IoT and Smart Spaces community]&lt;/ref&gt;
The network of professional communities is implemented by FRUCT subsidiary E-WeREST (acronym of East-West Research and Education Society on Telecommunications). Regional activities of E-WeREST communities are coordinated by FRUCT labs at [[:ru:Петрозаводский государственный университет|PetrSU]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://oss.fruct.org Web site of FRUCT lab in PetrSU]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saint Petersburg State Electrotechnical University|LETI]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://osll.fruct.org Web site of FRUCT lab in "LETI"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yaroslavl State University|YarSU]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://yar.fruct.org Web site of FRUCT lab in YarSU]&lt;/ref&gt; [[N.

'''Fuzzy mathematics'''  forms a branch of mathematics related to [[fuzzy set theory]] and [[fuzzy logic]]. It started in 1965 after the publication of [[Lotfi Asker Zadeh]]'s seminal work ''Fuzzy sets''.&lt;ref&gt;Zadeh, L. A. (1965) "Fuzzy sets", ''Information and Control'', 8, 338–353.&lt;/ref&gt; A fuzzy subset ''A'' of a set ''X'' is a function ''A:X→L'', where ''L'' is the interval [0,1]. This function is also called a membership function. A membership function is a generalization of a [[Indicator function|characteristic function]] or an [[indicator function]] of a subset defined for ''L'' = {0,1}.  More generally, one can use  a complete lattice ''L'' in a definition of a fuzzy subset ''A''
.&lt;ref&gt;Goguen, J. (1967) "L-fuzzy sets", ''J. Math. Anal. Appl.'', 18, 145-174.&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolution of the fuzzification of mathematical concepts can be broken down into three stages:&lt;ref&gt;Kerre, E.E., Mordeson, J.N. (2005) "A historical overview of fuzzy mathematics", ''[[New Mathematics and Natural Computation]]'', 1, 1-26.&lt;/ref&gt; 
:# straightforward fuzzification during the sixties and seventies,
:# the explosion of the possible choices in the generalization process during the eighties,
:# the standardization, axiomatization and L-fuzzification in the nineties.

Usually, a fuzzification of mathematical concepts is based on a generalization of these concepts from characteristic functions to membership functions. Let ''A'' and ''B'' be two fuzzy subsets of ''X''. 
Intersection ''A''&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;''B'' and union ''A''&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;''B'' are defined as follows: (''A''&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;''B'')(''x'') = min(''A''(''x''),''B''(''x'')), (''A''&amp;nbsp;''∪''&amp;nbsp;''B'')(''x'') = max(''A''(''x''),''B''(''x'')) for all ''x'' ∈ ''X''. Instead of ''min'' and ''max'' one can use [[t-norm]] and t-conorm, respectively 
,&lt;ref&gt;Klement, E.P., Mesiar, R., Pap, E. (2000) ''Triangular Norms''. Dordrecht, Kluwer.&lt;/ref&gt; for example, ''min(a,b)'' can be replaced by multiplication ''ab''. A straightforward fuzzification is usually based on ''min'' and ''max'' operations because in this case more properties of traditional mathematics can be extended to the fuzzy case. 

A very important generalization principle used in fuzzification of algebraic operations is a closure property. Let * be a binary operation on ''X''. The closure property for a fuzzy subset ''A'' of ''X'' is that for all ''x,y'' ∈ ''X'', ''A''(''x''*''y'') ≥ min(''A''(''x''),''A''(''y'')). Let (''G'',*) be a group and ''A'' a fuzzy subset of ''G''. Then ''A'' is a fuzzy subgroup of ''G'' if for all ''x,y'' in ''G'', ''A''(''x''*''y''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;) ≥ min(''A''(''x''),''A''(''y''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;)). 

A similar generalization principle is used, for example, for fuzzification of the transitivity property. Let ''R'' be a fuzzy relation in ''X'', i.e. ''R'' is a fuzzy subset of ''X×X''. Then ''R'' is transitive if for all ''x,y,z'' in ''X'', ''R''(''x'',''z'') ≥ min(''R''(''x'',''y''),''R''(''y'',''z'')).

'''Tudor Harvey Barnett''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|size=100%|sep=,|AO}} (25 December 1925 – 23 June 1995) was an Australian [[intelligence officer]] who was [[Director-General of Security]], the head of the [[Australian Security Intelligence Organisation]] (ASIO), from 1981 to 1985.

==Early life and military service==
Barnett was born in [[Albany, Western Australia]] to a family of shopkeepers. He attended an Anglican boarding school near [[Perth]], and in February 1944 enslisted in the [[Royal Australian Navy]] during [[World War II]]. At the time of his discharge on 29 May 1956, he held the rank of [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] in the [[Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve|RANVR]] Special Branch and was stationed at the shore training base [[HMAS Cerberus (naval base)|HMAS ''Cerberus'']].&lt;ref name=ww2nomroll&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/Veteran.aspx?ServiceId=N&amp;VeteranId=1186648 BARNETT, TUDOR HARVEY], ''World War II Nominal Roll'', Department of Veterans' Affairs, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Barnett returned to university to complete a Bachelor of Arts at the [[University of Western Australia]], where he was a contemporary of future Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]]. He spent some time travelling in Europe where he taught in England and Germany.&lt;ref name=indyobit&gt;{{cite news|last1=Milliken|first1=Robert|title=Obituaries: Harvey Barnett|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituaries-harvey-barnett-1594211.html|accessdate=20 August 2014|work=The Independent|date=1 August 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intelligence work==
On his return to Australia in the mid-1950s, Barnett was recruited into the [[Australian Secret Intelligence Service]] (ASIS), Australia's foreign intelligence agency. He was head of the Australian stations in Singapore, Cambodia and South Vietnam, and later rose to the position of Deputy Director-General of ASIS.&lt;ref name=indyobit /&gt;

In September 1981, Barnett was appointed [[Director-General of Security]]. On 20 April 1983, Barnett requested and was granted an urgent meeting with the newly elected Prime Minister, [[Bob Hawke]], whereupon he briefed him on what he called a 'matter of national security'—ASIO was aware of several meetings between [[David Combe]], the national secretary of the [[Australian Labor Party]], and First Secretary of the Soviet Embassy in Australia, [[Valery Ivanov]]. In what became known as the Combe–Ivanov affair, Hawke resolved to remove any possibility of Combe being recruited by Soviet intelligence. Ivanov was expelled from Australia, and although the second [[Hope Commission|Hope Royal Commission]] in 1984 established that attempts were being made to recruit Combe, no intelligence breaches had taken place.&lt;ref name=combe&gt;{{cite news|last1=D'Alpuget|first1=Blanche|title=The spy who trapped a mate|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/archive/politics/the-spy-who-trapped-a-mate/story-e6frgczf-1225890574398|accessdate=20 August 2014|work=The Australian|publisher=News Limited|date=13 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three years after his 1985 retirement from ASIO, Barnett published his memoirs, ''Tale of the Scorpion'' ({{ISBN|0725105852}}).&lt;ref name=indyobit /&gt;

:''See [[Human migration]]

'''Human migration''' is the movement by people from one place to another with the intention of settling temporarily or permanently in the new location. It typically involves movements over long distances and from one country or region to another. 

Historically, [[early human migration]] includes the [[peopling of the world]], i.e. migration to world regions where there was previously no human habitation, during the [[Upper Paleolithic]]. Since the [[Neolithic]], most migrations (except for the peopling of remote regions such as the [[circumpolar peoples|Arctic]] or the [[Austronesian expansion|Pacific]]), migration was predominantly warlike, consisting of conquest or ''[[Landnahme]]'' on the part of expanding populations. [[Colonialism]] involves expansion of sedentary populations into previously only sparsely settled territories or territories with no permanent settlements. In the [[modern period]], human migration has primarily taken the form of migration [[internal migration|within]] and [[international migration|between]] existing [[sovereign states]], either controlled ([[immigration|legal immigration]]) or uncontrolled and in violation of [[immigration law]]s ([[illegal immigration]]).

Migration can be voluntary or [[Involuntary migration|involuntary]]. Involuntary migration includes [[forced displacement]] (in various forms such as [[deportation]], [[History of slavery|slave trade]], [[Human trafficking|trafficking in human beings]]) and [[Refugee|flight]] ([[war refugees]], [[ethnic cleansing]]).

The pre-modern migration of human populations begins with the movement of ''[[Homo erectus]]'' [[Out of Africa I | out of Africa]] across [[Eurasia]] about 1.75 million years ago. ''[[Human|Homo sapiens]]'' appears to have occupied all of Africa about 150,000 years ago; some members of this species moved out of Africa 70,000 years ago (or, according to more recent studies, as early as 125,000 years ago into [[Asia]],&lt;ref name="SCI-20171208"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Bae |first1= Christopher J. |last2= Douka |first2= Katerina |last3= Petraglia |first3= Michael D. |title= On the origin of modern humans: Asian perspectives |url= http://science.sciencemag.org/content/358/6368/eaai9067 |journal= [[Science (journal) |Science]] |date= 8 December 2017 |volume= 358 |issue= 6368 |page= eaai9067 |doi= 10.1126/science.aai9067 |accessdate= 10 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="QZ-20171210"&gt;Compare: {{cite web |last= Kuo |first= Lily |title= Early humans migrated out of Africa much earlier than we thought |url= https://qz.com/1151816/early-humans-migrated-out-of-africa-much-earlier-than-we-thought/ |date= 10 December 2017 |work= [[Quartz (publication) |Quartz]] |accessdate= 10 December 2017 | quote = According to a study published this week in Science, new discoveries over the last decade have shown that modern humans likely originated from several migrations from Africa that began as early as 120,000 years ago.

Major population-movements notably include those postulated as associated with the [[Neolithic Revolution]] and with [[Proto-Indo-Europeans |Indo-European expansion]]. The Early Medieval [[Migration Period|Great Migrations]] including [[Turkic migration |Turkic expansion]] have left significant traces.

Early humans migrated due to many factors, such as changing climate and landscape and inadequate food-supply. The evidence indicates that the ancestors of the [[Austronesian peoples]] spread from the South Chinese mainland to the [[island of Taiwan]] around 8,000 years ago. Evidence from [[historical linguistics]] suggests that seafaring peoples migrated from Taiwan, perhaps in distinct waves separated by millennia, to the entire region encompassed by the [[Austronesian languages]]. Scholars believe that this migration began around 6,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="nature.com"&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v405/n6790/full/4051052a0.html Language trees support the express-train sequence of Austronesian expansion], [[Nature (journal) |Nature]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indo-Aryan migration]] from the Indus Valley to the plain of the River Ganges in Northern India is presumed{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} to have taken place in the Middle to Late Bronze Age, contemporary with the [[Cemetery H culture |Late Harappan]] phase in India (around 1700 to 1300&amp;nbsp;BC). From 180&amp;nbsp;BC, a series of invasions from [[Central Asia]] followed in the northwestern [[Indian subcontinent]], including those led by the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom |Indo-Greeks]], [[Indo-Scythians]],[[Indo-Parthian Kingdom| Indo-Parthians]] and [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]].&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-46837/India The appearance of Indo-Aryan speakers], [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trivedi"&gt;{{cite news|first= Bijal P|last= Trivedi|title= Genetic evidence suggests European migrants may have influenced the origins of India's caste system|url= http://www.genomenewsnetwork.org/articles/05_01/Indo-European.shtml|work= Genome News Network|publisher= J.

From 728&amp;nbsp;BC, the [[Ancient Greece |Greeks]] began 250 years of expansion, settling [[Colonies in antiquity |colonies]] in several places, including [[Sicily]] and [[Marseille]]. Europe provides evidence of two major migration movements: the [[Celts|Celtic people]]s in the first millennium BC, and the later [[Migration Period]] of the first millennium AD from the North and East. Both may be examples of general cultural change sparked by primarily elite and warrior migration.{{Citation needed|date= April 2011}} A smaller migration (or sub-migration) involved the [[Magyar tribes|Magyars]] moving into [[Pannonia]] (modern-day [[Hungary]]) in the 9th century AD. [[Turkic peoples]] spread from their homeland in modern Turkestan across most of [[Central Asia]] into Europe and the [[Middle East]] between the 6th and 11th centuries AD. Recent research suggests that [[Madagascar]] was uninhabited until [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] seafarers from [[Indonesia]] arrived during the 5th and 6th centuries AD. Subsequent migrations from both the Pacific and Africa further consolidated this original mixture, and [[Malagasy people]] emerged.&lt;ref name="Malagasy languages"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-359466/article-9050264 Malagasy languages], [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the expansion of the [[Bantu languages]] and their speakers, the southern half of Africa is believed to have been populated by [[Pygmies]] and [[Khoisan]]-speaking people, whose descendants today occupy the arid regions around the [[Kalahari Desert]] and the forests of Central Africa. By about 1000&amp;nbsp;AD, Bantu migration had reached modern-day [[Zimbabwe]] and [[South Africa]]. The [[Banu Hilal]] and [[Maqil |Banu Ma'qil]] were a collection of [[Arab]] [[Bedouin]] tribes from the [[Arabian Peninsula]] who migrated westwards via [[Egypt]] between the 11th and 13th centuries. Their migration strongly contributed to the [[Arabisation]] and [[Islamisation]] of the western [[Maghreb]], which was until then dominated by [[Berber people|Berber]] tribes. [[Ostsiedlung]] was the medieval eastward migration and settlement of [[German diaspora |Germans]]. The 13th century was the time of the great [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] and [[Turkic migration]]s across [[Eurasia]].&lt;ref name="Migrations-&amp;-World History"&gt;[http://www.acurioustraveler.com/migrations_&amp;_world_history_p_27.htm Migrations-&amp;-World History]&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the 11th and 18th centuries, numerous migrations took place in Asia. The Vatsayan Priests migrated from the eastern Himalaya hills to [[Kashmir]] during the Shan invasion in the 13th century. They settled in the lower [[Shivalik Hills]] in the 13th century to sanctify the manifest goddess.{{clarify|date= September 2018}} In the Ming occupation, the [[Vietnamese people| Vietnamese]] started expanded southward in the 11th century; this is known in Vietnamese as [[nam tiến]] (southward expansion).&lt;ref name="countrystudies.us"&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/11.htm The Le Dynasty and Southward Expansion]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manchuria]] was separated from [[China proper]] by the Inner [[Willow Palisade]], which restricted the movement of the [[Han Chinese]] into Manchuria during the early [[Qing Dynasty]] (founded in 1636), as the area was off-limits (British English: out of bounds) to the Han until the Qing started colonizing the area with them (late 18th century) later on in the dynasty's rule.&lt;ref name="From Ming to Qing"&gt;[http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~inaasim/Mingqing04/Qing2.htm From Ming to Qing]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Age of Exploration]] and European [[colonialism]] has led to an accelerated pace of migration since Early Modern times. In the 16th century, perhaps 240,000 Europeans entered American ports.&lt;ref name="millersville.edu"&gt;[http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/art/AXTELL01.ART "The Colombian Mosaic in Colonial America" by James Axtell] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091119071952/http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/art/AXTELL01.ART |date= 2009-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century over 50 million people left Europe for the Americas alone.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;David Eltis ''Economic Growth and the Ending of the Transatlantic slave trade''&lt;/ref&gt; The local populations or tribes, such as the [[Indigenous peoples| Aboriginal people]] in Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, Japan&lt;ref name="hurights.or.jp"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
and the United States, were often numerically overwhelmed by incoming [[settler]]s.

==Modern history==
{{see|Modernity}}
===Industrialization===
When the pace of migration had accelerated since the 18th century already (including the involuntary [[History of slavery|slave trade]]), it would increase further in the 19th century. Manning distinguishes three major types of migration: labor migration, refugee migrations, and [[urbanisation|urbanization]]. Millions of agricultural workers left the countryside and moved to the cities causing unprecedented levels of urbanization. This phenomenon began in Britain in the late 18th century and spread around the world and continues to this day in many areas.

[[Industrial Revolution|Industrialization]] encouraged migration wherever it appeared. The increasingly global economy globalized the labour market. The [[Atlantic slave trade]] diminished sharply after 1820, which gave rise to self-bound [[Indentured servant|contract labour]] migration from Europe and Asia to plantations. [[human overpopulation|Overpopulation]],{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} open agricultural frontiers, and rising industrial centres attracted voluntary migrants. Moreover, migration was significantly made easier by improved transportation techniques.

[[Romantic nationalism]] also rose in the 19th century, and, with it, [[ethnocentrism]]. The [[imperialism|great European industrial empires]] also rose. Both factors contributed to migration, as some countries favored their own ethnicity over outsiders and other countries appeared to be considerably more welcoming. For example, the Russian Empire identified with [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], and confined Jews, who were not Eastern Orthodox, to the [[Pale of Settlement]] and imposed restrictions. [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|Violence]] was also a problem. The United States was promoted as a better location, a "golden land" where Jews could live more openly.&lt;ref&gt;See ''World of our Fathers'', by Irving Howe, and particularly the first sixty or so pages of that book&lt;/ref&gt; Another effect of imperialism, [[colonialism]], led to the migration of some colonizing parties from "home countries" to "the colonies", and eventually the migration of people from "colonies" to "home countries".&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[British Pakistanis|people migrated from the Indian subcontinent to the UK during the Imperial era and afterwards]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Transnational labor migration reached a peak of three million migrants per year in the early twentieth century. Italy, Norway, Ireland and the Guangdong region of China were regions with especially high [[emigration]] rates during these years.  These large migration flows influenced the process of nation state formation in many ways. [[List of United States immigration legislation|Immigration restrictions]] have been developed, as well as [[diaspora]] cultures and myths that reflect the importance of migration to the foundation of certain nations, like the American [[melting pot]]. The transnational labor migration fell to a lower level from the 1930s to the 1960s and then rebounded.

The United States experienced considerable [[internal migration]] related to industrialization, including its [[African American]] population. 
From 1910 to 1970, approximately 7 million African Americans migrated from the rural [[Southern United States]], where blacks faced both poor economic opportunities and considerable political and social prejudice, to the industrial cities of the Northeast, Midwest and West, where relatively well-paid jobs were available.&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/545.html Great Migration], accessed 12/7/2007&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon came to be known in the United States as its own [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], although historians today consider the migration to have two distinct phases. The term "Great Migration", without a qualifier, is now most often used to refer the first phase, which ended roughly at the time of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. 
The second phase, lasting roughly from the start of U.S. involvement in World War II to 1970, is now called the [[Second Great Migration (African American)|Second Great Migration]]. With the demise of legalised segregation in the 1960s and greatly improved economic opportunities in the South in the subsequent decades, millions of blacks have returned to the South from other parts of the country since 1980 in what has been called the [[New Great Migration]].

===World wars and aftermath===

[[File:Migrants Suisses de Russie, environ 1921.jpg|thumb|Swiss woman and her children leaving Civil war in Russia, around 1921]]

The First and Second World Wars, and wars, genocides, and crises sparked by them, had an enormous impact on migration. Muslims moved from the Balkan to Turkey, while Christians moved the other way, during the collapse of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In April 1915 the Ottoman government embarked upon the systematic decimation of its civilian Armenian population. The persecutions continued with varying intensity until 1923 when the Ottoman Empire ceased to exist and was replaced by the Republic of Turkey. The Armenian population of the Ottoman state was reported at about two million in 1915. An estimated one million had perished by 1918, while hundreds of thousands had become homeless and stateless refugees. By 1923 virtually the entire Armenian population of Anatolian Turkey had disappeared. Four hundred thousand Jews had already moved to Palestine in the early twentieth century, and numerous Jews to America, as already mentioned. The [[Russian Civil War]] caused some three million Russians, Poles, and Germans to migrate out of the new Soviet Union. [[Decolonisation|Decolonization]] following the Second World War also caused migrations.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Manning, ''Migration in World History'' (2005) p 132-162.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Adam|last=McKeown|author-link=Adam McKeown|title=Global migrations 1846-1940|journal=Journal of Global History|volume=15|issue=2|pages=155–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jew]]ish communities across Europe, the Mediterranean and the Middle East were formed from voluntary and involuntary migrants. After [[the Holocaust]] (1938 to 1945), there was increased migration to the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]], which became the modern state of [[Israel]] as a result of the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]].

Provisions of the [[Potsdam Agreement]] from 1945 signed by victorious [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] and the [[Soviet Union]] led to one of the largest European migrations, and the largest in the 20th century. It involved the migration and resettlement of close to or over 20 million people. The largest affected group were [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|16.5 million Germans expelled from Eastern Europe westwards]]. The second largest group were [[Poles]], [[Repatriation of Poles (1944–1946)|millions of whom were expelled]] westwards from eastern [[Kresy]] region and resettled in the so-called [[Recovered Territories]] (see [[Oder-Neisse line#Allies decide Polish border|Allies decide Polish border]] in the article on the [[Oder-Neisse line]]). Hundreds of thousands of Poles, Ukrainians ([[Operation Vistula]]), Lithuanians, Latvians, Estonians and some Belarusians were expelled eastwards from Europe to the Soviet Union. Finally, many of the several hundred thousand Jews remaining in Eastern Europe after the Holocaust [[Berihah|migrated outside Europe]] to [[Israel]] and the United States.

====Partition of India====
{{main|Partition of India}}
In 1947, upon the [[Partition of India]], large populations moved from India to Pakistan and vice versa, depending on their religious beliefs. The partition was created by the [[Indian Independence Act 1947]] as a result of the dissolution of the [[British Indian Empire]]. The partition displaced up to 17 million people in the former British Indian Empire,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Pakistan:History, Culture, and Government by Nigel Smith, Page 112&lt;/ref&gt; with estimates of loss of life varying from several hundred thousand to a million.&lt;ref&gt;Metcalf, Barbara; Metcalf, Thomas R. (2006), A Concise History of Modern India (Cambridge Concise Histories), Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press. Pp. xxxiii, 372, {{ISBN|0-521-68225-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muslim]] residents of the former British India migrated to [[Pakistan]] (including East Pakistan, now Bangladesh), whilst [[Hindu]] and [[Sikh]] residents of Pakistan and Hindu residents of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) moved in the opposite direction.

In modern India, estimates based on industry sectors mainly employing migrants suggest that there are around 100 million [[Circular Migration|circular migrants]] in India. Caste, social networks and historical precedents play a powerful role in shaping patterns of migration. 

Research by the [[Overseas Development Institute]] identifies a rapid movement of labor from slower- to faster-growing parts of the economy. Migrants can often find themselves excluded by urban housing policies, and [[Migrant worker|migrant]] support initiatives are needed to give workers improved access to market information, certification of identity, [[House|housing]] and [[education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2466&amp;title=support-migrant-workers-missing-link-indias-development|title=Support for migrant workers: the missing link in India's development?|date=September 2008|publisher=[[Overseas Development Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Iotatorquevirus''''' is a recently discovered [[Genus (biology)|genus]] in the new family of [[Anelloviridae]], in group [[DNA virus#Group II: ssDNA viruses|II in the Baltimore classification]]. It encompasses the two type species of the [[Torque Teno Sus Virus]] 1 and 2.

==Virology==

The virons are small and non enveloped.

The viruses are usually acquired soon after birth and may invade virtually any tissue in the body.&lt;ref name=Aramouni2010&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Aramouni M, Segalés J, Cortey M, Kekarainen T |title=Age-related tissue distribution of swine Torque teno sus virus 1 and 2 |journal=Vet.

They are widespread in the pig population&lt;ref name=Brink2012&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brink M, Ståhl K, Masembe C, Okurut AR, Berg M, Blomström AL |title=First time molecular detection and phylogenetic relationships of torque teno sus virus 1 and 2 in domestic pigs in Uganda: further evidence for a global distribution |journal=Virol.

==Genome==

The genome is a circular single stranded DNA molecule of negative polarity.

==Clinical==

[[Postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome]] has been causally associated with porcine circovirus type 2.&lt;ref name=Wallgren2007&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wallgren P, Belák K, Ehlorsson CJ, Bergström G, Lindberg M, Fossum C, Allan GM, Robertsson JA |title=Postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) in Sweden from an exotic to an endemic disease |journal=Vet Q |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=122–37 |year=2007 |pmid=18265702 |doi=10.1080/01652176.2007.9695238 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Iotatorquevirus have also been linked with this syndrome but a causative role—if one exists—has yet to be established.&lt;ref name=Nieto2011&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nieto D, Aramouni M, Grau-Roma L, Segalés J, Kekarainen T |title=Dynamics of Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) and 2 (TTSuV2) DNA loads in serum of healthy and postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) affected pigs |journal=Vet.

The '''Jones-Dole equation''' or Jones-Dole expression is an empirical expression that describes the relationship between the [[viscosity]] of a  [[solution]] and the concentration of solute within the solution (at a fixed temperature and pressure).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.le.ac.uk/chemistry/thermodynamics/pdfs/3000/Topic2930.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Jones-Dole equation is written as:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Grinnell|last2=Dole|first2=Malcolm|date=1929-10-01|title=THE VISCOSITY OF AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS OF STRONG ELECTROLYTES WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO BARIUM CHLORIDE|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja01385a012|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=51|issue=10|pages=2950–2964|doi=10.1021/ja01385a012|issn=0002-7863}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;math display="block"&gt;\frac{\eta}{\eta_0} = 1 + A C^\frac{1}{2}+ B C&lt;/math&gt;where
*''η'' is the viscosity of the solution (at a fixed temperature and pressure)
*''η&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the viscosity of the solvent at the same temperature and pressure
*''A'' is a [[coefficient]] that describes the impact of charge-charge interactions on the viscosity of a solution (it is usually positive) and can be calculated from [[Debye–Hückel theory|Debye-Hückel]] theory. 
*''B'' is a coefficient that characterises the solute-solvent interactions at a defined temperature and pressure. 
*''C'' is the solute concentration

The Jones-Dole ''B'' coefficient&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jenkins|first=H.

The large increase in viscosity as a function of solute concentration seen in all solutions above about 1 M is the effect of a [[Jamming (physics)|jamming]] transition at a high concentration. As a result, the viscosity increases exponentially as a function of concentration and diverges at a critical concentration. This has been referred to as the Mayonnaise Effect&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wynne|first=Klaas|date=2017-12-08|title=The Mayonnaise Effect|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.7b03207|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters|pages=6189–6192|doi=10.1021/acs.jpclett.7b03207|issn=1948-7185}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the viscosity of [[mayonnaise]] (essentially a solution of oil in water) is extremely high because of the jamming of micrometer scale droplets.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10547">A community has been defined as a group of interacting people living in a common location. The word is often used to refer to a group that is organized around common values and is attributed with social cohesion within a shared geographical location, generally in social units larger than a household. The word can also refer to the national community or global community.
The word "community" is derived from the Old French communité which is derived from the Latin communitas (cum, "with/together" + munus, "gift"), a broad term for fellowship or organized society.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, U. 1992. Risk Society: Towards a New Modernity. London: Sage&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[sense]] of community refers to people's [[perception]] of [[interconnection]] and [[interdependence]], shared [[Social responsibility|responsibility]], and [[wiktionary:Common|common]] [[goal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Melissa M. Ahern, Michael S. Hendryx, Kris Siddharthan
Medical Care, Vol. 34, No. 9 (Sep., 1996), pp. 863-986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chavis DM, Wandersman A. Sense of community in the urban environment: A catalyst for participation and community development. Am J Community Psychol 1990;18:55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McMillan DW, Chavis DM. Sense of community: A definition and theory. J Community Psychol 1986;14:6.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Understanding a community entails having knowledge of community needs and resources, having respect for community members, and involving key community members in programs.&lt;ref&gt;Sustaining Community-Based Programs for Families: Conceptualization and Measurement
Jay A. Mancini, Lydia I. Marek. ''[[Family Relations (journal)|Family Relations]]'', Vol. 53, No. 4 (Jul., 2004), pp. 339-419.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits of local community==
The author [[Robert Putnam]] refers to the [[value (economics)|value]] which comes from social networks as [[social capital]] in his book ''Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community.'' He writes that social capital "makes an enormous difference in our lives", that "a society characterized by generalized reciprocity is more efficient that a distrustful society" and that economic sociologists have shown a minimized economic wealth if social capital is lacking.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, Robert D. ''Bowling Alone: the Collapse and Revival of American Community''. New York: [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 2000. pp.21,289-290.&lt;/ref&gt;

Putnam reports that the first use of the social capital theory was by [[L. J. Hanifan]], a practical reformer during the [[Progressive Era]] in the United States of America. The following description of social capital is a quote from L.J. Hanifan in Putnam's Book:

{{quote|
Those tangible substances [that] count for most in the daily lives of people: namely good will, fellowship, sympathy, and social intercourse among individuals and families who make up a social unit…. The individual is helpless socially, if left to himself…. If he comes into contact with neighbor, and they with other neighbors, there will be an accumulation of social capital, which may immediately satisfy his social needs and which may bear a social potentiality sufficient to the substantial improvement of living conditions in the whole community. The community as a whole will benefit by the cooperation of all its parts, while the individual will find in his associations the advantages of the help, sympathy, and fellowship of his neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;Lyda Judson Hanifan, "The Rural School Community Center," Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 67 (1916): 130-138, quotation at 130. Found in Putnam, Robert D. Bowling Alone: the Collapse and Revival of American Community. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2000. Print.a&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

;Employment
Putnam reported that many studies have shown that the highest predictor of [[job satisfaction]] is the presence of social connection in the [[Wiktionary:Workplace|workplace]]. He writes that "people with friends at work are happier at work." And that "social networks provide people with advice, a bonus, a promotion, and other strategic information, and letters of recommendation."&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, Robert D. (2000), p.90. Referencing: Jeanne S. Hurlbert, "Social Networks, Social Circles, and Job satisfaction," Work and Occupations, 18 (1991): 415-438; Randy Hodson, "Group Relations at Work: Solidarity, Conflict, and Relations with Management," Work and Occupations 24 (1997): 426-452; Ronnie Sandroff, "The power of Office Friendships," Working Mother (November 1997): 35-36, and the works cited there.&lt;/ref&gt;

Community engagement has been proven to counteract the most negative attributes of poverty and a high amount of social capital has been shown to reduce crime.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, Robert D. (2000), pp.297-308.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Local community and health
"Social connectedness matters to our lives in the most profound way." -Robert Putnam.&lt;ref name="putnam326"&gt;Putnam, Robert D. (2000), p.326.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Putnam reports, in the chapter ''Health and Happiness'' from his book ''Bowling Alone'', that recent public research shows social connection impacts all areas of human health, this includes psychological and physical aspects of human health. Putnam says "...beyond a doubt that social connectedness is one of the most powerful determinates of our well being."&lt;ref name="putnam326" /&gt; In particular it is face to face connections which have been show to have greater impacts then non-face to face relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, Robert D. (2000), p.332.&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific health benefits of strong social relationships are a decrease in the likelihood of: seasonal viruses, heart attacks, strokes, cancer, depression, and premature death of all sorts.&lt;ref name="putnam326" /&gt;

; Online initiatives
There are online initiatives to improve local community's like LOCAL (www.localchange.com).

== Community sustainability==
[[Sustainability]] in community programs is the capacity of programs (services designed to meet the needs of community members) to continuously respond to community issues.

A sustained program maintains a focus consonant with its original goals and objectives, including the [[individuals]], [[families]], and communities it was originally intended to serve. Programs change regarding the breadth and depth of their programming. Some become aligned with other organizations and established institutions, whereas others maintain their independence.
Understanding the community context in which programs serving the community function has an important influence on program sustainability and success.&lt;ref name="lafond"&gt;LaFond, A. K. (1995). Improving the quality of investment in health: Issues on sustainability. Health Policy and Planning (Suppl. 10), 63-76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mancini-marek"&gt;Sustaining Community-Based Programs for Families: Conceptualization and Measurement

According to [[Washington (state)|Washington State]]'s [[Sustain South Sound]] organization, the top ten reasons to [[Local purchasing|buy locally]] are:&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.oly-wa.us/SustainSouthSound/TopTenReasonsToBuyLocal.php Top Ten Reasons to Buy Local] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20100307105614/http://www.oly-wa.us/SustainSouthSound/TopTenReasonsToBuyLocal.php |date=2010-03-07 }}'', [[Sustain South Sound]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

# To strengthen local economy: Studies have shown that buying from an independent, locally owned business, significantly raises the number of times your money is used to make purchases from other local businesses, service providers and farms—continuing to strengthen the economic base of the community.
# Increase jobs: Small local businesses are the largest employer nationally in the United States of America.
# Encourage local prosperity: A growing body of economic research shows that in an increasingly homogenized world, entrepreneurs and skilled workers are more likely to invest and settle in communities that preserve their one-of-a-kind businesses and distinctive character.
# Reduce environmental impact: Locally owned businesses can make more local purchases requiring less transportation and generally set up shop in town or city centers as opposed to developing on the fringe. This means contributing less to greenhouse gas emissions, sprawl, congestion, habitat loss and pollution.
# Support community groups: Non-profit organizations receive an average 250% more support from smaller business owners than they do from large businesses.
# Keep your community unique: Where we shop, where we eat and have fun—all of it makes our community home.
# Get better service: Local businesses often hire people with a better understanding of the products they are selling and take more time to get to know customers.
# Invest in community: Local businesses are owned by people who live in the community, are less likely to leave, and are more invested in the community's future.
# Put your taxes to good use: Local businesses in town centers require comparatively little infrastructure investment and make more efficient use of public services as compared to nationally owned stores entering the community.
# Buy what you want, not what someone wants you to buy: A marketplace of tens of thousands of small businesses is the best way to ensure innovation and low prices over the long-term. A multitude of small businesses, each selecting products based not on a national sales plan but on their own interests and the needs of their local customers, guarantees a much broader range of product choices.

      <comment>/* Functional modeling perspective */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6560">A '''modeling perspective''' in [[information system]]s is a particular way to represent pre-selected aspects of a system. Any [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspective]] has a different focus, conceptualization, dedication and visualization of what the [[scientific modelling|model]] is representing. 

The traditional way to distinguish between modeling perspectives is structural, functional and behavioral/processual perspectives. This together with rule, object, communication and actor and role perspectives is one way of classifying modeling approaches.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Krogstie]] (2003). [http://www.idi.ntnu.no/~krogstie/publications/2003/quality-book/b2-languages.pdf Conceptual modeling] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316203713/http://www.idi.ntnu.no/~krogstie/publications/2003/quality-book/b2-languages.pdf |date=2007-03-16 }}, &lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of perspectives ==
===Structural modeling perspective===
This approach concentrates on describing the static structure. The main concept in this modeling perspective is the entity, this could be an object, phenomena, concept, thing etc. 

The data modeling languages have traditionally handled this perspective, examples of such being:	
*The [[ER model|ER-language]] (Entity-Relationship)
*[[Generic Semantic Modeling language]] (GSM)
*Other approaches including:
:*The NIAM language (Binary relationship language)
:*[[Conceptual graph]]s ([[John Sowa|Sowa]])

Looking at the ER-language we have the basic components:
*Entities:	Distinctively identifiable phenomenon.
*Relationships:	An association among the entities. 
*Attributes:	Used to give value to a property of an entity/relationship.

Looking at the generic semantic modeling language we have the basic components:
*Constructed types built by abstraction: Aggregation, generalization, and association.
*Attributes.
*Primitive types: Data types in GSM are classified into printable and abstract types.
:*Printable: Used to specify visible values.
:*Abstract: Representing entities.

===Functional modeling perspective===
The [[functional model]]ing approach concentrates on describing the dynamic process. The main concept in this modeling perspective is the process, this could be a function, transformation, activity, action, task etc. A well-known example of a modeling language employing this perspective is data flow diagrams.

The perspective uses four symbols to describe a process, these being:
*Process: Illustrates transformation from input to output.
*Store:	   Data-collection or some sort of material.
*Flow:	   Movement of data or material in the process.
*External Entity: External to the modeled system, but interacts with it.

Now, with these symbols, a process can be represented as a network of these symbols.
This decomposed process is a DFD, data flow diagram.

===Behavioral perspective===
Behavioral perspective gives a description of system dynamics. The main concepts in behavioral perspective are states and transitions between states. State transitions are triggered by events. State Transition Diagrams (STD/STM), State charts and Petri-nets are some examples of well-known behaviorally oriented modeling languages. Different types of State Transition Diagrams are used particularly within [[real-time systems]] and [[telecommunications]] systems.

===Rule perspective===
Rule perspective gives a description of goals/means connections. The main concepts in rule perspective are rule, goal and constraint. A rule is something that influences the actions of a set of actors. The standard form of rule is “IF condition THEN action/expression”. Rule hierarchies (goal-oriented modeling), Tempora and Expert systems are some examples of rule oriented modeling.

===Object perspective===
The [[object-oriented]] perspective describes the world as autonomous, communicating objects. An object is an “entity” which has a unique and unchangeable identifier and a local state consisting of a collection of attributes with assignable values. The state can only be manipulated with a set of methods defined on the object. The value of the state can only be accessed by sending a message to the object to call on one of its methods. An event is when an operation is being triggered by receiving a message, and the trace of the events during the existence of the object is called the object’s life cycle or the process of an object. Several objects that share the same definitions of attributes and operations can be parts of an object class. The perspective is originally based on design and programming of object oriented systems. [[Unified Modelling Language]] (UML) is a well known language for modeling with an object perspective.

===Communication perspective===
This perspective is based on language/action theory from [[philosophical linguistics]]. The basic assumption in this perspective is that person/objects cooperate on a process/action through communication within them.

An illocutionary act consists of five elements: Speaker, hearer, time, location and circumstances. It is a reason and goal for the communication, where the participations in a communication act is oriented towards mutual agreement. In a communication act, the speaker generally can raise three claims: truth (referring an object), justice (referring a social world of the participations) and claim to sincerity (referring the subjective world of the speaker).

===Actor and role perspective===
[[Actor]] and [[role]] perspective is a description of organisational and system structure. An actor can be defined as a phenomenon that influences the history of another actor, whereas a role can be defined as the behaviour which is expected by an actor, amongst other actors, when filling the role. Modeling within these perspectives is based both on work with [[object-oriented programming language]]s and work with intelligent agents in [[artificial intelligence]]. [[I*]] is an example of an actor oriented language.

''' Olecranon fracture''' is a [[bone fracture|fracture]] of the [[Olecranon|bony portion]] of the [[elbow]]. The injury is fairly common and often occurs following a fall or direct trauma to the elbow. The olecranon is the proximal extremity of the [[ulna]] which is articulated with the [[humerus]] bone and constitutes a part of the elbow articulation. Its location makes it vulnerable to direct trauma.

==Classifications==
There are several classifications that describe different forms of olecranon fractures, yet none of them have gained widespread acceptance:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Newman|first=S. D. S.|last2=Mauffrey|first2=C.|last3=Krikler|first3=S.|date=2009-06-01|title=Olecranon fractures|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020138308005524|journal=Injury|volume=40|issue=6|pages=575–581|doi=10.1016/j.injury.2008.12.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mayo classification ===
Based on the stability, the displacement and the [[Comminuted fracture|comminution of the fracture]]. It is composed of three types, and each type is divided in two subtypes: subtype A (non-comminuted) and subtype B (comminuted).
* '''Type I:''' Non-displaced fracture – It can be either non-comminuted ones (Type IA) or comminuted (Type IB).
* '''Type II''': Displaced, stable fractures – In this pattern, the proximal fracture fragment is displaced more than 3&amp;nbsp;mm, but the collateral ligaments are intact. That is why there is no elbow instability. It can be either non-comminuted ones (Type IIA) or comminuted (Type IIB).
* '''Type III:''' Displaced instable fracture – In this case, the fracture fragments are displaced and the forearm is instable in relation to the humerus. It is a fracture -dislocation. It also may be either non-comminuted (Type IIIA) or comminuted (Type IIIB).

===AO classification===
This classification incorporates all fractures of the proximal ulna and radius into one group, subdivided into three patterns:
* '''Type A:''' Extra-articular fractures of the metadiaphysis of either the radius or the ulna
* '''Type B:''' Intra-articular fractures of either the radius or ulna
* '''Type C:''' Complex fractures of both the proximal radius and ulna

=== '''Colton Classification''' ===

* '''Type I''' - Nondisplaced - Displacement does not increase with elbow flexion

* '''Type II''' - Avulsion (displaced)

* '''Type III''' - Oblique and Transverse (displaced)

* '''Type IV''' - Comminuted (displaced)

* '''Type V''' - Fracture dislocation 

=== '''Schatzker Classification''' ===

* '''Type A''' - Simple transverse fracture

* '''Type B''' - Transverse impacted fracture

* '''Type C''' - Oblique fracture

* '''Type D''' - Communuted fracture

* '''Type E''' - More distal fracture, extra-articular

* '''Type F''' - Fracture-dislocation

==Signs and symptoms==
People with olecranon fractures present with intense elbow pain after a direct blow or fall.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/706805938|title=Essentials of musculoskeletal care|date=2010|publisher=American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons|others=Sarwark, John F.|isbn=9780892035793|location=Rosemont, Ill.|oclc=706805938}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swelling over the bone site is seen and an inability to straighten the elbow is common. Due to the proximity of the olecranon to the ulnar nerve, the injury and swelling may cause numbness and tingling at the 4th and 5th fingers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Examination can bring out a palpable defect at the site of the fracture.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/960851324|title=Handbook of fractures|last=1967-|first=Egol, Kenneth A.,|date=2015|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health|others=Koval, Kenneth J., Zuckerman, Joseph D. (Joseph David), 1952-, Ovid Technologies, Inc.|isbn=9781451193626|edition=5th|location=Philadelphia|oclc=960851324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
Olecranon fractures are common. Typically they are caused by direct blows to the elbow (e.g. motor vehicle accidents), and due to falls when the triceps are contracted.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/711520941|title=Current diagnosis &amp; treatment emergency medicine|date=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|others=Stone, C. Keith., Humphries, Roger L.|isbn=9780071701075|edition=7th|location=New York|oclc=711520941}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Side-swipe" injury when driving a motor vehicle with an elbow projecting outside the vehicle resting on an open window's edge is an example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Kerry |last1=Knapp |chapter=The Elbow |chapterurl=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1US2ub-w9JwC&amp;pg=PA243 |pages=243–8 |editor1-first=Patrick |editor1-last=Hannon |editor2-first=Kerry |editor2-last=Knapp |year=2006 |title=Forensic Biomechanics |publisher=Lawyers &amp; Judges |isbn=978-1-930056-27-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Direct trauma: '''This can happen in a fall with landing on the elbow or by being hit by a solid object. Trauma to the elbow often results in [[comminuted fracture]]s of the olecranon.

'''Indirect trauma''': by falling and landing with an outstretched arm.

Powerful pull of the [[Triceps brachii muscle|triceps muscle]] can also cause [[avulsion fracture]]s.

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Olecranon Fracture.jpg|thumb|Olecranon fracture|212x212px]]
To assess an olecranon fracture, a careful skin exam is performed to ensure there is no open fracture. Then a complete neurological exam of the upper limb should be documented.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Frontal and lateral [[X-ray]] views of the elbow are typically done to investigate the possibility of an olecranon fracture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A true lateral x-ray is essential to determine the fracture pattern, degree of displacement, comminution, and the degree of articular involvement.

==Treatment==
[[File:Fracture of Olecranon pre and post typical surgery.jpg|thumb|205x205px|Fracture (left) and repair (right) with three pins, wires, and incision closure with staples]]

=== Nondisplaced fractures ===
In fractures with little or no displacement, immobilization with a posterior splint may be sufficient.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Elbows be immobilized at 45-90º of flexion for 3 weeks, followed by limited (90º) flexion exercises.

=== Displaced fractures ===
Most olecranon fractures are displaced and are best treated surgically:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Tension band fixation ====
Tension band fixation is the most common form of internal fixation used for non-comminuted olectranon fractures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is typically reserved for noncomminuted fractures that are proximal to the coronoid.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This procedure is performed using [[Kirschner wire]] (K-wires) which converts tensile forces into compressive force.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Intramedullary fixation and plates ====
Single intramedullary screws can be used to treat simple transverse or oblique fractures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Plates can be used for all proximal ulna fracture types including Monteggia fractures, and comminuted fractures.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Excision and triceps advancement ====
This method is indicated for cases when open reduction and internal fixation is unlikely to be successful. For example: extensive comminutions, elderly patients with osteoporotic bone, and small or non-union fractures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Olecranon fractures are rare in children, constituting only 5 to 7% of all elbow fractures. This is because in early life, olecranon is thick, short and much stronger than the lower extremity of the humerus.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, olecranon fractures are a common injury in adults. This is partly due to its exposed position on the point of the elbow.

[[File:Cofrentes nuclear power plant cooling towers retouched.jpg|thumb|285x285px|Typical cooling towers of nuclear power plant]]
'''Power plant engineering''' or '''power station engineering''' is a division of [[power engineering]], and is defined as "the engineering and technology required for the [[Electricity generation|production]] of [[Power station|central station]] [[electric power]]."&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Plant Engineering|last=Weisman|first=Joel|publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc.|year=1985|isbn=0-13-597252-3|location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey 07632|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field is focused on the generation of power for industries and communities, not for household power production. The field is an interdisciplinary field, using the theoretical base of both [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical]] and [[electrical engineering]]. The engineering aspect of power plant management has evolved with technology and has become progressively more complicated. The introduction of [[Nuclear power|nuclear technology]] and the progression of other existing technologies have allowed power to be created in more ways and on a larger scale than was previously possible. The assignment of different types of engineers to the design, construction, and operation of a new power plant is dependent on the type of system being built such as whether it is a [[nuclear power plant]], [[hydroelectric plant]], or solar plant.

== History ==
[[File:PearlStreetStation.jpg|thumb|Pearl Street Station 1882]]
Power plant engineering got its start in the 1800s when small systems were used by individual factories to provide [[electrical power]]. Originally the only source of power came from DC, or [[direct current]], systems.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.edisontechcenter.org/HistElectPowTrans.html|title=History of Electrification Sites|last=Center|first=Copyright 2014 Edison Tech|website=www.edisontechcenter.org|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this was suitable for business, electricity was not accessible for most of the public body. During these times, the coal powered [[steam engine]] was costly to run and there was no way for the power to be transmitted over distances. [[Hydroelectricity]] was one of the most utilized forms of power generation as [[water mills]] could be used to create power to transmit to small towns.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

It wasn't until the introduction of AC, or [[alternating current]], [[AC power|power systems]] that allowed for the creation of power plants as we know them today. AC systems allowed power to be transmitted over larger distances than DC systems allowed and thus, large power stations were able to be created. One of the progenitors of long-distance power-transmission was the [[International Electrotechnical Exhibition|Lauffen to Frankfurt power plant]] which spanned 109 miles.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.edisontechcenter.org/LauffenFrankfurt.html|title=Lauffen to Frankfurt 1891|last=Center|first=Copyright 2015 Edison Tech|website=www.edisontechcenter.org|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lauffen-Frankfurt demonstrated how [[three-phase power]] could be effectively applied to transmit power over long distances.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brighthubengineering.com/power-plants/18686-what-are-power-plants/|title=What are Power Plants?|website=Brighthub Engineering|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three-phase power had been the progeny of years of research in power distribution and the Lauffen-Frankfurt was the first exhibition to show its real potential for future use.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The engineering knowledge needed to perform these tasks enlists the help of several fields of engineering including mechanical, electrical, [[nuclear engineering|nuclear]] and [[civil engineering|civil engineers]]. When power plants were up and coming, engineering tasks needed to create these facilities mainly consisted of mechanical, civil, and electrical engineers.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These disciplines allowed for the planning and construction of power plants. But when nuclear power plants were created it introduced nuclear engineers to perform the calculations necessary to maintain safety standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.livescience.com/47749-nuclear-engineering.html|title=What Is Nuclear Engineering?|work=Live Science|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governing principles ==

=== First Law of Thermodynamics ===
In simple terms, the [[first law of thermodynamics]] states that [[energy]] cannot be created nor destroyed; however, power can be converted from one form of energy to another form of energy. This is especially important in power generation because power production in nearly all types of power plants relies upon the use of a [[Electric generator|generator]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Generators are used to convert [[mechanical energy]] into electrical energy; for example, [[wind turbines]] utilize a large blade connected to a shaft which turns the generator when rotated. The generator then creates electricity due to the interaction of a conductor within a magnetic field. In this case, the mechanical energy generated by the wind is converted, through the generator, into electric energy. Most power plants rely on these conversions to create usable electric power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://science.howstuffworks.com/electricity3.htm|title=How Electricity Works|date=2004-05-28|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second law of thermodynamics ===
The [[second law of thermodynamics]] conceptualizes that the [[entropy]] of a closed system can never decrease. As the law relates to power plants, it dictates that heat is to flow from a body at high temperature to a body at low temperature (the device in which electricity is being generated).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This law is particularly pertinent to [[thermal power plants]] which derive their energy from the [[combustion]] of a [[fuel]] source.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Types of power plants ==
All power plants are created with the same goal: to produce electric power as efficiently as possible. However, as technology has evolved, the sources of energy used in power plants has evolved as well.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The introduction of more renewable/sustainable forms of energy has caused an increase in the improvement and creation of certain power plants.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Hydroelectric power plants ===
[[File:Diablo Dam (from WA SR 20).jpg|thumb|239x239px|Hydroelectric Dam]]
[[Hydroelectricity|Hydroelectric power plants]] generate power using the force of water to turn generators. They can be categorized into three different types; impoundment, diversion and pumped storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.energy.gov/eere/water/types-hydropower-plants|title=Types of Hydropower Plants {{!}} Department of Energy|website=www.energy.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impoundment and diversion hydroelectric power plants operate similarly in that each involves creating a barrier to keep water from flowing at an uncontrollable rate, and then controlling the flow rate of water to pass through turbines to create electricity at an ideal level. Mechanical engineers are in charge of calculating flow rates and other volumetric calculations necessary to turn the generators at the electrical engineers specifications. Pumped storage hydroelectric power plants operate in a similar manner but only function at peak hours of power demand. At calm hours the water is pumped uphill, then is released at peak hours to flow from a high to low elevation to turn turbines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://water.usgs.gov/edu/hyhowworks.html|title=Hydroelectric Power: How it works, USGS Water-Science School|last=USGS|first=Howard Perlman,|website=water.usgs.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The engineering knowledge required to assess the performance of pumped storage hydroelectric power plants is very similar to that of the impoundment and diversion power plants.

=== Thermal power plants ===
[[File:Komatsu bulldozer pushing coal in Power plant Ljubljana (winter 2017).jpg|thumb|238x238px|Coal being pushed into coal power plant]]
[[Thermal power station|Thermal power plants]] are split into two different categories; those that create electricity by burning fuel and those that create electricity via prime mover. A common example of a thermal power plant that produces electricity by the consumption of fuel is the nuclear power plant. Nuclear power plants use a [[nuclear reactor|nuclear reactor's]] heat to turn water into steam.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; This steam is sent through a turbine which is connected to an electric generator to generate electricity. [[Nuclear power plant]]s account for 20% of [[Energy in the United States|America's electricity generation]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thermal-powerplant.blogspot.com/2010/05/thermal-power-plant-classification.html|title=Thermal Power Plant Classification|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of a fuel burning power plant is [[Fossil fuel power station|coal power plant]]. [[Fossil fuel power station|Coal power plants]] generate 50% of the United States' electricity supply.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Coal power plants operate in a manner similar to nuclear power plants in that the heat from the burning coal powers a steam turbine and electric generator.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; There are several types of engineers that work in a Thermal Power Plant. Mechanical engineers maintain performance of the thermal power plants while keeping the plants in operation.&lt;ref name="Wagner"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://work.chron.com/engineers-work-solar-1835.html|title=Engineers Who Work With Solar|last=Wagner|first=Vivian|date=|website=Houston Chronicle|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nuclear Engineer generally handle fuel efficiency and disposal of nuclear waste; however, in Nuclear Power Plants they work directly with nuclear equipment.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://collegegrad.com/careers/nuclear-engineers|title=Nuclear Engineers|last=|first=|date=|website=CollegeGrad|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electrical Engineers deals with the power generating equipment as well as the calculations.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sokanu.com/careers/electrical-engineer/#what-does-an-electrical-engineer-do|title=What Does An Electrical Engineer Do?|last=|first=|date=|website=Sokanu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solar power plants ===
[[File:Fixed Tilt Solar panel at Canterbury Municipal Building Canterbury New Hampshire.jpg|thumb|237x237px|Solar field]]
[[Solar power plant]]s derive their energy from sunlight, which is made accessible via [[photovoltaics]] (PV's). Photovoltaic panels, or [[solar panels]], are constructed using photovoltaic cells which are made of [[semiconductor]] materials that release electrons when they are warmed by the thermal energy of the sun. The new flow of electrons generates electricity within the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/solar-power/|title=Solar Power Has Benefits as a Source of Alternative Energy|date=2009-10-09|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While PV's are an efficient method of producing electricity, they do burn out after a decade and thus, must be replaced; however, their efficiency, cost of operation, and lack of [[noise pollution|noise]]/[[pollution|physical pollutants]] make them one of the cleanest and least expensive forms of energy.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Solar power plants require the work of many facets of engineering; electrical engineers are especially crucial in constructing the solar panels and connecting them into a grid, computer engineers code the cells themselves so that electricity can be effectively and efficiently produced, and civil engineers play the very important role of identifying areas where solar plants are able to collect the most energy.&lt;ref name="Wagner"/&gt;

=== Wind power plants ===
[[File:Middelgrunden wind farm 2009-07-01 edit filtered.jpg|thumb|239x239px|Wind power plant]]
[[Wind farm|Wind power plants]], also known as wind turbines, derive their energy from the wind by connecting a generator to the fan blades and using the rotational motion caused by [[wind]] to power the generator.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/how-do-wind-turbines-work|title=How Do Wind Turbines Work? {{!}} Department of Energy|website=www.energy.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then the generated power is fed back into the power grid. Wind power plants can be implemented on large, open expanses of land or on large bodies of water such as the oceans; they simply rely on being in areas that experience significant amounts of wind.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Technically, wind turbines are a form of solar power in that they rely on pressure differentials caused by uneven heating of the earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Wind turbines solicit the knowledge from mechanical, electrical, and civil engineers. Knowledge of fluid dynamics from the help of mechanical engineers is crucial in determining the viability of locations for wind turbines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/career-map-mechanical-engineer|title=Mechanical Engineer|last=|first=|date=|website=Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electrical engineers ensure that power generation and transmission is possible.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Civil engineers are important in the construction and utilization of wind turbines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sokanu.com/careers/civil-engineer/#what-does-a-civil-engineer-do|title=What does a Civil Engineer Do?|last=|first=|date=|website=Sokanu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Random coil index (RCI)'''  predicts [[protein]] flexibility by calculating an inverse weighted average of backbone secondary [[chemical shift]]s and predicting values of model-free order parameters as well as per-residue RMSD of NMR and [[molecular dynamics]] ensembles from this parameter.&lt;ref name=RCI_JACS_2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mark|first=Berjanskii|author2=David Wishart |title=A simple method to predict protein flexibility using secondary chemical shifts|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|year=2005|volume=127 | issue = 43 |pages=14970–14971|doi=10.1021/ja054842f| url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja054842f |pmid=16248604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The key advantages of this protocol over existing methods of studying protein flexibility are
# it does not require prior knowledge of a [[protein]]'s tertiary structure,
# it is not sensitive to the protein's overall tumbling and
# it does not require additional NMR measurements beyond the standard experiments for backbone assignments.&lt;ref name=RCI_JBNMR_2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mark|first=Berjanskii|author2=David Wishart |title=Application of the random coil index to studying protein flexibility|journal=Journal of Biomolecular NMR|year=2008|volume=40|issue=1|pages=31–48|doi=10.1007/s10858-007-9208-0|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/2966482w10306126/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The application of secondary chemical shifts to characterize protein flexibility is based on an assumption that the proximity of chemical shifts to random coil values is a manifestation of increased protein mobility, while significant differences from random coil values are an indication of a relatively rigid structure.&lt;ref name="RCI_JACS_2005"/&gt;

Even though chemical shifts of rigid residues may adopt random coil values as a result of comparable contributions of shielding and deshielding effects (e.g. from torsion angles, hydrogen bonds, ring currents, etc.), combining the chemical shifts from multiple nuclei into a single parameter allows one to decrease the influence of these flexibility false positives. The improved performance originates from the different probabilities of random coil chemical shifts from different nuclei being found among amino acid residues in flexible regions versus rigid regions. Typically, residues in rigid helices or rigid beta-strands are less likely to have more than one random coil chemical shift among their backbone shifts than residues in mobile regions.&lt;ref name="RCI_JBNMR_2008"/&gt;

The actual calculation of the RCI involves several additional steps including the smoothing of secondary shifts over several adjacent residues, the use of neighboring residue corrections, [[Protein Chemical Shift Re-Referencing|chemical shift re-referencing]], gap filling, chemical shift scaling and numeric adjustments to prevent [[Division by zero|divide-by-zero]] problems. 13C, 15 N and 1H secondary chemical shifts are then scaled to account for the characteristic resonance frequencies of these nuclei and to provide numeric consistency among different parts of the protocol. Once these scaling corrections have been done, the RCI is calculated. The ‘‘end-effect correction’’ can also be applied at this point. The last step of the protocol involves smoothing the initial set of RCI values by three-point averaging.&lt;ref name=RCI_Nature_2006&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mark|first=Berjanskii|author2=David Wishart |title=NMR: prediction of protein flexibility|journal=Nature Protocols|year=2006|volume=1|pages=683–688|doi=10.1038/nprot.2006.108| url=http://www.nature.com/nprot/journal/v1/n2/full/nprot.2006.108.html|issue=2|pmid=17406296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Site planning''' in [[landscape architecture]] and [[architecture]] refers to the organizational stage of the landscape design process. It involves the organization of land use [[zoning]], access, circulation, privacy, security, shelter, land drainage, and other factors. This is done by arranging the compositional elements of '''landform, planting, water, buildings and paving''' in [[site plan]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Planning and community development A guide for the 21st century.|last=Tyler|first=Norman, Robert M. Ward|publisher=Norton &amp; Co.|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Site planning is the design and process of planning for a new development project. Within [[Community development|Community Development]], this stage of site planning is the organizing phase where city planners create a tactical/detailed plan of new developments. These site plans are the exact details city planners need to give their proposal to the community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is the proposal to the community to get development plans approved of. Through site analysis and precise dimensions taken by development engineers, community members are given an exact image of what developers want to do.

== Factors ==
Site planning generally begins by assessing a potential site for development through [[site analysis]]. Information about slope, soils, hydrology, vegetation, parcel ownership, orientation, etc. are assessed and mapped. By determining areas that are poor for development (such as floodplain or steep slopes) and better for development, the planner or architect can assess optimal location and design a structure that works within this space. Within site analysis you also need to take into consideration the structure of [[zoning]] throughout a city.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These are regulations that have been structured to separate the land of what can be used as residential and industrial. This allows a city to not be over powered by one type of land distinction.

When creating a development project plan city planners take into consideration and look at other buildings site plans to see what characteristics it has that helped get their building or renovation approved. City planners must look at different aspects that may affect the citizens around them because they are the ones living next to this. City planners must take into consideration height of a building, walking space, parking for cars/bikes and does it stand out from the cities other building types, design wise. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;These are all things that have to be considered because citizens are not going to want buildings blocking certain views/sunlight, customers/ new residents taking up parking current residents parking and having a building style that looks out of place and like it doesn't belong because city planners wanted a new/modern style building.

Within the it plan there also is details about where everything currently is, not only buildings but water, sewer and power lines. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;These are necessities that need to be kept safe and taken into consideration when developing a new development project. Within creating new development plans there are regulations that all buildings have to follow that are created by the city. These are regulations to help keep new development projects going out of control and keeping our city contained and not expanding at alarming rates that we cannot control. 

== History ==
Site Planning was created by city planners to develop a clear plan/ design of what the city planners want for our community. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rri.wvu.edu/WebBook/McBride/main.htm|title=Site Planning and Design|last=McBride|first=Steven|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To start off, community members would make claims of buildings that need renovations and improvements to their community. Then the community developers want to come up with a way to satisfy their community members and this is done by creating a site plan. Planners have discovered that they have to be smart about with there designs because they have to remember they have a certain budget. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; All these actions of creating this design is called site planning.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12212">'''Systems psychology''' is a branch of both [[theoretical psychology]] and [[applied psychology]] that studies [[human behaviour]] and [[experience]] in [[complex system]]s. It is inspired by [[systems theory]] and [[systems thinking]], and based on the theoretical work of [[Roger Barker]], [[Gregory Bateson]], [[Humberto Maturana]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Jeanne M. Plas (1986) ''Systems psychology in the schools''. p.xvi&lt;/ref&gt; Groups and individuals are considered as [[systems]] in [[homeostasis]]. Alternative terms here are "systemic psychology", "systems behavior", and "systems-based psychology".{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

== Types ==
In the scientific literature, different kinds of systems psychology have been mentioned:

;Applied systems psychology
:In the 1970s the term applied systems psychology was being used as a specialism directly related to [[engineering psychology]] and [[human factor]].&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon B. De Greene, Earl A. Alluisi (1970), ''Systems Psychology'', McGraw-Hill. p.44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald John Beishon, Geoff Peters (1976) ''Systems behaviour''. p.144&lt;/ref&gt;

;Cognitive systems theory
:Cognitive systems psychology is a part of [[cognitive psychology]] and like [[existential psychology]], attempts to dissolve the barrier between [[conscious]] and the unconscious mind.&lt;ref&gt;David Parrish (2006), "Nothing I See Means Anything: Quantum Questions, Quantum Answers", p.29&lt;/ref&gt;

;Concrete systems psychology
:Concrete systems psychology is the study of human systems across the varied biological contexts and situations of everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=J.G.|title=A theoretical review of individual and group psychological reaction to stress, in Grosser G.H.

:Contract-systems psychology is about the human systems actualization through participative organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Marcia Guttentag and Elmer L Struening (1975), ''Handbook of Evaluation Research''. Sage. {{ISBN|0-8039-0429-0}}. page 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Family systems psychology
:Family systems psychology is a more general name for the subfield of [[family systems therapy|family therapists]]. E.g. [[Murray Bowen]], Michael E. Kerr, and Baard&lt;ref&gt;Michael B. Goodman (1998), ''Corporate Communications for Executives'', SUNY Press. {{ISBN|0-7914-3761-2}}.

;Organismic-systems psychology
:Through the application of organismic-systems biology to human behavior [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]] conceived and developed the organismic-systems psychology, as the theoretical prospect needed for the gradual comprehension of the various ways human personalities may evolve and how they could evolve properly, being supported by a holistic interpretation of human behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.bertalanffy.org/c_22.html | title = Organsmic Systems Psychology | accessdate = 21 March 2008 | publisher = Bertalanffy Center for the Study of Systems Science | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081001203159/http://www.bertalanffy.org/c_22.html

=== Ergonomics ===
{{Main|Ergonomics}}
Ergonomics, also called &lt;!-- "[[Engineering psychology]]" or --&gt; "[[human factors]]", is the application of scientific information concerning objects, systems and environment for human use (definition adopted by the [[International Ergonomics Association]] in 2007). Ergonomics is commonly described as the way companies design tasks and work areas to maximize the efficiency and quality of their employees’ work. However, ergonomics comes into everything which involves people. Work systems, sports and leisure, health and safety should all embody ergonomics principles if well designed.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Equipment design is intended to maximize productivity by reducing operator fatigue and discomfort. The field is also called human engineering and [[human factors engineering]]. Ergonomic research is primarily performed by ergonomists who study human capabilities in relationship to their work demands. Information derived from ergonomists contributes to the design and evaluation of tasks, jobs, products, environments and systems in order to make them compatible with the needs, abilities and limitations of people.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===Family system therapy===
{{Main|Family therapy}}
Family system therapy, also referred to as "family  therapy" and "couple and family therapy", is a branch of [[psychotherapy]] related to [[relationship counseling]] that works with [[family|families]] and couples in [[intimate relationship]]s to nurture change and development. It tends to view the family as a system, family relationships as an important factor in psychological health. As such, family problems have been seen to arise as an [[emergence|emergent]] property of systemic interactions, rather than to be blamed on individual members. Marriage and Family Therapists (MFTs) are the most specifically trained in this type of psychotherapy.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

=== Organizational psychology ===
{{Main|Industrial and organizational psychology}}
Industrial and organizational psychology also known as "work psychology", "occupational psychology" or "personnel psychology" concerns the application of [[psychology|psychological]] theories, research methods, and intervention strategies to workplace issues. Industrial and organizational psychologists are interested in making organizations more productive while ensuring workers are able to lead physically and psychologically healthy lives. Relevant topics include personnel psychology, [[motivation]] and [[leadership]], employee selection, training and development, organization development and guided change, [[organizational behavior]], and job and family issues.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

=== Perceptual control theory ===
{{Main|Perceptual control theory}}
Perceptual control theory (PCT) is a psychological theory of animal and [[human behavior]] originated by [[William T. Powers]]. In contrast with other theories of psychology and behavior, which assume that behavior is a function of perception — that perceptual inputs determine or cause behavior — PCT postulates that an organism's behavior is a means of controlling its perceptions. In contrast with [[control theory|engineering control theory]], the reference variable for each [[negative feedback]] control loop in a control hierarchy is set from within the system (the organism), rather than by an external agent changing the [[Setpoint (control system)|setpoint]] of the [[Controller (control theory)|controller]].&lt;ref name="CT_disfunctions"&gt;[[control theory|Engineering control theory]] also makes use of [[Feed forward (control)|feedforward]], [[Model predictive control|predictive control]], and other functions that are not required to model the behavior of living organisms.&lt;/ref&gt; PCT also applies to nonliving [[Autonomic Systems|autonomic systems]].&lt;ref name="Byte"&gt;For an introduction, see the ''Byte'' articles on robotics and the article on the origins of purpose in this [http://www.livingcontrolsystems.com/intro_papers/bill_pct.html collection] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070604100935/http://www.livingcontrolsystems.com/intro_papers/bill_pct.html |date=4 June 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Dirty Energy Dilemma: What’s Blocking Clean Power in the United States''''' is a 2008 book by academic [[Benjamin K. Sovacool]], published by Praeger. In the book, Sovacool explores problems with the current U.S. electricity system and ways to overcome them.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin K. Sovacool (2008). ''The Dirty Energy Dilemma: What’s Blocking Clean Power in the United States'', [[Praeger Publishers]], Connecticut, {{ISBN|978-0-313-35540-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
In the first part of the book, Sovacool explores the problems with the current system of large-scale electricity generation being used in the United States, powered by [[fossil fuel]]s and [[nuclear power]] reactors. He identifies "The Big Four Energy Challenges" as rising fossil fuel costs, increasing pollution, inefficient and brittle transmission networks, as well as widespread system vulnerability to natural disasters, sabotage, and financial manipulations. "The Big Four Clean Solutions" of [[renewable energy]], [[efficient energy use]], distributed generation, and [[combined heat and power]] will do a better job of providing needed energy while protecting consumers and the planet.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Jones. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/technology_and_culture/summary/v051/51.3.jones.html The Dirty Energy Dilemma: What's Blocking Clean Power in the United States (review)] ''Technology and Culture'', Volume 51, Number 3, July 2010, pp. 746-748.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=scottv/&gt;

Sovacool suggests that the barriers to clean energy adoption are institutional, not technological, and he sees no role for nuclear power in a clean [[energy transition]].&lt;ref name=scottv&gt;Scott Victor Valentine.

The '''"Three Principles"''' of '''''Mind, Consciousness''''' and '''''Thought''''' were first articulated by [[Sydney Banks (philosopher)|Sydney Banks]], a 9th-grade educated welder, born in Scotland, living in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]] in the early 1970s. The Three Principles approach is also referred to as [[Health realization]].

== "Discovery" of the three principles ==
According to Banks' verbal accounts, as recorded at lectures, he realised the three principles while attending a marriage seminar held on [[Cortes Island]], in British Columbia, Canada.

The seminar encouraged couples to ''let their feelings out,'' be honest, and argue with one another. Discouraged with the process, Banks and his wife prepared to leave the seminar. As they were doing so, Banks became engaged in conversation with a therapist also attending the seminar.

Describing himself as ''an insecure mess'' at that time, Banks began elaborating on all the ways in which he felt insecure. The therapist's response, ''I've never heard such nonsense in all my life'', was a revelation to Banks:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''What I heard was: there’s no such thing as insecurity, it’s only Thought. All my insecurity was only my own thoughts! It was like a bomb going off in my head … It was so enlightening! It was unbelievable … [And after that,] there was such beauty coming into my life.&lt;ref&gt;"The Truth Lies Within," Part 2 of the "Long Beach Lecture Series, Lone Pine Publishing, Edmonton, Canada''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The three specific terms, Mind, Consciousness and Thought, were not clearly delineated during Banks' initial experience. The three words—and his definitions—would become clear later through his talks and lectures. Referring to them as ''the psychological trinity''&lt;ref&gt;Banks, Sydney, ''The Missing Link: Reflections on Philosophy and Spirit'', International Human Relations Consultants, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Banks does not take credit for finding the Principles, rather the Principles ''found him.'' {{Citation|date=January 2012}}

== Application ==
Roughly 40 years later, Mr. Banks' "insight" has been introduced in hospitals and hospital systems, correctional institutions, social services, juvenile justice programming, community housing, drug and alcohol prevention and treatment programmes, schools, and multi-national corporations.{{Citation|date=January 2012}}

Application of the Three Principles of Mind, Consciousness and Thought has spread throughout the [[United States]], and into [[Canada]], [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], [[Denmark]], [[Israel]], [[England]], [[South Africa]], [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]] and [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;See "threeprinciplesmovies.com"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
According to Banks, the three "formless" principles of Mind, Consciousness and Thought explain the entire range of human behaviour and feeling states. They are responsible for the creation of all human experience.&lt;ref&gt;Banks, Sydney, "The Missing Link: Reflections on Philosophy and Spirit," International Human Relations Consultants, Publishers, 1998. Distributed by Lone Pine Publishing, Edmonton. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The three principles are defined as:

=== Mind ===
The energy and intelligence of all life, whether in the form, or formless. The ''Universal Mind,'' or the ''impersonal mind,'' is constant and unchangeable. The ''personal mind'' is in a perpetual state of change.&lt;ref&gt;"The Missing Link," p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consciousness ===
''Consciousness'' is the gift of [[awareness]]. Consciousness allows the recognition of form, form being an expression of Thought.&lt;ref&gt;"The Missing Link," p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thought ===
The power of ''Thought'' is not self-created. Thought is a divine gift, which serves you immediately after you are born. Thought is the creative agent we use to direct us through life.&lt;ref&gt;"The Missing Link," p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

== Three Principles Movement ==
The Three Principles have become the basis of a growing, international psycho-spiritual movement with centers in the United States and Europe. The fundamental premise of the movement is that life is spiritually generated into form from formless energy, and that our experience as human beings is created from the interaction of the Three Principles; including the experience of self-identity.

Practitioners of the Three Principles believe that feeling states (and all mental states) are self-created (through mental activity ie.Thought). Scientific research by [[Lisa Feldman Barrett]] supports this notion that mental states (ie. emotions) are indeed constructed from within the human mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barrett|first=Lisa Feldman|date=2017-01-01|title=The theory of constructed emotion: an active inference account of interoception and categorization|url=https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/12/1/1/2823712|journal=Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience|language=en|volume=12|issue=1|pages=1–23|doi=10.1093/scan/nsw154|issn=1749-5016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Practitioners believe that beyond each person's limited, conscious, and personal thought system lies a vast reservoir of wisdom, insight and spiritual intelligence. No one person has greater access to spiritual wisdom than any other. Mental health is the resting state, or "default" setting of the mind, which brings with it non-contingent feelings of love, compassion, resilience, creativity and unity; both with others and with life itself.&lt;ref&gt;See books by practitioners, including Elsie Spittle, George Pransky, Roger Mills, Joseph Bailey, Jack Pransky, Richard Carlson, Ami Chen Mills-Naim, Robert Kausen&lt;/ref&gt; Research by [[George Bonanno|George Bonnano]],  professor of clinical psychology at Columbia University, supports this notion that resilience, not recovery is a common response to difficult life events such as trauma and loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bonanno|first=George A.|date=January 2004|title=Loss, trauma, and human resilience: have we underestimated the human capacity to thrive after extremely aversive events?|journal=The American Psychologist|volume=59|issue=1|pages=20–28|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.59.1.20|issn=0003-066X|pmid=14736317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It would be difficult to provide a comprehensive list of centers worldwide that are dedicated to sharing the Three Principles. However, some prominent organizations are the Center for Sustainable Change, Three Principles Foundation, Three Principles Movies, The Cypress Initiative and One Solution.

== Founder and Students ==
Banks, who died of metastasized [[cancer]] on [[Memorial Day]], in May 2009, contradicted many traditional notions and practices of psychotherapy. Specifically, that for mental wellbeing, it was not important to process the past, nor that the content of peoples' personal thought systems had to be "worked with" and analysed.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Everyone in mental institutions is sitting in the middle of mental health and they don't know it.&lt;ref&gt;"The Hawaii Lectures," DVD Series&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Banks was also averse to using techniques, or creating concepts, in order to share with others. These, he felt, contradicted the essential formless and original nature of the Three Principles, which emphasises kindness, "sharing, caring" and the simple gift of love.&lt;ref&gt;From tapes, lectures, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of therapists and psychologists showed an interest in the concepts, and the teachings were spread&lt;ref&gt;Oral and written testimonies from practitioners; Roger Mills' unpublished memoirs and Mills, R.C. and Spittle, E., "The Wisdom Within" pp. 16-25, Lone Pine Publishing, Edmonton, Canada, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; into various private practices, social services, corporate training and consulting, psychiatry, education, community mental health and development work, and drug and alcohol treatment systems.

== Notes on "Other Names" for the Three Principles ==
The Three Principles have been called by other names, including [[Health Realization]], neo-cognitive psychology, Psychology of Mind, and Innate Health. The form of how the Three Principles has been taught has changed over the decades, with an increasing emphasis on simplicity, formlessness, and speaking from the heart. Some would say that the Three Principles is not a "technique" that can be taught but instead a paradigm that comes to be understood at increasingly deeper levels.

'''Tracking the Wild''' is a [[social media]] platform built specifically for wildlife.&lt;ref name='Ventureburn'&gt;{{cite web|title= Meet Tracking the Wild: the social tool using crowdsourcing to help Africa’s wildlife|url= http://ventureburn.com/2015/01/wildlife-tracker/|date=5 Jan 2014|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The platform has a two-pronged approach. On the one hand, it is a social media tool to share wildlife sightings and provide a host of reserve specific information. On the other hand, the platform embraces [[crowdsourcing]] and [[citizen science]] to generate valuable wildlife sightings data for conservation research.&lt;ref name='Wild'&gt;{{cite web|title= New app tracks wildlife|url= http://www.wildcard.co.za/blog.htm?action=view-post&amp;id=5209|date=16 Jan 2014|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Development of Tracking the Wild started in [[Cape Town]] in early 2012 by husband and wife team John and Natalie White.&lt;ref name='Tracking the Wild'&gt;{{cite web|title= About Us|url= https://www.trackingthewild.com/about-us/|date=31 January 2015|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company officially launched in February 2014 with their website and Android app followed by the launch of their iPhone app in September 2014.&lt;ref name='Tracking the Wild iPhone App'&gt;{{cite web|title= Tracking the Wild on the App Store on iTunes|url= https://itunes.apple.com/za/app/tracking-the-wild/id907889551|date=31 January 2015|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Tracking the Wild Android App'&gt;{{cite web|title= Tracking the Wild – Android Apps on Google Play|url= https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.trackingthewild|date=31 January 2015|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participation==
The Tracking the Wild platform is based on the [[crowdsourcing]] of valuable wildlife sightings by [[citizen science]]. Tracking the Wild users submit their wildlife sightings in the form of images and/or video together with a sighting’s date and time, [[GPS]] location and species name. This [[open data]] is then incorporated into an online database and shared with wildlife researchers at the [[University of Cape Town]]’s [[Animal Demography Unit]] and other accredited conservation organisations.&lt;ref name='Bizcommunity'&gt;{{cite web|title=Wildlife social media platform launched|url= http://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/373/123411.html|date=31 January 2015|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protection of Endangered Species==
The platform has been built to exclude rhino sightings and restrict the location information for any species whose safety could be jeopardised by its location being made public. This can be managed on a park-by-park and individual species basis.&lt;ref name='ANN7'&gt;{{cite web|title= Rhinos spared from tracking device|url= http://www.ann7.com/article/24669-07012015rhinos-spared-from-tracking-device.html#.VM5oGJ2Ud8G|date=7 Jan 2014|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protected Areas Covered==
The Tracking the Wild platform currently covers over 40 national parks, nature reserves and game reserves across South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Swaziland and Zimbabwe.&lt;ref name='Tracking the Wild Parks'&gt;{{cite web|title= Tracking the Wild Parks|url= https://www.trackingthewild.com/parks/|date=16 July 2015|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14872">'''Two dimensional correlation analysis''' is a mathematical technique that is used to study changes in measured signals. As mostly [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] signals are discussed, sometime also '''two dimensional correlation spectroscopy''' is used and refers to the same technique.

In 2D correlation analysis, a sample is subjected to an external perturbation while all other parameters of the system are kept at the same value. This perturbation can be a systematic and controlled change in temperature, pressure, pH, chemical composition of the system, or even time after a [[catalyst]] was added to a chemical mixture. As a result of the controlled change (the ''perturbation''), the system will undergo variations which are measured by a chemical or physical detection method. The measured signals or spectra will show systematic variations that are processed with 2D correlation analysis for interpretation.

When one considers spectra that consist of few bands, it is quite obvious to determine which bands are subject to a changing intensity. Such a changing intensity can be caused for example by chemical reactions. However, the interpretation of the measured signal becomes more tricky when spectra are complex and bands are heavily overlapping. Two dimensional correlation analysis allows one to determine at which positions in such a measured signal there is a systematic change in a peak, either continuous rising or drop in intensity. 2D correlation analysis results in two complementary signals, which referred to as the 2D synchronous and 2D asynchronous spectrum. These signals allow amongst others&lt;ref name="Morita:2005"&gt;{{cite journal |title=New correlation indices invariant to band shifts in generalized two-dimensional correlation infrared spectroscopy |pages=251–257|doi=10.1016/j.cplett.2004.12.038 |author=Shin-Ichi Morita |author2=Yasuhiro F.

==History==
2D correlation analysis originated from [[Correlation spectroscopy|2D NMR spectroscopy]]. [[Isao Noda]] developed perturbation based 2D spectroscopy in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Noda:2004"/&gt; This technique required sinusoidal perturbations to the chemical system under investigation. This specific type of the applied perturbation severely limited its possible applications. Following research done by several groups of scientists, perturbation based 2D spectroscopy could be developed to a more extended and generalized broader base. Since the development of generalized 2D correlation analysis in 1993 based on [[Fourier transformation]] of the data, 2D correlation analysis gained widespread use. Alternative techniques that were simpler to calculate, for example the [[disrelation spectrum]], were also developed simultaneously. Because of its computational efficiency and simplicity, the [[Hilbert transform]] is nowadays used for the calculation of the 2D spectra. To date, 2D correlation analysis is used for the interpretation of many types of spectroscopic data (including [[X-ray fluorescence|XRF]], [[UV/VIS spectroscopy]], [[fluorescence spectroscopy|fluorescence]], [[infrared spectroscopy|infrared]], and [[Raman spectroscopy|Raman]] spectra), although its application is not limited to spectroscopy.

==Properties of 2D correlation analysis==
[[File:2DCorrelationDemoDataset.svg|300px|thumb|Demo dataset consisting of signals at specific intervals (1 out of 3 signals on a total of 15 signals is shown for clarity), peaks at 10 and 20 are rising in intensity whereas the peaks at 30 and 40 have a decreasing intensity]] 2D correlation analysis is frequently used for its main advantage: increasing the spectral resolution by spreading overlapping peaks over two dimensions and as a result simplification of the interpretation of one-dimensional spectra that are otherwise visually indistinguishable from each other.&lt;ref name="Noda:2004"/&gt; Further advantages are its ease of application and the possibility to make the distinction between band shifts and band overlap.&lt;ref name="Morita:2002"/&gt; Each type of spectral event, band shifting, overlapping bands of which the intensity changes in the opposite direction, band broadening, baseline change, etc. has a particular 2D pattern. See also the figure with the original dataset on the right and the corresponding 2D spectrum in the figure below.

==Presence of 2D spectra==
[[File:2DCorrelationSpectrumPresence.svg|300px|thumb|Schematic presence of a 2D correlation spectrum with peak positions represented by dots. Region A is the main diagonal containing autopeaks, off-diagonal regions B contain cross-peaks.]]2D synchronous and asynchronous spectra are basically 3D-datasets and are generally represented by contour plots. X- and y-axes are identical to the x-axis of the original dataset, whereas the different contours represent the magnitude of correlation between the spectral intensities. The 2D synchronous spectrum is symmetric relative to the main diagonal. The main diagonal thus contains positive peaks. As the peaks at (''x'',''y'') in the 2D synchronous spectrum are a measure for the correlation between the intensity changes at ''x'' and ''y'' in the original data, these main diagonal peaks are also called ''autopeaks'' and the main diagonal signal is referred to as ''[[autocorrelation]] signal''. The off-diagonal ''cross-peaks'' can be either positive or negative. On the other hand, the asynchronous spectrum is asymmetric and never has peaks on the main diagonal.

Generally contour plots of 2D spectra are oriented with rising axes from left to right and top to down. Other orientations are possible, but interpretation has to be adapted accordingly.&lt;ref name="Czarnik-Matusewitcz"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Potential pitfalls concerning visualization of the 2D results |pages=253–258 |author=Boguslawa Czarnik-Matusewicz |author2=Sylwia Pilorz |author3=Lorna Ashton |author4=Ewan W. Blanch |last-author-amp=yes |journal=Journal of Molecular Structure |date=2006 |volume=799 |issue=1–3 |doi=10.1016/j.molstruc.2006.03.064|bibcode = 2006JMoSt.799..253C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calculation of 2D spectra==
Suppose the original dataset '''D''' contains the ''n'' spectra in rows. The signals of the original dataset are generally preprocessed. The original spectra are compared to a reference spectrum. By subtracting a reference spectrum, often the average spectrum of the dataset, so called dynamic spectra are calculated which form the corresponding dynamic dataset ''E''. The presence and interpretation may be dependent on the choice of reference spectrum. The equations below are valid for equally spaced measurements of the perturbation.

===Calculation of the synchronous spectrum===
A 2D synchronous spectrum expresses the similarity between spectral of the data in the original dataset. In generalized 2D correlation spectroscopy this is mathematically expressed as [[covariance]] (or [[correlation]]).

:&lt;math&gt;\phi(\nu_1 , \nu_2) = \frac{1}{n-1} y^T(\nu_1) . y(\nu_2)&lt;/math&gt;

where:
*''Φ'' is the 2D synchronous spectrum
*''ν&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''ν&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' are two spectral channels
*''y&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the vector composed of the signal intensities in '''E''' in column ''ν''
*''n'' the number of signals in the original dataset

===Calculation of the asynchronous spectrum===
Orthogonal spectra to the dynamic dataset '''E''' are obtained with the Hilbert-transform:

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(\nu_1 , \nu_2) = \frac{1}{n-1} y^T(\nu_1) . N . y(\nu_2)&lt;/math&gt;

where:
*''Ψ'' is the 2D asynchronous spectrum
*''ν&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' en ''ν&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' are two spectral channels
*''y&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the vector composed of the signal intensities in '''E''' in column ''ν''
*''n'' the number of signals in the original dataset
*'''N''' the Noda-Hilbert transform matrix

The values of '''N''', ''N&lt;sub&gt;j, k&lt;/sub&gt;'' are determined as follows:
*0 if j = k
*&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\pi (k - j)}&lt;/math&gt; if j ≠ k

where:
*''j'' the row number
*''k'' the column number

==Interpretation==
Interpretation of two-dimensional correlation spectra can be considered to consist of several stages.&lt;ref name="Noda:2004"&gt;{{cite book |title=Two-Dimensional Correlation Spectroscopy - Applications in Vibrational and Optical Spectroscopy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5nE7_D_ppr8C&amp;printsec=frontcover|isbn=978-0-471-62391-5 |author=Isao Noda |author2=Yukihiro Ozaki |last-author-amp=yes |date=2004 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Detection of peaks of which the intensity changes in the original dataset===
[[File:2DCorrelationSpectrumAC.svg|300px|thumb|Autocorrelation signal on the main diagonal of the synchronous 2D spectrum of the figure below (arbitrary axis units)]]As real measurement signals contain a certain level of noise, the derived 2D spectra are influenced and degraded with substantial higher amounts of noise. Hence, interpretation begins with studying the autocorrelation spectrum on the main diagonal of the 2D synchronous spectrum. In the 2D synchronous main diagonal signal on the right 4 peaks are visible at 10, 20, 30, and 40 (see also the 4 corresponding positive autopeaks in the 2D synchronous spectrum on the right). This indicates that in the original dataset 4 peaks of changing intensity are present. The intensity of peaks on the autocorrelation spectrum are directly proportional to the relative importance of the intensity change in the original spectra. Hence, if an intense band is present at position ''x'', it is very likely that a true intensity change is occurring and the peak is not due to noise.

Additional techniques help to filter the peaks that can be seen in the 2D synchronous and asynchronous spectra.&lt;ref name="Buchet:2001"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Selecting two-dimensional cross-correlation functions to enhance interpretation of near-infrared spectra of proteins |pages=155–162 |author=R. Buchet, Y. Wu|author2=G. Lachenal |author3=C. Raimbault |author4=Yukihiro Ozaki |last-author-amp=yes |journal=Applied Spectroscopy |date=2006 |volume=55 |issue=2 |doi=10.1366/0003702011951452|bibcode = 2001ApSpe..55..155B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Determining the direction of intensity change===
[[File:2DCorrelationSpectrum.svg|300px|thumb|Example of a two-dimensional correlation spectrum. Open circles in this simplified view represent positive peaks, while discs represent negative peaks]]It is not always possible to unequivocally determine the direction of intensity change, such as is for example the case for highly overlapping signals next to each other and of which the intensity changes in the opposite direction. This is where the off diagonal peaks in the synchronous 2D spectrum are used for:

#if there is a positive cross-peak at (''x'', ''y'') in the synchronous 2D spectrum, the intensity of the signals at ''x'' and ''y'' changes in the same direction
#if there is a negative cross-peak at (''x'', ''y'') in the synchronous 2D spectrum, the intensity of the signals at ''x'' and ''y'' changes in the opposite direction

As can be seen in the 2D synchronous spectrum on the right, the intensity changes of the peaks at 10 and 30 are related and the intensity of the peak at 10 and 30 changes in the opposite direction (negative cross-peak at (10,30)). The same is true for the peaks at 20 and 40.

===Determining the sequence of events===
Most importantly, with the ''sequential order rules'', also referred to as ''Noda's rules'', the sequence of the intensity changes can be determined.&lt;ref name="Noda:2004"/&gt; By carefully interpreting the signs of the 2D synchronous and asynchronous cross peaks with the following rules, the sequence of spectral events during the experiment can be determined:

#if the intensities of the bands at ''x'' and ''y'' in the dataset are changing in the same direction, the synchronous 2D cross peak at (''x'',''y'') is positive
#if the intensities of the bands at ''x'' and ''y'' in the dataset are changing in the opposite direction, the synchronous 2D cross peak at (''x'',''y'') is negative
#if the change at x mainly precedes the change in the band at ''y'', the asynchronous 2D cross peak at (''x'',''y'') is positive
#if the change at x mainly follows the change in the band at ''y'', the asynchronous 2D cross peak at (''x'',''y'') is negative
#if the synchronous 2D cross peak at (''x'',''y'') is negative, the interpretation of rule 3 and 4 for the asynchronous 2D peak at (''x'',''y'') has to be reversed

:where ''x'' and ''y'' are the positions on the x-xaxis of two bands in the original data that are subject to intensity changes.

Following the rules above. It can be derived that the changes at 10 and 30 occur simultaneously and the changes in intensity at 20 and 40 occur simultaneously as well. Because of the positive asynchronous cross-peak at (10, 20), the changes at 10 and 30 (predominantly) occur before the intensity changes at 20 and 40.

It should be noted that in some cases the Noda rules cannot be so readily implied, predominately when spectral features are not caused by simple intensity variations.  This may occur when band shifts occur, or when a very erratic intensity variation is present in a given frequency range.

'''''Vectors in three-dimensional space''''' (1978) is a book concerned with [[physical quantities]] defined in "ordinary" [[3-space]].  It was written by [[John Stephen Roy Chisholm|J.S.R.Chisholm]], an English [[mathematical physicist]], and published by [[Cambridge University Press]].  According to the author, such [[physical quantities]] are studied in [[Newtonian mechanics]], [[fluid mechanics]], theories of [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] and [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]], non-relativistic [[quantum mechanics]], and many parts of [[solid state physics]].  The author further states that "the vector concept developed in two different ways: in a wide variety of physical applications, vector notation and techniques became, by the middle of this century, almost universal; on the other hand, pure mathematicians reduced vector algebra to an axiomatic system, and introduced wide [[generalization|generalisations]] of the concept of a three-dimensional 'vector space'."  Chisholm explains that since these two developments proceeded largely independently, there is a need to show how one can be applied to the other.&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm, J.S.R. (1978) p. vii-viii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
''Vectors in three-dimensional space'' has six chapters, each divided into five or more subsections. The first on '''[[Vector space|linear spaces]] and [[displacement (vector)|displacements]]''' including these sections: Introduction, Scalar multiplication of vectors, Addition and subtraction of vectors, Displacements in Euclidean space, Geometrical applications.  The second on '''[[dot product|Scalar products]] and components''' including these sections: Scalar products, [[Linear dependence]] and dimension, Components of a vector, Geometrical applications, [[Coordinate system]]s.  The third on '''Other products of vectors'''.  The last three chapters round out Chisholm's integration of these two largely independent developments.

The '''Vega Science Trust''' was a [[not-for-profit]] organisation which provided a platform from which [[scientists]] can communicate directly with the public on [[science]] by using [[moving image]], sound and other related means. The Trust closed in 2012 but the website and streaming video remains active (based at Sheffield University).

== History ==
Founded in 1995 by [[Nobel Laureate]] [[Sir Harry Kroto]] and [[BBC]] Education Producer Patrick Reams the Vega Science Trust was awarded a [[Committee on the Public Understanding of Science|COPUS]] start-up grant from the [[Royal Society]] in 1995 and then went on in 1999 to be allocated core funding from the [[Office of Science and Technology]] (OST).  Starting with recording science programmes for terrestrial television the Vega Science Trust produced a number of programmes such as recordings of [[Royal Institution]] Discources&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vega.org.uk/video/subseries/12/ Royal Institution Discourse Recordings]&lt;/ref&gt; which were broadcast on [[BBC 2]] and a set of Masterclasses.  In 2001 Harry Kroto was awarded the Royal Society Michael Faraday Prize - the UK's premier award for science communication&lt;ref&gt;[http://royalsociety.org/Michael-Faraday-Prize/ The Royal Society Michael Faraday Prize]&lt;/ref&gt; 'for his dedication to the notion of working scientists being communicators of their work and in particular for his establishment of the Vega Science Trust whose films and related activities reflect the excitement of scientific discovery to the public'.  The Trust went on to co-produce with the BBC [[Open University]] a set of science discussion programmes covering hot topics such as [[Stem Cells]], [[Energy]], [[Mobile Phones]], [[GM Food]], [[Disease]], [[Nanotechnology]] and [[Ageing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://vega.org.uk/video/series/2 The Next Big Thing Recordings]&lt;/ref&gt;  With the BBC/Open University the Trust also produced with sponsorship from [[HEFCE]] Widening Participation Team a set of award-winning&lt;ref&gt;[http://bufvc.ac.uk/events/learningonscreen Learning on Screen Awards]&lt;/ref&gt; career programmes featuring young scientists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vega.org.uk/video/series/10 Snapshots Young Scientist Career Recordings]&lt;/ref&gt;  Both series were broadcast on BBC2.

Very early audio-visual recordings of individual scientists are relatively rare but in the recent past some recordings were  carried out by such organisations as the BBC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/scientists/ BBC Interviews with Scientists 1985]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1997 the Vega Science Trust embarked on a plan to record in-depth interviews with scientists such as [[Joseph Rotblat|Rotblat]], [[Frederick Sanger|Sanger]], [[Perutz]], [[Cornforth]], [[Walter Kohn]] and [[Richard R. Ernst|Richard Ernst]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vega.org.uk/video/series/1 Face-to-Face Interviews with Scientists]&lt;/ref&gt; which could be both viewed and preserved as an historical record for the future.  More recently the [[British Library]] embarked on a similar project of recording audio-visual interviews under the National Life Stories project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/nls British Library National Life Stories]&lt;/ref&gt; although at present their archive consists of oral recordings of scientists.  The Vega Science Trust's in-depth interviews with scientists led onto a project recording interviews with Nobel Laureates&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vega.org.uk/video/series/4 Nobel Interviews]&lt;/ref&gt; attending the annual [[Nobel Laureate Meetings at Lindau]] in 2004/5/6.  In 2006 the Vega Science Trust's website received a special mention at The International Association for Media Science&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.media-in-science.org/ The International Association for Media Science]&lt;/ref&gt; Awards.

In 2007 the Vega Science Trust started on-going work with [[Jonathan Hare]] BBC [[Rough Science]] on a series of short instructional films&lt;ref&gt;[http://vega.org.uk/video/subseries/27 Instructional Mini Films by Jonathan Hare]&lt;/ref&gt; intended to show how things work.  For instance a number of the films show how we can generate [[electricity]], another shows how we can generate [[wind power]], others the [[molecular]] structure of [[Buckminsterfullerene|C60]], carbon [[Carbon nanotube|nanotube]]s and [[graphene]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanowerk.com/news/newsid=19146.php Article Nanowerk on Graphene modules]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2007-2010 the Trust concentrated on bringing to the public's attention the process of science research.  The Nano2Hybrids&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nano2hybrids.net/ Nano2hybrids website]&lt;/ref&gt; EU [[STReP]] project for instance was an innovative project where research scientists recorded their own progress on a research project to invent a gas sensor made using carbon nanotubes.  In addition recording science in society projects such as Women in Nanotechnology&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.womeninnano.de/ Women in Nanotechnology]&lt;/ref&gt; and Diversity&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diversity-fp7.eu/ Diversity Project]&lt;/ref&gt; illuminate work&lt;ref&gt;[http://vega.org.uk/video/programme/198 Women in Nanotechnology film]&lt;/ref&gt; towards promoting women scientists into decision making positions in science research environments.

The Vega Science Trust closed in March 2012 after 17 years of operation. However, the website will continue to host the existing film archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.vega.org.uk/news/details/8|title = Latest News|date = |accessdate = 17 April 2015|website = The Vega Science Trust|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance ==
The Vega Science Trust was governed by a board of five [[Trustee]]s who are active research scientists, media, copyright, and educational specialists. Trustees step down and/or are re-elected each year.

The Vega Science Trust employed one member of staff (and for a period, a second technical member) and operated in a mixed economy of core grant-in-aid support from [[Florida State University]], and from [[research grant]]s and [[sponsorship]]. It was an independent body with its own self-contained offices, initially in the University of Sussex chemistry department, and later at the Innovation Centre, [[University of Sussex]], [[Brighton]].

== Vision ==

The Vega Science Trust aimed to see science more fully integrated into our everyday culture. Vega's vision has been to do so by providing a platform from which scientists can broadcast science programmes directly to the public.

'''Activities'''

* Recording scientists.
:Covering a wide array of research.
* Making available to the public by streaming from the Vega Science Trust's website.
:Videos stream in different formats.
* Creating an historical archive of some of the world's most eminent scientists.
:Interviewing Nobel Laureates and other eminent scientists.
* Experimenting with new ways of outreaching/engaging with the public via audio-visual means.
:Creating different programme formats.
* Provide on-line science resources for school, university and the public via informal learning.
:Creating informative videos for inparting scientific concepts.

'''Vega Science Trust Collection'''

The collection of recordings also acts as an historical record and archive of world scientists and their research discoveries.  Recorded to broadcast quality they provide a valuable collection, much of which is open to the public via the Vega Science Trust's website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vega.org.uk/ Vega Science Trust's website]&lt;/ref&gt;
