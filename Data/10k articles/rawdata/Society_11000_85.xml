      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7173">The '''2005 Hong Kong electoral reform''' was carried out in late 2005 for the selection of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong]] (CE) in 2007 and [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] (LegCo) in 2008. The reform proposals were ultimately voted down by the [[pro-democracy camp]].&lt;ref name="Fong"/&gt;

==Background==
The  [[Hong Kong Special Administrative Region]] established in 1997 was governed by the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], the "mini-constitution" of the region. The Basic Law set out the selecting method of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong]] (CE) for the first two terms and the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] (LegCo) for the first three terms. The selection method of the CE and LegCo was left blank for the [[Hong Kong Chief Executive election, 2007|2007 Chief Executive]] and [[Hong Kong legislative election, 2008|2008 Legislative Council]] elections. [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 45]] promised that "the ultimate aim is the selection of the Chief Executive by [[universal suffrage]]" while Article 68 stipulated that "the ultimate aim is the election of all members of the Legislative Council by universal suffrage".

The politics of the constitutional reforms have dominated Hong Kong agenda since the handover, as the [[pro-democracy camp|pro-democrats]] demanded all along an early implementation of universal suffrage for the CE and LegCo elections.&lt;ref name="Fong"&gt;{{cite book|title= Hong Kong’s Governance Under Chinese Sovereignty: The Failure of the State-Business Alliance After 1997|first=Brian C. H.|last=Fong|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 April 2004, the [[National People's Congress Standing Committee]] (NPCSC) reached a verdict stating that the elections of the 2007 CE and 2008 LegCo would not be returned by universal suffrage, thereby defeating the democrats' appeal for 2007/08 universal suffrage.&lt;ref name="Fong"/&gt;

==2005 blueprint==
In March 2005, the unpopular [[Tung Chee-hwa]] resigned as Chief Executive, citing health reasons. [[Chief Secretary for Administration]] [[Donald Tsang]] succeeded in an [[Hong Kong Chief Executive election, 2005|uncontested election]] with the controversy over NPCSC's constitutional interpretation.

On 28 October, the [[First term of Donald Tsang as Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Donald Tsang administration]] announced a blueprint for reforming the 2007/08 methods.&lt;ref name="Fong"/&gt; The Fifth Report of the Task Force on Constitutional Development proposed limited reforms to the electoral methods for the 2007 and 2008 CE elections as constrained by the April 2004 NPCSC verdict.&lt;ref name="Cheng"/&gt;

The report proposed to expand the 800-member [[Election Committee]] to 1,600, in the process of which including all 529 [[District Councils of Hong Kong|District Councillors]], including the appointed members by the government, in order to widen the base of the indirect electorate. The government also proposed to add 10 seats to the 2008 LegCo, with five directly-elected through [[geographical constituencies]] and five [[functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]] elected by District Councillors. The government claimed that this was the best deal they could muster given the constraints of the NPCSC verdict.&lt;ref name="Cheng"/&gt;

==LegCo voting==
According to Annex I and II of the Basic Law, an amendment of the electoral methods of CE and LegCo requires the consent of two-thirds majority of the LegCo, which means the 25 pro-democrats in the LegCo could veto the proposal if they vote ''en bloc'' against it.&lt;ref name="Cheng"/&gt;

Initially, the mainstream democrats, represented by the [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Article 45 Concern Group]] which combined for 12 votes in the legislature indicated their willingness to approve the proposal on the condition that the 159 appointed members of the District Councils would be excluded in the expanded Election Committee. Many in the pro-democracy were ready to approve the proposal if the amendment be made, which included the Article 45 Concern Group. Although hardliners in the camp refused to make any concession&lt;ref name="Poon"&gt;{{cite book|first=Kit|last=Poon|title=The Political Future of Hong Kong: Democracy Within Communist China|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|pages=76–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following weeks, the political winds shifted abruptly to a radical direction.&lt;ref name="Poon"/&gt; The radical wing stepped up the call for full democracy by launching a signature campaign in newspapers. A dozen political parties and civil groups began for another mass rally just before the voting on the proposal. On 4 November, several democratic leaders met with religious leaders Bishop [[Joseph Zen]] and Reverend [[Chu Yiu-ming]] who persuaded them to vote ''en bloc'' against the government proposal. A week later, a [[Tell me (advertisement)|political advertisement]] appeared on front pages of several newspapers showing a sandglass in black background with one written phrase: "Tell me, would I live to see universal suffrage?", addressed by "a 78-year-old man."&lt;ref name="Cheng"/&gt;

As a result, the pro-democrats raised their stakes by demanding a clear road and timetable to full democracy. The claimed to veto the proposal unless the appointment system in the District Councils was abolished and a clear road map and timetable were offered.&lt;ref name="Cheng"/&gt; The representatives from the NPCSC and [[Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office]] (HKMAO) invited social notables and legislators from the Article 45 Concern Group to a meeting but was turned down by the group. The Chief Executive also repeatedly appealed to the public for support on television and radio programmes.&lt;ref name="Poon"/&gt;

The democrats launched [[December 2005 protest for democracy in Hong Kong|a rally on 4 December demanding universal suffrage]] drew estimated 100,000 people. The high turnout strengthened the cause of the democrats to veto the proposal. On 21 December 2005, the proposal was turned down with 24 democrats voted ''en bloc'' against it, although there were continuing rumours that some might switch their position and supported it, except for [[Lau Chin-shek]] who abstained.&lt;ref name="Cheng"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in Its First Decade|pages=64–8|first=Joseph Y. S. |last=Cheng|publisher=City University of HK Press|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinion polling==
A survey in late October 2005 showed that 58.8% of respondents accepted the government proposals while 23.6% disapproved, although 66% of the respondents supported a timetable for full democracy in the reform proposal . After the 3 December rally, a survey showed 49.9% accepted the proposal.&lt;ref name="Cheng"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Poon"/&gt;

On 23 December 2006 and 3 January 2007, [[Tunisia]]n security forces engaged in clashes with members of a group with connections to the Islamist terror group [[Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat]] (GSPC) in the towns of [[Soliman, Tunisia|Soliman]] and [[Hammam-Lif]] south of the capital [[Tunis]], killing more than a dozen people.&lt;ref name="weekly"&gt;http://www.weeklystandard.com/terror-in-the-maghreb/article/14408&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-17308138&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clashes==
On 23 December, two Islamists were killed and two arrested in a shootout with police in the town of Hammam-Lif south of Tunis.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/14/world/africa/14tunisia.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 January, at least two members of Tunisian security forces and twelve Islamists were killed, and fifteen arrested in a clash in a forested area near Soliman.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jan/13/world/fg-briefs13.3&lt;/ref&gt; 

Among those killed was the leader of the group, Lassaad Sassi, a former Tunisian policeman who had spent time in [[Afghanistan]] and headed a terror network based in [[Milan]], [[Italy]]. Sassi's group had reportedly established training camps in the mountains in [[Djebel Ressas]] and [[Boukornine National Park|Boukornine]] south of the Tunisian capital.&lt;ref name="iss"&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Anneli|last=Botha|title=Chapter 4: Terrorism in Tunisia|url=https://issafrica.org/chapter-4-terrorism-in-tunisia|publisher=Institute for Security Studies|date=June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to French daily ''[[Le Parisien]]'' at least 60 people were killed in the clashes.&lt;ref name="weekly"/&gt; It was later revealed that the Islamists had been in possession of blueprints of foreign embassies as possible targets.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt; The attacks were the most serious by Islamists in Tunisia since the [[Ghriba synagogue bombing]] in 2002.&lt;ref name="weekly"/&gt;

&lt;!--- Do not add wikipedia's own bolded title per WP:MOSTITLE---&gt;On 12 August 2015, a series of explosions killed 173 people and injured hundreds of others at a [[Intermodal container|container]] storage station at the [[Port of Tianjin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/2015s-biggest-insured-disasters/ 2015's biggest insured disasters] 30 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The first two explosions occurred within 30 seconds of each other at the facility, which is located in the [[Binhai]] New Area of [[Tianjin]], China.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; The second explosion was far larger and involved the detonation of about 800 tonnes of [[ammonium nitrate]].&lt;ref name="Huang&amp;Zhang2015"&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 34| issue = 4| pages = 313–314| last1 = Huang| first1 = Ping| last2 = Zhang| first2 = Jingyuan| title = Facts related to August 12, 2015 explosion accident in Tianjin, China| journal = Process Safety Progress| accessdate = 20 December 2015|year = 2015| url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/prs.11789/full}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fires caused by the initial explosions continued to burn uncontrolled throughout the weekend, resulting in eight additional explosions on August 15.

The cause of the explosions was not immediately known,&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; but an investigation concluded in February 2016 that an overheated container of dry [[nitrocellulose]] was the cause of the initial explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://cen.acs.org/articles/94/web/2016/02/Chinese-Investigators-Identify-Cause-Tianjin.html | publisher = [[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]] | title = Chinese Investigators Identify Cause of Tianjin Explosion | date = 8 February 2016 | quote = The immediate cause of the accident was the spontaneous ignition of overly dry nitrocellulose stored in a container that overheated}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Censored news coverage of the event and the emergency response to it received criticism.&lt;ref name = hkfp1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ibi1 /&gt; The Chinese government also censored the internet and social media using the words "Tianjin" and "explosion",&lt;ref name="custer" /&gt; and announced it had taken down multiple websites for publishing "false" information.&lt;ref name=rsf /&gt;

The final casualty report was 165 deaths, 8 missing, and 798 non-fatal injuries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gov.cn/foot/2016-02/05/5039788/files/460731d8cb4c4488be3bb0c218f8b527.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Tianjin Dongjiang Port Ruihai International Logistics ({{lang|zh|天津东疆保税港区瑞海国际物流有限公司}}), or Ruihai Logistics ({{lang|zh|瑞海物流}}), is a privately held logistics company established in 2011. It handles [[hazardous chemicals]] within the [[Port of Tianjin]], such as [[flammable]] &amp; [[corrosive]] substances, [[oxidizing agents]], and toxic chemicals. The company, which employed 70, is designated by the [[China Maritime Safety Administration|Tianjin Maritime Safety Administration]] ({{lang|zh|天津海事局}}) as an approved agent for handling these hazardous chemicals at the port,&lt;ref name="AutoVH-1" /&gt; and its operating license was renewed two months prior to the explosions.&lt;ref name=apple20150815 /&gt; Its {{convert |46000|m2|sqft| adj=on}} site contains multiple warehouses for hazardous goods, a fire pump and a fire pond.&lt;ref name="AutoVH-2" /&gt;

The warehouse building, owned by Ruihai Logistics, is recorded in a 2014 government document as being a hazardous chemical storage facility for [[calcium carbide]], [[sodium nitrate]], and [[potassium nitrate]].&lt;ref name="20150813southernweek" /&gt; Safety regulations requiring that public buildings and facilities should be at least 1 kilometre away were not followed, and local inhabitants were unaware of the danger.&lt;ref name=apple20150815 /&gt;&lt;ref name= unknown /&gt; The authorities stated that poor record keeping, damage to the office facilities and "major discrepancies" with customs meant that they were unable to identify the substances stored.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; State media revealed that Ruihai had only received its authorisation to handle dangerous chemicals less than two months earlier, meaning that it had been operating illegally from October 2014, when its temporary license had expired, to June 2015.&lt;ref name="20150818xinhuanet" /&gt;&lt;ref name=20150818GUARD /&gt;

== Explosions ==
The first reports of a fire at a warehouse in the Binhai New Area began coming in at around 22:50 local time (14:50 UTC) on 12 August. The first responders were unable to keep the fire from spreading. Firefighters who first arrived on the scene proceeded to douse the fire with water as they were unaware that dangerous chemicals were stored on the site, thereby setting in motion a series of more violent chemical reactions.&lt;ref name="apple20150815" /&gt;&lt;ref name=20150813southernweek /&gt;

At around 23:30 (15:30 UTC), the 1st explosion occurred and registered as a magnitude 2.3 earthquake,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-33901206|title=China explosions: Tianjin blasts 'on seismic scale'|date=13 August 2015|publisher=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; generating seismic shock-waves energetically equivalent to 2.9 tonnes of [[TNT equivalent|TNT]]. After 30 seconds, a 2nd more powerful explosion occurred, causing most of the damage and injuries with shock-waves felt many kilometres away. The second explosion registered as a magnitude 2.9 earthquake and generated seismic shock-waves with energy equivalent to 21.9 tonnes of TNT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-33901206|title=China explosions: Tianjin blasts 'on seismic scale'|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/12/explosion-in-tianjin-china.html|title=Death toll in China's Tianjin explosion rises to 50: Reports|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-33844084|title=China explosions: What we know about what happened in Tianjin|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting fireballs reached hundreds of meters in height.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; Around 23:40 (15:40&amp;nbsp;UTC) on 15 August, a series of eight smaller explosions occurred in the port as fire from the original blasts continued to spread.&lt;ref name="AutoVH-3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoVH-4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IBT0815" /&gt; The total energy release was equivalent to 28 tonnes of TNT, or 100GJ.

The explosion was large enough to be photographed by [[Himawari (satellite)|Himawari]], a geostationary meteorological satellite operated by the [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] (JMA).&lt;ref name="AutoVH-5" /&gt; Chinese scientists subsequently estimated that the second more powerful explosion involved the detonation of about 800 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, based on crater size and lethality radius.&lt;ref name="Huang&amp;Zhang2015" /&gt;

One month after the explosion, official reports listed 173 deaths and 797 injuries.&lt;ref name="guardiandeath" /&gt;&lt;ref name="xinhuanet2" /&gt; Media reported the area to be densely populated, with around 5,600 families living within 1.5&amp;nbsp;km radius of the plant, the closest being only 600&amp;nbsp;m away.&lt;ref name=apple20150815 /&gt;&lt;ref name="20150817guancha" /&gt; Neither the developers nor the buyers were aware of the latent dangers of the activities at the nearby site; developers claimed also to be victims.&lt;ref name=20150817guancha /&gt;&lt;ref name=20150815NYTjacobs /&gt; According to the Tianjin government, more than 700 people were injured by the explosion,&lt;ref name="reut" /&gt; many with extensive injuries, mostly from [[burn]]s and [[explosive blast injuries]]. Over a thousand firefighters were on scene, and 95 were killed.&lt;ref name="SohuNews3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sina3" /&gt; One surviving firefighter, a 19-year-old named Zhou Ti ({{lang|zh |周倜}}), was found on the morning of 14 August.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The death toll of the incident, which also included 11 police officers, was the worst for Chinese front line responders since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949.&lt;ref name="Firehouse" /&gt;&lt;ref name="20150822indianexpress" /&gt;

=== Damage ===

Apartment blocks {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the site sustained shattered glass, loss of roof tiles and damage to ceilings – with 17,000 units being affected.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="201502atlantic" /&gt; Nearby [[Donghai Road Station]] suffered severe damage as a result of the explosions and was closed indefinitely, as was the rest of [[Line 9, Tianjin Metro|Line 9 of the Tianjin Metro]] beginning on 13 August.&lt;ref name="AutoVH-8" /&gt; A Japanese department store four kilometres away reported damage to walls and ceilings.&lt;ref name="AutoVH-9" /&gt; The explosions also affected the [[National Supercomputing Center of Tianjin]] several kilometres away, knocking out windows and causing some internal ceilings to collapse; the center's supercomputer [[Tianhe-I|Tianhe-1A]] itself was not damaged.&lt;ref name="AutoVH-10" /&gt;

=== Cause ===
It is not known what chemicals were being stored at the site.&lt;ref name=unknown /&gt; In addition to vast quantities of [[sodium cyanide]] and [[calcium carbide]], paperwork was discovered showing that 800 tonnes of [[ammonium nitrate]] and 500 tonnes of [[potassium nitrate]] were at the blast site.&lt;ref name="20150818GUARD" /&gt; On 17 August, the deputy director of the [[Chinese public security bureau|public security bureau]]'s fire department told [[China Central Television|CCTV]]: {{quote|Over 40 kinds of hazardous chemicals [were stored on site]. As far as we know, there were ammonium nitrate and potassium nitrate. According to what we know so far, all together there should have been around 3,000 tonnes.&lt;ref name="20150818hongkongfp" /&gt;}}

Ammonium nitrate, which is principally used in manufacturing fertilizer, has been implicated in a number of [[Ammonium nitrate disasters|other fatal industrial explosions]]. A fire department spokesman confirmed that firefighters had used water in combating the initial fire, which may have led to water being sprayed on calcium carbide, releasing the highly flammable gas [[acetylene]]. This would have provided the fuel source for reaction with the oxidiser, ammonium nitrate and consequently detonate.&lt;ref name="Time Chemicals" /&gt;

=== Pollution ===

At least 700 tonnes of highly toxic [[sodium cyanide]] was stored at the site – 70 times the legal limit.&lt;ref name=20150816GUARDIANfergus /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoVH-11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="20150816NBC" /&gt; Sodium cyanide leakage was reported in the sewer.&lt;ref name="AutoVH-12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoVH-13" /&gt; On 13 August, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, all of which are toxic, were detected within {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=on}} of the origin of the explosion, but the levels conformed with the national standards. The government maintained that gases were undetectable {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the site during initial testing on 14 August.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

With the first rains after the initial explosions, coming on 18 August, white chemical foam covered the streets. Citizens complained of burning sensations and rashes on sensitive skin parts after coming into contact with rain droplets. However, meteorologists sought to reassure the public that the rain was not directly harmful to health, whilst the Environment Protection Board advised against exposure to the rain due to traces of cyanide dust reacting with water.&lt;ref name="20150818ibtimes" /&gt;

Thousands of dead [[stickleback]]s washed up on the banks 6&amp;nbsp;km from the explosion site on 20 August, fuelling fears of water contamination. Officials downplayed the fears, saying that there were not high levels of cyanide in the river and that the fish likely died due to oxygen depletion in the water.&lt;ref name="20150820theguardian" /&gt;

Rain on 25 August 2015 in the Binhai New Area brought more complaints of skin burns from volunteers and journalists. A bright white foam also appeared on the streets. Deng Xiaowen, director of Tianjin's environmental monitoring centre, questionably stated that the foam was "a normal phenomenon when rain falls, and similar things have occurred before".&lt;ref name="20150826scmp" /&gt;

== Immediate aftermath ==
[[File:Tianjin explosion scene (4).jpg|thumb|Two [[Security guard|security inspectors]] wearing [[dust mask]]s near the [[barricade tape]] off the scene]]
On Thursday morning, the Chinese leaders ordered officers in the city to “make full effort in rescuing the injured, and search for those missing,” according to The Paper. Xi Jinping, the president of China, also said police should investigate the cause of the incident and punish those responsible for the blast.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hongkongfp.com/2015/08/13/cnn-local-chinese-media-struggle-to-report-on-tianjin-explosion/&lt;/ref&gt;

Tianjin officials, initially concerned at public response, announced that 14 people had perished in the explosions, but were forced to raise the death toll to 44 once the scale of the explosions became clear. The ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' (SCMP) cited a Tianjin police source that officers had been instructed to remove bodies from the scene to deliberately understate the official death toll.&lt;ref name="wsws" /&gt;

The morning following the explosion military personnel began to arrive in Tianjin to help with the search and recovery efforts. Extra equipment, such as bulldozers, were brought in to help with the clean-up operation. Over 200 nuclear and biochemical experts, including a team from the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], began arriving in Tianjin to assess the health risks from the chemicals being released into the atmosphere. Government personnel set up twelve temporary monitoring stations near the blast site with above-normal levels of pollutants being detected. A nearby drainage outlet was also closed, and water quality tested.&lt;ref name="20150813chinadaily" /&gt;

Firefighting was suspended on the afternoon of 13 August due to the uncertainty of the content and quantity of hazardous materials being stored on site. A team of over 200 chemical specialists was deployed to the site to assess the hazardous materials on site and dangers to the environment, and to determine the best way to put out the remaining fires and proceed with search and rescue and clean-up operations.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Later that day, rescue personnel were dispatched in an attempt to remove the 700 tonnes of sodium cyanide believed to be stored at the site, with [[hydrogen peroxide]] being prepared to neutralise the chemicals.&lt;ref name="BBC#2" /&gt; Daily press conferences were organised. A press conference organised by local officials held on 14 August came to an abrupt end when a journalist began asking questions as to why such dangerous chemicals were stockpiled so near to housing estates.&lt;ref name="20150815NYTjacobs" /&gt;

Initially, more than 3,500 area residents were staying in temporary shelters,&lt;ref name="BBC#2" /&gt; but the number surpassed six thousand within three days.&lt;ref name="ABC News" /&gt; The government issued an evacuation order over concerns of further explosions; not all residents complied.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Several hours after the initial blast, at 3:30&amp;nbsp;am on 13 August, Tianjin mayor and acting Communist Party Secretary [[Huang Xingguo]] arrived at [[TEDA Hospital]] to visit injured victims. Shortly thereafter, [[Guo Shengkun]], the [[Ministry of Public Security (China)|Minister of Public Security]], visited the blast site in Tianjin and called for all-out efforts to save lives.&lt;ref name="AutoVH-14" /&gt; The next few days saw more senior officials visit the explosion site, including Vice-Premier [[Liu Yandong]], Vice-Premier [[Ma Kai]], and Premier [[Li Keqiang]] accompanied by State Councilor [[Yang Jing]].&lt;ref name="baozha" /&gt;

On 15 August, local authorities ordered the evacuation of residents within a {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} radius of the blast site, prompted by the threat of "toxic substances",&lt;ref name="bbc._Chin" /&gt; including [[sodium cyanide]].&lt;ref name="IBT0815" /&gt;

The State Council ordered inspections of all businesses using dangerous chemicals and explosives across the country.&lt;ref name="unknown" /&gt;&lt;ref name=20150816GUARDIANfergus /&gt;

== Company ownership ==
Hong Kong media announced that Li Liang, the major shareholder – owning 55%, was the nephew of former chairman of the CPPCC National Committee [[Li Ruihuan]], who had been de facto leader of the Tianjin clique, and that the company may have been named after his brother and Li Liang's father;&lt;ref name=apple20150815 /&gt; the remaining 45% was owned by Shu Zheng.&lt;ref name="ejinsight.com" /&gt; Reports in state media one week after the explosion were contradictory, holding that Ruihai was owned via proxies by Yu Xuewei, a former senior executive at [[Sinochem]], and Dong Shexuan, who served as the company's vice-president and had been arrested by police by the time of the reports. Dong Shexuan is the son of Tianjin port's former police chief Dong Peijun, who was a colleague of [[Wu Changshun]], the former chief of the [[Chinese public security bureau|public security bureau]] of Tianjin.&lt;ref name="bbc33986871" /&gt;&lt;ref name="economist" /&gt; The [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] (CCDI), CPC's anti-corruption body, charged Wu Changshun with bribery in 2014; Dong Peijun was also under investigation for corruption, but died that year.&lt;ref name="economist" /&gt;

However,according to another resource that is familiar with this company,the involved people who have been disclosed including the representatives Zhifeng are only "small ants",the company has a deeper background behind.In fact, There are many actual controllers in the company. Dong Shexuan is only one of them who actually occupies a small share.

== Investigation ==
After the explosions, the CCDI placed [[Yang Dongliang]], Director of the [[State Administration of Work Safety]] and China's highest work-safety official, under investigation on 18 August 2015. Yang had previously served as Tianjin's vice mayor for 11 years. In 2012, Yang Dongliang had issued an order to loosen rules for the handling of hazardous substances, which may have enabled Ruihai to store toxic chemicals such as sodium cyanide.&lt;ref name="economist" /&gt;

On 27 August, Xinhua reported that police had arrested twelve people with suspected connections to the explosions, including Ruihai Logistics' chairman, vice-chairman, and at least three other managers, with the other seven people unnamed.&lt;ref name="20150826cnbc" /&gt;

On 5 February 2016, the [[Chinese government]] issued the investigation report of the explosions. The report concluded the fire started in a container through auto-ignition of [[nitrocellulose]], due to vaporization of the wetting agent during hot weather.&lt;ref name="inv" /&gt;

On 8 November 2016, Various courts in China handed jail sentences to 49 government officials and warehouse executives and staffs for their roles circumventing the safety rules that led to the disaster. The Chairman of Ruihai Logistics was sentenced to death with [[Death sentence with reprieve|a two-year reprieve]].&lt;ref name="20161109npr"/&gt;

== Response ==

=== Media coverage ===

==== News outlets ====
Tianjin authorities banned editors and reporters from sharing information about the disaster on [[Microblogging in China|Weibo]] and [[WeChat]], and websites were ordered to follow state media.&lt;ref name="20150813foreignpolicy" /&gt;

The Tianjin internet police warned social media users to use only official casualty figures.&lt;ref name="AutoVH-15" /&gt;

[[Tianjin Television]] had reported the explosion on their early morning news at 7:00&amp;nbsp;am,&lt;ref name="AutoVH-16" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt; but citizens complained that the station had not reported live nor updated on the event, instead showing soap operas eight hours later.&lt;ref name = hkfp1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ibi1" /&gt;

==== Social media ====
A great deal of specific information on the event, including the majority of early stage video was first released over social media sites, and in particular [[Microblogging in China|microblogging platforms]] like [[Sina Weibo|Weibo]]. Major media has drawn heavily from social media sources, greatly widening the audience. ''The Economist'' noted, "Social media fills in the blanks left by official narratives of the Tianjin disaster. The most remarkable feature of the aftermath of the explosions in Tianjin, in northern China, has been the extraordinary contrast between the official reaction to the crisis, which has been profoundly flawed, and the online reaction, which has entirely dominated the agenda."&lt;ref name="econ8-20-15" /&gt;

==== Censorship and criticism ====
Professional and social media reports were [[censorship in China|censored by Chinese authorities]].&lt;ref name="AutoVH-17" /&gt; The censorship rate increased tenfold on the social media site [[Sina Weibo|Weibo]],&lt;ref name="20150814wsj" /&gt; with users reporting the deletion of their posts regarding the blasts, with "Tianjin" and "explosion" being the most censored words.&lt;ref name="hkfp1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="custer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ap11" /&gt; An article by ''Caijing'', which carried an interview with a firefighter who said that no-one on the front line had been informed of the dangerous chemicals on site that would react exothermically when mixed with water, was deleted after it had been reposted 10,000 times; many other posts mentioning the existence of deadly sodium cyanide were also expunged.&lt;ref name="custer" /&gt;

The [[Cyberspace Administration of China]] banned all journalists from posting to social media, and insisted on strict adherence to Xinhua copy. On 15 August, it announced that it had shut down 18 websites and suspended 32 more for spreading false information.&lt;ref name=rsf /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoVH-18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoVH-19" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoVH-20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoVH-21" /&gt; More than 360 Weibo and public WeChat accounts which had allegedly been spreading such false rumors have been "punished according to laws". Of these accounts, over 160 were shut down permanently.&lt;ref name="AutoVH-22" /&gt;

Press freedom organization [[Reporters Without Borders]] (RSF) accused the Chinese state media of playing up the heroic efforts of rescue workers and firefighters while downplaying the causes of the explosions and the number of casualties. RSF said that censorship by the Chinese authorities showed "a flagrant indifference to the public's legitimate concerns".&lt;ref name="rsf" /&gt;

A CNN correspondent was interrupted by bystanders and forced to leave during a live report outside [[TEDA Hospital]].&lt;ref name="hkfp1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="20150813cnn" /&gt; A journalist from the Beijing News reported that he and two other reporters were chased by police, caught, searched, and made to delete photographs from their cameras and computers.&lt;ref name="AutoVH-23" /&gt;

=== Reactions ===
Immediately following the blasts the company website was taken down fuelling suspicions that an attempt was being made to shield owners with powerful political connections.&lt;ref name=apple20150815 /&gt;&lt;ref name="ejinsight.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/478605/pick-your-poison-the-firm-behind-huge-explosions-in-tianjin-handles-all-manner-of-hazardous-chemicals/|work=Quartz|title=Pick your poison: The firm behind huge explosions in Tianjin handles all manner of hazardous chemicals|author=Zheping Haung|date=13 August 2015|accessdate=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For several successive days, local residents seeking compensation for their homes protested in front of the venue of the daily press conference, they were joined by distraught families of missing firefighters, and confronted police angrily.&lt;ref name= 201502atlantic /&gt;&lt;ref name="20150816GUARDIANfergus" /&gt;&lt;ref name=20150816NBC /&gt;

The Chinese public security minister threatened severe punishment for those found to be responsible for the explosions. However, the authorities did not release any significant information for several days about the chemicals and circumstances, causing public anger to mount during this time.&lt;ref name=20150818hkfp /&gt;&lt;ref name=20150820nyt /&gt; Marking an official change of tack that suggested top-level endorsement,&lt;ref name=wsws /&gt; the official ''[[People's Daily]]'' joined in to criticise local officials' lack of candour and their use of bureaucratic jargon.&lt;ref name= 201502atlantic /&gt;&lt;ref name=20150820nyt /&gt; In addition, the ''[[Global Times]]'' remarked on the inadequacy of emergency response and the reluctance of high-ranking officials to answer the public's questions and address their concerns until four days after the blasts.&lt;ref name= 201502atlantic /&gt; The ''People's Daily'' acknowledged that public scepticism of the reported death toll was fuelling rampant rumours; there was also disquiet over the emergency assistance provided and the way the aftermath was being handled.&lt;ref name="20150818cnn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="20150819qz" /&gt; Attempting to defuse widespread anger at the lack of official transparency, mouthpieces of the ruling party declared that investigations would be thorough and transparent.&lt;ref name="20150817GUARDnocoverup" /&gt; Former deputy mayor, Yang Dongliang, was put under investigation for corruption; mayor Huang Xingguo proclaimed his "unshirkable responsibility for this accident".&lt;ref name="20150820nyt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="20150819GUARDtp" /&gt; Authorities also released information about the ownership of Ruihai, as well as a confession by one beneficial owner for the proxy shareholdings.&lt;ref name=20150820nyt /&gt;

Meanwhile, Greenpeace Asia alleged that two [[Sinochem]] subsidiaries – Sinochem Tianjin Binhai Logistics Company (with a {{convert|130000|m2|adj=on}} site) and Tianjin Port Sinochem Hazardous Goods Logistics Company Ltd. – had warehouses in the vicinity in close proximity to a primary and a nursery school, meaning that both were also in similar breach of laws.&lt;ref name=20150819GUARDtp /&gt;

Observers stated that top officials always attempt to show such disasters as isolated instances, have never accepted political accountability nor addressed the underlying governance issues, and have always heavily censored any criticism of the central government.&lt;ref name=20150818hkfp /&gt;&lt;ref name=20150820nyt /&gt; Willy Lam, professor at [[Chinese University of Hong Kong|CUHK]] and senior fellow at [[The Jamestown Foundation]], noted the highly unusual 4 days it took for [[Li Keqiang]] to make an official visit, suggesting that the lack of a top-ranking visitor to a major disaster site within 48 hours despite the proximity to Beijing reflected "division among the leadership on who should be the fall guy."&lt;ref name="unknown" /&gt;&lt;ref name=20150816GUARDIANfergus /&gt;&lt;ref name="20150818hkfp" /&gt;

=== Clean-up and redress ===
Tianjin officials announced that as at the deadline on 3 September 2015, more than 9,000 households out of some 17,000 affected by the explosions had signed agreements to settle their damages claims. It was reported that some had chosen to sell their damaged apartments to private developers, who offered them around 130% of the original purchase price, while others accepted an offer from the local government promising to fix the damaged apartments. The local government offered an additional of ¥20,000 renminbi ($3,100) to those who agreed to settle their claims by the deadline. ''New York Times'' journalists, however, reported that some owners had faced heavy pressure from government officials to settle; similarly, owners who were employees in state-owned enterprises were under threat of dismissal from their bosses for not settling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chinadigitaltimes.net/2015/09/tianjin-blast-homeowners-tell-of-pressure-to-accept-compensation/|title=Tianjin Homeowners Tell of Compensation Pressure|work=China Digital Times|date=11 September 2015|accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/09/04/weeks-after-tianjin-blasts-many-residents-await-compensation-for-damaged-homes/?_r=0|title=Weeks After Tianjin Blasts, Many Residents Await Compensation for Damaged Homes|work=The New York Times|publisher=Sinosphere|date=4 September 2015|first=Javier C.|last=Hernández}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 September 2015 [[China Daily]] reported that families of the firefighters killed in the explosions would each receive compensation of 2.3&amp;nbsp;million yuan (US$360,669), citing a report in Beijing News. It was also reported that a monument would be built on the site and that the government planned to compensate residents whose houses were damaged by repurchasing them at 1.3 times their purchase price.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2015-09/10/content_21837429.htm Tianjin announces compensations for martyred firefighters' families – China – Chinadaily.com.cn&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Afro-Costa Ricans''' are [[Costa Rica]]ns of [[Africa]]n ancestry.

Costa Rica has four small minority groups: [[Mulatto]]es, [[Black people|Blacks]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]] and [[Asians]]. About 8% of the population is of Black African descent or Mulatto (mix of European and black) who are called Afro-Costa Ricans. Most of them are English-speaking descendants of 19th-century black [[Jamaica]]n immigrant workers.

==History==
The first black people who arrived in [[Costa Rica]] came with the Spanish conquistadors. Slave trade was common in all the countries conquered by [[Spain]], and in Costa Rica the first blacks seem to have come from specific sources in Africa- Equatorial and Western regions. The people from these areas were thought of as ideal slaves because they had a reputation for being more robust, affable and hard-working than other Africans.
The slaves were from what is now the  [[Gambia]] ([[Mandinka people|Mandingas]]), [[Guinea]] (specifically Wolofe), [[Ghanaian]] ([[Ashanti people|Ashanti]]), [[Benin]] (specifically [[Ohori people|Ije]] / Ararás) and [[Sudan]] (Puras).&lt;ref name="costaricaway"/&gt; Many of the slaves were also Minas (i.e. slaves from parts of the region extending from [[Ivory Coast]] to the [[Slave Coast of West Africa|Slave Coast]]), Popo (be imported tribes as [[Ana people|Ana]] and [[Bariba people|Baribas]]), [[Yoruba people|Yorubas]]  and Congas (perhaps from [[Kongasso]], Ivory Coast).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historia.fcs.ucr.ac.cr/articulos/esp-genero/1parte/CAP1Marielos/Cuadro2.htm MUJERES ESCLAVAS EN LA COSTA RICA DEL SIGLO XVIII: ESTRATEGIAS FRENTE A LA ESCLAVITUD] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130105040124/http://www.historia.fcs.ucr.ac.cr/articulos/esp-genero/1parte/CAP1Marielos/Cuadro2.htm |date=January 5, 2013 }} {{sp icon}} (Slave women in Costa Rica of the 18th century: Strategies against slavery)&lt;/ref&gt; Slaves also came from other places, such as neighboring [[Panama]].
 
However, the following century witnessed a gradual lessening of the differences between blacks and their white owners. As whites took black women as their concubines, they freed the children that were born from this union. The same thing started to happen with the "[[zambo]]s", born of Amerindians and blacks. During the time of slavery, the slaves worked on cattle ranches of Guanacaste and the Central Valley plantations and cacao plantations in Matina, whose situation was more difficult. Over time, many whites freed their slaves and slavery was abolished in 1823, along with the other Central American countries.&lt;ref name="costaricaway"&gt;[http://www.costaricaway.net/artcaribe/pdf/raizafro.pdf Costa Rica way] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021022206/http://www.costaricaway.net/artcaribe/pdf/raizafro.pdf |date=October 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest Costa Rican black community is from the Caribbean, which today constitutes the majority of the Costa Rican black population. Costa Rica has the largest [[Jamaica]]n diaspora after [[Cuba]] and Panama and its development as a nation is witness to this contribution.&lt;ref name="alainet"/&gt;

Since 1850, fishermen of Afro-Caribbean origin began to settle in the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica, especially from Panama and the West Indies. They stayed in temporary camps during fishing seasons, from March to September, to plant coconuts, cassava, and yams, which were then harvested the following season. Since 1828, some of these fishermen began to settle in Costa Rica permanently with their families.&lt;ref name="costaricaway"/&gt;

Towards the second half of the 19th century, coffee became the main export of Costa Rica. The crops were transported from the Pacific Coast, by an inaccessible jungle terrain of the Atlantic Coast. To be taken to Europe, they had to turn back to South America, which increased the cost and removed competitiveness . To remedy this situation, in 1871 a railway and a port on the Atlantic Coast were constructed. Because of the scarcity of local labor, workers were imported from Italy, China, and the Caribbean and Central America. This coincided with an employment crisis in Jamaica that caused an exodus to neighboring countries.&lt;ref name="alainet"/&gt; So on December 20, 1872, the ''Lizzie'', the first boat from Jamaica, arrived at the port of [[Limón]] with 123 workers to work on the railroad. From this moment, the number of Jamaican workers in Limon increased rapidly and the next year already saw over 1,000 Jamaican workers in the port, mostly of [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] origin.&lt;ref name="costaricaway"/&gt;

Many Jamaicans intended to return home, but most remained in the province of Limón on the Caribbean Coast. In 1890 the railways suffered a financial crisis, forcing many workers to sustain themselves by working in agriculture. This in turn saw the laborers establishing relationships and cultural exchanges with native populations of these areas.&lt;ref name="costaricaway"/&gt; Later, the Jamaican workers began working for the banana industry, whose production grew to its peak in 1907.

Usually these workers lived on the plantations and had little knowledge of Costa Rica beyond their immediate environment. The contact was minimal because the Costa Rican banana plantations were in foreign hands. They did not speak Spanish and retained Jamaican customs. They had their own schools with teachers brought from Jamaica. Until 1949 Costa Rica had segregation laws where Blacks lived exclusively in the Caribbean Province of Puerto Limón. By 2011 Afro-Costa Ricans were spread in all 7 Costa Rican provinces: 32% of them in San José, 16% in Alajuela, 15% in Limón, 10% in Heredia and 8% in Cartago and Guanacaste. Today, Afro-Costa Ricans are part of different disciplines and fields in Costa Rica.&lt;ref name="alainet"&gt;[http://alainet.org/active/1013&amp;lang=es América latina en movimiento. La comunidad negra en Costa Rica]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104173103/http://alainet.org/active/1013%26lang%3Des |date=January 4, 2013 }} {{sp icon}} (Latin America in Movement. The black community in Costa Rica), by Francis Hutchinson.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
Eight percent of the population is Afro-Costa Rican (black or mulatto), compared to 2.4 percent who are Amerindian and 83 percent who are of European heritage (including [[castizo]] and mestizo). In the province of [[Guanacaste Province|Guanacaste]], a significant portion of the population is Afro-mestizo, descended from a mix of local [[Amerindian]]s, Africans and Spaniards. Until 1949 most Afro-Costa Ricans lived in [[Limón Province|Limón]] and were denied Costa Rican citizenship and thus the right to vote.

{{History of the People's Republic of China}}
{{Politics of China |expanded = Supervision }}

A far-reaching '''campaign against corruption''' began in [[China]] following the conclusion of the [[18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China|18th National Congress]] of the [[Communist Party of China]] in 2012. The campaign, carried out under the aegis of [[Xi Jinping]], [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]] ([[paramount leader]]), was the largest organized anti-graft effort in the history of Communist rule in China.

Upon taking office, Xi vowed to crack down on "tigers and flies", that is, high-level officials and local civil servants alike.  Most of the officials investigated were removed from office and faced accusations of bribery and abuse of power, although the range of alleged abuses varied widely. {{As of|2016}}, the campaign has 'netted' over [[Officials implicated by the anti-corruption campaign in China since 2012|120 high-ranking officials, including about a dozen high-ranking military officers, several senior executives of state-owned companies, and five national leaders]].&lt;ref name="ChinaPowerCSIS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chinapower.csis.org/can-xi-jinpings-anti-corruption-campaign-succeed/|title=Can Xi Jinping's Anti Corruption Campaign Succeed?|publisher=ChinaPowerCSIS|date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=99th&gt;{{cite news|title=第99"虎"落马警示了啥？|url=http://media.china.com.cn/cmjujiao/2015-03-21/396575.html|date=March 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;sup&gt;(both sources inaccurate/incomplete)&lt;/sup&gt; More than 100,000 people have been indicted for corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/news/china/21676814-crackdown-corruption-has-spread-anxiety-among-chinas-business-elite-robber-barons-beware |title=Robber barons, beware |work=The Economist |date=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign is part of a much wider drive to clean up malfeasance within party ranks and shore up party unity. It has become an emblematic feature of Xi Jinping's political brand.

Executed largely under the direction of the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] and its Secretary from 2012 to 2017 [[Wang Qishan]] along with corresponding military and judicial organs, the campaign was notable in implicating both incumbent and former national-level leaders, including former [[Politburo Standing Committee]] (PSC) member [[Zhou Yongkang]] and former military leaders [[Xu Caihou]] and [[Guo Boxiong]]. Such investigations broke the unspoken rule regarding 'PSC criminal immunity' ({{zh|c=刑不上常委}}) that has been the norm since the end of the [[Cultural Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ma|first1=Haoliang|title=Which PSC members are no longer called "Comrades"?|url=http://news.takungpao.com/special/szqh_changwei/|work=Ta Kung Pao}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wang Qishan in 2016.jpg|thumb|180px|Wang Qishan, head of the [[18th Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]], the party's anti-graft agency]]

The agency directly charged with overseeing the campaign is the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] (CCDI), which, at the time of the campaign, was headed by Secretary [[Wang Qishan]], a politician known for his work in the financial sector and one of the seven members of the [[Politburo Standing Committee]] of the Communist Party. Wang was in charge of the day-to-day execution of the campaign. The CCDI's official mandate is to enforce party discipline, combat malfeasance, and punish party members for committing offenses. The CCDI is an internal agency of the party and therefore does not have judicial authority. In general, the CCDI investigates officials and, when necessary, forwards evidence gathered to judicial organs, such as the [[Supreme People's Procuratorate]] (in charge of investigation and prosecution), who proceeds to charge the accused with criminal wrongdoing and move the case to trial.&lt;ref name=wederman&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wederman |first1= Andrew |authorlink= |date=December 2004  |title=The Intensification of Corruption in China |journal=[[The China Quarterly]] |volume=180 |issue= |pages=895–921 | doi=|url=http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/gov2126/files/wedeman_intensification_corruption_china.pdf |ref=CITEREFWederman2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the CCDI formally reports into the Party Congress, nominally the highest representative body of the party which gathers once every five years, and is intended to be an 'independent' agency from a constitutional standpoint, in practice ultimate oversight of the agency falls under the purview of Xi Jinping by virtue of holding the office of [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] (i.e., ''de facto'' leader).&lt;ref name="willylamCCDI"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.jamestown.org/programs/chinabrief/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=43499&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=25&amp;cHash=1b92b9b37fc254cf70594ef2b8f45595#.VN_Z5VPF9sB | title = Growing CCDI Power Brings Questions of Politically-Motivated Purge | author = Lam, Willy | publisher = [[The Jamestown Foundation]] | date = 4 February 2015 | accessdate = 15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xi, who is also [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]], also directs anti-graft efforts of the military through his holding the office of [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]] (i.e., commander-in-chief). The majority of reporting on the campaign by media sources have highlighted Xi Jinping's direct involvement in managing the campaign, which has become a central hallmark of his term in office. However, formal disciplinary measures meted out to high-ranking officials such as former Politburo members must undergo ratification by the sitting Politburo.&lt;ref name=guo&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Guo |first1= Xuezhi |authorlink= |date=September 2014  |title=Controlling Corruption in the Party: China's Central Discipline Inspection Commission |journal=[[The China Quarterly]] |volume=219 |issue= |pages=597–624  |doi=|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9370628&amp;fulltextType=RA&amp;fileId=S0305741014000770 |ref=CITEREFGuo2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coordination of [[anti-corruption]] efforts in the provinces and state-owned enterprises have been carried out by "central inspection teams" (中央巡视组), which reports to the [[Central Leading Group for Inspection Work]], which like the CCDI is also led by [[Wang Qishan]]. The inspection teams are typically 'stationed' for a few months at the organization they were tasked with overseeing, and are in charge of thorough audits into the conduct of officials and organizational practices. The inspection teams sends the results of the audits to the CCDI to enact formal investigative procedures such as ''[[Shuanggui]]'' (the practice of detaining individual party members for investigation).&lt;ref name=xunshi&gt;{{cite news|title=中央巡视工作领导小组向中央负责|url=http://stock.sohu.com/20131105/n389621642.shtml|work=Sohu|date=November 5, 2013|access-date=2015-03-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211160729/http://stock.sohu.com/20131105/n389621642.shtml#|archive-date=2017-02-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed constitutional changes published on February 25 envision the creation of a new anti-graft state agency that merges the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and various anti-corruption government departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2134656/chinas-new-super-graft-buster-will-outrank-courts-and|title=China’s new super graft-buster will outrank courts and prosecutors|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2018-02-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thus formed [[National Supervisory Commission]] will be the highest supervisory body in the country, and will be a cabinet-level organization outranking courts and the office of the prosecutor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/2018-02/25/c_1122451187.htm|title=（受权发布）中国共产党中央委员会关于修改宪法部分内容的建议-新华网|website=www.xinhuanet.com|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-corruption efforts have been on the agenda of successive Chinese leaders, though the effectiveness of these campaigns have varied. Since economic reforms began in 1978, political corruption in China has grown significantly. The types of offenses vary, though usually they involve trading bribes for political favours, such as local businesses trying to secure large government contracts or subordinates seeking promotions for higher office.&lt;ref name=bloom&gt;{{cite news|title=China’s Bribery Culture Poses Risks for Multinationals|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-11-21/china-s-bribery-culture-poses-risks-for-multinationals|work=Bloomberg|date=November 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=matt&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sheehan|first1=Matt|title=How To Bribe Your Way Into The Chinese Government|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/01/chinese-government-buy-of_n_6247742.html|work=The Huffington Post|date=December 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 18th Party Congress, both outgoing General Secretary [[Hu Jintao]] and incoming party leader Xi Jinping repeatedly emphasized corruption is a threat to the party's survival. Xi made special mention of corruption in his inaugural speech as General Secretary on November 15, 2012.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; In his first days in office, Xi vowed to crack down on "tigers and flies", that is, high-ranking officials and petty civil servants alike.

The first salvos of the campaign was the abrupt sacking of [[Sichuan]] Deputy Party Secretary [[Li Chuncheng]], which took place in December 2012, shortly after Xi took office as leader of the Communist Party.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; The first batch of central inspection teams were dispatched in the third quarter of 2013 to various Chinese provinces, including Jiangxi, Inner Mongolia, Chongqing, and Hubei. A handful of provincial-level officials were investigated for corruption and removed from office as a result of the first round of inspection work.&lt;ref name=Chinan&gt;{{cite news|title=中央巡视组第一轮工作收尾：7个巡视点6个查出腐败|url=http://www.chinanews.com/gn/2013/09-27/5327995.shtml|work=Chinanews|date=September 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these regions, the inspection team in charge of [[Jiangxi]] uncovered far-reaching official corruption in the province, bringing down about a dozen officials, including Vice Governor [[Yao Mugen]].&lt;ref name=Chinan/&gt; The inspection work in Hubei province also resulted in about a dozen cases, including that of Vice Governor [[Guo Youming]]. In Inner Mongolia, head of the party's regional United Front department [[Wang Suyi]] was detained.&lt;ref name=guangming&gt;{{cite news|title=湖北高官落马侧证中央巡视组力度|url=http://guancha.gmw.cn/2013-11/28/content_9631406.htm|work=Guancha|agency=Guangming News|date=November 28, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402113625/http://guancha.gmw.cn/2013-11/28/content_9631406.htm|archivedate=April 2, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==='Encircling' Zhou Yongkang===
[[File:Zhou Yongkang.jpg|thumb|200px|Zhou Yongkang was the first [[Politburo Standing Committee]] member investigated for corruption in history]]
Meanwhile, in the latter half of 2013, a separate operation began to investigate officials with connections to [[Zhou Yongkang]], former Politburo Standing Committee member and national security chief. Three sectors in which Zhou was known to carry immense influence were targeted for investigation, including the national oil sector (where Zhou was once a chief executive), Sichuan province (where Zhou was party chief), and security organs (once under the jurisdiction of the [[Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission]], which Zhou headed). Senior officials, such as former China Petroleum chief executive [[Jiang Jiemin]], senior Sichuan officials [[Li Chongxi]] and [[Guo Yongxiang]], and former deputy minister of public security [[Li Dongsheng]] were all dismissed in 2013. Many of Zhou's former secretaries who later received promotions, including [[Ji Wenlin]], [[Tan Li]], [[Shen Dingcheng]], and [[Li Hualin]], were also rounded up for investigation.&lt;ref name=observer&gt;{{cite news|title=落马的周永康"秘书六人帮"|url=http://finance.sina.com.cn/zl/china/20140730/105019861557.shtml|work=The Economic Observer|publisher=Sina Caijing|date=July 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fall of Jiang Jiemin – who was seen as a close confidant of Zhou Yongkang and who also held membership on the elite [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China]] – in September 2013 was seen as an unmistakable sign that the net was closing in on Zhou himself. On December 15, 2013, ''The New York Times'', in a front page article, confirmed that [[Zhou Yongkang]] was the ultimate target of the campaign, and that it would be only a matter of time before the investigation was made public.&lt;ref name=ansfield&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ansfield|first1=Jonathan|last2=Buckley|first2=Chris|title=China Focusing Graft Inquiry on Ex-Official|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/16/world/asia/china-presses-corruption-inquiry-of-powerful-former-security-official.html|date=December 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 30, 2014, ''Caixin'', a Chinese website known for its investigative journalism, released a video and an accompanying article entitled "The Three 'White Gloves' of Zhou Bin", detailing allegations about the wrongdoing of Zhou Yongkang's son, without mentioning the senior Zhou directly as a means to skirt censorship rules.&lt;ref name=whiteglove&gt;{{cite news|title=周滨的三只"白手套"|url=http://video.caixin.com/2014-01-30/100635560.html|work=Caixin|date=January 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second regional rounds and Shanxi "political earthquake"===

In November 2013, a second round of inspection teams were dispatched. These teams were sent to the provinces of [[Shanxi]], Jilin, Yunnan, Anhui, Hunan and Guangdong, as well as the Xinhua News Agency, the Ministry of Commerce, and the state-owned company overseeing the construction of the [[Three Gorges Dam]]. In Guangdong, the inspections resulted in the abrupt downfall of the populist party chief of the provincial capital, Guangzhou, [[Wan Qingliang]]. In Yunnan, former provincial party chief [[Bai Enpei]] and Vice Governor [[Shen Peiping]] were implicated in corruption and detained.&lt;ref name=youthdaily&gt;{{cite news|title=原云南省委书记白恩培被调查|url=http://epaper.ynet.com/html/2014-08/30/content_82457.htm?div=-1|work=Beijing Youth Daily|date=August 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Shanxi, a coal-producing province in central China, the stationed inspection team picked up on a corruption labyrinth that seeped into almost all aspects of governance in the province, particularly the collusion between local politicians and business elites, most of whom ran coal companies. The inspection initially resulted in the dismissal of Deputy Party Secretary [[Jin Daoming]], Vice Governor [[Du Shanxue]], and [[Ling Zhengce]], the brother of the once powerful chief presidential aide [[Ling Jihua]].&lt;ref name=chinanews2&gt;{{cite news|title=中央第二轮巡视10个巡视组全部进驻被巡视单位|url=http://www.chinanews.com/gn/2013/11-03/5456700.shtml|work=Chinanews|date=November 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The political drama in Shanxi played out over the third quarter of 2014, as the province experienced a wholesale cleansing of its political establishment with ferocity unseen in the post-Mao era China. Between August 23 and 29, 2014, four sitting members of the province's top governing council, the provincial [[Party Standing Committee]], were sacked in quick succession, giving rise to what became known as the "great Shanxi political earthquake". The province's Party Secretary [[Yuan Chunqing]] was then abruptly transferred out of office, as the central authorities 'parachuted' then [[Jilin]] party chief [[Wang Rulin]] to take his place. During the transfer-of-power announcement in the provincial capital [[Taiyuan]], Politburo Standing Committee member [[Liu Yunshan]] sat centre stage as party organization officials and provincial politicians ran the motions and exchanged obligatory political declarations to stabilize the province and maintain unwavering loyalty to the party centre.&lt;ref name=shanxiliu&gt;{{cite news|title=山西换书记 为何刘云山坐镇？|url=http://www.zaobao.com.sg/special/zbo/story20140902-384503|work=Lianhe Zaobao|date=September 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The fall of the "Four Big Tigers"===
As the public awaited word on the fate of Zhou Yongkang amid intense rumours circulating inside the country and in international media, on June 30, an explosive announcement came from Beijing that General [[Xu Caihou]], former member of the Politburo and Vice Chairman of the [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] from 2004 to 2013, was being expelled from the party for taking bribes in exchange for promotions, and facing criminal prosecution. The CMC Vice-Chairman position is the highest position held by a military officer in China, as the Chairmanship (commander-in-chief) is customarily occupied by a civilian. Xu was the highest ranked PLA military officer ever to be implicated in corruption and the first Politburo member investigated for corruption since the sensational sacking of former Chongqing party chief [[Bo Xilai]].&lt;ref name=xucai&gt;{{cite news|last1=Buckley|first1=Chris|title=China’s Antigraft Push Snares an Ex-General|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/01/world/asia/china-moves-against-one-of-its-top-leaders.html|work=The New York Times|date=June 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the steady build-up of speculation surrounding the Zhou case, the announcement of Xu's expulsion from the party came without any apparent warning. Reports later surfaced that the 71-year-old general, who was going through medical treatment for bladder cancer at [[301 Military Hospital]] in Beijing, was taken from his sick bed in March 2014 to be investigated.&lt;ref name=scmxu&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-PLA top general Xu Caihou held in cash for rank probe|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1452749/retired-top-pla-general-xu-caihou-held-cash-rank-probe?page=all|work=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Xu Caihou 2009.jpg|200px|thumb|left|General [[Xu Caihou]] became the highest-ranking military officer in PLA history to be investigated for corruption]]
A month after Xu's fall, on July 30, 2014, state media finally broke months of silence on Zhou Yongkang with a press release naming him the subject of an investigation into "severe disciplinary violations." The terse news bulletin, carried throughout Chinese media, signalled that Zhou was "no longer a comrade" but did not discuss criminal wrongdoing. Zhou was likely placed under some form of house arrest long prior to the announcement. The official confirmation that Zhou was under investigation made him the first Politburo Standing Committee member to fall from grace since the end of the [[Cultural Revolution]], and broke the unspoken rule of "PSC criminal immunity" that has been the norm for over three decades. Moreover, it was unusual that the case against Zhou was pursued despite his having retired from office in 2012. Prior to Xi's ascension to power, corruption cases were typically targeted towards incumbent Politburo members, such as [[Chen Xitong]], [[Chen Liangyu]], and Bo Xilai.&lt;ref name=xingbushang&gt;{{cite news|title=周永康被立案，"刑不上常委"潜规则已破？|url=http://news.ifeng.com/opinion/wangping/zhouyongkang0729/|work=Ifeng|date=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zhou would be formally expelled from the party in December 2014, after the Politburo reviewed findings of his case. The internal investigation concluded that Zhou abused his power, maintained extramarital affairs with multiple women, took massive bribes, exchanged money and favours for sex, and "leaked state and party secrets."&lt;ref name=announce&gt;{{cite news|title=Official Xinhua announcement on the outcome of internal investigation on Zhou Yongkang|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/politics/2014-12/06/c_1113542222.htm|publisher=Xinhua|date=December 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth quarter of 2014 saw another flurry of officials detained for investigation. Criminal proceedings had also begun. On July 31, Wang Suyi was sentenced to fifteen years in prison for bribery. On August 5, [[Tong Mingqian]] was convicted of dereliction of duty in a vote-buying scandal and sentenced to five years in prison. In September 2014, the trial of former economic official [[Liu Tienan]] became the first high-profile televised trial of the campaign. On camera, a teary-eyed Liu recanted his crimes and lamented having ruined the future of his son, who was said to be complicit in his corrupt activities.&lt;ref name=liucries&gt;{{cite news|title=老子当官崽收钱，刘铁男被儿子坑哭了|url=http://news.163.com/14/0925/02/A6V38SNJ00014Q4P.html|work=Xiaoxiang Morning News|publisher=Netease|date=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 22, 2014, [[Ling Jihua]], former senior aide to paramount leader [[Hu Jintao]] and a political star whose ambitions were quashed by the untimely death of his Ferrari-driving son, also fell under the anti-graft dragnet. Ling was serving as the head of the party's [[United Front Work Department]] at the time, and also was Vice-Chairman of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] (CPPCC), a legislative advisory body.&lt;ref name=lingjihua&gt;{{cite news|title=全国政协副主席令计划接受组织调查(图/简历)|url=http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2014-12-22/200131314592.shtml|publisher=Sina|date=December 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ling hailed from the prominent Linghu political family from [[Pinglu County]], Shanxi. Several of his relatives were reported as having been investigated beginning in the third quarter of 2014, in what seemed to be another 'encirclement campaign' similar to what was happening with Zhou Yongkang. It was later alleged that Ling served as somewhat of a ringleader for the so-called [[Xishan Society]], a [[secret society]]-like network of high officials from Shanxi province.&lt;ref name=rfi&gt;{{cite news|title=罗昌平《打铁记》揭秘山西籍高官同乡会组织"西山会"|url=http://finance.ifeng.com/a/20141223/13376697_0.shtml|agency=RFI|date=October 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Su Rong]], the fourth 'big tiger' who was then also serving as CPPCC Vice-Chairman, was already 'netted' earlier in the year, but was officially expelled from the party in February 2015.  Su was better known for his lengthy career as party chief in three Chinese provinces, but his term in Jiangxi (2007 – 2013), where corruption was said to have flourished under his watch, was cited as the major reason for his downfall.&lt;ref name=chinanews&gt;{{cite news|title=江西省委书记强卫：苏荣腐败损害江西的政治生态|url=http://www.chinanews.com/gn/2015/03-06/7105545.shtml|work=Jinghua Daily|publisher=Chinanews|date=March 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional profiles==
Several provinces have faced the brunt of the anti-corruption campaign: Guangdong, Shanxi, Sichuan, and Jiangsu. In addition to tackling corruption, the campaign has also had the effect of reducing regional factionalism and dissecting entrenched patron-client networks that have flourished since the beginning of economic reforms in the 1980s. Xi Jinping had declared in his speeches that internal factionalism is as harmful to the party's ability to govern as corruption.&lt;ref name=factionalism/&gt; As of November 2015, all 31 provincial-level divisions, including municipalities like Beijing and Shanghai, which were once considered to be relatively free of corruption, have seen at least one provincial-level official investigated for corruption.&lt;ref name=lasttiger&gt;{{cite news|title=北京"首虎"吕锡文被查 全国各省均有"老虎"落马|url=http://news.163.com/15/1111/11/B84U6U8I00014JB6.html|work=Netease News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shanxi===
Of the most heavily targeted provinces, [[Shanxi]] has been the most notable 'disaster zone', with a total of nine officials of provincial rank investigated or dismissed for corruption, five of which were sitting members of the [[provincial party standing committee]], the province's highest ''de facto'' governing body.  At the time of the 18th Party Congress in November 2012, there were 13 seats on the provincial standing committee.  By March 2015, less than a year after the "political earthquake", only three members of the original group remained, and only two members were born and raised in Shanxi province.  The remainder have been removed from office, transferred out of the province, or otherwise replaced, indicating that the central authorities from Beijing had essentially 'taken over' political control of the province from Shanxi locals. Moreover, many municipal and local district leaders were also sacked and investigated for corruption in quick succession, such as in the cities of [[Datong]], [[Lüliang]], [[Yuncheng]], [[Yangquan]], and the provincial capital [[Taiyuan]]. According to official data, in 2013 alone, 26 officials of prefecture-department rank (厅局级) and 336 officials of county-division rank (县处级) were disciplined in Shanxi province.&lt;ref name=duoweishanxi&gt;{{cite news|title=山西遭塌方式腐败 王儒林坦言很痛心|url=http://china.dwnews.com/news/2015-03-06/59639492.html|work=Duowei|date=March 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, 17 county-level party chiefs were investigated in Shanxi. The sheer extent of the 'damage' the campaign inflicted on Shanxi's political scene was so great and the changes so abrupt that some important posts were left vacant for nearly a year. The inspection teams in the province uncovered widespread collusion between those who hold political power and the "coal bosses" that stack their wallets in exchange for favourable treatment in approving development projects. Even officials who were previously seen as incorruptible eventually caved into the systemic culture of graft.&lt;ref name=five&gt;{{cite web|title=山西阳泉书记洪发科被查 全省11市落马5书记2市长|url=http://news.ifeng.com/a/20150703/44098842_0.shtml|website=Ifeng}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guangdong===
In Guangdong, the campaign severely upset the political ecosystem that had long been dominated by native Cantonese politicians. [[Wan Qingliang]], the popular and relatively youthful party chief of [[Guangzhou]] known for his frugality and accessibility, was sacked in the third quarter of 2014, and was also replaced by an outsider, former Tianjin vice mayor [[Ren Xuefeng]]. The province's top political advisor, [[Zhu Mingguo]], also became one of the few incumbent officials of full provincial rank to be investigated for corruption. Vice Governor [[Liu Zhigeng]], another native Cantonese official who was once the party chief of [[Dongguan]], and [[Zhuhai]] party chief [[Li Jia (born 1964)|Li Jia]], who had spent his entire political career in Guangdong, were also sacked. The breaking down of local patronage networks had already begun before the 18th Party Congress, and continued with greater intensity following the Congress under newly anointed party chief [[Hu Chunhua]]. The party leadership team in Shenzhen, China's most successful Special Economic Zone, also underwent significant changes, with party chief [[Wang Rong (politician)|Wang Rong]] moving to a provincial office; several of Wang's subordinates were investigated for corruption.&lt;ref name=ceweekly&gt;{{cite news|title=蒋尊玉落马背后：其家族几乎插手深圳大运会所有工程|url=http://www.ceweekly.cn/2014/1201/97798.shtml|work=CE Weekly|date=December 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yangtze River Delta===
In Jiangsu, home province of former party leader [[Jiang Zemin]] and disgraced security chief [[Zhou Yongkang]], several 'native sons' with seemingly promising political futures underwent investigation. Nanjing mayor [[Ji Jianye]] was the "first tiger" to fall in the province. His dismissal was trumpeted by the city's then party chief [[Yang Weize]] as having "removed a tumour" from the provincial capital.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hearst|first1=David|title=China, corruption and the court intrigues of Nanjing|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/26/china-corruption-nanjing-ji-jianye-mayor|work=The Guardian|date=October 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2015, Yang himself was also detained for investigation. Former provincial party secretary-general [[Zhao Shaolin]] and Executive Vice Governor [[Li Yunfeng]] were also rounded up for investigation.

Zhejiang, 'home turf' of paramount leader [[Xi Jinping]] and the site of much smaller-scale anti-corruption experimentation during Xi's term as party chief there, had been largely spared of high-profile political changes in the wake of the anti-corruption campaign. Whether this is because Xi instilled a puritan political culture in the province during his tenure there or because officials with patronage links to him were given favourable treatment was unclear. As of 2016, former provincial Party Standing Committee member [[Si Xinliang]] was the sole high official from the province to be investigated for disciplinary offenses.&lt;ref name=sixin&gt;{{cite news|title=浙江"首虎"斯鑫良被查 疑与广厦老板有关|url=http://money.163.com/15/0217/08/AIL2E78700253F8F.html|work=Huashangbao, Xi'an|publisher=Netease|date=February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prevalence of party chiefs from provincial capitals===
Notably, many of those investigated had served in the past as Party Chiefs of provincial capitals, making the position especially 'susceptible' for investigation. For example, [[Taiyuan]] ([[Chen Chuanping]], [[Shen Weichen]]), [[Nanning]] ([[Yu Yuanhui]]), [[Jinan]] ([[Wang Min (born 1956)|Wang Min]]), [[Guangzhou]] ([[Wan Qingliang]]), [[Nanjing]] ([[Yang Weize]]), [[Xining]] ([[Mao Xiaobing]]), [[Urumqi]] ([[Li Zhi (politician)|Li Zhi]]), [[Lanzhou]] ([[Lu Wucheng]]), [[Kunming]] ([[Qiu He]], [[Zhang Tianxin]], [[Gao Jinsong]]), and [[Chengdu]] ([[Li Chuncheng]]).

==Critical analysis==
Reaction to the campaign has been mixed. It is believed to enjoy popular support among most ordinary Chinese, but has raised some concerns in the country's legal community.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; Much of the press coverage surrounding the campaign has included speculation over its aims and the political and economic effects of the campaign.&lt;ref name="ChinaPowerCSIS"/&gt;  Other observers have noted that the campaign takes place outside of the framework of legal [[due process]], and that the campaign addresses only the symptoms and not the systemic causes of the problem.

===Political motives===

===="Purge" and "factional warfare" hypotheses====
The notion that the entire campaign amounts to nothing more than a "political purge" has been advanced in Western media outlets. British news magazine ''[[The Economist]]'' wrote in its "Banyan" column, "it is hard not to see corruption allegations as the latter-day weapon of choice in the winner-takes-all power struggles that the party has always suffered".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Banyan: Tiger in the net|url=https://www.economist.com/news/china/21636086-zhou-yongkang-may-well-have-been-corrupt-his-real-problem-was-losing-power-struggle-tiger|work=The Economist|date=December 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, He Pin, editor at overseas Chinese news portal Boxun, likened Zhou Yongkang, Bo Xilai, Ling Jihua, and Xu Caihou, to a latter-day "[[Gang of Four]]", whose real crime was not corruption but conspiring to usurp power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fang|first1=Bing|title=周永康案是中共建政以来最大政变案？|url=http://www.voachinese.com/content/zhouyongkang-case-20141205/2547874.html|publisher=Voice of America|date=May 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese writer [[Murong Xuecun]], a continual critic of the Chinese Communist Party, wrote in an opinion article "In my view, Xi's anti-corruption campaign looks more like a Stalinist political purge... he relies on the regulations of the party and not on the laws of the state, the people carrying it out operate like the [[KGB]], and most cases cannot be reported on with any transparency."&lt;ref name=murong&gt;{{cite news|last1=Murong|first1=Xuecun|title=习近平的选择性反腐|url=http://cn.nytimes.com/opinion/20150119/c19murong/|work=The New York Times Chinese Edition|date=January 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Factional struggle has been proposed as another explanation. ''The Economist'' cited a study by an Australian scholar which concluded that no [[Princelings]], or descendants of the early Communist revolutionaries otherwise known as the "red second generation", have been targets of the anti-corruption campaign. Xi, himself considered a princeling; some also consider CCDI chief [[Wang Qishan]] a princeling through his father-in-law. However, the cohesiveness of the princelings as a political faction with similar policy preferences has not been well established. Indeed, just prior to Xi's ascension to power, [[Bo Xilai]], arguably China's most high-profile princeling, was ousted from office as party chief of Chongqing and member of the Politburo. At the same time, between 2013 and 2015, almost all the high-level officials investigated or removed from office were from 'commoner' backgrounds, most of them farmers.&lt;ref name=gerard&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barme|first1=Gerard|title=Tyger! Tyger! A Fearful Symmetry|url=http://www.thechinastory.org/2014/10/tyger-tyger-a-fearful-symmetry/|work=The China Story|date=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=TheIndependent.in&gt;{{cite news|title=WORLD Fall of Sun Zhengcai – is this a purge?|url=http://theindependent.in/fall-of-sun-zhengcai-is-this-a-purge/|work=The China Story|date=October 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Reducing elder influence" and "institution-building" theories====
Other observers acknowledge the campaign may be intended to achieve political ends but depict its ultimate aims as something far less sinister. Li Weidong, former editor of the ''Reform'' magazine in China, told [[Voice of America]] that by signalling that no one is off limits and by targeting retired officials, the campaign aimed to reduce the undue influence of party "elders" who were no longer in office but nevertheless wanted to interfere in political affairs. Writing for [[Radio Free Asia]], Liu Qing, among others, suggest that the campaign's main aim was to extinguish vestiges of influence of former paramount leader [[Jiang Zemin]].&lt;ref name=rfaliu&gt;{{cite news|last1=Liu|first1=Qing|title=习近平政治反腐的决战及走向（刘青）|url=http://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/liuqing/lq-01262015121234.html|agency=Radio Free Asia|date=January 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jiang's time in power saw a marked increase in patronage appointments that spanned the military, the provinces, and the party apparatus. Patron-client relationships, rather than merit, became the primary factor in securing promotions, giving rise to the formation of internal factions based on personal loyalty. Prominent examples of factions identified by observers include Jiang's [[Shanghai clique]], Zhou Yongkang's spheres of influence in the state oil and public security sectors, and the so-called [[Xishan Society]] of [[Shanxi]] officials – apart from these well-known cases, political factionalism seemed to be the order of the day down to the lowest levels of party bureaucracy.&lt;ref name=factionalism&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chu|first1=Bailiang|title=习近平反腐，更反"山头主义"|url=http://cn.nytimes.com/china/20150106/c06factions/|work=The New York Times (Chinese)|date=January 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that factional patrons often exerted massive influence through informal channels rather than through the offices they hold. Indeed, the refusal of Jiang Zemin to relinquish his influence years after he had formally left office was said to have caused much unease with the party rank-and-file.&lt;ref name=duoweisula&gt;{{cite news|last1=Su|first1=La|title=王岐山亲信调查上海 江泽民家族再受牵扯|url=http://china.dwnews.com/news/2015-03-11/59640565.html|work=Duowei News|date=March 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also had unduly constrained the ability of his successor [[Hu Jintao]] to enact systemic reforms or to carry out a cohesive agenda. By reversing this part of Jiang's legacy, some observers believe, Xi would be better equipped to discipline and unite the party under a common agenda. Proponents of this view believe that the ultimate aim of the campaign is to strengthen the role of institutions and stamp out factionalism and networks of personal loyalty, thereby creating a more united and meritocratic organization and achieving greater efficiency for governance.&lt;ref name=fangbing&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fang|first1=Bing|title=专家：习近平反腐目标—打垮太上皇架构|url=http://www.voachinese.com/content/xijinping-liweidong-20140804/1971429.html|publisher=Voice of America|date=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Positive change" hypothesis====
Several Chinese-language media sources rejected the notion that the corruption campaign should be likened to a political purge, calling this view naive and overly cynical. ''Duowei'' wrote that the campaign is part of a wider agenda of systemic reform aimed at restoring legitimacy of the Communist Party's mandate to rule, which – in the decades immediately prior – was heavily challenged by widespread corruption, a widening gap between rich and poor, social injustice, and excessive focus on material wealth. In this view, the campaign is consistent to the other initiatives focused on social justice undertaken by Xi, including pushing ahead legal reform, abolishing [[re-education through labour]], and castigating local officials from meddling in judicial proceedings.  Moreover, many officials implicated in the campaign were long retired or no longer serving in influential roles, and therefore posed no direct political threats to the incumbent administration.&lt;ref name=duoweiyl&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mao|first1=Yuelin|title=回音壁：西媒为何跟不上习近平的步伐？|url=http://global.dwnews.com/news/2014-12-10/59623355.html|publisher=''Duowei Times''|date=December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chinese sociologist Hu Xingdou told ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'' that the campaign was only the first stage of a long-term strategy aimed at genuinely tackling corruption and speculated that the second stage will include the establishment of independent anti-corruption organs.&lt;ref name=dwdahu&gt;{{cite news|title=专访：习"打虎"难以撼动真正"大老虎"？|url=http://www.dw.de/%E4%B8%93%E8%AE%BF%E4%B9%A0%E6%89%93%E8%99%8E%E9%9A%BE%E4%BB%A5%E6%92%BC%E5%8A%A8%E7%9C%9F%E6%AD%A3%E5%A4%A7%E8%80%81%E8%99%8E/a-18208717|work=Deutsche Welle|date=January 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brookings Institution]] China scholar Cheng Li, in an article entitled "Debunking Misconceptions About Xi Jinping’s Anti-corruption Campaign", asserted that attributing ulterior motives to the campaign was not only wholly misleading but also unproductive. Li believes that not only has Xi's campaign had the effect of truly curbing corrupt practices at all levels of government, it has also restored public confidence in the Communist Party's mandate to rule, and has also returned massive ill-gotten gains back into state coffers which could be re-directed towards economic development. Li also refuted the "political purge" and "factional warfare" hypotheses, contending that Xi not only owes some of his own patronage to Jiang but also his anti-corruption drive has widespread consensus in the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Li|first1=Cheng|title=Debunking Misconceptions about Xi Jinping's Anti-corruption Campaign|url=http://www.chinausfocus.com/political-social-development/debunking-misconceptions-about-xi-jinpings-anti-corruption-campaign/|publisher=China - US Focus|date=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC's Jonathan Fenby, among others, believe that the campaign may also be motivated by economic rather than political goals. For example, by tackling graft in state-owned enterprises, seen as bastions of entitlement, entrenched vested interests, and glaring inefficiencies, the government is better able to pursue economic reform programs aimed at liberalizing markets, breaking up monopolies, and reducing state control.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fenby|first1=Jonathan|title=China's corruption probe bares its teeth|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-31503967|agency=BBC|date=February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hu Xingdou also suggested the campaign has helped Xi conduct some much-needed "clean-up" of entrenched vested interests before pushing ahead with much larger structural reforms.&lt;ref name=dwdahu/&gt;

===Due process===
Investigations by the party's disciplinary bodies are not part of the state judicial system. When an official is detained for an investigation, known as ''[[Shuanggui]]'', they are essentially placed under house arrest and are isolated from the outside world. The subject often must endure days of grueling interrogation.&lt;ref name=nytimes2&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jacobs|first1=Andrew|last2=Buckley|first2=Chris|title=Presumed Guilty in China’s War on Corruption, Targets Suffer Abuses|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/20/world/asia/the-new-victims-of-chinas-war-on-corruption.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|date=October 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data from the first half of 2014 showed that the conviction rate of those who were investigated in that time period to be around 99%.&lt;ref name=nytimes2/&gt; The CCDI and its local counterparts usually gather evidence covertly well in advance of detaining the subject. Generally, when an official is announced to be under investigation, the CCDI has already collected an overwhelming amount of hard evidence. China scholar Willy Lam also wrote that the CCDI has seen a massive expansion of its powers since Xi's ascension, and that it was increasingly involved in the governance of the state. Lam also contended that the CCDI seemed to be deriving most of its power from Xi Jinping personally.&lt;ref name=willylam&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lam|first1=Willy|title=Growing CCDI Power Brings Questions of Politically-Motivated Purge|url=http://www.jamestown.org/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=43499&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=7&amp;cHash=01ebb9ca56858f4f3c923ea745214bb5#.VPh41vnF9uM|agency=The Jamestown Foundation|date=February 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, state media and some observers have pointed out that the CCDI has undergone significant structural reform in recent years aimed at making anti-corruption efforts more depoliticized, rules-based, and process-oriented. For much of its history the CCDI has been seen as a body that is largely inept at fighting corruption, but during the term of [[Hu Jintao]] the organization began a series of reforms strengthening its independence. Upon Xi's assuming the party leadership, further reforms were enacted to make the CCDI a ''bona fide'' control and auditing organization governed by a sophisticated set of rules and regulations to ensure professionalism and procedural fairness.  Under Xi, the CCDI became much less likely to face interference from local barons and vested interests in performing its duties.&lt;ref name="SCMPXi"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1661370/chinas-anti-corruption-watchdogs-inspectors-sent-central-committee | author = Pinghui, Zhuang | publisher = [[SCMP Group]] | work = [[South China Morning Post]] | accessdate = 21 December 2014 | date = 12 December 2014 | title = Anti-corruption watchdog to penetrate Communist Party core }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also strengthened internal regulations on the manner in which investigations are to be conducted, to ensure that CCDI officials themselves do not abuse their power and break the very same rules they are tasked with enforcing.&lt;ref name=chengli&gt;{{cite news|title=中央纪委决定成立纪检监察干部监督室|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/renshi/2014-03/12/c_126254892.htm|publisher=''Xinhua''|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public perception===
There was some initial cynicism among the Chinese public about the intent of the campaign and its effectiveness. Earlier on, domestic and international observers commented on the possibility that the campaign is an emblematic feature of Chinese political culture which has, since its imperial days, invariably attempted tackling corruption in a high-profile manner when a new leader comes to power. The 2014 ranking of countries by the [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] actually ranked China lower than a year before, falling to 100th from 80th place.&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite news|title=China slips down corruption perception index, despite high-profile crackdown|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/12/03/world/asia/china-transparency-international-corruption-2014/|publisher=CNN|date=December 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the extent and reach of the campaign has surprised even the most seasoned Chinese political observers.&lt;ref name="ChinaPowerCSIS"/&gt;&lt;ref name=theguardian&gt;{{cite news|last1=Branigan|first1=Tania|title=Politburo, army, casinos: China’s corruption crackdown spreads|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/14/china-corruption-crackdown-spreads-xi-jinping|work=The Guardian|date=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a general consensus in the Chinese legal community that the endemic corruption is caused by the lack of an independent judiciary and a failure to enforce laws and regulations. They contend that these problems will not be permanently fixed until much deeper systemic problems are addressed.&lt;ref name=nytimes2/&gt; ''[[Guanxi]]'' and other social customs, may have also contributed to the prevalence of practices seen as corrupt from a strictly legal perspective but seem relatively benign from a cultural standpoint.&lt;ref name=theguardian/&gt; Gift-giving during holidays, securing patrons for career advancement, hosting banquets at expensive restaurants to secure minor deals, exchanging favours, and navigating the complex web of ''[[guanxi]]'' to get things done was seen as an ordinary part of Chinese life.&lt;ref name=theguardian/&gt; Indeed, many people did not see these activities as illegal or even morally problematic.  Moreover, many regulations and law governing cadre work and public service were rarely enforced, resulting in two prevailing winds among Chinese officialdom that "if everyone else is doing it then it must be okay," and that "I probably won't ever be caught anyway".&lt;ref name=nifake&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chen|first1=Stephen|title=Ni Fake's downfall plays out in a moral maze in Chinese media|url=http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1403215/ni-fakes-downfall-plays-out-moral-maze-chinese-media|work=South China Morning Post|date=January 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names and terminology==
The term "belly dance" is a translation of the [[French (language)|French]] term "danse du ventre", which was applied to the dance in the [[Victorian era]], and referred to Egyptian and oriental female dances.

In Arabic, the dance is known as ''[[Raqs Sharqi]]'' ("Eastern Dance") or as ''[[Baladi#Raqs Baladi|Raqs Baladi]]'' in [[Egyptian Arabic]] ("Country Dance" or "Folk Dance").

[[File:Dalilah bailando danza oriental en la Esfinge.jpg|thumb|[[Dalilah (bellydancer)|Dalilah]] filming Keyf Ansak in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]] 1957.]] Belly dance is primarily a torso-driven dance, with an emphasis on articulations of the hips.&lt;ref name="Varga2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Varga Dinicu|first=Carolena|title=You Asked Aunt Rocky: Answers &amp; Advice About Raqs Sharqi &amp; Raqs Shaabi|year=2011|publisher=RDI Publications, LLC|location=Virginia Beach, VA, USA|isbn=978-0-9830690-4-1|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike many Western [[dance]] forms, the focus of the dance is on isolations of the [[torso]] muscles, rather than on movements of the limbs through space. Although some of these isolations appear similar to the isolations used in jazz ballet, they are sometimes driven differently and have a different feeling or emphasis.

In common with most folk dances, there is no universal naming scheme for belly dance movements. Some dancers and dance schools have developed their own naming schemes, but none of these is universally recognized.

[[File:Bellydance-ikebukuro-japan-sept24-2016.ogv|thumb|(video) A belly dancer on stage in [[Japan]], 2016]]

===Movements found in belly dance===
Many of the movements characteristic of belly dance can be grouped into the following categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wise|first=Josephine|title=The JWAAD Book of Bellydance|year=2012|publisher=JWAAD Ltd |location=Croydon, UK |isbn=978-0-9573105-0-6 |pages=60–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Percussive movements''': Staccato movements, most commonly of the hips, used to punctuate the music or accent a beat. Typical movements in this group include hip drops, vertical hip rocks, outwards hip hits, hip lifts and hip twists. Percussive movements using other parts of the body can include lifts or drops of the ribcage and shoulder accents.
* '''Fluid movements''': Flowing, sinuous movements in which the body is in continuous motion, used to interpret melodic lines and lyrical sections in the music, or modulated to express complex instrumental improvisations. These movements require a great deal of abdominal muscle control. Typical movements include horizontal and vertical figures of 8 or infinity loops with the hips, horizontal or tilting hip circles, and undulations of the hips and abdomen. These basic shapes may be varied, combined and embellished to create an infinite variety of complex, textured movements.
* '''Shimmies, shivers and vibrations''': Small, fast, continuous movements of the hips or ribcage, which create an impression of texture and depth of movement. Shimmies are commonly layered over other movements, and are often used to interpret rolls on the or [[riq]] or fast strumming of the [[oud]] or [[qanun (instrument)]]. There are many types of shimmy, varying in size and method of generation. Some common shimmies include relaxed, up and down hip shimmies, straight-legged knee-driven shimmies, fast, tiny hip vibrations, twisting hip shimmies, bouncing 'earthquake' shimmies, and relaxed shoulder or ribcage shimmies.

In addition to these torso movements, dancers in many styles will use level changes, travelling steps, turns and spins. The arms are used to frame and accentuate movements of the hips, for dramatic gestures, and to create beautiful lines and shapes with the body, particularly in the more balletic, Westernised styles. Other movements may be used as occasional accents, such as low kicks and arabesques, backbends, and head tosses.

==In the Middle East==

===Origins and history===
Belly dancing is believed to have had a long history in the [[Middle East]], but reliable evidence about its origins is scarce, and accounts of its history are often highly speculative.&lt;ref name="Deagon"/&gt;  Several Greek and Roman sources including [[Juvenal]] and [[Martial]] describe dancers from Asia Minor and Spain using undulating movements, playing [[castanets]], and sinking to the floor with "quivering thighs", descriptions that are certainly suggestive of the movements that are today associated with belly dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buonaventura|first=Wendy|title=Serpent of the Nile: Women and Dance in the Arab World|year=1989|publisher=Saqi|isbn=978-0-86356-628-8|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, particularly in the 18th and 19th centuries, European travellers in the Middle East such as [[Edward William Lane|Edward Lane]] and [[Flaubert]] wrote extensively of the dancers they saw there, including the [[Almeh|Awalim]] and [[Ghawazee]] of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buonaventura|first=Wendy|title=Serpent of the Nile: Women and Dance in the Arab World|year=1989|publisher=Saqi|isbn=978-0-86356-628-8|pages=56–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[Culture of the Ottoman Empire#Dance|Ottoman Empire]] belly dance was performed by both boys and women in the Sultan's palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://azizasaid.wordpress.com/2008/08/31/a-question-of-kocek-men-in-skirts/|title=A Question of Köçek – Men in Skirts|website=Azizasaid}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tahmasp, Humayun Meeting.jpg|thumb|225px|Tahmasp, Humayun Meeting]]

===Social context===
Belly dance in the Middle East has two distinct social contexts: as a folk or social dance, and as a performance art.

As a social dance, belly dance (also called [[Baladi|Raqs Baladi]] or Raqs Shaabi in this context) is performed at celebrations and social gatherings by ordinary people (male and female, young and old), in their ordinary clothes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wise|first=Josephine|title=The JWAAD Book of Bellydance|year=2012|publisher=JWAAD Ltd.|isbn=978-0-9573105-0-6|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more conservative or traditional societies, these events may be gender segregated, with separate parties where men and women dance separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Rawi|first=Rosina Fawzia|title=Grandmother's Secrets: The Ancient Rituals and Healing Power of Belly Dancing |year=1999|publisher=Interlink Books|isbn=978-1-56656-302-4|pages=20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, professional dance performers were the [[Almeh|Awalim]] (primarily musicians and poets), [[Ghawazi]], and [[Köçekler]]. The Maazin sisters may have been the last authentic performers of Ghawazi dance in Egypt, with Khayreyya Maazin still teaching and performing as of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gildedserpent.com/cms/2009/08/10/habibaghawazi/ Gilded Serpent "The Ghawazee: Back from the Brink of Extinction"].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern era, professional performers (including dancers, singers, and actors) are not considered to be respectable in the Middle East, and there is a strong social stigma attached to female performers in particular, since they display their bodies in public, which is considered [[haram]] in [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=van Nieuwkerk|first=Karin|title=A Trade Like Any Other: Female Singers and Dancers in Egypt|year=1995|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-9774244117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Egypt===
[[File:Randa Kamel Egyptian Bellydancer 2007 1.jpg|210px|thumb|Randa Kamel, Egyptian belly dancer]]
Many bellydancers work in Cairo.

The modern Egyptian belly dance style (and the modern costume) are said to have originated in Cairo's nightclubs then been used in [[Cinema of Egypt|Egyptian cinema]]. Many of the local dancers went on to appear in Egyptian films and had a great influence on the development of the Egyptian style and became famous like [[Samia Gamal]] and [[Taheyya Kariokka]] both of whom helped attract the eyes to Egyptian style worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bellydanceu.net/styles/bellydance-styles-egyptian-raqs-sharqi/|title=Bellydance Styles: Egyptian Raqs Sharqi|website=BellydanceU.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egyptian belly dance is noted for its controlled, precise movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bellydanceforums.net/threads/6267-buzz-words-and-dancers|title=buzz words and dancers|website=Belly Dance Forums|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Turkey===
Turkish belly dance is referred to in Turkey as Oryantal Dans, or simply 'Oryantal'. The Turkish style of bellydance is lively and playful, with a greater outward projection of energy than the more contained Egyptian style. Turkish dancers are known for their energetic, athletic (even gymnastic) style, and their adept use of [[finger cymbals]], also known as [[zill|zils]].  Connoisseurs of Turkish dance often say a dancer who cannot play the zils is not an accomplished dancer. Floorwork, which has been banned in Egypt since the mid-20th century, is still an important part of Turkish bellydance.

Another distinguishing element of Turkish style is the use of a 9/8 rhythm, counted as 12-34-56-789, often referred to as [[Karsilama]] rhythm. Karşilama, in Turkish dance, is not a rhythm but a folkdance performed in a line, where as a 9/8 (dokuz sekiz) rhythm defines the count of the rhythm and is used both karşilama and Roman havasi.

Many professional dancers and musicians in Turkey continue to be of [[Romani people|Romani]] heritage, and the Roma people of Turkey have had a strong influence on the Turkish style&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mourat|first=Elizabeth 'Artemis'|title=Turkish Dancing|url=http://www.serpentine.org/artemis/turkishdance.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Lebanon===
Lebanese style belly dance is somewhere between the Egyptian and Turkish styles. Lebanese dance takes from the classic oriental dance, but still incorporates a feisty, modern edge. There are large steps, backward leans to the torso, twisting hip rotations, large and busy arms and lots of shimmies. The types of techniques that are used in Lebanese style dance are quick layered shimmies and subtle internal movements.  Lebanese dancers sometimes include kicks, splits, deep back bends, and Turkish drops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://babayagamusic.com/Encyclopedic-Dictionary-Ethnic-Arts/lebanese-belly-dance.htm|title=LEBANESE BELLY DANCE|website=babayagamusic.com|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outside the Middle East==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2017}}
Belly dance was popularized in the West during the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement of the 18th and 19th centuries, when [[orientalism|Orientalist]] artists depicted romanticized images of [[harem]] life in the [[Ottoman Empire]].

===In North America===
[[File:Little egypt dancer.JPG|thumb|Little Egypt]]
[[File:Rachel Brice 1 DSC 0126.jpeg|thumb|American tribal fusion dancer Rachel Brice]]

Although there were dancers of this type at the 1876 Centennial in Philadelphia, it was not until the 1893 Chicago [[World's Fair]] that it gained national attention. The term "belly dancing" is often credited to [[Sol Bloom]], its entertainment director, but referred to the dance as ''danse du ventre'', the name used by the French in Algeria. In his memoirs, Bloom states, "when the public learned that the literal translation was "belly dance", they delightedly concluded that it must be salacious and immoral ... I had a gold mine."

Authentic dancers from several Middle Eastern and North African countries performed at the Fair, including Syria, Turkey and Algeria—but it was the dancers in the Egyptian Theater of The Street in the Cairo exhibit who gained the most notoriety.  The fact that the dancers were uncorseted and gyrated their hips was shocking to Victorian sensibilities.  There were no soloists, but it is claimed that a dancer nicknamed [[Little Egypt (dancer)|Little Egypt]] stole the show. Some claim the dancer was [[Little Egypt (dancer)|Farida Mazar Spyropoulos]], but this fact is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Donna Carlton (1995) ''Looking for Little Egypt''. Bloomington, Indiana: International Dance Discovery Books. {{ISBN|0-9623998-1-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of these dancers subsequently spawned dozens of imitators, many of whom claimed to be from the original troupe. Victorian society continued to be affronted by the dance, and dancers were sometimes arrested and fined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1893/12/07/archives/no-more-midway-dancing-three-of-the-egyptian-girls-finded-each.html|title=NO MORE MIDWAY DANCING; THREE OF THE EGYPTIAN GIRLS FINDED EACH. Manager Delareix, Disgusted at New-York's Benighted Taste, Declared He Would Seek a More Cultured City--By Evening He Had Thought Better of It, and His|date=7 December 1893|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dance was nicknamed the "[[Hoochie coochie]]", or the shimmy and shake. A short film, "Fatima's Dance", was widely distributed in the [[Nickelodeon (movie theater)|Nickelodeon]] theaters. It drew criticism for its "immodest" dancing, and was eventually censored. Belly dance drew men in droves to burlesque theaters, and to carnival and circus lots.

[[Thomas Edison]] made several [[film]]s of dancers in the 1890s.  These included a Turkish dance, and Crissie Sheridan in 1897,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mbrsmi/varsmp.1143|title=Crissie Sheridan / Thomas A. Edison, Inc.|website=hdl.loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Princess Rajah from 1904,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mbrsmi/varsmp.1821|title=Princess Rajah dance / American Mutoscope and Biograph Company.|website=hdl.loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; which features a dancer playing [[zill]]s, doing "floor work", and balancing a chair in her teeth.

[[Ruth St. Denis]] also used Middle Eastern-inspired dance in D. W. Griffith's silent film ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'', her goal being to lift dance to a respectable art form at a time when dancers were considered to be women of loose morals. Hollywood began producing films such as ''[[The Sheik (film)|The Sheik]]'', ''[[Cleopatra (1917 film)|Cleopatra]]'', and ''[[Salomé (1923 film)|Salomé]]'', to capitalize on Western fantasies of the orient.

When immigrants from Arab States began to arrive in New York in the 1930s, dancers started to perform in nightclubs and restaurants.  In the late 1960s and early '70s many dancers began teaching. Middle Eastern or Eastern bands took dancers with them on tour, which helped spark interest in the dance.

Although using Turkish and Egyptian movements and music, American Cabaret ("AmCab") belly dancing has developed its own distinctive style, using props and encouraging audience interaction.

In 1987, a distinctively American style of group improvisational dance, [[American Tribal Style Belly Dance]], (ATS), was created.  Although a unique and wholly modern style, its steps are based on existing dance techniques, including those from [[North India]], the Middle East, and [[Africa]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribalbellydance.org/about.html|title=About Tribal Bellydance|website=Tribalbellydance.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Many forms of [[Tribal Fusion (dance form)|"Tribal Fusion"]] belly dance have also developed, incorporating elements from many other dance and music styles including [[flamenco]], ballet, [[burlesque]], [[hula hoop]] and even [[hip hop]].  [[Gothic bellydance|"Gothic Belly Dance"]] is a style which incorporates elements from [[Goth subculture]].

===In Spain===
Belly dancers are thought to have come to Spain from Lebanon in the time of the [[Phoenicia]]ns (11th Century BC to 5th Century BC). When Arab family of the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Umayyad]] came to Spain, they sent Basque singers and dancers to Damascus and Egypt for training in the Middle Eastern style. These dancers came to be known as Al Andalus dancers. It is theorised that the fusion of the Al-Andalus style with the dances of the [[Romani people in Spain|Gypsies]] led to the creation of [[flamenco]].

Belly dance did not return to Spain until the 1980s, with the end of the Catholic regime of [[Francoist Spain|Franco]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===In Australia===
The first wave of interest in belly dancing in Australia was during the late 1970s to 1980s with the influx of migrants and refugees escaping troubles in the Middle East, including drummer [[Jamal Zraika]].  These immigrants created a social scene including numerous Lebanese and Turkish restaurants, providing employment for belly dancers. [[Rozeta Ahalyea]] is widely regarded as the "mother" of Australian belly dance, training early dance pioneers such as [[Amera Eid]] and [[Terezka Drnzik]]. Belly dance has now spread across the country, with belly dance communities in every capital city and many regional centres.

===In the United Kingdom===
Belly dance has been in evidence in the UK since the early 1960s. During the 1970s and 1980s, there was a thriving Arabic club scene in London, with live Arabic music and bellydancing a regular feature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Asmahan of London|title=Gilded Serpent, Part 1|url=http://www.gildedserpent.com/cms/2012/01/15/asmahan-arabic-nightclubs-london-part1/|work=Gilded Serpent}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the last of these closed in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Asmahan of London|title=Gilded Serpent, Part 2|url=http://www.gildedserpent.com/cms/2012/03/09/asmahan-golden-era-arab-nightclubs-london-p2/|work=Gilded Serpent|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several prominent members of the British bellydance community began their dance careers working in these clubs.

Today, there are fewer traditional venues for Arabic dance in the UK; however, there is a large amateur bellydance community.  Several international bellydance festivals are now held in Britain. In addition, there are a growing number of competitions, which have increased in popularity in recent years.

The UK bellydance scene leans strongly towards the Egyptian/Arabic style, with little Turkish influence. [[American Tribal Style]] and [[Tribal Fusion]] bellydance are also popular.

==Costume==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2013}}

The costume most commonly associated with belly dance is the 'bedlah' ({{lang-ar|بدلة}}; literally "suit") style, which typically includes a fitted top or bra, a fitted hip belt, and a full-length skirt or harem pants. The bra and belt may be richly decorated with beads, sequins, crystals, coins, beaded fringe and embroidery. The belt may be a separate piece, or sewn into a skirt.

[[Badia Masabni]], a Cairo [[cabaret]] owner during the early 20th century, is credited with creating the modern bedlah style. It has been suggested that the bedlah was inspired by glamorous Hollywood costuming, or created to appeal to Western visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gildedserpent.com/cms/2013/03/28/leyla-amir-bedlah-not-from-hollywood/|title=Gilded Serpent}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Earlier costumes were made up of a full skirt, light chemise and tight cropped vest with heavy embellishments and jewelry.

As well as the two-piece bedlah costume, full length dresses are sometimes worn, especially when dancing more earthy baladi styles. Dresses range from closely fitting, highly decorated gowns, which often feature heavy embellishments and mesh-covered cutouts, to simpler designs which are often based on traditional clothing.

===Costume in Egypt===
In Egypt dancers wear a bedlah.  Alternatively they may wear a dress with mesh-filled cutouts.

===Costume in Lebanon===
As there is no prohibition on showing the abdomen in Lebanon, the bedlah style is more common. The skirts tend to be more sheer than Egyptian outfits, showing more of the dancer's body. The veil is more widely used than in Egypt. High heels are commonly worn. Lebanese dancers have more freedom than Egyptian style dancers in the type of costume they choose to wear.

===Costume in Turkey===
Turkish costumes are usually in the bedlah style. Distinctive features of many Turkish costumes include a V-shaped or triangular belt which may be shaped or contoured around the top edge, and a great deal of embellishment and beaded fringing on both the bra and the belt. Skirts are often fuller than their Egyptian counterparts, and are likely to be made of chiffon or velvet rather than lycra.

In the 1980s and '90s a very revealing costume style developed with skirts designed to display both legs up to the hip, and plunging bras or even pasties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orientaldancer.net/belly-dance-library/belly-dance-costumes/belly-dance-costumes.php|website=Orientaldancer.net|title=Belly Dance Costumes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such styles still exist in some venues but there are also many Turkish belly dancers who wear more moderate costumes. Even so, many Turkish belly dance costumes reflect the playful, flirty style of Turkish belly dance.

===Tribal style costumes===
[[File:Costume Decorations.jpg|thumb|Decorations on a tribal-style bellydance costume bra]]
Tribal belly dance costumes draw inspiration from traditional folkloric costumes across the globe and include circle skirts, pantaloons, and turbans or headdresses decked with feathers or flowers.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Health==
Belly dance is a non-impact, weight-bearing exercise and is thus suitable for all ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dallal|first=Tamalyn|title=Belly Dancing For Fitness|year=2004|publisher=Ulysses Press|location=Berkley|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1sYgd9gunLEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=belly+dance+fitness|isbn=9781569754108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lo Iacono|first=Valeria|title=WorldBellydance.com|url= http://www.worldbellydance.com/health-benefits-belly-dance/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the moves involve isolations, which improves flexibility of the torso. Belly dance moves are beneficial to the spine, as the full-body undulation moves lengthens (decompress) and strengthens the entire column of spinal and abdominal muscles in a gentle way.

Dancing with a veil can help build strength in the upper body, arm and shoulders. Playing the [[zill]]s trains fingers to work independently and builds strength. The legs and long muscles of the back are strengthened by hip movements.&lt;ref&gt;Coluccia, Pina, Anette Paffrath, and Jean Putz. ''Belly Dancing: The Sensual Art of Energy and Spirit''. Rochester, Vt: Park Street Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The titular character of the ''[[Shantae]]'' series of video games developed by [[Wayforward Technologies]] is a belly dancing "half-genie", who uses magical belly dances to transform into various animals.

The Brazilian [[telenovela]] ''[[O Clone]]'' (also known as ''[[El Clon]]'' in [[Hispanophone|Spanish-speaking countries]] and the United States) is set in Brazil and Morocco and featured belly dancing in many episodes. The lead character, Jade ([[Giovanna Antonelli]]), used it to entice her lover Lucas ([[Murilo Benício]]) and to soothe and seduce her husband Said (Dalton Vigh).

Several [[James Bond films]] (including ''From Russia with Love'') and [[music video]]s have featured belly dancers. In ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'', the belly dancer Saida wears a spent bullet in her navel, which Bond accidentally swallows while trying to retrieve it.

Documentaries about belly dance include ''[[American Bellydancer]]'', ''Journey of Desire: A Foreign Dancer in Cairo'', ''Belly, Sensual... Scarred... Sacred'', and ''Bellydancers of Cairo''.

{{Unreferenced|date=January 2009}}
The '''''Capayanes''''' were an indigenous people, now extinct, that lived in Argentine territory.

==Description==
Their geographical area was partly of the provinces of [[La Rioja Province (Argentina)|La Rioja]], [[Catamarca Province|Catamarca]], [[San Juan Province, Argentina|San Juan]], from the mountainous zone understood to be between the limit of La Rioja with Catamarca on [[Colorado river]] and the surroundings of [[Jáchal river]]-Zanjón, in San Juan, including  Andes, in the western part, up to the cords of the Velasco, where they were mixed with the [[Diaguita]]s.  They occupied the fertile valleys of [[Famatina]], [[Sanagasta]], [[Yacampis]], [[Guandacol]] and [[Jáchal]]. They had as neighbors in the northern part the diaguitas and in the southern part the [[huarpe]]s.

==Language==
They shared with the [[diaguita]]s or [[pazioca]]s the language [[Cacán language|Kakán]], or a derivation of it. Vestiges of their language are in completions as bis, wee or small stone, for example: Yacampis, Quilmebis, Guanchina, etc.

==Technology==
The Capayán knew the technology of the thread, and spun the wool of [[guanaco]] and [[Lama glama|llamas]]. Also they knew the metallurgy of [[copper]] and [[gold]]. They constructed channels and irrigation ditches to water their farmlands. Their cultivars were [[maize]], [[zapallo]], [[potato]] and [[quínoa]].  They widely used ceramics, principally in the production of funeral urns, decorated geometrically with the colors black, red and white, known as [[Sanagasta style]] or [[Angualasto style]].

Their houses were of [[mud]] and [[adobe]] and were sometimes built at the foot of a great tree used as a roof. This technology of construction still lasts in the Riojan zone of [[Vinchina]].

==Decline==
About 1480, the Inca invaded the region of the [[diaguita]]s and capayanes, incorporating their territories into the [[Inca Empire]] ([[Tawantinsuyu]]). From 1607, the [[Spanish conquest]] resulted in their dispersion and later extinction at the end of the 18th century.  The capayanes took part in an uprising in 1632 together with the [[olongasta]]s and other diaguitas.

Today a Catamarca's department takes their name (See [[Capayán Department]]).

==  Etymology and ethnic filiation ==
The etymology of the name started to this people seems to be the word rune simi [[Kapak ñan]] (''Great way''), that is to say usually so called " [[Inca road system|Way of the Inca]] ". The explanation for this would be in that the territory that they were living age sedates of a knot of communications very importantly in the south of the ''Tawantinsuyu''.
The majority of the authors consider the capayán due to the cultural common features (for example the use of the language kakán) as one of the parts of the [[pazioca]] ("[[diaguita]]s"), in the same way that it were the [[calchaquí]]es, olongastas, quilmes, though they would have differed for the genetic and cultural influence of the neighbors [[huarpe]]s and after 1480 for the presence of [[Mitimae|Mitmakuna]] deported persons up to the region for the Incas, many of such mitimaes would have trade and manufacture of [[chicha|alcoholic maize drink]] and [[churumata]].

According to UNICEF, [[child marriage]] is the "formal marriage or informal union before age 18," and it affects more girls than boys.&lt;ref name="UNICEF: child marriage"&gt;{{cite web|work=Child protection from violence, exploitation and abuse: Child marriage|publisher=UNICEF|accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Afghanistan]], 57% of girls are married before they are 19.&lt;ref name="Medica Mondiale"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bahgam|first=S|author2=Mukhatari|title=Study on Child Marriage in Afghanistan|journal=Medica Mondiale|year=2004|pages=1–20|url=http://www.medicamondiale.org/fileadmin/content/07_Infothek/Afghanistan/Afghanistan_Child_marriage_medica_mondiale_study_2004_e.pdf|accessdate=15 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506222217/http://www.medicamondiale.org/fileadmin/content/07_Infothek/Afghanistan/Afghanistan_Child_marriage_medica_mondiale_study_2004_e.pdf|archivedate=6 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common ages for girls to get married are 15 and 16.&lt;ref name="Post-Taliban Afghanistan: Changed Outlook for Women?"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riphenburg|first=Carol|title=Post-Taliban Afghanistan: Changed Outlook for Women?|journal=Asian Survey|date=May–June 2004|volume=44|issue=3|pages=401–422|doi=10.1525/as.2004.44.3.401}}&lt;!--|accessdate=29 March 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Factors such as gender dynamics, family structure, cultural, political, and economic perceptions/ideologies all play a role in determining if a girl is married at a young age.&lt;ref name="Decisions, Desires and Diversity: Marriage Practices in Afghanistan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Deborah|title=Decisions, Desires and Diversity: Marriage Practices in Afghanistan|journal=Afghanistan Research &amp; Evaluation Unit (AREU)|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The practice of child marriage has been linked to detrimental consequences for girls, such as the inability to obtain an education and skills to work independently.&lt;ref name="Decisions, Desires and Diversity: Marriage Practices in Afghanistan" /&gt; Girls may also suffer physical harm, as their bodies are often not developed for childbirth, resulting in emotional, mental, and physical trauma for both the girl and her child.&lt;ref name="Decisions, Desires and Diversity: Marriage Practices in Afghanistan" /&gt;

== Laws regarding child marriage ==

=== Afghan Government Law ===

According to Afghan Civil Law Article 40, "marriage is a contract between a male and female 
for the establishment of a family." &lt;ref name="Medica Mondiale" /&gt; Article 70 sets the legal age of marriage to be 16 for females and 18 for males; Article 71 (subsection 1) gives a girl's marriage rights to her father or guardian before the legal age of 16, and marriages for minors under the age of 15 are not allowed under any circumstance.&lt;ref name="Medica Mondiale" /&gt; Despite the establishment of Civil Law, regional customs take precedence over national law, as well as [[Sharia law]]. Due to shortcomings in the implementation of the Civil law, child marriages are still prevalent.&lt;ref name="Decisions, Desires and Diversity: Marriage Practices in Afghanistan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Early Marriage in Afghanistan"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Early Marriage in Afghanistan|journal=Women and Children Legal Research Foundation|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While new laws are being introduced progressively, the [[U.N. Development Programme]]’s annual [[Gender Inequality Index]] still ranks Afghanistan as the sixth worst country for female equality in the world.&lt;ref name=three&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Kay|title=Child bride’s torture renews Afghan rights worries|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/122927/child-brides-torture-renews-afghan-rights-worries|accessdate=24 February 2012|newspaper=Associated Press|date=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics from the [[Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission]] showed that about 60-80% of the total marriages in Afghanistan are [[Forced marriage|forced]] and/or [[Child marriage|underage marriage]].&lt;ref name=four&gt;{{cite web|title=Afghanistan: The tribulations of child-bearing children|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/4b28a1421e.html|publisher=Integrated Regional Information Networks (IRIN)|accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 2009, Afghanistan passed the Law on the Elimination of Violence Against Women (EVAW), which guarantees penalties for domestic violence, abuses against women, as well as forced child marriage, yet the implementation of this law has not been thoroughly enforced, as there is also opposition for the law. In 2013, the Afghan parliament passed a law preventing girls from testifying against forced marriages, and the EVAW was protested by students at Kabul University, who deemed it "un-Islamic".&lt;ref name="Afghanistan: Ending Child Marriage and Domestic Violence" /&gt;

=== Sharia law ===

In [[Islam]], marriage represents a couple’s acknowledgement of their social responsibility and an agreement to abide by the marriage contract’s terms and conditions. One of the conditions in the Islam marriage contract requires the verbal and written [[consent]] of both the bride and groom, as well as the female’s acceptance of the male’s proposal.&lt;ref name=two&gt;{{cite web|last=Huda|title=The Islamic MarriageContract|url=http://islam.about.com/od/marriage/a/contract.htm|accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sharia]] law, also known as Islamic law, dictates the following regulations concerning marriage: 
* "There should be adulthood and sanity of both parties 
* In case of non-adulthood, guardianship of father or grandfather is required for marriage. 
* Father and grandfather are proprietors of their children and can marry them off." &lt;ref name="Medica Mondiale" /&gt;

Islam, particularly the [[Sunni]] school of [[Hanafi]], is central to Afghan culture. From the mid-18th to mid-19th century, Afghan society was mostly decentralized, leaving different ethnic groups to decide how they should practice and implement Hanafi principles. However, research has shown that family judges often made rulings that ignored the rights of women outlined in Sharia.&lt;ref name="Post-Taliban Afghanistan: Changed Outlook for Women?" /&gt;  

Later, from 1880 to 1901, the Afghan ruler Amir Abd al-Rahman Khan created royal decrees based on Sharia which sought to eliminate child and forced marriage. Similarly, as ruler from 1901-1919, his son Amir Habibullah Khan kept the same legislation in place in order to advance the rights of women.&lt;ref name="Post-Taliban Afghanistan: Changed Outlook for Women?" /&gt; 

From 1973-1978, President Muhammad Daoud passed legislation related to family law, which was based on the more liberal [[Maliki]] law, and Decree Number 7 outlawed child marriage for girls under 16 and boys under 18 years of age. Punishment for violators was also implemented, which included imprisonment for up to three years.&lt;ref name="Post-Taliban Afghanistan: Changed Outlook for Women?" /&gt;

== Reasons for child marriage ==
=== Compensation ===
{{See|Baad (practice)}}

[[Baad (practice)|Badal]], or marriage based on exchange, happens when two families agree to exchange female members of their families, often to offset the cost of a marriage or to strengthen familial ties.&lt;ref name="Early Marriage in Afghanistan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Afghanistan: Marriage"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Afghanistan: Marriage|journal=Landinfo|year=2011|pages=1–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baad, or compensation, is a marriage that occurs to compensate a victim's family if a crime has been committed. Young girls are married into the victim's family, which is supposed to resolve the conflict.&lt;ref name="Afghanistan: Marriage" /&gt; Girls are also placed into marriages in order to repay large debts.&lt;ref name="Early Marriage in Afghanistan" /&gt; 

=== Rural and socioeconomic ===
In a study included in the report "Early marriage in Afghanistan," regional differences accounted for a vast difference in child marriage incidence. Of the girls interviewed, 59% came from rural areas while 41% were from urban cities. Of those married at age 12, 75% resided in rural areas, as well.&lt;ref name="Early Marriage in Afghanistan" /&gt; Literacy rate also displayed a strong correlation with child marriage, as out of 200 interviewees, 71% of parents who forced their daughters to marry, as well as 70% of the girls, and 50% of the husbands were illiterate.&lt;ref name="Early Marriage in Afghanistan" /&gt; 

Poverty also proves to be a factor, as well, as parents marry girls because they have no financial resources to support them; unfortunately, when a girl is a child bride, it limits the opportunity for employment, and 94.3% of women interviewed reported they were unemployed, as they were subject to a childhood marriage.&lt;ref name="Early Marriage in Afghanistan" /&gt; Daughters may also be given into marriage in order for parents to obtain economic benefits from the dowry, and since parents are often uneducated, marriage seems like an appropriate option for a girl's  future stability.&lt;ref name="What Works to Prevent Child Marriage:  A Review of the Evidence"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee-Rife|first=Susan|author2=Anju Malhorta |author3=Ann Warner |author4=Allison McGonagle Glinski |title=What Works to Prevent Child Marriage:  A Review of the Evidence|journal=Studies in Family Planning|volume=43|issue=4|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==

=== Health ===
Early child marriage places both the girl's health, as well as her child's health in jeopardy. Malnutrition, abuse, and HIV infection are a few of the detrimental health complications associated with early marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hampton|first=Tracy|title=Child Marriage Threatens Girls' Health|journal=The Journal of the American Medical Association|year=2010|pages=509–510}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been reported that the risk of dying from childbirth and pregnancy is two times higher for girls between the ages of 15 and 19 than for older women.&lt;ref name=six&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jain, Saranga  |author2=Kurz, Kathleen|title=New Insights on Preventing Child Marriage|url=http://www.icrw.org/files/publications/New-Insights-on-Preventing-Child-Marriage.pdf|publisher=The United States Agency for International Development|accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, compounded with the fact that child marriages tend to occur in societies with poorer healthcare, results in higher rates of [[pregnancy complications]] and [[maternal mortality]].&lt;ref name=seven&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raj|first=A.|title=When the mother is a child: the impact of child marriage on the health and human rights of girls|journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood|date=7 October 2010|volume=95|issue=11|pages=931–935|doi=10.1136/adc.2009.178707|pmid=20930011}}&lt;!--|accessdate=24 February 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Afghanistan, 34.1% of mothers who married early had children that were physically weak and 8.9% have reported that their children were born with a disability, in contrast to children in the United States, where 15 percent of children have a disability. Approximately 40.4% of early wed mothers report having a gynecological disease, and 20.2% suffer from a psychological disease.&lt;ref name="Early Marriage in Afghanistan" /&gt; 

Outside of sub-Saharan Africa, Afghanistan has the second highest incidence of maternal deaths, and 32% of all deaths for girls ages 15–19 are pregnancy-related while 47% of deaths for women who were in the age range of 20-24 were also due to pregnancy complications.&lt;ref name="Afghanistan: Ending Child Marriage and Domestic Violence" /&gt; [[Fistula]] is one of the detrimental health effects caused by child marriage, and the 2011 survey conducted by the Social Health Development Program found that of the 3,040 women interviewed, 67% were between the ages of 16 and 20 when they were diagnosed with an obstetric fistula.&lt;ref name="Afghanistan: Ending Child Marriage and Domestic Violence" /&gt; Young mothers also suffer from pregnancy-induced hypertension as well as a higher risk of HIV infection.&lt;ref name=six /&gt;

=== Education ===
Currently, the [[literacy rate]] for Afghan adolescent girls is about 21%.&lt;ref name="The Complete Mothers' Index 2004"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Complete Mothers' Index 2004|url=http://www.savethechildren.org/atf/cf/%7B9def2ebe-10ae-432c-9bd0-df91d2eba74a%7D/SOWM_2004_final.pdf|work=State of the World's Mothers 2004|publisher=Save The Children|accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once married, a child’s education often comes to an end. Usually, this happens because the child undertakes domestic responsibilities, as well as childcare.&lt;ref name="The Complete Mothers' Index 2004"/&gt; However, even if the child manages to get permission to attend school, the school administrators will often deny her a place in school, which is due to a belief that having married girls in a school is detrimental to the morals of unmarried girls.&lt;ref name="Medica Mondiale" /&gt; Depriving girls of an education inhibits their ability to obtain sustainable economic opportunities, which limits independence and further subjects them to poverty. A lack of education also forces girls to continue living in abusive situations, as they are unaware of other options.&lt;ref name=seven /&gt;

=== Domestic violence ===
[[Domestic violence]] in Afghanistan is often exacerbated due to a variety of factors, such as poverty, illiteracy, and narcotics.&lt;ref name="Early Marriage in Afghanistan" /&gt; The international NGO Global Rights reports in a 2006 survey that "more than 85% of Afghan women reported that they had experienced physical, sexual, or psychological violence or forced marriage."&lt;ref name="Afghanistan: Ending Child Marriage and Domestic Violence"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Afghanistan: Ending Child Marriage and Domestic Violence|journal=Human Rights Watch|year=2009|pages=1–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adverse health and economic impacts are linked to domestic violence, and studies indicate that approximately 2,000 girls have attempted suicide due to the unbearable conditions they were subject to. Even if girls attempt to escape from an abusive relationship, they are accused of running away, which can lead to arrest.&lt;ref name="Afghanistan: Ending Child Marriage and Domestic Violence" /&gt; Because they marry at a young age, girls who are child brides also have less power, which places them in a position where they may lack authority in every-day decisions, and research has shown that in time, they may even justify domestic violence.&lt;ref name=six /&gt;

== International recommendations ==

=== United Nations Population Fund===
In their chapter "Giving Girls A Chance: An Agenda for Action," the [[United Nations Population Fund]] outlined the following strategies for improving the conditions of girls who are most vulnerable to early marriage: 
* Create programs that develop skills and enhance social networks: When girls are allowed to interact with others and have the ability to share their interests by networking, families may find value in their abilities, which may improve their chances of a delayed marriage. Girls will also have more awareness of their rights under the law, and their knowledge concerning overall well-being will also be improved.&lt;ref name="Marrying Too Young: End Child Marriage"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Marrying Too Young: End Child Marriage|journal=UNFPA|year=2012|pages=1–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

* Make formal education/economic opportunities more accessible: Because girls who are illiterate have higher chances of becoming child brides, permitting them to have an education allows them to have access to more opportunities, and the families, as well as communities, will see that this is an alternative option for early marriage. Government incentives, such as subsidies, are possible ways that can encourage families to allow girls to remain in school, as well as free supplies and a safe environment. By providing parents with loans and scholarships for school, a financial burden is lifted, and if employment opportunities are also provided, they give parents more options in regards to a girl's future.&lt;ref name="Marrying Too Young: End Child Marriage" /&gt;

* Change harmful social/cultural norms: By changing the perception of community leaders, as well as parents, in regards to a girl's value and development, child marriage can be discouraged and eventually regarded as detrimental. Community communication, education for parents, and media can all encourage a shift in attitude in order to make such a practice unacceptable.&lt;ref name="Marrying Too Young: End Child Marriage" /&gt;

* Proper implementation of legislation: The creation of laws prohibiting child marriage must be accompanied by proper implementation, particularly a strict adherence to inhibiting any marriages to occur below the age of 18. Birth registration also makes the federal government accountable for upholding such laws, as without proper registration, girls may be subject to marriage even though are not the legal age.&lt;ref name="Marrying Too Young: End Child Marriage" /&gt;

=== International human rights declarations ===
Various international conventions have outlined regulations that prohibit child marriage. The following are organizations that have taken a stance against the practice of child marriage: 
* In 1948, Article 16 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], as well as the 1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights made provisions stating that marriage should only be entered with consent of both parties and that equal rights are to be observed in such a union.&lt;ref name="Early Marriage: Child Spouses"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Early Marriage: Child Spouses|journal=Innocenti Digest|year=2001|volume=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

* The 1956 Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery deemed any practice that prohibited women from having a voice or consent, as well as economic gain for the family to be a form of slavery.&lt;ref name="Early Marriage: Child Spouses"/&gt;

* Similarly, the 1964 Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage and Registration of Marriages and the 1979 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women declared that both parties should be willing to enter into the marriage and that child marriage was unacceptable under any circumstance.&lt;ref name="Early Marriage: Child Spouses"/&gt;

in [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] '''Child pornography laws''' are covered by the [[Protection of Children Act 1978]] ("the 1978 Act"), which made it illegal to take, make, distribute, show, or possess for the intent of showing or distributing an indecent photograph of someone under the age of 18. The maximum penalty is 10 years in prison. In the context of digital media, saving an indecent image to a computer's hard drive is considered to be "making" the image, as it causes a copy to exist which did not exist before.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwf.org.uk/police/page.99.209.htm IWF.org.uk], Internet Watch Foundation - R v Bowden&lt;/ref&gt; Indecency is to be interpreted by a jury, who should apply the recognised standards of propriety. 

The prohibition of content on the Internet that is potentially illegal under this law by British [[internet service provider]]s is however [[Industry self-regulation|self-regulatory]], coordinated by the [[non-profit]] [[Charitable organization|charity]] [[Internet Watch Foundation]] (who has partnerships with many major ISPs in the country).

The 1978 Act was extended in 1994 (by the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]]) to cover "[[pseudo-photograph]]s" - images that appear to be photographs. The [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]] amended the age of subjects to which the act applied from under 16 to under 18. In 2008 the Act was further extended (by the [[Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]]) to cover tracings, and other works derived from photographs or pseudo-photographs. In 2009 all [[Legal_status_of_cartoon_pornography_depicting_minors#United_Kingdom|sexual images depicting under 18s]], not just those that were derived from photographs or pseudo-photographs, were criminalised by the [[Coroners and Justice Act 2009]], under which any possession of images also became a criminal offence (whereas before it was legal to possess hard copies of images so long as there was no intention to show or distribute them to others).

Similar legal provisions exist in [[Scotland]] but the 1978 Act does not extend to there.

'''Chinese Haitians''' ([[French language|French]]: ''Sino-Haïtien'') are [[Haiti]]ans of [[China|Chinese]] ancestry who immigrated to or was born in [[Haiti]]. There are about 230 Chinese people living in Haiti as of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebeijing.gov.cn/BeijingInformation/BeijingNewsUpdate/t1100338.htm |title=Chinese in Haiti may be evacuated |publisher=China Daily |date= |accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Many [[Chinese people]] living in Haiti are businessmen in governmental or other businesses while there are other Chinese nationals working in Haitian companies as well. With last names like Wu, Wah, Wawa, Fung, Fong-Ging, Fungcap, were the first known Chinese families arrived in Haiti in the late 1890s, fleeing crumbling dynasties, while continuous waves came into Haiti in the 1970s and 1980s with them mostly coming from Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kreyolicious.com/chinwa-the-story-of-haitis-chinese/6924/ |title=Chinwa: The Untold Story of Chinese-Haitians |publisher=Kreyolicious |date= |accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is only one Chinese restaurant in Haiti, the Wujiayuan Restaurant in [[Pétion-Ville]], an upper-class neighborhood in [[Port-au-Prince]]. The restaurant was arranged as a shelter during the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]] by China's foreign ministry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2010-01/24/content_9367455.htm: Chinese in Haiti find safe haven]&lt;/ref&gt;

About 230 Chinese were in Haiti at the time of the disaster. Most are safe but eight Chinese police officers on a peacekeeping mission died in a collapsed United Nations building.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90776/90883/6867760.html: 8 Chinese peacekeepers buried, 10 missing in Haiti]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Fujimori government ===
Peru's most prominent political corruption scandal is probably the case of [[Alberto Fujimori]], [[Peru]]'s ex-President. Fujimori has been convicted of having ordered killings, embezzlement of public funds, abuse of power and corruption during his 10 years of presidency (1990-2000). In 2006, Fujimori fled to Japan with an alleged USD 600 million of public assets. He has been sentenced to a total of more than 30 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2013/peru|title=Freedom in the World- Peru|publisher=Freedom House|accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his rule, Fujimori helped to maintain the government's image of honesty by using his advisor, Vladimiro Montesinos, to carry out the administration's corrupt procedures.&lt;ref&gt;McMillan, John, and Pablo Zoido (2004). How to Subvert Democracy: Montesinos in Peru. Journal of Economic Perspectives 18.4 (2004): 70&lt;/ref&gt;  Montesinos served as the head of the National Intelligence Service (SIN) where he systemtically bribed politicians, judges, and the news media.&lt;ref&gt;McMillan, John, and Pablo Zoido (2004). How to Subvert Democracy: Montesinos in Peru. Journal of Economic Perspectives 18.4 (2004): 70&lt;/ref&gt; An empirical analysis of Montesinos' corruption conducted by John McMillan and Pablo Zoido describes how Montesinos used over 75% of SIN's unsupervised budget to bribe over 1,600 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;McMillan, John, and Pablo Zoido (2004). How to Subvert Democracy: Montesinos in Peru. Journal of Economic Perspectives 18.4 (2004): 73&lt;/ref&gt; McMillan and Zoido estimate  that at the height of the scandal more than U.S.$3.5 million was being paid monthly to various congressmen, judges and media executives.&lt;ref&gt;McMillan, John, and Pablo Zoido (2004). How to Subvert Democracy: Montesinos in Peru. Journal of Economic Perspectives 18.4 (2004): 82&lt;/ref&gt; The most common bribes were paid to television-channel owners which allowed Fujimori's administration to control the media and politically influence Peruvians.&lt;ref&gt;McMillan, John, and Pablo Zoido (2004).

After further scandals and facing a second impeachment vote, [[Pedro Kuczynski]], his successor, resigned the presidency on 21 March 2018 following the release of videos showing alleged acts of [[vote buying]], presenting his resignation to the Council of Ministers.&lt;ref name="REPresign"&gt;{{cite news|title=PPK renunció a la presidencia del Perú tras 'keikovideos' {{!}} LaRepublica.pe|url=http://larepublica.pe/politica/1214846-ppk-presento-su-renuncia-a-la-presidencia-del-peru-tras-keikovideos|accessdate=21 March 2018|work=[[La República]]|date=21 March 2018|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GESTresign"&gt;{{cite news|title=PPK renunció a la presidencia del Perú|url=https://gestion.pe/peru/pedro-pablo-kuczynski-renuncia-presidencia-peru-229887|accessdate=21 March 2018|work=Gestión|date=21 March 2018|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the [[Odebrecht scandal]] and other controversies, in 2018 all of Peru's living former president were either imprisoned or the focus of corruption investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.as-coa.org/articles/latam-focus-why-perus-political-establishment-scared|title=LatAm in Focus: Why Peru's Political Establishment Is Scared {{!}} AS/COA|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Council of the Americas]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bribery ==
Irregular payments and bribes are often demanded from companies operating in Peru, and government contracts are often awarded to well-connected companies.

'''Corruption in Sweden''' has been defined as "the abuse of power" by [[Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention]] (Brå). By receiving [[Bribery|bribes]], bribe takers abuse their position of power, which is consistent with how the National Anti-Corruption Unit of the [[Swedish Prosecution Authority]] specifies the term. Although bribes and improper rewards are central in the definition of [[Political corruption|corruption]] in [[Sweden]], corruption in the sense of "abuse of power" can also manifest itself in other crimes such as misuse of office, embezzlement, fraud and breach of trust against a principal.&lt;ref name="bra-corruption"&gt;{{cite web|title=Reported Corruption in Sweden|url=http://www.bra.se/download/18.12caa4f91440b31239f1fed/1395400931564/2013_22_Reported_Corruption_in_Sweden.pdf|publisher=[[Brå]]|accessdate=18 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724090643/http://www.bra.se/download/18.12caa4f91440b31239f1fed/1395400931564/2013_22_Reported_Corruption_in_Sweden.pdf|archive-date=2014-07-24|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal definition==
The provisions on bribery and taking a bribe are found in Chapter 10 of the Swedish Penal Code. Bribe giving is the criminal act of giving, promising or offering or receiving, accepting a promise of or demanding an improper reward, for the performance of duties. Anything of direct or indirect value to the recipient can be considered an improper reward. The provisions on taking a bribe and giving a bribe are applicable both within the public and the private sector. They are also applicable on acts of bribery committed abroad or if the persons involved are foreign, provided that the acts of bribery are subject to the jurisdiction of Swedish courts.&lt;ref name="bra-corruption" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Svenska Brottsbalken - 10 kap. 5b §|url=https://lagen.nu/1962:700#K10P5aS1|publisher=lagen.nu|language=Swedish|access-date=2014-07-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412202941/https://lagen.nu/1962:700#K10P5aS1|archive-date=2015-04-12|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Level of corruption==
The level of corruption in Sweden is very low, according to a 2011 pan-European study by [[Transparency International]].&lt;ref name="business-anti-corruption1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Motståndskraft, oberoende, integritet – kan det svenska samhället stå emot korruption?|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/media/3831417/TI-Sverige_ENIS_studie-2.pdf|work=Transparency International Sweden|publisher=Transparency International Sweden|accessdate=17 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203052802/http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/media/3831417/TI-Sverige_ENIS_studie-2.pdf|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ref label|id1|Note 1|1}} Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 6th place out of 180 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017|title=Corruption Perception Index 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180221190927/https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017|archive-date=2018-02-21|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal and institutional framework in Sweden are considered effective in fighting against corruption, and the government agencies are characterized by a high degree of transparency, integrity and accountability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Snapshot of the Sweden Country Profile|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/europe-central-asia/sweden/snapshot.aspx|work=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|publisher=GAN Integrity Solutions|accessdate=17 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110144209/http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/europe-central-asia/sweden/snapshot.aspx|archive-date=2013-11-10|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are some municipal cases showing signs of irregular public procurement procedures between public and private actors.&lt;ref name="business-anti-corruption1"/&gt;
The low levels of corruption are attributed to an efficient public administration, high quality comprehensive services to citizens and enterprises, and a long tradition of openness and transparency of Swedish society and institutions, along with a strong respect for the rule of law, according to an Anti-corruption European Commission report. According to the same report, The Special Eurobarometer on Corruption places Sweden among the countries with the least corruption in the EU. 40% of Swedish respondents believe that corruption is widespread in their country (EU average: 76%) and 12% feel personally affected by corruption in their daily life (EU average: 26%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/organized-crime-and-human-trafficking/corruption/anti-corruption-report/docs/2014_acr_sweden_chapter_en.pdf |format=PDF |title=SWEDEN to the EU Anti-Corruption Report |website=Ec.europa.eu |accessdate=2016-07-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304233950/http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/organized-crime-and-human-trafficking/corruption/anti-corruption-report/docs/2014_acr_sweden_chapter_en.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of cases reported, prosecuted and the number of convictions have been stable over time, according to a 2013 study by Brå. The study found that corruption in Sweden can mostly be described as being simple in nature, in that most cases involve smaller amounts, conference travel, dining and such.&lt;ref name="bra-corruption" /&gt;

==Cases==
===TeliaSonera in Azerbaijan===
The former Swedish agency Televerket, now a private company [[TeliaSonera]] is suspected of involvement in a corruption scandal in Azerbaijan, the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.svd.se/telia-i-misstankt-rekordmuta/om/teliamutorna|title=Telia i härva med misstänkta rekordmutor &amp;#124; SvD|website=Svd.se|date=|accessdate=2016-07-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816163636/http://www.svd.se/telia-i-misstankt-rekordmuta/om/teliamutorna|archive-date=2016-08-16|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Corruption by proxy is the term used in these instances.

A '''countermovement''' in [[sociology]] means a [[social movement]] opposed to another social movement. Whenever one social movement starts up, another group establishes themselves to undermine the previous group. Many social movements start out as an effect of political [[activism]] towards issues that a group disagrees with. “Researchers have used [[resource mobilization]] to study all manner of social and political movements such as [[environmentalism]], [[father's rights]] groups, [[religious movement]]s, and [[abortion rights]]”.&lt;ref name="countermovement1998"&gt;Peckham, Michael. "New Dimensions of Social Movement/Countermovement Interaction: The Case of Scientology and its Internet Critics." Canadian Journal of Sociology 23.4 (1998): 317. Academic Search Complete. EBSCO. Web. 8 Mar. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for the start of countermovement groups is that people are competing for resources for political influence. Countermovement groups are a part of American society that try to compete for government [[legislation]] to support their own views.

The resource mobilization theory is an important issue in countermovements. “Research mobilization theory was a response to social psychological theories that focused on [[grievance]]s and viewed movements as collective identities”.&lt;ref name="countermovement1998"/&gt; This theory suggests that social movements organize their resources to make changes in society that fits in their views. As a social movement starts growing, there are those who oppose their views and in time start countermovements. ''For example, [[pro-life]] and [[pro-choice]] movements are countermovements to each other''. Other issues that have countermovement group have to deal with controversial issues as in [[global warming]], fathers’ rights, [[religion]], and [[war]]. These movements and countermovements will never have a resolution so they try to pass their views into government legislation.&lt;ref name="countermovement1998"/&gt; Countermovements main goal is to oppose the other movement to get their views into the mainstream. Many of these movements try to recruit people to gain popularity and in time gain political support.

==Environment==
{{main|Anti-environmentalism}}
An example of a countermovement has to deal with the environmental issues. Even with scientific facts and statistics that global warming exists, there are still groups that [[environmental skepticism|disagree that our environment is changing]]. As Jacques states, "the reality of doubt in environmental problems is not due to [[science]], but has to deal with [[politics]]--global politics to be specific".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"&gt;Jacques, Peter. "The Rearguard of Modernity: Environmental Skepticism as a Struggle of Citizenship." Global Environmental Politics 6.1 (2006): 76-101. Academic Search Complete. EBSCO. Web. 4 Mar. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Many who are “environmental skeptics” are saying that there are no environmental problems that will threaten humanity. Many of these skeptics are blaming environmentalist for stopping human progress to make standard of living rise. Environmentalists on the other hand blame factions within [[right-wing politics]] for this [[skepticism]] and becoming an [[Anti-environmentalism|anti-environmental]] countermovement. Jacques explains that, "The concentration of skeptical claims from the 1990s onwards indicates an intense burst of interest in the environmental skeptical program and is consistent with a conservative countermovement against global environmental concern".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"/&gt;

==Fathers' rights movement==
{{main|Fathers' rights movement}}
Fathers’ Rights Groups have become a growing issue in [[American society]]. In response to the perceived high number of [[violent crime]]s committed against women by their male partners, the battered women’s movement (BWM) has been campaigning for greater awareness of [[domestic violence]] &lt;ref name="countermobilization1"&gt;Crowley, Jocelyn Elise. "Fathers' Rights Groups, Domestic Violence and Political Countermobilization." Social Forces 88.2 (2009): 723-755. Academic Search Complete. EBSCO. Web. 4 Mar. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;. (p. 723) With the widespread understanding that domestic violence is a serious problem in the [[United States]] and elsewhere, the BWM has found public support to create “tougher penalties against offenders and public vigilance against potential batterers, including fathers from dissolving families”&lt;ref name="countermobilization1"/&gt; (p. 723). At least partly in response to this, there has been a counter-movement of activists from the fathers’ rights movement (FRM) who argue that the battered women’s movements have created laws that targets men unfairly. Fathers’ rights groups have grown in numbers since the 1980s in [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Sweden]], [[Australia]], and the United States&lt;ref name="countermobilization1"/&gt; (p. 727). The fathers’ rights movement has argued that the [[legal system]] is making it difficult for them to be 'good fathers.' The FRM employs the argument that being a biological father is different from being a social father because a biological father is simply the individual who makes a genetic contribution, while a social father is one who engages in all of their children’s activities &lt;ref name="countermobilization1"/&gt;(p. 727) The FRMs "have tapped into the emerging cultural notion that in the healthiest families fathers are involved in all aspects of their children's daily lives. &lt;ref name="countermobilization1"/&gt;(p. 727).

==Abortion==
The most controversial of countermovements are about whether [[abortion]] should be legal or not, which is fought by pro-life and pro-choice groups. The pro-life group is opposed to abortion under most grounds, notably those "on request". Some pro-life proponents believe abortion to be justifiable when serious health issues are present for the mother, while other proponents believe that abortion is unjustifiable under any circumstance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Should Abortion Be Legal?|url=http://abortion.procon.org/#Background|accessdate=2014-05-02|date=2014-04-30|quote=Variations exist in arguments on both sides of the debate. Some pro-choice proponents believe abortion should only be used as a last resort, while others advocate unrestricted access to abortion services under any circumstance. Pro-life positions range from opposing abortion under any circumstance to accepting it for situations of rape, incest, or when a woman's life is at risk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pro-choice group believes that a women has a right to abortion under all circumstances, often citing human rights do not encompass fetuses before [[fetal viability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lowen|first=Linda|title=10 Abortion Arguments: 10 Arguments For Abortion, 10 Arguments Against Abortion|url=http://womensissues.about.com/od/reproductiverights/a/AbortionArgumen.htm|accessdate=2014-05-02|quote=Nearly all abortions take place in the first trimester, when a fetus cannot exist independent of the mother. As it is attached by the placenta and umbilical cord, its health is dependent on her health, and cannot be regarded as a separate entity as it cannot exist outside her womb.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these groups tend to be adamant towards their views and neither sides' arguments seem to convince towards otherwise. “Although the issue of abortion is very controversial, most surveys indicate [[liberalization]] of public attitudes towards pregnancy termination between 1965 and the years immediately following [[Roe v. Wade]] Supreme Court decision which legalized abortion. Recent polls demonstrate that between 80% and 90% of Americans approve of abortion in the case of poor health, defective fetus, or [[rape]], and between 40% and 50% indicate approval for other reasons. Only 10% would like to prohibit abortion under all circumstances”.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1986"&gt;Shain, R.N. “A cross-cultural history of abortion.” PubMed.gov. U.S. National Library of Medicine, Mar. 1986. Web. 10 Mar. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also information that people who are usually pro-choice or pro-life come from very different backgrounds and have different values. “Sociodemographic analyses indicate that individuals who disapprove of abortion are usually committed to [[organized religion]], such as [[Roman Catholicism]] or fundamentalist Protestants, are usually very traditional/conservative with regard to women’s role in life, and are less educated than those who are pro-choice”.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1986"/&gt; Both groups will create logical fallacies because both of these countermovements will not agree to each other's issues. Both of these countermovements try to use emotional appeal by “abortion advocates tie their cause to the importance of ‘choice’, while pro-life activist point out the significance of protecting all forms of life”.&lt;ref name="countermobilization1"/&gt;

==Conclusion==
In summary, countermovements have been a part of every movement. Many of the countermovements have tried to stop the opposing movements to get rid of their movement and control the politics of the issue. All countermovements are competing for resources whether it is political influence, money, or enforcing their [[doctrine]] on others. No matter the movement that comes up now or in the future, there is another group who will disapprove and make a countermovement.

'''Delayed open-access journals''' are traditional subscription-based [[scientific journal|journals]] that provide free online access upon the expiry of an [[Embargo (academic publishing)|embargo]] period following the initial publication date.

==Details==
{{refimprove|date=October 2015}}
The embargo period before an article is made available for free can vary from a few months to two or more years. In a 2013 study, 77.8% of delayed open access journals analyzed had an embargo of 12 months or less. 85.4% had an embargo period of 24 months or less.&lt;ref name=laakso&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laakso|first1=Mikael|last2=Björk|first2=Bo-Christer|title=Delayed open access: An overlooked high-impact category of openly available scientific literature|journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology|date=2013|volume=64|issue=7|pages=1323–1329|doi=10.1002/asi.22856|url=http://www.openaccesspublishing.org/delayed/laakso_bj_rk_delay_preprint.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harnad, S. (2013) [http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/1086-.html Defining OA: The Green/Gold and Immediate/Delayed Distinction]. Open Access Archivangelism 1086.&lt;/ref&gt; A journal subscription or an individual article purchase fee would be required to access the materials before this embargo period ends. Some delayed access journals also deposit their publications in [[Institutional repository|open repositories]] when the author is bound by a delayed [[open-access mandate]].

The rationale for the access delay is to provide eventual access to all would-be users while still requiring the [[research library|institutions]] of researchers who need immediate access to keep paying the subscriptions that cover the costs of publication. The marginal costs of distributing an electronic journal to additional users are trivial in comparison to distributing printed copies of the publication. Delayed access publishers spend little or no additional funds while marketing their publications to a broader population than those with personal subscriptions or those affiliated with institutions that have institutional subscriptions or other forms of institutional access.

The assumptions underlying delayed access are that (1) active researchers have sufficient access through institutional subscriptions or licenses, that (2) researchers at institutions that cannot afford subscription access to a journal can use interlibrary loan or direct purchases to access the articles they need, and that (3) students and others affiliated with institutions that cannot afford subscription access to a given journal do not generally need to access articles as urgently as researchers do. It is not clear whether these assumptions are valid.

As a remedy for the fact that in the online era immediate access to research continues to be denied to those who need it most—i.e., researchers—if their institutions cannot afford to pay for it, researchers do have the option of providing open access to their own published research immediately, by [[self-archiving]] it in their [[institutional repository|institutional repositories]]. A growing number of [[ROARMAP|research institutions and research funders]] worldwide are now beginning to adopt [[open-access mandate]]s to ensure that their researchers [[self-archiving|self-archive]].

==Adoption==
{{see also|:Category:Delayed open access journals}}
Many scholarly society journals have adopted the delayed access model. A 2013 study looked at more than 110,000 articles from 492 journals with delayed open access and found the [[impact factor]] of articles in delayed open access journals was twice as high as traditional closed access journals (and, three times as high as gold [[open access journal]]).&lt;ref name=laakso/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harnad, S. (2013) [http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/1084-.html OA's Real Battle-Ground in 2014: The One-Year Embargo]. Open Access Archivangelism 1084.&lt;/ref&gt;

Delayed access does increase access to scholarly research literature for many, but subscribing institutions continue to pay for immediate access during the embargo period. The wide range in embargo lengths – and the fact that [[open access]] is both defined and intended as the state of ''immediate access'' – limits the meaningfulness of classifying journals as "delayed open-access" journals. For example, [[Molecular Biology of the Cell]] has a one-month embargo,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.molbiolcell.org/ Molecular Biology of the Cell&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; whereas [[Journal of the Physical Society of Japan]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journalarchive.jst.go.jp/english/jnltop_en.php?cdjournal=jpsj1946 Publications - Top&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; has a 6-year embargo period. Hence delayed access journals are not included in the lists of [[open-access journal]]s, such as the [[Directory of Open Access Journals]] (DOAJ).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=loadTempl&amp;templ=about DOAJ - Directory of Open Access Journals&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, the [[Journal of Experimental Medicine]] announced that it will now be charging [[Article Processing Charges]] for delayed open access. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/JExpMed/status/824260282272940033|title=JExpMed on Twitter|newspaper=Twitter|language=en|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rupress.org/content/publication-fees-and-choices|title=Publication Fees and Choices {{!}} The Rockefeller University Press|website=rupress.org|language=en|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''demographics of Kazakhstan''' enumerate the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of [[Kazakhstan]], including population growth, [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health, economic status, religious affiliations, and other aspects of the population. Some use the word '''Kazakh''' to refer to the [[Kazakhs|Kazakh ethnic group]] and [[Kazakh language|language]] (autochthonous to Kazakhstan as well as parts of Russia, China and Mongolia) and '''Kazakhstani''' to refer to Kazakhstan and its citizens regardless of ethnicity,&lt;ref&gt;Schreiber, Dagmar and Tredinnick, Jeremy. ''Kazakhstan''. Odyssey Publications, 2010, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USStateDept&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5487.htm|title=Kazakhstan|work=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is common to use '''Kazakh''' in both senses.&lt;ref name=FCO&gt;[http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/country-profile/asia-oceania/kazakhstan?profile=all UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office, ''Kazakhstan'', 2 Feb 2011] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006090921/http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/country-profile/asia-oceania/kazakhstan/?profile=all |date=6 October 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kazakhembus.com/|title=News &amp; featured articles|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erlanidrissov.com/ Ambassador Erlan A Idissov, Embassy of the Republic of Kazakhstan to the USA.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographic trends==
Official estimates put the population of Kazakhstan at 18,137,300 as of December 2017, of which 44% is rural and 56% urban population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stat.gov.kz/faces/homePage?_adf.ctrl-state=15rz9ppdwz_50&amp;_afrLoop=15353848961947330 |title= 2017 жылдың басынан 2018 жылдың 1 қаңтарына дейінгі Қазақстан Республикасы халық санының өзгеруі туралы }}, Statistical Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2009 population estimate is 6.8% higher than the population reported in the last census from January 1999 (slightly less than 15 million). These estimates have been confirmed by the 2009 population census, and this means that the decline in population that began after 1989 has been arrested and reversed.

The proportion of men makes up 48.3%, the proportion of women 51.7%. The proportion of Kazakhs makes up 63.6%, Russians 23.7%, Uzbeks 2.9%, Ukrainians 2.1%, Uygur 1.4%, Tatars 1.3%, Germans 1.1%, others 3.9%. Note that a large percentage of the population are of mixed ethnicity.

The first census in Kazakhstan was conducted under [[Russian Empire|Russian Imperial]] rule in 1897, which estimated population at round 4 million people. Following censuses showed a growth until 1939, where numbers showed a decrease to 6,081 thousand relative to the previous census done 13 years earlier, due to famines of 1922 and 1933.
{{Main|Kazakh famine of 1919–1922|Kazakh famine of 1932–33}}
But since 1939 population has steadily increased to 16.5 million in the 1989, according to corresponding year census. Official estimates indicate that the population continued to increase after 1989, peaking out at 17 million in 1993 and then declining to 15 million in the 1999 census. The downward trend continued through 2002, when the estimated population bottomed out at 14.9 million, and then resumed its growth.&lt;ref name=demoscope&gt;[http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2003/0103/analit03.php Population dynamics and ethnic composition of Kazakhstan in the second half of the 20th century], ''Demoscope Weekly'', No. 103-104, 3–16 March 2003 {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Significant numbers of Russians returned to Russia.  Kazakhstan underwent significant urbanization during the first 50 years of the Soviet era, as the share of rural population declined from more than 90% in the 1920s to less than 50% since the 1970s.&lt;ref name=yb/&gt;

:''Data sources'': Population 1897 from [[Russian Empire Census]]. Population 1926 from [[First All-Union Census of the Soviet Union]]. Population 1939-1999 from demoscope.ru,&lt;ref name=demoscope/&gt; 2002-2008 from Kazakhstan Statistical Agency web site.&lt;ref name=agency&gt;[http://www.stat.kz/digital/naselsenie/Pages/default.aspx Population and social policy], Statistical Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rural/urban shares 1939-1993 from statistical yearbooks, print editions,&lt;ref name=yb&gt;''Statistical Yearbook of Kazakhstan'', Almaty, various years since 1980 {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2002-2008 from Kazakhstan Statistical Agency web site.&lt;ref name=agency/&gt; 2009-2014 from Kazakhstan Statistical Agency web site.&lt;ref name="statgovkz"&gt;[http://www.stat.gov.kz] Statistical Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2003, there were discrepancies between Western sources regarding the population of Kazakhstan. [[United States]] government sources, including the [[CIA World Fact Book]] and the [[US Census Bureau International Data Base]], listed the population as 15,340,533,&lt;ref name=cia&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/kz.html CIA Factbook (Kazakhstan)] Retrieved on May 2, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[World Bank]] gave a 2002 estimate of 14,858,948.&lt;ref name="World Databank"&gt;{{cite web|title=World DataBank&gt;World Development Indicators|url=http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=2&amp;country=KAZ|website=databank.worldbank.org|accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discrepancy was presumably due to difficulties in measurement caused by the large migratory population in [[Kazakhstan]], emigration, and low population density - only about 5.5 persons per km² in an area the size of [[Western Europe]].

===Total fertility rate===

Total fertility rate by regions of Kazakhstan: Mangystau - 3.80, South Kazakhstan - 3.71, Kyzylorda - 3.42, Atyrau - 3.29, Jambyl - 3.20, Aqtobe - 2.70, Almaty (province) - 2.65, Almaty (city) - 2.65, City of Astana - 2.44, West Kazakhstan - 2.29, Aqmola - 2.19, East Kazakhstan - 2.07, Qaragandy - 2.04, Pavlodar - 1.98, North Kazakhstan - 1.72, Qostanay - 1.70, Republic of Kazakhstan - 2.65. Thus it can be seen that fertility rate is higher in more traditionalist and religious south and west, and lower in the north and east, where the percentage of Slavic and German population is still relatively high.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stat.kz/digital/naselsenie/Pages/default.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spo"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Spoorenberg |first1=Thomas |year=2013 |title=Fertility changes in Central Asia since 1980|journal=Asian Population Studies |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=50–77 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17441730.2012.752238#.VW9dTc_BzRY |doi=10.1080/17441730.2012.752238 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spoo"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Spoorenberg |first1=Thomas |year=2015 |title=Explaining recent fertility increase in Central Asia |journal=Asian Population Studies |publisher=Routledge |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17441730.2015.1027275 |doi=10.1080/17441730.2015.1027275 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Kazakhstan Demographic and Health Survey in 1999, the [[Total fertility rate|TFR]] for Kazakhs was 2.5 and that for Russians was 1.38. TFR in 1989 for Kazakhs &amp; Russians were 3.58 and 2.24 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.measuredhs.com/pubs/pdf/FR111/04Chapter4.pdf|title=Kazakhstan: Demographic and Health Survey, 1999 - Final Report, Chapter 4: Fertility|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History of ethnic composition ===
Kazakhstan's dominant ethnic group [[Kazakhs]], traces its origin to 15th century, when a number of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and some [[mongols|Mongol]] tribes united to establish the [[Kazakh Khanate]]. With cohesive culture and national identity, they constituted absolute majority on the land until Russian colonization.&lt;br&gt;
Russian advancement into the territory of Kazakhstan began in the late 18th century, when the Kazakhs nominally accepted Russian rule in exchange for protection against repeated attacks by the western Mongolian Kalmyks. In the 1890s, Russian peasants began to settle the fertile lands of northern Kazakhstan, causing many Kazakhs to move eastwards into Chinese territory in search of new grazing grounds. The 1906 completion of the Trans-Aral Railway between Orenburg and Tashkent further facilitated Russian colonization.&lt;ref name="Olcott, M. B. 1995"&gt;Olcott, M. B. (1995). The Kazakhs. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, A. R. (1960) Russian Central Asia, 1867-1917: A study in colonial rule. Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The first collectivized farms opened in Kazakhstan in 1921, populated primarily by Russians and Soviet deportees. In 1930, as part of the first Five Year Plan, the Kazakh Central Committee decreed the sedentarization of nomads and their incorporation into collectivized farms. This movement resulted in devastating famine, claiming the lives of an estimated 40% of ethnic Kazakhs (1.5 million), between 1930-33.&lt;ref&gt;Pianciola, N. (2001). The collectivization famine in Kazakhstan, 1931–1933. Harvard Ukrainian Studies, 25(3/4), 237–251. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/41036834&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of thousands also fled to China, Iran and Afghanistan. The famine rendered Kazakhs a minority within Kazakhstan, and only after the republic gained independence in 1991 did Kazakhs recover a slim demographic majority within Kazakhstan.&lt;ref name="Olcott, M. B. 1995"/&gt;

Demographics would continue to shift in the 1950-1960s, wherein as part of Nikita Khrushchev's [[Virgin Lands Campaign]], hundreds of thousands of Soviet deportees were relocated to the Kazakh steppes in order to farm. As recognized in the 1959 census, the Kazaks became a minority for the first time in history, comprising just  30% of the total population of Kazakhstan. Russians numbered 42.7%.&lt;ref&gt;Zardykhan, Z. (2004). Russians in Kazakhstan and demographic change: Imperial legacy and the Kazakh way of nation building.

According to the 2009 census, the ethnic composition of Kazakhstan is approximately: 63.1% Kazakh, 23.7% Russian, 2.9% Uzbek, 2.1% Ukrainian, 1.4% Uyghur, 1.3% Tatar, 1.1% German, 1% Kyrgyz, and &lt;1% Korean, Turkish, Azerbaijani, Belarusian, Dungan, Kurdish, Tajik, Polish, Chechen.&lt;ref&gt;Central Intelligence Agency.

The '''Enggano language''', or '''Engganese''', is a language of debated linguistic affiliation spoken on [[Enggano Island]] off the southwestern coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. It has variously been classified as either an [[Austronesian language|Austronesian]] language or a [[language isolate]]. [[Roger Blench]] (2014) considers Enggano to be a language isolate with Austronesian loanwords, while Owen Edwards (2015) classifies Enggano as an Austronesian language with a non-Austronesian [[substratum]]. Either way, the general scholarly consensus is that Enggano is an aberrant language that has both Austronesian and non-Austronesian origins.

When first contacted by Europeans, the [[Enggano people]] had more cultural commonalities with indigenous peoples of the [[Nicobar Islands]] than those of with Austronesian Sumatra. For instance, beehive houses were typical of both Enggano Island and the Nicobar Islands. However, there are no apparent linguistic connections with [[Nicobarese language|Nicobarese]] or other [[Austroasiatic languages]].

==Classification==
The classification of Enggano is controversial,&lt;ref name="Edwards2015"&gt;Edwards, Owen (2015). "The Position of Enggano within Austronesian." ''Oceanic Linguistics'' 54 (1): 54-109.&lt;/ref&gt; ranging from proposals that negate its inclusion in the Austronesian family all the way to classifications that place Enggano in the [[Northwest Sumatran languages|Northwest Sumatran]] subgroup together with other [[Austronesian languages]] of the area (e.g. [[Nias language|Nias]]). 

Based on the low number of apparent Austronesian cognates, Capell (1982) concludes that Enggano is a [[language isolate]] rather than Austronesian as previously assumed.&lt;ref&gt;Capell, Arthur, 1982. 'Local Languages in the PAN Area'. In Reiner Carle et al. ed., ''Gava‘: Studies in Austronesian languages and cultures dedicated to Hans Kähler'', trans. Geoffrey Sutton, 1-15, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Blench (2009) picks up the question, though he leaves Enggano unclassified. Blench (2014)&lt;ref&gt;Blench, Roger. 2014. The Enggano: archaic foragers and their interactions with the Austronesian world. m.s.&lt;/ref&gt; also considers Enggano to be a [[language isolate]] that has picked up Austronesian loanwords, and notes many basic vocabulary items in Enggano are of non-Austronesian origin. Based on lexical evidence from the Enggano language, Blench (2014) considers the Enggano people to be descendants of [[Pleistocene]] (pre-Neolithic) [[hunter-gatherer]]s that had preceded the [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesians]].

Subsequent material collected by Yoder (2011), however, suggests the language is Austronesian after all, albeit lexically divergent. ''Bak'' 'eye', for example, corresponds regularly with Malay ''mata'', but 'die' (Yoder ''ba’a'', Kähler ''ka’a'', presumably a prefix ''ba-'' or ''ka-'' with a root ''’a'') has no apparent connection to Austronesian ''mati ~ matay''; indeed, of the most stable verb and noun roots,&lt;ref&gt;Holman, Wichmann, Brown, Velupillai, Müller, Bakker. 2008. ''Explorations in automated language classification.''&lt;/ref&gt; only a third have reasonable Austronesian cognates.

Edwards (2015)&lt;ref name="Edwards2015"/&gt; also classifies Enggano as an Austronesian language that is a primary branch of [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]], and notes that it clearly does not fit into the Barrier Islands-Batak subgroup of Malayo-Polynesian. Although Edwards (2015) considers Enggano to be clearly Austronesian, he considers it to be an Austronesian language that has a non-Austronesian [[substratum]] rather than a non-Austronesian language with Austronesian loanwords. Edwards (2015) notes that Enggano possesses many aberrant phonological features (such as a small phonological inventory) and a low lexical retention rate, which is more typical of Austronesian languages spoken in eastern Indonesia and Melanesia than rather than those of western Indonesia. Enggano's lexical retention rate (i.e., percentage of lexical items that are cognate with reconstructed [[Proto-Austronesian language|Proto-Austronesian]] forms) is only 21% (46 out of 217 words), while the lexical retention rate for [[Malay language|Malay]] is 59% (132.5 out of 223 words).&lt;ref name="Edwards2015"/&gt; Some non-Austronesian languages in Southeast Asia, such as [[Nancowry language|Nancowry]], [[Semelai language|Semelai]], and [[Abui language|Abui]] also have low lexical retention rates.&lt;ref name="Edwards2015"/&gt;

==Evolution==
Enggano has historically undergone [[nasal harmony]] in its identifiable Austronesian vocabulary, where all [[stop consonant|stop consonants]] and vowels in a word became nasal after a nasal vowel, and oral after an oral vowel, so that there is no longer a phonemic distinction between them. For example, *eũ’ada’a became ''eũ’ãnã’ã'', while nasal consonants are no longer found in ''’ub'' 'house' or ''’a-rib'' 'five' (cf. Malay ''rumah, lima''). Enggano is the only western Austronesian language in which *t shifted to {{IPA|/k/}}, an unusual change that occurred independently several times in [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic]] after *k shifted to [[glottal stop]].&lt;ref&gt;Blust, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phonology ==
The only major linguistic treatment of Enggano was conducted by Hans Kähler in 1937; he published a grammar (1940), texts, and a dictionary (1987). However, phonology is limited to a simple inventory and a short paragraph of basic features; the grammar and dictionary disagree with each other, the dictionary is not consistent, some words are not legible, and doubts have been raised about the accuracy of the transcriptions. Nothofer (1992) discusses loanwords and also lists phonemes.&lt;ref name="Nothofer"&gt;Nothofer, 1986, p. 97, after Kähler (1940).&lt;/ref&gt; Yoder (2011) is a thesis on Enggano vowels, with some comments on consonants; it will be followed here.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.und.edu/dept/linguistics/theses/2011Yoder.PDF Yoder, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stress was once reported to be penultimate but appears to occur on the final syllable. Alternating syllables preceding it have secondary stress.

Yoder and Nothofer report seven oral and seven nasal vowels:&lt;ref&gt;Kähler's dictionary is similar, but lacks {{IPA|/ɨ ɨ̃/}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

|  
|}
Diphthongs are {{IPA|/ai, aɨ, au, ei, ɘi, oi/}}.

Vowels do not occur word-initially in Enggano apart from what Yoder analyzes as {{IPA|/i u/}} before another vowel; these are then pronounced as semivowels {{IPA|[j w]}}. (Nothofer counts these as consonants {{IPA|/j, w/}} restricted to initial position, which avoids the problem of not uncommon {{IPA|[ji]}} being analyzed as {{IPA|/ii/}}, when sequences of the same vowel are  otherwise quite rare.) The vowels {{IPA|/i ɨ u e o/}} are all pronounced as semivowels in vowel sequences after medial glottal consonants {{IPA|/ʔ h/}}, as in {{IPA|/kõʔĩã/ [kõʔjã]}} (a sp. tree) and {{IPA|/bohoe/ [boho̯e]}} 'wild'; otherwise, apart from diphthongs, vowel sequences are disyllabic, as in {{IPA|/ʔa-piah/ [ʔapi.ah]}} 'to graze'. {{IPA|/i/}} optionally triggers a glide after a following glottal consonant, as in {{IPA|/ki-ʔu/ [kiʔu ~ kiʔju]}} 'to say'. Diphthongs lower to {{IPA|[aɪ, aʊ]}} etc. before a coda stop, as in {{IPA|/kipaʔãũp/ [kĩpãʔãʊ̃p]}} 'ten', and undergo metathesis when that stop is glottal, as in {{IPA|/kahaiʔ kak/ [kahaʔɪkak]}} 'twenty'. An [[intrusive vowel]] {{IPA|[ə̆]}} appears between glottal stop and another consonant (though not semivowels), as in {{IPA|/kaʔhɨɘ/ [kaʔ.ə̆.hɨ.ɘ]}} 'female leader'; this does not affect the pattern of stress.

In many words, a final vowel transcribed by Kähler is not found in Yoder.

The offglide of diphthongs lowers before glottal consonants, and a glottal stop may intrude when another word follows, as in {{IPA|/kahaiʔ mɘh/}} {{IPA|[kahaʔɪmɘ̃h]}} 'another'.

Yoder notes that the voiced stops {{IPA|[b~m, d~n]}} are in [[complementary distribution]], depending on whether the word has nasal vowels, but lists them separately. Voiced oral consonants, {{IPA|[b d l r]}}, do not occur in words with nasal consonants or vowels. Nasal consonants nasalize all vowels in a word, and there is therefore no contrast between {{IPA|[m n]}} and {{IPA|[b d]}} apart from the contrast between nasal and oral vowels. For example, with the oral stem ''tax'' 'bag', the possessive forms are ''tahi’'' 'my bag' and ''tahib'' 'your bag', but with the nasal stem 'age', the forms are ''’umunu’'' 'my age' and ''’umunum'' 'your age'.

{{IPA|/l/}} occurs in only a few native words. {{IPA|/s ~ x/}} are infrequent and apparently a single phoneme; they only occur word finally, where they contrast with {{IPA|/h/}}: {{IPA|[x]}} occurs after the non-front vowels {{IPA|/ɨ ə u/}}, {{IPA|[ç]}} after the front vowels {{IPA|/i a ã/}}, and {{IPA|[s]}} after vowel sequences ending in {{IPA|/i/}} (including {{IPA|/ii, ui/}}). The resulting {{IPA|[aç ãç]}} may actually be {{IPA|/aix ãĩx/}}, as most such words are attested with alternation like {{IPA|[kaç ~ kais]}} 'box'. When a suffix is added, so that this consonant is no longer word-final, it becomes {{IPA|/h/}}, as in ''tahi’'' 'my bag' above.

Nothofer is similar, but does not list the uncommon consonants {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/s ~ x/}} and counts {{IPA|[j w]}} as consonants rather than allophones of vowels. Kähler's dictionary adds {{IPA|/ɲ/}}, as well as {{IPA|/f tʃ dʒ/}} as marginal phonemes, and claims that {{IPA|/t r/}} are only found in southern villages. However, Yoder states that at the time of his research in 2010 there were no differences among the six villages on Enggano Island, and that initial {{IPA|/t r/}} and final {{IPA|/t d/}} are rare in native words. Medial {{IPA|/d/}} and {{IPA|/r/}} are in free variation in a few words, with older people preferring {{IPA|/d/}} and younger speakers {{IPA|/r/}}.

==Grammar==
Independent and possessive pronouns in Yoder (2010) are,

{|class=wikitable
|+Enggano pronouns
|-
! Pronoun !! Independent !! Suffix
|-
| 1sg ||’u || -’
|-
| we.{{sc|EXCL}} ||’a ||
|-
| we.{{sc|INCL}} ||’ik || -k
|-
| 2sg ||’ə’ || -b ~ -m
|-
| 2pl ||’ari || -du ~ -nu
|-
| 3sg ||ki || rowspan=2| -d(e) ~ -n(e)
|-
| 3pl ||hamə’ 
|-
| this ||(pẽ)’ẽ’
|-
| that ||’ẽõ’
|-
| who ||hã
|-
| what ||’i.ah
|}
Most of these appear to be Austronesian: Compare Malay 1sg ''aku ~ ku'', 1.{{sc|ex}} ''kami'', 1.{{sc|in}} ''kita'', 2pl ''kalian'', 3sg/pl ''dia'', and suffixes 1sg ''-ku'', 2sg ''-mu'', 3sg ''-nya'', with *k, *t (d), *l, *m, *n having shifted to ''’, k, r, b, d'' in Enggano, and with final consonants and (where possible) vowels being lost.

The possessive suffixes appear on nouns, and they are often preceded by a vowel. Few forms are attested, but this vowel is ''i'' or ''ai'' after {{IPA|[ç]}} (as with 'bag' in the phonology section), an [[echo vowel]] after several other consonants, and with several words not predictable on current evidence: ''’eam – ’ami’'' '(my) fishing rod' (Blench notes that ''’e-'' appears on many nouns in Kähler and may be a prefix, perhaps a [[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]]; cf. ''’ẽ’'' 'this'), ''dar – daru’'' '(my) husband', ''pi – pia’'' '(my) garden'. In a couple cases, an intact pronoun ''-’u'' or ''-ki'' is appended.

Adjectives commonly have prefixes ''ka-, ka’-, ki-''; the first two are attested in derivation, and the last is assumed as it is very common and many such adjectives otherwise appear to be reduplicated, as in ''kinanap'' 'smooth' (Yoder 2010).

Verbs may have one or two prefixes and sometimes a suffix. Attested prefixes are ''ba-, ba’-, ia-, iah-, ka-, ka’-, kah-, ki-, kir-, ko-, pa-, pah-, ’a-.'' The functions of these are unknown. ''Ki-'' and ''pa-'' may occur together, as in ''pe, pape, kipe, kipape'', all glossed as 'give'.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''ba-, ka-, ki-, kipa-, pa-, ’a-'' with Malay ''mə-, tər-, di-, dipər-, pər-, kə-''&lt;/ref&gt; The three attested verbal suffixes are ''-i, -ar, -a’'' (Yoder 2010).

The counting system is, or at least once was, [[vigesimal]]: Kähler recorded ''kahai'i ekaka'' 'one man' = 20, ''ariba ekaka'' 'five man' = 100, ''kahai'i edudodoka'' 'one our-body' = 400. (The last may be based on two people counting together: each time I count all twenty of my digits, you count one of yours, so that when you have counted all of your digits, the number is 20×20 = 400.) However, most people now use Malay numerals when speaking Enggano, especially for higher numbers. Yoder (2010) recorded the following:&lt;ref&gt;Also found [http://lingweb.eva.mpg.de/numeral/Enggano.htm|accessdate=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

{|class=wikitable
|-

|-
| 1|| kahai’ 
|-
| 2|| ’aru 
|-
| 3|| ’akər
|-

|-
| 10|| kĩpã’ãũp
|-
| 20|| kahai’ kak
|}
1–5 are Austronesian, assuming ''ka-'' is a prefix on 'one' and ''’a-'' is a prefix on 2–5. Compare the remaining ''-hai’, -ru, -kər, -up, -rib'' with [[Lampung language|Lampung]] ''əsay, rua, təlu, əpat, lima''; *s, *t, *l, *m have shifted to ''h, k, r, b'' in Enggano, and final consonants and (simple) vowels have been lost. 
''’aki’akin'' 6 may be reduplication of ''’akər'' 3. ''’arib he ’aru'' 7 is 'five and two'. The two forms for 8 mean 'hugging', from the verb ''pã’ĩõp'' 'to hug', and 9 appears to be 'eight, one coming'; it may be shortened to ''kaba kahai’'' (no ''-i'') in enumeration. Yoder believes 10 may also be a verb, based on an unelicited root ''’ãũp'', as ''ki-'' and ''pa-'' are verbal prefixes (as in ''ki-pa-pe'' 'to give'); indeed, the apparent prefixes on 1–5 are identical to verbal prefixes as well.

Numbers above 10 and 20 are formed with ''he ~ hi'' 'and': ''kĩpã’ãũp he ’aru'' 'ten and two' for 12, ''kahai’ kak he kĩpã’ãũp'' 'twenty and ten' for 30. ''kak'' is 'person', so twenty is 'one person'. Multiples of twenty are formed from ''kak'', as in ''’akər kak he kĩpã’ãũp'' 70, ''’arib kak'' 100 (also ''kahai’ ratuh'' from Malay ''ratus'').

== Early years and personal life ==
Darya was born in [[Kabul]], Afghanistan to ethnic [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] parents, he is the grandson of [[Sher Khan Nashir]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pashtun.me/articles/read-farhad-darya-فرهاد-دریا_49.html Farhad Darya فرهاد دریا] Retrieved 1 December 2017.{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110111359/http://www.pashtun.me/articles/read-farhad-darya-%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%AF%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%A7_49.html |date=10 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied Persian literature while attending [[Kabul University]]. During this time, he wrote music for other artists under the [[pseudonym]] Abr (Cloud), and started playing [[Klasik|Afghan]] and [[Indian classical music]]. He later left the university and enrolled in the [[Afghan Armed Forces]].

In 1990 he immigrated to [[Germany]] and began singing again. After traveling through [[Prague]] and [[Hamburg]], Darya arrived in [[Paris]], where he would meet Sultana Emam. The two were married in 1993 and moved to [[Northern Virginia]] in the [[United States]] in 1995. A year later they gave birth to a son, Hejran Darya.

Since Darya's television debut on [[Television in Afghanistan|Afghanistan's television network]] in 1980, he has released over two dozen albums. He founded a band, ''Goroh-e-Baran'' (meaning "Rain Band") with [[Asad Badie]], which became one of the best known Afghan bands in the 1980s. Throughout his career Darya has sold over 2 million copies of albums - the acclaimed ones produced in [[exile]], many of which deal with the [[Soviet-Afghan War]] and the resulting misfortunes of the war-torn nation. Most of the music is aimed at helping Afghans bringing peace and unity to their country,&lt;ref name=rferl/&gt; and deals with themes of national unity.

He released his ''Salaam Afghanistan'' album in 2003, with a DVD release of music videos in March 2004.

In September 2006, Darya's new single ''Salamalek'' in a collaboration with German musician [[Peter Maffay]] was released, as part of Maffay's album ''Begegnungen - Eine Allianz für Kinder''. It was Darya's first [[rock music|rock]] song.

In August 2007, Darya completed his new album ''HA!'' and was released in Afghanistan, followed by Germany in March 2008. The video of his song Dohle Bezan (Nazdeek Shodan) (''Talk To Me''/''Closer'') from the album HA! premiered on Afghan's national television in February 2008.{{cn|date=May 2008}} Later that year, Darya's new album ''Yahoo'' was released.

He has not worked on a new album since, but has released plenty of singles, including ''Attan'', ''Dew Hai Mast'', ''Nashkenad'' and ''Oo Ghaita''.

'''Home Alive''' is a [[Seattle]]-based anti-violence organization that offers [[self-defense]] classes on a sliding scale payment system.  Home Alive once operated as a [[non-profit organization]] and now continues to operate as a volunteer collective.  Home Alive sees its work as integrated into larger [[social justice]] movements, recognizing how violence is often perpetuated through oppression and abuse.  Home Alive classes included basic physical self-defense, boundary setting, and advanced multi-week courses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state51.co.uk/hottips/496/homealive.html Mia Zapata: Home Alive&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427220827/http://www.state51.co.uk/hottips/496/homealive.html |date=2006-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Following the rape and murder of local singer [[Mia Zapata]] in 1993, a number of artists and musicians within Seattle began to meet and discuss the problems of violence within the community, and the lack of available resources such as self-defense classes, which were considered impractical and somewhat unaffordable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homealive.org/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=27&amp;Itemid=35 Home Alive&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010065653/http://www.homealive.org/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=27&amp;Itemid=35 |date=2006-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rose|first=Cynthia|title=The Art Of Self-Defense -- Driven By The Killing Of Singer Mia Zapata, Home Alive Fights Back With A Star-Studded CD|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19960301&amp;slug=2316673|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=March 1, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The birth of this organization was informal, with meetings originating as heated discussions in the living rooms of concerned women from the scene. However the group had trouble deciding how to organize and agreeing on the best methods of self-defense training to teach, so they chose to bring in teachers to help direct the course of their learning.&lt;ref name="Onstot"&gt;{{cite news|last=Onstot|first=Laura|title=Why Home Alive Is Facing Its Demise ... Again|url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/2009-02-18/news/why-home-alive-is-facing-its-demise-again/|newspaper=Seattle Weekly|date=February 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This group of women, now recognized as the founders of the organization, pooled resources such as arts and music benefits in order to raise funds and study self-defense. Classes were provided to the community originally for free, but then later on a [[sliding scale fees|sliding scale]] basis. This change occurred because the founders were advised not to offer the classes for free because attendees would not value the class if they did not pay for it.&lt;ref name="Carter-Munoz"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carter-Munoz|first1=Kim|title=Gretta Harley, Interview|url=http://digitalcollections.lib.washington.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/wwr/id/383/rec/1|publisher=Digital Collections|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no one was turned away due to lack of funds. The group continues this work, providing classes to individuals, as before; but expanding to also educate establishments such as schools and businesses.  With primary support still coming from the arts community, Home Alive continues to ground its self-defense education in a movement for social justice.

Violence occurs in [[child sexual abuse|childhood sexual abuse]], [[date rape]], [[intimate partner violence]], and [[sexual harassment]]. The founders tried out other self-defense classes but they found them lacking due to prices, and they offered restrictive rules for women. These rules included how women should dress conservatively and to never walk alone, thus this was another decision to create Home Alive.

Home Alive offers tools, not rules, to everyone seeking more safety and connection in their lives.  They promote consensual behavior, and believe that we all have a responsibility to respect each other's boundaries and right to self-determination. Home Alive taught not only physical self-defense but as well verbal boundaries like saying "no" when feeling uncomfortable, escape route techniques and much others including going to a therapist, writing in a journal, talking to friends and exercising. For the organization self-defense meant to do anything to make oneself feel strong and able to take care of oneself in order to feel safer.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;[http://www.teachhomealive.org/about/ "About."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723062306/http://www.teachhomealive.org/about/ |date=2014-07-23 }} Home Alive.&lt;/ref&gt;

Home Alive moved to the [[Capitol Hill (Seattle)|Capitol Hill]] district in 2004.&lt;ref name="Onstot" /&gt;

On June 14, 2010 members of Home Alive's Board of Directors, together with the instructor collective, decided to close as a [[501(c)(3) organization]] and to lay the Home Alive program dormant after 17 years in the community. They announced their decision to close in an email sent out to the Home Alive and Capitol Hill community, choosing to celebrate their years of work with an all ages party at Hidmo [[Eritrean cuisine]] featuring live music and an [[open mic]]. Home Alive included suggestions for other self-defense organizations in the wake of their closure such as [[INCITE! Women of Color Against Violence]] and Northwest Network as well as others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Home Alive shutting down; it had started in wake of singer Mia Zapata's murder|url=http://seattlepostglobe.org/2010/05/30/home-alive-started-in-wake-of-mia-to-shut-down-with-june-12-celebration/|newspaper=Seattle Post Globe|date=May 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deactivation occurred because of how difficult it was to maintain non-profit structure for the organization, as well as finding space and dependable funding. Members also found it difficult to maintain consistent leadership for the group, causing it to fall into disorganization.&lt;ref name="Onstot" /&gt; Home Alive consequently decided to move away from the formalized government structure of a non-profit and instead chose to create a website teaching self-defense. The website includes all of the curriculum and became volunteer-based.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

Since 2010 they have strayed away from the non-profit aspect of the organization and instead formed a small, loosely functioning volunteer collective. They also teach a handful of classes at high schools and for other progressive organizations. They have their curriculum available online for all to use.

On July 3, 2012 four Home Alive instructors, with the assistance of a few dedicated community members, launched a new website, Teach Home Alive, a site dedicated to archiving and sharing Home Alive's curriculum.

==Other resources==

There are other resources that are available to victims as well as people looking to prevent violence against women or other groups. One of these is ''Her Wits About Her'': a powerful anthology that relates dozens of true self-defense success stories by women, dispelling the pervasive myth that it's better not to fight back.  This book demonstrates how often a combination of strategies (yelling, negotiating, striking, positive self talk) can be incredibly effective in dangerous situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Grove|editor1-first=Gail|editor2-last=Caignon|editor2-first=Denise|title=Her Wits About Her: Self-Defense Success Stories By Women|date=1987|publisher=Harpercollins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Home Alive co-founder Cristien Storm's first book ''Living in Liberation: Boundary Setting, Self-Care and Social Change'' is a great visionary resource.  Cristien argues that responses to violence can and should embody boundary setting, self care, and self-defense skills that interrupt victim-blaming, fear-based approaches and locate healing within the social context of community.  This groundbreaking text roots boundary setting and self care in larger visions of happier and healthier communities, all the while holding on to the complexities of individual safety and social justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Other Resources|url=http://www.teachhomealive.org/resources/|website=Home Alive|accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefit shows==

Many live music venues in Seattle, San Francisco, and New York organized shows to benefit Home Alive, where there would be music and [[spoken word]] performances.&lt;ref name="MTV News"&gt;{{cite web|title=Home Alive Hits The Road; But Where Are The Stars?|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/506905/home-alive-hits-the-road-but-where-are-the-stars/|publisher=MTV News|date=January 26, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; These performances were put on by a variety of people including bands, such as [[The Posies]], and founders of Home Alive, such as Christien Storm, who performed spoken word, [[Valerie Agnew]], who performed with her band [[7 Year Bitch]], and Gretta Harley, who performed with her band Maxi Bad.&lt;ref name="Carter-Munoz"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Mtv News Staff|title=Home Alive Hits The Road; But Where Are The Stars?|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/506905/home-alive-hits-the-road-but-where-are-the-stars/|publisher=Mtv News|date=January 26, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first show took place at Seattle venue, RKCNDY (also known as Rock Candy).&lt;ref name="Carter-Munoz"/&gt; During these shows organizers and volunteers would talk about Home Alive and there would be tables with information about Home Alive, as well.&lt;ref name="Carter-Munoz"/&gt; In addition to being fundraisers for Home Alive, these benefit shows were also used as a "[way] to bring the music and arts communities together around tragedy, violence, and oppression" to "find ways to proactively address these issues."&lt;ref name="Flying Side Kick"&gt;{{cite web|title=Flying Side Kick|url=http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/homealive|publisher=CD Baby}}&lt;/ref&gt; While funds from the shows went towards providing self-defense classes, it did not always go directly to Home Alive. In the case of shows put on in February and March 1996, the money was put into a bank account with the intent of inspiring other organizations to provide self-defense classes, which would be supported using funds from the bank account.&lt;ref name="MTV News"/&gt; If no one used the money within one year, it would be "donated to women's shelters in the communities where the shows [took] place."&lt;ref name="MTV News"/&gt;

In more current events, partial proceeds from [[Capitol Hill Block Party]] in 2008 were also donated to Home Alive as well as in 2006 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Seling, Megan. [http://lineout.thestranger.com/2008/04/2008_capitol_hill_block_party_lineup_vam "2008 Capitol Hill Block Party Line-Up: Vampire Weekend, Les Savy Fav, the Hold Steady, Girl Talk, Chromeo, and More!"], ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]'', Seattle, 15 April 2008. Retrieved on 3 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the University of Washington put on a performance of the ''[[Vagina Monologues]]'', and the proceeds from the show went the organization.&lt;ref name="Onstot"/&gt;

==CD and contributions==
[[File:Joan Jett by David Shankbone.jpg|right|thumb|[[Joan Jett]], contributor to Home Alive]]

Home Alive took hold by spreading the word to the community by making posters, [[zine]]s, and newsletters. They organized benefit concerts, taught classes, and wrote the curriculum for the organization. As well they compiled a CD called ''Home Alive: the Art of Self Defense'' which included 44 tracks from various artists. The CD label was produced by Sony. Co-founder  Gretta Harley was instrumental in helping produce the album.  The CD included songs of empowerment, self-awareness, experiences with violence. Some tracks here were meant as goodbye songs, some are poems, and others merely rants. But there's no CD or "tribute" like it. Violent, intense and passionate, it pulls off the trick of pulling life from death. The artists included many Seattle local bands who wanted to contribute like [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Pearl Jam]], and [[Soundgarden]]. The CD compilation gained recognition worldwide.&lt;ref name="Allmusic Review"&gt;{{cite news|last=Parisien|first=Roch|title=Home Alive: The Art of Self Defense review|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/home-alive-the-art-of-self-defense-mw0000182712|newspaper=AllMusic|date=February 20, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kathleen Hanna]], lead singer of the Seattle punk band [[Bikini Kill]] and kick-starter of the [[Riot grrrl]] feminist movement, also appears on the album.&lt;ref name="Allmusic Review" /&gt; The track [[Leaving Here]] on the album, covered by [[Pearl Jam]], peaked as 24th in Mainstream Rock and 31st in Modern Rock Tracks on Billboard Singles in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home Alive: The Art of Self Defense {{!}} Awards|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/home-alive-the-art-of-self-defense-mw0000182712/awards|website=AllMusic|accessdate=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Home Alive released a second compilation album titled ''Flying Side Kick''. The album features 17 tracks from various artists including [[The Gossip]], Amy Ray and the Butchies, The Need, the Pinkos, Sanford Arms and more. Proceeds from album sales went to Home Alive.&lt;ref name="Flying Side Kick"/&gt;

Home Alive has received support from [[Joan Jett]] through a collaboration with Mia Zapata's former bandmates, [[The Gits]]. They performed, with Joan Jett as lead singer, under the name [[Evil Stig]] with proceeds benefitting Home Alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Phalen|first=Tom|title=Zapata's Death Inspires Jett to Lend Her Voice to the Gits|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19950324&amp;slug=2111805|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=March 24, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Documentary==

''Rock, Rage &amp; Self Defense: An Oral History on Seattle's Home Alive'', a documentary on the collective, was released in 2013.&lt;ref name="Dawes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dawes|first=Laina|title=Finally, Filmmakers Tell the Forgotten History of Seattle DIY Self-Defense Group Home Alive|url=http://bitchmagazine.org/post/finally-filmmakers-tell-the-forgotten-history-of-seattle-diy-self-defense-group-home-alive|newspaper=Bitch|date=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a documentary by Rozz Therrien and Leah Michaels, two then-undergraduates at the [[University of Washington]]. Therrien graduated with a degree in American Ethnic Studies and Michaels graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[History]]. Originally just seeking information for class, they came together to create an [[oral history]] about the group Home Alive and did not find a lot of information on the Internet. Both Therrien and Michaels did not have any technical background in filmmaking and self-taught each other technical skills. They fundraised $10,000 to make the film in sound editing and to pay off legal fees through the Kickstarter campaign, grants and donations. In 2014 Therrien and Michaels are on tour screening their documentary across the country, and have recently shown support for the feminist movement [[YesAllWomen]] on their website in light of the [[2014 Isla Vista killings]].&lt;ref name="Dawes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tumblr for Rock, Rage, &amp; Self Defense|url=http://homealivedocumentary.tumblr.com/|publisher=Tumblr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creators hosted screenings of the documentary to various cities across the United States, and completed their last screening of their first tour on May 27, 2014.&lt;ref name="facebook"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rock, Rage &amp; Self Defense: An Oral History of Seattle's Home Alive |url=https://www.facebook.com/RockRageSelfDefenseDoc/ |website=Facebook community |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;This raised awareness across the country about self-defense and the history of Home Alive.&lt;ref name="facebook"/&gt;

==Founders==
The nine people considered responsible for founding the organization are:

*[[Valerie Agnew]]
*Zoe Bermet
*Gretta Harley
*Julie Hasse
*Lara Kidoguchi
*Jessica Lawless
*Mich Levy
*Cristien Storm 
*Stacey Wescott

==Founder statements==

Cristien Storm (one of the co-founders of Home Alive) stated that when they began the process of their band, everyone she knew was in a band and everyone supported each other throughout the community.  Young women make their music as art and a sense of feminism

Home Alive was created to demonstrate a sense of political activism, not just about going to shows and creating music. The bands supported each other and demonstrate a sense of collaboration and support through the use of music.

Cristien Storm also stated that the combination of all the events and experience that they have in their lives contributed to Home Alive. She implemented that the murder of Mia Zapata was not the one event that shape Home Alive, which is always used as the one event that shaped Home Alive.

Even though Mia Zapata's death was not the only event that contributed to the creation of Home Alive, her death did lead to a special organization of a collective community, a community which evolved into Home Alive and the mission to provide affordable self-defense training, education tools and grassroots activism.

"Most of the courses we found were quite expensive. and what they taught made no sense to us. We're musicians, artists, actors; we work in establishments late at night. They were telling us to change our lives." The group created their own agenda and create unconventional classes that would caters to people that have similar background as them &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Green|first=Timothy|title=Cristien Storm, Interview|url=http://digitalcollections.lib.washington.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/wwr/id/374/rec/3.com|newspaper=Digital Collections|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Guyana]] is a source country for men, women, and children subjected to [[human trafficking|trafficking in persons]], specifically conditions of [[forced prostitution]] and [[forced labor]]. Guyanese trafficking victim cases have been identified in the country, as well as in other countries in the region. Identified foreign victims have come from [[Human trafficking in Venezuela|Venezuela]] and [[Human trafficking in Brazil|Brazil]]. Forced prostitution occurs in [[brothel]]s on the coast and around mining camps, as well as in rum shops and Chinese restaurants. The common Guyanese practice of poor, rural families sending children to live with higher income family members or acquaintances in more populated areas has the potential to evolve into [[involuntary servitude|forced domestic servitude]]. Trafficking victims in Guyana may not self-identify to authorities due to fear of retribution from trafficking offenders, fear of resettlement to [[domestic abuse|abusive home situations]], and lack of awareness that human trafficking is a crime. Groups particularly vulnerable to human trafficking in Guyana include [[Amerindian]] females, foreign women (such as Brazilians) in [[prostitution]], and [[child prostitution|children]]. During the reporting period, the [[U.S. Department of Labor]] reported results of a project that withdrew 984 children from exploitive [[child labor]] in logging and saw-milling, fishing, [[Hazardous work|hazardous]] farming, factory work, mining, and freight handling from 2005 to 2009.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

The Government of Guyana does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Despite these efforts, the government did not initiate any new [[prosecution]]s of trafficking offenses during the reporting period, and has yet to convict or punish any trafficking offenders under its five-year-old anti-human trafficking law. Therefore, Guyana was placed on Tier 2 Watch List for the fourth consecutive yearin 2010. During the reporting period, the government and NGOs identified four victims of trafficking, two of whom [[prison]] officials proactively identified. The government provided some resources toward victim protection and local anti-trafficking groups. No suspected traffickers were charged, limiting the level of safety and protection that could be provided to victims. While the government took some tangible steps to raise awareness of human trafficking, including the establishment of focal point groups and an anti-trafficking task force, some local observers felt that the government discouraged discussions on developing effective strategies for combating this phenomenon of modern-day [[slavery]].&lt;ref name=dos&gt;"Guyana".

The [[U.S. State Department]]'s [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] placed the country in [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|"Tier 1"]]  in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2017/271117.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2017: Tier Placements|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecution==
The government made no discernible progress in prosecuting, convicting, and sentencing human trafficking offenders in Guyana during the reporting period. The Combating Trafficking of Persons Act of 2005 prohibits all forms of trafficking and prescribes sufficiently stringent penalties, ranging from three years to [[life imprisonment]], and which are commensurate with those for [[rape]]. The government reported four new trafficking investigations during the reporting period, none of which led to prosecutions. The government’s four prosecutions from previous reporting periods remained ongoing, with no significant progress. To date, the government has not convicted any trafficking offenders. Progress on the prosecution of criminal cases is perpetually delayed by judicial backlogs, incorrectly filed paperwork, or the failure of key parties to appear at hearings. [[NGO]]'s and one government official expressed concern that trafficking-related official [[complicity]] was a problem. It is reportedly common for [[defendant]]s to [[bribery|bribe]] court officials for favorable rulings. The Ministry of Home Affairs conducted two anti-trafficking training programs, one in partnership with IOM, for 120 [[police]], [[prosecutor]]s, and investigators during the reporting period.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Protection==
The government made some efforts to protect victims during the reporting period, but the number of identified victims was low, and the fact that the government charged no trafficking offenders and has yet to convict a trafficking offender undermined the effectiveness of those protections. The government, in partnership with IOM, developed a series of anti-trafficking focal point community groups around the country to help identify and refer possible trafficking victims to assistance organizations. While NGOs reported overall good working-level relations with anti-trafficking officials, some local observers expressed concern that pressure from senior officials may have prompted some lower-level officials to suppress information in order to avoid drawing attention to trafficking in Guyana. The Ministry tried to encourage identified victims to participate in prosecutions of traffickers by paying for travel costs associated with their [[witness|testifying]] in court. In one instance, the Ministry hired a private lawyer for a victim. Nevertheless, none of the four victims identified during the reporting period elected to participate in prosecutions. In a positive step during the reporting period, Guyanese prison officials identified two foreign victims of trafficking in detention and referred them to the Human Services Ministry for assistance. The government later dropped pending charges against the two victims. The government did not provide legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to their home countries where they may face hardship or [[Revenge|retribution]].&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Prevention==
The government made limited progress in the prevention of trafficking during the reporting period. The focal point groups conducted some public outreach activities in rural communities, including trafficking awareness programs targeting parents in Mahdia and Moruka, and distributing leaflets in Letherm to 440 local community leaders. The Ministry of Human Services continued to distribute IOM-funded posters, leaflets, and bumper stickers nationwide at large public gatherings throughout the year. The Ministry of Amerindian Affairs began a campaign for the issuance of [[birth certificate]]s, which may have a positive effect on preventing trafficking in Guyana, though one senior official indicated that Amerindians were not as vulnerable to trafficking as other government sources have indicated. There were no campaigns directly aimed at reducing the demand for [[commercial sex acts]] during the reporting period.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

'''iSpot''' is a website developed and hosted by the [[Open University]] with funding from the [[Open Air Laboratories]] (OPAL) network  with an online community intended to connect nature enthusiasts of all levels.

Registered users upload images of wildlife observations, identify species, and discuss their findings with other members. This is intended to provide opportunities to learn more about the wildlife they have observed, and also provides a database of observations which is made available for scientific analysis.

The site also provides some online identification tools.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, Open Air Laboratories network, http://www.opalexplorenature.org/ispot Access date 7 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The natural history observational skills required for accurate species identification in the field are neglected in formal education at all levels. iSpot is intended to help solve this problem by combining learning technology with crowdsourcing to connect beginners with experts.&lt;ref name="Silvertown 2015"/&gt;

==Communities==
The communities as of 2015 include the original UK and Ireland, Southern Africa, Hong Kong, Chile (Spanish language) and Global, which covers everywhere else. These communities can link to their own taxonomic lists, or use the default [[Catalogue of Life]] list.
In mid 2014 the global iSpot community exceeded 42000 registered participants.&lt;ref name="Silvertown 2015" /&gt;

==Function==
In a 2015 study it was found that over 94% of observations submitted to iSpot are identified to some level, (&gt;80% at species level), and that 92% of a representative sample of the identifications could be externally verified. Most observations were given an initial identification within an hour of posting.&lt;ref name="Silvertown 2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Silvertown | first1 = J | last2 = Harvey | first2 = M | last3 = Greenwood | first3 = R | last4 = Dodd | first4 = M | last5 = Rosewell | first5 = J | last6 = Rebelo | first6 = T | last7 = Ansine | first7 = J | last8 = McConway | first8 = K | year = 2015 | title = Crowdsourcing the identification of organisms: A case-study of iSpot | journal = ZooKeys | volume = 480 | issue = | pages = 125–146 | doi = 10.3897/zookeys.480.8803 | pmid=25685027 | pmc=4319112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Identification is refined as other members review and agree with an existing identification, or propose an alternative. There is no time limit to this process.

===Database===
The number of observations uploaded with photographic records exceeds 500 000 as of May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Harvey, ''Half a million observations on iSpot'', 13 May 2015, http://www.ispotnature.org/node/669956&lt;/ref&gt;

Observations are classified taxonomically according to the standard chosen by the community. The taxonomic classification follows the standard principles for zoological and botanical classification, with some modifications to make it easier for the lay-person. One such modification is the allocation of taxa to groups.

The groups used on iSpot are:
*Amphibians and Reptiles
*Birds
*Fish
*Fungi and Lichens
*Invertebrates
*Mammals
*Other organisms
*Plants

Observations are geographically located in decimal degrees to any precision input by the contributor, and where applicable, the position is derived from the EXIF of the lead photograph. The location details can also be input and edited manually. The location can be displayed on Google Maps. In some cases where the exact location must be hidden for conservation security, the map will display a rectangle surrounding the actual location. The location is then truncated to two decimal places, and this represents a corner of the rectangle.

===On-site reputation===
iSpot uses a unique reputation system to motivate and reward participants and as a tool to grade identifications of observations. 
Reputation points specific to one of the eight taxonomic groups used in the project are earned when an identification gets agreement from other participants, The value of the added points is proportional to the reputation for that group of the persons adding agreements.&lt;ref name="Silvertown 2015" /&gt; Exact values of reputation for the groups is not available to the users, but is displayed in the form of icons. Up to five icons may be displayed for any group, the first is awarded for a very small value, and the fifth for a rather large, but not publicly available value. Users with expert knowledge of taxonomy may be allocated an expert level reputation for the whole group in which their expertise is academically verifiable. For example, an expert on spiders would be considered an expert in all invertebrates. A similar but lesser reputation as "knowledgeable" can be allocated to users with informally acquired identification skills. The integration, if any, of earned reputation with allocated reputation is not publicly available.

This system is claimed to discriminate effectively between alternative identifications proposed for the same observation. The reputation system is shown to have improved the accuracy of the determination in 57% of cases studied. In the rest it either improved precision or revealed false precision.&lt;ref name="Silvertown 2015" /&gt;

The other form of reputation is proportional to the amount of contribution to the database in the form of observations and comments. These are accumulated as social points, and have no obvious value other than keeping score.

===Projects===
iSpot supports projects initiated by registered users and larger organisations, including at one time the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI)

====SANBI====
The [[South African National Biodiversity Institute]] once chose iSpot as a platform for several citizen science national biodiversity projects.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, SANBI Information resources, http://www.sanbi.org/information Accessed 8 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Originally iSpotZA was hosted independently of the main site, with a customised user interface, but at the end of 2014 it was integrated into the main site.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Harvey, 10 December 2014, Welcoming the new iSpot Southern Africa community, http://www.ispotnature.org/node/626685&lt;/ref&gt; Some functionality changed during the integration, but it has mostly been restored. SANBI has since migrated to [[iNaturalist]].

=====SeaKeys=====
SeaKeys is the first large collaborative marine biodiversity project run by SANBI and funded by the Foundational Biodiversity Information Program of the [[National Research Foundation (South Africa)|National Research Foundation]], which includes several citizen science projects on the iSpot website, such as:
*Sea Fish Atlas
*Sea Coral Atlas
*Sea Slug Atlas
*Crustacean Atlas

'''Japanese settlement''' in the [[Territory of Papua]] and [[German New Guinea]] (in what now constitutes modern-day [[Papua New Guinea]]) dates back to the early 20th century when migrants from Japan established copra plantations and trading businesses in the islands, specifically [[Rabaul]]. The Japanese community remained small throughout the first half of the 20th century, and never exceeded 100. Most Japanese in Papua were businessmen and plantation managers, although a few became fishermen. Many of them married local wives and raised mixed-race Japanese-Papuan families, and during [[World War II]] most Japanese were deported to [[Australia]] where they were confined. The majority of them were repatriated to Japan after the war, although their mixed-race children were allowed to remain behind and assimilated with the local populace.&lt;ref name="Kagoshima17"/&gt;

==History==

===Early years===

The first recorded Japanese presence in [[German New Guinea]] dates back to the beginning of the 20th century when a pearl diver, [[Isokichi Komine]] from [[Thursday Island]] in the [[Torres Strait Islands]] relocated to [[Rabaul]] in October 1901. Upon settling in Rabaul, Komine worked for its governor Albert Hahl in the plantation, trade and shipbuilding fields. Komine secured a thirty-year land lease from Hahl to build a shipyard on Rabaul in 1907, in addition to several other land concessions for [[copra]] plantation. At this time, Japanese migrants in Rabaul and the neighbouring islands joined Komine and worked for him.&lt;ref&gt;Gosden (2001), p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Other migrants settled in [[Port Moresby]] and [[Samarai]]. When [[World War I]] broke out in 1914, Japanese settlers in Rabaul experienced political tension as relations between Germany and Japan weakened. When Japan declared war against Germany in 1914, Komine aligned with the Australians, but also maintained close ties with German businessmen to safeguard his business interests. A few more Japanese migrated to New Guinea between 1914 and 1918 and established new independent enterprises that competed with Komine's, consisting mainly of copra plantations, pearl diving and trade. One Japanese businessman, Imaizumi Masao diversified into the entertainment industry and set up a picture theatre, ''New Britain Pictures'' in 1916.&lt;ref name="ATL005"&gt;[http://ir.kagoshima-u.ac.jp/bitstream/10232/110/1/ATL005.pdf The impact of World War I on Japanese settlers in Papua and New Guinea, 1914-1918] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222181033/http://ir.kagoshima-u.ac.jp/bitstream/10232/110/1/ATL005.pdf |date=2014-02-22 }}, South Pacific Study Vol. 16, No. 2, 1996, Hiromitsu Iwamoto, [[Kagoshima University]] Repository&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Japanese settlers who lived in the plantations occasionally suffered from tropical ailments including [[malaria]], although fatalities were rare. In Rabaul's [[Chinatown]], Japanese settlers became shopkeepers. Japanese settlers generally maintained cordial relations with the natives, and a sizeable majority intermarried with the natives from the 1910s onwards, although a few settlers brought their wives and families from Japan along.&lt;ref name="ATL005"/&gt; In the 1920s and 1930s, Japanese immigration to New Guinea remained minimal, which was attributed to strict immigration laws that was imposed by the Australian colonial government and discouraged Japanese settlement in New Guinea. In 1932, the Japanese community formed a Japanese society at Rabaul and nominated Nagahama Taichi as its first president. The Japanese maintained contact with [[Japan]] through a regular trading ship which visited Rabaul through [[Pohnpei]]. Around the same time, children of the first Japanese settlers&amp;mdash;usually offspring of Japanese fathers and Papuan mothers&amp;mdash;inherited their father's business enterprises.&lt;ref name="Kagoshima17"&gt;[http://ir.kagoshima-u.ac.jp/bitstream/10232/55/1/iwa.pdf Japanese Southward Expansion in the South Seas and its Relations with Japanese Settlers in Papua and New Guinea, 1919-1940] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222181030/http://ir.kagoshima-u.ac.jp/bitstream/10232/55/1/iwa.pdf |date=2014-02-22 }}, South Pacific Study Vol. 17, No. 1, 1996, Hiromitsu Iwamoto, Kagoshima University Repository&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II and aftermath===

A few Japanese left New Guinea between 1940 and 1941 in the [[Second World War]], as Japanese reconnaissance planes were often spotted within New Guinea's skies and hinted the prospect of a Japanese invasion. A trading ship from the South Seas Trading Company offered the Japanese residents to leave New Guinea, but some thirty-three Japanese chose to stay behind, ten of whom had raised local families during the interwar years. When reports of the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]] reached the Australian colonial administration on 8 December 1941, Japanese residents at Rabaul were immediately arrested and interned at the local jail, while the search and arrest for other Japanese residents in the neighbouring islands continued until May 1942. Indigenous spouses of Japanese residents as well as mixed-race Japanese children also faced similar fates as the other Japanese residents. When the Japanese captured Rabaul in January 1942, the Japanese residents who were interned were relocated to [[Sydney]], although their native spouses and children were left behind. The former residents were joined by other Japanese prisoners-of-war from [[New Hebrides]], [[New Caledonia]] and those from other parts of Australia.&lt;ref name="Kagoshima1997"&gt;[https://ir.kagoshima-u.ac.jp/bitstream/10232/60/1/Iwa.pdf The Pacific War in Relation to Japanese settlers in Papua New Guinea]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, South Pacific Study Vol. 17, No. 2, 1997, Hiromitsu Iwamoto, Kagoshima University Repository&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Japanese arrived in Rabaul in 1942, Japanese residents who were not captured welcomed the Japanese soldiers, who released the mixed-race Japanese from internment. Most of them initially held suspicions of the presence of Japanese military personnel, which was partly fuelled by the absence of their Japanese fathers who were relocated to concentration camps in Australia. During the Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945, mixed-race Japanese children were conscripted to clerical or light menial work within the military administration, and some received a Japanese education. At least one mixed-race Japanese, Pius Kikuchi, described the treatment of the Japanese military administration to the mixed-race children as gentle but discipline-oriented in nature. In other areas of Papua New Guinea which remained under Australian control, families of Japanese residents generally received harsh treatment from the Australian military.&lt;ref name="Kagoshima1997"/&gt; "[[Comfort women]]" formed another major component of the local Japanese community during the Japanese occupation years, which consisted of up to 3,000 Japanese and [[Korean people|Korean]] women who were stationed in Rabaul's Chinatown which was frequented by Japanese military personnel. One Australian Captain, David Hutchinson-Smith, also mentioned of some mixed-race, young Japanese-Papuan girls who were also conscripted as comfort women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rspas.anu.edu.au/papers/pah/Nelson_COMFORT_WOMEN_RABAUL.pdf The Consolation Unit: Comfort Women at Rabaul] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610042634/http://rspas.anu.edu.au/papers/pah/Nelson_COMFORT_WOMEN_RABAUL.pdf |date=2007-06-10 }}, [[Hank Nelson]], The Australian National University&amp;ndash;Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies, retrieved October 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] in 1945, former Japanese residents of Rabaul were automatically placed on the repatriation to Japan, and a debate ensued on the fate of ten former Japanese residents who had raised local families. Among the local populace, there was considerable [[anti-Japanese sentiment]] and graves of the first Japanese settlers were exhumed along with those of the Japanese soldiers and thrown into the sea. One Japanese resident was released from detention immediately after reaching Samarai. Another former resident, Izumi died of illness during internment and eight others were held under military custody until 1949 before they were deported to Japan. All eight former residents returned to Japan and realised that their assets in Japan and New Guinea were confiscated, although a few were able to re-integrate into the mainstream Japanese society. Some former residents maintained links with their native wives for a few years before remarrying in Japan, but none of them returned to Papua New Guinea throughout their remaining lives. The mixed-race Japanese assimilated with the local populace within a few years after the war and identified themselves as Papuans.&lt;ref name="Kagoshima1997"/&gt;

==Cultural profile==

A 1921 census counted 87 individuals, and the number of Japanese residents in New Guinea witnessed a decline until here were only 36 in 1940. Approximately one third were businessmen living in Rabaul, while the remainder were plantation managers and fishermen who lived mainly in [[Manus Province|Manus]], [[New Ireland Province|New Ireland]] and [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]]. In particular, a census done in 1933 counted 29 second-generation Japanese residents &amp;ndash; these comprised mixed-race Japanese Papuans as well as a few full-blooded Japanese, and nine long-term Japanese residents in Papua. First-generation Japanese residents were mostly adherents of Shinto and Buddhism, although they generally avoided celebrating religious or cultural festivals in public. No Japanese Shinto or Buddhist shrines were built during the interwar years, and Japanese residents publicly celebrated Australian holidays to avoid rousing suspicion from the Australian authorities. Upon marrying a native wife, Japanese residents conduct their wedding ceremonies in Christian churches, and often send their children to Catholic Mission schools. Most mixed-race children were taught to speak Papuan languages and English from infancy, and had little knowledge of the Japanese language and customs.&lt;ref name="Kagoshima17"/&gt; During the Japanese occupation, mixed-race Japanese were taught in the Japanese language as well as its cultural customs.&lt;ref name="Kagoshima1997"/&gt;

Therefore, interfaith couples can be legally married in Israel only if one of the partners converts to the religion of the other. However, civil, interfaith and same-sex marriages entered into abroad are recognized by the state.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Chabin 2013-06-13 [http://www.thejewishweek.com/special-sections/celebrate/married-mediterranean-not-israel Married On The Mediterranean — But Not In Israel] The Jewish Week.

It is illegal under ''Penal Law Amendment (Bigamy) Law'', 5719 (1959), to marry in Israel while already married. This applies to members of each confessional community, including the Jewish and Muslim,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/839776 The English Law of Bigamy in a Multi-Confessional Society: The Israel Experience] by P Shifman.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The 1959 law supersedes the ''Women's Equal Rights Law'' 1951&lt;/ref&gt; even though it is allowed in the [[Torah]] and the [[Quran]]. Despite its criminalization under Israeli law, [[polygyny]] is nevertheless still practiced by Israel’s Muslim [[Bedouin]] community, where about 25% of men are believed to have more than one wife,&lt;ref&gt;''Haaretz'' 27-3-08: [http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/state-program-to-tackle-problem-of-polygamy-in-bedouin-community-1.242837 State program to tackle problem of polygamy in Bedouin community]&lt;/ref&gt; and it is also recognized for existing marriages of immigrant Jews from diaspora communities where polygyny is widely practiced.

In 2013, the minimum marriage age in Israel was raised to 18, from a previous age of 17.&lt;ref&gt;Times of Israel, 4 November 2013: [http://www.timesofisrael.com/knesset-raise-minimum-marriage-age-from-17-to-18/ Israel raises minimum marriage age from 17 to 18]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ynetnews.com, 11.4.13: [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4449522,00.html Knesset raises marriage age to 18].&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the marriage age was 18 for males and 17 for females,&lt;ref&gt;Ottoman ''Law of Family Rights'' 1917 for males and ''Age of Marriage Law'' 1950 for females&lt;/ref&gt; before they were equalised at 17 years.

==History==
Under the [[Ottoman Empire]] all matters of a religious nature and personal status, which included marriage, were within the jurisdiction of Muslim courts and the courts of other recognized religions, called [[confessional community|confessional communities]], under a system known as [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Millet]]. Capitulation Treaties also permitted the registration of marriages and divorces in the British, German, American and other consulates during the Ottoman period. Jewish religious matters were handled by the [[Hakham Bashi]] and the Jewish courts.

Article 14 of the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate of Palestine]] required the mandatory administration to establish a commission to study, define, and determine the rights and claims relating to the different religious communities in Palestine. Article 15 required the mandatory administration to see to it that complete freedom of conscience and the free exercise of all forms of worship were permitted. Those mandates were never enforced or put into effect. The High Commissioner established the Orthodox Rabbinate and retained a modified Millet system that recognized only eleven religious communities: Muslims, Jews and nine Christian denominations (none of which were Christian [[Protestant]] churches). All those who were not members of these recognised communities were excluded from the Millet arrangement, and "marriages" conducted in Palestine outside these communities were not recognised. Consular marriages remained customary during the British Mandate and civil divorces granted in other countries were registered and recognized by the mandatory administration. Provision was made for the registration of marriages,&lt;ref&gt;Order-in-Council: "Order of Marriage and Divorce (Registration)".&lt;/ref&gt; but not for the manner in which marriages would be conducted.

It has been argued that the Ottomans and the British did not contemplate a situation in which a person who belonged to one of the recognized communities would want to be married in a non-religious ceremony within that community. It has been claimed that there was no opposition to religious marriages when the religious courts were given authority in these matters. However, no provision was made for marriages between people who were not both members of the same, recognised, community.

===Jewish community===
{{see also|Jewish views of marriage}}

It is a criminal offense for Jews in Israel to marry in weddings performed outside the state’s religious authority, and doing so can result in a jail sentence of up to two years. [[Hiddush]] ranked Israel as the only Western democracy that is on a par with Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia and other Islamic states in relation to freedom of marriage. Hiddush also found that almost two thirds of Israeli Jews do not know that Israeli Jewish couples who marry in civil ceremonies overseas can, according to Israeli law, only get divorced through the Israeli Orthodox Rabbinical Courts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/in-ottoman-holdover-israel-doubles-down-on-marriage-restrictions/ In Ottoman holdover, Israel doubles down on marriage restrictions] The Times of Israel, June 2, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947 [[David Ben-Gurion]] and the religious parties reached an agreement that included an understanding that matters of personal status in Israel, which included marriage, would continue to be determined by religious authorities. This arrangement has been termed the [[Status quo (Israel)|status quo]] agreement and has been maintained despite numerous changes of government since.

Under the arrangement, the Mandate period confessional system would continue, with membership in the Jewish community being on the basis of membership of a body called "[[Knesset Israel]]", which was a voluntary organization that managed registrations of people who were related to it—that is, those recognised as Jews. There does not seem to have been any dispute at the time of [[Who is a Jew|who was a Jew]]. Jews could choose not to register with "Knesset Israel". Members of [[World Agudath Israel|Agudath Israel]], for example, chose not to register.

Before 1953 "Knesset Israel" courts had authority over Jews registered with it. However, in 1953 [[rabbinical court]]s were established with jurisdiction over matters of marriage and divorces of ''all'' Jews in Israel, nationals and residents. (section 1) It was also provided that marriages and divorces of Jews in Israel would be conducted according to the law of the [[Torah]]. (section 2)

Since 1953 the rabbinate has only approved marriages between Jews in Israel conducted in accordance with the Orthodox interpretation of ''halakha''. The changes were applauded by religious Jews, but have been criticized by secular Jews since they were instituted. The only exception to these arrangements was that marriages entered into abroad were recognised as valid in Israel.

[[Jewish view of marriage|Jewish marriage]] and [[Get (divorce document)|divorce]] in Israel is under the jurisdiction of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]], which defines a person's Jewish status strictly according to ''halakha''. The rabbinate's standards and interpretations in these matters are generally used by the Israeli Interior Ministry in registering marriages and divorces.

''Halakhic'' and biblical restrictions on marriage are applied in Israel. So, for example, a [[kohen]] may not marry a convert to Judaism. Similarly, [[mamzer|children of adulterous and incestuous unions]] are restricted as to whom they can marry.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:IsraeliBride.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Traditional Jewish Israeli hennah dress]] --&gt;
Up to 1999, any marriage council had the option to send a person to a [[:he:בירור יהדות|Judaism test]] (Hebrew). A governing document&lt;ref&gt;סא/2 תמוז התשס"א&lt;/ref&gt; that defined rules of marriage had been finally concluded in 2001. Contrary to guidelines, some councils didn't fulfill the guideline; several petitions had been sent to the  high court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beteisrael.co.il/article.asp?ArtId=1207 |title=ביתא ישראל - יהדות - חתונה מאוחרת לצעירה אתיופית (אתר ביתא ישראל ) |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102184814/http://www.beteisrael.co.il/article.asp?ArtId=1207 |archivedate=2013-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A research showed that 93.5% of people sent to Judaism test had been from the former Soviet Union and 83% of them succeeded and 10% left the process. In 2010 a final ruling defined that all immigrants after 1990 must go over a Judaism test.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

However, Israel does recognise civil or religious marriages entered into outside Israel. It is usual for couples who may not or choose not to marry in Israel to travel overseas to marry.&lt;ref name="fourhundred"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=776653|title=Four Hundred Brides for 1,000 Men|last=Ilan|first=Shahar|date=2006-10-19|newspaper=Haaretz|accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; One out of every ten Israelis who married in 2000 did so abroad mainly because they could not marry in Israel. 2,230 couples who married abroad consisted of two Israeli partners, and another 3,660 couples consisted of an Israeli and a non-Israeli partner.&lt;ref name="fourhundred" /&gt; Orthodox rabbi, [[Chuck Davidson]], who is not recognised as a celebrant by the Chief Rabbis, has said "An Elvis impersonator in Las Vegas has more meaning to the state than me, an Orthodox rabbi". Davidson has challenged the law by being willing to conduct illegal weddings in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/12/23/world/middleeast/ap-ml-israel-rogue-weddings.html|title=With Few Options, Israeli Couples Turn to Rogue Weddings|last=Press|first=The Associated|date=2017-12-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-27|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of civil marriages is a major issue for secular Jews and members of non-Orthodox streams of Judaism, who are required to meet the Orthodox standards to be able to marry in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Secularism vs Orthodox Judaism| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/events/israel_at_50/israel_today/81033.stm| publisher=BBC News| first=Jonathan| last=Marcus| date=1998-04-22| accessdate=2007-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a debate over whether civil marriages would divide the Jewish people in Israel by increasing interfaith marriages and marriages that do not meet ''halakhic'' requirements, and over the character of the [[Jewish state]].

Most secular Jews view their Jewish identity as a matter of culture, heritage, nationality, or ethnicity.&lt;ref name="who"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/judaism.htm|title=What Is Judaism?|last=Rich|first=Tracey R.|publisher=Judaism 101|accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancestral aspects can be explained by the many Jews who view themselves as atheist and are defined by matrilineal descent&lt;ref name="katz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judaism.about.com/od/whoisajew/a/whoisjewdescent.htm|title=Who is a Jew?|last=Katz|first=Lisa|work=Judaism|publisher=About.com|accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aboutatheism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atheism.about.com/library/world/AJ/bl_IsraelJudaism.html|title=Judaism in Israel|work=Judaism|publisher=About.com|accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[Kohen|Cohen (Kohen)]] or [[Levi]], which is connected by ancestry.&lt;ref name="cohenlevi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cohen-levi.org|title=The Tribe|publisher=The Cohen-Levi Family Heritage|accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question of "who is a Jew" is a question that is under debate.&lt;ref name="weiner"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/whojew1.html|title=Who is a Jew?|last=Weiner|first=Rebecca|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, matters concerning marriage in Israel are controlled by strict Orthodox standards and disputed issues are resolved by the Israeli Chief Rabbinate.

Orthodox ''halachic'' rules apply to converts who want to marry in Israel. Under these rules, a conversion to Judaism must strictly follow ''halachic'' standards to be recognised as valid. The rabbinate even scrutinizes Orthodox conversions, with some who have converted by orthodox authorities outside of Israel not being permitted to marry in Israel. For example, a man who converted to Orthodox Judaism in the USA was denied an official marriage in Israel on the grounds that his conversion may not have been legitimate and that the Orthodox rabbi who converted him in Louisiana is not recognized in Israel.&lt;ref name="jstandard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="meyers"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/6943/edition_id/131/format/html/displaystory.html|title=Are Israel’s Marriage Laws ‘Archaic and Irrelevant’?|last=Meyers|first=Nechemia|date=1997-07-12|publisher=Jewish News Weekly|accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the rabbinical courts, which operate according to ''[[halakha]]'' ([[Torah]] law), a Jewish woman is allowed to initiate divorce proceedings, but her husband must give his consent to make the divorce final. If the husband disappears or refuses to grant the divorce, the wife is considered an "''[[agunah]]''" (lit. "chained woman") and may not remarry or give birth to ''halakhically'' legitimate children. Rabbinical tribunals may, and sometimes do, rebuke a husband who refused divorce, but still do not grant a divorce without his consent.&lt;ref name="hr2010"&gt;[https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/nea/154463.htm 2010 Human Rights Report: Israel and the occupied territories.] U.S. Department of state. ''This article incorporates public domain material from this source''.&lt;/ref&gt;

If a person's Jewish status is in doubt, then formal conversion is required in order to be allowed to marry according to the Orthodox rules, which govern all marriages between Jews in Israel.

According to an editorial in ''The New York Jewish Week:''
&lt;blockquote&gt;As a result, non-Orthodox Jewish couples are forced to submit to an Orthodox marriage ceremony with an Orthodox rabbi and are compelled to attend classes on family purity.{{cref|Family purity}} No Israeli may marry outside his faith community. Hundreds of thousands of Israeli citizens from the former Soviet Union who are not Jewish or whose Jewish ancestry is in doubt are unable to marry at all inside Israel.&lt;ref name="jewishweek"&gt;Mazie, Steven V. [http://www.thejewishweek.com/top/editletcontent.php3?artid=5002 "Changing Israel’s Marriage Law"] ''The Jewish Week'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009000931/http://www.thejewishweek.com/top/editletcontent.php3?artid=5002 |date=October 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A person who was born as the result of an adulterous or incestuous union is limited in whom he or she can marry. The most common case of this is a person who was married halachically but not divorced halachically.  In October 2013, however, the Tzohar law was passed and effectivity ended the monopoly which community Orthodox Rabbis had over weddings and allowed for people of Jewish faith to pick a rabbi of their choosing outside the area which they live, though it still does not account for people who converted to either Conservative and Reform Judaism .&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesofisrael.com/knesset-set-to-pass-marriage-registration-reform/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/30/world/middleeast/centrist-party-in-israel-introduces-civil-union-bill.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 [[Tzohar (organization)|Tzohar]] (a religious Zionist rabbinic organization in Israel), along with the [[Israeli Bar Association]], introduced a prenuptial agreement meant to help ensure divorcing wives will receive a [[Get (divorce document)|get]]; under the agreement the husband commits to paying a high sum of money daily to his spouse in the event of a separation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/2015/03/03/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/new-prenup-aims-to-prevent-agunot |title=Israeli rabbinic, legal groups partner for prenup in bid to prevent agunot &amp;#124; Jewish Telegraphic Agency |publisher=Jta.org |date=2015-03-03 |accessdate=2015-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muslim community===
{{refimprove|section|date=October 2018}}
Most Muslims in Israel are [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Arab]]s.

In 1922, the British created the [[Supreme Muslim Council]] as the Muslim religious authority in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] and appointed [[Amin al-Husayni]] (1895–1974) as the [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]]. The council was abolished in 1948 by [[Jordan]], but was reconstituted in Jerusalem after the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967.

As the law of the land in relation to marriages has formally remained the Islamic law prior to the establishment of the State of Israel, it was not necessary for the Muslim community to formally "accept" these arrangements.

Muslim marriages are conducted in accordance with [[Islamic marital jurisprudence|Islamic law and customs]]. Inter-faith marriages are permitted between Muslim males and Christian or Jewish females, but the opposite is not currently allowed for female Muslims.

Sharia courts deal with personal status issues in the Muslim community.

A Muslim woman may petition for and receive a divorce through the Sharia courts without her husband's consent under certain conditions, and a marriage contract may provide for other circumstances in which she may obtain a divorce without her husband's consent. A Muslim man may divorce his wife without her consent and without petitioning the court.&lt;ref name="hr2010"/&gt;

===Christian churches===
{{see also|Christian views of marriage}}

There are nine officially recognised churches for the purposes of marriage. These are the [[Greek Orthodox]], [[Roman Catholic]] (Latin rite), [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]], [[Armenian Catholic]], [[Syriac Catholic Church|Syriac Catholic]], [[Chaldean (Uniate)]], [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Melkite Greek Catholic]], [[Maronite]] and [[Syriac Orthodox]] churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/freedom-of-religion-in-israel|title=Freedom of Religion in Israel|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, the [[Anglican Church]] was included with these recognised churches. At the same time, special arrangements for the recognition of marriage were made between the State of Israel and the [[Lutheran]], [[Ethiopian Orthodox]], and [[Coptic Orthodox]] churches.

Christians may seek official separations or divorces, depending on the denomination, through ecclesiastical courts.&lt;ref name="hr2010"/&gt;

===Druze community===

The [[Druze]] community was recognized as a separate community from the Muslim community in 1957. In 1962, separate Druze courts were established to deal with personal status issues in the Druze community, alongside the rabbinical courts, the Sharia courts, and the courts of the Christian communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-mago.co.il/e-magazine/druze.html Druze in israel], דרוזים בישראל: היבט היסטורי ומרחבי , [[liat ytzhak]], e-mago magazine, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of confessional system==
The status quo agreement creates difficulties for people who, for whatever reason, cannot marry or divorce within the system, or who do not want to marry in a religious ceremony. The issue became acute when large numbers of immigrants ([[olim]]) from the former Soviet Union arrived in Israel in the 1990s. Although they became Israeli citizens under the [[Law of Return]], some of the olim were not considered Jewish by the rabbinate, which requires proof of maternal Jewish descent.

== Partial recognition of civil marriage ==

In 1951 the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] ruled{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} that marriages entered into outside Israel conducted by a rabbinical court in accordance with ''halakha'' must be recognized in Israel. The case before the court involved a couple who were not residents or citizens of Israel at the time of their marriage. However, commentators have noted that the case did not deal with a situation where one or both of the couple were residents or citizens of Israel, nor with a civil marriage abroad.

The issue of recognition of civil marriages is of special significance in Judaism because Orthodox Judaism has various prohibitions involving marriages. This includes, but is not limited to, restrictions on marriages involving a [[mamzer]] and by [[kohen]]im. Such marriages will not be sanctioned by religious authorities and as there is no form of civil marriage, cannot be formally entered into in Israel. The couples in these prohibited marriage situations sometimes marry overseas, mostly in [[Cyprus]], which is near Israel.&lt;ref name="Atlantic"&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/02/getting-married-in-israel-why-it-so-often-means-hiring-a-detective/273127/ Getting Married in Israel: Why It So Often Means Hiring a Detective], [[Daniel Estrin]], [[The Atlantic]], February 13, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, the Supreme Court determined{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} that the Ministry of the Interior must register as married couples who married in a civil marriage abroad, even if either or both of the couple were citizens of Israel. This judgment was interpreted as a minor technical issue, {{Who|date=May 2009}} as the act of registration was said to be for statistical purposes only, and not a recognition of the personal status of the couple, as registration does not determine the validity of the marriage.

In 2006, the Supreme Court voted 6-1 to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel's Supreme Court recognizes foreign same-sex marriages|url=https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Israel%27s_Supreme_Court_recognizes_foreign_same-sex_marriages|accessdate=7 December 2017|publisher=Wikinews|date=22 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a judgment given in November 2006{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} retired President of the Supreme Court [[Aharon Barak]] ruled that the recognition of a civil marriage entered into abroad extended to its validity and recognition as a marriage for the purpose of [[Mishpat Ivri|Israeli law]], overruling a rabbinical court, which had determined that a religious court had the authority to decide the validity or otherwise of a civil marriage entered into abroad.

In 2010, Israel passed the ''Civil Union Law for Citizens with no Religious Affiliation, 2010'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Julie|first1=Dayer|title=גן הרמוזו אולם (אולמות) אירועים מודיעין, יוקרתי (יוקרתיים) בירושלים במודיעין במרכז הארץ, גני אירועים מרכז|url=http://www.hermozo.co.il|website=הרמוזו|publisher=אולם אירועים במרכז|accessdate=14 June 2016|language=he-IL|date=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing a couple to form a [[civil union]] in Israel if they are both registered as officially not belonging to any religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/israel/Contemporary_Life/Society_and_Religious_Issues/Freedom_of_Religion/civil_marriage_in_israel.shtml|title=Civil Marriage in Israel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the [[Florida Third District Court of Appeal]] held that although Israel recognizes "reputed spouses" as a legal union, the union is not a marriage under Israeli law, and therefore Florida law does not recognize the relationship as a marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Cohen v. Shushan |vol=212 |reporter=So.3d |opinion=1113 |pinpoint= |court= |date=2017 |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/inflco20170315170 |accessdate=September 23, 2017 |quote=Our decision upholds a fine — but very clear — distinction that has been set within Israel's marital law, one we must maintain out of respect to Israel's law-making authority. Because Ms. Shushan and the late Mr. Cohen's legal union was not entered into through any recognized religious authority, they were not married under Israeli law. Ms. Shushan, therefore, could not be a surviving spouse of Mr. Cohen }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divorce process==

The 1973 Spouses' Property Relations Act officially defined what assets would be divided after divorce or if one of the spouses dies, unless they both agreed beforehand.&lt;ref name=ppafvaga /&gt; An amendment was later added to the 1973 law in 2008 to ensure that property would be divided equally among both spouses before the divorce rather than after.&lt;ref name=ppafvaga&gt;http://www.family-laws.co.il/property-couples-married-after-1974-relevant-law&lt;/ref&gt; 

Under the nation's Capacity and Guardianship Law, [[child custody]] was almost always granted to the mother following a divorce.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jpost.com/National-News/UN-calls-on-Israel-to-amend-custody-law&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, however, an amendment was added to the law to ensure that both the father and any child of the divorced parents who is at least six years of age would share equal rights as the mother as state-appointed social workers determine child custody.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/israel-s-justice-minister-divorced-parents-must-share-custody-of-children-1.408169&lt;/ref&gt;  The age of the child with equal privilege was later lowered to two in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.562439&lt;/ref&gt; 

The divorce process in Israel for married people of Jewish faith is administered by the [[Get (divorce document)|Get Procedure]] and finalized by Rabbinical Judges.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/560113/jewish/The-Get-Procedure.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  On November 15, 2016, the Get Procedure was officially regulated after State Attorney Shai Nitzan required criminal prosecution of men or women who refuse to grant or accept a divorce after being instructed to do so by a rabbinical court, although some said it would not have a dramatic impact since criminal proceedings will only be possible if the rabbinical court issues a rarely used ruling obligating a spouse to agree to the divorce.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Israeli-divorce-refusal-to-be-criminalized-in-certain-circumstances-472674&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 the [[Knesset]] passed a law, slated to remain in effect for three years, allowing Israel’s rabbinical courts to handle certain cases of Jewish women wishing to divorce their Jewish husbands, even if neither the wife nor the husband is an Israeli citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-israel-gives-rabbinical-courts-unprecedented-control-over-diaspora-jew-1.6216340 |title=Israel gives rabbinical courts unprecedented jurisdiction over Diaspora Jews - Israel News |publisher=Haaretz.com |date= |accessdate=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on civil marriage==
Since the establishment of the rabbinical courts, the status quo agreement has been strongly supported by the religious community, but criticised by others. The main argument of the supporters of the system is that a change of the status quo agreement will divide the Jewish people in Israel between those who marry according to Jewish religious standards and those who marry in a civil marriage. Civil marriages would not be registered or scrutinized by the rabbinate. In certain circumstances, such as when a woman who was previously married according to Jewish religious standards entered into a civil marriage without obtaining a religiously-valid divorce decree (get), the children produced by civil marriages could be considered illegitimate or [[mamzer]]im, which would prohibit them from marrying any Jew who was not also a mamzer. Opponents of the status quo agreement consider the system to be contrary to people's [[civil rights]].

In 2011, roughly 9,000 couples registered with the [[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics|Central Bureau of Statistics]] that they were married overseas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forward.com/news/breaking-news/187982/israel-couples-say-i-dont-to-orthodox-marriage-o/ "Israel Couples Say 'I Don't' to Orthodox Marriage — Opt for Civil Ceremonies."] ''The Forward''.  20 November 2013.  1 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most of the debate relating to civil marriage in Israel is conducted in the Jewish community, the issue has the same implications for all other recognised religious communities in Israel.

===Support for religious marriages===

Supporters of the status quo agreement argue that:

* When people are married according to Jewish law and subsequently divorce civily, children from a subsequent marriages of the woman will be ''mamzerim'', who are severely limited by Jewish law in whom they can marry. This, together with acceptance of non-Orthodox conversions, will split the Jewish people into two groups that can not marry one another.
* Marriages in the rabbinical court preserve the holiness of the state of Israel and add a spiritual and religious dimension of [[family purity]] according to Jewish religious laws.
* Civil marriage will lead to assimilation and intermarriage. Marriage in the rabbinical court, it is argued, is a guarantee to the continuation of the existence of the Jewish population in the state of Israel.
* A secular legislator is incapable of understanding the importance of religious ''halakha'' standards to the religious community.
* From a religious standpoint, a religious ceremony causes no harm even though it imposes ''halakhic'' standards on non-religious Israelis—it is even considered by the religious community to be a [[mitzvah]], a noble deed.

===Support for civil marriages===

Supporters of civil marriage in Israel argue that the status quo agreement violates the rights of Israeli citizens by:

* imposing religious standards on those who do not desire it.
* creating difficulty for the marriages of people who belong to different religious communities and people who do not observe any religion.
* not permitting marriages of those who are prohibited by halakha, such as marriage between a person considered to be a [[mamzer]], or a [[Kohen|Cohen]] wishing to marry a divorcee. It also prohibits widows who did not have any children from a previous husband from getting remarried without passing [[halizah]].
* restricting religious equality by refusing to delegate authority to [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] communities.
* discriminating against women, by the inclusion of institutions such as [[Agunah|Agunot]] and "recalcitrant wives", and by refusing to permit women to officiate as rabbis in the rabbinical court.

Supporters of civil marriage also argue that the status quo agreement is in breach of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], Article 16, which states that "men and women of full age, without any limitation due to [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[nationality]] or [[religion]], have the right to marry and to found a family."

After the [[Arrest of Dov Haiyun|Rabbi Dov Haiyun was arrested]] for performing an unsanctioned wedding, the director of Israeli civil rights organization ''Israel Hofsheet'' (Be Free Israel) called for the "immediate legislation of a civil marriage law".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Police detain Conservative rabbi over 'illegal' weddings| work = Ynetnews| accessdate = 2018-08-12| url = https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5313038,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrangement attempts of the legal situation==

===The verdict===

At the times when people petitioned the Supreme Court of Israel, trying to convince the Supreme Court to form an authority of civil marriages, the Supreme Court refused to do so, declaring that this was the responsibility of the [[Knesset]]. In cases when people requested to proclaim themselves as being "[[non-religious]]", in order that the court would be able to recognize his or her marriage according to an acceptable civil judgment, the court rejected their assertion. The only time in which the Court determined that the Ministry had to recognize a marriage between a Cohen and a divorcee was when it was based on the religious law that determines that those are forbidden marriages from the start but allowable post factum. {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

===Alternative methods===
Over time a number of alternative methods have been used by couples who wished to marry without a religious ceremony, or who were unable to marry in Israel.

One method is to marry outside Israel; nearby [[Cyprus]] became the most convenient venue for many Israelis. [[Paraguay]], which allows [[Proxy marriage|marriage without the presence of the couple]] to be arranged by the Paraguayan consulate in Tel Aviv, is another jurisdiction used.

Another approach is to resort to what is called a "[[common-law marriage]]". A common-law marriage entitles the partners to most of the rights of a formally married couple in relation to [[inheritance]], [[pension]]s and the [[Tenant rights|landlord and tenant matters]]. However, the status of common-law marriage is not equal to that of formal marriage in many fields. For example, exemption from military service for a married woman only applies to a formally married woman.

Jurist Frances Radi supports these attempts to "bypass the law in legal ways", but points out that the necessity of an Israeli to resort to the use of a foreign state in order to get married diminishes the value of the alternative ways to get married. In her view, "the existence of those minor alternatives only points out the lack of the respect to secular values that the Israeli judiciary demonstrates".

Others such as Rabbi [[Chuck Davidson]] conduct religious weddings outside of the framework of the state&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/in-ottoman-holdover-israel-doubles-down-on-marriage-restrictions/|title=In Ottoman holdover, Israel doubles down on marriage restrictions|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Under Israeli law Davidson can be jailed for up to two years, although this law has not yet been tested by the courts.

===Political attempts to resolve the situation===

In the late 1960s the [[Independent Liberals (Israel)|Independent Liberal]] party attempted to enable civil marriages for couples who could not marry in rabbinical courts; however, this attempt caused a governmental crisis.

The left-wing [[Meretz-Yachad|Meretz]] party, and its historical component parties [[Mapam]], [[Ratz (political party)|Ratz]] and [[Shinui]] have been trying to allow civil marriages in Israel for a long time, but without success. At the start of the 21st century several rabbis (including the chief Sephardi rabbi of Israel, [[Shlomo Amar]]) said that the great alienation that this situation creates does not serve the religious interest. As part of the coalition agreement for [[Ariel Sharon]]'s second government, the [[Shinui]] party demanded that a legal solution be found for those who could not marry within Israel. A committee formed to find a solution for this problem came up with the "coupling arrangement" solution (ברית הזוגיות). This committee, which was led by Israeli parliament members [[Roni Bar-On]], [[Yuri Stern]], Nisan Slomianski and Roni Brizon, and represented parties from the wide political religious spectrum from the Shinui party to the [[National Religious Party|Mafdal]] party, eventually submitted a bill by which there would be a separate status recognised for people who came in the pact of duality,{{clarify|date=October 2010}} which would not be considered as "marriage" but would be as similar as possible to the marriage institution. The bill never reached further legislation procedures.

In July 2007 Israel's Justice Minister [[Daniel Friedmann]] and the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel|chief rabbi of Israel]] [[Shlomo Amar]] reached an agreement on a limited bill for civil marriages in Israel, which would apply only to the marriage of Israelis who do not belong to any recognized religious community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Bill to allow limited civil marriage in Israel for first time| url=http://uk.news.yahoo.com/afp/20070719/twl-lifestyle-israel-3cd7efd_1.html |publisher=Yahoo News| first=Charly| last=Wegman| date=2007-07-19| accessdate=2007-07-24}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a bill was introduced by [[Yisrael Beiteinu]] in 2009, eventually passing the Knesset in May 2010; this bill, however, only grants "couplehood union" status to couples who both declared non-religious status.&lt;ref name=lerner2011p214 /&gt;

==History==
The Mombasa Republican Council was formed in 1999 to address perceived political and [[economic discrimination]] against the people of the coast province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theafricareport.com/index.php/20120517501811752/east-horn-africa/kenya-s-mombasa-republican-council%E2%80%A9-the-coast-calls-for-freedom-501811752.html |title=Kenya's Mombasa Republican Council : The Coast calls for freedom &amp;#91;501811752&amp;#93; &amp;#124; African news, analysis and opinion – The Africa Report.com |first= |last= |work=theafricareport.com |date=May 17, 2012 |quote=political and economic discrimination |accessdate=20 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702202413/http://www.theafricareport.com/index.php/20120517501811752/east-horn-africa/kenya-s-mombasa-republican-council%E2%80%A9-the-coast-calls-for-freedom-501811752.html |archivedate=July 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group traces its secession claims to the 1895 and 1963 agreements transferring the ten-mile strip of land along the coast to the Government of Kenya from Zanzibar. Some critics characterize these British agreements as a form of bribery designed to facilitate colonization of the interior. The group contests these agreements as invalid, because they were enacted without the consent of coastal stakeholders, and says the state of Kenya has failed to honor the provisions designed to protect the coastal population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.kecosce.org/downloads/MRC_Conflict_Assessment_Threats_and_Opportunities_for_Engagement.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - 11-11-17 MRC Conflict Assessment Report - Final - MRC_Conflict_Assessment_Threats_and_Opportunities_for_Engagement.pdf |first1=Paul |last1=Goldsmith  |work=kecosce.org |date=November 2011 |quote=independent demographi |accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secession claims==

The Mombasa Republican Council was dormant until 2008, when it first raised claims that Mombasa should secede from Kenya to become an independent state. They argued that secession would liberate the people of the coast province from marginalization by the successive governments in Kenya. The slogan they are using is ''Pwani Si Kenya'' ("The [[Coast Province|Coast]] is not Kenya").&lt;ref name=allafrica&gt;{{cite web |url= http://allafrica.com/stories/201206270319.html |title=allAfrica.com: Kenya: Mombasa Republican Council - Liberators or Nascent Radical Fanatics? |first= |last= |work=allafrica.com |date=June 27, 2012 |accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the government declared the group to be an illegal organization, together with another 33 groups.&lt;ref name=allafrica/&gt;

Mombasa Republican Council contested the government's decision in the court. The high court of Mombasa lifted the ban and ruled that claiming the group was illegal was [[Constitution of Kenya|unconstitutional]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nation.co.ke/News/Court+lifts+Mombasa+Republican+Council+ban/-/1056/1462994/-/xftshpz/-/index.html |title=Court lifts Mombasa Republican Council ban - News &amp;#124;nation.co.ke |first= |last=NATION Reporter |work=nation.co.ke |year=2012 |accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Public opinion on nuclear issues''' is the aggregate of [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s or [[belief]]s held by the adult population concerning [[nuclear power]], [[nuclear weapons]] and [[uranium mining]].

Surveys about nuclear power use have been conducted internationally for four decades. Surveys originally examined public opinion on building new nuclear power plants. In the U.S., support has declined over the period from the mid-1970s through 2000. The Japanese were more supportive of nuclear power expansion during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629614000358 |title=Attitudes toward nuclear power and energy-saving behavior among Japanese households  |author1=Hiroshi Arikawaa |author2=Yang Caob |author3=Shigeru Matsumoto |date=2014 |work=Energy Research &amp; Social Science |doi=10.1016/j.erss.2014.04.002 |volume=2 |pages=12–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2005==
In 2005, the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] presented the results of a series of public opinion surveys in the ''Global Public Opinion on Nuclear Issues'' report.&lt;ref name= IAE/&gt;  Majorities of respondents in 14 of the 18 countries surveyed believe that the risk of [[nuclear terrorism|terrorist acts involving radioactive materials]] at nuclear facilities is high, because of insufficient protection. While majorities of citizens generally support the continued use of existing nuclear power reactors, most people do not favour the building of new nuclear plants, and 25% of respondents feel that all nuclear power plants should be closed down.&lt;ref name= IAE/&gt; Stressing the [[climate change]] benefits of nuclear energy positively influences 10% of people to be more supportive of expanding the role of nuclear power in the world, but there is still a general reluctance to support the building of more nuclear power plants.&lt;ref name=IAE&gt;[[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (2005). [http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Reports/gponi_report2005.pdf Global Public Opinion on Nuclear Issues and the IAEA: Final Report from 18 Countries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409124139/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Reports/gponi_report2005.pdf |date=2008-04-09 }} p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

A poll in the [[European Union]] for Feb-Mar 2005 showed 37% in favour of nuclear energy and 55% opposed, leaving 8% undecided.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euractiv.com/en/opinion/majority-europeans-oppose-nuclear-power/article-145003 EurActiv.com - Majority of Europeans oppose nuclear power | EU - European Information on EU Priorities &amp; Opinion&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The same agency ran another poll in Oct-Nov 2006 that showed 14% favoured building new nuclear plants, 34% favoured maintaining the same number, and 39% favoured reducing the number of operating plants, leaving 13% undecided. This poll showed that the approval of nuclear power rose with the education level of respondents and was lower for women.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_271_en.pdf Europeans and Nuclear Safety], February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==2007==
In the United States, the [[Nuclear Energy Institute]] has run polls since the 1980s. A poll in conducted March 30 to April 1, 2007 chose solar as the most likely largest source for electricity in the US in 15 years (27% of those polled) followed by nuclear, 24% and coal, 14%. Those who were favourable of nuclear being used dropped to 63% from a historic high of 70% in 2005 and 68% in September, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nei.org/newsandevents/newsreleases/surveyrevealsgap/ Survey Reveals Gap in Public’s Awareness] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20081023223217/http://www.nei.org/newsandevents/newsreleases/surveyrevealsgap/ |date=2008-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A CBS News/New York Times poll in 2007 showed that a majority of Americans would not like to have a nuclear plant built in their community, although an increasing percentage would like to see more nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pollingreport.com/energy.htm Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

The two fuel sources that attracted the highest levels of support in the ''2007 [[MIT]] Energy Survey'' are [[solar power]] and [[wind power]]. Outright majorities would choose to “increase a lot” use of these two fuels, and better than three out of four Americans would like to increase these fuels in the U. S. energy portfolio. Fourteen per cent of respondents would like to see [[nuclear power]] "increase a lot".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Ansolabehere.

A September 2007 survey conducted by the Center for International and Security Studies at the [[University of Maryland]] showed that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
63 percent of Russians favor eliminating all nuclear weapons, 59 percent support removing all nuclear weapons from high alert, and 53 percent support cutting the Russian and U.S. nuclear arsenals to 400 nuclear weapons each. In the United States, 73 percent of the public favors eliminating all nuclear weapons, 64 percent support removing all nuclear weapons from high alert, and 59 percent support reducing Russian and U.S. nuclear arsenals to 400 weapons each. Eighty percent of Russians and Americans want their countries to participate in the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.&lt;ref name=lawsw&gt;Lawrence S. Wittner.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==2010==
According to a 2010 [[Soka Gakkai International]] survey of youth attitudes in Japan, Korea, the Philippines, New Zealand and the USA, 67.3% reject the use of nuclear weapons under any circumstances. Of the respondents 59.1% said that they would feel safer if nuclear weapons no longer existed in the world. Identified as most needed measures toward nuclear abolition were political and diplomatic negotiations (59.9%), peace education (56.3%) and strengthened measures within the UN framework (53.7%). While 37.4% said that nuclear abolition is possible, 40.7% said that nuclear arms reduction not abolition is possible.&lt;ref&gt;"A Survey on Public Awareness of Nuclear Weapons in Six Countries", published April 28, 2010.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==2011==
What had been growing acceptance of nuclear power in the United States was eroded sharply following the [[2011 Japanese nuclear accidents]], with support for building nuclear power plants in the U.S. dropping slightly lower than it was immediately after the [[Three Mile Island accident]] in 1979, according to a CBS News poll. Only 43 percent of those polled after the Fukushima nuclear emergency said they would approve building new power plants in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/23/us/23poll.html?_r=1 |title=Nuclear Power Loses Support in New Poll |author=Michael Cooper |date=March 22, 2011 |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 poll suggests that skepticism over nuclear power is growing in Sweden following Japan's nuclear crisis. 36 percent of respondents want to phase-out nuclear power, up from 15 percent in a similar survey two years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9M4CAL00.htm |title=Poll shows anti-nuclear sentiment up in Sweden |date=22 March 2011 |work=Businessweek }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, both [[Ipsos Mori]] and the Japanese [[Asahi Shimbun]] newspaper found drops in support for nuclear power technology in most countries, with support continuing in a number including the US. The Ipsos Mori poll found that nuclear had the lowest support of any established technology for generating electricity, with 38%. Coal was at 48% support while [[solar energy]], [[wind power]] and [[Hydropower|hydro]] all found favour with more than 90% of those surveyed.&lt;ref name=rb2011/&gt;

There is little support across the world for building new nuclear reactors, a 2011 poll for the BBC indicates. The global research agency [[GlobeScan]], commissioned by BBC News, polled 23,231 people in 23 countries from July to September 2011, several months after the [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]]. In countries with existing nuclear programmes, people are significantly more opposed than they were in 2005, with only the UK and US bucking the trend. Most believe that boosting energy efficiency and renewable energy can meet their needs.&lt;ref name=rb2011&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15864806 |title=Nuclear power 'gets little public support worldwide' |author=Richard Black  |date=25 November 2011 |work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Just 22% agreed that "nuclear power is relatively safe and an important source of electricity, and we should build more nuclear power plants". In contrast, 71% thought their country "could almost entirely replace coal and nuclear energy within 20 years by becoming highly energy-efficient and focusing on generating energy from the Sun and wind". Globally, 39% want to continue using existing reactors without building new ones, while 30% would like to shut everything down now.&lt;ref name=rb2011/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==2012==
According to a 2012 [[Pew Research Center]] poll, 44 percent of Americans favor and 49 percent oppose the promotion of increased use of nuclear power, while 69 percent favor increasing federal funding for research on wind power, solar power, and hydrogen energy technology.&lt;ref name=pewpoll2012&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.people-press.org/files/legacy-pdf/3-19-12%20Energy%20release.pdf |title=As Gas Prices Pinch, Support for Oil and Gas Production Grows |author=The Pew Research Center For The People and The Press |date=March 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even only one year after the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]], Gallup found that 57 percent of American still favored nuclear energy.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2016/03/21/poll-majority-of-americans-oppose-nuclear-energy-for-the-first-time-infographic/#e4951d453f43|title=Poll: Majority Of Americans Oppose Nuclear Energy For The First Time [Infographic]|last=McCarthy|first=Niall|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-09-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Soka Gakkai|Soka Gakkai International]] released the results of its international survey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Soka Gakkai International|title=Survey on Youth Attitudes toward Nuclear Weapons and Their Humanitarian Consequences|url=http://www.peoplesdecade.org/pdf/npt2013/npt2013_01_text.pdf|accessdate=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which 91.2% of respondents believe that nuclear arms are inhumane and 80.6% favor a comprehensive treaty banning all weapons of mass destruction. The 2,840 survey respondents were men and women of ages 15 to 45 from Australia, Brazil, Britain, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, South Korea and the USA—the official and unofficial nuclear weapon states, states under the US nuclear umbrella and states in [[Nuclear-weapon-free zone|nuclear-weapons-free zones]] (NWFZs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=IDN-InDepthNews|title=Youth Holds Out Hope for Banning Nukes|url=http://www.indepthnews.info/index.php/global-issues/1558-youth-holds-out-hope-for-banning-nukes|accessdate=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2015==
A Pew Research Survey conducted in 2015 found that Americans have shifted their view on the use of the atomic bomb to defeat the Japanese. 
56% believe that the use of nuclear weapons was justified, with 34% saying it was not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Americans, Japanese: Mutual Respect 70 Years After the End of WWII|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/04/07/americans-japanese-mutual-respect-70-years-after-the-end-of-wwii/|website=Pew Research Center|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the bombings that figure was at 84% in favor of the bombing, according to a Gallup poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Majority Supports Use of Atomic Bomb on Japan in WWII|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/17677/majority-supports-use-atomic-bomb-japan-wwii.aspx|website=Gallup|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2016==
A 2016 [[Gallup_(company)|Gallup]] poll of the American public revealed that public support for nuclear energy in the United States was at a record low of 44%, with the majority (54%) of respondents saying that they oppose nuclear energy.

The '''Rama''' are an [[indigenous people]] living on the eastern coast of [[Nicaragua]].  Since the start of European colonization, the Rama population has declined as a result of disease, conflict, and loss of territory.  In recent years, however, the Rama population has increased to around 2,000 individuals. A majority of the population lives on the island of [[Rama Cay]], which is located in the Bluefields Lagoon. Additional small Rama communities are dispersed on the mainland from [[Bluefields]] to [[Greytown, Nicaragua|Greytown]].&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.iwgia.org/images/stories/sections/regions/latin-america/documents/IW2014/NicaraguaIW2014.pdf|title = International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs|date = 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rama are one of three main indigenous groups on Nicaragua’s Caribbean coast.

Due to centuries of colonial suppression the Rama people’s native language is facing extinction. [[Language revitalization]] efforts have been made in recent years and have achieved early success in Rama communities. Rama territory is currently being threatened by the Nicaraguan government and foreign investors, who are seeking to develop a transoceanic canal and to extract resources from the region.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.culturalsurvival.org/news/rama-community-bangkukuk-nicaragua-speaks-out-about-grand-canal-project|title = Cultural Survival|date = January 8, 2015|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rama Communities==
The vast majority of the indigenous Rama population inhabit the island of Rama Cay. Sumu Kaat, Tiktik Kaanu, Wiring Cay, [[Monkey Point]], Bangkukuk Taik, Corn River, Punta Gorda, and Cane Creek are recognized as predominantly Rama communities on the mainland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://vianica.com/go/specials/32-current-indigenous-communities-of-nicaragua.html|title = Current Indigenous Communities of Nicaragua|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Keeping Languages Alive: Documentation, Pedagogy and Revitalization|last = Jones and Ogilvie|first = |publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = 191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Rama are descendants of a combination of indigenous communities that occupied the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua at the time of European contact.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; Following [[Spanish conquest of Nicaragua|Spanish colonization]] of the region, British pirates formed an alliance with the [[Miskito people|Miskito]] in order to wield [[Mosquito Coast#British contact and recognition of the Mosquito Kingdom|indirect control]] of the Caribbean coast. The Miskito assisted the British in pillaging Spanish ships and resisting Spanish control of the region in exchange for guns and other resources that allowed them to exert control over other indigenous groups like the Rama. According to Rama oral tradition, the Miskito gifted the island of Rama Cay to them in the 18th century in recognition of their help in fighting the [[Naso people|Teribe]] people of Costa Rica.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Language Shift and Language Death: the Case of Rama in Nicaragua|last = Craig|first = Colette|authorlink=Colette Grinevald|date = 1992|journal = International Journal of the Sociology of Language|doi = 10.1515/ijsl.1992.93.11|pmid = |access-date =|volume=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries the indigenous peoples of the Caribbean coast came to rely upon private investment and enterprises for socio-economic stability. In adherence to [[socialism|socialist]] policies, the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinista]]-dominated [[Junta of National Reconstruction|Nicaraguan government]] in the 1980s sought to nationalize all private institutions, which resulted in a reduction of private investment on the Caribbean coast.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Many indigenous groups resented the government for its interference in the indigenous economy and regional autonomy. The Rama were one of many indigenous groups to join the [[Contras]], a group of anticommunist guerrillas, some of whom were backed by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], dedicated to fighting the Sandinista regime. As a result of the [[Nicaraguan Revolution]], many Rama were displaced from their homes and traditional lands.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Native Peoples of the World: An Encyclopedia of Groups, Cultures and Contemporary Issues|last = Danver|first = Steven|publisher = Routledge|year = 2015|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to return peace to the Caribbean coast the Nicaraguan government established the [[Constitution of Nicaragua|Constitution of 1987]] and the Autonomy Statue. These government initiatives recognized indigenous existence in Nicaragua, the right of indigenous peoples to determine their own ethnic identity, and the right of indigenous communities to offer intercultural education in their traditional language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.faqs.org/minorities/Appendices/The-Atlantic-Coast-Autonomy-Law-Extracts.html|title = Appendix 2.3 The Atlantic Coast Autonomy Law (Extracts)|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to political conflict in the nation, the regulation terms of the Autonomy Statue were not ratified until 2003. Implementation of the Autonomy Statue continues to remain a challenge, because the national government and regional councils disagree over the level of autonomy the Caribbean communities should possess.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==Lifestyle==
The Rama culture is dependent upon traditional self-sufficient strategies in order to obtain desired substances. While some Rama engage in small-scale commercial fishing, a majority of the population still practices traditional occupations such as subsistence fishing and subsistence farming.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Mutual assistance is an important practice in Rama communities and is relied upon for cultural and economic stability.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.minorityrights.org/2579/nicaragua/indigenous-peoples.html|title = Minority Rights Group International|date = 2008|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual division of labor exists among the Rama, with males responsible for hunting, fishing, and planting, while the females partake in gathering and domestic duties.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sex Roles and Social Change in Native Lower Central American Societies|last = Loveland|first = Christine|publisher = University of Illinois Press|year = 1982|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the arrival of missionaries, the Rama population on Rama Cay reportedly lived in homes lacking exterior and interior walls.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Poor soil conditions in the rainforest do not allow for extensive agriculture, so like other indigenous populations in the region the Rama cultivate small fields along river banks. Crops harvested by the Rama include bananas, [[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]], corn, rice, beans, coconuts, pineapple, breadfruit, and [[Bactris gasipaes|pejibaye]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Indigenous Peoples: Resource Management and Global Rights|last = Jentoft, Minde, and Nilsen|first = |publisher = Eburon Uitgeverij B.V.|year = 2003|isbn = |location = |pages = 219–220}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fishing contributes significantly to the Rama diet, which consists of oysters, [[Cockle (bivalve)|cockles]], freshwater shrimp, coppermouth, and [[Centropomidae|snook]]. Hunting is practiced primarily on the mainland where important game animals such as [[white-lipped peccary]], [[tapir]], and deer can be found.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=Living in the Land of Our Ancestors: Rama Indian and Creole Territory on Nicaragua's Caribbean Coast|last=Riverstone|first=Jerry|date=2004|website=|publisher=ASDI (Swedish Development Agency)|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rama people are commonly known for their skill in crafting [[Dory|dories]] and for their reputation of being the best navigators on the coast.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Religion==
In 1847 German [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] [[missionary|missionaries]] started work in [[Bluefields|Bluefields, Nicaragua]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.oikoumene.org/en/member-churches/moravian-church-in-nicaragua|title = World Council of Churches|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The missionaries worked with the different ethnic groups and became a firmly established colonial institution on the Caribbean coast. The first Moravian mission was established on Rama Cay in 1858 and contributed to the shift away from traditional practices and the use of the Rama language.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The Rama people initially resisted the efforts of the missionaries because the Church's values conflicted with traditional Rama culture; however, as they dissociated from their traditional identity, the Rama became more receptive to outside influences. Today the Rama people predominantly practice in the Moravian Church. Individuals in the southeastern portion of Nicaragua alone make up 96% of the Moravian Church's membership.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Language==
The [[Rama language]] is part of the [[Chibchan language|Chibchan family]] and is considered [[Moribund language|moribund]] since less than 30 elders can still speak the language fluently.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Language Shift and Language Death: the Case of Rama in Nicaragua|last = Craig|first = Colette|publisher = International Journal of the Sociology of Language|year = 1992|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Playing an important role in colonizing the region, the Moravian Church was a major force behind the loss of the Rama Language on Rama Cay. The Church taught English to the natives and influenced the formation of a negative attitude towards traditional speakers, resulting in the reference to Rama as the "Tiger language".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.elpublishing.org/docs/1/03/ldd03_12.pdf|title = Why Rama and not Rama Cay Creole?|date = 2005|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Grinevald|first = Colette}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this animosity, the population that inhabits Rama Cay today speaks a unique version of Rama-Creole which is similar to [[Creole English]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Only two individuals are thought to still speak traditional Rama on the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://oneyearoneworld.com/categories/rama-people-of-nicaragua|title = One Year One World|date = 2014|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rama language had previously been preserved in mainland communities; however, modern developments are threatening the loss of traditional customs and the language.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

In 1985 the Rama Language Program (RLP) was launched in response to requests to "save the Rama language".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.academia.edu/5387106/The_Revitalization_of_a_Treasure_Language_the_Rama_Language_Project_of_Nicaragua|title = The Revitalization of a ‘Treasure Language’: the Rama Language Project of Nicaragua|date = 2013|accessdate = |website = |publisher = Cambridge University Press|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial efforts to locate and communicate with native speakers proved challenging for linguists because the inhabitants of Rama Cay still rejected any use of the Rama language. In recent years language revitalization efforts have achieved some success, as the Rama people move increasingly to associate their traditional language with their identity. This movement by the indigenous Rama to reclaim their language has led many speakers to label the language as "rescued".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Language Documentation: Practice and values|last = Grenoble and Furbee|first = |publisher = John Benjamins Publishing|year = 2010|isbn = |location = |pages = 259–260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status==
Nicaragua is one of the poorest nations in the Western Hemisphere, and Nicaragua's Caribbean coast suffers from an exceptional amount of economic underdevelopment and poverty.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Rama who reside in urban areas such as Bluefields suffer from discrimination and unemployment due to their ethnic identity.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://idbdocs.iadb.org/wsdocs/getdocument.aspx?docnum=1441477|title = Poverty among the Indigenous Peoples of Nicaragua|date = 1999|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Jamieson|first = Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unemployment levels are especially high for women and youth in this Caribbean coast region.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
===Land Rights===
The Rama people currently occupy the [[Región Autónoma de la Costa Caribe Sur|South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region]] (RACCS). Both this region and the [[Región Autónoma de la Costa Caribe Norte|North Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region]] (RACCN) were established with the 1987 Constitution and Autonomy law.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These Statues recognize collective forms of indigenous land ownership and establish terms for natural resource management. Implementation of indigenous autonomy has proved to be difficult due to internecine conflict and lack of government support. The RACCN and RACCS make up approximately half of the nation's landmass, while Caribbean coast inhabitants make up only ten percent of the nation's population.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.minorityrights.org/download.php@id=105|title = From Conflict to Autonomy in Nicaragua: Lessons Learnt|date = |accessdate = |website = minority rights group international|publisher = |last = Brunnegger|first = Sandra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social disruption resulting from the [[Nicaraguan Revolution|civil war]] in the 1980s has advanced colonization along Nicaragua's agricultural frontier.&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://conservation.law.ufl.edu/pdf/rama/rama_complete.pdf|title = Defending Rama Indian Community Lands and the Southeastern Nicaragua Biosphere Reserve|date = 2001|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former combantants and [[mestizo]] families displaced by the war are migrating east to renew their former lives and engage in subsistence farming. Due to the poor quality of rainforest soil and increasing social unrest on the Pacific coast, more individuals move east each year and come into contact with indigenous communities. Much of central and eastern Nicaragua is protected [[rainforest]], yet the government lacks the resources to halt the extensive environment destruction associated with the recent migrations. The advancing agricultural frontier is responsible for large amounts of deforestation and ecological devastation in the region.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;

====Interoceanic Canal====
The Nicaraguan government has long sought out investors to finance the building of a Nicaraguan interoceanic canal. The Chinese company Hong Kong Nicaragua Canal Development Investment Co Ltd ([[HKND]]) was contracted in 2013 to build the canal for the cost of $40–$50 billion.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.iwgia.org/images/stories/sections/regions/latin-america/documents/IW2014/NicaraguaIW2014.pdf|title = International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs|date = 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://cuslar.org/2014/10/31/nicaraguas-proposed-interoceanic-canal-a-threat-to-the-environment-and-indigenous-peoples/|title = NICARAGUA’S PROPOSED INTEROCEANIC CANAL: A THREAT TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND INDIGENOUS PEOPLES|date = October 31, 2014|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Investors and the Nicaraguan government hope that the new canal will rival the [[Panama Canal]] and will be able to accommodate larger size ships and the growing demand for inter-ocean passage. The canal is expected to run from Punta Gordon on the Caribbean coast to Brito on the Pacific coast, traveling through [[Lake Nicaragua]].&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://conservation.law.ufl.edu/pdf/rama/rama_complete.pdf|title = Defending Rama Indian Community Lands and the Southeastern Nicaragua Biosphere Reserve|date = 2001|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Construction for the canal began in December 2014 and the project is expected to be completed by 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nicaragua-constructs-enormous-canal-blind-to-its-environmental-cost/|title = Nicaragua Constructs Enormous Canal, Blind to its Environmental Cost|date = February 11, 2015|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous populations are protesting the building of this canal on the grounds that they were not consulted prior to a contract being negotiated with HKND by the Nicaraguan government. Construction of the canal would require the relocation of 80% of the indigenous Rama population and would destroy traditional communal life for many other indigenous communities.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; International groups are protesting construction of the canal because they fear the environmental impact that the project will have on Nicaragua's endangered species and delicate ecosystem.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://cuslar.org/2014/10/31/nicaraguas-proposed-interoceanic-canal-a-threat-to-the-environment-and-indigenous-peoples/|title = NICARAGUA’S PROPOSED INTEROCEANIC CANAL: A THREAT TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND INDIGENOUS PEOPLES|date = October 31, 2014|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite controversy surrounding the project, the Nicaraguan government is going ahead with the canal's construction, hoping the infrastructure and revenue that the canal brings in will lift the nation out of poverty.

'''''Rhodie''''' is a [[colloquial]] term typically applied to a [[Whites in Zimbabwe|white Zimbabwean]] or expatriate [[Rhodesia]]n.

==Origins of the term==

The term ''Rhodie'' was first used by British Army and civil service personnel in [[Rhodesia]] (renamed Zimbabwe in 1980) during the period between the [[Lancaster House Agreement]] of December 1979 and the formal independence of Zimbabwe in April 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hoggart|first=Simon|title=Ironing the lawn in Salisbury, Rhodesia|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/1980/feb/09/zimbabwe.simonhoggart|accessdate=9 August 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=9 February 1980|quote=Even the British squaddies look with faint contempt on the Rhodesians (or 'Rhodies' as they sometimes call them; military slang mushrooms overnight).}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was initially applied to all [[white people in Zimbabwe|white Zimbabweans]]. After independence, the term began to be applied increasingly to those whites who were nostalgic for the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Unendoro|first=Benedict|title=ZIMBABWE: Poor whites hit hard times|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220214515/http://www.theshebeen.org/governance-democracy/85-zimbabwe-poor-whites-hit-hard-times.html|publisher=The Shebeen|date=16 August 2007|url=http://www.theshebeen.org/governance-democracy/85-zimbabwe-poor-whites-hit-hard-times.html|archivedate=20 February 2008|accessdate=9 August 2013|newspaper=[[Institute for War and Peace Reporting|IWPR]]|quote='Rhodies' – as whites who long for the old pre-Zimbabwe days of white-ruled Rhodesia are known – called such white people '******boeties' [****** lovers] and despised them.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nostalgia a ''Rhodie'' feels relates particularly to the [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|UDI]] era (1965 to 1979), during which the predominantly white government, headed by the Prime Minister [[Ian Smith]], declared independence from Britain in an attempt to prevent any commitment to a set timetable regarding black majority rule. The UDI project ended in the [[Rhodesian Bush War|Bush War]] of the 1970s, fought between the [[Rhodesian Security Forces]] and the communist-backed black nationalist insurgents of the [[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army]] (ZANLA) and the [[Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army]] (ZIPRA).&lt;ref name=Longworth&gt;{{cite news|last=Longworth|first=Peter|title=Dark hearts|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/sep/11/featuresreviews.guardianreview4|accessdate=9 August 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=11 September 2004|quote=For the leftovers of Ian Smith's killing machine who people Fuller's new book, the past is all there is. Yesterday's world had rules of engagement. Remaindered from the Rhodesian war, all they have now is their ghosts inadequately repressed by extreme religion, alcohol, purple pills or a penchant for tearing down bars. Don't believe these guys don't exist. Spot them at the end of a Harare Rhodie bar or even worse stumbling towards you across the terrace of a bush hotel and it's time to grab the bill.}} Review: ''Scribbling the Cat'' by [[Alexandra Fuller]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current usage of the term==

===Implications of racism and violence===
Usage of the term ''Rhodie'' changed further in post-independence Zimbabwe. It began to be applied to a white Zimbabwean of a particular kind. An image published in ''[[The Sunday Times Magazine]]'' in 1984 showed a poster near Harare reading "Private Party Invitation Only No Drugs No Rhodies No Racists No Troublemakers Allowed on These Premises".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Godwin|first=Peter|title=Whose Kith and Kin Now?|url=http://www.maryellenmark.com/text/magazines/london_sunday_times/904G-000-005.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040805050335/http://www.maryellenmark.com/text/magazines/london_sunday_times/904G-000-005.html|archivedate=5 August 2004|newspaper=The Sunday Times Magazine|date=25 March 1984|accessdate=9 August 2013|quote=When Prince Charles visits Zimbabwe this weekend he will find a nation still divided four years after independence. But now the divisions run deepest within the dwindling white community between young permissive trendies and fervent 'born-again' evangelists, between those who prefer to be African rather than European and those who can't wait for a stamp on their emigration applications.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rhodie bar====
{{main|Rhodie bar}}
A Rhodie bar is an establishment frequented by ''Rhodies'' and is often decorated with memorabilia of the UDI era and the [[Rhodesian Bush War]].&lt;ref name=Longworth/&gt; Such establishments, in pubs, restaurants and hotels, can be found in most Zimbabwean towns and there are several in [[South Africa]]n towns such as [[Cape Town]] where concentrations of Rhodesian expatriates live. There is at least one claimed Rhodie bar in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to The Crown Hotel|url=http://www.crown-hotel.info/the-crown-hotel.html|accessdate=9 August 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323220549/http://www.crown-hotel.info/index.html|archivedate=23 March 2007|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implications of lower-class===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
The term ''Rhodie'' can also carry social connotations. During the period after independence, about two thirds of Zimbabwe's white population left the country. Those remaining tended to fall into two distinct categories. Firstly, there were individuals of high social status possessing professional skills and property which would enable them to survive in the new order. Secondly, there were individuals of low social status lacking the skills or qualities needed to emigrate.

===Use as endearment===
Expatriate Rhodesians outside Zimbabwe often describe each other affectionately as ''Rhodies''. These people do not generally exhibit the characteristics indicated above. 

===Short for Rhodesian Ridgeback===
Used among dog owners for the [[Rhodesian Ridgeback]] [[dog breed]].

===Use as a nickname===
Short for the surname Rhoden, Rhodes, and Rhode. Used as a term of endearment without racial implications.

===Contrary term Zimbo===
The term ''Zimbo'' is nowadays applied to anyone Zimbabwean.

The [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Tony Abbott]] announced the Royal Commission on 10 February 2014 and nominated that the Commission be overseen by a sole [[Commissioner|Royal Commissioner]], [[The Honourable]] [[Dyson Heydon]], {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AC|QC}}, a former [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] [[judge]]. [[Letters Patent]] were issued on 13 March 2014.

Following an extension, the Commissioner presented his final report to the Governor-General in December 2015, finding "widespread and deep-seated" misconduct by union officials in Australia. More than 40 people and organisations were referred to authorities, including police, Directors of Public Prosecutions, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Fair Work Commission, and a recommendation for the establishment of an independent body to investigate union records and finances was made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-30/trade-union-royal-commission-turnbull-report/7060250 |title=Trade union royal commission findings: Malcolm Turnbull says report shows widespread malpractice in unions |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |location=Australia |date=30 December 2015 |accessdate= |author=Keany, Francis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment of the Commission==

===Background===
{{main|AWU affair|Health Services Union expenses affair}}

In 2013 the [[Fair Work Commission]] commenced initial inquiries into allegations of improper union financial conduct, and the Opposition Liberal-National Coalition promised a judicial inquiry into the [[AWU affair]], which involved allegations of misappropriation of funds by officials of the Australian Workers Union. [[Craig Thomson (politician)|Craig Thomson]], a Federal Labor MP, and [[Michael Williamson (Australian unionist)|Michael Williamson]], a former President of the Labor Party, were facing [[Health Services Union expenses affair|fraud allegations]] in relation to their financial dealings as officials of the [[Health Services Union]] (both men were later convicted of fraud).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-04-04/labor-party-expels-michael-williamson-and-craig-thomson/5368574 |title=Former HSU officials Michael Williamson and Craig Thomson expelled from Labor Party |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |location=Australia |date=4 April 2014 |accessdate= |author= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, the Fairfax press reported that the newly elected Abbott Government would call a Royal Commission into trade union slush funds, "less than a fortnight after a Fairfax Media investigation uncovered millions of dollars in a string of secret union slush funds. The series of Fairfax reports revealed the involvement of the NSW Right’s powerful Transport Workers Union in a $500,000 takeover of its own Queensland branch with the backing of the disgraced former HSU leader Michael Williamson. It also reported the possible unlawful misuse of union and parliamentary staff by senior union officials and Labor figures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/abbott-government-to-launch-royal-commission-into-union-slush-funds-20131211-2z76h.html#ixzz3j8aXrt4w |title=Abbott government to launch royal commission into union 'slush funds' |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=12 December 2013 |accessdate= |author= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Letters Patent===

The Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption was established on 13 March 2014 by the former Governor-General, Dame Quentin Bryce. The Governor-General issued Letters Patent which formally appointed the Royal Commissioner, John Dyson Heydon, and outlined the Terms of Reference for the inquiry.&lt;ref name=turc-home&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tradeunionroyalcommission.gov.au/Pages/default.aspx |publisher=Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption |title=Homepage |accessdate=18 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Letters Patent&lt;ref name=turc-let-pat /&gt; called for an investigation and recommendations with particular regard for the financial management of relevant entities and the adequacy of existing laws relating to the financial management of those entities and the accountability of their officers. It was also to investigate whether relevant entities are used for unlawful purpose; as well as the use of funds solicited in the name relevant entities.&lt;ref name=turc-let-pat/&gt; The [[Australian Workers Union]]; [[Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union]]; [[Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union of Australia|Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia]]; the [[Health Services Union]]; and the [[Transport Workers Union of Australia|Transport Workers Union]] were nominated for investigation, but the Letters Patent permitted other entities facing "credible allegations" to be investigated.&lt;ref name=turc-let-pat&gt;{{cite web |title=Letters Patent |url=http://www.tradeunionroyalcommission.gov.au/About/Documents/Signedandscanned-140314%20-%20Letters%20Patent%20-%20Royal%20Commission.pdf |publisher=Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption |accessdate=21 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 October 2014, Governor-General Cosgrove amended the Letters Patent to include an additional term of reference, and the reporting date was revised from 31 December 2014 to 31 December 2015.&lt;ref name=turc-let-pat/&gt; Dyson Heydon told the Royal Commission in April, 2015, that "A reading of the Interim Report will reveal that the progress of the Commission's investigations in 2014 was impeded by false testimony, delays in document production, document destruction or removal and reluctance to cooperate even on the part of persons hostile to alleged misconduct" and said that some witnesses feared for their safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-04-23/royal-commission-into-trade-unions-impeded-by-lies-commissioner/6415616 |title=Royal Commission into trade unions impeded by lies and destroyed documents, commissioner says |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |location=Australia |date=23 April 2015 |accessdate= |author= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commissioner Heydon===

Justice [[Dyson Heydon]] {{post-nominals|country=AUS|sep=,|AC|QC}} served as a judge of the NSW Court of Appeal from 2000, and was appointed as a judge of the [[High Court of Australia]] in February 2003. He was appointed a Companion in the General Division of the Order of Australia in 2004. Justice Heydon is a former [[Rhodes Scholar]], and holds a [[Master of Arts]] and [[Bachelor of Civil Law]] from [[Oxford University]]. He was admitted to the New South Wales Bar in 1973 and appointed [[Queen's Counsel]] in 1987. Aged 34, he was elected dean of the University of Sydney Law School and practised at the Bar from 1979 until his appointment to the Court of Appeal. Heydon has written a number of legal texts, including [[Cross on Evidence]] and The Restraint of Trade Doctrine (1971).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tradeunionroyalcommission.gov.au/About/Pages/TheCommissioner.aspx |title=The Commissioner |publisher=Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption |date= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bill Shorten appearance====

In July 2015, Opposition Leader [[Bill Shorten]] of the Australian Labor Party, a former official of the AWU, was called to give evidence at the Royal Commission. Over two days of questioning, Counsel Assisting asked Shorten several times if he had had a conflict of interest in accepting, and not disclosing, large donations from employers while negotiating for the union on behalf of employees.&lt;ref name=abc-shrtn-rej/&gt; Shorten said there was no conflict of interest.&lt;ref name=abc-shrtn-rej/&gt; Shorten admitted to the commission that he had failed to declare a political donation of around $40,000 from a labour hire company in the lead up to the 2007 election campaign, and that invoices regarding the payments for services were not truthful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/bill-shorten-failed-to-disclose-40000-donation-from-labour-hire-company-unibilt-to-his-2007-election-campaign-20150707-gi7elj.html |title=Bill Shorten failed to disclose $40,000 donation from labour hire company Unibilt to his 2007 election campaign |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=8 July 2015 |accessdate= |author1=Patty, Anna |author2=Millar, Royce |author3=Massola, James }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shorten denied knowledge of alleged false invoicing, totalling more than $300,000, which had been sent to construction company Thiess John Holland.&lt;ref name=sky-bogus/&gt;

During cross examination, Counsel Assisting said that Shorten was being "evasive".&lt;ref name=sky-bogus/&gt; Heydon intervened to tell Shorten that some of his answers were "non-responsive", adding "If I can be frank about it, you have been criticised in the newspapers in the last few weeks and I think it’s generally believed that you have come here in the hope you will be able to rebut that criticism or a lot of it. I’m not very troubled about that, though I can understand that you are, and it’s legitimate for you to use this occasion to achieve your ends in that regard. What I’m concerned about more is your credibility as a witness … and perhaps your self-interest as a witness as well.

====Recusal application====

In August 2015, the Labor Party, Greens and affiliated unions criticised Dyson Heydon for receiving an invitation to deliver a law lecture at an $80 a head Liberal Party fundraiser organised by a group of Liberal affiliated lawyers. Heydon had initially given conditional agreement to speak at the forum if his duties as commissioner were completed, but later decided not to make the address. The Labor Party condemned the Commission as "political", called the event a "Liberal fundraiser" and attacked the Royal Commissioner in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skynews.com.au/news/politics/national/2015/08/13/labor-seeks-to-censure-abbott-over-heydon.html |title=Labor seeks to censure Abbott over Heydon |work=Sky News |location=Australia |date=13 August 2015 |accessdate= |author= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 August, it was reported that Heydon had said in a June 2013 panel discussion at the [[Centre for Independent Studies]] that Kevin Rudd's government had a tendency to "do non-substantive things".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/dyson-heydon-slammed-rudd-government-as-nonsubstantive-in-2013-speech-20150819-gj2d2g.html|title=Dyson Heydon slammed Rudd, Gillard governments as 'non-substantive' in 2013 speech|date=19 August 2015 |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |accessdate= |author=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Labor Minister Graham Richardson wrote in ''[[The Australian]]'' that the comments were "partisan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |quote=The attacks made by Heydon on the Gillard and Rudd administrations in a speech delivered two years ago were harsh and hard.

"In this case, Mr John Dyson Heydon AC QC is a highly regarded former judicial officer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/dyson-heydon-law-council-slams-attacks-on-former-high-court-judge/story-e6frg6n6-1227489169426 |title=Dyson Heydon: Law Council slams attacks on former high court judge |work=[[The Australian]] |date=19 August 2015 |accessdate= |author= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 and 21 August 2015, counsels for the ACTU, CEPU, HSU, TWU, Unions NSW, the Maritime Union of Australia, the Australian Workers’ Union, the CFMEU and individual members of the CFMEU presented the Royal Commission with applications for disqualification  of Commissioner Heydon on  the  ground  of  "apprehended  bias". These applications contended that an agreement made in April 2014 by Heydon to deliver in August 2015 the Sixth Annual Sir Garfield Barwick Address (an event organised by the Lawyers Branch and the Legal Policy Branch of the NSW Division of the Liberal Party), "might cause a fair-minded lay observer reasonably to apprehend that [Dyson Heydon] might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of questions to be examined in the course of the Commission’s inquiries." On 31 August, Heydon concluded, that it is "not the case that a fair-minded lay observer might apprehend that I might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the questions which the work of the Commission requires to be decided" and the work of the Commission continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tradeunionroyalcommission.gov.au/Hearings/Documents/2015/Evidence31August2015/ReasonsforRulingonDisqualificationApplicationdated31August2015.pdf |title=Reasons for Ruling on Disqualification Application |publisher=Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption |date= |accessdate=2 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, Justice Heydon had initially given conditional agreement to speak at the law lecture provided the Commission had completed its inquiries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://media.crikey.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/heydon1.png |title=Email to Justice Heydon |work=[[Crikey]] |author=Burton, Gregory |date=10 April 2014 |accessdate=13 March 2016 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Heydon confirmed his availability to give the address, and on 12 June 2015, with attachments declaring the event a Liberal Party fundraiser. Heydon stated that he did not read the attachments. It was later agreed that the Liberal Party would not be mentioned on advertisements in public Bar Association publications. On 13 August, journalists obtained flyers for the event, announcing that it was a Liberal Party fundraiser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://media.crikey.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/heydon2.png |title=Email to Justice Heydon |work=[[Crikey]] |author=Burton, Gregory |date=12 June 2015 |accessdate=13 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128143404/https://media.crikey.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/heydon2.png |archivedate=28 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anna Patty"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/royal-commissioner-dyson-heydon-claims-he-overlooked-connection-to-liberal-party-in-fundraiser-emails-20150817-gj0nri.html|title=Royal commissioner Dyson Heydon claims he 'overlooked' connection to Liberal Party|author=Patty, Anna |date=17 August 2015|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heydon withdrew from the speech on the day that the media obtained Liberal Party flyers describing the event as a fundraiser.

===Powers===
{{main|Royal Commissions Act 1902}}

The powers of Royal Commissions in Australia are set out in the enabling legislation, the {{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|rca1902224|Royal Commissions Act 1902}}. Royal Commissions, appointed pursuant to the ''Royal Commissions Act'' or otherwise, have powers to issue a [[summons]] to a person to appear before the Commission at a hearing to give evidence or to [[Subpoena|produce documents specified]] in the summons; require witnesses to take an oath or give an affirmation; and require a person to deliver documents to the Commission at a specified place and time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/rca1902224/s2.html |title=ROYAL COMMISSIONS ACT 1902 - SECT 2 Power to summon witnesses and take evidence |publisher=Austlii.edu.au |date= |accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person served with a summons or a notice to produce documents must comply with that requirement, or face prosecution for an offence. The penalty for conviction upon such an offence is a fine of {{AUD}}{{formatnum:1000}} or six months imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/rca1902224/s3.html |title=ROYAL COMMISSIONS ACT 1902 - SECT 3 Failure of witnesses to attend or produce documents |publisher=Austlii.edu.au |date= |accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Royal Commission may authorise the [[Australian Federal Police]] to execute [[search warrant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/rca1902224/s4.html |title=ROYAL COMMISSIONS ACT 1902 - SECT 4 Search warrants |publisher=Austlii.edu.au |date= |accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedures and methods==

===Hearings===

Commissioner Heydon heard opening statements at the Royal Commission on 7 July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-08-17/commissioner-dyson-heydon-trade-union-royal-commission/6702454 |title=Commissioner Dyson Heydon hears opening statements at the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |location=Australia |date=17 August 2015 |accessdate= |author= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By year's end, the Trade Union Royal Commission held more than 70 public and private hearings, which involved 239 witnesses. The hearings were conducted in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and Brisbane. 687 Notices to Produce and releasing Issues Papers on governance and protections were issued. The Royal Commission continues its Public Hearings in 2015.&lt;ref name=turc-home/&gt;

==Reports==

; Interim Report

Commissioner Heydon handed his Interim Report&lt;ref name=interim-rpt /&gt; to Governor General Sir [[Peter Cosgrove]] on 15 December, and it was tabled in Parliament on 19 December 2014.&lt;ref name=turc-home/&gt; Commissioner Heydon's 1817 page Report found that the Construction Union acts in "wilful defiance of the law", and he recommended criminal charges of blackmail be considered against John Setka, the state secretary of the [[Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union]] (CFMEU), along with his assistant Shaun Reardon and a number of other senior CFMEU officials. Activities cited by CFMEU officials included death threats, extortion, gross neglect, and other "serious criminal matters".&lt;ref name="theage.com.au"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/royal-commission-takes-aim-at-cfmeu-recommends-charges-against-senior-officials-20141219-12awyp.html#ixzz3j8VQUH4s |title=Royal commission takes aim at CFMEU, recommends charges against senior officials |work=[[The Age]] |date=19 December 2014 |accessdate= |author= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon release of the Interim Report, ''[[The Age]]'' reported that: "Justice Heydon identified key concerns about the use and operation of union election slush funds. They include that they operate largely in secret, have deficient or non-existent record-keeping and that candidates commonly plead ignorance on how money is raised and spent. The report also recommended fraud charges be considered against former Australian Workers Union officials Bruce Wilson and Ralph Blewitt for their [[AWU affair|use of a secret slush fund]] in the 1990s. Mr Wilson was the ex-boyfriend of former prime minister Julia Gillard. Justice Heydon said there were no grounds for prosecuting Ms Gillard, but agreed with counsel assisting Jeremy Stoljar's submission, that her conduct as a solicitor had been "questionable". Ms Gillard had done legal work setting up the slush fund for Mr Wilson and Mr Blewitt. The report recommended seven past and present Health Services Union officials should be considered for charges for their role in an alleged right of entry scam... .&lt;ref name="theage.com.au"/&gt;

==Results of hearings and recommendations==

In August 2015, ''The Australian'' reported that 30 individuals had been referred to 11 agencies for possible charges, and that 11 people had been referred to Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) and ten people to state DPPs. Four arrests had already been made by police, and allegations of illegality against nine unions had been uncovered, with over 50 potential breaches of criminal and civil law identified.&lt;ref name="Here p.1, 19"/&gt;

Following July/August 2015 hearings in Canberra, it was reported that the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]] (ACCC) began investigating allegations emerging from the Royal Commission that union actions resulted in [[price fixing]] in the concrete and formwork trades. The media reported that "Allegations of intimidation, blackmail, standover tactics and threats" were uncovered and two arrests of union officials for alleged blackmail offences were made following their testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-08-01/review-trade-union-royal-commission-in-canberra/6662842 |title=What happened inside the trade union royal commission hearings in Canberra |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |location=Australia |date=1 August 2015 |accessdate= |author= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 2016, only one conviction has been attained, while five other union officials have either had their charges dropped, or were found not guilty.&lt;ref name="dropped"/&gt;

===Final Report===

Commissioner Heydon found that corruption was widespread and deepseated, and recommended a new national regulator with the same powers as the [[Australian Securities and Investments Commission]] be established  to combat corruption in the trade union movement. The Report highlighted insufficient record keeping (including false invoicing and destruction of documents);  "rubber stamp" committees which failed to enforce rules; payment of large sums by employers to unions; and influence peddling by means of the inflation of union membership figures. The Report recommended a toughening of financial disclosure rules, new civil penalties to bind workers and officials on financial disclosure provisions; a new criminal offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/dec/30/trade-union-royal-commission-recommends-new-body-curb-corruption |date=30 December 2015 |work=The Guardian |location=Australia |title=Final trade union royal commission report condemns 'louts, thugs, bullies, thieves' |accessdate=12 March 2016 |author=Medhora, Shalailah }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Frank Bongiorno, Professor of History at the [[Australian National University]], has described this report as having "all the impact of last year’s telephone book being dumped in a wheelie-bin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bongiorno|first1=Frank|title=Mis-red: why Bill Shorten is not a socialist|url=https://theconversation.com/mis-red-why-bill-shorten-is-not-a-socialist-91752|accessdate=7 March 2018|work=[[The Conversation Australia]]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rusi P. Taleyarkhan''' is a faculty member in the Department of Nuclear Engineering at [[Purdue University]] since 2003. Prior to that, he was on staff at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory|Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)]] in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]]. He obtained his [[Bachelor of Technology]] degree in [[Mechanical Engineering]] from the [[Indian Institute of Technology, Madras]] in 1977 and [[Master of Science|MS]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] (Nuclear Engineering and Science) degrees from [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute|Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI)]] in 1978 and 1982 respectively. He also holds an [[MBA|MBA (Business Administration)]] from RPI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was judged guilty of [[research misconduct]] for "falsification of the research record" by a Purdue review board in July, 2008.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-sci-misconduct19-2008jul19,0,1765099.story Purdue physicist found guilty of misconduct], Los Angeles Times, July 19, 2008, Thomas H.

== Sonofusion work and controversy ==

Microphone 7. Photomultiplier tube 8. Two deuterium atoms collide 8a. Possible fusion event creating Helium and a neutron 8b. Possible fusion event creating Tritium and a proton]]In 2002, while a senior scientist at ORNL, Taleyarkhan published a paper on fusion achieved by bombarding a container of liquid solvent with strong [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] vibrations, a process known as sonofusion or [[bubble fusion]]. In theory, the vibrations collapsed gas bubbles in the solvent, heating them to temperatures high enough to fuse hydrogen atoms and release energy. Following his move from Oak Ridge to Purdue in 2003, Taleyarkhan published additional papers about his research in this area.

Numerous other scientists, however, were not able to replicate Taleyarkhan's work, including in published articles in ''Physical Review Letters'' from the [[University of Göttingen]], from [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], from [[University of Illinois system|University of Illinois]], from former colleagues at Oak Ridge National Labs, and a study funded by the [[Office of Naval Research]] in the [[University of California]].&lt;ref name=reich /&gt;

Taleyarkhan's results were reportedly repeated by Edward Forringer of [[LeTourneau University]] in Taleyarkhan's own labs at Purdue in November 2006.&lt;ref name="Transactions-ANS=2006"&gt;{{cite journal

The ''Chronicle of Higher Education'', however, has noted some problems with the verification. "During this time, Dr. Taleyarkhan says, two more scientists came into his laboratory and independently verified bubble fusion. Dr. Taleyarkhan contends that both were experts and did their work independently of him. But in interviews, both researchers contradict aspects of that account. One of those scientists, Edward R. Forringer, a professor of physics at LeTourneau University, in Texas, says he is certainly not an expert. Nonetheless, he says he is confident that his results do support the reality of bubble fusion."&lt;ref name="Vance"&gt;{{cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Forringer, however, did not publish his purported confirmation in any refereed journal.

On May 10, 2007, Purdue announced that they would add at least one scientist without ties to the university to a new inquiry of Taleyarkhan and his work, at the insistence of a [[United States Congress|Congressional]] panel investigating the use of federal funds in attempts to reproduce Taleyarkhan's results. The panel cited concerns that Taleyarkhan's claims of independent verification were "highly doubtful", and criticized Purdue for using three of the same members of an earlier inquiry committee in their recently completed review. Taleyarkhan called the report a "one-sided, grossly exaggerated write-up" but agreed to cooperate.&lt;ref name="Callahan"&gt;{{cite news

'''Sawi''', '''Savi''', or '''Sauji''',&lt;ref&gt;''Sauji'' is the [[endonym]] reported in {{harvtxt|Liljegren|2009|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an endangered{{sfn|Bashir|2016b|pp=640–41}} [[Indo-Aryan language]] of northeastern [[Afghanistan]]. It is classified as a member of the [[Shina language|Shina]] language cluster within the [[Dardic languages|Dardic]] subgroup.

It is spoken in the village of [[Sau, Kunar|Sau]], on the east bank of the [[Kunar River]], around {{convert|20|km}} south of the town of [[Arandu, Pakistan|Arandu]], which is on the border with Pakistan's [[Chitral region]].{{sfn|Liljegren|2009|p=10}}
Sawi speakers consider themselves part of the Gawar ethnic group, which is found in half a dozen of the surrounding villages and whose language is [[Gawarbati language|Gawarbati]]. In communicating with them, the people of Sau reportedly resort to using [[Pashto]].{{sfn|Cacopardo|Cacopardo|2001|pp=96, 231–32}}
During the long period of unrest, the population of the village was displaced into refugee camps in Chitral and [[Dir, Pakistan|Dir]], but reportedly many people have now returned to Afghanistan.{{sfn|Liljegren|2009|p=10}}

== History ==
The closest relative of the Sawi language is the southern variety of [[Palula]] spoken in [[Ashret]] further up the Kunar Valley in Chitral. Many Sawi speakers are aware of the similarity between the two languages, and some consider the people of Ashret as their "brothers".{{sfn|Liljegren|2009|pp=11, 55}} Henrik Liljegren's study of the shared linguistic features and the local oral traditions suggest that the ancestors of these language communities are likely to have migrated from the present-day [[Diamer District]] on the Indus River. There was probably an early split between Northern and Southern Palula, with Sawi subsequently branching off from the latter.{{sfn|Liljegren|2009|ps =; see particularly pp. 54–58}} The current similarity between the two varieties of Palula is then explained as a result of convergence.

== Grammar ==
The presence of weak voiced aspirates (bh, dh, gh) was cautiously reported by Buddruss in 1967,{{sfn|Buddruss|1967|p=22}} but {{harvtxt|Liljegren|2009|p=31}} found them to be absent from the speech of his consultant(s). It is likely that the loss of aspiration in the ancestor language could have been related to the development of a tone system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Liljegren|2009|pp=34–35, 41}}. Cf. the analysis of Kolkati in {{harvnb|Liljegren|2013|pp=143–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Possibly under the influence of Gawarbati,{{sfn|Liljegren|2009|pp=40–41}} Sawi has developed a [[voiceless lateral fricative]] ''{{IPA|ɬ}}'' out of the ''*tr'' consonant clusters of the earlier language, compare for example Sawi ''ɬo'' with Southern Palula ''tróo'' 'three'.{{sfn|Liljegren|2009|pp=34, 36}}

Unlike the main Shina varieties, where the past and present [[Grammatical tense|tense]] are typically marked for [[Grammatical person|person]], Sawi and Palula verb tenses are almost entirely [[participle]]-based, with only traces of [[Grammatical agreement|agreement]] for person.{{sfn|Liljegren|2013|p=153}}
Like [[Torwali language|Torwali]], Sawi has [[grammaticalise]]d the category of [[Animacy (linguistics)|animacy]] in its [[Nominal (linguistics)|nominal]] morphology.{{sfn|Bashir|2016a|at = p. 266, n. 33. This contrasts for example with [[Kalasha language|Kalasha]], [[Khowar]], [[Shumashti]] and [[Pashai]] where animacy has been grammaticalised in the ''verbal'' morphology.}}
The [[Agent (grammar)|agent]] suffix is ''-e'' for [[perfective]] transitive verbs. Unlike the main Shina varieties, Sawi does not seem to possess an agent suffix for imperfective transitive verbs.{{sfn|Schmidt|Kaul|2008|p=249}}

'''Social manias''' are mass movements which periodically sweep through [[society|societies]]. They are characterized by an outpouring of [[enthusiasm]], mass involvement and [[Millenarianism|millenarian]] goals.  Social manias are contagious social [[epidemic]]s, and as such they should be differentiated from [[mania|mania in individuals]].

Social manias come in different sizes and strengths.  Some social manias fail to 'catch fire', while others persist for hundreds of years (although sometimes in severely attenuated form). Common to all is a vision of [[salvation]], a new way of life, which if realized would radically change everyday life, ushering in a new world of freedom and justice.

==Examples==
The [[Taiping Rebellion]] is an excellent illustration, as it was both widespread and destructive and has no modern adherents to whom its use as an example would be a distraction. The [[Ghost dance]] which was briefly embraced by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] of the Great Plains in 1890 is another excellent example which may be viewed in some historical perspective, as may [[The Crusades]]. Almost any form of [[religion]] could be argued to be a long-standing social mania, many of which have persisted through thousands of years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18239">[[File:Sénégal-Télécentre.jpg|thumb|Telecentre building in [[Senegal]]]]
A '''telecentre''' is a public place where people can access computers, the Internet, and other digital technologies that enable them to gather information, create, learn, and communicate with others while they develop essential digital skills. Telecentres exist in almost every country, although they sometimes go by a different names including public internet access center (PIAP), village knowledge center, infocenter, '''community technology center''' ('''CTC'''), community multimedia center (CMC), multipurpose community telecentre (MCT), Common/Citizen Service Centre (CSC) and school-based telecentre. While each telecentre is different, their common focus is on the use of digital technologies to support community, economic, educational, and social development—reducing isolation, bridging the [[digital divide]], promoting health issues, creating economic opportunities, and reaching out to youth for example.&lt;ref name=ENRAP&gt;ENRAP. (June, 2000).

==Evolution of the telecentre movement==
[[File:Global Teenager Project Zambia.jpg|thumb|African children in a telecentre in [[Zambia]]]]
The telecentre movement’s origins can be traced to Europe's [[telecottage]] and Electronic Village Halls (originally in Denmark) and [[Community technology center|Community Technology Centers]] (CTCs) in the United States, both of which emerged in the 1980s as a result of advances in computing. At a time when computers were available but not yet a common household good, public access to computers emerged as a solution.&lt;ref name=UN&gt;UN. (2000, November). [http://www.unoosa.org/pdf/reports/ac105/AC105_748E.pdf Report on the United Nations / Malaysia Workshop on Bridging the Digital Divide: Space Technology Solutions.” Conference 20 -24] PLANWEL citation retrieved November 2000. Page 09 item 41&lt;/ref&gt; Today, although home ownership of computers is widespread in the United States and other industrialized countries, there remains a need for free public access to computing, whether it is in CTCs, telecottages or public libraries to ensure that everyone has access to technologies that have become essential.

There are also CTCs located in the state of [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]], that provide technology, resources, training and educational programs to communities in regional, rural and remote areas. 

==Types==
Beyond the differences in names, public ICT access centers are diverse, varying in the clientele they serve, the services they provide, as well as their business or organizational model. Around the world, some telecentres include NGO-sponsored, local government, commercial, school-based, and university-related&lt;ref&gt;Proenza, Bastidas-Buch &amp; Mondero,"Telecentres for Socio-Economic and Rural Development in Latin America and the Caribbean," 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States and other countries, public access to the Internet in libraries may also be considered within the “telecentre concept”, especially when the range of services offered is not limited to pure access but also includes training end-users. Each type has advantages and disadvantages when considering attempts to link communities with ICTs and to bridge the digital divide. Among the various types: 

* NGO-sponsored telecentres are hosted by an NGO, which manages the center and integrates it, to one degree or another, into the organization's core business
* Local government telecentres seek to further local development; they often aim to disseminate information, decentralize services, and encourage civic participation, in addition to providing public ICT access.
* Commercial telecentres, launched by entrepreneurs for profit, range from the purely commercial [[cybercafé]] to the social enterprise, where profit and social good objectives are combined.
* School-based telecentres can be structured to involve community members during off-school hours, but costs need to be shared by the school system and the community.
* University-related telecentres can offer social outreach to disadvantaged and community groups, provide training, develop locally relevant content, and establish and facilitate virtual networks.
* Internet access in public libraries.&lt;ref&gt;Bertot, J. C., McClure, C. R., &amp; Jaeger, P. T. (2008). [http://mcclure.ii.fsu.edu/publications/2008/The%20impacts%20of%20free%20public%20Internet%20access%20on%20public%20library%20patrons%20and%20communities.pdf The impacts of free public Internet access on public library patrons and communities] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425091515/http://mcclure.ii.fsu.edu/publications/2008/The%20impacts%20of%20free%20public%20Internet%20access%20on%20public%20library%20patrons%20and%20communities.pdf |date=2012-04-25 }} (PDF). Library Quarterly, p. 285‐301. Retrieved on October 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Need for telecentres==
It is estimated that 40% of the world's population has less than US$ 20 per year available to spend on ICT. In Brazil, the poorest 20% of the population counts with merely US$9 per year to spend on ICT (US$ 0.75 per month).&lt;ref name="HilbertWD38,5"&gt;Martin Hilbert ''[https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2009.11.019 "When is Cheap, Cheap Enough to Bridge the Digital Divide? Modeling Income Related Structural Challenges of Technology Diffusion in Latin America"]''. [http://www.elsevier.com/locate/worlddev World Development], Volume 38, issue 5, p. 756-770. free access to the study here: martinhilbert.net/CheapEnoughWD_Hilbert_pre-print.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In Mexico, the poorest 20% of the society counts with an estimated US$ 35 per year (US$ 3 per month). For Latin America it is estimated that the borderline between ICT as a [[necessity good]] and ICT as a [[luxury good]] is roughly around the "magical number" of US$10 per person per month, or US$120 per year.&lt;ref name="HilbertWD38,5"/&gt;

==Telecentres and international development institutions==
In the 1990s, international development institutions such as Canada’s International Development Research Centre ([[International Development Research Centre|IDRC]]) and [[UNESCO]], sponsored the deployment of many telecentres in developing countries. Both IDRC and UNESCO are still very involved in the telecentre movement. The former telecentre.org programme at IDRC was transferred to the telecentre.org Foundation in the Philippines in March 2010&lt;ref&gt;Philippines is new home base of telecentre.org http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/March2010/02/c6161.html&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to support networks of telecentres around the world. UNESCO continues to support the growth of community multimedia centers (CMCs), which, unlike most other telecentres, have a local community radio, television or other media component.

==Sustainability considerations==
In light of the rapidly evolving technologies that support telecentres and in light of the increased penetration of mobile technologies (i.e., cell phones), the telecentre model needs to continuously evolve in order to remain relevant and to continue to address the changing needs of the communities they serve. As mobile communication technologies become more pervasive around the world, including in rural areas, the telecentres may no longer need to provide phone services, yet they may still be very relevant in terms of access to web-enabled e-government services, e-Learning, and basic Internet communication needs (email and web browsing).&lt;ref name="download.microsoft.com"&gt;Fillip, B. and Foote, D. (March, 2007). [http://download.microsoft.com/download/6/9/f/69f8c76b-198e-4114-9c12-f0b13e4d7e4e/Making_Connection_Covers_Text_Final.pdf Making the Connection: Scaling Telecenters for Development] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614232403/http://download.microsoft.com/download/6/9/f/69f8c76b-198e-4114-9c12-f0b13e4d7e4e/Making_Connection_Covers_Text_Final.pdf |date=2012-06-14 }} (PDF).

Among the various sustainability considerations:

''Evolving models'' — since the local demand for information and communication services is evolving, the telecentre models need to evolve as well. Franchises and other approaches to linking and networking telecentres are proving to be popular.

''Evolving technologies'' — wireless connectivity technologies, beyond [[VSAT]] (known to be expensive) are being explored in many communities around the world. These technologies provide new opportunities for connecting communities through telecentres and eventually at the individual household level.

''Evolving services'' — the types of services that telecentres can and should provide is also rapidly evolving. As the fields of [[eGovernment]], [[eHealth]], [[e-Learning]], [[eCommerce]] are evolving and maturing in many countries, telecentres need to take advantage of opportunities to extend the benefits to the community at large, through their public access. Some governments are pursuing the deployment of telecentres precisely as a means of ensuring that larger segments of the population are able to access government services and information through electronic channels.&lt;ref name="download.microsoft.com"/&gt;

''Community stakeholders'' - identifying leaders among the community who champion the concept of shared services through telecentre mode, play a crucial role as a bridge between the telecentre operator and hesitant villagers. Indeed, There is a maturing period during which community leaders have to invest constant efforts to drive changes of behaviour in the adoption of innovations.&lt;ref&gt;

''Community involvement'' is required however, at the initial phase of the telecentre set up, starting with the site selection and creating a sort of empathy and feeling of empowerment. Furthermore, the telecentre should be well rooted in the socio-cultural context of the community.

==Networks==
The telecentres of today and of the future are networked telecentres, or telecentres of the 2.0 generation.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly, telecentres are not operating as independent, isolated entities but as members of a network. At times, the network takes the form of a franchise. In other circumstances, the network is much more informal.

One such regional network targeted towards [[Asia-Pacific]] is, the [[Asia-Pacific Telecentre Network]].

In the [[United States]], more than 1,000 community technology centers where organized under the leadership of [[CTCnet]], a [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit association]] headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ctcnet.org CTCnet&lt;/ref&gt;  CTCs are also organized under the banner of state organizations, such as the Ohio Community Computing Network,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohioccn.org Ohio Community Computing Network]&lt;/ref&gt; or city programs such the City of Seattle Community Technology Program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattle.gov/tech City of Seattle Community Technology Program]&lt;/ref&gt; and Austin FreeNet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://austinfree.net/ Austin FreeNet]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5233">"'''The Crime and the Glory of Commander Suzdal'''" is a [[science fiction]] [[short story]] by [[Cordwainer Smith]], set in Smith's "[[Instrumentality of Mankind|Instrumentality]]" universe.  It was first published in ''[[Amazing Stories]]'' in May 1964, and is collected in ''[[The Rediscovery of Man]]'' compendium.

==Plot==

Commander Suzdal is a captain of "The Navy and the Instrumentality" sent on a "one man" mission of exploration (in actuality he is accompanied by several generations of "Turtle-People"). He hibernates in [[Cryonics|cryogenic sleep]] while long-lived turtle underpeople run the ship, until the need for a "true human" arises. 

A deep space probe is found. It tells a brilliantly conceived but utterly false story about the plight of a group of settlers calling themselves the Arachosians.  Suzdal is deceived and turns his ship towards the planet Arachosia and reenters hibernation. 

When he arrives he learns the horrible truth. The original settlers nearly became extinct, succumbing to a plague that (in Smith's words) rendered "femininity carcinogenic."  They were only able to save their women by chemically (and later genetically) making them male.  However, the resulting society is deeply unbalanced by the lack of females and ordinary family structure. The Arachosians, not truly male or female and calling themselves "klopts", realize on an instinctive level what they are missing and as a result, hate normal human beings with unbridled fervor and regard them as abominations to be destroyed (even though they have not seen one in many generations).  To carry out this plan, they have dispatched traps in the form of messages, such as the one Suzdal encountered, throughout the galaxy.

When Suzdal wakes up, the Arachosians are already crawling over the outside of his ship. On the advice of an artificial security officer, he uses an emergency device intended to send his large spacecraft back a few seconds in time to instead hurl feline genetic material (coded to evolve for intelligence and to obey Suzdal) millions of years back on the far side of the local moon. A race of advanced, space-faring cat-descendants appears instantaneously and hail Suzdal as their god and creator. They engage the Arachosians at his order, allowing him to escape.

Despite saving the ship and successfully concealing Earth's location from the Arachosians, Suzdal is stripped of rank, name, life and finally death, finding himself sentenced to the prison planet Shayol for his misuse of the time device. He is later seen in the story "[[A Planet Named Shayol]]". Meanwhile the Instrumentality officially declares all accounts of his story to be lies, including the text at hand.

==Reception==
Thomas Clareson has described "Commander Suzdal" as "more [[parable]] than story",&lt;ref name=Clareson&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=N-qd868ZNtQC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;dq=%22commander+suzdal%22+parable&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PmbjVNuyL9&amp;sig=f_Iz1Z-fq8vpgQLG7LB8ftWi4KM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=q2BNVZ-8FpKtyAS_j4CIDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22commander%20suzdal%22%20parable&amp;f=false Voices for the Future: Essays on Major Science Fiction Writers, Volume 3], by Thomas Clareson; published 1983 by Popular Press (via [[Google Books]])&lt;/ref&gt; while Eliot Borenstein considers it "an oblique [[cautionary tale]] about men's attempts to manage without women." &lt;ref name=Borenstein&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=4f2K5Ncn-JIC&amp;pg=PA284&amp;lpg=PA284&amp;dq=%22commander+suzdal%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DQxiQW-Sx6&amp;sig=W9_VXxAItgLGwt-5lRBLU8960XY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=15JNVbe_BMiZyASghIDIAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22commander%20suzdal%22&amp;f=false Men Without Women: Masculinity and Revolution in Russian Fiction, 1917-1929], by Eliot Borenstein; published 2000 by [[Duke University Press]] (via [[Google Books]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Rich Horton, writing for ''[[Black Gate (magazine)|Black Gate]]'', calls the story "odd", "decidedly weird" and "disquieting", comparing the Arachosians disfavorably to the all-male society in [[Lois McMaster Bujold]]'s ''[[Ethan of Athos]]'', but conceding that it has "some of the incantatory power Smith always strove for".&lt;ref name=Horton&gt;[https://www.blackgate.com/2015/01/08/amazing-stories-may-1964-a-retro-review/ Amazing Stories, May 1964: A Retro-Review], by Rich Horton, in ''[[Black Gate (magazine)|Black Gate]]''; published January 8, 2015; retrieved May 8, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Kincaid]], at the ''[[SF Site]]'', described it as a story about the human "capacity to become monsters when we follow someone who is 'brilliant, remorseless, implacable'," and compared the Arachosians' broadcast lure to [[Tokyo Rose]].&lt;ref name=Kincaid&gt;[https://www.sfsite.com/04b/wp390.htm When the People Fell, by Cordwainer Smith], reviewed by [[Paul Kincaid]], at the ''[[SF Site]]''; published 2013; retrieved July 26, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tlatelolco''' ({{lang-nci-IPA|Mēxihco-Tlatelōlco|tɬateˈloːɬko}}, {{audio|Tlatilolco.ogg|modern Nahuatl pronunciation}}) (also called '''Mexico Tlatelolco''') was a [[pre-Columbian|prehispanic]] [[altepetl]] or city-state, in the [[Valley of Mexico]]. Its inhabitants were known as ''Tlatelolca''. The Tlatelolca were a part of the [[Mexica]], a [[Nahuatl]]-speaking people who arrived in what is now central Mexico in the 13th century. The Mexica settled on an island in [[Lake Texcoco]], founding the ''altepetl'' of Mexico-Tenochtitlan on the southern portion of the island. In 1337, a group of dissident Mexica broke away from the Tenochca leadership in Tenochtitlan and founded Mexico-Tlatelolco on the northern portion of the island. Tenochtitlan was closely tied with its sister city, which was largely dependent on the market of Tlatelolco, the most important site of commerce in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Matos Moctezuma, Eduardo. "Tlatelolco". ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Culture'', vol. 3, pp. 230-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Moquihuix mendoza.jpg|thumb|left|Defeat of the ''[[Tlatoani]]'' of Mexico-Tlatelolco, [[Moquihuix]], in 1473, according to [[Codex Telleriano-Remensis]].]]

[[Image:Tlatelolco Barrios.png|right|thumb|Barrios of pre-conquest Tlatelolco over modern map]]
In 1337, thirteen years after the foundation of Tenochtitlan, the Tlatelolca declared themselves independent from the Tenochca and inaugurated their first independent ''[[tlatoani]]'' (dynastic ruler). Under the king [[Quaquapitzahuac|Cuacuauhpitzahuac]] (1376&amp;ndash;1417), the first two stages of the Main Pyramid of Tlatelolco were constructed. Under [[Tlacateotl]], the Tlatelolca assisted the Tenochca in the war against the [[Tepanec]] empire, dominated by [[Azcapotzalco (altepetl)|Azcapotzalco]].  shortly thereafter, the first war between the Tenochca and Tlatelolca erupted. Also during Tlacateotl's reign, the third stage of the Main Pyramid was constructed. Under Cuauhtlatoa (1427&amp;ndash;1467), the Tlatelolca conquered the city-state of Ahuilizapan (now [[Orizaba, Veracruz]]), and fought against the people of [[Chalco (altépetl)|Chalco]] along with the Tenochca. The fourth and fifth stages of the Main Pyramid were constructed in this period. The ruler Moquihuix constructed the sixth stage of the temple, but in 1473 he was defeated by the Tenochca ''tlatoani'' [[Axayacatl]], and Tlatelolco was made subject to Tenochtitlan. [[Itzcuauhtzin]] ruled Tlatelolco during a period in which it was almost completely incorporated into Tenochtitlan.&lt;ref name=Miguel&gt;León-Portilla, M. 1992, 'The [[Broken Spears]]: The Aztec Accounts of the Conquest of Mexico.'' Boston: Beacon Press, {{ISBN|978-0807055014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|65}}

After the completion of the two-year [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish Conquest]] of the Aztec Empire in 1521, the Spanish conquerors established the ruins of Mexico-Tenochtitlan as the Spanish capital of [[New Spain]].  The remnants of the indigenous populations of Tenochtitlan and Tlatelolco following the conquest were administered by indigenous elites in the incorporated Indian towns of Santiago Tlatelolco and San Juan Tenochtitlan. Tlatelolco remained an important location in the colonial era, partly because of the foundation there of the school for elite indigenous men, the [[Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco]], which was the first school of higher learning in the Americas.  Today its remains are located within [[Mexico City]].

In the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, archeological excavations have taken place at the [[Tlatelolco (archaeological site)]] in what is now part of [[Mexico City]]. The excavations of the [[pre-Columbian|prehispanic]] [[city-state ]] are centered on the [[Plaza de las Tres Culturas]], a square surrounded on three sides by an excavated [[Aztec]] site, a 17th-century church called ''Templo de Santiago'', and the modern office complex of the [[Secretariat of Foreign Affairs|Mexican foreign ministry]]. In February 2009, the discovery of a [[mass grave]] with 49 human bodies was announced by archaeologists. The grave is considered unusual because the bodies are laid out in ritual fashion.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7885513.stm | title = Aztec 'warrior' mass grave found | publisher = BBC | date = 12 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''UFO-NORGE''', founded in 1972, is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] national [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] research organisation.

During the summer of 1946, the Norwegian press started reporting sightings of "[[ghost rockets]]". Hundreds of people all over [[Scandinavia]] saw these phenomena, which have not yet been studied in detail by researchers. Press coverage of UFO sightings was high in 1947, and the first books about ''Flying Saucers'' appeared 1954.

The first UFO groups started to form during the early 1950s. Small groups existed in several of Norway's largest cities during the 1950s and 1960s. None of these were particularly interested in scientific aspects, most were convinced that the aliens were already here.

In 1972, these small groups formed a national organisation called Norsk UFO Center (NUFOC). In 1980 NUFOC changed its name to UFO-NORGE. During the 1970s and 1980s NUFOC/UFO-NORGE gradually became more sensible and less secteric. Today, UFO-NORGE represents a serious and common-sense approach to UFO phenomena.

== Objectives ==
The objectives of UFO-NORGE are to:
#Research and identify reports of UFO phenomena through gathering and investigating sighting accounts, as well as inform the public through our quarterly journal.
#Collect, process and study all available information on UFOs in Norway.
#Strive for the use of scientific principles and methods in its investigation.
#Be open to any and all hypotheses and theories which may represent possible solutions to the UFO enigma, and will not attribute unidentified reports to any particular theory.

== Meaning of the word UFO ==
Today, the word "UFO" is accepted as a proper noun.
UFO-NORGE has defined the term UFO as "a reported phenomenon in the sky, in the [[airspace]], or on the ground, with the key characteristics of being and remaining unidentified even after being investigated by competent researchers".

== Management ==
UFO-NORGE is an organisation managed by a board of directors ("Styret"), 3 persons ("styreformann" + 2 x "styremedlem"), which irregularly get together. Each year the board of directors and an additional 6 people, which hold various functions within the organisation, meet and discuss/decide the larger issues of organisation direction and guidelines.
All activities are carried out on an unpaid, spare time basis.

== Investigation of sightings ==
As part of the investigation of reports, a paper report form is used. In addition we have a web-based report form. Since 1972, UFO-NORGE has investigated and collected more than 4,000 reports, of which a significant part has turned out to be known (mis-)identified phenomena. Today the percentage of explained sightings is between 80% and 95%. The remaining 5-20% cannot be explained and are archived as UFO reports.
Earlier the identified IFO reports were not saved for posterity, but today they are (since 1995).

== Publications ==
* ''UFO'' a journal with four issues a year which have today about 300 subscribers (co-published and co-printed, back to back, with UFO-Sweden's 'UFO-Aktuellt').

The '''Urhobos''' are people located in Southern [[Nigeria]], near the northwestern [[Niger Delta]]. The Urhobo are the major ethnic group in [[Delta State]], one of the 36 states of the [[Federal Republic of Nigeria]]. The Urhobos speak the [[Urhobo language]]. 

The word Urhobo refers to a group of people rather than a territory. Approximately two million people are Urhobos. They have a social and cultural affinity to the [[Edo]] people of Nigeria. The Urhobo people live in a territory bounded by latitudes 6°and 5°, 15° North and Longitudes 5°, 40° and 6°, 25° East in the Delta and the [[Bayelsa State|Bayelsa States]] of Nigeria. Their neighbors are the Isoko to the Southeast, the [[Itsekiri]] and [[Ijaw people|Ijaw]] to the West, [[Edo people|the Edo people]], Bini, to the North, the Ijaw to the South and [[Ukwuani people|the Ukwuani people]] (to the Northeast). Urhobo territory consists of evergreen forests with many oil palm trees. The territory is covered by a network of streams, whose volume and flow are directly affected by the seasons. The [[wet season]] is traditionally from April to October, and [[dry season]] ranges from November to March.

==Indigenous government and politics==
The Urhobos are organized into two different political kingdoms, gerontocracies and plutocracies. A [[gerontocracy]] is a government run by elders, based on the age-grade-system, while a [[plutocracy]] is governed by the rich and wealthy, with some elements of gerontocracy. Although it is not clear which kingship is older among the kingdoms, their developments reached a climax in the 1940s and 50s.

The Urhobo government structure occurs at two levels, kingdom and town. The people are organized either by elders or by the wealthy. 

Urhobo indigenous governments have an ''Ovie'' (king), who is the highest political figure. The Ovie is the symbol of the kingdoms' culture and royal predecessors. His councillors consist of the ''Otota'' (speaker), and the ''Ohoveworen'' or ''Okakoro'', addressed collectively as ''Ilorogun'' (singular: ''Olorogun''). Other title holders are the executioners (''Ikoikpokpo''), and the warriors (''Ogbu''). Other political titles are specific to the different kingdoms. The judicial system places a clear distinction between civil and criminal offenses.

The queen, is called ''Ovieya'', and her children are known as ''Ọmọ Ovie''. Presently, this name is given to children without royal heritage. Some Urhobo cultural divisions adopted titles other than Ovie. For example, the Okpe call their traditional ruler ''Orodje'', Okere-Urhobo call theirs ''Orosuen'', Agbarho uses ''Osuivie'', Orogun use ''Okpara-Uku''" (mainly due to their proximity with [[Ukwuani people]]), and the Urhobos in the Olomu Kingdom call their king ''Ohworode''. Some Southern Urhobo clans and communities also practice the Odio system, which is widespread in the [[Isoko region]].

==Location==
{{quote|Urhobo is physically embedded in the Atlantic forest belt that stretches from Senegal in West Africa to Angola in central Africa. Historically, this region was the most pristine in all of Africa. Until the Portuguese burst into its territories in the late fifteenth century, its forest peoples cultivated their own forms of civilization, untouched by outside influences. This forest belt of western Africa was reached neither by ancient Christian influences, which had a large foothold in North Africa, nor by Islamic forces that came as far south as Hausaland by the eleventh century. While East Africa and even Central Africa were touched by Asian and Arab influences from across the Indian Ocean, as the amalgam of Swahili language bears out, no similar trans-Atlantic influences breached the forest belt until the Portuguese arrival in the late fifteenth century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ekeh|first1=Peter|title=Studies in Urhobo culture|date=2005|publisher=Urhobo Historical Society|location=Buffalo|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Professor Peter Palmer Ekeh, founder of the [http://www.waado.org/ Urhobo Historical Society]|source=Studies in Urhobo Culture}}

The bulk of the Urhobo people reside in the Southwestern states of Delta and Bayelsa in Nigeria, also referred to as the [[Niger Delta]]. Ofoni is an Urhobo community in Sagbama, Local Government Area, in Bayelsa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tarakiriclusterfoundation.org/?p=1189|title=Ofoni Community {{!}} Tarakiri Cluster Development Foundation|website=www.tarakiriclusterfoundation.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ofoni is about 40 kilometers by water to [[Sagbama]].  Many Urhobos live in small and major cities in regions or local government areas in [[Ughelli]], [[Warri, Nigeria|Warri]], [[Abraka]], Orerokpe and [[Sapele]]. Some Urhobo major cities and towns include Okparabe, Arhavwarien, Warri, Sapele, Abraka and Ughelli.

The following are local government areas where Urhobo traditional homes are located in Delta and Bayelsa:
* Ethiope East 
* Ethiope West 
* Okpe
* Sapele 
* Udu
* Ughelli North 
* Ughelli South 
* Uvwie 
* Warri South
* Patani
* Sagbama (in Bayelsa State)
* Ikpoba Okha (in Edo State)

==Culture==

===Festivals===
The Urhobos live very close to, and sometimes in boats on the [[Niger river]]. Most of their histories, mythologies, and philosophies are water-related. Annual fishing festivals that include masquerades, fishing, swimming contests and dancing, that became part of the Urhobo heritage. An annual, two-day, festival, called Ohworu takes place in [[Evwreni]], the southern part of the Urhobo area. During this festival the Ohworhu water spirit and the Eravwe Oganga are displayed. 

===Marriage===
Marriage in Urhobo culture requires prayers to the ancestors (''Erivwin''), and God (''Oghene''). The marriage ritual, known as ''Udi Arhovwaje,'' takes place in the ancestral home of the bride or a patrilineal relation of the bride.

The groom goes with his relatives and friends to the bride's father's home, bringing gifts of drinks, salt, kola nuts and occasionally food requested by the bride's family. Formal is given by the bride's parents, or whomever is representing the bride's family, as are the traditional rites of pouring [[gin]], brought by the groom, as a tribute to the father's ancestors in order to bless them with health, children and wealth. After this marriage rite the husband can claim a refund of the money (bride price) should the marriage fail. It is believed that the ancestors witness the marriage, and only the physical body that is sent to the husband in the marriage, the ''Erhi'' (spirit double), remains in the family home. This explains why a woman is brought back to be buried in her family home when she dies.

In the ancestral home of the man, the wife is welcomed into the family by the eldest member. She is expected to confess all of her love affairs during and after her betrothal to her husband, if any, and is then absolved from of them. She becomes a full member of her husband's family after this ritual, and is assumed to be protected by the supernatural (''Erivwin''). This ritual symbolizes an agreement between the wife and the ''Erivwin''.

If the wife later becomes unfaithful, it is believed that she will be punished by the ''Erivwin'' – this is why wives are faithful to their husbands.

===Urhobo and Isoko===

Urhobo has never been an homogenous linguistic entity. Since time immemorial, Urhobo has been colored by variation that occur on various levels. These variations manifest in the various Urhobo clans and kingdoms. A specific dialect of Urhobo has even broken off and become an individual ethnic nationality (Isoko). Another dialect is prospecting at this option (Okpe). The main reason for this break-off is that these dialects see themselves as individual groups. The Isoko Dialect of Urhobo is so broad and large that it is effectively a language of its own. Isoko is a proto-Edoid language and hence it is closer to how Urhobo once was when the people said goodbye to their Benin progenitors. Isoko has its own sub-dialects such as Iyede, Erhowa, Enwhe, Olomoro, Oleh, etc. The main dialectal difference between Urhobo and Isoko include; Use of Degwo instead of Migwo for greeting, repetition of utterances and words.i.e. “Yanzobone Yanzobone (Come here, Come here)”, different names for various objects, etc. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://urhobotoday.com/?p=19663|date=|publisher=http://urhobotoday.com|accessdate=2015-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James W. Welch once asserted that [[Isoko language|Isoko]] is a dialect of Urhobo. For many years, most historians, linguists and cultural anthropologists are of the opinion that Isoko is just a dialect and a cultural unit of Urhobo. In fact, this was upheld by the British that these two ethnic groups were once referred to as the "Sobo" people. Later on, the Isokos were called the Eastern Urhobos. Till now, some people are of the belief that these two ethnic units are one due to similarities in culture, language, food and virtually everything. The Isoko and Urhobo names for most items are mostly the same. They greet the same way ( Urhobos say Migwor and Isokos say Digwor ), marriages are in the same tradition, traditional religion and philosophy is akin and even dressing is the same. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ihuanedo.ning.com/group/healtheducation/forum/topics/history-of-the-delta-tribes-of-urhobo-itsekhiri-isoko-ijaw|title=News Update |accessdate=2015-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Urhobo nation is made up of twenty-four sub-groups, including the largest, [[Okpe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waado.org/CulturalUnits/Okpe/asagba_okpe/asagba_okpe_history.htm |title=A Royal History of the Okpe-Urhobo of Nigeria by Prince Joseph Asagba |publisher=Waado.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2013/11/urhobo-kingdoms-and-political-staff-of-office/|title=Urhobo kingdoms and political staff of office - Vanguard News|date=2013-11-25|newspaper=Vanguard News|language=en-US|accessdate=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urhobo calendar===
The Urhobo ''Okpo'' (week) is made up of four days, based on regulated market cycles, religious worship, marriages and other community life. The four days are ''Edewo'', ''Ediruo'', ''Eduhre'' and ''Edebi''.  Edewo and Eduhre are sacred days to divinities, spirits and ancestors. Most markets are held on these days. On ''Edewo'', ancestors are venerated. Most traditional religious rituals are held on ''Eduhre''.

Spirits are believed to be active in the farmlands and forests on ''Edewo'' and ''Eduhre''. Therefore, farmers rarely work on these days so as not to disturb the spirits.

Urhobo months are called ''Emeravwe'' and are made up of 28 days. Most of the annual festivals are held during the months of ''Asa'', ''Eghwre'', ''Orianre'' and ''Urhiori''. These are the months of harvest, when farming activity is at its lowest, so most farmers are free to partake. These are also months to honor the gods of the land, as well as spiritual forces that brought a good harvest.

==Food==
As with most tribes in Nigeria, certain foods are considered to belong to or originate from a particular tribe. For example, pounded yam and [[egusi soup|''egusi'' soup]] come from the Yoruba's ([[Eba]]), and [[Ogbono soup|''Ogbono'' soup]], made from ''[[Irvingia gabonensis]]'' and sometimes referred to as ''[[Ogbolo]]'' soup, comes from people of Esan or Etsakor descent. Urhobos claim ''[[Ukhodo]]'' (a [[yam (vegetable)|yam]] and unripe [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]] dish prepared with either beef, poultry, or fish, and spiced with [[lemon grass]] and [[potash]]), ''[[Oghwevwri]]'' (emulsified palm oil soup), and starch (''Usi''), made from the [[cassava]] plant. It is heated and stirred into a thick mound with added [[palm oil]] to give the starch its unique orange-yellow colour. ''Oghwevwri'' is composed of smoked or dried fish, bush meat, unique spices, potash and oil palm juice.  Other delicacies of the Urhobo tribe are palm nut oil soup and ''[[amiedi]]'' or [[banga soup|''banga'' soup]], often eaten with ''usi'' and or ''[[garri]]''. ''Banga'' is made from palm kernel. Other culinary delicacies include ''Iriboto'', ''Iriberhare'' and ''Okpariku''.

==Religion==
The main focus of Urhobo traditional religion is the adoration of "Ọghẹnẹ" (Almighty God), the supreme deity, and recognition of Edjo and Erhan (divinities). Some of these divinities could be regarded as personified attributes of Ọghẹnẹ. The Urhobo also worship God with ''Orhen'' (white chalk). If an Urhobo feels oppressed by someone, he appeals to Ọghẹnẹ, who he believes to be an impartial judge, to adjudicate between him and his opponent. Oghene is the fundamental factor and manifestation of all divinities. Urhobo divinities can be classified into four main categories, which probably coincide with historical development. These categories are Guardian divinities, War divinities, Prosperity divinities and Fertility and Ethical divinities.

''Erivwin'', which is the cult of ancestors and predecessors (''Esemo'' and ''Iniemo''), is another important element. The dead are believed to be living, and looked upon as active members who watch over the affairs of their family. Urhobos believe in the duality of man, i.e., that man consists of two beings: physical body (''Ugboma'') and spiritual body (''Erhi'').

It is the ''Erhi'' that declares man's destiny and controls the self-realization of man's destiny before he incarnates into the world. ''Erhi'' also controls the overall well being (''Ufuoma'') of the man. Ọghẹnẹ is like a monarch who sets his seal on the path of destiny.

In the spirit world, ''Erivwin'', man's destiny is ratified and sealed. In the final journey of the ''Erhi'', after transition, the Urhobo believe the physical body, ''Ugboma'', decays while the ''Ehri'' is indestructible and joins the ancestors in ''Erivwin''. The elaborate and symbolic burial rites are meant to prepare the departed ''Erhi'' for happy re-union with the ancestors.

Despite this age-old and complex belief system, the influence of [[Western world|western civilization]] and [[Christianity]] is fast becoming an acceptable religion in most Urhobo communities. Many belong to [[Catholic]] and new [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] denominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waado.org/UrhoboCulture/Religion/Nabofa/Divination/Epha.html|title=Epha: An Urhobo System of Divination and Its Esoteric Language By M.Y.

''Epha'' divination, similar to the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] ''[[Ifá]]'' and practiced by many West African ethnic groups, is practiced with strings of cowries.  There are 1,261 ''ejo'' (deities), including the one-handed, one-legged mirror-holding whirlwind-god Aziza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waado.org/urhoboculture/Religion/tonukari/Aziza.htm |title=Aziza: King of the Urhobo Forest By Ochuko J.

The '''Vienna Opera Ball''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Wiener Opernball'') is an annual [[Austria]]n [[upper class|society]] event which takes place in the building of the [[Vienna State Opera]] in Vienna, Austria on the Thursday preceding [[Ash Wednesday]] (a religious holiday). Together with the [[Vienna New Year's Concert|New Year Concert]], the [[Ball (dance)|ball]] is one of the highlights of the Viennese [[carnival|carnival season]].

== History ==
The tradition of the ball goes back to 1814 during the time when the crowned heads of Europe and the aristocracy searched for entertainment after the Napoleonic wars. The first ball in the opera house took place in 1877 as a ''[[soirée]]''. The following balls were ''redoute'', a French term for [[masquerade ball]]s or costume parties, where the ladies wore their masks until midnight. From 1878 until 1899, such ''redoute'' balls took place around two to three times a year.

The first ''redoute'' after World War I took place in 1921, with proceeds going to the pension fund of the two state theaters. These events were called also called ''Opernredoute''.

The first ball to be named "Opera Ball" was held in 1935 under the honorary patronage of the Federal Chancellor, but was suspended during [[World War II]]. It was revived after the war; it has been held annually ever since, with the exception of 1991, when it was cancelled due to the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]]. Since 2008, Desirée Treichl-Stürgkh has been the chairman (supervising organizer) of the Vienna Opera Ball. It is the highlight of the season, with the heads of state and government, the political and industrial elite, members of the high society, and their guests attending. The price for the entry tickets is the highest of all the Viennese balls.

Starting in 1987, the ''Opernballdemo'', a [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[Demonstration (people)|demonstration]] along the [[Ringstraße]] against the kind of [[capitalism]] represented by, as the protesters see it, many of the elite attending the ball, has regularly taken place on the same night. There have been occasional outbreaks of violence. This has almost disappeared since 2011, with protests focusing on the nationalist ''[[Akademikerball]]'' instead.

The only ball officially associated with the Vienna Opera Ball is the [[Viennese Opera Ball in New York|A similar ball]] takes place in New York City and [[Budapest Opera Ball|another]] in Budapest, but they are not affiliated with the Vienna Opera Ball.

== Organization ==
Each year, almost overnight, the [[auditorium]] of the Vienna State Opera is turned into a large [[ballroom]]. On the eve of the event, the rows of seats are removed from the [[stalls (theatre)|stalls]], and a new floor, level with the [[Stage (theatre)|stage]], is built.

The dress code is [[White tie|evening dress]]: white tie and tails for men; usually floor-length [[gown]]s for women.

The ball does not start until around 10 pm when the [[Austrian president]] and his guests enter the imperial balcony. Their arrival is heralded by trumpets. The Austrian national anthem is played followed by the European anthem. There are performances of the state opera ballet company and classical arias sung by the opera stars. These are normally a small selection of Italian opera and famous Austrian pieces. The highlight of the opening ceremony is the introduction of 180 [[debutante]] couples. These are carefully selected young women and men who have successfully completed an application program and a strict classical dance choreography organised by the [[Elmayer dance school]]. The debutantes are led into the opera house to the sounds of [[Carl Michael Ziehrer]]'s ''Fächer[[polonaise]]''. Dances are then, for example, the [[Polonaise]] in A-Dur, Op. 40 by [[Frédéric Chopin]] and Johann Strauss' ''Warschauer-[[Polka]]''. The last dance of the debutantes is always the ''Blue Danube'' [[Viennese Waltz]] by [[Johann Strauss II]], after which the floor is opened to all guests.

The ball runs until 6 am. The opera house offers all access to the guests, with various other rooms and lounges open with different types of music and dance. There is catering on all floors offered by [[Café Gerstner]], as well as a [[hairdresser]], an in-house [[tailor]], and medical teams on standby. [[Casinos Austria]] is one of the sponsors and offers [[roulette]].

Various dances moderated by the master of ceremony take place every two hours, such as the popular [[cotillion]]. Although not officially allowed, towards the end the tradition is for the guests to take apart the flower decoration on the balcony and shower the remaining dancers with it on the main floor, or take it home.

In a joint venture, [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]] and [[Bayerischer Rundfunk|BR]] broadcast live from the ball for several hours each year.

== In media ==
In [[1995 in literature|1995]] Austrian writer [[Josef Haslinger]] published a [[novel]] entitled ''[[Opernball (novel)|Opernball]]'' in which thousands of people are killed in a [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]] [[terrorist attack]] taking place during that society event. The novel was the basis of a [[1998 in film|1998]] [[Opernball (made-for-TV movie)|made-for-TV movie]] by [[Urs Egger]] with the same title.

The ball was featured in the postcard for San Marino in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2015]]. In it, San Marinese participants [[Michele Perniola]] and [[Anita Simoncini]] attend an evening at the ball.

==Outside of Austria==
"Viennese balls" outside of Austria are held in [[Paris]], [[Viennese Opera Ball in New York|New York]], [[Moscow]], [[Stockholm]], [[Dubai Opera Ball|Dubai]], etc.
