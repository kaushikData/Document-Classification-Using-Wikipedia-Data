'''''A Community of Witches: Contemporary Neo-Paganism and Witchcraft in the United States''''' is a [[sociology|sociological]] study of the [[Wicca]]n and wider [[Paganism (contemporary)|Pagan]] community in the [[Northeastern United States]]. It was written by American sociologist [[Helen A. Berger]] of the [[West Chester University of Pennsylvania]] and first published in 1999 by the [[University of South Carolina Press]]. It was released as a part of a series of academic books entitled Studies in Comparative Religion, edited by Frederick M. Denny, a [[religious studies]] scholar at the [[University of Chicago]].

Berger became interested in studying the Wiccan and Pagan movement in 1986, when she presented a lecture on the subject at the [[Boston Public Library]]. Subsequently becoming acquainted with members of the New England Pagan community, she undertook fieldwork in both a local Wiccan coven, the Circle of Light, and a wider Pagan organisation, the EarthSpirit Community (ESC). In total, Berger underwent 11 years of fieldwork among the Pagan community. Along with ESC founder Andras Corban Arthen, Berger also undertook a "Pagan Census" survey of the U.S. in the mid-1990s to obtain more data on the country's Pagan community.

''A Community of Witches'' is based on interviews with more than a hundred practicing Wiccans and Pagans, study of the pre-existing literature on the subject and a national survey of the Pagan community in the U.S. In her work, Berger interprets Wicca as a religion of [[late modernity]], as opposed to [[postmodernism|postmodernity]], and subsequently examines it using the theories of sociologists [[Anthony Giddens]] and [[James A. Beckford]]. Themes covered include Pagan conceptions of the self, the role of covens and the wider Pagan community, the place of children in the movement and the increasing routinization of Wicca through the foundation of organised churches and clergy.

Academic reviewers were mostly positive, but several raised concerns over Berger's incorrect use of terminology. Reviewers noted the study's importance in developing [[Pagan studies]] as an academic discipline and helping further the wider sociological investigation into [[new religious movement]]s in the United States. In the years following the study's publication, Berger continued to investigate the Pagan community, focusing her interest on the popularity of Wicca among teenagers.

==Background==

===Paganism and Wicca in the United States===

Contemporary Paganism, also referred to as Neo-Paganism, is an [[umbrella term]] used to identify a wide variety of [[new religious movement|modern religious movements]], particularly those influenced by or claiming to be derived from the various [[Paganism|pagan]] beliefs of pre-modern Europe.&lt;ref name="Carpenter 1996 40"&gt;[[#Car96|Carpenter 1996]]. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew04|Lewis 2004]]. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The religion of Pagan Witchcraft, or [[Wicca]], was developed in England during the first half of the 20th century and is one of several Pagan religions. The figure at the forefront of Wicca's early development was the English occultist [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] (1884&amp;ndash;1964), the author of ''[[Witchcraft Today]]'' (1954) and ''[[The Meaning of Witchcraft]]'' (1959) and the founder of a tradition known as [[Gardnerian Wicca]]. Gardnerian Wicca revolved around the veneration of both a [[Horned God]] and a [[Mother Goddess]], the celebration of eight seasonally-based festivals in a [[Wheel of the Year]] and the practice of magical rituals in groups known as [[coven]]s. Gardnerianism was subsequently brought to the U.S. in the early 1960s by an English initiate, [[Raymond Buckland]] (1934&amp;ndash;), and his then-wife Rosemary, who together founded a coven in [[Long Island]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]] pp. 205&amp;ndash;252.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cli06|Clifton 2006]]. pp. 24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., new variants of Wicca developed, including [[Dianic Wicca]], a tradition founded in the 1970s which was influenced by [[second-wave feminism]], emphasized female-only covens, and rejected the veneration of the Horned God. One initiate of both the Dianic and Gardnerian traditions was a woman known as [[Starhawk]] (1951&amp;ndash;) who went on to found her own tradition, [[Reclaiming (Neopaganism)|Reclaiming Wicca]]. She furthermore published ''[[The Spiral Dance|The Spiral Dance: a Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Great Goddess]]'' (1979), a book which helped spread Wicca throughout the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. pp. 340&amp;ndash;351&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cli06|Clifton 2006]]. pp. 122&amp;ndash;123&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic fieldwork into Wicca===

Prior to Berger's work, several American researchers working in the field of [[Pagan studies]] had separately published investigations of the Pagan community in the United States and the United Kingdom. The first of these was the practicing Wiccan, journalist and political activist [[Margot Adler]] in her ''[[Drawing Down the Moon (book)|Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today]]'', which was first published by [[Viking Press]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Adl79|Adler 1979]].&lt;/ref&gt; A second study was produced by the anthropologist [[Tanya Luhrmann|Tanya M. Luhrmann]] in her ''[[Persuasions of the Witch's Craft|Persuasions of the Witch's Craft: Ritual Magic in Contemporary England]]'' (1989), in which she focused on both a Wiccan coven and several ceremonial magic orders that were then operating in London.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Luh89|Luhrmann 1989]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The next academic book to be published based upon fieldwork undertaken in the U.S. Pagan community was ''[[Living Witchcraft|Living Witchcraft: A Contemporary American Coven]]'', published by Praeger in 1994. ''Living Witchcraft'' had been co-written by three academics, the sociologist Allen Scarboro, psychologist Nancy Campbell and literary critic Shirley Stave, herself a Wiccan practitioner. It was based upon their fieldwork undertaken in the Ravenwood coven of [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], over several months across 1990 and 1991.&lt;ref name="Scarboro"&gt;[[#Scar94|Scarboro, Campbell and Stave 1994]].&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time as Scarboro, Campbell and Stave were undertaking their research, the American anthropologist and practicing Wiccan Loretta Orion was also undertaking an investigation into the Pagan movement in the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] of the United States. Orion's work was published as ''[[Never Again the Burning Times|Never Again the Burning Times: Paganism Revisited]]'' by Waveland Press in 1995, although would be heavily criticized in published reviews written by both Luhrmann and T.O. Beidelman, both of whom were of the opinion that Orion's Pagan beliefs had clouded her critical interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;See [[#Ori95|Orion 1995]], and also [[#Bei95|Beidelman 1995]] and [[#Luh96|Luhrmann 1996]].&lt;/ref&gt; 1997 then saw the publication of ''[[Witchcraft and Paganism in Australia]]'', authored by the anthropologist Lynne Hume.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hum97|Hume 1997]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Berger and her research===

Helen Berger, then a lecturer in sociology at the [[West Chester University of Pennsylvania]], had initially become involved in the study of the Pagan movement in preparation for a series of public lectures that she gave at the [[Boston Public Library]] in October 1986. Based on the subject of [[Witch trials in the Early Modern period|the historical witch trials]] that took place in [[New England]] during the [[Early Modern period]], she devoted the final lecture in the series to an examination of the contemporary Pagan Witches, or Wiccans, then living in the area. Having yet to perform the sociological investigation that would culminate in ''A Community of Witches'', Berger gained her information for this lecture from the information published in the works of Margot Adler, Starhawk and [[Marcello Truzzi]], and also from a singular interview that she had carried out with a woman who was "peripherally associated" with Paganism. After the lecture, several audience members approached Berger to identify themselves as practicing Wiccans, and it was through them that she came into contact with the New England Pagan community.&lt;ref name="Berger 1999 xiv&amp;ndash;xv"&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. pp. xiv&amp;ndash;xv.&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the Wiccans at the lecture invited Berger to "participate as a researcher" as they founded their own coven, the Circle of Light, and she attended their weekly meetings and festival celebrations for the next two years.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past thirty years, Paganism has exhibited a considerable growth in membership, but, given such factors as the lack of centralized organization within the Pagan movement and the relative anonymity sought by many of its adherents, it is very difficult to estimate how many of us there are&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br&gt;'''Why is it needed?'''&lt;br&gt;There are several reasons why such a project is important. If we can document our numbers in some tangible way, we will be in a stronger position to attain more credibility as a religion and as a community. Greater credibility would enable us to better address issues of religious discrimination and social prejudice (the [[Jesse Helms|Helms Bill]], or movies such as ''[[The Craft (film)|The Craft]]'', for instance); would give us more weight in addressing anti-Pagan stereotypes&amp;nbsp;... and it would give us greater access to influential forums (such as academia, interfaith councils, etc.) from which Pagans have mostly been excluded."

}}

At the first open Pagan ritual that she attended, Berger met Andras Corban Arthen, the founder of the EarthSpirit Community (ESC), a Pagan organization open to non-Wiccans which she joined after paying the annual membership fee of $30. Attending many of the ESC's open rituals and festivals, she was introduced to a "diverse group" of Wiccans and other Pagans, and developed a contact base in the community.&lt;ref name="Berger 1999 xiv&amp;ndash;xv"/&gt; Berger and Arthen subsequently embarked on a project entitled "The Pagan Census" in an attempt to gain sociological data from the Pagan community across the U.S. Receiving funding from the Faculty Development Fund at West Chester University, Berger was aided in this project by over 15 students who helped her to code and enter data for the survey. Together, Berger and Arthen wrote and distributed their survey through Wiccan and Pagan organizations across the country, as well as in journals, on the internet and at festivals. The duo received over 2000 responses, providing Berger with one of her main sources of information.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. pp. xvi&amp;ndash;xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout her 11-year period of fieldwork, Berger had to use [[snowball sampling]] to retrieve her data on the Pagan community, something that she attributed to the "secrecy of groups and practitioners". She conducted formal interviews with over 40 practicing Pagans, and over 60 others instead were informally interviewed during conversations at Pagan events, following which Berger recorded their responses in her fieldnotes. She participated in rituals with ten different Wiccan covens, two of which were all-female covens, and the other eight of which were mixed-gender in structure, but all of whom assembled in the Northeastern United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. pp. xv&amp;ndash;xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; Accepting that this regional focus might affect her results, she supplemented her fieldwork by reading literature on Paganism from across the country, concluding that "the differences among groups and practitioners within the United States are less important than the similarities."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the sociologists Margot Adler and Loretta Orion, both of whom had been or became Pagans whilst studying the movement, Berger stated that she had not joined the religion, thereby remaining an "outsider" throughout her research, but had made many friends within the Pagan community.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

''A Community of Witches'' was a part of a series of books entitled 'Studies in Comparative Religion' that were published by the University of South Carolina Press, and edited by Frederick M. Denny. In Denny's preface to the book, he remarked that it "adds significantly to the steadily growing scholarly literature" on the subject of Wicca and contemporary Paganism, being of "considerable use for our understanding of how other new religious communities are sustaining and developing themselves in the unprecedented rich tapestry of American religious pluralism."&lt;ref&gt;Denny in [[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. p. preface.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting with a preface in which Berger explains how she first began studying the Wiccan and Pagan community of New England, Berger opens the main part of her book with a description of a [[Wiccaning]] which she attended.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. pp. 1&amp;ndash;3.&lt;/ref&gt; Proceeding to introduce both the Wiccan religion and her theoretical approach, Berger explains the British sociologist [[James A. Beckford]]'s approach to the religions of late modernity as well as [[Anthony Giddens]]' theoretical approaches to modernism.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. pp. 4&amp;ndash;12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second chapter, "The Magical Self", Berger examines the ways in which Wiccans in the U.S. understand themselves, looking at sociological ideas about self-identity and utilising them in her analysis of Wiccan rituals that deal with the transformation of the self. She moves on to look at concepts of [[gender]] in the Wiccan community, both for men and women and among homosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. pp. 26&amp;ndash;46.&lt;/ref&gt; The third chapter, entitled "The Coven: Perfect Love, Perfect Trust", provides an explanation of the coven system within Wicca, and the ways in which friendships are built and collapse amongst coven members, and the extent to which covens imitate family structures.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. pp. 47&amp;ndash;64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter four, "A Circle within a Circle: The Neo-Pagan Community", looks at the wider community beyond the coven structure, interpreting it through theoretical ideas about community in late modernity. Moving on, Berger looks at ideas of community memory and community building amongst U.S. Pagans, before examining the manner in which some Pagans engage in both emancipatory politics and life politics.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. pp. 65&amp;ndash;81.&lt;/ref&gt; The fifth chapter, entitled "The Next Generation", is devoted to the place of children within the Pagan community, and deals with ideas of rites of passage, attitudes towards children's sexuality and the extent to which children are involved in rituals.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. pp. 82&amp;ndash;99.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sixth chapter, "The Routinization of Creativity", looks at the relationship between Wicca and routinization, and examines how the anti-authoritarian ethos of the religion has been in part eroded through the creation of Pagan organisations like the EarthSpirit Community and the [[Circle Sanctuary]], which have purchased land and led to the development of a paid clergy.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. pp. 100&amp;ndash;122.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Berger concludes her work with a round-up of her study, and muses on the possible future for Wicca in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. pp. 123&amp;ndash;130.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments==

===Wicca as a religion of late modernity&lt;!--linked from 'Structuration theory'--&gt;===
[[File:Anthony Giddens at the Progressive Governance Converence, Budapest, Hungary, 2004 October.jpg|thumb|150px|The structuration theory of British sociologist Anthony Giddens played a significant influence on Berger's study.]]
Whereas the sociologist Loretta Orion had believed that contemporary Paganism was a [[postmodernism|postmodern]] movement,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ori95|Orion 1995]]. p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; in ''A Community of Witches'', Berger argued against this, instead considering Wicca to be a religion of [[late modernity]]. In supporting this position, Berger turned to the work of the British sociologist of religion, James A. Beckford (1942&amp;ndash;), who in his book ''Religion and Advanced Industrial Society'' (1989) had argued that many new religious movements reflect the characteristics of late modernity by challenging traditional definitions of religion, sharing a holistic worldview and emphasising the development and transformation of the self.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bec89|Beckford 1989]].&lt;/ref&gt; Berger stated that while "Wicca is not specifically mentioned by Beckford, it does fit the model of [[New Age]] religions that he is analyzing."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst accepting that elements of postmodernism can be found within Wicca, Berger argued that the religion does not "signify an epistemological break with [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thought", and that as such it was intrinsically late modernist in structure; as she related, the "emphasis on globalism, the belief in personal and social transformation, and the use of noninstrumental rationality place Wicca firmly within the Enlightenment tradition."&lt;ref name="Berger 1999 6"&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Berger's choice of "framework for understanding Wicca within the context of late modernity" was that of [[structuration]], a theory put forward by the English sociologist and political theorist [[Anthony Giddens, Baron Giddens|Anthony Giddens]] (1938&amp;ndash;) in his book ''The Constitution of Society'' (1984).&lt;ref name="Berger 1999 6"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gid84|Giddens 1984]].&lt;/ref&gt; Structuration theory maintains that both [[structure and agency]] influence human beings in their choices; the former refers to the recurrent patterned arrangements which influence or limit the choices and opportunities available for an individual, whilst the latter refers to the capacity of individuals to act independently and to make their own free choices. Berger argued that whilst the beliefs and practices of Wiccans were "in part determined by social factors, such as class, race and gender", at the same time these Wiccans exerted a level of control and self-determination over their lives "both by the very act of becoming a Witch and through the self-conscious use of rituals to create a persona."&lt;ref name="Berger 1999 8"&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wicca as a result of globalism===
Berger was of the opinion that Wicca's "development and spread" could be seen as "an outgrowth of [[globalism]]".&lt;ref name="Berger 1999 xiii"/&gt; As evidence, she noted that the religion had been created by modern westerners adopting elements from a variety of "older and geographically disparate religious practices" in order to fashion their new faith, something which she believed was only possible in a globalised world.&lt;ref name="Berger 1999 xiii"/&gt;

===The future of Wicca===
Whereas Mary Jo Neitz (1991) and Nancy J. Finley (1991) had both argued that ultimately, it would be the feminist-orientated, female-only form of Wicca found in the [[Dianic Wicca|Dianic tradition]] that would grow to become dominant in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nei91|Neitz 1991]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fin91|Finley 1991]].&lt;/ref&gt; Berger disagreed, arguing that "inclusive groups", meaning those traditions who welcome both men and women into their covens, "will ultimately prove to be more significant."&lt;ref name="Berger 1999 14"&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; She believed that this was in part because they "are more likely to include and fully involve children in their practices", something which she saw as having the likely "greatest impact" on the future of Wicca in the United States.&lt;ref name="Berger 1999 14"/&gt; In Berger's view, these children born into the faith would act as "maintainers of their families' practice", replacing the role that had formerly been played by neophytes in the community.&lt;ref name="Berger 1999 15"&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and recognition==

===Academic reviews===

In a review published in the ''Review of Religious Research'' journal, Stephen D. Glazier of the [[University of Nebraska]] described ''A Community of Witches'' as an "important study" which had "many virtues and few faults." Glazier commended it as an improvement on earlier sociological studies of contemporary Paganism, which in his opinion had dwelt on "personal experiences" and acted as something of "proselytizers for Neo-Pagan beliefs and practices." He furthermore praised Berger for "maintaining a high degree of theoretical sophistication" while still "remaining accessible for the average reader". He also expressed several criticisms, for instance noting that Berger had used the terms "Wiccan" and "Neo-Pagan" interchangeably, even though they have different meanings, something that he felt might confuse some of the book's readers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gla99|Glazier 1999]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In her review of ''A Community of Witches'' published in the ''Sociology of Religion'' journal, Frances Kostarelos of the [[Governors State University]] commented positively on Berger's work, describing it as "an invaluable theoretical and descriptive account of Wicca" that is also "a fine example of ethnographic research and writing."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kos99|Kostarelos 1999]].&lt;/ref&gt; Stefanie von Schnurbein of the [[University of Chicago]] described ''A Community of Witches'' as "an exciting and important approach to the study of contemporary neopaganism" in her review published in ''[[The Journal of Religion]]''. Schnurbein believed that Berger "has an intimate knowledge of her field and makes creative and interesting use of contemporary sociological theory" but that a "discussion of the vivid cultural and theoretical controversies around gender and sexuality would have added to the theoretical value of Berger's book."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch00|Schnurbein 2000]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in the ''[[Contemporary Sociology (journal)|Contemporary Sociology]]'' journal, Tanice G. Foltz of [[Indiana University Northwest]] described ''A Community of Witches'' as "Well organized, clearly written, and aimed at an academic audience". Believing it to be a "valuable addition to the existing scholarship on witchcraft", Foltz did highlight some problems with the work, wishing that it had included an "in-depth analysis" of her Pagan Census survey and noting that it erroneously used the terms "Neo-Paganism", "Witchcraft" and "Wicca" interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fol00|Foltz 2000]].&lt;/ref&gt; In her review for the ''[[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]]'', Mary Jo Neitz of the [[University of Missouri]] was more critical, arguing that Berger had generalised information from the north-eastern U.S. and claimed that it was applicable for the Pagan community across the entire country, something which Neitz felt was counter to her "own observations of Wicca."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nei00|Neitz 2000]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wider recognition===
''A Community of Witches'' was awarded the A List Exceptional Books of 1999 Award.&lt;ref&gt;[[#WSRC|Women's Studies Research Center]].&lt;/ref&gt; It was also mentioned by Canadian [[religious studies]] scholar Barbara Jane Davy in her 2007 work, ''[[Introduction to Pagan Studies]]'', during which she listed the books on Pagan Studies that had then seen publication.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dav07|Davy 2007]]. p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Berger's later work==
The publication of ''A Community of Witches'' did not signal the end of Berger's studies on the subject of American Paganism, and over the following several years she would publish several more volumes detailing her work in this area. In 2003, she co-authored a book delving deeper into the results of the Pagan Census that she had undertaken with Andras Corban Arthen. Entitled ''Voices from the Pagan Census: A National Survey of Witches and Neo-Pagans in the United States'', it was co-written with Leigh S. Shaffer, a fellow professor of sociology at West Chester University, and also with Evan A. Leach, then an associate professor of management at West Chester. Like ''A Community of Witches'', ''Voices from the Pagan Census'' was published by the University of South Carolina Press in their series on 'Studies in Comparative Religion', and in his preface to the book, the series editor Frederick M. Denny referred to it as the "sequel" to Berger's earlier work.&lt;ref name="Berger et al. xii"&gt;[[#Ber03|Berger, Leach and Shaffer 2003]]. p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

In their preface, Berger, Leach and Shaffer discussed the Pagan Census and how it had been used in producing ''A Community of Witches''; they noted that at the time Berger had originally written the book, "the rest of the data had not been completely processed, cleaned, and analyzed. Unlike that book, which relied primarily on her ethnographic research in the northeastern United States and an analysis of journals, books, and newsletters written by Neo-Pagans, this one is based primarily on the survey data."&lt;ref name="Berger et al. xvii"&gt;[[#Ber03|Berger, Leach and Shaffer 2003]]. p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[University of Pennsylvania]] published an edited anthology entitled ''Witchcraft and Magic in the New World: North America in the Twentieth Century'', which had been edited by Berger.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ber05|Berger 2005]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Berger's third book was published, ''Teenage Witches: Magical Youth and the Search for the Soul'', which had been co-written with Douglas Ezzy, a senior lecturer in sociology at the [[University of Tasmania]] in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ber07|Berger and Ezzy 2007]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Addressing modes''' are an aspect of the [[instruction set architecture]] in most [[central processing unit]] (CPU) designs. The various addressing modes that are defined in a given instruction set architecture define how [[machine code|machine language]] [[instruction (computer science)|instructions]] in that architecture identify the [[operand]](s) of each instruction. An addressing mode specifies how to calculate the effective [[memory address]] of an operand by using information held in [[processor register|register]]s and/or constants contained within a machine instruction or elsewhere.

In [[computer programming]], addressing modes are primarily of interest to [[compiler]] writers and to those who write in [[assembly language]]s.

==Caveats==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}
Note that there is no generally accepted way of naming the various addressing modes. In particular, different authors and computer manufacturers may give different names to the same addressing mode, or the same names to different addressing modes. Furthermore, an addressing mode which, in one given architecture, is treated as a single addressing mode may represent functionality that, in another architecture, is covered by two or more addressing modes. For example, some [[complex instruction set computer]] (CISC) architectures, such as the [[Digital Equipment Corporation|Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC)]] [[VAX]], treat registers and [[value (computer science)|literal or immediate constants]] as just another addressing mode. Others, such as the [[IBM System/360]] and its successors, and most [[reduced instruction set computing|reduced instruction set computer]] (RISC) designs, encode this information within the instruction. Thus, the latter machines have three distinct instruction codes for copying one register to another, copying a literal constant into a register, and copying the contents of a memory location into a register, while the VAX has only a single "MOV" instruction.

The term "addressing mode" is itself subject to different interpretations: either "memory address calculation mode" or "operand accessing mode". Under the first interpretation, instructions that do not read from memory or write to memory (such as "add literal to register") are considered not to have an "addressing mode". The second interpretation allows for machines such as VAX which use operand mode bits to allow for a register or for a literal operand. Only the first interpretation applies to instructions such as "load effective address".

The addressing modes listed below are divided into code addressing and data addressing. Most computer architectures maintain this distinction, but there are, or have been, some architectures which allow (almost) all addressing modes to be used in any context.

The instructions shown below are purely representative in order to illustrate the addressing modes, and do not necessarily reflect the mnemonics used by any particular computer.

==Number of addressing modes==
Different computer architectures vary greatly as to the number of addressing modes they provide in hardware. There are some benefits to eliminating complex addressing modes and using only one or a few simpler addressing modes, even though it requires a few extra instructions, and perhaps an extra register.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=36204.36193|title=How many addressing modes are enough?|author1=F.

Lipasti |year=2004 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill Professional]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; much easier to design [[instruction pipeline|pipelined]] CPUs if the only addressing modes available are simple ones.

Most RISC architectures have only about five simple addressing modes, while CISC architectures such as the DEC VAX have over a dozen addressing modes, some of which are quite complicated. The IBM [[System/360]] architecture had only three addressing modes; a few more have been added for the [[System/390]].

When there are only a few addressing modes, the particular addressing mode required is usually encoded within the instruction code
(e.g. IBM System/360 and successors, most RISC). But when there are lots of addressing modes, a specific field is often set aside in the instruction to specify the addressing mode. The DEC VAX allowed multiple memory operands for almost all instructions, and so reserved the first few [[bit]]s of each operand specifier to indicate the addressing mode for that particular operand.
Keeping the addressing mode specifier bits separate from the opcode operation bits produces an [[orthogonal instruction set]].

Even on a computer with many addressing modes, measurements of actual programs&lt;ref name="hennessy-patterson-c54x"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XX69oNsazH4C&amp;pg=PA104#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach|author1=John L.

Since most such measurements are based on code generated from high-level languages by compilers, this reflects to some extent the limitations of the compilers being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~tahar/coen6741/notes/Chapter2-4p.pdf|title=Instruction Set Principles: Addressing Mode Usage (Summary)|author=Dr. Sofiène Tahar|quote=3 programs measured on machine with all address modes (VAX) ... 75% displacement and immediate|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930125040/http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~tahar/coen6741/notes/Chapter2-4p.pdf|archive-date=2011-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hennessy-patterson-c54x"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Efficient and Language-Independent Mobile Programs|author1=Ali-Reza Adl-Tabatabai|author2=Geoff Langdale|author3=Steven Lucco|author4=Robert Wahbe|year=1995|quote=79% of all instructions executed could be replaced by RISC instructions or synthesized into RISC instructions using only basic block instruction combination.|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=231402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Useful side effect==
Some instruction set architectures, such as [[Intel x86]] and IBM/360 and its successors, have a '''load effective address''' instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This performs a calculation of the effective operand address, but instead of acting on that memory location, it loads the address that would have been accessed into a register. This can be useful when passing the address of an array element to a subroutine. It may also be a slightly sneaky way of doing more calculations than normal in one instruction; for example, using such an instruction with the addressing mode "base+index+offset" (detailed below) allows one to add two registers and a constant together in one instruction.

==Simple addressing modes for code==

===Absolute or direct===
    +----+------------------------------+
    |jump|           address            |
    +----+------------------------------+
 
    (Effective PC address = address)

The effective address for an absolute instruction address is the address parameter itself with no modifications.

===PC-relative===
    +----+------------------------------+
    |jump|           offset             |    jump relative
    +----+------------------------------+
 
    (Effective PC address = next instruction address + offset, offset may be negative)

The effective address for a [[program counter|PC]]-relative instruction address is the offset parameter added to the address of the next instruction. This offset is usually signed to allow reference to code both before and after the instruction.

This is particularly useful in connection with jumps, because typical jumps are to nearby instructions (in a high-level language most '''if''' or '''while''' statements are reasonably short). Measurements of actual programs suggest that an 8 or 10 bit offset is large enough for some 90% of conditional jumps (roughly &amp;plusmn;128 or &amp;plusmn;512 bytes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=Kong and Patterson|title=Instruction set design|year=1995|at=Slide 27|url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~pattrsn/152/lec3.ps}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another advantage of PC-relative addressing is that the code may be [[position independent code|position-independent]], i.e. it can be loaded anywhere in memory without the need to adjust any addresses.

Some versions of this addressing mode may be conditional referring to two registers ("jump if reg1=reg2"),
one register ("jump unless reg1=0") or no registers, implicitly referring to some previously-set bit in the [[status register]]. See also [[#conditional execution|conditional execution]] below.

===Register indirect===
    +-------+-----+
    |jumpVia| reg |
    +-------+-----+
 
    (Effective PC address = contents of register 'reg')

The effective address for a Register indirect instruction is the address in the specified register. For example, (A7) to access the content of address register A7.

The effect is to transfer control to the instruction whose address is in the specified register.

Many RISC machines, as well as the CISC [[IBM System/360]] and successors, have subroutine call instructions that place the [[return statement|return address]] in an address register—the register-indirect addressing mode is used to return from that subroutine call.

==Sequential addressing modes==

===Sequential execution===
    +------+
    | nop  |              execute the following instruction
    +------+
 
    (Effective PC address = next instruction address)

The CPU, after executing a sequential instruction, immediately executes the following instruction.

Sequential execution is not considered to be an addressing mode on some computers.

Most instructions on most CPU architectures are sequential instructions.
Because most instructions are sequential instructions, CPU designers often add features that deliberately sacrifice performance on the other instructions—branch instructions—in order to make these sequential instructions run faster.

Conditional branches load the PC with one of 2 possible results, depending on the condition—most CPU architectures use some other addressing mode for the "taken" branch, and sequential execution for the "not taken" branch.

Many features in modern CPUs -- [[instruction prefetch]] and more complex [[pipeline (computing)|pipeline]]ing, [[out-of-order execution]], etc. -- maintain the illusion that each instruction finishes before the next one begins, giving the same final results, even though that's not exactly what happens internally.

Each "[[basic block]]" of such sequential instructions exhibits both temporal and spatial [[locality of reference]].

====CPUs that do not use sequential execution====
CPUs that do not use sequential execution with a program counter are extremely rare. In some CPUs, each instruction always specifies the address of next instruction. Such CPUs have an instruction pointer that holds that specified address; it is not a program counter because there is no provision for incrementing it. Such CPUs include some [[drum memory]] computers such as the [[IBM 650]], the [[SECD machine]], and the RTX 32P.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/stack_computers/sec5_3.html "Architecture of the RTX 32P"]
by Philip Koopman 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Other computing architectures go much further, attempting to bypass the [[von Neumann architecture#Von Neumann bottleneck|von Neumann bottleneck]] using a variety of [[program counter#Consequences in machine architecture|alternatives to the program counter]].

===Conditional execution===
Some computer architectures have conditional instructions (such as [[ARM architecture|ARM]], but no longer for all instructions in 64-bit mode) or conditional load instructions (such as x86) which can in some cases make conditional branches unnecessary and avoid flushing the [[instruction pipeline]].  An instruction such as a 'compare' is used to set a [[status register|condition code]], and subsequent instructions include a test on that condition code to see whether they are obeyed or ignored.

===Skip===
    +------+-----+-----+
    |skipEQ| reg1| reg2|      skip the next instruction if reg1=reg2
    +------+-----+-----+
 
    (Effective PC address = next instruction address + 1)

Skip addressing may be considered a special kind of PC-relative addressing mode with a fixed "+1" offset. Like PC-relative addressing, some CPUs have versions of this addressing mode that only refer to one register ("skip if reg1=0") or no registers, implicitly referring to some previously-set bit in the [[status register]]. Other CPUs have a version that selects a specific bit in a specific byte to test ("skip if bit 7 of reg12 is 0").

Unlike all other conditional branches, a "skip" instruction never needs to flush the [[instruction pipeline]], though it may need to cause the next instruction to be ignored.

==Simple addressing modes for data==

==={{anchor|REGISTER PLUS REGISTER}}Register (or Register Direct)===
    +------+-----+-----+-----+
    | mul  | reg1| reg2| reg3|      reg1 := reg2 * reg3;
    +------+-----+-----+-----+

This "addressing mode" does not have an effective address and is not considered to be an addressing mode on some computers.

In this example, all the operands are in registers, and the result is placed in a register.

==={{anchor|REGISTER PLUS IMMIEDIATE CONSTANT}}Base plus offset, and variations===
This is sometimes referred to as 'base plus displacement'
    +------+-----+-----+----------------+
    | load | reg | base|     offset     |  reg := RAM[base + offset]
    +------+-----+-----+----------------+
 
    (Effective address = offset + contents of specified base register)

The [[offset (computer science)|offset]] is usually a signed 16-bit value (though the [[80386]] expanded it to 32 bits).

If the offset is zero, this becomes an example of ''register indirect'' addressing; the effective address is just the value in the base register.

On many RISC machines, register&amp;nbsp;0 is fixed at the value zero. If register&amp;nbsp;0 is used as the base register, this becomes an example of ''absolute addressing''. However, only a small portion of memory can be accessed (64 [[kilobyte]]s, if the offset is 16 bits).

The 16-bit offset may seem very small in relation to the size of current computer memories (which is why the [[80386]] expanded it to 32-bit). It could be worse: IBM System/360 mainframes only have an unsigned 12-bit offset. However, the principle of [[locality of reference]] applies: over a short time span, most of the data items a program wants to access are fairly close to each other.

This addressing mode is closely related to the indexed absolute addressing mode.

''Example 1'':
Within a subroutine a programmer will mainly be interested in the parameters and the local variables, which will rarely exceed 64 [[kilobyte|KB]], for which one base register (the [[frame pointer]]) suffices. If this routine is a class method in an object-oriented language, then a second base register is needed which points at the attributes for the current object ('''this''' or '''self''' in some high level languages).

''Example 2'':
If the base register contains the address of a [[composite type]] (a record or structure), the offset can be used to select a field from that record (most records/structures are less than 32 kB in size).

===Immediate/literal===
    +------+-----+-----+----------------+
    | add  | reg1| reg2|    constant    |    reg1 := reg2 + constant;
    +------+-----+-----+----------------+

This "addressing mode" does not have an effective address, and is not considered to be an addressing mode on some computers.

The constant might be signed or unsigned. For example, &lt;code&gt;move.l #$FEEDABBA, D0&lt;/code&gt; to move the immediate hex value of "FEEDABBA" into register D0.

Instead of using an operand from memory, the value of the operand is held within the instruction itself. On the DEC VAX machine, the literal operand sizes could be 6, 8, 16, or 32 bits long.

[[Andrew S. Tanenbaum|Andrew Tanenbaum]] showed that 98% of all the constants in a program would fit in 13 bits (see [[Reduced instruction set computer#RISC design philosophy|RISC design philosophy]]).

===Implicit===
    +-----------------+
    | clear carry bit |
    +-----------------+
 
    +-------------------+
    | clear Accumulator |
    +-------------------+
The implied addressing mode, also called the implicit addressing mode ([[X86 assembly language]]), does not explicitly specify an effective address for either the source or the destination (or sometimes both).

Either the source (if any) or destination effective address (or sometimes both) is implied by the opcode.

Implied addressing was quite common on older computers (up to mid-1970s). Such computers typically had only a single register in which arithmetic could be performed—the accumulator. Such [[accumulator machine]]s implicitly reference that accumulator in almost every instruction. For example, the operation &lt; a := b + c; &gt; can be done using the sequence &lt; load b; add c; store a; &gt; -- the destination (the accumulator) is implied in every "load" and "add" instruction; the source (the accumulator) is implied in every "store" instruction.

Later computers generally had more than one [[general purpose register]] or RAM location which could be the source or destination or both for arithmetic—and so later computers need some other addressing mode to specify the source and destination of arithmetic.

Among the x86 instructions, some use implicit registers for one of the operands or results (multiplication, division, counting conditional jump).

Many computers (such as x86 and AVR) have one special-purpose register called the [[stack pointer]] which is implicitly incremented or decremented when pushing or popping data from the stack, and the source or destination effective address is (implicitly) the address stored in that stack pointer.

Many 32-bit computers (such as 68000, ARM, or PowerPC) have more than one register which could be used as a stack pointer—and so use the "register autoincrement indirect" addressing mode to specify which of those registers should be used when pushing or popping data from a stack.

Some current computer architectures (e.g. IBM/390 and Intel Pentium) contain some instructions with implicit operands in order to maintain backwards compatibility with earlier designs.

On many computers, instructions that flip the user/system mode bit, the interrupt-enable bit, etc. implicitly specify the special register that holds those bits. This simplifies the hardware necessary to trap those instructions in order to meet the [[Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements]]—on such a system, the trap logic does not need to look at any operand (or at the final effective address), but only at the opcode.

A few CPUs have been designed where every operand is always implicitly specified in every instruction -- [[Instruction set#Number of operands|zero-operand]] CPUs.

==Other addressing modes for code or data==

===Absolute/direct===
    +------+-----+--------------------------------------+
    | load | reg |         address                      |
    +------+-----+--------------------------------------+
 
    (Effective address = address as given in instruction)

This requires space in an instruction for quite a large address. It is often available on CISC machines which have variable-length instructions, such as [[x86]].

Some RISC machines have a special ''Load Upper Literal'' instruction which places a 16- or 20-bit constant in the top half of a register.  That can then be used as the base register in a base-plus-offset addressing mode which supplies the low-order 16 or 12 bits.  The combination allows a full 32-bit address.

===Indexed absolute===
    +------+-----+-----+--------------------------------+
    | load | reg |index|         address                |
    +------+-----+-----+--------------------------------+
 
    (Effective address = address + contents of specified index register)

This also requires space in an instruction for quite a large address. The address could be the start of an array or vector, and the index could select the particular array element required. The processor may scale the index register to allow for the [[stride of an array|size of each array element]].

Note that this is more or less the same as base-plus-offset addressing mode, except that the offset in this case is large enough to address any memory location.

''Example 1'':
Within a subroutine, a programmer may define a string as a local constant or a [[static variable]].
The address of the string is stored in the literal address in the instruction.
The offset—which character of the string to use on this iteration of a loop—is stored in the index register.

''Example 2'':
A programmer may define several large arrays as globals or as [[field (computer science)|class variables]].
The start of the array is stored in the literal address (perhaps modified at program-load time by a [[relocating loader]]) of the instruction that references it.
The offset—which item from the array to use on this iteration of a loop—is stored in the index register.
Often the instructions in a loop re-use the same register for the loop counter and the offsets of several arrays.

===Base plus index===
    +------+-----+-----+-----+
    | load | reg | base|index|
    +------+-----+-----+-----+
 
    (Effective address = contents of specified base register + contents of specified index register)

The base register could contain the start address of an array or vector, and the index could select the particular array element required. The processor may scale the [[index register]] to allow for the [[stride of an array|size of each array element]]. This could be used for accessing elements of an array passed as a parameter.

===Base plus index plus offset===
    +------+-----+-----+-----+----------------+
    | load | reg | base|index|         offset |
    +------+-----+-----+-----+----------------+
 
    (Effective address = offset + contents of specified base register + contents of specified index register)

The base register could contain the start address of an array or vector of records, the index could select the particular record required, and the offset could select a field within that record. The processor may scale the index register to allow for the [[stride of an array|size of each array element]].

===Scaled===
    +------+-----+-----+-----+
    | load | reg | base|index|
    +------+-----+-----+-----+
 
    (Effective address = contents of specified base register + scaled contents of specified index register)

The base register could contain the start address of an array or [[vector data structure]], and the index could contain the offset of the one particular array element required.

This addressing mode dynamically scales the value in the index register to allow for the size of each array element, e.g. if the array elements are double precision floating-point numbers occupying 8 bytes each then the value in the index register is multiplied by 8 before being used in the effective address calculation. The scale factor is normally restricted to being a [[power of two]], so that [[bit shift|shifting]] rather than multiplication can be used.

===Register indirect===
    +------+------+-----+
    | load | reg1 | base|
    +------+------+-----+
  
    (Effective address = contents of base register)

A few computers have this as a distinct addressing mode. Many computers just use ''base plus offset'' with an offset value of 0. For example, (A7)

===Register autoincrement indirect===
    +------+-----+-------+
    | load | reg | base  |
    +------+-----+-------+
 
    (Effective address = contents of base register)

After determining the effective address, the value in the base register is incremented by the size of the data item that is to be accessed. For example, (A7)+ would access the content of the address register A7, then increase the address pointer of A7 by 1 (usually 1 word). Within a loop, this addressing mode can be used to step through all the elements of an array or vector.

In high-level languages it is often thought to be a good idea that functions which return a result should not have [[side effect (computer science)|side effects]] (lack of side effects makes program understanding and validation much easier). This addressing mode has a side effect in that the base register is altered. If the subsequent memory access causes an error (e.g. page fault, bus error, address error) leading to an interrupt, then restarting the instruction becomes much more problematic since one or more registers may need to be set back to the state they were in before the instruction originally started.

There have been at least two computer architectures which have had implementation problems with regard to recovery from interrupts when this addressing mode is used:
*Motorola 68000 (address is represented in 24 bits). Could have one or two autoincrement register operands. The [[68010]]+ resolved the problem by saving the processor's internal state on [[bus error|bus]] or address errors.
*DEC VAX. Could have up to 6 autoincrement register operands. Each operand access could cause two [[page fault]]s (if operands happened to straddle a page boundary). Of course the instruction itself could be over 50 bytes long and might straddle a page boundary as well!

===Register autodecrement indirect===
    +------+-----+-----+
    | load | reg | base|
    +------+-----+-----+
 
    (Effective address = new contents of base register)

Before determining the effective address, the value in the base register is decremented by the size of the data item which is to be accessed.

Within a loop, this addressing mode can be used to step backwards through all the elements of an array or vector. A stack can be implemented by using this mode in conjunction with the previous addressing mode (autoincrement).

See the discussion of side-effects under the [[#Register autoincrement indirect|autoincrement addressing mode]].

===Memory indirect===
Any of the addressing modes mentioned in this article could have an extra bit to indicate indirect addressing, i.e. the address calculated using some mode is in fact the address of a location (typically a complete [[word (data type)|word]]) which contains the actual effective address.

Indirect addressing may be used for code or data. It can make implementation of ''pointers'', ''references'', or ''[[handle (computing)|handle]]s'' much easier, and can also make it easier to call subroutines which are not otherwise addressable. Indirect addressing does carry a performance penalty due to the extra memory access involved.

Some early minicomputers (e.g. DEC [[PDP-8]], [[Data General Nova]]) had only a few registers and only a limited addressing range (8 bits). Hence the use of memory indirect addressing was almost the only way of referring to any significant amount of memory.

===PC-relative===
    +------+------+---------+----------------+
    | load | reg1 | base=PC |     offset     |
    +------+------+---------+----------------+
 
    reg1 := RAM[PC + offset]
    (Effective address = PC + offset)

The PC-relative addressing mode can be used to load a register with a value stored in program memory a short distance away from the current instruction. It can be seen as a special case of the "base plus offset" addressing mode, one that selects the program counter (PC) as the "base register".

There are a few CPUs that support PC-relative data references. Such CPUs include:

The [[x86-64]] architecture and the 64-bit [[ARMv8-A]] architecture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://quequero.org/2014/04/introduction-to-arm-architecture/|title=Introduction to ARMv8 64-bit Architecture}}&lt;/ref&gt; have PC-relative addressing modes, called "RIP-relative" in x86-64 and "literal" in ARMv8-A.  The [[Motorola 6809]] also supports a PC-relative addressing mode.

The [[PDP-11]] architecture, the [[VAX]] architecture, and the 32-bit [[ARM architecture]]s support PC-relative addressing by having the PC in the register file.

When this addressing mode is used, the compiler typically places the constants in a [[literal pool]] immediately before or immediately after the subroutine that uses them, to prevent accidentally executing those constants as instructions.

This addressing mode, which always fetches data from memory or stores data to memory and then sequentially falls through to execute the next instruction (the effective address points to data), should not be confused with "PC-relative branch" which does not fetch data from or store data to memory, but instead branches to some other instruction at the given offset (the effective address points to an executable instruction).

==Obsolete addressing modes==
The addressing modes listed here were used in the 1950–1980 period, but are no longer available on most current computers.
This list is by no means complete; there have been many other interesting and peculiar addressing modes used from time to time, e.g.  absolute-minus-logical-OR of two or three index registers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/704/24-6661-2_704_Manual_1955.pdf|title=704 Electronic Data-Processing Machine Manual of Operation|pages=10–11|publisher=[[IBM]]|year=1955}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/7090/22-6528-4_7090Manual.pdf|title=Reference Manual IBM 7090 Data Processing System|pages=9–10|publisher=IBM|year=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multi-level memory indirect===
If the word size is larger than the address, then the word referenced for memory-indirect addressing could itself have an indirect flag set to indicate another memory indirect cycle. This flag is referred to as an '''indirection bit''', and the resulting pointer is a [[tagged pointer]], the indirection bit tagging whether it is a direct pointer or an indirect pointer. Care is needed to ensure that a chain of indirect addresses does not refer to itself; if it does, one can get an [[infinite loop]] while trying to resolve an address.

The [[IBM 1620]], the [[Data General Nova]], the [[HP 2100]] series, and the [[NAR 2]] each have such a multi-level memory indirect, and could enter such an infinite address calculation loop.
The memory indirect addressing mode on the Nova influenced the invention of [[threaded code#Development of Threaded Code|indirect threaded code]].

The DEC [[PDP-10]] computer with [[18-bit]] addresses and 36-bit words allowed multi-level indirect addressing with the possibility of using an index register at each stage as well.

===Memory-mapped registers===
On some computers, the registers were regarded as occupying the first 8 or 16 words of memory (e.g. [[ICT 1900 series|ICL 1900]], DEC PDP-10). This meant that there was no need for a separate "add register to register" instruction – one could just use the "add memory to register" instruction.

In the case of early models of the PDP-10, which did not have any cache memory, a tight inner loop loaded into the first few words of memory (where the fast registers were addressable if installed) ran much faster than it would have in magnetic core memory.

Later models of the DEC [[PDP-11]] series mapped the registers onto addresses in the input/output area, but this was primarily intended to allow remote diagnostics. Confusingly, the 16-bit registers were mapped onto consecutive 8-bit byte addresses.

===Memory indirect and autoincrement===
The DEC [[PDP-8]] minicomputer had eight special locations (at addresses 8 through 15). When accessed via memory indirect addressing, these locations would automatically increment after use.&lt;ref&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made it easy to step through memory in a loop without needing to use any registers to handle the steps.

The [[Data General Nova]] minicomputer had 16 special memory locations at addresses 16 through 31.&lt;ref&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt; When accessed via memory indirect addressing, 16 through 23 would automatically increment before use, and 24 through 31 would automatically decrement before use.

===Zero page===
The [[Data General Nova]], [[Motorola 6800]] family, and [[MOS Technology 6502]] family of processors had very few internal registers. Arithmetic and logical instructions were mostly performed against values in memory as opposed to internal registers. As a result, many instructions required a two-byte (16-bit) location to memory. Given that opcodes on these processors were only one byte (8 bits) in length, memory addresses could make up a significant part of code size.

Designers of these processors included a partial remedy known as "zero page" addressing. The initial 256 bytes of memory ($0000 – $00FF; a.k.a., page "0") could be accessed using a one-byte absolute or indexed memory address. This reduced instruction execution time by one clock cycle and instruction length by one byte. By storing often-used data in this region, programs could be made smaller and faster.

As a result, the zero page was used similarly to a register file. On many systems, however, this resulted in high utilization of the zero page memory area by the operating system and user programs, which limited its use since free space was limited.

===Direct page===
The zero page address mode was enhanced in several late model 8-bit processors, including the [[WDC 65816]], the [[CSG 65CE02]], and the [[Motorola 6809]]. The new mode, known as "direct page" addressing, added the ability to move the 256-byte zero page memory window from the start of memory (offset address $0000) to a new location within the first 64&amp;nbsp;KB of memory.

The CSG 65CE02 allowed the direct page to be moved to any 256-byte boundary within the first 64&amp;nbsp;KB of memory by storing an 8-bit offset value in the new base page (B) register. The Motorola 6809 could do the same with its direct page (DP) register. The WDC 65816 went a step further and allowed the direct page to be moved to any location within the first 64&amp;nbsp;KB of memory by storing a 16-bit offset value in the new direct (D) register.

As a result, a greater number of programs were able to utilize the enhanced direct page addressing mode versus legacy processors that only included the zero page addressing mode.

===Scaled index with bounds checking===
This is similar to scaled index addressing, except that the instruction has two extra operands (typically constants), and the hardware checks that the index value is between these bounds.

Another variation uses vector descriptors to hold the bounds; this makes it easy to implement dynamically allocated arrays and still have full bounds checking.

===Register indirect to byte within word===
The DEC [[PDP-10]] computer used [[36-bit]] words. It had special instructions which allowed memory to be treated as a sequence of bytes (bytes could be any size from 1 bit to 36 bits). A one-word sequence descriptor in memory, called a "byte pointer", held the current word address within the sequence, a bit position within a word, and the size of each byte.

Instructions existed to load and store bytes via this descriptor, and to increment the descriptor to point at the next byte (bytes were not split across word boundaries). Much DEC software used five 7-bit bytes per word (plain ASCII characters), with one bit per word unused. Implementations of [[C (programming language)|C]] had to use four 9-bit bytes per word, since the 'malloc' function in C assumes that the size of an ''int'' is some multiple of the size of a ''char'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.codingunit.com/c-reference-stdlib-h-function-malloc "C Reference: function malloc()"]&lt;/ref&gt; the actual multiple is determined by the system-dependent compile-time operator [[sizeof]].

===Index next instruction===
The [[Elliott 503]],&lt;ref name="brooks"&gt;Dave Brooks. [https://web.archive.org/web/20141101211113/http://members.iinet.com.au/~daveb/history.html#puzzle "Some Old Computers"].&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Elliott 803]],&lt;ref name="brooks"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bill Purvis. [https://web.archive.org/web/20080616173228/http://bil.members.beeb.net/inst803.html "Some details of the Elliott 803B hardware"]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Apollo Guidance Computer]] only used absolute addressing, and did not have any index registers.
Thus, indirect jumps, or jumps through registers, were not supported in the instruction set. Instead, it could be instructed to ''add the contents of the current memory word to the next instruction''. Adding a small value to the next instruction to be executed could, for example, change a &lt;code&gt;JUMP 0&lt;/code&gt; into a &lt;code&gt;JUMP 20&lt;/code&gt;, thus creating the effect of an indexed jump. Note that the instruction is modified on-the-fly and remains unchanged in memory, i.e. it is not [[self-modifying code]]. If the value being added to the next instruction was large enough, it could modify the opcode of that instruction as well as or instead of the address.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16948">'''Business education''' involves teaching students the fundamentals, theories, and processes of [[business]]. Education in this field occurs at several levels, including [[secondary education]] and [[higher education]] or [[university]] education.  Approximately 38% of students enroll in one or more business courses during their high school tenure.

==Secondary education==
{{Main|Business studies}}

Business is taught as an academic subject at [[secondary education|secondary]] level in many countries, including [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Hong Kong]], [[India]], [[Ireland]], [[Lesotho]], [[Nepal]], [[New Zealand]], [[Pakistan]], [[Nigeria]], [[South Africa]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Argentina]], [[Sweden]], [[Tanzania]], [[Malaysia]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. At pre-tertiary level, it is often called '''Business Studies''', and usually combines elements of [[accountancy]], [[finance]], [[marketing]], [[organizational studies]], [[human resource management]] and [[economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sh.se/p3/ext/content.nsf/aget?openagent&amp;key=about_the_subject_1298025420871|title=Business studies|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Undergraduate education==
At the [[university]] level, students have the opportunity to take [[undergraduate degree]]s, usually a [[bachelor's degree]], in business and management. Specific curricula and degree-granting procedures differ by program and by region.  In general though, the program will comprise either preparation for management and general business, or a detailed - more academic - focus on a specific area. Regardless, all will typically include basic selections such as Accounting, Marketing, Finance, and [[Operations Management]].

Management-directed programs&lt;ref&gt;See for example BBA program outlines at: [https://www.uregina.ca/admin/academic/business_school/majors.htm uregina.ca]; [http://iitrade.ac.in/courses.asp?detail=bba Institute of International Trade]&lt;/ref&gt; are designed to give a broad knowledge of the functional areas of a company, and their interconnection, and also to develop the student's practical managerial skills, communication skills and business decision-making capability. These programs thus incorporate [[training]] and practical experience, in the form of [[case study|case projects]], presentations, [[internship]]s, industrial visits, and interaction with experts from the industry.

Subject specific programs, on the other hand, focus on a particular area, and are often more weighted towards theory. Even in these cases, however, additional to their [[academic major|major]], students are exposed to general business principles, taking initial courses in accounting/finance, human resources, statistics, marketing, economics, and information systems.

Degrees offered here include:
* The [[Bachelor of Business Administration]] (BBA) degree is awarded to students who complete three to four years of full-time study in [[business administration]]. The degree often, though not always, requires a major in a specific field such as [[accountancy|accounting]], finance, [[human resource management|HRM/personnel]], marketing, [[management]], [[management information systems]], [[real estate]], [[strategic management]], or others. Similar programs include the [[Bachelor of Science in Business Administration]] (BSBA), a quantitative variant on the BBA, [[Bachelor of Science in Business]] and [[Bachelor of Administrative Studies]] degrees. The [[Bachelor of Public Administration]] (BPA) is an [[undergraduate degree]] in [[public administration]]. The [[Bachelor of Business Management]]/[[Bachelor of Management Studies]] are similar to the BBA, but with a stronger emphasis on leadership and management skills.
* The Bachelor of International Business economics (BIBE) degree is awarded to students who complete four years of full-time study in business administration. In the last 2 years students must choose a specific field (such as the ones mentioned in the BBA). This degree is taught only in English and its aim is to enable students to work abroad and be prepared to manage large, multinational firms. It is compulsory to study abroad for at least 6 months. This degree appeared with the Bologna Process in Europe and is taught in universities like the [[Pompeu Fabra University]].
* The [[Bachelor of Commerce]] (B.Com, or B.Comm; [[Bachelor of Commerce and Administration]] (BCA) is an alternate title) is, likewise, an undergraduate degree in general [[business management]], although it is more theory-based and usually incorporates an [[Bachelor of Commerce#Areas of study|academic major]]. The distinction between the B.Comm and the BBA, then, is often that the latter specifically applies theories to real-life business situations, while the former concentrates more broadly on a wide range of ideas and concepts in [[commerce]] and related subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBA and BCom: What's the difference? |url=http://www.news.utoronto.ca/bba-amd-bcom-whats-difference |publisher=University of Toronto – News@UofT |website=News.utoronto.ca |date=10 June 2008 |accessdate=8 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628141733/http://www.news.utoronto.ca/social-sciences-business-law/bba-amd-bcom-whats-the-difference.html |archivedate=28 June 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Bachelor of Business]] (B.Bus or B.Bus (Major)) degree is an undergraduate degree in general business management offered by universities in Australia, Ireland and New Zealand. Similar in nature to the Bachelor of Commerce degree, Bachelor of Business degrees are often awarded at technology-focused universities in accordance with the Dawkins review (1986) of the Australian higher education sector. At many Australian universities, a Bachelor of Business degree enables graduates to undertake greater specialty in their chosen academic major as compared to a general BBA degree.
* The [[Bachelor of Management and Organizational Studies]] degree (BMOS in Canada) is a four-year undergraduate degree in business management. However, this degree teaches knowledge-based business and is as much theoretical as it is case-based. The BMOS degree especially emphasizes social sciences such as psychology, sociology, economics, etc.
* The [[Bachelor of Business Science]] (B.Bus.Sc) degree is similar to the BCom. However, it is a four-year honors-level course with an increased focus on the major and covers [[list of management topics|management theory]] in further depth. Also, students taking this approach are able to major in various quantitative disciplines not (typically) available in the B.Comm or BBA; related to this—and similarly in distinction—''all'' B.Bus.Sc students require a full first-year [[mathematics]] course, and in addition to this, courses in statistics.
* The [[Bachelor of Accountancy]] (B.Acy or B.Acc or B. Accty) degree is a specialized degree in accountancy; it is often the principal (or only) undergraduate degree [[First professional degree#Professional degrees|recognized for later professional practice]]. It is distinct from a BBA or B.Comm with a major in accountancy in that the entire program is focused on accountancy, while other topics are supplementary. It is also known as Bachelor of Accounting, Bachelor of Accounting Science, or Bachelor of Comptrolling (B.Acc.Sci or B.Compt).
* The [[Bachelor of Economics]] (B.Ec, B.Econ.Sc; sometimes BA (Econ), B.Sc (Econ), B.S.Sc (Econ) or BBA (Econ)) degree is similarly a specialized degree in the field of economics. Courses may last anywhere from three years to six years and are typically more [[theoretical]] and [[mathematical]] than the BBA or B.Comm with a major in economics (often substantially so). Economics is not a business discipline ''per se'' but a social science, and economics degrees are therefore often offered through liberal arts colleges.
* There are various other specialized business degrees such as the [[Bachelor of Finance and Banking]]. A further example is the [[Bachelor of Arts in Organizational Management]] (BAOM) degree, which is awarded to students who complete a four-year course of study in the field. The core functions of this program are the teaching of organizational functions, communication, group behavior, decision-making, human resources management, ethics, and to develop and deploy in the students effective skills in management and leadership. Also offered are the [[Bachelor of Science in Business Education]] (BSBE), an undergraduate degree in [[the teaching of business]] and the [[Bachelor of Business Teacher Education]] (BBTE), a variant on the BSBE.

==Postgraduate education==
At the [[graduate school]] level, students seek a variety of [[master's degrees]], either in [[general management]]–very commonly the [[MBA]]–or in a specific area, such as marketing or finance.  A further distinction is that students pursuing postgraduate degrees often have some business experience, although this is not always a program requirement. 

Corresponding to both of these, graduate degrees in business and management are generally of two sorts. 
* On the one hand, programs such as the Master of Science (M.Sc) or Arts (MA) or Commerce (M.Com) in General Management (sometimes also called Master in Management, or MIM) usually do not require professional experience. (Often the M.Sc in Management is for graduates with a first academic degree in a social science, while the MA in Management is for other backgrounds. The Master of Engineering Management, MEM, is aimed at graduates with an engineering background.) 
* On the other hand, the [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) requires a minimum of two to three years of professional experience and is open for graduates from any field. 

A related distinction: the M.Sc in Management is more specialized than an MBA, and is more suited for academic research, while the MBA is more industry- and management-focused. 

As regards degree structure, postgraduate business programs are, in general, designed such that students gain exposure to theory and practice alike;&lt;ref&gt;See for example: [http://www.hbs.edu/mba/academic-experience/Pages/the-hbs-case-method.aspx "The HBS case-method", hbs.edu]; [http://www.chicagobooth.edu/about/chicago-approach "The Chicago Approach", chicagobooth.edu]; [http://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/programmes/mba/learning/practical-learning/ "Practical Learning", jbs.cam.ac.uk]; [http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/programs/mba/academic-experience "Academic Experience", gsb.stanford.edu].&lt;/ref&gt; the mix, though, will differ by degree and by school,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronaldyeaple/2012/07/09/is-the-mba-case-method-passe/ Is the MBA Case Method Passé?] [[forbes.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; as discussed. Learning is then through lectures, case studies, and often team projects (“syndicate” work). The theory is covered in the classroom setting by [[Professor|academic faculty]]. Particularly in the MBA, the theory is then reinforced, and revisited, also in the classroom setting, through the [[case method]], placing the student in the role of the decision maker, "complete with the constraints and incomplete information found in real business issues." Practical learning often comprises [[Management consulting|consulting project]]s with real clients, or at least addressing an actual case, and is often undertaken in teams. The practical elements (as well as the case studies) may involve [[Professor#Non-tenure-track positions 2|external practitioners]], and sometimes executives, supporting the teaching from academic faculty.  (See [[Business school #Use of case studies]] and [[Business_school#Other_approaches|#Other approaches]].) One of the challenges for business academics is demonstrating that their curriculum is relevant to those who want to become managers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacIntosh|first=Robert|last2=Beech|first2=Nic|last3=Bartunek|first3=Jean|last4=Mason|first4=Katy|last5=Cooke|first5=Bill|last6=Denyer|first6=David|date=2017-01-01|title=Impact and Management Research: Exploring Relationships between Temporality, Dialogue, Reflexivity and Praxis|journal=British Journal of Management|language=en|volume=28|issue=1|pages=3–13|doi=10.1111/1467-8551.12207|issn=1467-8551}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doctoral==
At the [[doctoral]] level, all degrees offered are research focused, although they do differ as regards their relative weightings of theory versus practice. Typically, the DBA, DPA, DHA and D.Mgt emphasize [[Management#Levels of management|managerial practice]] alongside research; relatedly, the theses for these degrees will often focus on [[applied research]]. The other doctorates here are (exclusively) theory and research based. Entrance is usually on the basis of a relevant master's degree, and for practice-weighted degrees, relevant managerial experience. For the topic areas applicable to the [[thesis]] component see: [[List of fields of doctoral studies in the United States#Business Management.2FAdministrative Services|List of fields of doctoral studies in the United States

'''CZD''' (Czenakowski Distance) as [[PSNR]] is a per-pixel quality metric (it estimates the quality by measuring differences between pixels). Described in literature as being “useful for comparing vectors with strictly non-negative elements” it measures the similarity among different samples. This different approach has a better correlation with subjective quality assessment than [[PSNR]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2237">A '''canonical unit''' is a [[unit of measurement]] agreed upon as default in a certain context.

== In astrodynamics ==

In [[astrodynamics]], canonical units are defined in terms of an object's reference [[orbit]]. In this system, a reference mass, for example the sun, is assumed to be 1 "mass unit" and the mean distance from the orbiting object to the reference object is considered the "distance unit".

Canonical units are useful when the precise distances and masses of objects in space are not available. However, by setting the mass of a given  object to be 1 mass unit and the mean distance of the reference object to another object in question, many calculations can be simplified.

=== Overview ===

The ''Distance Unit'' &lt;math&gt;DU \ &lt;/math&gt; is defined to be the mean radius of the reference orbit.

The ''Time Unit'' &lt;math&gt;TU \ &lt;/math&gt; is defined by the [[gravitational parameter]] &lt;math&gt; \mu\ &lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\mu = G*M\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;G \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitational constant]]
* &lt;math&gt;M \ &lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the central reference body

For canonical units, the gravitational parameter is defined as:

&lt;math&gt;\mu = 1 * \frac{DU^3}{TU^2}&lt;/math&gt;

----

The quantity of the time unit (TU) can be solved in another unit system (e.g. the metric system) if the mass and radius of the central body has been determined. Using the above equation and applying [[dimensional analysis]], set the two equations expressing &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; equal to each other:

&lt;math&gt;\mu = G*M = 1 * \frac{DU^3}{TU^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The time unit (TU) can be converted to another unit system for a more useful qualitative solution using the following equation:

&lt;math&gt; TU = \sqrt{\frac{DU^3}{G*M}}&lt;/math&gt;

For Earth satellites, approximate unit conversions are as follows:
* 1 DU = 6378.1&amp;nbsp;km = 20,925,524.97&amp;nbsp;ft
* 1 DU/TU = 7.90538&amp;nbsp;km/s = 25,936.29&amp;nbsp;ft/sec
* 1 TU = 806.80415&amp;nbsp;s

=== Astronomical Unit ===

The [[astronomical unit]] is a canonical unit based on the orbit of the Earth around the Sun

{{Time sidebar |science}}

'''Chronobiology''' is a field of [[biology]] that examines periodic (cyclic) phenomena in living organisms and their adaptation to [[sun|solar]]- and [[moon|lunar]]-related rhythms.&lt;ref name="chrono"&gt;{{cite book |author=Patricia J. DeCoursey |author2=Jay C. Dunlap |author3=Jennifer J. Loros  |title=Chronobiology |publisher=Sinauer Associates Inc |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-87893-149-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cycles are known as '''biological rhythms'''. Chronobiology comes from the ancient Greek [[wikt:χρόνος|χρόνος]] (''chrónos'', meaning "time"), and [[biology]], which pertains to the study, or science, of [[life]]. The related terms ''chronomics'' and ''chronome'' have been used in some cases to describe either the [[molecular]] mechanisms involved in chronobiological phenomena or the more quantitative aspects of chronobiology, particularly where comparison of cycles between organisms is required.

Chronobiological studies include but are not limited to comparative [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[genetics]], [[molecular biology]] and [[behavior]] of organisms within biological rhythms mechanics.&lt;ref name="chrono"/&gt;  Other aspects include [[epigenetics]], development, reproduction, ecology and evolution.

==Description==
The variations of the timing and duration of biological activity in living organisms occur for many essential biological processes. These occur (a) in animals (eating, sleeping, mating, hibernating, migration, cellular regeneration, etc.), (b) in plants (leaf movements, [[photosynthetic]] reactions, etc.), and in microbial organisms such as fungi and protozoa. They have even been found in [[bacteria]], especially among the [[cyanobacteria]] (aka blue-green algae, see [[bacterial circadian rhythms]]). The most important rhythm in chronobiology is the [[circadian rhythm]], a roughly 24-hour cycle shown by physiological processes in all these organisms. The term ''circadian'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''circa'', meaning "around" and ''dies'', "day", meaning "approximately a day." It is regulated by [[circadian clock]]s.

The circadian rhythm can further be broken down into routine cycles during the 24-hour day:&lt;ref&gt;Nelson RJ. 2005. An Introduction to Behavioral Endocrinology. Sinauer Associates, Inc.: Massachusetts. Pg587.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Diurnality|Diurnal]], which describes organisms active during daytime
* [[Nocturnal]], which describes organisms active in the night
* [[Crepuscular]], which describes animals primarily active during the dawn and dusk hours (ex: white-tailed deer, some bats)

While [[circadian rhythms]] are defined as regulated by [[endogenous]] processes, other biological cycles may be regulated by exogenous signals.  In some cases, multi-trophic systems may exhibit rhythms driven by the circadian clock of one of the members (which may also be influenced or reset by external factors).  The endogenous plant cycles may regulate the activity of the bacterium by controlling availability of plant-produced photosynthate.

Many other important cycles are also studied, including:
* [[Infradian rhythm]]s, which are cycles longer than a day. Examples include [[Circannual Cycle|circannual]] or annual cycles that govern migration or reproduction cycles in many plants and animals, or the human [[menstrual cycle]].
* [[Ultradian rhythm]]s, which are cycles shorter than 24 hours, such as the 90-minute [[REM cycle]], the 4-hour [[nasal cycle]], or the 3-hour cycle of [[growth hormone]] production.
* [[Tide|Tidal rhythms]], commonly observed in marine life, which follow the roughly 12.4-hour transition from high to low tide and back.
* [[Lunar rhythms]], which follow the [[lunar month]] (29.5 days). They are relevant e.g. for marine life, as the level of the tides is modulated across the lunar cycle. 
* [[Gene oscillations]] – some genes are [[gene expression|expressed]] more during certain hours of the day than during other hours.

Within each cycle, the time period during which the process is more active is called the ''[[wikt:acrophase|acrophase]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Refinetti, Roberto (2006). ''Circadian Physiology''. CRC Press/Taylor &amp; Francis Group. {{ISBN|0-8493-2233-2}}.  [http://www.circadian.org/dictionary.html Lay summary]&lt;/ref&gt;  When the process is less active, the cycle is in its ''[[wikt:bathyphase|bathyphase]]'' or ''trough'' phase.  The particular moment of highest activity is the ''peak'' or ''maximum''; the lowest point is the ''nadir''.  How high (or low) the process gets is measured by the ''[[amplitude]]''.

==History==
A circadian cycle was first observed in the 18th century in the movement of plant leaves by the French scientist [[Jean-Jacques d'Ortous de Mairan]].&lt;ref&gt;for a description of circadian rhythms in plants by de Mairan, Linnaeus, and Darwin see [http://www.hhmi.org/biointeractive/museum/exhibit00/02_1.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1751 Swedish [[botanist]] and [[naturalist]] [[Carl Linnaeus]] (Carl von Linné) designed a [[Linnaeus' flower clock|flower clock]] using certain species of [[flowering plant]]s. By arranging the selected species in a circular pattern, he designed a clock that indicated the time of day by the flowers that were open at each given hour. For example, among members of the [[daisy family]], he used the [[Crepis|hawk's beard]] plant which opened its flowers at 6:30 am and the [[hawkbit]] which did not open its flowers until 7 am.&lt;ref name="linnean"&gt;http://www.linnean.org/Resources/LinneanSociety/Documents/Library-and-Archives/4-Floral%20Clock.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960 symposium at [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]] laid the groundwork for the field of chronobiology.&lt;ref name="Kreitzman2004"&gt;{{cite book |author=Leon Kreitzman; Russell G. Foster |title=Rhythms of life: the biological clocks that control the daily lives of every living thing |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Conn |year=2004 |isbn=0-300-10969-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also in 1960 that [[Patricia DeCoursey]] invented the [[phase response curve]], one of the major tools used in the field since.

[[Franz Halberg]] of the [[University of Minnesota]], who coined the word ''circadian'', is widely considered the "father of American chronobiology." However, it was [[Colin Pittendrigh]] and not Halberg who was elected to lead the ''Society for Research in Biological Rhythms'' in the 1970s. Halberg wanted more emphasis on the human and medical issues while Pittendrigh had his background more in evolution and ecology. With Pittendrigh as leader, the Society members did basic research on all types of organisms, plants as well as animals. More recently it has been difficult to get funding for such research on any other organisms than mice, rats, humans&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/07/clocktutorial_3_fortyfive_year.php |title=ClockTutorial #2a, Forty-Five Years of Pittendrigh's Empirical Generalizations |accessdate=2007-12-23 |last=Zivkovic |first=Bora |date=2006-07-03 |work=A Blog Around the Clock |publisher=ScienceBlogs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/09/clocks_in_bacteria_v_how_about.php |title=Clocks in Bacteria V |accessdate=2007-12-23 |last=Zivkovic |first=Bora |date=2006-05-17 |work=A Blog Around the Clock |publisher=ScienceBlogs}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]].

==Recent developments==
More recently, [[light therapy]] and [[melatonin]] administration have been explored by [[Alfred J. Lewy]] ([[OHSU]]), [[Josephine Arendt]] ([[University of Surrey]], UK) and other researchers as a means to reset animal and human circadian rhythms. Additionally, the presence of low-level light at night accelerates circadian re-entrainment of hamsters of all ages by 50%; this is thought to be related to simulation of moonlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Frank | first1 = D. W. | last2 = Evans | first2 = J. A. | last3 = Gorman | first3 = M.

Humans can have a propensity to be morning people or evening people; these behavioral preferences are called [[chronotype]]s for which there are various assessment questionnaires and biological marker correlations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Power of When|last=Breus, PHD|first=Michael|publisher=Little Brown and Company|year=2016|isbn=978-0-316-39126-9|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second half of 20th century, substantial contributions and formalizations have been made by Europeans such as [[Jürgen Aschoff]] and [[Colin Pittendrigh]], who pursued different but complementary views on the phenomenon of [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the circadian system by light (parametric, continuous, tonic, gradual vs. nonparametric, discrete, phasic, instantaneous, respectively&lt;ref&gt;see [http://jbr.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/15/3/195 this historical article], subscription required&lt;/ref&gt;).

There is also a food-entrainable biological clock, which is not confined to the suprachiasmatic nucleus. The location of this clock has been disputed. Working with mice, however, Fuller ''et al.'' concluded that the food-entrainable clock seems to be located in the dorsomedial [[hypothalamus]]. During restricted feeding, it takes over control of such functions as activity timing, increasing the chances of the animal successfully locating food resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fuller |first=Patrick M. |author2=Jun Lu |author3=Clifford B.

In [[literary theory]] and [[philosophy of language]], the '''chronotope''' is how configurations of time and space are represented in [[language]] and [[discourse]]. The term was taken up by Russian literary scholar [[Bakhtin|M.M. Bakhtin]] who used it as a central element in his theory of meaning in language and literature. The term itself comes from the Russian ''{{lang|ru|xронотоп}}'', which in turn is derived from the Greek ''{{lang|grc|χρόνος}}'' ('[[time]]') and ''{{lang|grc|τόπος}}'' ('[[space]]'); it thus can be literally translated as "time-space." Bakhtin developed the term in his 1937 essay "Forms of Time and of the Chronotope in the Novel" ({{lang|ru|Формы времени и хронотопа в романе}}). Here Bakhtin showed how different literary genres operated with different configurations of time and space, which gave each genre its particular narrative character. For example, the chronotopic frame of the epic differed from that of the hero adventure or the comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bakhtin|first=M.|year=1981|chapter=Forms of time and of the chronotope in the novel|title=In The Dialogic Imagination|pages=84–258|location=Austin|publisher=Univ. Texas Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
In the [[philosophy of language]] and [[philology]], Bakhtin scholars [[Caryl Emerson]] and [[Michael Holquist]] state that the chronotope is "a unit of analysis for studying language according to the ratio and characteristics of the temporal and spatial categories represented in that language". Specific chronotopes are said to correspond to particular [[genre]]s, or relatively stable ways of speaking, which themselves represent particular [[worldview]]s or [[ideology|ideologies]]. To this extent, a chronotope is both a cognitive concept and a narrative feature of language.

In "Forms of Time and of the Chronotope in the Novel," Bakhtin defines the chronotope thus:

{{quote|text=We will give the name chronotope (literally, "time space") to the intrinsic connectedness of temporal and spatial relationships that are artistically expressed in literature. This term [space-time] is employed in mathematics, and was introduced as part of Einstein's Theory of Relativity. The special meaning it has in relativity theory is not important for our purposes; we are borrowing it for literary criticism almost as a metaphor (almost, but not entirely). What counts for us is the fact that it expresses the inseparability of space and time (time as the fourth dimension of space). We understand the chronotope as a formally constitutive category of literature; we will not deal with the chronotope in other areas of culture.' In the literary artistic chronotope, spatial and temporal indicators are fused into one carefully thought-out, concrete whole. Time, as it were, thickens, takes on flesh, becomes artistically visible; likewise, space becomes charged and responsive to the movements of time, plot and history. This intersection of axes and fusion of indicators characterizes the artistic chronotope.
The chronotope in literature has an intrinsic generic significance. It can even be said that it is precisely the chronotope that defines genre and generic distinctions, for in literature the primary category in the chronotope is time. The chronotope as a formally constitutive category determines to a significant degree the image of man in literature as well. The image of man is always intrinsically chronotopic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bakhtin|first=M.|year=1981|chapter=Forms of time and of the chronotope in the novel|title=In The Dialogic Imagination|pages=84-85|location=Austin|publisher=Univ. Texas Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Examples ==
The concept of the chronotope has been most widely used in literary studies. The scholar Timo Müller for example argued that analysis of chronotopes highlights the environmental dimension of literary texts because it draws attention to the concrete physical spaces in which stories take place. Müller discusses the chronotope of the road, which for Bakhtin was a meeting place but in recent literature no longer brings people together in this way because automobiles have changed the way we perceive the time and space of the road. Car drivers want to minimize the time they spend on the road. They are rarely interested in the road as a physical space, the natural environment around the road, or the environmental implications of their driving. This contrasts with earlier literary examples such as [[Robert Frost]]'s poem "The Road Not Taken" or [[John Steinbeck]]'s novel ''The Grapes of Wrath'', where the road is described as part of the natural environment and the travelers are interested in that environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Müller|first=Timo|title=Notes Toward an Ecological Conception of Bakhtin’s ‘Chronotope.’|url=http://ecozona.eu/article/viewFile/327/301|date=2010}}; {{cite book|last1=Müller|first1=Timo|chapter=The Ecology of Literary Chronotopes|title=Handbook of Ecocriticism and Cultural Ecology|date=2016|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/product/206422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistic anthropologist [[Keith Basso]] invoked "chronotopes" in discussing Western [Apache] stories linked with places. In the 1980s when Basso was writing, geographic features reminded the [[Western Apache]] of "the moral teachings of their history" by recalling to mind events that occurred there in important moral narratives. By merely mentioning "it happened at [the place called] 'men stand above here and there,'" storyteller Nick Thompson could remind locals of the dangers of joining "with outsiders against members of their own community." Geographic features in the Western Apache landscape are chronotopes, Basso says, in precisely the way Bakhtin defines the term when he says they are "points in the geography of a community where time and space intersect and fuse. Time takes on flesh and becomes visible for human contemplation; likewise, space becomes charged and responsive to the movements of time and history and the enduring character of a people. ...Chronotopes thus stand as monuments to the community itself, as symbols of it, as forces operating to shape its members' images of themselves" (qtd. in Basso 1984: 44–45).

Anthropologist of syncretism [http://www.bristol.ac.uk/school-of-arts/people/safet-hadzimuhamedovic/index.html Safet HadžiMuhamedović] built upon [[Mikhail Bakhtin|Bakhtin’s]] term in his ethnography of the [[Gatačko Polje|Field of Gacko]] in the southeastern Bosnian highlands. In [http://www.berghahnbooks.com/title/HadziMuhamedovicWaiting ''Waiting for'' ''Elijah: Time and Encounter in a Bosnian Landscape''], he argued that people and landscapes may sometimes be trapped between timespaces and thus '''''"schizochronotopic"''''' (from the Greek σχίζειν (''skhizein''): "to split").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Waiting for Elijah: Time and Encounter in a Bosnian Landscape|last=HadžiMuhamedović|first=Safet|publisher=Berghahn Books|year=2018|isbn=978-1-78533-856-4|location=New York and Oxford|pages=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described two overarching chronotopes as "collective timespace themes", both of which relied on certain kinds of past and laid claims to the Field’s future. One was told through proximities, the other through distances between religious communities. For HadžiMuhamedović, '''''schizochronotopia''''' is a rift occurring within the same body/landscape, through which the past and the present of place have rendered each other unbidden. 

The chronotope has also been adopted for the analysis of classroom events and conversations, for example by Raymond Brown and [[Peter Renshaw]] in order to view "student participation in the classroom as a dynamic process constituted through the interaction of past experience, ongoing involvement, and yet-to-be-accomplished goals" (2006: 247–259). Kumpulainen, Mikkola, and Jaatinen (2013) examined the space–time configurations of students’ technology-mediated creative learning practices over a year-long school musical project in a Finnish elementary school. The findings of their study suggest that "blended practices appeared to break away from traditional learning practices, allowing students to navigate in different time zones, spaces, and places with diverse tools situated in their formal and informal lives" (2013: 53).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6717">'''Diauxie''' is a Greek word coined by [[Jacques Monod]] to mean two growth phases. The word is used in English in [[cell biology]] to describe the growth phases of a [[microorganism]] in [[batch culture]] as it [[metabolism|metabolizes]] a mixture of two sugars. Rather than metabolizing the two available sugars simultaneously, microbial cells commonly consume them in a sequential pattern, resulting in two separate growth phases.

==Growth phases== 
[[File:Monod's Diauxic growth.gif|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Monod's original results on Diauxie. Time in hours is plotted on the horizontal axis. Optical density (equivalent to cell concentration) is plotted on the vertical axis.]]

[[Jacques Monod]] discovered diauxic growth in 1941 during his experiments with ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]''.   While growing these bacteria on various combination of sugars during his doctoral thesis research, Monod observed that often two distinct growth phases are clearly visible in batch culture, as seen in Figure 1.

During the first phase, cells preferentially metabolize the sugar on which it can grow faster (often [[glucose]] but not always). Only after the first sugar has been exhausted do the cells switch to the second. At the time of the "diauxic shift", there is often a lag period during which cells produce the [[enzymes]] needed to metabolize the second sugar.

Monod later put aside his work on diauxic growth and focused on the [[lac operon|''lac'' operon]] model of [[gene expression]], which led to a Nobel prize.

Diauxie occurs because organisms use [[operons]] or multiple sets of [[genes]] to control differently the expression of enzymes needed to metabolize the different nutrients or sugars they encounter. If an organism allocates its energy and other resources (e.g. amino acids) to synthesize enzymes needed to metabolize a sugar that can only support a slower growth rate and not use all or most of its available resources to synthesize the enzymes that metabolize a different sugar providing a faster growth rate, such an organism will be at a reproductive disadvantage compared to those that choose to grow on the faster growth supporting sugar. Through [[evolution]], organisms have developed the ability to regulate their genetic control mechanisms so as to only express those genes resulting in the fastest growth rate. For example, when grown in the presence of both glucose and maltose, ''[[Lactococcus lactis]]'' will produce enzymes to metabolize glucose first, altering its gene expression to use maltose only after the supply of glucose has been exhausted.

In the case of the baker's or brewer's [[yeast]] ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' growing on glucose with plenty of aeration, the diauxic growth pattern is commonly observed in batch culture.  During the first growth phase, when there is plenty of glucose and oxygen available, the yeast cells prefer [[glucose]] [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] to [[aerobic respiration]] even though aerobic respiration is  the more efficient pathway to grow on glucose.  Contrary to the more commonly invoked [[Pasteur effect]], this phenomenon of preferring the faster growth supporting fermentation is closer to the [[Warburg effect (oncology)|Warburg effect]] observed in faster growing tumors. The intracellular genetic regulatory mechanisms have evolved to enforce this choice, as fermentation provides a faster growth rate for the yeast cells than the aerobic respiration of glucose.  After glucose is depleted, the fermentative product ethanol is oxidised in a noticeably slower second growth phase, if oxygen is available.

== Proposed mechanism ==
In the 1940s, Monod hypothesized that a single enzyme could adapt to metabolize different sugars. It took 15 years of further work to show that this was incorrect. During his work on the [[lac operon]] of ''E. coli'', [[Joshua Lederberg]] isolated [[β-galactosidase]] and found it in greater quantities in colonies grown on lactose compared to other sugars. [[Melvin Cohn]] in Monod's lab at the Pasteur Institute then found that β-galactosides induced enzyme activity. The idea of enzyme adaptation was thus replaced with the concept of [[enzyme induction]], in which a molecule induces expression of a gene or operon, often by binding to a repressor protein and preventing it from attaching to the operator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Mulligan|first = Martin|title = Induction|url=https://www.mun.ca/biochem/courses/4103/topics/induction.html|accessdate = 2007-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of the bacterial diauxic shift from glucose to lactose metabolism, a proposed mechanism suggested that glucose initially inhibits the ability of the enzyme [[adenylate cyclase]] to synthesize [[cyclic AMP]] (cAMP). cAMP, in turn, is required for the [[Catabolite Activator Protein|catabolite activator protein]] (CAP) to bind to DNA and activate the [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of the lac operon, which includes genes necessary for lactose metabolism. The presence of allolactose, a metabolic product of lactose, is sensed through the activity of the [[lac repressor]], which inhibits transcription of the lac operon until lactose is present. Thus, if glucose is present, cAMP levels remain low, so CAP is unable to activate transcription of the lac operon, regardless of the presence or absence of lactose. Upon the exhaustion of the glucose supply, cAMP levels rise, allowing CAP to activate the genes necessary for the metabolism of other food sources, including lactose if it is present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Brown|first = T.A.|title = Transient Changes in Gene Activity|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=genomes.section.7882|accessdate = 2007-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent research however suggests that the cAMP model is not correct in this instance since cAMP levels remain identical under glucose and lactose growth conditions, and a different model has been proposed and it suggests that the lactose-glucose diauxie in ''E. coli'' may be caused mainly by inducer exclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Current Opinion in Microbiology |year=1999 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=195–201 |title= Carbon catabolite repression in bacteria |author=Stülke J, Hillen W. |pmid= 10322165 |doi=10.1016/S1369-5274(99)80034-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this model, glucose transport via the [[PEP group translocation|EIIA&lt;sup&gt;Glc&lt;/sup&gt;]] shuts down lactose permease when glucose is being transported into the cell, so lactose is not transported into cell and used. While the cAMP/CAP mechanism may not play a role in the glucose/lactose diauxie, it is a suggested mechanism for other diauxie .

'''Dundee Science Centre''' (formerly known as '''Sensation''') is a [[science centre]] located in [[Dundee]], [[Scotland]], and a part of the [[Scottish Science Centres Network]]. It is a registered [[non-profit organisation]] that is funded by the public and donations from local corporate sponsors.

The interactive exhibits focus mainly on the [[life sciences]], and in particular on the [[senses]]. There is also a focus on [[robotics]], and a practical exploration of [[Science education|science learning]]. Daily shows include: [[Keyhole Surgery]], Science on the Spot, MindBall, Looking for Life Planetarium show and Solar System show.

Dundee Science Centre is also a corporate venue and a [[HMIE]]-inspected resource for science learning and public engagement. The centre hosts school groups, uniformed groups and also birthday parties.

There is an in-house cafe (Infusion) and a gift shop, stocking many science and educational products.

Dundee Science Centre is open daily from 10am to 5pm.

As one of the [[Millennium Commission]] projects, it opened in July 2000 at the cost of around £5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HMie Review of the Contribution of the Scottish Science Centres Network |url=http://www.hmie.gov.uk/documents/publication/sscn.html |accessdate=2008-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204034910/http://www.hmie.gov.uk/documents/publication/sscn.html |archivedate=2008-12-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:1831-View-Whitechapel-Road-steam-carriage-caricature.jpg|250px|thumb|1831 cartoon, warning about road troubles of the future.]]
In the early 20th century, cars entered [[mass production]]. The United States produced 45,000 cars in 1907, but 28 years later, in 1935, this had increased nearly 90-fold to 3,971,000.&lt;ref name="Bradford J. DeLong" /&gt; This increase in production required a new large work force. In 1913 there were 13,623 people working for [[Ford Motor Company]], but by 1915 this had increased to 18,028.&lt;ref name="Bradford J. DeLong"&gt;{{cite web |last=DeLong |first=Bradford |title=The Roaring Twenties." Slouching Towards Utopia? The Economic History of the Twentieth Century. |url=http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/tceh/slouch_roaring13.html |accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=October 2016}} [[Bradford DeLong]], author of [[The Roaring Twenties]], tells us that "Many more lined up outside the Ford factory for chances to work at what appeared to them to be (and, for those who did not mind the pace of the [[assembly line]] much, was) an incredible [[boondoggle]] of a job.&lt;ref name="Bradford J. DeLong"/&gt;" There was a surge in the need for workers at big, new [[high-technology]] companies such as Ford. [[Employment]] increased greatly.
[[File:Sacrifices to the Modern Moloch.jpg|thumb|''Sacrifices to the Modern [[Moloch]]'', a cartoon published in [[The New York Times]], satirising the indifference from the society regarding the increasing on automobile related traffic fatalities.]]
Though, when the motor age arrived in western countries at the beginning of the 20th century, many conservative intellectuals opposed the increase in motor vehicles on the roads. These increases removed space for pedestrians, and brought a tremendous increase in pedestrian deaths caused by car collisions.

[[W.S. Gilbert]], a famous British [[librettist]], wrote to ''[[The Times]]'' on 3 June 1903:

{{Cquote|''Sir,–I am delighted with the suggestion made by your spirited correspondent Sir Ralph Payne-Gallwey that all pedestrians shall be legally empowered to discharge shotguns (the size of the shot to be humanely restricted to No. 8 or No. 9) at all motorists who may appear to them to be driving to the common danger. Not only would this provide a speedy and effective punishment for the erring motorist, but it would also supply the dwellers on popular highroads with a comfortable increase of income. "Motor shooting for a single gun" would appeal strongly to the sporting instincts of the true Briton, and would provide ample compensation to the proprietors of eligible road-side properties for the intolerable annoyance caused by the enemies of mankind.''  }}

Ten years later, Alfred Godley wrote a more elaborate protest, "[[The Motor Bus]]", a poem which cleverly combined a lesson in Latin grammar with an expression of distaste for innovative motor transport.

==Access and convenience==
[[File:APlus AH Plaza Secaucus jeh.JPG|thumb|[[Convenience store]] in a [[rest area]] serving [[New Jersey Turnpike]] users.]]
Worldwide, the car has allowed easier access to remote places. However, average journey times to regularly visited places have increased in large cities, as a result of widespread car adoption and [[urban sprawl]], as well as the [[History of trams#Disappearance from many cities|decommissioning of older tram systems]]. This is due to [[traffic congestion]] and the increased distances between home and work brought about by urban sprawl.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last=Gilbert |first=Alan |title=The mega-city in Latin America |publisher=United Nations University Press |year=1996 |isbn=92-808-0935-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of car access issues in underdeveloped countries are for example the paving of [[Mexican Federal Highway 1]] through [[Baja California]], completing the connection of [[Cabo San Lucas]] to [[California]]. In [[Madagascar]], another example, about 30% of the population does not have access to reliable all-weather roads&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldbank.org/transport/rural_tr/gp_docs/madagascar.htm |title=Madagascar: The Development of a National Rural Transport Program |publisher=Worldbank.org |date=2010-11-23 |accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[China]], 184 towns and 54,000 villages have no motor road (or roads at all).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/2003/May/64719.htm |title='&amp;#39;China Through a Lens: Rural Road Construction Speeded Up'&amp;#39; |publisher=China.org.cn |date=2003-05-16 |accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain developments in retail are partially due to car use, such as drive-thru [[fast food]] purchasing and [[Gasoline station]] grocery shopping.

== Economic changes ==

=== Employment and consumption habits ===
[[File:Ravenswood 101 signs.jpg|thumb|High signs attract the attention of drivers on the adjacent [[freeway]].]]
[[File:Ancaster suburbs.jpg|thumb|A street without a sidewalk, where the [[pedestrian]] must walk on the road pavement.]]

The development of the car has contributed to changes in employment distribution, shopping patterns, social interactions, manufacturing priorities and [[city planning]]; increasing use of cars has reduced the roles of [[walking]], [[horse]]s and [[railroad]]s.&lt;ref name="crabgrass"&gt;{{cite crabgrass}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to money for roadway construction, car use was also encouraged in many places through new [[zoning laws]] that allowed any new business to construct a certain amount of parking based on the size and type of facility. The effect was to create many free [[parking]] spaces, and business places further back from the road. In aggregate, this led to less dense settlements and made a carless lifestyle increasingly unattractive.

Many new [[shopping center]]s and [[suburbs]] did not install [[sidewalk]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.startribune.com/local/11588256.html Sidewalks? Too Pedestrian] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304175542/http://www.startribune.com/local/11588256.html |date=2014-03-04 }} by: Mary Jane Smetanka Minneapolis-St Paul Star Tribune, Aut 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; making pedestrian access dangerous.  This had the effect of encouraging people to drive, even for short trips that might have been walkable, thus increasing and solidifying American auto-dependency.&lt;ref name="parking"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bV622ieCXakC Lots of Parking: Land Use in a Car Culture] By John A. Jakle, Keith A. Sculle. 2004. {{ISBN|0-8139-2266-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this change, employment opportunities for people who were not wealthy enough to own a car and for people who could not drive, due to age or physical disabilities, became severely limited.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;[[When Work Disappears]] by William Julius Wilson. {{ISBN|0-679-72417-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic growth ===
[[File:Motorisation rate vs Economic growth in Europe.png|left|thumb|upright=1.2|Motorisation rate&lt;ref name="Eurostat1"&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tsdpc340&amp;plugin=1 Motorisation Rate]; ''Cars per 1000 inhabitants in Europe'', Eurostat&lt;/ref&gt; vs. Economic growth&lt;ref name="Eurostat2"&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tec00115&amp;plugin=1 Economic Growth], ''Real GDP growth rate - volume, Percentage change on previous year'', Eurostat.&lt;/ref&gt; in European countries whose population is greater than 1 million inhabitants. Source: Eurostat.]]
In countries with major car manufacturers, such as USA or Germany, a certain degree of car dependency might be positive for the economy at a macroeconomic level, since it demands automobile production, therefore resulting also in job demand and tax revenue. These economic conditions were particularly valid during the 1920s when the number of automobiles, worldwide, had a substantial annual average increase, but also during the [[post–World War II economic expansion]]. Notwithstanding the growing effects provided by the automobile on the economy of some countries, several other auto-dependent countries, deprived from automobile industry and oil resources, have to allocate substantial economic assets, to satisfy its mobility policies, affecting then their [[commercial balance]]. This situation is broadly valid in the majority of the European countries, since, disregarding some few exceptions such as [[Energy in Norway|Norway]], Europe is largely dependent on imports for its fossil fuels. Furthermore, just few European countries, such as Germany or France, have car manufacturers productive enough to satisfy their country's internal demand for cars. All these factors related to high motorisation rates, affect therefore the economic growth in the majority of the European countries.&lt;ref name="Eurostat1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eurostat2"/&gt; Most African countries are also dependant from imported cars, usually second-hand from Western countries, some of those vehicles being in a very worn-out state. Finally, even countries with oil ressources could be deprived of refineries, such as Nigeria which has to import fuel even though it is a major oil producer.

=== Employment in the automotive industry ===
As of 2009 the U.S. motor vehicle manufacturing industry employed 880,000 workers, or approximately 6.6% of the U.S. manufacturing workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Michaela|first=Platzer|last2=Glennon|first2=Harrison|title=The U.S. Automotive Industry: National and State Trends in Manufacturing Employment|url=http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1671&amp;context=key_workplace|journal=Congressional Research Service|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traffic==
{{Main|Traffic}}
Cycling steadily became more important in Europe over the first half of the twentieth century, but it dropped off dramatically in the United States between 1900 and 1910. Automobiles became the preferred means of transportation. Over the 1920s, bicycles gradually became considered children's toys, and by 1940 most bicycles in the United States were made for children.
From the early 20th century until after World War II, the [[roadster (bicycle)|roadster]] constituted most adult bicycles sold in the United Kingdom and in many parts of the British Empire. For many years after the advent of the motorcycle and automobile, they remained a primary means of adult transport. In several places - both high and low income - bicycles have retained or regained this position. In Denmark, cycling policies were adopted as a direct consequence of the [[1973 oil crisis]] whereas bike advocacy in the Netherlands started in earnest with a campaign against traffic deaths called "stop child murder". Today both countries have high [[modal share]]s of cycling despite high car ownership rates.

==Cultural changes==
Prior to the appearance of the automobile, horses, walking and [[tram|streetcars]] were the major [[modes of transportation]] within cities.&lt;ref name="crabgrass"/&gt; Horses require a large amount of care, and were therefore kept in public facilities that were usually far from residences. The wealthy could afford to keep horses for private use, hence the term [[carriage]] trade referred to elite patronage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/carriage+trade Carriage trade] The Free Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Horse [[manure]] left on the streets also created a [[sanitation]] problem.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Strasser, ''Waste and Want: A Social History of Trash'', Owl Books, 355 pages (1999) {{ISBN|978-0-8050-6512-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The motorcycle made regular medium-distance travel more convenient and affordable and after World War I the automobile too, especially in areas without railways.  Because cars did not require rest, were faster than horse-drawn conveyances, and soon had a lower [[total cost of ownership]], more people were routinely able to travel farther than in earlier times. The construction of [[controlled-access highway|highways]] in the 1950s continued this.  Some experts suggest that many of these changes began during the earlier [[Bicycle craze|Golden age of the bicycle]], from 1880 to 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Robert (1972). ''A Social History of the Bicycle, its Early Life and Times in America''. American Heritage Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes to urban society===
[[File:Ngaajyunlapgaau.JPG|thumb|Urban interchange in [[Shenzhen]]]]
Beginning in the 1940s, most urban environments in the [[United States]] lost their [[streetcars]], [[Cable car (railway)|cable cars]], and other forms of [[light rail]], to be replaced by [[diesel fuel|diesel]]-burning motor coaches or [[buses]].  Many of these have never returned, but some urban communities eventually installed [[rapid transit]].

Another change brought about by the car is that modern urban pedestrians must be more alert than their ancestors.  In the past, a pedestrian had to worry about relatively slow-moving streetcars or other obstacles of travel.  With the proliferation of the car, a pedestrian has to anticipate safety risks of automobiles traveling at high speeds because they can cause serious injuries to a human and can be fatal,&lt;ref name="crabgrass" /&gt; unlike in previous times when traffic deaths were usually due to horses escaping control.

According to many social scientists, the loss of [[pedestrian]]-scale villages has also disconnected communities. Many people in developed countries have less contact with their neighbors and rarely walk unless they place a high value on [[exercise]].&lt;ref name="fromhighway"&gt;[http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=5182080&amp;q=car+culture&amp;uid=789848837&amp;setcookie=yes From Highway to Superhighway: The Sustainability, Symbolism and Situated Practices of Car Culture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118033911/http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=5182080&amp;q=car+culture&amp;uid=789848837&amp;setcookie=yes |date=2007-11-18 }} Graves-Brown.  Social Analysis. Vol. 41, pp. 64–75. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Further|Automotive city}}

=== Advent of suburban society ===
In the decades following World War II, the auto united in the United States with the single family dwelling to form suburbs. Suburban affluence led to a baby boomer generation far removed from the hardships of their parents.  Community standards of the past, driven by scarcity and the need to share public resources, gave way to new credos of self-exploration.  As the economy of the fifties and sixties boomed, car sales grew steadily, from 6 million units sold per year in the U.S. to 10 million.  Married women entered into the economy and two car households became commonplace.  In the seventies, however, the comparative economic stagnation then experienced was accompanied by societal self-reflection on the changes the auto brought.  Critics of automotive society found little positive choice in the decision to move to the suburbs; the physical movement was looked upon as flight.  The auto industry was also under attack from bureaucratic fronts, and new emission and CAFÉ regulations began to hamper Big Three profit margins.

Kenneth Schneider in Autokind vs Mankind (1971) called for a war against the auto, derided it for being a destroyer of cities, and likened its proliferation to a disease.  Renowned social critic Vance Packard in A Nation of Strangers (1972) blamed the geographic mobility enabled by the auto for loneliness and social isolation.  Auto sales peaked in 1973, at 14.6 million units sold, and were not to reach comparable levels for another decade. The 1973 Arab-Israeli War was followed by the OPEC oil embargo, leading to an explosion of prices, long gas lines, and talk of rationing.

While it may appear clear, in retrospect, that the automotive/suburban culture would continue to flourish, as it did in the 1950s and 1960s, no such certainty existed at the time when British architect Martin Pawley authored his seminal work, The Private Future (1973).  Pawley called the automobile “the shibboleth of privatization; the symbol and the actuality of withdrawal from the community” and perceived that, in spite of its momentary misfortunes, its dominance in North American society would continue.  The car was a private world that allowed for fantasy and escape, and Pawley forecasted that it would grow in size, and in technological capacities.  He saw no pathology in consumer behavior grounded in freedom of expression.

Improved transport accelerated the outward growth of cities and the development of [[suburb]]s beyond an earlier era's [[streetcar suburb]]s.&lt;ref name="crabgrass" /&gt; Until the advent of the car, [[factory worker]]s lived either close to the factory or in high density communities farther away, connected to the factory by [[streetcar]] or [[Rail transport|rail]]. The car and the federal [[Subsidy#Infrastructure subsidies|subsidies]] for roads and suburban development that supported car culture allowed people to live in low density [[residential area]]s even farther from the [[city center]] and [[Racial integration|integrated]] city neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="crabgrass" /&gt; were [[Industrial suburb]]s being few, due in part to [[single use zoning]], they created few local jobs and residents commuted longer distances to work each day as the suburbs continued to expand.&lt;ref name="asphalt" /&gt;

====In The United States====
[[File:James Dean and Porsche Speedster 23F at Palm Springs Races March, 1955.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|[[James Dean]] inside a Porsche Speedster]]

The car had a significant effect on the [[culture of the United States]]. As other vehicles had been, cars were incorporated into artworks including music, books and movies. Between 1905 and 1908, more than 120 songs were written in which the automobile was the subject.&lt;ref name="crabgrass" /&gt;{{failed verification|date=February 2016}} Although authors such as [[Booth Tarkington]] decried the automobile age in books including ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons]]'' (1918), novels celebrating the political effects of motorization included ''[[Free Air]]'' (1919) by [[Sinclair Lewis]], which followed in the tracks of earlier [[Bicycle touring#Social significance|bicycle touring]] novels. Some early 20th century experts doubted the safety and suitability of allowing female automobilists. [[Dorothy Levitt]] was among those eager to lay such concerns to rest, so much so that a century later only one country had a [[women to drive movement]]. Where 19th-century mass media had made heroes of [[Casey Jones]], [[Allan Pinkerton]] and other stalwart protectors of public transport, new [[road movie]]s offered heroes who found freedom and equality, rather than duty and hierarchy, on the open road.

[[George Monbiot]] writes that widespread car culture has shifted voter's preference to the [[right-wing]] of the political spectrum, and thinks that car culture has contributed to an increase in individualism and fewer social interactions between members of different socioeconomic classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=George Monbiot |url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/columnist/story/0,9321,1671055,00.html |title=George Monbiot, '&amp;#39;The Guardian'&amp;#39;, December 20, 2005 |publisher=Politics.guardian.co.uk |date=2005-12-20 |accessdate=2011-01-09 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Motor League]] had promoted the making of more and better cars since the early days of the car, and the [[American Automobile Association]] joined the [[good roads movement]] begun during the earlier [[bicycle craze]]; when manufacturers and petroleum fuel suppliers were well established, they also joined construction contractors in lobbying governments to build public roads.&lt;ref name="asphalt"/&gt;

As [[tourism]] became motorized, individuals, families and small groups were able to vacation in distant locations such as [[national park]]s. Roads including the [[Blue Ridge Parkway]] were built specifically to help the urban masses experience natural scenery previously seen only by a few. Cheap restaurants and [[motel]]s appeared on favorite routes and provided wages for locals who were reluctant to join the trend to [[rural depopulation]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

====Europe====
[[File:1973 Triumph TR6 Roadster (16313636976).jpg|thumb|1973 Triumph TR6 Roadster]]
Road building was sometimes also influenced by [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian-style]] political ideologies. In Europe, massive freeway building programs were initiated by a number of [[social democratic]] governments after [[World War II]], in an attempt to create jobs and make the car available to the working classes. From the 1970s, promotion of the automobile increasingly became a trait of some [[Conservatism|conservatives]]. [[Margaret Thatcher]] mentioned a "great car economy" in the paper on [[Roads for Prosperity]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The 1973 oil crisis and with it fuel rationing measures brought to light for the first time in a generation, what cities without cars might look like, reinvigorating or creating environmental consciousness in the process. Green parties emerged in several European countries in partial response to car culture, but also as the political arm of the anti-nuclear movement.

===Cinema===
The rise of car culture during the twentieth century, played an important cultural role in cinema, mainly through [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]]. Important characters such as [[James Bond]], or the ones performed by [[James Dean]], were always provided on scene with powerful automobiles, which through time, have become cultural icons.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Cars as a lifestyle===
[[File:WindmillSaabs.jpg|thumb|180px|International [[Saab Group|Saab]] Club meeting in [[Latvia]].]]
Over time, the car has evolved beyond being a means of transportation or status symbol and into a subject of interest and a cherished lifestyle amongst many people in the world, who appreciate cars for their craftsmanship, their performance, as well as the vast arrays of [[car club|activities]] one can take part in with his/her car.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaca.org/About-AACA/an-introduction-to-aaca.html. ''A Concise History of AACA in the Beginning''. Antique Automobile Club of America. Retrieved on February 20, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; People who have a keen interest in cars and/or participate in the car hobby are known as "Car Enthusiasts".

One major aspect of the hobby is collecting. Cars, especially [[vintage car|classic vehicles]], are appreciated by their owners as having aesthetic, recreational and historic value.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wealthdaily.com/articles/investing-in-classic-cars/4748. ''Investing in classic cars''. Retrieved on April 5, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Such demand generates investment potential and allows some cars to command extraordinarily high prices and become financial instruments in their own right.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/info-invcar04.html. "The Dow Jones Classic Car Index". The Wall Street Journal. Retrieved on July 14, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

A second major aspect of the car hobby is vehicle modification, as many car enthusiasts modify their cars to achieve performance improvements or visual enhancements. Many subcultures exist within this segment of the car hobby, for example, those building their own custom vehicles, primarily appearance-based on original examples or reproductions of pre-1948 US car market designs and similar designs from the World War II era and earlier from elsewhere in the world, are known as [[hot rod]]ders, while those who believe cars should stay true to their original designs and not be modified are known as "[[wikt:purist|Purist]]s".

In addition, [[motorsport]] (both professional and amateur) as well as casual driving events, where enthusiasts from around the world gather to drive and display their cars, are important pillars of the car hobby as well. Notable examples such events are the annual [[Mille Miglia]] classic car rally and the [[Gumball 3000]] supercar race.

Many [[car club]]s have been set up to facilitate social interactions and companionships amongst those who take pride in owning, maintaining, driving and showing their cars. Many prestigious social events around the world today are centered around the hobby, a notable example is the [[Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance]] classic car show.

==Safety and traffic collisions==
{{Main|Automobile safety|Traffic collision|Epidemiology of motor vehicle collisions}}

[[File:Road-way vs. railway safety.png|thumb|upright=1.25|According to [[Eurostat]] the automobile is one of the less safe means of transport, if safety is measured as the fewest fatalities per travelled passenger-distance.

Motor vehicle [[accident]]s account for 37.5% of accidental deaths in the United States, making them the country's leading cause of accidental death.&lt;ref&gt;Directly from: http://www.benbest.com/lifeext/causes.html See '' Accident as a Cause of Death''&lt;br&gt;Derived from: National Vital Statistics Report, Volume 50, Number 15 (September 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Though travelers in cars suffer fewer deaths per journey, or per unit time or distance, than most other users of [[private transport]] such as bicyclers or pedestrians {{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}, cars are also more used, making [[automobile safety]] an important topic of study. For those aged 5–34 in the United States, motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death, claiming the lives of 18,266 Americans each year.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/injury/overview/data.html&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=March 2018}}

It is estimated that motor vehicle collisions caused the death of around 60 million people during the 20th century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medcrunch.net/death-20th-century-infographic/ |title=Death in the 20th Century. The Infographic |date=Apr 2, 2013 |first = Roberta|last = Pesce|website = MedCrunch |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; around the same number of [[World War II casualties]]. Just in 2010 alone, 1.23 million people were killed due to traffic collisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/gho/road_safety/mortality/traffic_deaths_number/en/ |title=Number of road traffic deaths |date= |author=World Health Organization |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding the high number of fatalities, the trend of motor vehicle collision is showing a decrease. Road toll figures in developed nations show that car collision fatalities have declined since 1980. Japan is an extreme [[List of motor vehicle deaths in Japan by year|example]], with road deaths decreasing to 5,115 in 2008, which is 25% of the 1970 rate per capita and 17% of the 1970 rate per vehicle distance travelled. In 2008, for the first time, more pedestrians than vehicle occupants were killed in Japan by cars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/pedestrians-become-chief-victims-of-road-accident-deaths-in-2008 Pedestrians become chief victims of road accident deaths in 2008] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090725140530/http://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/pedestrians-become-chief-victims-of-road-accident-deaths-in-2008 |date=2009-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides improving general road conditions like lighting and separated walkways, Japan has been installing [[intelligent transportation system]] technology such as stalled-car monitors to avoid crashes.

In developing nations, statistics may be grossly inaccurate or hard to get. Some nations have not significantly reduced the total death rate, which stands at 12,000 in Thailand in 2007, for example.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.thaihealth.or.th/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=133&amp;Itemid=1 365 Days for Stopping Accident Deaths]&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, twenty-eight states had reductions in the number of automobile crash fatalities between 2005 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoaccidentattorneys.net/injuries/auto-death-state.html People Killed in Motor Vehicle Crashes, by State, 2005-2006]&lt;/ref&gt; 55% of vehicle occupants 16 years or older in 2006 were not using [[seat belts]] when they crashed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=NCSA Research Note (DOT-HS-810-948) |publisher=US [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] |date=May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Road fatality trends tend to follow [[Smeed's law]],&lt;ref name=smeed&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/~jadams/PDFs/smeed%27s%20law.pdf |format=PDF |first=John |last=Adams |publisher=[[University College London]] |title=Smeed's Law : some further thoughts}}&lt;/ref&gt; an empirical schema that correlates increased fatality rates per capita with traffic congestion.

==External and internal costs==
{{Main|Economics of automobile usage}}

===Public or external costs===
{{Main|Externalities of automobiles}}
According to the ''Handbook on estimation of external costs in the transport sector''&lt;ref name="Delft"&gt;
{{cite journal |author1=M. Maibach |author2=C. Schreyer |author3=D. Sutter |author4=H.P. van Essen |author5=B.H. Boon |author6=R. Smokers |author7=A. Schroten |author8=C. Doll |author9=B. Pawlowska|author10 =M. Bak |display-authors=1 |title=Handbook on estimation of external costs in the transport sector |publisher=Delft, February |date=February 2008 |url=http://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/sustainable/doc/2008_costs_handbook.pdf |format=PDF |pages=332 |accessdate=2015-09-20}}
&lt;/ref&gt; made by the [[Delft University]] and which is the main reference in [[European Union]] for assessing the [[Externality|externalities]] of cars, the main external costs of driving a car are:

*[[Traffic congestion|congestion]] and [[scarcity]] costs,
*[[Traffic collision|accident]] costs,
*[[air pollution]] costs,
*[[noise]] costs,
*[[climate change]] costs,
*costs for nature and landscape,
*costs for [[water pollution]],
*costs for [[soil pollution]] and
*costs of [[Energy independence|energy dependency]].

Use of cars for transportation creates barriers by reducing the landscape required for walking and cycling. It may look like a minor problem initially but in the long run, it poses a threat to children and the elderly. Transport is a major [[land use]], leaving less land available for other purposes.

Cars also contribute to pollution of air and water.  Though a horse produces more waste, cars are cheaper, thus far more numerous in urban areas than horses ever were. Emissions of harmful gases like [[carbon monoxide]], ozone, carbon dioxide, benzene and [[particulate matter]] can damage living organisms and the environment.  The emissions from cars cause disabilities, respiratory diseases, and [[ozone depletion]]. [[Noise pollution]] from cars can also potentially result in hearing disabilities, headaches, and stress to those frequently exposed to it.

[[Image:SaoPaulo PrestesMaia.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|left|Congestion is a notorious [[Externalities of automobiles|external cost]] of driving, such as in [[São Paulo]] (pictured).]]

In countries such as the United States the [[transport infrastructure|infrastructure]] that makes car use possible, such as highways, roads and parking lots is funded by the government and supported through zoning and construction requirements.&lt;ref name="Shoup"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=K1qYHgAACAAJ&amp;dq=%22the+high+cost+of+free+parking%22&amp;ei=G56TR8SwMIKg7gLz-sGtBw&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1 The High Cost of Free Parking]'' by [[Donald C. Shoup]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fuel taxes in the United States]] cover about 60% of highway construction and repair costs, but little of the cost to construct or repair local roads.&lt;ref name="Vuchic"&gt;Graph based on data from ''Transportation for Livable Cities'' By Vukan R. Vuchic p. 76. 1999. {{ISBN|0-88285-161-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacKenzie, J.J., R.C. Dower, and D.D.T. Chen. 1992. ''[http://www.wristore.com/goinratwhati.html The Going Rate: What It Really Costs to Drive]''. Washington, DC: World Resources Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; Payments by motor-vehicle users fall short of government expenditures tied to motor-vehicle use by 20–70 cents per gallon of gas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.its.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/delucchi&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zoning]] laws in many areas require that large, [[free parking]] lots accompany any new buildings. Municipal parking lots are often free or do not charge a [[market rate]]. Hence, the cost of driving a car in the US is subsidized, supported by businesses and the government who cover the cost of roads and parking.&lt;ref name="Shoup" /&gt; This is in addition to other external costs car users do not pay like accidents or pollution. Even in countries with higher gas taxes like Germany motorists don't fully pay for the external costs they create.

This government support of the automobile through subsidies for infrastructure, the cost of [[highway patrol]] enforcement, recovering [[Motor vehicle theft|stolen cars]], and many other factors makes public transport a less economically competitive choice for commuters when considering [[Out-of-pocket expenses]]. Consumers often make choices based on those costs, and underestimate the [[indirect costs]] of car ownership, insurance and maintenance.&lt;ref name="Vuchic" /&gt; However, globally and in some US cities, tolls and parking fees partially offset these heavy subsidies for driving. [[Transportation planning]] policy advocates often support tolls, increased fuel taxes, [[congestion pricing]] and market-rate pricing for municipal parking as a means of balancing car use in urban centers with more efficient modes such as buses and trains.

When cities charge [[market rates]] for parking, and when bridges and tunnels are tolled, driving becomes less competitive in terms of out-of-pocket costs. When municipal parking is underpriced and roads are not tolled, most of the cost of vehicle usage is paid for by general government revenue, a subsidy for motor vehicle use. The size of this subsidy dwarfs the federal, state, and local subsidies for the maintenance of infrastructure and discounted fares for public transportation.&lt;ref name="Vuchic" /&gt;

By contrast, although there are environmental and social costs for rail, there is a very small impact.&lt;ref name="Vuchic" /&gt;

Walking or cycling often have net positive impacts on society as they help reduce health costs and produce virtually no pollution.

===Private or internal costs===

Compared to other popular modes of passenger transportation, especially buses or trains, the [[car]] has a relatively high cost per passenger-distance travelled.&lt;ref&gt;

In the United States, out of pocket expenses for car ownership can vary considerably based on the state in which you live.  In 2013, annual car ownership costs including repair, insurance, gas and taxes were highest in Georgia ($4,233) and lowest in Oregon ($2,024) with a national average of $3,201.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bankrate.com/finance/auto/car-ownership-costs-by-state.aspx Car-ownership costs by state.] Retrieved 2013-08-22&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] considers, for [[tax deduction]] calculations, that the automobile has a total cost for drivers in the USA, of 0.55 USD/mile, around 0.26 EUR/km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/uac/IRS-Increases-Mileage-Rate-to-55.5-Cents-per-Mile |title=IRS Increases Mileage Rate to 55.5 Cents per Mile |author=IRS |date=June 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422233138/https://www.irs.gov/uac/IRS-Increases-Mileage-Rate-to-55.5-Cents-per-Mile |archivedate=April 22, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Data provided by the [[American Automobile Association]] indicates that the [[cost of ownership]] for an automobile in the United States is rising about 2% per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcnews.com/business/which-state-most-expensive-driving-6C10962848 Which state is the most expensive for driving?.] Retrieved 2013-08-22&lt;/ref&gt; 2013 data provided by the Canadian Automobile Association concludes that the cost of ownership for a compact car in Canada, including depreciation, insurance, borrowing costs, maintenance, licensing, etc. was CA $9500 per year,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caa.ca/caa-provides-real-picture-of-annual-driving-costs/|title=CAA National|website=www.caa.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; or about US $7300.

====Kinetic speed vs. consumer speed====
The Austrian philosopher [[Ivan Illich]], a critic of the modern society habits, was one of the first thinkers to establish the so-called '''consumer speed''' concept. He wrote in his book ''Energy and Equity''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Illich |first=Ivan |url=http://www.uvm.edu/~asnider/Ivan_Illich/Ivan%20Illich_Energy%20and%20Equity.pdf |date=1974 |title=Energy and Equity |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222231815/https://www.uvm.edu/~asnider/Ivan_Illich/Ivan%20Illich_Energy%20and%20Equity.pdf |archivedate=2015-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1974:

{{Cquote|''The model American male devotes more than 1600 hours a year to his car. He sits in it while it goes and while it stands idling. He parks it and searches for it. He earns the money to put down on it and to meet the monthly installments. He works to pay for gasoline, tolls, insurance, taxes, and tickets. He spends four of his sixteen waking hours on the road or gathering his resources for it. And this figure does not take into account the time consumed by other activities dictated by transport: time spent in hospitals, traffic courts, and garages; time spent watching automobile commercials or attending consumer education meetings to improve the quality of the next buy. The model American puts in 1600 hours to get 7500 miles: less than '''five miles per hour''' [the '''consumer speed''']. In countries deprived of a transportation industry, people manage to do the same, walking wherever they want to go, and they allocate only 3 to 8 percent of their society's time budget to traffic instead of 28 percent. What distinguishes the traffic in rich countries from the traffic in poor countries is not more mileage per hour of lifetime for the majority, but more hours of compulsory consumption of high doses of energy, packaged and unequally distributed by the transportation industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ranprieur.com/readings/illichcars.html |author=Ivan Illich, ''excerpts from Energy and Equity; also collected in Toward a History of Needs'' |title=The industrialization of traffic}}&lt;/ref&gt;''}}

It is known by [[classical mechanics]] that the average [[Kinetics (physics)|kinetic]] [[speed]] &lt;math&gt;v_k&lt;/math&gt; of an automobile and its passengers is simply the amount of space the car travels, divided by the elapsed time, i.e.:
:&lt;math&gt;v_k=\frac{d}{t_t}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the distance travelled by the car and &lt;math&gt;t_t&lt;/math&gt; is the travelled time, i.e., the time elapsed during the travel.

Though, to assess the consumer speed, we must sum the amount of time the car owner strictly allocates to work to afford such travelled distance. Then the consumer speed &lt;math&gt;v_v&lt;/math&gt; is:
:&lt;math&gt;v_v=\frac{d}{t_t+t_w}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;t_w&lt;/math&gt; is the time the driver needs to work, to afford doing that specific travelled distance &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; using such car.

=====Example=====
James (an example), a common car owner and driver who takes his car to get to work, spends totally (standing and running costs) on his car an average of €5000 per year. Considering James just uses his car to get to work and that one year has around 250 [[business day]]s, James pays on average €20 per working day to afford his car. Consider the James' average net salary is €10 per hour; then James needs to work 2 hours per day just to afford his mean of transport to get to work, time strictly allocated to pay his car bills.

If he lives 20&amp;nbsp;km away from his workplace and he gets there in half an hour, then he makes 40&amp;nbsp;km per day during one hour (round trip). His kinetic average speed would then be:
:&lt;math&gt;v_k=\frac{40\ km}{1\ h}=40\ km/h&lt;/math&gt;
Though, James needs on average 2 hours per day just to afford his car, working time budget strictly allocated for paying his car bills, so his consumer speed would be:
:&lt;math&gt;v_v=\frac{40\ km}{1\ h+2\ h}\approx 13\ km/h&lt;/math&gt;
just 1/3 of his kinetic speed.

'''Enhancer RNAs''' (eRNAs) represent a class of relatively short [[non-coding RNA]] molecules (50-2000 nucleotides) transcribed from the DNA sequence of [[Enhancer (genetics)|enhancer]] regions. They were first detected in 2010 through the use of genome-wide techniques such as [[RNA-seq]] and [[ChIP-seq]].&lt;ref name=Kim2010&gt;{{Cite journal

eRNAs are transcribed from [[DNA sequences]] [[upstream and downstream (DNA)|upstream]] and [[Upstream and downstream (DNA)|downstream]] of [[extragenic]] [[Enhancer (genetics)|enhancer]] regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In certain [[Cell (biology)|cell]] types, activated [[enhancers]] have demonstrated the ability to both recruit [[RNA Pol II]] and also provide a template for active [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of their local [[sequences]].&lt;ref name="De Santa2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kim2010 /&gt;

Depending on the directionality of [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]], [[Enhancer (genetics)|enhancer]] regions generate two different types of non-coding [[Transcription (genetics)|transcripts]], 1D-eRNAs and 2D-eRNAs. The nature of the pre-initiation complex and specific [[transcription factors]] recruited to the [[Enhancer (genetics)|enhancer]] may control the type of eRNAs generated. After [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]], the majority of eRNAs remain in the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]].&lt;ref name="Wang2008"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, eRNAs are very unstable and actively degraded by the nuclear [[exosome complex|exosome]]. Not all [[enhancers]] are transcribed, with non-transcribed [[enhancers]] greatly outnumbering the transcribed ones in the order of magnitude of dozens of thousands in every given [[Cell (biology)|cell]] type.&lt;ref name="De Santa2010" /&gt;

===1D eRNAs===

In most cases, unidirectional [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of [[Enhancer (genetics)|enhancer]] regions generates long (&gt;4kb) and polyadenylated eRNAs. [[Enhancers]] that generate polyA+ eRNAs have a lower H3K4me1/me3 ratio in their [[chromatin]] signature than 2D-eRNAs.&lt;ref name=Koch2011 /&gt; PolyA+ eRNAs are distinct from long multiexonic poly transcripts (meRNAs) that are generated by [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] initiation at intragenic [[enhancers]]. These long non-coding RNAs, which accurately reflect the host [[gene]]’s structure except for the alternative first [[exon]], display poor coding potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===2D eRNAs===

Bidirectional [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] at [[Enhancer (genetics)|enhancer]] sites generates comparatively shorter (0.5-2kb) and non-polyadenylated eRNAs. [[Enhancers]] that generate polyA- eRNAs have a [[chromatin]] signature with a higher H3K4me1/me3 ratio than 1D-eRNAs.

==Proposed mechanisms of function==

[[File:Mechanisms of eRNA function.png|thumbnail|Proposed Mechanisms of eRNA Function]]

The notions that not all [[enhancers]] are transcribed at the same time and that eRNA [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] correlates with enhancer-specific activity support the idea that individual eRNAs carry distinct and relevant biological functions.&lt;ref name=Natoli2012 /&gt; However, there is still no [[consensus]] on the functional significance of eRNAs. Furthermore, eRNAs can easily be degraded through [[exosome complex|exosomes]] and [[nonsense-mediated decay]], which limits their potential as important transcriptional regulators.&lt;ref name="Wyers2005"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, four main models of eRNA function have been proposed,&lt;ref name=Natoli2012 /&gt; each supported by different lines of [[experimental]] [[evidence]].

===Transcriptional Noise===

Since multiple studies have shown that [[RNA Pol II]] can be found at a very large number of [[extragenic]] regions, it is possible that eRNAs simply represent the product of random “leaky” [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and carry no functional significance.&lt;ref name="De Santa2010"/&gt; The non-specific activity of RNA Pol II would therefore allow [[extragenic]] transcriptional noise at sites where [[chromatin]] is already in an open and transcriptionally competent state. This would explain even tissue-specific eRNA expression&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

| pmc = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; as open sites are tissue-specific as well.

===Transcription-dependent effects===

[[RNA Pol II]]-mediated [[gene]] [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] induces a local opening of [[chromatin]] state through the recruitment of [[histone acetyltransferases]] and other [[histone]] modifiers that promote [[euchromatin]] formation. It was proposed that the presence of these [[enzymes]] could also induce an opening of [[chromatin]] at [[Enhancer (genetics)|enhancer]] regions, which are usually present at distant locations but can be recruited to target [[genes]] through looping of [[DNA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, eRNAs are therefore expressed in response to [[RNA Pol II]] transcription and therefore carry no [[biological]] function.

===Functional activity in cis===

While the two previous models implied that eRNAs were not functionally relevant, this mechanism states that eRNAs are functional [[molecules]] that exhibit [[cis-acting|cis]] activity. In this model, eRNAs can locally recruit [[regulatory]] [[proteins]] at their own site of synthesis. Supporting this hypothesis, transcripts originating from [[enhancers]] upstream of the [[Cyclin D1]] gene are thought to serve as adaptors for the recruitment of [[histone acetyltransferases]]. It was found that depletion of these eRNAs led to [[Cyclin D1]] transcriptional silencing.&lt;ref name=Wang2008 /&gt;

===Functional activity in trans===

The last model involves [[transcriptional]] regulation by eRNAs at distant [[chromosomal]] locations. Through the differential recruitment of [[protein]] [[Multiprotein complex|complexes]], eRNAs can affect the [[transcriptional]] competency of specific [[locus (genetics)|loci]]. Evf-2 represents a good example of such [[trans-acting|trans]] regulatory eRNA as it can induce the expression of Dlx2, which in turn can increase the activity of the Dlx5 and Dlx6 [[enhancers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Experimental detection==

Furthermore, eRNAs generated by the activation of p53BERs are shown to be required for efficient [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of the [[p53]] target [[genes]], indicating the likely important regulatory role of eRNAs in [[tumor suppression]] and [[cancer]].

Variations in [[enhancers]] have been implicated in human [[disease]] but a [[therapeutic]] approach to manipulate [[Enhancer (genetics)|enhancer]] activity is currently not possible. With the emergence of eRNAs as important components in [[Enhancer (genetics)|enhancer]] activity, powerful [[therapeutic]] tools such as [[RNAi]] may provide promising routes to target disruption of gene expression.

'''Helpers at the nest''' is a term used in [[behavioural ecology]] and [[evolutionary biology]] to describe a social structure in which [[juvenile (organism)|juveniles]] and [[sexually mature]] [[adolescent]]s of either one or both sexes, remain in association with their parents and help them raise subsequent [[offspring|brood]]s or [[litter]]s, instead of dispersing and beginning to reproduce themselves. This phenomenon was first studied in [[bird]]s where it occurs most frequently, but it is also known in animals from many different groups including [[mammal]]s and [[insect]]s. It is a simple form of [[co-operative breeding]].

It occurs in between three and eight percent of bird [[species]] worldwide (estimates vary), but is much more common in [[Australia]] and [[Southern Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jetz, Walter  |author2=Rubenstein, Dustin R.|title=Environmental Uncertainty and the Global Biogeography of Cooperative Breeding in Birds|journal=Current Biology|volume= 21|issue=1|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49708773_Environmental_uncertainty_and_the_global_biogeography_of_cooperative_breeding_in_birds|pages= 72–78|year=2011|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2010.11.075|pmid=21185192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McMahon T.A. and Finlayson, B. (1992) ''Global Runoff: Continental Comparisons of Annual Flows and Peak Discharges'', Catena Verlag, {{ISBN|3-923381-27-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bird species in which this behaviour is found include the [[common moorhen]], the [[acorn woodpecker]], and the [[apostlebird]]. The [[sugar glider]]{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} and [[human]]s are examples of mammals that exhibit this behaviour. It is also seen in a number of species of bee such as [[carpenter bee]]s (note this is distinct from the behaviour of the [[European honey bee]], where the worker bees are sterile and incapable of reproducing).

The term "helper" was coined by [[Alexander Skutch]] in 1935&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/Auk/v052n03/p0257-p0273.pdf|author=Skutch, A. F. |year=1935|title=Helpers at the nest|journal=Auk|volume= 52|pages=257–273|issue=3|doi=10.2307/4077738}}&lt;/ref&gt; and defined more carefully in 1961 in the avian context as "a bird which assists in the nesting of an individual other than its mate, or feeds or otherwise attends a bird of whatever age which is neither its mate nor its dependent offspring." The term has been criticised as being [[anthropomorphic]], but it remains in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Brown, J. L. |year=1978|title=Avian communal breeding systems|journal=Annu. Rev. Ecol. Syst.|volume=9|pages=123–155|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.09.110178.001011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three explanations for the occurrence of helpers at the nest have been put forward; they are not mutually exclusive, and in any particular species an investigation of the exact benefits and costs will be needed to see what combination of these factors may have driven the evolution of helping.&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson, J. L.; Hatchwell, B. J. (2004) "Fitness consequences of helping" in ''Ecology and evolution of cooperative breeding in birds'' by Walter D. Koenig, Janis L. Dickinson. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-53099-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Advantage to the helpers, who may be protected from predation, or gain skills that they will need when they subsequently reproduce, as a result of staying in the parental nest.
*[[Kin selection]]: since subsequent litters or broods from the same parents will be full siblings to the helpers, they are as closely related genetically as their own offspring would be. Helping their parents is therefore as productive for the juveniles as reproducing themselves would be, and if their parents are better able to reproduce, the balance of advantage may be greater.
*Delayed advantage to the helpers, in particular because they stand to inherit their parents' [[territory (animal)|territory]]; this explanation is particularly compelling if suitable territories are in short supply, but requires specific quantitative conditions to be met, favouring a stable queue of potential heirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wiley, R. H. |author2=Rabenold, K. N. |year=1984 |title=The evolution of cooperative breeding by delayed reciprocity and queuing for favorable social positions |url=http://bilbo.bio.purdue.edu/~www_eco/faculty/rabenold/pdfs/EvoCooperativeBreeding%20by%20delayed%20reciprocity.pdf |journal=Evolution |volume=38 |pages=609–621 |doi=10.2307/2408710 |issue=3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617053619/http://bilbo.bio.purdue.edu/~www_eco/faculty/rabenold/pdfs/EvoCooperativeBreeding%20by%20delayed%20reciprocity.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is frequently assumed that helpers are non-breeders, molecular evidence suggests that this may happen, and the term "secondary helper" is sometimes used in this case to indicate helpers that mate with or are not related offspring of the pair being assisted. The term "primary helper" being used for the commoner case of the helper being offspring of the pair and not involved in mating.&lt;ref&gt;Ligon, J. D.; Burt, D. B. (2004) "Evolutionary origins" in ''Ecology and evolution of cooperative breeding in birds'' by Walter D. Koenig, Janis L. Dickinson. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-53099-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extrapair mates are chosen by the females and are these then contribute to the care of the young who may be sired by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Female extrapair mate choice in a cooperative breeder: trading sex for help and increasing offspring heterozygosity|author = Rubenstein, DR |doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.0424 |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |year= 2007|volume=274| issue=1620 | pages=1895–1903|pmid=17526455|pmc=2270931 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Juveniles living in association with their parents cannot automatically be regarded as helpers. In a number of species, such as [[Orthonychidae|the logrunners]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Frith, C.B., Frith, D.W. &amp; Jansen, A. |year=1997|title=The nesting biology of the Chowchilla ''Orthonyx spaldingii'' (Orthonychidae)|doi=10.1071/MU97002|journal=Emu|volume=97|pages=18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Siberian jay]], young remain in the parental territory, but never help feed nestlings. However the delayed advantage explanation for the juveniles' association with their parents can still work in the absence of effective helping, whereas the kin selection explanation cannot.

'''Impurities''' are [[chemical substance]]s inside a confined amount of [[liquid]], [[gas]], or [[solid]], which differ from the [[chemical composition]] of the material or compound.

Impurities are either naturally occurring or added during [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]] of a chemical or commercial product. During production, impurities may be purposely, accidentally, inevitably, or incidentally added into the substance.

The levels of impurities in a material are generally defined in relative terms.  [[standardization|Standards]] have been established by various organizations that attempt to define the permitted levels of various impurities in a manufactured product.  Strictly speaking, then a material's level of purity can only be stated as being more or less pure than some other material.

==Destructive impurities== 

Impurities can be destructive when they obstruct the working nature of the material. Examples include [[wiktionary:ash|ash]] and [[debris]] in [[metals]] and leaf pieces in blank white papers. The removal of impurities is usually done chemically. For example, in the manufacturing of [[iron]], calcium carbonate is added to the [[blast furnace]] to remove [[silicon dioxide]] from the [[iron ore]]. [[Zone refining]] is an economically important method for the purification of semiconductors.

However, some kinds of impurities can be removed by physical means. A mixture of water and [[salt]] can be separated by [[distillation]], with water as the distillate and salt as the solid [[residue (chemistry)|residue]]. Impurities are usually physically removed from liquids and gases. Removal of sand particles from metal ore is one example with solids.

No matter what method is used, it is usually impossible to separate an impurity completely from a material. The reason that it is impossible to remove impurities completely is of thermodynamic nature and is predicted by the second law of thermodynamics. Removing impurities completely means reducing the [[entropy]] of the system to zero. This would require an infinite amount of work and energy as predicted by the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. What technicians can do is to increase the purity of a material to as near 100% as possible or economically feasible.

==Impurities and nucleation==
When an impure liquid is cooled to its [[melting point]] the liquid, undergoing a [[phase transition]], [[crystal]]lizes around the impurities and becomes a crystalline solid. If there are no impurities then the liquid is said to be pure and can be [[supercooled]] below its melting point without becoming a solid. This occurs because the liquid has nothing to condense around so the solid cannot form a natural crystalline solid. The solid is eventually formed when [[dynamic arrest]] or [[glass transition]] occurs, but it forms into an [[amorphous solid]]&amp;nbsp;– a [[glass]], instead, as there is no [[long-range order]] in the structure.

Impurities play an important role in the nucleation of other phase transitions.   For example, the presence of foreign elements may have important effects on the mechanical and magnetic properties of metal alloys.  Iron atoms in copper cause the renowned [[Kondo effect]] where the conduction electron spins form a magnetic bound state with the impurity atom.    Magnetic impurities in [[superconductors]] can serve as generation sites for [[vortex]] defects.   Point defects can nucleate reversed domains in [[ferromagnet]]s and dramatically affect their [[coercivity]].  In general impurities are able to serve as initiation points for [[phase transition]]s because the energetic cost of creating a finite-size [[Domain wall (magnetism)|domain]] of a new phase is lower at a point defect. In order for the nucleus of a new phase to be stable, it must reach a critical size. This threshold size is often lower at an impurity site.

'''Karl Konrad Friedrich Wilhelm Lachmann''' ({{IPA-de|ˈlaxman|lang}}; 4 March 1793 – 13 March 1851) was a [[Germany|German]] [[philologist]] and [[critic]]. He is particularly noted for his foundational contributions to the field of [[textual criticism]].

==Biography==

Lachmann was born in [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]], in present-day [[Lower Saxony]]. He studied at [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] and [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]], devoting himself mainly to philological studies. In [[Göttingen]], he founded a critical and philological society in 1811, in conjunction with [[Georg Ludolf Dissen|Dissen]], [[Ernst Schulze (poet)|Schulze]], and [[Christian Charles Josias von Bunsen|Bunsen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AmCyc|wstitle=Lachmann, Karl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite ADB|17|471|481|Lachmann, Karl|Wilhelm Scherer|ADB:Lachmann, Karl}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1815, he joined the [[Prussian army]] as a volunteer ''[[chasseur]]'' and accompanied his detachment to [[Paris]], but did not see active service. In 1816, he became an assistant master in the Friedrichswerder [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] at Berlin, and a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' at the university. The same summer he became one of the principal masters in the Friedrichs-Gymnasium of [[Königsberg]], where he assisted his colleague, the Germanist [[Friedrich Karl Köpke]], with his edition of [[Rudolf von Ems]]' ''[[Barlaam und Josaphat]]'' (1818), and also assisted his friend in a contemplated edition of the works of [[Walther von der Vogelweide]].

In January 1818, he became professor extraordinarius of classical philology in the [[University of Königsberg]], and at the same time began to lecture on [[Old German]] [[grammar]] and the [[Middle High German]] poets. He devoted himself during the following seven years to an extraordinarily detailed study of those subjects, and in 1824, obtained a leave of absence in order to search the libraries of middle and south Germany for further materials.

In 1825, Lachmann was nominated extraordinary professor of classical and German philology at the [[Humboldt University]], Berlin (ordinary professor 1827); in 1830, he was admitted a member of the [[Academy of Sciences]]. He died in [[Berlin]].

==Importance in scholarship==

Lachmann is a figure of considerable importance in the history of German philology.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Rudolf von Raumer]], ''Geschichte der germanischen Philologie'', 1870.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in his career, Lachmann translated the first volume of P.E. Müller's ''Sagabibliothek des skandinavischen Altertums'' (1816). In his ''"Habilitationsschrift" über die ursprungliche Gestalt des Gedichts von der Nibelungen Noth'' (1816), and in his review of [[Friedrich Heinrich von der Hagen|Hagen]]'s ''Nibelungen'' and [[Georg Friedrich Benecke|Benecke]]'s ''Bonerius'', contributed in 1817 to the ''Jenaische Literaturzeitung'', he had already laid down the rules of [[textual criticism]] and elucidated the phonetic and metrical principles of Middle High German in a manner which marked a distinct advance in that branch of investigation.

The rigidly scientific character of his method becomes increasingly apparent in the ''Auswahl aus den hochdeutschen Dichtern des dreizehnten Jahrhunderts'' (1820); in the edition of [[Hartmann von Aue|Hartmann]]'s ''Iwein'' (1827); in those of Walther von der Vogelweide (1827) and [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]] (1833); in the papers "''Über das [[Hildebrandslied]]''," "''Über althochdeutsche Betonung und Verskunst''," "''Über den Eingang des Parzivals''," and "''Über drei Bruchstücke niederrheinischer Gedichte''" published in the ''Abhandlungen'' of the Berlin Academy; and in ''Der Nibelunge Not und die Klage'' (1826), which was followed by a critical commentary in 1836.

Lachmann's ''Betrachtungen über Homer's Iliad'', first published in the ''Abhandlungen'' of the Berlin Academy in 1837 and 1841, in which he sought to show that the ''[[Iliad]]'' consists of eighteen independent "layers" variously enlarged and interpolated, had considerable influence on 19th century [[Homeric scholarship]], although his views are no longer accepted.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

His smaller edition of the [[New Testament]] appeared in 1831, the 3rd edition in 1846, and the larger second edition, in two volumes, between 1842 and 1850. The plan of Lachmann's edition, which he explained in his ''Studia Krit.'' of 1830, is a modification of the unaccomplished project of [[Richard Bentley]]. Lachmann was the first major editor to break from the [[Textus Receptus]], seeking to restore the most ancient reading current in [[manuscript]]s of the [[Alexandrian text-type]], using the agreement of the [[Western text-type|Western]] authorities ([[Old Latin]] and Greek Western [[Uncial]]s) as the main proof of antiquity of a reading where the oldest Alexandrian authorities differ.

Lachmann's edition of [[Lucretius]] (1850), which was the principal occupation of his life from 1845, is perhaps his greatest achievement of scholarship. He demonstrated how the three main manuscripts all derived from one [[archetype]], containing 302 pages of 26 lines to a page. Further, he was able to show that this archetype was a copy of a manuscript written in a [[Carolingian minuscule|minuscule]] hand, which was in turn a copy of a manuscript of the 4th or 5th centuries written in [[rustic capitals]]. To say his recreation of the text was accepted is anticlimactic; [[Hugh Andrew Johnstone Munro|HAJ Munro]] characterized this accomplishment as "a work which will be a landmark for scholars as long as the Latin language continues to be studied." Lachmann also edited [[Propertius]] (1816); [[Catullus]] (1829); [[Tibullus]] (1829); [[Joseph Genesius|Genesius]] (1834); [[Terentianus Maurus]] (1836); [[Babrius]] (1845); [[Avianus]] (1845); [[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]] (1841–1842); the ''Agrimensores Romani'' (1848–1852); and [[Lucilius]] (edited after his death by [[Johannes Vahlen|Vahlen]], 1876). He also translated [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s sonnets (1820) and ''[[Macbeth]]'' (1829).

The '''Khan Research Laboratories''',&lt;ref name="origin" /&gt; previously known at various times as '''Project-706''', '''Engineering Research Laboratories''', and '''Kahuta Research Laboratories''', is a [[Pakistan Government]]'s multi-program [[Ministry of Science and Technology (Pakistan)|national research institute]], managed and operated under the scrutiny of [[Pakistan Armed Forces]], located in [[Kahuta]], [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab Province]].&lt;ref name=ABC-CLIO&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moltz|first1=Sarah J. Diehl, James Clay|title=Nuclear weapons and nonproliferation : a reference handbook|date=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=1598840711|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laboratories are one of the largest science and technology institutions in Pakistan, and conduct multidisciplinary research and development in fields such as [[national security]], [[space exploration]], and [[Supercomputing in Pakistan|supercomputing]].&lt;ref name="Federation of American Scientists" /&gt;

While the laboratories remain highly classified, the KRL is most famous for its research, development, and production of [[Enriched uranium#Highly enriched uranium (HEU)|Highly-Enriched Uranium]] (HEU), using [[gas centrifuge]] ([[Zippe-type centrifuge|Zippe-type]]) technological methods roughly based on the model of the [[Urenco Group]]—the technology brought by Dr. [[Abdul Qadeer Khan]], who worked there as a senior scientist.&lt;ref name="Federation of American Scientists"/&gt;  Since its inception, there has been a large number of employed technical staff members with majority being [[physicists]] and [[mathematician]]s, assisted by [[engineers]] (both army and civilians), [[chemist]]s, and [[material scientist]]s.&lt;ref name="GC University Press"/&gt;  Professional scientists and engineers are also delegated to visit this institute after going under close and strict screening and background check, to participate as visitors in scientific projects.&lt;ref name="GC University Press"&gt;{{cite web|last1=et. al. unknown (staff writer)|title=Sample Preparation Facilities|url=http://gcu.edu.pk/CASP.htm|publisher=GC University Press|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the midst of the 1970s, the laboratories were the cornerstone of the first stage of Pakistan' [[Pakistan and its Nuclear Deterrent Program|atomic bomb project]], being one of the various sites where the classified scientific research on atomic bombs were undertaken.&lt;ref name="Federation of American Scientists"/&gt;

==History==
{{Main|Kahuta Project}}

As early as the 1970s, the early stage of the Pakistan's [[Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction|atomic bomb program]] focused on its primary efforts on producing and developing a [[Weapons-grade#Weapons-grade plutonium|weapons-grade]] [[plutonium]] [[Nuclear device|device]] under the research led by [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission]] (PAEC).&lt;ref name="Stanford University Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Khan|first1=Feroz Hassan|title=Eating grass : the making of the Pakistan bomb|date=2012|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, Calif. [u.s]|isbn=9780804776004|pages=521|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yGgrNAsKZjEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=eating+grass+pakistan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xflJVLr8KeLuigKlgYHADg&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=eating%20grass%20pakistan&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, [[India]] conducted a surprise [[nuclear test]] ([[Pokhran-I|''Smiling Buddha'']]), the [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission|PAEC]] launched a clandestine [[uranium enrichment]] project with [[Nuclear engineering|nuclear engineer]] [[Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood|Sultan Mahmood]] becoming its director; Dr. [[Abdul Qadeer Khan]] joined the program in 1974.&lt;ref name="Stanford University Press"/&gt; Work at the Kahuta site was initiated by [[Prime minister of Pakistan|Prime minister]] [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]].&lt;ref name="The News International, 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Directorate-General for the Public Relations and Media Broadcasting Publications" /&gt;

After disagreeing with [[Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood|Sultan Mahmood]]'s calculation and feasibility report submitted to the government, [[Prime minister of Pakistan|Prime minister]] [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] detached the work from the [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission|PAEC]] and made Dr. [[Abdul Qadeer Khan]] the director of the [[uranium enrichment]] project in 1976. The [[uranium enrichment|uranium project]] was moved to [[Kahuta Tehsil|Kahuta]] where the project was established as Engineering Research Laboratories (ERL). According to Dr. [[A.Q. Khan]], materials were imported from Europe with the help of two procurement officers; one of them was Engineer Ikramul Haq Khan, deputed to KRL via [[Major General Syed Ali Nawab|Gen Ali Nawab]], Chairman [[Pakistan Ordnance Factories|POF]] (1976–1981). The other was Mr. Jamil who worked out of the office of PATLO in the Pakistan High Commission in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-9-279343-Unsung-heroes |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627145333/http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-9-279343-Unsung-heroes |archivedate=27 June 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-9-278025-Unsung-heroes |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627145342/http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-9-278025-Unsung-heroes |archivedate=27 June 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wanting a capable administrator, Bhutto asked the [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of Army Staff]] for the selection, and the [[Engineer-in-Chief (Pakistan Army)|Engineer-in-Chief]] chose [[Brigadier]] [[Zahid Ali Akbar]] to lead the program.&lt;ref name="The News International, 2009" /&gt; Because the experiments were deemed too dangerous to conduct in a major city, the operations were moved in a remote mountainous [[Northern Areas|northern areas]] of Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Susanne Koelbl of the Spiegel Online" /&gt;  The entire site and the [[Kahuta]] was rebuilt by the [[Pakistan Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]] under [[Lieutenant-General]] [[Zahid Ali Akbar]], with logistics provided by [[Military Engineering Service]].&lt;ref name="Susanne Koelbl of the Spiegel Online"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DIrectorate of Inter-Services Public Relations"/&gt;&lt;ref name="News iNternational, Part-XIII"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ibid.|title=Part-XIII|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-9-275655-Unsung-heroes|accessdate=24 October 2014|agency=News iNternational|publisher=News iNternational, Part-XIII|date=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conducting a classified research, the facility was heavy secured by both the [[Pakistan Army]] and the [[Pakistan Air Force]] (PAF).&lt;ref name="Susanne Koelbl of the Spiegel Online"/&gt;  All employees needed badges to pass a checkpoint, and the laboratories are electronically fenced and guarded.&lt;ref name="Susanne Koelbl of the Spiegel Online"/&gt;

The ERL was intended to spur innovation and provide competition to the nuclear [[nuclear weapon design|weapon-design]] at the [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission|PAEC]].&lt;ref name="Stanford University Press"/&gt; Some renowned scientists preferably Dr. G.D. Alam (Theoretical physicist) from [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission|PAEC]] had joined the ERL and enriched the uranium at Kahuta. Dr. Anwar Ali and some other scientists also support him.&lt;ref name="News International, Part X"/&gt;&lt;ref name="News International, Part XII"&gt;{{cite news|last1=From the Memoirs of Dr. A.Q. Khan|title=Part XII|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-9-274235-Unsung-heroes|accessdate=24 October 2014|agency=News International|publisher=News International, Part XII|date=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site quickly installed thousands of [[gas centrifuge]]s, using the [[Zippe-type centrifuge|Zippe method]], to run at about 65,000[[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] for an average of 10 years.  The [[Uranium-235|U&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;]] containing only ~0.7% [[Enrichment of uranium|enriched]] material is brought to more than 90.0% through three stages of enrichment, leaving the original material [[Depleted uranium|depleted]] from 0.7% to 0.2%, which then now at both civilian and [[Weapon-grade|military-grade]].&lt;ref name="News International, Part XII"/&gt; In the 1970s, the ERL heavily depended on [[URENCO]]'s method but lessened the dependence in 1979 after local methods were developed. Unverified claims were made by KRL in [[Fiscal year|1983–84]] of conducting [[nuclear weapon design|weapon-design]] [[List of nuclear weapons tests|tests]].&lt;ref name="News International, Part XII" /&gt; After visiting the site in May 1981, [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] renamed the ERL as {{small|'''Khan Research Laboratory (KRL)'''}} in the honor of its founder and senior scientist [[Abdul Qadeer Khan]].&lt;ref name="Federation of American Scientists (FAS)"/&gt; The KRL established a system of [[Computer numerical control|numerical control]] to control the [[Ultracentrifuge|centrifuges]] in 1983. By 1986, the KRL began producing the [[High-enriched uranium|HEU]]s as well as developing the [[Krytron]] while classified work on the uranium [[nuclear weapon design|weapon-design]] took place with &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;[[uranium hexafluoride|UF]] being reduced to [[uranium metal]] and machined into weapon pits. The KRL began publishing series of academic articles on [[Numerical methods|numerics]] and [[Computational Science and Engineering|computational methods]] on centrifuge design, including a 1987 article co-authored by Qadeer Khan on techniques for balancing sophisticated [[ultracentrifuge]] rotors.&lt;ref&gt;Upadhyaya, Gopal S. (2011). "§Dr. A.Q. Khan of Pakistan". Men of Metals and Materials: My Memoires. Bloomington, Indiana, United States: iUniverse.com. p. 248pp. {{ISBN|9698500006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, KRL became a home of a number of the most high-performance [[High-performance computing|supercomputer]] and [[parallel computing]] systems that were installed at the facility.&lt;ref name="News International, Part X"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ibid. et. al.|title=Part-X|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-9-271543-Unsung-heroes|accessdate=24 October 2014|agency=News International|publisher=News International, Part X|date=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A parallel [[Computational Fluid Dynamics]] (CFD) division was established which specialized in conducting high performance [[Computational science|computations]] on [[shock waves]] in [[nuclear weapons|weapons effect]] from the outer surface to the inner core by using the difficult [[differential equations]] of the state of the materials used in the bomb under high pressure.&lt;ref name="News International, Part XII" /&gt;

In an investigative reports published by [[Nuclear Threat Initiative|NTI]], the [[PR China|Chinese]] scientists were reportedly present at [[Kahuta]] in early 1980s— an unconfirmed indicator of Chinese assistance in the development of equipment at Kahuta.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/pakistan/kahuta.htm Khan Research Laboratories]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the [[U.S. intelligence community|U.S. intelligence]] maintained that [[People's Republic of China|China]] provided [[Magnetic field|magnetic rings]] for special suspension bearings mounted at the top of rotating centrifuge cylinders. In 2005, it was revealed that [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia]]'s [[Zia regime|military government]] had the KRL to run a project of HEU programme in the [[Chinese nuclear weapons program|Chinese nuclear program]].&lt;ref name="Kan, Shirley A. 2009 pp. 5" /&gt; Abdul Qadeer Khan also alleged that "KRL has built a centrifuge facility for China in [[Hanzhong]] province".&lt;ref name="Kan, Shirley A. 2009 pp. 5"/&gt;

==Extended research==

The KRL supports and provides research opportunities program at the [[Government College University, Lahore|Government College University]] (GCU) in [[Lahore]]; it supports its physics program through funding and providing scholarship to physics and engineering students at the [[Government College University, Lahore|Government College University]].&lt;ref name="GC University Press release"&gt;{{cite news|last1=staff writer, et. al. |first1=Dept.

==National security program==

Apart from researching on uranium and developing the uranium enrichment facilities, the KRL includes a [[ballistic missile]]-space research laboratories&lt;ref name="globalsecurity.org" /&gt; that competes with the [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission|PAEC]] to produce advanced ballistic missiles ranging for targeting enemy combatant targets and the space exploration. Its space-missile exploration projects based on producing the [[Liquid fuels|liquid fuel]] [[liquid fuel rocket|rockets]] in comparison to [[solid fuel]] [[solid-fuel rocket|rockets]] projects of the  [[National Development Complex]] (NDC). The KRL's missile projects are widely believed to be based on North Korean technology; exchanges took place in the late 1990s. The following missiles have been produced by KRL:&lt;ref name="nti.org" /&gt;
* [[Ghauri (missile)|Ghauri I]] (Hatf V) – first tested in 1999.
* [[Ghauri-II|Ghauri II]] – has a range of 2,000–2,500&amp;nbsp;km.
* [[Hatf-I]]

The KRL performs variety of weapons science and engineering projects for Pakistan Armed Forces. Since the 1980s, the KRL is involved in numerous military equipment and conventional weaponry development projects. The resulting systems have been put into service by the Pakistan's military and exported to other friendly nations. The following is a list of known equipment produced under these projects:&lt;ref name="globalsecurity.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nti.org"/&gt;

* Guided missiles:
** [[Anza (missile)|Anza series]] of [[MANPADS|man-portable air defence system]]s.
** [[Baktar-Shikan]] man-portable [[anti-tank guided missile]] (ATGM) system.
** Modules for the [[BGM-71 TOW]] ATGM.
* Electrical and electronic equipment:
** [[Power conditioner]]s for the above missile systems.
** [[Switched-mode power supply|Switched-mode power supplies]] for the following air defence systems:
*** LAADS radar, [[Skyguard radar]], Air Defense Automation System.
* Equipment for clearance of anti-personnel and anti-tank mines, including remote control mine exploders (RCME) and mine-sweeping line charges.
* Laser equipment:
** [[Laser range-finder]]s, [[laser warning receiver]]s, laser aiming devices, a laser actuated targeting system for training [[main battle tank|tank]] gunners.
* [[Reactive armour]] kits for armoured vehicles and APFS-DS anti-tank ammunition for [[main battle tank]]s.
* Digital [[goniometer]]s.

KRL is said to have entered into an agreement with Malaysian businessman [[Shah Hakim Zain]] to export weapons to Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malaysia-today.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=33258:round-five-bsa-tahir-was-merely-the-fall-guy&amp;catid=22:the-corridors-of-power&amp;Itemid=100085 Malaysia Today Article]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="origin"&gt;Originally, the concept was conceived during the post-[[Indo-Pakistani war of 1971|1971 war]], and the programme was launched in 1974 under the codename "'''Project-706'''". In 1976, the laboratories was founded in 1976 as a highly sensitive, centralized, and secretive facility to coordinate the scientific research for the clandestine [[Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction|atomic bomb project]]. The laboratories were founded by Abdul Qadeer Khan who served its senior scientist at first, and was built under the engineering management of the Corps of Engineers. Since 1976, the laboratories has been multiply referred as to "Engineering Research Laboratories (ERL)"; the "Kahuta Research Laboratories (KRL)"; Dr. A. Q.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3800">'''King Ahaz's seal''' is a [[Bulla (seal)|bulla]] (impressed piece of clay) originating from the 8th century BCE. The place of discovery of this seal is unknown, and it is currently part of [[Shlomo Moussaieff (businessman)|Shlomo Moussaieff]]'s private collection. The seal contains an [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet|ancient Hebrew]] inscription mentioning the name of [[Ahaz]] of Judah, as well as the name of his father, [[Jotham of Judah|Yehotam]] (Jotham), identifying Ahaz as the "king of Judah". The bulla contains a fingerprint which may belong to Ahaz himself.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.archaeological-center.com/en/monographs/m1&lt;/ref&gt;

Another extra-biblical source regarding the historicity of Ahaz comes from [[Tiglath-Pileser III]], mentioning tributes he received in gold and silver from Ahaz, and from the bulla known as [[Ushna seal]].&lt;ref&gt;Caiger, Stephen L. Bible and Spade, Oxford University Press, 1936&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authenticity==
[[Provenance|Unprovenanced]] artifacts that originate in the antiquities market are subject to authentication disputes.

The universal answer of all experts in the field is no. It is simply impossible to fake them."]&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as Andrew Vaughn, agree that it would be difficult to fake a bulla, but do not rule out such a possibility, and in fact conclude that some bullae are forgeries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://magazine.bible-translation.net/upload/2891/Real_or_Fake_A_Special_Report.pdf Hershel Shanks, Jerusalem Forgery Conference Report, p. 27]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Orte und Landschaften der Bibel.

The '''linear no-threshold model''' ('''LNT''') is a model used in [[radiation protection]] to quantify radiation exposure and set regulatory limits. It is most frequently used to calculate the probability of [[radiation induced cancer]] at both high doses where [[epidemiology]] studies support its application but, controversially, it likewise finds applications in calculating the effects of low doses, a dose region that is fraught with much less [[statistical significance|statistical confidence]] in its predictive power but that nonetheless has resulted in major personal and policy decisions in regards to [[public health]]. The model assumes that the long-term, biological damage caused by [[ionizing radiation]] (essentially the cancer risk) is directly proportional to the [[Effective dose (radiation)|dose]]. This allows the summation by [[dosimeter]]s of all radiation exposure, without taking into consideration dose levels or dose rates.&lt;ref&gt;"In the absence of more conclusive data, scientists have assumed that even the smallest radiation exposure carries a risk." [http://www.gao.gov/new.items/rc00152.pdf GAO study]&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, radiation is always considered harmful with no safety threshold, and the sum of several very small exposures are considered to have the same effect as one larger exposure (response linearity).

One of the organizations for establishing recommendations on radiation protection guidelines internationally, the [[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation|UNSCEAR]], recommended in 2014 policies that do not agree with the Linear No-Threshold model at exposure levels below background levels of radiation to the UN General Assembly from the Fifty-Ninth Session of the Committee. Its recommendation states that "the Scientific Committee does not recommend multiplying very low doses by large numbers of individuals to estimate numbers of radiation-induced health effects within a population exposed to incremental doses at levels equivalent to or lower than natural background levels." This is a reversal from previous recommendations by the same organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/V12/553/85/PDF/V1255385.pdf?OpenElement |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805144608/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/V12/553/85/PDF/V1255385.pdf?OpenElement |archivedate=5 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }} UNSCEAR Fifty-Ninth Session 21–25 May 2012 | Published 14 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three active (2016) challenges to the LNT model currently being considered by the US [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]]. One was filed by [[Nuclear Medicine]] Professor Carol Marcus of [[UCLA]], who calls the LNT model scientific "baloney".&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-a-little-radiation-so-bad-1471014742  Is a Little Dose of Radiatoion So Bad?], ''Wall Street Journal'', Aug 13, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether the model describes the reality for small-dose exposures is disputed. It opposes two competing schools of thought: the [[threshold model]], which assumes that very small exposures are harmless, and the [[radiation hormesis]] model, which claims that radiation at very small doses can be beneficial. Because the current data are inconclusive, scientists disagree on which model should be used. Pending any definitive answer to these questions and the [[precautionary principle]], the model is sometimes used to quantify the cancerous effect of [[collective dose]]s of low-level radioactive contaminations, even though it estimates a positive number of excess deaths at levels that would have had zero deaths, or saved lives, in the two other models. Such practice has been condemned by the [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrp.org/publication.asp?id=ICRP%20Publication%20103 ICRP publication 103], §66&lt;/ref&gt;

The LNT model is sometimes applied to other cancer hazards such as [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s in drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/safewater/contaminants/dw_contamfs/pcbs.html  ''Consumer Factsheet on: polychlorinated biphenyls'']  US Environment Protection Agency.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Increased risk with dose.svg|thumb|right|Increased Risk of Solid Cancer with Dose for [[Hibakusha|A-bomb survivors]], from BEIR report. Notably this exposure pathway occurred from essentially a massive spike or pulse of radiation, a result of the brief instant that the bomb exploded, which while somewhat similar to the environment of a [[CT scan]], it is wholly unlike the low ''[[dose rate]]'' of living in a contaminated area such as [[Chernobyl]], were the ''dose rate'' is orders of magnitude smaller. However LNT does not consider [[dose rate]] and is an unsubstantiated [[one size fits all]] approach based solely on total [[absorbed dose]]. When the two environments and cell effects are vastly different. Likewise, it has also been pointed out that bomb survivors inhaled carcinogenic [[benzopyrene]] from the burning cities, yet this is not factored in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Radiology|date=April 2009 |volume= 251|issue=1|pages= 13–22|doi= 10.1148/radiol.2511080671|pmid=19332842 |pmc= 2663584|title=The Linear No-Threshold Relationship Is Inconsistent with Radiation Biologic and Experimental Data|last1=Tubiana |first1=M. |last2=Feinendegen |first2=L. E. |last3=Yang |first3=C. |last4=Kaminski |first4=J. M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

The association of exposure to radiation with cancer had been observed as early as 1902, six years after the discovery of [[X-ray]] by [[Wilhelm Röntgen]] and [[radioactivity]] by [[Henri Becquerel]].&lt;ref name="kathren"&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://scholars.unh.edu/unh_lr/vol1/iss1/5/|journal=University of New Hampshire Law Review |volume= 1|issue= 1|date=December 2002 |title=Historical Development of the Linear Nonthreshold Dose-Response Model as Applied to Radiation|author=Ronald L. Kathren }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, [[Hermann Joseph Muller|Hermann Muller]] demonstrated that radiation may cause genetic mutation and suggested that the mutation rate may be related to dose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Muller - Nobel Lecture|date= December 12, 1946|work=Nobel Prize}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early studies were based on relatively high levels of radiation that made it hard to establish the safety of low level of radiation, and many scientists at that time believed that there may be a tolerance level, and that low doses of radiation may not be harmful. A later study in 1955 on mice exposed to low dose of radiation suggest that they may outlive control animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Long-Term Effects of Acute and Chronic Irradiation in Mice. I. Survival and Tumor Incidence Following Chronic Irradiation of 0.11 r Per Day|authors=Egon Lorenz  Joanne Weikel Hollcroft  Eliza Miller  Charles C. Congdon Robert Schweisthal |journal=Journal of the National Cancer Institute|volume= 15|issue= 4|date= 1 February 1955 |pages= 1049–1058|doi=10.1093/jnci/15.4.1049 |pmid= 13233949}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interest in the effect of radiation intensified after the dropping of atomic bombs on [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]], and studies were conducted on the survivors. Although compelling evidence on the effect of low dosage of radiation was hard to come by, by the late 1940s, the idea of LNT became more popular due to its mathematical simplicity.  In 1954, the [[National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements]] (NCRP) introduced the concept of maximum permissible dose. In 1958, [[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation]] (UNSCEAR) assessed the LNT model and a threshold model, but noted the difficulty in acquiring "reliable information about the correlation between small doses and their effects either in individuals or in large populations". The [[United States Congress Joint Committee on Atomic Energy]] (JCAE) similarly could not establish if there is a threshold or "safe" level for exposure, nevertheless it introduced the concept of "[[ALARP|As Low As Reasonably Achievable]]" (ALARA). ALARA would become a fundamental principle in radiation protection policy that implicitly accepts the validity of LNT.  In 1959, United States Federal Radiation Council (FRC) supported the concept of the LNT extrapolation down to the low dose region in its first report.&lt;ref name="kathren"/&gt; 

By the 1970s, the LNT model had become accepted as the standard in radiation protection practice by a number of bodies.&lt;ref name="kathren"/&gt;  In 1972, the first report of National Academy of Sciences (NAS) [[Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation]] (BEIR), an expert panel who reviewed available peer reviewed literature, supported the LNT model on pragmatic grounds, noting that while "dose-effect relationship for x rays and gamma rays may not be a linear function", the "use of linear extrapolation . . . may be justified on pragmatic grounds as a basis for risk estimation." In its seventh report of 2006, NAS BEIR VII writes, "the committee concludes that the preponderance of information indicates that there will be some risk, even at low doses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dels.nas.edu/resources/static-assets/materials-based-on-reports/reports-in-brief/beir_vii_final.pdf |title=Beir VII: Health Risks from Exposure to Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation |work= The National Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Radiation precautions and public policy==
{{See also|Health effects of sun exposure}}
Radiation precautions have led to [[sunlight]] being listed as a carcinogen at all sun exposure rates, due to the [[ultraviolet]] component of sunlight, with no safe level of sunlight exposure being suggested, following the precautionary LNT model. According to a 2007 study submitted by the University of Ottawa to the Department of Health and Human Services in Washington, D.C., there is not enough information to determine a safe level of sun exposure at this time.&lt;ref name="ODS-sheet-ref-5"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Cranney A, Horsley T, O'Donnell S, etal |title=Effectiveness and safety of vitamin D in relation to bone health |journal=Evidence Report/technology Assessment |volume= |issue=158 |pages=1–235 |date=August 2007 |pmid=18088161 |pmc=4781354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a particular dose of radiation is found to produce one extra case of a type of cancer in every thousand people exposed, LNT projects that one thousandth of this dose will produce one extra case in every million people so exposed, and that one millionth of the original dose will produce one extra case in every billion people exposed. The conclusion is that any given [[dose equivalent]] of radiation will produce the same number of cancers, no matter how thinly it is spread.

The model is simple to apply: a quantity of radiation can be translated into a number of deaths without any adjustment for the distribution of exposure, including the distribution of exposure within a single exposed individual. For example, a [[hot particle]] embedded in an organ (such as lung) results in a very high dose in the cells directly adjacent to the [[hot particle]], but a much lower whole-organ and whole-body dose. Thus, even if a safe low dose threshold was found to exist at cellular level for radiation induced [[mutagenesis]], the threshold would not exist for environmental pollution with hot particles, and could not be safely assumed to exist when the distribution of dose is unknown.

The linear no-threshold model is used to extrapolate the expected number of extra deaths caused by exposure to [[environmental radiation]], and it therefore has a great impact on [[public policy]]. The model is used to translate any [[radiation release]], like that from a "[[dirty bomb]]", into a number of lives lost, while any reduction in [[Ionizing radiation|radiation exposure]], for example as a consequence of [[radon]] detection, is translated into a number of lives saved. When the doses are very low, at natural background levels, in the absence of evidence, the model predicts via extrapolation, new cancers only in a very small fraction of the population, but for a large population, the number of lives is extrapolated into hundreds or thousands, and this can sway public policy.

A linear model has long been used in [[health physics]] to set maximum acceptable radiation exposures.

The United States-based [[National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements]] (NCRP), a body commissioned by the [[United States Congress]], recently released a report written by the national experts in the field which states that, radiation's effects should be considered to be proportional to the dose an individual receives, regardless of how small the dose is.

A 1958 analysis of two decades of research on the mutation rate of 1 million lab mice showed that six major hypotheses about ionizing radiation and gene mutation were not supported by data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/128/3338/1546.long |title=Radiation dose rate and mutation frequency. |author=Russell WL, Russell LB, Kelly EM.|journal= Science|date= December 19, 1958 |volume=128|issue=3338|pages=1546–50 |pmid=13615306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its data was used in 1972 by the [[Committee on the Biological Effects of lonizing Radiation|Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation I]] committee to support the LNT model. However, it has been claimed that the data contained a fundamental error that was not revealed to the committee, and would not support the LNT model on the issue of mutations and may suggest a threshold dose ''rate'' under which radiation does not produce any mutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://phys.org/news/2017-01-calabrese-lnt-toxicology.html |title=Calabrese says mistake led to adopting the LNT model in toxicology |date=January 23, 2017 |work=Phys.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Edward J. Calabrese|title=The threshold vs LNT showdown: Dose rate findings exposed flaws in the LNT model part 2.

==Fieldwork==
The LNT model and the alternatives to it each have plausible mechanisms that could bring them about, but definitive conclusions are hard to make given the difficulty of doing [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal]] studies involving large [[Cohort (statistics)|cohorts]] over long periods.

A 2003 review of the various studies published in the authoritative  ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' concludes that "given our current state of knowledge, the most reasonable assumption is that the cancer risks from low doses of x- or gamma-rays decrease linearly with decreasing dose."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Brenner  | first =David J  | title =Cancer risks attributable to low doses of ionizing radiation: Assessing what we really know  | journal =[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]  | volume =100  | issue =24  | pages =13761–6  | date =10 November 2003  | url =http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/100/24/13761  | doi =10.1073/pnas.2235592100  | id =  | accessdate =29 August 2007  | pmid =14610281  | pmc =283495 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mortazavi S.M.J., Ghiassi-Nejad M., Rezaiean M. | year = 2005 | title = Cancer risk due to exposure to high levels of natural radon in the inhabitants of Ramsar, Iran | url = | journal = International Congress Series | volume = 1276 | issue = | pages = 436–437 | doi = 10.1016/j.ics.2004.12.012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Ramsar, Iran]] (a region with very high levels of natural background radiation) showed that lung cancer incidence was lower in the high-radiation area than in seven surrounding regions with lower levels of natural background radiation. A fuller epidemiological study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mosavi-Jarrahi Alireza, Mohagheghi Mohammadali, Akiba Suminori, Yazdizadeh Bahareh, Motamedi Nilofar, Shabestani Monfared Ali | year = 2005 | title = Mortality and morbidity from cancer in the population exposed to high level of natural radiation area in Ramsar, Iran | url = | journal = International Congress Series | volume = 1276 | issue = | pages = 106–109 | doi = 10.1016/j.ics.2004.11.109 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the same region showed no difference in mortality for males, and a statistically insignificant increase for females.

A 2009 study by researchers that looks at Swedish children exposed to fallout from [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] while they were fetuses between 8 and 25 weeks gestation concluded that the reduction in [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] at very low doses was greater than expected, given a simple LNT model for radiation damage, indicating that the LNT model may be too conservative when it comes to neurological damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Douglas |last=Almond |first2=Lena |last2=Edlund |first3=Mårten |last3=Palme |title=Chernobyl's Subclinical Legacy: Prenatal Exposure to Radioactive Fallout and School Outcomes in Sweden |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=124 |issue=4 |year=2009 |pages=1729–1772 |doi=10.1162/qjec.2009.124.4.1729 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in medical journals, studies detail that in Sweden in the year of the Chernobyl accident, the [[birth rate]], both increased and shifted to those of "higher [[maternal age]]" in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Odlind |first1=V |last2=Ericson |first2=A |title=Incidence of legal abortion in Sweden after the Chernobyl accident |journal=Biomedicine &amp; Pharmacotherapy |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=225–8 |year=1991 |pmid=1912377 |doi=10.1016/0753-3322(91)90021-k}}&lt;/ref&gt; More advanced maternal age in Swedish mothers was linked with a reduction in offspring IQ, in a paper published in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mikko |last=Myrskylä |first2=Karri |last2=Silventoinen |first3=Per |last3=Tynelius |first4=Finn |last4=Rasmussen |title=Is Later Better or Worse?

The doses examined varied between 0 and 500 mSv received over their working lives. These results exclude the possibilities of no increase in risk or that the risk is 2-3 times that for A-bomb survivors with a confidence level of 90%. The cancer risk for these radiation workers was still less than the average for persons in the UK due to the [[healthy worker effect]].

A 2009 study focusing on the naturally high background radiation region of [[Karunagappalli]], India concluded: "our cancer incidence study, together with previously reported cancer mortality studies in the HBR area of [[Yangjiang]], China, suggests it is unlikely that estimates of risk at low doses are substantially greater than currently believed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nair | first1 = R.

In 2011 an ''in vitro'' time-lapse study of the cellular response to low doses of radiation showed a strongly non-linear response of certain cellular repair mechanisms called radiation-induced foci (RIF). The study found that low doses of radiation prompted higher rates of RIF formation than high doses, and that after low-dose exposure RIF continued to form after the radiation had ended.&lt;ref name="pmid22184222"&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Neumaier  | first =Teresa  | title =Evidence for formation of DNA repair centers and dose-response nonlinearity in human cells  | journal =[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]  | volume =109  | issue =2  | date =19 December 2011  | url =http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/12/16/1117849108.full.pdf+html  | doi =10.1073/pnas.1117849108  | accessdate =20 December 2011  | pmid=22184222  | pmc=3258602  | pages=443–448|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 a historical cohort study of &gt;175 000 patients without previous cancer who were examined with CT head scans in UK between 1985 and 2002 was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last =de González  | first = Pearce  | title =Radiation exposure from CT scans in childhood and subsequent risk of leukaemia and brain tumours: a retrospective cohort study  | journal =[[The Lancet]]  | volume =380  | url =  | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60815-0  | pmid=22681860  | pmc=3418594  | issue=9840  | date=August 2012  | pages=499–505|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study, which investigated leukaemia and brain cancer, indicated a linear dose response in the low dose region and had qualitative estimates of risk that were in agreement with the Life Span Study ([[Epidemiology data for low-linear energy transfer radiation]]).

In 2013 a data linkage study of 11 million Australians with &gt;680 000 people exposed to CT scans between 1985 and 2005 was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Darby  | first = Mathews  | title =Cancer risk in 680,000 people exposed to computed tomography scans in childhood or adolescence: data linkage study of 11 million Australians.  | journal =[[BMJ]]  | volume =346  | url =  | doi = 10.1136/bmj.f2360  | pmid=23694687  | pmc=3660619  | year=2013  | pages=f2360|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study confirmed the results of the 2012 UK study for leukaemia and brain cancer but also investigated other cancer types. The authors conclude that their results were generally consistent with the linear no threshold theory.

==Controversy==
The LNT model has been contested by a number of scientists.  It is been claimed that the early proponent of the model [[Hermann Joseph Muller]] intentionally ignored an early study that did not support the LNT model when he gave his 1946 Nobel Prize address advocating the model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Calabrese, E. J.| title = Muller's Nobel lecture on dose–response for ionizing radiation:ideology or science?| date = 30 June 2011| url =http://users.physics.harvard.edu/~wilson/freshman_seminar/Radiation/Calabrese-Muller-1-1.pdf| accessdate =30 December 2011| doi = 10.1007/s00204-011-0728-8| journal = Archives of Toxicology| volume = 85| issue = 4| pages = 1495–1498| pmid=21717110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also argued that LNT model had caused an irrational fear of radiation.  In the wake of the 1986 [[Chernobyl accident]] in [[Ukraine]], Europe-wide anxieties were formented in pregnant mothers over the perception enforced by the LNT model that their children would be born with a higher rate of mutations.&lt;ref name="kasperson160"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kasperson |first1=Roger E. |last2=Stallen |first2=Pieter Jan M. |title=Communicating Risks to the Public: International Perspectives |publisher=Springer Science and Media |year=1991|location=Berlin |pages=160–2 |isbn=978-0-7923-0601-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As far afield as the country of [[Denmark]], hundreds of excess [[induced abortions]] were performed on the healthy unborn, out of this no-threshold fear.&lt;ref name="autogenerated443"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.5271/sjweh.1761 |title=The Chernobyl accident and induced abortions: Only one-way information |journal=Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment &amp; Health |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=443–4 |year=1990 |last1=Perucchi |first1=M |last2=Domenighetti |first2=G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the accident however, studies of data sets approaching a million births in the [[EUROCAT (medicine)|EUROCAT]] database, divided into "exposed" and control groups were assessed in 1999. As no Chernobyl impacts were detected, the researchers conclude "in retrospect the widespread fear in the population about the possible effects of exposure on the unborn was not justified".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/ije/28.5.941 |pmid=10597995 |title=Evaluation of the impact of Chernobyl on the prevalence of congenital anomalies in 16 regions of Europe.

In [[Radiation therapy#Effects on reproduction|very high dose radiation therapy]], it was known at the time that radiation can cause a physiological increase in the rate of pregnancy anomalies, however, human exposure data and animal testing suggests that the "malformation of organs appears to be a [[deterministic effect]] with a [[Dose–response relationship|threshold dose]]" below which, no rate increase is observed.&lt;ref name="ecolo.org"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/(sici)1096-9926(199908)60:2&lt;100::aid-tera14&gt;3.3.co;2-8 |pmid=10440782 |title=Teratogen update: Radiation and chernobyl |journal=Teratology |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=100–6 |year=1999 |last1=Castronovo |first1=Frank P. }}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in 1999 on the link between the Chernobyl accident and [[teratology]] (birth defects) concludes that "there is no substantive proof regarding radiation‐induced teratogenic effects from the Chernobyl accident".&lt;ref name="ecolo.org"/&gt; It is argued that the human body has defense mechanisms, such as [[DNA repair]] and [[programmed cell death]], that would protect it against carcinogenesis due to low-dose exposures of carcinogens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://schachtmanlaw.com/the-mythology-of-linear-no-threshold-cancer-causation/ The Mythology of Linear No-Threshold Cancer Causation]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ramsar, Mazandaran|Ramsar]], located in [[Iran]], is often quoted as being a counter example to LNT. Based on preliminary results, it was considered as having the highest natural background radiation levels on Earth, several times higher than the [[ICRP]]-recommended radiation dose limits for radiation workers, whilst the local population did not seem to suffer any ill effects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/mo/radioadaptive/ramsar.html High Background Radiation Areas of Ramsar, Iran], S.

&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 research of the cellular repair mechanisms support the evidence against the linear no-threshold model.&lt;ref name="pmid22184222" /&gt;  According to its authors, this study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America "casts considerable doubt on the general assumption that risk to ionizing radiation is proportional to dose".

However, a 2011 review of studies addressing childhood leukaemia following exposure to ionizing radiation, including both diagnostic exposure and natural background exposure, concluded that existing risk factors, excess relative risk per Sv (ERR/Sv), is "broadly applicable" to low dose or low dose-rate exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Richard Wakeford| title = The risk of childhood leukaemia following exposure to ionising radiation – a review| date = 30 June 2011| journal = Journal of Radiological Protection (in Press, but Not Yet Public)| volume = 33| issue = 1| pages = 1–25| doi = 10.1088/0952-4746/33/1/1| pmid = 23296257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several expert scientific panels have been convened on the accuracy of the LNT model at low dosage, and various organizations and bodies have stated their positions on this topic:
; Support
* In 2004 the [[United States National Research Council]] (part of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]) supported the linear no threshold model and stated regarding [[Radiation hormesis]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.nap.edu/catalog/11340.html Health Risks from Exposure to Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation: BEIR VII Phase 2]. Books.nap.edu. Retrieved on 5 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hps.org/newsandevents/newsarchive/oldnews497.html Society News Archive: BEIR VII Report Supports LNT Model]. Hps.org. Retrieved on 5 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11340&amp;page=335 quoted text available at]. Nap.edu (1 June 2003). Retrieved on 5 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The assumption that any stimulatory hormetic effects from low doses of ionizing radiation will have a significant health benefit to humans that exceeds potential detrimental effects from the radiation exposure is unwarranted at this time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* In 2005 the United States National Academies' National Research Council published its comprehensive meta-analysis of low-dose radiation research BEIR VII, Phase 2. In its press release the Academies stated:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=11340 NAS. Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation May Cause Harm. Press Release, 29 June 2005. Retrieved on 17 December 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The scientific research base shows that there is no threshold of exposure below which low levels of ionizing radiation can be demonstrated to be harmless or beneficial.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* The [[National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements]] (a body commissioned by the [[United States Congress]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncrppublications.org/index.cfm?fm=Product.AddToCart&amp;pid=6714063164 NCRP report]. Ncrppublications.org. Retrieved on 5 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; endorsed the LNT model in a 2001 report that attempted to survey existing literature critical of the model.
* The [[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation]] (UNSCEAR) wrote in its 2000 report&lt;ref&gt;UNSCEAR 2000 REPORT Vol. II: Sources and Effects of Ionizing Radiation: Annex G: Biological effects at low radiation doses. page 160, paragraph 541. Available online at [http://www.unscear.org/docs/reports/annexg.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Until the [...] uncertainties on low-dose response are resolved, the Committee believes that an increase in the risk of tumour induction proportionate to the radiation dose is consistent with developing knowledge and that it remains, accordingly, the most scientifically defensible approximation of low-dose response. However, a strictly linear dose response should not be expected in all circumstances.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] also endorses the LNT model in its 2011 report on radiogenic cancer risk:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency |url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-05/documents/bbfinalversion.pdf |title=EPA Radiogenic Cancer Risk Models and Projections for the U.S. Population |publisher=EPA |date=April 2011 |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Underlying the risk models is a large body of epidemiological and radiobiological data. In general, results from both lines of research are consistent with a linear, no-threshold dose (LNT) response model in which the risk of inducing a cancer in an irradiated tissue by low doses of radiation is proportional to the dose to that tissue.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;Oppose
A number of organisations disagree with using the Linear no-threshold model to estimate risk from environmental and occupational low-level radiation exposure:

* The [[French Academy of Sciences]] (''Académie des Sciences'') and the National Academy of Medicine (''[[Académie Nationale de Médecine]]'') published a report in 2005 (at the same time as BEIR VII report in the United States) that rejected the Linear no-threshold model in favor of a threshold dose response and a significantly reduced risk at low radiation exposure:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Heyes| title = Authors' reply| date = 1 October 2006| url = http://bjr.birjournals.org/cgi/content/citation/79/946/855| accessdate =27 March 2008| doi = 10.1259/bjr/52126615| journal = British Journal of Radiology| volume = 79| issue = 946| pages = 855–857|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Aurengo| title = Dose-effect relationships and estimation of the carcinogenic effects of low doses of ionizing radiation.| publisher = Académie des Sciences &amp; Académie nationale de Médecine| date = 30 March 2005| url = http://www.radscihealth.org/rsh/Papers/FrenchAcadsFinal07_04_05.pdf| accessdate = 27 March 2008| display-authors = etal| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110725061127/http://www.radscihealth.org/rsh/Papers/FrenchAcadsFinal07_04_05.pdf| archivedate = 25 July 2011| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In conclusion, this report raises doubts on the validity of using LNT for evaluating the carcinogenic risk of low doses (&lt; 100 mSv) and even more for very low doses (&lt; 10 mSv). The LNT concept can be a useful pragmatic tool for assessing rules in radioprotection for doses above 10 mSv;  however since it is not based on biological concepts of our current knowledge, it should not be used without precaution for assessing by extrapolation the risks associated with low and even more so, with very low doses (&lt; 10 mSv), especially for benefit-risk assessments imposed on radiologists by the European directive 97-43.}}

* The [[Health Physics Society]]'s position statement first adopted in January 1996, as revised in July 2010, states:&lt;ref&gt;Health Physics Society, 2010. Radiation Risk in Perspective  '''PS010-2''' [http://hps.org/documents/risk_ps010-2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In accordance with current knowledge of radiation health risks, the Health Physics Society recommends against quantitative estimation of health risks below an individual dose of 5 rem (50 mSv)  in one year or a lifetime dose of 10 rem (100 mSv) above that received from natural sources. Doses from natural background radiation in the United States average about 0.3 rem (3 mSv) per year. A dose of 5 rem (50 mSv) will be accumulated in the first 17 years of life and about 25 rem (250 mSv) in a lifetime of 80 years. Estimation of health risk associated with radiation doses that are of similar magnitude as those received from natural sources should be strictly qualitative and encompass a range of hypothetical health outcomes, including the possibility of no adverse health effects at such low levels.}}

* The [[American Nuclear Society]] recommended further research on the Linear No Threshold Hypothesis before making adjustments to current radiation protection guidelines, concurring with the Health Physics Society's position that:&lt;ref&gt;The American Nuclear Society, 2001. Health Effects of Low-Level Radiation. Position Statement '''41''' [http://www.ans.org/pi/ps/docs/ps41.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;   {{quote|There is substantial and convincing scientific evidence for health risks at high dose. Below 10 rem or 100 mSv (which includes occupational and environmental exposures) risks of health effects are either too small to be observed or are non-existent.}}

;Intermediate
The US [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] takes the intermediate position that "accepts the LNT hypothesis as a conservative model for estimating radiation risk", but noting that "public health data do not absolutely establish the occurrence of cancer following exposure to low doses and dose rates — below about 10,000 mrem (100 mSv). Studies of occupational workers who are chronically exposed to low levels of radiation above normal background have shown no adverse biological effects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/radiation/health-effects/rad-exposure-cancer.html |title=Radiation Exposure and Cancer |date=29 March 2012 |website=[[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] |accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental health effects==
{{Further|Radiophobia}}
The consequences of low-level radiation are often more [[psychological]] than radiological. Because damage from very-low-level radiation cannot be detected, people exposed to it are left in anguished uncertainty about what will happen to them. Many believe they have been fundamentally contaminated for life and may refuse to have children for fear of [[birth defect]]s. They may be shunned by others in their community who fear a sort of mysterious contagion.&lt;ref name=riv12&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/10/nuclear-risk-and-fear-from-hiroshima-to-fukushima/ |title=Nuclear Risk and Fear, from Hiroshima to Fukushima |author=[[Andrew C. Revkin]] |date=10 March 2012 |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forced evacuation from a radiation or nuclear accident may lead to social isolation, anxiety, depression, psychosomatic medical problems, reckless behavior, even suicide. Such was the outcome of the 1986 [[Chernobyl nuclear disaster]] in the Ukraine. A comprehensive 2005 study concluded that "the mental health impact of Chernobyl is the largest public health problem unleashed by the accident to date".&lt;ref name=riv12/&gt; [[Frank N. von Hippel]], a U.S. scientist, commented on the 2011 [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]], saying that "fear of ionizing radiation could have long-term psychological effects on a large portion of the population in the contaminated areas".&lt;ref name="Frank N. von Hippel 27–36"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/67/5/27.full |title=The radiological and psychological consequences of the Fukushima Daiichi accident |author= Frank N. von Hippel |date= September–October 2011|volume=67|issue=5 |work= Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |pages= 27–36 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such great psychological danger does not accompany other materials that put people at risk of cancer and other deadly illness. Visceral fear is not widely aroused by, for example, the daily emissions from coal burning, although, as a National Academy of Sciences study found, this causes 10,000 premature deaths a year in the US. It is "only nuclear radiation that bears a huge psychological burden — for it carries a unique historical legacy".&lt;ref name=riv12/&gt;

==History==

In January 2000 Ama Ata Aidoo started an initiative called '''Mbaasem''' (meaning "women’s words, women’s affairs" in [[Akan language|Akan]])&lt;ref name=CWG /&gt; based in Accra, Ghana, with the goal of building a women writers' centre and residency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wworld.org/archive/annual_report2000.htm Annual Report 1999-2000], Women's WORLD.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently incorporated as a registered non-governmental organization, the Mbaasem Foundation reflects the mission of its founder "to develop and support the sustainability of the work of African women writers who are usually sidelined in the industry".&lt;ref&gt;Kundai Mugwanda-Nyamutenha,

In 2012 Mbaasem launched a three-year project to develop a literacy manifesto to improve the literacy rate within Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;Marian Ansah, [http://efeansah1990.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/mbaasem-foundation-launches-manifesto.html "Mbaasem Foundation Launches manifesto To Bridge Literacy Gap"], 8 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Other activities include organizing the "Mbaasem Writing Contest for Girls", funded by the US Embassy of Ghana and [[The Royal Bank]] Ltd, with GHC 1000 as the top prize.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gowomanafrica.com/mbaasem-writing-contest-for-girls-deadline-january-31st-2015/ "Mbaasem Writing Contest for Girls"], ''GoWoman'',

The Mbaasem Foundation has also been involved in international conferences for women writers. In 2013, it collaborated with the [[Organization of Women Writers of Africa]] (OWWA), [[New York University]] (NYU), and the [[Spanish Fundación Mujeres por África]] (Women for Africa Foundation) to present a major conference in Accra, ''Yari Yari Ntoaso: Continuing the Dialogue – An International Conference on Literature by Women of African Ancestry'', held from 16 to 19 May.&lt;ref name=CWG&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creativewritingghana.wordpress.com/tag/mbaasem/|title=Yari Yari Ntoaso: An International Conference in Ghana on Literature by Women of African Ancestry|publisher=Creative Writing Ghana|date=20 April 2013|accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghanaian writers and scholars including Ama Ata Aidoo, [[Amma Darko]], [[Ruby Goka]], [[Mamle Kabu]], [[Esi Sutherland-Addy]] and [[Margaret Busby]] were invited to speak at the event, and among notable participants from other parts of the world who attended were [[Angela Davis]] of the USA, [[Tess Onwueme]] of Nigeria, [[Natalia Molebatsi]] of South Africa, [[Yolanda Arroyo Pizarro]] of Puerto Rico, [[Véronique Tadjo]] of Côte d'Ivoire, and [[Évelyne Trouillot]] of Haiti.&lt;ref name=CWG /&gt;

In [[visual arts]], [[Minimal music|music]], and other mediums, '''minimalism''' is an [[art movement]] that began in post–[[World War II]] Western art, most strongly with American visual arts in the 1960s and early 1970s. Prominent artists associated with minimalism include [[Donald Judd]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Anne Truitt]], and [[Frank Stella]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10459 |title=Christopher Want, ''Minimalism'', Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009 |publisher=Moma.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Minimalism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theartstory.org/movement-minimalism.htm|title=Minimalism|publisher=theartstory.org|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It derives from the reductive aspects of [[modernism]] and is often interpreted as a reaction against [[abstract expressionism]] and a bridge to [[Postminimalism|postminimal]] art practices.

[[Minimalist music|Minimalism in music]] often features repetition and iteration such as those of the compositions of [[La Monte Young]], [[Terry Riley]], [[Steve Reich]], [[Philip Glass]], [[Julius Eastman]], and [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]]. The term ''minimalist'' often colloquially refers to anything that is spare or stripped to its essentials. It has accordingly been used to describe the [[Play (theatre)|plays]] and [[novel]]s of [[Samuel Beckett]], the films of [[Robert Bresson]], the stories of [[Raymond Carver]], and the automobile designs of [[Colin Chapman]]. &lt;!--The word was first used in English in the early 20th century to describe a 1915 composition by the Russian painter [[Kasimir Malevich]], ''[[Black Square (painting)|Black Square]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/384056/minimalism |title=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2013.

Minimalism in visual art, generally referred to as "minimal art", "literalist art"&lt;ref&gt;Fried, M. "Art and Objecthood", ''Artforum'', 1967&lt;/ref&gt; and "ABC Art"&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Barbara. "ABC Art", ''Art in America'' 53, no. 5 (October–November 1965): 57–69.&lt;/ref&gt; emerged in New York in the early 1960s as new and older artists moved toward [[geometric abstraction]]; exploring via painting in the cases of [[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Al Held]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Robert Ryman]] and others; and sculpture in the works of various artists including [[David Smith (artist)|David Smith]], [[Anthony Caro]], [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Donald Judd]] and others. Judd's sculpture was showcased in 1964 at [[Green Gallery]] in Manhattan, as were Flavin's first fluorescent light works, while other leading Manhattan galleries like [[Leo Castelli|Leo Castelli Gallery]] and [[Pace Gallery]] also began to showcase artists focused on geometric abstraction. In addition there were two seminal and influential museum exhibitions: ''[[Primary Structures]]: Younger American and British Sculpture'' shown from April 27 – June 12, 1966 at the [[Jewish Museum (New York)|Jewish Museum]] in [[New York City|New York]], organized by the museum's Curator of Painting and Sculpture, Kynaston McShine&lt;ref&gt;''Time'' magazine, June 3, 1966, "Engineer's Esthetic", pg. 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Newsweek'' magazine, May 16, 1966, "The New Druids", pg. 104&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Systemic Painting,'' at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] curated by [[Lawrence Alloway]] also in 1966 that showcased [[Geometric abstraction]] in the American art world via [[Shaped canvas]], [[Color Field]], and [[Hard-edge painting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/exhibitions/publications/from-the-archives/items/view/72 |title=''Systemic Painting'', Guggenheim Museum |publisher=Guggenheim.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/oxford-art-encyclopedia/systemic-art |title=Systemic art, Oxford-Art encyclopedia |publisher=Enotes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of those exhibitions and a few others the art movement called ''minimal art'' emerged.

In a more broad and general sense, one finds European roots of minimalism in the [[geometric abstraction]]s of painters associated with the [[Bauhaus]], in the works of Kazimir Malevich, [[Piet Mondrian]] and other artists associated with the [[De Stijl]] movement, and the [[Constructivism (art)|Russian Constructivist]] movement, and in the work of the Romanian sculptor [[Constantin Brâncuși]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artcritical.com/2004/10/01/albert-york-and-giorgio-morandi/ |title=Maureen Mullarkey, Art Critical, ''Giorgio Morandi'' |publisher=Artcritical.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hr-5GcN0F6kC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=Constantin+Br%C3%A2ncu%C5%9Fi.+and+minimal+art&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8fdrAkynIx&amp;sig=_wMpgr2P-ywVUMWpAziTWIuQnjI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mRHeTr_IF6jg0QHZ55XHBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Daniel Marzona, Uta Grosenick; ''Minimal art'', p.12 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein had painted [[Monochrome painting|monochromes]] as early as 1949, and held the first private exhibition of this work in 1950—but his first public showing was the publication of the [[Artist's book]] ''[[Yves: Peintures]]'' in November 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Weitemeier, ''Yves Klein, 1928–1962: International Klein Blue'', Original-Ausgabe (Cologne: Taschen, 1994), 15. {{ISBN|3-8228-8950-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern Paint Uncovered|chapter=Restoring the Immaterial: Study and Treatment of Yves Klein's ''Blue Monochrome (IKB42)''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minimal art is also inspired in part by the paintings of [[Barnett Newman]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Josef Albers]], and the works of artists as diverse as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Giorgio Morandi]], and others. Minimalism was also a reaction against the painterly subjectivity of [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionism]] that had been dominant in the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] during the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lhMS8Ii73ZkC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=abstract+expressionism+and+minimal+art&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NddevTB5zD&amp;sig=nyIwlEqV3XyQaTkeVPgZNqfOGUY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rBfeTtKeI8Pd0QG20am2Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=abstract%20expressionism%20and%20minimal%20art&amp;f=false |title=Gregory Battcock, ''Minimal Art: a critical anthology'', pp 161–172 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist and critic [[Thomas Lawson (artist)|Thomas Lawson]] noted in his 1981 [[Artforum]] essay ''Last Exit: Painting,'' minimalism did not reject [[Clement Greenberg]]'s claims about modernist painting's&lt;ref name="sharecom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/modernism.html |title=Clement Greenberg, ''Modernist Painting,'' 1960 |publisher=Sharecom.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; reduction to surface and materials so much as take his claims literally. According to Lawson, minimalism was the result, even though the term "minimalism" was not generally embraced by the artists associated with it, and many practitioners of art designated minimalist by critics did not identify it as a movement as such. Also taking exception to this claim was Clement Greenberg himself; in his 1978 postscript to his essay ''Modernist Painting'' he disavowed this interpretation of what he said, writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There have been some further constructions of what I wrote that go over into preposterousness: That I regard flatness and the inclosing of flatness not just as the limiting conditions of pictorial art, but as criteria of aesthetic quality in pictorial art; that the further a work advances the self-definition of an art, the better that work is bound to be. The philosopher or art historian who can envision me—or anyone at all—arriving at aesthetic judgments in this way reads shockingly more into himself or herself than into my article.&lt;ref name="sharecom"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In contrast to the previous decade's more subjective [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionists]], with the exceptions of [[Barnett Newman]] and [[Ad Reinhardt]]; minimalists were also influenced by composers [[John Cage]] and [[La Monte Young|LaMonte Young]], poet [[William Carlos Williams]], and the landscape architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]. They very explicitly stated that their art was not about self-expression, and unlike the previous decade's more subjective philosophy about art making theirs was 'objective'. In general, minimalism's features included [[Geometry|geometric]], often [[Cube|cubic]] forms purged of much [[metaphor]], equality of parts, [[wikt:repetition|repetition]], neutral surfaces, and industrial materials.

[[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], a theorist and artist, wrote a three part essay, "Notes on Sculpture 1–3", originally published across three issues of ''Artforum'' in 1966. In these essays, Morris attempted to define a conceptual framework and formal elements for himself and one that would embrace the practices of his contemporaries. These essays paid great attention to the idea of the [[wikt:Gestalt|gestalt]] – "parts... bound together in such a way that they create a maximum resistance to perceptual separation." Morris later described an art represented by a "marked lateral spread and no regularized units or symmetrical intervals..." in "Notes on Sculpture 4: Beyond Objects", originally published in ''Artforum'', 1969, continuing on to say that "indeterminacy of arrangement of parts is a literal aspect of the physical existence of the thing." The general shift in theory of which this essay is an expression suggests the transition into what would later be referred to as ''[[postminimalism]]''.

One of the first artists specifically associated with minimalism was the painter [[Frank Stella]], four of whose early "black paintings" were included in the 1959 show, ''[[Dorothy Miller#1959: Sixteen Americans|16 Americans]],'' organized by [[Dorothy Miller]] at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York. The width of the stripes in Frank Stellas's black paintings were often determined by the dimensions of the lumber he used for stretchers to support the canvas, visible against the canvas as the depth of the painting when viewed from the side. Stella's decisions about structures on the front surface of the canvas were therefore not entirely subjective, but pre-conditioned by a "given" feature of the physical construction of the support. In the show catalog, [[Carl Andre]] noted, "Art excludes the unnecessary. Frank Stella has found it necessary to paint [[wikt:stripe|stripes]]. There is nothing else in his painting." These reductive works were in sharp contrast to the energy-filled and apparently highly subjective and emotionally charged paintings of [[Willem de Kooning]] or [[Franz Kline]] and, in terms of precedent among the previous generation of abstract expressionists, leaned more toward the less gestural, often somber, [[color field]] paintings of [[Barnett Newman]] and [[Mark Rothko]]. Stella received immediate attention from the MoMA show, but other artists—including [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Robert Motherwell]], and [[Robert Ryman]]—had also begun to explore stripes, [[Monochrome|monochromatic]] and [[Hard-edge painting|Hard-edge]] formats from the late 50s through the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/384056/minimalism |title=Britannica.com |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of a tendency in minimal art to exclude the pictorial, illusionistic and fictive in favor of the literal, there was a movement away from painterly and toward sculptural concerns. [[Donald Judd]] had started as a painter, and ended as a creator of objects. His seminal essay, "Specific Objects" (published in Arts Yearbook 8, 1965), was a touchstone of theory for the formation of minimalist aesthetics. In this essay, Judd found a starting point for a new territory for American art, and a simultaneous rejection of residual inherited European artistic values. He pointed to evidence of this development in the works of an array of artists active in New York at the time, including [[Jasper Johns]], Dan Flavin and [[Lee Bontecou]]. Of "preliminary" importance for Judd was the work of [[George Earl Ortman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oisteanu |first=Valery |url=http://brooklynrail.org/2006/12/artseen/ortman |title=Brooklynrail.org |publisher=Brooklynrail.org |date=2006-12-08 |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had concretized and distilled painting's forms into blunt, tough, philosophically charged geometries. These Specific Objects inhabited a space not then comfortably classifiable as either painting or sculpture. That the categorical identity of such objects was itself in question, and that they avoided easy association with well-worn and over-familiar conventions, was a part of their value for Judd.

This movement was heavily criticized by modernist formalist art critics and historians. Some critics thought minimal art represented a misunderstanding of the modern dialectic of painting and sculpture as defined by critic [[Clement Greenberg]], arguably the dominant American critic of painting in the period leading up to the 1960s. The most notable critique of minimalism was produced by [[Michael Fried]], a formalist critic, who objected to the work on the basis of its "theatricality". In ''Art and Objecthood'' (published in Artforum in June 1967) he declared that the minimal work of art, particularly minimal sculpture, was based on an engagement with the physicality of the spectator. He argued that work like Robert Morris's transformed the act of viewing into a type of [[spectacle]], in which the artifice of the act [[observation]] and the viewer's [[participant Media|participation]] in the work were unveiled. Fried saw this displacement of the viewer's experience from an aesthetic engagement within, to an event outside of the artwork as a failure of minimal art. Fried's essay was immediately challenged by [[postminimalist]] and [[Land art|earth artist]] [[Robert Smithson]] in a letter to the editor in the October issue of Artforum. Smithson stated the following: "What Fried fears most is the [[consciousness]] of what he is doing—namely being himself theatrical."

In addition to the already mentioned [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Robert Ryman]] and [[Donald Judd]] other minimal artists include: [[Robert Mangold]], [[Larry Bell (artist)|Larry Bell]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Charles Hinman]], [[Ronald Bladen]], [[Paul Mogensen]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[David Novros]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Blinky Palermo]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Jo Baer]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Fred Sandback]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Patricia Johanson]], and [[Anne Truitt]].

[[Ad Reinhardt]], actually an artist of the [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionist]] generation, but one whose [[reductionism|reductive]] nearly all-black paintings seemed to anticipate minimalism, had this to say about the value of a reductive approach to art:

''The more stuff in it, the busier the work of art, the worse it is. More is less. Less is more. The eye is a menace to clear sight. The laying bare of oneself is obscene. Art begins with the getting rid of nature.''&lt;ref&gt;in Barbara Rose, ed. ''Art as Art: The Selected Writings of Ad Reinhardt'' (New York: Viking Press, 1975):{{Page needed|date=November 2011}} {{ISBN|978-0-520-07670-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reinhardt's remark directly addresses and contradicts [[Hans Hofmann]]'s regard for nature as the source of his own abstract expressionist paintings. In a famous exchange between Hofmann and [[Jackson Pollock]] as told by [[Lee Krasner]] in an interview with Dorothy Strickler&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Archives of American Art |url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/oralhistories/transcripts/krasne64.htm |title=Oral history interview with Lee Krasner, 1964 Nov. 2-1968 Apr. 11 – Oral Histories &amp;#124; Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution |publisher=Aaa.si.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1964-11-02) for the Smithsonian Institution [[Archives of American Art]].&lt;ref name="aaa"&gt;{{cite web|author=Archives of American Art |url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/oralhistories/transcripts/krasne64.htm |title=Lee Krasner, Archives of American Art |publisher=Aaa.si.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Krasner's words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When I brought Hofmann up to meet Pollock and see his work which was before we moved here, Hofmann’s reaction was—one of the questions he asked Jackson was, "Do you work from nature?" There were no still lifes around or models around and Jackson’s answer was, "I am nature." And Hofmann’s reply was, "Ah, but if you work by heart, you will repeat yourself." To which Jackson did not reply at all. The meeting between Pollock and Hofmann took place in 1942.&lt;ref name="aaa"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term minimalism is also used to describe a trend in [[design]] and [[architecture]], wherein the subject is reduced to its necessary elements.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Minimalist architectural designers focus on the connection between two perfect planes, elegant lighting, and the void spaces left by the removal of three-dimensional shapes in an architectural design.{{according to whom|date=August 2016}}{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} 

Minimalistic design has been highly influenced by [[Japanese architecture|Japanese traditional design and architecture]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The works of [[De Stijl]] artists are a major reference: De Stijl expanded the ideas of expression by meticulously organizing basic elements such as lines and planes.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} With regard to home design, more attractive "minimalistic" designs are not truly minimalistic because they are larger, and use more expensive building materials and finishes.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

There are observers who describe the emergence of minimalism as a response to the brashness and chaos of urban life. In Japan, for example, minimalist architecture began to gain traction in the 1980s when its cities experienced rapid expansion and booming population. The design was considered an antidote to the "overpowering presence of traffic, advertising, jumbled building scales, and imposing roadways."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Fractal Dimension of Architecture|last=Ostwald|first=Michael|last2=Vaughan|first2=Josephine|publisher=Birkhauser|year=2016|isbn=9783319324241|location=Newcastle|pages=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chaotic environment was not only driven by urbanization, industrialization, and technology but also the Japanese experience of constantly having to demolish structures on account of the destruction wrought by World War II and the earthquakes, including the calamities it entails such as fire. The minimalist design philosophy did not arrive in Japan by way of another country as it was already part of the Japanese culture rooted on the Zen philosophy. There are those who specifically attribute the design movement to Japan's spirituality and view of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Architecture of Minimalism|last=Cerver|first=Francisco|publisher=Arco|year=1997|isbn=9780823061495|location=|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Architect [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] (1886–1969) adopted the motto "Less is more" to describe his aesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Philip Johnson]], op. cit.  A similar sentiment was conveyed by industrial designer Dieter Rams' motto, "Less but better."{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His tactic was one of arranging the necessary components of a building to create an impression of extreme simplicity—he enlisted every element and detail to serve multiple visual and functional purposes; for example, designing a floor to also serve as the radiator, or a massive fireplace to also house the bathroom. Designer [[Buckminster Fuller]] (1895–1983) adopted the engineer's goal of "Doing more with less", but his concerns were oriented toward technology and engineering rather than aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Johnson]], ''Mies van der Rohe'', [[Museum of Modern Art]], 1947, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Luis Barragán]] is an exemplary modern minimalist designer.{{According to whom|date=August 2016}}{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Other contemporary minimalist architects include [[Kazuyo Sejima]], [[John Pawson]], [[Eduardo Souto de Moura]], [[Álvaro Siza Vieira]], [[Tadao Ando]], [[Alberto Campo Baeza]], [[Yoshio Taniguchi]], [[Peter Zumthor]], [[Hugh Newell Jacobsen]], Vincent Van Duysen, [[Claudio Silvestrin]], [[Michael Gabellini]], and [[Gluckman Mayner Architects|Richard Gluckman]].&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Ivar (2006).

==Minimalist architecture and space==
Minimalist architecture became popular in the late 1980s in London and New York,&lt;ref&gt;Cerver 1997, pp.&amp;nbsp;8–11.&lt;/ref&gt; where architects and fashion designers worked together in the boutiques to achieve simplicity, using white elements, cold lighting, large space with minimum objects and furniture.

===Concepts and design elements===
The concept of minimalist architecture is to strip everything down to its essential quality and achieve simplicity.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoni 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;10.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is not completely without ornamentation,&lt;ref name="Rossell"&gt;Rossell (2005), Minimalist Interiors, New York: HapperCollins. p6.&lt;/ref&gt; but that all parts, details, and joinery are considered as reduced to a stage where no one can remove anything further to improve the design.&lt;ref name="Pawson"&gt;Pawson (1996), Minimum, London: Phaidon Press Limited. p7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The considerations for ‘essences’ are light, form, detail of material, space, place, and human condition.&lt;ref name="Bertoni15-16"&gt;Bertoni 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Minimalist architects not only consider the physical qualities of the building. They consider the spiritual dimension and the invisible, by listening to the figure and paying attention to  details, people, space, nature, and materials.,&lt;ref name="Bertoni21"&gt;Bertoni 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;21.&lt;/ref&gt; believing this reveals the abstract quality of something that is invisible and aids the search for the essence of those invisible qualities—such as natural light, sky, earth, and air. In addition, they "open a dialogue" with the surrounding environment to decide the most essential materials for the construction and create relationships between buildings and sites.&lt;ref name="Rossell"/&gt;

In minimalist architecture, design elements strive to convey the message of simplicity. The basic geometric forms, elements without decoration, simple materials and the repetitions of structures represent a sense of order and essential quality.&lt;ref&gt;Pawson (1996), Minimum, London: Phaidon Press Limited. p8.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement of natural light in buildings reveals simple and clean spaces.&lt;ref name="Bertoni15-16"/&gt; In the late 19th century as the arts and crafts movement became popular in Britain, people valued the attitude of ‘truth to materials’ with respect to the profound and innate characteristics of materials.&lt;ref&gt;Saito, (Winter 2007), The Moral Dimension of Japanese Aesthetics, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, vol.65, no. 1. P.87–88.&lt;/ref&gt;  Minimalist architects humbly 'listen to figure,' seeking essence and simplicity by rediscovering the valuable qualities in simple and common materials.&lt;ref name="Bertoni21"/&gt;

===Influences from Japanese tradition===
{{see also|Japanese architecture}}

[[Image:RyoanJi-Dry garden.jpg|thumb|right|Ryōan-ji dry garden.The clay wall, which is stained by age with subtle brown and orange tones, reflects "wabi" and the rock garden "sabi", together reflecting the Japanese worldview or aesthetic of "[[wabi-sabi]]".&lt;ref&gt;森神逍遥 『侘び然び幽玄のこころ』桜の花出版、2015年 Morigami Shouyo, "Wabi sabi yugen no kokoro: seiyo tetsugaku o koeru joi ishiki" (Japanese) {{ISBN|978-4434201424}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]&lt;!-- The size of this image is specified because its default size is a bit too small considering the importance of the garden -- and the details can be more fully appreciated in an enlarged scale. --&gt;

The idea of simplicity appears in many cultures, especially the Japanese traditional culture of Zen Philosophy. Japanese manipulate the Zen culture into aesthetic and design elements for their buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Saito, (Winter 2007), The Moral Dimension of Japanese Aesthetics, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, vol.65, no. 1. p.85–97.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea of architecture has influenced Western Society, especially in America since the mid 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lancaster (September 1953), Japanese Buildings in the United States before 1900: Their Influence upon American Domestic Architecture, The Art Bulletin, vol. 35, no. 3. p217–224.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it inspired the minimalist architecture in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Pawson"/&gt;

Zen concepts of simplicity transmit the ideas of freedom and essence of living.&lt;ref name="Pawson"/&gt; Simplicity is not only aesthetic value, it has a moral perception that looks into the nature of truth and reveals the inner qualities and essence of materials and objects.&lt;ref&gt;Saito, (Winter 2007), The Moral Dimension of Japanese Aesthetics, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, vol.65, no. 1. p87.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[sand garden]] in [[Ryoanji]] temple demonstrates the concepts of simplicity and the essentiality from the considered setting of a few stones and a huge empty space.&lt;ref&gt;Pawson (1996), Minimum, London: Phaidon Press Limited. p98.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese aesthetic principle of [[Ma (negative space)|Ma]] refers to empty or open space. It removes all the unnecessary internal walls and opens up the space. The emptiness of spatial arrangement reduces everything down to the most essential quality.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoni 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese aesthetic of [[Wabi-sabi]] values the quality of simple and plain objects.&lt;ref&gt;Saito, (Winter 2007), The Moral Dimension of Japanese Aesthetics, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, vol.65, no. 1. p85.&lt;/ref&gt; It appreciates the absence of unnecessary features, treasures a life in quietness and aims to reveal the innate character of materials.&lt;ref&gt;Pawson (1996), Minimum, London: Phaidon Press Limited. p10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Japanese floral art, also known as [[Ikebana]], has the central principle of letting the flower express itself. People cut off the branches, leaves and blossoms from the plants and only retain the essential part of the plant. This conveys the idea of essential quality and innate character in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Saito, (Winter 2007), The Moral Dimension of Japanese Aesthetics, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, vol.65, no. 1.p86.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, far from being just a spatial concept, Ma is ever-present in all aspects of Japanese daily life, as it applies to time as well as to daily tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wawaza.com/pages/when-less-is-more-the-concept-of-japanese-ma.html |title=When Less is More: the Concept of Japanese "MA" |publisher=Wawaza.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minimalist architects and their works===
The Japanese minimalist architect, [[Tadao Ando]] conveys the Japanese traditional spirit and his own perception of nature in his works. His design concepts are materials, pure geometry and nature. He normally uses concrete or natural wood and basic structural form to achieve austerity and rays of light in space. He also sets up dialogue between the site and nature to create relationship and order with the buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoni 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;96–106.&lt;/ref&gt; Ando’s works and the translation of Japanese aesthetic principles are highly influential on Japanese architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Cerver 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Japanese minimalist architect, [[Kazuyo Sejima]], works on her own and in conjunction with [[Ryue Nishizawa]], as [[SANAA]], producing iconic Japanese Minimalist buildings. Credited with creating and influencing a particular genre of Japanese Minimalism,&lt;ref&gt;Puglisi, L.P. (2008), New Directions in Contermporary Architecture, Chichester, John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; Sejimas delicate, intelligent designs may use white color, thin construction sections and transparent elements to create the phenomenal building type often associated with minimalism. Works include [[New Museum]](2010) New York City, Small House (2000) Tokyo, House surrounded By Plum Trees (2003) Tokyo.

In Vitra Conference Pavilion, Weil am Rhein, 1993, the concepts are to bring together the relationships between building, human movement, site and nature. Which as one main point of minimalism ideology that establish dialogue between the building and site. The building uses the simple forms of circle and rectangle to contrast the filled and void space of the interior and nature. In the foyer, there is a large landscape window that looks out to the exterior. This achieves the simple and silence of architecture and enhances the light, wind, time and nature in space.&lt;ref&gt;Cerver 1997, pp.&amp;nbsp;18–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Pawson]] is a British minimalist architect; his design concepts are soul, light, and order. He believes that though reduced clutter and simplification of the interior to a point that gets beyond the idea of essential quality, there is a sense of clarity and richness of simplicity instead of emptiness. The materials in his design reveal the perception toward space, surface, and volume. Moreover, he likes to use natural materials because of their aliveness, sense of depth and quality of an individual. He is also attracted by the important influences from Japanese Zen Philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Pawson (1996), Minimum, London: Phaidon Press Limited. p10-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Calvin Klein Madison Avenue, New York, 1995–96, is a boutique that conveys Calvin Klein’s ideas of fashion. John Pawson’s interior design concepts for this project are to create simple, peaceful and orderly spatial arrangements. He used stone floors and white walls to achieve simplicity and harmony for space. He also emphasises reduction and eliminates the visual distortions, such as the air conditioning and lamps to achieve a sense of purity for interior.&lt;ref&gt;Cerver 1997, pp.&amp;nbsp;170–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alberto Campo Baeza]] is a Spanish architect and describes his work as essential architecture. He values the concepts of light, idea and space. Light is essential and achieves the relationship between inhabitants and the building. Ideas are to meet the function and context of space, forms, and construction. Space is shaped by the minimal geometric forms to avoid decoration that is not essential.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoni 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gasper House, Zahora, 1992 is a residence that the client wanted to be independent. High walls create the enclosed space and the stone floors used in house and courtyard show the continuality of interior and exterior. The white colour of the walls reveals the simplicity and unity of the building. The feature of the structure make lines to form the continuously horizontal house, therefore natural light projects horizontally through the building.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoni 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;192.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary minimalism==
Literary minimalism is characterized by an economy with words and a focus on surface description. Minimalist writers eschew adverbs and prefer allowing context to dictate meaning. Readers are expected to take an active role in creating the story, to "choose sides" based on oblique hints and innuendo, rather than react to directions from the writer.

Some 1940s-era crime fiction of writers such as [[James M. Cain]] and [[Jim Thompson (writer)|Jim Thompson]] adopted a stripped-down, matter-of-fact prose style to considerable effect; some classify this prose style as minimalism.{{Weasel inline|date=November 2011}}

Another strand of literary minimalism arose in response to the [[metafiction]] trend of the 1960s and early 1970s ([[John Barth]], [[Robert Coover]], and [[William H. Gass]]). These writers were also spare with prose and kept a psychological distance from their subject matter.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Minimalist writers, or those who are identified with minimalism during certain periods of their writing careers, include the following: [[Raymond Carver]], [[Ann Beattie]], [[Bret Easton Ellis]], [[Charles Bukowski]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[K. J. Stevens]], [[Amy Hempel]], [[Bobbie Ann Mason]], [[Tobias Wolff]], [[Grace Paley]], [[Sandra Cisneros]], [[Mary Robison]], [[Frederick Barthelme]], [[Richard Ford]], [[Patrick Holland (author)|Patrick Holland]], [[Cormac McCarthy]], and [[Alicia Erian]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

American poets such as [[Stephen Crane]], [[William Carlos Williams]], early [[Ezra Pound]], [[Robert Creeley]], [[Robert Grenier (poet)|Robert Grenier]], and [[Aram Saroyan]] are sometimes identified with their ''minimalist'' style. The term "minimalism" is also sometimes associated with the briefest of poetic genres, [[haiku]], which originated in Japan, but has been domesticated in English literature by poets such as [[Nick Virgilio]], [[Raymond Roseliep]], and [[George Swede]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The Irish writer [[Samuel Beckett]] is well known for his minimalist plays and prose, as is the Norwegian writer [[Jon Fosse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davies|first1=Paul|title=Samuel Beckett|url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&amp;UID=5161|website=Literary Encyclopedia|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his novel ''The Easy Chain'', [[Evan Dara]] includes a 60-page section written in the style of musical minimalism, in particular inspired by composer [[Steve Reich]]. Intending to represent the psychological state (agitation) of the novel's main character, the section's successive lines of text are built on repetitive and developing phrases.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Minimal music==
{{main article|Minimal music}}

The term "minimal music" was derived around 1970 by [[Michael Nyman]] from the concept of minimalism, which was earlier applied to the [[visual arts]].&lt;ref name=Bernard93&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bernard|first=Jonathan W.|title=The Minimalist Aesthetic in the Plastic Arts and in Music|journal=Perspectives of New Music|date=1993|volume=31|issue= 1 (Winter)|page=87|jstor=833043}}, citing Dan Warburton as his authority.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Warburton88&gt;{{cite web|last=Warburton|first=Dan|title=A Working Terminology for Minimal Music|url=http://www.paristransatlantic.com/magazine/archives/minimalism.html|accessdate=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, it was in a 1968 review in ''The Spectator'' that Nyman first used the term, to describe a ten-minute piano composition by the Danish composer [[Henning Christiansen]], along with several other unnamed pieces played by [[Charlotte Moorman]] and [[Nam June Paik]] at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Nyman 1968, 519.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''North South Atlantic Training Transect''' (NoSoAT) is a program that was developed by the [[Alfred Wegener Institute]] (AWI), the [[Strategic Marine Alliance for Research and Training]] (SMART), and the [[Partnership for Observation of the Global Oceans]] (POGO) in order to further the education and practical training of postgraduate students in climate and [[marine science]]s. Each year, about 30 students are selected through a rigorous application process to join a voyage from [[Bremerhaven]], Germany to [[Cape Town]], South Africa aboard the [[RV Polarstern]]. The month-long course is designed to provide students with relevant lectures and projects, as well as provide them with hands-on training for the use of atmospheric and oceanographic equipment and the opportunity to learn about data processing and analysis.&lt;ref name=MIFnM&gt;{{cite web|title=Apply now to join North South Atlantic Training Transect (NoSoAT 2016) {{!}} Marine Institute|url=http://www.marine.ie/Home/site-area/news-events/news/apply-now-join-north-south-atlantic-training-transect-nosoat-2016|website=Marine Institute Foras na Mara|accessdate=2 November 2016|date=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Call Closed: North South Atlantic Training Transect 2016 {{!}} SMART|url=http://www.smartseaschool.com/nosoat2016|website=Strategic Marine Alliance for Research and Training|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Results from Previous Cruises ==
Each cruise has a unique focus, varying as topics become more or less important. While the NoSoAT 2015 cruise had a strong focus in [[biological oceanography]], the NoSoAT 2016 cruise will be more focused in [[physical oceanography|physical]] and [[chemical oceanography]].&lt;ref name=MIFnM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Expedition2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knust|first1=Rainer|last2=Lochte|first2=Karin|title=The Expeditions PS95.1 and PS95.2 of the Research Vessel POLARSTERN to the Atlantic Ocean in 2015|journal=Berichte zur Polar- und Meeresforschung|volume=702|pages=1–72|doi=10.2312/BzPM_0702_2016|url=http://epic.awi.de/41683/1/BzPM_0702_2016.pdf|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These different approaches to studying marine and climate sciences allow for groups of post-doctorate students to be specifically trained within their respective fields.

=== NoSoAT 2015 - Expeditions PS95.1 and PS95.2 ===
The cruise track covers a broad range of habitats for various organisms and a broad range of characteristically different waters. Data collected during this cruise came from equipment such as a [[CTD (instrument)|Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth (CTD) Sonde]], a [[Bongonet]], a [[Ferrybox]], and a [[Continuous Plankton Recorder]] (CPR). Additionally, samples of [[phytoplankton]] and [[zooplankton]] were obtained and analyzed in conjunction with satellite data. Some preliminary results included the identification of three distinct water masses along the [[transect]], discrepancies in the comparison of ship-board [[chlorophyll a]] measurements with satellite-derived chlorophyll a data, latitudinal variations in the depth of the chlorophyll a maximum, and variations in the impact of [[microzooplankton]] grazing on phytoplankton communities.&lt;ref name=Expedition2015/&gt;

'''Occam's razor''' (also '''Ockham's razor''' or '''Ocham's razor'''; [[Latin]]: ''lex parsimoniae'' "'''law of parsimony'''") is the problem-solving principle that the simplest solution tends to be the correct one. When presented with competing [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] to solve a problem, one should select the solution with the fewest assumptions. The idea is attributed to English [[Franciscan]] friar [[William of Ockham]] (c. 1287–1347), a scholastic philosopher and theologian.

In science, Occam's razor is used as an [[Abductive reasoning|abductive]] [[heuristic]] in the development of theoretical models, rather than as a rigorous arbiter between candidate models.&lt;ref name="fn_(100)"&gt;Hugh G. Gauch, ''Scientific Method in Practice, Cambridge University Press'', 2003, {{ISBN|0-521-01708-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-01708-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(101)"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hoffman |first1=Roald |last2=Minkin |first2=Vladimir I. |last3=Carpenter |first3=Barry K. |title=Ockham's Razor and Chemistry |journal=International Journal for Philosophy of Chemistry |date=1997 |volume=3 |pages=3–28 |url=http://www.hyle.org/journal/issues/3/hoffman.htm |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[scientific method]], Occam's razor is not considered an irrefutable principle of [[logic]] or a scientific result; the preference for simplicity in the scientific method is based on the [[falsifiability]] criterion. For each accepted explanation of a phenomenon, there may be an extremely large, perhaps even incomprehensible, number of possible and more complex alternatives.  Since one can always burden failing explanations with [[ad hoc hypotheses|''ad hoc'' hypotheses]] to prevent them from being falsified, simpler theories are preferable to more complex ones because they are more [[test method|testable]].&lt;ref name="fn_(109)"&gt;{{cite book |origyear=2004 |year=2010 |author=Alan Baker |chapter=Simplicity |title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |chapter-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicity/ |publisher=Stanford University |place=California |issn=1095-5054 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2008 |last1=Courtney |first1=A. |last2=Courtney |first2=M. |title=Comments Regarding 'On the Nature of Science' |arxiv=0812.4932 |journal=Physics in Canada |volume=64 |issue=3 |pages=7–8|bibcode=2008arXiv0812.4932C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(114)"&gt;{{cite book |first=Elliott |last=Sober |chapter=Let's Razor Occam's Razor |pages=73–93 |editor-first=Dudley |editor-last=Knowles |title=Explanation and Its Limits |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The term ''Occam's razor'' did not appear until a few centuries after [[William of Ockham]]'s death in 1347. [[Libert Froidmont]], in his ''On Christian Philosophy of the Soul'', takes credit for the phrase, speaking of "''novacula occami''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ockam's Razor: A User's Manual|last=Sober|first=Elliott|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2015|isbn=1107692539|location=|pages=4|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ockham did not invent this principle, but the "razor"—and its association with him—may be due to the frequency and effectiveness with which he used it.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Ariew, Ockham's Razor: A Historical and Philosophical Analysis of Ockham's Principle of Parsimony, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; Ockham stated the principle in various ways, but the most popular version, "Entities are not to be multiplied without necessity" ({{lang|la|Non sunt multiplicanda entia sine necessitate}}) was formulated by the Irish [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] philosopher [[John Punch (theologian)|John Punch]] in his 1639 commentary on the works of [[Duns Scotus]].&lt;ref name="commentary"&gt;Johannes Poncius's commentary on John Duns Scotus's ''Opus Oxoniense,'' book III, dist. 34, q. 1. in John Duns Scotus ''Opera Omnia'', vol.15, Ed. Luke Wadding, Louvain (1639), reprinted Paris: Vives, (1894) p.483a&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formulations before William of Ockham ===
[[File:Pluralitas.jpg|thumb|Part of a page from Duns Scotus' book  ''Commentaria oxoniensia ad IV libros magistri Sententiarus'', novis curis edidit p. Marianus Fernandez Garcia (1914, p. 211)': "{{lang|la|Pluralitas non est ponenda sine necessitate}}", i.e., "Plurality is not to be posited without necessity"]]

The origins of what has come to be known as Occam's razor are traceable to the works of earlier philosophers such as [[John Duns Scotus]] (1265–1308), [[Robert Grosseteste]] (1175–1253), [[Maimonides]] (Moses ben-Maimon, 1138–1204), and even [[Aristotle]] (384–322&amp;nbsp;BC).&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Physics'' 189a15, ''On the Heavens'' 271a33. See also Franklin, ''op cit.'' note 44 to chap. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Charlesworth | first1 = M. J. | year = 1956 | title = Aristotle's Razor | url = | journal = Philosophical Studies (Ireland) | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 105–112 | doi=10.5840/philstudies1956606}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle writes in his ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'', "We may assume the superiority {{lang|la|ceteris paribus}} [other things being equal] of the demonstration which derives from fewer postulates or hypotheses."&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedians, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WIXP-3VhztgC ''Complexity and Dynamics''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617112734/https://books.google.com/books?id=WIXP-3VhztgC |date=17 June 2016 }} citing [[Richard McKeon]] (tr.) Aristotle's ''Posterior Analytics'' (1963) p.&amp;nbsp;150&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ptolemy]] ({{nowrap|c. AD 90 – c. AD 168}}) stated, "We consider it a good principle to explain the phenomena by the simplest hypothesis possible."&lt;ref name="Franklin"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=James Franklin (philosopher)|first=James|last=Franklin|year= 2001|title= The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability before Pascal|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press}} Chap 9. p.&amp;nbsp;241.&lt;/ref&gt;

Phrases such as "It is vain to do with more what can be done with fewer" and "A plurality is not to be posited without necessity" were commonplace in 13th-century [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] writing.&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt; Robert Grosseteste, in ''Commentary on'' [Aristotle's] ''the Posterior Analytics Books'' (''Commentarius in Posteriorum Analyticorum Libros'') (c. 1217–1220), declares: "That is better and more valuable which requires fewer, other circumstances being equal... For if one thing were demonstrated from many and another thing from fewer equally known premises, clearly that is better which is from fewer because it makes us know quickly, just as a universal demonstration is better than particular because it produces knowledge from fewer premises. Similarly in natural science, in moral science, and in metaphysics the best is that which needs no premises and the better that which needs the fewer, other circumstances being equal."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alistair Cameron Crombie]], ''Robert Grosseteste and the Origins of Experimental Science 1100–1700'' (1953) pp. 85–86&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' of [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274) states that "it is superfluous to suppose that what can be accounted for by a few principles has been produced by many." Aquinas uses this principle to construct an objection to [[God's existence]], an objection that he in turn answers and refutes generally (cf. ''[[quinque viae]]''), and specifically, through an argument based on [[causality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm#article3 |title=SUMMA THEOLOGICA: The existence of God (Prima Pars, Q. 2) |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2013-03-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428053715/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm#article3 |archivedate=28 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, Aquinas acknowledges the principle that today is known as Occam's razor, but prefers causal explanations to other simple explanations (cf. also [[Correlation does not imply causation]]).

=== William of Ockham ===
[[William of Ockham]] (''circa'' 1287–1347) was an English Franciscan friar and [[theologian]], an influential medieval [[philosopher]] and a [[nominalist]]. His popular fame as a great logician rests chiefly on the maxim attributed to him and known as Occam's razor. The term ''razor'' refers to distinguishing between two hypotheses either by "shaving away" unnecessary assumptions or cutting apart two similar conclusions.

While it has been claimed that Occam's razor is not found in any of William's writings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boingboing.net/2013/02/11/what-ockham-really-said.html |title=What Ockham really said |publisher=Boing Boing |first=Jacques |last=Vallee |date=2013-02-11 |accessdate=2013-03-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331171919/http://boingboing.net/2013/02/11/what-ockham-really-said.html |archivedate=31 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; one can cite statements such as {{Lang|la|Numquam ponenda est pluralitas sine necessitate}}[https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/William%20of%20Occam] ("Plurality must never be posited without necessity"), which occurs in his theological work on the [[The Four Books of Sentences|''Sentences of Peter Lombard'']] (''Quaestiones et decisiones in quattuor libros Sententiarum Petri Lombardi''; ed. Lugd., 1495, i, dist. 27, qu. 2, K).

Nevertheless, the precise words sometimes attributed to William of Ockham, {{lang|la|Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem}} (Entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bauer |first=Laurie |year=2007 |title=The linguistics Student's Handbook |location=Edinburgh |publisher= Edinburgh University Press}} p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; are absent in his extant works;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Flew |first=Antony |author-link= Antony Flew |year=1979 |title=A Dictionary of Philosophy |location=London |publisher=Pan Books}} p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; this particular phrasing comes from [[John Punch (theologian)|John Punch]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Alistair Cameron Crombie|Crombie, Alistair Cameron]] (1959), ''Medieval and Early Modern Philosophy'', Cambridge, MA: Harvard, Vol. 2, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; who described the principle as a "common axiom" (''axioma vulgare'') of the Scholastics.&lt;ref name="commentary"/&gt; William of Ockham's contribution seems to restrict the operation of this principle in matters pertaining to miracles and God's power; so, in the [[Eucharist]], a plurality of miracles is possible, simply because it pleases God.&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt;

This principle is sometimes phrased as {{lang|la|Pluralitas non est ponenda sine necessitate}} ("Plurality should not be posited without necessity").&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/424706/Ockhams-razor |title=Ockham's razor |year=2010 |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |accessdate=12 June 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823154602/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/424706/Ockhams-razor |archivedate=23 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Summa Totius Logicae'', i. 12, William of Ockham cites the principle of economy, {{lang|la|Frustra fit per plura quod potest fieri per pauciora}} ("It is futile to do with more things that which can be done with fewer"; Thorburn, 1918, pp.&amp;nbsp;352–53; [[William Kneale (logician)|Kneale]] and Kneale, 1962, p.&amp;nbsp;243.)

=== Later formulations ===
To quote [[Isaac Newton]], "We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances. Therefore, to the same natural effects we must, as far as possible, assign the same causes."&lt;ref name="Hawking"&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Shoulders of Giants|first=Stephen |last=Hawking|authorlink=Stephen Hawking|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0eRZr_HK0LgC&amp;pg=PA731|page=731|isbn=0-7624-1698-X|year=2003|publisher=Running Press|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Primary source: {{harvtxt|Newton|2011|p=387}} wrote the following two "philosophizing rules" at the beginning of part&amp;nbsp;3 of the [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]] 1726 edition.

: Regula I. Causas rerum naturalium non plures admitti debere, quam quæ &amp; veræ sint &amp; earum phænomenis explicandis sufficient.
: Regula II. Ideoque effectuum naturalium ejusdem generis eædem assignandæ sunt causæ, quatenus fieri potest.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]] offers a particular version of Occam's razor: "Whenever possible, substitute constructions out of known entities for inferences to unknown entities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logical-construction/|title=Logical Constructions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1960, [[Ray Solomonoff]] founded the [[Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference|theory of universal inductive inference]], the theory of prediction based on observations; for example, predicting the next symbol based upon a given series of symbols. The only assumption is that the environment follows some unknown but computable probability distribution. This theory is a mathematical formalization of Occam's razor.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Induction: From Kolmogorov and Solomonoff to De Finetti and Back to Kolmogorov JJ McCall – Metroeconomica, 2004 – Wiley Online Library.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|first=A.

Another technical approach to Occam's razor is [[Ontological commitment#Ontological parsimony|ontological parsimony]].&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;
{{cite web |last=Baker |first=Alan |title=Simplicity |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition) |editor-first=Edward N. |editor-last=Zalta |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/simplicity/#OntPar |date=February 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parsimony means spareness and is also referred to as the Rule of Simplicity. This is considered a strong version of Occam's razor.&lt;ref name="math.ucr.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/occam.html|title=What is Occam's Razor?|website=math.ucr.edu|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706234202/http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/occam.html|archivedate=6 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Everywhere The Soles of Your Feet Shall Tread |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=shdlDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT30 |author=Stormy Dawn |date=17 July 2017 |isbn=9781480838024 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A variation used in medicine is called the "[[Zebra (medicine)|Zebra]]": a doctor should reject an exotic medical diagnosis when a more commonplace explanation is more likely, derived from [[Theodore Woodward]]'s dictum "When you hear hoofbeats, think of horses not zebras".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sotos |first=John G. |year=2006 |origyear=1991 |title=Zebra Cards: An Aid to Obscure Diagnoses |location=Mt. Vernon, VA |publisher=Mt. Vernon Book Systems |isbn=978-0-9818193-0-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ernst Mach]] formulated the stronger version of Occam's razor into [[physics]], which he called the Principle of Economy stating: "Scientists must use the simplest means of arriving at their results and exclude everything not perceived by the senses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Philosophical Views of Ernst Mach |first=Erich |last=Becher |journal=The Philosophical Review |volume=14 |issue=5 |year=1905 |pages=535–562 |doi=10.2307/2177489 |jstor=2177489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This principle goes back at least as far as Aristotle, who wrote "Nature operates in the shortest way possible."&lt;ref name="math.ucr.edu"/&gt; The idea of parsimony or simplicity in deciding between theories, though not the intent of the original expression of Occam's razor, has been assimilated into our culture as the widespread layman's formulation that "the simplest explanation is usually the correct one."&lt;ref name="math.ucr.edu"/&gt;

== Justifications ==

=== Aesthetic ===
Prior to the 20th century, it was a commonly held belief that nature itself was simple and that simpler hypotheses about nature were thus more likely to be true. This notion was deeply rooted in the aesthetic value that simplicity holds for human thought and the justifications presented for it often drew from [[theology]]. [[Thomas Aquinas]] made this argument in the 13th century, writing, "If a thing can be done adequately by means of one, it is superfluous to do it by means of several; for we observe that nature does not employ two instruments [if] one suffices."&lt;ref&gt;Pegis 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 20th century, [[epistemology|epistemological]] justifications based on [[Inductive reasoning|induction]], [[logic]], [[pragmatism]], and especially [[probability theory]] have become more popular among philosophers.{{Who|date=July 2014}}

=== Empirical ===
Occam's razor has gained strong empirical support in helping to converge on better theories (see "Applications" section below for some examples).

In the related concept of [[overfitting]], excessively complex models are affected by [[statistical noise]] (a problem also known as the bias-variance trade-off), whereas simpler models may capture the underlying structure better and may thus have better [[predictive inference|predictive]] performance. It is, however, often difficult to deduce which part of the data is noise (cf. [[model selection]], [[test set]], [[minimum description length]], [[Bayesian inference]], etc.).

==== Testing the razor ====
The razor's statement that "other things being equal, simpler explanations are generally better than more complex ones" is amenable to empirical testing. Another interpretation of the razor's statement would be that "simpler hypotheses are generally better than the complex ones". The procedure to test the former interpretation would compare the track records of simple and comparatively complex explanations. If one accepts the first interpretation, the validity of Occam's razor as a tool would then have to be rejected if the more complex explanations were more often correct than the less complex ones (while the converse would lend support to its use). If the latter interpretation is accepted, the validity of Occam's razor as a tool could possibly be accepted if the simpler hypotheses led to correct conclusions more often than not.

[[File:Leprechaun or Clurichaun.png|thumb|Possible explanations can become needlessly complex. It is coherent, for instance, to add the involvement of [[leprechaun]]s to any explanation, but Occam's razor would prevent such additions unless they were necessary.]]

Some increases in complexity are sometimes necessary. So there remains a justified general bias toward the simpler of two competing explanations. To understand why, consider that for each accepted explanation of a phenomenon, there is always an infinite number of possible, more complex, and ultimately incorrect, alternatives. This is so because one can always burden a failing explanation with an [[ad hoc hypothesis]]. Ad hoc hypotheses are justifications that prevent theories from being falsified. Even other empirical criteria, such as [[consilience]], can never truly eliminate such explanations as competition. Each true explanation, then, may have had many alternatives that were simpler and false, but also an infinite number of alternatives that were more complex and false. But if an alternative ad hoc hypothesis were indeed justifiable, its implicit conclusions would be empirically verifiable. On a commonly accepted repeatability principle, these alternative theories have never been observed and continue to escape observation.{{clarify|date=September 2017}} In addition, one does not say an explanation is true if it has not withstood this principle.

Put another way, any new, and even more complex, theory can still possibly be true. For example, if an individual makes [[supernatural]] claims that [[leprechauns]] were responsible for breaking a vase, the simpler explanation would be that he is mistaken, but ongoing ad hoc justifications (e.g. "... and that's not me on the film; they tampered with that, too") successfully prevent outright falsification. This endless supply of elaborate competing explanations, called [[saving hypothesis|saving hypotheses]], cannot be ruled out—except by using Occam's razor.&lt;ref name=Stanovich2007&gt;Stanovich, Keith E. (2007). ''How to Think Straight About Psychology''. Boston: Pearson Education, pp. 19–33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://skepdic.com/adhoc.html Carroll, Robert T. "Ad hoc hypothesis."

None of the papers provided a balance of evidence that complexity of method improved forecast accuracy. In the 25 papers with quantitative comparisons, complexity increased forecast errors by an average of 27 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Green | first1 = K.

=== Practical considerations and pragmatism ===
{{See also|Pragmatism|Problem of Induction}}

=== Mathematical ===
One justification of Occam's razor is a direct result of basic [[probability theory]]. By definition, all assumptions introduce possibilities for error; if an assumption does not improve the accuracy of a theory, its only effect is to increase the probability that the overall theory is wrong.

There have also been other attempts to derive Occam's razor from probability theory, including notable attempts made by [[Harold Jeffreys]] and [[Edwin Thompson Jaynes|E. T. Jaynes]]. The probabilistic (Bayesian) basis for Occam's razor is elaborated by [[David J. C. MacKay]] in chapter 28 of his book ''Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms | url=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/itprnn/book.pdf | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915043535/http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/itprnn/book.pdf | archivedate=15 September 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he emphasizes that a prior bias in favour of simpler models is not required.

[[William H. Jefferys]] and [[James Berger (statistician)|James O. Berger]] (1991) generalize and quantify the original formulation's "assumptions" concept as the degree to which a proposition is unnecessarily accommodating to possible observable data.&lt;ref name="Jefferys"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jefferys|first=William H.|last2=Berger |first2=James O.|title=Ockham's Razor and Bayesian Statistics |journal=[[American Scientist]]|year=1991|volume=80|issue=1|pages=64–72|jstor=29774559|url=http://quasar.as.utexas.edu/papers/ockham.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050304065538/http://quasar.as.utexas.edu/papers/ockham.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2005|df=dmy-all}} (preprint available as "Sharpening Occam's Razor on a Bayesian Strop").&lt;/ref&gt; They state, "A hypothesis with fewer adjustable parameters will automatically have an enhanced posterior probability, due to the fact that the predictions it makes are sharp."&lt;ref name="Jefferys" /&gt; The model they propose balances the precision of a theory's predictions against their sharpness{{vague|date=September 2016}}—preferring theories that sharply{{vague|date=September 2016}} make correct predictions over theories that accommodate a wide range of other possible results. This, again, reflects the mathematical relationship between key concepts in [[Bayesian inference]] (namely [[marginal probability]], [[conditional probability]], and [[posterior probability]]).

The [[bias–variance tradeoff]] is a framework that incorporates the Occam's razor principal in its balance between overfitting (i.e. variance minimization) and underfitting (i.e. bias minimization).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Spall |first1=James C. |title=Introduction to Stochastic Search and Optimization: Estimation, Simulation, and Control |date=11 March 2005 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9780471441908 |pages=330–331 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other philosophers ===

==== Karl Popper ====
[[Karl Popper]] argues that a preference for simple theories need not appeal to practical or aesthetic considerations. Our preference for simplicity may be justified by its [[falsifiability]] criterion: we prefer simpler theories to more complex ones "because their empirical content is greater; and because they are better testable" (Popper 1992). The idea here is that a simple theory applies to more cases than a more complex one, and is thus more easily falsifiable. This is again comparing a simple theory to a more complex theory where both explain the data equally well.

==== Elliott Sober ====
The philosopher of science [[Elliott Sober]] once argued along the same lines as Popper, tying simplicity with "informativeness": The simplest theory is the more informative, in the sense that it requires less information to a question.&lt;ref name=Sober975&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sober |first=Elliott |authorlink=Elliott Sober |year=1975 |title=Simplicity |location=Oxford |publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-824407-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since rejected this account of simplicity, purportedly because it fails to provide an [[epistemology|epistemic]] justification for simplicity. He now believes that simplicity considerations (and considerations of parsimony in particular) do not count unless they reflect something more fundamental. Philosophers, he suggests, may have made the error of hypostatizing simplicity (i.e., endowed it with a ''[[sui generis]]'' existence), when it has meaning only when embedded in a specific context (Sober 1992). If we fail to justify simplicity considerations on the basis of the context in which we use them, we may have no non-circular justification: "Just as the question 'why be rational?' may have no non-circular answer, the same may be true of the question 'why should simplicity be considered in evaluating the plausibility of hypotheses?'"&lt;ref name=Sober2002&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sober |first=Elliott |year=2004 |title=Simplicity, Inference and Modeling: Keeping it Sophisticatedly Simple |editor1-first=Arnold |editor1-last=Zellner |editor2-first=Hugo A. |editor2-last=Keuzenkamp |editor2-link=Hugo A.

==== Richard Swinburne ====

[[Richard Swinburne]] argues for simplicity on logical grounds:

{{quote|... the simplest hypothesis proposed as an explanation of phenomena is more likely to be the true one than is any other available hypothesis, that its predictions are more likely to be true than those of any other available hypothesis, and that it is an ultimate ''a priori'' epistemic principle that simplicity is evidence for truth.|Swinburne 1997}}

According to Swinburne, since our choice of theory cannot be determined by data (see [[Underdetermination]] and [[Duhem-Quine thesis]]), we must rely on some criterion to determine which theory to use. Since it is absurd to have no logical method for settling on one hypothesis amongst an infinite number of equally data-compliant hypotheses, we should choose the simplest theory: "Either science is irrational [in the way it judges theories and predictions probable] or the principle of simplicity is a fundamental synthetic a priori truth." (Swinburne 1997).

==== Ludwig Wittgenstein ====
From the ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'':

* 3.328 "If a sign is not necessary then it is meaningless. That is the meaning of Occam's Razor."
: (If everything in the symbolism works as though a sign had meaning, then it has meaning.)
* 4.04 "In the proposition there must be exactly as many things distinguishable as there are in the state of affairs, which it represents. They must both possess the same logical (mathematical) multiplicity (cf. Hertz's Mechanics, on Dynamic Models)."
* 5.47321 "Occam's Razor is, of course, not an arbitrary rule nor one justified by its practical success. It simply says that unnecessary elements in a symbolism mean nothing. Signs which serve one purpose are logically equivalent; signs which serve no purpose are logically meaningless."

and on the related concept of "simplicity":

* 6.363 "The procedure of induction consists in accepting as true the simplest law that can be reconciled with our experiences."

=== Science and the scientific method ===
[[File:Heliocentric.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Andreas Cellarius]]'s illustration of the Copernican system, from the ''[[Harmonia Macrocosmica]]'' (1660). Future positions of the sun, moon and other solar system bodies can be calculated using a [[Geocentrism|geocentric]] model (the earth is at the centre) or using a [[Heliocentrism#The view of modern science|heliocentric model]] (the sun is at the centre). Both work, but the geocentric model arrives at the same conclusions through a much more complex system of calculations than the heliocentric model. This was pointed out in a preface to [[Copernicus]]' first edition of ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]''.]]
In [[science]], Occam's razor is used as a [[heuristic]] to guide scientists in developing theoretical models rather than as an arbiter between published models.&lt;ref name="fn_(100)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(101)"/&gt; In [[physics]], parsimony was an important heuristic in [[Albert Einstein]]'s formulation of [[special relativity]],&lt;ref name="fn_(102)"&gt;{{cite journal |language=German |first=Albert |last=Einstein |authorlink=Albert Einstein |title=Does the Inertia of a Body Depend Upon Its Energy Content? |journal=Annalen der Physik |pages=639–41 |year=1905 |issue=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(103)"&gt;L. Nash, The Nature of the Natural Sciences, Boston: Little, Brown (1963).&lt;/ref&gt; in the development and application of the [[principle of least action]] by [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]] and [[Leonhard Euler]],&lt;ref name="fn_(104)"&gt;{{cite journal |language=French |first=P. L. M. |last=de Maupertuis |title=Mémoires de l'Académie Royale |page=423 |year=1744}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the development of [[quantum mechanics]] by [[Max Planck]], [[Werner Heisenberg]] and [[Louis de Broglie]].&lt;ref name="fn_(101)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(105)"&gt;{{cite journal |language=French |first=L. |last=de Broglie |title=Annales de Physique |pages=22–128 |year=1925 |issue=3/10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[chemistry]], Occam's razor is often an important heuristic when developing a model of a [[reaction mechanism]].&lt;ref name="fn_(107)"&gt;RA Jackson, Mechanism: An Introduction to the Study of Organic Reactions, Clarendon, Oxford, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(108)"&gt;Carpenter, B. K. (1984). ''Determination of Organic Reaction Mechanism'', New York: Wiley-Interscience.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is useful as a heuristic in developing models of reaction mechanisms, it has been shown to fail as a criterion for selecting among some selected published models.&lt;ref name="fn_(101)"/&gt; In this context, Einstein himself expressed caution when he formulated Einstein's Constraint: "It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience".&lt;!-- ref: "On the Method of Theoretical Physics" The Herbert Spencer Lecture, delivered at Oxford (10 June 1933); also published in ''Philosophy of Science'', Vol. 1, No. 2 (April 1934), pp. 163–169., p. 165. --&gt; An often-quoted version of this constraint (which cannot be verified as posited by Einstein himself)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/05/13/einstein-simple/|title=Everything Should Be Made as Simple as Possible, But Not Simpler|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529075018/http://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/05/13/einstein-simple/|archivedate=29 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; says "Everything should be kept as simple as possible, but not simpler."

In the scientific method, parsimony is an [[epistemological]], [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] or [[heuristic]] preference, not an irrefutable principle of [[logic]] or a scientific result.&lt;ref name="fn_(109)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(114)" /&gt; As a logical principle, Occam's razor would demand that scientists accept the simplest possible theoretical explanation for existing data. However, science has shown repeatedly that future data often support more complex theories than do existing data. Science prefers the simplest explanation that is consistent with the data available at a given time, but the simplest explanation may be ruled out as new data become available.&lt;ref name="fn_(100)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt; That is, science is open to the possibility that future experiments might support more complex theories than demanded by current data and is more interested in designing experiments to discriminate between competing theories than favoring one theory over another based merely on philosophical principles.&lt;ref name="fn_(109)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(114)" /&gt;

When scientists use the idea of parsimony, it has meaning only in a very specific context of inquiry. Several background assumptions are required for parsimony to connect with plausibility in a particular research problem. The reasonableness of parsimony in one research context may have nothing to do with its reasonableness in another. It is a mistake to think that there is a single global principle that spans diverse subject matter.&lt;ref name="fn_(114)" /&gt;

It has been suggested that Occam's razor is a widely accepted example of extraevidential consideration, even though it is entirely a metaphysical assumption. There is little [[empirical evidence]] that the world is actually simple or that simple accounts are more likely to be true than complex ones.&lt;ref name="fn_(120)"&gt;{{cite journal |date=4 February 1994 |author1=Naomi Oreskes |author2=Kristin Shrader-Frechette |author3=Kenneth Belitz |title=Verification, Validation, and Confirmation of Numerical Models in the Earth Sciences |journal=Science |volume=263 |pages=641–646 |url=http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/users/brooks/public_html/feda/papers/Oreskes1.pdf |postscript=&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;see note 25 |issue=5147 |bibcode=1994Sci...263..641O |doi=10.1126/science.263.5147.641 |pmid=17747657 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502042408/http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/users/brooks/public_html/feda/papers/Oreskes1.pdf |archivedate=2 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the time, Occam's razor is a conservative tool, cutting out "crazy, complicated constructions" and assuring "that hypotheses are grounded in the science of the day", thus yielding "normal" science: models of explanation and prediction.&lt;ref name="fn_(101)" /&gt; There are, however, notable exceptions where Occam's razor turns a conservative scientist into a reluctant revolutionary. For example, [[Max Planck]] interpolated between the [[Wien approximation|Wien]] and [[Rayleigh–Jeans law|Jeans]] radiation laws and used Occam's razor logic to formulate the quantum hypothesis, even resisting that hypothesis as it became more obvious that it was correct.&lt;ref name="fn_(101)"/&gt;

Appeals to simplicity were used to argue against the phenomena of meteorites, [[ball lightning]], [[continental drift]], and [[reverse transcriptase]]{{fact|date=August 2018}}. One can argue for atomic building blocks for matter, because it provides a simpler explanation for the observed reversibility of both mixing and chemical reactions as simple separation and rearrangements of atomic building blocks. At the time, however, the [[atomic theory]] was considered more complex because it implied the existence of invisible particles that had not been directly detected. [[Ernst Mach]] and the logical positivists rejected [[John Dalton]]'s [[atomic theory]] until the reality of atoms was more evident in [[Brownian motion]], as shown by [[Albert Einstein]].&lt;ref name=Pojman2009&gt;{{cite book |year=2009 |author=Paul Pojman |chapter=Ernst Mach |title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |chapter-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ernst-mach/ |place=California |publisher=Stanford University |issn=1095-5054 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same way, postulating the [[Luminiferous aether|aether]] is more complex than transmission of light through a [[vacuum]]. At the time, however, all known waves propagated through a physical medium, and it seemed simpler to postulate the existence of a medium than to theorize about wave propagation without a medium. Likewise, Newton's idea of light particles seemed simpler than Christiaan Huygens's idea of waves, so many favored it. In this case, as it turned out, neither the wave—nor the particle—explanation alone suffices, as [[wave–particle duality|light behaves like waves and like particles]].

Three axioms presupposed by the scientific method are realism (the existence of objective reality), the existence of natural laws, and the constancy of natural law. Rather than depend on provability of these axioms, science depends on the fact that they have not been objectively falsified. Occam's razor and parsimony support, but do not prove, these axioms of science. The general principle of science is that theories (or models) of natural law must be consistent with repeatable experimental observations. This ultimate arbiter (selection criterion) rests upon the axioms mentioned above.&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt;

There are examples where Occam's razor would have favored the wrong theory given the available data. Simplicity principles are useful philosophical preferences for choosing a more likely theory from among several possibilities that are all consistent with available data. A single instance of Occam's razor favoring a wrong theory falsifies the razor as a general principle.&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt; Michael Lee and others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = M.

If multiple models of natural law make exactly the same testable predictions, they are equivalent and there is no need for parsimony to choose a preferred one. For example, Newtonian, Hamiltonian and Lagrangian classical mechanics are equivalent. Physicists have no interest in using Occam's razor to say the other two are wrong. Likewise, there is no demand for simplicity principles to arbitrate between wave and matrix formulations of quantum mechanics. Science often does not demand arbitration or selection criteria between models that make the same testable predictions.&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt;

=== Biology ===
Biologists or philosophers of biology use Occam's razor in either of two contexts both in [[evolution|evolutionary biology]]: the units of selection controversy and [[systematics]]. [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] in his book ''[[Adaptation and Natural Selection]]'' (1966) argues that the best way to explain [[altruism]] among animals is based on low-level (i.e., individual) selection as opposed to high-level group selection. Altruism is defined by some evolutionary biologists (e.g., R. Alexander, 1987; W. D. Hamilton, 1964) as behavior that is beneficial to others (or to the group) at a cost to the individual, and many posit individual selection as the mechanism that explains altruism solely in terms of the behaviors of individual organisms acting in their own self-interest (or in the interest of their genes, via kin selection). Williams was arguing against the perspective of others who propose selection at the level of the group as an evolutionary mechanism that selects for altruistic traits (e.g., D. S. Wilson &amp; E. O. Wilson, 2007). The basis for Williams' contention is that of the two, individual selection is the more parsimonious theory. In doing so he is invoking a variant of Occam's razor known as [[Morgan's Canon]]: "In no case is an animal activity to be interpreted in terms of higher psychological processes, if it can be fairly interpreted in terms of processes which stand lower in the scale of psychological evolution and development." (Morgan 1903).

However, more recent biological analyses, such as [[Richard Dawkins]]' ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', have contended that Morgan's Canon is not the simplest and most basic explanation. Dawkins argues the way evolution works is that the genes propagated in most copies end up determining the development of that particular species, i.e., natural selection turns out to select specific genes, and this is really the fundamental underlying principle that automatically gives individual and group selection as [[Emergent evolution|emergent]] features of evolution.

[[Zoology]] provides an example. [[Muskox]]en, when threatened by [[Gray wolf|wolves]], form a circle with the males on the outside and the females and young on the inside. This is an example of a behavior by the males that seems to be altruistic. The behavior is disadvantageous to them individually but beneficial to the group as a whole and was thus seen by some to support the group selection theory.  Another interpretation is kin selection: if the males are protecting their offspring, they are protecting copies of their own alleles.  Engaging in this behavior would be favored by individual selection if the cost to the male musk ox is less than half of the benefit received by his calf – which could easily be the case if wolves have an easier time killing calves than adult males.  It could also be the case that male musk oxen would be individually less likely to be killed by wolves if they stood in a circle with their horns pointing out, regardless of whether they were protecting the females and offspring.  That would be an example of regular natural selection – a phenomenon called "the selfish herd".

[[Systematics]] is the branch of [[biology]] that attempts to establish patterns of genealogical relationship among biological taxa. It is also concerned with their classification. There are three primary camps in systematics: cladists, pheneticists, and evolutionary taxonomists. The cladists hold that [[genealogy]] alone should determine classification, pheneticists contend that overall similarity is the determining criterion, while evolutionary taxonomists say that both genealogy and similarity count in classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sober|first1=Elliot|title=Reconstructing the Past: Parsimony, Evolution, and Inference|date=1998|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|isbn=0-262-69144-2|page=7|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is among the cladists that Occam's razor is to be found, although their term for it is ''cladistic parsimony''. Cladistic parsimony (or [[maximum parsimony]]) is a method of phylogenetic inference in the construction of types of [[phylogenetic trees]] (more specifically, cladograms). [[Cladistics|Cladograms]] are branching, tree-like structures used to represent hypotheses of relative degree of relationship, based on shared, derived character states. Cladistic parsimony is used to select as the preferred hypothesis of relationships the cladogram that requires the fewest implied character state transformations. Critics of the cladistic approach often observe that for some types of tree, parsimony consistently produces the wrong results, regardless of how much data is collected (this is called statistical inconsistency, or [[long branch attraction]]). However, this criticism is also potentially true for any type of phylogenetic inference, unless the model used to estimate the tree reflects the way that evolution actually happened.  Because this information is not empirically accessible, the criticism of statistical inconsistency against parsimony holds no force.&lt;ref&gt;Brower, AVZ. 2017.  Statistical consistency and phylogenetic inference: a brief review.  Cladistics. (early view:  {{DOI|10.1111/cla.12216}})&lt;/ref&gt;  For a book-length treatment of cladistic parsimony, see [[Elliott Sober]]'s ''Reconstructing the Past: Parsimony, Evolution, and Inference'' (1988). For a discussion of both uses of Occam's razor in biology, see Sober's article "Let's Razor Ockham's Razor" (1990).

Other methods for inferring evolutionary relationships use parsimony in a more traditional way. [[Likelihood function|Likelihood]] methods for phylogeny use parsimony as they do for all likelihood tests, with hypotheses requiring few differing parameters (i.e., numbers of different rates of character change or different frequencies of character state transitions) being treated as null hypotheses relative to hypotheses requiring many differing parameters. Thus, complex hypotheses must predict data much better than do simple hypotheses before researchers reject the simple hypotheses. Recent advances employ [[information theory]], a close cousin of likelihood, which uses Occam's razor in the same way.

[[Francis Crick]] has commented on potential limitations of Occam's razor in biology. He advances the argument that because biological systems are the products of (an ongoing) natural selection, the mechanisms are not necessarily optimal in an obvious sense. He cautions: "While Ockham's razor is a useful tool in the physical sciences, it can be a very dangerous implement in biology. It is thus very rash to use simplicity and elegance as a guide in biological research."&lt;ref&gt;Crick 1988, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[biogeography]], parsimony is used to infer ancient [[Historical migration|migrations]] of [[species]] or [[population]]s by observing the geographic distribution and relationships of existing [[organism]]s. Given the phylogenetic tree, ancestral migrations are inferred to be those that require the minimum amount of total movement.

=== Religion ===
{{Main| Existence of God}}

In the [[philosophy of religion]], Occam's razor is sometimes applied to the [[existence of God]]. [[William of Ockham]] himself was a Christian. He believed in God, and in the authority of Scripture; he writes that "nothing ought to be posited without a reason given, unless it is self-evident (literally, known through itself) or known by experience or proved by the authority of Sacred Scripture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |contribution-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ockham/ |publisher=Stanford |title=Encyclopedia of Philosophy |contribution=William Ockham |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ockham believed that an explanation has no sufficient basis in reality when it does not harmonize with reason, experience, or the Bible. However, unlike many theologians of his time, Ockham did not believe God could be logically proven with arguments. To Ockham, science was a matter of discovery, but theology was a matter of [[revelation]] and [[faith]]. He states: "only faith gives us access to theological truths. The ways of God are not open to reason, for God has freely chosen to create a world and establish a way of salvation within it apart from any necessary laws that human logic or rationality can uncover."&lt;ref&gt;Dale T Irvin &amp; Scott W Sunquist. ''History of World Christian Movement Volume, I: Earliest Christianity to 1453'', p. 434. {{ISBN|9781570753961}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[St. Thomas Aquinas]], in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', uses a formulation of Occam's razor to construct an objection to the idea that God exists, which he refutes directly with a counterargument:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm |title=SUMMA THEOLOGICA: The existence of God (Prima Pars, Q. 2) |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2013-03-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428053715/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm |archivedate=28 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Further, it is superfluous to suppose that what can be accounted for by a few principles has been produced by many. But it seems that everything we see in the world can be accounted for by other principles, supposing God did not exist. For all natural things can be reduced to one principle which is nature; and all voluntary things can be reduced to one principle which is human reason, or will. Therefore there is no need to suppose God's existence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In turn, Aquinas answers this with the ''[[quinque viae]]'', and addresses the particular objection above with the following answer:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since nature works for a determinate end under the direction of a higher agent, whatever is done by nature must needs be traced back to God, as to its first cause. So also whatever is done voluntarily must also be traced back to some higher cause other than human reason or will, since these can change or fail; for all things that are changeable and capable of defect must be traced back to an immovable and self-necessary first principle, as was shown in the body of the Article.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rather than argue for the necessity of a god, some theists base their belief upon grounds independent of, or prior to, reason, making Occam's razor irrelevant. This was the stance of [[Søren Kierkegaard]], who viewed belief in God as a [[leap of faith]] that sometimes directly opposed reason.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; This is also the doctrine of [[Gordon Clark]]'s [[presuppositional apologetics]], with the exception that Clark never thought the leap of faith was contrary to reason (see also [[Fideism]]).

Various [[Arguments for the existence of God|arguments in favor of God]] establish God as a useful or even necessary assumption. Contrastingly some anti-theists hold firmly to the belief that assuming the existence of God introduces unnecessary complexity (Schmitt 2005, e.g., the [[Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit]]).

Another application of the principle is to be found in the work of [[George Berkeley]] (1685–1753). Berkeley was an idealist who believed that all of reality could be explained in terms of the mind alone. He invoked Occam's razor against [[materialism]], stating that matter was not required by his metaphysic and was thus eliminable. One potential problem with this belief is that it's possible, given Berkeley's position, to find [[Solipsism|solipsism]] itself more in line with the razor than a God-mediated world beyond a single thinker.

Occam's razor may also be recognized in the apocryphal story about an exchange between [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] and [[Napoleon]]. It is said that in praising Laplace for one of his recent publications, the emperor asked how it was that the name of God, which featured so frequently in the writings of [[Lagrange]], appeared nowhere in Laplace's. At that, he is said to have replied, "It's because I had no need of that hypothesis."&lt;ref&gt;p. 282, [https://books.google.com/books?id=88xZAAAAcAAJ ''Mémoires du docteur F. Antommarchi, ou les derniers momens de Napoléon''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514072842/https://books.google.com/books?id=88xZAAAAcAAJ |date=14 May 2016 }}, vol. 1, 1825, Paris: Barrois L'Ainé&lt;/ref&gt; Though some point to this story as illustrating Laplace's [[atheism]], more careful consideration suggests that he may instead have intended merely to illustrate the power of [[methodological naturalism]], or even simply that the fewer [[premise|logical premises]] one assumes, the [[List of mathematical jargon#strong|stronger]] is one's conclusion.

In his article "Sensations and Brain Processes" (1959), [[J. J. C. Smart]] invoked Occam's razor with the aim to justify his preference of the mind-brain identity theory over [[mind-body dualism|spirit-body dualism]]. Dualists state that there are two kinds of substances in the universe: physical (including the body) and spiritual, which is non-physical. In contrast, identity theorists state that everything is physical, including consciousness, and that there is nothing nonphysical. Though it is impossible to appreciate the spiritual when limiting oneself to the physical, Smart maintained that identity theory explains all phenomena by assuming only a physical reality. Subsequently, Smart has been severely criticized for his use (or misuse) of Occam's razor and ultimately retracted his advocacy of it in this context. [[Paul Churchland]] (1984) states that by itself Occam's razor is inconclusive regarding duality. In a similar way, Dale Jacquette (1994) stated that Occam's razor has been used in attempts to justify eliminativism and reductionism in the philosophy of mind. Eliminativism is the thesis that the ontology of [[folk psychology]] including such entities as "pain", "joy", "desire", "fear", etc., are eliminable in favor of an ontology of a completed neuroscience.

=== Penal ethics ===
In penal theory and the philosophy of punishment, parsimony refers specifically to taking care in the distribution of [[punishment]] in order to avoid excessive punishment. In the [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] approach to the philosophy of punishment, [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s "parsimony principle" states that any punishment greater than is required to achieve its end is unjust. The concept is related but not identical to the legal concept of [[proportionality (law)|proportionality]]. Parsimony is a key consideration of the modern [[restorative justice]], and is a component of utilitarian approaches to punishment, as well as the [[prison abolition movement]]. Bentham believed that true parsimony would require punishment to be individualised to take account of the [[sensibility]] of the individual—an individual more sensitive to punishment should be given a proportionately lesser one, since otherwise needless pain would be inflicted. Later utilitarian writers have tended to abandon this idea, in large part due to the impracticality of determining each alleged criminal's relative sensitivity to specific punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tonry | first1 = Michael | year = 2005 | title =  Obsolescence and Immanence in Penal Theory and Policy | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060623074821/http://www.columbialawreview.org/pdf/Tonry-Web.pdf | journal = [[Columbia Law Review]] | volume = 105 | issue = | pages = 1233–1275 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Probability theory and statistics ===
Marcus Hutter's universal artificial intelligence builds upon [[Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference|Solomonoff's mathematical formalization of the razor]] to calculate the expected value of an action.

There are various papers in scholarly journals deriving formal versions of Occam's razor from probability theory, applying it in [[statistical inference]], and using it to come up with criteria for penalizing complexity in statistical inference.

One of the problems with the original formulation of the razor is that it only applies to models with the same explanatory power (i.e., it only tells us to prefer the simplest of equally good models). A more general form of the razor can be derived from Bayesian model comparison, which is based on [[Bayes factor]]s and can be used to compare models that don't fit the observations equally well. These methods can sometimes optimally balance the complexity and power of a model. Generally, the exact Occam factor is intractable, but approximations such as [[Akaike information criterion]], [[Bayesian information criterion]], [[Variational Bayesian methods]], [[false discovery rate]], and [[Laplace's method]] are used. Many [[artificial intelligence]] researchers are now employing such techniques, for instance through work on [[Occam Learning]] or more generally on the [[Free energy principle]].

Statistical versions of Occam's razor have a more rigorous formulation than what philosophical discussions produce. In particular, they must have a specific definition of the term ''simplicity'', and that definition can vary. For example, in the [[Andrey Kolmogorov|Kolmogorov]]–[[Gregory Chaitin|Chaitin]] [[minimum description length]] approach, the subject must pick a [[Turing machine]] whose operations describe the basic operations ''believed'' to represent "simplicity" by the subject. However, one could always choose a Turing machine with a simple operation that happened to construct one's entire theory and would hence score highly under the razor. This has led to two opposing camps: one that believes Occam's razor is objective, and one that believes it is subjective.

==== Objective razor ====
The minimum instruction set of a [[universal Turing machine]] requires approximately the same length description across different formulations, and is small compared to the [[Kolmogorov complexity]] of most practical theories. [[Marcus Hutter]] has used this consistency to define a "natural" Turing machine of small size as the proper basis for excluding arbitrarily complex instruction sets in the formulation of razors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hutter1.net/ait.htm|title=Algorithmic Information Theory|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224043538/http://www.hutter1.net/ait.htm|archivedate=24 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the program for the universal program as the "hypothesis", and the representation of the evidence as program data, it has been formally proven under [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] that "the sum of the log universal probability of the model plus the log of the probability of the data given the model should be minimized."&lt;ref&gt;Paul M. B. Vitányi and Ming Li; ''IEEE Transactions on Information Theory'', Volume 46, Issue 2, Mar 2000 Page(s):446–464, "Minimum Description Length Induction, Bayesianism and Kolmogorov Complexity."&lt;/ref&gt; Interpreting this as minimising the total length of a two-part message encoding model followed by data given model gives us the [[minimum message length]] (MML) principle.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

One possible conclusion from mixing the concepts of Kolmogorov complexity and Occam's razor is that an ideal data compressor would also be a scientific explanation/formulation generator. Some attempts have been made to re-derive known laws from considerations of simplicity or compressibility.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=physics/0001020|title= Why Occam's Razor|journal=Foundations of Physics Letters|volume=17|issue=3|pages=255–266|last1=Standish|first1=Russell K|year=2000|doi=10.1023/B:FOPL.0000032475.18334.0e|bibcode=2004FoPhL..17..255S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]], the appropriate mathematical theory of Occam's razor already exists, namely, [[Ray Solomonoff|Solomonoff's]] [[Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference|theory of optimal inductive inference]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Solomonoff | first1 = Ray | authorlink = Ray Solomonoff | year = 1964 | title = A formal theory of inductive inference.

== Controversial aspects of the razor ==
Occam's razor is not an embargo against the positing of any kind of entity, or a recommendation of the simplest theory come what may.{{Refn|"Ockham's razor does not say that the more simple a hypothesis, the better."&lt;ref name=SkepticDict2012&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert T. Carroll |authorlink=Robert Todd Carroll |chapter=Occam's Razor |title=The Skeptic's Dictionary |chapter-url=http://www.skepdic.com/occam.html |postscript=&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Last updated 18 February 2012 |accessdate=2016-02-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301193834/http://www.skepdic.com/occam.html |archivedate=1 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-alpha}} Occam's razor is used to adjudicate between theories that have already passed "theoretical scrutiny" tests and are equally well-supported by evidence.{{Refn|"Today, we think of the principle of parsimony as a heuristic device. We don't assume that the simpler theory is correct and the more complex one false. We know from experience that more often than not the theory that requires more complicated machinations is wrong. Until proved otherwise, the more complex theory competing with a simpler explanation should be put on the back burner, but not thrown onto the trash heap of history until proven false."&lt;ref name="SkepticDict2012" /&gt;|group=lower-alpha}} Furthermore, it may be used to prioritize empirical testing between two equally plausible but unequally testable hypotheses; thereby minimizing costs and wastes while increasing chances of falsification of the simpler-to-test hypothesis.

Another contentious aspect of the razor is that a theory can become more complex in terms of its structure (or [[syntax]]), while its [[ontology]] (or [[semantics]]) becomes simpler, or vice versa.{{Refn|"While these two facets of simplicity are frequently conflated, it is important to treat them as distinct. One reason for doing so is that considerations of parsimony and of elegance typically pull in different directions. Postulating extra entities may allow a theory to be formulated more simply, while reducing the ontology of a theory may only be possible at the price of making it syntactically more complex."&lt;ref name="fn_(109)"/&gt;|group=lower-alpha}} Quine, in a discussion on definition, referred to these two perspectives as "economy of practical expression" and "economy in grammar and vocabulary", respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=W V O|last=Quine|author-link= W. V. Quine|year=1961|chapter=Two dogmas of empiricism|title= From a logical point of view|location=Cambridge|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=20–46|isbn=0-674-32351-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Galileo Galilei]] lampooned the ''misuse'' of Occam's razor in his ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems|Dialogue]]''. The principle is represented in the dialogue by Simplicio. The telling point that Galileo presented ironically was that if one really wanted to start from a small number of entities, one could always consider the letters of the alphabet as the fundamental entities, since one could construct the whole of human knowledge out of them.

== Anti-razors ==
Occam's razor has met some opposition from people who have considered it too extreme or rash. [[Walter Chatton]] (c. 1290–1343) was a contemporary of William of Ockham (c. 1287–1347) who took exception to Occam's razor and Ockham's use of it. In response he devised his own ''anti-razor:'' "If three things are not enough to verify an affirmative proposition about things, a fourth must be added, and so on." Although there have been a number of philosophers who have formulated similar anti-razors since Chatton's time, no one anti-razor has perpetuated in as much notability as Chatton's anti-razor, although this could be the case of the Late Renaissance Italian motto of unknown attribution ''Se non è vero, è ben trovato'' ("Even if it is not true, it is well conceived") when referred to a particularly artful explanation.

Anti-razors have also been created by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] (1646–1716), [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804), and [[Karl Menger]] (1902–1985). Leibniz's version took the form of a [[principle of plenitude]], as [[Arthur Lovejoy]] has called it: the idea being that God created the most varied and populous of possible worlds. Kant felt a need to moderate the effects of Occam's razor and thus created his own counter-razor: "The variety of beings should not rashly be diminished."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Critique of Pure Reason|year=1929|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|url=http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/cpr/toc.html|author=[[Immanuel Kant]]|editor=Norman Kemp-Smith transl|accessdate=27 October 2012|page=92|quote=Entium varietates non temere esse minuendas|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516172030/http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/cpr/toc.html|archivedate=16 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karl Menger found mathematicians to be too parsimonious with regard to variables, so he formulated his Law Against Miserliness, which took one of two forms: "Entities must not be reduced to the point of inadequacy" and "It is vain to do with fewer what requires more." A less serious but (some{{Who|date=May 2015}} might say) even more extremist anti-razor is [['Pataphysics]], the "science of imaginary solutions" developed by [[Alfred Jarry]] (1873–1907). Perhaps the ultimate in anti-reductionism, "'Pataphysics seeks no less than to view each event in the universe as completely unique, subject to no laws but its own." Variations on this theme were subsequently explored by the Argentine writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] in his story/mock-essay "[[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]". There is also [[Crabtree's Bludgeon]], which cynically states that "[n]o set of mutually inconsistent observations can exist for which some human intellect cannot conceive a coherent explanation, however complicated."

'''''One Good Turn: A Natural History of the Screwdriver and the Screw''''' is a book published in 2000 by Canadian [[architecture|architect]], professor and writer [[Witold Rybczynski]].

The idea for the book came in 1999 when an editor at ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' asked Rybczynski to write a short essay on the best and most useful common tool of the previous 1000 years. Rybczynski took the assignment, but as he researched the history of the items in his workshop – hammers and saws, [[spirit level|levels]] and [[plane (tool)|planes]] – he found that most dated well back into antiquity. At the point of giving up, he asked his wife for ideas. She answered: "You always need a screwdriver for something."

Rybczynski discovered that the screwdriver is a relatively new addition to the toolbox, an [[invention]] of the [[Late Middle Ages]] in Europe and the only major mechanical device not independently invented by the Chinese. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] was there at the start, designing a number of screw-cutting machines with interchangeable gears. Nevertheless, it took generations for the screw (and with it, the screwdriver and [[Lathe (tool)|lathe]]) to come into general use, and it was not until modern times that improvements such as slotted screws came into being. Rybczynski spends some time discussing the Canadian invention, the [[Robertson screwdriver]].

'''Orality''' is [[thought]] and verbal expression in societies where the technologies of [[literacy]] (especially writing and print) are unfamiliar to most of the population.  The study of orality is closely allied to the study of [[oral tradition]].  

The term “orality” has been used in a variety of ways, often to describe, in a generalised fashion, the structures of consciousness found in cultures that do not employ, or employ minimally, the technologies of writing. 

[[Walter J. Ong]]’s work was foundational for the study of orality, and reminds us that despite the striking success and subsequent power of written language, the vast majority of languages are never written, and  the basic orality of language is permanent.{{sfn|Cronin|Crosson|Eastlake|2009|p=5}} 

In his later publications Ong distinguishes between two forms of orality: 'primary orality' and 'secondary orality'. Primary orality is thought and expression un-touched by the culture of writing of print; ''[[secondary orality]]'' is explained by Ong as oral culture defined by (implicitly influenced) by the written and printed word, and includes oral culture made possible by technology such as a [[newscaster]] reading a news report on television.

In addition, 'residual orality' is also defined - it is the remnants, legacy, or influence of a predominately oral culture carried over into the written realm - an example might include the use of [[dialogue]] as a philosophical or didactic tool in written literature, such as used by the Greek thinker [[Plato]].

== Origins of philosophy and definition  ==

===Impact of literacy on culture===
Before writing became a way for many [[cultures]] before we had orality. Unfortunately many of the retained orality has been lost or drastically changed. Those that were able to be preserved gives us insight to past cultures and just how much we have evolved since then.&lt;ref&gt;Couch, Carl J. Information Technologies and Social Orders. Transaction Publishers, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Orality and Literacy'' (2nd ed. {{harvnb|Ong|2002}}), Ong sums up his own work over the previous three decades as well as the work of numerous other scholars. With regard to oral tradition and primary orality he  draws on pioneering work by [[Milman Parry]], [[Albert B. Lord]], and [[Eric A. Havelock]]. [[Marshall McLuhan]] was among the first to fully appreciate the significance of the Ong's earlier work about print culture and the [[written and printed word]] as a [[technology]].  In his work ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'' {{harvnb|McLuhan|1962}} McLuhan quotes and discusses works by Ong in the 1950s regarding print culture.{{sfn|McLuhan|1962|pp= 104, 129, 146, 159–60, 162–63, 168, 174–76}}; Orality gave us the stepping stones that allowed us to get where we are today, it was a necessity for the growth of civilization. &lt;ref&gt;Couch, Carl J. Information Technologies and Social Orders. Transaction Publishers, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;But using his own examples to amplify Ong's thought, McLuhan shows how each stage in the development of this technology throughout the [[history of communication]] – from the invention of speech (primary orality), to [[pictograms]],  to the [[Phonetic transcription|phonetic alphabet]], to [[typography]], to the electronic communications of today – restructures human consciousness, profoundly changing not only the frontiers of human possibility, but even the frontiers it is possible for humans to imagine.

===Primary orality===
'Primary orality' refers to thought and its verbal expression within cultures "totally untouched by any knowledge of [[writing]] or [[Printing|print]]."{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=11}}

All [[sound]] is inherently powerful. If a hunter kills a lion he can see it, touch it, feel it and smell it. But if he hears a lion he must act, fast, because the sound of the lion signals its presence and its power. [[Speech communication|Speech]] is a form of sound that shares this common power. Like other sounds, it comes from within a living organism. A text can be ignored; it is just writing on paper. But to ignore speech can be unwise; our basic instincts compel us to pay attention.{{sfn|Ong|2002|p= 32}}

Writing is powerful in a different way: it permits people to generate ideas, store them, and retrieve them as needed across time in a highly efficient and accurate way. The absence of this technology in oral societies limits the development of complex ideas and the [[institution]]s that depend on them. Instead, sustained thought in oral settings depends on interpersonal communication, and storing complex ideas over a long period of time requires packaging them in highly memorable ways, generally by using [[mnemonic]] tools.

In his studies of the [[Homeric Question]], [[Milman Parry]] was able to show that the poetic metre found in the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'' had been 'packaged' by oral [[Greece|Greek]] society to meet its information management needs. These insights first opened the door to a wider appreciation of the sophistication of [[oral tradition]]s, and their various methods of managing information.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| editor-first = Adam | editor-last = Parry | title = The Making of Homeric Verse: The Collected Papers of Milman Parry | publisher = Clarendon Press, Oxford| year = 1971|page = 272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, ancient and medieval mnemonic tools were extensively documented by [[Frances Yates]] in her book ''[[The Art of Memory]]''.{{harv|Yates|1966}}

===Residual orality===
[[File:Socrates Louvre.jpg|thumb|upright|Socrates in Plato's ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', quoting the prophecy of [[Amun|Ammon]] (Thamus) : ''"[Writing] will produce forgetfulness in the minds of those who learn to use it, because they will not practice their memory. [..] You have invented an elixir not of memory, but of reminding; and you offer your pupils the appearance of wisdom, not true wisdom.."'' (trans. H.N. Fowler; Line 275)]]
‘Residual orality’ refers to thought and its verbal expression in cultures that have been exposed to writing and print, but have not fully ‘interiorized’ (in McLuhan’s term) the use of these technologies in their daily lives.  As a culture interiorizes the technologies of literacy, the ‘oral residue’ diminishes.

But the availability of a technology of literacy to a society is not enough to ensure its widespread diffusion and use.  For example, [[Eric Havelock]] observed in ''A Preface to Plato'' that after the [[ancient Greeks]] invented writing they adopted a [[scribe|scribal]] culture that lasted for generations.  Few people, other than the scribes, considered it necessary to learn to read or write.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Havelock | first = Eric A.| title = A Preface to Plato | publisher =  Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts| year =1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other societies, such as [[ancient Egypt]] or [[medieval Europe]], literacy has been a domain confined to political and religious elites.

Many cultures have experienced an equilibrium state in which writing and mass illiteracy have co-existed for hundreds or even thousands of years.{{sfn|Ong|2002|pp= 92–93}}

Oral residue rarely disappears quickly and never vanishes completely.  [[Speech communication|Speech]] is inherently an oral event, based on human relationships, unlike texts.  Oral societies can mount strong resistance to literate technologies, as vividly shown in the arguments of [[Socrates]] against writing in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phaedrus]]''.  Writing, Socrates argues, is inhuman.  It attempts to turn living thoughts dwelling in the [[human mind]] into mere objects in the physical world.  By causing people to rely on what is written rather than what they are able to think, it weakens the powers of the mind and of memory.  True knowledge can only emerge from a relationship between active human minds.  And unlike a person, a text can’t respond to a question; it will just keep saying the same thing over and over again, no matter how often it is refuted.{{sfn|Ong|2002|pp=78–79}}

The Canadian communications scholar, [[Harold Innis]] argued that a balance between the spoken word and writing contributed to the cultural and intellectual vitality of ancient Greece in Plato's time. Plato conveyed his ideas by writing down the conversations of Socrates thus "preserving the power of the spoken word on the written page." [[Aristotle]], Innis wrote, regarded Plato's style as "halfway between poetry and prose." Plato was able to arrive at new philosophical positions "through the use of dialogues, allegories and illustrations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Harold | first = Innis | title = Empire and Communications | location= Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press | year = 1950 | pages = 68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, as McLuhan emphasizes, modernization attenuates some oral capabilities.  For example, in medieval Europe silent reading was largely unknown.  This tilted the readers' attention towards the poetic and other auditory aspects of the text.  Educated modern adults may also occasionally long for something like "the capacious medieval memory, which, untrammeled by the associations of print, could learn a strange language with ease and by the methods of a child, and could retain in memory and reproduce lengthy epic and elaborate lyric poems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=McLuhan|edition=1962| first=H.J. | last =Chaytor | title = From Script to Print|publisher=  Heffer and Sons|location= Cambridge| year= 1945| page = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
McLuhan and Ong also document the apparent re-emergence, in the electronic age, of a kind of '[[secondary orality]]' that displaces written words with audio/visual technologies like [[radio]], [[telephones]], and [[television]].  Unlike primary oral modes of communication, these technologies depend on print for their existence.  Mass Internet collaborations, such as Wikipedia, rely primarily on writing, but re-introduce relationships and responsiveness into the text.

===Importance of the concept===
:''For more details on the social, economic and other effects of literacy or illiteracy see [[Literacy]]''
It has been a habit of literate cultures to view oral cultures simply in terms of their lack of the technologies of writing. This habit, argues Ong, is dangerously misled. Oral cultures are living cultures in their own right. A 1971 study found that of 3,000 extant languages, only 78 had a written [[literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edmonson, Monro E.|title=Lore: An Introduction to the Science of Folklore and Literature|publisher= Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston|location= New York|date= 1971|pages= 323, 332}}&lt;/ref&gt; While literacy extends human possibilities in both thought and action, all literate technologies ultimately depend on the ability of humans to learn oral languages and then translate sound into symbolic imagery.

Understanding between nations may depend to some degree on understanding oral culture. Ong argues that "many of the contrasts often made between 'western' and other views seem reducible to contrasts between deeply interiorized literacy and more or less residually oral states of consciousness."{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=29}}

==Theory of the characteristics of oral culture==
Drawing on hundreds of studies from [[anthropology]], [[linguistics]] and the study of [[oral tradition]], Ong summarizes ten key aspects of the '[[psychodynamics]] of orality'. While these are subject to continuing debate, his list remains an important milestone. Ong draws his examples from both primary oral societies, and societies with a very high 'oral residue'.

===Formulaic styling===
To retain complex ideas requires that they be packaged memorably for easy recall.

:{|style="border:1px; border: thin solid white; background-color:#f6f6FF; margin:20px;" cellpadding="10"
|-
| To solve effectively the problem of retaining and retrieving carefully articulated thought, you have to do your thinking in mnemonic patterns, shaped for ready oral recurrence. Your thoughts must come into being in heavily rhythmic, balanced patterns, in repetitions or antithesis, in alliterations or assonances, in epithetic and other formulary expressions… Serious thought is intertwined with memory systems.{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=34}}
|}

Anthropologist [[Marcel Jousse]] identifies a close linkage between [[rhythm]] and breathing patterns, gestures and the bilateral symmetry of the human body in several ancient verse traditions.{{sfn|Ong|2002|loc=p.34 citing {{harv|Jousse|1978}} }} This synergy between the body and the construction of oral thought further fuels memory.

===Additive rather than subordinative===
Oral cultures avoid complex 'subordinative' clauses. Ong cites an example from the [[Douay-Rheims]] version of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] (1609–10), noting that this basic additive pattern (in ''italics'') has been identified in many oral contexts around the world:{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=37}}

:{|style="border:1px; border: thin solid white; background-color:#f6f6FF; margin:20px;" cellpadding="10"
|-
| In the beginning God created heaven and earth. ''And'' the earth was void and empty, ''and'' darkness was on the face of the deep; ''and'' the spirit of God moved over the waters. ''And'' God said …
|}

Demonstrating how oral modes of communication tend to evolve into literate ones, Ong additionally cites the [[New American Bible]] (1970), which offers a translation that is grammatically far more complex:

:{|style="border:1px; border: thin solid white; background-color:#f6f6FF; margin:20px;" cellpadding="10"
|-
| In the beginning, when God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was a formless wasteland, and darkness covered the abyss, while a mighty wind swept over the waters. Then God said …
|}

===Aggregative rather than analytic===
Oral expression brings words together in pithy phrases that are the product of generations of evolution: the 'sturdy oak tree', the 'beautiful princess' or 'clever Odysseus'. This does not apply specifically to [[poetry]] or [[song]]; rather the words are brought together out of habit during general communication. 'Analyzing' or breaking apart such expressions is risky: they represent the work of generations and "there is nowhere outside the mind to store them."

Ong cites an American example, noting that in some parts of the [[United States]] with heavy oral residue, until the early twentieth-century it was still considered normal or even obligatory to use the adjective ‘glorious’ when referring to the '[[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]]'.{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=39}}

===Redundant or 'copious'===
Speech that repeats earlier thoughts or thought-pictures, or shines a different light on them somehow, helps to keep both the speaker and the listener focused on the topic, and makes it easier for all to recall the key points later. "Oral cultures encourage fluency, fulsomeness, volubility. Rhetoricians were to call this [[Copia: Foundations of the Abundant Style|copia]]"{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=40}}

===Conservative or traditionalist===
Because oral societies have no effective access to writing and print technologies, they must invest considerable energy in basic [[information management]]. Storage of information, being primarily dependent on individual or collective recall, must be handled with particular thrift. It is possible to approximately measure oral residue "from the amount of memorization the culture's educational procedures require."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| editor-first =Jack|editor-last =  Goody| at = introduction, pp.13-14 | title = Literacy in traditional societies | publisher =  Cambridge University Press, Cambridge | year = 1968  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This creates incentives to avoid exploring new ideas and particularly to avoid the burden of having to store them. It does not prevent oral societies from demonstrating dynamism and change, but there is a premium on ensuring that changes cleave to traditional formulas, and "are presented as fitting the traditions of the ancestors."{{sfn|Ong|2002|pp=42}}

===Close to the human lifeworld===
Oral cultures take a practical approach to information storage. To qualify for storage, information must usually concern matters of immediate practical concern or familiarity to most members of the society.

Long after the invention of writing, and often long after the invention of print, basic information on how to perform a society’s most important trades was left unwritten, passed from one generation to the next as it always had been: through [[apprenticeship]], observation and practice.{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=43}}

By contrast, only literary cultures have launched phenomenological analyses, abstract classifications, ordered lists and tables, etc. Nothing analogous exists in oral societies.

===Agonistically toned===
[[File:Beowulf and the dragon.jpg|left|thumb|Beowulf fights the dragon: the oral world is agonistic]]
'Agonistic' means 'combative', but Ong actually advances a deeper thesis with this point. Writing and to an even greater extent print, he argues, disengage humans from direct, interpersonal struggle.

Products of "the highly polarized, agonistic, oral world of good and evil, virtue and vice, villains and heroes," the great works of [[oral literature]] from [[Homer]] to [[Beowulf]], from the [[Mwindo epic]] to the [[Old Testament]], are extremely violent by modern standards. They are also punctuated by frequent and intense intellectual combat and tongue-lashings on the one hand, and effusive praise (perhaps reaching its height among [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] [[griot|praise singers]]) on the other.{{sfn|Ong|2002|pp=43–45}}

===Empathetic and participatory===
In an oral culture the most reliable and trusted technique for learning is to share a "close, empathetic, communal association" with others who know.

Ong cites a study of community decision-making from 12th Century [[England]]. Writing already had a long history in England, and it would have been possible to use texts to establish for example, the age of majority of the heir to an estate. But people were skeptical about texts, noting not only the cost of generating and managing them, but the problems involved in preventing tampering or frauds.

As a result, they retained the traditional solution: gathering together "mature wise seniors of many years, having good testimony", and publicly discussing the age of the heir with them, until agreement was reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first = M.T. |last = Clanchy | title = From Memory to Written Record, England 1066–1307 | publisher =  Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts | year =  1979 | pages = 230–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hallmark principle of orality, that truth emerges best from communal process, resonates today in the [[jury]] system.

===Homeostatic===
Oral societies conserve their limited capacity to store information, and retain the relevance of their information to the interest of their present members, by shedding memories that have lost their past significance.{{sfn|Goody|Watt|1968|pp=31–34}}

While many examples exist, the classic example was reported by {{harvnb|Goody|Watt|1968}}. Written records prepared by the British in [[Ghana]] in the early 1900s show that [[Ndewura Jakpa]], the seventeenth century founder of the state of the [[Gonja people]], had seven sons, each of whom ruled a territorial division within the state. Six decades later two of the divisions had disappeared for various reasons. The myths of the Gonja had been revised to recount that Jakpa had five sons, and that five divisions were created.{{sfn|Goody|Watt|1968|p=33}} Since they had no practical, present purpose, the other two sons and divisions had evaporated.

===Situational rather than abstract===
In oral cultures, concepts are used in a way that minimizes abstraction, focusing to the greatest extent possible on objects and situations directly known by the speaker. A study by [[Alexander Luria]], a psychologist who did extensive fieldwork comparing oral and literate subjects in remote areas of [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Kirghizia]] in 1931–2&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first = Aleksandr Romanovich | last = Luria | title = Cognitive Development: Its Social and Cultural Foundations| editor-first = Michael |editor-last = Cole| translator-first =Martin | translator-last = Lopez-Morillas |translator-first2 = Lynn | translator-last2= Solotaroff |publisher = Harvard University Press. Cambridge, Massachusetts, and London| year = 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; documented the highly situational nature of oral thinking.

* Oral subjects always used real objects they were familiar with to refer to geometric shapes; for example a plate or the moon might be used to refer to a circle.
* Asked to select three similar words from the following list "hammer, saw, log, hatchet", oral subjects would reject the literate solution (removing the log to produce a list of 3 tools), pointing out that without the log there wasn't much use for the tools.
* Oral subjects took a practical, not an abstract, approach to syllogisms. Luria asked them this question. ''In the far north, where there is snow, all bears are white. Novaya Zemlya is in the far north and there is always snow there. What colour are the bears?'' Typical response: "I don't know. I've seen a black bear. I've never seen any others. … Every locality has its own animals."
* Oral subjects proved unwilling to analyze themselves. When asked "what sort of person are you?" one responded: "What can I say about my own heart? How can I talk about my character? Ask others; they can tell you about me. I myself can’t say anything."{{sfn|Ong|2002|pp=49–54}}

In botany, the phrase '''''ordo naturalis''''', "natural order", was once used for what today is a [[family (biology)|family]]. Its origins lie with [[Carl Linnaeus]] who used the word when he referred to natural groups of plants in his lesser-known work, particularly ''[[Philosophia Botanica]]''. In his more famous works the ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' and the ''[[Species Plantarum]]'', plants were arranged according to his artificial "Sexual system", and Linnaeus used the word "ordo" for an artificial unit. In those works, only genera and species (sometimes varieties) were "real" [[taxa]].

In nineteenth-century works such as the ''[[de Candolle system|Prodromus]]'' of de Candolle and the ''[[Bentham &amp; Hooker system|Genera Plantarum]]'' of Bentham &amp; Hooker, the word ''ordo'' did indicate taxa that are now given the rank of family. Contemporary French works used the word "famille" for these same taxa.  In the first international ''Rules'' of [[botanical nomenclature]] of 1906 the word family (''familia'') was assigned to this rank, while the term "order" (''ordo'') was reserved for a higher rank, for what in the nineteenth century had often been named a ''cohors'' (plural ''cohortes'').

The ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' provides for names published in the rank of ''ordo naturalis'' in Art 18.2: normally, these are to be accepted as family names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012 |volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011 |publisher=A.R.G.

Some plant families retain the name they were given by pre-Linnaean authors, recognised by Linnaeus as "natural orders" (e.g. ''[[Palmae]]'' or ''[[Labiatae]]''). Such names are known as [[Descriptive botanical names|descriptive]] family names.

'''Palaeography''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#Simplification of ae and oe|UK]]) or '''paleography''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#Simplification of ae and oe|US]]; ultimately from {{lang-grc-gre|{{linktext|παλαιός}}}}, ''palaiós'', "old", and {{lang|grc|{{linktext|γράφειν}}}}, ''graphein'', "to write") is the study of ancient and historical [[handwriting]] (that is to say, of the forms and processes of writing; not the textual content of documents). Included in the discipline is the practice of deciphering, reading, and dating historical manuscripts,&lt;ref&gt;'Palaeography', ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the cultural context of writing, including the methods with which writing and books were produced, and the history of [[Scriptorium|scriptoria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://civiceducationproject.org/legacy/projects/paleography/index.html |title=Latin Palaeography Network |publisher=Civiceducationproject.org |date= |accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discipline is important for understanding, authenticating, and dating ancient texts. However, it cannot in general be used to pinpoint dates with high precision.

== Application ==
Palaeography can be an essential skill for [[historian]]s and [[philology|philologists]], as it tackles two main difficulties. First, since the style of a single [[alphabet]] in each given language has evolved constantly, it is necessary to know how to decipher its individual characters as they existed in various eras. Second, [[scribe]]s often used many [[abbreviation]]s, usually so as to write more quickly and sometimes to save space, so the specialist-palaeographer must know how to interpret them. Knowledge of individual [[Letterform|letter-forms]], [[Typographic ligature|ligatures]], [[punctuation]], and [[abbreviation]]s enables the palaeographer to read and understand the text. The palaeographer must know, first, the language of the text (that is, one must become expert in the relevant earlier forms of these languages); and second, the historical usages of various styles of handwriting, common writing customs, and scribal or [[notary|notarial]] abbreviations. [[Philology|Philological knowledge]] of the language, vocabulary, and grammar generally used at a given time or place can help palaeographers identify ancient or more recent [[forgeries]] versus authentic documents.

Knowledge of [[writing material]]s is also essential to the study of handwriting and to the identification of the periods in which a document or manuscript may have been produced.&lt;ref name=fn_3&gt;Robert P. Gwinn, "Paleography" in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], [[Micropædia]], Vol. IX, 1986, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; An important goal may be to assign the text a date and a place of origin: this is why the palaeographer must take into account the style and formation of the manuscript and the handwriting used in it.&lt;ref name=fn_4&gt;Fernando De Lasala, ''Exercise of Latin Paleography'' ([[Pontifical Gregorian University|Gregorian University of Rome]], 2006) p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Document dating ===
Palaeography can be used to provide information about the date at which a document was written. However, "paleography is a last resort for dating" and, "for book hands, a period of 50 years is the least acceptable spread of time"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Turner |first=Eric G. |year=1987 |title=Greek Manuscripts of the Ancient World |edition=2nd |place=London |publisher=Institute of Classical Studies }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nongbri24"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://people.uncw.edu/zervosg/papyrology/nongbri%20p52%20misuse.pdf |last=Nongbri |first=Brent |year=2005 |title=The Use and Abuse of P52: Papyrological Pitfalls in the Dating of the Fourth Gospel |journal=Harvard Theological Review |volume=98 |pages=23–48 (24) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216200012/http://people.uncw.edu/zervosg/papyrology/nongbri%20p52%20misuse.pdf |archivedate=16 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with it being suggested that "the 'rule of thumb' should probably be to avoid dating a hand more precisely than a range of at least seventy or eighty years".&lt;ref name="nongbri24" /&gt; In a 2005 e-mail addendum to his 1996 "The Paleographical Dating of P-46" paper Bruce W. Griffin stated "Until more rigorous methodologies are developed, it is difficult to construct a 95% confidence interval for [[New Testament|NT]] manuscripts without allowing a century for an assigned date."&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, Bruce W.

== Aramaic palaeography ==
[[File:Mandaic Alphabet.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Table showing the [[Mandaic alphabet]] (Abagada) with some of the mysteries represented by the letters]]

The [[Aramaic language]] was the international trade language of the [[Ancient Middle East]], originating in what is modern-day [[Syria]], between 1000 and 600&amp;nbsp;BC. It spread from the [[Mediterranean coast]] to the borders of [[India]], becoming extremely popular and being adopted by many people, both with or without any previous writing system. The [[Aramaic script]] was written in a [[Abjad|consonantal form]] with a direction from right to left. The [[Aramaic alphabet]], a modified form of [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]], was the ancestor of the [[Arabic alphabet|modern Arabic]] and [[Hebrew script]]s, as well as the [[Brāhmī script]], the parent writing system of most modern [[abugida]]s in [[India]], [[Southeast Asia]], [[Tibet]], and [[Mongolia]]. Initially, the Aramaic script did not differ from the Phoenician, but then the [[Aramaeans]] simplified some of the letters, thickened and rounded their lines: a specific feature of its letters is the distinction between '''d''' and '''r'''. One innovation in Aramaic is the ''[[matres lectionis]]'' system to indicate certain vowels. Early Phoenician-derived scripts did not have letters for vowels, and so most texts recorded just consonants. Most likely as a consequence of phonetic changes in North Semitic languages, the Aramaeans reused certain letters in the alphabet to represent long vowels. The letter ''[[aleph]]'' was employed to write /'''ā'''/, ''he'' for /'''ō'''/, ''yod'' for /'''ī'''/, and ''vav'' for /'''ū'''/.

Aramaic writing and language supplanted [[Babylonian language|Babylonian]] [[cuneiform]] and [[Akkadian language]], even in their homeland in [[Mesopotamia]]. The wide diffusion of Aramaic letters led to its writing being used not only in monumental inscriptions, but also on [[papyrus]] and [[potsherds]]. Aramaic papyri have been found in large numbers in Egypt, especially at [[Elephantine papyri|Elephantine]]—among them are official and private documents of the [[Jewish military history|Jewish military settlement]] in 5&amp;nbsp;BC. In the Aramaic papyri and potsherds, words are separated usually by a small gap, as in modern writing. At the turn of the 3rd to 2nd centuries BC, the heretofore uniform Aramaic letters developed new forms, as a result of dialectal and political fragmentation in several subgroups. The most important of these is the so-called [[Hebrew square script|square Hebrew block script]], followed by [[Palmyrene dialect|Palmyrene]], [[Nabataean alphabet|Nabataean]], and the much later [[Syriac script]].

Aramaic is usually divided into three main parts:&lt;ref name="Bey" /&gt;
# Old Aramaic (in turn subdivided into Ancient, Imperial, Old Eastern and Old Western Aramaic)
# Middle Aramaic, and
# Modern Aramaic of the present day.

The term Middle Aramaic refers to the form of Aramaic which appears in pointed texts and is reached in the 3rd century AD with the loss of short unstressed vowels in open syllables, and continues until the triumph of [[Arabic]].

Old Aramaic appeared in the 11th century BC as the official language of the first [[Syro-Hittite states|Aramaean states]]. The oldest witnesses to it are inscriptions from northern [[Syria]] of the 10th to 8th centuries BC, especially extensive state treaties (c. 750 BC) and royal inscriptions. The early Old Ancient should be classified as "Ancient Aramaic" and consists of two clearly distinguished and standardised written languages, the Early Ancient Aramaic and the Late Ancient Aramaic. Aramaic was influenced at first principally by [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], then from the 5th century BC by [[Persian language|Persian]] and from the 3rd century BC onwards by [[Greek language|Greek]], as well as by [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], especially in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].&lt;ref name="Bey"&gt;Cf. Klaus Beyer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pZ53zpMQNLEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Aramaic Language''], Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1986, pp. 9- 15; Rainer Degen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nrRcQwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Altaramäische Grammatik der Inschriften des 10-8 Jh.v.Chr.''], [[Wiesbaden]], repr. 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; As Aramaic evolved into the imperial language of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], the script used to write it underwent a change into something more cursive. The best examples of this script come from documents written on papyrus from Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;This script was also used during the reign of King [[Ashoka]] in his edicts to spread early [[Buddhism]]. Cf. [http://www.ancientscripts.com/aramaic.html "Ancient Scripts: Aramaic"]. Accessed 05/04/2013&lt;/ref&gt; About 500 BC, [[Darius I]] (522–486) made the Aramaic used by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid imperial administration]] into the official language of the western half of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]]. This so-called "Imperial Aramaic" (the oldest dated example, from Egypt, belonging to 495 BC) is based on an otherwise unknown written form of Ancient Aramaic from [[Babylonia]]. In orthography, Imperial Aramaic preserves historical forms—[[alphabet]], [[orthography]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[pronunciation]], [[vocabulary]], [[syntax]] and [[Style (sociolinguistics)|style]] are highly standardised. Only the formularies of the private documents and the [[Ahiqar|Proverbs of Ahiqar]] have maintained an older tradition of sentence structure and style. Imperial Aramaic immediately replaced Ancient Aramaic as a written language and, with slight modifications, it remained the official, commercial and literary language of the [[Near East]] until gradually, beginning with the fall of the Persian Empire (331 BC) and ending in the 4th century AD, it was replaced by Greek, Persian, the eastern and western dialects of Aramaic and Arabic, though not without leaving its traces in the written form of most of these. In its original Achaemenid form, Imperial Aramaic is found in texts of the 5th to 3rd centuries BC. These come mostly from Egypt and especially from the [[Jewish temple at Elephantine#Jewish temple at Elephantine|Jewish military colony]] of [[Elephantine]], which existed at least from 530 to 399 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Cf.

== Greek palaeography ==
{{See also|History of the Greek alphabet}}

A history of Greek handwriting must be incomplete owing to the fragmentary nature of evidence. If one rules out the inscriptions on stone or metal, which belong to the science of {{small caps|[[epigraphy]]}}, we are practically dependent for the period preceding the 4th or 5th century AD on the [[papyri]] from [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] (cf. {{small caps|[[papyrology]]}}), the earliest of which take back our knowledge only to the end of the 4th century BC. This limitation is less serious than might appear, since the few [[manuscript]]s not of Egyptian origin which have survived from this period, like the parchments from [[Avroman]]&lt;ref&gt;Cf. E. H. Minns, ''Journ. of Hell. Stud.'', xxxv, pp.22ff.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Dura, Hebron|Dura]],&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''New Pal. Soc.'', ii, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Herculaneum papyri]], and a few documents found in Egypt but written elsewhere, reveal a uniformity of style in the various portions of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek world]]; but some differences can be discerned, and it is probable that, were there more material, distinct local styles could be traced.&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;In creating and expanding the following sections on {{small caps|Greek palaeography}}—inclusive of the "Vellum and Paper Manuscripts" subsection—specialist sources have been consulted and thoroughly perused for the relevant text and citations, as follows: primarily the article on ''general palaeography'' by renowned [[United Kingdom|British]] [[papyrology|papyrologist]] and scholar Sir [[Harold Idris Bell]], present in  {{cite EB1911|wstitle=Palaeography#Greek Writing I|display=Palaeography § Greek Writing}} |volume=20 |pages=557–567}}&lt;!--|url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopdiabri20chis#page/557/mode/1up--&gt; – now in the [[public domain]]; [[Barry B.

These texts will be referred to throughout the present article with relevant inline citations.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, any given period several types of hand may exist together. There was a marked difference between the hand used for literary works (generally called "[[uncials]]" but, in the [[papyrus]] period, better styled "book-hand") and that of documents ("[[cursive]]") and within each of these classes several distinct styles were employed side by side; and the various types are not equally well represented in the surviving papyri.

The development of any hand is largely influenced by the materials used. To this general rule the Greek script is no exception. Whatever may have been the period at which the use of papyrus or leather as a writing material began in Greece (and papyrus was employed in the 5th century BC), it is highly probable that for some time after the introduction of the [[alphabet]] the characters were incised with a sharp tool on stones or metal far oftener than they were written with a pen. In cutting a hard surface, it is easier to form angles than curves; in writing the reverse is the case; hence the development of writing was from angular letters ("capitals") inherited from [[epigraphy|epigraphic style]] to rounded ones ("uncials"). But only certain letters were affected by this development, in particular '''E''' (uncial '''ε'''), '''Σ''' ('''c'''), '''Ω''' ('''ω'''), and to a lesser extent '''A''' ('''α''').

=== Ptolemaic period ===
[[File:P.Berol. inv. 9875 col. v coronis.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of the [[Berlin]] papyrus 9875 showing the 5th column of [[Timotheus of Miletus|Timotheus']] ''Persae'', with a [[Coronis (textual symbol)|coronis]] symbol to mark the end.]]

The earliest Greek papyrus yet discovered is probably that containing the ''Persae'' of [[Timotheus of Miletus|Timotheus]], which dates from the second half of the 4th century BC and its script has a curiously archaic appearance. '''E''', '''Σ''', and '''Ω''' have the capital form, and apart from these test letters the general effect is one of stiffness and angularity.&lt;ref&gt;Fragments of Timotheus' poetry survive, published in T. Bergk, ''Poetae lyrici graeci''. The cit. papyrus-fragment of his ''Persae (Persians)'' was discovered at [[Abusir]] and has been edited by [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff]], ''Der Timotheos-Papyrus gefunden bei Abusir am 1. Februar 1902'', Leipzig: Hinrichs (1903), with content discussion. Cf. V. Strazzulla, ''Persiani di Eschilo ed il nomo di Timoteo'' (1904); S. Sudhaus in ''Rhein. Mus.'', iviii. (1903), p. 481; and T. Reinach and M. Croiset in ''Revue des etudes grecques'', xvi. (1903), pp. 62, 323.&lt;/ref&gt; More striking is the hand of the earliest dated papyrus, a contract of 311 BC. Written with more ease and elegance, it shows little trace of any development towards a truly [[cursive]] style; the letters are not linked, and though the uncial '''c''' is used throughout, '''E''' and '''Ω''' have the capital forms. A similar impression is made by the few other papyri, chiefly literary, dating from about 300 BC; '''E''' may be slightly rounded, '''Ω''' approach the uncial form, and the angular '''Σ''' occurs as a letter only in the Timotheus papyrus, though it survived longer as a numeral (= 200), but the hands hardly suggest that for at least a century and a half the art of writing on papyrus had been well established. Yet before the middle of the 3rd century BC, one finds both a practised book-hand and a developed and often remarkably handsome cursive.

These facts may be due to accident, the few early papyri happening to represent an archaic style which had survived along with a more advanced one; but it is likely that there was a rapid development at this period, due partly to the opening of Egypt, with its supplies of papyri, and still more to the establishment of the great [[Alexandrian Library]], which systematically copied literary and scientific works, and to the multifarious activities of [[Hellenistic]] bureaucracy. From here onward, the two types of script were sufficiently distinct (though each influenced the other) to require separate treatment. Some literary papyri, like the roll containing [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Constitution of Athens]]'', were written in cursive hands, and, conversely, the book-hand was occasionally used for documents. Since the scribe did not date literary rolls, such papyri are useful in tracing the development of the book-hand.&lt;ref name="Bell" /&gt;

The documents of the mid-3rd century BC show a great variety of [[cursive]] hands. There are none from chancelleries of the Hellenistic monarchs, but some letters, notably those of [[Apollonius of Rhodes|Apollonius]], the finance minister of [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy II]], to this agent, Zeno, and those of the Palestianian sheikh, Toubias, are in a type of script which cannot be very unlike the [[Chancery hand]] of the time, and show the Ptolemaic cursive at its best. These hands have a noble spaciousness and strength, and though the individual letters are by no means uniform in size there is a real unity of style, the general impression being one of breadth and uprightness. '''H''', with the cross-stroke high, '''Π''', '''Μ''', with the middle stroke reduced to a very shallow curve, sometimes approaching a horizontal line, '''Υ''', and '''Τ''', with its cross-bar extending much further to the left than to the right of the up-stroke, '''Γ''' and '''Ν''', whose last stroke is prolonged upwards above the line, often curving backwards, are all broad; '''ε''', '''c''', '''θ''' and '''β''', which sometimes takes the form of two almost perpendicular strokes joined only at the top, are usually small; '''ω''' is rather flat, its second loop reduced to a practically straight line. Partly by the broad flat tops of the larger letters, partly by the insertion of a stroke connecting those (like H, Υ) which are not naturally adapted to linking, the scribes produced the effect of a horizontal line along the top of the writing, from which the letters seem to hang. This feature is indeed a general characteristic of the more formal Ptolemaic script, but it is specially marked in the 3rd century BC.

[[File:The Derveni Papyrus.jpg|thumb|The [[Derveni Papyrus]], a Greek Macedonian philosophical text dating around 340 BC, considered Europe's oldest manuscript]]

Besides these hand of Chancery type, there are numerous less elaborate examples of cursive, varying according to the writer's skill and degree of education, and many of them strikingly easy and handsome.{{According to whom|date=April 2013}} In some cursiveness is carried very far, the linking of letters reaching the point of illegibility, and the characters sloping to the right. '''A''' is reduced to a mere acute angle (&lt;big&gt;'''∠'''&lt;/big&gt;), '''T''' has the cross-stroke only on the left, '''ω''' becomes an almost straight line, '''H''' acquires a shape somewhat like &lt;big&gt;h&lt;/big&gt;, and the last stroke of '''N''' is extended far upwards and at times flattened out until it is little more than a diagonal stroke to the right. The attempt to secure a horizontal line along the top is here abandoned. This style was not due to inexpertness, but to the desire for speed, being used especially in accounts and drafts, and was generally the work of practised writers. How well established the cursive hand had now become is shown in some wax tablets of this period, the writing on which, despite the difference of material, closely resemble the hands of papyri.&lt;ref&gt;Wax tablets of this period are preserved at the [[University College London]], cf. ''Speaking in the Wax Tablets of Memory'', Agocs, PA (2013). In: Castagnoli, L. and Ceccarelli, P, (eds.), Cambridge University Press: Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Documents of the late 3rd and early 2nd centuries BC show, perhaps partly by the accident of survival (there is nothing analogous to the Apollonius letters, a loss of breadth and spaciousness. In the more formal types the letters stand rather stiffly upright, often without the linking strokes, and are more uniform in size; in the more cursive they are apt to be packed closely together. These features are more marked in the hands of the 2nd century. The less cursive often show am approximation to the book-hand, the letters growing rounder and less angular than in the 3rd century; in the more cursive linking was carried further, both by the insertion of coupling strokes and by the writing of several letters continuously without raising the pen, so that before the end of the century an almost current hand was evolved. A characteristic letter, which survived into the early Roman period, is '''T''', with its cross-stroke made in two portions (variants:[[File:Greek cursive variants Tau.svg|70px]]). In the 1st century, the hand tended, so far as can be inferred from surviving examples, to disintegrate; one can recognise the signs which portend a change of style, irregularity, want of direction, and the loss of the feeling for style. A fortunate accident has preserved two Greek [[parchment]]s written in [[Parthia]], one dated 88 BC, in a practically unligatured hand, the other, 22/21 BC, in a very cursive script of Ptolemaic type; and though each has non-Egyptian features the general character indicates a uniformity of style in the Hellenistic world.&lt;ref name="Bell" /&gt;

The development of the Ptolemaic book-hand is difficult to trace, as there are few examples, mostly not datable on external grounds. Only for the 3rd century BC have we a secure basis. The hands of that period have an angular appearance; there is little uniformity in the size of individual letters, and though sometimes, notably in the [[Flinders Petrie|Petrie papyrus]] containing the ''[[Phaedo]]'' of [[Plato]], a style of considerable delicacy is attained, the book-hand in general shows less mastery than the contemporary cursive. In the 2nd century the letters grew rounder and more uniform in size, but in the 1st century there is perceptible, here as in the cursive hand, a certain disintegration. Probably at no time did the Ptolemaic book-hand acquire such unity of stylistic effect as the cursive.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Lewis Campbell, "On the Text of the Papyrus Fragment of the Phaedo", ''Classical Review'', Volume 5, Issue 10, December 1891, pp. 454–457, [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=3766440 published online: 27 October 2009].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roman period ===
[[File:HARRIS HOMER - 1st CENTURY B.C..JPG|thumb|left|Greek papyrus with [[Homer]]'s verses, 1st century BC]]

Papyri of the Roman period are far more numerous and show greater variety. The cursive of the 1st century has a rather broken appearance, part of one character being often made separately from the rest and linked to the next letter. A form characteristic of the 1st and 2nd century and surviving after that only as a fraction sign (=&lt;big&gt;⅛&lt;/big&gt;) is '''η''' in the shape [[File:Hand 2 sample q.png|20px]]. By the end of the 1st century, there had been developed several excellent types of cursive, which, though differing considerably both in the forms of individual letters and in general appearance, bear a family likeness to one another. Qualities which are specially noticeable are roundness in the shape of letters, continuity of formation, the pen being carried on from character to character, and regularity, the letters not differing strikingly in size and projecting strokes above or below the line being avoided. Sometimes, especially in tax-receipts and in stereotyped formulae, cursiveness is carried to an extreme. In a letter of the prefect, dated in 209, we have a fine example of the [[Chancery hand]], with tall and laterally compressed letters, '''ο''' very narrow and '''α''' and '''ω''' often written high in the line. This style, from at least the latter part of the 2nd century, exercised considerable influence on the local hands, many of which show the same characteristics less pronounced; and its effects may be traced into the early part of the 4th century. Hands of the 3rd century uninfluenced by it show a falling off from the perfection of the 2nd century; stylistic uncertainty and a growing coarseness of execution mark a period of decline and transition.

Several different types of book-hand were used in the Roman period. Particularly handsome{{According to whom|date=April 2013}} is a round, upright hand seen, for example, in a [[British Museum]] papyrus containing ''[[Odyssey]]'' III. The cross-stroke of '''ε''' is high, '''Μ''' deeply curved and '''Α''' has the form '''α'''. Uniformity of size is well attained, and a few strokes project, and these but slightly, above or below the line. Another type, well called by palaeographer Schubart the "severe" style, has a more angular appearance and not infrequently slopes to the right; though handsome, it has not the sumptuous appearance of the former.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Wilhelm Schubart, ''Griechische Palaeographie'', C.H. Beck, 1925, vol. i, pt. 4; also 1st half of new ed. of Muller's ''Handbuch der Altertumswissenschaft''; and Schubart's ''Das Buch bei den Griechen und Römern'' (2nd ed.); ''ibid.'', ''Papyri Graecae Berolinenses'' (Boon, 1921).&lt;/ref&gt; There are various classes of a less pretentious style, in which convenience rather than beauty was the first consideration and no pains were taken to avoid irregularities in the shape and alignment of the letters. Lastly may be mentioned a hand which is of great interest as being the ancestor of the type called (from its later occurrence in [[vellum]] codices of the [[Bible]]) the biblical hand. This, which can be traced back at least the late 2nd century, has a square, rather heavy appearance; the letters, of uniform size, stand upright, and thick and thin strokes are well distinguished. In the 3rd century the book-hand, like the cursive, appears to have deteriorated in regularity and stylistic accomplishment.

In the charred rolls found at [[Herculaneum]] and dating from about the beginning of our era, are specimens of Greek literary hands from outside Egypt; and a comparison with the Egyptian papyri reveals great similarity in style and shows that conclusions drawn from the henads of Egypt may, with caution, be applied to the development of writing in the Greek world generally.

=== Byzantine period ===
{{See also|Byzantine text-type}}
[[File:Codex Alexandrinus 1 Tim 3,16.jpg|thumb|left|Section of the [[Codex Alexandrinus]], the oldest Greek witness of the Byzantine text in the [[Gospels]].]]
The cursive hand of the 4th century shows some uncertainty of character. Side by side with the style founded on the [[Chancery hand]], regular in formation and with tall and narrow letters, which characterised the period of [[Diocletian]], and lasted well into the century, we find many other types mostly marked by a certain looseness and irregularity. A general progress towards a florid and sprawling hand is easily recognisable, but a consistent and deliberate style was hardly evolved before the 5th century, from which unfortunately few dated documents have survived. [[Byzantine text-type|Byzantine]] cursive tends to an exuberant hand, in which the long strokes are excessively extended and individual letters often much enlarged. But not a few hands of the 5th and 6th centuries are truly handsome and show considerable technical accomplishment. Both an upright and a sloping type occur and there are many less ornamental hands, but there gradually emerged towards the 7th century two general types, one (especially used in letters and contracts) a current hand, sloping to the right, with long strokes in such characters at '''τ''', '''ρ''', '''ξ''', '''η''' (which has the &lt;big&gt;h&lt;/big&gt; shape), '''ι''', and '''κ''', and with much linking of letters, and another (frequent in accounts), which shows, at least in essence, most of the forms of the later minuscule. (cf. [[#Minuscule Hand|below]].) This is often upright, though a slope to the right is quite common, and sometimes, especially in one or two documents of the early [[Arabic alphabet|Arab]] period, it has an almost [[calligraphy|calligraphic]] effect.

In the Byzantine period, the book-hand, which in earlier times had more than once approximated to the contemporary cursive, diverged widely from it.&lt;ref name="Bell" /&gt;

=== Vellum and paper manuscripts ===
The change from papyrus to [[vellum]] involved no such modification in the forms of letters as followed that from metal to papyrus. The justification for considering the two materials separately is that after the general adoption of vellum, the Egyptian evidence is first supplemented and later superseded by that of [[manuscript]]s from elsewhere, and that during this period the hand most used was one not previously employed for literary purposes.

==== Uncial hand ====
{{See also|Uncial script}}
{{double image|right|Codex Vaticanus B, 2Thess. 3,11-18, Hebr. 1,1-2,2.jpg|160|Codex Marchalianus Pg 71.JPG|160|Pages from [[Codex Vaticanus]] (left) and [[Codex Marchalianus]] (right)}}

The prevailing type of book-hand during what in [[papyrology]] is called the Byzantine period, that is, roughly from AD 300 to 650, is known as the biblical hand. It went back to at least the end of the 2nd century and had had originally no special connection with [[Christian literature]]. In [[manuscript]]s, whether vellum or paper, of the 4th century found in Egypt are met other forms of script, particularly a sloping, rather inelegant hand derived from the literary hand of the 3rd century, which persisted to at least the 5th century; but the three great early codices of the Bible are all written in uncials of the biblical type. In the [[Codex Vaticanus|Vaticanus]], placed in the 4th century, the characteristics of the hand are least strongly marked; the letters have the forms characteristic of the type but without the heavy appearance of later manuscripts, and the general impression is one of greater roundness. In the [[Sinaiticus]], which is not much later, the letters are larger and more heavily made; and in the [[Alexandrinus]] (5th century) a later development is seen, with emphatic distinction of thick and thin strokes. By the 6th century, alike in vellum and in papyrus manuscripts, the heaviness had become very marked, though the hand still retained, in its best examples, a handsome appearance; but after this it steadily deteriorated, becoming ever more mechanical and artificial. The thick strokes grew heavier; the cross strokes of '''T''' and '''Θ''' and the base of '''Δ''' were furnished with drooping spurs. The hand, which is often singularly ugly, passed through various modifications, now sloping, now upright, though it is not certain that these variations were really successive rather than concurrent. A different type of uncials, derived from the [[Chancery hand]] and seen in two papyrus examples of the Festal letters despatched annually by the [[Patriarch of Alexandria]], was occasionally used, the best known example being the [[Codex Marchalianus]] (6th or 7th century). A combination of this hand with the other type is also known.

==== Minuscule hand ====
The uncial hand lingered on, mainly for liturgical manuscripts, where a large and easily legible script was serviceable, as late as the 12th century, but in ordinary use it had long been superseded by a new type of hand, the [[Greek minuscule|minuscule]], which originated in the 8th century, as an adaptation to literary purposes of the second of the types of Byzantine cursive mentioned above. A first attempt at a calligraphic use of this hand, seen in one or two manuscripts of the 8th or early 9th century,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. P.F. de' Cavalieri &amp; J. Lietzmann, ''Specimina Codicum Graecorum Vaticanorum'' No. 5, Bonn, 1910; G. Vitelli &amp; C. Paoli, ''Collezione fiorentina di facsimili paleografici'', Florence (rist. 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; in which it slopes to the right and has a narrow, angular appearance, did not find favour, but by the end of the 9th century a more ornamental type, from which modern Greek script descended, was already established. It has been suggested that it was evolved in the [[Monastery of Stoudios]] at [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. T.W. Allen, "Notes on Abbreviations in Greek Manuscripts", ''Joun. Hell. Stud.'', xl, pp. 1–12.&lt;/ref&gt; In its earliest examples it is upright and exact but lacks flexibility; accents are small, [[Greek diacritics|breathings]] square in formation, and in general only such [[Typographic ligature|ligatures]] are used as involve no change in the shape of letters. The single forms have a general resemblance (with considerable differences in detail) both to the minuscule cursive of late papyri, and to those used in modern Greek type; uncial forms were avoided.

In the course of the 10th century the hand, without losing its beauty and exactness, gained in freedom. Its finest period was from the 9th to the 12th century,{{According to whom|date=April 2013}} after which it rapidly declined. The development was marked by a tendency
# to the intrusion, in growing quantity, of uncial forms which good scribes could fit into the line without disturbing the unity of style but which, in less expert hands, had a disintegrating effect;
# to the disproportionate enlargement of single letters, especially at the beginnings and ends of lines;
# to ligatures, often very fantastic, which quite changed the forms of letters;
# to the enlargement of accents, breathings at the same time acquiring the modern rounded form.
But from the first there were several styles, varying from the formal, regular hands characteristic of service books to the informal style, marked by numerous abbreviations, used in manuscripts intended only for a scholar's private use. The more formal hands were exceedingly conservative, and there are few classes of script more difficult to date than the Greek minuscule of this class. In the 10th, 11th and 12th centuries a sloping hand, less dignified than the upright, formal type, but often very handsome, was especially used for manuscripts of the classics.

Hands of the 11th century are marked in general (though there are exceptions) by a certain grace and delicacy, exact but easy; those of the 12th by a broad, bold sweep and an increasing freedom, which readily admits uncial forms, ligatures and enlarged letters but has not lost the sense of style and decorative effect. In the 13th and still more in the 14th centuries there was a steady decline; the less formal hands lost their beauty and exactness, becoming ever more disorderly and chaotic in their effect, while formal style imitated the precision of an earlier period without attaining its freedom and naturalness, and often appears singularly lifeless. In the 15th century, especially in the West, where Greek scribes were in request to produce manuscripts of the classical authors, there was a revival, and several manuscripts of this period, though markedly inferior to those of the 11th and 12th centuries, are by no means without beauty.

=== Accents, punctuation, and division of words ===
[[File:Paragraphos.png|thumb|Variants of [[paragraphos]]]]
{{See also|Punctuation}}
In the book-hand of early papyri, neither accents nor breathings were employed. Their use was established by the beginning of the Roman period, but was sporadic in papyri, where they were used as an aid to understanding, and therefore more frequently in poetry than prose, and in lyrical oftener than in other verse. In the cursive of papyri they are practically unknown, as are marks of punctuation. Punctuation was effected in early papyri, literary and documentary, by spaces, reinforced in the book-hand by the [[paragraphos]], a horizontal stroke under the beginning of the line. The [[Coronis (textual symbol)|coronis]], a more elaborate form of this, marked the beginning of lyrics or the principal sections of a longer work. Punctuation marks, the [[comma]], the high, low and middle points, were established in the book-hand by the Roman period; in early Ptolemaic papyri, a double point (''':''') is found.

In vellum and paper manuscripts, punctuation marks and accents were regularly used from at least the 8th century, though with some differences from modern practice. At no period down to the invention of printing did Greek scribes consistently separate words. The book-hand of papyri aimed at an unbroken succession of letters, except for distinction of sections; in cursive hands, especially where abbreviations were numerous, some tendency to separate words may be recognised, but in reality it was phrases or groups of letters rather than words which were divided. In the later minuscule word-division is much commoner but never became systematic, accents and breathings serving of themselves to indicate the proper division.&lt;ref name="Bell" /&gt;

{{See also|Linguistic history of the Indian subcontinent}}
The view that the art of writing in [[India]] developed gradually, as in other areas of the world, by going through the stages of pictographic, ideographic and transitional phases of the phonetic script, which in turn developed into syllabic and alphabetic scripts was challenged by Falk and others in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Schrift im alten Indien: ein Forschungsbericht mit Anmerkungen|first=Harry|last=Falk|date=1993|publisher=G. Narr|isbn=3823342711|location=Tübingen|oclc=29443654}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the new paradigm, Indian alphabetic writing, called [[Brahmi script|Brāhmī]], was discontinuous with earlier, undeciphered, glyphs, and was invented specifically by King [[Ashoka]] for application in his royal [[Edicts of Ashoka|edicts]]. In the subcontinent, three scripts like Indus, [[Kharosthi|Kharoṣṭhī]] and [[Brahmi script|Brāhmī]] became prevalent. In addition, [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] and [[Arabic script]]s were also added to the Indian context after their penetration in the early centuries of the [[common era]] (CE). The decipherment and subsequent development of Indus glyphs is also a matter for continuing research and discussion. After a lapse of a few centuries the Kharoṣṭhī script became obsolete; the Greek script in India went through a similar fate and disappeared. But the Brāhmī and Arabic scripts endured for a much longer period. Moreover, there was a change and development in the Brāhmī script which may be traced in time and space through the [[Maurya Empire|Maurya]], [[Kushan Empire|Kuṣāṇa]], [[Gupta script|Gupta]] and early medieval periods. The present day [[Nāgarī script]] is derived from Brāhmī. The Brāhmī is also the ancestral script of many other Indian scripts, in northern and southern South Asia. Legends and inscriptions in Brāhmī are engraved upon leather, wood, terracotta, ivory, stone, copper, bronze, silver and gold. Arabic got an important place, particularly in the royalty, during the medieval period and it provides rich material for history writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salomon|first=Richard|date=1995|title=Review: On the Origin of the Early Indian Scripts|jstor=604670|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=115|issue=2|pages=271–279|doi=10.2307/604670}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the available inscriptions and manuscripts written in the above scripts—in languages like [[Prakrit|Prākrita]], [[Pali|Pāḷi]], [[Sanskrit|Saṃskṛta]], [[Apabhraṃśa]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]—have been read and exploited for history writing, but numerous inscriptions preserved in different museums still remain undeciphered for lack of competent palaeographic Indologists, as there is a gradual decline in the subcontinent of such disciplines as palaeography, [[epigraphy]] and [[numismatics]]. The discipline of ancient Indian scripts and the languages they are written needs new scholars who, by adopting traditional palaeographic methods and modern technology, may decipher, study and transcribe the various types of epigraphs and legends still extant today.&lt;ref&gt;There are few available texts relating to "Indian palaeography", among which Ahmad Hasan Dani, ''Indian Palaeography'', Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers, 1997; A. C. Burnell, ''Elements of South-Indian Palaeography, from the Fourth to the Seventeenth Century AD'', repr. 2012; Rajbali Pandey, ''Indian Palaeography'', Motilal Banarasi Das, 1957; Naresh Prasad Rastogi, ''Origin of Brāhmī Script: The Beginning of Alphabet in India'', Chowkhamba Saraswatibhawan, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indian epigraphy: a guide to the study of inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the other Indo-Aryan languages|last=Salomon|first=Richard|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195099842|location=New York|oclc=252595337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language of the earliest written records, that is, the [[Edicts of Ashoka]], is [[Prakrit]]. Besides Prakrit, the Ashokan edicts are also written in Greek and Aramaic. Moreover, all the edicts of [[Ashoka]] engraved in the Kharoshthi and Brahmi scripts are in the Prakrit language: thus, originally the language employed in the inscriptions was Prakrit, with Sanskrit adopted at a later stage. Past the period of the [[Maurya Empire]], the use of Prakrit continued in inscriptions for a few more centuries. In north India, Prakrit was replaced by Sanskrit by the end of the 3rd century, while this change took place about a century later in south India. Some of the inscriptions though written in Prakrit, were influenced by Sanskrit and vice versa. The epigraphs of the Kushana kings are found in a mixture of Prakrit and Sanskrit, while the Mathura inscriptions of the time of Sodasa, belonging to the first quarter of the 1st century, contain verses in classical Sanskrit. From the 4th century onwards, the [[Gupta Empire|Guptas]] came to power and made Sanskrit flourish by supporting it in language and literature.

In western India and also in some regions of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Karnataka]], Prakrit was used till the 4th century, mostly in the [[Buddhist]] writings though in a few contemporary records of the [[Ikshvaku dynasty|Ikshvakus]] of [[Nagarjunakonda]], Sanskrit was applied. The inscription of [[Yajna Sri Satakarni]] (2nd century) from [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]] is considered to be the earliest so far. The earlier writings (4th century) of Salankayanas of the [[Telugu people|Telugu region]] are in Prakrit, while their later records (belonging to the 5th century) are written in Sanskrit. In the [[Kannada language|Kannada speaking area]], inscriptions belonging to later Satavahanas and Chutus were written in Prakrit. From the 4th century onwards, with the rise of the Guptas, Sanskrit became the predominant language of India and continued to be employed in texts and inscriptions of all parts of India along with the regional languages in the subsequent centuries. The copper-plate charters of the [[Pallavas]], the [[Cholas]] and the [[Pandyas]] documents are written in both Sanskrit and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. Kannada is used in texts dating from about the 5th century and the [[Halmidi inscription]] is considered to be the earliest [[epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] written in the [[Kannada language]]. Inscriptions in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] began to appear from the 6th or 7th century. [[Malayalam]] made its beginning in writings from the 15th century onwards.&lt;ref name="Indi"&gt;For this section cf.

=== North India ===
[[File:Rigveda MS2097.jpg|thumb|[[Rigveda]] manuscript in [[Devanāgarī]] (early 19th century)]]
{{See also|Kharosthi|Devanagari}}
In north India, the [[Brahmi]] script was used over a vast area; however, [[Ashoka]]n inscriptions are also found using [[Kharoshthi]], [[Aramaic]] and [[Greek script]]s. With the advent of the [[Saka]]-[[Western Kshatrapas|Kshatrapas]] and the [[Kushan Empire|Kushanas]] as political powers in north India, the writing system underwent a definite change due to the use of new writing tools and techniques. Further development of the Brahmi script and perceivable changes in its evolutionary trend can be discerned during the Gupta period: in fact, the [[Gupta script]] is considered to be the successor of the Kushana script in north India.

From the 6th to about the 10th century of the [[common era]], the inscriptions in north India were written in a script variously named, e.g., Siddhamatrika and Kutila ("Rañjanā script"). From the 8th century, Siddhamatrika developed into the [[Śāradā script]] in [[Kashmir]] and [[Punjab region|Punjab]], into [[Bengali language|Proto-Bengali]] or Gaudi in [[Bengal]] and [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], and into [[Devanagari|Nagari]] in other parts of north India. [[Nāgarī script]] was used widely in northern India from the 10th century onwards. The use of [[Nandinagari]], a variant of [[Nagari script]], is mostly confined to the [[Karnataka]] region.

In central India, mostly in [[Madhya Pradesh]], the inscriptions of the [[Vakatakas]], and the kings of [[Sharabhapuriya dynasty|Sarabhapura]] and [[Dakshina Kosala|Kosala]] were written in what are known as "box-headed" and "nail-headed" characters. It may be noted that the early [[Kadambas]] of [[Karnataka]] also employed "nail-headed" characters in some of their inscriptions. During the 3rd–4th century, the script used in the inscriptions of [[Ikshvaku dynasty|Ikshvakus]] of [[Nagarjunakonda]] developed a unique style of letter-forms with elongated verticals and artistic flourishes, which did not continue after their rule.&lt;ref name="Indi" /&gt;

=== South India ===
The earliest attested form of writing in [[South India]] is represented by inscriptions found in caves, associated with the [[Chalukya]] and [[Chera Dynasty|Chera]] dynasties. These are written in variants of what is known as the [[Cave character]], and their script differs from the Northern version in being more angular. Most of the modern scripts of South India have evolved from this script, with the exception of [[Vatteluttu]], the exact origins of which are unknown, and [[Nandinagari]], which is a variant of [[Devanagari]] that developed due to later Northern influence. In south India from the 7th century of the common era onwards, a number of inscriptions belonging to the dynasties of Pallava, Chola and Pandya are found. These records are written in three different scripts known as [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Vattezhuttu]] and [[Grantha script]]s, the last variety being used to write Sanskrit inscriptions. In the [[Kerala]] region, the Vattezhuttu script developed into a still more cursive script called [[Kolezhuthu]] during the 14th and 15th centuries. At the same time, the modern [[Malayalam]] script developed out of the Grantha script. The early form of the [[Telugu-Kannada script]] is found in the inscriptions of the early [[Kadamba Dynasty|Kadambas]] of [[Banavasi]] and the early [[Chalukyas of Badami]] in the west, and [[Salankayana]] and the early Eastern Chalukyas in the east who ruled the Kannada and Telugu speaking areas respectively, during the 4th to 7th centuries.

== Latin ==
{{See also|History of the Latin alphabet}}
Attention should be drawn at the outset to certain fundamental definitions and principles of the science. The original characters of an alphabet are modified by the material and the implements used. When stone and chisel are discarded for papyrus and reed-pen, the hand encounters less resistance and moves more rapidly. This leads to changes in the size and position of the letters, and then to the joining of letters, and, consequently, to altered shapes. We are thus confronted at an early date with quite distinct types. The majuscule style of writing, based on two parallel lines, '''ADPL''', is opposed to the minuscule, based on a system of four lines, with letters of unequal height, '''adpl'''. Another classification, according to the care taken in forming the letters, distinguishes between the set book-hand and the cursive script. The difference in this case is determined by the subject matter of the text; the writing used for books (''scriptura libraria'') is in all periods quite distinct from that used for letters and documents (''epistolaris, diplomatica''). While the set book-hand, in majuscule or minuscule, shows a tendency to stabilise the forms of the letters, the cursive, often carelessly written, is continually changing in the course of years and according to the preferences of the writers.

This being granted, a summary survey of the morphological history of the [[Latin alphabet]] shows the zenith of its modifications at once, for its history is divided into two very unequal periods, the first dominated by majuscule and the second by minuscule writing.&lt;ref name="Bouar"&gt;The contents of the following sections on {{small caps|Latin palaeography}}—especially the parts relating to "Minuscule writing"—are mainly based on the specialist writings consulted and cited throughout the text, from the following sources: primarily the article on ''Latin handwriting'' by French palaeographist A. de Bouard, present {{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Palaeography#Latin Writing I |display=Palaeography § Latin Writing |volume=20 |pages=567–573}}&lt;!--|url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopdiabri20chis#page/567/mode/1up--&gt; – now in the [[public domain]]; the requisite [http://guindo.pntic.mec.es/jmag0042/ingles.php?d=LATIN_PALEOGRAPHY.pdf ''Fonts for Latin Palaeography – User's manual''], by Juan-Jose Marcos, 2011; Schiapparelli, ''La scrittura latina nell'età romana'', 1921; Giorgio Cencetti, ''Paleografia latina'', Jouvence, 2002; [[Bernhard Bischoff]], ''Paleografia latina.

=== Overview ===
[[Jean Mabillon]], a French Benedictine monk, scholar and [[Antiquarian|antiquary]], whose work ''De re diplomatica'' was published in 1681, is widely regarded as the founder of the twin disciplines of palaeography and [[diplomatics]]. However, the actual term "palaeography" was coined (in Latin) by [[Bernard de Montfaucon]], a [[Benedictine monk]], in the title of his ''Palaeographia Graeca'' (1708), which remained a standard work in the specific field of Greek palaeography for more than a century.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard de Montfaucon et al., ''Palaeographia Graeca, sive, De ortu et progressu literarum graecarum'', Paris, Ludovicum Guerin (1708).&lt;/ref&gt; With their establishment of palaeography, Mabillon and his fellow Benedictines were responding to the Jesuit [[Daniel Papebroch]], who doubted the authenticity of some of the documents which the Benedictines offered as credentials for the authorisation of their monasteries.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Metzger, ''The Text of the New Testament'' Fourth Edition (Oxford University, 2005), p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century such scholars as [[Wilhelm Wattenbach]], [[Leopold Delisle]] and [[Ludwig Traube (palaeographer)|Ludwig Traube]] contributed greatly to making palaeography independent from diplomatic. In the 20th century, the 'New French School' of palaeographers, especially [[Jean Mallon]], gave a new direction to the study of scripts by stressing the importance of ductus (the shape and order of the strokes used to compose letters) in studying the historical development of scripts.&lt;ref name=fn_2&gt;R. Marichal, "Paleography" in New Encyclopaedia New York: Gale-Thomson, 2003 Vol. X, p. 773.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Majuscule writing ===
==== Capital writing ====
[[File:RomanVirgilFolio014rVergilPortrait.jpg|thumb|200px|Folio14 [[recto]] of the [[Vergilius Romanus]] written in [[rustic capitals]], also contains an author portrait of [[Virgil]].]]

The [[Latin alphabet]] first appears in the epigraphic type of [[majuscule]] writing, known as capitals. These characters form the main stem from which developed all the branches of Latin writing. On the oldest monuments (the ''inscriptiones bello Hannibalico antiquiores'' of the ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum = CIL]]''), it is far from showing the orderly regularity of the later period. Side by side with upright and square characters are angular and sloping forms, sometimes very distorted, which seem to indicate the existence of an early cursive writing from which they would have been borrowed. Certain literary texts clearly allude to such a hand.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Henry B. Van Hoesen, [https://archive.org/details/romancursivewri00hoesgoog ''Roman Cursive Writing''], Princeton University Press, 1915, pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the characters of the cursive type were progressively eliminated from formal inscriptions, and capital writing reached its perfection in the [[History of Rome|Augustan Age]].

Epigraphists divide the numerous inscriptions of this period into two quite distinct classes: ''tituli'', or formal inscriptions engraved on stone in elegant and regular capitals, and ''acta'', or legal texts, documents, etc., generally engraved on bronze in cramped and careless capitals. Palaeography inherits both these types. Reproduced by scribes on papyrus or parchment, the elegant characters of the inscriptions become the square capitals of the manuscripts, and the ''actuaria'', as the writing of the ''acta'' is called, becomes the [[rustic capital]].

Of the many books written in square capitals, the ''éditions de luxe'' of ancient times, only a few fragments have survived, the most famous being pages from manuscripts of [[Virgil]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Émile Chatelain]], [http://images.library.uiuc.edu/projects/classics/index.asp ''Paléographie des classiques latins''], pl. LXI-II, LXXV; ''[[Oxyrhynchus Papyri]]'', viii, 1,098.&lt;/ref&gt; The finest examples of rustic capitals, the use of which is attested by papyri of the 1st century,&lt;ref&gt;Cf.

''Pal. Soc.'', pl. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Neither of these forms of capital writing offers any difficulty in reading, except that no space is left between the words. Their dates are still uncertain, in spite of attempts to determine them by minute observation.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Karl Franz Otto Dziatzko]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=nHM2QwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Untersuchungen über ausgewählte Kapitel des antiken Buchwesens''], BiblioBazaar, repr. 2010; E.A. Lowe, [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=3572504 "More Facts about our Oldest Latin Manuscripts"], in the ''Classical Quarterly'', vol. xix, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rustic capitals, more practical than the square forms, soon came into general use. This was the standard form of writing, so far as books are concerned, until the 5th century, when it was replaced by a new type, the uncial, which is discussed below.

==== Early cursive writing ====
While the set book-hand, in square or rustic capitals, was used for the copying of books, the writing of everyday life, letters and documents of all kinds, was in a cursive form, the oldest examples of which are provided by the [[graffiti]] on walls at [[Pompeii]] (''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'', iv), a series of waxen tablets, also discovered at Pompeii (''CIL'', iv, supplement), a similar series found at [[Verespatak]] in [[Transylvania]] (''CIL'', iii) and a number of papyri.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Carl Wessely]], [http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/lookupid?key=ha001159476 ''Schrifttafeln zur älteren lateinischen Palaeographie''], Leipzig, E. Avenarius; ''Oxyrhynchus Papyri, passim''; Vincenzo Federici, ''Esempi di corsivo antico''; ''et al.''&lt;/ref&gt; From a study of a number of documents which exhibit transitional forms, it appears that this cursive was originally simplified capital writing.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Franz Steffens, [http://www.paleography.unifr.ch/schrifttafeln.htm ''Lateinische Paläographie'' – digital version''], 2nd ed., pl. 3 {{de icon}}; Wessely, ''Studien'', xiv, pl. viii; ''et al.''&lt;/ref&gt; The evolution was so rapid, however, that at quite an early date the ''scriptura epistolaris'' of the Roman world can no longer be described as capitals. By the 1st century, this kind of writing began to develop the principal characteristics of two new types: the [[Uncial script|uncial]] and the [[minuscule cursive]]. With the coming into use of writing surfaces which were smooth, or offered little resistance, the unhampered haste of the writer altered the shape, size and position of the letters. In the earliest specimens of writing on wax, plaster or papyrus, there appears a tendency to represent several straight strokes by a single curve. The cursive writing thus foreshadows the specifically uncial forms. The same specimens show great inequality in the height of the letters; the main strokes are prolonged upwards ([[File:Hand 1 sample b 1.png|20px]]= '''b'''; [[File:Hand 10 sample d 2.png|20px]]= '''d''') or downwards ([[File:Hand 2 sample q.png|20px]]= '''q'''; [[File:Hand 4 sample s 2.png|15px]] = '''s'''). In this direction, the cursive tends to become a minuscule hand.&lt;ref name="Bouar" /&gt;

==== Uncial writing ====
Although the characteristic forms of the uncial type appear to have their origin in the early cursive,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Edward Maunde Thompson]], [https://archive.org/details/greeklatin00thomuoft ''Handbook of Greek and Latin Palaeography''], ''s.v.''; Van Hoesen, ''The Parentage and Birthdate of the Latin Uncial'', in ''Transactions and Proceedings'' of the [[American Philological Association]], xlii.&lt;/ref&gt; the two hands are nevertheless quite distinct. The uncial is a ''libraria'', closely related to the capital writing, from which it differs only in the rounding off of the angles of certain letters, principally [[File:Hand 1 sample A mag 2.png|28px]] [[File:Uncial d.png|15px]] [[File:Uncial e.png|15px]] [[File:Hand 2 sample m 1.png|30px]]. It represents a compromise between the beauty and legibility of the capitals and the rapidity of the cursive, and is clearly an artificial product. It was certainly in existence by the latter part of the 4th century, for a number of manuscripts of that date are written in perfect uncial hands (''Exempla'', pl. XX). It presently supplanted the capitals and appears in numerous manuscripts which have survived from the 5th, 6th and 7th centuries, when it was at its height.&lt;ref&gt;A list is given in Traube, ''Vorlesungen'', i, pp. 171–261, and numerous reproductions in Zangemeister &amp; Wattenbach's ''Exempla'', and in Chatelain, ''Uncialis scriptura''.&lt;/ref&gt; By this time it had become an imitative hand, in which there was generally no room for spontaneous development. It remained noticeably uniform over a long period. It is difficult therefore to date the manuscripts by palaeographical criteria alone. The most that can be done is to classify them by centuries, on the strength of tenuous data.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Chatelain, ''Unc. script., explanatio tabularum''.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest uncial writing is easily distinguished by its simple and monumental character from the later hands, which become progressively stiff and affected.

=== Minuscule cursive writing ===
[[File:Chronica archiepiscoporum Magdeburgensium 1r 25-C-4 (16764) Hs Kynžvart 91.jpg|thumb|200px|Page from the [[Magdeburg]]'s ''Chronica archiepiscoporum'']]

==== Early minuscule cursive ====
In the ancient cursive writing, from the 1st century onward, there are symptoms of transformation in the form of certain letters, the shape and proportions of which correspond more closely to the definition of minuscule writing than to that of majuscule. Rare and irregular at first, they gradually become more numerous and more constant and by degrees supplant the majuscule forms, so that in the history of the Roman cursive there is no precise boundary between the majuscule and minuscule periods.

The oldest example of minuscule cursive writing that has been discovered is a letter on papyrus, found in Egypt, dating from the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Archiv für Urkundenforschung'', iii, pl. i.&lt;/ref&gt; This marks a highly important date in the history of Latin writing, for with only one known exception, not yet adequately explained—two fragments of imperial rescripts of the 5th century&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Theodor Mommsen]], ''Fragmente zweier Kaiserrescripte'' in ''Jahrbuch des gemeinen deutschen Rechts'', vi, 398; Preisigke in ''Schriften der wissensch. Gesellsch. in Strassburg'', xxx; ''Pal. Soc., cit.'', pl. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;—the minuscule cursive was consequently the only ''scriptura epistolaris'' of the Roman world. The ensuing succession of documents&lt;ref&gt;For example, a certificate of AD 400 in Wessely, ''Studien, cit.'', xiv, pl. xiii; a letter of AD 444 in Wessely, ''Schrifttafeln, cit.'', pl. xii, No. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; show a continuous improvement in this form of writing, characterised by the boldness of the strokes and by the elimination of the last lingering majuscule forms. The [[Ravenna]] deeds of the 5th and 6th centuries&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Gaetano Marini, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UBF4CR_Ax1kC&amp;redir_esc=y ''I Papiri diplomatici''], Lightning Source UK Ltd, repr. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; exhibit this hand at its perfection.

At this period, the minuscule cursive made its appearance as a ''[[book hand]]'', first as marginal notes, and later for the complete books themselves. The only difference between the book-hand and that used for documents is that the principal strokes are shorter and the characters thicker. This form of the hand is usually called ''[[Semi-cursive script|semi-cursive]]''.&lt;ref name="Bouar" /&gt;

==== National hands ====
The fall of the Empire and the establishment of the barbarians within its former boundaries did not interrupt the use of the Roman minuscule cursive hand, which was adopted by the newcomers. But for gaps of over a century in the chronological series of documents which have been preserved, it would be possible to follow the evolution of the Roman cursive into the so-called "national hands", forms of minuscule writing which flourished after the barbarian invasions in [[Italy]], [[France]], [[Spain]], [[England]] and [[Ireland]], and which are still known as [[Lombardic language|Lombardic]], [[Merovingian script|Merovingian]], [[Visigothic script|Visigothic]], [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] and [[Insular script|Irish]]. These names came into use at a time when the various national hands were believed to have been invented by the peoples who used them, but their connotation is merely geographical. Nevertheless, in spite of a close resemblance which betrays their common origin, these hands are specifically different, perhaps because the Roman cursive was developed by each nation in accordance with its artistic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Luigi Schiapparelli, ''Note paleografiche'' in ''Archivio storico italiano'', lxxiv, p. 55; also his [https://archive.org/details/lascritturalatin00schi ''La scrittura latina nell' età romana (note paleografiche)''] (with 32 facsimiles), Como, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt;

;''Lombardic writing''
[[File:Origo gentis Langobardorum.jpg|thumb|left|160px|A 10th-century [[codex]] of ''Origo gentis Langobardorum'' from [[Reims]]]]
In Italy, after the close of the Roman and Byzantine periods, the writing is known as [[Lombardic capitals|Lombardic]], a generic term which comprises several local varieties. These may be classified under four principal types: two for the ''scriptura epistolaris'', the old Italian cursive and the [[pope|papal]] [[chancery hand]], or ''littera romana'', and two for the ''libraria'', the old Italian book-hand and Lombardic in the narrow sense, sometimes known as ''Beneventana'' on account of the fact that it flourished in the principality of [[Benevento]].

The oldest preserved documents written in the old Italian cursive show all the essential characteristics of the Roman cursive of the 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Giuseppe Bonelli,[https://books.google.com/books?id=bEiYQAAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Codice paleografico lombardo''], Hoepli, 1908; [https://archive.org/details/bullettino0102archuoft ''Archivio paleografico italiano, cit.''], i, iii, vii.&lt;/ref&gt; In northern Italy, this hand began in the 9th century to be influenced by a minuscule book-hand which developed, as will be seen later, in the time of [[Charlemagne]]; under this influence it gradually disappeared, and ceased to exist in the course of the 12th century. In southern Italy, it persisted far on into the [[later Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Michele Russi, [https://archive.org/details/paleografiaedip00russgoog ''Paleografia e diplomatica de' documenti delle Province napolitane''], Naples, 1883.&lt;/ref&gt; The papal chancery hand, a variety of Lombardic peculiar to the vicinity of [[Rome]] and principally used in papal documents, is distinguished by the formation of the letters ''a, e, q, t''. It is formal in appearance at first, but is gradually simplified, under the influence of the [[Carolingian minuscule]], which finally prevailed in the [[papal bull|bulls]] of [[Honorius II]] (1124–1130). The [[notaries public]] in Rome continued to use the papal chancery hand until the beginning of the 13th century. The old Italian book-hand is simply a semi-cursive of the type already described as in use in the 6th century. The principal examples are derived from ''[[scriptoria]]'' in northern Italy, where it was displaced by the Carolingian minuscule during the 9th century.  In southern Italy, this hand persisted, developing into a [[calligraphy|calligraphic form]] of writing, and in the 10th century took on a very artistic angular appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Elias Avery Lowe, [https://archive.org/details/beneventanscript00loweuoft ''Beneventan Script''], Oxford : Clarendon Press, 1914; [[facsimile]]s in O. Piscicelli Taeggi, ''Paleografia artistica di Monte Cassino'', [[Montecassino]], 1876–83.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Exultet]]'' rolls provide the finest examples.{{According to whom|date=April 2013}} In the 9th century, it was introduced in [[Dalmatia]] by the [[Benedictine monks]] and developed there, as in [[Apulia]], on the basis of the [[archetype]], culminating in a rounded ''[[Beneventan script|Beneventana]]'' known as the ''Bari type''.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Viktor Novak, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RWhzXwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Scriptura Beneventana''], [[Zagreb]], 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;

;''Merovingian''
[[File:Merov.jpg|160px|left|thumb|8th-century [[Merovingian script]].]]
The offshoot of the Roman cursive which developed in [[Gaul]] under the first dynasty of kings is called [[Merovingian script|Merovingian writing]]. It is represented by thirty-eight royal diplomas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lauer |first1=P. |last2=Samaran |first2=C. |oclc=461176420 |title=Les diplômes originaux des Mérovingiens: fac-similés phototypiques avec notices et transcriptions |location=Paris |publisher=E. Leroux |year=1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; a number of private charters&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Jules Tardif, [http://www.worldcat.org/title/fac-simile-de-chartes-et-diplomes-merovingiens-et-carlovingiens-sur-papyrus-et-sur-parchemin-compris-dans-linventaire-des-monuments-historiques/oclc/12953061 ''Fac-similé de chartes et diplômes mérovingiens et carlovingiens: sur papyrus et sur parchemin compris dans l'inventaire des Monuments historiques''], Paris: J. Claye, 1866.&lt;/ref&gt; and the authenticating documents of relics.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Maurice Prou, ''Manuel de paléographie: Recueil de fac-similés d'écritures du Ve au XVIIe siècle'', Paris: A. Picard et fils, 1904, pl. v.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though less than a century intervenes between the Ravenna cursive and the oldest extant Merovingian document (AD 625), there is a great difference in appearance between the two writings. The facile flow of the former is replaced by a cramped style, in which the natural slope to the right gives way to an upright hand, and the letters, instead of being fully outlined, are compressed to such an extent that they modify the shape of other letters. Copyists of books used a cursive similar to that found in documents, except that the strokes are thicker, the forms more regular, and the heads and tails shorter.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/bec_0373-6237_1887_num_48_1_462552 ''Album paléographique de la Société de l'École des chartes''], pl. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The Merovingian cursive as used in books underwent simplification in some localities, undoubtedly through the influence of the minuscule book-hand of the period. The two principal centres of this reform were [[Luxeuil Abbey|Luxeuil]] and [[Corbie Abbey|Corbie]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Traube, ''Perrona Scottorum'' in ''Sitzungsberichte'' of the [[Munich Academy]], 1900; Liebart, ''Corbie Scriptorum'' in W.M. Lindsay's ''Palaeogr. Lat.'', i.&lt;/ref&gt;

;''Visigothic''
[[File:AlfabetoVisigodo.png|thumb|160px|left|Alphabet in [[Visigothic script]].]]
In Spain, after the Visigothic conquest, the Roman cursive gradually developed special characteristics. Some documents attributed to the 7th century display a transitional hand with straggling and rather uncouth forms.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Ewald and Loewe, ''Exempla scripturae visigothicae'', pl. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The distinctive features of Visigothic writing, the most noticeable of which is certainly the q-shaped '''g''', did not appear until later, in the book-hand. The book-hand became set at an early date. In the 8th century it appears as a sort of semi-cursive; the earliest example of certain date is [[manuscript|ms]] lxxxix in the [[Capitulary|Capitular]] [[Library]] in [[Verona]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Clark, ''Collectanea hispanica'', 63, pp. 129–130; Schiapparelli in ''Arch. stor. ital, cit.'', lxxxii, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 9th century the calligraphic forms become broader and more rounded until the 11th century, when they become slender and angular.&lt;ref&gt;Numerous reproductions exists in the literature, cf. ''int. al.'', Ewald and Loewe, ''Exempla, cit.''; Burnam, ''Paleogr. iberica''; Clark, ''Collectanea, cit.''; Garcia Villada, ''Paleogr. española''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Visigothic minuscule appears in a cursive form in documents about the middle of the 9th century, and in the course of time grows more intricate and consequently less legible.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Munoz, ''Paleogr. visigoda''; Garcia Villada, ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; It soon came into competition with the Carolingian minuscule, which supplanted it as a result of the presence in Spain of French elements such as [[Cluniac monks]] and warriors engaged in the campaign against the [[Moors]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Hessel, ''Ausbreitung der karolingischen Minuskel'' in ''Archiv für Urkundenforschung'', vii, viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish and Anglo-Saxon hands, which were not directly derived from the Roman minuscule cursive, will be discussed in a [[#Irish and Anglo-Saxon Writing|separate sub-section below]].

=== Set minuscule writing ===
One by one, the national minuscule cursive hands were replaced by a set minuscule hand which has already been mentioned and its origins may now be traced from the beginning.

==== Half-uncial writing ====
The early cursive was the medium in which the minuscule forms were gradually evolved from the corresponding majuscule forms. Minuscule writing was therefore cursive in its inception. As the minuscule letters made their appearance in the cursive writing of documents, they were adopted and given calligraphic form by the copyists of literary texts, so that the set minuscule alphabet was constituted gradually, letter by letter, following the development of the minuscule cursive. Just as some documents written in the early cursive show a mixture of majuscule and minuscule forms, so certain literary papyri of the 3rd century,&lt;ref&gt;''Oxyrhynchus Papyri, cit.'', iv, pl. vi, No. 668; xi, pl. vi, No. 1,379.&lt;/ref&gt; and inscriptions on stone of the 4th century&lt;ref&gt;''Pal. Soc., cit.'', pl. 127-8; ''Arch. pal. ital., cit.'', v, pl. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; yield examples of a mixed set hand, with minuscule forms side by side with capital and uncial letters. The number of minuscule forms increases steadily in texts written in the mixed hand, and especially in marginal notes, until by the end of the 5th century the majuscule forms have almost entirely disappeared in some [[manuscript]]s. This quasi-minuscule writing, known as the "half-uncial"&lt;ref&gt;Cf. many examples in [[Émile Chatelain]], ''Semiuncial Script, passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; thus derives from a long line of mixed hands which, in a synoptic chart of [[Latin script]]s, would appear close to the oldest ''librariae'', and between them and the ''epistolaris'' (cursive), from which its characteristic forms were successively derived. It had a considerable influence on the continental ''scriptura libraria'' of the 7th and 8th centuries.

==== Irish and Anglo-Saxon writing ====
The half-uncial hand was introduced in Ireland along with Latin culture in the 5th century by priests and laymen from [[Gaul]], fleeing before the barbarian invasions. It was adopted there to the exclusion of the cursive, and soon took on a distinct character. There are two well established classes of Irish writing as early as the 7th century: a large round half-uncial hand, in which certain majuscule forms frequently appear, and a pointed hand, which becomes more cursive and more genuinely minuscule. The latter developed out of the former.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Wolfgang Keller, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IKA3QwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Angelsächsische Palaeographie''], Mayer &amp; Müller, 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the distinguishing marks of manuscripts of Irish origin is to be found in the initial letters, which are ornamented by interlacing, animal forms, or a frame of red dots. The most certain evidence, however, is provided by the system of abbreviations and by the combined square and cuneiform appearance of the minuscule at the height of its development.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Schiapparelli in ''Arch. stor. ital., cit.'', lxxiv, ii, pp. 1–126.&lt;/ref&gt; The two types of Irish writing were introduced in the north of Great Britain by the monks, and were soon adopted by the [[Anglo-Saxons]], being so exactly copied that it is sometimes difficult to determine the origin of an example. Gradually, however, the Anglo-Saxon writing developed a distinct style, and even local types,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Keller, ''op. cit.''; W.M. Lindsay, [https://archive.org/details/earlywelshscript00lind ''Early Welsh Script''], Oxford: J. Parker &amp; Co., 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; which were superseded after the Norman conquest by the Carolingian minuscule. Through [[St Columba]] and his followers, Irish writing spread to the continent, and manuscripts were written in the Irish hand in the monasteries of [[Bobbio Abbey]] and [[St Gall]] during the 7th and 8th centuries.

==== Pre-Caroline ====
James J. John points out that the disappearance of imperial authority around the end of the 5th century in most of the Latin-speaking half of the Roman Empire does not entail the disappearance of the Latin scripts, but rather introduced conditions that would allow the various provinces of the West gradually to drift apart in their writing habits, a process that began around the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;James J. John, "Latin Paleography", in J. Powell, ''Medieval Studies'', 2nd. ed. (Syracuse: [[Syracuse University Press]], 1992), pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Gregory I]] (Gregory the Great, d. 604) was influential in the spread of Christianity to Britain and also sent Queens Theodelinde and Brunhilda, as well as Spanish bishops, copies of manuscripts. Furthermore, he sent the Roman monk [[Augustine of Canterbury]] to Britain on a missionary journey, on which Augustine may have brought manuscripts. Although Italy's dominance as a centre of manuscript production began to decline, especially after the [[Gothic War (535–554)]] and the invasions by the [[Lombards]], its manuscripts—and more important, the scripts in which they were written—were distributed across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Bernhard Bischoff]], ''Latin Palaeography: Antiquity and the Middle Ages'', trans. Daibi O Croinin and David Ganz (Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1990), pp. 83–112; 190–202.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 6th through the 8th centuries, a number of so-called 'national hands' were developed throughout the Latin-speaking areas of the former Roman Empire. By the late 6th century Irish scribes had begun transforming Roman scripts into Insular minuscule and majuscule scripts. A series of transformations, for book purposes, of the cursive documentary script that had grown out of the later Roman cursive would get under way in France by the mid-7th century. In Spain half-uncial and cursive would both be transformed into a new script, the Visigothic minuscule, no later than the early 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;John, 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Carolingian minuscule ====
[[File:Charlemagne miniscule.jpg|thumb|200px|A page in [[Carolingian minuscule]] (''[[Book of Exodus]]'')]]
Beginning in the 8th century, as [[Charlemagne]] began to consolidate power over a large area of western Europe, scribes developed a minuscule script ([[Caroline minuscule]]) that effectively became the standard script for manuscripts from the 9th to the 11th centuries. The origin of this hand is much disputed. This is due to the confusion which prevailed before the Carolingian period in the ''libraria'' in France, Italy and Germany as a result of the competition between the cursive and the set hands. In addition to the calligraphic uncial and half-uncial writings, which were imitative forms, little used and consequently without much vitality, and the minuscule cursive, which was the most natural hand, there were innumerable varieties of mixed writing derived from the influence of these hands on each other. In some, the uncial or half-uncial forms were preserved with little or no modification, but the influence of the cursive is shown by the freedom of the strokes; these are known as rustic, semi-cursive or cursive uncial or half-uncial hands. Conversely, the cursive was sometimes affected, in varying degrees, by the set ''librariae''; the cursive of the ''epistolaris'' became a semi-cursive when adopted as a ''libraria''. Nor is this all. Apart from these reciprocal influences affecting the movement of the hand across the page, there were [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] influences at work, letters being borrowed from one alphabet for another. This led to compromises of all softs and of infinite variety between the uncial and half-uncial and the cursive. It will readily be understood that the origin of the Carolingian minuscule, which must be sought in this tangle of pre-Carolingian hands, involves disagreement. The new writing is admittedly much more closely related to the ''epistolaris'' than the primitive minuscule; this is shown by certain forms, such as the open '''''a''''' ([[File:Hand 1.1 sample a 2.png|20px]]), which recall the cursive, by the joining of certain letters, and by the clubbing of the tall letters '''''b d h l''''', which resulted from a cursive ''[[Ductus (linguistics)|ductus]]''. Most palaeographers agree in assigning the new hand the place shown in the following table:&lt;ref name="Bouar" /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;

|}
&lt;/center&gt;
Controversy turns on the question whether the Carolingian minuscule is the primitive minuscule as modified by the influence of the cursive or a cursive based on the primitive minuscule. Its place of origin is also uncertain: Rome, the [[Palatine]] school, [[Tours]], [[Reims]], [[Metz]], [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]] and [[Corbie]] have been suggested, but no agreement has been reached.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''int. al.'', Harald Steinacker in ''Miscellanea Francesco Ehrle'', Rome, 1924, iv, pp. 126ff; G. Cencetti, "Postilla nuova a un problema paleografico vecchio: l'origine della minuscola carolina", in ''Nova Historia'', 1955, pp. 1–24; B. Bischoff, ''Latin Palaeography: Antiquity and the Middle Ages, cit.'', pp. 108–109.&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, the appearance of the new hand is a turning point in the history of culture. So far as Latin writing is concerned, it marks the dawn of [[Early modern period|modern times]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |last=Thompson |first=Edward Maunde |wstitle=Palaeography |volume=20 |pages=556–579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gothic minuscule ====
In the 12th century, Carolingian minuscule underwent a change in its appearance and adopted bold and broken [[Gothic alphabet|Gothic]] letter-forms. This style remained predominant, with some regional variants, until the 15th century, when the [[Renaissance]] [[humanism|humanistic]] scripts revived a version of Carolingian minuscule. It then spread from the Italian [[Renaissance]] all over Europe.

These humanistic scripts are the base for the [[Antiqua (typeface class)|antiqua]] and the handwriting forms in western and southern Europe. In [[Germany]] and [[Austria]], the ''[[Kurrentschrift]]'' was rooted in the [[cursive]] handwriting of the later [[Middle Ages]].  With the name of the [[calligrapher]] Ludwig [[Sütterlin]], this handwriting counterpart to the [[blackletter]] [[typeface]]s was abolished by [[Hitler]] in 1941. After [[World War II]], it was taught as an alternative script in some areas until the 1970s; it is no longer taught. [[Secretary hand]] is an informal business hand of the Renaissance.

=== Developments ===

There are undeniable points of contact between [[History of architecture|architecture]] and palaeography, and in both it is possible to distinguish a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] period {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}. The creative effort which began in the post-Carolingian period culminated at the beginning of the 12th century in a [[calligraphy]] and an architecture which, though still somewhat awkward, showed unmistakable signs of power and experience, and at the end of that century and in the first half of the 13th both arts reached their climax and made their boldest flights. The topography of later medieval writing is still being studied; national varieties can, of course, be' identified but the problem of distinguishing features becomes complicated as a result of the development of international relations, and the migration of clerks from one end of Europe to the other. During the later centuries of the [[Middle Ages]] the Gothic minuscule continued to improve within the restricted circle of ''de luxe'' editions and ceremonial documents. In common use, it degenerated into a cursive which became more and more intricate, full of superfluous strokes and complicated by abbreviations. In the first quarter of the 15th century an innovation took place which exercised a decisive influence on the evolution of writing in Europe. The Italian [[humanism|humanists]] were struck by the eminent legibility of the manuscripts, written in the improved Carolingian minuscule of the 10th and 11th centuries, in which they discovered the works of ancient authors, and carefully imitated the old writing. In [[Petrarch]]'s compact book hand, the wider leading and reduced compression and round curves are early manifestations of the reaction against the crabbed Gothic secretarial minuscule we know today as "[[Blackletter#Gothic minuscule|blackletter]]"; Petrarch was one of the few medieval authors to have written at any length on the handwriting of his time; in his essay on the subject, ''La scrittura''&lt;ref&gt;Petrarch, ''La scrittura'', discussed by Armando Petrucci, ''La scrittura di Francesco Petrarca'' (Vatican City) 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; he criticized the current scholastic hand, with its laboured strokes (''artificiosis litterarum tractibus'') and exuberant (''luxurians'') letter-forms amusing the eye from a distance, but fatiguing on closer exposure, as if written for other purpose than to be read. For Petrarch the gothic hand violated three principles: writing, he said, should be simple (''castigata''), clear (''clara'') and orthographically correct.&lt;ref&gt;Petrarch, ''La scrittura'', noted in Albert Derolez, "The script reform of Petrarch: an illusion?" in John Haines, Randall Rosenfeld, eds. ''Music and Medieval Manuscripts: paleography and performance'' 2006:5f; Derolez discusses the ''degree'' of Petrarch's often alluded-to reform.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boccaccio]] was a great admirer of Petrarch; from Boccaccio's immediate circle this post-Petrarchan "semi-gothic" revised hand spread to ''literati'' in [[Florence]], [[Lombardy]]&lt;ref&gt;Mirella Ferrari "La 'littera antiqua' a Milan, 1417–1439" in Johanne Autenrieth, ed. ''Renaissance- und Humanistenhandschriften'', (Munich:  Oldenbourg,) 1988:21–29.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Veneto]].&lt;ref&gt;Rhiannon Daniels, ''Boccaccio and the book: production and reading in Italy 1340–1520'', 2009:28.&lt;/ref&gt; A more thorough reform of handwriting than the Petrarchan compromise was in the offing. The generator of the new style (''illustration'') was [[Poggio Bracciolini]], a tireless pursuer of ancient manuscripts, who developed the new [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] script in the first decade of the 15th century. The Florentine bookseller [[Vespasiano da Bisticci]] recalled later in the century that Poggio had been a very fine [[calligraphy|calligrapher]] of ''lettera antica'' and had transcribed texts to support himself—presumably, as Martin Davies points out—&lt;ref&gt;Davies, in Kraye (ed.) 1996:51.&lt;/ref&gt; before he went to Rome in 1403 to begin his career in the [[papal curia]]. [[Berthold Ullman]] identifies the watershed moment in the development of the new humanistic hand as the youthful Poggio's transcription of [[Cicero]]'s ''[[Epistulae ad Atticum|Epistles to Atticus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ullman, ''The Origin and Development of Humanistic Script'' (Rome) 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the [[Medici]] library was catalogued in 1418, almost half the manuscripts were noted as in the ''lettera antica''. The new script was embraced and developed by the Florentine humanists and educators [[Niccolò de' Niccoli]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley Morison]], "Early humanistic script and the first roman type", reprinted in his ''Selected Essays on the History of Letter-Forms in Manuscript and Print'', ed. by David McKitterick, 2 vols. 1981:206-29.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Coluccio Salutati]]. The [[papal chancery]] adopted the new fashion for some purposes, and thus contributed to its diffusion throughout [[Christendom]]. The printers played a still more significant part in establishing this form of writing by using it, from the year 1465, as the basis for their types. The humanistic minuscule soon gave rise to a sloping cursive hand, known as the Italian, which was also taken up by printers in search of novelty and thus became the [[italic type]]. In consequence, the [[Italic script|Italian hand]] became widely used, and in the 16th century began to compete with the Gothic cursive. In the 17th century, writing masters were divided between the two schools, and there was in addition a whole series of compromises. The Gothic characters gradually disappeared, except a few that survived in Germany. The Italian became universally used, brought to perfection in more recent times by English calligraphers.&lt;ref name="Bouar" /&gt;

The '''Parsons code''', formally named the '''Parsons code for melodic contours''', is a simple notation used to identify a piece of music through [[melodic motion]] — movements of the [[pitch (music)|pitch]] up and down. [[Denys Parsons]] developed this system for his 1975 book ''[[The Directory of Tunes and Musical Themes]]''. Representing a melody in this manner makes it easier to index or search for pieces, particularly when the notes values are unknown.

The book was also published in Germany in 2002 and reprinted by [[Piatkus]] as ''[[The Directory of Classical Themes]]'' in 2008.

==The code==
The first note of a melody is denoted with an [[asterisk]] (*), although some Parsons code users omit the first note. All succeeding notes are denoted with one of three letters to indicate the relationship of its pitch to the previous note:
*&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; = first tone as reference,
*u = "up", for when the note is higher than the previous note,
*d = "down", for when the note is lower than the previous note,
*r = "repeat", for when the note has the same pitch as the previous note.

'''Photoperiodism''' is the physiological reaction of organisms to the length of day or night. It occurs in [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s. Photoperiodism can also be defined as the developmental responses of plants to the relative lengths of light and dark periods.
They are classified under three groups according to the photoperiods,they are:
1. Short-day plants
2. Long-day plants
3. Day-neutral plants.

== Plants ==&lt;!-- [[Photoperiodic plant]] redirects here --&gt;
{{anchor|In plants}}
Many [[flowering plant]]s (angiosperms) use a [[photoreceptor protein]], such as [[phytochrome]] or [[cryptochrome]],&lt;ref name=mauseth&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv |last= Mauseth|first= James D.|title=Botany : An Introduction to Plant Biology |edition=3rd|year=2003|isbn=978-0-7637-2134-3|publisher= Jones and Bartlett Learning|location=Sudbury, MA|pages=422–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; to sense seasonal changes in night length, or photoperiod, which they take as signals to flower. In a further subdivision, ''obligate'' photoperiodic plants absolutely require a long or short enough night before flowering, whereas ''facultative'' photoperiodic plants are more likely to flower under one condition.

Phytochrome comes in two forms: pr and pfr. Red light (which is present during the day) converts phytochrome to its active form (pfr). This then triggers the plant to grow. In turn, far-red light is present in the shade or in the dark and this converts phytochrome from pfr to pr. Pr is the inactive form of phytochrome and will not allow for plant growth. This system of pfr to pr conversion allows the plant to sense when it is night and when it is day.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Pfr can also be convereted back to Pr by a process known as dark reversion, where long periods of darkness trigger the conversion of Pfr.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Casal|first=J.J.|date=2014|title=Light perception and signalling by phytochrome A|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Botany|volume=65 (11).|issue=11|pages=2835–2845|doi=10.1093/jxb/ert379}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is important in regards to plant flowering. Experiments by Halliday et al. showed that manipulations of the red-to far-red ratio in Arabidopsis can alter flowering. They discovered that plants tend to flower later when exposed to more red light, proving that red light is inhibitory to flowering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Chentao|date=2000|title=Photoreceptors and Regulation of Flowering Time|url=|journal=Plant Physiology|volume=123|issue=1|pages=39–50|doi=10.1104/pp.123.1.39|pmid=10806223|pmc=1539253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other experiments have proven this  by exposing plants to extra red-light in the middle of the night. A short-day plant will not flower if light is turned on for a few minutes in the middle of the night and a long-day plant can flower if exposed to more red-light in the middle of the night.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Cryptochromes are another type of photoreceptor that is important in photoperiodism. Cryptochromes absorb blue light and UV-A. Cryptochromes entrain the circadian clock to light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Chentao|date=2005|title=The cryptochromes|url=|journal= Genome Biology|volume=6|issue=5|pages=220|doi=10.1186/gb-2005-6-5-220|pmid=15892880|pmc=1175950}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found that both cryptochrome and phytochrome abundance relies on light and the amount of cryptochrome can change depending on day-length. This shows how important both of the photoreceptors are in regards to determining day-length.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mockler|first=Todd|date=2003|title=Regulation of photoperiodic flowering by Arabidopsis photoreceptors|url=|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=100 | issue = 4 |pages=2140–2145|doi=10.1073/pnas.0437826100|pmc=149972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, W. W. Garner and H. A. Allard published their discoveries on photoperiodism and felt it was the length of daylight that was critical,&lt;ref name=mauseth /&gt;&lt;ref name=GA&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv |last=Capon|first=Brian|title=Botany for Gardeners|year=2005|edition=2nd|isbn=978-0-88192-655-2|publisher=Timber Publishing|location=Portland, OR|pages=148–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was later discovered that the length of the night was the controlling factor.&lt;ref name=h1&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hamner, K.C. |author2=Bonner, J. |year=1938|title=Photoperiodism in relation to hormones as factors in floral initiation and development|journal=Botanical Gazette|volume=100|issue=2|pages=388–431|jstor=2471641|doi=10.1086/334793}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=h2&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hamner, K.C.|year=1940|title=Interrelation of light and darkness in photoperiodic induction|journal=Botanical Gazette|volume=101|issue=3|pages=658–87|jstor=2472399|doi=10.1086/334903}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photoperiodic flowering plants are classified as ''long-day plants'' or ''short-day plants'' even though night is the critical factor because of the initial misunderstanding about daylight being the controlling factor. Along with long-day plants and short-day plants, there are plants that fall into a "dual-day length category". These plants are either long-short-day plants (LSDP) or short-long-day plants (SLDP). LSDPs flower after a series of long days followed by short days whereas SLDPs flower after a series of short days followed by long days.&lt;ref name="Taiz"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taiz|first1=Lincoln|last2=Zeiger|first2=Eduardo|last3=Møller|first3=Ian|last4=Murphy|first4=Angus|title=Plant Physiology and Development|date=2015|publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc.|location=Sunderland, MA|isbn=978-1-60535-353-1|edition=Sixth}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Each plant has a different length critical photoperiod, or critical night length.&lt;ref name=mauseth /&gt;

Modern biologists believe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Andrés |first=Fernando |last2=Galbraith |first2=David W. |last3=Talón |first3=Manuel |last4=Domingo |first4=Concha |date=2009-08-12 |title=Analysis of PHOTOPERIOD SENSITIVITY5 Sheds Light on the Role of Phytochromes in Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice |journal=Plant Physiology |volume=151 |issue=2 |pages=681–690 |doi=10.1104/pp.109.139097|pmc=2754645 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that it is the coincidence of the active forms of phytochrome or cryptochrome, created by light during the daytime, with the rhythms of the [[circadian clock]] that allows plants to measure the length of the night. Other than flowering, photoperiodism in plants includes the growth of stems or roots during certain seasons and the loss of leaves. Artificial lighting can be used to induce extra-long days.&lt;ref name=mauseth /&gt;

=== Long-day plants ===
Long-day plants flower when the night length falls below their critical photoperiod.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=517|title=Plant Structure and Function|last1=Starr|first1=Cecie|last2=Taggart|first2=Ralph|last3=Evers|first3=Christine|last4=Starr|first4=Lisa|volume=4|edition=13th|publisher=Brooks/Cole|isbn=978-1-111-58068-1|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These plants typically flower in the [[northern hemisphere]] during late spring or early summer as days are getting longer. In the northern hemisphere, the longest day of the year (summer solstice) is on or about 21 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gooley|first=Tristan|title=The Natural Navigator|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0-7535-2311-7|date=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that date, days grow shorter (i.e. nights grow longer) until 21 December (the winter solstice). This situation is reversed in the southern hemisphere (i.e., longest day is 21 December and shortest day is 21 June).&lt;ref name=mauseth /&gt;&lt;ref name=GA /&gt;

Some long-day obligate plants are:
* [[Dianthus caryophyllus|Carnation]] (''Dianthus'')
* [[Hyoscyamus niger|Henbane]] (''Hyoscyamus'')
* [[Oat]] (''Avena'')

Some long-day facultative plants are:
* [[Pea]] (''Pisum sativum)
* [[Barley]] (''Hordeum vulgare'')
* [[Lettuce]] (''Lactuca sativa'')
* [[Wheat]] (''Triticum aestivum'')

=== Short-day plants ===
Short-day plants flower when the night lengths exceed their critical photoperiod.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=BSCS Biology|publisher=BSCS|edition=9|page=519|isbn=978-0-7872-9008-5|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; They cannot flower under short nights or if a pulse of artificial light is shone on the plant for several minutes during the night; they require a continuous period of darkness before floral development can begin. Natural nighttime light, such as moonlight or lightning, is not of sufficient brightness or duration to interrupt flowering.&lt;ref name=mauseth /&gt;&lt;ref name=GA /&gt;

In general, short-day (i.e.long-night) plants flower as days grow shorter (and nights grow longer) after 21 June in the northern hemisphere, which is during summer or fall. The length of the dark period required to induce flowering differs among species and varieties of a species.

Photoperiodism affects flowering by inducing the shoot to produce floral buds instead of leaves and lateral buds.

Some short-day facultative plants are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Hamlyn G.|title=Plants and Microclimate: A Quantitative Approach to Environmental Plant Physiology|page=225|isbn=978-0-521-42524-7|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Animal ==
{{anchor|In animals}}
Daylength, and thus knowledge of the season of the year, is vital to many animals. A number of biological and behavioural changes are dependent on this knowledge. Together with temperature changes, photoperiod provokes changes in the color of fur and feathers, migration, entry into [[hibernation]], [[animal sexual behavior|sexual behaviour]], and even the resizing of sexual organs.

The singing frequency of birds such as the [[Domestic Canary|canary]] depends on the photoperiod. In the spring, when the photoperiod increases (more daylight), the male canary's testes grow. As the testes grow, more androgens are secreted and song frequency increases. During autumn, when the photoperiod decreases (less daylight), the male canary's testes regress and androgen levels drop dramatically, resulting in decreased singing frequency. Not only is singing frequency dependent on the photoperiod but the song repertoire is also. The long photoperiod of spring results in a greater song repertoire. Autumn's shorter photoperiod results in a reduction in song repertoire. These behavioral photoperiod changes in male canaries are caused by changes in the song center of the brain. As the photoperiod increases, the [[high vocal center]] (HVC) and the robust nucleus of the [[archistriatum]] (RA) increase in size. When the photoperiod decreases, these areas of the brain regress.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson Randy J. (2005) An Introduction to Behavioral Endocrinology (p.189). Sunderland, MA: Sinauer Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

In mammals, daylength is registered in the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] (SCN), which is informed by [[photosensitive ganglion cell|retinal light-sensitive ganglion cells]], which are not involved in vision. The information travels through the [[retinohypothalamic tract]] (RHT). Some mammals are highly seasonal, while humans' seasonality is largely believed to be [[evolutionary baggage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/scienceshow/stories/2009/2762261.htm |title=Extra-retinal photo receptors |accessdate=2010-05-28 |last=Foster |first=Russell |author2=Williams, Robyn |date=5 December 2009 |format=Interview |work=Science Show |publisher=ABC Radio National |quote=...we have the evolutionary baggage of showing seasonality but we're not entirely sure what the mechanism is.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{relevance inline|date=April 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8942">{{about|the applications of asymptotic safety|a detailed introduction to asymptotic safety|Asymptotic safety in quantum gravity}}

The [[Asymptotic safety in quantum gravity|'''asymptotic safety''']] approach to [[quantum gravity]] provides a nonperturbative notion of [[renormalization]] in order to find a consistent and predictive [[quantum field theory]] of the [[Gravitation|gravitational interaction]] and [[spacetime]] geometry. It is based upon a nontrivial fixed point of the corresponding [[renormalization group]] (RG) flow such that the running [[coupling constants]] approach this [[UV fixed point|fixed point]] in the ultraviolet (UV) limit. This suffices to avoid divergences in physical observables. Moreover, it has predictive power: Generically an arbitrary starting configuration of coupling constants given at some RG scale does not run into the fixed point for increasing scale, but a subset of configurations might have the desired UV properties. For this reason it is possible that — assuming a particular set of couplings has been measured in an experiment — the requirement of [[Asymptotic safety in quantum gravity|asymptotic safety]] fixes all remaining couplings in such a way that the UV fixed point is approached.

Asymptotic safety, if realized in Nature, has far reaching consequences in all areas where quantum effects of gravity are to be expected. Their exploration, however, is still in its infancy. By now there are some phenomenological studies concerning the implications of asymptotic safety in [[particle physics]], [[astrophysics]] and [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]], for instance.

== Asymptotic safety and the parameters of the Standard Model ==

=== The mass of the Higgs boson ===

The [[Standard Model]] in combination with [[Asymptotic safety in quantum gravity|asymptotic safety]] might be valid up to arbitrarily high energies. Based on the assumption that this is indeed correct it is possible to make a statement about the [[Higgs boson]] mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Callaway|first1=D.|last2=Petronzio|first2=R.|doi=10.1016/0550-3213(87)90657-2|title=Is the standard model Higgs mass predictable?|journal=[[Nuclear Physics B]]|volume=292|pages=497|year=1987|bibcode=1987NuPhB.292..497C}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first concrete results were obtained by Shaposhnikov and [[Christof Wetterich|Wetterich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaposhnikov|first=Mikhail|author2=Wetterich, Christof|title=Asymptotic safety of gravity and the Higgs boson mass|journal=Physics Letters B|year=2010|volume=683|issue=2-3|pages=196–200|doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2009.12.022|arxiv=0912.0208|bibcode = 2010PhLB..683..196S }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Depending on the sign of the gravity induced [[anomalous dimension]] &lt;math&gt;A_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; there are two possibilities: For &lt;math&gt;A_\lambda&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; the Higgs mass &lt;math&gt;m_\text{H}&lt;/math&gt; is restricted to the window &lt;math&gt;126\,\text{GeV} &lt; m_\text{H} &lt; 174\,\text{GeV}&lt;/math&gt;. If, on the other hand, &lt;math&gt;A_\lambda&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; which is the favored possibility, &lt;math&gt;m_\text{H}&lt;/math&gt; must take the value
:&lt;math&gt;
m_\text{H}=126\,\text{GeV} ,
&lt;/math&gt;
with an uncertainty of a few GeV only. In this spirit one can consider &lt;math&gt;m_\text{H}&lt;/math&gt; a prediction of asymptotic safety. The result is in surprisingly good agreement with the latest experimental data measured at [[CERN]] by the [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]] and [[Compact Muon Solenoid|CMS]] collaborations.

=== The fine structure constant ===

By taking into account the gravitational correction to the running of the [[fine structure constant]] &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; of [[quantum electrodynamics]], Harst and Reuter were able to study the impacts of asymptotic safety on the infrared (renormalized) value of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harst|first=Ulrich|author2=Reuter, Martin|title=QED coupled to QEG|journal=Journal of High Energy Physics|year=2011|volume=2011|issue=5|pages=119|doi=10.1007/JHEP05(2011)119|arxiv=1101.6007|bibcode = 2011JHEP...05..119H }}&lt;/ref&gt;
They found two [[UV fixed point|fixed points]] suitable for the asymptotic safety construction both of which imply a well-behaved UV limit, without running into a [[Landau pole]] type singularity. The first one is characterized by a vanishing &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, and the infrared value &lt;math&gt;\alpha_\text{IR}&lt;/math&gt; is a free parameter. In the second case, however, the fixed point value of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is non-zero, and its infrared value is a computable prediction of the theory.

In a more recent study, Christiansen and Eichhorn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Christiansen|first=Nicolai|author2=Eichhorn, Astrid|title=An asymptotically safe solution to the U(1) triviality problem|journal=Physics Letters B|year=2017|volume=770|pages=154-160|doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2017.04.047|arxiv=1702.07724 }}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that quantum fluctuations of gravity generically generate self-interactions for gauge theories, which have to be included in a discussion of a potential ultraviolet completion. Depending on the gravitational and gauge parameters, they conclude that the fine structure constant &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; might be asymptotically free and not run into a [[Landau pole]], while the induced coupling for the gauge self-interaction is irrelevant and thus its value can be predicted. This is an explicit example where Asymptotic Safety solves a problem of the [[Standard Model]] - the triviality of the U(1) sector - without introducing new free parameters.

== Asymptotic safety in astrophysics and cosmology ==

Phenomenological consequences of asymptotic safety can be expected also for [[astrophysics]] and [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]]. Bonanno and Reuter investigated the [[Event horizon|horizon]] structure of "[[renormalization group]] improved" [[black hole]]s and computed quantum gravity corrections to the [[Hawking radiation|Hawking temperature]] and the corresponding thermodynamical [[entropy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bonanno|first=Alfio|author2=Reuter, Martin|title=Renormalization group improved black hole spacetimes|journal=Physical Review D|year=2000|volume=62|issue=4|pages=043008|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.62.043008|arxiv=hep-th/0002196|bibcode = 2000PhRvD..62d3008B }}&lt;/ref&gt;
By means of an RG improvement of the [[Einstein–Hilbert action]], Reuter and Weyer obtained a modified version of the [[Einstein equations]] which in turn results in a [[Modified Newtonian Dynamics|modification of the Newtonian limit]], providing a possible explanation for the observed flat [[galaxy rotation curve]]s without having to postulate the presence of [[dark matter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reuter|first=Martin|author2=Weyer, Holger|title=Running Newton constant, improved gravitational actions, and galaxy rotation curves|journal=Physical Review D|year=2004|volume=70|issue=12|pages=124028|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.70.124028|arxiv=hep-th/0410117|bibcode = 2004PhRvD..70l4028R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for cosmology, Bonanno and Reuter argued that asymptotic safety modifies the very early Universe, possibly leading to a resolution to the [[Horizon problem|horizon]] and [[flatness problem]] of standard cosmology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bonanno|first=Alfio|author2=Reuter, Martin|title=Cosmology of the Planck era from a renormalization group for quantum gravity|journal=Physical Review D|year=2002|volume=65|issue=4|pages=043508|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.65.043508|arxiv=hep-th/0106133|bibcode = 2002PhRvD..65d3508B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, asymptotic safety provides the possibility of [[Inflation (cosmology)|inflation]] without the need of an [[inflaton|inflaton field]] (while driven by the [[cosmological constant]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bonanno|first=Alfio|author2=Reuter, Martin|title=Entropy signature of the running cosmological constant|journal=Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics|year=2007|volume=2007|issue=08|pages=024|doi=10.1088/1475-7516/2007/08/024|arxiv=0706.0174|bibcode = 2007JCAP...08..024B }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was reasoned that the [[scale invariance]] related to the non-Gaussian fixed point underlying asymptotic safety is responsible for the near scale invariance of the [[Structure formation#Very early universe|primordial density perturbations]]. Using different methods, asymptotically safe inflation was analyzed further by Weinberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weinberg|first=Steven|title=Asymptotically safe inflation|journal=Physical Review D|year=2010|volume=81|issue=8|pages=083535|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.81.083535|arxiv=0911.3165|bibcode = 2010PhRvD..81h3535W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''prefabricated building''', informally a '''prefab''', is a building that is manufactured and constructed using [[prefabrication]]. It consists of factory-made components or units that are transported and assembled on-site to form the complete building.

==History==

Buildings have been built in one place and reassembled in another throughout history. This was especially true for mobile activities, or for new settlements; [[Great House (Cape Ann)|one of the first buildings]] at [[Cape Ann]] in 1624 was probably partially prefabricated, and was rapidly disassembled and moved at least once. [[John Rollo]] described in 1801 earlier use of portable hospital buildings in the [[West Indies]]&lt;ref name="Rollo"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rollo|first1=John|title=A short account of the Royal Artillery Hospital at Woolwich: with some observations on the management of artillery soldiers, respecting the preservation of health.|date=1801|publisher=Mawman|location=London|pages=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly the first advertised prefab house was the "Manning cottage". A London carpenter, Henry Manning, constructed a house that was built in components, then shipped and assembled by British emigrants. This was published at the time (advertisement, South Australian Record, 1837) and a few still stand in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=94119708 Prefab: From Utilitarian Home To Design Icon], by Jim Zarroli, Morning Edition, September 15, 2008, NPR&lt;/ref&gt; One such is the [[Friends Meeting House, Adelaide]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postcards-sa.com.au/features2009/quakers_meeting_house.html Channel 9 South Australia Pty Ltd &gt; Postcards &gt; Friend's Meeting House] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317183329/http://www.postcards-sa.com.au/features2009/quakers_meeting_house.html |date=2012-03-17 }} Retrieved 8 September 2011

The peak year for the importation of portable buildings to Australia was 1853, when several hundred arrived. These have been identified as coming from [[Liverpool]], [[Boston]] and [[Singapore]] (with Chinese instructions for re-assembly).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 1855 during the [[Crimean War]], after [[Florence Nightingale]] wrote a letter to ''[[The Times]]'', [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] was commissioned to design a prefabricated modular hospital. In five months he designed the [[Renkioi Hospital]]: a 1,000 patient hospital, with innovations in sanitation, ventilation and a flushing toilet.&lt;ref&gt;Renkioi: Brunel's Forgotten Crimean War Hospital by Christopher Silver&lt;/ref&gt; Fabricator [[William Eassie]] constructed the required 16 units in [[Gloucester Docks]], shipped directly to the [[Dardanelles]]. Only used from March 1856 to September 1857, it reduced the death rate from 42% to 3.5%.

The world's first prefabricated, pre-cast panelled apartment blocks were pioneered in [[Liverpool]]. A process was invented by city engineer [[John Alexander Brodie]], whose inventive genius also had him inventing the football goal net. The tram stables at Walton in [[Liverpool]] followed in 1906.  The idea was not extensively adopted in Britain, however was widely adopted elsewhere, particularly in Eastern Europe.

Prefabricated homes were produced during the [[Gold Rush]] in the United States, when kits were produced to enable Californian prospectors to quickly construct accommodation. Homes were available in kit form by mail order in the United States in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chetboddy.com/Pages/factorybuilt.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902005129/http://www.chetboddy.com/Pages/factorybuilt.html |archivedate=2006-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prefabricated housing was popular during the [[World War II|Second World War]] due to the need for mass accommodation for military personnel. The United States used [[Quonset hut]]s as military buildings, and in the United Kingdom prefabricated buildings used included [[Nissen hut]]s and [[Bellman Hangar]]s. 'Prefabs' were built after the war as a means of quickly and cheaply providing quality housing as a replacement for the housing destroyed during [[the Blitz]]. The proliferation of prefabricated housing across the country was a result of the [[Burt Committee]] and the [[Housing (Temporary Accommodation) Act 1944]]. Under the [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]] [[Emergency Factory Made]] housing programme, a specification was drawn up and bid on by various private construction and manufacturing companies. After approval by the MoW, companies could bid on Council led development schemes, resulting in whole estates of prefabs constructed to provide accommodation for those made homeless by the War and ongoing [[slum clearance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/interesting/prefabs/prefabs.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008181601/http://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/interesting/prefabs/prefabs.htm |archivedate=2006-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost 160,000 had been built in the UK by 1948 at a cost of close to £216 million. The largest single prefab estate in Britain&lt;ref&gt;[[Belle Vale, Liverpool]]&lt;/ref&gt; was at [[Belle Vale]] (South Liverpool), where more than 1,100 were built after World War 2. The estate was demolished in the 1960s amid much controversy as the prefabs were very popular with residents at the time.

Prefabs were aimed at families, and typically had an entrance hall, two bedrooms (parents and children), a bathroom (a room with a bath) &amp;nbsp;— which was a novel innovation for many Britons at that time, a separate toilet, a living room and an equipped (not ''fitted'' in the modern sense) kitchen. Construction materials included steel, aluminium, timber or [[asbestos]], depending on the type of dwelling. The aluminium ''Type B2'' prefab was produced as four pre-assembled sections which could be transported by lorry anywhere in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.walespast.com/article-print.shtml?id=73 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-08-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060518065604/http://www.walespast.com/article-print.shtml?id=73 |archive-date=2006-05-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Universal House (pictured left &amp; lounge diner right) was given to the [[Chiltern Open Air Museum]] after 40 years temporary use. The Mark 3 was manufactured by the Universal Housing Company Ltd, Rickmansworth.

The United States used prefabricated housing for troops during the war and for GIs returning home. ''Prefab'' classrooms were popular with UK schools increasing their rolls during the [[baby boom]] of the 1950s and 1960s.

Many buildings were designed with a five-ten year life span, but have far exceeded this, with a number surviving today. In 2002, for example, the city of [[Bristol]] still had residents living in 700 examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/main.jhtml?xml=/property/2002/03/23/prefab23.xml | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=The prefab four | first=Lesley | last=Gillilan | date=March 23, 2002 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many UK councils have been in the process of demolishing the last surviving examples of Second World War prefabs in order to comply with the British government's [[Decent Homes Standard]], which came into effect in 2010. There has, however, been a recent revival in prefabricated methods of construction in order to compensate for the United Kingdom's current housing shortage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/mortgages/article.html?in_article_id=407133&amp;in_page_id=8|title=New age of the prefab house|work=This is Money}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prefabs and the modernist movement==
Architects are incorporating modern designs into the prefabricated houses of today. Prefab housing should no longer be compared to a mobile home in terms of appearance, but to that of a complex modernist design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transportablehomefinance.com.au/transportableHomeExplained.html|title=Transportable Homes, Explained|publisher=Transportable home finance|accessdate=2008-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been an increase in the use of "green" materials in the construction of these prefab houses. Consumers can easily select between different environmentally friendly finishes and wall systems. Since these homes are built in parts, it is easy for a home owner to add additional rooms or even solar panels to the roofs. Many prefab houses can be customized to the client's specific location and climate, making prefab homes much more flexible and modern than before.

There is a [[zeitgeist]] in architectural circles and the spirit of the age favors the small carbon footprint of "prefab." Eminent amongst the new breed of off the shelf luxury modernist products is the perrinepod,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inhabitat.com/2007/08/10/prefab-friday-perrinepod/|title=PREFAB FRIDAY: Perrinepod|work=inhabitat.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has found favor worldwide for its green credentials and three-day build time.

Many eastern European countries had suffered physical damage during [[World War Two]] and their economies were in a very poor state. There was a need to reconstruct cities which had been severely damaged due to the war. For example, [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]] had been practically razed to the ground under the planned destruction of Warsaw by German forces after the 1944 [[Warsaw Uprising]]. The centre of [[Dresden]], Germany had been totally destroyed by the 1945 Allied bombardment. Stalingrad had been largely destroyed and only a small number of structures were left standing.

Prefabricated buildings served as an inexpensive and quick way to alleviate the massive housing shortages associated with the wartime destruction and large-scale [[urbanization]] and [[rural flight]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5256">An array of tandem repeats is defined as several (at least two) adjacent copies having the same or similar [[Sequence motif|sequence motifs]]. These periodic sequences are generated by internal duplications in both coding and non-coding genomic sequences. Repetitive units of protein tandem repeats are considerably diverse, ranging from the repetition of a single amino acid to domains of 100 or more residues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Heringa J | title = Detection of internal repeats: how common are they? | journal = Current Opinion in Structural Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 338–45 | date = June 1998 | pmid = 9666330 | doi = 10.1016/s0959-440x(98)80068-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Andrade MA, Ponting CP, Gibson TJ, Bork P | title = Homology-based method for identification of protein repeats using statistical significance estimates | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 298 | issue = 3 | pages = 521–37 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10772867 | doi = 10.1006/jmbi.2000.3684 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distribution in proteomes ==
Tandem repeats are ubiquitous in [[Proteome|proteomes]] and occur in at least 14% of all proteins.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marcotte EM, Pellegrini M, Yeates TO, Eisenberg D | title = A census of protein repeats | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 293 | issue = 1 | pages = 151–60 | date = October 1999 | pmid = 10512723 | doi = 10.1006/jmbi.1999.3136 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, they are present in almost every third human protein and even in every second protein from [[Plasmodium falciparum]] or [[Dictyostelium discoideum]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pellegrini M | title = Tandem Repeats in Proteins: Prediction Algorithms and Biological Role | language = English | journal = Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | volume = 3 | pages = 143 | date = 2015 | pmid = 26442257 | pmc = 4585158 | doi = 10.3389/fbioe.2015.00143 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tandem repeats with short repetitive units (especially homorepeats) are more frequent than others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Approximately half of the tandem repeat regions has [[Intrinsically disordered proteins|intrinsically disordered]] conformation being naturally unfolded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tompa P | title = Intrinsically unstructured proteins evolve by repeat expansion | journal = BioEssays | volume = 25 | issue = 9 | pages = 847–55 | date = September 2003 | pmid = 12938174 | doi = 10.1002/bies.10324 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Simon M, Hancock JM | title = Tandem and cryptic amino acid repeats accumulate in disordered regions of proteins | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = R59 | date = 2009 | pmid = 19486509 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2009-10-6-r59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jorda J, Xue B, Uversky VN, Kajava AV | title = Protein tandem repeats - the more perfect, the less structured | journal = The FEBS Journal | volume = 277 | issue = 12 | pages = 2673–82 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20553501 | doi = 10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07684.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other half of the regions with the stable [[Protein structure|3D structure]] has a plethora of shapes and functions.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kajava AV | title = Tandem repeats in proteins: from sequence to structure | journal = Journal of Structural Biology | volume = 179 | issue = 3 | pages = 279–88 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 21884799 | doi = 10.1016/j.jsb.2011.08.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Paladin L, Hirsh L, Piovesan D, Andrade-Navarro MA, Kajava AV, Tosatto SC | title = RepeatsDB 2.0: improved annotation, classification, search and visualization of repeat protein structures | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 45 | issue = D1 | pages = D308-D312 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27899671 | pmc = 5210593 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkw1136 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the length of the repetitive units, their protein structures can be subdivided into five classes:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

# crystalline aggregates formed by regions with 1 or 2 residue long repeats
# fibrous structures stabilized by inter-chain interactions with 3-7 residue repeats
# structures with the repeats of 5–40 residues dominated by [[Solenoid protein domain|solenoid proteins]]
#''closed'' (not elongated) structures with the repeats of 30-60 residue long
#''beads on a string'' structures with typical size of repeats over 50 residues, which are already large enough to fold independently into stable domains.

== Function ==
Some well-known examples of proteins with tandem repeats are [[collagen]], which plays a key role in the arrangement of the extracellular matrix; [[Coiled coil|alpha-helical coiled coils]] having structural and oligomerization functions; [[leucine-rich repeat]] proteins, which specifically bind a number of globular proteins by their concave surfaces; and [[Zinc finger|zinc-finger proteins]], which regulate the expression of genes by binding [[DNA]].

[[Method acting]] is employed by actors to evoke realistic emotions into their performance by drawing on personal experiences. Raymond Hamden, doctor of Clinical and Forensic Psychology, defines the purpose of method acting as “compartmentalizing their own feelings while playing another character [so] they could bring the emotions of that personal feeling to cry if they needed to with that character.”&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when these emotions are not compartmentalized, they can encroach on other facets of life, often seeming to disrupt the actor’s psyche. This occurs as the actor delves into previous emotional experiences, be they joyful or traumatic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt; The psychological effects, like emotional fatigue, comes when suppressed or unresolved raw emotions are unburied to add to the character,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idGrandey|Grandey, Alicia A. “When ‘The Show Must Go On’: Surface Acting As Determinants of Emotional Exhaustion and Peer-Rated Service Delivery.”]]&lt;/ref&gt; not just from the employing personal emotions in performance. The question becomes whether the actor calls up resolved or unresolved emotions in their acting.

== Psychological effects ==
The psychological effects of method acting vary in intensity from individual to individual. Some common effects include; 
*Fatigue
*Fear
*Anxiety
*Shame
*Sleep deprivation
*Personality changes
*Psychotic disorders.

Fatigue, or emotional fatigue, comes mainly when actors “create dissonance between their actions and their actual feelings.”.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idGrandey|Grandey, Alicia A. “When ‘The Show Must Go On’: Surface Acting As Determinants of Emotional Exhaustion and Peer-Rated Service Delivery.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;  A mode of acting referred to as “surface acting” involves only changing one’s actions without altering the deeper thought processes. Method acting, when employed correctly, is mainly deep acting, or changing thoughts as well as actions, proven to generally avoid excessive fatigue. Surface acting is statistically “positively associated with a negative mood and this explains some of the association of surface acting with increased emotional exhaustion.” &lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idJudge|Judge, Timothy A. “Is Emotional Labor More Difficult for Some than for Others? A Multi-level, Experience-sampling Study.”]]&lt;/ref&gt; This negative mood that is created leads to fear, anxiety, feelings of shame and sleep deprivation.

Raw emotion or unresolved emotions conjured up for acting, may result in a sleep deprivation and the cyclical nature of the ensuing side effects. [[Sleep deprivation]] alone can lead to impaired function, causing some individuals to “acute episodes of psychosis.” Sleep deprivation initiates chemical changes in the brain that can lead to behavior similar to psychotic individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt; These episodes can lead to more lasting psychological damage. In cases where raw emotion that has not been resolved, or traumas have been evoked before closure has been reached by the individual, the emotion can result in greater emotional instability and increased sense of anxiety, fear or shame.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idKonin|Konin, Elly A. “Acting Emotions: Shaping Emotions on Stage.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem seen in method acting comes from the inability of actors to compartmentalize the emotions of the character from their own in daily life. Generally the actors who suffer personality changes and psychotic disorders already have some psychotic tendencies or are emotionally unstable. Those who have [[dissociative identity disorder]] “can’t recognize that the role isn’t theirs” and, even though these individuals appear normal, they have psychotic disorders that sometimes take months to identify.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;   Dissociative identity disorder is a chemically based disorder that results from “high stress and trauma.” What these individuals experience psychologically can further detriment their chemical and physiological makeup.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;

One factor that is rarely discussed when observing the emotional effects of method acting is that the individuals that practice method acting may already be emotionally unstable. Dr. Hamden notes that “many actors have had a traumatic life, [and] acting gives [them] the opportunity to be someone else.” &lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt; These individuals are already emotionally unstable and so the effects of method acting are more severe for them. It is only a minority of people, about 32%, that will have extreme traumatic experiences.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management ==
In the professional acting field, most companies have a psychoanalyst that consults on films to give analysis and characteristics for characters. Their responsibility lies in aiding actors in understanding how the character would act. These professionals help when actors cannot relate. Their responsibility is to draw connections and pull raw emotions from the actor to connect with the character.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;   

Under professional supervision, method acting proves safe and effective. Many actors find the practice of method acting cathartic, similar to psychiatrist Jacob L. Moreno’s [[psychodrama]]. In this technique, a professional aids in keeping the individual in alignment while they achieve closure for traumatic emotional damage. The harmful situations in method acting arise when there is no professional supervising the process, such as in “cult-like” weekend courses&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;   provided by unqualified individuals that cannot monitor the individuals and keep them in alignment psychologically.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;   

This would be evident in weekend courses where the instructor promises to instruct method acting to a large public class, sometimes as many as one hundred people. The instructor would then be incapable of meeting the psychological needs of each individual in the class. Harmful psychological effects arise “when control of necessary skill falls short, [and] the balance [shifts] to the negative.” This occurs “because the [psychological] risks are in fact greater than anticipated, or because unanticipated obstacles or hurdles arise.”.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idKonin|Konin, Elly A. “Acting Emotions: Shaping Emotions on Stage.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;   The acting situation then becomes threatening and results in the unpleasant feelings of fear, anxiety or shame.

=== Correlation between acting and physiology ===
It is commonly believed that there is a strong correlation between acting and the physiological reaction to acting. According to the task-emotion theory, “the positive emotions of the actor should be coupled with a specific physiological activation. In particular, excited physical reactions were expected to co-exist with task-emotions such as tension, excitement, and challenge.” .&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idKonin|Konin, Elly A. “Acting Emotions: Shaping Emotions on Stage.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;   The emotion-task theory proposes that “the ‘action tendencies’ in characters occupy a special place and differ somewhat from [the] impulses in general behavior.” .&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idKonin|Konin, Elly A. “Acting Emotions: Shaping Emotions on Stage.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;   However, studies have been done that show that the correlation between emotions and physical reactions are moderately weak. .&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idKonin|Konin, Elly A. “Acting Emotions: Shaping Emotions on Stage.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The danger comes when control precedence “manifests itself by sudden interruptions of behavior, changes in behavior or by persistence of [character’s] behavior.”.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idKonin|Konin, Elly A. “Acting Emotions: Shaping Emotions on Stage.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;   “Control precedence” by emotions is the “feelings, thoughts, impulses, actions or activation going along with aroused emotion that takes precedence over other planned or half executed thoughts, feelings, impulses, etc.” .&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idKonin|Konin, Elly A. “Acting Emotions: Shaping Emotions on Stage.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;   Control precedence is the main concern for method acting. It proves a challenge for actors to come out of character after employing method acting techniques, sometimes altering their behavior, urging them to follow impulses that would be foreign to their own personal nature. This difficulty of returning to one’s own behavior is the common concern linked with method acting.

In [[telecommunication]], '''receive-after-transmit time delay''' is the [[time]] interval between (a) the instant of [[keying (telecommunications)|keying]] off the local transmitter to stop transmitting and (b) the instant the local receiver output has increased to 90% of its steady-state value in response to an RF (radio-frequency) [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] from another transmitter.  

The RF signal from the distant transmitter must exist at the local receiver input prior to, or at the time of, keying off the local transmitter. 

Receive-after-transmit time delay applies only to [[half-duplex operation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3018">'''Salirophilia''' is a [[sexual fetish]] or [[paraphilia]] that involves deriving erotic pleasure from soiling or disheveling the object of one's desire, usually an attractive person. It may involve tearing or damaging their clothing, covering them in mud or filth, or messing their hair or makeup. The fetish does not involve harming or injuring the subject, only their appearance.

It is related to [[wet and messy fetishism]], [[bukkake]] (ejaculating semen on someone), [[cum shot]], [[gokkun]] (drinking semen of someone), [[Facial (sex act)|facial]], [[omorashi]] (preventing urination), [[mysophilia]] (ex. fetishism of used underwear), [[urolagnia]] (urinating on someone),and [[coprophilia]], etc. Salirophilia also extends to other areas such as forcing the partner to wear torn or poorly fitting clothing and other actions which would render them normally unattractive.

The fetish sometimes manifests itself in the defacing of statues or pictures of attractive people, especially celebrities or fictional characters. It is common to refer to the practice involving ejaculating on a photo as "facepainting". This may be done with a physical photograph or the screen of a phone, tablet, or computer. The fetishist finds this sexually exciting, rather than mere vandalism and they sometimes form collections of defaced art, either created by themselves or in collaboration with others, for future enjoyment. A video of the fetishist ejaculating on a picture of someone or a photo depicting the result is known colloquially as a "tribute".

The term comes from the [[French language|French]] for soiling, ''salir''. In cases where the fetish is obsessive it is called saliromania.  It is frequently confused with [[salophilia]], an attraction to [[salt]] or salty things (especially body sweat) that derives from the [[Latin]] for salt, ''sal''.

==Mysophilia==
'''Mysophilia''' relates to soiled or dirty material or people.&lt;ref name="Butcher"&gt;{{Cite book|last= Butcher |first= Nancy |title= The Strange Case of the Walking Corpse: A Chronicle of Medical Mysteries, Curious Remedies, and Bizarre but True Healing Folklore |isbn= 1-58333-160-3 |oclc= 52107453 |year= 2003 |publisher= Avery |location= New York |page= 133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mysophiliacs may find dirt, soiled underwear, feces, or vomit to be [[sexual arousal|sexually arousing]].&lt;ref name="Holmes"&gt;{{Cite book|last= Holmes |first= Ronald M. |title= Sex Crimes: Patterns and Behavior |publisher= Sage Publications |location= Thousand Oaks |isbn= 0-7619-2417-5 |oclc= 48883594 |page= 79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible for people with mysophilia to be aroused by unclean locales, such as an alleyway, or a dirty room/bathroom; wearing the same clothing for many days at a time; or not bathing, from mere days to several weeks.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4186">The '''School of Letters''' was a summer institute and degree-granting (M.A. and Ph.D. minor) program at [[Indiana University| Indiana University, Bloomington]]. The School moved from [[Kenyon College]] in 1951 following the withdrawal of funding of the '''School of English''' by the Rockefeller Foundation. I.U. President Herman B. Wells obtained funding from the University and located the School under the administration of Dean John W. Ashton of the College of Arts and Sciences. The School opened under the direction of Prof. Richard B. Hudson and then transitioned to Prof. Newton P. 'Stalky' Stallknecht until his retirement and the School's dissolution in 1972.

==Founding of the School of Letters==
When Indiana University moved the School from Kenyon to Bloomington they maintained [[John Crowe Ransom]], [[Lionel Trilling]], Philip Rahv, Austin Warren, and [[Allen Tate]] as senior fellows, all well-known literary scholars. The Kenyon School of English was founded by three senior fellows, John Crowe Ransom, [[F. O. Matthiessen]] and Lionel Trilling and was held during a summer session at Kenyon College from 1948 until 1950. The first session of the School of Letters in Bloomington ran from June 21 to August 1, 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Arden Fitz, “School of Letters Opens at I. U.” Indiana Daily Student, 6/22/1951&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:School-of-Letters-Logo.jpg|thumb|right|School of Letters logo from the 1972 (final year of the School) brochure.]]

==School of Letters Mission Statement==
{{quote|The educational policy of the School turns on the belief that the usual college and university courses in English have not discharged their responsibility for the art which is in their keeping…They expend very nearly their entire energy upon disciplines which are philological, historical, biographical, and ideological…able students are not being trained, and perhaps not even being encouraged, to form literary judgments.

In 1954, this statement needs from correction, in part perhaps because of the School’s success; in part, too, because the School was symptom as well as cause. Departments of English have increasingly recognized, and officially provided for, the critical study of literature. More students are drawn to it, and they meet with increasing tolerance and even encouragement.

Insistence upon high standards is not to be understood as commitment to some particular doctrine of criticism. As defined by its aims and exemplified in its history, the School represents various modes of contemporary theory and practice. It hopes for that free and responsible diversity, on the part of students and teachers, from which may develop a rich and inclusive synthesis.
&lt;ref&gt;''School of Letters Brochure''(1954) Indiana University School of Letters Director's records, Collection C36, Office of University Archives and Records Management, Indiana University, Bloomington.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==The School's Impact on the Field==

Students at the '''School of Letters''' included James M. Cox '51 (later would become a faculty member at Indiana University and the School), Martha Banta '62, [[Bruce Jackson (scholar)|Bruce Jackson]] '62, Paul Lauter '55, and [[Geoffrey Hartman|Geoffrey H. Hartman]] '51. The School existed during a period of major change within the field of literary studies from the dominance of [[New Criticism]] until the rise of [[post-structuralism]]. During each session of the School high profile academics, poets, and critics were brought to Bloomington to teach seminars and deliver weekly forum lectures. These instructors included [[Northrop Frye]], [[William Empson]], [[John Berryman]], [[Robert Lowell]], [[Leslie Fiedler]], and [[R. P. Blackmur]].&lt;ref&gt;Dobson, James E.

'''Seduction''' is the process of deliberately [[wikt:entice|enticing]] a person, to engage in a relationship, to lead astray, as from duty, rectitude, or the like; to [[Corruption|corrupt]], to [[persuade]] or [[wikt:induce|induce]] to engage in [[Human sexual activity|sexual behaviour]]. Strategies of seduction include conversation and sexual scripts,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Littleton, H. L., &amp; Axsom, D.|year=2003|title=Rape and seduction scripts of university students: Implications for rape attributions and unacknowledged rape.|doi=10.1023/A:1025824505185|journal=Sex Roles|volume=49 |issue=9–10|pages=465–475|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; paralingual features,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; [[non-verbal communication]],&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; and short-term behavioural strategies.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The word ''seduction'' stems from [[Latin]] and means literally "leading astray."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oxford Latin dictionary|last=Glare, P. G.|publisher=Clarendon Press. Oxford University Press.|year=1982|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the term may have a positive or negative connotation. Famous seducers from history or legend include [[Lilith]], [[Giacomo Casanova]], and the fictional character [[Don Juan]]. The emergence of the Internet and technology has supported the availability and the existence of a [[seduction community]], which is based on discourse about seduction. This is predominately by [[pickup artist|"pickup artists" (PUA)]]. Seduction is also used within marketing to increase compliance and willingness.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Seduction, seen negatively, involves [[temptation]] and [[enticement]], often sexual in nature, to lead someone astray into a behavioural choice they would not have made if they were not in a state of [[sexual arousal]]. Seen positively, seduction is a synonym for the act of charming someone—male or female—by an appeal to the senses, often with the goal of reducing unfounded fears and leading to their "sexual emancipation." Some sides in contemporary academic debate state that the morality of seduction depends on the long-term impacts on the individuals concerned, rather than the act itself, and may not necessarily carry the negative connotations expressed in dictionary definitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abbey, A.|year=1982|title=Sex differences in attributions for friendly behavior: Do males misperceive females' friendliness?.|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=42 |issue=5|pages=830–838|via=|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.42.5.830}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905) - The Proposal (1872).jpg|thumb|220px|''The Proposition'' (1872), [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]] (1825-1905).]]
Seduction is a popular motif in history and fiction, both as a warning of the social consequences of engaging in the behaviour or becoming its victim, and as a salute to a powerful skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Villain-Hero in Pamela and Pride and Prejudice.|last=Harmsel, H. T.|publisher=College English|year=1961|isbn=|location=|pages=23(2), 104–108|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Bible, [[Eve]] offers the [[forbidden fruit]] to [[Adam]]. Eve herself was verbally seduced by the serpent, believed in Christianity to be [[Satan]]; later, Chapter 7 of Proverbs warns of the pitfalls of seduction. [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s of [[Greek mythology]] lured sailors to their death by singing them to shipwreck; [[Cleopatra]] beguiled both [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Marc Antony]], [[Dionysus]] was the Greek god of seduction and wine. Famous male seducers, their names synonymous with sexual allure, range from [[The Tale of Genji|Genji]] to [[James Bond]].

In biblical times, because unmarried females who lost their [[virginity]] had also lost much of their value as [[marriage]] prospects, the [[Old Testament]] [[Book of Exodus]] specifies that the seducer must marry his victim or pay her father to compensate him for his loss of the marriage price: "And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife. If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins."

The [[Book of Judges]] in the Old Testament describes [[Delilah]] seducing [[Samson]] who was given great strength by God, but ultimately lost his strength when she allowed the Philistines to shave his hair off during his slumber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Judges+16&amp;version=ESV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Judges 16 - English Standard Version|author=|date=|website=Bible Gateway|accessdate=24 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170718055221/https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Judges+16&amp;version=ESV|archivedate=18 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in sexual relationships ==
Males and females both implement the strategy of seduction as a method of negotiating their [[sexual relationships]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCormick, N. B., &amp; Jesser, C. J.|year=1983|title=The courtship game: Power in the sexual encounter. Changing boundaries|url=|journal=Changing Boundaries: Gender Roles and Sexual Behavior|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can often involve [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] of other individuals. This is primarily based on [[desire]], normally physical, as well as attraction towards them. Popular phrases often used include; ‘the language of [[love]] is universal’.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grammer, K|year=1989|title=Human courtship behaviour: Biological basis and cognitive processing.|url=|journal=The Sociobiology of Sexual and Reproductive Strategies|volume=|pages=147–169|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These phrases help to demonstrate the extensively pervasive and ubiquitous strategy use within [[love]] and relationships amongst humans. Individuals employing such strategies often do so subconsciously and will merely report the feelings and thoughts that they subjectively experienced and are colloquially comparable to ‘attraction’&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lamm, H., &amp; Wiesmann, U.|year=1997|title=Subjective attributes of attraction: How people characterize their liking, their love, and their being in love.|url=|journal=Personal Relationships|volume=4 |issue=3|pages=271–284|via=|doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1997.tb00145.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 'love'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marston, P. J., Hecht, M. L., &amp; Robers, T.|year=1987|title=True love ways': The subjective experience and communication of romantic love.|url=|journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|volume=4 |issue=4|pages=387–407|via=|doi=10.1177/0265407587044001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has indicated that seduction could substitute or equate to a form of collapsed or condensed [[courtship]].&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Givens, D. B|year=1978|title=The nonverbal basis of attraction: Flirtation, courtship, and seduction.|url=|journal=Psychiatry|volume=41 |issue=4|pages=346–359|via=|doi=10.1080/00332747.1978.11023994}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evolutionary psychology]] suggests that this form of sexual enticement can be used in order to cajole desired individuals to engage in [[sexual intercourse]] and ultimately reproduce. This behaviour is also aimed at persuading someone to develop a short-term or long-term sexual relationship with them. Males declare that they adopt the strategy of seduction statistically more frequently than females.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; From an evolutionary perspective this is due to females’ higher [[parental investment]] and the lack of guarantee of male parental investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Parental investment and sexual selection. Sexual Selection &amp; the Descent of Man|last=Robert, T.|publisher=Aldine de Gruyter|year=1972|isbn=|location=New York|pages=136–179|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Females therefore need to be seduced more prior to engaging in sexual intercourse. Men more commonly wish to engage in more frequent short-term [[mating]],&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buss, D.M. and Schmitt, D.P.|year=1993|title=Sexual Strategies Theory: an evolutionary perspective on human mating|url=|journal=Psychological Review|volume=100|issue=2|pages=204–32|via=|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.100.2.204|pmid=8483982}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may require this strategy of seduction used to access the female for intercourse. However, this finding has been contradicted by non-verbal seduction results which indicate that females have more control within this area.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Other potential strategies individuals employ to gain access to a mate include [[courting]] or having relatives select mates for [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] reasons.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Ultimately, both males and females have reported preferring seduction above all other strategies, such as the use of power or [[aggression]], for making a potential partner agree to sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Human mate poaching ==
Seduction is related to human mate poaching.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmitt, D. P., &amp; Buss, D. M.|year=2001|title=Human Mate Poaching: Tactics and temptations for infiltrating existing mateships|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=80 |issue=6|pages=894–917|via=|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.80.6.894|pmid=11414373}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human mate poaching refers to when either a male or female purposefully entices another individual who is already in an established relationship into sexual relations with them. This is akin to the definition of seduction in the introduction. This is a [[psychological mechanism]] which had unconscious and conscious manifestations, that in relation to evolutionary psychology has been [[Adaptive behavior|adaptive]] to our ancestors in the past and has continued to be functional in modern society.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Human mate poaching is a form of seduction, and can be used as a short-term and long-term [[Human mating strategies|mating strategy]] among both sexes. Moreover, there are associated costs and benefits to poaching. Schmitt and Buss (2001)&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; investigated the potential costs and benefits across sexes in relation to human mate poaching. Costs for women engaging in poaching behaviours include unwanted pregnancy, transmitted infection and diseases, and insecurity about provisions (shelter, food, and financial security). However, the associated benefits include emotional support that she may not be receiving from her current partner, and access to 'good [[genes]]' that the male possesses, such as [[facial symmetry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scheib, J. E., Gangestad, S. W., &amp; Thornhill, R.|year=1999|title=Facial attractiveness, symmetry and cues of good genes. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B|url=|journal=Biological Sciences|volume=266 |issue=1431|pages=1913–1917|via=|doi=10.1098/rspb.1999.0866|pmid=10535106|pmc=1690211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potential costs for males engaging in mate poaching can include resource depletion, violence and aggression from the female’s current partner, who takes part in [[Mate guarding in humans|mate guarding]] behaviours (behaviours used to protect their mate from other potential males or females). The associated benefits for males include increased sexual variety, access to [[Physical attractiveness|physically attractive]] mates, and non-committal copulations.

Evolutionarily speaking, we are derived from our reproductively-successful ancestors who managed to solve the adaptive problem of finding a mate with the required characteristics needed at that time in their lives, e.g., plenty of resources, physical attractiveness, and showing signs of honest fertility. Therefore, our ancestors would have deployed this tactic (for enticing a suitable mate), which remains in our psychology. Some evolved poaching behaviours may not be suitable for current environmental problems. Leftover by-products from human evolution, such as preferences for fat and sugar,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eaton, S. B., Strassman, B. I., Nesse, R. M., Neel, J. V., Ewald, P. W., Williams, G. C., ... &amp; Mysterud, I. .|year=2002|title=Evolutionary health promotion|url=|journal=Preventive Medicine|volume=34 |issue=2|pages=109–118|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; are not adaptive in western cultures at present, and thus similar poaching behaviours could still remain.

== Strategies ==

=== Short term ===
Short term strategies involved in seduction are associated with the [[dark triad]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paulhus, D. L., &amp; Williams, K. M.|year=2002|title=The Dark Triad of personality: Narcissism, Machiavellianism and Psychopathy|url=|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|volume=36 |issue=6|pages=556–563|via=|doi=10.1016/s0092-6566(02)00505-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; however predominately in males. Short term strategies are those used by an individual to obtain a mate for a short term sexual encounter.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; [[File:The Dark Triad Image.png|thumb|The Dark Triad, proposed by Paulhus and Williams (2002)]]
The [[dark triad]] is made up of three personality traits, [[psychopathy]], [[narcissism]] and [[Machiavellianism]] and was proposed by [[Delroy L. Paulhus|Paulhus]] and Williams (2002) .&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jonason, P. K., Li, N. P., Webster, G. D., &amp; Schmitt, D. P.|year=2009|title=The dark triad: Facilitating a short‐term mating strategy in men|url=|journal=European Journal of Personality|volume=23 |issue=1|pages=5–18|via=|doi=10.1002/per.698|citeseerx=10.1.1.650.5749}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The three traits are exploitative in nature and are used for [[Sexual coercion|sexually coercive behaviours]], useful in the seduction process. Typically these three traits are deemed maladaptive for the individual and society. Nevertheless, these traits have been found to be adaptive in an exploitative strategy in short term mating.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Machiavellianism, psychopathy and narcissism traits are adaptive for an unrestricted [[Sociosexual orientation|sociosexuality]] and [[Promiscuity|promiscuous]] behaviours.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The three traits are associated with [[impulsivity]], manipulative behaviours and lack of [[empathy]]. These personality traits would be useful in seducing a partner for a short term encounter.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jonason, P. K., Valentine, K. A., Li, N. P., &amp; Harbeson, C. L.|year=2011|title=Mate-selection and the Dark Triad: Facilitating a short-term mating strategy and creating a volatile environment|url=|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=51 |issue=6|pages=759–763|via=|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2011.06.025|citeseerx=10.1.1.648.3614}}&lt;/ref&gt; From an evolutionary perspective, these would have been particularly beneficial to our ancestral males who wanted to increase their [[reproductive success]], through seducing many women and therefore increasing their chance of passing on their genes. These particular traits may be used as a tactic for increasing success in mating.

The triad of traits, ancestrally would not have been adaptive for women, this is because, females were and still are less likely or less willing to engage in [[casual sex]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Herold, E., &amp; Mewhinney, D.|year=1993|title=Gender Differences in Casual Sex and AIDS Prevention: A Survey of Dating Bars.|url=|journal=The Journal of Sex Research|volume=30 |issue=1|pages=36–42|via=|doi=10.1080/00224499309551676}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of the lack of certainty of resources to provide for her and her offspring. Therefore, these traits are seen more in males where the parental investment is lower. Through being able to have numerous copulations with many women, this will increase the likelihood their genes will be passed on, so only investing the genetic component during intercourse. Whereas, a woman has to invest time and a lot of energy in carrying an infant and looking after him/her for many years subsequently.

Additionally, there are other potential considerations of the implication of short-term strategies. Males cannot employ such strategies without there being willing females to engage in sexual intercourse within a short-term relationship with them.  Therefore, benefits from engaging in multiple short-term matings must also exist for females. These matings enable females to practice and enhance their skills, specifically within attraction and seduction.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greiling, H., &amp; Buss, D. M.|year=2000|title=Women's sexual strategies: The hidden dimension of extra-pair mating.|url=|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=28 |issue=5|pages=929–963|via=|doi=10.1016/s0191-8869(99)00151-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often occurs during [[extra-pair mating]] when females have sexual intercourse with males other than their husband.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are potential benefits for females to engage in these matings, including the ability to acquire more resources. For example, females are better able to access meats, goods or services in exchange for sexual intercourse or if she were to give birth to a child whose father has better genes than her husband.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The evolution of human sexuality|last=Symons, D.|publisher=New York: Oxford University Press.|year=1979|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Females use these short-term matings to hone their mating and seduction skills and increase their protection. This is because males often provide increased protection against other males exploitation or from non-humans for the females they mate with and their offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human sperm competition. In R. L. Smith, Sperm competition and the evolution of mating systems|last=Smith, R. L.|publisher=New York: Academic Press|year=1984|isbn=|location=|pages=601±659|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this willingness to make the first move towards seduction and engage in a sexual relationship may be subtle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grammer, K.|year=1989|title=Human courtship behaviour: Biological basis and cognitive processing.|url=|journal=The Sociobiology of Sexual and Reproductive Strategies|volume=|pages=147–169|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, females may simply stand close to their target.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perper, T., &amp; Fox, V. S.|year=1980|title=Flirtation and pickup pattern in bars.|url=|journal=In Eastern Conference on Reproductive Behavior, New York.|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Improving attraction and seduction skills can also help a female with acquiring a better or more desirable male according to the ‘Mate Switching Hypothesis’.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is because, females are able to assess their potential mate before committing to a long-term relationship.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Alternatively, according to this hypothesis females are also able to get rid of an unwanted husband through mate expulsion using short-term strategies, such as by seducing another man into a short-term sexual relationship.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  Females may also be more equipped at deterring male partners from future [[infidelity]], demonstrated by the ‘Mate Manipulation Hypothesis’.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This hypothesis suggests that females are able to use revenge to deter future [[infidelity]]. This can be achieved by a female partaking in a short-term affair, incorporating the use of seduction, with another male as a revenge tactic for her husband's previous affair, which aims to increase commitment of her intended long-term mate.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greiling, H. (1993). Women's short-term sexual strategies. In ''Conference on Evolution and the Social Sciences, London School of Economics, London, England''.&lt;/ref&gt; These hypotheses indicate the benefits for females of developing and expanding on their seduction skills within sexual relationships.

=== Long term ===
'Strategies are defined as evolved solutions to adaptive problems'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buss, D. M., &amp; Schmitt, D. P.|year=1993|title=Sexual strategies theory: an evolutionary perspective on human mating|url=|journal=Psychological Review|volume=100 |issue=2|pages=204–232|via=|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.100.2.204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men and women differ in the adaptive problems that they face, and therefore deploy different strategies. Women strongly desire the resources and commitment that comes with paternal parental investment and therefore impose a longer period of time for courtship and use of seduction prior to engaging in a long-term sexual relationship. Women also spend time seeking and seducing men that are willing to invest and commit in the long run.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The evolution of desire: Strategies of human mating (Rev. ed.)|last=Buss, D. M.|publisher=New York: Basic Books|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that exploitative strategies will not be used when seducing a long-term partner.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The traits associated within the dark triad (Machiavellianism, psychopathy and narcissism) are not useful for long term mating strategies because they are negatively correlated with [[agreeableness]], empathy and reciprocation, which are traits promoting a healthy relationship.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Biosocial theory ==
Kenrick and Trost (1987) &lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Males, Females and Sexuality. Theories and Research.|last=Kelley. K|publisher=State Univ of New York Pr|year=September 1986|isbn=978-0887063091|location=New York|pages=69|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have formulated a Biosocial theory of heterosexual relationships which encompasses several stages of seduction. This includes five stages of natural progression:
# Individuals identify a potential partner based on desired characteristics such as physical attraction
# Both individuals establish contact
# Other traits of the individual that are not necessarily explicit are analysed to determine fitness
# A physical [[Intimate relationship|relationship]] is established
# The relationship is either successful and progresses or discontinued

Within these stages, both individuals are interacting in a game which is never explicit, this is because if either individual were to be rejected this would damage their [[self-esteem]]. Therefore, when seducing, the overarching aims and goals are never vocalised to the other desired individual. This is sometimes referred to as paradoxical exhibition.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The main goal of seduction whether it is active under [[Consciousness|conscious]] or [[unconscious mind|unconscious]] mechanisms is to impress the desired partner and display positive characteristics that are likely to be attractive, and to repress undesirable characteristics.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Non-verbal communication ===
Within the interactive seduction game, non-verbal communication is a prominent feature in accessing the desirable potential mate. The purpose of this communication is to reduce the interpersonal distance between the desired individuals.

Physiological features such as [[Pupillary response|pupil dilation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tombs, S., &amp; Silverman, I.|year=2004|title=Pupillometry: A sexual selection approach|url=|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|volume=25 |issue=4|pages=221–228|via=|doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2004.05.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; are a salient cue, expressing attraction. Leading on from this, eye contact is a very notable sign of attraction. Although there are cross cultural differences in whether eye contact is used or not, in Western cultures, the duration of eye contact and the exchange between two individuals is important in the first stages of the biosocial model.
Another non-verbal cue in the process of seduction are facial expressions. [[Smile|Smiling]] is considered another prominent feature in seduction,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andersen, P. A.|year=1985|title=Nonverbal immediacy in interpersonal communication|url=|journal=Multichannel Integrations of Nonverbal Behavior|volume=|pages=1–36|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it signifies willingness to engage in a social interaction, and in the case of seduction, to participate in creating an intimate bond. These non-verbal behaviours become synchronised between the two individuals which can then lead to the last two stages of the biosocial model.

=== Paralingual features ===
[[Paralanguage|Paralingual]] features are those associated with the voice, such as [[pitch accent|pitch]], [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] and [[rhythm]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These features of verbal communication change in different stages of the seduction process. Studies have shown that when initiating an interaction with a female, the seductive characteristics of the voice will begin with slightly higher pitch and increased [[articulation (phonetics)|articulation]] in the first meeting. However, whilst seducing, the paralanguage will alter gradually. His voice will eventually become softer with lower pitch and modulated voice. These characteristics of the voice are akin to those adults use when speaking to children, in [[Infant-directed speech|infant directed speech]]. This is vocal exhibition, which has been found mostly in males. The aim of modulating the voice is to attract the desired female and become intimate.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kenrick, D. T., Groth, G. E., Trost, M. R., &amp; Sadalla, E. K.|year=1993|title=Integrating evolutionary and social exchange perspectives on relationships: Effects of gender, self-appraisal, and involvement level on mate selection criteria|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=64 |issue=6|pages=951–969|via=|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.64.6.951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marketing ==
Seduction within [[marketing]] is seen as the relationship between the marketer and the customer that converts an initial resistance into compliance and willingness.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deighton, J., &amp; Grayson, K.|year=1995|title=Marketing and seduction: Building exchange relationships by managing social consensus|url=|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=21 |issue=4|pages=660–676|via=|doi=10.1086/209426}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marketer seduces the consumer to change from one set of social agreements into another, often opposite, set of social agreements leading to satisfaction of at least one of the pair. Information is given, so as to have a desirable and predictable impact on a consumer’s decision process. Seduction differs from enlightenment, in that with enlightenment the information is given in order to allow the consumer to enable better decision making. The terms of the exchange are unambiguous.

There is debate as to how common seduction is used within marketing, with [[Utility|utility theory]] denying it would exist at all. Others believe in a [[Consumer sovereignty|sovereign customer,]] who is free to make their own decisions without being influenced by an outside agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hauser, J. R., &amp; Urban, G. L.|year=1986|title=The value priority hypotheses for consumer budget plans|url=|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=12 |issue=4|pages=446–462|via=|doi=10.1086/208529}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seduction can be split into two separate forms, [[Confidence trick|confidence games]] (con-game) and play &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chadderton, C., &amp; Croft, R.|year=2006|title=Who is kidding whom? A study of complicity, seduction and deception in the marketplace.|url=|journal=Social Responsibility Journal|volume=2 |issue=2|pages=207–215|via=|doi=10.1108/eb059274}}&lt;/ref&gt; depending on the nature of the relationship developed between marketer and customer. In a confidence game, the unsustainable nature of the exchange is hidden from the consumer because their rewards of the exchange will not be what the consumer is expecting or desiring. The seducer defrauds the consumer by first gaining their confidence and exploiting certain characteristics. With play, the unsustainability of the exchange is not hidden from the consumer, the consumer plays along simply for the reward of playing, for instance an older child may still play along with believing in [[Santa Claus]] for the rewards. Within marketing, playing along with the seducer is seen as fundamental to the seduction of the consumer, with the consumer playing a role in the exchange. This is what makes seduction different to fraud, where the relationship is coercive in nature and the consumer has not shown any complicity.

=== Typology of ways to induce consumers to transact ===
Deighton and Grayson created a flowchart which asked five questions to determine the type of transaction.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
# "Are the terms of the transaction unambiguous?" If unambiguous and coercive, this leads the transaction to be either "theft by force" or "theft by stealth". If unambiguous, yet fair, then that is "trade with mutual gain". If the terms are ambiguous, question 2 applies.
# "Does the consumer enter a new social consensus?" If not, then this transaction is known as "[[persuasion]]". If the consumer does, then this leads to question 3. Transactions applying to question 2 on-wards are considered to be forms of marketing. 
# "How broad-based is the new consensus?" If wide, the transaction is "[[socialization]]". If narrow, then question 4 applies.
# "Does the consumer collaborate in building the consensus?" If the consumer does not collaborate and gains are lost if the consensus fails, then this is known as "fraud". If the consumer does not collaborate and the gains are sustained if the consensus fails, then that is "entertainment". If the consumer does collaborate then this leads to question 5.
# "Are gains lost if the consensus fails?" If yes, then this is a "con game", if no, this is known as "play". Both con games and play are considered forms of seduction. Therefore, as long as the other questions are followed with the appropriate answer, it does not matter whether the gains are lost or not if the consensus fails as to whether the transaction is considered seduction.

==Contemporary law==
[[File:Frank Sinatra in 1957.jpg|thumb|Frank Sinatra, 1957]]

English common law defined the crime of seduction as a felony committed "when a male person induced an unmarried female of previously chaste character to engage in an act of sexual intercourse on a promise of marriage." A father had the right to maintain an action for the seduction of his daughter (or the enticement of a son who left home), since this deprived him of services or earnings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grad.berkeley.edu/deans/mason/booksfathersfirsten.shtml Mary Ann Mason: From Father's Property to Children's Rights: A History of Child Custody] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901144641/http://www.grad.berkeley.edu/deans/mason/booksfathersfirsten.shtml |date=September 1, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more modern times, [[Frank Sinatra]] was charged in [[New Jersey]] in 1938 with seduction, having enticed a woman "of good repute to engage in sexual intercourse with him upon his promise of marriage. The charges were dropped when it was discovered that the woman was already married."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jonhs.com/mugshots/sinatra.htm "Hollywood Behind Bars - Frank Sinatra Mugshot] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120904214720/http://www.jonhs.com/mugshots/sinatra.htm |date=2012-09-04 }} [http://seduccionpicara.com/como-enamorar-a-una-mujer-casada/ - Women's seduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160813211633/http://seduccionpicara.com/como-enamorar-a-una-mujer-casada/ |date=2016-08-13 }}. Jonhs.com. 2007-02-01. Retrieved 2012-05-22.&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet has lately given rise to more open discussion on seduction and how to achieve it, symptomatic of this is the popularity of published books like ''The Rules'' for women and ''[[The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists|The Game]]'' for men.

Seduction is also associated with [[organized crime]], particularly with the [[Italian-American Mafia]], [[Russian mafia]], [[Polish mob]], and to a lesser extent, the [[Irish mob]] and [[Jewish mob]]. They often use attractive women from their gang in order to bribe, get money from, or damage the careers of male [[politician]]s, [[police officer]]s, or [[Law enforcement in the United States#Federal|government agent]]s.

The '''Seuso Treasure''' or '''Sevso Treasure''' ({{lang-hu|Seuso-kincsek}}; {{lang-hr|Seusovo blago}}), is a [[hoard]] of [[silver]] objects (14 items) from the late [[Roman Empire]]. The first pieces appeared on the market in [[London]] in 1980, and the treasure was acquired by a consortium headed by [[Spencer Compton, 7th Marquess of Northampton]]. Documentation was provided in which it was stated that it had been found in the Tyre and Sidon regions of [[Lebanon]]. It was put up for sale in [[New York City]] in 1990 by [[Sotheby's]], but was halted when the documentation was found to be false, and the governments of [[Hungary]], [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[Lebanon]] made claims of ownership. The claims of ownership by these countries were rejected by a US court, and the treasure remained in the possession of the Marquess of Northampton. [[Scotland Yard]] still has an open case on the matter.

The origin and [[provenance]] of the treasure are likely known, but not publicly acknowledged. There is much scientific evidence to indicate that the hoard was first acquired in the 1970s after the murder of a Hungarian soldier, who discovered the treasure during illicit digging at an established archaeological site in Hungary.&lt;ref name="Time Team"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/time-team-specials/episode-guide/series-119/episode-3 |title=Time Team Specials – The Mystery of the Roman Treasure – Channel 4 |publisher=channel4.com|accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 March 2014 [[Prime Minister of Hungary]] [[Viktor Orbán]] announced that half of the Seuso Treasure (seven items) had been bought by Hungary.&lt;ref name="ReturnToHungary1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hvg.hu/itthon/20140326_Orban_Magyarorszag_visszaszerezte_a_Seuso#rss |title=Orbán: Magyarország visszaszerezte a Seuso-kincset |publisher=hvg.hu |date=26 March 2014 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReturnToHungary2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idahostatesman.com/2014/03/26/3101774/hungary-buys-back-7-roman-era.html?sp=/99/109/ |title=Hungary buys back 7 Roman-era silver trays, jugs|publisher=idahostatesman.com |date=26 March 2014 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prime Minister described it as "Hungary's family silverware".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbj.hu/budapest/sevso-treasure-hungarys-family-silverware-returned_77609 |title=Sevso Treasure, "Hungary's family silverware," returned |publisher=Budapest Business Journal |date=26 March 2014 |accessdate=2014-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2017 the remaining seven artifacts also got back to Hungary, for a sum of €28 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hvg.hu/kultura/20170712_Baan_hetek_ota_itthon_van_a_Seusokincs_a_TEK_hozta_haza |title=Baán: Hetek óta itthon van a Seuso-kincs, a TEK hozta haza |publisher=HVG |date=12 July 2017 |accessdate=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The [[treasure trove]] consists of 14 large decorated silver vessels and the copper cauldron which contained them, and has been dated to the late 4th or early 5th century AD. Most notable is a large dish, 70&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter and weighing nearly 9&amp;nbsp;kg, which bears the inscription:

: ''Hec Sevso tibi durent per saecula multa''
: ''Posteris ut prosint vascula digna tuis''

: May these, O Seuso, yours for many ages be
: Small vessels fit to serve your offspring worthily.

==Discovery==
[[File:Sümegh józsef 02.jpg|thumb|right|190px|József Sümegh, who is claimed to have found the treasure around 1975–76 near Polgárdi]]The hoard first came to attention in 1980, when a single piece in the possession of two antiquities' dealers from [[Vienna]] was offered for sale in London. Further pieces reached the market, and what is believed to be the complete hoard was acquired by a consortium headed by [[Spencer Compton, 7th Marquess of Northampton]].&lt;ref name="ATG"&gt;[http://www.antiquestradegazette.com/news/news_article_main.asp?id=6000&amp;pt=nb&amp;article_type=stoppress&amp;cp=1&amp;keywords=&amp;phrase=no Antiques Trade Gazette] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929001509/http://www.antiquestradegazette.com/news/news_article_main.asp?id=6000&amp;pt=nb&amp;article_type=stoppress&amp;cp=1&amp;keywords=&amp;phrase=no |date=2007-09-29 }}, 30 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Documentation supplied by the Lebanese embassy in Switzerland stated that the treasure had originally been found in the [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]] regions of Lebanon, and on that basis the consortium negotiated to sell the collection to the [[Getty Museum]] in [[Los Angeles]] for $10&amp;nbsp;million. When that deal fell through, the treasure was put up for sale in New York in 1990 by [[Sotheby's]], described as being from "what was once the province of [[Phoenicia]] in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]".

=== Legal wrangling ===
The sale was halted when documentation was thought to be false, and the governments of Hungary, Yugoslavia and Lebanon each made claims of ownership. Hungarian authorities claim that the treasure was discovered by a young soldier, József Sümegh, in around 1975–76 near the town of [[Polgárdi]] in central Hungary. Sümegh's dead body was found in a nearby cellar in 1980. The official investigation at the time determined that he had committed suicide, but later the police came to the conclusion that he had been killed.&lt;ref name = "Múlt-Kor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mult-kor.hu/cikk.php?id=20036&amp;pIdx=2 |title=Helyi divattal igazolják a Seuso-kincsek eredetét – Hírek – Múlt-kor történelmi magazin |publisher=mult-kor.hu|accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012 the criminal investigation is still ongoing.&lt;ref name = "HVG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hvg.hu/itthon.bunugy/20120803_seuso_gyilkossag |title=Bűnügy: Bors: újra nyomoz az NNI a Seuso-kincseket megtaláló Sümegh meggyilkolása ügyében – HVG.hu |publisher=hvg.hu|accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yugoslavia's case was based on claims that the treasure had been originally found on 30 June 1960, in the village of [[Barbariga, Croatia|Barbariga]] in [[Istria]] (present-day [[Croatia]]).&lt;ref name="jutarnji"/&gt; The village is some 20 kilometres north of the city of [[Pula]], an important city in Roman times. According to local witnesses, the treasure had been discovered in old trenches in a nearby [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) compound.&lt;ref name="jutarnji"/&gt; In the 1980s the JNA gave permission to local archeologists, led by [[Vesna Girardi-Jurkić]], to further excavate the site. According to unconfirmed eyewitness reports of army excavations, the 14 known artefacts were only a small part of a much larger treasure trove as it took soldiers and police brought to the site six days to list all the items found at the site. However, very few details of the project were ever released to the public as the alleged site was entirely within a military area closed off to civilians.&lt;ref name="jutarnji"/&gt; Yugoslav archaeologists' efforts eventually failed to provide any conclusive evidence for the treasure's origin, although the soil residue found on the artefacts was proved to match the samples of soil from the area.&lt;ref name="jutarnji"/&gt; After the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] the newly independent Croatia pressed on with the case and included the results of the soil analysis in its formal ownership claim to a New York court.&lt;ref name="jutarnji"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peritz|first1=Romina|title=Borba za neprocjenjivo Seusovo blago|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/borba-za-neprocjenjivo-seusovo-blago-%E2%80%98do-zadnjeg-smo-vjerovali-da-jehrvatsko%E2%80%99/988673/|accessdate=7 October 2016|work=[[Jutarnji list]]|language=Croatian|date=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hyppolitus készlet.jpg|thumb|The Hippolytus set]]

In November 1993, the [[New York Court of Appeals]] rejected the claims, and found no case for removing it from the possession of the Marquess of Northampton 1987 Settlement (a trust established by the Marquess of Northampton).&lt;ref&gt;''Republic of Croatia, et al. v. Trustee of the Marquess of Northampton 1987 Settlement'', 203 A.D.2d 167, 610 N.Y.S.2d 263 (1994); ''Republic of Croatia, et al. v. Trustee of the Marquess of Northampton 1987 Settlement'', 232 A.D.2d 616, 648 N.Y.S.2d 25 (1st Dep't 1996).)&lt;/ref&gt; The silver was locked away in a bank vault while further legal proceedings followed. The Marquess sued his solicitors [[Allen &amp; Overy]] for damages in relation to advice given during the purchase of the silver, and that case was settled out of court in 1999 for a reported £15&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 8 May 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 June 1999, in written answers to questions in the [[House of Lords]], the British government confirmed that it had no further interest in the case and confirmed the decision not to prosecute.&lt;ref name="Stationery"&gt;{{cite hansard|jurisdiction=United Kingdom|house=[[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]|title=Sevso Case: Decision not to Prosecute|url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199899/ldhansrd/vo990625/text/90625w01.htm|date=25 June 1999|column=WA111|access-date=2018-09-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012090039/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199899/ldhansrd/vo990625/text/90625w01.htm|archive-date=2006-10-12|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hungarian claim of possession is likely justified by the fact that on one of the main plates, the "Hunting Plate", an inscription is to be seen. It reads "Pelso", the Roman name for [[Lake Balaton]] in Hungary; the lake is just west of the alleged place of discovery.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book |title=Who Owns the Past?: Cultural Policy, Cultural Property, and the Law|author1=Gibbon, K.F. |author2=American Council for Cultural Policy|date=2005|publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=9780813536873 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PigTNxl30ZgC&amp;pg=PA94|page=94 |accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also near to the lake, in 1873 a Roman [[tripod]] (later restored, upon which it was discovered that it is a quadripod) was discovered; according to scholars, this object featured similar decoration as the Seuso Treasure items, and is very likely a creation of the same hands. It is housed in the [[Hungarian National Museum]] in [[Budapest]].&lt;ref name="theatlantic"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2001/11/the-curse-of-the-sevso-silver/302331/|title=The Curse of the Sevso Silver – The Atlantic|publisher=theatlantic.com|accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later developments===
In September 2006, London auctioneer [[Bonhams]] announced that it would exhibit the treasure privately, in a move seen as a prelude to a sale by private treaty or by auction at a future date.&lt;ref name="ATG" /&gt; A spokesman for the [[Minister of Education (Hungary)|Ministry of Education and Culture]] of Hungary, which still claims it, said it had informed British authorities that it must not be sold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.hu/culture/history/news/D999_news_200486.html "Sevso Treasure Up For Sale" at culture.hu – Hungarian Ministry of Education and Culture.]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 October 2006, further written answers were given in the House of Lords to questions by [[Colin Renfrew, Baron Renfrew of Kaimsthorn]], particularly relating to Hungary's possible revised claim to the treasure since its [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|admission to the European Union]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61012w0001.htm ''Hansard''] 12 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Bonhams went ahead with its private exhibition on 17 October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theartnewspaper.com/afrontpage/pdf/tancurrent.pdf Art Newspaper], [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2393777,00.html Times] and [http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1924109,00.html Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vadász tál - Seuso kiállítás, Országház (3).JPG|thumb|right|The "Hunting plate" in the [[Hungarian Parliament Building]]]]

In March 2007, ''[[The Art Newspaper]]'' reported that a further "187 silvergilt spoons, 37 silvergilt drinking cups, and 5 silver bowls", previously unknown, but part of the original hoard, were reputed to exist.&lt;ref name="theartnewspaper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/article01.asp?id=581 |title=The silver missing from the Sevso hoard? |publisher=theartnewspaper.com |accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research presented in February 2008 by the Hungarian archaeologist Zsolt Visy strengthened the view that the origin of the treasure may be the Lake Balaton region of Hungary.&lt;ref name="archaeology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.co.uk/blog/lisa-westcott/sevso-treasure.htm |title=Archaeology of the Sevso Treasure &amp;#124; Current Archaeology  |publisher=archaeology.co.uk|accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Channel 4]] archaeology programme ''[[Time Team]]'' aired a [[Time Team (specials)#2008|special on the treasure]] in December 2008.&lt;ref name="channel4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/time-team-specials/episode-guide |title=Time Team Specials – Episode Guide – Channel 4  |publisher=channel4.com|accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme presented Hungary's evidence for the likely origin of the hoard being near the town of [[Polgárdi]]. The Marquess of Northampton withdrew from planned participation in the programme and Channel 4 was not given permission to film the treasure, held in a vault at Bonhams auctioneers in London.

==Return to Hungary==
On 26 March 2014, [[Viktor Orbán]], the Hungarian prime minister, announced that half of the Seuso Treasure (seven items) had been returned to Hungary, for a sum of €15 million.&lt;ref name="ReturnToHungary1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReturnToHungary2" /&gt; The seven artifacts were put on temporary display at the [[Hungarian Parliament Building]] on 29 March 2014. On 12 July 2017, the [[List of Prime Ministers of Hungary|Hungarian PM]] announced that another seven pieces had been brought back to Hungary, and will be displayed together with the seven items returned to Hungary in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hvg.hu/itthon/20170712_orban_seuso_kincs_hazakerult#rss |title=Orbán: Hazakerült a Seuso-kincsek további hét darabja |publisher=hvg.hu |date=12 July 2017 |accessdate=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The items will be moved to the Budapest [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]] by 2018, where they are intended to be a centrepiece of the new museum's quarter.

[[File:Space Engineers 5.jpg|thumb|''Space Engineers'' video game: 3D spatial navigation]]
'''Spatial ability''' or visuo-spatial ability is the capacity to understand, reason and remember the spatial relations among objects or space.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://web.jhu.edu/cty/STBguide.pdf|title = Spatial ability|date = |accessdate = |website = www.jhu.edu|publisher = Johns Hopkins University|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Visual-spatial abilities are used for everyday use from navigation, understanding or fixing equipment, understanding or estimating distance and measurement, and performing on a job. Spatial abilities are also important for success in fields such as sports, technical aptitude, [[mathematics]], natural sciences, [[engineering]], economic forecasting, [[meteorology]], [[chemistry]] and [[physics]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://web.jhu.edu/cty/STBguide.pdf|title = What is spatial ability?|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Johns Hopkins University|author = Johns Hopkins University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Women in Science and Mathematics|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK23762/|date = 2006-01-01|first = National Academy of Sciences|last = (us)|first2 = National Academy of Engineering|last2 = (us)|first3 = and Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Maximizing the Potential of Women in Academic Science and|last3 = Engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only do spatial abilities involve understanding the outside world, but they also involve processing outside information and reasoning with it through visual representation in the mind.

== Definition and types ==
Spatial ability is the capacity to understand, reason and remember the spatial relations among objects or space.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are four common types of spatial abilities which include spatial or visuo-spatial perception, spatial visualization, mental folding and [[mental rotation]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Impact of cognitive imaging and sex differences on the development of laparoscopic suturing skills|journal = Canadian Journal of Surgery|date = 2005-10-01|issn = 0008-428X|pmc = 3211902|pmid = 16248138|pages = 387–393|volume = 48|issue = 5|first = Tyrone|last = Donnon|first2 = Jean-Gaston|last2 = DesCôteaux|first3 = Claudio|last3 = Violato}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these abilities have unique properties and importance to many types of tasks whether in certain jobs or everyday life. For example, spatial perception is defined as the ability to perceive spatial relationships in respect to the orientation of one's body despite distracting information.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Emergence and Characterization of Sex Differences in Spatial Ability: A Meta-Analysis|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/19086027_Emergence_and_Characterization_of_Sex_Differences_in_Spatial_Ability_A_Meta-Analysis|journal = Child Development|pages = 1479–1498|volume = 56|issue = 6|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.1985.tb00213.x|first = Marcia C.|last = Linn|first2 = Anne C.|last2 = Petersen}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[mental rotation]] on the other hand is the mental ability to manipulate and rotate 2D or 3D objects in space quickly and accurately.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Lastly, spatial visualization is characterized as complicated multi-step manipulations of spatially presented information.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; These three abilities are mediated and supported by a fourth spatial cognitive factor known as spatial working memory. [[Spatial memory|Spatial working memory]] is the ability to temporarily store a certain amount of visual-spatial memories under attentional control in order to complete a task.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Comparison of Laboratory and Clinical Working Memory Tests and Their Prediction of Fluid Intelligence|journal = Intelligence|date = 2009-05-01|issn = 0160-2896|pmc = 2818304|pmid = 20161647|pages = 283|volume = 37|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.intell.2008.11.005|first = Jill T.|last = Shelton|first2 = Emily M.|last2 = Elliott|first3 = B.

Spatial perception is defined as the ability to perceive spatial relationships in respect to the orientation of one's body despite distracting information.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It consists of being able to perceive and visually understand outside spatial information such as features, properties, measurement, shapes, position and motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~asimmons/pdfs/PT%20Spatial%20Perception.pdf|title = Spatial Perception from a Cartesian Point of View|last = Simmons|first = Alison|date = 2003|journal = Philosophical Topics |volume=31|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when one is navigating through a dense forest they are using spatial perception and awareness. Another example is when trying to understand the relations and mechanics inside of a car, he or she is relying on their spatial perception to understand its visual framework. Tests that measure spatial perception include the [[rod and frame test]], where subjects must place a rod vertically while viewing a frame orientation of 22 degrees in angle, or the [[water-level task]], where subjects have to draw or identify a horizontal line in a tilted bottle.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Spatial perception is also very relevant in sports. For example, a study found that [[cricket]] players who were faster at picking up information from briefly presented visual displays were significantly better batsmen in an actual game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Inspection time and high-speed ball games|journal = Perception|date = 1989-01-01|issn = 0301-0066|pmid = 2628929|pages = 789–792|volume = 18|issue = 6|first = I. J.|last = Deary|first2 = H.|last2 = Mitchell|doi=10.1068/p180789}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 study published in the ''[[Journal of Vision]]'' found that soccer players had higher perceptual ability for body kinematics such as processing multitasking crowd scenes which involve pedestrians crossing a street or complex dynamic visual scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Assessment of sport specific and non-specific biological motion perception in soccer athletes shows a fundamental perceptual ability advantage over non-athletes for recognizing body kinematics|journal = Journal of Vision|date = 2015-09-01|issn = 1534-7362|pmid = &lt;!--none--&gt;|pages = 504|volume = 15|issue = 12|doi = 10.1167/15.12.504|first = Thomas|last = Romeas|first2 = Jocelyn|last2 = Faubert}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study published in the ''Journal of Human Kinetics'' on fencing athletes found that achievement level was highly correlated with spatial perceptual skills such as visual discrimination, visual-spatial relationships, visual sequential memory, narrow attentional focus and visual information processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Attention, Visual Perception and their Relationship to Sport Performance in Fencing|journal = Journal of Human Kinetics|date = 2013-12-31|issn = 1640-5544|pmc = 3916930|pmid = 24511355|pages = 195–201|volume = 39|doi = 10.2478/hukin-2013-0082|first = Mona Mohamed Kamal|last = Hijazi}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review published in the journal of ''[[Neuropsychologia]]'' found that spatial perception involves attributing meaning to an object or space, so that their sensory processing is actually part of semantic processing of the incoming visual information.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Visual cognition: a new look at the two-visual systems model|journal = Neuropsychologia|date = 2005-01-01|issn = 0028-3932|pmid = 15707914|pages = 301–312|volume = 43|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2004.11.016|first = M.|last = Jeannerod|first2 = P.|last2 = Jacob}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review also found that spatial perception involves the [[Visual system|human visual system]] in the brain and the [[Parietal lobe|parietal lobule]] which is responsible for visuomotor processing and visually goal-directed action.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Studies have also found that individuals who played first person shooting games had better spatial perceptual skills like faster and more accurate performance in a peripheral and identification task while simultaneously performing a central search.&lt;ref name="Wu 673–686"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Playing shooter and driving videogames improves top-down guidance in visual search|journal = Attention, Perception, &amp; Psychophysics|date = 2013-05-01|issn = 1943-393X|pmid = 23460295|pages = 673–686|volume = 75|issue = 4|doi = 10.3758/s13414-013-0440-2|first = Sijing|last = Wu|first2 = Ian|last2 = Spence}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers suggested that, in addition to enhancing the ability to divide attention, playing  action games significantly enhances perceptual skills like top-down guidance of attention to possible target locations.&lt;ref name="Wu 673–686" /&gt;

=== Mental rotation ===
[[File:Rubik's cube 2.svg|thumb|[[Rubik's cube]]: a popular puzzle that involves 3D mental rotation]][[Mental rotation]] is the ability to mentally represent and ''rotate'' 2D and 3D objects in space quickly and accurately, while the object's features remain unchanged. Mental representations of physical objects can help utilize problem solving and understanding. For example, Hegarty (2004) showed that people manipulate mental representations for reasoning about mechanical problems, such as how gears or pulleys work.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Online Psychology Laboratory - About Mental Rotation|url = http://opl.apa.org/Experiments/About/AboutMentalRotation.aspx|website = opl.apa.org|accessdate = 2016-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Schwartz and Black (1999) found that doing such mental simulations such as pouring water improves people's skill to find the solution to questions about the amount of tilt required for containers of different heights and widths.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the field of sports psychology, coaches for a variety of sports (e.g. basketball, gymnastics, soccer or golf) have promoted players to use mental imagery and manipulation as one technique for performance in their game. (Jones &amp; Stuth, 1997)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Recent research (e.g., Cherney, 2008) has also demonstrated evidence that playing video games with consistent practice can improve mental rotation skills, for example improvements in women's scores  after practice with a game that involved a race within a 3-D environment.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Same effects have been seen playing action video games such as [[Unreal Tournament]] as well as the popular mainstream game [[Tetris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The virtual brain: 30 years of video-game play and cognitive abilities|journal = Frontiers in Psychology|date = 2013-09-13|issn = 1664-1078|pmc = 3772618|pmid = 24062712|volume = 4|doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00629|first = Andrew J.|last = Latham|first2 = Lucy L. M.|last2 = Patston|first3 = Lynette J.|last3 = Tippett}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jigsaw puzzle|Jigsaw]] puzzles and [[Rubik's Cube|Rubik's cube]] are also activities that involve higher level of mental rotation and can be practiced to improve spatial abilities over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Early Puzzle Play: A predictor of preschoolers’ spatial transformation skill|journal = Developmental Psychology|date = 2012-03-01|issn = 0012-1649|pmc = 3289766|pmid = 22040312|pages = 530–542|volume = 48|issue = 2|doi = 10.1037/a0025913|first = S.C.|last = Levine|first2 = K.R.|last2 = Ratliff|first3 = J.|last3 = Huttenlocher|first4 = J.|last4 = Cannon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Talent in autism: hyper-systemizing, hyper-attention to detail and sensory hypersensitivity|journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date = 2009-05-27|issn = 0962-8436|pmc = 2677592|pmid = 19528020|pages = 1377–1383|volume = 364|issue = 1522|doi = 10.1098/rstb.2008.0337|first = Simon|last = Baron-Cohen|first2 = Emma|last2 = Ashwin|first3 = Chris|last3 = Ashwin|first4 = Teresa|last4 = Tavassoli|first5 = Bhismadev|last5 = Chakrabarti}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Adolescence: The Transitional Years|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sz20BQAAQBAJ|publisher = Academic Press|date = 2014-05-10|isbn = 9781483265650|first = J. Roy|last = Hopkins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mental rotation is also unique and distinct from the other spatial abilities because it also involves areas associated with [[Motor skill|motor simulation]] in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Neuroimaging studies of mental rotation: a meta-analysis and review|journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|date = 2008-01-01|issn = 0898-929X|pmid = 17919082|pages = 1–19|volume = 20|issue = 1|doi = 10.1162/jocn.2008.20013|first = Jeffrey M.|last = Zacks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spatial visualization ===
Spatial visualization is characterized as complicated multi-step manipulations of spatially presented information.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; It involves [[Mental image|visual imagery]] which is the ability to mentally represent visual appearances of an object, and [[Mental image|spatial imagery]] which consists of mentally representing spatial relations between the parts or locations of the objects or movements.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://ideal-group.org/visualization-research/Spatial-Visualization-Visual-Imagery-and-Mathematical-Problem-Solving-of-Students-with-Varying-Abilities.pdf|title = Spatial Visualization, Visual Imagery, and Mathematical Problem Solving of Students With Varying Abilities|last = Van Garderen|first = Delinda|date = 2006|journal = JOURNAL OF LEARNING DISABILITIES VOLUME 39, NUMBER 6|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spatial visualization is especially important in the domains of science and technology. For example, an astronomer must mentally visualize the structures of a solar system and the motions of the objects within it.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; An engineer mentally visualizes the interactions of the parts of a machine or building that he or she is assigned to design or work with.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Chemists must be able to understand formulas which can be viewed as abstract models of molecules with most of the spatial information deleted; spatial skills are important in restoring that information when more detailed mental models of the molecules are needed in the formulas.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Spatial visualization also involves imagining and working with visual details of measurement, shapes, motion, features and properties through mental imagery and using this spatial relations to derive at an understanding to a problem. Whereas spatial perception involves understanding externally via the senses, spatial visualization is the understanding internally through mental imagery in one's mind.

Another critical spatial visualization ability is '''mental animation'''.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mental animation in the visuospatial sketchpad: evidence from dual-task studies|journal = Memory &amp; Cognition|date = 1997-05-01|issn = 0090-502X|pmid = 9184484|pages = 321–332|volume = 25|issue = 3|first = V. K.|last = Sims|first2 = M.|last2 = Hegarty|doi=10.3758/bf03211288}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental animation is mentally visualizing the motion and movement of components within any form of system or in general.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; It is an ability highly crucial in mechanical reasoning and understanding, for example mental animation in mechanical tasks can involve deconstructing a pulley system mentally into smaller units and animating them in the corresponding sequence or laws in the mechanical system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mental animation: inferring motion from static displays of mechanical systems|journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|date = 1992-09-01|issn = 0278-7393|pmid = 1402712|pages = 1084–1102|volume = 18|issue = 5|first = M.|last = Hegarty|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.18.5.1084}}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, mental animation is mental imagining how mechanical objects work by analyzing the motion of their smaller parts.

'''Mental folding''' is a complex spatial visualization that involves the ''folding'' of 2D pattern or material into 3D objects and representations.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mental Paper Folding Performance Following Penetrating Traumatic Brain Injury in Combat Veterans: A Lesion Mapping Study|journal = Cerebral Cortex (New York, NY)|date = 2013-07-01|issn = 1047-3211|pmc = 3673178|pmid = 22669970|pages = 1663–1672|volume = 23|issue = 7|doi = 10.1093/cercor/bhs153|first = Leila|last = Glass|first2 = Frank|last2 = Krueger|first3 = Jeffrey|last3 = Solomon|first4 = Vanessa|last4 = Raymont|first5 = Jordan|last5 = Grafman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to other studies, mental folding has had relatively little research and study. In comparison to mental rotation, mental folding is a non-rigid spatial transformation ability which means features of the manipulated object end up changing unlike mental rotation. In rigid manipulations, the object itself is not changed but rather its spatial position or orientation is, whereas in non-rigid transformations like mental folding the object and shapes are changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Understanding spatial transformations: similarities and differences between mental rotation and mental folding|journal = Cognitive Processing|date = 2013-05-01|issn = 1612-4790|pmid = 23397105|pages = 105–115|volume = 14|issue = 2|doi = 10.1007/s10339-013-0544-6|first = Justin|last = Harris|first2 = Kathy|last2 = Hirsh-Pasek|first3 = Nora S.|last3 = Newcombe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental folding in tasks usually require a series of mental rotations to sequentially fold the object into a new one. Classic mental folding tests are the Paper folding task which is similar to [[Origami]]. Origami also requires mental folding by assessing folding a 2D paper enough times to create a 3D figure.&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt;

'''Visual penetrative ability''' is least common spatial visualization task which involves ability to imagine what is inside an object based on the features outside.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

== Spatial working memory ==
[[Spatial memory|Spatial working memory]] is the ability to temporarily store visual-spatial memories under [[attentional control]], in order to complete a task.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This cognitive ability mediates individual differences in the capacity for higher level spatial abilities, such as mental rotation. Spatial working memory involves storing large amounts of short-term spatial memories in relation to visuo-spatial sketchpad. It is used in the temporary storage and manipulation of visual-spatial information such as memorizing shapes, colours, location or motion of objects in space. It is also involved in tasks which consist of planning of spatial movements, like planning one's route through a complex building. The visuospatial sketchpad can be split  into separate visual, spatial and possibly kin-aesthetic (movement) components. Its neurobiological function also correlates within the right [[Cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]] of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01538-2|last1 = Baddeley|first1 = A.D.|year = 2000|title = The episodic buffer: A new component of working memory?|url = |journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume = 4|issue = 11|pages = 417–423|pmid = 11058819}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vocational applications ==
Researchers have found that spatial ability plays an important role in advanced educational credentials in the science, technology, engineering or math (STEM).&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://my.vanderbilt.edu/smpy/files/2013/02/Wai2009SpatialAbility.pdf|title = Spatial Ability for STEM Domains: Aligning Over 50 Years of cumulative psychological Knowledge solidifies Its importance|last = Wai|first = Jonathan|date = 2009|journal = Journal of Educational Psychology|doi = 10.1037/a0016127|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Why do spatial abilities predict mathematical performance?|journal = Developmental Science|date = 2014-05-01|issn = 1363-755X|pmc = 3997754|pmid = 24410830|pages = 462–470|volume = 17|issue = 3|doi = 10.1111/desc.12138|first = Maria Grazia|last = Tosto|first2 = Ken B.|last2 = Hanscombe|first3 = Claire M.A.|last3 = Haworth|first4 = Oliver S.P.|last4 = Davis|first5 = Stephen A.|last5 = Petrill|first6 = Philip S.|last6 = Dale|first7 = Sergey|last7 = Malykh|first8 = Robert|last8 = Plomin|first9 = Yulia|last9 = Kovas}}&lt;/ref&gt; From studies, it has been indicated that the probability of getting an advanced degree in STEM increases in positive relation to the level of one's spatial ability. For example, a 2009 study published in the [[Journal of Educational Psychology]] found that 45% of those with [[Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics|STEM]] PhDs were within top percentage of high spatial ability in a group of 400,000 participants who were analyzed for 11 years since they were in the 12th grade.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Only less than 10% of those with [[Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics|STEM]] PhDs were below the top quarter in spatial ability during adolescence.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The researchers then concluded how important spatial ability is for [[Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics|STEM]] and as a factor in achieving advanced educational success in that field.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Spatial visualization is especially important in [[science]] and [[technology]]. For example, an [[astronomer]] must visually imagine the structures of a solar system, and the path of the bodies within it.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; An engineer must visually imagine the motions of the parts of a machine or building that he or she is assigned to work with.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Chemists must be able to understand formulas which are essentially abstract models supposed to represent spatial dynamics of molecules, and thus spatial skills are important in visualizing the molecule models that are needed in the formulas.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Spatial manipulation ability is also important in the field of structural geology, when visually imagining how rocks change through time, such as migration of a magma body through crust or progressive folding of a strati-graphic succession. Another spatial visualization skill known as ''visual penetrative ability'' is important in geology as it requires geologists to visualize what is inside of a solid object based on past knowledge.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://nagt-jge.org/doi/pdf/10.5408/1.3559671|title = Characterizing and Improving Spatial Visualization Skills|last = Titus|first = Sarah|date = 2009|journal = Journal of Geoscience Education|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current literature also indicates that mathematics involves visuo-spatial processing. Studies have found that gifted students in math, for instance, perform better in spatial visualization than non-gifted students.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A 2008 review published in the journal of ''Neuroscience Biobehavioural Reviews'' found evidence that visuo-spatial processing is intuitively involved in many aspects of processing numbers and calculating in math. For example, meaning of a digit in a multi-digit number is coded following spatial information given its relation to its position within the number.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Visualizing numbers in the mind's eye: the role of visuo-spatial processes in numerical abilities|journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews|date = 2008-10-01|issn = 0149-7634|pmid = 18584868|pages = 1361–1372|volume = 32|issue = 8|doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2008.05.015|first = Maria Dolores|last = de Hevia|first2 = Giuseppe|last2 = Vallar|first3 = Luisa|last3 = Girelli}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that numerical estimation might rely on integrating different visual-spatial cues (diameter, size, location, measurement) to infer an answer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The role of visual information in numerosity estimation|journal = PLOS ONE|date = 2012-01-01|issn = 1932-6203|pmc = 3355123|pmid = 22616007|pages = e37426|volume = 7|issue = 5|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0037426|first = Titia|last = Gebuis|first2 = Bert|last2 = Reynvoet}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study published in 2014 also found evidence that mathematical calculation relies on the integration of various spatial processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Doing arithmetic by hand: hand movements during exact arithmetic reveal systematic, dynamic spatial processing|journal = [[Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology]]|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 1747-0226|pmid = 25051274|pages = 1579–1596|volume = 67|issue = 8|doi = 10.1080/17470218.2014.897359|first = Tyler|last = Marghetis|first2 = Rafael|last2 = Núñez|first3 = Benjamin K.|last3 = Bergen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 2015 study published in the journal of ''[[Frontiers in Psychology]]'' also found that numerical processing and arithmetic performance may rely on visual perceptual ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Visual perception can account for the close relation between numerosity processing and computational fluency|journal = Frontiers in Psychology|date = 2015-01-01|issn = 1664-1078|pmc = 4563146|pmid = 26441740|pages = 1364|volume = 6|doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01364|first = Xinlin|last = Zhou|first2 = Wei|last2 = Wei|first3 = Yiyun|last3 = Zhang|first4 = Jiaxin|last4 = Cui|first5 = Chuansheng|last5 = Chen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 study published in the journal of [[Cognitive science|''Cognitive Science'']] also found that spatial visualization ability is crucial for solving [[Kinematics|kinematic]] problems in physics. Nonetheless, current literature indicates that spatial abilities specifically mental rotation, is crucial for achieving success in various fields of chemistry, engineering and physics.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Spatial Ability in Learning Engineering Mechanics: Critical Review|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282853648_Spatial_Ability_in_Learning_Engineering_Mechanics_Critical_Review|website = ResearchGate|access-date = 2016-01-15|doi = 10.1061/(ASCE)EI.1943-5541.0000266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name refers to the fact that the participants will attempt to "[[spin (public relations)|spin]]" or influence the perception of the debate among the assembled reporters. The benefit for reporters is that they quickly get in-person interviews with debaters or their representatives, complete with audio, video and photos.

The earliest known spin room was set up by the [[political campaign|campaign]] of U.S. president [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1984. In a hotel banquet room, campaign officials spoke on the record with [[talking point]]s playing up their own candidate's debate performance and minimizing opponent [[Walter Mondale]]'s success, despite many observers believing Mondale had just won. This operation was dubbed the "spin patrol."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Santini|first=Maureen|title='Spin patrol' spins out|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=toNGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2229,1288893|accessdate=18 October 2012|newspaper=The Evening News|date=13 October 1984|agency=The Associated Press|location=Newburgh-Beacon, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A spin room may also be active before a debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Zeke|title=Before The Spin Room, Campaigns Pre-Wash The Press|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/zekejmiller/before-the-spin-room-campaigns-pre-wash-the-press|work=BuzzFeed|accessdate=17 October 2012|date=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common form of pre-debate spin is for each side to try to raise expectations for the opposing debater and lower expectations for their own team, a pursuit known as playing the [[expectations game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Caldwell|first=Leigh Ann|title=What's behind the debate expectations game?|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57529085/whats-behind-the-debate-expectations-game/|work=CBS News|accessdate=17 October 2012|date=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Some observers have criticized the overt nature of the [[media manipulation]] in spin rooms, and the media's willing participation in it.&lt;ref name="TribCritic"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosen|first=Jay|title=Raze Spin Alley, That Strange Creation of the Press|url=http://archive.pressthink.org/2003/11/22/spin_alley.html|work=PressThink|accessdate=23 October 2012|date=22 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lanson|first=Jerry|title=The spin room - oily engine of the political meat grinder|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/1212/p11s01-coop.htm|work=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=17 October 2012|date=12 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defenders have said reporters know it's scripted and aren't persuaded by the spin, but rather, they use the talking points to analyze candidates' strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hardman|first1=Isabel|title=A (partial) defence of the spin room|url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2015/04/a-partial-defence-of-the-spin-room/|website=The Spectator|accessdate=6 August 2015|date=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spin rooms can occasionally include moments of candor, such as when presidential candidate [[Rick Perry]] admitted that he had "stepped in it" during a debate response that became known as his [[Rick Perry presidential campaign, 2012#November 2011: "Oops" moment and continued struggles|"oops" moment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perry in spin room explains flub: "I stepped in it" (with video)|url=http://blogs.star-telegram.com/politex/2011/11/perry-in-spin-room-explains-flub-i-stepped-in-it-with-video.html|website=PoliTex|accessdate=6 August 2015|date=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spin rooms have also been portrayed as outdated in an era of instant online reaction from all quarters before a debate is even over.&lt;ref name="TwitterSpin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gaudin|first=Sharon|title=Twitter becomes new debate spin room|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9232060/Twitter_becomes_new_debate_spin_room|work=Computer World|accessdate=17 October 2012|date=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Focus group]]s and instant post-debate "snap [[opinion poll|polls]]" attempt to provide a more scientific method than spin rooms in determining who has won a debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US presidential debate: Early polls give Barack Obama slender victory|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/uselection2008/presidentialdebates/3092194/US-presidential-debate-Early-polls-give-Barack-Obama-slender-victory.html|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=15 October 2015|date=27 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clegg Beats Brown, Cameron in U.K. TV Debate, Polls Show|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-04-15/clegg-wins-top-mark-in-u-k-debate-polls-as-brown-cameron-stay-deadlocked.html|work=Bloomberg|accessdate=9 November 2012|date=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''topological quantum computer''' is a theoretical [[quantum computer]] that employs two-dimensional [[quasiparticle]]s called [[anyon]]s, whose [[world line]]s pass around one another to form [[braid theory|braids]] in a three-dimensional [[spacetime]] (i.e., one temporal plus two spatial dimensions). These braids form the [[logic gate]]s that make up the computer. The advantage of a quantum computer based on quantum braids over using trapped quantum particles is that the former is much more stable. Small, cumulative perturbations can cause quantum states to [[quantum decoherence|decohere]] and introduce errors in the computation, but such small perturbations do not change the braids' [[braid theory|topological properties]]. This is like the effort required to cut a string and reattach the ends to form a different braid, as opposed to a ball (representing an ordinary quantum particle in four-dimensional spacetime) bumping into a wall. [[Alexei Kitaev]] proposed topological quantum computation in 1997. While the elements of a topological quantum computer originate in a purely mathematical realm, experiments in [[Fractional quantum Hall effect|fractional quantum Hall systems]] indicate these elements may be created in the real world using [[semiconductor]]s made of [[gallium arsenide]] at a temperature of near [[absolute zero]] and subjected to strong [[magnetic fields]].

==Introduction==
[[Anyon]]s are quasiparticles in a two-dimensional space. Anyons are neither [[fermion]]s nor [[boson]]s, but like fermions, they cannot occupy the same state. Thus, the [[world lines]] of two anyons cannot intersect or merge, which allows their paths to form stable braids in space-time. Anyons can form from excitations in a cold, two-dimensional electron gas in a very strong magnetic field, and carry fractional units of magnetic flux. This phenomenon is called the [[fractional quantum Hall effect]]. In typical laboratory systems, the electron gas occupies a thin semiconducting layer sandwiched between layers of aluminium gallium arsenide.

When anyons are braided, the transformation of the quantum state of the system
depends only on the topological class of the anyons' trajectories (which are classified
according to the [[braid group]]). Therefore, the quantum information which is stored in the state of the system is impervious to small errors in the trajectories.
In 2005, [[Sankar Das Sarma]], [[Michael Freedman]], and [[Chetan Nayak]] proposed a quantum Hall device which would realize a topological qubit.
In a key development for topological quantum computers, in 2005 Vladimir J. Goldman, Fernando E. Camino, and Wei Zhou were said to have created the first experimental evidence for using fractional quantum Hall effect to create actual anyons, although others have suggested their results could be the product of phenomena not involving anyons. It should also be noted that [[non-abelian group|non-abelian]] anyons, a species required for topological quantum computers, have yet to be experimentally confirmed. Possible experimental evidence has been found,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Willet|first=R.L.|date=January 15, 2013|title=Magnetic field-tuned Aharonov–Bohm oscillations and evidence for non-Abelian anyons at ν = 5/2|arxiv=1301.2639|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.186401|pmid=|access-date=|bibcode=2013PhRvL.111r6401W}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the conclusions remain contested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.126807| title=Enhanced Bulk-Edge Coulomb Coupling in Fractional Fabry-Perot Interferometers|first1=Curt | last1=von Keyserling | first2=S.

==Topological vs. standard quantum computer==

Topological quantum computers are equivalent in computational power to other standard models of quantum computation, in particular to the [[quantum circuit]] model and to the [[quantum Turing machine]] model.  That is, any of these models can efficiently simulate any of the others.  Nonetheless, certain algorithms may be a more natural fit to the topological quantum computer model.  For example, algorithms for evaluating the [[Jones polynomial]] were first developed in the topological model, and only later converted and extended in the standard quantum circuit model.

===Computations===
To live up to its name, a topological quantum computer must provide the unique computation properties promised by a conventional quantum computer design, which uses trapped quantum particles. Fortunately in 2002, [[Michael H. Freedman]], [[Alexei Kitaev]], [[Michael J. Larsen]], and Zhenghan Wang proved that a topological quantum computer can, in principle, perform any computation that a conventional quantum computer can do.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freedman|first=Michael|last2=Kitaev|first2=Alexei|last3=Larsen|first3=Michael|last4=Wang|first4=Zhenghan|date=2003-01-01|title=Topological quantum computation|url=http://www.ams.org/bull/2003-40-01/S0273-0979-02-00964-3/|journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|volume=40|issue=1|pages=31–38|doi=10.1090/S0273-0979-02-00964-3|issn=0273-0979|arxiv=quant-ph/0101025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They found that a conventional quantum computer device, given an error-free operation of its logic circuits, will give a solution with an absolute level of accuracy, whereas a topological quantum computing device with flawless operation will give the solution with only a finite level of accuracy. However, any level of precision for the answer can be obtained by adding more braid twists (logic circuits) to the topological quantum computer, in a simple linear relationship. In other words, a reasonable increase in elements (braid twists) can achieve a high degree of accuracy in the answer. Actual computation [gates] are done by the edge states of a fractional quantum  Hall effect. This makes models of one-dimensional anyons important. In one space dimension, anyons are defined algebraically.

=== Error correction and control ===

Even though quantum braids are inherently more stable than trapped quantum particles, there is still a need to control for error inducing thermal fluctuations, which produce random stray pairs of anyons which interfere with adjoining braids. Controlling these errors is simply a matter of separating the anyons to a distance where the rate of interfering strays drops to near zero.  Simulating the dynamics of a topological quantum computer may be a promising method of implementing fault-tolerant quantum computation even with a standard quantum information processing scheme. Raussendorf, Harrington, and Goyal have studied one model, with promising simulation results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raussendorf|first=R.|last2=Harrington|first2=J.|last3=Goyal|first3=K.|date=2007-01-01|title=Topological fault-tolerance in cluster state quantum computation|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1367-2630/9/i=6/a=199|journal=New Journal of Physics|language=en|volume=9|issue=6|pages=199|doi=10.1088/1367-2630/9/6/199|issn=1367-2630|arxiv=quant-ph/0703143|bibcode=2007NJPh....9..199R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example: Computing with Fibonacci Anyons ==
One of the prominent examples in topological quantum computing is with a system of [[fibonacci anyons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trebst|first=Simon|date=2008|title=A Short Introduction to Fibonacci Anyon Models|url=http://stationq.cnsi.ucsb.edu/~wang/Publications/34.pdf|journal=Progress of Theoretical Physics Supplement No. 176|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These anyons can be used to create generic gates for topological quantum computing. There are three main steps for creating a model:
* Choose our basis and restrict our [[Hilbert space]]
* Braid the anyons together
* Fuse the anyons at the end, and detect how they fuse in order to read the output of the system.

=== State Preparation ===

Fibonacci Anyons are defined by three qualities:
# They have a topological charge of &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. In this discussion, we consider another charge — &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; — which is the ‘vacuum’ charge if anyons are annihilated with each-other.
# Each of these anyons are their own antiparticle. &lt;math&gt;\tau = \tau^*&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1 = 1^*&lt;/math&gt;.
# If brought close to each-other, they will ‘fuse’ together in a nontrivial fashion. Specifically, the ‘fusion’ rules are:
## &lt;math&gt;1 \otimes 1 = 1&lt;/math&gt;
## &lt;math&gt;1 \otimes \tau = \tau \otimes 1 = \tau&lt;/math&gt;
## &lt;math&gt;\tau \otimes \tau = 1 \oplus \tau&lt;/math&gt;
# Many of the properties of this system can be explained similarly to that of two spin 1/2 particles. Particularly, we use the same [[tensor product]] &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; and [[direct sum]] &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; operators.
The last ‘fusion’ rule can be extended this to a system of three anyons:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau \otimes \tau \otimes \tau = \tau \otimes (1 \oplus \tau) = \tau \otimes 1 \oplus \tau \otimes \tau = \tau \oplus 1 \oplus \tau = 1 \oplus 2 \cdot \tau&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, fusing three anyons will yield a final state of total charge &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; in 2 ways, or a charge of &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; in exactly one way. We use three states to define our basis.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nayak|first=Chetan|date=2008|title=Non-Abelian Anyons and Topological Quantum Computation|arxiv=0707.1889|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.80.1083|pmid=|access-date=|bibcode=2008RvMP...80.1083N}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because we wish to encode these three anyon states as superpositions of 0 and 1, we need to limit the basis to a two-dimensional Hilbert Space. Thus, we consider only two states with a total charge of &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. This choice is purely phenomenological. In these states, we group the two leftmost anyons into a 'control group', and leave the rightmost as a 'non-computational anyon'. We classify a &lt;math&gt;|0\rangle&lt;/math&gt; state as one where the control group has total 'fused' charge of &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, and a state of &lt;math&gt;|1 \rangle&lt;/math&gt; has a control group with a total 'fused' charge of &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. For a more complete description, see Nayak.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Gates ===

Following the ideas above, [[Adiabatic theorem|adiabatically]] braiding these anyons around each-other with result in a unitary transformation. These braid operators are a result of two subclasses of operators:
* The F matrix
* The R matrix
The R matrix can be conceptually thought of as the topological phase that is imparted onto the anyons during the braid. As the anyons wind around each-other, they pick up some phase due to the [[Aharonov–Bohm effect|Aharonov-Bohm]] effect.

The F matrix is a result of the physical rotations of the anyons. As they braid between each-other, it is important to realize that the bottom two anyons—the control group—will still distinguish the state of the qubit. Thus, braiding the anyons will change which anyons are in the control group, and therefore change the basis. We evaluate the anyons by always fusing the control group (the bottom anyons) together first, so exchanging which anyons these are will rotate the system. Because these anyons are [[non-abelian group|non-abelian]], the order of the anyons (which ones are within the control group) will matter, and as such they will transform the system.

The complete braid operator can be derived as:

&lt;math&gt;B=F^{-1} R F&lt;/math&gt;

In order to mathematically construct the F and R operators, we can consider permutations of these F and R operators. We know that if we sequentially change the basis that we are operating on, this will eventually lead us back to the same basis. Similarly, we know that if we braid anyons around each-other a certain number of times, this will lead back to the same state. These axioms are called the [[pentagon]]al and [[hexagonal axiom]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s respectively as performing the operation can be visualized with a pentagon/hexagon of state transformations. Although mathematically difficult,&lt;ref&gt;Eric Paquette. Topological quantum computing with anyons, 1 2009. Categories, Logic and Foundations of Physics IV.&lt;/ref&gt; these can be approached much more successfully visually.

With these braid operators, we can finally formalize the notion of braids in terms of how they act on our Hilbert space and construct arbitrary universal quantum gates.

Explicit braids that perform particular quantum computations with Fibonacci anyons have been given by &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.140503|title=Braid Topologies for Quantum Computation | bibcode=2005PhRvL..95n0503B | volume=95|journal=Physical Review Letters|arxiv=quant-ph/0505065}}&lt;/ref&gt;
