[[File:2014 Israeli oil spill in Evrona nature reserve (1).jpg|thumbnail|2014 Israeli oil spill in Evrona nature reserve]]
In December 2014, a '''major oil spill''' occurred in the vicinity of [[Be'er Ora]] Israel,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4600972,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; with an estimated 3-5 million liters&lt;ref name="oil3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/10/us-israel-oil-spill-idUSKBN0JO10F20141210|title=Clean-up of Israeli desert oil spill could take years: experts}}&lt;/ref&gt; of crude oil leaking from a breached pipeline, contaminating much of the [[Evrona nature reserve]]. An [[Ministry of Environmental Protection (Israel)|Environmental Protection Ministry]] official stated that the cleanup would likely take years, and that the spill was one of the gravest natural disasters in the country's history.&lt;ref name="oil1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israel-oil-spill-600-000-gallons-lost-eilat-pipeline-breach-n261386|title=Israel Oil Spill: 600,000-Gallons Lost in Eilat Pipeline Breach}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oil2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/12/04/israel-oil-spill-idUKL6N0TO20X20141204|title=UPDATE 1-Oil spill floods into Israeli nature reserve}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of this, On December 9, 2014, [[Ofir Akunis]] was appointed deputy environmental protection minister. Akunis replaced [[Amir Peretz]], who resigned from his post at the helm of the ministry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sviva.gov.il/English/AboutUs/Minister/Pages/default-minister.aspx|title=Minister|work=sviva.gov.il}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appointment, by Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]'s office, came a week after the massive crude oil spill in Israel's Arava region. Akunis said that "it is the deputy minister's intention to prioritize treatment of the ecological disaster in the south and to do all that is necessary to prevent the spread of the crude oil, and to prevent a health and environmental disaster."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sviva.gov.il/English/ResourcesandServices/NewsAndEvents/NewsAndMessageDover/Pages/2014/y%20December/Ophir-Akunis-Appointed-Deputy-Environmental-Protection-Minister.aspx|title=Ofir Akunis Appointed Deputy Environmental Protection Minister|work=sviva.gov.il}}&lt;/ref&gt; Akunis ordered crews to raise the side walls of the dams that had been built in the [[Arabah|Arava]] to prevent flooding. Thanks to the infrastructure that had already been built in the area, the risk that the oil would reach the [[Gulf of Eilat]] significantly dropped. Akunis instructed that the reserve remain closed as long as high values of pollutants were still registered in air quality tests.

In the end of December 2014, the government approved a [[New Israeli Shekel|NIS]] 17 million Environmental Protection Ministry plan to rehabilitate. According to Akunis, the NIS 17 million program will serve to treat the soils contaminated by the spill as well as help restore the wildlife populations damaged over the course of the event. As part of the plan, a special team will be appointed to evaluate the environmental impact of various [[Eilat Ashkelon Pipeline Company]] activities on both dry land and beaches. The approved plan also involves opening a closed Eilat beach on EAPC-owned property to the city's residents and visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kristinelmingforum.net/government-approves-nis-17-million-fund-for-arava-oil-spill-rehabilitation/|title=Government approves NIS 17 million fund for Arava oil spill rehabilitation Â«  Pacific Piano Performance Posts|work=kristinelmingforum.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2015, air quality tests found that there had been a 90% reduction of pollution in Evrona.

'''Agaric acid''', also known as '''agaricin''' or '''2-hydroxynonadecane-1,2,3-tricarboxylic acid''', is an organic [[tricarboxylic acid]] ([[fatty acid]]) found in fungi, e.g. ''[[Laricifomes officinalis]]''. Its molecular formula is C&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Chemical properties ==
 
Agaric acid, as any other [[fatty acid]], has an [[amphipathic]] character. It means that it has both polar ([[hydroxyl]] groups) and apolar (hydrocarbon chain) sections, and therefore, it is not completely [[water-soluble]]. It is a [[tribasic acid]], and therefore, it can donate up to 3 hydrogen ions to other bases in an [[acid-base reaction]]. Another example of tribasic acids is [[phosphoric acid]] or [[citric acid]].
It is an [[odorless]] and [[tasteless]] acid, and we can also distinguish it by its white color. Its [[melting point]] at atmospheric pressure is 140&amp;nbsp;Â°C.

== Molecular structure ==
Agaric acid is a type of fatty acid that is composed by a long [[hydrocarbon chain]] ("tail") and three [[carboxylic acid]] groups at one end ("head"). The hydrocarbon chain has sixteen carbons and thirty four hydrogens.

This acid has microcrystalline properties, and therefore, forms small [[crystals]] that can not be seen through the naked eye, but are only visible with an [[optical microscope]].

== Functions ==

Agaric acid is used as an inhibitor of metabolism in several animal experiments. It is shown that this acid prevents the formation of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; units from citrate and reduces the availability of citrate for the activation of [[acetyl-CoA carboxylase]].
Moreover, it has an important role in the metabolism of lipids, because it influences sterol synthesis.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Agaric acid induces the mitochondrial permeability transition by collaborating with adenine nucleotide translocase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.mito.2005.05.002 |pmid=16050990 |title=Agaric acid induces mitochondrial permeability transition through its interaction with the adenine nucleotide translocase. Its dependence on membrane fluidity |journal=Mitochondrion |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=272â81 |year=2005 |last1=GarcÃ­a |first1=NoemÃ­ |last2=Zazueta |first2=Cecilia |last3=PavÃ³n |first3=Natalia |last4=ChÃ¡vez |first4=Edmundo }}&lt;/ref&gt; It facilitates the efflux of accumulated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, disrupts the potential of the membrane and causes mitochondrial lumps. All of these effects bet on membrane fluidity. It's thought that agaric acid activates the opening of membrane pores due to the union of citrate to [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] transporters.

However, a later research showed that [[N-ethylmaleimide]] inhibits carboxyatractyloside and agaric acid effects. It was found that this amine restricts the pore opening action of agaric acid, but it does not affect the constraint of ADP exchange by agaric acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12013-008-9016-5 |pmid=18649145 |title=The Effect of N-Ethylmaleimide on Permeability Transition as Induced by Carboxyatractyloside, Agaric Acid, and Oleate |journal=[[Cell Biochemistry and Biophysics]] |volume=51 |issue=2â3 |pages=81â7 |year=2008 |last1=GarcÃ­a |first1=NoemÃ­ |last2=PavÃ³n |first2=Natalia |last3=ChÃ¡vez |first3=Edmundo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical use ==
{{medical citations needed|section|date=July 2017}}
Agaric acid is used in medicine as an anhidrotic agent in order to stop excessive perspiration as it paralyses the nerve terminations in the human body's [[sweat glands]].{{medcn|date=July 2017}} For example, it helps to avoid [[tuberculosis]] patients' frequent night sweats. In addition, when taken in doses from 5 to 15 grams, agaric acid produces vomiting in humans. In the past, agaric acid was used as an irritant, an antidiarrhoeal and a bronchial secretions reducer.&lt;ref name=dictionary/&gt;

=== Other uses ===
 
Physicians use agaric acid, but it also can be used in many other subjects such as [[veterinary]] and [[biochemistry]].
In lower animals, this substance depresses the nervous, respiratory and circulatory systems. It has been used as a metabolic inhibitor at the cellular and subcellular level in scientific animal experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1016/S0076-6879(81)72039-1 |chapter=Agaric Acid |title=Lipids Part D |volume=72 |pages=497â506 |series=Methods in Enzymology |year=1981 |last1=Freedland |first1=R.A. |last2=Newton |first2=Roger S. |editor1-first=Maria |editor1-last=Spies |editor2-first=Yann R. |editor2-last=Chemla |isbn=978-0-12-809267-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agaric acid has also been used as an alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor in ''[[Crithidia fasciculata]]'', which is a species of parasitic [[protist]].

'''Aluminium conductor steel-reinforced cable''' ('''ACSR''') is a type of high-capacity, high-strength stranded conductor typically used in [[overhead power line]]s.  The outer strands are high-purity [[aluminium]], chosen for its good conductivity, low weight and low cost.  The center strand is [[steel]] for additional strength to help support the weight of the conductor. Steel is higher strength than aluminium which allows for increased mechanical tension to be applied on the conductor. Steel also has lower elastic and inelastic deformation (permanent elongation) due to mechanical loading (e.g. wind and ice) as well as a lower coefficient of thermal expansion under current loading. These properties allow ACSR to sag significantly less than all-aluminium conductors. Per the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and The CSA Group (formerly the Canadian Standards Association or CSA) naming convention, ACSR is designated A1/S1A.&lt;ref name="Aluminium Electrical Conductor Handbook"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rmjtcable.com/d/file/manual/Aluminium_Electrical_Conductor_Handbook.pdf |title=Aluminium Electrical Conductor Handbook by the Aluminium Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==

The aluminium alloy and temper used for the outer strands in the United States and Canada is normally 1350-H19 and elsewhere is 1370-H19, each with 99.5+% aluminium content. The temper of the aluminium is defined by the aluminium version's suffix, which in the case of H19 is extra hard.
To extend the service life of the steel strands used for the conductor core they are normally galvanized, or coated with another material to prevent corrosion. The diameters of the strands used for both the aluminum and steel strands vary for different ACSR conductors.

ACSR cable still depends on the tensile strength of the aluminium; it is only ''reinforced'' by the steel.  Because of this, its continuous operating temperature is limited to {{convert|75|C|F}}, the temperature at which aluminium begins to [[Annealing (metallurgy)|anneal]] and soften over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pdc-cables.com/oh_annealing.pdf |title=Annealing of Aluminum Conductors |date=6 April 2002 |publisher=Power Delivery Consultants, Inc. |accessdate=2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cable which relies entirely on the steel for strength, and so can be used at temperatures up to {{Convert|250|C|F|-1}}, is called '''aluminium-conductor steel-supported''' ('''ACSS''').

===Steel core===

The standard steel core used for ACSR is galvanized steel, but zinc, 5% or 10% aluminium alloy and trace [[mischmetal#Zinc-aluminium galvanising|mischmetal]] coated steel (sometimes called by the trade-names Bezinal or [[Galfan]]) and aluminium-clad steel (sometimes called by the trade-name Alumoweld) are also available. Higher strength steel may also be used.

In the United States the most commonly used steel is designated GA2 for galvanized steel (G) with class A zinc coating thickness (A) and regular strength (2). Class C zinc coatings are thicker than class A and provide increased corrosion protection at the expense of reduced tensile strength. A regular strength galvanized steel core with Class C coating thickness would be designated GC2. Higher strength grades of steel are designated high-strength (3), extra-high-strength (4), and ultra-high-strength (5). An ultra-high-strength galvanized steel core with class A coating thickness would be designated GA5. The use of higher strength steel cores increases the tensile strength of the conductor allowing for higher tensions which results in lower sag.

Zinc-5% aluminium mischmetal coatings are designated with an "M". These coatings provide increased corrosion protection and heat resistance compared to zinc alone. Regular strength Class "A" mischmetal thickness weight coated regular strength steel would be designated MA2.

Aluminium-clad steel is designated as "AW". Aluminium-clad steel offers increased corrosion protection and conductivity at the expense of reduced tensile strength. Aluminium-clad steel is commonly specified for coastal applications.

IEC and CSA use a different naming convention. The most commonly used steel is S1A for S1 regular strength steel with a class A coating. S1 steel has slightly lower tensile strength than the regular strength steel used in the United States. Per the Canadian CSA standards the S2A strength grade is classified as High Strength steel. The equivalent material per the ASTM standards is the GA2 strength grade and called Regular Strength steel.  The CSA S3A strength grade is classified as Extra High Strength steel.  The equivalent material per the ASTM standards is the GA3 strength grade called High Strength.  The present day CSA standards for overhead electrical conductor do not yet officially recognize the ASTM equivalent GA4 or GA5 grades.  The present day CSA standards do not yet officially recognize the ASTM "M" family of zinc alloy coating material.   Canadian utilities are using conductors built with the higher strength steels with the "M" zinc alloy coating.

===Lay===
Lay of a conductor is determined by four extended fingers; "right" or "left" direction of the lay is determined depending if it matches finger direction from right hand or left hand respectively. Overhead aluminium (AAC, AAAC, ACAR) and ACSR conductors in the USA are always manufactured with the outer conductor layer with a right-hand lay. Going toward the center each layer has alternating lays. Some conductor types (e.g. copper overhead conductor, [[Optical ground wire|OPGW]], steel EHS) are different and have left-hand lay on the outer conductor. Some South American countries specify left-hand lay for the outer conductor layer on their ACSR, so those are wound differently than those used in the USA.

==Sizing==
ACSR conductors are available in numerous specific sizes, with single or multiple center steel wires and generally larger quantities of aluminium strands. Although rarely used, there are some conductors that have more steel strands than aluminum strands. An ACSR conductor can in part be denoted by its stranding, for example, an ACSR conductor with 72 aluminium strands with a core of 7 steel strands will be called 72/7 ACSR conductor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.southwire.com/products/ACSR.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://catalog.proemags.com/publication/f9b09b39#/f9b09b39/65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cable.alcan.com/CablePublic/en-US/Products/Energy+Cables/Bare+Overhead+Conductors/All+Aluminum+Alloy+Conductor.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Cables generally range from #6 [[American wire gauge|AWG]] ("6/1" â six outer aluminum conductors and one steel reinforcing conductor) to 2167 kcmil ("72/7" â seventy two outer aluminum conductors and seven steel reinforcing conductors).

===Naming convention===

To help avoid confusion due to the numerous combinations of stranding of the steel and aluminium strands, code words are used to specify a specific conductor version. In North America bird are used for the code words while animal names are used elsewhere. For instance in North America, Grosbeak is a {{Val|322.3|u=mm2}} (636&amp;nbsp;kcmil) ACSR conductor with 26/7 Aluminium/Steel stranding whereas Egret is the same total aluminium size ({{Val|322.3|u=mm2}}, 636&amp;nbsp;kcmil conductor) but with 30/19 Aluminium/Steel stranding.  Although the number of aluminium strands is different between Grosbeak and Egret, differing sizes of the aluminium strands are used to offset the change in the number of strands such that the total amount of aluminium remains the same. Differences in the number of steel strands result in varying weights of the steel portion and also result in different overall conductor diameters. Most utilities standardize on a specific conductor version when various versions of the same amount of aluminum to avoid issues related to different size hardware (such as splices). Due to the numerous different sizes available, utilities often skip over some of the sizes to reduce their inventory. The various stranding versions result in different electrical and mechanical characteristics.

===Ampacity ratings===

Manufacturers of ACSR typically provide ampacity tables for a defined set of assumptions. Individual utilities normally apply different ratings due to using varying assumptions (which may be a result in higher or lower amperage ratings than those the manufacturers provide). Significant variables include wind speed and direction relative to the conductor, sun intensity, emissivity, ambient temperature, and maximum conductor temperature.

==Conducting properties==

In [[three phase power|three phase electrical power distribution]], conductors must be designed to have low [[electrical impedance]] in order to assure that the power lost in the distribution of power is minimal. Impedance is a combination of two quantities: resistance and reactance. The resistances of ASCR conductors are tabulated for different conductor designs by the manufacturer at DC and AC frequency assuming specific operating temperatures. The reasons that resistance changes with frequency are largely due to the [[skin effect]], the [[proximity effect (electromagnetism)|proximity effect]], and [[hysteresis| hysteresis loss]]. Depending on the geometry of the conductor as differentiated by the conductor name, these phenomena have varying degrees of affecting the overall resistance in the conductor at AC vs DC frequency.

Often not tabulated with ACSR conductors is the [[electrical reactance]] of the conductor, which is due largely to the spacing between the other current carrying conductors and the conductor radius. The reactance of the conductor contributes significantly to the overall current that needs to travel through the line, and thus contributes to resistive losses in the line. For more information on transmission line inductance and capacitance, see [[electric power transmission]] and [[overhead power line]].

===Skin effect===

The [[skin effect]] decreases the cross sectional area in which the current travels through the conductor as AC frequency increases. For alternating current, most (63%) of the electric current flows between the surface and the skin depth, Î´, which depends on the frequency of the current and the electrical (conductivity) and magnetic properties of the conductor. This decreased area causes the resistance to rise due to the inverse relationship between resistance and conductor cross sectional area. The skin effect benefits the design, as it causes the current to be concentrated towards the low-resistivity aluminum  on the outside of the conductor. To illustrate the impact of the skin effect, the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standard includes the conductivity of the steel core when calculating the DC and AC resistance of the conductor, but the (IEC) and The CSA Group standards do not.

===Proximity effect===

In a conductor (ACSR and other types) carrying AC current, if currents are flowing through one or more other nearby conductors the distribution of current within each conductor will be constrained to smaller regions. The resulting current crowding is termed as the proximity effect. This crowding gives an increase in the effective AC resistance of the circuit, with the effect at 60 Hertz being greater than at 50 Hertz. Geometry, conductivity, and frequency are factors in determining the amount of proximity effect.

The proximity effect is result of a changing magnetic field which influences the distribution of an electric current flowing within an electrical conductor due to electromagnetic induction. When an alternating current (AC) flows through an isolated conductor, it creates an associated alternating magnetic field around it. The alternating magnetic field induces eddy currents in adjacent conductors, altering the overall distribution of current flowing through them.

The result is that the current is concentrated in the areas of the conductor furthest away from nearby conductors carrying current in the same direction.

===Hysteresis loss===

Hysteresis in an ACSR conductor is due to the atomic dipoles in the steel core changing direction due to induction from the 60 or 50 Hertz AC current in the conductor. Hysteresis losses in ACSR are undesirable and can be minimized by using an even number of aluminium layers in the conductor. Due to the cancelling effect of the magnetic field from the opposing lay (right-hand and left-hand) conductors for two aluminium layers there is significantly less hysteresis loss in the steel core than there would be for one or three aluminium layers where the magnetic field does not cancel out.

The hysteresis effect is negligible on ACSR conductors with even numbers of aluminium layers and so it is not considered in these cases. For ACSR conductors with an odd number of aluminium layers however, a magnetization factor is used to accurately calculate the AC resistance. The correction method for single-layer ACSR is different than that used for three-layer conductors. Due to applying the magnetization factor, a conductor with an odd number of layers has an AC resistance slightly higher than an equivalent conductor with an even number of layers.

Due to higher hysteresis losses in the steel and associated heating of the core, an odd-layer design will have a lower ampacity rating (up to a 10% de-rate) than an equivalent even-layer design.

All standard ACSR conductors smaller than Partridge ({{Val|135.2|u=mm2}} {266.8&amp;nbsp;kcmil} 26/7 Aluminium/Steel) have only one layer due to their small diameters so the hysteresis losses cannot be avoided.

==Non-standard designs==

ACSR is widely used due to its efficient and economical design. Variations of standard (sometimes called traditional or conventional) ACSR are used in some cases due to the special properties they offer which provide sufficient advantage to justify their added expense. Special conductors may be more economic, offer increased reliability, or provide a unique solution to an otherwise difficult, of impossible, design problem.

The main types of special conductors include "trapezoidal wire conductor" (TW) - a conductor having aluminium strands with a trapezoidal shape rather than round) and "self-damping" (SD), sometimes called "self-damping conductor" (SDC). A similar, higher temperature conductor made from annealed aluminium is called "aluminium conductor steel supported" (ACSS) is also available.&lt;ref name=specialpurpose&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pdc-engineering.com/oh_special_purposetrans.pdf |title=Special Purpose Transmission Conductors  |publisher=Power Delivery Consultants, Inc. |date=26 June 2012 |accessdate=2016-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trapezoidal wire===

Trapezoidal-shaped wire (TW) can be used in lieu of round wire in order to "fill in the gaps" and have a 10â15% smaller overall diameter for the same cross-sectional area or a 20â25% larger cross-sectional area for the same overall diameter.

Ontario Hydro (Hydro One) introduced trapezoidal-shaped wire ACSR conductor designs in the 1980s to replace existing round-wire ACSR designs (they called them compact conductors; these conductor types are now called ACSR/TW). Ontario Hydro's trapezoidal-shaped wire (TW) designs utilized the same steel core but increased the aluminium content of the conductor to match the overall diameter of the former round-wire designs (they could then use the same hardware fittings for both the round and the TW conductors). Hydro One's designs for their trapezoidal ACSR/TW conductors only use even numbers of aluminium layers (either two layers or four layers). They do not use designs which have odd number of layers (three layers) due to that design incurring higher hysteresis losses in the steel core.
Also in the 1980s, Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) introduced TW designs where the size of the steel core was increased to maintain the same Aluminium/Steel ratio.

===Self-damping===

Self-damping (ACSR/SD) is a nearly obsolete conductor technology and is rarely used for new installations. It is a concentric-lay stranded, self-damping conductor designed to control Aeolian-type vibration in overhead transmission lines by internal damping. Self-damping conductors consists of a central core of one or more round steel wires surrounded by two layers of trapezoidal shaped aluminium wires. One or more layers of round aluminium wires may be added as required.

SD conductor differs from conventional ACSR in that the aluminium wires in the first two layers are trapezoidal shaped and sized so that each aluminium layer forms a stranded tube which does not collapse onto the layer beneath when under tension, but maintains a small annular gap between layers. The trapezoidal wire layers are separated from each other and from the steel core by the two smaller annular gaps that permit movement between the layers. The round aluminium wire layers are in tight contact with each other and the underlying trapezoidal wire layer.

Under vibration, the steel core and the aluminium layers vibrate with different frequencies and impact damping results. This impact damping is sufficient to keep any Aeolian vibration to a low level. The use of trapezoidal strands also results in reduced conductor diameter for a given AC resistance per mile.

The major advantages ACSR/SD are:
* High self-damping allows the use of higher unloaded tension levels resulting in reduced maximum sag and thus reduced structure height and/or fewer structures per km [or per mile].
* Reduced diameter for a given AC resistance yielding reduced structure transverse wind and ice loading.

The major disadvantages ACSR/SD are:
* There most likely will be increased installation and clipping costs due to special hardware requirements and specialized stringing methods.
* The conductor design always requires the use of a steel core even in light loading areas.

===Aluminium-conductor steel supported===

Aluminium-conductor steel supported (ACSS) conductor visually appears to be similar to standard ACSR but the aluminium strands are fully annealed. Annealing the aluminium strands reduces the composite conductor strength, but after installation, permanent elongation of the aluminium strands results in a much larger percentage of the conductor tension being carried in the steel core than is true for standard ACSR. This in turn yields reduced composite thermal elongation and increased self-damping.

The major advantages of ACSS are:
* Since the aluminium strands are "dead-soft" to begin with, the conductor may be operated at temperatures in excess of 200 Degrees C (Celsius) without loss of strength.
* Since the tension in the aluminium strands is normally low, the conductor's self-damping of Aeolian vibration is high and it may be installed at high unloaded tension levels without the need for separate Stockbridge-type dampers.

The major disadvantages of ACSS are:
* In areas experiencing heavy ice load, the reduced strength of this conductor relative to standard ACSR may make it less desirable.
* The softness of the annealed aluminium strands and the possible need for pre-stressing prior to clipping and sagging may raise installation costs.

===Twisted pair===

Twisted pair (TP) conductor (sometimes called by the trade-names T-2 or VR) has the two sub-conductors twisted (usually with a left-hand lay) about one another generally with a lay length of approximately three meters (nine feet).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.southwire.com/ProductCatalog/XTEInterfaceServlet?contentKey=prodcatsheet16&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=July 2016}}&lt;ref name=specialpurpose/&gt;

The conductor cross-section of the TP is a rotating "figure-8". The sub-conductors can be any type of standard ACSR conductor but the conductors need to match one another to provide mechanical balance.

The major advantages of TP conductor are:
* The use of the TP conductor reduces the propensity of ice/wind galloping starting on the line. In an ice storm when ice deposits start to accumulate along the conductor the twisted conductor profile prevents a uniform airfoil shape from forming.  With a standard round conductor the airfoil shape results in uplift of the conductor and initiation of the galloping motion.  The TP conductor profile and this absence of the uniform airfoil shape inhibits the initiation of the galloping motion. The reduction in motion during icing events helps prevent the phase conductors from contacting each other causing a fault and an associated outage of the electrical circuit. With the reduction in large amplitude motions, closer phase spacing or longer span lengths can be used. This in turn can result in a lower cost of construction. TP conductor is generally only installed in areas that normally are exposed to wind speed and freezing temperature conditions associated with ice buildup.
* The non-round shape of this conductor reduces the amplitude of Aeolian vibration and the accompanying fatigue inducing strains near splices and conductor attachment clamps. TP conductors can gently rotate to dissipate energy. As a result, TP conductor can be installed to higher tension levels and reduced sags.

The major disadvantages of TP conductor are:
* The non-round cross-section yields wind and ice loadings which are about 11% higher than standard conductor of the same AC resistance per mile.
* The installation of, and hardware for this conductor, can be somewhat more expensive than standard conductor.

==Splicing==

Many electrical circuits are longer than the length of conductor which can be contained on one reel. As a result, splicing is often necessary to join together conductors to provide the desired length. It is important that the splice not be the weak link. A splice (joint) must have high physical strength along with a high electrical current rating. Within the limitations of the equipment used to install the conductor from the reels, as long of a length of conductor is generally purchased that the reel can accommodate to avoid more splices than are absolutely necessary.

Splices are designed to run cooler than the conductor. The temperature of the splice is kept lower by having a larger cross-sectional area and thus less electrical resistance than the conductor.  Heat generated at the splice is also dissipated faster due to the larger diameter of the splice.

Failures of splices are a significant concern as a failure of just one splice can cause an outage that affects a large amount of electrical load.

Most splices are compression-type splices ([[Crimp (joining)|crimps]]).  These splices are inexpensive and have good strength and conductivity characteristics.

Some splices, called automatics, utilize a jaw-type design that is faster to install (does not require the heavy compression equipment) and are often used during storm restoration when speed of installation is more important than the long term performance of the splice.

Causes for splice failures are numerous. Some of the main failure modes are related to installation issues, such as: insufficient cleaning (wire brushing) of the conductor to eliminate the [[aluminium oxide]] layer (which has a high resistance {a poor electrical conductor}), improper application of conducting grease, improper compression force, improper compression locations or number of compressions.

Splice failures can also be due to Aeolian vibration damage as the small vibrations of the conductor over time cause damage (breakage) of the aluminium strands near the ends of the splice.

Special splices (two piece splices) are required on SD-type conductors as the gap between the trapezoidal aluminium layer and the steel core prevents the compression force on the splice to the steel core to be adequate. A two-piece design has a splice for the steel core and a longer and larger diameter splice for the aluminium portion. The outer splice must be threaded on first and slid along the conductor and the steel splice compressed first and then the outer splice is slid back over the smaller splice and then compressed. This complicated process can easily result in a poor splice.&lt;ref&gt;http://classicconnectors.com/downloads/SD_Conductor_Concerns_for_Utilities.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conductor coatings==

When ACSR is new, the aluminium has a shiny surface which has a low emissivity for heat radiation and a low absorption of sunlight. As the conductor ages the color becomes dull gray due to the oxidation reaction of the aluminium strands. In high pollution environments, the color may almost turn black after many years of exposure to the elements and chemicals. For aged conductor, the emissivity for heat radiation and the absorption of sunlight increases. Conductor coatings are available that have a high emissivity for high heat radiation and a low absorption of sunlight. These coatings would be applied to new conductor during manufacture. These types of coatings have the ability to potentially increase the current rating of the ACSR conductor. For the same amount of amperage, the temperature of the same conductor will be lower due to the better heat dissipation of the higher emissivity coating.&lt;ref&gt;http://catalogs.generalcable.com/viewer.aspx?docid=bee27b4a-3859-48ec-9b78-a38e00eea488&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bleach activators''' are compounds that allow a lower washing temperature than would be required otherwise to achieve the full activity of bleaching agents in the wash liquor. Bleaching agents, usually [[Peroxide|peroxides]], are usually sufficiently active only from 60 Â°C on. With bleach activators, this activity can already be achieved at lower temperatures. Bleach activators react with [[hydrogen peroxide]] in aqueous solution to form [[peroxy acid]]s, they are a component of most [[laundry detergent]]s. Peroxy acids are more active [[bleach]]es than hydrogen peroxide at lower temperatures (&lt;60&amp;nbsp;Â°C) but are too unstable to be stored in their active form and hence must be generated in situ. 

The most common bleach activators used commercially are [[tetraacetylethylenediamine]] (TAED) and [[sodium nonanoyloxybenzenesulfonate]] (NOBS). NOBS is the main activator used in the U.S.A. and Japan,&lt;ref name=Hirschen&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hirschen|first1=M.|title=Handbook of Detergents Part C: Analysis|date=2005|publisher=Marcel Dekker|pages=439â470}}&lt;/ref&gt; TAED is the main activator used in Europe.&lt;ref name=Grime2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grime|first1=K.|last2=Clauss|first2=A.|title=Laundry Bleaches and Activators|journal=Chem. Ind.|date=1990|issue=647-649}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and Properties==
Bleach activators are typically made up of two parts: the peroxy acid [[precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] and the [[leaving group]]; and are modified by altering these parts. The peroxy acid precursor affects the bleaching properties of the peroxy acid: determining the activity, selectivity, hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance and oxidation potential. The leaving group influences the [[solubility]], perhydrolysis rate and storage stability of the activator.&lt;ref name=Reinhardt2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reinhardt|first1=G.|last2=Borchers|first2=G.|title=Handbook of Detergents, Part E: Applications|date=2009|publisher=CRC Press|location=Chapter 16: Application of Bleaching Detergent Formulations|pages=376â412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism of Activation==
Bleach activation is also known as perhydrolysis. Persalts are inorganic salts that are used as hydrogen peroxide carriers (examples include [[sodium percarbonate]] and [[sodium perborate]]). Persalts and bleach activators are included together in powder laundry detergents that contain bleach. In the wash, both compounds dissolve in the water. When dissolved in water, the persalt releases hydrogen peroxide (''e.g.'' from sodium percarbonate):       

:2Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;â3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; â 2Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

In a [[base (chemistry)|basic]] wash solution, hydrogen peroxide loses a [[proton]] and is converted to the perhydroxyl anion:

:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{eqm}} H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;â&lt;/sup&gt;

The perhydroxyl anion then attacks the activator, forming a peroxy acid:  

:HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;â&lt;/sup&gt; + RC(O)X â X&lt;sup&gt;â&lt;/sup&gt; + RC(O)O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H

The overall reaction of TAED ('''1''') with 2 equivalents of hydrogen peroxide gives diacetylethylenediamine ('''2''') and 2 equivalents of peracetic acid ('''3'''):

[[File:Peracetic acid production from the hydrogen peroxide and TAED.svg|center]]
  
Only the perhydroxyl anion, and not the hydrogen peroxide molecule, reacts with the bleach activator.&lt;ref name=Hauthal&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hauthal|first1=H. G.|last2=Schmidt|first2=H.|last3=Scholz|first3=H. J.|last4=Hofmann|first4=J.|last5=Pritzkow|first5=W.|title=Studies concerning the mechanism of bleaching activation|journal=Tenside Surf. Det.|date=1990|volume=27|issue=3|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In aqueous solutions, the hydroxide ion is also present, but owing to the greater [[nucleophile|nucleophilicity]] of the perhydroxyl anion, it will react preferentially. Once formed, the peroxy acid can act as a [[bleach]].

== Economics ==
The consumption of bleach activators in 2002 was approximately 105,000 tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;G. Reinhardt, ''To Bleach or Not to Bleach â New Oxygen-Based Bleach Technology'', in 5th World Conference on Detergents: Reinventing the Industry: Opportunities and Challenges, edit. A. Cahn, AOCS Publishing, 2003, {{ISBN|978-1-893997-40-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Consumption, however, is stagnant or declining due to cost pressures on detergents and the advance of liquid detergent formulations (which contain no bleach and bleach activators). The relatively high cost of conventional bleaching systems restrict their spread in emerging markets, where cold water is used for washing and photobleaching by sunlight is widespread or the use of [[Sodium hypochlorite washes|sodium hypochlorite solution]] (as in the US). 

There remains considerable potential in Europe for more active bleach activators due to the significant potential energy savings achievable by washing at lower temperatures, but their higher activity must not be accompanied by greater damage to textile dyes and fibers. In addition to stain bleaching in laundry, the disinfecting and deodorizing effects of bleach/activator combinations also play an important role. Therefore, they are also used in dishwashing detergents and denture cleaners.&lt;ref name="Clariant"&gt;Clariant Surfactant Division: [http://www.detergents-intermediates.clariant.com/C12575E4001FB2B8/vwLookupDownloads/DetergentsIntermediates_Newsroom_Brochures_Peractive.pdf/$FILE/DetergentsIntermediates_Newsroom_Brochures_Peractive.pdf ''The Clean and Clever Way of Bleaching, PERACTIVEÂ®''] (PDF; 885&amp;nbsp;kB), August 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
Typical bleach activators are essentially ''N''- and ''O''-acyl compounds that form peroxyacids upon perhydrolysis (meaning hydrolysis by hydrogen peroxide from the bleach, persalts). For example, [[Tetraacetylethylenediamine|TAED]] produces in the wash liquor bleach-active peroxyacetic acid or from DOBA peroxydodecanoic acid. In all cases, the activator is chemically reacted according to the degree of contamination in the laundry and thus "consumed".

The literature describes a variety of active ''N''-acyl compounds, such as [[tetraacetyl glycoluril]] and other acylated saturated [[Heterocyclic compound|nitrogen-containing heterocycles]], such as [[Hydantoin|hydantoins]], hydrotriazines, [[Diketopiperazine|diketopiperazines]], etc., as well as acylated imides and lactams. A disadvantage of these compounds compared to the standard compound TAED is their usually poorer economic and ecological performance.

In addition to the acylated phenol derivatives NOBS, LOBS and DOBA (negatively charged in the aqueous medium), further bleach-active O-acyl compounds are described, for example tetraacetylxylose or pentaacetylglucose. DOBA, commonly used in Japan, is characterized by good [[biodegradability]] and greater effect on a number of microorganisms compared to TAED. Both work together synergistically.&lt;ref&gt;M. Sajitz, J. Grohmann: [http://www.emulsions.clariant.com/C12576850036A6E9/C121725675BE1A1CC125792500518FA7/$FILE/S%C3%96FW%2010.2011.pdf Hygiene Effects of Bleach Systems in Laundry Detergents] (PDF; 401&amp;nbsp;kB), SOFW Journal 10-2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, nitriles, such as cyanopyridine and cyanamides, cyanomorpholine and in particular cyanomethyl trialkyl/arylammonium salts are known bleach activators (the latter, the so-called nitrile quats,&lt;ref&gt;G. Reinhardt et al., ''Neue  reaktive Bleichaktivatoren â eine Gratwanderung zwischen Bleicheffizienz und Farb-/FaserschÃ¤digung'', Tenside, Surf. Det., 34 (6), 404-409 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent | country = EP | number = 0790244 | title =Ammoniumnitrile und deren Verwendung als Bleichaktivatoren | gdate = 1997-08-20 | invent1 =M. LÃ¶ffler | assign1 =Hoechst AG }}&lt;/ref&gt; are present in aqueous solution as cations).

:&lt;math chem&gt;\left[\ce{R^2 - \overset{\displaystyle R^1 \atop |}\underset{| \atop \displaystyle R^3}{N+}-CH2-CN} \right]\ce{X-}&lt;/math&gt;
Nitrile quats are active in bleaching even at temperatures around 20 Â°C and act via peroxoimino acids that are formed intermediately from [[Peroxide|peroxo compounds]]. These decompose to the corresponding quaternary amides, which react with the help of hydrogen peroxide to the corresponding, readily biodegradable betaines.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Lars Cuypers, Martina Hirschen, Gerd Reinhardt|Periodical=Tenside Surfactants Detergents|Title=Bleaching Product Development in View of Ecological Aspects|Volume=42|Issue=6|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;342â346|Date=2005-12|language=German|DOI=10.3139/113.100277
}}&lt;/ref&gt; A disadvantage of nitrile quats is the poor biodegradability of the original substances and their often pronounced hygroscopicity, which, however, can be reduced by suitable counterions.

Other new bleaching systems have been developed, especially for washing at lower temperatures and room temperature and for use in liquid detergent formulations:
* New and more active peroxyacids, such as phthalimidoperoxyhexanoic acid (PAP)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent |country=EP |number=0349940 |title=PhthalimidoperoxihexansÃ¤ure, Verfahren zu deren Herstellung und deren Verwendung |gdate=1998-05-13 |invent1=Hanspeter GethÃ¶ffer, Gerd Reinhardt |assign1=Clariant GmbH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[File:PAP Structure.svg|frame|center|PAP Structure]]

* Peracid boosters that form highly reactive intermediates with peracids (such as cyclic sulfonimines as precursors of reactive oxaziridines&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent | country = EP | number =0923636 | title =Color-safe bleach boosters, compositions and laundry methods employing same | gdate = 20. Januar 1998-01-20| invent1 =G.S. Miracle et al. | assign1 = The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. }}&lt;/ref&gt;) or sugar-based ketones that form bleach-active dioxiranes with hydrogen peroxide&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent | country = EP | number =1209221 | title =Verwendung von cyclischen Zuckerketonen als Katalysator fÃ¼r Persauerstoffverbindungen | gdate = 2002-05-29 | invent1 = G. Reinhardt, N. Reichardt | assign1 =Clariant GmbH }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bleach catalysts, which form as stable transition metal complexes (of metals such as manganese, iron, cobalt, etc.) with persalts bleaching-active oxygen species even at temperatures below 30 Â°C.  They exceeds the activity of the standard compound TAED by almost 100 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent | country = EP | number =1225215 | title =Verwendung von Ãbergangsmetallkomplexen mit Oxim-Liganden als Bleichkatalysatoren | gdate =2002-07-24 | invent1 =G. Reinhardt et al. | assign1 =Clariant GmbH }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such complexes offer enormous economic (lower detergent volume, less packaging, lower transport costs) and environmental benefits (low washing temperature, low wastewater pollution). Particularly interesting are bleaching catalysts of the second generation, which already form bleaching-active species with atmospheric oxygen, i.e. they can mimic the active sites of natural [[Monooxygenase|mono-]] or [[Dioxygenase|dioxygenases]]. However, in 1994, the launch of a first generation manganese complex&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent | country = US | number =5244594 | title =Bleach activation multinuclear manganese-based coordination complexes | gdate =  1993-09-14 | invent1 =T.L.F.

As a result, consumers' confidence in bleach catalysts has been shaken on a sustained basis.&lt;ref&gt;M.

==History==
[[File:BollorÃ© Bluecar Bluecity car share in London 001.jpg|thumb|right|BollorÃ© Bluecar [[Bluecity]] in Hammersmith, London]]
In June, 2016, [[BollorÃ©]] signed an agreement with the [[Land Transport Authority|Land Transport Authority (LTA)]] and the [[Economic Development Board]] to develop an electric car-sharing programme. On September 27, 2017, BlueSG announced with LTA to launch Singapore's first large scale [[Carsharing|electric car sharing]] programme, with the service's electric car supplied by BollorÃ©. The company also opened their Asia-Pacific headquarters for its e-mobility, energy management and system integration business for the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-s-first-electric-car-sharing-programme-to-launch-in-9254156|title=Singapore's first electric car-sharing programme to launch in December|publisher=[[Channel News Asia]]|date=September 27, 2017|accessdate=June 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; BollorÃ© already operates several similar electric car-sharing services such as [[Autolib']], BlueIndy and [[Bluecity]] in [[Paris]], [[Indianapolis]] and [[London]] respectively. 

Construction of the charging stations began at the end of September, 2017 and in December, 2017, the service was officially opened to the public with 30 charging stations and 80 cars located throughout the island.&lt;ref name=LTA/&gt; BlueSG plans to expand the service to offer 2,000 charging points in 500 charging locations, with 400 charging points open for public use and 1,000 [[electric car]]s deployed by 2020.&lt;ref name=StraitsTimes5000&gt;{{cite website|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/more-than-5000-bluesg-electric-car-rentals-in-first-3-weeks-of-service|title=More than 5,000 BlueSG electric car rentals in first 3 weeks of service|publisher=[[The Straits Times]]|date=January 3, 2018|accessdate=June 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January, 2018, within the first 3 weeks of operations, over 3000 members signed up for the service, with 5000 rentals completed.&lt;ref name=StraitsTimes5000/&gt;

==Operation and fleet==

The '''Brushy Fork Coal Impoundment''', also known as the '''Brushy Fork Coal Sludge Dam''', is a large [[tailings dam]] on the Brushy Fork near [[Marfork, West Virginia|Marfork]] in western [[Raleigh County, West Virginia|Raleigh County]] of [[West Virginia]], [[United States]]. It is located {{Convert|18|mi|km|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Beckley, West Virginia|Beckley]], the seat of Raleigh County. Brushy Fork flows into Little Marsh Fork, which then enters Marsh Fork, which is a tributary of the [[Coal River (West Virginia)|Coal River]]. The purpose of the dam is to store a sludge consisting of [[tailings]] and waste from a nearby [[coal mine]]. In 1995 [[Massey Energy]] received a permit to construct the dam. Over the years additional permits to increase the size and storage volume of the dam have been issued in the midst of local and regional opposition to its structural integrity. Currently at approximately {{Convert|900|ft|m|abbr=on}} in height, it is the tallest dam in the [[Western Hemisphere]]. When complete its designed height will be {{Convert|954|ft|m|abbr=on}}. Wasted rock from the coal mining process is used as the dam filler. The dam currently withholds about {{Convert|25100|acre.ft|m3|abbr=on}} of waste. This capacity will be increased to {{Convert|30075|acre.ft|m3|abbr=on}} upon completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.coalimpoundment.org/locate/impoundment.asp?impoundment_id=1211-WV04-40234-02 | title=Brushy Fork Coal Impoundment | publisher=Coal Impoundment LIS | accessdate=13 May 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514052315/http://www.coalimpoundment.org/locate/impoundment.asp?impoundment_id=1211-WV04-40234-02 | archivedate=14 May 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://marfork5.org/about/brushy-fork/ | title=The Brushy Fork Sludge Dam | publisher=Marfork 5 | accessdate=13 May 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514090344/http://marfork5.org/about/brushy-fork/ | archivedate=14 May 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ohvec.org/galleries/mountaintop_removal/008/index.html | title=Virtual Flyover of Brushy Fork Coal Slurry Impoundment | publisher=Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition | accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BfS operates a gamma dose rate measurement network with about 1800 probes, uniformly distributed over Germany. The automatically working systems compare the actual level of radiation with the long term mean and sends an alert to the data centers immediately, if the radiation exceeds the threshold value. This network is a part of the German early [[warning system]], in case of a nuclear accident. Hardware of data logger and probes as well as software are developed in-house by the BfS. On the mountain [[Schauinsland]] the BfS operates an international measurement station for gamma dose rate probe calibration and long term tests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfs.de/EN/topics/ion/environment/air-soil/odl/odl.html Gamma dose rate Network of the Federal Office for Radiation Protection, Monitoring of the ambient gamma dose rate] &lt;/ref&gt;

A '''charge pump''' is a kind of [[DC to DC converter]] that uses [[capacitor]]s for energetic charge storage to raise or lower [[voltage]]. Charge-pump circuits are capable of high [[Electrical efficiency|efficiencies]], sometimes as high as 90â95%, while being electrically simple circuits.

==Description==
Charge pumps use some form of switching device to control the connection of a supply voltage across a load through a capacitor. In a two stage cycle, in the first stage a capacitor is connected across the supply, charging it to that same voltage. In the second stage the circuit is reconfigured so that the capacitor is in series with the supply and the load. This doubles the voltage across the load - the sum of the original supply and the capacitor voltages. The pulsing nature of the higher voltage switched output is often smoothed by the use of an output capacitor.

An external or secondary circuit drives the switching, typically at tens of kilo[[hertz]] up to several megahertz. The high frequency minimizes the amount of capacitance required, as less charge needs to be stored and dumped in a shorter cycle.

Charge pumps can double voltages, triple voltages, halve voltages, invert voltages, fractionally multiply or scale voltages (such as Ã3/2, Ã4/3, Ã2/3, etc.) and generate arbitrary voltages by quickly alternating between modes, depending on the controller and circuit topology.

They are commonly used in low-power electronics (such as mobile phones) to raise and lower voltages for different parts of the circuitry - minimizing power consumption by controlling supply voltages carefully.

== Terminology for PLL ==

The term ''charge pump'' is also commonly used in [[phase-locked loop]] (PLL) circuits even though there is no pumping action involved unlike in the circuit discussed above. A PLL charge pump is merely a bipolar switched current source. This means that it can output positive and negative current pulses into the loop filter of the PLL. It cannot produce higher or lower voltages than its power and ground supply levels.

== Applications ==
* A common application for charge-pump circuits is in [[RS-232]] [[logic level|level shift]]ers, where they are used to derive positive and negative voltages (often +10 V and â10 V) from a single 5 V or 3 V [[power supply rail]].
* Charge pumps can also be used as [[LCD]] or white-[[LED]] drivers, generating high bias voltages from a single low-voltage supply, such as a battery.
* Charge pumps are extensively used in NMOS memories and microprocessors to generate a negative voltage "VBB" (about â3 V), which is connected to the substrate.  This guarantees that all N+-to-substrate junctions are reversely biased by 3 V or more, decreasing junction capacitance and increasing circuit speed.&lt;ref&gt;Jenne, F. "Substrate Bias Circuit", US Patent 3794862A, Feb 26, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A charge pump providing a negative [[voltage spike]] has been used in NES-compatible games not licensed by Nintendo in order to stun the [[10NES|Nintendo Entertainment System lockout chip]].&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Horton. [http://kevtris.org/mappers/cdreams/revc.html Colordreams Revision C]. Last modified 2007-09-30. Accessed 2011-09-15.&lt;/ref&gt;
* As of 2007, charge pumps are integrated into nearly all [[EEPROM]] and [[flash memory|flash-memory]] integrated circuits. These devices require a high-voltage pulse to "clean out" any existing data in a particular memory cell before it can be written with a new value. Early EEPROM and flash-memory devices required two power supplies: +5 V (for reading) and +12 V (for erasing). {{As of|2007}}, commercially available flash memory and EEPROM memory requires only one external power supply â generally 1.8 V or 3.3 V. A higher voltage, used to erase cells, is generated internally by an on-chip charge pump. 
* Charge pumps are used in [[H bridge]]s in ''high-side drivers'' for [[gate driver|gate-driving]] high-side n-channel [[power MOSFET]]s and [[IGBT]]s. When the centre of a half bridge goes low, the capacitor is charged through a diode, and this charge is used to later drive the gate of the high-side FET a few volts above the source voltage so as to switch it on. This strategy works well, provided the bridge is regularly switched and avoids the complexity of having to run a separate power supply and permits the more efficient n-channel devices to be used for both switches. This circuit (requiring the periodic switching of the high-side FET) may also be called a "bootstrap" circuit, and some would differentiate between that and a charge pump (which would not require that switching).

'''[[Container deposit legislation]]''' ('''CDL''') also known as a Container Deposit Scheme (CDS) is a scheme that was first implemented in [[South Australia]] in 1977 and over the decades has spread to the [[Northern Territory]] in 2012, [[New South Wales]] in 2017 and the [[Australian Capital Territory]] in June 2018. [[Queensland]] has announced it will pursue a scheme in partnership with NSW for implementation by 1 November 2018. [[Western Australia]] has also announced plans for a scheme commencing in early 2020.

Attempts to introduce similar legislation in [[Tasmania]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] have been unsuccessful to date. [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] did have a similar scheme in place in the 1980's called 'Cash for Cans' but was later rescinded. A [[Newspoll]] survey found a majority of people in Australia support a deposit scheme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tandlnews.com.au/2012/08/07/article/container-deposit-scheme-gathers-momentum/|title=Container deposit scheme gathers momentum|date=7 August 2012|work=Transport &amp; Logistics News|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a national scheme has also been proposed many times over the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleanup.org.au/au/Whatelsewesupport/why-do-we-need-a-container-deposit-legislation-.html|title=Why we need a Container Deposit Scheme|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The recent [[NSW]] scheme was strongly opposed by the beverage industry and highlighted their influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/beverage-giants-lobby-against-nsw-container-deposit-scheme-20141108-11iqup.html|title=Beverage giants lobby against NSW container deposit scheme|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The value of deposits and the scope of their application have been influenced by the Australian federal constitution's guarantee of free trade between the states. The defining case in this issue was the attempt to introduce a differential between reusable and recyclable bottle deposits. The issue was taken to the High Court of Australia in the ''[[Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia]]'' court case.,&lt;ref name="Tooheys HCA"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|1|1990|litigants=[[Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia]] |parallelcite=(1990) 169 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 436 |date=7 February 1990 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; State based schemes need to be exempted from the Commonwealth Mutual Recognition Act which guarantees products can be sold in any jurisdiction without requiring any special labelling. This formed the basis of legal action against the Northern Territories' scheme until an exemption was granted. South Australia, Northern Territory, New South Wales and the ACT is offering 10c to anyone who donates an empty container.

==CDL by state==

===Australian Capital Territory===
The ACT government has always been supportive of container deposit legislation, but has never acted alone due to its relatively small size and being enclaved inside the much larger state of NSW. They have always said if NSW adopts a scheme they will follow suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/canberra-likely-to-follow-nsw-into-refunds-for-drinks-containers-20150105-12i7m0.html|title=Canberra likely to follow NSW into refunds for drinks containers|author=Kirsten Lawson|date=14 January 2015|work=Canberra Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ACT Container Deposit Scheme legislation was passed into law on 9 November 2017 and a public consultation was conducted ahead of  the scheme's implementation in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yoursay.act.gov.au/act-container-deposit-scheme|title=Your say: ACT Container Deposit Scheme}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme began on 30 June 2018.

===New South Wales===
[[File:Reverse vending machine for the NSW Container Deposit Scheme at the Kooringal Mall 2.jpg|thumb|Reverse vending machine, December 2017.]]
The [[New South Wales]] government has indicated it wishes to push ahead with a container deposit scheme as part of a raft of new policies aimed at protecting the environment and doing more to prevent litter and pollution entering the state's rivers, oceans, and parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-01-04/nsw-government-to-introduce-a-drinks-container-deposit-scheme/5999102|title=NSW Government set to introduce a drinks container deposit scheme|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme has strong backing from the public, various politicians, NSW councils,&lt;ref name="governmentnews.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.governmentnews.com.au/2014/12/nsw-councils-back-container-deposit-scheme|title=NSW councils back container deposit scheme|work=Government News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and various environmental groups such as Cleanup Australia, Boomerang Alliance, and Total Environment Centre.

In February 2015 it was revealed that the Baird government has been under a well planned, sustained attack from multiple beverage industry companies and their executives. They have organised the lobbying of various members of parliament in NSW and other jurisdictions (even at the federal level) in order to gain influence over Mike Baird and Minister for the Environment, Rob Stokes, in order to force them to abandon plans for a container deposit scheme in NSW. The beverage industry has even threatened to run scare campaign election advertising. The government said that all of this time and money spent on lobbying has ultimately failed to change their position and the scheme will go ahead and is currently being designed. They have also invited the beverage industry to get on board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/how-beverage-companies-joined-forces-to-attack-baird-recycling-scheme-20150207-1389dx.html|title=How beverage companies joined forces to attack Baird recycling scheme|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NSW government initially announced the start date of a container deposit/refund system being July 2017, however, this was extended to December 2017 following requests from environment groups and industry bodies.&lt;ref name="epa.nsw.gov.au"&gt;http://www.epa.nsw.gov.au/resources/MinMedia/EPAMinMedia17021601.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 8 May 2016 it was officially announced the NSW will be implementing a full 10c Container Deposit Scheme after looking at many options, including public submissions and industry alternatives. As it stands, drink containers from 150ml in size up to 3L will be covered as long as it has the appropriate NSW labelling. There will be some exclusions - such as wine bottles - as it is mainly targeting drink containers consumed away from home. Draft legislation will be brought forward and an implementation advisory group will be established to meet the 1 December 2017 start date. This will affect the ACT and also QLD which are currently examining options for a state based scheme.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/baird-backs-kids-over-big-beverage-10-for-every-drink-bottle-you-can-find-20160507-gooqih.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 July 2017 the NSW EPA announced the scheme coordinator would be a joint venture called Exchange for Change,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.exchangeforchange.com.au/&lt;/ref&gt; comprising 5 of Australian beverage companies: Asahi, Carlton &amp; United Breweries, Coca-Cola Amatil, Coopers Brewery and Lion. However, there has been some criticism of this decision given some of these organisations have actively opposed CDL in the past.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/politics/nsw/utter-stupidity-greens-attack-cokes-role-in-nsw-container-scheme-20170731-gxmh5u.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 December 2017, the Container Deposit Scheme, named [[Return and Earn]], officially started, as it pushed to reduce the volume of litter in NSW by 40% by 2020. During the first couple of weeks in the scheme, many people were complaining about it, which including drink prices going up, boxes and bags dumped next to the machines, the allowance of only cans and bottles that were empty, uncrushed, unbroken and had the original label attached, and also, the limited number of collection points around the state. Although there was plenty of problems throughout Return And Earn, the number of containers that were returned increased, as did the amount of collection points. The Environment Minister announced that the scheme has been a success, and they were working hard to fix the minor teething problems. During Christmas and New Years celebrations, the amount grew to over 1 million containers returned a day, and then to over 3 million in towards April March. As of 17 April, there is a growing number of the 549 collection points available out of the planned 800+, and over 240 million containers have been returned throughout the state. A common label has been developed which will start appearing on bottles and cans: "10c refund at collection depots/points in participating State/Territory of purchase."

===Northern Territory===
The [[Northern Territory]] introduced a container deposit scheme similar to South Australia's from 3 January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nretas.nt.gov.au/environment-protection/containerdeposit |title=Archived copy |accessdate=22 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017042522/http://www.nretas.nt.gov.au/environment-protection/containerdeposit |archivedate=17 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was challenged in the Federal Court by [[Coca-Cola Amatil]], [[Schweppes Australia]] and [[Lion (Australasian company)|Lion Pty Ltd]] using the Commonwealth Mutual Recognition Act and the scheme ceased on 4 March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/business/companies/coca-cola-wins-federal-court-case-cash-for-containers-recycling-found-illegal/story-fnda1bsz-1226590179763|title=Coca-Cola wins Federal Court case, cash for containers recycling found illegal|work=News.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the Federal Court loss, the NT government personally stepped in to keep the scheme going until a permanent exemption to the Mutual Recognition Act could be secured. On 7 August 2013 the Federal Executive Council (ExCo) ratified the permanent exemption making the NT container deposit scheme completely legal and permanent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-08-07/nt-container-deposit-schme-back-on-track-federal-law-exemption/4870244|title=Container deposit scheme back on full-bottle track|work=www.abc.net.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to this, all beverage containers sold in Australia now must bear the words "10c refund at SA/NT collection depots in state/territory of purchase". With other jurisdictions implementing their own schemes a common label has been developed which will start appearing on bottles and cans: "10c refund at collection depots/points in participating State/Territory of purchase"

===Queensland===
In 2013, the [[Newman government]] has indicated it does not want to increase the cost of QLD residents' costs of living, seeing the refund scheme as more of a tax rather than a refundable deposit even though 85% of Queenslanders are in favor of a scheme according to a Newspoll.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/most-queenslanders-want-container-deposit-laws-introduced-but-the-government-cans-the-idea/story-fnihsrf2-1226666475414&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, the newly elected [[Palaszczuk Ministry|Palaszczuk government]] indicated a total overhaul of the state's environmental policies including supporting a national container deposit scheme and also a state based container deposit scheme. It is likely that QLD will follow suit with NSW.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.resourcerecovery.biz/news/labor-poised-overhaul-queensland-recycling-policies&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015 the QLD government announced its support for a Cash for Containers scheme in Queensland, potentially in 2018 after NSW implements its own scheme. The QLD environment minister says he was inspired by trash that was sent to his office. He has ordered a review and wants to establish an advisory group to help his department with a consultation process with the public and stake holders commencing later this year. He also says he will work with NSW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/environment-minister-steven-miles-tackles-queenslands-recycling-issue-20150520-gh5zm3.html|title=Environment Minister Steven Miles tackles Queensland's recycling issue|author=Amy Remeikis|date=20 May 2015|work=Brisbane Times}}
As of May 2016, with NSW formally signing off on a full 10c CDS - it is likely QLD will adopt a similar model for implementation in 2018. QLD is observing the NSW situation closely.
&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the [[Queensland]] government on 22 July 2016 announced that State will have a Container Deposit Scheme "to get drink cans and bottles off our beaches, and out of our parks and public areas"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Container deposit scheme for Queensland|url=http://statements.qld.gov.au/Statement/2016/7/22/container-deposit-scheme-for-queensland|website=qld.gov.au|publisher=Queensland government|accessdate=27 July 2016|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
The Queensland Container Refund Scheme (CRS) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quensland Container Refund Scheme|url=https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/pollution/management/waste/container-refund-about|website=qld.gov.au|publisher=Queensland government|accessdate=27 July 2016|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; was to start from 1 July 2018 but was delayed to 1 November 2018.

===South Australia===
{{see also|Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia}}
In the days when bottles were washed and re-used, drinks manufacturers paid shopkeepers and "marine store collectors" ("bottle-ohs") for the return of their (proprietary) containers, both bottles and crates. By arrangement between the manufacturers, the refund to the consumer was standardized (for many decades 2d, later 6d or 5c. for soft drink bottles and Â½d for generic beer bottles) and the collectors received a premium for their part in the process. A substantial cost was incurred by the manufacturer in the transportation, sorting, storage, washing and sterilizing of the bottles and their inspection for contamination and damage. With the advent of cheaper single-use bottles great savings were achievable, and their subsequent disposal the responsibility of the consumer.

CDL in [[South Australia]] was put in place under the Beverage Container Act 1975 (SA) and came into operation in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.sa.gov.au/LZ/C/A/BEVERAGE%20CONTAINER%20ACT%201975/1995.04.30_%281988.03.10%29/1975.77.PDF|title=Beverage Container Act 1975|year=1975|publisher=Government of South Australia|accessdate=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Environment Protection Act 1993]] (SA) now governs the levying and refund of deposits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.sa.gov.au/LZ/C/A/Environment%20Protection%20Act%201993.aspx|title=South Australian Legislation â Environment Protection Act 1993|publisher=Attorney-General's Department, Government of South Australia|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a refund of 10 cents per can or bottle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bottlebill.org/legislation/world/australia.htm|title=BottleBill.org â Beverage Container Legislation in Australia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (raised from 5 cents in late 2008). In the 1970s deposits ranged from 20c for a 30 oz bottle and 10c for a 10 oz and 6Â½ oz bottle. With the introduction of plastic and non re-usable bottles the deposit was reduced to 5c (including aluminium cans). This amount remained unchanged for around thirty years.

Around 600 people are employed in the recovery of bottles in South Australia. Groups such as the Scouts operate container refund depots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greens.org.nz/searchdocs/other7680.html|title=What are Bottle Bills|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are professional collectors who collect on an arranged basis from particular venues (e.g. pubs and restaurants), usually operating small trucks for the job, there are also many socially marginalised collectors who forage in spots such as refuse bins for discarded deposit bottles; these collectors often travel by bicycle, sometimes with relatively elaborate and inventive modifications to allow them to carry bulky loads of bottles.

Until 2008, every beverage container in Australia bore the words "5c refund at SA collection depots in state of purchase". This changed to "10c refund at SA collection depots in state of purchase" in late 2008. Since the [[Northern Territory]] started their own scheme in 2012, this message has changed again. With other jurisdictions implementing their own schemes a common label has been developed which will start appearing on bottles and cans: "10c refund at collection depots/points in participating State/Territory of purchase".

===Tasmania===
In December 2014 a state based deposit scheme was rejected by the government, citing costs and the need to ship containers to the Australian mainland for processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-12-20/knock-back-for-container-deposit-scheme-tas/5980924|title=Container deposit scheme rejected in Tasmania after report estimates $4m cost|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various environmental organisations, including The Greens and many Tasmanian local councils&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.governmentnews.com.au/2013/12/tasmanian-councils-harden-push-for-container-deposit-scheme/|title=Tasmanian councils harden push for container deposit scheme|work=Government News}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been pushing for a scheme in Tasmania for many years. Most people are in favour of a scheme according to various studies that have been conducted over the years.

In 2018 the Tasmanian Government has made a commitment to consider establishing a Container Refund Scheme (CRS) and has engaged a consulting company to produce a report with recommendations. This report is now available and the Tasmanian Government is now reviewing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epa.tas.gov.au/policy/other-topics/resource-recovery/container-deposit-scheme|title=Studies into Container Deposit Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victoria===
The state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] once had a container deposit scheme in the 1980's called "Cash for Cans" but was rescinded in 1989.&lt;ref name="governmentnews.com.au"/&gt;
In 2009 the [[Victorian Greens]] introduced a bill for a 10c deposit scheme, which was passed in the [[Victorian Legislative Council|upper house]] but the government quashed the bill in the [[Victorian Legislative Assembly|lower house]], allegedly on constitutional grounds, by refusing to allow it to be debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = McMahon |first = Stephen |title = Brumby Government halts Greens law to reintroduce bottle deposit system| work = HeraldSun |date = 25 June 2009 | url = http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/brumby-government-halts-greens-law-to-reintroduce-bottle-deposit-system/story-e6frf7jo-1225739810093 | accessdate = 22 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite supporting the Greens' bill when in opposition, when it later became the government the [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] decided it would not back a bottle refund scheme. Instead, it said it would support a national scheme if one were created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lucas|first=Clay|title=Baillieu retreats on bottle refund scheme|url=http://www.theage.com.au/environment/baillieu-retreats-on-bottle-refund-scheme-20120304-1ub4u.html|accessdate=25 January 2013|newspaper=The Age|date=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012/2013, the Napthine government indicated its strong support&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/victorian-premier-denis-napthine-backs-cashforcans-recycling-scheme-20140322-35ab5.html|title=Victorian Premier Denis Napthine backs cash-for-cans recycling scheme|work=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a state based scheme possibly in partnership with NSW. Since there has now been a change of government, the legislation has not been introduced into parliament as of January 2015.

In February 2015, the then Environment Minister [[Lisa Neville]] has publicly said she is not in favour of a container deposit scheme for Victoria. She believes current recycling programs are good enough, even though Clean-up Australia claims beverage related rubbish in Victoria now outnumbers cigarette related rubbish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/lisa-neville-against-cashforcontainers-recycling-scheme-in-victoria-20150107-12j14t.html|title=Lisa Neville against cash-for-containers recycling scheme in Victoria|work=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In July 2017 her successor [[Lily D'Ambrosio]] confirmed the state's continuing opposition to a state scheme on the basis that the costs would outweigh the environmental benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heffernan|first1=Madeleine|last2=Preiss|first2=Benjamin|title=Victoria open to 'going it alone' on plastic bag ban if national deal not reached|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/victoria-open-to-going-it-alone-on-plastic-bag-ban-if-national-deal-not-reached-20170725-gxi9av.html|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=The Age|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, Victorian Environment Minister [[Lily D'Ambrosio]] announced a $37m package to tackle recycling in her State. Although she is no longer explicitly saying a CDS for Victoria is off the table, she has stated that she is carefully monitoring the situation in NSW in relation to the newly rolled out scheme.
There are private companies that accept used aluminum cans and pay cash for them - usually by weight or by per filled 'metal storage cage'.

===Western Australia===
In 2011, opposition [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] and [[Australian Greens|Greens]] MPs called for the introduction of a container deposit scheme. The Minister for Environment, [[Bill Marmion]], said that WA would wait for a national "consultation regulatory impact statement" to be completed at the end of 2011 before taking any action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-11-16/container-deposit-feature/3675712|title=A container deposit scheme is proposed for WA|first1=Oliver|last1=Peterson|date=16 November 2011|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, the WA Government announced a State container deposit scheme commencing in 2018. Minister for the Environment [[Albert Jacob]] said that efforts to pursue a national scheme had "fallen by the wayside" but that Western Australia's policy should be aligned with recent changes in Queensland and New South Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-17/10-cent-container-deposit-scheme-for-wa-recyclable-bottles-cans/7751328|title=WA container deposit scheme: Consumers to get 10c for bottles, cans in recycling push|first1=Andrew|last1=O'Connor|date=17 August 2016|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After a change of government at the March 2017 election, the new Environment Minister [[Stephen Dawson (politician)|Stephen Dawson]] said he wanted to make a container deposit scheme a priority and in August 2017. The new WA Government held public consultation and will start a container deposit scheme in January 2020 in a bid to lift the Stateâs low recycling rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.der.wa.gov.au/our-work/programs/111-wa-container-deposit-scheme|title=WA Container Deposit Scheme|publisher=Government of Western Australia |accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical==
Through the early 20th century, when the cost of producing glass bottles was higher, a natural industry of glass bottle collectors and merchants performed a similar function to the modern CDL. Bottle accumulators, a licensed and unionized workforce commonly known as "bottle-ohs" from their [[street cries]], travelled by cart around the streets buying empty bottles from households and businesses. They would then sell the bottles to a bottle yard, which would store and sort the bottles before selling them in bulk to brewers and other bottlers. It was an industry from which a bottle-oh could make a good living; in 1904, they could buy a dozen beer bottles for 6[[Penny (Australian)|d.]], sell them to the bottle yard for 9d., who could sell them to brewers for 1[[shilling (Australian)|s.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Evening News (Sydney)|Evening News]]

Soft drink and other beverage bottles were still collected in Queensland and returned for deposits up to the late 1960s.

The motion of an object moving in a [[curve]]d path is called ''curvilinear motion''.
Example: A [[stone]] thrown into the air at an [[angle]].

Curvilinear motion describes the motion of a moving particle that conforms to a known or fixed curve. The study of such motion involves the use of two co-ordinate systems, the first being planar motion and the latter being cylindrical motion.

== Planar motion ==

In planar motion, the [[velocity]] and [[acceleration]] components of the particle are always tangential and normal to the fixed curve. The velocity is always tangential to the curve and the acceleration can be broken up into both a tangential and normal component.

== Cylindrical components ==

With cylindrical co-ordinates which are described as Ã® and j, the motion is best described in polar form with components that resemble polar vectors. As with planar motion, the velocity is always tangential to the curve, but in this form acceleration consist of different intermediate components that can now run along the radius and its normal vector. This type of co-ordinate system is best used when the motion is restricted to the plane upon which it travels.

'''Diffusion bonding''' or '''diffusion welding''' is a solid-state welding technique used in metalworking, capable of joining similar and dissimilar metals. It operates on the principle of solid-state diffusion, wherein the atoms of two solid, metallic surfaces intersperse themselves over time. This is typically accomplished at an elevated temperature, approximately 50-70% of the absolute melting temperature of the materials. Diffusion bonding is usually implemented by applying high pressure, in conjunction with necessarily high temperature, to the materials to be welded; the technique is most commonly used to weld "sandwiches" of alternating layers of thin metal foil, and metal wires or filaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = Diffusion bonding|url = http://www.google.com.ar/patents/US8256661|date = 4 Sep 2012|accessdate = 2016-02-17|first = Kevin|last = VanDyke|first2 = Gigi|last2 = Streeter|first3 = Jon|last3 = Dreher|first4 = Larry|last4 = Leyrer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the diffusion bonding method is widely used in the joining of high-strength and refractory metals within the aerospace and nuclear industries.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

== History ==
The act of diffusion welding is centuries old. This can be found in the form of "filled gold," a technique used to bond [[gold]] and [[copper]] for use in jewelry and other applications. In order to create filled gold, smiths would begin by hammering out an amount of solid gold into a thin sheet of gold foil. This film was then placed on top of a copper substrate and weighted down. Finally, using a process known as "hot-pressure welding" or HPW, the weight/copper/gold-film assembly was placed inside an oven and heated until the gold film was sufficiently bonded to the copper substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Manufacturing Processes for Engineering Materials (5th Ed.)|last = Kalpakjian|first = Serope|publisher = Prentice Hall|year = 2007|isbn = 0-13-227271-7|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern methods were described by the Soviet scientist N.F. Kazakov in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msm.cam.ac.uk/phase-trans/2005/Amir/bond.html|title=Diffusion Bonding of Materials|last= Kazakov  |first= N.F|year=1985|publisher=Pergamon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Diffusion bonding involves no liquid fusion, and often no filler metal. No weight is added to the total, and the join tends to exhibit both the strength and temperature resistance of the base metal(s). The materials endure no, or very little, [[plastic deformation]]. Very little residual stress is introduced, and there is no contamination from the bonding process. It may be performed on a join surface of theoretically any size with no increase in processing time; practically speaking, the surface tends to be limited by the pressure required and physical limitations. It may be performed with similar and dissimilar metals, reactive and refractory metals, or pieces of varying thicknesses.

Diffusion bonding is most often used for jobs either difficult or impossible to weld by other means, due to its relatively high cost. Examples include welding materials normally impossible to join via liquid fusion, such as [[zirconium]] and [[beryllium]]; materials with very high melting points such as [[tungsten]]; alternating layers of different metals which must retain strength at high temperatures; and very thin, honeycombed metal foil structures.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book

== Temperature Dependence ==
Steady state diffusion is determined by the amount of diffusion [[flux]] that passes through the cross-sectional area of the mating surfaces. Fick's first law of diffusion states:

:&lt;math&gt;J = -D(dC/dx),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''J'' is the diffusion flux, ''D'' is a diffusion coefficient, and ''dC''/''dx'' is the concentration gradient through the materials in question. The negative sign is a product of the gradient. Another form of Fick's law states:

:&lt;math&gt;J = M/(At),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''M'' is defined as either the mass or amount of atoms being diffused, ''A'' is the cross-sectional area, and ''t'' is the time required. Equating the two equations and rearranging, we achieve the following result:

:&lt;math&gt;t = -(1/D)(M/A)(dC/dx)^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

As mass and area are constant for a given joint, time required is largely dependent on the concentration gradient, which changes by only incremental amounts through the joint, and the diffusion coefficient. The diffusion coefficient is determined by the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;D = D_0 e^{-Q_\text{d}/RT},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[activation energy]] for diffusion, ''R'' is the universal [[gas constant]], ''T'' is the [[thermodynamic temperature]] experienced during the process, and ''D''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a temperature-independent preexponential factor that depends on the materials being joined. For a given joint, the only term in this equation within control is temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Processes ==
[[File:Output wR3TGn.gif|thumb|Animation of Diffusion Bonding Process]]
When joining two materials of similar crystalline structure, diffusion bonding is performed by clamping the two pieces to be welded with their surfaces abutting each other. Prior to welding, these surfaces must be machined to as smooth a [[Surface finish|finish]] as economically viable, and kept as free from chemical contaminants or other detritus as possible. Any intervening material between the two metallic surfaces may prevent adequate diffusion of material. Specific [[Machine tooling|tooling]] is made for each welding application to mate the welder to the workpieces.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.welding-advisers.com/Diffusion-welding.html&lt;/ref&gt; Once clamped, pressure and heat are applied to the components, usually for many hours. The surfaces are heated either in a furnace, or via electrical resistance. Pressure can be applied using a hydraulic press at temperature; this method allows for exact measurements of load on the parts. In cases where the parts must have no temperature gradient, differential thermal expansion can be used to apply load. By fixturing parts using a low-expansion metal (i.e. [[molybdenum]]) the parts will supply their own load by expanding more than the fixture metal at temperature. Alternative methods for applying pressure include the use of dead weights, differential gas pressure between the two surfaces, and high-pressure autoclaves. Diffusion bonding must be done in a vacuum or inert gas environment when using metals that have strong oxide layers (i.e. copper). Surface treatment including polishing, etching, and cleaning as well as diffusion pressure and temperature are important factors regarding the process of diffusion bounding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

At the microscopic level, diffusion bonding occurs in three simplified stages:
* Before the surfaces completely contact, [[Asperity (materials science)|asperities]] (very small surface defects) on the two surfaces contact and plastically deform. As these asperities deform, they interlink, forming interfaces between the two surfaces.
* Elevated temperature and pressure causes accelerated [[Creep (deformation)|creep]] in the materials; [[Grain boundary|grain boundaries]] and raw material migrate and gaps between the two surfaces are reduced to isolated pores.
* Material begins to [[Diffusion|diffuse]] across the boundary of the abutting surfaces, blending this material boundary and creating a bond.

== Benefits ==
* The bounded surface have the same physical and mechanical properties as the base material. Once we have finished the jointing, we could also perform the test of the jointing materials, for example, [[tensile testing]].
* The diffusion bounding process is able to produce a high quality joints in which case no discontinuity and porosity exists in the interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Diffusion Bonding|url = http://www.msm.cam.ac.uk/phase-trans/2005/Amir/bond.html|website = www.msm.cam.ac.uk|access-date = 2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, we are able to sand, manufacturing and heat the material.
* The diffusion bounding is able to help us to build high precision components with complex shapes. Also, diffusion is flexible.
* The diffusion bounding method can be used wildly, joining either similar or dissimilar materials, and also important in processing composite materials.
* The process is not extremely hard to approach and the cost to perform the diffusion bounding is not high.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Solid State Welding|url = http://www.totalmateria.com/Article51.htm|website = www.totalmateria.com|access-date = 2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The material under diffusion is able to reduce the plastic deformation.

== Applicability ==
[[File:Output 9GbY2F.gif|thumb|Animation of sheet forming process using diffusion welding]]
Diffusion bonding is primarily used to create intricate forms for the electronics, aerospace, and nuclear industries. Since this form of bonding takes a considerable amount of time compared to other joining techniques such as [[explosion welding]], parts are made in small quantities, and often fabrication is mostly automated. However, due to different requirements, some of the time interval could be accomplished in few minutes. In an attempt to reduce fastener count, labor costs, and part count, diffusion bonding, in conjunction with [[superplastic forming]], is also used when creating complex sheet metal forms. Multiple sheets are stacked atop one another and bonded in specific sections. The stack is then placed into a mold and gas pressure expands the sheets to fill the mold. This is often done using titanium or aluminum alloys for parts needed in the aerospace industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = DIFFUSION BONDING - AN ADVANCED MATERIAL PROCESS FOR AEROSPACE TECHNOLOGY|url = http://www.vacets.org/vtic97/ttnguyen.htm|website = www.vacets.org|access-date = 2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical materials that are welded include [[titanium]], [[beryllium]], and [[zirconium]]. In many [[military aircraft]] diffusion bonding will help to allow for the conservation of expensive [[strategic material]]s and the reduction of manufacturing costs. Some aircraft have over 100 diffusion-bonded parts, including; [[fuselage]]s, outboard and inboard actuator fittings, [[landing gear]] trunnions, and [[nacelle]] frames.

The '''ELENA reactor''' is a compact Russian [[pressurized water reactor]] (PWR) of 68-kWe generating capacity currently being developed by the [[Kurchatov Institute]]. To develop the reactor, techniques were used derived from the construction and operation of marine and space power plants and the operational experience of the [[GAMMA reactor]]. 

It is intended for use in remote areas, towns with a population of
1500â2000, or individual consumers requiring a highly reliable power supply, such as hospitals.

The reactor can also be used for [[water desalination]]. As of 2014, it is the smallest commercial nuclear reactor being developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/nuclearenergy/nuclearpower/Downloadable/SMR/files/4_UPDATED_STATUS_ON_GLOBAL_SMR_DEVELOPMENT__as_of_September_2014.pdf|title= Updated status on global SMR development â as of September 2014 |date=2014-09-01|publisher=[[IAEA]]|accessdate=2014-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/nuclearenergy/nuclearpower/Downloadable/SMR/files/IAEA_SMR_Booklet_2014.pdf|title= New booklet: Advances in SMR Technology Development |date=2014-09-01|publisher=[[IAEA]]|accessdate=2014-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5052">'''Electrochemical fluorination''' ('''ECF'''), or '''electrofluorination''', is a foundational [[organofluorine chemistry]] method for the preparation of [[fluorocarbon]]-based [[organofluorine compound]]s.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;G. Siegemund, W. Schwertfeger, A. Feiring, B. Smart, F. Behr, H. Vogel, B. McKusick "Fluorine Compounds, Organic" in "Ullmannâs Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry" 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a11_349}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general approach represents an application of [[electrosynthesis]]. The fluorinated [[chemical compounds]] produced by ECF are useful because of their distinctive [[solvation]] properties and the relative inertness of [[carbonâfluorine bond]]s. Two ECF synthesis routes are commercialized and commonly applied: the Simons process and the Phillips Petroleum process. It is also possible to electrofluorinate in various organic media.&lt;ref name=Drake&gt;Fred G. Drakesmith "Electrofluorination of Organic Compounds" Topics in Current Chemistry,Vol. 193, Springer, Berlin-Heidelberg, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the development of these methods, fluorination with [[fluorine]], a dangerous [[oxidant]], was a dangerous and wasteful process. Also, ECF can be cost-effective but it may also result in low yields.

==Simons process==
The Simons process entails [[electrolysis]] of a solution of an [[organic compound]] in a solution of [[hydrogen fluoride]].  An individual reaction can be described as:

:R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&amp;ndash;H  +  HF   â  R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&amp;ndash;F  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

In the course of a typical synthesis, this reaction occurs once for each C&amp;ndash;H bond in the precursor.  The cell potential is maintained near 5&amp;ndash;6 [[Volts|V]].  The [[anode]] is [[nickel]]-plated.  Simons discovered the process in the 1930s at [[Pennsylvania State University|Pennsylvania State College]] (U.S.), under the sponsorship of the [[3M Corporation]].  The results were not published until after World War II because the work was classified due to its relevance to the manufacture of [[uranium hexafluoride]]. In 1949 Simons and his coworkers published a long paper in the ''Journal of the Electrochemical Society''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = J. H. Simons | title = The Electrochemical Process for the Production of Fluorocarbons | journal = [[Journal of the Electrochemical Society]] | year = 1949 | volume = 95 | pages = 47&amp;ndash;66 | doi = 10.1149/1.2776735 | last2 = Harland | first2 = W. J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The Simons process is used for the production of perfluorinated [[amine]]s, [[ether]]s, [[carboxylic acid]]s, and [[sulfonic acid]]s.  For carboxylic and sulfonic acids, the products are the corresponding [[acyl]] and [[sulfonyl]] fluorides.  The method has been adapted to laboratory-scale preparations.  Two noteworthy considerations are (i) the hazards associated with hydrogen fluoride (the [[solvent]] and fluorine source) and (ii) the requirement for [[anhydrous]] conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lino Conte, GianPaolo Gambaretto | title = Electrochemical fluorination: state of the art and future tendences | journal = [[Journal of Fluorine Chemistry]] | year = 2004 | volume = 125 | pages = 139&amp;ndash;144 | doi = 10.1016/j.jfluchem.2003.07.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phillips Petroleum process==
This method is similar to the Simons Process but is typically applied to the preparation from volatile hydrocarbons and chlorohydrocarbons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Alsmeyer, Y. W.; Childs, W. V.; Flynn, R. M.; Moore, G. G. I.; Smeltzer, J. C.|chapter=Organofluorine Chemistry: Principles and Commercial Applications|editors=R. E. Banks, B. E. Smart, J. C. Tatlow|year=1994|publisher=Springer|location=Boston, MA|title=Organofluorine Chemistry|pages=121-143|doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-1202-2_5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this process, electrofluorination is conducted at porous [[graphite]] anodes in molten [[potassium fluoride]] in hydrogen fluoride.  The species [[Potassium bifluoride|KHF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] is relatively low melting, a good electrolyte, and an effective source of fluorine.  The technology is sometimes called âCAVEâ for Carbon Anode Vapor Phase Electrochemical Fluorination and was widely used at manufacturing sites of the [[3M Corporation]]. The organic compound is fed through a porous anode leading to exchange of fluorine for hydrogen but not chlorine.

==Other methods==
ECF has also been conducted in organic media, using for example organic salts of fluoride and [[acetonitrile]] as the solvent.&lt;ref name=Drake/&gt;  A typical fluoride source is [[Triethylamine|(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N]]:3HF.  In some cases, acetonitrile is omitted, and the solvent and electrolyte are the triethylamine-HF mixture.  Representative products of this method are [[fluorobenzene]] (from benzene) and 1,2-difluoro[[alkane]]s (from [[alkene]]s).

In the body, energy consumption is part of [[energy homeostasis]]. It derived from [[food energy]]. Energy consumption in the body is a product of the [[basal metabolic rate]] and the [[physical activity level]]. The physical activity level are defined for a non-[[pregnancy|pregnant]], non-[[lactation|lactating]] adult as that person's total energy expenditure (TEE) in a 24-hour period, divided by his or her [[basal metabolic rate]] (BMR):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Human energy requirements: Principles and Definitions |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/y5686e/y5686e04.htm |work=Report of a Joint FAO/WHO/UNU Expert Consultation |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] |year=2004 |accessdate=2009-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Blues Junior''' is a [[vacuum tube|tube]] [[guitar amplifier]] introduced in 1990 by the [[Fender Musical Instrument Corporation|Fender company]]. It is aimed at achieving the warm, tube-driven tone common in many styles of American [[blues]] and [[blues rock]] dating back to the 1950s, while remaining both portable and affordable. Fender frequently releases limited editions of the Blues Junior. All have the same electronic components &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fender.com/support/amp_schematics/pdfs/Blues_Junior_Schematic.pdf|title=Fender|publisher=|accessdate=April 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and specifications but have cosmetic changes and often a different speaker, at varying prices. The Fender Blues Junior is most similar to the Fender Blues Deluxe, which adds a "drive" channel, an effects loop, and uses 6L6GC output tubes for 40 watts of rated output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fender.com/support/amp_schematics/pdfs/Blues_Deluxe_Schematic.pdf|title=Fender|publisher=|accessdate=April 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fender Blues Junior was introduced after the [[Fender Pro Junior]], but has entirely different circuitry other than EL84 output tubes rated at 15 watts.

==Specifications==
* single-channel 15-watt all-tube amplifier
* one 12-inch, 50-watt, 8-ohm driver (connected with 1/4-inch phone jack for external speaker option); model varies with edition:
** standard edition Blues Juniors ship with a Celestion A-Type speaker
** [[New old stock|NOS]] Lacquer Tweed Limited Edition Blues Juniors ship with the Italian manufactured [[Jensen Loudspeakers|Jensen]] model C12N
** Tweed Relic Edition Blues Juniors ship with Jensen model P12R
** (other speaker models may be in use)
* Fender [[spring reverb]] (driven by a solid-state [[opamp]])
* Bass, Middle and Treble tone controls
* "Fat" pushbutton switch boosts gain and midrange frequencies in preamp stage
** also operable with optional remote foot-switch (not included)
* independent [[preamp]] and master gain controls for tube [[overdrive (music)|overdrive]] management
* "chicken head" vintage styled control knobs
* three matched Groove Tubes [[12AX7]] preamp tubes (graded to Fender's specifications)
* two matched Groove Tubes [[EL84]] power tubes (graded to Fender's specifications)
* fixed power tube bias
* solid-state [[rectifier]]
* single 1/4-inch input jack

==Varying editions==
Like many Fender amplifiers (particularly in the Hot Rod series), many limited edition versions of the Blues Junior have been manufactured since its introduction in 1995. The original circuit board underwent a major redesign in 2001, when production moved from the US to Mexico. The earlier circuit boards are green in color and are noted for a "darker," more bass-inflected tone. Many green board models have excessive noise in the reverb circuit, as the signal is inserted into the reverb after the master volume. The later circuit boards are cream or tan colored and sound "brighter" or more treble-oriented, with the reverb situated before the Master volume.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billmaudio.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lacquered Tweed editions, as the name implies, feature a cabinet upholstered with a lacquered [[Tweed (cloth)|tweed]] fabric.  Some of these have been artificially aged from the factory and are known as Lacquered Tweed "Relic" editions. The "Blonde" and "Brown Tolex" Blues Juniors feature traditional Fender [[Tolex]] upholstery in their respective colors, while the Sunburst Ash edition features an ash cabinet with a [[sunburst]] stain. One edition was issued with a forest green colored cabinet, had a United States flag on the cloth [[speaker grille]], and had [[United States Air Force]] markings detailed on the cabinet in yellow.

The standard Blues Junior is dressed like a traditional black Fender amplifier, with black Tolex upholstery and a silver cloth speaker grille.

Although they differ in their external visual aesthetic, all variants of the Blues Junior for a given year are produced with the same electronics, apart from the speaker/driver. Limited editions may use varying driver models, such as the Jensen C12N found in the [[New old stock|NOS]] Lacquered Tweed Blues Junior or the Jensen P12R found in the Relic edition. Fender does not always include these limited edition versions in their updated catalogs (or on their website) either because too few were produced (only a few hundred in some cases) or perhaps because of exclusive retailer agreements.

===Blues Junior revision history===
Fender introduced the Blues Junior in 1995 and has revised and updated the amp periodically since then. The Blues Junior history can be divided into two major categories: the early amps with green circuit boards and the later ones with cream-colored boards. The switch to the cream-colored boards reflects the change in where the amps were manufactured, from USA to Mexico. The cream-colored board is laid out entirely differently from the green board. The biggest change is the reworked reverb circuit. The older amps tend to sound darker, while the new ones are brighter with more emphasis on treble tones.

The table Below details the revision dates and the changes made on those dates.

|}

===Dating a Blues Junior===
Fender adopted a two-letter dating code in 1990. The code can be found on the Quality Assurance label located inside the cabinet. The label is often located on the bottom next to the reverb tank, sometimes it is placed on the side. The codes can be handwritten, which can occasionally make the letters hard to decipher.

Fender discontinued date codes in 2003. There is no reliable way to date 2003â2005 amps other than to ask Fender customer support to look up the date from the serial number. Amps made in 2006 have a small metal "Fender 60th Anniversary" button on the back plate. Amps from 2007 are undistinguished.

==Blues Junior III==
In 2010 Fender updated their line of hot rod model amps and released the "Blues Junior III," adding many physical changes to the standard black tolex model. Notable differences include the Fender "lightning bolt" speaker, "sparkle" circuit modification, rattle-reducing shock absorbers, set-screw "chicken head" knobs, "dog bone" handle, larger Fender jewel light, black non-reflective control panel, and "Blues Junior" subtext on the logo plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fender.com/products/search.php?partno=2230500000|title=Fender website|publisher=|accessdate=April 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tube complement and bias setting==
{{unreferencedsection|date=June 2014}}
A set of three matched Groove Tubes 12AX7 preamp tubes and two matched Groove Tubes EL84 power tubes, graded according to Fender's specifications, are used in all factory Blues Juniors. The Blues Junior uses a nonadjustable power tube bias (no way to vary the bias point), but it is fairly "hot" and can accommodate most matched pairs on the market. However, because they "run hot", a common modification is to add a bias trim to enable adjustments to the idle current when switching tubes.

Dugan et al, ''Electrical Power Systems Quality Second Edition'',McGraw-Hill 2002, {{ISBN|0-07-138622-X}}, chapter 4 page 120&lt;/ref&gt;  It can cause overvoltages and overcurrents in an electrical power system and can pose a risk to [[electric power transmission|transmission]] and [[electricity distribution|distribution]] equipment and to operational personnel.&lt;ref name=valverde&gt;{{cite conference| title=Ferroresonance in Voltage Transformers: Analysis and Simulations |url=http://www.icrepq.com/icrepq07/317-valverde.pdf |author1=V.

Ferroresonance should not be confused with linear resonance that occurs when inductive and capacitive reactances of a circuit are equal. In linear resonance the current and voltage are linearly related in a manner which is frequency dependent. In the case of ferroresonance it is characterised by a sudden jump of voltage or current from one stable operating state to another one. The relationship between voltage and current is dependent not only on frequency but also on a number of other factors such as the system voltage magnitude, initial [[magnetic flux]] condition of transformer iron core, the total loss in the ferroresonant circuit and the point on wave of initial switching.&lt;ref name=valverde/&gt;

Ferroresonant effects were first described in a 1907 paper by [[Joseph Bethenod]].&lt;ref name=valverde/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Bethenod |first=J. |title=Sur le Transformateur Ã  RÃ©sonance| journal=LâÃclairage Ãlectrique |volume=53 |date=Nov 30, 1907 |pages=289â96}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "ferroresonance" was apparently coined by French engineer [[Paul Boucherot]] in a paper from 1920, where he analysed the phenomenon of two stable fundamental frequency operating points coexisting in a series circuit containing a resistor, nonlinear inductor and a capacitor.&lt;ref&gt;Boucherot, P.,"Ãxistence de Deux RÃ©gimes en FerrorÃ©sonance", Rev.Gen. de LâÃlec., vol. 8, no. 24, December 11, 1920, pp. 827-828&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, D.A.N., [http://www.ece.mtu.edu/faculty/bamork/FR_WG/Panel/paper03gm0984.pdf ''Examples of Ferroresonance in a High Voltage Power System''], accessed 2011-09-25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conditions ==
Ferroresonance can occur when an unloaded [[3-phase]] system consisting mainly of inductive and capacitive components is interrupted by single phase means.&lt;ref name=dugan2&gt;Dugan, R. C., [http://www.ece.mtu.edu/faculty/bamork/FR_WG/Panel/DuganPanel.pdf ''Examples of Ferroresonance in Distribution Systems''], accessed 2011-09-06&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferracci, Ph., [http://www2.schneider-electric.com/documents/technical-publications/en/shared/electrical-engineering/electrical-environmental-constraints/general-knowledge/ect190.pdf ''Cahier technique nÂ° 190: Ferroresonance''], Groupe Schneider, accessed 2011-09-06&lt;/ref&gt; In the electrical distribution field this typically occurs on a medium voltage [[electrical distribution]] network of [[transformer]]s (inductive component) and [[power cable]]s (capacitive component).  If such a network has little or no resistive [[electrical load|load]] connected and one phase of the applied voltage is then interrupted, ferroresonance can occur.  If the remaining phases are not quickly interrupted and the phenomenon continues, overvoltage can lead to the breakdown of [[electrical insulation|insulation]] in the connected components resulting in their failure.

The phenomenon can be avoided by connecting a minimal resistive load on the transformer secondaries or by interrupting the applied voltage by a 3-phase interrupting device such as a ganged (3 pole) [[circuit breaker]].&lt;ref name=dugan2/&gt;

Picture depicts reversal of counter-current flow to concurrent flow, which may be seen during flooding of a nuclear reactor core.

(A) Counter-current annular flow

(B) Point of flow reversal

(C) Concurrent [[slug flow]] (or other flow)]]

'''Flooding''' refers to a fluid flow phenomenon whereby [[countercurrent exchange|counter-current]] [[two-phase flow]] is reversed and runs concurrent in the direction of the initial gas/vapor phase flow when filling, or "flooding", a [[nuclear reactor core]] with [[coolant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029549310004164| accessdate = 2012-03-02| title=Wall pressure measurements of flooding in vertical countercurrent annular airâwater flow| author=I. Choutapalli and K. Vierow| doi=10.1016/j.nucengdes.2010.06.002| volume=240| journal=Nuclear Engineering and Design| pages=3221â3230}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This phenomenon is generally discussed with respect to a [[loss-of-coolant accident]] (LOCA).  As this phenomenon proceeds, [[Annulus (mathematics)|annular]] flow running counter-current begins as liquid water is inserted into the system.  Then if conditions are correct, the frictional force at the gas-liquid interface begins to reverse the flow of the liquid.  Finally, the flow of the liquid reverses, running concurrently in a slug (or other) flow regime.  The significance of this phenomenon is that, if not properly designed for, it can present issues when trying to fill the core with liquid (the phenomenon works against gravity, forcing liquid out of the core).

==Light water reactor examples==

In a [[boiling water reactor]] (BWR), the [[Nuclear reactor safety systems#Emergency core cooling system .28ECCS.29|emergency core cooling system]] (ECCS) injects liquid water into the reactor core from the top.  Water vapor produced from boiling will flow in the opposite direction.  Given a high enough flow rate of steam, reversal of the ECCS-injected liquid water occurs.

In a [[pressurized water reactor]] (PWR), the ECCS injects liquid into the hot and/or cold leg of the reactor.  The cold leg flows through a downcomer on the outside of the core, before flowing up through the core.  The core barrel and the [[reactor vessel]] wall form a cylindrical shell that is referred to as the downcomer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/teachers/04.pdf| accessdate = 2012-03-01| title=Pressurized Water Reactor Systems - Reactor Vessel}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the cold leg, boiling in the downcomer creates an upward flow of steam that can reverse the flow of liquid water coming in through the cold leg.  The flooding rate in a [[Pressurized Water Reactor|PWR]] is pressure dependent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://pbadupws.nrc.gov/docs/ML0523/ML052340670.pdf| accessdate = 2012-03-01| title=Minimum Containment Pressure Analysis For Emergency Core Cooling System Performance Capability Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar terminology==
Flooding as a fluid flow phenomenon should be distinguished from the act of filling the core with coolant ("flooding of the reactor core"), as the fluid flow phenomenon occurs during the filling process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://pbadupws.nrc.gov/docs/ML0523/ML052340670.pdf| accessdate = 2012-03-01| title=Minimum Containment Pressure Analysis For Emergency Core Cooling System Performance Capability Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Flooding of [[containment building|containment]]" refers to filling the nuclear reactor containment with liquid (usually water), which is distinctly different from either reactor core flooding or flooding as a fluid flow phenomenon.

The '''National Unification Gas Pipeline (''Gas UnificaÃ§Ã£o'' â GASUN)''' will be a {{convert|5000|km|adj=on}} natural gas pipeline in [[Brazil]]. GASUN will connect the [[Gasbol pipeline]] with the northern [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] and the Northeast states ([[ParÃ¡]], [[Tocantins]], [[MaranhÃ£o]] and [[PiauÃ­]]) allowing transportation of [[Bolivia]]n gas into these regions. The project is expected to cost US$2.48&amp;nbsp;billion.

The first stage of GASUN will begin in Mimoso, [[Mato Grosso do Sul]], and will join the Gasbol pipeline. From there it will run towards [[BrasÃ­lia]], passing through [[GoiÃ¢nia]].&lt;ref name=alex1&gt;{{cite web | publisher= Alexander's Oil &amp; Gas Connections |url= http://www.gasandoil.com/GOC/news/ntl41273.htm | title = Brazil's future to run on natural gas | date = March 5, 2004 | accessdate=2007-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of this section started in 2005, and scheduled to be completed in 2007.

The longest and most costly portion of GASUN will be the {{convert|2260|km}} long central-north branch, which is to connect [[GoiÃ¡s]] and [[MaranhÃ£o]]. It will pass through [[Palmas, Tocantins|Palmas]] and [[BelÃ©m]], [[ParÃ¡]]. The entire natural gas pipeline should be complete by 2026.&lt;ref name=alex1/&gt;

{{Desalination}}
'''Geothermal desalination''' is a process under development for the production of [[fresh water]] using [[geothermal power|heat energy]].  Claimed benefits of this method of [[desalination]] are that it requires less maintenance than [[reverse osmosis]] membranes and that the primary [[energy]] input is from [[geothermal heat]], which is a low-environmental-impact source of energy. 

Circa 1995, Douglas Firestone from [[Nevada]] devised the use of geothermal water directly as a source for desalination. In 1998, several individuals began working with evaporation/condensation air loop [[water desalination]]. The experiment was successful and a [[proof of concept]], proving that geothermal waters could be used as process water to produce potable water in 2001. 

In 2005 to 2009  testing was done in a sixth prototype of a device referred to as a delta t device, a closed air loop, atmospheric pressure, evaporation condensation loop geothermally powered desalination device. The device used filtered sea water from [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] and reduced the salt concentration from 35,000 ppm to 51 ppm. 

A total of six prototypes and six modifications demonstrated that, with process water approaching {{convert|100|Â°C}} and a chill source about {{convert|2|Â°C}}, a full-size device would produce about 600 mÂ³ of water per day. [[Salt]] concentration in the wastewater would only be about 10% above the level of the original water, thus, from, say, 35,000 to about 38,000 [[parts per million]], well within the ability of [[osmoregulation|osmoregulators]] to adjust.

[[File:HarmonÃ³grafo_02.webm|thumb|A harmonograph]]
A '''harmonograph''' is a mechanical apparatus that employs [[pendulum]]s to create a geometric image.  The drawings created typically are [[Lissajous curve]]s, or related drawings of greater complexity. The devices, which began to appear in the mid-19th century and peaked in popularity in the 1890s, cannot be conclusively attributed to a single person, although [[Hugh Blackburn]], a professor of [[mathematics]] at the [[University of Glasgow]], is commonly believed to be the official inventor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Turner |first = Steven | title = Demonstrating Harmony: Some of the Many Devices Used To Produce Lissajous Curves Before the Oscilloscope | journal = Rittenhouse | volume = 11 | issue = 42 | page = 41 |date=February 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple, so-called "lateral" harmonograph uses two pendulums to control the movement of a [[pen]] relative to a drawing surface.  One pendulum moves the pen back and forth along one axis and the other pendulum moves the drawing surface back and forth along a [[perpendicular]] axis. By varying the [[frequency]] and phase of the pendulums relative to one another, different patterns are created.  Even a simple harmonograph as described can create [[ellipse]]s, [[spiral]]s, [[wikt:figure eight|figure eights]] and other Lissajous figures.

More complex harmonographs incorporate three or more pendulums or linked pendulums together (for example hanging one pendulum off another), or involve rotary motion in which one or more pendulums is mounted on [[gimbal]]s to allow movement in any direction.

A particular type of harmonograph, a pintograph, is based on the relative motion of two rotating disks, as illustrated in the links below (as opposed to a [[pantograph]], a mechanical device used to enlarge figures). 

==Blackburn pendulum==
[[File:Lissajous figure - sand on paper.jpg|thumb|A Lissajous figure, made by releasing sand from a container at the end of a double pendulum]]
A Blackburn pendulum is a device for illustrating [[simple harmonic motion]], it was named after [[Hugh Blackburn]], who described it in 1844.  This was first discussed by James Dean in 1815 and analyzed mathematically by Nathaniel Bowditch in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Understanding Pendulums: A Brief Introduction|author=L.P. Pook|publisher=Springer|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bob is suspended from a string that in turn hangs from a V-shaped pair of strings, so that the pendulum oscillates simultaneously in two perpendicular directions with different periods.  The bob consequently follows a path resembling a [[Lissajous curve]]; it belongs to the family of mechanical devices known as harmonographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Pendulum: a case study in physics|author=Gregory L. Baker and James A. Blackburn|publisher=Oxford |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mid-20th century physics textbooks sometimes refer to this type of pendulum as a [[Double Pendulum]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Sears]] and Mark W. Zemansky: ''University Physics'', Third Edition, Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer-generated harmonograph figure==
A harmonograph creates its figures using the movements of damped pendulums. The movement of a damped pendulum is described by the equation

:&lt;math&gt;x(t) = A \sin (tf + p) e^{-dt}, \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

in which &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; represents frequency, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; represent phase, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; represent amplitude, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; represents damping and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; represents time. If that pendulum can move about two axes (in a circular or elliptical shape), due to the principle of superposition, the motion of a rod connected to the bottom of the pendulum along one axes will be described by the equation

:&lt;math&gt;x(t) = A_1 \sin (tf_1 + p_1) e^{-d_1t} + A_2 \sin (tf_2 + p_2) e^{-d_2t}. \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

A typical harmonograph has two pendulums that move in such a fashion, and a pen that is moved by two perpendicular rods connected to these pendulums. Therefore, the path of the harmonograph figure is described by the parametric equations

:&lt;math&gt;x(t) = A_1 \sin (tf_1 + p_1) e^{-d_1t} + A_2 \sin (tf_2 + p_2) e^{-d_2t}, \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y(t) = A_3 \sin (tf_3 + p_3) e^{-d_3t} + A_4 \sin (tf_4 + p_4) e^{-d_4t}. \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

An appropriate computer program can translate those equations into a graph that emulates a harmonograph. Applying the first equation a second time to each equation can emulate a moving piece of paper (see the figure below).

[[File:Inkjet paper for sale.JPG|thumb|Paper for inkjet and laser printers in a store.]]

'''Inkjet paper''' is a [[special fine paper]] designed for [[inkjet printer]]s, typically classified by its [[paper size#Expressing paper thickness and density|weight]], [[brightness]] and smoothness, and sometimes by its opacity.

==Manufacture==
{{Main| Paper machine}}

Some inkjet papers are made from high quality [[deinked pulp]] or [[chemical pulp]]s. Quality inkjet paper requires good dimensional stability, no curling or cockling, and good surface strength. For most purposes surface smoothness is required. Sufficient and even porosity is required to counteract spreading of the ink. For lower quality printing, uncoated [[copy paper]] suffices, but higher grades require [[coated paper|coating]]. The traditional coatings are not widely used for inkjet papers. For matte inkjet papers, it is common to use [[silica]] as pigment together with [[polyvinyl alcohol]] (PVOH). Glossy inkjet papers can be made by multicoating, resin coating, or [[resin casting|cast]] coating on a [[lamination paper]].

A variety of fine art inkjet papers meet the needs of professional photographers and artists. These papers share many characteristics with traditional watercolor, printmaking, and photographic papers. Fine art inkjet papers are designed to meet similar standards for longevity as traditional fine art papers: they should have a neutral pH, be [[lignin]]-free, and not include [[optical brightener]]s. Fine art inkjet papers differ from traditional fine art papers, in that they include coatings engineered to receive and hold ink. [http://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/17535/what-is-fine-art-paper Fine art] papers are usually made of rag pulp (100% cotton being the most common) but may also be have an alpha-cellulose base. 
Some descriptions and comparisons of fine art inkjet papers are [http://www.naturephotographers.net/articles1202/mh1202-1.html here], [http://www.macworld.com/article/1054216/inktype.html here], [http://www.amateurphotographer.co.uk/round-ups/accessory_round_ups/best-baryta-inkjet-papers-9153 here], and [https://luminous-landscape.com/battle-of-the-barytas/ here].  Some fine art papers are [http://cool.conservation-us.org/don/dt/dt2266.html mold made], while others are [[Paper machine|machine made]], and may vary considerably in surface texture. Many fine art papers are available in pre-cut sheets or in rolls.

== Comparison to standard office paper ==
[[File:Cheap plotter paper soaked with ink - swelled fibers show papermaking mesh belt pattern.JPG|thumb|Example cheap uncoated paper heavily soaked with ink, showing the back of the paper. The moisture-soaked fibers swell and revert to their original shape, showing the mesh belt webbing used in the paper manufacturing plant.]]
Standard office paper has traditionally been designed for use with typewriters and copy machines, where the paper usually does not get wet. With these papers, moisture tends to [[Capillary action|wick]] through the fibers and away from the point of contact. For inkjet printing, this dulls edges of lines and graphic boundaries, and lessens pigment intensity.

High-quality [[inkjet printing]] with dark, crisp lines requires that the paper have exactly the right absorbency to accept the ink but prevent sideways spread. Many general-purpose office papers of weights around 21 to 27&amp;nbsp;lb (80â100 g/mÂ²) have been reformulated to work equally well with both [[inkjet printer|inkjet]] and [[laser printer]]s. However, this category of paper is only suitable for printing text, because the ink load is light.

Paper is manufactured by forming pulp fibers into a mat on an open mesh screen (a [[deckle]]), and then drying and pressing this mat into paper. Large areas of inkjet color, such as in graphics and photographs, soak the paper fibers with so much moisture that they swell and return to their original shape before pressing, resulting in a wavy buckling of the paper surface.

Double-sided inkjet printing is usually not possible with inexpensive low-weight copy paper because of bleed-through from one side to the other. These papers are also unsuitable for photographic work because standard office paper is usually not "white" enough. This results in a poor [[gamut|color gamut]] and leads to "muddy" colors. For all types of paper, printer driver settings must be adjusted to suit the paper, so that the printer delivers the right amount of ink.

== Inkjet photo paper ==
[[Photographic paper|Photo paper]] is inkjet paper specifically for printing photographs. It is a bright white due to [[bleaching]] or pigments such as [[titanium dioxide]], and has been coated with a highly absorbent material that limits diffusion of the ink. Highly refined [[clay]] is a common coating to prevent ink spread.

The best of these papers, with suitable pigment-based ink systems, can match or exceed the image quality and longevity of photographic gelatin-based [[silver halide]] [[continuous tone]] printing methods used for color photographs, such as [[Fujifilm|Fuji]] CrystalArchive (for color prints from negatives) and [[Ilfochrome|Cibachrome/Ilfochrome]] (for color prints from positive transparencies). For printing monochrome photographs, traditional silver-based papers are widely felt{{by whom|date=April 2013}} to retain some advantage over inkjet prints.

Photo paper is typically divided into ''[[glossy]]'', ''semi-matte'', ''semi-gloss'', ''satin'' or ''silk'', and ''[[gloss (material appearance)|matte]]'' finishes. Paper thickness varies widely. Lighter weights are not much different from the general-purpose office papers described above, and can be used for all types of printing, though these are the least expensive and lowest-quality photo papers.

Photo papers for more critical work are thicker and have advanced coatings, sometimes with quick-drying properties. They can normally be printed only on the one specially coated side. A few papers are coated for double-sided printing.

Glossy photo paper, generally the most popular, has a shiny finish that gives photos a vivid look. It is generally smooth to the touch and has some glare. Matte photo paper is less shiny, and produces superior text results. Matte and glossy prints typically feel different to the touch, but when displayed under glass they often look similar. Papers with an imitation canvas texture emulate the look of oil paintings. Photo papers are usually high-brightness, neutral white papers, but off-white papers are available.

As in [[offset printing|offset litho printing]] and traditional [[photographic printing]], glossy papers give the highest color [[optical density|density]] (or D&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;), and therefore the widest [[gamut|color gamut]]. Photo papers vary in their longevity and their color gamut. Ink suppliers often provide [[ICC profile|color profiles]] for their ink systems when used with specific papers. Longevity depends on the specific combination of inks and paper. For maximum life, the paper substrate is "wood-free" (i.e., wood-based but without lignin), or cotton-based, or a combination of the two. Plastic substrates also exist.

No official paper industry standard defines glossy, semi-matte, etcetera, though an objective scale is available for the glossiness of papers used in [[offset printing|offset litho printing]]. [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Epson]] and [[Kodak]] all use their own terms to describe their paper, such as Everyday (HP), Premium High Gloss and Luster (Epson) and Ultima (Kodak). ECI (www.eci.org) has categorized papers for proofing simulation of litho papers (type1/2 etc.)

;Types of Paper
:Glossy
::Glossy paper has a shiny surface. Light that falls on it reflects at a [[complementary angle]]. Users must handle glossy paper carefully to avoid finger spots.
:Luster
::Luster papers are shiny, but less so than glossy papers.
:Metallic
::Metallic paper has a sheet of [[BoPET]] between the printing paper and the emulsion.

The '''Ituango Dam''', also referred to as the '''Pescadero-Ituango Dam''', is an  [[embankment dam]] currently under construction on the [[Cauca River]] near [[Ituango]] in [[Antioquia Department]], [[Colombia]]. The primary purpose of the project is hydroelectric power generation and its power plant will have an [[installed capacity]] of {{convert|2456|MW}} when completed. Preliminary construction on the dam began in September 2011 and the power plant was expected to begin operations in late 2018, but will not after heavy rainfall and landslides in April/May 2018 blocked river's diversion tunnel, threatening a breach of the dam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chadbourne Represented EPM Ituango in BOOMT Contract for the 2400 MW Hidroituango Project |url=http://www.chadbourne.com/Chadbourne-Represented-EPM-ITUANGO-in-BOOMT-CONTRACT-FOR-THE-2400-MW-HIDROITUANGO-PROJECT-04-28-2011/ |accessdate=9 July 2011 |date=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When completed, it will be the largest power station in Colombia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=China, South Korea companies in race for Colombia hydropower deal |url=http://colombiareports.com/colombia-news/economy/8005-china-south-korea-companies-in-race-for-colombia-hydropower-deal-.html |publisher=Colombia Reports |accessdate=9 July 2011|date=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The dam's feasibility study was completed in 1983 but the project was shelved in the 1990s due to an economic crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colombia hydro utility to build 2,688-MW Pescadero Ituango |url=http://www.hydroworld.com/index/display/article-display/99999/articles/hrhrw/News/Colombia_hydro_utility_to_build_2688-MW_Pescadero_Ituango.html |publisher=HydroWorld|accessdate=9 July 2011 |date=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final designs for the project were finished in 2008 and on 8 July 2011, the project management contract was awarded. Preliminary construction (surveying, roads, bridges, diversion tunnels) began in September 2011 and it is expected to be complete in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Construction preparation begins for 2,400-MW Ituango in Colombia |url=http://www.hydroworld.com/index/display/article-display.articles.hrhrw.hydroindustrynews.newdevelopment.2011.09.construction-preparation-begins-for-2400-mw-ituango-in-colombia.QP129867.dcmp=rss.page=1.html |publisher=Hydro World |accessdate=29 March 2012|date=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Main works will begin thereafter and the power plant is expected to being commissioning in 2018. Development of the project is being proposed by EPM Ituango, a consortium of Empresas Publicas de Medellin (EPM) and the Antioquia government. The total cost is expected to be US$2.8 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Evolution of Expansion Plans |url=http://www.epm.com.co/docs-bid/energia/proyectos-energia-EN.pdf |publisher=EPM |accessdate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Consortium wins US66 million contract for Ituango hydro project build in Colombia |url=http://www.hydroworld.com/index/display/article-display/7635287117/articles/hrhrw/hydroindustrynews/newdevelopment/2011/07/consortium-wins_us66.html |publisher=HydroWorld |accessdate=9 July 2011|date=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The dam will be a {{Convert|225|m|adj=on}} tall earth-fill embankment type with a clay core. The volume of the dam will be {{Convert|19|e6m3|}}. Its [[reservoir]] will have a capacity of {{Convert|2720|e6m3|acre.ft|adj=on}} of which {{Convert|980|e6m3|acre.ft||adj=on}} will be active (or "useful") capacity. The reservoir will be {{Convert|127|km}} long and cover an area of {{Convert|38|km2|}}. To maintain reservoir levels, the dam will have a [[spillway]] controlled by four [[radial gate]]s with a design flow of {{Convert|22600|m3/s}}. The dam's power plant will have a nominal [[hydraulic head]] of {{Convert|197|m}} and contain eight {{convert|307|MW}} [[Francis turbine]]-generators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Datos TÃ©cnicos |url=http://www.hidroituango.com.co/hidroituango/index.php/es/el-proyecto/datos-tecnicos |publisher=HidroelÃ©ctrica Ituango |accessdate=9 July 2011 |language=Spanish }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diversion tunnel blockage  ==
Three tunnels were constructed to divert the Cauca River around the construction site. Two were eventually sealed during construction, leaving a third to divert the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Reabren 3 tÃºneles para evacuar aguas embalsadas en Hidroituango |url=http://caracol.com.co/emisora/2018/05/08/medellin/1525779198_834090.html |publisher=Caracol Radio |accessdate=17 May 2018|date=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 28 April and 7 May 2018, three landslides blocked the tunnel, leading the reservoir to fill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=

On May 16 silt build-up in a portion of the power house, the only means to drain the reservoir, led to water escaping into a transit gallery used by construction vehicles. The water eventually poured onto the downstream face of the dam, eroding the roadway and a portion of the [[riprap]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title="Hubo una obstrucciÃ³n en la casa de mÃ¡quinas": EPM sobre emergencia en Hidroituango |url=https://www.elespectador.com/noticias/nacional/hubo-una-obstruccion-en-la-casa-de-maquinas-epm-sobre-emergencia-en-hidroituango-articulo-788913 |publisher=El Espectador |accessdate=17 May 2018|date=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, EPM announced a risk of collapse existed and workers continued to fill the dam to its design height in hopes the spillway could be used to prevent an over-topping of the dam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=âExiste la posibilidad de que se rompa la presa de Hidroituangoâ: gerente de EPM |url=https://www.elespectador.com/economia/existe-la-posibilidad-de-que-se-rompa-la-presa-de-hidrotuango-presidente-de-epm-articulo-789028 |publisher=El Espectador |accessdate=17 May 2018|date=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy rainfall was expected in the Cauca River basin through the end of May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colombia Ituango Dam Emergency 22 May 2018|url=https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/ECDM_20180522_Colombia_Dam_Floods.pdf|website=Relief Web|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The financial loss that has emanated from this is large and the proximate cause is, without a doubt, Natural Perils given the rainfall.

==Ecological impact==
The dam construction has severe ecological consequences, and there are displaced families, environmentalists, youth groups and concerned locals that oppose the project.&lt;ref name="mond_Colo"&gt;{{Cite web

The '''Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission''', also known as the '''National Solar Mission''', is an initiative of the [[Government of India]] and State Governments to promote solar power. The mission is one of the several initiatives that are part of the National Action Plan on Climate Change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c2es.org/international/country-policies/india-climate-plan-summary/06-2008 India's National Action Plan on Climate Change - Highlights]&lt;/ref&gt; The program was inaugurated&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2010/01/12/stories/2010011260911100.htm JNNSM Inauguration]&lt;/ref&gt; by former [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Manmohan Singh]] on 11 January 2010&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnre.gov.in/solar-mission/jnnsm/introduction-2/ |title=Ministry of New and Renewable Energy - Scheme / Documents |publisher=Mnre.gov.in |date= |accessdate=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a target of 20GW by 2022 which was later increased to 100 GW by the [[Modi ministry|Narendra Modi government]] in the [[2015 Union budget of India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=122566|title=Revision of cumulative targets under National Solar Mission from 20,000 MW by 2021-22 to 1,00,000 MW|last=|first=|date=|website=pib.nic.in|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; India increased its solar power generation capacity by nearly 5 times from 2,650 MW on 26 May 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=India's solar capacity to cross 20GW in next 15 months: Piyush Goyal|url=http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/2242515-2242515.html|website=Money Control|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 12,288.83 MW on 31 March 2017. The country added 5,525.98 MW in 2016-17, the highest of any year.&lt;ref name = "2016-17 addition"/&gt;

==Objective==
[[File:Solar Resource Map of India.png|thumb|[[Solar irradiance|Solar Resource]] Map of India]]
The objective of the National Solar Mission is to establish [[India]] as a global leader in [[solar energy]], by creating the policy conditions for its diffusion across the country as quickly as possible. Under the original plan, the Government aimed to achieve a total installed solar capacity of 20 GW by 2022. This was proposed to be achieved in three phase. The first phase comprised the period from 2010 to 2013, the first year of the 12th five-year plan. The second phase extended up to 2017, while the third phase would have been the 13th five-year plan (2017â22). Targets were set as 1.4 GW in the first phase, 11-15 GW by the end of the second phase and 22 GW by the end of the third phase in 2022.&lt;ref name = "JNNSM Dec 2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jawaharlal Nehru  National Solar Mission Phase II  â Policy Document|url=http://mnre.gov.in/file-manager/UserFiles/draft-jnnsmpd-2.pdf|website=Ministry of New &amp; Renewable Energy|accessdate=27 March 2017|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government revised the target from 20 GW to 100 GW on 1 July 2015. To reach 100 GW by 2022, the yearly targets from 2015-16 onwards were also revised upwards.&lt;ref name = "revised targets"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kapoor|first1=Tarun|title=Scaling up of Grid Connected Solar Power Projects|url=http://mnre.gov.in/file-manager/grid-solar/100000MW-Grid-Connected-Solar-Power-Projects-by-2021-22.pdf|website=Ministry of New and Renewable Energy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170226140523/http://mnre.gov.in/file-manager/grid-solar/100000MW-Grid-Connected-Solar-Power-Projects-by-2021-22.pdf|archivedate=February 26, 2017|date=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; India had an installed solar capacity of 161 MW on 31 March 2010, about 2 and half months after the mission was launched on 11 January. By 31 March 2015, three months before the targets were revised, India had achieved an installed solar capacity of 3,744 MW.&lt;ref name = "revised targets"/&gt;

===Year-wise targets===
To meet the scaled up target of 100,000 MW, MNRE has proposed to achieve it through 60 GW of large and medium scale solar projects, and 40 GW through rooftop solar projects.

==Phase 1 (2010-13)==
The first phase of this mission aims to commission 1000 MW of grid-connected [[solar power]] projects by 2013. The implementation of this phase is in hands of a subsidiary of [[National Thermal Power Corporation]], the largest power producer in India. The subsidiary, NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Ltd (NVVN),&lt;ref&gt;[http://nvvn.co.in/ NVVN]&lt;/ref&gt; laid out guidelines for selection of developers for commissioning grid connected solar power projects in India. See [http://www.mnre.gov.in/solar%20energy%20conclave%202010/solar-energy-conclave-2010-2.pdf JNNSM Phase 1 Guidelines]. While NVVN is the public face of this phase, several other departments and ministries will play a significant role in formulating guidelines. NVVN will sign [[power purchase agreements]] with the developers. Since NVVN is not a [[Public utility|utility]], it will sell purchased power to different state utilities via separate agreements.

=== Technologies ===
For Phase 1 projects, NVVN started with a proposal for 50:50 allocation towards [[Photovoltaic system|solar PV]] and [[Solar thermal energy|solar thermal]]. The latter is quite ambitious given India has no operational solar thermal projects and less than 10MW of solar PV projects. While growing at a rapid pace lately, solar thermal technologies are still evolving globally. The first batch of projects allotted for Phase 1 included 150MW of Solar PV and 500MW of Solar Thermal. NVVN issued Request for Selection document outlining criteria for selection of projects under the Phase 1. See [http://www.nvvn.co.in/RFS%20Document%20-%20Solar%20Thermal.pdf Solar Thermal RFS], [http://www.nvvn.co.in/RFS%20Document%20-%20Solar%20PV.pdf Solar PV RfS]

A growing solar PV industry in India is hoping to take off by supplying equipment to power project developers. Well known equipment manufacturers started increasing their presence in India and may give competition to local Indian manufacturers. Due to generally high temperatures in India, [[Polycrystalline silicon|crystalline silicon]]-based products are not the most ideal ones. [[Thin film solar cell|Thin film]] technologies like [[amorphous silicon]], [[Copper indium gallium selenide#CIGS photovoltaic cells|CIGS]] and [[Cadmium telluride|CdTe]] could be more suitable for higher temperature situations.

Solar thermal technology providers barely have a foothold in India. A few technology providers like [[Abengoa]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abengoasolar.com/corp/web/en/about_us/international_presence/index.html abengoa]&lt;/ref&gt; have some Indian presence in anticipation of demand from this mission.

=== NVVN Solar PV  allotment process for Phase 1 ===
NVVN issued Request for Selection notice for allotment of capacity to Independent Power Producers (IPPs). See [http://www.nvvn.co.in/RFS%20Document%20-%20Solar%20PV.pdf NVVN Solar PV RfS]. 150MWs of Solar PV and 470MW of Solar Thermal were up for allotment under the first batch of Phase 1 projects. Project size per IPP was fixed at 5MW for Solar PV and 100MW for Solar Thermal projects. To avoid allocating entire capacity to a select few corporate, guidelines required no two projects to have the same parent company or common shareholders. In case of over subscription, a reverse bidding process was to be used to select the final IPPs based on lowest tariff they offer. Several hundred  IPPs responded to this RfS.

The approach for reverse bidding and methodology to calculate the discount to be offered was presented by Shri Shakti Alternative Energy Ltd through a webinar on 19 October 2010 on the eve of the reverse bidding by NVVN [http://www.ssael.co.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=67&amp;Itemid=82 Download presentation on Reverse Bidding by NVVN - What to Expect].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssael.co.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=67&amp;Itemid=82 Webinar On Reverse Bidding Strategy]&lt;/ref&gt; The quantum of discount would depend on project site location (i.e. solar radiation), technology used, simulated energy generation, capital cost and interest cost. Multivariate analysis was carried out using key variables like capital cost, interest and the capacity utilization factor (i.e. CUF which is actual generation of the plant and depends on the location (radiation) and technology used)to calculate the levelized tariff for a target equity IRR based on which the discount to be offered can be determined.

The final 30 solar PV projects&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NVVN Phase 1 Batch 1 Solar PV Projects|url=http://www.nvvn.co.in/Selected%20Projects%20List.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  selected had bids between INR 10.95 to INR 12.75. The Solar Thermal projects selected had bids between INR 10.24 to INR 12.24.  PPAs were signed with IPPs in early January.

==2014-present==
In December 2014, the Government of India introduced a scheme to establish at least 25 solar parks and [[Ultra Mega Solar Power Projects]] to add over 20 GW of installed solar power capacity. The Central Government provides financial support for the construction of these solar projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=121060|title=Scheme for Development of Ultra Mega Solar Parks|date=|publisher=Pib.nic.in|accessdate=2016-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2016, the Central Government has provided in-principle approval to set up 34 solar parks across 21 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/large-scale-solar-projectsindia-atmercypoor-infra-926899.html|title=Large-scale solar projects in India at the mercy of poor infra|website=www.moneycontrol.com|access-date=2017-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each power project has a minimum capacity of 500 MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Smiti Mittal|url=http://cleantechnica.com/2014/09/15/india-considers-adding-20-gw-capacity-ultra-mega-solar-power-projects/ |title=India Considers Adding 20 GW Capacity Through Ultra Mega Solar Power Projects |publisher=Cleantechnica.com |date=2014-09-15 |accessdate=2016-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Domestic content complaint ==
Guidelines for the solar mission mandated cells and modules for solar PV projects based on crystalline silicon to be manufactured in India. That accounts to over 60% of total system costs. For solar thermal, guidelines mandated 30% project to have domestic content. A vigorous controversy emerged between power project developers and solar PV equipment manufacturers. The former camp prefers to source modules by accessing highly competitive global market to attain flexible pricing, better quality, predictable delivery and use of latest technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[Kevin Roebuck, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UEYPBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA87&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;dq=The+former+camp+prefers+to+source+modules+by+accessing+highly+competitive+global+market+to+attain+flexible+pricing,+better+quality,+predictable+delivery+and+use+of+latest+technologies.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BJRKWD5PNY&amp;sig=0xCbmAeg-_d-nHEXTvp18nf_W54&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=r2JAVYGbIYnuoASL-4DYDA&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20former%20camp%20prefers%20to%20source%20modules%20by%20accessing%20highly%20competitive%20global%20market%20to%20attain%20flexible%20pricing%2C%20better%20quality%2C%20predictable%20delivery%20and%20use%20of%20latest%20technologies.&amp;f=false Solar PPA: High-impact Strategies - What You Need to Know: Definitions, Adoptions, Impact, Benefits, Maturity, Vendors], pg. 87]&lt;/ref&gt; The latter camp prefers a controlled/planned environment to force developers to purchase modules from a small, albeit growing, group of module manufacturers in India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-05-12/edit-page/28285093_1_solar-energy-renewable-energy-modules-from-other-countries domesticPro]&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturers want to avoid competition with global players and are lobbying the government to incentivise growth of local industry{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}.

Market responded to domestic content requirement by choosing to procure thin film modules from well established international players. A significant number of announced project completions are using modules from outside India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Solar to supply modules for an Indian Solar PV developer|url=http://investor.firstsolar.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=201491&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1505898&amp;highlight=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trina supplying modules for an Indian Solar PV plant|url=http://powerwatchindia.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=240:trina-solar-completes-5-mw-power-project-in-india&amp;catid=2:news&amp;Itemid=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[US Trade Representative]] has filed a complaint at [[World Trade Organization]] challenging  Indiaâs domestic content requirements in Phase II of this Mission, citing  discrimination  against US exports and that industry in US which has invested hugely will be at loss. US insists that such restrictions are prohibited by WTO.

[[File:Benjamin West, English (born America) - Benjamin Franklin Drawing Electricity from the Sky - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|An artistic rendition of Franklin's kite experiment painted by [[Benjamin West]].]]

The '''kite experiment''' is a scientific experiment in which a kite with a pointed, conductive wire attached to its apex is flown near thunder clouds to collect electricity from the air and conduct it down the wet kite string to the ground. It was proposed and may have been conducted by [[Benjamin Franklin]] with the assistance of his son [[William Franklin]]. The experiment's purpose was to uncover the unknown facts about the nature of [[lightning]] and [[electricity]], and with further experiments on the ground, to demonstrate that lightning and electricity were the result of the same phenomenon.

==Background==
Speculations of [[Jean-Antoine Nollet]] had led to the issue of the electrical nature of lightning being posed as a prize question at Bordeaux in 1749. In 1750, it was the subject of public discussion in France, with a dissertation of [[Denis Barberet]] receiving a prize in [[Bordeaux]]; Barberet proposed a cause in line with the [[triboelectric effect]]. The same year, Franklin reversed his previous skepticism of electrical lightning's attraction to high points.&lt;ref name="Zweiacker2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pierre Zweiacker|title=SacrÃ©e foudre !: Ou la scandaleuse invention de Benjamin F.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TVzvLNbayPwC&amp;pg=PA105|accessdate=September 1, 2018|date=November 24, 2011|publisher=[[Presses polytechniques et universitaires romandes]]|isbn=978-2-88074-943-9|page=105|language=fr|quote=As for Franklin, who doubted in 1749 that the lightning was attracted by the spikes, he wrote ... the following year: 'When the electrified clouds pass over a country, the summits of mountains and trees, the high towers, the pyramids, the masts of the ships, the chimneys, etc., like so many eminences and peaks, attract the electric fire, and the whole cloud is unloaded.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physicist [[Jacques de Romas]] also wrote a [[mÃ©moire]] with similar ideas that year, and later defended them as independent of Franklin's.&lt;ref name="Heilbron1979"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. L. Heilbron|title=Electricity in the 17th and 18th Centuries: A Study of Early Modern Physics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UlTLRUn1sy8C&amp;pg=PA351|accessdate=October 29, 2012|year=1979|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|isbn=978-0-520-03478-5|page=351 note 32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lightning rod experiments==
In 1752, Franklin proposed an experiment with [[conductive]] rods to attract lightning to a [[leyden jar]], an early form of [[capacitor]]. Such an experiment was carried out in May 1752 at [[Marly-la-Ville]] in northern France  by [[Thomas-FranÃ§ois Dalibard]].&lt;ref name="Riskin2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jessica Riskin|title=Science in the Age of Sensibility: The Sentimental Empiricists of the French Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QpWa9XSnFx4C&amp;pg=PA101|accessdate=October 29, 2012|date=December 15, 2002|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|isbn=978-0-226-72078-4|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; An attempt to replicate the experiment killed [[Georg Wilhelm Richmann]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] in August 1753; he was thought to be the victim of [[ball lightning]].&lt;ref name="RakovUman2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Vladimir A.

However, the spire at Christ Church was not added until 1754.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Franklin's Kite Experiment==
Franklin's kite experiment was performed in Philadelphia in June 1752, according to the account by Priestly.&lt;ref name="archives" /&gt; Franklin described the experiment in the ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette]]'' in October 19, 1752,&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Franklin, [http://franklinpapers.org/franklin/framedVolumes.jsp?vol=4&amp;page=360a "The Kite Experiment"], printed in ''[[The Pennsylvania Gazette]]'', October 19, 1752. In The Papers of
Benjamin Franklin, The American Philosophical Society and Yale University; digital edition by The Packard Humanities Institute, Volume 4, page 360a. Retrieved February 6, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Historical Society, [http://www.benjamin-franklin-history.org/pennsylvania-gazette/ Benjamin Franklin History]. Retrieved February 6, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; without mentioning that he himself had performed it.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Johnson (2008) ''The Invention of Air'', p. 39 {{ISBN|978-1-59448-401-8}}. Retrieved February 6, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; This account was read to the Royal Society on December 21 and printed as such in the ''Philosophical Transactions''.&lt;ref name="archives" /&gt;
A more complete account of Franklin's experiment was given by [[Joseph Priestley]] in 1767, who presumably learned the details directly from Franklin, who was in London at the time Priestley wrote the book.&lt;ref name="archives"&gt;National Archives, [https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-04-02-0135 The Kite Experiment, 19 October 1752]. Retrieved February 6, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BEP-JONES-Franklin and Electricity.jpg|thumb|The [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing|BEP]] [[Art and engraving on United States banknotes|engraved]] the vignette ''Franklin and Electricity'' (c. 1860) which was used on the $10 National Bank Note from the 1860s to 1890s.]]
According to the 1767 Priestley account, Franklin realized the dangers of using conductive rods and instead used the conductivity of a wet hemp string attached to a [[kite]]. This allowed him to stay on the ground while his son assisted him to fly the kite from the shelter of a nearby shed. This enabled Franklin and his son to keep the silk string of the kite dry to insulate them while the hemp string to the kite was allowed to get wet in the rain to provide conductivity. A house key belonging to [[Benjamin Loxley]] was attached to the hemp string and connected to a [[Leyden jar]]; a silk string was attached to this. "At this key he charged phials, and from the electric fire thus obtained, he kindled spirits, and performed all other electrical experiments which are usually exhibited by an excited globe or tube." The kite was not struck by visible lightning; had it been, Franklin would almost certainly have been killed.&lt;ref name= "mythbusters"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/mythbusters-database/ben-franklin-electricity/|title=Franklin Discovered Electricity with Kite|last=|first=|date=April 11, 2012|website=Mythbusters|publisher=|access-date=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Franklin did notice that loose threads of the kite string were repelling each other and deduced that the Leyden jar was being charged. He moved his hand near the key and observed an electric spark,&lt;ref name="archives" /&gt; proving the electric nature of lightning.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Rubin, [http://www.juliantrubin.com/bigten/franklinkite.html Benjamin Franklin - Master of Electricity: The Kite Experiment and the Invention of the Lightning Rod] (article about Franklin and the experiment). Retrieved February 6, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Pennsylvania Gazette's account===
The Kite Experiment was described in The Pennsylvania Gazette, October 19, 1752 as follows:

{{quote
|quote= Franklin's Statement
Philadelphia, October 19

As frequent Mention is made in the News Papers from Europe, of the Success of the Philadelphia Experiment for drawing the Electric Fire from Clouds by Means of pointed Rods of Iron erected on high Buildings, &amp;c. it may be agreeable to the Curious to be inform'd, that the same Experiment has succeeded in Philadelphia, tho' made in a different and more easy Manner, which any one may try, as follows.

Make a small Cross of two light Strips of Cedar, the Arms so long as to reach to the four Corners of a large thin Silk Handkerchief when extended; tie the Corners of the Handkerchief to the Extremities of the Cross, so you have the Body of a Kite; which being properly accommodated with a Tail, Loop and String, will rise in the Air, like those made of Paper; but this being of Silk is fitter to bear the Wet and Wind of a Thunder Gust without tearing. To the Top of the upright Stick of the Cross is to be fixed a very sharp pointed Wire, rising a Foot or more above the Wood. To the End of the Twine, next the Hand, is to be tied a silk Ribbon, and where the Twine and the silk join, a Key may be fastened. This Kite is to be raised when a Thunder Gust appears to be coming on, and the Person who holds the String must stand within a Door, or Window, or under some Cover, so that the Silk Ribbon may not be wet; and Care must be taken that the Twine does not touch the Frame of the Door or Window. As soon as any of the Thunder Clouds come over the Kite, the pointed Wire will draw the Electric Fire from them, and the Kite, with all the Twine, will be electrified, and the loose Filaments of the Twine will stand out every Way, and be attracted by an approaching Finger. And when the Rain has wet the Kite and Twine, so that it can conduct the Electric Fire freely, you will find it stream out plentifully from the Key on the Approach of your Knuckle. At this Key the Phial may be charg'd; and from Electric Fire thus obtain'd, Spirits may be kindled, and all the other Electric Experiments be perform'd, which are usually done by the Help of a rubbed Glass Globe or Tube; and thereby the Sameness of the Electric Matter with that of Lightning compleatly demonstrated.}}

==Modern controversy==
The standard account of Franklin's experiment is disputed by science historian Tom Tucker in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Bolt-Fate-Benjamin-Franklin-Electric/dp/0756793327 ''Bolt of Fate'' by Tom Tucker Public Affairs books 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tucker, Franklin never performed the experiment, and the kite as described is incapable of performing its alleged role.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Matthews, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/3308983/Benjamin-Franklin-faked-kite-experiment.html "Benjamin Franklin 'faked kite experiment' "], ''The Telegraph,'' June 1, 2003.

'''Liberty Puzzles''' is a manufacturer of classic style wooden [[jigsaw puzzles]] based in [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], Colorado. It was founded in 2005 by Christopher Wirth and his business partner Jeffrey Eldridge, after Wirthâs family inherited several hand-cut wooden puzzles from the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cutrofello | first = Tom | title = Pieces of Art: Cutting Edge Jigsaws | publisher = Games Magazine | year =  2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surprised by the value of hand-cut wooden jigsaw puzzles (which can sell for more than $1,000 each), Wirth decided to start a business using modern cutting technologies, with a goal of producing puzzles in the $100 range.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Eric (Nov. 2008). âLiberty Puzzles: Colorado Cool Stuff.â Entrepreneur Magazine. http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/189501399.html&lt;/ref&gt; Wirth is the son of former Colorado senator [[Tim Wirth]]. 

Liberty Puzzles is the largest or second largest wooden jigsaw puzzle manufacturer in America as of 2011. The company offers over 600 different puzzle images, with an emphasis on fine art, vintage prints and Asian art. They continuously expand their range, increasingly with local contemporary artists. 

The puzzles are made in [[Boulder, Colorado]] with archival paper and inks adhered to quarter-inch maple plywood cut with computer-controlled laser cutters. The puzzle designs are modeled after the puzzles popular in the early-twentieth century. Jigsaw puzzle historian Bob Armstrong notes: "the style of cutting and figure pieces emulates the Falls puzzles from the 1930s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Armstrong | first = Bob | title = Puzzles Cut By Today's Makers |  url = http://www.oldpuzzles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberty's puzzles include a relatively large number of whimsy pieces (pieces shaped recognizably, for example, as storks or swans), "as much as 20 percent of the pieces... [in some puzzles]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cutrofello | first = Tom |title = Pieces of Art: Cutting Edge Jigsaws | publisher = Games Magazine | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Liberty Puzzles include the company's signature whimsy piece in the shape of an eagle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7012">{{mergeto | Lifting gas|date=February 2018}}

'''Lighter than air''' refers to materials (usually [[gas]]es) that are [[buoyancy|buoyant]] in [[air]] because they have [[density|average densities]] lower than [[density of air|that of air]].  Dry air has a density of about 1.29 [[g/L]] (gram per liter) at [[standard conditions for temperature and pressure]] (STP) and an average molecular mass of 28.97 [[Molar mass|g/mol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/molecular-mass-air-d_679.html|title=Air - Molecular Weight|website=www.engineeringtoolbox.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these gases are used as [[lifting gas]]es in [[aerostat|lighter-than-air aircraft]], which include [[balloon (aircraft)|free balloons]], [[moored balloon]]s, and [[airships]]. Heavier-than-air [[aircraft]] include [[airplane]]s, gliders and helicopters.

==Usage as lifting gas==
{{main|Lifting gas}}

=== Hot air ===
[[Hot air balloon|Hot air]] is frequently used in recreational ballooning. Hot air is lighter than air at ambient temperature, to a degree which can be approximated using the [[ideal gas law]].

=== Neon ===
[[Neon]] (density 0.900 g/L at STP, average atomic mass 20.17g/mol) is lighter than air and will lift a balloon. However, it is relatively rare on Earth, expensive, and is among the heavier of the lifting gases.

=== Water vapor ===
[[Water vapor]] (density 0.804 g/L at STP, average molecular mass 18.015 g/mol) is lighter than air, and has successfully been used as a lifting gas. It is generally impractical due to high boiling point and condensation.

===Ammonia===
[[Ammonia]] (density 0.769 g/L at STP, average molecular mass 17.03 g/mol) has sometimes been used to fill [[weather balloon]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/gas-density-d_158.html|title=Gases - Density|website=www.engineeringtoolbox.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its relatively high boiling point (compared to helium and hydrogen), ammonia could potentially be refrigerated and liquified aboard an airship to reduce lift and add ballast (and returned to a gas to add lift and reduce ballast).

===Methane===
[[Methane]] (density 0.716 g/L at STP, average molecular mass 16.04 g/mol) is the chief component of [[natural gas]] and is sometimes used as a lift gas when hydrogen and helium are not available.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It has the advantage of not leaking through balloon walls as rapidly as the small-moleculed hydrogen and helium. Many lighter-than-air balloons are made of aluminized plastic that limits such leakage; hydrogen and helium leak rapidly through latex balloons.

===Hydrogen and helium===
[[Hydrogen]] (density 0.090 g/L at STP, average molecular mass 2.016 g/mol) and [[helium]] (density 0.179 g/L at STP, average molecular mass 4.003 g/mol) are the most commonly used lift gases. Although helium is twice as heavy as (diatomic) hydrogen, they are both much lighter than air that this difference only results in hydrogen having 8% more [[buoyancy]] than helium.

In a practical [[Airship|dirigible]] design, the difference is significant, making a 50% difference in the fuel-carrying capacity of the dirigible and hence increasing its range significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,786149-2,00.html|title=AERONAUTICS: Helium vs. Hydrogen|last=|first=|date=1924-03-10|website=|publisher=TIME|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209024932/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,786149-2,00.html|archive-date=February 9, 2011|dead-url=|accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, hydrogen is extremely flammable and its use as a lifting gas in dirigibles has decreased since the [[Hindenburg disaster]]. Helium is safer as a lifting gas because it is inert and does not undergo combustion. 

== Others ==

=== Nitrogen ===
[[Nitrogen]] gas (density 1.251 g/L at STP, average atomic mass 28.00 g/mol) is about 3% lighter than air, insufficient for common use as a lifting gas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Solids ===
In 2002, [[aerogel]] held the [[Guinness World Record]] for the least dense (lightest) solid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/TECH/space/05/09/record.gel/index.html|title=CNN.com - NASA's 'frozen smoke' named lightest solid - May  9, 2002|last=CNN|first=Richard Stenger|website=edition.cnn.com|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aerogel is mostly air because its structure is like that of a highly vacuous [[sponge]]. The lightness and low [[density]] is due primarily to the large proportion of air within the solid and not the [[silicon]] construction materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/topics/technology/features/aerogels.html|title=Aerogels: Thinner, Lighter, Stronger|last=Administrator|first=NASA Content|date=2015-04-15|work=NASA|access-date=2018-01-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking advantage of this, [[SEAgel]], in the same family as aerogel but made from [[agar]], can be filled with  helium  gas to create a solid which floats when placed in an open top container filled with a dense gas.&lt;ref name="Discovery Channel"&gt;{{Citation|last=Grommo|title=SEAgel Aerogel lighter than air solid. Not a UFO|date=2008-06-20|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoCAxS4vqwQ|accessdate=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, discovery of [[aerographite]] was announced, breaking the record for the least dense material at only 0.2&amp;nbsp;mg/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (0.2&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2012-07-carbon-nanotube-struructure-aerographite-lightest.html |title=New carbon nanotube struructure aerographite is lightest material champ |doi=10.1002/adma.201200491 |publisher=[[Phys.org]] |date= |accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/technik/aerographit-leichtestes-material-der-welt-entwickelt-a-843819.html |title=Aerographit: Leichtestes Material der Welt entwickelt - SPIEGEL ONLINE |publisher=[[Spiegel.de]] |language=de |date=2012-07-11 |accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; These solids do not float in air because the hollow spaces in them become filled with air. No lighter-than-air matrix or shell containing a hard vacuum has ever been constructed.

[[File:TwenteOnevleugel.png|right|thumb|chassis of Twente One]]
[[File:AandrijvingTwenteOne.png|right|thumb|Driving wheel of Twente One]]

The '''Twente One''' is the second [[Solar car racing|solar car]] developed by the [[Twente University|University of Twente]] and [[Saxion|Saxion University]] (at [[Enschede]], [[Deventer]] and [[Apeldoorn]])  in 2007, and succeeds the [[SolUTra]]. It was designed to participate in the 2007 [[World Solar Challenge]].

Its main innovations were a pivoting solar screen that follows the angle of the sun, and a system of [[fresnel lens]]es that focus the sunlight onto a solar panel with a system to adjust the panel so that the maximum amount of light from the lenses shines on the individual [[solar cell]]s.

The Twente One came in on the fifth place in the 2007 World solar Challenge.

A '''packhorse''' or '''pack horse'''  refers to a [[horse]], [[mule]], [[donkey]], or [[pony]] used to carry goods on its back, usually in sidebags or [[pannier]]s. Typically packhorses are used to cross difficult terrain, where the absence of roads prevents the use of wheeled vehicles.  Use of packhorses dates from the [[neolithic period]] to the present day.  Today, westernized nations primarily use packhorses for recreational pursuits, but they are still an important part of everyday transportation of goods throughout much of the [[third world]] and have some military uses in rugged regions.

==History==
[[File:Guide Alice on Mt Buffalo with pack horse, c1912.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Mountain guide]] [[Alice Manfield]] using packhorses to carry wooden chairs up [[Mount Buffalo National Park|Mt Buffalo]], c. 1912]]
Packhorses have been used since the earliest period of [[domestication of the horse]]. They were invaluable throughout antiquity, through the [[Horses in the Middle Ages|Middle Ages]], and into modern times where roads are nonexistent or poorly maintained.

===Historic use in England===
Packhorses were heavily used to transport goods and minerals in England from [[medieval]] times until the construction of the first [[toll road|turnpike roads]] and [[canal]]s in the 18th century. Many routes crossed the [[Pennines]] between Lancashire and Yorkshire, enabling salt,&lt;ref&gt;J.J.Bagley''A History of Lancashire''(Phillimore &amp; Co, London &amp; Chichester) 1976, chapter 20 Andrew Bibby ''South Pennines and the Bronte Moors'' (Frances, Lincoln) 2005, p88. See also Gladys Sellers ''Walking in the South Pennines'' (Cicerone Press, Milnthorpe) 1991, p25&lt;/ref&gt; limestone,&lt;ref&gt;Herbert C Collins,''The Roof of Lancashire'' (Dent &amp; Sons, London) 1950, p99&lt;/ref&gt; coal, fleeces and cloth to be transported.

Some had self-describing names, such as Limersgate and the Long Causeway; others were named after landmarks, such as the Reddyshore Scoutgate ("gate" is [[Old English]] for a road or way) and the Rapes Highway (after Rapes Hill). The medieval paths were marked by wayside crosses along their routes. Mount Cross, above the hamlet of Shore in the Cliviger Gorge, shows signs of Viking influence. As the Vikings moved eastwards from the Irish Sea in about 950 AD, it is likely that the pack horse routes were established from that time.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert C. Collins, above, chapters 6 and 9. Keith Parry ''Trans-Pennine Heritage: Hills, People and Transport'' (David &amp; Charles, Newton Abbot, London &amp; North Pomfret, Vermont) 1981, chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Most packhorses were [[Galloway pony|Galloways]], small, stocky horses named after the Scottish district where they were first bred. Those employed in the lime-carriage trade were known as "limegals".&lt;ref&gt;Herbert C Collins, above, p99&lt;/ref&gt; Each pony could carry about {{convert|240|lb|kg}} in weight, spread between two panniers. Typically a train of ponies would number between 12 and 20, but sometimes up to 40. They averaged about {{convert|25|mi|km}} a day. The train's leader commonly wore a bell to warn of its approach, since contemporary accounts emphasised the risk packhorse trains presented to others.&lt;ref&gt;Gladys Sellers, above, p26. Andrew Bibby, above, p88&lt;/ref&gt; They were particularly useful as roads were muddy and often impassable by wagon or cart, and there were no bridges over some major rivers in the north of England.

About 1000 packhorses a day passed through Clitheroe before 1750,&lt;ref&gt;Sue Hogg ''Marsden &amp; Delph to Howarth &amp; Oxenhope-Bridleway Rides in the South Pennines'' (Pennine Packhorse Trails Trust, Todmorden) 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and "commonly 200 to 300 laden horses every day over the River Calder (at a ford) called Fennysford in the King's Highway between Clitheroe and Whalley"&lt;ref&gt;Report of Quarter Sessions, 1632, cited by Herbert Collins, above, p163&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of packhorse routes was reflected in jingles and rhymes, often ''[[mnemonic|aide-memoires]]'' of the routes.&lt;ref&gt;Both Collins, at p.81, and Parry at p.31, above, quote in full the Long Causeway jingle, which starts ''Brunley (Burnley) for ready money''&lt;/ref&gt;

As the need for cross-Pennine transportation increased, the main routes were improved, often by laying stone setts parallel to the horse track, at a distance of a cartwheel. They remained difficult in poor weather, the Reddyshore Scoutgate was "notoriously difficult", and became insufficient for a developing commercial and industrial economy. In the 18th century, canals started to be built in England and, following the Turnpike Act 1773, metalled roads. They made the ancient packhorse routes obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;See Parry, above, chapters 5-8&lt;/ref&gt; Away from main routes, their use persisted into the 19th century leaving a legacy of paths across wilderness areas called ''packhorse routes, roads or trails''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spptt.org.uk|title=South Pennine Packhorse Trails Trust|author=|date=|website=www.spptt.org.uk|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and distinctive narrow, low sided stone arched [[packhorse bridge]]s for example, at [[Marsden, West Yorkshire|Marsden]] near Huddersfield. ''The Packhorse'' is a common [[public house]] name throughout England.&lt;ref name="ctphw"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cottontown.org/page.cfm?pageid=451&amp;language=eng | title = Packhorse Routes | publisher = cottontown.org | accessdate = January 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century, horses that transported officers' baggage during military campaigns were referred to as "bathorses"  from the French ''bat'', meaning packsaddle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Julia|last=Cresswell|title=Oxford Dictionary of Word Origins|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J4i3zV4vnBAC|year=2010|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=0-19-954793-9|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historic use in North America===
The packhorse, mule or donkey was a critical tool in the development of the [[Americas]]. In colonial America, Spanish, French, Dutch and English traders made use of pack horses to carry goods to remote Native Americans and to carry hides back to colonial market centers. They had little choice, the America's had virtually no improved waterways before the 1820s and roads in times before the automobile were only improved locally around a municipality, and only rarely in between. This meant cities and towns were connected by roads which carts and wagons could navigate only with difficulty, for virtually every eastern hill or mountain with a shallow [[gradient]] was flanked by valleys with stream cut [[Gully|gullies]] and ravines in their bottoms, as well as [[Cut bank]] formations, including escarpments. Even a small stream would have steep banks in normal terrains.

By the 1790s the [[Lehigh Coal Mining Company]] was shipping [[Anthracite]] coal from [[Summit Hill, Pennsylvania]] to cargo boats on the [[Lehigh River]] using pack trains in what may be the earliest commercial mining company in North America. Afterwards in 1818â1827 its new management built first the [[Lehigh Canal]], then the [[Mauch Chunk &amp; Summit Hill Railroad]], North America's second oldest which used mule trains to return the five ton coal cars the four hour climb the nine miles back to the upper terminus. Mules rode the roller-coaster precursor on the down trip to the docks, stables and paddocks below. The same company, as did its many competitors made extensive use of sure footed pack mules and donkeys in coal mines, including in some cases measures to stable the animals below ground. These were often managed by 'mule boys', a pay-grade up and a step above a [[breaker boy]] in the society of the times.

As the nation expanded west, packhorses, singly or in a pack train of several animals, were used by early [[surveying|surveyor]]s and explorers, most notably by [[fur trapper]]s, "[[Mountain men]]", and gold [[Prospecting|prospectors]] who covered great distances by themselves or in small groups.  Packhorses were used by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] people when traveling from place to place, and were also used by traders to carry goods to both Indian and White settlements.  During a few decades of the 19th Century, enormous pack trains carried goods on the [[Old Spanish Trail (trade route)|Old Spanish Trail]] from [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] west to [[California]].

On current [[United States Geological Survey]] maps, many such trails continue to be labeled ''pack trail''.

===Other historic uses===
[[File:Japanese packhorse (ni-uma or konidauma).jpg|thumb|Japanese pack horse (ni-uma or konida uma) carrying two girls as passengers, circa 1900-1929.]]
Packhorses are used worldwide to convey many products. In feudal [[Japan]] riding in a saddle [[Kura (saddle)|(kura)]] was reserved for the samurai class until the end of the [[samurai]] era (1868), lower classes would ride on a pack saddle (''ni-gura or konida-gura'') or bareback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E80uAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA146&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=samurai+pack+saddle&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qieSvM1Fv3&amp;sig=vaLAq3JKDC3YPBLbOkw0GtZ-Ej8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TVQqT7D-F8-02AXR_oSUDw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=samurai%20pack%20saddle&amp;f=true|title=Honda the Samurai|work=google.com|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pack horses (''ni-uma or konida-uma'') carried a variety of merchandise and the baggage of travelers using a pack saddle that ranged from a basic wooden frame to the elaborate pack saddles used for the semi-annual processions ([[sankin kotai]]) of DaimyÅ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ycY_85OInSoC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=sankin+kotai+pack+horse&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HFoqT7eEAsrMtgf886D3Dw&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=sankin%20kotai%20pack%20horse&amp;f=true|title=A History of Japan, 1582-1941|work=google.com|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pack horses also carried the equipment and food for samurai warriors during military campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hpOpn8fbKgEC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=samurai+pack+horse&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WWAqT5v4HI2WtwfPrZ3yAg&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=samurai%20pack%20horse&amp;f=true|title=Warriors of Medieval Japan|work=google.com|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--feel free to expand section--&gt;

==Modern uses==
[[File:Trail Bridge near China Gulch-Oregon.jpg|thumb|left|Pack horses on a [[suspension bridge]] crossing the [[Rogue River (Oregon)|Rogue River]] in [[Oregon]], USA]]
In North America and Australia, in areas such the [[Bicentennial National Trail]], the packhorse plays a major role in recreational pursuits, particularly to transport goods and supplies into [[wilderness area]]s and where motor vehicles are either prohibited or impracticable. They are used by mounted [[outfitter]]s, [[hunter]]s, [[camping|campers]], [[Stockman (Australia)|stockmen]] and [[cowboy]]s to carry tools and equipment that cannot be carried with the rider. They are used by [[guest ranch]]es to transport materials to remote locations to set up campsites for tourists and guests. They are used by the [[United States Forest Service]] and the [[National Park Service]] to carry in supplies to maintain trails, cabins and bring in commercial goods to backcountry tourist lodges and other remote, permanent residences.

[[File:Georges Creek.N.jpg|thumb|[[Bicentennial National Trail|Australian National Horse Trail]]]]
In the third world, packhorses and donkeys to an even greater extent, still haul goods to market, carry supplies for workers, and many other of the same jobs that have been performed for millennia.

In modern [[horses in warfare|warfare]], pack mules are used to bring supplies to areas where roads are poor and fuel supply is uncertain. For example, they are a critical part of the supply chain for all sides of the conflict in remote parts of Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110404080120/http://www.defence.gov.au/news/armynews/editions/1176/topstories/story9.htm|title=Half a century of the SAS|work=defence.gov.au|accessdate=4 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Clear}}

==Training and utilization==
&lt;!--this section needs expansion, but not clear up to a "how to"--&gt;
Foundation training of the packhorse is similar to that of a riding horse.&lt;ref name="KinseyDenison"&gt;Kinsey, J. M. and Denison, Jennifer. Backcountry Basics Colorado Springs, CO: Western Horseman Publishing, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-911647-84-6}}. Chapter 3: "Making the Trail Horse"&lt;/ref&gt; Many, though not all packhorses are also trained to be ridden.  In addition, a packhorse is required to have additional skills that may not be required of a riding horse.  A pack horse is required to be tolerant of close proximity to other animals in the packstring, both to the front and to the rear.  The horse must also be tolerant of [[Breeching (tack)|breeching]], long ropes, noisy loads, and the shifting of the load during transit.  Patience and tolerance is crucial; for example, while there are many ways that pack horses are put into a pack string, one method incorporates tying the [[halter]] lead of one animal to the tail of the animal in front of it, an act that often provokes kicking or [[bolting (horse)|bolting]] in untrained animals.

Loading of a packhorse requires care.  Weight carried is the first factor to consider.  The average horse can carry up to approximately 30% of its body weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aerc.org/AERC_Rider_Handbook110303.asp|title=Chapter 3, Section IV: Size|author=American Endurance Ride Conference|accessdate=2008-08-07|date=November 2003|work=Endurance Rider's Handbook|publisher=AERC|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515133147/http://www.aerc.org/AERC_Rider_Handbook110303.asp|archivedate=2008-05-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, a {{convert|1000|lb|kg}} horse cannot carry more than {{convert|250|to|300|lb|kg}}.  A load carried by a packhorse also has to be balanced, with weight even on both sides to the greatest degree possible.

'''Refractory metals''' are a class of [[metal]]s that are extraordinarily resistant to [[heat]] and [[wear]]. The expression is mostly used in the context of [[materials science]], [[metallurgy]] and [[engineering]]. The definition of which elements belong to this group differs. The most common definition includes five elements: two of the [[Period 5 element|fifth period]] ([[niobium]] and [[molybdenum]]) and three of the [[Period 6 element|sixth period]] ([[tantalum]], [[tungsten]], and [[rhenium]]). They all share some properties, including a melting point above 2000&amp;nbsp;Â°C and high [[hardness]] at room temperature. They are chemically inert and have a relatively high density. Their high melting points make [[powder metallurgy]] the method of choice for [[fabrication (metal)|fabricating]] components from these metals. Some of their applications include tools to work metals at high temperatures, wire filaments, casting molds, and chemical reaction vessels in corrosive environments. Partly due to the high melting point, refractory metals are stable against [[creep (deformation)|creep deformation]] to very high temperatures.

==Definition==
Most definitions of the term 'refractory metals' list the extraordinarily high melting point as a key requirement for inclusion. By one definition, a melting point above {{convert|4000|Â°F|Â°C}} is necessary to qualify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9ohkDUryVZ0C&amp;pg=PA120 | first = Michael | last = Bauccio |author2=American Society for Metals  | publisher = ASM International| isbn = 978-0-87170-478-8 | pages =120â122 | chapter = Refractory metals | title = ASM metals reference book | year = 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The five elements niobium, molybdenum, tantalum, tungsten and rhenium are included in all definitions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IzqsAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg | pages = 1â28| isbn = 978-0-8047-0162-4 | chapter = General Behaviour of Refractory Metals |title =Behavior and Properties of Refractory Metals| publisher = | author1 = Metals, Behavior Of | author2 = Wilson, J. W | date = 1965-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the wider definition, including all elements with a melting point above {{convert|2123|K|Â°C}}, includes a varying number of nine additional elements: [[titanium]], [[vanadium]], [[chromium]], [[zirconium]], [[hafnium]], [[ruthenium]], [[rhodium]], [[osmium]] and [[iridium]]. The [[artificial element]]s, being radioactive, are never considered to be part of the refractory metals, although [[technetium]] has a melting point of 2430 K or 2157 Â°C and [[rutherfordium]] is predicted to have melting point of 2400 K or 2100 Â°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=Sg9fAVdf8WoC&amp;pg=PA308 | pages = 308â333 | isbn =978-0-87170-744-4| title =Alloying: understanding the basics| publisher = | author1 =Davis, Joseph R | year =2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Ti, V, Cr, Nb, Ta, W, Mo, Re, Zr, Hf Habashi

The melting point of the refractory metals are the highest for all elements except [[carbon]], osmium and iridium. This high melting point defines most of their applications. All the metals are [[body-centered cubic]] except rhenium which is [[Close-packing of spheres|hexagonal close-packed]]. Most physical properties of the elements in this group vary significantly because they are members of different [[Group (periodic table)|groups]].&lt;ref name="Lipi"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00775076 | title = Investigation of the temperature dependence of the hardness of molybdenum in the range of 20â2500Â°C | year = 1963 | last1 = Borisenko | first1 = V.

Creep resistance is a key property of the refractory metals. In metals, the starting of creep correlates with the melting point of the material; the creep in aluminium alloys starts at 200&amp;nbsp;Â°C, while for refractory metals temperatures above 1500&amp;nbsp;Â°C are necessary. This resistance against deformation at high temperatures makes the refractory metals suitable against strong forces at high temperature, for example in [[jet engines]], or tools used during [[forging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=LRK59pGvDDwC&amp;pg=PA86 | pages = 86â93 | isbn =978-7-302-12535-8| title =Manufacturing engineering and technology| publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | first1 =Kalpakjian| last1 = Schmid | chapter = Creep | year =2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=w29kfcFkwOMC&amp;pg=PA81 | pages = 81â93 | isbn =978-0-8247-7726-5| title =Thermal fatigue of metals| publisher = CRC Press | year = 1991 | first1 = Andrzej | last1 =WeroÅski| first2 = Tadeusz | last2 =Hejwowski | chapter = Creep-Resisting Materials}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical===
The refractory metals show a wide variety of chemical properties because they are members of three distinct groups in the [[periodic table]]. They are easily oxidized, but this reaction is slowed down in the bulk metal by the formation of stable oxide layers on the surface. Especially the oxide of rhenium is more volatile than the metal, and therefore at high temperature the stabilization against the attack of oxygen is lost, because the oxide layer evaporates. They all are relatively stable against acids.&lt;ref name="Lipi"/&gt;

==Applications==

Refractory metals are used in [[lighting]], tools, [[lubricant]]s, [[nuclear reaction]] [[control rod]]s, as [[catalyst]]s, and for their [[chemical]] or electrical properties.  Because of their high [[melting point]], refractory metal components are never fabricated by [[Casting (metalworking)|casting]].  The process of powder metallurgy is used.  Powders of the pure metal are compacted, heated using electric current, and further fabricated by cold working with annealing steps.  Refractory metals can be worked into [[wire]], [[ingot]]s, [[rebar]]s, [[Sheet metal|sheets]] or [[foil (metal)|foil]].

===Molybdenum alloys===
{{main|Molybdenum|Molybdenum#Applications}}
Molybdenum based alloys are widely used, because they are cheaper than superior tungsten alloys. The most widely used alloy of molybdenum is the [[titanium|'''T'''itanium]]-[[zirconium|'''Z'''irconium]]-'''M'''olybdenum alloy TZM, composed of 0.5% titanium and 0.08% of zirconium (with molybdenum being the rest). The alloy exhibits a higher creep resistance and strength at high temperatures, making service temperatures of above 1060&amp;nbsp;Â°C possible for the material. The high resistivity of Mo-30W, an alloy of 70% molybdenum and 30% tungsten, against the attack of molten zinc makes it the ideal material for casting zinc. It is also used to construct valves for molten zinc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Smallwood | first=Robert E. | title=ASTM special technical publication 849: Refractory metals and their industrial applications: a symposium |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=agaacIr25KcC&amp;pg=PA9 | year=1984 | publisher=ASTM International | isbn=978-0-8031-0203-3 |page=9 |chapter=TZM Moly Alloy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molybdenum is used in [[Relay#Mercury-wetted relay|mercury wetted reed relays]], because molybdenum does not form [[Amalgam (chemistry)|amalgams]] and is therefore resistant to corrosion by liquid [[Mercury (element)|mercury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Corrosion Resistance of Molybdenum in Mercury| doi = 10.1023/A:1024903616630 | year = 2003 | last1 = Kozbagarova | first1 = G.

Molybdenum is the most commonly used of the refractory metals.  Its most important use is as a strengthening [[alloy]] of [[steel]].  [[Hollow structural section|Structural tubing]] and [[piping]] often contains molybdenum, as do many [[stainless steel]]s.  Its strength at high temperatures, resistance to wear and low [[coefficient of friction]] are all properties which make it invaluable as an alloying compound.  Its excellent anti-[[friction]] properties lead to its incorporation in [[Grease (lubricant)|greases]] and [[oil]]s where reliability and performance are critical.  Automotive [[constant-velocity joint]]s use grease containing molybdenum.  The compound sticks readily to metal and forms a very hard, friction resistant coating.  Most of the world's molybdenum [[ore]] can be found in China, the [[United States|USA]], Chile and [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="USGSCS2008"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/molybdenum/mcs-2009-molyb.pdf |title = Commodity Summary 2009:Molybdenum |first = Michael J. |last=Magyar |publisher = [[United States Geological Survey]] |accessdate = 2010-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi =10.1016/0025-5416(88)90529-0 | title =Structure and properties of high energy, high rate consolidated molybdenum alloy TZM | year =1988 | last1 =Ervin | first1 =D.

===Tungsten and its alloys===
{{main|Tungsten|Tungsten#Applications}}
Tungsten was discovered in 1781 by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] chemist, [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]].  Tungsten has the highest melting point of all metals, at {{convert|3410|Â°C|Â°F|0|lk=on}}.
[[File:filament.jpg|thumb|[[Electric filament|Filament]] of a 200 watt incandescent lightbulb highly magnified]]
Up to 22% rhenium is alloyed with tungsten to improve its high temperature strength and corrosion resistance. Thorium as an alloying compound is used when electric arcs have to be established. The ignition is easier and the arc burns more stably than without the addition of thorium. For powder metallurgy applications, binders have to be used for the sintering process. For the production of the tungsten heavy alloy, binder mixtures of  [[nickel]] and [[iron]] or nickel and [[copper]] are widely used. The tungsten content of the alloy is normally above 90%. The diffusion of the binder elements into the tungsten grains is low even at the [[sintering]] temperatures and therefore the interior of the grains is pure tungsten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 978-0-306-45053-2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=foLRISkt9gcC&amp;pg=PA1 | title = Tungsten: properties, chemistry, technology of the element, alloys, and chemical compounds | first1 = Erik | last1 = Lassner | publisher = Springer | year = 1999 | first2 = Wolf-Dieter | last2 =Schubert | pages =255â282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tungsten and its alloys are often used in applications where high temperatures are present but still a high strength is necessary and the high density is not troublesome.&lt;ref name="W-Trend"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1T8rAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1| title = Trends in Usage of Tungsten: Report |publisher = National Research Council, National Academy of Sciences-National Academy of Engineering |author = National Research Council (U.S.), Panel on Tungsten, Committee on Technical Aspects of Critical and Strategic Material |year = 1973 |pages = 1â3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tungsten wire filaments provide the vast majority of household [[incandescent lighting]], but are also common in industrial lighting as electrodes in arc lamps. Lamps get more efficient in the conversion of electric energy to light with higher temperatures and therefore a high melting point is essential for the application as filament in incandescent light.&lt;ref name="tungst"&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 978-0-306-45053-2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=foLRISkt9gcC&amp;pg | title = Tungsten: properties, chemistry, technology of the element, alloys, and chemical compounds | first1 = Erik | last1 = Lassner | publisher = Springer | year = 1999 | first2 = Wolf-Dieter | last2 =Schubert}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Gas tungsten arc welding]] (GTAW, also known as tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding) equipment uses a permanent, non-melting [[electrode]]. The high melting point and the wear resistance against the electric arc makes tungsten a suitable material for the  electrode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gScGxzDhTeQC&amp;pg=PA28 | title = Welding health and safety: a field guide for OEHS professionals | first =Michael K. | last = Harris | isbn = 978-1-931504-28-7 | publisher = AIHA | year =2002 | chapter = Welding Health and Safety | page = 28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | publisher = Industrial Press Inc.| year = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-8311-3151-7 | title = Welding essentials: questions &amp; answers | first1 =William L. | last1 =Galvery | first2 =Frank M. | last2 =Marlow | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jNxCxwp2fHoC&amp;pg=PA185 | page = 185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tungsten's high density and strength is also a key property for its use in weapon [[projectile]]s, for example as an alternative to depleted Uranium for tank guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | url = http://aux.ciar.org/ttk/mbt/papers/symp_19/TB191191.pdf | conference= 19th International Symposium of Ballistics | date = 7â11 May 2001 | place = Interlaken, Switzerland | title = KINETIC ENERGY PROJECTILES: DEVELOPMENT HISTORY, STATE OF THE ART, TRENDS | first1 = W. | last1 = Lanz| first2 =  W. | last2= Odermatt| first3 = G. | last3= Weihrauch3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its high melting point makes tungsten a good material for applications like [[Rocket engine nozzle|rocket nozzles]], for example in the [[UGM-27 Polaris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | page = 38 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9n-rX13bNsAC&amp;pg=PA38| chapter = Powder metallurgyfor Aerospace Applications | isbn = 81-224-2030-3 | title = Powder metallurgy : processing for automotive, electrical/electronic and engineering industry| first = P. | last = Ramakrishnan | publisher = New Age International | date = 2007-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the applications of tungsten are not related to its refractory properties but simply to its density. For example, it is used in balance weights for planes and helicopters or for heads of [[Golf club (equipment)|golf clubs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Tungsten Heavy Alloy For Defence Applications | author = Arora, Arran | journal = Materials Technology | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 210â216 | year = 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s11837-001-0147-z| title =Fabricating sports equipment components via powder metallurgy | year = 2001 | last1 = Moxson | first1 = V.

H. | journal = JOM | volume = 53 | pages = 39 |bibcode = 2001JOM....53d..39M | issue = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this applications similar dense materials like the more expensive osmium can also be used.

The most common use for tungsten is as the compound [[tungsten carbide]] in [[drill bit]]s, machining and cutting tools. The largest reserves of tungsten are in [[China]], with deposits in [[Korea]], [[Bolivia]], [[Australia]], and other countries.

It also finds itself serving as a [[lubrication|lubricant]], [[antioxidant]], in nozzles and bushings, as a protective coating and in many other ways.  Tungsten can be found in printing inks, [[x-ray]] screens, [[photographic chemicals]],{{Dubious|date=April 2008}} in the processing of [[petroleum]] products, and flame proofing of [[textile]]s.

===Niobium alloys===
{{main|Niobium#Applications|Niobium_alloy}}
[[File:Apollo CSM lunar orbit.jpg|thumb|Apollo CSM with the dark rocket nozzle made from niobium-titanium alloy |alt=Image of the Apollo Service Module with the moon in the background]]
Niobium is nearly always found together with tantalum, and was named after [[Niobe]], the daughter of the [[Greek mythology|mythical]] [[Greece|Greek]] king [[Tantalus]] for whom tantalum was named.  Niobium has many uses, some of which it shares with other refractory metals.  It is unique in that it can be worked through annealing to achieve a wide range of strength and [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]], and is the least dense of the refractory metals. It can also be found in [[electrolytic capacitor]]s and in the most practical [[Superconductivity|superconducting]] alloys.  Niobium can be found in [[aircraft]] [[gas turbine]]s, [[vacuum tube]]s and [[nuclear reactor]]s.

An alloy used for [[liquid rocket]] thruster nozzles, such as in the main engine of the [[Apollo Lunar Module]]s, is C103, which consists of 89% niobium, 10% hafnium and 1% titanium.&lt;ref name="hightemp"&gt;{{cite journal |url = http://www.cbmm.com.br/portug/sources/techlib/science_techno/table_content/sub_3/images/pdfs/016.pdf |title = Niobium alloys and high Temperature Applications |first = John |last = Hebda |journal = Niobium Science &amp; Technology: Proceedings of the International Symposium Niobium 2001 (Orlando, Florida, USA) |publisher = Companhia Brasileira de Metalurgia e MineraÃ§Ã£o |accessdate =  |date = 2001-05-02 |format = pdf |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081217080513/http://www.cbmm.com.br/portug/sources/techlib/science_techno/table_content/sub_3/images/pdfs/016.pdf |archivedate = 2008-12-17 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another [[niobium alloy]] was used for the nozzle of the [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Service Module (SM)|Apollo Service Module]]. As niobium is oxidized at temperatures above 400&amp;nbsp;Â°C, a protective coating is necessary for these applications to prevent the alloy from becoming brittle.&lt;ref name ="hightemp"/&gt;

===Tantalum and its alloys===
{{main|Tantalum|Tantalum#Applications}}
Tantalum is one of the most [[corrosion]] resistant substances available.

Many important uses have been found for tantalum owing to this property, particularly in the [[medicine|medical]] and [[surgery|surgical]] fields, and also in harsh [[acid]]ic environments.  It is also used to make superior electrolytic capacitors.  Tantalum films provide the second most [[capacitance]] per volume of any substance after [[Aerogel]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} and allow [[miniaturization]] of [[electronic component]]s and [[electrical network|circuitry]]. Many [[mobile phone|cellular phone]]s and [[computer]]s contain tantalum capacitors.

===Rhenium alloys===
{{main|Rhenium}}
Rhenium is the most recently discovered refractory metal.  It is found in low concentrations with many other metals, in the ores of other refractory metals, [[platinum]] or [[copper]] ores.  It is useful as an alloy to other refractory metals, where it adds [[ductility]] and [[tensile strength]]. Rhenium alloys are being used in electronic components, [[gyroscope]]s and [[nuclear reactor]]s.  Rhenium finds its most important use as a catalyst.  It is used as a catalyst in reactions such as [[alkylation]], [[dealkylation]], [[hydrogenation]] and [[oxidation]].  However its rarity makes it the most expensive of the refractory metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IzqsAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR208 | title = Behavior and Properties of Refractory Metals | first = J. W. | last = Wilson | publisher = Stanford University Press | year = 1965 | isbn = 978-0-8047-0162-4 | chapter = Rhenium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages and shortfalls==
Refractory metals and alloys attract the attention of investigators because of their remarkable properties and promising practical usefulness.

Physical properties of refractory metals, such as molybdenum, tantalum and tungsten, their strength, and high-temperature stability make them suitable material for hot [[metalworking]] applications and for [[vacuum furnace]] technology. Many special applications exploit these properties: for example, tungsten lamp filaments operate at temperatures up to 3073 K, and molybdenum furnace windings withstand to 2273 K.

However, poor low-temperature fabricability and extreme [[Redox|oxidability]] at high temperatures are shortcomings of most refractory metals. Interactions with the environment can significantly influence their high-temperature creep strength. Application of these metals requires a protective atmosphere or coating.

The refractory metal alloys of molybdenum, niobium, tantalum, and tungsten have been applied to space nuclear power systems. These systems were designed to operate at temperatures from 1350 K to approximately 1900 K. An environment must not interact with the material in question. Liquid [[alkali metal]]s as the heat transfer fluids are used as well as the [[ultra-high vacuum]].

The high-temperature [[Creep (deformation)|creep]] [[Deformation (mechanics)|strain]] of alloys must be limited for them to be used. The creep strain should not exceed 1â2%. An additional complication in studying creep behavior of the refractory metals is interactions with environment, which can significantly influence the creep behavior.

'''Rolling resistance''', sometimes called '''rolling friction''' or '''rolling drag''', is the force resisting the [[Motion (physics)|motion]] when a body (such as a [[ball]], [[tire]], or [[wheel]]) rolls on a surface. It is mainly caused by [[Plasticity (physics)|non-elastic]] effects; that is, not all the energy needed for deformation (or movement) of the wheel, roadbed, etc. is recovered when the pressure is removed. Two forms of this are [[hysteresis]] losses (see [[rolling resistance#Primary cause|below]]), and permanent [[plastic deformation|(plastic) deformation]] of the object or the surface (e.g. soil). Another cause of rolling resistance lies in the [[frictional contact mechanics|slippage]] between the wheel and the surface, which dissipates energy. Note that only the last of these effects involves [[friction]], therefore the name "rolling friction" is to an extent a misnomer.

In analogy with [[sliding friction]], rolling resistance is often expressed as a coefficient times the normal force. This coefficient of rolling resistance is generally much smaller than the coefficient of sliding friction.&lt;ref name="Peck"&gt;{{cite book

Any coasting wheeled [[vehicle]] will gradually slow down due to rolling resistance including that of the bearings, but a [[train]] car with steel wheels running on steel [[Rail tracks|rails]] will roll farther than a [[bus]] of the same mass with rubber tires running on tarmac. Factors that contribute to rolling resistance are the (amount of) deformation of the wheels, the deformation of the roadbed surface, and movement below the surface. Additional contributing factors include [[#Dependence on diameter|wheel diameter]], [[#Dependence on speed|speed]],&lt;ref name = "Hibbeler"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[#Dependence on wheel load|load on wheel]], surface adhesion, sliding, and relative micro-sliding between the surfaces of contact. The losses due to [[hysteresis]] also depend strongly on the material properties of the wheel or tire and the surface. For example, a [[tire|rubber tire]] will have higher rolling resistance on a paved road than a [[steel]] [[Wheelset (rail transport)|railroad wheel]] on a steel rail. Also, [[sand]] on the ground will give more rolling resistance than [[concrete]].

The primary cause of pneumatic tire rolling resistance is [[hysteresis]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/4274 A handbook for the rolling resistance of pneumatic tires Clark, Samuel Kelly; Dodge, Richard N. 1979]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A characteristic of a deformable material such that the energy of deformation is greater than the energy of recovery. The rubber compound in a tire exhibits hysteresis. As the tire rotates under the weight of the vehicle, it experiences repeated cycles of deformation and recovery, and it dissipates the hysteresis energy loss as heat. Hysteresis is the main cause of energy loss associated with rolling resistance and is attributed to the [[viscoelasticity|viscoelastic characteristics]] of the rubber.

This main principle is illustrated in the figure of the rolling cylinders. If two equal cylinders are pressed together then the contact surface is flat. In the absence of surface friction, contact stresses are normal (i.e. perpendicular) to the contact surface. Consider a particle that enters the contact area at the right side, travels through the contact patch and leaves at the left side. Initially its vertical deformation is increasing, which is resisted by the hysteresis effect. Therefore, an additional pressure is generated to avoid interpenetration of the two surfaces. Later its vertical deformation is decreasing. This is again resisted by the hysteresis effect. In this case this decreases the pressure that is needed to keep the two bodies separate.

The resulting pressure distribution is asymmetrical and is shifted to the right. The [[line of action]] of the (aggregate) [[Force#Normal force|vertical force]] no longer passes through the centers of the cylinders. This means that a [[moment (physics)|moment]] occurs that tends to retard the rolling motion.

Materials that have a large hysteresis effect, such as rubber, which bounce back slowly, exhibit more rolling resistance than materials with a small hysteresis effect that bounce back more quickly and more completely, such as steel or silica. [[Low rolling resistance tires]] typically incorporate silica in place of carbon black in their tread compounds to reduce low-frequency hysteresis without compromising traction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tyrepriceadvisor.co.uk/en/top-tyre-brands/falken-tyres Tyres-Online: The Benefits of Silica in Tyre Design&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204065301/http://www.tyrepriceadvisor.co.uk/en/top-tyre-brands/falken-tyres |date=2013-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that railroads also have hysteresis in the roadbed structure.&lt;ref&gt;ÐÑÑÐ°ÑÐ¾Ð², p.85&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
In the broad sense, specific "rolling resistance" (for vehicles) is the force per unit vehicle weight required to move the vehicle on level ground at a constant slow speed where aerodynamic drag (air resistance) is insignificant and also where there are no traction (motor) forces or brakes applied. In other words, the vehicle would be coasting if it were not for the force to maintain constant speed.&lt;ref&gt;An example of such usage for railroads is [https://web.archive.org/web/20100626045718/http://www.istc.illinois.edu/about/SeminarPresentations/20091118.pdf here].&lt;/ref&gt; This broad sense includes wheel bearing resistance, the energy dissipated by vibration and oscillation of both the roadbed and the vehicle, and sliding of the wheel on the roadbed surface (pavement or a rail).

But there is an even broader sense that would include energy wasted by wheel slippage due to the [[#Depends on applied torque|torque applied from the engine]]. This includes the increased power required due to the increased velocity of the wheels where the tangential velocity of the driving wheel(s) becomes greater than the vehicle speed due to slippage. Since [[Power (physics)#Mechanical power|power is equal to force times velocity]] and the wheel velocity has increased, the power required has increased accordingly.

The pure "rolling resistance" for a train is that which happens due to deformation and possible minor sliding at the wheel-road contact.&lt;ref&gt;ÐÐµÐµÐ², p. 79. Hay, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; For a rubber tire, an analogous energy loss happens over the entire tire, but it is still called "rolling resistance". In the broad sense, "rolling resistance" includes wheel bearing resistance, energy loss by shaking both the roadbed (and the earth underneath) and the vehicle itself, and by sliding of the wheel, road/rail contact. Railroad textbooks seem to cover all these resistance forces but do not call their sum "rolling resistance" (broad sense) as is done in this article. They just sum up all the resistance forces (including aerodynamic drag) and call the sum basic train resistance (or the like).&lt;ref&gt;ÐÑÑÐ°ÑÐ¾Ð², Chapt. IV, p. 73+; ÐÐµÐµÐ², Sect. 5.2 p. 78+; Hay, Chapt. 6 "Train Resistance" p. 67+&lt;/ref&gt;

Since railroad rolling resistance in the broad sense may be a few times larger than just the pure rolling resistance&lt;ref&gt;ÐÑÑÐ°ÑÐ¾Ð², Fig. 4.14, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; reported values may be in serious conflict since they may be based on different definitions of "rolling resistance". The train's engines must, of course, provide the energy to overcome this broad-sense rolling resistance.

For tires, rolling resistance is defined as the energy consumed by a tire per unit distance covered. It is also called rolling friction or rolling drag. It is one of the forces that act to oppose the motion of a driver. The main reason for this is that when the tires are in motion and touch the surface, the surface changes shape and causes deformation of the tire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://indiatransportportal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/india-rolling-resistance-itp-feb-2016.pdf|title=Rolling Resistance and Fuel Saving|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408115014/http://indiatransportportal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/india-rolling-resistance-itp-feb-2016.pdf|archivedate=2016-04-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For highway motor vehicles, there is obviously some energy dissipated in shaking the roadway (and the earth beneath it), the shaking of the vehicle itself, and the sliding of the tires. But, other than the [[#Depends on applied torque|additional power required due to torque]] and wheel bearing friction, non-pure rolling resistance doesn't seem to have been investigated, possibly because the "pure" rolling resistance of a rubber tire is several times higher than the neglected resistances.&lt;ref&gt;If one were to assume that the resistance coefficients (Crr) for motor vehicles were the same as for trains, then for trains the neglected resistances taken together have a Crr of about 0.0004 (see ÐÑÑÐ°ÑÐ¾Ð², Fig. 4.14, p.107 at 20km/hr and assume a total Crr =0.0010 based on Fig. 3.8, p.50 (plain bearings) and adjust for roller bearings based on a delta Crr of 0.00035 as read from Figs. 4.2 and 4.4 on pp. 74, 76). Compare this Crr of 0.0004 to motor vehicle tire Crr's of at least 10 times higher per "Rolling resistance coefficient examples" in this article&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rolling resistance coefficient==
The "rolling resistance coefficient" is defined by the following equation:&lt;ref name = "NAS286" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ F = C_{rr} N &lt;/math&gt;
:where
:: &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is the rolling resistance force (shown in figure 1),
:: &lt;math&gt;C_{rr}&lt;/math&gt; is the dimensionless '''rolling resistance coefficient''' or '''coefficient of rolling friction''' ('''CRF'''), and
:: &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the [[normal force]], the force perpendicular to the surface on which the wheel is rolling.

&lt;math&gt;C_{rr}&lt;/math&gt; is the force needed to push (or tow) a wheeled vehicle forward (at constant speed on a level surface, or zero grade, with zero air resistance) per unit force of weight. It is assumed that all wheels are the same and bear identical weight. Thus: &lt;math&gt;\ C_{rr} = 0.01 &lt;/math&gt; means that it would only take 0.01 pounds to tow a vehicle weighing one pound. For a 1000-pound vehicle, it would take 100 times more tow force, i.e. 10 pounds. One could say that &lt;math&gt;C_{rr}&lt;/math&gt; is in lb(tow-force)/lb(vehicle weight). Since this lb/lb is force divided by force, &lt;math&gt;C_{rr}&lt;/math&gt; is dimensionless. Multiply it by 100 and you get the percent (%) of the weight of the vehicle required to maintain slow steady speed. &lt;math&gt;C_{rr}&lt;/math&gt; is often multiplied by 1000 to get the parts per thousand, which is the same as kilograms (kg force) per metric ton (tonne = 1000&amp;nbsp;kg ),&lt;ref&gt;kgf/tonne is used by ÐÑÑÐ°ÑÐ¾Ð² throughout his book&lt;/ref&gt; which is the same as pounds of resistance per 1000 pounds
of load or Newtons/kilo-Newton, etc. For the US railroads, lb/ton has been traditionally used; this is just &lt;math&gt;2000 C_{rr}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, they are all just measures of resistance per unit vehicle weight. While they are all "specific resistances", sometimes they are just called "resistance" although they are really a coefficient (ratio)or a multiple thereof. If using pounds or kilograms as force units, mass is equal to weight (in earth's gravity a kilogram a mass weighs a kilogram and exerts a kilogram of force) so one could claim that &lt;math&gt;C_{rr}&lt;/math&gt; is also the force per unit mass in such units. The SI system would use N/tonne (N/T, N/t), which is &lt;math&gt;1000 g C_{rr}&lt;/math&gt; and is force per unit mass, where ''g'' is the acceleration of gravity in SI units (meters per second square).&lt;ref&gt;ÐÐµÐµÐ² uses N/T notation. See pp. 78-84.&lt;/ref&gt;

The above shows resistance proportional to &lt;math&gt; C_{rr}&lt;/math&gt; but does not explicitly show any variation with speed, [[#Dependence on wheel load|loads]], [[#Dependence on applied torque|torque]], surface roughness, [[#Dependence on diameter|diameter]], tire inflation/wear, etc. because &lt;math&gt;C_{rr}&lt;/math&gt; itself varies with those factors. It might seem from the above definition of &lt;math&gt; C_{rr}&lt;/math&gt; that the rolling resistance is directly proportional to vehicle weight but [[#Dependence on wheel load|it is not]].

== Measurement ==
There are at least two popular models for calculating rolling resistance.

#"Rolling resistance coefficient (RRC). The value of the rolling resistance force divided by the wheel load. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has developed test practices to measure the RRC of tires. These tests ([[SAE J1269]] and [[SAE J2452]]) are usually performed{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} on new tires. When measured by using these standard test practices, most new passenger tires have reported RRCs ranging from 0.007 to 0.014."&lt;ref name = "NAS286" /&gt; In the case of bicycle tires, values of 0.0025 to 0.005 are achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biketechreview.com/tires/AFM_tire_crr.htm|title=Roller Data|last=Willett|first=Kraig|website=www.biketechreview.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; These coefficients are measured on rollers, with power meters on road surfaces, or with [[coast-down test]]s. In the latter two cases, the effect of air resistance must be subtracted or the tests performed at very low speeds.
#The coefficient of rolling resistance ''b'', which has the dimension of [[length]], is approximately (due to the [[small-angle approximation]] of &lt;math&gt;\cos(\theta) = 1&lt;/math&gt;) equal to the value of the rolling resistance force times the [[radius]] of the wheel divided by the wheel load.&lt;ref name = "Hibbeler" /&gt;
# [[ISO 18164:2005]] is used to test rolling resistance in Europe.

The results of these tests can be hard for the general public to obtain as manufacturers prefer to publicize "comfort" and "performance".

==Physical formulas==
The coefficient of rolling resistance for a slow rigid wheel on a perfectly elastic surface, not adjusted for velocity, can be calculated by {{cn|date=September 2018}}
: &lt;math&gt;\ C_{rr} = \sqrt {z/d} &lt;/math&gt;
:where
:: &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is the sinkage depth
:: &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the diameter of the rigid wheel 

Empirical formula for &lt;math&gt;\ C_{rr} &lt;/math&gt; for cast iron mine car wheels on steel rails.&lt;ref&gt;Hersey, equation (2), p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\ C_{rr} = 0.0048 (18/D)^{\frac{1}{2}}(100/W)^{\frac{1}{4}} &lt;/math&gt;
:where
::&lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the wheel diameter in in.
::&lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is the load on the wheel in lbs.

As an alternative to using [[#Rolling resistance coefficient|&lt;math&gt;\ C_{rr}&lt;/math&gt;]] one can use &lt;math&gt;\ b&lt;/math&gt;, which is a different '''rolling resistance coefficient''' or '''coefficient of rolling friction''' with dimension of length. It is defined by the following formula:&lt;ref name = "Hibbeler" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ F = \frac{N b}{r} &lt;/math&gt;
:where
:: &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is the rolling resistance force (shown in figure 1),
:: &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the wheel radius,
:: &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is the '''rolling resistance coefficient''' or '''coefficient of rolling friction''' with dimension of length, and
:: &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the normal force (equal to ''W'', not ''R'', as shown in figure 1).

The above equation, where resistance is inversely proportional to radius r. seems to be based on the discredited "Coulomb's law" (Neither Coulomb's inverse square law nor Coulomb's law of friction) (needs citation). See [[#Dependence on diameter|dependence on diameter]]. Equating this equation with the force per the [[#Rolling resistance coefficient|rolling resistance coefficient]], and solving for b, gives b = C&lt;sub&gt;rr&lt;/sub&gt;Â·r. Therefore, if a source gives rolling resistance coefficient (C&lt;sub&gt;rr&lt;/sub&gt;) as a dimensionless coefficient, it can be converted to b, having units of length, by multiplying C&lt;sub&gt;rr&lt;/sub&gt; by wheel radius r.

==Dependence on diameter==

===Stagecoaches and railroads===
According to Dupuit (1837), rolling resistance (of wheeled carriages with wooden wheels with iron tires) is approximately inversely proportional to the square root of wheel diameter.&lt;ref&gt;Hersey, subsection: "End of dark ages", p.261&lt;/ref&gt; This rule has been experimentally verified for cast iron wheels (8" - 24" diameter) on steel rail&lt;ref&gt;Hersey, subsection: "Static rolling friction", p.266.&lt;/ref&gt; and for 19th century carriage wheels.&lt;ref name=treatise/&gt; But there are other tests on carriage wheels that do not agree.&lt;ref name=treatise /&gt; Theory of a cylinder rolling on an elastic roadway also gives this same rule&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;Williams, 1994, Ch. "Rolling contacts", eq. 11.1, p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt; These contradict earlier (1785) tests by Coulomb of rolling wooden cylinders where Coulomb reported that rolling resistance was inversely proportional to the diameter of the wheel (known as "Coulomb's law").&lt;ref&gt;Hersey, subsection: "Coulomb on wooden cylinders", p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; This disputed (or wrongly applied)
-"Coulomb's law" is still found in handbooks, however.

===Pneumatic tires===
For pneumatic tires on hard pavement, it is reported that the effect of diameter on rolling resistance is negligible (within a practical range of diameters).&lt;ref&gt;U.S. National Bureau of Standards, Fig. 1.13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some{{who|date=May 2012}} think that smaller tire wheels, all else being equal, tend to have higher rolling resistance than larger wheels. In some laboratory tests, however, such as [http://www.legslarry.beerdrinkers.co.uk/tech/GS.htm Greenspeed test results (accessdate = 2007-10-27)], smaller wheels appeared to have similar or lower losses than large wheels, but these tests were done rolling the wheels against a small-diameter drum, which would theoretically remove the advantage of large-diameter wheels, thus making the tests irrelevant for resolving this issue. Another counter example to the claim of smaller wheels having higher rolling resistance can be found in the area of [[Soap Box Derby|ultimate speed]] soap box derby racing. In this race, the speeds have increased as wheel diameters have decreased by up to 50%. This might suggest that rolling resistance may not be increasing significantly with smaller diameter within a practical range, if any other of the many variables involved have been controlled for. See [[{{TALKPAGENAME}}#Pneumatic tires, effect of diameter|talk page]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dependence on applied torque==

The driving [[torque]] &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; to overcome rolling resistance &lt;math&gt;R_{r}&lt;/math&gt; and maintain steady speed on level ground (with no air resistance) can be calculated by:
:&lt;math&gt; T = \frac{V_{s}}{\Omega} R_r &lt;/math&gt;
:where
:: &lt;math&gt;V_s&lt;/math&gt; is the linear speed of the body (at the axle), and
:: &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; its rotational speed.
It is noteworthy that &lt;math&gt;V_{s}/\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is usually not equal to the radius of the rolling body.&lt;ref&gt;GÃ©rard-Philippe ZÃ©hil, Henri P.

"Applied torque" may either be driving torque applied by a motor (often through a [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]]) or a braking torque applied by [[brake]]s (including [[Regenerative brake|regenerative braking]]). Such torques results in energy dissipation (above that due to the basic rolling resistance of a freely rolling, non-driven, non-braked wheel). This additional loss is in part due to the fact that there is some slipping of the wheel, and for pneumatic tires, there is more flexing of the sidewalls due to the torque. Slip is defined such that a 2% slip means that the circumferential speed of the driving wheel exceeds the speed of the vehicle by 2%.

A small percentage slip can result in a much larger percentage increase in rolling resistance. For example, for pneumatic tires, a 5% slip can translate into a 200% increase in rolling resistance.&lt;ref name=Roberts-torque/&gt; This is partly because the [[tractive force]] applied during this slip is many times greater than the rolling resistance force and thus much more power per unit velocity is being applied (recall [[Power (physics)#Mechanical power|power]] = force x velocity so that power per unit of velocity is just force). So just a small percentage increase in circumferential velocity due to slip can translate into a loss of traction power which may even exceed the power loss due to basic (ordinary) rolling resistance. For railroads, this effect may be even more pronounced due to the low rolling resistance of steel wheels.

===Railroad steel wheels===
In order to apply any [[Traction (engineering)|traction]] to the wheels, some slippage of the wheel is required.&lt;ref&gt;ÐÐµÐµÐ², p.30 including eq. (2.7) and Fig. 2.3&lt;/ref&gt; For Russian trains climbing up a grade, this slip is normally 1.5% to 2.5%.

Slip (also known as [[Rail adhesion#Forces on wheels|creep]]) is normally roughly directly proportional to [[Tractive force|tractive effort]]. An exception is if the tractive effort is so high that the wheel is close to substantial slipping (more than just a few percent as discussed above), then slip rapidly increases with tractive effort and is no longer linear. With a little higher applied tractive effort the wheel spins out of control and the [[Rail adhesion|adhesion]] drops resulting in the wheel spinning even faster. This is the type of slipping that is observable by eyeâthe slip of say 2% for traction is only observed by instruments. Such rapid slip may result in excessive wear or damage.

===Pneumatic tires===
Rolling resistance greatly increases with applied torque. At high torques, which apply a tangential force to the road of about half the weight of the vehicle, the rolling resistance may triple (a 200% increase).&lt;ref name=Roberts-torque&gt;Roberts, Fig. 17: "Effect of torque transmission on rolling resistance", p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; This is in part due to a slip of about 5%. The rolling resistance increase with applied torque is not linear, but increases at a faster rate as the torque becomes higher.

==Dependence on wheel load==

===Railroad steel wheels===
The rolling resistance coefficient, Crr, significantly decreases as the weight of the rail car per wheel increases.&lt;ref&gt;ÐÑÑÐ°ÑÐ¾Ð², Figs. 3.8, 3.9, 3.11, pp. 50-55. Hay, Fig. 60-2, p. 72 shows the same phenomena but has higher values for Crr and not reported here since the railroads in 2011 [https://web.archive.org/web/20100626045718/http://www.istc.illinois.edu/about/SeminarPresentations/20091118.pdf].
 were claiming about the same value as ÐÑÑÐ°ÑÐ¾Ð²&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an empty Russian freight car had about twice the Crr as loaded car (Crr=0.002 vs. Crr=0.001). This same "economy of scale" shows up in testing of mine rail cars.&lt;ref&gt;Hersey, Table 6., p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; The theoretical Crr for a rigid wheel rolling on an elastic roadbed shows Crr inversely proportional to the square root of the load.&lt;ref name=Williams /&gt;

If Crr is itself dependent on wheel load per an inverse square-root rule, then for an increase in load of 2% only a 1% increase in rolling resistance occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Per this assumption, &lt;math&gt;F=k N^{0.5}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is the rolling resistance force and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the normal load force on the wheel due to vehicle weight, and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a constant. It can be readily shown by differentiation of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; using [[Differentiation rules#The polynomial or elementary power rule|this rule]] that &lt;math&gt;{\operatorname{d}N\over N}=2{\operatorname{d}F\over F}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pneumatic tires===
For pneumatic tires, the direction of change in Crr (rolling resistance coefficient) depends on whether or not tire inflation is increased with increasing load.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, pp. 60-61.&lt;/ref&gt; It is reported that, if inflation pressure is increased with load according to an (undefined) "schedule", then a 20% increase in load decreases Crr by 3%. But, if the inflation pressure is not changed, then a 20% increase in load results in a 4% increase in Crr. Of course, this will increase the rolling resistance by 20% due to the increase in load plus 1.2 x 4% due to the increase in Crr resulting in a 24.8% increase in rolling resistance.

==Dependence on curvature of roadway==

===General===
When a vehicle ([[motor vehicle]] or railroad [[train]]) goes around a curve, rolling resistance usually increases. If the curve is not [[Banked curve#Frictionless banked curve|banked]] so as to exactly counter the [[centrifugal force]] with an equal and opposing [[centripetal force]] due to the banking, then there will be a net unbalanced sideways force on the vehicle.
This will result in increased rolling resistance. [[Banked curve|Banking]] is also known as [[Cant (road/rail)|"superelevation" or "cant"]] (not to be confused with [[Cant (road/rail)#Rail|rail cant]] of a [[Track (rail transport)#Rail|rail]]). For railroads, this is called [[curve resistance]] but for [[road]]s it has (at least once) been called rolling resistance due to [[Cornering force|cornering]].

==Sound effects==
Rolling friction generates sound (vibrational) energy, as mechanical energy is converted to this form of energy due to the friction. One of the most common examples of rolling friction is the movement of [[motor vehicle]] tires on a [[roadway]], a process which generates [[roadway noise|sound]] as a by-product.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/x1707075n815g604/] C. Michael Hogan, ''Analysis of Highway Noise'', Journal of Soil, Air and Water Pollution, Springer Verlag Publishers, Netherlands, Volume 2, Number 3 / September, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; The sound generated by automobile and truck tires as they roll (especially noticeable at highway speeds) is mostly due to the percussion of the tire treads, and compression (and subsequent decompression) of air temporarily captured within the treads.&lt;ref&gt;Gwidon W. Stachowiak, Andrew William Batchelor, ''Engineering Tribology'', Elsevier Publisher, 750 pages (2000) {{ISBN|0-7506-7304-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors that contribute in tires==
Several factors affect the magnitude of rolling resistance a tire generates:
* As mentioned in the introduction: wheel radius, forward speed, surface adhesion, and relative micro-sliding.
* Material - different fillers and polymers in tire composition can improve traction while reducing hysteresis. The replacement of some carbon black with higher-priced silicaâsilane is one common way of reducing rolling resistance.&lt;ref name = "NAS286" /&gt; The use of exotic materials including nano-clay has been shown to reduce rolling resistance in high performance rubber tires.&lt;ref&gt;http://144.206.159.178/ft/200/607426/12614863.pdf{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Solvents may also be used to swell solid tires, decreasing the rolling resistance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rubberchemtechnol.org/resource/1/rctea4/v3/i1/p19_s1?isAuthorized=no{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dimensions - rolling resistance in tires is related to the flex of sidewalls and the contact area of the tire&lt;ref name = "schwalbe"&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.schwalbetires.com/tech_info/rolling_resistance
| title = Schwalbe Tires: Rolling Resistance}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, at the same pressure, wider [[bicycle tire]]s flex less in the sidewalls as they roll and thus have lower rolling resistance (although higher air resistance).&lt;ref name="schwalbe"/&gt;  
* Extent of inflation - Lower pressure in tires results in more flexing of the sidewalls and higher rolling resistance.&lt;ref name="schwalbe"/&gt; This energy conversion in the sidewalls increases resistance and can also lead to overheating and may have played a part in the infamous [[Ford Explorer]] [[Firestone vs Ford Motor Company controversy|rollover accidents]].
* Over inflating tires (such a bicycle tires) may not lower the overall rolling resistance as the tire may skip and hop over the road surface. Traction is sacrificed, and overall rolling friction may not be reduced as the wheel rotational speed changes and slippage increases.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}
* Sidewall deflection is not a direct measurement of rolling friction. A high quality tire with a high quality (and supple) casing will allow for more flex per energy loss than a cheap tire with a stiff sidewall.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Again, on a bicycle, a quality tire with a supple casing will still roll easier than a cheap tire with a stiff casing. Similarly, as noted by Goodyear truck tires, a tire with a "fuel saving" casing will benefit the fuel economy through many tread lives (i.e. retreading), while a tire with a "fuel saving" tread design will only benefit until the tread wears down.
* In tires, [[tread]] thickness and shape has much to do with rolling resistance. The thicker and more contoured the tread, the higher the rolling resistance&lt;ref name="schwalbe"/&gt; Thus, the "fastest" bicycle tires have very little tread and heavy duty trucks get the best fuel economy as the tire tread wears out.
* Diameter effects seem to be negligible, provided the pavement is hard and the range of diameters is limited. See [[#Dependence on diameter|dependence on diameter]].
* Virtually all world speed records have been set on relatively narrow wheels,{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} probably because of their aerodynamic advantage at high speed, which is much less important at normal speeds.
* Temperature: with both solid and pneumatic tires, rolling resistance has been found to decrease as temperature increases (within a range of temperatures: i.e. there is an upper limit to this effect)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recumbents.com/mars/pages/proj/tetz/other/Crr.html The Recumbent Bicycle and Human Powered Vehicle Information Center&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S National Bureau of Standards p.? and Williams p.?&lt;/ref&gt; For a rise in temperature from 30&amp;nbsp;Â°C to 70&amp;nbsp;Â°C the rolling resistance decreased by 20-25%.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, "Effect of temperature", p.59&lt;/ref&gt; It is claimed that racers heat their tire before racing.

==Railroads: Components of rolling resistance==
In a broad sense rolling resistance can be defined as the sum of components&lt;ref&gt;ÐÑÑÐ°ÑÐ¾Ð², p. 74, Although ÐÑÑÐ°ÑÐ¾Ð² list these components, he doesn't give the sum a name.&lt;/ref&gt;): 
# Wheel bearing torque losses. 
# Pure rolling resistance.
# Sliding of the wheel on the rail.
# Loss of energy to the roadbed (and earth). 
# Loss of energy to oscillation of railway rolling stock.

Wheel bearing torque losses can be measured as a rolling resistance at the wheel rim, [[#Rolling resistance coefficient|Crr]]. Railroads normally use roller bearings which are either [[Rolling-element bearing#Cylindrical roller|cylindrical]] (Russia)&lt;ref name=cars-Russia&gt;Ð¨Ð°Ð´ÑÑ. Ð. Ð. (editor). ÐÐ°Ð³Ð¾Ð½Ñ {{ru icon}}(Railway cars). ÐÐ¾ÑÐºÐ²Ð°, Ð¢ÑÐ°Ð½ÑÐ¿Ð¾ÑÑ, 1980. pp. 122 and figs. VI.1 p. 123 VI.2 p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Rolling-element bearing#Tapered roller|tapered]] (United States).&lt;ref&gt;Association of American Railroads, Mechanical Division "Car and Locomotive Encyclopedia", New York, Simmons-Boardman, 1974. Section 14: "Axle journals and bearings". Almost all of the ads in this section are for the tapered type of bearing.&lt;/ref&gt; The specific rolling resistance in Russian bearings varies with both wheel loading and speed.&lt;ref&gt;ÐÑÑÐ°ÑÐ¾Ð², Fig 4.2, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; Wheel bearing rolling resistance is lowest with high axle loads and intermediate speeds of 60â80&amp;nbsp;km/h with a Crr of 0.00013 (axle load of 21 tonnes). For empty freight cars with axle loads of 5.5 tonnes, Crr goes up to 0.00020 at 60&amp;nbsp;km/h but at a low speed of 20&amp;nbsp;km/h it increases to 0.00024 and at a high speed (for freight trains) of 120&amp;nbsp;km/h it is 0.00028. The Crr obtained above is added to the Crr of the other components to obtain the total Crr for the wheels.

==Comparing rolling resistance of highway vehicles and trains==
The rolling resistance of steel wheels on steel rail of a train is far less than that of the rubber tires wheels of an automobile or truck. The weight of trains varies greatly; in some cases they may be much heavier per passenger or per net ton of freight than an automobile or truck, but in other cases they may be much lighter.

As an example of a very heavy passenger train, in 1975, Amtrak passenger trains weighed a little over 7 tonnes per passenger,&lt;ref name=rr_stat&gt;Statistics of railroads of class I in the United States, Years 1965 to 1975: Statistical summary. Washington DC, Association of American Railroads, Economics and Finance Dept. See table for Amtrak, p.16. To get the tons per passenger divide ton-miles (including locomotives) by passenger-miles. To get tons-gross/tons-net, divide gross ton-mi (including locomotives) (in the "operating statistics" table by the revenue ton-miles (from the "Freight traffic" table)&lt;/ref&gt; which is much heavier than an average of a little over one ton per passenger for an automobile. This means that for an Amtrak passenger train in 1975, much of the energy savings of the lower rolling resistance was lost to its greater weight.

An example of a very light high-speed passenger train is the [[N700 Series Shinkansen]], which weighs 715 tonnes and carries 1323 passengers, resulting in a per-passenger weight of about half a tonne. This lighter weight per passenger, combined with the lower rolling resistance of steel wheels on steel rail means that an N700 Shinkansen is much more energy efficient than a typical automobile.

In the case of freight, CSX ran an advertisement campaign in 2013 claiming that their freight trains move "a ton of freight 436 miles on a gallon of fuel", whereas some sources claim trucks move a ton of freight about 130 miles per gallon of fuel, indicating trains are more efficient overall.

The '''Society for the Study of Evolution''' is a professional organization of [[evolutionary biologists]]. It was formed in the [[United States]] in 1946 to promote [[evolution]] and the integration of various fields of science concerned with evolution and to organize the publication of a scientific journal to report on new research on evolution across a variety of fields.

The Society was established at a meeting in St. Louis on March 30, 1946. Fifty-seven scientists attended the meeting, which was chaired by [[Alfred E. Emerson]]. [[George Gaylord Simpson]] was elected as the Society's first President, with [[E. B. Babcock]], Emerson, and [[J. T. Patterson]] as his Vice-presidents and [[Ernst Mayr]] as secretary.&lt;ref&gt;Cain, Joseph. 1994.

For the 'promotion' and 'integration' of various fields: first years of ''Evolution'', 1947-1949. ''Archives of Natural History'' '''27''': 231-259.&lt;/ref&gt; This society grew as an extension of the US [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]]'s Committee on Common Problems of Genetics and Paleontology (later renamed the Committee on Common Problems of Genetics, Paleontology and Systematics).&lt;ref&gt;Cain, Joe, ed. 2004.

''Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences''. ''33'': 283-313.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first annual meeting of the society was held in Boston, December 28â31, 1946. A grant from the [[American Philosophical Society]] led to the publication of the journal ''[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]]''.

Commonly known as 'evolution meeting,' the annual conference is often held together with the [[Society of Systematic Biologists]] and the [[American Society of Naturalists]].

The society has an official journal ''[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]]''. It was started in 1947 and is published by [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Evolution''|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15585646|website=Wiley Online Library|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, it launched a second journal ''Evolution Letters''.&lt;ref&gt;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/20563744&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SAPIA''' ('''South African Petroleum Industry Association''') was formed in July 1994 by six of [[South Africa]]'s leading [[petroleum]] refining  and marketing companies namely: 

* [[BP|BP (SA) (PTY) LTD]]
* [[Caltex|Caltex Oil (SA) (PTY) LTD]]
* [[Engen Petroleum]] LTD
* [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell (SA) (PTY) LTD]]
* [[Sasol Limited]]
* [[Total South Africa|Total (SA) (PTY) LTD]]
* Zenex Oil (PTY) LTD (No longer a member)

The stated goal of the organisation is to represent the interests of the petroleum refining and marketing industry in South Africa. The organisation's aim is to ensure that all interested parties clearly understand the contribution that this industry makes to the economic and social development of South Africa. Zenex Oil (PTY) LTD has subsequently become part of Engen Petroleum LTD.  Sasol LTD and TEPCO Petroleum (PTY) LTD joined the organisation in 2000. [[Mossgas]] (PTY) LTD was replaced by [[PetroSA]] (PTY) LTD in 2002.  

SAPIA is managed by a board with representation from each of the member companies. The organisation's headquarters is situated in [[Johannesburg]] with Mr. A (Avhaphani) Tshifularo as its current executive director.

The organisation's website provides information as to how fuel prices in South Africa are determined (many liquid fuels in South Africa are subject to price controls). The site also has information on the demand for liquid fuel in South Africa.

SAPIA was in the news early in 1995 during the arguments about the protection that [[Sasol]] (then not yet a member) received from government. In protest, SAPIA withdrew from the National Economic Development &amp; Labour Council (NEDLAC) initiative's liquid fuels task team and was strongly criticized for this move, especially by [[Cosatu]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4893">'''Tachyon condensation''' is a process in [[particle physics]] in which a system can lower its energy by spontaneously producing particles.  The end result is a "condensate" of particles that fills the volume of the system.  Tachyon condensation is closely related to second-order [[phase transition]]s.

==Technical overview==
Tachyon condensation is a process in which a [[tachyonic field]]&amp;mdash;usually a [[Scalar field theory|scalar field]]&amp;mdash;with a [[complex number|complex]] mass acquires a [[vacuum expectation value]] and reaches the minimum of the potential energy. While the field is tachyonic and unstable near the local maximum of the potential, the field gets a non-negative squared mass and becomes stable near the minimum.

The appearance of tachyons is a potentially serious problem for any theory; examples of tachyonic fields amenable to condensation are all cases of [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]]. In [[condensed matter physics]] a notable example is [[ferromagnetism]]; in [[particle physics]] the best known example is the [[Higgs mechanism]] in the [[standard model]] that breaks the [[electroweak]] symmetry.

==Condensation evolution==
Although the notion of a tachyonic [[imaginary number|imaginary]] mass might seem troubling because there is no classical interpretation of an imaginary mass, the mass is not quantized.  Rather, the [[scalar field]] is; even for tachyonic [[quantum field theory|quantum fields]], the field operators at [[Minkowski space|spacelike]] separated points still [[Canonical commutation relation|commute (or anticommute)]], thus preserving causality. Therefore, information still does not propagate faster than light,&lt;ref name="feinberg67"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Gerald | last = Feinberg | authorlink = Gerald Feinberg | title = Possibility of Faster-Than-Light Particles | journal = Physical Review | volume = 159 | year = 1967 | pages = 1089â1105 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.159.1089|bibcode = 1967PhRv..159.1089F | issue = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and solutions grow exponentially, but not superluminally (there is no violation of [[causality]]).

The "imaginary mass" really means that the system becomes unstable. The zero value field is at a [[local maximum]] rather than a local minimum of its potential energy, much like a ball at the top of a hill. A very small impulse (which will always happen due to quantum fluctuations) will lead the field to roll down with [[exponential growth|exponentially increasing]] amplitudes toward the local minimum. In this way, tachyon condensation drives a physical system that has reached a local limit and might naively be expected to produce physical tachyons, to an alternate stable state where no physical tachyons exist. Once the tachyonic field reaches the minimum of the potential, its quanta are not tachyons any more but rather are ordinary particles with a positive mass-squared, such as the [[Higgs boson]].&lt;ref name = "Peskin"&gt;Michael E. Peskin and Daniel V. Schroeder (1995). ''An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory'', Perseus books publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tachyon condensation in string theory==
In the late 1990s, [[Ashoke Sen]] conjectured&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ashoke|last=Sen|authorlink=Ashoke Sen|title=Tachyon condensation on the brane antibrane system|journal=JHEP|volume=8|year=1998|pages=012â012|doi=10.1088/1126-6708/1998/08/012|arxiv = hep-th/9805170 |bibcode = 1998JHEP...08..012S|issue=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the tachyons carried by [[Open string (physics)|open strings]] attached to [[D-branes]] in [[string theory]] reflect the instability of the D-branes with respect to their complete annihilation. The total energy carried by these tachyons has been calculated in [[string field theory]]; it agrees with the total energy of the D-branes, and all other tests have confirmed Sen's conjecture as well. Tachyons therefore became an active area of interest in the early 2000s.

The character of closed-string tachyon condensation is more subtle, though the first steps towards our understanding of their fate have been made by Adams, [[Joseph Polchinski|Polchinski]], and [[Eva Silverstein|Silverstein]], in the case of twisted closed string tachyons, and by Simeon Hellerman and Ian Swanson, in a wider array of cases. The fate of the closed string tachyon in the 26-dimensional [[bosonic string theory]] remains unknown, though recent progress has revealed interesting new developments.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

The highest tides of the year may be known as the [[king tide]], with the month varying by location. In [[Florida]], controversy was created when state-level government mandated that the term "nuisance flooding" and other terms be used in place of terms such as [[sea level rise]], [[climate change]] and [[global warming]], prompting allegations of [[climate change denial]], specifically against [[Governor of Florida|Governor]] [[Rick Scott]]. This amid Florida, specifically [[South Florida]] and the [[Miami metropolitan area]] being one of the most at risk areas in the world for the potential [[effects of sea level rise]], and where the frequency and severity of tidal flooding events increased in the 21st century.&lt;ref name="scidirect"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0964569116300278 |title=Increasing flooding hazard in coastal communities due to rising sea level: Case study of Miami Beach, Florida |work=Ocean &amp; Coastal Management |first1=Shimon |last1=Wdowinski |first2=Ronald |last2=Bray |first3=Ben P. |last3=Kirtman |first4= Zhaohua |last4=Wu |pp=1â8 |via=[[ScienceDirect]] |accessdate=December 7, 2016 |doi=10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2016.03.002 |volume=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue is more bipartisan in South Florida, particularly in places like [[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]], where a several hundred million dollar project is underway to install more than 50 pumps and physically raise roads to combat the flooding, mainly along the west side of [[South Beach]], formerly a mangrove wetland where the average elevation is less than {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us|spell=in}}. In the Miami area, where the vast majority of the land is below {{convert|10|ft|m}}, even a one-foot increase over the average high tide can cause widespread flooding. The 2015 and 2016 [[king tide]] event levels reached about {{convert|4|ft|m|1}} [[MLLW]], {{convert|3|ft|m|1}} above [[mean sea level]], or about {{convert|2|ft|m}} [[North American Vertical Datum of 1988|NAVD88]], and nearly the same above [[MHHW]].&lt;ref name="OctWaterLevels"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/waterlevels.html?id=8723214&amp;units=standard&amp;bdate=20161002&amp;edate=20161101&amp;timezone=GMT&amp;datum=MLLW&amp;interval=6&amp;action=|title=Water Levels - NOAA Tides &amp; Currents (October 2016)|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) |accessdate=November 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the tide range is very small in Miami, averaging about {{convert|2|ft|m}}, with the greatest range being less than {{convert|2|m|ft}},&lt;ref name="virginiamain"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/stationhome.html?id=8723214|title=Virginia Key, FL - Station ID: 8723214 |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |accessdate=November 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the area is very acute to minute differences down to single inches due to the vast area at low elevation. NOAA [[tide gauge]] data for most stations shows current water level graphs relative to a fixed [[Geodetic datum|datum]], as well as mean sea level trends for some stations. During the king tides, the local Miami area tide gauge at [[Virginia Key]] shows levels running at times {{convert|1|ft|m}} or more over datum.

[[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]] has installed over one hundred tidal valves since 2013 to combat flooding. Fort Lauderdale is nicknamed the "Venice of America" due to its roughly {{convert|165|mi|km}} of canals.&lt;ref name="BBClong"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20170403-miamis-fight-against-sea-level-rise|title=Miami's Fight Against Rising Seas |network=[[BBC News]] |date=April 4, 2017 |author=Amanda Ruggeri |accessdate=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tidal flooding is capable of majorly inhibiting natural gravity-based drainage systems in low-lying areas when it reaches levels that are below visible inundation of the surface, but which are high enough to incapacitate the lower drainage or sewer system. Thus, even normal rainfall or storm surge events can cause greatly amplified flooding effects. One passive solution to intrusion through drainage systems are one way back-flow valves in drainage ways. However, while this may prevent a majority of the tidal intrusion, it also inhibits drainage during exceptionally high tides that shut the valves. In Miami Beach, where resilience work is underway, the pump systems replace insufficient gravity-based systems.&lt;ref name="YCC1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2017/05/miami-beach-is-spending-millions-to-hold-back-the-sea/ |title=Miami Beach spends millions to hold back the sea |date=May 10, 2017 |author=Diana Madson |publisher=Yale Climate Connections |accessdate=May 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Holland Island house.jpg|thumb|The last remaining house on Holland Island that collapsed and was torn down in the 2010s as [[Coastal erosion|erosion]] and tides reached the foundation.]]
Due to changing geography such as [[subsidence]], and poorly planned development, tidal flooding may exist separate from modern nuisance flooding associated with sea level rise and anthropocentric climate change. The widely publicized [[Holland Island]] in [[Maryland]] for example has disappeared over the years mainly due to subsidence and [[coastal erosion]].&lt;ref name="Sun"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/features/green/bs-gr-bay-vanishing-island-20101022,0,6319144.story?page=1|title=Holland Island house collapse 'end of an era'|last=Wheeler|first=Timothy B.|date=October 22, 2010|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|accessdate=November 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[New Orleans]] area on the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] of [[Louisiana]], land subsidence results in the [[Grand Isle, Louisiana|Grand Isle]] tide gauge showing an extreme upward sea level trend.&lt;ref name="GisleTG"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends_station.shtml?id=8761724 |title=Mean Sea Level Trend 8761724 Grand Isle, Louisiana |publisher=NOAA |accessdate=November 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, South Florida experienced significant coastal erosion and flooding outside of the usual king tide or hurricane season during a [[Nor'easter]] event.&lt;ref name="CBSMarch2018"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://miami.cbslocal.com/2018/03/05/massive-waves-sand-water-dania-beach/ |title=Massive Waves Push Sand, Water Inland And Cause Flooding Issues In Dania Beach |publisher=[[WFOR-TV]] |date= March 5, 2018 |author=David Sutta |accessdate=March 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Although all matter is formed by [[atom]]s, matter can have different properties and appear in different forms, such as [[solid]], [[liquid]], [[superfluid]], [[magnet]], etc. These various forms of matter are often called [[states of matter]] or [[phase (matter)|phases]]. According to [[condensed matter physics]] and the principle of [[emergence]], the different properties of materials originate from the different ways in which the atoms are organized in the materials. Those different organizations of the atoms (or other particles) are formally called the [[phase transition|orders]] in the materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author= Xiao-Gang Wen |authorlink= Xiao-Gang Wen |title= An Introduction of Topological Orders |url= http://dao.mit.edu/~wen/topartS3.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atoms can organize in many ways which lead to many different orders and many different types of materials. Landau [[Spontaneous symmetry breaking|symmetry-breaking]] theory provides a general understanding of these different orders.  It points out that different orders really correspond to different symmetries in the organizations of the constituent atoms.  As a material changes from one order to another order (i.e., as the material undergoes a [[phase transition]]), what happens is that the symmetry of the organization of the atoms changes.

For example, atoms have a random distribution in a [[liquid]], so a liquid remains the same as we displace atoms by an arbitrary distance.  We say that a liquid has a ''continuous translation symmetry''.  After a phase transition, a liquid can turn into a [[crystal]].  In a crystal, atoms organize into a regular array (a [[crystal structure|lattice]]).  A lattice remains unchanged only when we displace it by a particular distance (integer times a [[lattice constant]]), so a crystal has only ''discrete translation symmetry''.  The phase transition between a liquid and a crystal is a transition that reduces the continuous translation symmetry of the liquid to the discrete symmetry of the crystal. Such a change in symmetry is called ''symmetry breaking''. The essence of the difference between liquids and crystals is therefore that the organizations of atoms have different symmetries in the two phases.

Landau [[Landau theory|symmetry-breaking theory]] has been a very successful theory. For a long time, physicists believed that Landau Theory described all possible orders in materials, and all possible (continuous) phase transitions.

==Discovery and characterization==
However, since the late 1980s, it has become gradually apparent that Landau symmetry-breaking theory may not describe all possible orders.  In an attempt to explain [[high temperature superconductivity]]&lt;ref name=BM8689&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bednorz | first1 = G. | last2 = Mueller | first2 = K.A. | year = 1986 | title = Possible high TC superconductivity in the Ba-La-Cu-O system | url = | journal = Z. Phys. B | volume = 64 | issue = 2| pages = 189â193 | doi = 10.1007/BF01303701 | bibcode = 1986ZPhyB..64..189B }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Chirality|chiral]] spin state was introduced.&lt;ref name=KL8795/&gt;&lt;ref name=WWZ8913/&gt; At first, physicists still wanted to use Landau symmetry-breaking theory to describe the chiral spin state. They identified the chiral spin state as a state that breaks the time reversal and parity symmetries, but not the spin rotation symmetry.  This should be the end of the story according to Landau's symmetry breaking description of orders.  However, it was quickly realized that there are many different chiral spin states that have exactly the same symmetry, so symmetry alone was not enough to characterize different chiral spin states.  This means that the chiral spin states contain a new kind of order that is beyond the usual symmetry description.&lt;ref name=W8987&gt;[[Xiao-Gang Wen]], Phys. Rev.

But experiments{{which|date=February 2016}} soon indicated{{how|date=February 2016}} that chiral spin states do not describe high-temperature superconductors, and the theory of topological order became a theory with no experimental realization. However, the similarity between chiral spin states and [[quantum Hall effect|quantum Hall]] states allows one to use the theory of topological order to describe different quantum Hall states.&lt;ref name=wenniu/&gt; Just like chiral spin states, different quantum Hall states all have the same symmetry and are outside the Landau symmetry-breaking description.  One finds that the different orders in different quantum Hall states can indeed be described by topological orders, so the topological order does have experimental realizations.

The [[quantum Hall effect|fractional quantum Hall]] (FQH) state was discovered in 1982&lt;ref name=TSG8259/&gt;&lt;ref name=L8395/&gt; before the introduction of the concept of topological order in 1989.  But the FQH state is not the first experimentally discovered topologically ordered state. The [[superconductor]], discovered in 1911, is the first experimentally discovered topologically ordered state; it has [[''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; topological order]].{{#tag:ref|Note that superconductivity can be described by the [[Ginzburg-Landau theory]] with dynamical U(1) EM gauge field, which is a ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gauge theory, that is, an effective theory of ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; topological order. The prediction of the vortex state in superconductors was one of the main successes of Ginzburg-Landau theory with dynamical U(1) gauge field. The vortex in the gauged Ginzburg-Landau theory is nothing but the ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; flux line in the ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gauge theory.

Although topologically ordered states usually appear in strongly interacting boson/fermion systems, a simple kind of topological order can also appear in free fermion systems. This kind of topological order corresponds to integral quantum Hall state, which can be characterized by the [[Chern number]] of the filled energy band if we consider integer quantum Hall state on a lattice. Theoretical calculations have proposed that such Chern numbers can be measured for a free fermion system experimentally.&lt;ref name="physics today"&gt;{{cite journal|last=JuzeliÅ«nas|first=Gediminas|author2=Ian Spielman |title=Seeing Topological Order|journal=Physics Today|year=2011|volume=4|issue=99|pages=99|doi=10.1103/Physics.4.99|url=http://physics.aps.org/articles/v4/99|bibcode = 2011PhyOJ...4...99J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;!--&gt;We note that the Chern number of a filled band can only characterize a particular kind of topological order -- integral quantum Hall state.
The Chern number and the above proposed experiments cannot probe more generic topological orders, such as the ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; topological order.
Because of this, it is not proper to put the measurement of Chern number
at the beginning of this article.
&lt;--&gt;
It is also well known that such a Chern number can be measured (maybe indirectly) by edge states.

==Mechanism==

A large class of 2+1D topological orders is realized through a mechanism called [[string-net condensation]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Levin, [[Xiao-Gang Wen]], Phys. Rev. B, '''71''', 045110 (2005), "String-net condensation: A physical mechanism for topological phases"&lt;/ref&gt; This class of topological orders can have a gapped edge and are classified by unitary fusion category (or [[monoidal category]]) theory. One finds that string-net condensation can generate infinitely many different types of topological orders, which may indicate that there are many different new types of materials remaining to be discovered.

The collective motions of condensed strings give rise to excitations above the string-net condensed states. Those excitations turn out to be [[gauge bosons]]. The ends of strings are defects which correspond to another type of excitations. Those excitations are the [[gauge charges]] and can carry [[Fermi]] or [[fractional statistics]].&lt;ref&gt;Levin M. and Wen X-G., Fermions, strings, and gauge fields in lattice spin models., ''Phys. Rev. B'' '''67''', 245316, (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herbertsmithite]] may realize such ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; spin liquid.)

==Mathematical Foundation==

We know that group theory is the mathematical foundation of symmetry-breaking orders.  What is the mathematical foundation of topological order? 
It was found that a subclass of 2+1D topological ordersâAbelian topological ordersâcan be classified by a K-matrix approach.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The string-net condensation suggests that tensor category (such as fusion category or [[monoidal category]]) is part of the mathematical foundation of topological order in 2+1D. The more recent researches suggest that
(up to invertible topological orders that have no fractionalized excitations):

* 2+1D bosonic topological orders are classified by unitary modular tensor categories.
* 2+1D bosonic topological orders with symmetry G are classified by G-crossed tensor categories.
* 2+1D bosonic/fermionic topological orders with symmetry G are classified by unitary braided fusion categories over symmetric fusion category, that has modular extensions. The symmetric fusion category Rep(G) for bosonic systems and sRep(G) for fermionic systems.

Topological order in higher dimensions may be related to n-Category theory. Quantum [[operator algebra]] is a very important mathematical tool in studying topological orders.

Some also suggest that topological order is mathematically described by ''extended quantum symmetry''.&lt;ref&gt;Algebraic Topology Foundations of Supersymmetry and Symmetry Breaking in Quantum Field Theory and Quantum Gravity: A Review., Baianu, I.C., J.F. Glazebrook and R.  Brown., SIGMA-081030, (2009), 78 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
&lt;!--&gt;
[[File:Topological insulator band structure.svg|thumb|right|200px|An idealized band structure for a [[topological insulator]] which has no topological order.]]
&lt;--&gt;
The materials described by Landau symmetry-breaking theory have had a substantial impact on technology. For example, [[ferromagnet]]ic materials that break [[spin (physics)|spin]] rotation symmetry can be used as the media of digital information storage. A hard drive made of ferromagnetic materials can store [[gigabyte]]s of information.  [[Liquid crystal]]s that break the rotational symmetry of [[molecules]] find wide application in display technology.  Crystals that break translation symmetry lead to well defined [[Electronic band structure|electronic bands]] which in turn allow us to make [[semiconductor|semiconducting]] devices such as [[transistor]]s. Different types of topological orders are even richer than different types of symmetry-breaking orders. This suggests their potential for exciting, novel applications.

One theorized application would be to use topologically ordered states as media for [[quantum computing]] in a technique known as [[topological quantum computing]]. A topologically ordered state is a state with complicated non-local [[quantum entanglement]]. The non-locality means that the quantum entanglement in a topologically ordered state is distributed among many different particles. As a result, the pattern of quantum entanglements cannot be destroyed by local perturbations. This significantly reduces the effect of [[decoherence]]. This suggests that if we use different quantum entanglements in a topologically ordered state to encode quantum information, the information may last much longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dennis | first1 = Eric | last2 = Kitaev | first2 = Alexei | last3 = Landahl | first3 = Andrew | last4 = Preskill | first4 = John | year = 2002 | title = Topological quantum memory | url = | journal = J.

This process may provide a physical apparatus for performing [[quantum computation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Freedman | first1 = Michael H. | last2 = Kitaev | first2 = Alexei | last3 = Larsen | first3 = Michael J. | last4 = Wang | first4 = Zhenghan | year = 2003 | title = Topological quantum computation | url = | journal = Bull.

Soc. | volume = 40 | issue = | page = 31 | doi=10.1090/s0273-0979-02-00964-3| arxiv = quant-ph/0101025 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, topologically ordered states may provide natural media for both [[quantum memory]] and quantum computation.  Such realizations of quantum memory and quantum computation may potentially be made [[fault tolerant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kitaev | first1 = A. | year = 2003 | title = Fault-tolerant quantum computation by anyons | url = | journal = Annals of Physics | volume = 303 | issue = | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Topologically ordered states in general have a special property that they contain non-trivial boundary states. In many cases, those boundary states become perfect conducting channel that can conduct electricity without generating heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wen | first1 = Xiao-Gang | authorlink = Xiao-Gang Wen | year = 1991 | title = Gapless Boundary Excitations in the FQH States and in the Chiral Spin States | url = http://dao.mit.edu/~wen/pub/bdry.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Phys.

&lt;!--&gt;
Some one put a picture of topological insulator (which has no topological order) in this page.
So we have to clarify that topological insulator is not an example of topological order. Topological insulator is an example another kind of order called
SPT order.
&lt;--&gt;
Similarly to topological order, [[topological insulator]]s&lt;ref&gt;C. Kane and E. Mele, Phys. Rev. Lett. '''95''', 226801 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Murakami, N. Nagaosa, and S.-C. Zhang, Phys. Rev. Lett. '''93''', 156804 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; also have gapless boundary states. The boundary states of topological insulators play a key role in the detection and the application of topological insulators.
This observation naturally leads to a question:
are topological insulators examples of topologically  ordered states?
In fact [[topological insulator]]s are different from topologically ordered states defined in this article.
[[Topological insulator]]s only have short-ranged entanglements and have no topological order, while the topological order defined in this article is a pattern of long-range entanglement. Topological order is robust against any perturbations. It has emergent gauge theory, emergent fractional charge and fractional statistics. In contrast, topological insulators are robust only against perturbations that respect time-reversal and U(1) symmetries. Their quasi-particle excitations have no fractional charge and fractional statistics. Strictly speaking, topological insulator is an example of [[symmetry-protected topological order|SPT order]],&lt;ref name=spt&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = Xie | authorlink3 = Xiao-Gang Wen | last2 = Liu | first2 = Zheng-Xin | last3 = Wen | first3 = Xiao-Gang | year = 2351 | title = 2D symmetry protected topological orders and their protected gapless edge excitations | journal = Phys.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential impact==

Landau [[Spontaneous symmetry breaking|symmetry-breaking]] theory is a cornerstone of [[condensed matter physics]]. It is used to define the territory of condensed matter research. The existence of topological order appears to indicate that nature is much richer than Landau [[Spontaneous symmetry breaking|symmetry-breaking]] theory has so far indicated. So topological order opens up a new direction in condensed matter physicsâa new direction of highly entangled quantum matter.
We realize that quantum phases of matter (i.e. the zero-temperature phases of matter) can be divided into two classes:
long range entangled states and
short range entangled states.&lt;ref name=chen/&gt;
Topological order is the notion that describes the long range entangled states: topological order = pattern of
long range entanglements. Short range  entangled states are trivial in the sense that they all belong to one phase.
However, in the presence of symmetry, even short range  entangled states are nontrivial and can belong to different phases.
Those phases are said to contain [[symmetry-protected topological order|SPT order]].&lt;ref name=spt/&gt; SPT order generalizes the notion
of topological insulator to interacting systems.

Some suggest that topological order (or more precisely, [[string-net condensation]]) in local bosonic (spin) models have the potential to provide a [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0507118v2 unified origin] for [[photons]], [[electrons]] and other [[elementary particles]] in our universe.&lt;ref name="arxiv.org"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4926">A '''toy fort''' is a miniature fortress or castle that is used as a setting to stage battles using [[toy soldier]]s. Toy Forts come in many shapes and sizes; some are copies of existing historical structures, while others are imagined with specific elements to enable realistic play, such as [[moat]]s, [[drawbridge]]s, and [[battlement]]s. Toy fort designs range from the [[chÃ¢teau]]x of [[Europe]] to the [[stockade]] forts of the [[American frontier|American wild west]].

== History ==
Toy forts and castles first appeared at the beginning of the nineteenth century in [[Germany]], a country that dominated the world of [[toy]] manufacturing up until [[World War I|WW1]]. The earliest examples came as a set of generic wooden blocks which could be configured in many different ways. As time went on some of these sets were designed to portray specific structures associated with real [[battle]]s of the time.

Around 1850 dollhouse manufacturers started to apply their production methods and capabilities, to producing toy forts and castles. Sets would consist of wooden components, some blocks and some flat, painted to depict details such as stone, brick, windows, arches and vegetation. The parts would be shipped in a box which was designed to be inverted and then used as the base for the toy fort. This proved to be the standard design for toy forts and castles for the next 100 years.

The Germans dominated the toy fort market until about 1900 when other manufacturers from France, Denmark, Britain, and the USA started to appear on the scene. As the technology progressed new materials were used in the manufacture of toy forts including [[tin]], [[Zinc Alloy Die Casting|zinc alloy]], composition, [[cardboard]], [[hardboard]], [[Medium-density fibreboard|MDF]], and finally [[Plastic|plastics.]]

== Manufacturers ==
The three best-known manufacturers of toy forts were Moritz Gottschalk (Germany), O. and M. Hausser (Germany), and [[Lines Bros]]. ([[Great Britain]]).

* &lt;u&gt;Moritz Gottschalk&lt;/u&gt; (1840â1905) started his career as a bookbinder, but by the age of 25 had branched off into children's toys which would eventually lead to him becoming one of the world's most influential toy makers of the late 19th to early 20th centuries. He started with the dollhouses that he is most famous for and quickly went from a cottage industry to running a factory. Once his infrastructure was in place he was able to diversify adding the manufacture of other toy buildings such as forts, stables, and grocery stores to his repertoire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dollshousespastandpresent.com/issue22sept2014p2.htm|title=Moritz Gottschalk - a brief history|last=diePuppenstubensammlerin|first=|date=2014|website=Doll's Houses Past &amp; Present|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Genius of Moritz Gottschalk|last=Ackerman|first=Evelyn|publisher=Gold Horse Publishing|year=1994|isbn=978-0912823454|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919 three of the sons, Walter, Arthur, and William formed the company Lines Bros. Ltd which used the brand name Triangle Toys, later shortened to Tri-ang. The company's toy forts first hit the toy market around 1931.

'''Waste hierarchy''' is a tool used in the evaluation of processes that [[Environmental protection|protect the environment]] alongside [[resource consumption|resource]] and [[energy consumption]] to most favourable to least favourable actions.&lt;ref name=Hansen&gt;{{cite web|first1=Wenke |last1=Hansen |first2=Maria |last2=Christopher |first3=Maic |last3=Verbuecheln |date=December 2002| title=EU Waste Policies and Challenges for Local and Regional Authorities|url=http://ecologic.eu/sites/files/download/projekte/1900-1949/1921-1922/1921-1922_background_paper_waste_en.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hierarchy establishes preferred program priorities based on [[sustainability]].&lt;ref name=Hansen/&gt;  To be sustainable, waste management cannot be solved only with technical end-of-pipe solutions and an integrated approach is necessary.&lt;ref name=USEPA&gt;{{cite web|author=Environmental Protection Agency |date=2013|title=Non-Hazardous Waste Management Hierarchy|url=http://www.epa.gov/waste/nonhaz/municipal/hierarchy.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''waste management hierarchy''' indicates an order of preference for action to reduce and manage waste, and is usually presented diagrammatically in the form of a pyramid.&lt;ref name=UNEP&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations Environmental Program |year=2013 |url=http://www.unep.org/ietc/Portals/136/Publications/Waste%20Management/UNEP%20NWMS%20English.pdf |title=Guidelines for National Waste Management Strategies Moving from Challenges to Opportunities|isbn=978-92-807-3333-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hierarchy captures the progression of a material or product through successive stages of [[waste management]], and represents the latter part of the [[Product lifecycle|life-cycle for each product]].&lt;ref name=UNEP/&gt;

The aim of the '''waste hierarchy''' is to extract the maximum practical benefits from products and to generate the minimum amount of waste.  The proper application of the waste hierarchy can have several benefits. It can help prevent emissions of greenhouse gases, reduces pollutants, save energy, conserves resources, create jobs and stimulate the development of green technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Waste-to-Energy Research and Technology Council |date=2009|title=Waste Hierarchy|url=http://www.wtert.eu/default.asp?Menue=14&amp;ShowDok=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life-cycle thinking==

All products and services have [[environmental impact]]s, from the extraction of [[raw materials]] for production to manufacture, distribution, use and disposal.   Following the waste hierarchy will generally lead to the most [[resource-efficient]] and environmentally sound choice but in some cases refining decisions within the hierarchy or departing from it can lead to better environmental outcomes.&lt;ref name=EC&gt;{{cite web|author=European Commission|title=Life Cycle Thinking and Assessment for Waste Management|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/publications/pdf/Making_Sust_Consumption.pdf |accessdate=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Product lifecycle|Life cycle]] thinking and assessment can be used to support decision-making in the area of [[waste management]] and to identify the best environmental options. It can help policy makers understand the benefits and trade-offs they have to face when making decisions on waste management strategies. [[Life-cycle assessment]] provides an approach to ensure that the best outcome for the environment can be identified and put in place.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt;  It involves looking at all stages of a productâs life to find where improvements can be made to reduce environmental impacts and improve the use or [[reuse]] of resources.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt;  A key goal is to avoid actions that shift negative impacts from one stage to another.  Life cycle thinking can be applied to the five stages of the waste management hierarchy.

For example, life-cycle analysis has shown that it is often better for the environment to replace an old washing machine, despite the waste generated, than to continue to use an older machine which is less [[Efficient energy use|energy-efficient]]. This is because a washing machineâs greatest environmental impact is during its use phase. Buying an energy-efficient machine and using low- temperature detergent reduce environmental impacts.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt;

The European Union Waste Framework Directive has introduced the concept of life-cycle thinking into [[waste policies]].&lt;ref name=EC/&gt;  This duality approach gives a broader view of all environmental aspects and ensures any action has an overall benefit compared to other options.  The actions to deal with waste along the hierarchy should be compatible with other [[environmental initiative]]s.

== European Union waste framework directive ==

In 1975, The European Unionâs [[Waste Framework Directive]] (1975/442/EEC) introduced for the first time the waste hierarchy concept into European waste policy.&lt;ref name=ECWaste&gt;{{cite web|author=European Commission |date=2014 |title=EU Waste Legislation |url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/legislation/a.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312223737/http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/legislation/a.htm |archivedate=March 12, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasized the importance of [[waste minimization]], and the [[Environmental protection|protection of the environment]] and [[human health]], as a priority. Following the 1975 Directive, European Union policy and legislation adapted to the principles of the waste hierarchy.

In 1989, it was formalized into a hierarchy of management options in the European Commission's Community Strategy for Waste Management and this waste strategy was further endorsed in the Commission's review in 1996.&lt;ref name=GOV.UK&gt;{{cite web|author=Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs|title=Guidance on Applying the Waste Hierarchy|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-applying-the-waste-hierarchy |publisher=gov.uk |accessdate=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the European Union parliament introduced a new ''five-step waste hierarchy'' to its waste legislation, Directive 2008/98/EC, which member states must introduce into national waste management laws.&lt;ref name=ECWaste/&gt; Article 4 of the directive lays down a five-step hierarchy of waste management options which must be applied by Member States in this priority order.&lt;ref name=ECWaste/&gt;  Waste prevention, as the preferred option, is followed by reuse, recycling, recovery including [[energy recovery]] and as a last option, safe disposal. Among engineers, a similar hierarchy of waste management has been known as ARRE strategy: avoid, reduce, recycle, eliminate.&lt;ref name="lienig"&gt;{{Cite book|author=J. Lienig|author2=H. Bruemmer|title=Fundamentals of Electronic Systems Design|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-55840-0|pp=197|publisher=Springer International Publishing|date=2017|isbn=978-3-319-55839-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges for local and regional authorities ==
The task of implementing the waste hierarchy in waste management practices within a country may be delegated to the different levels of government (national, regional, local) and to other possible factors including industry, private companies and households. Local and regional authorities can be particularly challenged by the following issues when applying the waste hierarchy approach.&lt;ref name=Hansen/&gt; 
* A coherent [[waste management]] strategy must be set up
* Separate [[garbage collection|collection]] and [[waste sorting|sorting]] systems for many different waste streams need to be established.
* Adequate [[waste treatment|treatment]] and disposal facilities must be established.
* An effective horizontal co-operation between local authorities and municipalities and a vertical co-operation between the different levels of government, local to regional and when beneficial, also at the national level need to established
* Finding financing for the establishing or upgrading of expensive sustainable waste management infrastructure to address the needs of managing waste
* A lack of data available on waste management strategies must be overcome and monitoring requirements must be met to implement the waste programs
* The enforcement and control of business plans and practices be established and applied to maximize benefits to the environment and human health
* A lack of administrative capacity at the regional and local level. The lack of finances, information, and technical expertise must be overcome for effective implementation and success of the waste management policies.

==Source reduction==
[[Source reduction]] involves efforts to reduce [[hazardous waste]] and other materials by modifying industrial production. Source reduction methods involve changes in manufacturing technology, [[raw material]] inputs, and product formulation. At times, the term "pollution prevention" may refer to source reduction.

Another method of source reduction is to increase incentives for recycling.  Many communities in the United States are implementing [[variable-rate pricing]] for waste disposal (also known as Pay As You Throw - [[PAYT]]) which has been effective in reducing the size of the [[municipal waste]] stream.&lt;ref name="ecocycle"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecocycle.org/zero/pay_throw.cfm|title=Pay-As-You-Throw - Let's Start|accessdate=2006-11-26|author=Mark Ruzzin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Source reduction is typically measured by efficiencies and cutbacks in waste. [[Toxics use reduction]] is a more controversial approach to source reduction that targets and measures reductions in the upstream use of toxic materials. Toxics use reduction emphasizes the more preventive aspects of source reduction but, due to its emphasis on toxic chemical inputs, has been opposed more vigorously by chemical manufacturers. Toxics use reduction programs have been set up by legislation in some states, e.g., [[Massachusetts]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Oregon]]. The 3 R's represent the 'Waste Hierarchy' which lists the best ways of managing waste from the most to the least desirable. Many of the things we currently throw away could be reused again with just a little thought and imagination.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4523">A '''wetting transition''' (CassieâWenzel transition) may occur during the process of [[wetting]] of a solid (or liquid) surface with a liquid. The transition corresponds to a certain change in [[contact angle]], the macroscopic parameter characterizing wetting.&lt;ref name="deGennes2003"&gt;P.G. de Gennes, F. Brochard-Wyart, D. QuÃ©rÃ©, Capillarity and Wetting Phenomena, Springer, Berlin, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Various contact angles can co-exist on the same solid substrate. Wetting transitions may occur in a different way depending on whether the surface is flat or rough.

==Flat surfaces==
When a liquid drop is put onto a flat surface, two situations may result. If the contact angle is zero, the situation is referred to as complete wetting. If the contact angle is between 0 and 180Â°, the situation is called partial wetting. A wetting transition is a surface phase transition from partial wetting to complete wetting.&lt;ref name="Bonn2001"&gt;D. Bonn, D. Ross, Rep. Prog. Phys. 2001, 64, 1085-1183.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rough surfaces==
The situation on rough surfaces is much more complicated. The main characteristic of the wetting properties of rough surfaces is the so-called apparent contact angle (APCA). It is well known that the APCA usually measured are different from those predicted by the [[Wetting#Simplification to planar geometry, Young's relation|Young equation]]. Two main hypotheses were proposed in order to explain this discrepancy, namely the [[Wetting#Wenzel's model|Wenzel]] and [[Cassie's law|Cassie]] wetting models.&lt;ref name="Cassie1944"&gt;A. B. D. Cassie and S. Baxter, Trans. Faraday Soc., 1944, 40, 546â551.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cassie1948"&gt;A. B. D. Cassie, Discuss. Faraday Soc., 1948, 3, 11â16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wenzel1936"&gt;R. N. Wenzel, Ind. Eng. Chem., 1936, 28, 988â994.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the traditional Cassie model, air can remain trapped below the drop, forming "air pockets". Thus, the hydrophobicity of the surface is strengthened because the drop sits partially on air. On the other hand, according to the Wenzel model the roughness increases the area of a solid surface, which also geometrically modifies the wetting properties of this surface.&lt;ref name="deGennes2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cassie1944"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cassie1948"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wenzel1936"/&gt; Transition from Cassie to Wenzel regime is also called wetting transition.&lt;ref name="Lufama2003"&gt;A. Lafuma, D. QuÃ©rÃ©, Nat. Mater., 2003, 2, 457â460.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbieri2007"&gt;L. Barbieri, E. Wagner, P. Hoffmann, Langmuir, 2007, 23, 1723-1734.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang2008"&gt;J. Wang, D. Chen, Langmuir, 2008, 24, 10174-10180.&lt;/ref&gt; Under certain external stimuli, such as pressure or vibration, the Cassie air trapping wetting state could be converted into the Wenzel state.&lt;ref name="Lufama2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bormashenko2007a"&gt;E. Bormashenko, R. Pogreb, G. Whyman, Ye. Bormashenko, M. Erlich, Langmuir, 2007, 23, 6501â6503.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bormashenko2007b"&gt;E. Bormashenko, R. Pogreb, G. Whyman, Ye. Bormashenko, M. Erlich, Langmuir, 2007, 23, 12217â12221.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bormashenko2008"&gt;E. Bormashenko, R. Pogreb, T. Stein, G. Whyman, M. Erlich, A. Musin, V. Machavariani, D. Aurbach, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2008, 10, 4056â4061.&lt;/ref&gt; It is well accepted that the Cassie air trapping wetting regime corresponds to a higher energetic state, and the CassieâWenzel transition is irreversible.&lt;ref name="Marmur2006"&gt;A. Marmur, Soft Matter, 2006, 2, 12â17.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the mechanism of the transition remains unclear. It was suggested that the CassieâWenzel transition occurs via a nucleation mechanism starting from the drop center.&lt;ref name="Ishino2006"&gt;C. Ishino, K. Okumura, Europhys. Lett., 2006, 76(3), 464â470.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, recent experiments showed that the CassieâWenzel transition is more likely to be due to the displacement of a triple line under an external stimulus.&lt;ref name="Bormashenko2007a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bormashenko2007b"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bormashenko2008"/&gt; The existence of so-called impregnating Cassie wetting state also has to be considered.&lt;ref name="Bormashenko2008"/&gt;  Understanding wetting transitions is of a primary importance for design of [[superhydrophobic]] surfaces.&lt;ref name="QuÃ©rÃ©2008"&gt;D.

'''Xootr''' (pronounced "zoo-ter") is a manufacturer of folding [[kick scooter]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = FAQ | publisher = Xootr | url = http://www.xootr.com/xootr-kick-scooters-FAQ.html}},&lt;/ref&gt; and was formerly a seller of [[folding bicycle]]s.  Xootr scooters are characterized by 180&amp;nbsp;mm [[polyurethane]] wheels with [[aluminium]] hubs, and a hand brake for the front wheel (for the rear on old models).  Compared to the other folding scooters with smaller wheels, these larger wheels provide an easier ride, at the expense of a somewhat less easy portability.  The hinge is distinguished from competitors in being locked by inserting a pin, rather than by a cam or other latch.  The platform is large enough for adults, and available in plywood, magnesium, or aluminum at different prices.

Xootr scooters were originally introduced in 1999 by Nova Cruz Products. Since 2003, the Xootr scooter has been manufactured and sold by Xootr LLC.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = Business Week | url = http://images.businessweek.com/ss/09/07/0729_IDEA_best_of/6.htm | title = 50 Coolest Products of the 21st Century}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacturer==
The roots of Xootr go back to 1999, when Karl Ulrich, Nathan Ulrich, and Tom Miner (along with partners Lunar Design and Cheskin Research, and several other investors) founded Nova Cruz Products. Nova Cruz designed, manufactured and sold the Xootr kick scooter, the Xootr eX3 electric scooter, and the Voloci [[electric motorbike]].

The members of the Xootr LLC team have created products for many companies including [[Apple Computer]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], and [[Motorola]]. They now focus their energies on designing and manufacturing products they consider to be fun, socially, and environmentally friendly.

===Xootr Swift Bicycle (Discontinued)===
The [[Swift Folder]] is a [[folding bicycle]], designed by Peter Reich of Design Mobility Inc.  of [[Brooklyn]], New York, in collaboration with [[Jan VanderTuin]] of the [[Center for Appropriate Transport]] in [[Eugene, Oregon]]. The Swift Folder folds more quickly, though less compactly, than many other folding bicycles. From 2004&lt;ref name="story"&gt;http://www.swiftfolders.com/swift/Story.html&lt;/ref&gt; until about the end of 2016, the bicycle was sold under license by Xootr as the Xootr Swift - fully assembled to a standard specification, in a choice of single or 8-speed models&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Models - Swift Folding Bicycle (showing the beginning of the clearance at the end of 2016) | publisher = Xootr | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160831102650/http://www.xootr.com:80/swift-folding-bicycles-models.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bicycle Rack System===

The Xootr CrossRack Bicycle Rack enables the mounting of a standard bicycle bag to almost any bicycle especially on bicycles with small wheels.

===Hand trucks===

Xootr markets a line of folding [[hand truck]]s

===Clothing===
Xootr markets its own line of [[baseball cap]]s and [[tee-shirt]]s.

==Wheels==
Xootr wheels were originally sold in two styles: standard (translucent yellow) and ultra (black), with the ultra wheels having 10% lower rolling resistance. The wheels were very high in quality for the price and were used as a stock wheel for a number of gravity racing competitions.

Teams using Xootr wheels with a custom rubber formulation swept the top three places at the All-American [[Soap Box Derby]] Ultimate Speed championships in July 2008.[http://www.xootr.com/gallery_xootr-kick-scooters.html?pictureId=91][https://web.archive.org/web/20110723001055/http://aasbd.net/webdev/aasbd71/index.shtml]

==In popular culture==
The Xootr was featured in the film [[Little Manhattan]], where a Xootr Street serves as the primary means of transportation for the main character, Gabe. In one scene, one of his friends has a Xootr Ultra Cruz while another friend makes do with a [[Razor (scooter)|Razor]].
