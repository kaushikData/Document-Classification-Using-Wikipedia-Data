'''88 Greenwich Street''', also known as the '''Greenwich Club Residences''', and previously known as '''19 Rector Street''', is a building which takes up the full block on the south side of [[Rector Street (Manhattan)|Rector Street]] between [[Greenwich Street (Manhattan)|Greenwich Street]] and [[Washington Street (Manhattan)|Washington Street]] in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. Built in 1929-30, the 37-story building was designed by Lafayette A. Goldstone and Alexander Zamshnick in the [[Art Deco]] style.&lt;ref name=emporis&gt;{{Emporis|115234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

88 Greenwich Street was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2002.  The building was renovated into residential condominium use in 2006.&lt;ref name=emporis /&gt; In 2012, the building was affected by flooding from [[Hurricane Sandy]]. Three million cubic feet of salt water entered the basement of the building, causing significant damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff|url=http://therealdeal.com/2012/11/30/88-greenwich-target-of-lawsuit-set-to-reopen/ |title=88 Greenwich, target of lawsuit, set to reopen |newspaper=[[The Real Deal (magazine)|The Real Deal]] |date=November 30, 2012|accessdate=March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Polsky, Sara|url=http://ny.curbed.com/2012/11/2/10310600/88-greenwich-declared-unsafe-and-completely-uninhabitable |title=88 Greenwich Declared 'Unsafe' and Completely Uninhabitable |newspaper=[[Curbed|Curbed New York]] |date=November 2, 2012|accessdate=March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the flooding, water dislodged an oil tank which in turn hit a ceiling beam and cracked open. The breakage from the impact lead to an oil spill, which required a thorough cleaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Satow, Julie|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/realestate/post-sandy-the-generator-is-machine-of-the-moment.html?mtrref=undefined&amp;gwh=550131378D04E9182487E2429DE6327D&amp;gwt=pay |title=The Generator is the Machine of the Moment |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 11, 2013|accessdate=April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27784">A '''biosimilar''' (also known as '''follow-on biologic''' or '''subsequent entry biologic''') is a [[biopharmaceutical|biologic medical product]] that is almost an identical copy of an original product that is manufactured by a different company.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, A., Helene D'Iorio and Robert Ford. "What you need to know to succeed: Key trends in Canada's biotech industry " Insights, spring 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Biosimilars are officially approved versions of original "innovator" products and can be manufactured when the original product's [[chemical patent|patent]] expires.&lt;ref name="biosimilars2012" /&gt; Reference to the innovator product is an integral component of the approval.

Unlike with [[generic drug]]s of the more common [[small molecule|small-molecule]] type, biologics generally exhibit high molecular complexity and may be quite sensitive to changes in manufacturing processes. Despite that heterogeneity, all [[biopharmaceutical]]s, including biosimilars, must maintain consistent quality and clinical performance throughout their lifecycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lamanna|first=William C.|last2=Holzmann|first2=Johann|last3=Cohen|first3=Hillel P.|last4=Guo|first4=Xinghua|last5=Schweigler|first5=Monika|last6=Stangler|first6=Thomas|last7=Seidl|first7=Andreas|last8=Schiestl|first8=Martin|date=2018-01-10|title=Maintaining consistent quality and clinical performance of biopharmaceuticals|journal=Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy|volume=18|issue=4|pages=369–379|doi=10.1080/14712598.2018.1421169|issn=1744-7682|pmid=29285958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Follow-on manufacturers do not have access to the originator's molecular clone and original cell bank, to the exact fermentation and purification process, or to the active drug substance, but they have access to the commercialized innovator product. Overall, it is harder to ascertain [[fungibility]] between generics and innovators among biologics than it is among [[total synthesis|totally synthesized]] and [[semisynthesis|semisynthesized]] drugs. That is why the name "biosimilar" was coined to differentiate them from small-molecule generics. A simple analogy, often used to explain the difference, is to compare wine with soda pop. It is harder to say objectively that two bottles of [[wine]] from two wineries are "sufficiently interchangeable," because of differences in yeast [[strain (biology)|strain]], weather, and year of grape harvest, than it is to say that two bottles of soda pop of the same flavor coming from two bottling plants are "sufficiently interchangeable" because they contain the same flavoring powder.

Drug-related authorities such as the EU's [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA), the US's [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), and the [[Health Products and Food Branch]] of [[Health Canada]] hold their own guidance on requirements for demonstration of the similar nature of two biological products in terms of safety and efficacy. According to them, analytical studies demonstrate that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product, despite minor differences in clinically inactive components, animal studies (including the assessment of toxicity), and a clinical study or studies (including the assessment of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics). They are sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed and is intended to be used and for which licensure is sought for the biological product.

In case of a [[monoclonal antibody]]-containing medicinal product, such as [[Remsima]], extensive physicochemical and biological characterization for it and its reference product Remicade was conducted to demonstrate their highly-similar properties. Therefore, EMA has granted a marketing authorisation for only a few biosimilars since 2006, including a [[monoclonal antibody]], that was recently approved. Meanwhile, on March 6, 2015, the FDA approved the United States's first biosimilar product, the biosimilar of [[filgrastim]] called filgrastim-sndz (trade name Zarxio) by Sandoz.

==Approval processes ==
The European regulatory authorities led with a specially adapted approval procedure to authorize subsequent versions of previously approved biologics, termed "similar biological medicinal products", or biosimilars. This procedure is based on a thorough demonstration of "comparability" of the "similar" product to an existing approved product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/pages/includes/document/open_document.jsp?webContentId=WC500003517|title=EMEA Guideline on Similar Biological Medicinal Products, CHMP/437/04 London, 30 October 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) held that new legislation was required to enable them to approve biosimilars to those biologics originally approved through the PHS Act pathway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judiciary.senate.gov/testimony.cfm?id=1239&amp;wit_id=3623|title=US Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Testimony of Dr. Lester Crawford, Acting Commissioner, FDA June 23, 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additional Congressional hearings have been held.&lt;ref&gt;[http://energycommerce.house.gov/cmte_mtgs/110-he-hrg.050207.Biosimilar.shtml Hearing: Assessing the Impact of a Safe and Equitable Biosimilar Policy in the United States.

Since 2004 the FDA has held a series of public meetings on biosimilars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ScienceResearch/ResearchAreas/ucm085854.htm|title=FDA page on "Follow-On Protein Products: Regulatory and Scientific Issues Related to Developing"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/NewsEvents/ucm221688.htm|title=FDA page on "Approval Pathway for Biosimilar and Interchangeable Biological Products Public Meeting"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FDA gained the authority to approve biosimilars (including interchangeables that are substitutable with their reference product) as part of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] signed by President Obama on March 23, 2010.

The FDA has previously approved biologic products using comparability, for example, [[Omnitrope]] in May 2006, but this like [[Enoxaparin]] was also to a reference product, [[Genotropin]], originally approved as a [[biologic drug]] under the FD&amp;C Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/04P0231/04P-0231-pdn0001.pdf|title=FDA Response to three Citizen Petitions against biosimilars|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 6, 2015, [[Zarxio]] obtained the first approval of FDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm436648.htm|title=FDA page on "FDA approves first biosimilar product Zarxio"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sandoz’s Zarxio is biosimilar to Amgen’s Neupogen (filgrastim), which was originally licensed in 1991. This is the first product to be passed under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI Act), which was passed as part of the Affordable Healthcare Act. But Zarxio was approved as a biosimilar, not as an interchangeable product, the FDA notes. And under the BPCI Act, only a biologic that has been approved as an “interchangeable” may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product. The FDA said its approval of Zarxio is based on review of evidence that included structural and functional characterization, animal study data, human pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics data, clinical immunogenicity data and other clinical safety and effectiveness data that demonstrates [[Zarxio]] is biosimilar to Neupogen.

==Background==
Cloning of human genetic material and development of in vitro biological production systems has allowed the production of virtually any [[recombinant DNA]] based biological substance for eventual development of a drug. [[Monoclonal antibody]] technology combined with recombinant DNA technology has paved the way for tailor-made and targeted medicines. [[gene therapy|Gene-]] and [[cell therapy|cell-based]] therapies are emerging as new approaches.

Recombinant therapeutic [[proteins]] are of a complex nature (composed of a long chain of amino acids, modified amino acids, derivatized by sugar moieties, folded by complex mechanisms). These proteins are made in living cells (bacteria, yeast, animal or human cell lines). The ultimate characteristics of a drug containing a recombinant therapeutic protein are to a large part determined by the process through which they are produced: choice of the cell type, development of the genetically modified cell for production, production process,  purification process, formulation of the therapeutic protein into a drug.

After the expiry of the patent of approved recombinant drugs (e.g., [[insulin]],  human [[growth hormone]], [[interferons]], [[erythropoietin]], monoclonal antibodies and more) any other biotech company can develop and market these [[biologic medical product|biologics]] (thus called biosimilars).
Every biological (or biopharmaceutical products) displays a certain degree of variability, even between different batches of the same product, which is due to the inherent variability of the biological expression system and the manufacturing process.&lt;ref name="pmid25298038"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/early/2014/10/08/blood-2014-06-583617 | author = Martina Weise | title = Biosimilars: the science of extrapolation | journal = Blood |date=October 8, 2014 | pmid = 25298038 | doi=10.1182/blood-2014-06-583617 | volume=124 | issue = 22 | pages=3191–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any kind of reference product has undergone numerous changes in its manufacturing processes, and such changes in the manufacturing process (ranging from a change in the supplier of cell culture media to new purification methods or new manufacturing sites) was substantiated with appropriate data and was approved by the EMA. In contrast, it is mandatory for biosimilars to take a both non-clinical and clinical test that the most sensitive clinical models are asked to show to enable detection of differences between the two products in terms of human [[pharmacokinetics]] (PK) and [[pharmacodynamics]] (PD), efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity.

The current concept of development of biosimilar mAbs follows the principle that an extensive state of the art physicochemical, analytical and functional comparison of the molecules is complemented by comparative non-clinical and clinical data that establish equivalent efficacy and safety in a clinical "model" indication that is most sensitive to detect any minor differences (if these exist) between biosimilar and its reference mAb also at the clinical level.

The [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) has recognized this fact, which has resulted in the establishment of the term "biosimilar" in recognition that, whilst biosimilar products are similar to the original product, they are not exactly the same.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/human/biosimilar/043704en.pdf  EMEA  guideline on similar biological medicinal products] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630132050/http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/human/biosimilar/043704en.pdf |date=June 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Every biological displays a certain degree of variability. However, provided that structure and function(s), pharmacokinetic profiles and pharmacodynamic effect(s) and/or efficacy can be shown to be comparable for the biosimilar and the reference product, those adverse drug reactions which are related to exaggerated pharmacological effects can also be expected at similar frequencies.

Originally the complexity of biological molecules led to requests for substantial efficacy and safety data for a biosimilar approval. This has been progressively replaced with a greater dependence on assays, from quality through to clinical, that show assay sensitivity sufficient to detect any significant difference in dose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Warren|first=JB|title=Generics, chemisimilars and biosimilars: is clinical testing fit for purpose?|journal=Br J Clin Pharmacol|year=2013|volume=75|issue=1|pages=7–14|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.2012.04323.x|pmid=22574725|pmc=3555041}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the safe application of biologics depends on an informed and appropriate use by healthcare professionals and patients. Introduction of biosimilars also requires a specifically designed [[pharmacovigilance]] plan. It is difficult and costly to recreate biologics because the complex proteins are derived from living organisms that are genetically modified. In contrast, small molecule drugs made up of a chemically based compound can be easily replicated and are considerably less expensive to reproduce. In order to be released to the public, biosimilars must be shown to be as close to identical to the parent innovator biologic product based on data compiled through clinical, animal, analytical studies and conformational status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.bioprocessintl.com/manufacturing/biosimilars/higher-order-structure-comparability/|title = Higher-Order Structure Comparability: Case Studies of Biosimilar Monoclonal Antibodies|last = Wang|first = X.|date = June 1, 2014|journal = BioProcess International|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = |issue = 6|volume = 12|pages=32–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23286777"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Declerck PJ | title = Biosimilar monoclonal antibodies: a science-based regulatory challenge | journal = Expert Opin Biol Ther | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 153–6 |date=February 2013 | pmid = 23286777 | doi = 10.1517/14712598.2012.758710 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, once a drug is released in the market by FDA, it has to be re-evaluated for its safety and efficacy once every six months for the first and second years. Afterward, re-evaluations are conducted yearly, and the result of the assessment should be reported to authorities such as FDA. Biosimilars are required to undergo pharmacovigilance (PVG) regulations as its reference product. Thus biosimilars approved by EMEA (European Medicines Agency) are required to submit a risk management plan (RMP) along with the marketing application and have to provide regular safety update reports after the product is in the market. The RMP includes the safety profile of the drug and proposes the prospective pharmacovigilance studies.

Several PK studies, such as studies conducted by Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), have been conducted under various ranges of conditions; Antibodies from an originator’s product versus antibodies from an biosimilar; combination therapy and monotherapy; various diseases, etc. on the purpose to verify comparability in pharmacokinetics of the biosimilar with the reference medicinal product in a sufficiently sensitive and homogeneous population. Importantly, provided that structure and function(s), pharmacokinetic profiles and pharmacodynamic effect(s) and/or efficacy can be shown to be comparable for the biosimilar and the reference product, those adverse drug reactions which are related to exaggerated pharmacological effects can also be expected at similar frequencies.

==European approvals of biosimilars==
It has approved (in Jan 2016) [[Benepali]] a biosimilar to [[Enbrel]] (etanercept).&lt;ref name="bp-Pf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biopharma-reporter.com/Markets-Regulations/Pfizer-expects-major-biosimilar-impact-but-not-immediately/|title=Pfizer expects major biosimilar impact... but not immediately|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BPCI Act===
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI Act) was originally sponsored and introduced on June 26, 2007, by Senator [[Ted Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]] (D-MA).  It was formally passed under the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (PPAC Act), signed into law by President Barack Obama on March 23, 2010. The BPCI Act was an amendment to the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) to create an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are demonstrated to be highly similar (biosimilar) to a [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved biological product. The BPCI Act is similar, conceptually, to the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (also referred to as the "Hatch-Waxman Act") which created biological drug approval through the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFD&amp;C Act). The BPCI Act aligns with the FDA's longstanding policy of permitting appropriate reliance on what is already known about a drug, thereby saving time and resources and avoiding unnecessary duplication of human or animal testing. The FDA has released a total of four draft guidelines related to biosimilar or follow-on biologics development. Upon the release of the first three guidance documents the FDA held a public hearing on May 11, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Epstein|first1=MS|last2=Ehrenpreis|first2=ED|last3=Kulkarni|first3=PM|last4=FDA-Related Matters Committee of the American College of|first4=Gastroenterology|title=Biosimilars: the need, the challenge, the future: the FDA perspective.|journal=The American Journal of Gastroenterology|date=December 2014|volume=109|issue=12|pages=1856–9|pmid=24957160|url=http://gi.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FDA_Biosimilars_December_2014.pdf|doi=10.1038/ajg.2014.151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Data exclusivity ===
[[Data exclusivity]] is an important piece of the amendment in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act for biosimilars. It is the period of time between FDA approval and an abbreviated filing for a biosimilar on the original producer's data. Data exclusivity is designed to preserve innovation and recognize the long, costly, and risky process involved while the innovator waits to gain FDA approval. The time allowed for data exclusivity is critical for the future of biologics. A number of provisions for data exclusivity in recent legislative proposals ranged up to 14 years, however, the passing of the PPAC Act guarantees a 12-year time period from the time of FDA approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/262|title=42 U.S. Code § 262 - Regulation of biological products|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is supposed to compensate for perceived shortcomings in patent protection for biologics. Data exclusivity extends from the date of product approval, and this protection period runs concurrently with any remaining patent term protection for the biologic. That is to say, data exclusivity provides additional protection to the innovator when the remaining patent length is shorter than the data exclusivity period at the time of approval (which can occur due to lengthy pre-clinical and clinical research required to obtain FDA approval), or to the extent that the patent term is circumvented by a biosimilar prior to its expiry.

=== Nomenclature ===
The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the FDA have been working for years on the [[drug nomenclature#Nonproprietary names|nonproprietary naming]] of biosimilars. In August 2015, the FDA published a draft guideline on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Naming and Biological Products {{!}} FDA Voice|url = http://blogs.fda.gov/fdavoice/index.php/2015/08/naming-and-biological-products|website = blogs.fda.gov|accessdate = 2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In brief, the guideline calls for the assignment of a four character alphabetic suffix to the nonproprietary name of the original product to distinguish between innovator drugs and their biosimilars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Federal Register {{!}} Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products; Draft Guidance for Industry; Availability|url = https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/08/28/2015-21383/nonproprietary-naming-of-biological-products-draft-guidance-for-industry-availability|website = www.federalregister.gov|accessdate = 2015-08-29|date = 2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO INN system calls this suffix a biologic modifier.&lt;ref name="who_inn_bio"&gt;{{Citation |author=World Health Organization |authorlink=World Health Organization |title=INN and Biologicals |url=http://www.who.int/medicines/services/inn/inn_bio/en/ |accessdate=2016-08-05 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Market implications ==

The legal requirements of approval pathways, together with the costly manufacturing processes, escalates the developing costs for biosimilars that could be between $75–$250 million per molecule.&lt;ref name=biosimilars&gt;{{cite journal | author = Calo-Fernández B, Martínez-Hurtado J | title = Biosimilars: Company Strategies to Capture Value from the Biologics Market | journal = Pharmaceuticals |date=December 2012 | volume = 5 | issue = 12 | pages = 1393–1408 | doi = 10.3390/ph5121393 | pmid=24281342 | pmc=3816668}}&lt;/ref&gt; This market entry barrier affects not only the companies willing to produce them but could also delay availability of inexpensive alternatives for public healthcare institutions that subsidize treatment for their patients. Even though the biosimilars market is rising, the price drop for biological drugs at risk of patent expiration will not be as great as for other generic drugs; in fact it has been estimated that the price for biosimilar products will be 65%-85% of their originators.&lt;ref name=biosimilars /&gt; Biosimilars are drawing market's attention since there is an upcoming [[patent cliff]], which will put nearly 36% of the $140 billion market for biologic drugs at risk (as of 2011), this considering only the top 10 selling products.&lt;ref name=biosimilars /&gt;

The global biosimilars market was $1.3 billion in 2013 and is expected to reach $35 billion by 2020 driven by the patent expiration of additional ten blockbuster biologic drugs.&lt;ref name="urlBiosimilars and Follow-on-Biologics Market to Hit $35 Billion Globally by 2020 | Pharmaceutical Technology"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pharmtech.com/biosimilars-and-follow-biologics-market-hit-35-billion-globally-2020 | title = Biosimilars and Follow-on-Biologics Market to Hit $35 Billion Globally by 2020 | work = Pharmaceutical Technology | date = 28 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Sargent Shriver III''' (born April 28, 1954) is an activist, attorney, journalist, and a member of the extended [[Kennedy family]] living in [[Santa Monica, California]]. He was a member of the Santa Monica [[City Council]] from 2004 to 2012, serving as mayor pro tem in 2006 and as mayor during part of 2010. He is a nephew of former U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] and former Senators [[Robert F. Kennedy|Robert F. "Bobby" Kennedy]] and [[Ted Kennedy|Edward M. "Ted" Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.santa-monica.org/departments/council/content.aspx?id=2391] Santa Monica City Council Electoral History&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smdp.com/pdf/120910.pdf ''Santa Monica Daily Press'']{{dead link|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Shriver was born in Chicago, Illinois, to [[Sargent Shriver]] (1915—2011) and [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver]] (1921—2009), the first of their five children. His siblings are, [[Maria Shriver|Maria]] (born 1955), [[Timothy Shriver|Timothy]] (born 1959), [[Mark Shriver|Mark]] (born 1964) and [[Anthony Shriver|Anthony]] (born 1965).

Bobby attended [[Yale College]] at [[Yale University]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], where he was a member of [[Scroll and Key|the Scroll and Key Society]]. He graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[American studies]] with ''[[cum laude]]'' honors. He graduated from [[Yale Law School]] with a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] in 1981.

== Business career and philanthropy ==
After graduating from law school, Shriver [[law clerk|clerked]] for a year for [[Judge]] [[Stephen R. Reinhardt]] at the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]], which is headquartered in San Francisco, California.

He then moved to New York City to work in a [[venture capital]] business at James D. Wolfensohn, Inc.

Along with father Sarge, [[Eli Jacobs]], and [[Larry Lucchino]], Bobby was an investor from 1989 to 1993 in the [[Baltimore Orioles]], a [[professional baseball|professional-baseball team]] based in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Mark (December 7, 1988). "Orioles are sold: $70&amp;nbsp;million; Buyers say team will stay". ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shriver is an [[Lawyer|attorney]].  He is also president of RSS Inc., a [[Beverly Hills, California]] [[music]], [[film]] and [[philanthropy|philanthropic]] company. (The letters RSS are Shriver's initials.)

In 1987, he produced a prime-time television feature about the [[Special Olympics]], an organization for disabled young people and founded by his mother in 1968. This and subsequent productions have raised in excess of [[United States dollar|US$]]55&amp;nbsp;million{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} for the Special Olympics program.

He has also produced several films, including ''[[True Lies]]'' (1994), which starred  [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] – whose ex-wife is Shriver's sister, [[Maria Shriver]].

In 2002, Shriver was a co-founder – with [[U2]] lead singer [[Bono]] – of [[DATA]] (Debt, AIDS, Trade in Africa), a [[multinational corporation|multinational]], [[Non-governmental organization|non-government organization]] whose purpose is to obtain [[social equality]] and [[justice]] for [[Africa]] through [[debt relief]]; adjust [[trade]] rules which burden Africa; eliminate the [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|African AIDS]] epidemic; and strengthen [[democracy]] with more [[accountability]] by the wealthiest nations and African leaders with [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]] towards the people.

With Shriver's involvement, DATA, in turn, was one of the founding organizations in 2004 of the [[ONE Campaign]], a U.S.-based, [[nonpartisan|non-partisan]], [[non-profit organization]] which aims to increase [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] funding for and effectiveness of [[aid|international-aid]] programs.

In 2006, he and Bono also co-founded, and Shriver is chief executive officer of, [[Product Red|(Product) Red]], a brand-licensing company, to raise money for [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]]. The company licenses its "(Product) Red" [[logo]] to partner companies in return for the opportunity to increase their own [[revenue]] through the "(Product) Red" products that they sell.

== Political career ==

===California State Parks and Recreation Commission===

After Schwarzenegger became the [[Governor of California]] in 2004, he reappointed Shriver as [[chairman]] of the [[California Department of Parks and Recreation|California State Park and Recreation Commission]] overseeing the state's parks and gardens. He had first been appointed by prior California Governor [[Gray Davis]].

In 2005, Shriver, the commission chairman, and [[Clint Eastwood]], the commission vice chairman, led a commission panel in its unanimous opposition to a six-lane, {{convert|16|mi|km|adj=on}} [[toll road]] that would cut through [[San Onofre State Beach]] (north of [[San Diego]]) that includes [[Trestles]], a collection of [[surfing]] spots – one of [[Southern California]]'s most-cherished.  Shriver and Eastwood also supported a 2006 [[lawsuit]] to block the toll road and urged the [[California Coastal Commission]] to reject the project, which it did in February 2008.&lt;ref name=YoungS-AP&gt;Young, Samantha. - [http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/state/20080320-1635-schwarzenegger-parks.html "Schwarzenegger removes his brother-in-law and Clint Eastwood from Calif. parks panel"] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5uumanMoa?url=http://legacy.signonsandiego.com/news/state/20080320-1635-schwarzenegger-parks.html |date=December 12, 2010 }}. ''[[Associated Press|The Associated Press]]'' (via ''[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]''). March 20, 2008. Accessed May 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008, Shriver and Eastwood, whose terms had expired, were not reappointed.&lt;ref name=YoungS-AP/&gt; The [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] (NRDC) asked for a legislative investigation into the decision not to re-appoint Shriver and Eastwood, citing their opposition to the toll-road extension.&lt;ref name=SDUT-2008-03-22&gt;Staff writer (March 22, 2008).[http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/state/20080322-1416-ca-schwarzenegger-parkscommission.html "Group wants probe into governor's removal of Eastwood, Shriver"] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5uumlK7Ky?url=http://legacy.signonsandiego.com/news/state/20080322-1416-ca-schwarzenegger-parkscommission.html |date=December 12, 2010 }}.

Schwarzenegger's [[news release|press release]] appointing Alice Huffman and [[Lindy DeKoven]] to replace Shriver and Eastwood makes no mention of a reason for the commission change.&lt;ref name=OftG-SofC-9715&gt;Press Release: Press release (May 23, 2008).

===Santa Monica City Council===
In November 2004 Shriver ran for, and was elected to, a seat on the Santa Monica City Council. He stated that he decided to run for the seat after a dispute with the city over the height of the [[hedge]]s at his home.&lt;ref name="hedge"&gt;

He ran for re-election in 2008, again in a race in which thirteen candidates were running for four open seats.  He again received the most votes, although he won by a smaller margin over the candidate receiving the second-most number of votes.  Shriver received 24,298 votes, or 18.56 percent of the vote. The other three winning candidates received 20,232, 19,145, and 17,202 votes. Shriver's second term ended November 2012.&lt;ref name="2008resultslwv"&gt;

== By Industry ==

=== E-commerce and Technology ===
Corporate censorship in the E-commerce and technology industry is usually the explicit or implicit ban or suppression of certain material by a tech company from the product it offers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.inc.com/peter-gasca/tech-companies-and-censorship-where-should-we-draw.html|title=Tech Companies and Censorship: Where Should We Draw The Line?|date=2017-08-19|work=Inc.com|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in 2018, [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] reported that Google and Amazon are involved in a case of Russian censorship of a Russian company called [[Telegram (service)|Telegram]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-05-03/telegram-block-gets-help-from-google-and-amazon|title=Russian Censor Gets Help From Amazon and Google|last=|first=|date=2018-11-08|website=Bloomberg|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Russian intelligence [[Federal Security Service|Federal Security Service (FSB)]] attempted to gain access to and found terrorist messages on Telegram, a messenger service in Russia with 15 million users, the app was banned by a Moscow court.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In April 2018, Apple, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft were thanked by Telegram's founder for "not taking part in political censorship."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is said that Google and Amazon were thanked because they were possibly engaged in [[domain fronting]], a technique that circumvents Internet censorship.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, things later changed as Google and Amazon disabled domain fronting and helped in the Russian censors' endeavor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Art and Music ===
Corporate censorship in the music industry involves the censorship of musicians' artistic works by the refusal to market or to distribute them. One example given by Jay is that of [[Ice-T]] altering the lyrics of "[[Cop Killer (song)|Cop Killer]]" as a result of the pressure applied to [[Time Warner]] by [[William Bennett]] along with various religious and advocacy groups.&lt;ref name="Jay" /&gt;

The 2012 [[PEN World Voices]] Festival focused on corporate censorship in the publishing industry with [[Salman Rushdie]], author of "Satanic Verses", tackling censorship as "anti-creation". [[Giannina Braschi]], author of "United States of Banana", offered a critique of 21st century [[capitalism]] in which she condemned corporate censorship as financial control.

DeeDee Halleck&lt;ref name="Halleck2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Hand-Held Visions: Uses of Community Media|author=DeeDee Halleck|publisher=Fordham Univ Press|year=2002|isbn=0823221016|page=135|chapter=Smashing the myths of the information industry: Creating alternatives}}&lt;/ref&gt; opines that describing the corporate censorship of independent artists, which she notes is often less overt in form, as self-censorship "smacks of [[blaming the victim]]." She describes such self-censorship as being simply a survival stratagem, the tailoring of an artist's choices to what is acceptable to those in power, based upon widespread knowledge of the acceptable themes and formats at institutions such as (her examples) the [[Public Broadcasting Service]], the [[Whitney Biennial]], the [[Museum of Modern Art]], the Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibits gallery, or the Boston Institute of Contemporary Art.

=== Journalism, Media, and Entertainment ===
Croteau and Hoynes&lt;ref name="TBoM2"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Business of Media: Corporate Media and the Public Interest|author1=David Croteau|author2=William Hoynes|publisher=Pine Forge Press|year=2006|isbn=1412913152|pages=169&amp;ndash;184}}&lt;/ref&gt; discuss corporate censorship in the news publishing business, observing that it can occur as [[self-censorship]]. They note that it is "virtually impossible to document", because it is covert.  [[Jonathan Alter]] states that "In a tight job market, the tendency is to avoid getting yourself or your boss in trouble. So an adjective gets dropped, a story skipped, a punch pulled … It's like that [[Sherlock Holmes]] story&amp;nbsp;– the dog that didn't bark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Adventure of Silver Blaze]]|author=[[Arthur Conan Doyle]]|year=1892|series=[[The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Those clues are hard to find."  The head of the [[Media Access Project]] notes that such self-censorship is not misreporting or false reporting, but simply ''not'' reporting at all. Self-censorship is not the product of "dramatic conspiracies", according to Croteau and Hoynes, but simply the interaction of many small daily decisions.  Journalists want to keep their jobs and editors support the interests of the company.  These many small actions and non-actions accumulate to produce (in their words) "homogenized, corporate-friendly media".

Nichols and McChesney&lt;ref name="OMNT2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Our Media, Not Theirs: The Democratic Struggle Against Corporate Media|author1=John Nichols|author2=Robert Waterman McChesney|publisher=Seven Stories Press|year=2002|isbn=1583225498|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; opine that "the maniacal media baron as portrayed in [[James Bond]] films or profiles of [[Rupert Murdoch]] is far less a danger than the cautious and compromised editor who seeks to 'balance' a responsibility to readers or viewers with a duty to serve his boss and the advertisers".  They state that "even among journalists who entered the field for the noblest of reasons" there is a tendency to avoid any controversial journalism that might embroil the news company in a battle with a powerful corporation or a government agency.  They observe that although such conflicts "have always been the stuff of great journalism" they are "very bad business", and that "in the current climate business trumps journalism just about every time".

Croteau and Hoynes&lt;ref name="TBoM2" /&gt; report that such corporate censorship in journalism is commonplace, reporting the results of studies revealing that more than 40%&lt;ref&gt;[http://people-press.org/report/39/ Self Censorship: How Often and Why]&lt;/ref&gt; of journalists and news executives stating that they had deliberately engaged in such censorship by avoiding newsworthy stories or softening the tones of stories.  More than a third of the respondents stated that news organizations would ignore news that might hurt their financial interests.  A similar fraction stated that they self-censored in order to further, or not endanger, their careers.

==== Specific case: Westway project ====
Halleck&lt;ref name="Halleck2" /&gt; states that journalists are well aware of where self-censorship is required, and what they have to say or not say in their stories in order to keep their jobs.  She gives [[Sydney Schanberg]] as an example. A high-profile, [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning journalist Schanberg breached corporate censorship when reporting on corruption in [[New York City]] with regards to the [[West Side Highway|Westway]] project.  In Schanberg's column in ''The New York Times'' he asked why the ''Times'' was not investigating the issues, and was subsequently laid off.  Halleck notes that the negative feedback that enforces corporate censorship is usually not as well documented as in the case of Schanberg, nor as clear-cut.  Corporations may change the assignments of problem journalists, accept fewer stories from them, downgrade their office space, or deny them raises.

Self-censorship is not the only form of corporate censorship in the news and entertainment businesses.  Croteau and Hoynes&lt;ref name="TBoM2" /&gt; also describe managers censoring their employees, subdivisions of conglomerates applying pressure upon one another, and pressure applied upon corporations by external entities such as advertisers.  They note that many incidents of corporate censorship are "unlikely to become public", but give the following (and several other) case studies of incidents of corporate censorship that have become part of the public record:

* The decision by the [[Walt Disney Company]] to prevent [[Miramax]] from releasing ''[[Fahrenheit 911]]'' in 2004.  (See [[Fahrenheit 9/11 controversy]].)  Croteau and Hoynes observe that this was a business decision, and state that "even when such business decisions are not politically motivated, then can have substantial political consequences".
* The decision in 1998 by [[Harper Collins]] to drop plans for publishing ''East and West'', the memoirs of [[Chris Patten]], out of concern it might effect the relationship between [[STAR TV (Asia)|Star TV]] and the Chinese government.  (Milner, who also cites this decision as an example, places them both alongside the decision by Harper Collins not to publicize [[Michael Moore]]'s ''[[Stupid White Men]]'' and observes that Patten, as a member of the U.K. [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], demonstrates corporate censorship is not confined to left-wing writers such as Moore.)&lt;ref name="Milner2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Literature, Culture And Society|author=Andrew Milner|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=0415307856|pages=154&amp;ndash;155}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The removal of a cartoon clip from a March 1998 edition of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' that satirized the [[concentration of media ownership]], the song accompanying which stated that "Disney, Fox, Westinghouse, and good ol' GE" own "networks from CBS to CNBC" and "can use them to say whatever they please and put down the opinions of anyone who disagrees".  Croteau and Hoynes observe that this satirical treatment of corporate censorship was ''itself'' subject to that very same censorship.  The clip was removed from the program for all subsequent repeats.  They note that the executive producer of ''SNL'' stated that he didn't think that the cartoon "worked comedically", but also note that others at NBC told reporters that the president of NBC and officials of [[General Electric]], owner of NBC, "had been upset".

An example given by Henry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Carnival: Journalism Under Siege in an Age of New Media|last=Henry|first=Neil|publisher=University of California Press|year=2007|isbn=0520243420|pages=107&amp;ndash;108|authorlink=Neil Henry (journalist)}}&lt;/ref&gt; of censorship by a corporation rather than by a government is the censorship in May 2004 by The Sinclair Broadcasting Group of an issue of [[ABC News]]' ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]'' entitled "The Fallen" wherein [[Ted Koppel]] recited the names and showed the faces of all Americans killed in action in Iraq.  Sinclair, a strong proponent of the U.S. actions in Iraq, prohibited the six ABC affiliates that it owned from broadcasting the show, on the grounds that the program was "motivated by a political agenda designed to undermine the efforts of the United States in Iraq". (See [[Sinclair Broadcast Group#Nightline controversy]] and [[Nightline (U.S. news program)|Nightline#Reading of the names]].)

Milner&lt;ref name="Milner2" /&gt; also notes, in addition, the [[List of "songs with questionable lyrics" following the September 11, 2001 attacks|list of songs]] circulated by Clear Channel Communications, and the 2003 ban on the Dixie Chicks (see [[Clear Channel Communications#September 11.2C 2001]] and [[Dixie Chicks#Political controversy]]), stating his inference that "these relatively public actions are merely the tip of a veritable iceberg of corporate censorship", and arguing that publishers are "by no means passive conduits for the transmission of cultural products from producers to consumers" but are influenced to take an active rôle in that transmission by motives of profit, ideology, values, or even reasons of state.

Major corporations such as Wal-Mart are also responsible for such acts. They refuse to sell musical CD produced by artists which contain parental advisory stickers on them to their customers.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Because of this, artists who want to reach out to Wal-Mart customers with their music need to change and edit their songs without any profanity in order for them to be put on shelves.

==== Media conglomeration ====
One of the incidents of corporate censorship that Croteau and Hoynes find to be "the most disturbing" in their view&lt;ref name="TBoM2" /&gt; is the news reporting in the U.S. of the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]], which made fundamental changes to the limitations on ownership of [[Media conglomerate|media conglomerates]] within the U.S. and which was heavily lobbied for by media interests, and yet which was subject to, in Croteau and Hoynes words, "remarkably little coverage" by U.S. news media.  They report one study that found that in the nine months between the introduction of the bill into Congress and its passage in February 1996, there were only 12 major stories, comprising 19.5 minutes of air time, about the Act on the three major U.S. television networks, with much of this coverage focussing upon television content ratings and the [[V-chip]] and "largely ignor[ing]" the major changes to the media ownership rules.  Croteau and Hoynes observe that history repeated itself with the 2003 review by the FCC of the media ownership rules, with a study by ''American Journalism Review'' concluding that the plan to alter the ownership regulations in favour of "a handful of large companies" was "barely mentioned" by most newspapers and broadcast outlets that were owned by those companies.

Croteau and Hoynes&lt;ref name="TBoM2" /&gt; state that this "inadequate" coverage of the legislation and FCC actions suggests a built-in [[conflict of interest]] for news media&amp;nbsp;– one that is not just limited to television and radio news media, given that many newspapers are also owned by the same corporations that own the television and radio stations.  Reporting fully the views of critics of the legislation would have been counter to the economic interests of the news media companies which benefited directly from the legislation, lobbied in its favour, and even helped to draft it.  This conflict of interest was observed by [[John McCain]] during debate of the Telecommunications Act in the U.S. Senate, who stated that "You will not see this story on any television or hear it on any radio broadcast because it directly affects them."  Sohn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Regulators' Revenge: The Future of Telecommunications Deregulation|author=Gigi B. Sohn|publisher=Cato Institute|year=1998|isbn=188257768X|editor1=Tom W. Bell|pages=129&amp;ndash;130|chapter=Why Government is the Solution, not the Problem: In pursuit of a free market for telecommunications services|editor2=Solveig Singleton}}&lt;/ref&gt; similarly observed, in a 1998 critique of the deregulation by the Telecommunications Act, that increased concentration of media ownership "often leads to a type of corporate censorship by which information affecting the large media company's economic interest is kept from the public's eyes and ears".

Nichols and McChesney&lt;ref name="OMNT2" /&gt; similarly observe that the exclusion of [[Ralph Nader]] from the three [[United States presidential election debates|presidential debates]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential race]] by television networks guaranteed that the debates would not address controversial issues of media conglomeration.  They note with irony that this was seemingly against the self-interests of the television stations, since it served to also reduce public interest in the televised presidential debates by rendering them, in their view, "duller than dirt agreeathons" that viewers would not be interested in watching.

== Notable Cases ==

=== Amazon ===
[[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], as one of the largest [[e-commerce]] businesses in the [[United States]], has been involved in controversies that point to its censorship-like actions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/29/amazon-pulls-macmillan-books-over-e-book-price-disagreement/|title=Amazon Pulls Macmillan Books Over E-Book Price Disagreement|last=Stone|first=Brad|work=Bits Blog|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, [[Macmillan Publishers]], along with some other publishers, asked Amazon to increase the prices of the electronic books it offered for sale on Amazon by 50% from $9.99 to $15,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; after obtaining permission from [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] to raise its prices, who was more lenient in allowing the publishers to determine prices themselves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Amazon disagreed with its proposal, and they didn't reach a consensus on how to deal with this problem. Amazon later removed all books published by Macmillan Publishers, including electronic books and physical books, from the website.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Later, Amazon "surrendered" to Macmillan Publishers' request of price increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/01/technology/companies/01amazonweb.html|title=Amazon Accepts Macmillan’s Demand for Higher E-Book Prices|last=Stone|first=Motoko Rich and Brad|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amazon has also engaged in activities where it censored customers' negative reviews. For example, in 2012, authors [[J. A. Konrath|Joe Konrath]] and [[Steve Weddle]] reported that Amazon deleted their reviews in response to a wave of "[[Sockpuppet (Internet)|sock puppet]]" controversies.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/nov/05/amazon-removes-book-reviews|title=Amazon removes book reviews by fellow authors|last=Flood|first=Alison|date=2012-11-05|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the scandal, many authors used anonymous accounts on Amazon to provide positive reviews for their own books and negative reviews for the competitors' work, on grounds not of quality but of who wrote the books.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Amazon sought to rectify this problem by prohibiting authors from publishing reviews about other writers' works.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 2013, a British website the Kernel published an article accusing Amazon, [[Kobo Inc.|Kobo]], and other e-book retailers of containing books with erotic material such as "rape, incest, and 'forced sex' with young girls."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-pornographic-self-published-ebooks-trouble-for-amazon-and-kobo-20131016-story.html|title=Self-published pornographic e-books cause trouble for Amazon, Kobo|last=Kellogg|first=By Carolyn|website=latimes.com|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It turned out that these were books written by self-published writers who wrote erotica books.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/oct/17/entertainment/la-et-jc-self-published-erotica-writers-strike-back-20131017|title=Self-published erotica writers strike back|last=Tobar|first=Hector|date=2013-10-17|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-11-18|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amazon responded to the Kernel's article by removing books under the categories mentioned in the article, including books depicting rape, incest, and child pornography.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In response, some self-published writers engaged in a protest against Amazon's censorship, which had implicated some books that did not include erotic material as offensive as what Amazon should be and was targeting.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/retailing/article/59576-indie-authors-launch-petition-reacting-to-retailers-censorship.html|title=Indie Authors Launch Petition Reacting to Retailers' Censorship|work=PublishersWeekly.com|access-date=2018-11-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, in an effort to exert more control on online pricing, Amazon banned preorders of ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' in disk form''.''&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-amazon-disney-20140811-story.html|title=Amazon takes on Disney in DVD pricing fight|last=News|first=Bloomberg|website=latimes.com|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a continuation of similar strategies that Amazon once used with book publisher [[Hachette Books|Hachette]] and film studio [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Because the movie studios needed the sales profits from DVDs and blue-rays while Amazon could afford losing one customer, Amazon used this technique to add pressure on [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Co.]] for more pricing power.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Google ===
One of the censorship practices [[Google]] is involved in is the censorship of information on Google China.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/cs201/projects/2010-11/FreeExpressionVsSocialCohesion/google_policy.html|title=Google Censorship|website=cs.stanford.edu|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Google's service was disabled in China, it complied with China's Internet policies and removed some content not appropriate to appear in the Chinese context.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Google was criticized for violating its principle of promoting "a generally open Internet."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Google's [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] at the time, [[Eric Schmidt]], affirmed Google's commitment to this, and also mentioned that complying with China's regulations was better than not being present the Chinese market at all.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In January 2010, Google made an announcement that it wouldn't engage in further censoring activities.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In September 2010, Google launched Google Transparency to share information about governments' and corporations' activities regarding information access and control.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://transparencyreport.google.com/?hl=en|title=Google Transparency Report|website=transparencyreport.google.com|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are increasing incidences across the world that involve censorship in Google, banning information from the general population.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[Google Maps]]' [[Google Street View|Street View]], for example, does not cover military bases in the U.S. out of security concerns.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The [[European Union]] also suggested that the Street View violates EU privacy laws.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] is a site in which people frequently publish information on their political stances or engage in political and social debates.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aclu.org/blog/free-speech/internet-speech/facebook-shouldnt-censor-offensive-speech|title=Facebook Shouldn't Censor Offensive Speech|work=American Civil Liberties Union|access-date=2018-11-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2009, Facebook has been supporting the rights of Holocaust deniers on posting on its website.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/18/17587080/mark-zuckerberg-holocaust-denial-kara-swisher-interview|title=Mark Zuckerberg says Holocaust deniers are making an honest mistake|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, however, Facebook announced a new policy that it will remove "misinformation that contributes to violence&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;," while not enforcing a complete censor on those speeches.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's CEO, said that there are certain information people post because they took it wrong, but perhaps not because they intentionally took it wrong.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Even if they did it on purpose, Facebook couldn't have found out their intentions and wouldn't try to do so.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Thus, they are reviewing information on Facebook and taking down misrepresented, misleading, or offensive information, but not outright censoring information in certain categories, such as Holocaust denial.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; As a result of this policy, posts that falsely report on Muslims and Buddhists in Sri Lanka were removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/18/17588624/facebook-misinformation-removal-violence-hate-speech-sri-lanka|title=Facebook says it will begin removing misinformation that leads to violence|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Facebook removed hundreds of pages related to U.S. politics on grounds of "inauthentic activity" one month before the [[Midterm election|midterm elections]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/11/facebook-purge-page-removal-spam|title=Facebook removes hundreds of US political pages for 'inauthentic activity'|last=Tynan|first=Dan|date=2018-10-11|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook representatives claimed that the posts and user accounts were deleted not because of the content of the posts, but because they violated Facebook's terms of service.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Debates ==
===TV Guide debate ===
In 1969, [[Nicholas Johnson]], United States [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) commissioner, and then president of [[CBS News]] [[Richard Salant]], debated the scope and existence of corporate censorship in a series of articles published in ''[[TV Guide]]''.

==== Johnson ====
Johnson's view, put forward in an article entitled ''The Silent Screen''&lt;ref name="Johnson2"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Silent Screen|author=[[Nicholas Johnson]]|date=1969-07-05|work=[[TV Guide]]}}&amp;nbsp;– reprinted and augmented in {{cite book|title=How to Talk Back to Your Television Set|author=Nicholas Johnson|publisher=Bantam Books|year=1970|location=New York|pages=71&amp;ndash;88}}&lt;/ref&gt; is that "Censorship is a serious problem" in the United States, and that he agrees with the statements by various network officials that television is subject to it, but disputes "just who is doing most of the censoring".   He states that most television censorship is corporate censorship, not government censorship.  One of the several examples that he gives in support of this argument is that of [[WBAI]] in [[New York City]], which the FCC declined to censure for the publication a poem that was alleged to be anti-Semitic.  He argues that "[m]any broadcasters are fighting, not for [[free speech]], but for profitable speech. In the WBAI case, for example, one of the industry's leading spokesmen, ''Broadcasting'' magazine, actually urged that WBAI be punished by the FCC&amp;nbsp;– and on the same editorial page professed outrage that stations might not have an unlimited right to broadcast profitable commercials for cigarettes which may result in illness or death."

Johnson&lt;ref name="Johnson2" /&gt; quotes examples of corporate censorship reported by Stan Opotowsky in ''TV &amp;nbsp;– The Big Picture'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=TV: the Big Picture|author=Stan Opotowsky|publisher=EP Dutton and Co. Inc.|year=1961|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] deleted a shot [of] the New York skyline because it showed the [[Chrysler]] building [...] A breakfast-food sponsor deleted the line 'She eats too much' from a play because, as far as the breakfast-food company was concerned, nobody could ever eat too much."  He quotes Bryce Rucker writing in ''The First Freedom''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The First Freedom|author=Bryce W. Rucker|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; that "Networks generally have underplayed or ignored events and statements unfavorable to food processors and soap manufacturers".  He notes that "corporate tampering with the product of honest and capable journalists and creative writers and performers can be quite serious".  He points to a 3 September 1969 report by ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' that [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] "had tailored some of its documentaries to fit the corporate desires of Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Company", and cites examples given by Bill Greeley in a 4 February 1970 ''Variety'' article of "shrunken or vanished" documentaries at CBS, which have been "shelved, turned down, or killed".

He also gives several examples of television network officials who have resigned over issues of corporate censorship: Fred Friendly resigning from CBS News because on 10 February 1966 it did not televise the Senate hearings on the [[Vietnam war]]; the head of the [[National Association of Broadcasters]] Code Authority resigning "in disgust over the hypocrisy exhibited by the NAB's stand on cigarette advertisements".&lt;ref name="Johnson2" /&gt;

He points out several commonalities in a long list of incidents that he cites:&lt;ref name="Johnson2" /&gt;

* the involvement of human death, disease, dismemberment, or degradation;
* the existence of great profit for manufacturers, advertisers, and broadcasters; and
* the deliberate withholding of needed information from the public.

Johnson&lt;ref name="Johnson2" /&gt; states that "many pressures produce such censorship", some deliberate and some by default, but that "all have come, not from government, but from private corporations with something to sell".  He notes an exchange in the letters page of ''[[The New York Times]]'' between Charles Tower, chairman of the National Association of Broadcasters Television Board and a reader, with Tower saying "There is a world of difference between the deletion of program material by Government command and the deletion by a private party [such as a broad-caster] [...] Deletion by Government command is censorship [...] Deletion of material by private parties [...] is not censorship." but his respondent rebutting this with "Mr. Tower's distinction [...] is spurious. The essence of censorship is the suppression of a particular point of view [...] over the channels of the mass media, and the question of who does the censoring is one of form only."  Johnson concurs with the latter view, stating that the outcome is the same.

==== Salant ====
Salant's view, put forward in an article entitled ''He Has Exercised His Right&amp;nbsp;– To Be Wrong''&lt;ref name="Salant2"&gt;{{cite news|title=He Has Exercised His Right&amp;nbsp;– To Be Wrong|author=Richard Salant|date=1969-09-20|work=[[TV Guide]]|pages=10&amp;ndash;19}}&lt;/ref&gt; was that Johnson was "totally completely, 100 percent wrong&amp;nbsp;– on all counts", providing many examples of CBS' coverage of the things enumerated by Johnson, saying, "In the 11 years I was a CBS corporate officer and in the six years that I have been president of CBS News, to my knowledge there is no issue, no topic, no story which CBS News has ever been forbidden, or instructed directly or indirectly, to cover or not to cover, by corporate management."

The [[constitutional]] and other [[legal]] protections that prohibit or limit government censorship of the Internet in some countries do not generally apply to [[private corporation]]s. Corporations may voluntarily choose to limit the content they make available or allow others to make available on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.wustl.edu/Journal/21/p31PalfreyRogoyski.pdf "The Move to the Middle: The Enduring Threat of 'Harmful' Speech to the End-to-End Principle"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314122135/http://law.wustl.edu/Journal/21/p31PalfreyRogoyski.pdf |date=2012-03-14 }}, John Palfrey, Jr. and Robert Rogoyski, Washington University Journal of Law and Policy, vol. 21 (2006), pp.31–65&lt;/ref&gt; Or corporations may be encouraged by government pressure or required by law or [[court order]] to remove or limit Internet access to content that is judged to be [[obscene]] (including [[child pornography]]), harmful to children, [[defamatory]], pose a threat to [[national security]], promote illegal activities such as [[gambling]], [[prostitution]], theft of [[intellectual property]], [[hate speech]], and [[inciting]] [[violence]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1143582&amp;rec=1&amp;srcabs=1026597# "Cybersieves"], Derek E.

Corporations that provide Internet access for their employees, customers, students, or members will sometimes limit this access in an attempt to ensure it is used only for the purposes of the corporation. This can include [[content-control software]] to limit access to entertainment content in business and educational settings and limiting high-[[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] services in settings where bandwidth is at a premium. Some institutions also block outside [[e-mail]] services as a precaution, usually initiated out of concerns for local network security or concerns that e-mail might be used intentionally or unintentionally to allow trade secrets or other confidential information to escape.

Some websites that allow user-contributed content may practice [[self-censorship]] by adopting policies on how the web site may be used and by banning or requiring pre-approval of editorial contributions from users that do not follow the policies for the site.
 
In 2007, [[Verizon]] attempted to block the [[abortion]] rights group [[NARAL Pro-Choice America]] from using their text messaging services to speak to their supporters. Verizon claims it was in order to enforce a policy that doesn't allow their customers to use their service to communicate "controversial" or "unsavory" messages.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/27/us/27verizon.html Verizon Blocks Messages of Abortion Rights Group], Adam Liptak, ''The New York Times'', 27 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Comcast, AT&amp;T and many other ISP's have also been accused of regulating internet traffic and bandwidth.

In February 2008, the ''[[Bank Julius Baer v. WikiLeaks]]'' lawsuit prompted the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]] to issue a permanent injunction against the website [[WikiLeaks]]' [[domain name registrar]]. The result was that WikiLeaks could not be accessed through its [[web address]]. This elicited accusations of censorship and resulted in the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] stepping up to defend Wikileaks. After a later hearing, the injunction was lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/cases/bank-julius-baer-co-v-wikileaks|title=Bank Julius Baer &amp; Co v.

On 1 December 2010 [[Amazon.com]] cut off WikiLeaks 24 hours after being contacted by the staff of [[Joe Lieberman]], Chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs|U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/dec/01/wikileaks-website-cables-servers-amazon "WikiLeaks website pulled by Amazon after US political pressure"], Ewen MacAskill, The Guardian, 2 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement Lieberman said:&lt;ref&gt;[http://lieberman.senate.gov/index.cfm/news-events/news/2010/12/amazon-severs-ties-with-wikileaks "Amazon Severs Ties with Wikileaks"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204094146/http://lieberman.senate.gov/index.cfm/news-events/news/2010/12/amazon-severs-ties-with-wikileaks |date=2010-12-04}}, Joe Lieberman's U.S. Senate web site, 1 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Amazon's] decision to cut off WikiLeaks now is the right decision and should set the standard for other companies WikiLeaks is using to distribute its illegally seized material. I call on any other company or organization that is hosting WikiLeaks to immediately terminate its relationship with them.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
Constitutional lawyers say that this is not a first amendment issue because Amazon, as a private company, is free to make its own decisions. [[Kevin Bankston]], a lawyer with the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], agreed that this is not a violation of the first amendment, but said it was nevertheless disappointing. "This certainly implicates first amendment rights to the extent that web hosts may, based on direct or informal pressure, limit the materials the American public has a first amendment right to access".&lt;ref&gt;[http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/12/how_lieberman_got_amazon_to_drop_wikileaks.php "How Lieberman Got Amazon To Drop WikiLeaks"], Talking Points Memo, 1 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2007 [[Eli Lilly and Company]] obtained a [[restraining order]] from a [[U.S. District Court]] that forbade activists in the [[psychiatric survivors movement]] from posting links on their websites to ostensibly leaked documents which purportedly showed that Eli Lilly and Company intentionally withheld information as to the lethal side-effects of [[Zyprexa]]. The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] appealed this as [[prior restraint]] on the right to link to and post documents, saying that citizen-journalists should have the same First Amendment rights as major media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eff.org/legal/cases/zyprexa/ Eli Lilly Zyprexa Litigation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011024531/http://www.eff.org/legal/cases/zyprexa |date=2008-10-11 }}, Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; It was later held that the judgment was unenforcable, though First Amendment claims were rejected.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2007/02/13 "Eli Lilly Loses Effort to Censor Zyprexa Documents Off the Internet"], press release, Electronic Frontier Foundation, 13 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The report included a list of "Corporate Enemies of the Internet", companies that sell products that are liable to be used by governments to violate [[human rights]] and [[freedom of information]]. The five "Corporate Enemies of the Internet" named in March 2013 were: [[Amesys]] (France), [[Blue Coat Systems]] (U.S.), [[FinFisher|Gamma]] (UK and Germany), [[Hacking Team]] (Italy), and Trovicor (Germany), but the list was not exhaustive and is likely to be expanded in the future.&lt;ref name=RSFSRS-March2013&gt;[http://surveillance.rsf.org/en/ ''The Enemies of the Internet Special Edition : Surveillance''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831072750/http://surveillance.rsf.org/en/ |date=2013-08-31}}, Reporters Without Borders, 12 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1965, it has been extensively studied by researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = COUNTRY-OF-ORIGIN 1965-2004: A LITERATURE REVIEW|year = 2003|url = http://www.brandhorizons.com/papers/Dinnie_COO_litreview.pdf|last = Keith|first = Dinnie|accessdate = 5 October 2013|doi = |publisher = Journal of Customer Behavior|others = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and origins==
Country of origin labelling originated in 1887 when the [[British government]], in an effort to reduce sales of [[Germany|German]] and other non-English products to English consumers, passed a law requiring [[product (business)|product]]s manufactured outside England to be labeled with their country of origin.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rayasam|first=Renuka|title=What does the "made in" label mean anymore?|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/currency/2013/09/made-in-germany-eu-labelling-regulations.html|accessdate=5 October 2013|newspaper=New Yorker|date=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States labeling ===

In the United States, the labeling of garments came into law under the Textile Fiber Products Identification Act (TFPIA).&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Hinkelman, E., &amp; Shippey, K. (2004). Commodity Index. In ''Importers Manual USA: The Single Source Encyclopedia for Importing to the United States.'' (4th ed., pp. 763-764). Novato, California: World Trade Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The act itself imposes regulations on the advertising and labeling of textile fiber products that are being imported and exported out of the United States. These products are defined in the act as, "any fiber, yarn, or fabric used or intended for use in household textile articles".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Household textile articles include "wearing apparel, costumes, draperies, floor coverings, furnishings, and bedding".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  The goal of the Textile Fiber Product Identification Act is to protect producers and consumers against mislabeling or false advertising about the fiber content of textile fiber products.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It wasn't until 1984 that the TFPIA was amended to include items made in The United States stating that they were "Made in U.S.A".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Along with outlining each fiber used within the product, the manufacturer must label country-of-origin information.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Ward, P. (1986). Other Laws for Which the FTC has Enforcement Responsibilities. In ''Federal Trade Commission: Law, Practice and Procedure''. New York, New York: Law Journal Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This information must be readily accessible on garments for quick examination. Garments that include a neck must adhere a label midway between the shoulder seams on the inside center of the neck.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Garments or products that do not include a neck must incorporate a country-of-origin label on a visible area on the inner or outer parts of the product.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

From the time that the act was introduced, the importing of apparel increased drastically in the United States. While this helped the economy domestically and globally, it also hurt the clothing manufacturing industry in the US. Before the act, 95% of clothing purchased in the US was produced stateside. Now, less than 4% purchased is made within the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Bédat, M., &amp; Darabi, S. (2015, April 24). On Fashion Revolution Day, Ask The Important Question: Who Made My Clothes? Retrieved September 20, 2015, from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/work-in-progress/2015/04/24/on-fashion-revolution-day-ask-the-important-question-who-made-my-clothes/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, manufacturing goods on a mass level can require many different suppliers and manufacturers to complete a finished product. More often than not, the tasks associated with completing a finished product do not take place in just one single manufacturer or country.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In an article for the Business of Fashion, Solca states that, "Made in disclosures are not required for products traded within the European Union. Even where required, 'Made in' criteria are easy to meet: cost thresholds can be reached with finishing, quality control and packaging, while manufacturing is kept offshore".&lt;ref&gt;Solca, L. (2015, June 14). The 'Made In' Dilemma: To Label, or Not to Label. Retrieved September 20, 2015, from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/opinion/the-made-in-dilemma-to-label-or-not-to-label&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and strength==

Research suggests that country of origin (COO) serves as a cue from which consumers make inferences about product and product attributes. The COO cue triggers a global evaluation of quality, performance, or specific product attributes. Consumers infer attributes to the product based on country stereotype and experiences with products from that country. Hence, a COO cue has become an important information cue for consumers who are exposed to far more internationalized product selection and multinational marketing than ever before. Thereby, the country of origin may even affect consumers' perceptions beyond their conscious control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herz|first1=Marc Florian|last2=Diamantopoulos|first2=Adamantios|title=Activation of country stereotypes: automaticity, consonance, and impact|journal=Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science|date=2013|volume=41|issue=4|pages=400–417|doi=10.1007/s11747-012-0318-1|ref=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11747-012-0318-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research into COO has focused on various issues linking COO with other marketing variables, including consumer nationalism, demographics, hybrid products, brand effects, product quality, price, consumer perceptions, technology sophistication, product features, advertising images, and country images, to measure consumer perceptions and purchasing behavior (Ahmed et al., 2004; Badri, Davis, &amp; Davis, 1995; Hamzaoui &amp; Merunka, 2006). 

It has been empirically demonstrated that the COO effect has significant price-related consequences and brands with favorable COO associations are able to charge price premiums, over and above those attributed to observed product differentiation (Saridakis &amp; Baltas, 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saridakis|first1=Charalampos|last2=Baltas|first2=George|title=Modeling price-related consequences of the brand origin cue: An empirical examination of the automobile market|journal=Marketing Letters|date=2016|volume=27|issue=1|pages=77–87|doi=10.1007/s11002-014-9304-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research suggests that younger consumers care significantly less than older people about country of origin, but other studies resulted in different findings. The research on whether men or women care more about country of origin is also inconclusive.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Brand gap and the effect of country-of-origin: A consumer survey in Rhone-Alps|date = 1 June 2012|url = http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:558551/FULLTEXT01.pdf|first = Karin|last = Olsson|journal = School of Sustainable Development of Society and Technology, Mälardalen University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A U.S. study found American college students more willing to buy a "[[made in China]]" teddy bear when it was sold at an American store they believed was benevolent, competent and honest, suggesting that negative country of origin effects may be offset when consumers trust the store selling the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = MADE IN CHINA BUT SOLD AT FAO SCHWARZ: COUNTRY OF ORIGIN EFFECT AND TRUSTING BELIEFS|url = http://thil-memoirevivante.prd.fr/sites/thil-memoirevivante.prd.fr/IMG/pdf/MADE_IN_CHINA_BUT_SOLD_AT_FAO_SCHWARZ.pdf|last = Kabadayi|first = Sertan and Dawn Lerman}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Associations ==
Consumers have a relative preference or aversion for products, depending on the products' country of origin (this is called affinity&lt;ref&gt;Oberecker, E. M., Riefler, P., &amp; Diamantopoulos, A. 2008. The Consumer Affinity Construct: Conceptualization, Qualitative Investigation, and Research Agenda. Journal of International Marketing, 16(3): 23-56.&lt;/ref&gt; and animosity&lt;ref&gt;Klein, J. G., Ettenson, R., &amp; Morris, M. D. 1998. The Animosity Model of Foreign Product Purchase: An Empirical Test in the People's Republic of China. Journal of Marketing, 62(1): 89-100.&lt;/ref&gt;).

In some countries consumers tend to prefer products made in their own country&lt;ref&gt;Shimp, T. A. &amp; Sharma, S. 1987. Consumer Ethnocentrism: Construction and Validation of the CETSCALE. Journal of Marketing Research, 24(3): 280-289.&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as [[consumer ethnocentrism]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Consumer Perception of Global vs. Local Brands: The Indian Car Industry|year = 2006|last = Sankar|first = Shyamala Mathan|url = http://edissertations.nottingham.ac.uk/553/1/06MAlixsm12.pdf}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in others foreign-made products tend to be preferred. A preference for locally-made products has been linked to a collectivist culture, and a preference for foreign-made products is associated with a more individualistic, competitive culture, and also with countries that are less economically developed.

One of the biggest challenges many Asian companies face as they globalise is the perception that Asian brands are inferior. Research in international marketing has proven that country associations do lead to customer bias and this bias depends on how a customer views the image of a country. French wine, German cars, Japanese robots, Colombian coffee, Italian fashion, Singaporean efficiency, Swiss chocolate. Somewhere in our minds, these products and services are associated with particular countries owing to their legacy or culture or lifestyle, which automatically leads us to perceive them as 'premium'. Some brands have even been given foreign names, to create a perceived 'COO' effect. Häagen-Dazs, the US-based ice cream company started by Jewish-Polish immigrants in New York, in 1961, was deliberately given a Scandinavian-sounding name to convey an aura of the old-world traditions and craftsmanship.

Many factors contribute to the country image including:
of the country's economy: most countries with a positive COO effect are highly industrialized, developed countries
extent of technological advancement of a country: the higher the technological capability of a country, the more positive is the COO effect
form of government: the success of capitalism and the resulting market economy around the world has created inherent perceptions (often negative) about countries that do not follow capitalism. A related aspect is the reputation of the government and its corporate governance – how bureaucratic, transparent, corrupt or efficient is a country's government?

Consumers are generally felt to perceive Chinese products as low-quality, and to associate "made in China" labelling with value pricing, unskilled labour and inexpensive materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.brandblueprint.com/articles/Chinese_Brands_Are_Coming_to_America.pdf|title = Brand Blueprint: CHINESE BRANDS ARE COMING TO AMERICA|year = 2006|publisher = Brand Blueprint|first1 = Joseph |last1=Benson |first2=Rob |last2=Levinson |first3=Drew |last3=Allison}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 and 2008 China's reputation suffered worldwide due to product safety institutions in many parts of the world recalling Chinese-made products, such as pet food, toys, toothpaste and lipstick, because of concerns about their quality and safety.&lt;ref name="money.cnn.com"&gt;{{Cite news

Some products are strongly associated with a particular country, such as (in the Western world) [[silk]] with China, [[spices]] with [[India]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Nation Equity: Country-of Origin Effects and Globalization|date = 8 February 2008|url = http://www.nationequityresearch.com/Handbook_COO_Chapter_7-0308.pdf|last = Maheswaran &amp; Cathy Chen Yi|first = Durairaj}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[wine]] with [[France]], [[chocolate]] with [[Belgium]], [[cars]] with Germany, [[fashion]] with [[Italy]] and [[Consumer electronics|electronics]] with [[Japan]]. Such products labeled as originating in that country will benefit from a [[halo effect]], with consumers assuming they are high quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = The Country of Origin Effect|date = 4 August 2011|url = http://going-global.economist.com/blog/2011/08/04/the-country-of-origin-effect/|publisher = The Economist|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131012152131/http://going-global.economist.com/blog/2011/08/04/the-country-of-origin-effect/|archivedate = 12 October 2013|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Countries that are less economically developed tend to have a negative country image and a negative country-of-origin effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Perception of the quality of products made in India by consumers from the United States: a longitudinal analysis|date = 1 March 2006|url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Perception+of+the+quality+of+products+made+in+India+by+consumers+from...-a0169308002|last = Lumb|first = Ruth and Lall, Vinod|journal = Indian Journal of Economics and Business}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Associations vary by country and region. Japan is universally understood to manufacture high-quality products, and yet historical animosity between it and some other Eastern Asian countries may reduce those countries' purchasing of Japanese products.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A1965 study found Guatemalan students gave lower evaluations to products from El Salvador and Costa Rica than to domestic and Mexican products because of a general negative attitude toward people from El Salvador and Guatemala.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; French consumers avoid buying American products due to animosity towards U.S. politics and perceived U.S. passivity during the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Throughout [[Southeast Asia]], Korean goods are very highly valued.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Global Strategy|last = Peng|first = Mike W.|publisher = Cengage Publishing|year = 2013|isbn = 978-1133964612|location = |pages = 177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==COO for services==
With the increasing importance of the service sector, also research has focussed on the influences of COO on service perception. Although not as intensively researched as with products, COO is proven to apply also on Services, e.g. when expecting a higher degree of engineering consulting by a German consultancy firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The country-of-origin affect on perception of services: Entry mode decisions as a determinant of usability|year = 2013|last = Peters|first = Nils|publisher = Grin Verlag Gmbh|doi = |page = 116|id =  {{ASIN|3656020795|country=de}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==COO marketing==
Companies are seeking to communicate the COO and to increase their customer's COO awareness with a number of different strategies:&lt;ref&gt;Aichner, T. 2014. Country-of-origin marketing: A list of typical strategies with examples. Journal of Brand Management, 21(1): 81-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Use of the phrase "Made in..."
* Use of quality and origin labels
* COO embedded in the company name
* Typical COO words embedded in the company name
* Use of the COO language
* Use of famous or stereotypical people from the COO
* Use of COO flags and symbols
* Use of typical landscapes or famous buildings from the COO

==Fluctuations==
Perceptions of countries and their products change over time. Since the late 19th century the German reputation for quality and attention to detail has helped it sell products internationally, but its reputation was significantly damaged during the [[First World War]] and [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Market dominance''' is a measure of the strength of a [[brand]], [[product (business)|product]], [[Service (economics)|service]], or [[corporation|firm]], relative to competitive offerings. There is often a geographic element to the competitive landscape. In defining market dominance, you must see to what extent a product, brand, or firm  controls a product category in a given geographic area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kuznets.fas.harvard.edu/~athey/Invest_Mkt_Dominance.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410072435/http://kuznets.fas.harvard.edu/~athey/Invest_Mkt_Dominance.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calculating==
There are several ways of calculating market dominance. The most direct is [[market share]]. This is the percentage of the total market served by a firm or brand. A declining scale of market shares is common in most industries: that is, if the industry leader has say 50% share, the next largest might have 25% share, the next 12% share, the next 6% share, and all remaining firms combined might have 7% share.

Market share is not a perfect proxy of market dominance. The influences of customers, suppliers, competitors in related industries, and government regulations must be taken into account. Although there are no hard and fast rules governing the relationship between market share and market dominance, the following are general criteria:
* A company, brand, product, or service that has a combined market share exceeding 60%  most probably has market power and market dominance.
* A market share of over 35% but less than 60%, held by one brand, product or service, is an indicator of  market strength but not necessarily dominance.
* A market share of less than 35%, held by one brand, product or service, is not an indicator of strength or dominance and will not raise anti-competitive concerns by government regulators.

Market shares within an industry might not exhibit a declining scale. There could be only two firms in a [[duopoly|duopolistic market]], each with 50% share; or there could be three firms in the industry each with 33% share; or 100 firms each with 1% share. The [[concentration ratio]] of an industry is used as an indicator of the relative size of leading firms in relation to the industry as a whole.  One commonly used concentration ratio is the ''four-firm concentration ratio'', which consists of the combined market share of the four largest firms, as a percentage, in the total industry.  The higher the concentration ratio, the greater the market power of the leading firms.

Alternatively, there is the [[Herfindahl index]]. It is a measure of the size of firms in relation to the industry and an indicator of the amount of competition among them. It is defined as the sum of the squares of the market shares of each individual firm. As such, it can range from 0 to 10,000, moving from a very large amount of very small firms to a single [[monopoly|monopolistic]] producer. Decreases in the Herfindahl index generally indicate a loss of [[pricing power]] and an increase in competition, whereas increases imply the opposite.

Kwoka's ''dominance index'' (D) is defined as the sum of the squared differences between each firm's share and the next largest share in a market: 
:&lt;math&gt;D = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (s_i-s_{i+1})^2&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;s_1 \ge ... \ge s_i \ge s_{i+1} \ge ... \ge s_n&lt;/math&gt; for all ''i'' = 1, ..., ''n'' - 1.&lt;ref&gt;Kwoka, J. E. "Large firm dominance and price-cost margins in manufacturing industries." Southern Econ J (1977) vol. 44, pp. 183–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of its merger review process, Mexican Competition Commission uses García Alba's ''dominance index'' (ID), described as the [[Herfindahl index]] of a [[Herfindahl index]] (HHI). Formally, ID is the sum of squared firm contributions to the market HHI: &lt;math&gt;ID = \sum_{i=1}^n h_i^2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;h_i = \left. s_i^2 \right/ HHI.&lt;/math&gt;

''Asymmetry Index'' (AI) is defined as the [[Variance|statistical variance]] of market shares: &lt;math&gt;AI=\left.\sum_{i=1}^n  \left(s_i- {1 \over n}\right)^2 \right/n.&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Brown, Donald M., and Frederick R.

== [[European Union law|EU Law]] and Dominance ==
There are different perspectives of what indicates dominance and how to go about establishing dominance. One of these being the perspective of the [[European Commission]] regarding their application of [[Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]] (Formerly Article 82 of the Treaty establishing the European Community), that deals specifically with the abuse of dominance in the market regarding [[European Union competition law|competition law]].

The European Commission equates dominance with the economic concept of substantial market power, which indicates that dominance can be exerted and abused, in its Guidance on A102 Enforcement Priorities. In paragraph 10 of the Guidance, it is stated that where there is no competitive pressure, an [[Company|undertaking]], which is a legal entity acting in the course of business, is probably able to exercise substantial market power. Furthermore, in paragraph 11, this is developed on, arguing if an undertaking can increase their products above the competitive price level, and does not face economic restraints, it is therefore dominant.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:52009XC0224(01)|title=EUR-Lex - 52009XC0224(01) - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in basic terms, if two businesses are selling competing products, and one can increase their selling price, and not suffer an economic consequence such as a boycott of their products or a shift of their customers to a cheaper product, they are dominant.

The Guidance is not law, it is instead a set of rules the courts are to follow. However, the same definition can be found elsewhere, in Chapter 3 of the Unilateral Conduct Workbook. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Unilateral Conduct Workbook Chapter 3: Assessment of Dominance|last=|first=|publisher=The Unilateral Conduct Working Group|year=May 2011|isbn=|location=10th Annual ICN Conference The Hague, Netherlands|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guidance is also supported by paragraph 65 of the Commission’s judgement in ''United Brands v Commission''. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:61976CJ0027|title=EUR-Lex - 61976CJ0027 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“65''THE DOMINANT POSITION REFERRED TO IN THIS ARTICLE (102) RELATES TO A POSITION OF ECONOMIC STRENGTH ENJOYED BY AN UNDERTAKING WHICH ENABLES IT TO PREVENT EFFECTIVE COMPETITION BEING MAINTAINED ON THE RELEVANT MARKET BY GIVING IT THE POWER TO BEHAVE TO AN APPRECIABLE EXTENT INDEPENDENTLY OF ITS COMPETITORS , CUSTOMERS AND ULTIMATELY OF ITS CONSUMERS."''

The identification of the relevant and geographic market must first be established before being able to calculate shares or an undertaking’s dominance within that market. Dominance as an economic concept is determined within EU competition law through a 2-stage process, which first requires the identification of the relevant market as was established in ''Continental Can v Commission''. This was affirmed in paragraph 30 of the judgement of ''AstraZeneca AB v Commission'', in which the Commission stated that it must be assessed whether an undertaking is able to act independently of its competitors, customers and consumers. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=82135&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=en&amp;mode=lst&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=264627|title=CURIA - Documents|website=curia.europa.eu|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The identification of the relevant and geographic market is assessed through the hypothetical monopolist test, which questions would a party’s customer, switch to an alternative supplier located elsewhere, in response to a small relative price increase. Therefore, it is a question of interchangeability and demand substitutability, meaning whether one product can be a substitute for another, and whether an undertaking's market power puts them above price competition. The second stage of the test requires the Commission to look at various factors to see if an undertaking enjoys a dominant position on that relevant market. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:61972CJ0006|title=EUR-Lex - 61972CJ0006 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Factors ===
Identifying a dominant position involves the use of several factors. The European Commission’s Guidance on A102 states that a dominant position is derived from a combination of factors, which taken separately are not determinative. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the constraints imposed by existing supplies from, and the position of, actual competitors, meaning those who are competing with the undertaking in question. This involves looking at the day-to-day downwards pressure that retains low product prices and competitiveness within the market, which market shares are only useful as a first indication of; this needs to be followed by the consideration of other factors such as market conditions and dynamics. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Guidance also states that the constraints imposed by the credible threat of future expansion by actual competitors, or entry by potential competitors, is a required factor of consideration. For example, [[Intellectual property|Intellectual Property]] in the form of patent protection, is a potential legal barrier to entering the market for new businesses, as was shown in ''[[Microsoft Corp v Commission|Microsoft Corp]]''. In this case, the Court of Justice confirmed the Commission’s decision, that Microsoft were dominant and had abused their dominant position regarding their refusal to supply the interoperability information for operating PC Windows with other systems. Microsoft was forced to licence out its interoperability data.

The final point that must be considered is the bargaining strength of the undertaking’s customers, also known as the countervailing buyer power. This refers to the competitive constraints that customers may exert where they are a large size, or commercially significant, for a dominant firm. However, the Commission will not come to a final decision without examining all of the factors which may be relevant to constrain the behaviour of the undertaking. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Relevance of market shares'''

According to the European Commission, market shares provide a useful first indication of the structure of any market and of the relative importance of the various undertakings active on it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In paragraph 15 of the Guidance on A102, the European Commission state that a high market share over a long period of time can be a preliminary indication of dominance. The International Competition Network stress that determining whether substantial market power is apparent should not be based on market shares alone, but instead an analysis of all factors affecting the competitive conditions in the market, should be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Recommended Practices: Dominance/Substantial Market Power Analysis Pursuant To Unilateral Conduct Laws|last=|first=|publisher=ICN Unilateral Conduct Working Group|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

100% market shares are very rare but can arise in niche areas, a close example of this being 91.8% market share in ''Tetra Pak 1 (BTG Licence)'', and the 96% market share in plasterboard held by BPB in ''BPB Industries Plc v Commission OJ''. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=88/501/EEC: Commission Decision of 26 July 1988 relating to a proceeding under Articles 85 and 86 of the EEC Treaty (IV/31.043 - Tetra Pak I (BTG licence) (Only the English and French texts are authentic)|date=1988-10-04|url=http://data.europa.eu/eli/dec/1988/501/oj/eng|issue=31988D0501|language=en|accessdate=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:61989TJ0065|title=EUR-Lex - 61989TJ0065 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Hoffman-La Roche v Commission'', the Court of Justice said that large market shares are ‘evidence of the existence of a dominant position’ which led to the Court of Justice decision in ''AKZO v Commission'' that where there is market share of at least 50%, without exceptional circumstances, there will be a presumption of dominance that shifts the burden of proof on to the undertaking. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:61976CJ0085|title=EUR-Lex - 61976CJ0085 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:61986CJ0062|title=EUR-Lex - 61986CJ0062 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Commission has affirmed this threshold in cases since AKZO. For example, in paragraph 100 of the Commission Judgment in the Court of First Instance in ''France Telecom v Commission'', the Commission state that ‘…very large shares are in themselves, and save in exceptional circumstances, evidence of the existence of a dominant position…’, citing the Court of Justice judgement in AZKO, paragraph 60, ‘…this was so in the case of a 50% market share.’. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=66047&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=en&amp;mode=lst&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=253572|title=CURIA - Documents|website=curia.europa.eu|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

European Commission's ''Tenth Report on Competition'' implies that a significant disparity between the largest and the second-largest firm shares can indicate that the largest firm has a dominant position in the market. Specifically, under a section entitled "Scrutiny of mergers for compatibility with Article 86 EEC," the Report states:

:A dominant position can generally be said to exist once a market share to the order of 40% to 45% is reached. [footnote: A dominant position cannot even be ruled out in respect of market shares between 20% and 40%; Ninth Report on Competition Policy, point 22.] Although this share does not in itself automatically give control of the market, if there are large gaps between the position of the firm concerned and those of its closest competitors and also other factors likely to place it at an advantage as regards competition, a dominant position may well exist. (European Commission's Tenth Report on Competition, page 103, paragraph 150.)

The '''Downtown Albany Historic District''' is a 19-block, {{convert|66|acre|ha|adj=on}} area of [[Albany, New York|Albany]], New York, United States, centered on the junction of State ([[New York State Route 5]]) and North and South Pearl streets ([[New York State Route 32]]). It is the oldest settled area of the city, originally planned and settled in the 17th century, and the nucleus of its later development and expansion. In 1980 it was designated a [[Historic districts in the United States|historic district]] by the city and then listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its 160 buildings are a mix of tall commercial buildings on the main streets and small houses on the side. Most were built between 1880 and 1930, the district's period of significance, with some dating to the 1810s.&lt;ref name="nrhptext"&gt;{{cite web |author=John F.

Several [[contributing property|contributing properties]] have been listed on the Register in their own right, and one designated a  [[National Historic Landmark]]. Albany's earliest [[skyscraper]]s were built here, including one that was the city's tallest at the time of its completion. The current mix of buildings reflects the city's peak of industrial prosperity in the [[Gilded Age]], with many built by banks, as well as the city's status as New York's state capital.

It has been displaced in the city's skyline by later construction, particularly by the [[Empire State Plaza]], the modernist home of [[New York (state)|New York]]'s [[Government of New York (state)|state government]]. [[Urban renewal]] programs of the late 20th century largely bypassed the district for political reasons. As a result, its historic buildings are mostly intact, although some have been compromised through neglect.

==Geography==

The district is an irregular area, shaped like a rough [[crescent]]. It is centered along the axes of North and South Pearl ([[New York State Route 32|NY 32]]) and State ([[New York State Route 5|NY 5]] west of Pearl) streets. A combination of natural features, streets, and legal boundaries serves to delineate it. Downtown is located to the northeast of and downhill from the [[modern architecture|modernist]] towers of [[Empire State Plaza]], and east of the [[New York State Capitol|state capitol]].

On the east it is bounded by the [[Hudson River]] and [[Interstate 787]], with Eagle Street its western side (excluding [[Albany City Hall|City Hall]], the [[New York State Court of Appeals|state Court of Appeals]] and the county courthouse). To the north, the boundary follows Columbia Street to Chapel Street, then north to Sheridan Street. It continues east to North Pearl and then follows rear [[lot (real estate)|lot]] lines along the north side of  Columbia to Broadway and out to I-787, then turns south.&lt;ref name=nrhptext/&gt;

At the district's southern tip, it comes inland again to Pruyn Street, which it follows for a block to Liberty Street and then turns north to Hudson Avenue, where it follows an irregular route along property lines to Norton Street. Here it continues west to South Pearl, and after a short twist to the north it follows Howard Street west. At William Street it turns south again, and then follows some property lines west to Beaver Street across from the [[Times Union Center]]. At Wendell Street it turns north to Howard and follows Howard west back to Eagle.&lt;ref name=nrhptext/&gt;

This area takes in 19 [[city block|blocks]] and parts of several others. James and Steuben streets, as well as Maiden Lane, are included in their entirety along with some narrow [[alley]]s within blocks. The area is totally developed, with many multistory buildings used as office space with storefronts at street level. Open space between them and on the edges is used for [[parking lot]]s. There are no significant parks or squares within it.

==History==

Downtown has always been the center of Albany from its founding in the 17th century. Its built environment did not take its present form until the late 19th. Since then it has remained relatively stable, with some [[urban decay|decaying]] buildings facing demolition pressure as part of redevelopment efforts.
[[File:Albany plan 1695.png|200px|thumb|left|Map of Albany in late 17th century]]

===Colonial and Revolutionary period===

The area within the district was the same as that originally [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|settled by the Dutch]] in the 17th century north of [[Fort Orange (New Netherland)|Fort Orange]], a high area between two ravines that have since been filled in. It became British in 1664 and was renamed Albany,&lt;ref name=nrhptext/&gt; in honor of [[James II of England|King James II]],  Duke of Albany prior to his coronation.

The [[grid plan]] of the area's streets was laid out at this time, although it was mostly unbuilt as the city was within a [[stockade]]. Most commercial buildings at the time, primarily warehouses, were located on what is now Broadway. The 1815 Coulson Building at 420 Broadway, the oldest building in the district, is typical of that kind of construction. The inland blocks were residential.&lt;ref name=nrhptext/&gt;

Albany was a point of contention during both the [[French and Indian War|French and Indian]] and [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary]] wars, and the [[New York State Legislature]] met there in 1780 after British occupation ended. In 1797 it was designated the state capital.&lt;ref name=nrhptext/&gt;
[[File:St Peters Church 2011.jpg|right|thumb|200px|St. Peter's Church]]

===19th century===

More residences were built, primarily to be rented to lawyers and legislators working in the capitol and the courts. The city began to expand and [[annexation|annex]] surrounding land to handle its growth. The opening of the [[Erie Canal]] in the 1820s and the development of railroads in later decades made the city a transportation hub, and as its commercial power and the state's grew it assumed more political importance. Smaller buildings remained the norm along the side streets, with churches springing up next to them. [[Richard Upjohn]]'s French Gothic [[St. Peter's Episcopal Church (Albany, New York)|St. Peter's Episcopal Church]] on State, finished in 1860, is considered one of his best churches. Another church, [[St. Mary's Church (Albany, New York)|St. Mary's]], by the local firm of Nicholls and Brown, became the focal point of a neighborhbood of small houses on and near Lodge Street. [[Richard Upjohn]]'s French Gothic [[St. Peter's Episcopal Church (Albany, New York)|St. Peter's Episcopal Church]] on State, finished in 1860, is considered one of his best churches.&lt;ref name=nrhptext/&gt;

In the years after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] commercial interests started building taller and more massive edifices along North Pearl and State streets. Albany native Edward Ogden designed the 1873 [[Kenmore Hotel]] on North Pearl, and expanded it in 1891 with [[Queen Anne Style architecture|Queen Anne]] touches. His 1889 Albany Business College building opposite the Kenmore likewise uses the [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] style. Another local architect, Albert Puller, had given downtown the YMCA building at 60 North Pearl, in that style three years earlier&lt;ref name=nrhptext/&gt;

===20th century===

The Albany architect who had the greatest impact on the district was [[Marcus T. Reynolds]], with six buildings, most of them from the early 20th century. The most prominent is his 1914 [[SUNY System Administration Building|headquarters]] for the [[Delaware and Hudson Railway]] on the east side of Broadway. A copy of the [[Cloth Hall, Ypres|Cloth Hall]] in the Belgian city of [[Ypres]], it has become an icon of the city, often mistaken by first-time visitors for the state capitol.&lt;ref name="D&amp;H building NRHP nom"&gt;{{cite web|last=Liebs|first=Charles H.|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Delaware &amp; Hudson Railway Company Building |url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=371 |date=August 1970|accessdate=2009-01-13}} and [http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=370 ''Accompanying one photo, exterior, undated'']&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:StateStreetAlbanyNY.JPG|200px|left|thumb|View of D&amp;H building down State Street]]
It serves as a focal point when looking east down State Street. Two of Reynolds' other buildings in the district, the 1897 [[First Trust Company Building]] at State and Broadway, and the 1902 [[United Traction Company Building]] at Broadway and Columbia, similarly guide the eye down Broadway as it bends.&lt;ref name=nrhptext/&gt;

Architects from New York City also built in Albany. In 1875, [[Russell Sturgis]] had designed the [[Victorian Gothic]] bank building at 63 State Street, and it was paired with a [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] bank building by [[York and Sawyer]] a quarter-century later at 60 State. [[Henry Ives Cobb]] incorporated the 1803 façade of [[Philip Hooker]]'s State Bank of Albany building into a 16-story office building at North Pearl and State. Near the end of the period of significance, Dennison and Hiron's [[Art Deco]] [[Home Savings Bank Building]] was the tallest in Albany at the time of its 1927 completion.&lt;ref name=nrhptext/&gt; It was quickly displaced from that title by the state government's [[Alfred E. Smith Building]] the next year.

No major building took place downtown in the 1930s due to the combination of it being built out and the slowdown in construction occasioned by the onset of the [[Great Depression]]. When the economy regained its footing after [[World War II]], the focus of new development had shifted to outlying areas and then the suburbs. Downtown remained a popular place for politicians and those who associated with them to patronize, but otherwise began to decline in a similar fashion as other old Northeastern cities.

A 1969 redevelopment plan identified the "obsolete street plan" and lack of quality parking as a source of downtown's problems. It proposed reconfiguring the streets to coordinate better with the expressways proposed for the area at the time. A large [[pedestrian mall]] was proposed for the area between Chapel and Broadway, with the intervening blocks of Steuben, Pearl and Pine to be closed off to vehicles. A platform was to cross the interstate and provide a pedestrian link to [[marina]]s and apartments along the river. To make up for the lost streets, Chapel would have become North Pearl, and a bridge would be built to extend Eagle Street to [[Clinton Avenue Historic District (Albany, New York)|Clinton Avenue]] at Ten Broeck Street. Eventually, it was hoped, a [[people mover]] system would be built to link Empire Plaza and downtown, with new [[parking garage]]s on the fringes, one of which would have required rerouting Liberty Street and Hudson Avenue.&lt;ref name="1969 plan"&gt;{{cite book|title=Downtown Albany Development Plan|date=April 1969|publisher=City of Albany|author=Candeub, Flessig and Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AlbanyNewYorkfromRensselaer.jpg|right|thumb|200px|2009 view of downtown from across river, overshadowed by Empire State Plaza]]
The old buildings were spared the fate of demolition through [[urban renewal]] as the city's [[political machine]] under [[Daniel P. O'Connell]] mostly eschewed the federal funding for such projects since the federal government would award contracts, limiting the city machine's [[Patronage#Politics|patronage]]. New development in the center of Albany instead took the form of what was originally known as the "South Mall Project" proposed by Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]]. This cleared {{convert|98|acre|ha}} southwest of downtown for a complex centered on five tall state office buildings in high [[modern architecture|modernist]] style. When completed in the late 1970s, [[Empire State Plaza]] became the new centerpiece of the city's skyline, and [[Erastus Corning Tower]] its tallest building.&lt;ref name="Albany history Lo Faber page"&gt;{{cite web |last=Faber |first=Lo |authorlink=Lo Faber |title=All About Albany: History |url=http://www.lofaber.com/albany/history.html |date=November–December 2004 |accessdate=July 8, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628100449/http://www.lofaber.com/albany/history.html |archivedate=June 28, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The  Delaware and Hudson moved out of its building following the decline in its industry, and after a few years of vacancy it was purchased by the state to become the main headquarters of the [[State University of New York]].

===21st century===

In the late 1980s Sebba Rockaway, a British developer, proposed to demolish a row of buildings, all contributing, at 136–40 State Street and replace them with a 14-story office complex. [[Historic preservation|Preservationists]] objected, but the city granted permission. The project was later canceled when Sebba failed to find tenants for the property. A decade later, it put forth a similar expanded proposal, which would have demolished not only the original properties but the long-vacant [[Wellington Row]] which includes the Wellington and Berkshire hotels, as well as the former Albany [[Elks]] lodge.&lt;ref name="1999 Times Union story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Benjamin |first=Elizabeth |title=Developer Looking to Raze Historic Buildings in Albany |url=http://archives.timesunion.com/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&amp;imageid=5960985 |publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]] |work=[[Albany Times-Union]] |date=December 7, 1999 |accessdate=July 8, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This time the preservationists sued the city to stop the demolition. The buildings continued to deteriorate, and in 2004 a section of State Street was closed since part of the Wellington's [[cornice]] was in danger of falling into it. A new owner, Columbia Development Companies, bought the properties and finally reached a compromise that preserved the [[façade]]s of the Wellington and the other State Street buildings, with the new office building to rise behind them. Demolition began in 2009.&lt;ref name="2009 Times Union story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Carleo-Evangelist |first=Jordan |title=Ex-Hotel Yields to Future Vision |url=http://archives.timesunion.com/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&amp;imageid=7671340 |publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]] |work=[[Albany Times-Union]] |date=March 25, 2009 |accessdate=July 8, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New construction or expansion within the district is reviewed by the city's Historic Resources Commission (HRC), a group of nine citizens with an interest in architecture, history or [[historic preservation]] appointed by the mayor. The HRC also considers new city landmark designations.&lt;ref name="City HRC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Historic Resources Commission|url=http://www.albanyny.org/Government/Departments/DevelopmentPlanning/PlanningZoningLandUse/HistoricResourcesCommission.aspx|publisher=City of Albany|year=2007|accessdate=July 5, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121230550/http://www.albanyny.org/Government/Departments/DevelopmentPlanning/PlanningZoningLandUse/HistoricResourcesCommission.aspx|archivedate=November 21, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area also comes under the purview of several of Albany's neighborhood associations.&lt;ref name="neighborhood map"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://albanyny.gov/_files/Government/Development_Planning/Neighborhood_Map_Website21.pdf |title= City of Albany Neighborhood Map |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101023015221/http://albanyny.gov/_files/Government/Development_Planning/Neighborhood_Map_Website21.pdf |archivedate= 2010-10-23 |df=  }}, City of Albany Department of Neighborhood Revitalization.

'''Edward W. Forbes''' (1873-1969) was an American art historian. He was the Director of the [[Fogg Art Museum]] at [[Harvard University]] from 1909 to 1944.

==Early life==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2624">{{Redirect|Empire building||Empire Building (disambiguation)}}
'''Empire-building''' is the practice of attempting to obtain greater power and authority within an organization for the purposes of [[Boasting|self-aggrandizement]], particularly by having extra staff or subordinates.&lt;ref name="oxf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/empire-building |title=empire-building |publisher=Oxford University Press |access-date=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="enc"&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Encarta Dictionaries: English dictionary: empire-building |url= |location=Redmond, WA |publisher=Microsoft Corporation |page= |date=2008 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In [[political science]], empire-building refers to the tendency of countries and nations to acquire resources, land, and economic influence outside their borders in order to expand their size, power, and wealth. This expansion can be at the cost of those nations or people that have had resources taken away from them so that the conqueror can be enriched.

In [[business]], empire-building is demonstrated when individuals or small groups attempt to gain control over key projects and initiatives to maximize [[job security]] and promotability. Project leadership hoards potential credit and prestige the project can produce. Because this approach prevents other people in the organization from contributing in a meaningful manner and alternative or competing projects to address the project's goals are destroyed regardless of their merit, the company suffers as a whole, projects fail, and the goals of the project are achieved partially, inadequately, or not at all. This sort of behavior is supposed to be stopped by upper management but is nevertheless very common.

In an organization, empire-building can also be demonstrated when an individual or small group eagerly and proactively suggests and pursues functions, activities or projects that are of questionable value to try to enhance legitimacy and future value. Pursuit of these activities is initially done at little or no marginal cost, but later the activities are used to justify increased resource allocation, being part of the organizational status quo, and thus the individual or group's overall command of resources, and influence, increases.

[[File:McDonalds in Moncton.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|right|A [[McDonald's]] franchise in [[Moncton]], [[New Brunswick]], [[Canada]]]]
'''Franchising''' is based on a marketing concept which can be adopted by an organization as a strategy for business expansion. Where implemented, a franchiser licenses its know-how, procedures, intellectual property, use of its [[business model]], brand, and rights to sell its branded products and services to a franchisee. In return the franchisee pays certain fees and agrees to comply with certain obligations, typically set out in a Franchise Agreement.

The word "franchise" is of Anglo-French derivation—from ''franc'', meaning free—and is used both as a noun and as a (transitive) verb.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=franchise&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 "franchise"] ''Online Etymology Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt;
For the franchiser, use of a franchise system is an alternative business growth strategy, compared to expansion through corporate owned outlets or "[[chain store]]s". Adopting a franchise system business growth strategy for the sale and distribution of goods and services minimizes the franchiser's capital investment and liability risk.

As with any business venture, franchising is not immune to risk. But if undertaken in the right way, franchising can be a vehicle of success for both the franchisor and franchisee.

Thirty-three countries have laws that explicitly regulate franchising, with the majority of all other countries having laws which have a direct or indirect effect on franchising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlapiper.com/us/services/detail.aspx?service=256|title=International Franchise and Distribution|accessdate=2012-02-02|year=2012|work=DLA Piper|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402043832/http://www.dlapiper.com/us/services/detail.aspx?service=256|archivedate=2012-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Franchising is also used as a [[foreign market entry modes|foreign market entry mode]].

==History==
The boom in franchising did not take place until after [[World War II]]. Nevertheless, the rudiments of modern franchising date back to the [[Middle Ages]] when landowners made franchise-like agreements with tax collectors, who retained a percentage of the money they collected and turned the rest over.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.franchoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/History-of-Franchising.pdf|title=History of Franchising|last=|first=|date=|website=Franchoice.com|access-date=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice ended around 1562 but spread to other endeavors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.franchise-chat.com/resources/where_it_all_began_the_evolution_of_franchising.htm|title=Where it all began.  The evolution of franchising. {{!}} Franchise-chat Resource Archive|website=Franchise-chat.com|access-date=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 17th century England franchisees were granted the right to sponsor markets and fairs or operate ferries. There was little growth in franchising, though, until the mid-19th century, when it appeared in the United States for the first time.

One of the first successful American franchising operations was started by an enterprising druggist named [[John Pemberton|John S. Pemberton]]. In 1886, he concocted a beverage comprising sugar, molasses, spices, and cocaine. Pemberton licensed selected people to bottle and sell the drink, which was an early version of what is now known as Coca-Cola. His was one of the earliest—and most successful—franchising operations in the United States.

The [[Singer Corporation|Singer Company]] implemented a franchising plan in the 1850s to distribute its sewing machines. The operation failed, though, because the company did not earn much money even though the machines sold well. The dealers, who had exclusive rights to their territories, absorbed most of the profits because of deep discounts. Some failed to push Singer products, so competitors were able to outsell the company. Under the existing contract, Singer could neither withdraw rights granted to franchisees nor send in its own salaried representatives. So, the company started repurchasing the rights it had sold. The experiment proved to be a failure. That may have been one of the first times a franchisor failed, but it was by no means the last. (Even Colonel Sanders did not initially succeed in his [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] franchising efforts.) Still, the Singer venture did not put an end to franchising.

Other companies tried franchising in one form or another after the Singer experience. For example, several decades later, [[General Motors Corporation]] established a somewhat successful franchising operation in order to raise capital. Perhaps the father of modern franchising, though, is [[Louis K. Liggett]]. In 1902, Liggett invited a group of druggists to join a "drug cooperative." As he explained to them, they could increase profits by paying less for their purchases, especially if they set up their own manufacturing company. His idea was to market private label products. About 40 druggists pooled $4,000 of their own money and adopted the name "[[Rexall]]". Sales soared, and Rexall became a franchisor. The chain's success set a pattern for other franchisors to follow.

Although many business owners did affiliate with cooperative ventures of one type or another, there was little growth in franchising until the early 20th century, and what franchising there was did not take the same form as it does today. As the United States shifted from an agricultural to an industrial economy, manufacturers licensed individuals to sell automobiles, trucks, gasoline, beverages, and a variety of other products. The franchisees did little more than sell the products, though. The sharing of responsibility associated with contemporary franchising arrangement did not exist to any great extent. Consequently, franchising was not a growth industry in the United States.

It was not until the 1960s and 1970s that people began to take a close look at the attractiveness of franchising. The concept intrigued people with entrepreneurial spirit. However, there were serious pitfalls for investors, which almost ended the practice before it became truly popular.

Mid-sized franchises like restaurants, gasoline stations and trucking stations involve substantial investment and require all the attention of a businessperson.

There are also large franchises like hotels, spas and hospitals, which are discussed further under [[technological alliance]]s.

==Fees and contract arrangement==
Three important payments are made to a franchisor: (a) a [[royalties|royalty]] for the trademark, (b) reimbursement for the training and advisory services given to the franchisee, and (c) a percentage of the individual business unit's sales. These three fees may be combined in a single 'management' fee. A fee for "disclosure" is separate and is always a "front-end fee".

A franchise usually lasts for a fixed time period (broken down into shorter periods, which each require renewal), and serves a specific territory or geographical area surrounding its location. One franchisee may manage several such locations. Agreements typically last from five to thirty years, with premature cancellations or terminations of most contracts bearing serious consequences for franchisees. A franchise is merely a temporary business investment involving renting or leasing an opportunity, not the purchase of a business for the purpose of ownership. It is classified as a wasting asset due to the finite term of the license.

Franchise fees are on average 6.7% with an additional average marketing fee of 2% &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.franchise.org/industrysecondary.aspx?id=31612|title=The Profile of Franchising Report Series III – Royalty and Advertising Fees|year=2006|work=International Franchise Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all franchise opportunities are the same and many franchise organizations are pioneering new models that challenge antiquated structures and redefine success for the organization as well as the franchisee.

A franchise can be exclusive, non-exclusive or "sole and exclusive".

Although franchisor revenues and profit may be listed in a [[Franchise Disclosure Document|franchise disclosure document]] (FDD), no laws require an estimate of franchisee profitability, which depends on how intensively the franchisee "works" the franchise. Therefore, franchisor fees are typically based on "gross revenue from sales" and not on profits realized. See [[remuneration]].

Various tangibles and intangibles such as national or international [[advertising]], [[training]] and other support services are commonly made available by the franchisor.

Franchise brokers help franchisors find appropriate franchisees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Libava|first1=Joel|title=What is a Franchise Broker|url=https://www.sba.gov/blogs/what-franchise-broker|website=Small Business Administration|accessdate=22 July 2017|date=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also main 'master franchisors' who obtain the rights to sub-franchise in a territory.

According to the International Franchise Association approximately 44% of all businesses in the United States are franchisee-worked.

==Rationale and risk shift==
Franchising is one of the few means available to access [[venture capital]] without the need to give up control of the operation of the chain and build a distribution system for servicing it. After the brand and formula are carefully designed and properly executed, franchisors are able to sell franchises and expand rapidly across countries and continents using the capital and resources of their franchisees while reducing their own risk.

There is also risk for the people buying the franchises. However, failure rates are much lower for franchise businesses than independent business startups.&lt;ref name="TimothyNoah"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Noah|first1=Timothy|title=Disenfranchised: Why are Americans Still Buying Into the Franchise Dream|url=https://psmag.com/economics/disenfranchised-fast-food-workers-quiznos-73967|website=Pacific Standard|publisher=The Social Justice Foundation|accessdate=22 July 2017|date=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Franchisor rules imposed by the franchising authority are becoming increasingly strict. Some franchisors are using minor rule violations to terminate contracts and seize the franchise without any reimbursement.&lt;ref name="TimothyNoah" /&gt;

== Advantages and disadvantages of franchising as an entry mode ==
Franchising brings with it several advantages and disadvantages for firms looking to expand into new areas and foreign markets. The primary advantage is that the firm does not have to bear the development cost and risks of opening a foreign market on its own, as the Franchisee is typically responsible for those costs and risks, putting the onus on the Franchisee to build a profitable operation as quickly as possible.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Business|last=Hill|first=Charles W.L.|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|year=2015|isbn=978-0-07-811277-5|location=New York|pages=457}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through franchising a firm has the potential of building a global presence quickly and also at a low cost and risk.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A primary disadvantage to franchising is quality control, as the franchisor wants the firm's brand name to convey a message to consumers about the quality and consistency of the firm's product.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They want the consumer to experience the same quality regardless of location or franchise status.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This can prove to be an issue with franchising, as a customer who had a bad experience at one franchise may assume that they will have the same experience at other locations with other services. Distance can make it difficult for firms to detect whether or not the franchises are of poor quality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One way around this disadvantage is to set up extra subsidiaries in each country or state in which the firm expands. This creates a smaller number of franchisees to oversee, which will reduce the quality control challenges.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Obligations of the parties==
Each party to a franchise has several interests to protect.  The franchisor is involved in securing protection for the trademark, controlling the business concept and securing [[know-how]]. The franchisee is obligated to carry out the services for which the trademark has been made prominent or famous. There is a great deal of standardization required. The place of service has to bear the franchisor's signs, logos and trademark in a prominent place. The uniforms worn by the staff of the franchisee have to be of a particular design and color.  The service has to be in accordance with the pattern followed by the franchisor in the successful franchise operations. Thus, franchisees are not in full control of the business, as they would be in retailing.

A service can be successful if equipment and supplies are purchased at a fair price from the franchisor or sources recommended by the franchisor. A coffee brew, for example, can be readily identified by the trademark if its raw materials come from a particular supplier.  If the franchisor requires purchase from her stores, it may come under [[anti-trust legislation]] or equivalent laws of other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maslynlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Supplier-Paper.pdf|format=PDF|title=Contractual and Business Aspects of Structuring Supplier Agreements|website=Maslynlaw.com|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; So too the purchase things like uniforms of personnel and signs, as well as the franchise sites, if they are owned or controlled by the franchisor.

The franchisee must carefully negotiate the license and must develop a marketing or business plan with the franchisor.  The fees must be fully disclosed and there should not be any hidden fees. The start-up costs and working capital must be known before the license is granted. There must be assurance that additional licensees will not crowd the "territory" if the franchise is worked according to plan. The franchisee must be seen as an independent merchant. It must be protected by the franchisor from any trademark infringement by third parties. A franchise attorney is required to assist the franchisee during negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;''Manual on Technology Transfer Negotiation (A reference for policy-makers and practitioners on Technology Transfer)'', 1996, United Nations Industrial Development Organization, Vienna, 1990, {{ISBN|92-1-106302-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often the training period – the costs of which are in great part covered by the initial fee – is too short in cases where it is necessary to operate complicated equipment, and the franchisee has to learn on their own from instruction manuals. The training period must be adequate, but in low-cost franchises it may be considered expensive. Many franchisors have set up corporate universities to train staff online. This is in addition to providing literature, sales documents and email access.

Also, franchise agreements carry no guarantees or [[warranty|warranties]] and the franchisee has little or no recourse to legal intervention in the event of a dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Should You Invest in a Franchise Opportunity|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/business/evaluating_franchise.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franchise contracts tend to be unilateral and favor of the franchisor, who is generally protected from lawsuits from their franchisees because of the non-negotiable contracts that franchisees are required to acknowledge, in effect, that they are buying the franchise knowing that there is risk, and that they have not been promised success or profits by the franchisor. Contracts are renewable at the sole option of the franchisor. Most franchisors require franchisees to sign agreements that mandate where and under what law any dispute would be litigated.

==Regulations==
===Australia===
In 2016 there was an estimated 1,120 franchise brands operating in Australia and an estimated 79,000 units operating in business format franchises, with a total brand turnover of approximately $146 billion and a sales revenue of approximately $66.5 billion.&lt;ref name="FA2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=Franchising Australia 2016|url=https://www.franchise.org.au/research.html|website=Franchise Council Of Australia|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 the majority of franchise brands were retailers with the largest segment being non-food retailing, accounting for 26 percent of brands, a further 19 percent of brands were involved in food retailing, 15 percent of franchisors operated in administration and support services, 10 percent in other services, 7 percent in education and training and 7 percent in rental, hire and real estate services.&lt;ref name=FA2016/&gt; 

Franchising in Australia commenced in a significant way in the early 1970s under the influence of the franchised US fast food systems such as [[KFC]], [[Pizza Hut]], and [[McDonald's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Franchising: An Introduction|url=https://www.franchise.org.au/franchising--an-introduction.html|website=Franchise Council Of Australia|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was however underway prior to this and a decade earlier in 1960 [[Leslie Joseph Hooker]], considered a pioneer of franchising, created Australia’s first national real estate agency network of [[LJ Hooker|Hooker]] real estate agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=L J Hooker, the man behind the brand|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/lifematters/lj-hooker-the-man-behind-the-brand/3007464|website=ABC|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LJ Hooker's Heritage, History and Brand|url=https://www.ljhooker.com.au/about-us/lj-hookers-heritage-history-and-brand|website=LJ Hooker|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, franchising is regulated by the Franchising Code of Conduct, a mandatory [[code of conduct]] concluded under the [[Trade Practices Act 1974]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2008C00090%7Ctitle=Trade|title=Federal Register of Legislation – Australian Government|website=Legislation.gov.au|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ACCC regulates the Franchising Code of Conduct, which is a mandatory industry code that applies to the parties to a franchise agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2014L01472 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150607140933/http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2014L01472 |archive-date=2015-06-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This code requires franchisors to produce a disclosure document which must be given to a prospective franchisee at least 14 days before the franchise agreement is entered into.

The code also regulates the content of franchise agreements, for example in relation to marketing funds, a [[Standstill period|cooling-off period]], termination, and the [[resolution of disputes]] by [[mediation]].

==== Franchising code of conduct ====

On 1 January 2015, the old Franchising Code was repealed and replaced with a new [https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2014L01472 Franchising Code of Conduct]. The new Code applies to conduct on or after 1 January 2015.

'''The new Code:'''
* introduces an obligation under the Code for parties to act in good faith in their dealings with one another
* introduces financial penalties and infringement notices for serious breaches of the Code
* requires franchisors to provide prospective franchisees with a short information sheet outlining the risks and rewards of franchising
* requires franchisors to provide greater transparency in the use of and accounting for money used for marketing and advertising and to set up a separate marketing fund for marketing and advertising fees
* requires additional disclosure about the ability of the franchisor and a franchisee to sell online
* prohibits franchisors from imposing significant capital expenditure except in limited circumstances.

These are significant changes and it is important that franchisors, franchisees and potential franchises understand their rights and responsibilities under the Code.

For further information about the changes to the Code, please see the updated Franchisor Compliance Manual and the Franchisee Manual.

The Code explanatory materials are available from the ComLaw website (link is external).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.accc.gov.au/business/industry-codes/franchising-code-of-conduct|title=Franchising Code of Conduct|first=Australian Competition and Consumer|last=Commission|date=11 September 2012|website=Accc.gov.au|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
New Zealand is served by around 423 franchise systems operating 450 brands, giving it the highest proportion of franchises per capita in the world. Despite (or because of) the 2008-09 recession, the total number of franchised units increased by 5.3% from 2009 to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franchise.co.nz/article/view/1167-survey-finds-franchise-sector-br-resilient-growing|title=survey finds franchise sector  RESILIENT &amp; GROWING – Franchise New Zealand|website=Franchise.co.nz|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no separate law covering franchises, so they are covered by normal commercial law. This functions very well in New Zealand and includes law as it applies to contracts, restrictive trade practices, intellectual property, and the law of misleading or deceptive conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franchise.co.nz/article/view/195-legislation-help-or-hindrance-|title=Legislation: Help Or Hindrance?|website=Franchise.co.nz|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Franchise Association of New Zealand introduced a self-regulatory code of practice for its members in 1996. This contains many provisions similar to those of the Australian Franchising Code of Practice legislation, although only around a third of all franchises are members of the association and therefore bound by the code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franchise.co.nz/article/view/117-an-introduction-to-franchising-in-new-zealand|title=an introduction to FRANCHISING IN NEW ZEALAND|website=Franchise.co.nz|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A case of fraud in 2007 perpetrated by a former master franchisee of the country's largest franchise system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franchise.co.nz/article/view/731-green-acres-master-charged-with-fraud|title=Green Acres master charged with fraud|website=Franchise.co.nz|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; led to a review of the need for franchise law by the Ministry of Economic Development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franchise.co.nz/article/view/831|title=Regulation Off the Agenda?|website=Franchise.co.nz|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Zealand Government decided there was no case for franchise-specific legislation at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franchise.co.nz/article/view/838-government-decides-against-franchise-regulation|title=Government Decides AGAINST Franchise Regulation|website=Franchise.co.nz|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was criticised by the opposition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franchise.co.nz/article/view/839-national-s-failure-to-act-on-franchise-regulation-disappointing-|title=National's failure to act on franchise regulation 'disappointing'|website=Franchise.co.nz|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had initiated the review when in power, and the review process was questioned by a leading academic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franchise.co.nz/article/view/1226-franchise-regulation-br-reviewing-the-review|title=franchise regulation REVIEWING THE REVIEW – Franchise New Zealand|website=Franchise.co.nz|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Franchise Association originally supported the positive regulation of the franchise sector&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franchise.co.nz/article/view/576-franchise-association-calls-for-positive-regulation|title=Franchise Association Calls For Positive Regulation|website=Franchise.co.nz|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its eventual submission to the review was in favour of the status quo – self-regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franchise.co.nz/article/view/746-ministry-receives-submissions-on-regulation|title=Ministry receives submissions on regulation|website=Franchise.co.nz|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
By the end of 2012, there were about 2,031 franchise brands operating in Brazil, with approximately 93,000 locations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Geromel|first1=Ricardo|title=Franchising: The Best Way of Investing in Brazil|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ricardogeromel/2012/07/27/franchising-the-best-way-of-investing-in-brazil/#69289e3a51e5|website=Forbes|accessdate=22 July 2017|date=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it one of the largest countries in the world in terms of number of units. Around 11 percent of this total were foreign-based franchisors.

The Brazilian Franchise Law (Law No. 8955 of December 15, 1994) defines the franchise as a system in which the franchisor licenses the franchisee, for a payment, the right to use a trademark or patent along with the right to distribute products or services on an exclusive or semi-exclusive basis.
The provision of a "Franchise Offer Circular", or disclosure document, is mandatory before execution of agreement and is valid for all of the Brazilian territory. Failure to disclose voids the agreement, which leads to refunds and serious payments for damages. The Franchise Law does not distinguish between Brazilian and foreign franchisors. The National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI) is the registering authority. Indispensable documents are a Statement of Delivery (of disclosure documentation) and a Certification of Recording (INPI). The latter is necessary for payments. All sums may not be convertible into foreign currency. Certification may also mean compliance with Brazil's antitrust legislation.

Parties to international franchising may decide to adopt the English language for the document, as long as the Brazilian party knows English fluently and expressly acknowledges that fact, to avoid translation. The registration accomplishes three things:

: * It make the agreement effective against third parties
: * It permits the remittance of payments
: * It qualifies the franchisee for tax deductions.

===Canada===
In Canada, recent legislation mandate better disclosure and fair treatment of franchisees. The regulations also ensure their right to form associations and launch collective action, even if they signed contracts prohibiting such moves.  Franchising in Canada involves 1,300 brands, 80,000 franchise units accounting for about 20% of all consumer spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Milner|first1=Brian|title=Pity the franchisees|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-magazine/why-buying-a-franchise-isnt-as-funor-profitableas-youthink/article37029319/|accessdate=22 November 2017|work=Report on Business|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
China has the most franchises in the world but the scale of their operations is relatively small. Each system in China has an average of 43 outlets, compared to more than 540 in the United States. Together, there are 2600 brands in some 200,000 retail markets. KFC was the most significant foreign entry in 1987 and is widespread &lt;ref name=FIC&gt;[http://www.franchise.org/uploadedFiles/Franchise_Industry/International_Development/franchising%20in%20China.pdf "Franchising in China"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214152311/http://www.franchise.org/uploadedFiles/Franchise_Industry/International_Development/franchising%20in%20China.pdf |date=2010-12-14 }} ''Franchise.org''&lt;/ref&gt; Many franchises are in fact joint-ventures, as at their forming the franchise law was not explicit. For example, [[McDonald's]] is a joint venture. [[Pizza Hut]], [[T.G.I. Friday's|TGIF]], [[Walmart|Wal-mart]], [[Starbucks]] followed a little later. But total franchising is only 3% of retail trade, which seeks foreign franchise growth.

The year 2005 saw the birth of an updated franchise law,&lt;ref name=FIC/&gt; "Measures for the Administration of Commercial Franchise".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pfa.org.ph/images/stories/PFA/PDF/chinafranchiseregulations.pdf]{{dead link|date=October 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous legislation (1997) made no specific inclusion of foreign investors. Today the franchise law is much clearer by virtue of the 2007 law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franchise-update.com/article.php?id=316|title=Franchise update – The Definitive Resource For Franchisors|website=Franchising.com|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a revision of the 2005 law.

The laws are applicable if there are transactions involving a trademark combined with payments with many obligations on the franchisor. The law comprises 42 articles and eight chapters.

Among the franchisor obligations are:
* The FIE (foreign-invested enterprise) franchisor must be registered by the regulator
* The franchisor (or its subsidiary) must have operated at least two company-owned franchises in China (revised to "anywhere") for more than 12 months ("the two-shop, one-year" rule)
* The franchisor must disclose any information requested by the franchisee
* Cross-border franchising, with some caveats, is possible (2007 law).

The franchisor must meet a list of requirements for registration, among which are:
* The standard franchise agreement, working manual and working capital requirements,
* A track-record of operations, and ample ability to supply materials,
* The ability to train the Chinese personnel and provide long-term operational guidance,
* The franchise agreement must have a minimum three-year term.

Among other provisions:
* The franchisor is liable for certain actions of its suppliers
* Monetary and other penalties apply for infractions of the regulations.

The disclosure must take place 20 days in advance. It has to contain:
* Details of the franchisor's experience in the franchised business with scope of business
* Identification of the franchisor's principal officers
* Litigation of the franchisor during the past five years
* Full details about all franchise fees
* The amount of a franchisee's initial investment
* A list of the goods or services the franchisor can supply, and the terms of supply
* The training franchisees will receive
* Information about the trademarks, including registration, usage and litigation
* Demonstration of the franchisor's capabilities to provide training and guidance
* Statistics about existing units, including number, locations and operational results, and the percentage of franchises that have been terminated, and
* An audited financial report and tax information (for an unspecified period of time).

Other elements of this legislation are:
* The franchisee's confidentiality obligations continue indefinitely after termination or expiration of the franchise agreement
* If the franchisee has paid a deposit to the franchisor, it must be refunded on termination of the franchise agreement; upon termination, the franchisee is prohibited from continuing to use the franchisor's marks.

===India===
The franchising of foreign goods and services to India is in its infancy. The first International Exhibition was only held in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franchisebusiness.in/c/Franchising-Association-of-India/Franchise-laws-in-India-n863929|title=Franchise laws in India|website=Franchisebusiness.in|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  India is, however, one of the biggest franchising markets because of its large middle-class of 300 million who are not reticent about spending and because the population is entrepreneurial in character. In a highly diversified society, (see [[Demographics of India]]) McDonald's is a success story despite its fare's differing from that of the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;''Patterns of Internationalization for Developing Country Enterprises  (Alliances and Joint Ventures)'' United Nations Industrial Development Organization, Vienna, 2008, {{ISBN|978-92-1-106443-8}},&lt;/ref&gt;

So far, franchise agreements are covered under two standard commercial laws: the Contract Act 1872 and the Specific Relief Act 1963, which provide for both specific enforcement of covenants in a contract and remedies in the form of damages for breach of contract.

===Kazakhstan===
In Kazakhstan franchise turnover for 2013 is 2.5 billion US$ dollars per year.  Kazakhstan is the leader in Central Asia in the franchising market. There is a special law on franchising which went into effect in 2002. There are more than 300 franchise systems and the number of franchised outlets approaches 2000.&lt;ref&gt;B.Kissikov  [http://www.kazfranch.kz "Franchising in Kazakhstan"], Kazakhstan Franchise Association&lt;/ref&gt; Kazakhstan franchising began with the emergence of a "Coca-Cola" factory, opened to sublicense a Turkish licensor of the same brand.  The plant was built in 1994. Other brands that are also present in Kazakhstan through the franchise system include Pepsi, Hilton, Marriott, Intercontinental, and Pizza Hut.

===Europe===
Franchising has grown rapidly in Europe in recent years, but the industry is largely unregulated.  Unlike the United States, the European Union has not adopted a uniform franchise law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:31988R4087|title=EUR-Lex – 31988R4087 – EN – EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only six of the 28 member states have a pre-contractual disclosure law. They are France (1989), Spain (1996), Romania  (1997), Italy (2004) Sweden ( 2004) and Belgium (2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peralaw.com/franchise_disclosure.html|title=Franchise Disclosure Laws in the European Union|website=Peralaw.com|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estonia and Lithuania have franchise laws that impose mandatory terms on franchise agreements.  In Spain there is also mandatory registration on a public registry. Although they have no franchise specific laws, Germany and those countries with a legal system based upon that of Germany, such as Austria, Greece and Portugal, probably impose the greatest regulatory burden on franchisors due to their tendency to treat franchisees as quasi consumers in certain circumstances and the willingness of the judiciary to use the concept of good faith to make pro-franchisee decisions. In the UK, the recent {{when|date=February 2015}} Papa John case shows that there is also a  need for pre-contractual disclosure and the Yam Seng case shows that there is a duty of good faith in franchise relationships.

The European Franchising Federation's Code of Ethics has been adopted by seventeen national franchise associations. However this has no legal force and enforcement by the national associations is neither uniform of rigorous. Commentators like Dr Mark Abell, in his book  "The Law and Regulation of Franchising in the EU" ( Published in 2013 by Edward Elgar {{ISBN|978 1 78195 2207}}) consider this lack of uniformity to be one of the greatest barriers to the franchising realising its potential in the EU.

When adopting a European strategy  it is important that a franchisor takes expert legal advice.  Most often one of the principal tasks in Europe is to find retail space, which is not so significant a factor in the USA. This is where the franchise broker, or the master franchisor, plays an important role. Cultural factors are also relevant, as local populations tend to be heterogeneous.

====France====
France is one of Europe's largest markets. Similar to the United States, it has a long history of franchising, dating back to the 1930s. Growth came in the 1970s. The market is considered difficult for outside franchisors because of cultural characteristics, yet McDonald's and Century 21 are found everywhere. There are some 30 U.S. firms involved in franchising in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franchise.org/franchise-news-detail.aspx?id=33190|title=France Serves as a Gateway to Europe – International Franchise Association|website=Franchise.org|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no government agencies regulating franchises. The Loi Doubin Law of 1989 was the first European franchise disclosure law. Combined with Decree No. 91-337, it regulates disclosure, although the decree also applies to any person who provides to another person a corporate name, trademark or trade name or other business arrangements.  The law applies to "exclusive or quasi-exclusive territory". The disclosure document must be delivered at least 20 days before the execution of the agreement or any payments are made.

The specific and important disclosures to be made are:&lt;ref name=EUFD&gt;[http://www.peralaw.com/EU_Franchise_Disclosure.html EU Franchise Disclosure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527213507/http://www.peralaw.com/EU_Franchise_Disclosure.html |date=2014-05-27 }} ''peralaw.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

#  The date of the founding of the franchisor's enterprise and a summary of its business history and all information necessary to assess the business experience of the franchisor, including bankers,
#  A description of the local market for the goods or services,
#  The franchisor's financial statements for the previous two years,
#  A list of all other franchisees currently in the network,
#  All franchisees who have left the network during the preceding year, whether by termination or non-renewal, and
#  The conditions for renewal, assignment, termination and the scope of exclusivity.

Initially, there was some uncertainty whether any
breach of the provisions of the Doubin Law would
enable the franchisee to walk away from the contract.
However, the French supreme court (Cour de cassation)
eventually ruled that agreements should only be
annulled where missing or incorrect information
affected the decision of the franchisee to enter into the
agreement. The burden of proof is on the franchisee.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ffw.com/pdf/Franchise-disclosure-in-Europe.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710235841/http://www.ffw.com/pdf/Franchise-disclosure-in-Europe.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=10 July 2011|title=Wayback Machine|date=10 July 2011|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dispute settlement features are only incorporated in some European countries. By not being rigorous, franchising is encouraged.

====Italy====
Under Italian law franchise  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurofranchiselawyers.com/pdf/Comparative_Table_08_06_09%20printable.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710204622/http://www.eurofranchiselawyers.com/pdf/Comparative_Table_08_06_09%20printable.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-10 |df= }} ''EuroFranchiseLawyers.com''&lt;/ref&gt; is defined as an arrangement between two financially independent parties where a franchisee is granted, in exchange for a consideration, the right to market goods and services under particular trademarks.  In addition, articles dictate the form and content of the franchise agreement and define the documents that must be made available 30 days prior to execution. The franchisor must disclose:

:a)  A summary of the franchise activities and operations,
:b)  A list of franchisees currently operating in the franchise system in Italy,
:c)  Year-by-year details of the changes in the number of franchisees for the previous three years in Italy,
:d)  A summary of any court or arbitral proceedings in Italy related to the franchise system, and
:e)  If requested by the franchisee, copies of franchisor's balance sheets for the previous three years, or since start-up if that period is shorter.

====Norway====
There are no specific laws regulating franchising in Norway. However, the Norwegian Competition Act section 10 prohibits cooperation which may prevent, limit or diminish the competition. This may also apply to vertical cooperation such as franchising..

====Russia====
In Russia, under chapter 54 of the Civil Code (passed 1996), franchise agreements are invalid unless written and registered, and franchisors cannot set standards or limits on the prices of the franchisee's goods. Enforcement of laws and resolution of contractual disputes is a problem:{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} [[Dunkin' Donuts]] chose to terminate its contract with Russian franchisees who were selling vodka and meat patties contrary to their contracts, rather than pursue legal remedies.&lt;ref&gt;Anttonen, Noora, Mika Tuunanen, Ilan Alon (2005), "The International Business Environments of Franchising in Russia," Academy of Marketing Science Review, (5), 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spain====
The legal definition of franchising in Spain is an activity in which an undertaking, the franchisor, grants to another party, the franchisee, for a specific market and in exchange for financial compensation (either direct, indirect or both), the right to exploit an owned system to commercialize products or services already exploited by the franchisor with enough success and experience.

The Spanish Retail Trading Act regulates franchising.&lt;ref&gt;The offer and sale of franchises are governed in Spain by the Retail Trade Act 7/1996 of January 15 as amended by [http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2010/03/02/pdfs/BOE-A-2010-3365.pdf Act 1/2010 of March 1]. Particularly Article 62 is applicable to franchise agreements. The Act is completed by the [http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2010/03/13/pdfs/BOE-A-2010-4175.pdf Royal Decree 210/2010 of February 26 on Franchise Agreements].&lt;/ref&gt; The contents of the franchise must include, at least:
* The use of a common name or brand or any other intellectual property right and a uniform presentation of the premises or the transport means included in the agreement.
* The communication by the franchisor to the franchise of certain technical knowledge or substantial and singular know-how that has to be owned by the franchisor, and
* Technical or commercial assistance or both, provided by the franchisor to the franchisee during the agreement, without prejudice to any supervision faculty to which the parties could freely agree in the contract.

In Spain, the franchisor submits the disclosure information 20 days prior to signing the agreement or prior to any payment made by the franchisee to the franchisor. Franchisors are to disclose to the potential franchisee specific information in writing. This information has to be true and not misleading and include:
* Identification of the franchisor;
* Justification of ownership or license for use of any trademark or similar sign and judicial claims affecting them as well as the duration of the license;
* General description of the sector in which the franchise operates;
* Experience of the franchisor;
* Contents and characteristics of the franchise and its exploitation;
* Structure and extension of the network in Spain;
* Essential elements of the franchise agreement.

Franchisors (with some exceptions) should be registered in the Franchisors' Register and provide the requested information. According to the regulation in force in 2010 this obligation has to be met within three months after the start of its activities in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;See also Spain Chapter of ''[http://www.GettingTheDealThrough.com Getting the Deal Through. Franchise 2011]'' by [http://www.advocatia.net/profesional.asp?id=2 Ignacio Alonso]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Turkey====

Franchising is a [[sui generis]] contract which bears the characteristics of several explicitly regulated contracts such as; agency, sales contract and so forth. The regulations concerning these kinds of contracts in Turkish Commercial Code and in Turkish Code of Obligations are applied to franchising. Franchising is described in doctrine and has several essential components such as; the independence of the franchisee from the franchisor, the use of know-how and the uniformity of product and services, standard use of the brand and logo, payment of a royalty fee, increasement of sales by the franchisee and continuity.
Franchising may be for a determined or undetermined period of time. The undetermined one can only be annulled either by a notice before a reasonable amount of time or by a just cause. The franchising agreement with a determined time period ends within the end of the time period if not specified otherwise in the agreement. However, termination based on just cause is also foreseen for franchising agreement with a determined time period.

====United Kingdom====
In the United Kingdom there are no franchise-specific laws; franchises are subject to the same laws that govern other businesses.&lt;ref&gt;However the recent Pappa Johns case shows that the courts will expect clear disclosure of relevant facts by the franchisor before the franchisee signs up and the recent Yam Seng  case clearly establishes that the franchise relationship involves a duty of good faith. The Trading Schemes Act also regulates Multi tier franchises  [http://www.selectyourfranchise.com/franchise-blog/2009/10/franchise-agreements-subject-to-european-code-of-ethics/ Franchise agreements subject to European Code of ethics] (blog)&lt;/ref&gt; There is some self-regulation through the British Franchise Association (BFA).

There are a number franchise businesses which are not members of the BFA and many which do not meet the BFA membership criteria. Part of the BFA's role in self-regulation is to work with franchisors through the application process and recommend changes which will lead to the franchise business meeting BFA standards.  A number of businesses that refer to themselves as franchises do not conform to the BFA Code of Ethics are therefore excluded from membership.

On 22 May 2007, hearings were held in the UK Parliament concerning citizen-initiated petitions for special regulation of franchising by the government of the UK due to losses incurred by citizens who had invested in franchises. The Minister of Industry, Margaret Hodge, conducted hearings but saw no need for any government regulation of franchising with the advice that government regulation of franchising might lull the public into a false sense of security. Mr Mark Prisk MP suggested that the costs of such regulation to the franchisee and franchisor could be prohibitive and would in any case provide a system which mirrored the work already being completed by the BFA. The Minister of Industry indicated that if due diligence were performed by the investors and the banks, the current laws governing business contracts in the UK offered sufficient protection for the public and the banks. The debate also made reference to the self-regulatory function performed by the BFA recognizing that the association "punched above its weight".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Daily Hansard |date=22 May 2007 |pages= 363WH; [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070522/halltext/70522h0001.htm part 1], [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070522/halltext/70522h0002.htm part 2], [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070522/halltext/70522h0003.htm part 3] |title=Franchise Industry|nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[Isaac Singer]], who made improvements to an existing model of a sewing machine in the 1850s, began one of the first franchising efforts in the United States, followed later by [[Coca-Cola]], [[Western Union]],  etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/encyclopedia/For-Gol/Franchising.html|title=Franchising – benefits|website=Referenceforbusiness.com|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by agreements between automobile manufacturers and dealers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefranchiseking.com/issac-singer-the-first-franchise |title=It's Issac Singer's Fault |author= |publisher='The Franchise King' |page= |date= |accessdate=October 28, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern franchising came to prominence with the rise of franchise-based food service establishments. In 1932, Howard Deering Johnson established the first modern restaurant franchise based on his successful Quincy, Massachusetts [[Howard Johnson's]] restaurant founded in the late 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, kolin chakma.[https://archive.is/20120715222511/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_n4_v32/ai_20199526 Foodservice's theory of evolution: Survival of the fittest] (1998).

The growth in franchising accelerated in the 1930s when such chains as [[Howard Johnson's]] started to franchise motels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Franchising: A Brief History|url=http://www.wdfi.org/fi/securities/franchise/history.htm|website=State of Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions|accessdate=22 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730213741/http://www.wdfi.org/fi/securities/franchise/history.htm|archive-date=2017-07-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1950s saw a boom in franchise chains in conjunction with the development of the U.S. Interstate Highway System and the growing popularity of [[fast food]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.franchise-law.com/franchise-law-overview/a-brief-history-of-franchising.shtml#|title=A Brief History of Franchising – American Franchise Attorney {{!}} Washington D.C., U.S. {{!}} Franchise Law|website=Franchise-law.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] has oversight of franchising, rather than the U.S. [[Securities and Exchange Commission]]. The FTC administrates oversight via the FTC Franchise Rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/os/fedreg/2007/march/070330franchiserulefrnotice.pdf#page=102|title=Disclosure Requirements and Prohibitions Concerning Franchising &amp; Disclosure Requirements Concerning Business Opportunities – 16 CFR Parts 436 and 437|website=Ftc.gov|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FTC requires that the franchisee be furnished with a [[Franchise Disclosure Document]] (FDD) by the franchisor at least fourteen days before money changes hands or a franchise agreement is signed. The final agreement is always a negotiated document setting forth fees and other terms. Whereas elements of the disclosure may be available from third parties, only that provided by the franchisor can be depended upon. The U.S. Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD) is lengthy (300–700 pp +) and detailed (see Uniform Franchise Offering Circular (UFOC) for elements of disclosure), and generally requires audited financial statements from the franchisor in a particular format, except in some circumstances, such as where a franchisor is new. It must include such data as the names, addresses and telephone numbers of the franchisees in the licensed territory (who may be contacted and consulted before negotiations), estimate of total franchise revenues and franchisor profitability.

Individual states may require the FDD to contain their own specific requirements, but the requirements in state disclosure documents must be in compliance with the federal rule that governs federal regulatory policy. There is no [[private right of action]] of action under the FTC rule for franchisor violation of the rule, but fifteen or more of the states have passed statutes that provide this right of action to franchisees when fraud can be proven under these special statutes. The majority of franchisors have inserted mandatory arbitration clauses into their agreements with their franchisees, some of which the U.S. Supreme Court has dealt with.

There is no federal registry of franchises or any federal filing requirements for information. States are the primary collectors of data on franchising companies and enforce laws and regulations regarding their presence and their spread in their jurisdictions.

Where the franchisor has many partners, the agreement may take the shape of a business format franchise – an agreement that is identical for all franchisees.

==Social franchises==
In recent years, the idea of franchising has been picked up by the [[social enterprise]] sector, which hopes to simplify and expedite the process of setting up new businesses. A number of business ideas, such as soap making, wholefood retailing, aquarium maintenance, and hotel operation have been identified as suitable for adoption by social firms employing disabled and disadvantaged people.

The most successful examples are probably the ''Kringwinkel'' second-hand shops employing 5,000 people in Flanders, franchised by KOMOSIE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.komosie.be/|title=Home – Komosie|website=Komosie.be|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[CAP Markets]], a steadily growing chain of 100 neighbourhood [[supermarket]]s in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cap-markt.de|title=CAP-Markt: CAP Märkte|website=Cap-markt.de|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Hotel Tritone in [[Trieste]], which inspired the Le Mat social franchise, now active in Italy and Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lemat.it/en/the-brand/le-mat-europe|title=Le Mat Europe – Pagine Statiche – Le Mat Europe|website=Lemat.it|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social franchising]] also refers to a technique used by governments and aid donors to provide essential clinical health services in the developing world.

Social Franchise Enterprises objective is to achieve development goals by creating self sustainable activities by providing services and goods in un-served areas. They use the Franchise Model characteristics to deliver Capacity Building, Access to Market and Access to Credit/Finance.&lt;ref&gt;Alvaro Hidalgo,''[http://www.wattjet.com/pdf/SocialFranchiseEntreprise.pdf%20 The Franchise as a Development tool] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513011056/http://www.wattjet.com/pdf/SocialFranchiseEntreprise.pdf |date=2014-05-13 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Third-party logistics franchising==
[[Third-party logistics]] has become an increasingly more popular franchise opportunity due the quickly growing transportation industry &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/trucking-industry-infographic-2013-4|title=Trucking Industry Infographic – Business Insider|date=9 April 2013|work=Business Insider|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and low cost franchising.  In 2012, ''Inc. Magazine'' ranked three [[logistics and transportation]] companies in the top 100 fastest growing companies in the annual Inc. 5000 rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inc.com/inc5000/list/2012/industry/logistics-transportation|title=Top Logistics &amp; Transportation Companies on the Inc. 5000 |website=Inc.com|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Event franchising==
Event franchising is the duplication of public [[media event|events]] in other geographical areas, retaining the original [[brand]] ([[logo]]), mission, concept and format of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kissikov Beknur |title=Franchising |date= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As in classic franchising, event franchising is built on precisely copying successful events. An example of event franchising is the [[World Economic Forum]], also known as the [[Davos]] forum, which has regional event franchisees in China, Latin America, etc. Likewise, the alter-globalist [[World Social Forum]] has launched many national events. [[When the Music Stops (dating service)|When The Music Stops]] is an example of an events franchise in the UK, in this case, running [[speed dating]] and singles events.

==Home-based franchises==
The franchising or duplication of another firm's successful [[home business|home-based business]] model is referred to as a home-based franchise. Home-based franchises are becoming popular as they are considered to be an easy way to start a business as they may provide a low barrier for entry into [[entrepreneurship]]. It may cost little to start a home-based franchise, but experts say that "the work is no less hard."&lt;ref name=Inc.com&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.inc.com/guides/2010/05/start-home-based-franchise.html |title=How to Start a Home-Based Franchise |author=Issie Lapowsky |publisher=''Mansueto Ventures'' |magazine=[[Inc.

'''Francesco Vittorio 'Franco' Ambrosio''' (18 September 1932 – 15 April 2009) was a businessman from [[Italy]] who financed [[Formula One]] racing teams [[Arrows Grand Prix International|Arrows]] and [[Shadow Racing Cars|Shadow]] in the late 1970s. He became a multi-millionaire through wheat trading, primarily for pasta production, and built up a large business empire. He was involved in financial scandals and served jail terms. He was murdered in a robbery at his home near [[Naples]] in 2009.

==Background==
Francesco Vittorio Ambrosio was born on 18 September 1932 in San Gennarello, a neighbourhood close to [[Mount Vesuvius]] in the [[Ottaviano]] ''[[frazione]]'' of [[Naples]].

==Career==
At the age of 18 he joined a wheat milling business near Naples which he rose to lead within 10 years. He renamed the business Italgrani [[Joint-stock company#Italy|SpA]] in 1960.&lt;ref name="lastampa"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lastampa.it/redazione/cmsSezioni/cronache/200904articoli/42828girata.asp |title=La scheda: chi era Franco Ambrosio (File: Who was Franco Ambrosio)|publisher=La Stampa newspaper|language=IT | accessdate=2010-04-23|date=2009-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its huge financial growth led to his nickname 'the king of grain' (Italian: ''il re del grano''). Italgrani expanded rapidly in the 1980s into Africa, Australia, and the United States. Ambrosio created a holding company comprising up to 50 companies, importing and exporting various commodities. The businesses gradually unravelled in the 1990s as his involvements in several financial scandals were discovered.&lt;ref name="ilsole"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/SoleOnLine4/Italia/2009/04/ambrosio-finisce-sangue-avventura-re-cereali.shtml |title=Finisce nel sangue l'avventura dell'ultimo re dei cereali (The adventures of the last king of cereals end in blood)|publisher=Il Sole 24 Ore newspaper |language=IT | accessdate=2010-04-23|date=2009-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He declared the Italgrani company bankrupt in 1999.

==Formula One==
Ambrosio sponsored the [[Shadow Racing Cars|Shadow]] Formula One team in 1977, backing the Italian driver [[Renzo Zorzi]].&lt;ref name="grandprix"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/drv-zorren.html |title=GP Encyclopedia: Renzo Zorzi|publisher=Inside F1, Inc. |accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gparchive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.crash.net/season_driver.asp?season=1975&amp;driver_id=12149|title=Grand Prix Archive: Renzo Zorzi|publisher=Crash Media Group Ltd.|accessdate=2010-04-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723060323/http://stats.crash.net/season_driver.asp?season=1975&amp;driver_id=12149|archivedate=2011-07-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zorzi's lack of success led Ambrosio to have him replaced by the more promising [[Riccardo Patrese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Simon|title=Lunch with...

The first Arrows car was named FA1, using Ambrosio's initials.

==Convictions and imprisonment==

Franco Ambrosio was arrested several times for fraud and financial irregularities.&lt;ref name="silos"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ragone |first1=Ottavio |title=Dai silos di Napoli alla contuista degli Usa |url=http://www.repubblica.it/online/cronaca/ambrosio/personaggio/personaggio.html |website=[[La Repubblica]] |publisher=GEDI Gruppo Editoriale S.p.A. |accessdate=25 October 2018 |language=IT |date=11 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980 he was jailed in [[Lugano]] for complicity in a fraud scheme involving the [[Banco di Roma]] in Switzerland. Ambrosio made two unsuccessful escape attempts - in November 1981 by bribing a guard and hiding in a garbage bin, and in August 1982.&lt;ref name="emissione"&gt;[http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1994/giugno/19/emissione_titoli_falsi_carcere_Franco_co_0_94061915727.shtml ''Emissione di titoli falsi: in carcere Franco Ambrosio''], ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', 19 June 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

His sentence was for five years, but he was released in February 1983 after serving three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Valentino|first1=Piero|title=Torna In Cella Ambrosio L' Ex Miliardario D' Assalto|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1985/12/12/torna-in-cella-ambrosio-ex-miliardario.html|website=La Reppublica|publisher=Gruppo Editoriale L’Espresso Spa|accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1993 he was jailed for money laundering and receiving stolen goods in the [[mani pulite|Enimont]] corruption scandal, in which a large chemical company was found to have bribed politicians in return for tax relief.&lt;ref name=silos/&gt;

In June 1994 he was arrested for attempted bribery, and fraud in declaring bankruptcy in claiming EU subsidies for non-existent grain shipments to Algeria.&lt;ref name="italymag"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.italymag.co.uk/italy/campania/grain-king-brutally-murdered-naples-wife |title='Grain king' brutally murdered in Naples with wife|publisher=Italy Magazine | accessdate=2010-04-23|date=2009-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 January 2001, he was arrested for fraud and false accounting.

At the time of his death Ambrosio was due in court to appeal against a nine-year prison sentence for false accounting when declaring the bankruptcy of Italgrani.&lt;ref name="retesei"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retesei.com/2009/23153.html |title=Campania.

==Death==
On the morning of 15 April 2009 his eldest son Massimo discovered the bodies of Ambrosio and his wife Giovanna Sacco in their seaside villa in [[Posillipo]], Naples.&lt;ref name="ilgiornale"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/interni/napoli_assassinato_re_grano_la_polizia_ladri_stranieri_e_balordi/franco_ambrosio-re_grano-omicidio_ambrosio-italgrani-cronaca/16-04-2009/articolo-id=343994 |title=Napoli, assassinato il re del grano La polizia: "Ladri stranieri e balordi" (The king of grain is murdered in Naples.

There were signs of a robbery: a broken window, possessions scattered and valuables missing. The next day three Romanian immigrants, including one who had worked as his gardener, were arrested and charged with the murder.&lt;ref name="ilgiornale2"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/interni/ambrosio_presi_3_romeni_il_killer_e_lex_giardiniere/cronaca-omicidio-massacro-posillipo-re_grano-franco_ambrosio-arresti/17-04-2009/articolo-id=344277 |title=Ambrosio, presi 3 romeni: il killer è l'ex giardiniere (Ambrosio, 3 Romanians held: the killer is the former gardener)|publisher=Il Giornale newspaper | accessdate=2011-09-23|date=2009-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Napoli, re del grano ucciso con la moglie |url=http://www.repubblica.it/2009/04/sezioni/cronaca/coniugi-posillipo/coniugi-posillipo/coniugi-posillipo.html |website=La Repubblica |publisher=Gruppo Editoriale L’Espresso Spa |accessdate=16 October 2018 |language=IT |date=15 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:La Boqueria.JPG|thumb|The term, 'marketing', comes from the Latin, 'mercatus', meaning a marketplace. Pictured: [[La Boqueria]], [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]]]]

[[File:The Moorish Bazaar.jpg|thumb|Scholars have found evidence of marketing practices in the marketplaces of antiquity. Pictured: The Moorish Bazaar, painting by [[Edwin Lord Weeks]], 1873]]

The study of the '''history of marketing''', as a discipline, is meaningful because it helps to define the baselines upon which change can be recognised and understand how the discipline evolves in response to those changes.&lt;ref name=handbook&gt;
{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Brian D. G. |author2=Shaw, Eric H.|others=Weitz, Barton A.; Wensley, Robin (editors)|title=Handbook of Marketing|publisher=Sage|year=2006
|pages=582 pages|chapter=A History of Marketing Thought|isbn=1-4129-2120-1}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of marketing has been known for millennia, but the term "marketing" used to describe commercial activities buying and selling a products or services came into popular use in the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;English Language and Usage, http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/335201/etymology-of-marketing-how-when-did-it-change-meaning&lt;/ref&gt; The study of the history of marketing as an academic field emerged in the early twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Jones, D.G. and Shaw, E.H, "The History of Marketing Thought," in ''Handbook of Marketing,'' Weitz, R. and Wensley, R. (eds), London, UK, 2003,  p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

Marketers tend to distinguish between the history of marketing practice and the history of marketing thought:

: (a) the ''history of marketing practice'' refers to an investigation into the ways that marketing has been practiced; and how those practices have evolved over time as they respond to changing socio-economic conditions
: (b) the ''history of marketing thought'' refers to an examination of the ways that marketing has been studied and taught

Although the history of marketing thought and the history of marketing practice are distinct fields of study, they intersect at different junctures.&lt;ref name="Hollander et al. (2005)"&gt;
{{cite journal|last=Hollander|first=Stanley C. 
 |author2=Rassuli, Kathleen M. |author3=Jones, D. G. Brian |author4=Dix, Laura Farlow |year=2005|title=Periodization in Marketing History
|journal=Journal of Macromarketing|volume= 25|issue= 1|pages= 32–41|doi=10.1177/0276146705274982}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Marketing practitioners engage in innovative practices that capture the attention of marketing scholars who codify and disseminate such practices. At the same time, marketing academics often develop new research methods or theories that are subsequently adopted by practitioners. Thus developments in marketing theory inform marketing practice and vice versa. The history of marketing will remain incomplete if one disassociates academia from practitioners.&lt;ref name="Hollander et al. (2005)" /&gt;

The publication, in 1960, of Robert Keith's article, "The Marketing Revolution", was a pioneering work in the study of the history of marketing practice.&lt;ref&gt;Keith, R.  J., "The Marketing Revolution," ''
Journal of Marketing,''  Vol. 24, No. 1; Jul 1959-Apr 1960, pp 35-38&lt;/ref&gt; And, in 1976, the publication of Robert Bartel's book, ''The History of Marketing Thought,'' marked a turning-point in the understanding of how marketing theory evolved since it first emerged as a separate discipline around the turn of last century.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Bartels, R., ''The History of Marketing Thought,'' Columbus, Ohio, Grid, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology==

According to etymologists, the term 'marketing' first appeared in dictionaries in the sixteenth century where it referred to the process of buying and selling at a market.&lt;ref&gt;Etymology Dictionary Online, http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=marketing&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary definition of 'marketing' as a process of moving goods from producer to consumer with an emphasis on sales and advertising first appeared in dictionaries in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/marketing#English&lt;/ref&gt; The term, marketing, is a derivation of the Latin word, ''mercatus'' meaning market-place or merchant. &lt;ref&gt;Dictionary.com, http://www.dictionary.com/browse/marketing&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marketing history: an overview==

[[File:Turkey.Bodrum044.jpg|thumb|In pre-literate societies, the distinctive shape of amphora served some of the functions of a label, communicating information about region of origin, the name of the producer and may have carried product quality claims]]

Historians of marketing tend to fall into two distinct branches of marketing history - ''the history of marketing practice'' and ''the history of marketing thought.'' These branches are often deeply divided and have very different roots. The history of marketing practice is grounded in the management and marketing disciplines, while the history of marketing thought is grounded in economic and cultural history. This means that the two branches ask very different types of research questions and employ different research tools and frameworks.&lt;ref&gt;Berghoff, H., Scranton. P. and Spiekermann , U. (eds), ''The Rise of Marketing and Market Research: Worlds of Consumption,'' [German Historical Society],  NY, Palgrave Macmillan, 2012, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians of marketing have undertaken considerable investigation into the emergence of marketing practice, yet there is little agreement about when marketing first began.&lt;ref&gt;Enright, M., "Marketing and Conflicting Dates for its Emergence: Hotchkiss, Bartels, the ‘Fifties School’ and Alternative Accounts," ''Journal of Marketing Management,'' Vol. 18, 2002, pp  445-461&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers argue that marketing practices can be found in antiquity &lt;ref&gt;Dixon, D.F.,  "Medieval  Macromarketing  Thought," In ''Macromarketing,''George Fisk and Phillip White (eds), pp 59–69. Boulder, University of Colorado Press, 1980; Nevett, T., "Historical Investigation and the Practice of Marketing," ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 55, No. 3, 1991, pp 13–24; Rahul Oka &amp; Chapurukha M. Kusimba, "The Archaeology of Trading Systems, Part 1: Towards a New Trade Synthesis," The Archaeology of Trading Systems, Part 1: Towards a New Trade Synthesis," ''Journal of Archaeological Research,'' Vol. 16, pp 339–395; Bar-Yosef, O., "The Upper Paleolithic Revolution," ''Annual Review of Anthropology,'' Vol. 31, pp 363–393; Alberti, M. E., "Trade and Weighing Systems in the Southern Aegean from the Early Bronze Age to the Iron Age: How Changing Circuits Influenced Glocal Measures," in Molloy, B. (ed.), ''Of Odysseys and Oddities: Scales and Modes of Interaction Between Prehistoric Aegean Societies and their Neighbours,'' [Sheffield Studies in Aegean Archaeology], Oxford, Oxbow, (E-Book), 2016; Berger, A., ''Marketing and American Consumer Culture: A Cultural Studies Analysis,'' Springer, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; while others suggest that marketing, in its modern form, emerged in conjunction with the rise of consumer culture in seventeenth and eighteenth century Europe &lt;ref&gt;Southerton, D. (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Consumer Culture,'' Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage, 2011 p. xxx&lt;/ref&gt; while yet other researchers suggest that modern marketing was only fully realised in the decades following the industrial revolution in Britain from where it subsequently spread to Europe and North America.&lt;ref name="Hollander, S.C. 2005, p. 39"&gt;Hollander, S.C., Rassuli, K.M. Jones, G.D.B., and Dix, L.F.,  "Periodization in Marketing History," ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol. 25 No. 1, June 2005, p. 39, DOI: 10.1177/0276146705274982&lt;/ref&gt; Hollander and others have suggested that the different dates for the emergence of marketing can be explained by problems surrounding the way that marketing has been defined - whether reference to 'modern marketing' as a planned, programmed repertoire of professional practice including activities such as segmentation, product differentiation, positioning and marketing communications versus 'marketing' as a simple form distribution and exchange.&lt;ref&gt;Enright, M., "Marketing and Conflicting Dates for its Emergence: Hotchkiss, Bartels, the ‘Fifties School’ and Alternative Accounts," ''Journal of Marketing Management,'' Vol. 18, 2002, p. 454-55&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marketing in antiquity===

[[File:Garum Mosaik Pompeji.JPG|thumb|left|Mosaic showing garum container, from the house of Umbricius Scaurus of Pompeii. The inscription which reads "G(ari) F(los) SCO(mbri) SCAURI EX OFFI(CI)NA SCAURI" has been translated as "The flower of garum, made of the mackerel, a product of Scaurus, from the shop of Scaurus"]]

A number of studies have found evidence of advertising, branding, packaging and labelling in antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Maran, J. and Stockhammer, P.W. (eds), ''Materiality and Social Practice: Transformative Capacities of Intercultural Encounters,'' Oxford, UK, Oxbow, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Demirdjian, Z. S.,  "Rise and Fall of Marketing in Mesopotamia: A Conundrum in the Cradle of Civilization," In ''The Future of Marketing's Past: Proceedings of the 12th Annual Conference on Historical Analysis and Research in Marketing,'' Leighton Neilson (ed.), CA, Longman, Association for Analysis and Research in Marketing, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Umbricius Scauras, for example, was a manufacturer of fish sauce (also known as [[garum]]) in Pompeii, circa 35 C.E. Mosaic patterns in the atrium of his house were decorated with images of [[amphora]] bearing his personal brand and quality claims. The mosaic comprises four different amphora, one at each corner of the atrium, and bearing labels as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, J. R. in Dobbins, J. J. and Foss, P.

The reputation of Scauras' fish sauce was known to be of very high quality across the Mediterranean and its reputation travelled as far away as modern France.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, R.I., "A Personalised Floor Mosaic from Pompeii," ''American Journal of Archaeology,'' Vol. 88, No. 4 (Oct., 1984), DOI: 10.2307/504744, pp. 557-566, Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/504744&lt;/ref&gt;  Curtis has described this mosaic as a "an advertisement... and a rare, unequivocal example of a motif inspired by a patron, rather than by the artist." &lt;ref&gt;Curtis, R.I., "A Personalized Floor Mosaic from Pompeii," ''American Journal of Archaeology,'' Vol. 88, No. 4, p. 557&lt;/ref&gt; In Pompeii and nearby Herculaneum, archaeological evidence also points to evidence of branding and labelling in relatively common use. Wine jars, for example, were stamped with names, such as  "Lassius" and "L. Eumachius;" probably references to the name of the producer. Carbonised loaves of bread, found at Herculaneum, indicate that some bakers stamped their bread with the producer's name.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, M., ''The Fires of Vesuvius: Pompeii Lost and Found,'' Harvard University Press, 2008; See Chapter 5, "Earning a Living: Baker, Banker and Garum Maker,"&lt;/ref&gt;

David Wengrow has argued that branding became necessary following the urban revolution in ancient Mesopotamia in the 4th century BCE, when large-scale economies started mass-producing commodities such as alcoholic drinks, cosmetics and textiles. These ancient societies imposed strict forms of quality control over commodities, and also needed to convey value to the consumer through branding. Producers began by attaching simple stone seals to products which over time were transformed into clay seals bearing impressed images, often associated with the producer's personal identity thus giving the product a personality.&lt;ref&gt;Wengrow, D., "Prehistories of Commodity Branding," ''Current Anthropology,''Vol. 49, No. 1, 2008, pp. 7-34&lt;/ref&gt;

Diana Twede has argued that the "consumer packaging functions of protection, utility and communication have been necessary whenever packages were the object of transactions" (p.&amp;nbsp;107). She has shown that amphoras used in Mediterranean trade between 1500 and 500 BCE exhibited a wide variety of shapes and markings, which provided information for transactions. Systematic use of stamped labels dates from around the fourth century BCE. In a largely pre-literate society, the shape of the amphora and its pictorial markings conveyed information about the contents, region of origin and even the identity of the producer which were understood to convey information about product quality.&lt;ref&gt;Twede, D., "Commercial amphoras: The earliest consumer packages?" ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol. 22, No. 1, 2002, pp 98–108&lt;/ref&gt;  Not all historians agree that these markings can be compared with modern brands or labels. Moore and Reid, for example, have argued that the distinctive shapes and markings in ancient containers should be termed ''proto-brands'' rather than modern brands.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, K. and Reid., S., "The Birth of the Brand: 4000 Years of Branding," ''Business History,'' Vol. 50, 2008. p. 5; 23&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marketing in the Middle Ages===

[[File:Aertsen, Pieter - Market Scene.jpg|thumb|left|Market scene by Pieter Aertsen, c.1550]]

In England and Europe during the Middle Ages, market towns sprang up. Some analysts have suggested that the term, 'marketing,' may have first been used in the context of market towns where the term 'marketing' may have been used by producers to describe the process of carting and selling their produce and wares in market towns. Blintiff has investigated the early Medieval networks of market towns and suggests that by the 12th century there was an upsurge in the number of market towns and the emergence of merchant circuits as traders bulked up surpluses from smaller regional, different day markets and resold them at the larger centralised market towns.&lt;ref&gt;Bintliff, J., "Going to Market in Antiquity," In ''Stuttgarter Kolloquium zur Historischen Geographie des Altertums,'' Eckart Olshausen and Holger Sonnabend (eds), Stuttgart, Franz Steiner, 2002, p.224&lt;/ref&gt;

Braudel and Reynold have made a systematic study of these European market towns between the thirteenth and fifteenth century.  Their investigation shows that in regional districts markets were held once or twice a week, while daily markets were more common in the larger cities and towns. Over time, permanent shops began to open daily and gradually supplanted the periodic markets. Peddlers filled in the gaps in distribution by travelling door-to-door in order to sell produce and wares. The physical market was characterised by transactional exchange, bartering systems were commonplace and the economy was characterised by local trading. Braudel reports that, in 1600, goods travelled relatively short distances - grain 5–10 miles; cattle 40–70 miles; wool and wollen cloth 20–40 miles. However, following the European age of discovery, goods were imported from afar - calico cloth from India, porcelain, silk and tea from China, spices from India and South-East Asia and tobacco, sugar, rum  and coffee from the New World.&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, F. and Reynold, S., ''The Wheels of Commerce: Civilization and Capitalism, 15th to 18th Century,'' Berkely, CA, University of California Press, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bronze printing plate for an advertisement.jpg|thumb|Bronze plate for printing an advertisement for the Liu family needle shop at [[Jinan]], [[Song dynasty]] China. It is considered the world's earliest identified printed advertising medium.]]

Although the rise of consumer culture and marketing in Britain and Europe have been studied extensively, less is known about developments elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Southerton, D. (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Consumer Culture,'' Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage, 2011 p. 888&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, recent research suggests that China exhibited a rich history of early marketing practices; including branding, packaging, advertising and retail signage.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, K. and Reid., S., "The Birth of the Brand: 4000 years of Branding," ''Business History,'' Vol. 50, 2008. pp 419-32.&lt;/ref&gt; From as early as 200 BCE, Chinese packaging and branding was used to signal family, place names and product quality, and the use of government imposed product branding was used between 600 and 900 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Eckhardt, G.M. and Bengtsson. A. "A Brief History of Branding in China," ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol, 30, no. 3, 2010, pp 210-221&lt;/ref&gt; Eckhart and Bengtsson have argued that during the Song Dynasty (960–1127), Chinese society developed a consumerist culture, where a high level of consumption was attainable for a wide variety of ordinary consumers rather than just the elite (p.&amp;nbsp;212). The rise of a consumer culture led to the commercial investment in carefully managed company image, retail signage, symbolic brands, trademark protection and the brand concepts of baoji, hao, lei, gongpin, piazi and pinpai, which roughly equate with Western concepts of family status, quality grading, and upholding traditional Chinese values (p.&amp;nbsp;219). Eckhardt and Bengtsson's analysis suggests that brands emerged in China as a result of the social needs and tensions implicit in consumer culture, in which brands provide social status and stratification. Thus, the evolution of brands in China stands in sharp contrast to the West where manufacturers pushed brands onto the market in order to differentiate, increase market share and ultimately profits (pp 218–219).

===Marketing in seventeenth and eighteenth century Europe===
[[File:Philbrook - Wedgewood (2)crop.jpg|thumb|left|Josiah Wedgewood's 18th century techniques exhibited many of the characteristics of modern marketing]]
Scholars have identified specific instances of marketing practices in England and Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. As trade between countries or regions grew, companies required information on which to base business decisions. Individuals and companies carried out formal and informal research on trade conditions. As early as 1380, Johann [[Fugger]] travelled from Augsburg to Graben in order to gather information on the international textile industry. He exchanged detailed letters on trade conditions in relevant areas.&lt;ref&gt;Nair, S. R., ''Market Research: Text and Cases,'' 2nd ed., Himalaya Publishing House, 2014, p. 21 &lt;Online: www.himpub.com/documents/Chapter873.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1700s British industrial houses were demanding information, that could be used for business decisions. In the early 18th-century, [[Daniel Defoe]], a London merchant, published information on trade and economic resources of England and Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Minto, W., ''Daniel Defoe,'' Tredition Classics, [Project Gutenberg ed.], Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richetti, J., ''The Life of Daniel Defoe: A Critical Biography,''  Malden, MAm Blackwell, 2005, 2015, pp 147-49 and 158-59&lt;/ref&gt; Defoe was a prolific publisher and among his many publications are titles devoted to trade including; ''Trade of Britain Stated,'' 1707; ''Trade of Scotland with France,'' 1713 and  ''The Trade to India Critically and Calmly Considered,'' 1720; all books that were highly popular with merchants and business houses of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Backscheider, P.R., 'Daniel Defoe: His Life,'' Baltimore, Maryland, Johns Hopkins University Press, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; While such activities might now be recognised as marketing research, at that time they were known as 'commercial research' or 'commercial intelligence' and not seen as part of the repertoire of activities that make up contemporary marketing practice.

Other scholars have found evidence of advertising and promotion in eighteenth century France and Italy as well as Britain. Far from being primitive efforts, early advertising showed a high level of sophistication in its execution and abilility to reach mass audiences. &lt;ref&gt;Berg, M. and Clifford, H., "Selling Consumption in the Eighteenth Century Advertising and the Trade Card in Britain and France," ''The Journal of the Social History Society,'' Volume 4, No. 2, 2007, Stable URL: https://dx.doi.org/10.2752/147800307X199001&lt;/ref&gt; In a major review of consumer society, McKendrick, Brewer and Plumb found extensive evidence of eighteenth century English entrepreneurs using 'modern' marketing techniques, including product differentiation, sales promotion and loss leader pricing.&lt;ref&gt;McKendrick, N., Brewer, J. and Plumb . J.H., ''The Birth of a Consumer Society: The Commercialization of Eighteenth Century England,'' London, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; 

English industrialists, [[Josiah Wedgewood]] and [[Matthew Boulton]], are often portrayed as pioneers of modern mass marketing methods.&lt;ref&gt;Tadajewski, M. and Jones, D.G.B., "Historical research in marketing theory and practice: a review essay," ''Journal of Marketing Management,'' Vol. 30, No. 11-12, 2014 [Special Issue: Pushing the Boundaries, Sketching the Future], pp 1239-1291&lt;/ref&gt; Wedgewood was known to have used marketing techniques such as direct mail, travelling salesmen and catalogues in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Flanders, J., "They Broke It," ''New York Times,'' 9 January 2009, &lt;Online:https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/10/opinion/10flanders.html?_r=2&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Josiah Wedgewood's marketing was highly sophisticated and recognisably 'modern' in that he planned production with the sale in mind. &lt;ref&gt;Sassatelli, R., ''Consumer Culture: History, Theory and Politics,'' Sage, 2007, p. 16; &lt;/ref&gt; He carried out serious investigations into the fixed and variable costs of production and recognised that increased production would lead to lower unit costs. He also inferred that selling at lower prices would lead to higher demand and recognised the value of achieving [[Economies of scale|scale economies]] in production. By cutting costs and lowering prices, Wedgewood was able to generate higher overall profits.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, D., "Dinnerware &amp; Cost Accounting? The Story of Josiah Wedgwood: Potter and Cost Accountant," ''HQ FINANCIAL VIEWS,'' Volume I, 1 May–July, 2005, pp 1-3&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, one of Wedgewood's contemporaries, [[Matthew Boulton]], pioneered early mass production techniques and product differentiation at his Soho Manufactory in the 1760s. He also practiced planned obsolescence and understood the importance of 'celebrity marketing' - that is supplying the nobility, often at prices below cost and of obtaining royal patronage, for the sake of the publicity and cudos generated.&lt;ref&gt;Applbaum, K., ''The Marketing Era: From Professional Practice to Global Provisioning,'' Routledge, 2004, p. 126-127&lt;/ref&gt;

Fullerton argues that the practice of market segmentation emerged well before marketers used the notion formally. &lt;ref&gt;Fullerton, R., "Segmentation in Practice: An Overview of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries," in Jones,D.G.B. and Tadajewski,M. (eds), ''The Routledge Companion to Marketing History,'' Routledge, 2016, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Certain strands of evidence suggest that simple examples of market segmentation were evident prior to the 1880s. The business historian, [[Richard S. Tedlow]], argues that any attempt to segment markets prior to 1880 was highly fragmented since the economy was characterised by small, regional suppliers who mostly sold goods on a local or regional basis. &lt;ref&gt;In his oft-cited work, ''New and Improved: The Story of Mass Marketing in America'', Basic Books, N.Y. 1990 pp. 4–12, Richard Tedlow outlines first three stages: fragmentation (prior to 1880), unification and the segmentation (1880-1920); segmentation era (1920s–1980s). In a subsequent work, published three years later, Tedlow and his co-author thought that they had seen evidence of a new trend and added a fourth era, termed Hyper-segmentation (post 1980s); See Tedlow, R.A. and Jones, G., ''The Rise and Fall of Mass Marketing'', Routledge, N.Y., 1993 Ch 2&lt;/ref&gt; When retail shops began to appear from the 15th century, retailers needed to separate the "riff raff" from wealthier customers. Outside the major metropolitan cities, few stores could afford to serve one type of clientele exclusively. However, gradually retail shops introduced innovations that would allow them to separate wealthier customers from the lower classes and peasants. One technique was to have a window opening out onto the street from which customers could be served.  This allowed the sale of goods to the common people, without encouraging them to come inside. Another solution, that came into vogue from the late sixteenth century was to invite favoured customers into a back-room of the store, where goods were permanently on display. Yet another technique that emerged around the same time was to hold a showcase of goods in the shopkeeper's private home for the benefit of wealthier clients. Samuel Pepys, for example, writing in 1660, describes being invited to the home of a retailer to view a wooden jack.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, N.C. and Dannehl, K., ''Perceptions of Retailing in Early Modern England,'' Aldershot, Hampshire, Ashgate, 2007, pp. 155–59&lt;/ref&gt; The eighteenth century English entrepreneurs, [[Josiah Wedgewood]] and [[Matthew Boulton]], both staged expansive showcases of their wares in their private residences or in rented halls.&lt;ref&gt;McKendrick, N., Brewer, J. and Plumb . J.H., ''The Birth of a Consumer Society: The Commercialization of Eighteenth Century England,'' London, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of early marketing segmentation has also been noted across Europe. A study of the German book trade found examples of both product differentiation and market segmentation in the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;Fullerton, R.A., "Segmentation Strategies and Practices in the 19th-Century German Book Trade: A Case Study in the Development of a Major Marketing Technique", in ''Historical Perspectives in Consumer Research: National and International Perspectives,'' Jagdish N.

===Marketing in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries ===
[[File:BourbonStModelT20Nov06Side.jpg|thumb|Henry Ford began manufacturing the mass-produced Model T in 1908. Ford famously said that customers could own a car in any colour as long as it was black.]]

Until the nineteenth century, Western economies were characterised by small regional suppliers who sold goods on a local or regional basis. However, as transportation systems improved from the mid nineteenth century, the economy became more unified allowing companies to distribute standardised, branded goods a national level. This gave rise to a much broader mass marketing mindset. Manufacturers tended to insist on strict standardisation in order to achieve [[Economies of scale|scale economies]] with a view to keeping production costs down and also to achieving [[market penetration]] in the early stages of a product's life cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Tedlow, R.A. and Jones, G., ''The Rise and Fall of Mass Marketing'', Routledge, N.Y., 1993 Ch 2&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ford Model T|Model T Ford]] was an example of a product being manufactured at a price that was affordable for the burgeoning middle classes.

In the early twentieth century, as market size increased, it became more commonplace for manufacturers to produce a variety of models pitched at different quality points designed to meet the needs of various demographic and lifestyle market segments, giving rise to the widespread practice of market segmentation and product differentation.&lt;ref&gt;Tedlow, R., ''New and Improved: The Story of Mass Marketing in America'', Basic Books, N.Y. 1990 pp 4-12&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1902 -1910 George B Waldron, working at Mahin's advertising agency, used tax registers, city directories and census data to show advertisers the proportion of educated versus illiterate consumers and the earning capacity of different occupations in what is believed to be the first example of demographic segmentation of a population.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, D.G.B. and Tadajewski, M. (eds), ''The Routledge Companion to Marketing History,'' Oxon, Routledge, 2016, p. 66; Lockley, L.C., "Notes on the History of Marketing Research", ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 14, No. 5 (Apr., 1950), pp. 733-736 https://www.jstor.org/stable/1246952?seq=1#fndtn-page_scan_tab_contents&lt;/ref&gt; Within little more than a decade, Paul Cherington had developed the 'ABCD' household typology - the first socio-demographic segmentation tool.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, D.G.B. and Tadajewski, M. (eds), ''The Routledge Companion to Marketing History,'' Oxon, Routledge, 2016, p. 71)&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1930s, market researchers such as [[Ernest Dichter]] were carrying out qualitative research into brand purchasers realised that demographic factors alone were unsufficient to explain different marketing behaviour of various user groups. This insight led to the exploration of other factors such as lifestyles, values, attitudes and beliefs in market segmentation and advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson B. S.  and Levy, J., "A History of the Concept of Branding: Practice and Theory", ''Journal of Historical Research in Marketing,'' vol. 4, no. 3, 2012, pp. 347-368; DOI: 10.1108/17557501211252934&lt;/ref&gt;

When Wendell R. Smith published his now classic article, ''Product Differentiation and Market Segmentation as Alternative Marketing Strategies'' in 1956, he noted that he was simply documenting marketing practices that had been observed for some time and which he described as a "natural force".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, W.R., "Product Differentiation and Market Segmentation as Alternative Marketing Strategies," ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 21, No. 1 , 1956, pp. 3–8 and reprinted in ''Marketing Management,'' Vol. 4, No. 3, 1995, pp. 63–65&lt;/ref&gt;  Other theorists agree that Smith was simply codifying implicit knowledge that had been used in marketing and brand management from the early twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Cano, C., "The Recent Evolution of Market Segmentation Concepts and Thoughts Primarily by Marketing Academics," in E. Shaw (ed) ''The Romance of Marketing History,'' Proceedings of the 11th Conference on Historical Analysis and Research in Marketing (CHARM), Boca Ranton, FL, AHRIM, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schwarzkopf, S., "Turning Trade Marks into Brands: how Advertising Agencies Created Brands in the Global Market Place, 1900–1930" CGR Working Paper, Queen Mary University, London, 18 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Haven-MasonHall.jpg|thumb|left|Haven-Mason Hall at the University of Michigan, where the first academic course in marketing was taught]]
As industry grew, the demand for skilled business professionals also grew. To meet this demand, universities began offering courses in commerce, economics and marketing. Marketing, as a discipline, was first taught in universities in the very early twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Maynard, H. H., "Marketing Courses Prior to 1910," ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 5, no. 4, pp 382-384&lt;/ref&gt; However, researchers only became interested in investigating the history of marketing in the mid twentieth century. From the outset, researchers tended to identify two strands of historical research; the history of marketing practice &lt;ref&gt;Keith, R. J., "The Marketing Revolution," ''Journal of Marketing,''  Vol. 24, No. 1; Jul 1959-Apr 1960, pp 35-38&lt;/ref&gt; and the history of marketing thought which was fundamentally concerned with the rise of marketing education and dissecting the way that marketing was taught and studied.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maynard, H. H., "Early Teachers of Marketing," ''Journal of Marketing,''  Vol. 7, No. 2, pp 158-159; Maynard, H. H., Weidler, W. C. &amp; Beckman, T. N., ''Principles of Marketing, New York,  The Ronald Press, 1927&lt;/ref&gt; Early historical studies were primarily descriptive.

==History of marketing practice==

The practice of marketing may have been carried out for millennia, but the modern concept of marketing as a professional practice appears to have emerged the post industrial corporate world.&lt;ref&gt;Southerton, D. (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Consumer Culture,'' Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage, 2011 p. 890&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the studies of specific cultures or time periods, discussed in the preceding section, some historians of marketing have sought to write more general histories of marketing's evolution in the modern era. A key question that has preoccupied researchers is whether it is possible to identify specific orientations or mindsets that inform key periods in marketing's evolution. Marketers disagree about the way that marketing practice has evolved over time.&lt;ref&gt;Stowe, N. J., "Periodization of the History of Marketing Thought," In ''Proceedings of the First North America Workshop on Historical Research in Marketing,'' Stanley C. Hollander and Ronald Savitt (eds), East Lansing, Michigan State University Press, 1983, pp 1-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orientations and philosophies===

In the marketing literature, continuing debate surrounds the orientations or philosophies that might have informed marketing practice at different periods of time. An orientation may be defined as "the type of activity or subject that an organisation seems most interested in and gives most attention to".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/orientation "Orientation"], ''Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English.&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to marketing orientations, the term has been defined as a "philosophy of business management".&lt;ref&gt;Mc Namara (1972) cited in Deshpande, R., ''Developing a Market Orientation,'' Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage, 1999, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; or "a corporate state of mind"&lt;ref&gt;Kohli, A.K. and Jaworski, B.J., "Market  Orientation:  The Construct,  Research  Propositions, and  Managerial  Implications," ''Journal  of  Marketing,''  Vol.  54, April  1990, pp 1-18&lt;/ref&gt; or as an "organisational culture".&lt;ref&gt;Narver, J.C. and Slater, S.F., "The Effect of a Market Orientation on Business Profitability, " ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol 54, no. 4, pp 20-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Common periods===

The general lack of agreement amongst scholars as to what constitutes clearly identifiable periods and the orientation that characterised each distinct period has spawned a lengthy list of orientations. Space prevents an exhaustive description of all periods or eras. However, the salient features of the most commonly cited periods appear in the following section.

====Production orientation====

[[File:Air pollution by industrial chimneys.jpg|thumb|The production orientation is one of the oldest philosophies that guides sellers]]

A production orientation is often proposed as the first of the so-called orientations that dominated business thought. Keith dated the production era from the 1860s to the 1930s, but other theorists argue that evidence of the production orientation can still be found in some companies or industries. Specifically Kotler and Armstrong note that the production philosophy is "one of the oldest philosophies that guides sellers" and "is still useful in some situations".&lt;ref&gt;Kotler, P., Armstrong, G., ''Principles of Marketing, ''12th ed., Upper Saddle River, Pearson Education, 2008, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

The production orientation is characterised by:&lt;ref&gt;Kotler, P., "Marketing Management: Analysis, Planning, Implementation and Control", Prentice Hall, 1997 p.17&lt;/ref&gt;

* Focus on production, manufacturing, and efficiency
* Attainment of economies of scale, economies of scope, experience effects or all three
* Assumption that demand exceeds supply
* Mindset that is encapsulated by [[Say's Law]]; "Supply creates its own demand" or "if somebody makes a product, somebody else will want to buy it"
* Limited research that is largely limited to technical-product research rather than customer research 
* Rose to prominence in an environment which had a shortage of manufactured goods relative to demand, so goods sold easily.
* Minimal [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]] and [[advertising]], marketing communications limited to raising awareness of the product's existence

====Selling orientation====

[[File:The Rawleigh Man.JPG|thumb|The sales orientation, often characterised by door-to-door selling is thought to have begun during the Great Depression of the 1890s and continues to this day. Pictured: A Rawleigh's salesman in 1915]]
The selling orientation is thought to have begun during the [[Great Depression]] and continued well into the 1950s although examples of this orientation can still be found today.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, N.R., Marshall, G. and Stuart, E., ''Marketing: Real People, Real Choices,'' 5th ed, Pearson, 2009, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; Kotler et al. note that the selling concept "is typically practised with unsought goods".&lt;ref&gt;Kotler, P., Armstrong, G., ''Principles of Marketing, ''12th ed., Upper Saddle River, Pearson Education, 2008, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

The selling orientation is characterised by:
* Aggressive selling to push products, often involving door-to-door selling
* Accepting every possible sale or booking, regardless of its suitability for the business
* Strong transactional focus (ignores potential relationships)

====Marketing orientation====

The marketing orientation or the marketing concept emerged in the 1950s.

Characteristics of the marketing orientation:&lt;ref&gt;McGee, L.W. and Spiro, R.L., "The Marketing Concept in Perspective," ''Business Horizons, May–June, 1988, pp 40-45&lt;/ref&gt;

* Thorough understanding of the customer's needs, wants and behaviors should be the focal point of all marketing decisions
* Marketing efforts (sales, advertising, [[product management]], pricing)  should be integrated and in tune with the customer
* New product concepts should flow from extensive market analysis and product testing

====Societal marketing concept====
{{Main article| Societal marketing}}

Phillip Kotler is often credited with first proposing the societal marketing orientation or concept in an article published in the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell Reference, http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9780631233176_chunk_g978140510254422_ss1-48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kotler, P., "What Consumerism Means for Marketers", ''Harvard Business Review'', vol. 50, no. 3, 1972, pp 48-57&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some marketing historians, notably Wilkie and Moore, have argued that a societal perspective was evident in marketing theory and in marketing texts, since the discipline's inception in the early 1900s&lt;ref&gt;Wilkie, W.L. and Moore, E.S., "Macromarketing as a Pillar of Marketing Thought", ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol. 26 No. 2, December 2006, pp 224-232 DOI: 10.1177/0276146706291067; Wilkie, W. L. and Moore, E.S., "Scholarly Research in Marketing: Exploring the “4 Eras” of Thought Development", ''Journal of Public Policy and Marketing,'' Vol. 22, No. 2, 2003, pp 116–146&lt;/ref&gt; or that societal marketing is merely an extension of the marketing concept.&lt;ref&gt;Crane, A. and Desmond, J., "Societal Marketing and Morality", ''European Journal of Marketing'', Vol. 36 Issue: 5/6, 2002, pp 548-569, https://doi.org/10.1108/03090560210423014&lt;/ref&gt;

The societal marketing concept adopts the position that marketers have a greater social responsibility than simply satisfying customers and providing them with superior [[Value (marketing)|value]]. Instead, marketing activities should strive to benefit society's overall well-being. Marketing organisations that have embraced the societal marketing concept typically identify key stakeholder groups including: employees, customers, local communities, the wider public and government and consider the impact of their activities on all stakeholders. They ensure that marketing activities do not damage the environment and are not hazardous to broader society. Societal marketing developed into [[sustainable marketing]].

Characteristics of societal marketing:&lt;ref&gt;Kotler, P and Armstrong, G., ''Principles of Marketing,'' 9th ed., Prentice Hall; Griffin and Ebrert, ''Business'' 5th edition, Prentice Hall&lt;/ref&gt;

* An attempt to balance corporate commitments to groups and individuals in its environment, including customers, other businesses, employees and investors.
* Companies must include social and ethical considerations into their marketing practices
* Consideration is given to the environment includes problems such as air, water, and land pollution
* Consideration is given to consumer rights, unfair pricing and ethics in advertising

====Relationship orientation====
{{Main article| Relationship marketing}}

Starting in the 1990s, a new stage of marketing emerged called relationship marketing. The focus of relationship marketing is on a long-term relationship that benefits both the company and the customer.&lt;ref name="dstevenwhite"&gt;{{cite web|last=White|first=D. Steven|title=The Evolution of Marketing| url=http://dstevenwhite.com/2010/06/18/the-evolution-of-marketing |accessdate=11 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship is based on trust and commitment, and both companies tend to shift their operating activities to be able to work more efficiently together.&lt;ref name="Spiro2008"&gt;{{cite book|title=Management of a Sales Force|year=2008|publisher=McGraw-Hill Irwin|isbn=978-0-07-352977-6|author=Spiro, Roseann|edition=12th|author2=Gregory Rich |author3=William Stanton }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most prominent reasons for relationship marketing comes from Kotler's idea that it costs about five times more to obtain a new customer than to maintain the relationship with an existing customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McClintic Marion|first=Allison|title=Marketing: Historical Perspectives|url=http://www.enotes.com/business-finance-encyclopedia/marketing-historical-perspectives|accessdate=11 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A relationship marketing approach seeks to maximise the value of all the potential exchanges an organisation could have into the future.&lt;ref&gt;Volpato, G. and Stocchetti, A., [https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/30841 "Old and New Approaches to Marketing: The Quest of Their Epistemological Roots"], MPRA Paper No. 30841, 2009, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The characteristics of relationship marketing include:&lt;ref&gt;Christopher,  M.,  Payne,  A.  and  Ballantyne,  D., ''Relationship  Marketing: Bringing Quality, Customer Service, and Marketing Together,'' Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann, 1991, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

* Focus on the relationship between seller and buyer
* Investment in the lifetime of relationships rather than single transactions by calculating [[customer lifetime value]] (CLV)
* Orientation on product benefits and/or customer value
* Better customer service, commitment, and contact
* Quality is the concern of all
* All activities are coordinated with the customer interface, including the customer's involvement in the firm’s processes 
* Customised offerings where practical

Empirical support for relationship marketing as a distinct paradigm is very weak. One study suggests that relationship marketing is really a  sub-component of large scale movements of the value-added process rather than a separate era or framework.&lt;ref&gt;Manna, D.R. and Smith, A.D., "Measuring The Theoretical Paradigm Shift From Marketing Mix To Relational Marketing", ''International Business &amp; Economics Research Journal,'' Vol. 2, No. 11, 2000, pp 1-8&lt;/ref&gt; Some theorists suggest that marketing is moving from a relationship marketing paradigm and towards a social media paradigm where marketers have access to a more controlled environment and are able to customise offers and communications messages.&lt;ref name="dstevenwhite" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peppers &amp; Rogers Group, ''Relationship Marketing 3.0: Thriving in Marketing's New Ecosystem,'' [White Paper], 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Periodisations===

To investigate the history of marketing practice, scholars often turn to a method known as periodisation.&lt;ref name="Hollander, S.C. 2005, pp 32-41"&gt;Hollander, S.C., Rassuli, K.M. Jones, G.D.B., and Dix, L.F.,  "Periodization in Marketing History," ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol. 25 No. 1, June 2005, pp 32-41, DOI: 10.1177/0276146705274982&lt;/ref&gt; [[Periodization|Periodisation]] refers to the  process or study of categorizing the past into discrete, quantified, named units for the purpose of analysis or study.&lt;ref&gt;Collins Dictionary Online, https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/periodization&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars do not agree on the periods that characterise the history of marketing practice. In a major review of the periodisation approach, Hollander et al. have identified fourteen different "stage theories" or "short periodisations" as well as a total of nineteen "long periodisations" that have been carried out since 1957. Of these, the contributions of Robert Keith (1960) and Ronald Fullerton (1988) are the most frequently cited.&lt;ref&gt;Hollander, S.C., Jones, D.G.B. and Dix, L., "Periodization in Marketing History," ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol. 25, no. 1, pp 33-39&lt;/ref&gt;

====Keith's periodisation====

[[File:"Pillsbury's "A" Mill, the Largest Flour Mill in the World, Minneapolis, Minnesota" - postcard.jpg|thumb|Robert Keith's marketing eras (production →selling →marketing) were based entirely on his experience at the Pillsbury Company]]

In 1960, Robert Keith, the then Vice President of [[Pillsbury Company|Pillsbury]],&lt;ref&gt;Holloway, R.J., "Leaders in Marketing: Robert Keith," ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 32, July 1968, pp 74-75&lt;/ref&gt; set the stage for decades of controversy when he published an article entitled the "Marketing Revolution" in which he set out the way that the Pillsbury Company had shifted from a focus on production in the 1860s through to a consumer focus in the 1950s. He traced three distinct eras in Pillsbury's evolution:&lt;ref&gt;Keith, R.  J., "The Marketing Revolution," ''Journal of Marketing,''  Vol. 24, No. 1; Jul 1959-Apr 1960, pp 35-38&lt;/ref&gt;

* Production-oriented era (1869–1930s): characterised by a "focus on production processes"
* Sales-oriented era (1930s–1950s): characterised by investment in research to develop new products and advertising to persuade markets of product benefits
* Marketing-oriented era (1950s–present): characterised by a focus on the customer's latent and existing needs

In addition, Keith hypothesised that a "marketing control era" was about to emerge. Although Keith's article explicitly documented Pillsbury's evolution, the article appears to suggest that the stages observed at Pillsbury constitute a standard or normal evolutionary path (production→sales→marketing) for most large organisations.

Keith's notion of distinct eras in the evolution of marketing practice has been widely criticised and his periodisation described as "hopelessly flawed".&lt;ref&gt;Brown, S., "Trinitarianism: The Eternal Angel and the Three Eras Schema", in Brown, S., Bell, J. and Carson, D., ''Marketing Apocalypse: Eschatology, Escapology and the Illusion of the End,'' London, Routledge, 1996,  pp 25-26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, D. and Bailey, N., "The Development of Marketing: A Compendium of Historical Approaches," ''Quarterly Review of Marketing,'' vol. 15, no. 2, 1990, pp 6-13 and reproduced in ''Marketing: Critical Perspectives on Business and Management,'' Vol. 2, Michael John Baker (ed), London, Routledge, 2001, pp 75-91&lt;/ref&gt; Specific criticisms of Keith's tripartite periodisation include that:

* It ignores historical facts about business conditions&lt;ref name="Gilbert, D 1990, pp 6-13"&gt;Gilbert, D. and Bailey, N., "The Development of Marketing: A Compendium of Historical Approaches", (originally published in ''Quarterly Review of Marketing,'' vol. 15, no. 2, 1990, pp 6-13) and reproduced in ''Marketing: Critical Perspectives on Business and Management,'' Vol. 2, Michael John Baker (ed), London, Routledge, 2001, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;
* It misstates the nature of [[supply and demand]]&lt;ref name="Gilbert, D 1990, pp 6-13"/&gt;
* It slights the growth of marketing institutions&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, D. and Bailey, N., "The Development of Marketing: A Compendium of Historical Approaches," ''Quarterly Review of Marketing,'' vol. 15, no. 2, 1990, pp 6-13 and reproduced in ''Marketing: Critical Perspectives on Business and Management,'' Vol. 2, Michael John Baker (ed), London, Routledge, 2001, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

The article, which is entirely based on Keith's personal recollections and did not use a single reference, is best described as ''anecdotal.'' Systematic studies carried out since Keith's work have failed to replicate Keith's periodisation. Instead, other studies suggest that many companies exhibited a marketing orientation in the 19th-century and that the business schools were teaching marketing decades before Pillsbury adopted a marketing-oriented approach.&lt;ref name="Brown, S. 1996, p. 26"&gt;Brown, S., "Trinitarianism: The Eternal Angel and the Three Eras Schema," in Brown, S., Bell, J. and Carson, D., ''Marketing Apocalypse: Eschatology, Escapology and the Illusion of the End,'' London, Routledge, 1996, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Jones and Richardson also investigated historical accounts of marketing practice and found evidence for both the sales and marketing era during the so-called production era and concluded that there was no "marketing revolution".&lt;ref&gt;Jones, D.G.B. and Richardson, A.J., "The Myth of the Marketing Revolution" ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' March 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A detailed study of the chocolate manufacturer, Rowntree, found that this company had shifted from a production orientation through to a marketing orientation by the 1930s, without having transitioned through the so-called sales orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald, R., "Rowntree and Market Strategy: 1897-1939," ''Business and Economic History,'' Vol. 18, 1989, pp 45- 58,&lt;/ref&gt; Other critiques of Keith's work have pointed out that the so-called "production era" fails to align with historical facts and have suggested that it is a myth.&lt;ref name="Fullerton, E.A. 1988, pp. 108-125"&gt;Fullerton, E.A., "How Modern Is Modern Marketing? Marketing's Evolution and the Myth of the 'Production Era' ", ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 52, No. 1, 1988, pp. 108-125&lt;/ref&gt; Keith's eras have become known, somewhat cynically, as the ''standard chronology''.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, D.G.B. and Shaw, E.H., “A History of Marketing Thought”, in Weitz, B.A. and Wensley, R. (Eds), ''Handbook of Marketing'', Sage, London, 2002, pp. 39-66; Shaw, E.H., “Reflections on the History of Marketing Thought”, ''Journal of Historical Research in Marketing'', Vol. 1 No. 2, 2009, pp. 330-345.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fullerton's periodisation====

[[File:Marshall's flax-mill, Holbeck, Leeds - interior - c.1800.jpg|thumb|The English industrial revolution is often seen as a trigger for the rise of modern marketing]]

In 1988, Fullerton developed a more subtle and nuanced periodisation for the so-called marketing eras.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, S., "Trinitarianism: The Eternal Angel and the Three Eras Schema", in Brown, S., Bell, J. and Carson, D., ''Marketing Apocalypse: Eschatology, Escapology and the Illusion of the End,'' London, Routledge, 1996, p. 26,  https://www.jstor.org/stable/1251689&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, D. and Bailey, N., "The Development of Marketing: A Compendium of Historical Approaches," ''Quarterly Review of Marketing,'' vol. 15, no. 2, 1990, pp 6-13 and reproduced in ''Marketing: Critical Perspectives on Business and Management,'' Vol. 2, Michael John Baker (ed), London, Routledge, 2001, pp 84-86&lt;/ref&gt; Fullerton's eras were:&lt;ref name="Fullerton, E.A. 1988, pp. 108-125"/&gt;

* Era of antecedents (1500–1750): a long gestational period in which people were largely self-sufficient and rural; economy characterised by low levels of consumption; commerce was seen as suspicious 
* Era of origins (1750–1870): precipitated by the dislocations of the English industrial revolution and the rise of a more urban population, this era is characterised by more attention to persuasive tactics designed to stimulate demand
* Era of institutional development (1850–1929): many of the large institutions and modern marketing practices emerged during this period
* Era of refinement and formalization (1930–present): further development and refinement of principles and practices developed in the preceding period

In spite of the intense criticism leveled at Keith's eras of marketing practice, his periodisation is the most frequently cited in textbooks&lt;ref name="Hollander, S.C. 2005, pp 32-41"/&gt; and has become the accepted wisdom.&lt;ref name="Hollander, S.C. 2005, p. 39"/&gt; One content analysis of 25 introductory and advanced texts found that Keith's eras were reproduced in all but four.&lt;ref&gt;Hollander, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown, S. 1996, p. 26"/&gt;  Another study, which examined 15 of the top selling marketing texts, found that the although the incidence of repeating Keith's eras was waning, it had not been replaced by Fullerton's periodisation, nor any other more meaningful framework.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, S., "Trinitarianism: The Eternal Angel and the Three Eras Schema," in Brown, S., Bell, J. and Carson, D., ''Marketing Apocalypse: Eschatology, Escapology and the Illusion of the End,'' London, Routledge, 1996, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other periodisations====

For all the controversies surrounding marketing stages or periods, Keith and others appear to have contributed a lasting legacy.&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, B. and Costas, H., "The Periodization of Marketing: Myth or Reality? Evidence from the Scott Paper Company, " ''Academy of Marketing Studies Journal,'' Vol. 15, No. S2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Grundey (2010) suggests that many contemporary textbooks begin with Keith's eras and expand on it by including newer concepts such as the ''societal marketing concept'', the ''relationship marketing concept'' and  the ''interfunctional concept'', as shown in the table below.&lt;ref name = grund/&gt; More recently, Kotler and Keller added the ''holistic marketing concept'' to the list of eras in marketing.&lt;ref&gt;Kotler and Keller advanced the notion of a ''holistic era'' in Kevin Lane Keller and Philip Kotler, “Holistic Marketing: A Broad, Integrated Perspective to Marketing Management,” in ''Does Marketing Need Reform?,'' Jagdish Sheth and Raj Sisodia (eds), 2006, pp 300-305; did not include it in their 2008 publication but added it back in their most recent work; Kotler, P and Keller, K.L., ''A Framework for Marketing Management,'' 6th Global ed., Harlow, Essex, Pearson, 2016, pp 34-35&lt;/ref&gt; Marketing theorists continue to debate whether the holistic era represents a genuine new orientation or whether it is an extension of the marketing concept. Grundey summarised five different periodisations in the history of marketing, as shown in the following table, as a means of highlighting the general lack of agreement among scholars.&lt;ref name = grund&gt;Grundey, D., "The Marketing Philosophy and Challenges for the New Millennium", ''Scientific Bulletin – Economic Sciences: Marketing, Commerce and Tourism,'' Vol. 9, no. 15, 2010, p 170&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of marketing thought==
[[File:University of Pennsylvania- its history, traditions, buildings and memorials- also a brief guide to Philadelphia (1918) (14578085070).jpg|thumb|left|University of Pennsylvania was among the first universities to offer courses in marketing]]
Dating the history of marketing, as an academic discipline, is just as problematic as the history of marketing practice. Marketing historians cannot agree on how to date the beginnings of marketing thought. &lt;ref&gt;Shaw, E.H. and Jones, D.G.B, "A History of Marketing Thought,"  in ''Handbook of Marketing,'' Barton A Weitz and Robin Wensley (eds), Sage, 2003, p. 46-48&lt;/ref&gt; Eric Shaw, for instance, suggests that a period of pre-academic marketing thought can be identified prior to 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, E.H., (2015) "Teaching the History of Marketing Thought: An Approach", ''Journal of Historical Research in Marketing,'' Vol. 7, No. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  Other historians suggest that the theory of marketing only emerged in the 20th century when the discipline began to offer courses at universities. &lt;ref&gt;Bartels, R.,"The Identity Crisis in Marketing," ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 38, No. 4, pp 73-76; Bartels, R., ''The History of Marketing Thought,'' Columbus, Ohio: Grid.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, the birth of marketing as a discipline is usually designated to the first decade of the twentieth century when "marketing courses" appeared in universities. In 1902, the University of Michigan offered what many believe to be the very first course in marketing.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, E.H. and Jones, D.G.B, "A History of Marketing Thought,"  in ''Handbook of Marketing,'' Barton A Weitz and Robin Wensley (eds), Sage, 2003, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Illinois also started offering coursework in marketing in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, E.H. and Jones, D.G.B, "A History of Marketing Thought,"  in ''Handbook of Marketing,'' Barton A Weitz and Robin Wensley (eds), Sage, 2003, p. 47. &lt;/ref&gt; In the academic year, 1904-1905, the University of Pennsylvania commenced teaching marketing. Other universities soon followed, including the Harvard Business School.&lt;ref&gt;Volpato, G. and Stocchetti, A., "Old and new approaches to marketing: The quest of their epistemological roots," MPRA Paper No. 30841, 2009, &lt;Online: https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/30841&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the emergence of marketing courses, marketing was not recognised as a discipline in its own right; rather it was treated as a branch of economics and was often called ''applied economics.'' Subjects, which today might be recognised as marketing-related, were embedded in economics courses. Early marketing theories were described as modifications or adaptations of economic theories.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrell, O.C., Hair J.C. Jr., Marshall, G.W. and Tamilia, R.D., "Understanding the History of Marketing Education to Improve Classroom Instruction," ''Marketing Education Review,'' Vol. 25, no. 2, p. 161, DOI:10.1080/10528008.2015.1038963&lt;/ref&gt;

The impetus for the separation of marketing and economics was due, at least in part, to economic's focus on production as the creator of economic value and general failure to investigate distribution. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, as markets became more globalised, distribution began to assume increasing importance. Some economics professors began to run courses examining various aspects of the marketing system, including "distributive and regulative systems." Other courses, such as the "marketing of products" and the "marketing of farm-products" followed. As the first decades of the 20th century progressed, books and articles concerning marketing topics began to emerge. &lt;ref&gt;Wilkie, W. L. and Moore, E.S., "Scholarly Research in Marketing: Exploring the “4 Eras” of Thought Development," ''Journal of Public Policy and Marketing,'' Vol. 22, No. 2, 2003, pp 116–146&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, the publication of the new ''Journal of Marketing'' gave marketing academics a forum for exchanging ideas and research methods and also gave the discipline a real sense of its own distinct identity as a maturing academic discipline. &lt;ref&gt;Wilkie, W. L. and Moore, E.S., "Scholarly Research in Marketing: Exploring the “4 Eras” of Thought Development," ''Journal of Public Policy and Marketing,'' Vol. 22, No. 2, 2003, pp 119–121&lt;/ref&gt;

===A periodisation approach===

Several scholars have attempted to describe the evolution of marketing thought chronologically and to connect it with broader intellectual and academic trends. Bartels (1965) provided a brief account of marketing's formative periods, and Shah and Gardner (1982) briefly considered the development of the six dominant schools in contemporary marketing. &lt;ref&gt;Cited in: Lavin, M. and Archdeacon. T.J.,"The Relevance of Historical Method For Marketing Research", in ''Interpretive Consumer Research'', Elizabeth C. Hirschman (ed), Provo, UT , Association for Consumer Research, 1989, pp 60-68 &lt;Online: ect url ]:
http://acrwebsite.org/volumes/12176/volumes/sv07/SV-07&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, these initial attempts have been criticised as overly descriptive. &lt;ref&gt;Savitt, R., "Historical Research in Marketing," ''Journal of Marketing,'' 44, 1980, pp. 52-158.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first theorists to consider the stages in the development of marketing thought was Robert Bartels, who in ''The History of Marketing Thought,'' (1965) used a periodisation approach. He categorised the development of marketing theory decade by decade from the beginning of the 20th century:

* 1900s: discovery of basic concepts and their exploration
* 1910s: conceptualisation, classification and definition of terms
* 1920s: integration on the basis of principles
* 1930s: development of specialisation and variation in theory
* 1940s: reappraisal in the light of new demands and a more scientific approach
* 1950s: reconceptualisation in the light of [[managerialism]], social development and quantitative approaches
* 1960s: differentiation on bases such as managerialism, [[holism]], [[environmentalism]], [[systems theory|system]]s, and [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]]
* 1970s: socialisation; the adaptation of marketing to social change

Bartels was the first historian to provide a "long view of marketing’s past and wide sweep of its subdisciplines" and in so doing, he nurtured an interest in the history of marketing thought. &lt;ref&gt;Shaw, E.H. and Tamilia, E.D., "Robert Bartels and the History of Marketing Thought," ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol 21, Issue 2, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===A 'schools of thought' approach===

Other marketing historians have eschewed the periodisation approach, and instead considered whether distinct schools within marketing reflect different facets of common theory and whether a more unifying intellectual structure has emerged. These approaches tend to identify distinct schools of thought. A [[school of thought]] refers to an intellectual tradition or a group of scholars who share a common philosophy or set of ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary, http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/school-of-thought.html&lt;/ref&gt; Marketing historians, Shaw and Jones, define a school of thought as one that has "a substantial body of knowledge; developed by a number of scholars; and  describing at least one aspect of the what, how, who, why, when and where of performing marketing activities." &lt;ref name="Shaw, E 2005, p. 241"&gt;Shaw, E. H and Jones, D.G.B., "A history of schools of marketing thought," ''Marketing Theory,'' Vol 5, No 3, 2005, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

To a certain extent, there is some agreement that in early marketing thought, three so-called traditional schools, namely the commodity school, the functional school and the institutional school co-existed.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, E. H and Jones, D.G.B., "A history of schools of marketing thought," ''Marketing Theory,'' Vol 5, No 3, 2005, pp 230-&lt;/ref&gt; Marketing historians such as Eric Shaw and Barton A. Weitz point to the publication of [[Wroe Alderson]]'s book, ''Marketing Behavior and Executive Action'' (1957), as a break-point in the history of marketing thought,&lt;ref name=Bartels88&gt;
{{cite book|last=Bartels|first=Robert|title=The History of Marketing Thought |publisher=Publishing Horizons|location=Columbus|year=1988|edition=3rd.}}&lt;/ref&gt; moving from the macro functions-institutions-commodities approach to a [[micromarketing]] [[management]] [[paradigm]]. Following on from Alderson, marketing began to incorporate other fields of knowledge besides economics, notably [[behavioral science]] and psychology, becoming a multi-disciplinary field. For many scholars, Alderson's book marks the beginning of the ''Marketing Management Era.'' Of those historians who identify schools, there is no real agreement about which schools were dominant at different stages in marketing's development. Although the distinctive features of these schools can be identified and described, many of the early text-books included elements drawn from two or more schools of thought- for example, in a series of chapters devoted to commodities followed by a series of chapters devoted to the institutional and functional schools. &lt;ref&gt;Wilkie, W. L. and Moore, E.S., "Scholarly Research in Marketing: Exploring the “4 Eras” of Thought Development," ''Journal of Public Policy and Marketing,'' Vol. 22, No. 2, 2003, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following section, a brief overview of the contributions of key thinkers will be outlined with respect to the prevailing schools that have dominated marketing thought.

Hunt|Hunt]] and Goolsby, identified four schools of thought that have dominated marketing, namely; the commodity school, the institutional school, the functional school and the managerial school.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Shelby D. and Goolsby, Jerry, "The Rise and Fall of the Functional Approach to Marketing: A Paradigm Displacement Perspective," in Historical Perspectives in Marketing: Essays in Honour of Stanley Hollander, Terence Nevett and Ronald Fullerton (eds), Lexington, MA, Lexington Books, pp 35-37, sdh.ba.ttu.edu/Rise%20and%20Fall%20(88).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''The Commodity School'': A focus on different types of goods in the marketplace and how they are marketed.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrell, O.C., Ferrell,L. and Sawayda, J.,"A Historical Review and Reconceptualization of Commodity Marketing," in ''Commodity Marketing,''  Enke, Margit, Geigenmüller, Anja, Leischnig, Alexander (Eds), Springer, DOI: 10.1007/978-3-658-02925-8_22, pp 431-447&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''The Institutional School'': Emphasised the functions of middlemen (or intermediaries); similar to the functional school, but with a focus on channel flows.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, E. H and Jones, D.G.B., "A history of schools of marketing thought," ''Marketing Theory,'' Vol 5, No 3, 2005, p. 245 and 252&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''The Functional School'': A focus on the characteristics of marketing, identifying the functions and systems of marketing; adopts a systems approach.&lt;ref name="Shaw, E 2005, p. 241"/&gt;
* ''The Managerial School'': A focus on the problems faced by marketing managers; focuses on the perspective of the seller.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, E. H and Jones, D.G.B., "A history of schools of marketing thought," ''Marketing Theory,'' Vol 5, No 3, 2005, pp 257-58&lt;/ref&gt;

Some marketing historians like [[Jagdish Sheth]] have identified the modern "marketing schools" as:&lt;ref&gt;Sheth, J. N. and Gardner, D.M., ''Marketing Theory: Evolution and Evaluation,'' New York, Wiley, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''The Managerial school'' emerged during the late 1950s and became arguably the predominant and most influential school of thought in the field
* ''The Consumer/buyer behavior school'', which dominated the academic field in the second half of the twentieth century (apart from the Managerial school), features theories emerging from behavioral science
* ''The Social exchange school'', which focuses on exchange as the fundamental concept of marketing

Yet other commentators identify a broader range of schools. O'Malley and Lichrou, for example, document the schools as:&lt;ref&gt;O'Malley, L. and Lichrou, M., "Marketing Theory," in Baker, M.J. and Hart, S., ''The Marketing Book,'' 7th ed., Routledge, Oxon, UK, 2016, pp 37-52&lt;/ref&gt;
	
* ''Functional'':  What activities does marketing perform?  Focus on intermediaries and value adding. 
* ''Commodities'':  How are goods classified? Focus on classification of goods; trade flows
* ''Marketing Institutions'': Who performs marketing functions on commodities?  Focus on retailers, wholesalers, intermediaries, distribution channels
* ''Marketing Management'': How should marketers and managers market products and services to consumers? Business firm as seller/ supplier
* ''Marketing Systems'': What is a marketing system and how does it work?  Channels of distribution and aggregate systems, 
* ''Consumer behaviour'': How and why do consumers buy? organisational buyer and consumer buyer
* ''Macro-marketing'': How do marketing systems impact on society?  Industries, channels, consumer movement, environmentalism 
* ''Exchange'': What are the forms of exchange? Who are the parties to the exchange process? Aggregations of buyers and sellers
* ''Marketing history'': When did marketing practice and ideas emerge and evolve? Marketing thought and marketing practice

===Brief description of the dominant schools of thought===

By the 1920s, the marketing discipline was organised into three schools of thought: the commodity school, the institutional school and the functional school.The following sections briefly outlines the schools of thought as conceptualised by key thinkers in the discipline. Although these can be treated as separate schools of thought, considerable overlap between them is evident. The three schools that preceded marketing management exhibited a highly descriptive approach and collectively these are often called the ''classical schools.'' These schools borrowed heavily from economics and were largely concerned with aggregate demand and lacked a focus on the individual firm. &lt;ref&gt;Sheth, J.N., "History of Consumer Behavior: a Marketing Perspective", in ''Historical Perspectives in Consumer Research: National and International Perspectives,'' Jagdish N. Sheth and Chin Tiong Tan (eds), Singapore: Association for Consumer Research, 1985, pp 5-7 &lt;Online: http://acrwebsite.org/volumes/12106/volumes/sv05/SV-05&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; By the 1960s, all previous schools of thought had been eclipsed by the managerial school because it offered a problem-solving approach and presented marketers with potential solutions to marketing problems that were frequently encountered.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Brian D. G.; Shaw, Eric H, "A History of Marketing Thought," in ''Handbook of Marketing,'' Weitz, B. A. and Wensley, R. (eds), Sage, p. 54 and p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; 

====The commodity school====
[[File:Semillas de cacao.jpg|thumb|The commodity school focused on the ''objects of exchange.'' Pictured: Cocao beans]]

The commodity school is thought to have originated with an article by C.C. Parlin (1916) with a focus on the ''objects of exchange'' and was primarily concerned with classifying commodities. A different article published by Copeland, and published in the ''Harvard Business Review'' (1923) proposed the convenience-shopping-specialty goods classification which is still in use today. Other theorists developed a plethora of methods for classifying goods.  &lt;ref&gt;Jones, Brian D. G.; Shaw, Eric H, "A History of Marketing Thought," in ''Handbook of Marketing,'' Weitz, B. A. and Wensley, R. (eds), Sage, pp 53-54&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The institutional school====

The institutional school focused its attention on the ''agents of market transactions,'' specifically those organisations active in the intermediary channel system, such as wholesalers and retailers. It was primarily concerned with documenting the channels of distribution, the functions performed by channel members and the value-adding services they provided. In short, the institutional school was fundamentally concerned with the activities required to achieve efficiency within distribution systems. The institutional school was heavily influenced by economics, but in the 1970s, began to take on ideas from behavioural science.  &lt;ref&gt;Sheth, J. N., Gardner, D.M. and Garrett, D., ''Theories of Marketing,'' New York: Wiley, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; A key work in the institutional school tradition is Weld's ''The Marketing of Farm Products,'' (1916) while other important contributors included: Butler's ''Marketing and Merchandising,'' (1923); Breyer's ''Commodity and Marketing'' (1931); Converse's ''Marketing: Methods and Policies'' (1921) and Duddy &amp; Revzan's ''Marketing: An Institutional Approach'' (1947). &lt;ref&gt;Jones, Brian D. G.; Shaw, Eric H, "A History of Marketing Thought," in ''Handbook of Marketing,'' Weitz, B. A. and Wensley, R. (eds), Sage, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

====The functional school ====
The functional school was thought to have originated with the publication of Shaw's article, ''Some Problems in Market Distribution,'' (1912)  The functional school was primarily concerned with documenting the ''functions of marketing.'' In other words, it attempted to address the question, What work does marketing do? Different theorists within the functional school produced long lists of marketing's functions. Although there was little agreement about what should be included in the list, much of it revolved around the value added by marketing intermediaries. In those early years, advertising and promotion was rarely seen as a marketing function. In addition to Shaw, key thinkers in the functional school included Weld, Vanderblue and Ryan. &lt;ref&gt;Jones, Brian D. G.; Shaw, Eric H, "A History of Marketing Thought," in ''Handbook of Marketing,'' Weitz, B. A. and Wensley, R. (eds), Sage. pp. 55-55, {{ISBN|1-4129-2120-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Marketing management====
[[File:Problem solving in program- solution underway from museum of mathematics (8616623554).jpg|thumb|The marketing management school focuses on typical problems encountered by marketers]]
[[Wroe Alderson]] changed marketing thought with the publication of his work, ''Marketing Behaviour and Executive Action'' (1957) in which he was primarily concerned with the problems and challenges faced by marketers and the types of solutions that had been found to be successful. This shifted the emphasis away from the functions of marketing and towards a more problem-solving approach, thereby paving the way for a more managerial approach within the discipline. &lt;ref&gt;Jones, Brian D. G.; Shaw, Eric H, "A History of Marketing Thought," in ''Handbook of Marketing,'' Weitz, B. A. and Wensley, R. (eds), Sage. p. 58, {{ISBN|1-4129-2120-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians have claimed that Alderson's article signalled a ''paradigm shift'' in thinking, towards a new ''macromarketing'' approach.  &lt;ref&gt;Wilkie, W. L. and Moore, E.S., "Scholarly Research in Marketing: Exploring the “4 Eras” of Thought Development," ''Journal of Public Policy and Marketing,'' Vol. 22, No. 2, 2003, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

The marketing management school emerged as the dominant school in the 1960s following the publication of ''Basic Marketing: A Managerial Approach,'' written by [[E. Jerome McCarthy]] and replaced the so-called functional school which had been the dominant school for the first part of the twentieth century. In the words of Hunt and Goolsby, the publication of McCarthy's text, sounded the "beginning of the end for the functional school." &lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Shelby D. and Goolsby, Jerry, "The Rise and Fall of the Functional Approach to Marketing: A Paradigm Displacement Perspective," in ''Historical Perspectives in Marketing: Essays in Honour of Stanley Hollander,'' Terence Nevett and Ronald Fullerton (eds), Lexington, MA, Lexington Books, pp 35-51, sdh.ba.ttu.edu/Rise%20and%20Fall%20(88).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Hunt and Goolsby note that the 1960s was a transitional period in which both the functional school and the managerial school co-existed.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Shelby D. and Goolsby, Jerry, "The Rise and Fall of the Functional Approach to Marketing: A Paradigm Displacement Perspective," in ''Historical Perspectives in Marketing: Essays in Honour of Stanley Hollander,'' Terence Nevett and Ronald Fullerton (eds), Lexington, MA, Lexington Books, pp 35-51, sdh.ba.ttu.edu/Rise%20and%20Fall%20(88).pdf, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;  Shaw and Jones have described the emergence of the managerial school in the mid-twentieth century as a "paradigm shift." &lt;ref&gt;Shaw, E.H. and Jones, D.G.B, " A History of Marketing Thought,"  ''Marketing Theory,'' 2005; Vol. 5, No. 3, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

While the management school continued to borrow from economics, it also introduced ideas from the new and emerging fields of sociology and psychology, which offered useful insights for explaining aspects of consumer behaviour such as the influence of culture and social class. Key works in the marketing management tradition include Wroe Alderson's ''Marketing Behavior and Executive Action,'' (1957), Howard's ''Marketing Management'' (1957), Lazer's ''Managerial Marketing: Perspectives and Viewpoints,'' (1957) and McCarthy's ''Basic Marketing: A Managerial Approach'' (1960).&lt;ref&gt;Brian Jones, D.G. and Shaw, E.H, "The History of Marketing Thought," in ''Handbook of Marketing,'' Weitz, R. and Wensley, R. (eds), London, UK, 2003,  p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

The salient features of the managerial approach to marketing are:

* "an overt marketing-as-management orientation, and 
* an overt reliance on the behavioral and quantitative sciences as means of knowing."  &lt;ref&gt;Wilkie, W.L. and Moore, E.S., "Macromarketing as a Pillar of Marketing Thought," ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol. 26 No. 2, December 2006, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Imaging Industry Association''' (I3A) was created by a merger of the [[Photographic and Imaging Manufacturers Association]] (PIMA) and the [[Digital Imaging Group]] in 2001. It was a common forum for the industrial imaging industry. 

It used to supervise standards for photography and digital imaging, such as [[JPEG 2000]] and [[Picture Transfer Protocol|PTP]] as well as the [[Internet Imaging Protocol]].

It disbanded in October 2013 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000241.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

== PIMA ==
The Photographic and Imaging Manufacturers Association, or PIMA, was founded in 1946 under the name National Association of Photographic Manufacturers (NAPM). In 1997 the name was changed to PIMA.

'''Isaak Löw Hofmann, Edler von Hofmannsthal''' (10 June 1759 in Prostiebor (now [[Prostiboř]]), near [[Kladruby (Tachov District)|Kladrau]], now in the district of [[Plzeň|Pilsen]], [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] &amp;ndash; 12 December 1849 in [[Vienna]]) was an [[Austria]]n [[merchant]].

During the famine in [[Ansbach]] in the middle of the 18th century, Hofmann's parents had emigrated from [[Pretzendorf]] (now [[Himmelkron]]), near [[Bayreuth]], to Bohemia, where they lived in very poor circumstances. His early training he received at home, and from his thirteenth year he studied at [[Prague]] as a ''"[[bachur]]"'' ([[Talmudic scholar]]) under Rabbi [[Abraham Plohn]].

After completing his studies he entered as teacher the house of [[Joel Baruch]], a [[tobacco]] farmer for the Austrian government. Besides giving instruction to the children, Hofmann took charge of the books of his employer. When in 1788 Baruch moved to Vienna and opened a wholesale house there, Hofmann was appointed manager of the entire business. Having received the same year a permit from the Austrian government to do business in Vienna, he chose the name "Isaak Löw Hofmann". On the death of Baruch he was made a partner in, and in 1794 became sole member of the firm which bore the name ''"Hofmann und [[Löwinger]]"''. Becoming interested in 1796 in the manufacture of [[silk]], he was one of the first to farm the silk monopoly from the [[Hungarian government]] (1802), a privilege which his house retained for nearly half a century. At his instigation, his son [[Emanuel Hofmann von Hofmannsthal|Emanuel]] wrote a pamphlet, ''"Einleitung zur Seidenzucht"'', of which more than 16,000 copies were distributed. Hofmann was very active in business, and succeeded in making his firm one of the leading houses of Austria-Hungary.

Hofmann took great interest in the [[Jewish community of Vienna]], being president in 1806 and representative in 1812, which latter office he held until his death. In 1822 he founded the institution for the poor ("Armenanstalt"), which is still flourishing. He received many honours, and was made a member of the hereditary nobility by the Emperor of Austria in 1835.

He was the great-grandfather of [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]].

[[File:John A. Quelch - World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2011 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Quelch during the [[World Economic Forum|WEF]] 2011]]
'''John Anthony Quelch''' [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (born 8 August 1951) was appointed in 2017 as Vice Provost for Executive Education and Dean of the School of Business Administration at the [[University of Miami]]. He is also the Charles Edward Wilson Professor of Business Administration Emeritus at [[Harvard Business School]] and Dean Emeritus at the [[China Europe International Business School]], [[Shanghai]].&lt;ref name=Whoswho&gt;'QUELCH, Prof. John Anthony', Who's Who 2014, A &amp; C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 2014; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2013 ; online edn, Dec 2013 [http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whoswho/U31684 accessed 3 April 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and career ==

Quelch was born in London, son of an RAF officer and a nurse .&lt;ref name=Times98&gt;Dearlove, Desmond. "Coming home: the man from Harvard." Times [London, England] 26 January 1998: 3. InfoTrac Custom Newspapers. Web. 9 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; He began his education at a one-room schoolhouse in the [[Isle of Man]], attended primary school in Australia, then returned to England, settling in [[Norwich]] and enrolling in [[Town Close School]]&lt;ref name=Times98/&gt; and later [[Norwich School (independent school)|Norwich School]].&lt;ref name=Whoswho/&gt; Quelch received his BA and MA from [[Exeter College, Oxford University]], where he was an Open Scholar in Modern History.  At Oxford, he edited the student newspaper ''[[Cherwell (newspaper)|Cherwell]]''.&lt;ref name=Times98/&gt; As a [[Thouron Award|Thouron Scholar]], he earned an [[MBA]] from the [[Wharton School]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. He then took an SM from the [[Harvard School of Public Health]] and a [[Doctor of Business Administration|DBA]] from [[Harvard Business School]].

Quelch's first academic post was as a visiting instructor at the [[University of Hawaii]].  He was next appointed assistant professor at the [[School of Business Administration]] (now the Ivey School) of the [[University of Western Ontario]].  In 1979, he returned to [[Harvard Business School]] as an assistant professor.  He became a tenured professor in 1988 and was appointed the Sebastian S. Kresge Professor of Marketing and Co-Chair of the Marketing department in 1994.

In 1998, he was appointed Dean (with Vice-Chancellor status) of [[London Business School]]. During his tenure, revenues and student enrollments increased 50% over three years,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2001-01-07/london-business-schools-dean-goes-home "London Business School's Dean Goes Home,"] 7 January 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and faculty numbers increased 30%.  A network of twenty-five alumni clubs and six international advisory boards was established, corporate sponsorships doubled, and the yield on MBA admissions rose from 57% to 73%.  In 2001, London Business School received the [[Queen's Award for Enterprise]] and was ranked number eight business school in the world by the ''Financial Times.''&lt;ref&gt;http://rankings.ft.com/businessschoolrankings/charts&lt;/ref&gt;

Quelch returned to Harvard in 2001 as Lincoln Filene Professor of Business Administration and Senior Associate Dean for International Development overseeing the establishment of a global network of research centers.&lt;ref&gt;"A Global Perspective," ''HBS Global Ventures'', Winter 2002, pp.1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 2006 and 2008, he served as Senior Associate Dean responsible for coordinating the planning and execution of Harvard Business School's 2008 Centennial celebrations. He also served as a director of the Harvard Business School Publishing Company.

In 2009, Quelch was on sabbatical leave in Shanghai as the La Caixa Visiting Professor of International Management and Chairman of the Academic Advisory Council at the [[China Europe International Business School]] (CEIBS).

The number of full-time faculty and CEIBS revenues both increased by one-third.  Special emphasis was placed on upgrading CEIBS research output, executive education, global awareness and fundraising.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Browne, "China Eyed as Next Educational Frontier," ''Wall Street Journal'', 30 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Quelch returned to Harvard in 2013 as the first Harvard Business School professor to hold a joint primary appointment at the [[Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health]] as professor of Health Policy and Management.  Between 2013 and 2017, he also served as an associate in research at [[Harvard's Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies]], fellow of the Harvard China Fund, and member of the Harvard China Advisory Board.

==Research and publications==
Quelch's early research focused on the application of marketing to preventive healthcare programs.This resulted in the article "Marketing Principles and the Future of Preventive Health Care" (''Milbank Memorial Fund Quarterly/Health and Society'', 1980) and other papers in the ''American Journal of Clinical Nutrition'' and ''Nutrition Reviews''.

Next, Quelch focused on how to improve the design and productivity of temporary price promotions.  This work coalesced in the book, ''Sales Promotion Management, (''Prentice-Hall'','' 1989).

By the late 1980s, Quelch had already turned his attention to the marketing implications of globalization.  His research on global marketing was profiled by Mazur and Miles in ''Conversations With Marketing Masters'' (John Wiley, 2007). His books in this domain include:

* ''The Global Market'' (Jossey Bass, 2005) and
* ''The New Global Brands:  Managing Non-Governmental Organizations in the 21st Century'' (Thomson, 2006)
* ''Business Solutions For The Global Poor'' (Jossey Bass, 2007)
* ''Greater Good:  How Good Marketing Makes For Better Democracy'' (Harvard Business Press, 2008)
* ''All Business Is Local'' (Penguin/Portfolio, 2012)
* ''Global Marketing Management'' (6th edition, BVT Publishing, 2017).

Since 2013, Quelch has focused his attention on patient centricity and consumer empowerment in the healthcare sector. ''Consumers, Corporations and Public Health,''   ([https://global.oup.com/academic/product/consumers-corporations-and-public-health-9780190235123?facet_narrowbytype_facet=Books%20for%20Courses&amp;lang=3n&amp;cc=us Oxford University Press], 2016) was followed by ''Building A Culture of Health:  A New Imperative for Business'' (Springer, 2016).

Quelch's practitioner focused articles embrace eighteen contributions in the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]''.
His articles include:  "Bringing Customers Into The Boardroom" (''[[Harvard Business Review]]'', November 2004), "How Global Brands Compete" (''[[Harvard Business Review]]'', September 2004),  "Building And Valuing Global Brands in the Nonprofit Sector", (''Nonprofit Management and Leadership'',  2007), "Governance in the Public Sector", (''Directors &amp; Boards'',  2008), "An Exploration of Marketing's Impacts on Society: A Perspective Linked to Democracy" (''Journal of Public Policy and Marketing'', 2008), "How To Market In A Downturn" (''Harvard Business Review'', April 2009). "Can Corporate Social Responsibility Survive The Recession?" (''Leader to Leader'', 2009) and "Government Adoption of Sales Promotions:  An Initial Appraisal" (''Journal of Public Policy &amp; Marketing'', 2010).

Professor Quelch is known for his teaching materials and innovations in pedagogy.  His case studies have sold over 4 million copies, third highest in HBS history.  In 1995, he developed the first HBS interactive CD-ROM exercise (on Intel's advertising budgeting process). In 1999, he developed and presented a series of twelve one-hour programs on Marketing Management for the Public Broadcasting System.  His ''Marketing Know:How'' blog, accessible at [https://archive.is/20130201020332/http://www.quelchblog.com/] and published by Harvard Business School Publishing, has been translated into Chinese and Vietnamese.

In this ''[[pro bono]]'' role, he chaired the security and safety committee and, later, the strategy and services committee of the Massport board.  He submitted his resignation to Governor Deval Patrick in January 2011 after 8 1/2 years of service.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Thompson, "Massport Back on Course," ''HBS Bulletin'', 1 June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an additional ''pro bono'' role, Quelch has served from 2003 as Honorary Consul General of the [[Kingdom of Morocco]] for the [[New England]] region.  His long-standing ties to the Middle East resulted in the book, ''Business Strategies For Muslim Countries'' (Prentice Hall, 2000).

Quelch has governance experience as a non-executive director of public companies in the United States and the United Kingdom.  In 2013, he stepped down as a non-executive director of [[WPP plc|WPP]] plc, the world's largest marketing and media services company, after 25 years of service.

He served previously as a director of easyJet plc, Pentland Group plc, Pepsi Bottling Group and Reebok International Ltd. He is senior strategy advisor to [[JD.com]], the Chinese e-commerce company.

In the not-for-profit sector, Quelch has served as honorary chairman of the British American Business Council of New England, as a trustee of the London-based STARS foundation and as a board member of Americans for Oxford, Accion International and the National Council of Better Business Bureaus.

In 2006, Quelch was named by ''The Sunday Times'' as one of the "Top 25 Britons who call the shots in America".  He received the annual leadership award from the [[British American Business Council of New England]] in 2008 and from the [[World Affairs Council of Boston]] in 2010. Quelch was appointed [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in the [[2011 Queen's Birthday Honours]] for services to the promotion of British business interests and prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=59808 |date=11 June 2011 |page=23 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He sold the company in 2005 to [[Booking Holdings]] for 110 milion [[Euros]]. Koolen remained Booking.com's CEO until 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oprichter: Verkoop van Booking.com aan Amerikanen is slecht geweest voor Nederland|url=https://www.businessinsider.nl/het-verkopen-van-booking-com-aan-de-amerikanen-slecht-voor-nederland-geweest-stelt-de-oprichter/|website=Business Insider Nederland|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 his wealth was estimated at 115 million euro, making him 232nd wealthiest person in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kees Koolen|url=http://www.quotenet.nl/Miljonairs/Kees-Koolen|website=Quote|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rally raid==
Koolen competed in his first [[Dakar Rally]] in [[2009 Dakar Rally|2009]]. Racing a [[Honda CRF series|Honda CRF450]] he finished 69th in the motorbike classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kees Koolen|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108041840/http://www.dakar.com:80/2009/DAK/RIDERS/us/equipage/125.html|website=Dakar|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[2010 Dakar Rally]] Koolen and his team raced a [[McRae Enduro]] buggy. Koolen had a troubled third stage. He passed all check points but stranded on his way to the bivak and had to retire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Etappe 3: Revanche Verhoeven, ellende voor buggy's|url=http://www.omroepbrabant.nl/?news/1297261063/Etappe+3+Revanche+Verhoeven,+ellende+voor+buggys.aspx|website=Omroep Brabant|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[2011 Dakar Rally]] Koolen developed his own buggy to compete, the GoKoBra. The team entered two GoKoBra's, one for Koolen and one for teammate [[Jurgen van den Goorbergh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Een nieuw avontuur kan beginnen|url=http://www.omroepbrabant.nl/?news/148209952/Een+nieuw+avontuur+kan+beginnen.aspx|website=Omroep Brabant|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koolen was disqualified after the sixth stage. Koolen finished the sixth stage outside the time limit but was given dispensation by the organisation. The organisation later the decided to disqualify Koolen because he missed the first check point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Omstreden besluit: ook Koolen uit Dakar Rally|url=http://www.omroepbrabant.nl/?news/148580932/Omstreden+besluit+ook+Koolen+uit+Dakar+Rally.aspx|website=Omroep Brabant|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team finished the [[2012 Dakar Rally]] in 59th place.

Kees Koolen entered his first Dakar Rally with a quad in [[2013 Dakar Rally|2013]]. He again finished the Dakar Rally, in 17th place. In 2014 Koolen became the first participant to finish the Dakar Rally in all four classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KEES KOOLEN SCHRIJFT DAKAR-GESCHIEDENIS|url=http://www.eurol.com/nl/10-nieuws/518-nieuws/3848-kees-koolen-schrijft-dakar-geschiedenis.html|website=Eurol|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 Koolen joined Van den Goorbergh and Gijs van Uden in a [[Ginaf]] truck entered by Maxxis Dakar Team Powered by Super B.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No. 541 - Maxxis Dakar Team Powered by Super B|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229022155/http://www.dakar.com:80/dakar/2014/fr/pilote/541.html|website=Dakar|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team finished in 37th place.

For 2015 Koolen developed his own quad off-road racer. During the Dakar Rally Koolen was arrested by Chilean authorities. During the fifth stage Koolen deviated from the determined route and drove through a protected area. Koolen was released after questioning. Koolen was not the only participant racing through a protected area in the [[Atacama Desert]], [[Matteo Cassucio]] was also arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dakar-deelnemer Kees Koolen gearresteerd na omweg door archeologisch gebied|url=http://www.omroepbrabant.nl/?news/2227941093/Dakar-deelnemer+Kees+Koolen+gearresteerd+na+omweg+door+archeologisch+gebied.aspx|website=Omroep Brabant|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following stage Koolen retired from the rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hans Vogels op een keurige 20e plek en de uitslagen van de andere Brabanders in etappe 6|url=http://www.omroepbrabant.nl/?news/221782892/Hans+Vogels+op+een+keurige+20e+plek+en+de+uitslagen+van+de+andere+Brabanders+in+etappe+6.aspx|website=Omroep Brabant|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 2016 Koolen returned in his Honda quad with top ten stage results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dakar 2016: Argentijnse broederstrijd bij de quads, Kees Koolen weer in top 10|url=http://www.racexpress.nl/dakar/dakar-2016-argentijnse-broederstrijd-bij-de-quads-kees-koolen-weer-in-top-10/n/71106|website=Racexpress.nl|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not finish the Dakar Rally after stage nine.

'''Leslie Coombs Brand''' (1859–1925) was an American real estate developer. He is best known for developing [[Glendale, California]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=MyGlendale|title=The Life &amp; Times of Leslie C.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Leslie Coombs Brand was born on May 12, 1859 in [[Florissant, Missouri]].&lt;ref name="newspress"&gt;Katherine Yamada, [http://articles.glendalenewspress.com/2004-11-13/news/export6376_1_family-history-brand-park-judy-brand A century of achievements], ''Glendale News-Press'', November 13, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; He had two sisters, Helen Dryden (b. 1857) and Ada Stocker (b. 1863), and brothers Henry (b. 1853) and Joseph (b. 1868).&lt;ref name="newspress"/&gt; Their father died when he was ten years old and the family resettled in St. Louis.&lt;ref name="newspress"/&gt;

At twenty years old, Leslie moved to Moberly, Missouri and became a recorder for Randolph County. He soon created a small real estate business with partners in Moberly. &lt;ref&gt;Brand, J. (1993). Brand. United States: Judy Brand.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
Brand moved to Los Angeles, California in 1886 as land development flourished, and formed the Los Angeles Abstract Company with Edwin Sargent &lt;ref&gt;Pauley, K. E., &amp; Pauley, C. M. (2005). San Fernando, Rey de España: An illustrated history. Spokane: Arthur H. Clark Co.&lt;/ref&gt; on the corner of Franklin and New High Streets&lt;ref&gt;Clary, W. W. (1966). History of the law firm of O'Melveny &amp; Myers, 1885-1965. Los Angeles.&lt;/ref&gt;. At that time, the real estate
business in the Los Angeles area was booming, but unfortunately for Brand and Sargent, financial panic struck in 1892, the market slumped, and the two men sold their business.&lt;ref name="newspress"/&gt; 

Brand spent the next several years outside the state. He met and married Mary Louis Dean in Galveston, Texas in 1891. He witnessed the growth of Galveston and its city center with grand, tree lined boulevards.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, E. H. (2010). Women, culture, and community: Religion and reform in Galveston, 1880-1920. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, the couple returned to Los Angeles, and in October 1895 Brand and Sargent joined forces again to establish the Los Angeles Title Guarantee and Trust Company. Henry E. Huntington of the Los Angeles Railroad Company was also a member of the board. Brand and his wife lived at 917 Douglas in Angelino Heights along with his brother Joe and friend Dan Campbell.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell's Los Angeles City Directory and Gazetteer of Southern California, 1898&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1901 the holdings of the Title Guarantee and Trust Company north of downtown Los Angeles became the community of Glendale. At the time it had a population of 550 and was dependent on the telephone and telegraph services of the adjacent town of Tropico. Brand saw the potential for the expansion of towns surrounding Los Angeles, and began to work determinedly on the development of the small community of Glendale. Together with Henry E. Huntington, he formed the San Fernando Valley Land and Development Company.&lt;ref&gt;Arroyo, J. M. (2005). Early Glendale. San Francisco, CA: Arcadia Pub.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leslie Brand is often called the father of Glendale due to the role he played in the development of the City in the early 1900s. He partnered with Henry Huntington and Edgar Goode to bring the electric rail to connect Glendale to Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, E. C., Berger, S. C., Jonisch, T. E., &amp; Yamada, K. P. (2006). Glendale: A pictorial history. Virginia Beach, Va: Donning Co.&lt;/ref&gt; 
At the time the tracks ran up Brand Boulevard to Casa Verdugo between Stocker and Randolph where the company established a restaurant under the management of Mrs. Piedad Yorba de Sowl, which quickly became very popular. &lt;ref&gt;&lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/historyofglendal00sher"&gt;Sherer, J. C. (1922). History of Glendale and vicinity. Glendale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
At one time he owned Glendale Light &amp; Power Company, the Miradero Water Company and the Consolidated Water Company. He sold the power and water companies to the City of Glendale to provide municipal services to the community. He also established the San Fernando Valley Home Telephone Company providing phone services. 

Brand explored the idea of building a residence in the foothills above Glendale where he had purchased land. He hired architect [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_Dryden|Nathaniel Dryden]], his brother in law, to design and build a mansion based on the East Indian Pavilion he had seen at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. Between 1903 and 1904 the house was built and named "El Miradero" by Brand, meaning a high place overlooking an extensive view. &lt;ref&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/tn-gnp-me-yamada-the-dryden-homes-20130605-story.html "&gt;Yamada, K. (2013). Verdugo Views: The Dryden homes. Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Leslie Brand became an airplane enthusiast in part to reduce his commute to his property in Mono Lake. He purchased fifteen acres and built an airstrip below El Miradero for his special ordered army surplus Curtiss JN-6H (Hisso Jenny).&lt;ref&gt;FINEST AIR CAR BUILT FOR BRAND. (1920, Jul 26). Los Angeles Times (1886-1922) Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/160799593?accountid=11124&lt;/ref&gt; The Brands hosted "fly-in" parties with local dignitaries and movie stars of the silent era. &lt;ref&gt;MUST COME BY AIR OR NOT AT ALL. (1921, Mar 27). Los Angeles Times (1886-1922) Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/160810094?accountid=11124&lt;/ref&gt; Brand and his wife enjoyed entertaining at their home and had pilots on staff to fly himself and his guests.

===Personal life===
Brand married Lulu Broughton in 1883, but she died a few months later.&lt;ref name="newspress"/&gt; He later married Mary Louise Dean in 1891 (1871–1945). His sister married the architect [[Nathaniel Dryden]] (1849–1924). 

Since they had no children of their own, Mr. Brand and his wife enjoyed time with their family, including his sisters, nieces and nephews. They were also avid dog owners, several of the Brand dogs are buried in the Brand cemetery. On the grounds of El Miradero there were many facilities for recreation, including a swimming pool, tennis courts, horse stables, gardens and greenhouse. 

In the summer of 1924, Leslie Brand was diagnosed with terminal cancer and he convalesced at home. He decided to donate his home and acreage to the City of Glendale to be used exclusively as a Public Library and Public Park. He died on April 10, 1925 in Glendale, California.&lt;ref&gt;BRIEF RITES FOR BRAND TOMORROW. (1925, Apr 11). Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/161650990?accountid=11124&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the death of Mary Louise Brand in 1945&lt;ref&gt;Mrs. M.

The home would be used for cultural purposes until the opening of the Brand Library and Art Center in 1956.

===Legacy===
* The Brand Library and Art Center branch of the Glendale Public Library is named in his honor.&lt;ref name="newspress"/&gt;
* Brand Boulevard in Glendale is also named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;Brand, J. (1993). Brand. United States: Judy Brand.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Brand's interest in airplanes started a movement resulting in the [[Grand Central Airport (United_States)]] - a hub of aviation history.

On March 3-4 at the Hynes Convention Center in Boston, the Sloan Sports Analytics Conference (SSAC) entered its second decade of existence, and did so together with 3,500 attendees united by their passion for sports, statistical analysis, and business. After a record 39 panels, 39 Competitive Advantage talks, 7 interactive events, and the conference’s first ever esports exhibition, SSAC lived up to this year’s conference theme: Elevate the Game.

Conference Co-Chair Jessica Gelman kicked things off Friday morning, moderating the Titans of the Sports Industry panel featuring Michael Rubin, Jared Smith, Michael Spillane, and Casey Wasserman. The discussants set the bar high with a candid conversation about taking a business global and the role of analytics in building a successful company. In the afternoon 275K people tuned in through Facebook Live to watch 538’s Nate Silver interview NBA Commissioner Adam Silver.

Another Friday highlight was the all-star lineup of executives Billy Beane, Sam Hinkie, SSAC Co-Chair Daryl Morey, and Farhan Zaidi taking the stage to discuss the role of cognitive bias in decision making. That wasn’t Morey’s only strong performance of the day. He was one of the last people standing against Chess Grandmaster Susan Polgar, who knocked out 10 opponents in under an hour in SSAC’s first ever chess simulation.

On Day 2, Nate Silver sat down with Mark Cuban, one of the biggest personalities in the NBA, to discuss everything from sports to his political aspirations. Their back-and-forth entertained more than the capacity crowd in the Hynes Center, reaching 330K people on Facebook Live.

Other popular panels featured looks at the role of sustainability in sports, disruptors in the sports industry—featuring Bob Bowman, Bobby Kotick, Jonathan Kraft, and Jason Robins—engaging the modern fan, and a discussion of negotiating strategies with Warren Legarie, Daryl Morey, Bob Myers, and Deepak Malhotra.  During the Getting the Scoop panel, Adam Schefter managed to give a live demonstration, breaking some NFL news mid-panel.

Competitive Advantage talks by John D’Angelo, [[Larry Coon]], Meeta Singh, and Eric Joyce and Cam Lawrence on, respectively, preventing Tommy John surgery, understanding the new NBA Collective Bargaining Agreement, the impact of sleep on sports performance, and analytics’ role in NHL draft strategy generated significant interest. Over two days leaders from across the sports landscape provided attendees insight on some of the most critical issues in the industry today. Attendees were also treated to 9 workshops on topics ranging from coding in SQL to data scraping and optimization.

The Research Papers Competition presented by Wasserman remains a key source of innovation where groundbreaking researchers from around the world redefine sports analytics. Top prize went to John Drazan, Amy Loya, Benjamin Horne, and Ron Eglash for their work on using sports analytics to stimulate youth interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.

The entrepreneurial spirit was alive and well at the Startup Competition &amp; Trade Show, with 24 companies aiming to disrupt the sports industry.  In addition, 2017 marked the introduction of the Accelerator Competition presented by Reebok. The judges were so impressed with the participants that both Nix Biotech and Open Gym walked away with the top prize and the opportunity to grow their businesses with Reebok’s support. Additional events—a dedicated esports room that hosted a ProAm tournament, drone racing, and a chess simulation with Polgar—helped make this the most interactive SSAC yet.

Finally, it wouldn’t be SSAC without a nod to the individuals who have used analytics to transform the sports world. Oakland A’s Executive Vice President Billy Beane, whose Moneyball approach to baseball has made an impact far beyond the diamond, took home the Alpha Award for Lifetime Achievement. The 2016 World Champion Chicago Cubs were named Best Analytics Organization. Bob Myers and the Golden State Warriors took the Best Transaction prize for bringing [[Kevin Durant]] to the Bay Area just three months before Durant added an NBA Championship and Finals MVP to his resume. Finally, Q30 and its anti-concussion Q-Collar earned an Alpha Award for Best Innovation.

The excitement was hardly limited to the people in the Hynes Convention Center. SSAC’s social media footprint was massive throughout the two days. The conference’s live streams reached over 650K people. SSAC’s Snapchat filter was viewed by over 22.8K accounts. The conference made its mark on Twitter, with #SSAC17 trending No. 1 nationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sloansportsconference.com/archive/annual/2017-annual-recap/|title=2017 Annual Recap - MIT Sloan Analytics Conference|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014===
"From Ripple to Revolution," co-chair Daryl Morey began in echoing the theme of the 2014 MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference. "Things start small, and using analytics, eventually become a necessary part of competing." Morey’s panel with some of the great innovators in sports – Bill James and Nate Silver – kicked off a conference which has become the fabric of the sports analytics revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-28/wall-street-titans-in-sports-have-nate-silver-seeing-statistics.html | work=Bloomberg | first=Scott | last=Soshnick | title=Wall Street Titans in Sports Have Nate Silver Seeing Statistics | date=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, 2000+ attendees representing 300+ teams, leagues and sports-related organizations descended on Boston to hear the latest in the development and use of sports analytics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bostonherald.com/business/business_markets/2014/03/sports_continues_to_move_forward_at_mit_conference|title=Sports world continues to move forward at MIT conference|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expanding far beyond the attendees at the Hynes Convention Center, the conference trended on Twitter as high as third throughout the US, with conference attendees relaying quotes and insights to a broad online audience, while hundreds followed panel live-streams on YouTube. Eight years into the conference’s history, nearly every aspect of the sports industry has been impacted by the data revolution. Once again co-chaired by Jessica Gelman and Morey, the 2014 version featured 25 panels, 27 presentations, and 100+ speakers. Innovation in sports analytics remained a primary focus, with over 300 entries in the research paper competition and a series of Evolution of Sports talks by analytics thought-leaders. The role of analytics on the business side of the industry also increased in prominence, with an expanded Competitive Advantage series highlighting the growing role of data in managerial decision-making.

The heart of the conference remained the panels featuring pre-eminent analytic and industry leaders. The talk of the first day centered around its culmination, the "Building a Dynasty" panel in which Jonathan Kraft talked with Jackie MacMullan about the Patriots’ run in the 2000s and Phil Jackson discussed how he led the Bulls and Lakers to 11 NBA Championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bourbonstreetshots.com/2014/03/02/2014-mit-sloan-sports-analytics-conference-day-1/|title=2014 MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference: Day 1 - New Orleans Pelicans - BourbonStreetShots.com|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other Day 1 highlights, panelists discussed the increasing use of analytics on the field, in the front office, and in the boardroom, including entrepreneurs sharing their stories in "Starting a Sports Business," featuring founder-CEOs Kevin Plank of Under Armour, Michael Rubin of Fanatics and Casey Wasserman of his eponymous sports marketing and talent agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/prishe/2014/03/01/2014-mit-sloan-sports-analytics-conference-a-review-of-day-1/ | work=Forbes | first=Patrick | last=Rishe | title=2014 MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference: A Review Of Day 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference continued to be a hotbed for recruiting and hiring within the industry. The introduction of a resume review session, "Career Conversations" between students and business leaders, and a panel on breaking into the sports world highlighted the opportunities and interest of the next generation of sports professionals who will carry forward the revolution.

===2015===
[[File:2015 Conference.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|2015 Conference]]
“This year it has been incredible to see the growth of sports analytics both in breadth and depth” conference chair Jessica Gelman exclaimed to kick off the 2015 Sloan Sports Analytics Conference. Continuing as the preeminent sports industry conference, SSAC15 also grew in breadth and depth as it pushed out the limits of data analytics and sport, delivering two days of groundbreaking innovation and discussion. The conference welcomed three commissioners: NBA Commissioner [[Adam Silver]], MLB Commissioner [[Rob Manfred]], and MLS Commissioner [[Don Garber]], once again highlighting the growing acceptance of sports analytics.

The much anticipated 2015 conference brought together leading sports innovators, influencers and technologies at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center February 27–28. The ninth annual conference drew more than 3,200 attendees (a 50% growth from 2014), representing over 100 professional teams and 300 sports industry organizations. Featuring 29 panels and 15 Competitive Advantage presentations, the conference delved into themes for every fan and industry professional with topics ranging from early analytic adopters, player contract negotiations, entrepreneurship, sports betting, the future of sports media, the value of digital media for fan engagement, adapting and expanding the game for the modern fan and the future of sports analytics. Attendees enjoyed insights from [[Shane Battier]] and [[Sue Bird]] equating data analytics to another tool in their arsenal similar to a jump shot or strength training; Commissioner Silver, [[Jonathan Kraft]] and Marie Donoghue shared their unique vision on media rights and the ever-changing landscape of fan consumption; and SSAC veterans Brian Burke, [[Nate Silver]], RC Buford and [[Scott Pioli]] got into heated discussions about how much to attribute  the  improvement of sports to analytics and how analytics will contribute to the future of sport over the next 5–10 years  Other conference speakers included industry veterans such as [[Wyc Grousbeck]], [[Sean Payton]], [[Oliver Luck]], [[Bob Myers]], [[Jackie MacMullan]] and many more. 
[[File:FutureofSportsMedia-FULL.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|2015 Conference]]
The SSAC research paper competition continued to remain at the forefront of sports analytics research and showcased some of the most exciting and cutting-edge developments in the theory and practice of sports analytics. Several teams of researchers and academics presented their findings to a panel of expert judges, who produced a split outcome, with two teams sharing the first-place prize. The first team, a group of statisticians at Harvard University, introduced “Counterpoints,” a framework for quantifying basketball players’ defensive contributions based on their ability to suppress and alter shots. The second team, a duo of analysts at Baseball Info Solutions, developed a method to quantify and more finely assign credit for pitch framing to catchers, batters, pitchers and umpires.

The conference featured two inaugural and fully interactive events: the Data Science and Visualization Zone presented by Booz Allen Hamilton and the SSAC Hackathon presented by ESPN’s Stats &amp; Info Group. The Data Science and Visualization Zone included groundbreaking technological demos, conversation areas, and presentations. The SSAC Hackathon featured students from top universities competing for a coveted internship with ESPN as well as professionals from industry leading companies. Participants analyzed and presented innovative ways to visualize NFL data in order to improve the fan and media experience.

The conference continued to be a leading recruiting and hiring tool for the sports industry. Lines were out the door early Saturday morning for “Career Conversations” as students met 1-1 with sports business leaders to learn about roles in the sports industry, followed by a panel on breaking into the coveted industry.

SSAC 2015 built on the successes of previous years’ conferences and continued to pioneer the field of sports analytics. With its original content, invited speakers and showcase of advanced technological innovations, SSAC 2015 once again set the industry conference standard in sports analytics.

==2016==
“We had 175 folks at that first conference…this year we have more speakers than we had attendees [at that first conference]” said conference chair Jessica Gelman in her opening remarks of the 2016 Sloan Sports Analytics Conference. As the conference celebrated its 10th year—-its #DecadeOfData—-Gelman and fellow co-chair Daryl Morey reflected on the roots of the preeminent sports industry conference—fondly referred to as the “Super Bowl of Analytics” and “Dork-a-Palooza”—and the massive growth of both the conference and the sports analytics industry as a whole in those ten short years. 

The much anticipated 10th anniversary conference brought together leaders from across the sports community—from teams to players, innovators and influencers—at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center on March 11-12. The 2016 conference, presented by ESPN, grew to new heights in both size and content with nearly 4,000 attendees (20% growth from 2015), over 1,500 students from over 320 academic institutions, 130 teams and leagues and 300 industries attending more content than ever before. The conference featured 6 more panels, double the number of Competitive Advantage talks, the introduction of workshops, and the first ever Facebook live stream of a panel, which reached over 312,000 viewers. Attendees contributed record-breaking conference interactions over the course of the weekend, with over 15,000 posts utilizing the hashtag #SSAC16, over 60 million impressions and over 13,000 accounts viewing the conference snapchat filter.
The conference opened with a reference to its earliest inspiration: a Moneyball reunion panel with Bill James, Michael Lewis and Paul DePodesta. Throughout the rest of the weekend, industry leaders covered topics ranging from new scientific developments in panels on sports science and wearable technology, to sports business panels on modern sports finance and the future of the front office, to one-on-ones with NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and Nate Silver. Attendees were treated to insights from Jonathan Kraft, Michael Rubin and Jared Smith on the ways sports organizations are connecting in a more personalized manner and generating targeted content faster to enhance the fan experience. Jackie MacMullan closed the conference by moderating a high-energy discussion on player retention, building a winner and the overall future of the front office between Nick Caserio, Jeff Luhnow, Bob Myers and Daryl Morey. Other conference speakers included Stan Kroenke, Sam Kennedy, Wyc Grousbeck, Shane Battier, Steve Pagliuca, Vivek Ranadive, Oliver Luck, Michelle McKenna-Doyle, Sue Bird and many more. 

While league and industry leaders spoke about the current applications of analytics in the panel rooms, the newest advances in sports analytics thinking and technology were showcased in the research papers competition, startup competition, the data visualization room and the Hack-a-thon. A team of Australian researchers won the prestigious Research Paper competition presented by Ticketmaster for their work using Hawkeye technology to discover player patterns in tennis, and, in turn, predict the probability of a given player winning a point. 

The conference continued to be a leading resource for developing new talent in the world of sports with the Hackathon, presented by ESPN, the MBA case competition presented by Ticketmaster—which was won by a team from McGill University—and career conversations providing opportunities for the 1,000+ students in attendance to network and demonstrate their industry skills. 

The weekend concluded with the presentation of the Alpha Awards, as the conference recognized achievement across the entire landscape of sports analytics, as well as special recognition to the ten devotees who been a part of every conference thus far. Through the increasing number of dedicated attendees and the growth and development of the sports analytics field, SSAC 2016 was able to build on the success of previous conferences and again set the industry conference standard in sports analytics.

In [[microeconomics|microeconomic]] theory, the '''Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution''' ('''MRTS''')—or '''Technical Rate of Substitution''' ('''TRS''')—is the amount by which the quantity of one input has to be reduced (&lt;math&gt;-\Delta x_2&lt;/math&gt;) when one extra unit of another input is used (&lt;math&gt;\Delta x_1 = 1&lt;/math&gt;), so that output remains constant (&lt;math&gt;y = \bar{y}&lt;/math&gt;).

&lt;math&gt;MRTS(x_1,x_2) =-\frac{\Delta x_2}{\Delta x_1} = \frac{MP_1}{MP_2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;MP_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;MP_2&lt;/math&gt; are the [[marginal product]]s of input 1 and input 2, respectively.

Along an [[isoquant]], the MRTS shows the rate at which one input (e.g. capital or labor) may be substituted for another, while maintaining the same level of output. Thus the MRTS is the absolute value of the slope of an isoquant at the point in question.

When relative input usages are optimal, the marginal rate of technical substitution is equal to the relative unit costs of the inputs, and the slope of the isoquant at the chosen point equals the slope of the [[isocost|isocost curve]] (see [[Conditional factor demands]]). It is the rate at which one input is substituted for another to maintain the same level of output.

'''Metal prices''' (metal commodities) are only for a few metals quoted on exchanges. Only [[aluminium alloy]], [[aluminium]], [[copper]], [[lead]], [[nickel]], [[tin]], [[zinc]] and Nasaac (North American special aluminium alloy) are exchange traded commodities. Other metals (like [[bismuth]], [[selenium]], [[tellurium]], and many others) are traded on market demand and the buyers/sellers themselves set the price.

The [[London Metal Exchange]] which trades the commodities mentioned above is planning to add trading contracts for [[cobalt]] and [[molybdenum]] in the course of 2009/2010.

Contracts traded on metal exchanges are also called [[futures contract]]s.

==Pricing providers==
There are companies which provide a pricing service set the price by talking to producers, traders and consumers. These prices are more an indication than an actual exchange price.

Unlike the prices on an exchange, pricing providers tend to give a weekly or [[Biweekly|bi-weekly]] price. For each commodity they quote a range (low and high price) which reflect the buying and selling rbout 9-fold due to China's transition from light to heavy industry and its focus on manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson Jeffrey. [http://theconversation.com/how-china-drives-the-australian-iron-ore-boom-and-bust-9063 ''How China drives the Australian iron ore boom (and bust) '']. 27 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; (China became the world's largest consumer of iron ore in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;Leaver Richard. [http://asaa.asn.au/ASAA2010/reviewed_papers/Leaver-Richard.pdf ''Same bed, different nightmares: Stern Hu, the iron ore-war, and Australia-China relations''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321235050/http://asaa.asn.au/ASAA2010/reviewed_papers/Leaver-Richard.pdf |date=2015-03-21 }}. 18th Biennial Conference of the Asian Studies Association of Australia in Adelaide, 5-8 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and accounts for over half of global metal consumption.)&lt;ref&gt;Metal prices. Economist, February 4th-10th 2017, page 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metal commodities==
The commodities quoted have a specific grade and quality of the forms in which they are most often traded.

An example:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! valign="top" | Commodity
| Cobalt
|-
! valign="top" | Traded forms
| Cobalt min 99.3% Russian&lt;br&gt;Cobalt min 99.8% - aerospace application
|}

Cobalt is an important export product of Russia and therefore the Russian quality is often traded. Another form of cobalt crucial to the [[Aerospace|aerospace industry]] is a high grade form of cobalt with 99.8% purity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5838">The '''Montgomery Building''' is the last surviving [[Western false front architecture|false-front]] structure and the oldest existing business building in the City of [[El Paso, Texas]].

==History==
The Montgomery Building was built as the [[United States|American]] El Paso, as opposed to a [[Mexico|Mexican]] El Paso, underwent a great transformation from a dusty [[adobe]] village to a thriving city following the arrival of the railroad on May 13, 1881. The [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] had just arrived in El Paso and two other railroads were approaching the outskirts of the [[El Paso County, Texas|county]]. A great commercial building boom followed as [[lumber]] and [[brick]] structures, some two stories high, began replacing adobe ones. [[El Paso Street]] became a bustling center of commerce running from [[San Jacinto Plaza]] on San Francisco Street to the ferry landing at the [[Rio Grande]].&lt;ref&gt;W.H. Timmons, El Paso: A Border History (El Paso, TX 1990), 171-72; C.L. Sonnichsen, Pass of the North: Four Centuries on the Rio Grande (El Paso, TX 1968), I, 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1882, just months after the [[Four Dead in Five Seconds Gunfight]], [[William J. Montgomery]] (1833–1899) built this structure on a vacant lot between two buildings that were situated North and South of the property. Montgomery made use of the two buildings' existing walls, constructing only a roof, floor, front wall and back wall. He ran a new wall down the middle, creating two new addresses, 216 and 218 El Paso Street.&lt;ref&gt;Dena Hirsch, “216/218 South El Paso Street: A Building History,” (unpublished paper, 1984), 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was typical of western frontier architecture of the late 19th century. It featured a false front to make it appear taller and more like commercial buildings found in the [[Eastern United States|East]]. Originally, the building housed a [[drug store]] and a [[book store]].

==Architectural significance==
[[File:DavesPawn1small.jpg|right|thumb|The wooden facade of the building lies beneath a modern sign but the cornice is clearly visible.]]
The outward appearance of the Montgomery building was typical of those built in [[Western United States|Western]] towns during the railroad boom of the late 19th century. Developers wanted railroad towns to look as much like eastern towns as possible so [[Masonry|stone]] and [[lumber]] quickly replaced adobe and [[Wooden log|log]] as the primary building materials. [[Timber]] was scarce in El Paso but the railroad brought milled lumber, much of it from the [[Cloudcroft, New Mexico|Cloudcroft]] area. Railroads also brought pressed [[tin]], [[cast iron]], glass and hardware that were used to simulate styles popular in the eastern [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Freed"&gt;Elaine Freed, Preserving the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains (Albuquerque, NM 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|67–68}}

The one-part commercial building is a simple box with a decorated wood façade and cornice. The architectural style of small, pitched-roof buildings with false fronts created the commercial core of the new [[Western United States|western]] towns during the mid-19th century.

The Montgomery building had one ground-level floor with a false front added to make the building appear taller. The false front was topped by a bracketed cornice typical of the [[Italianate style]] popular at the time. This created the impression that the building was larger and housed more businesses and people, similar to the main commercial streets found in eastern American towns.&lt;ref name="Freed"/&gt;{{rp|70}} In front of the original structure there was a wooden sidewalk covered by a wooden roof and hitching posts for horses. It is known exactly what the exterior of the Montgomery building looked like in 1882 from a photograph taken by [[F. Parker]] who documented many of the changes taking place in the city during that period.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, "216/218 South El Paso Street", 9, 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern times==
[[File:Dave'sPawn.jpg|right|thumb|Modern-day view of the Montgomery Building after store hours.]]
[[File:Downtown El Paso Texas pawn shop.jpg|right|thumb|Montgomery Building.]]
The two addresses have undergone many interior and exterior renovations over the years. They have housed drugstores, restaurants, shoemakers, and clothing stores. The building is now occupied by Dave’s Pawn Shop and a clothing store. With the arrival of the automobile and the paving of streets, the wooden sidewalks, post, and roofs were removed and conventional sidewalks were constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, "216/218 South El Paso Street", 13, 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the wooden facade of the building lies beneath a modern sign but the cornice is clearly visible. 216-218 S. El Paso Street is a classic example of western architecture from the boom era of the 1880s.

Situated on one of the past main commercial thoroughfares of the city, it continues to represent part of the rich frontier heritage of El Paso and is one of the few remaining structures from the original commercial district of the [[Old West]]ern town of El Paso.

The addresses 216 and 218 S. El Paso St. have remained in continuous use for more than one hundred and twenty years making it the oldest surviving commercial structure in the City of El Paso.

'''Nigel Hollis''' (born 1958) is an author, analyst, researcher, speaker, and commentator on marketing.&lt;ref&gt;Wave Festival [http://www.wavefestival.com.br/en/program.htm "The Wave Festival, Rio"], "Wave Festival", April 18, 2011, accessed July 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He is the author of ''The Global Brand: How to create and develop lasting brand value in the world market''&lt;ref&gt;The Global Brand [http://www.theglobalbrandonline.com/ "The Global Brand"], "The Global Brand Online", 2008, accessed July 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; published by [[Palgrave Macmillan]] in 2008, and is the Executive Vice President of market research agency, [[Millward Brown]].

== Book contributions ==

Hollis contributed a chapter to [[Martin Lindstrom|Martin Lindstrom's]] 2005 book ''BRAND Sense'', in which Lindstrom described research that was designed by Hollis and conducted by [[Millward Brown]] specifically for the book. Hollis also contributed a comparable chapter to Lindstrom's 2003 book ''BRANDchild''.

==''HotWired'' ad effectiveness study ==

Designed by Rex Briggs, then head of research at ''[[HotWired]]'', with the technical support of ''HotWired'' staff including Joshua Grossnickle and Oliver Raskin, ''HotWired'' used some of Millward Brown measurement scales.  But the methodology differed significantly from brand tracking, for which Millward Brown was known.  Hollis was instrumental in getting ''HotWired'' to work with Millward Brown, and this 1996 landmark study of online advertising, proving that banner ads could have a branding effect before clickthrough is noted as the first study of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, Stuart, Banner Ads On Internet Attract Users, Dec 3, 1996, New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''online media cooperative''' is an autonomous association of similar businesses or organizations who voluntarily join together around an online media platform for their mutual and individual benefit. The businesses in an online media cooperative are typically within the same industry ex: drug stores, pet stores, pizza shops and are located within a geographic region or nationally. The online media typically takes the form of a video, video series, or some other creative work that is outside the funding abilities of an individual business. The media elevates or otherwise promotes the core mission of the businesses in the shared industry in a manner that benefits the members of the cooperative individually.

The platform aspect of the cooperative allows for the unique, individual identification of each member in the cooperative based on some type of geographic location mechanism. This mechanism could be based on physical address, IP address, or proximity/attachment to short-range wireless communication systems such as Apple's [[iBeacon]] using mobile telecommunications devices such as cell phones, tablet computers or traditional computer equipment.

The intent of an online media cooperative is to improve the business environment of local stores and organizations. The [[disintermediation]] that the Internet brought about has benefitted consumers and businesses typically at the expense of small local businesses. The cooperative allows hundreds or thousands of these small businesses to join together in an economically affordable way to produce entertaining media that serves as a regional or national outreach program. This online media attracts an audience around the topic/mission and, when it and the overall online media platform is produced properly, creates a concerned and engaged "viewer" who is significantly more likely to conduct business with the local cooperative member.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9585">[[Image:RaduIrimescu.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Radu Irimescu in Air Force uniform]]

'''Radu Irimescu''' (December 9, 1890 &amp;ndash; May 1975) was a [[Romania]]n businessman, politician, and diplomat.

The son of an admiral, Irimescu joined the [[Romanian Naval Forces|Romanian Navy]] and, being first in his class, was sent to [[German Empire|Germany]], as a pre-[[World War I]] Romanian-German convention provided. Based in [[Kiel]], he was a cadet in the [[Imperial German Navy]] and, again at the head of his class, was appointed a German naval officer, serving two years on a [[Man-of-war|man of war]], then being obliged to return to Romania. [[Alfred von Tirpitz|Admiral von Tirpitz]] himself held Irimescu in high esteem. However, he became dissatisfied with his career in the Romanian Navy: after cruising the world on a German man of war, commanding a [[Danube]] [[River monitor|monitor]] or a [[Black Sea]] [[torpedo boat]] was not very attractive to him and he left the navy after two years. He was then granted leave to attend courses at the [[Technical University of Berlin|Royal Technical College of Charlottenburg]], from where he graduated with excellent marks.

During World War I, Major Irimescu served in the [[Romanian Air Forces]] and showed great skill as a pilot and as an organizer. He received a degree in [[engineering]] from [[Columbia University]] in 1920.

After the war, [[Jean Chrissoveloni]], a [[Bucharest]] banker, tasked Irimescu with organizing the [[Chrissoveloni Bank]] in [[New York City]]. He ran the bank from 1921 to 1928, successfully closing the branch because he sensed a financial crisis coming and because operating a foreign bank tended to be unprofitable because more burdensome business regulations were placed on such institutions. At the time, it was the only Romanian [[Banking in the United States|banking institution]] in the United States. After it closed on April 1, 1928, Irimescu, formerly agent and manager, stayed on for a time as its representative on [[Wall Street]].&lt;ref&gt;"Rumanians to Drop Bank Agency Here", ''The New York Times'', February 28, 1928.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Marie of Edinburgh|Queen Marie of Romania]] attended a luncheon in New York on October 22, 1926, Irimescu heaped praise upon his host country: "It is natural...that Romania should look today to America for good will and cooperation...The wealth and resources of America are stupendous. Her leadership and influence in the affairs of the world are paramount today. Her prosperity is well established and well deserved...Let us...express the wish for the continuous prosperity of the United States of America and that of the entire civilized world."&lt;ref&gt;"Queen Entertained at Bankers' Club", ''The New York Times'', October 23, 1926.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his return to Romania, Irimescu, an [[Independent (politician)|independent]], was appointed director of the Gas and Electricity Works of Bucharest. In August 1932, he was named Minister of the Air Forces in the [[Alexandru Vaida-Voevod]] [[National Peasants' Party]] cabinet, with the expectation that he would upgrade and modernize his branch of the military. Additionally, he served as interim [[Ministry of National Defence of Romania|Minister of War]] for a week in August–September 1937, in [[Gheorghe Tătărescu]]'s [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]] cabinet.

In 1938 Irimescu was appointed [[Foreign relations of Romania|Minister to the United States]]. This drew some concern from the [[American Jewish Congress]], as he had served in the recent [[Octavian Goga]] cabinet, which passed [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] legislation. [[Augustine Lonergan]], [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] for [[Connecticut]], forwarded these concerns to [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Cordell Hull]]. However, Hull reassured him, noting that as an aviation expert, Irimescu had served in all cabinets since that of Vaida-Voevod, regardless of party, and that he himself belonged to no party. He also mentioned that Irimescu had an American wife.&lt;ref&gt;"New Rumanian Envoy Is Approved by Hull", ''The New York Times'', March 11, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; The new envoy arrived in the United States with his wife on April 7, 1938, being greeted by a number of [[Romanian-American|Romanians]], including his brother Ştefan (1894-1967), active in the community. Upon his arrival he declared, "As far as I know, there is no anti-Semitism in Romania that deserves any special discussion or notice."&lt;ref&gt;"New Rumanian Envoy Greeted on His Arrival", ''The New York Times'', April 8, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1938, some three months after Queen Marie died, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine printed a wry article claiming, for instance, that "she had long since been forgiven by most Rumanians for her endorsements of face creams, her exuberant U.S. junket, and the fact that in the end most of her dowagerish intrigues gained nothing for Rumania."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,883033,00.html Marie]", ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' July 25, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; The next month, an offended Irimescu asked in the magazine, "Has not this great Lady done anything in Her life to justify a favorable comment on your part?" To his observation that "[[De mortuis nil nisi bonum]]", ''Time'''s editors replied: "De mortuis nil hokum."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,788265,00.html Letters to the Editor], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' August 15, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;

As might be expected for an ambassador, Irimescu expressed public support for the royal dictatorship established by [[Carol II of Romania|King Carol II]] (''see [[National Renaissance Front]]''). For instance, in a speech given at a social event on November 26, 1938, he proclaimed that "the last twenty years of experimentation with the so-called [[Democracy|democratic]] regime has shown that political parties could and would act against public interest", claiming that the new system was based on an idea "of organization, of order against chaos, of a regime of social harmony wherein the source of rights is work and one's fulfillment of one's civic obligations, and not the exploitation of the community for personal interest and rapid enrichment." He lauded the [[Constitution of Romania#History|new constitution]] adopted in 1938, which he said "sets up an equilibrium between liberty and authority...regulates the exercise of [civic] rights for the public good...insures...a disciplined liberty" and "disposes once and for all of partisan politics and libertine democracy."&lt;ref&gt;Rumania Seen Rid of Political Curbs", ''The New York Times'', November 27, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; He repeated similar sentiments when the constitution's second anniversary was celebrated on March 3, 1940: "The entire development of Romania in the last two years is wholly the outcome of the new Constitution."&lt;ref&gt;"Rumania's Basic Law Receives Praise Here", 'The New York Times'', March 4, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 9, 1943, Irimescu wrote a letter to ''[[The New York Times]]'' responding to criticism that Carol Davila, former Romanian Minister to the United States, had levelled against him in that newspaper. Irimescu denied having represented the [[National Legionary State]], claiming that as the King abdicated, he heard a [[Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company|Romanian Radio]] broadcast from Bucharest that [[Ion Antonescu]] had dismissed him; he wrote that he received a telegram from the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Romania]] the next day informing him of his dismissal and giving him until October 15, 1940 to pass on his account books to his successor. He stated that at the same time as his dismissal, all his property in Romania, "including bank accounts, securities, real estate" and furniture was confiscated, and that "Antonescu and his [[Iron Guard]] cronies have persecuted me relentlessly." As evidence of his "democratic ideals" he presented the fact that he became an [[United States nationality law|American citizen]] in November 1941. Regarding the [[World War II|ongoing war]], he opined that "Only a sincere cooperation of the democracies and [[Soviet Union|Russia]] can rebuild the world."&lt;ref&gt;"Dictatorship Not Approved", ''The New York Times'', April 14, 1943.&lt;/ref&gt;

Irimescu lived the rest of his life in the United States. In 1955, he was working for [[Floyd Odlum]]'s Atlas Corporation. That January, he attended a Motor Boat Show, buying a chrome-trimmed, 55-m.p.h. Coronado speedboat for about [[United States dollar|$]]5,500, ten minutes after the doors opened.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,861193,00.html Sailor's Delight]", ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' January 24, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Fairfax, 7th Lord Fairfax of Cameron''' [[Member of parliament|MP]] (1707–1793), was a Scottish peer and politician. He died at [[Leeds Castle]], England, which he inherited from his mother Catherine, daughter of [[Thomas Culpeper, 2nd Baron Culpeper of Thoresway]].

He was a younger son of [[Thomas Fairfax, 5th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]], and Catherine Colepeper (or Culpeper). Robert gained the rank of major in the service of the [[1st Troop of Horse Guards]]. He held the office of [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|Member of Parliament (MP)]] for [[Maidstone]] from 1740 to 1741 and from 1747 to 1754. He also was the MP for [[Kent]] between 1754 and 1768. Robert married Martha Collins, daughter of Anthony Collins, on 25 April 1741. He later married, Dorothy Best, daughter of Mawdisty Best and Elizabeth Fearne, on 15 July 1749.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thepeerage.com/p32216.htm#i322159 thePeerage.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

His title and immense domain, which he inherited in 1781, consisting of 5,282,000 acres (21,380&amp;nbsp;km²), was in possession of his elder brother, [[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]], during the [[American Revolutionary War]], but it was confiscated during the hostilities by the Virginia Act of 1779. Robert Fairfax was awarded ₤13,758 in 1792, by Act of Parliament for the relief of American Loyalists.

Robert died on 15 July 1793 without an heir so the Cameron title was left in abeyance. His cousin, [[Bryan Fairfax, 8th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]], visited London in 1798 and claimed the title (although he never actually used the title once it was granted to him). He lived in the [[United States]] where he was a priest of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]], and also a neighbor and friend of [[George Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VYcUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA191 Edmund Lodge, ''The Genealogy of the Existing British Peerage'', p. 191]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/historicsketchof00cart/historicsketchof00cart_djvu.txt Lindsay Fairfax, ''An Historic Sketch of The Two Fairfax Families''], p. 17-18&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Wood Johnson I''' (February 20, 1845 &amp;ndash; February 7, 1910) was an American [[industrialist]]. He was also one of the three brothers who founded [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]].

==Early life==
Johnson was born in [[Carbondale, Pennsylvania]]. His father was Sylvester Johnson III,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/M4Z9-14J |title=Person Details for Sylvester Johnson, "United States Census, 1850" — |publisher=Familysearch.org |date= |accessdate=2015-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his mother was Frances Louisa Wood. Johnson grew up with two siblings: [[James Wood Johnson]] and [[Edward Mead Johnson]].

==Career==
In 1861, Johnson accepted an apprenticeship in [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie, New York]] from his uncle James Wood to work for the apothecary of [[Wood &amp; Tittmer]]. This was a method to keep him from fighting in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} However, this was to become his training for a lifelong career. He later left Wood &amp; Tittmer in 1864, to work in New York City for [[Roushton &amp; Aspinwall]].

===Lister===
While working for Rouston &amp; Aspinwall, Johnson met [[George J. Seabury]] and they decided to leave the firm and go into business together under the name of [[Seabury &amp; Johnson]]. Both men were interested in [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]]'s discovery of the implications of sterile surgery and tried to make products that would assist in the operating room. Johnson worked 12-hour days to try to invent aseptic surgical equipment. By 1878, the firm was making $10,000 a month (or in 2017 dollars $258,046.31.)

However, Seabury and Johnson could not agree on how to distribute the profits of the firm. Seabury also did not approve of having Johnson's brother, James Wood Johnson, in the firm. In 1880, Johnson sold his shares to Seabury, and agreed to not go into the medical business for ten years.

===Johnson &amp; Johnson===
Meanwhile, James Wood Johnson and Edward Mead Johnson started a family business called [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]]. However, the firm was struggling to stay afloat, as it didn't have enough capital for a startup company. While the two brothers were going at it alone, Seabury was unable to pay RWJ the monthly payments that had been agreed upon when Johnson left the partnership. Seabury agreed to let Johnson re-enter the medical industry if Seabury could cease making the monthly payments. Johnson agreed, and joined his brothers' firm, providing the capital for a fresh start.

The new partnership gave Johnson half of the company's shares in return for management of the company. His brothers would receive thirty percent of the company. Johnson worked all hours of the day, going back and forth from the factory in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]] to the office in New York, and by early 1888, Johnson &amp; Johnson was making $25,000 a month.

===Kilmer===
Dr. [[Frederick Barnett Kilmer]] owned a local pharmacy in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Johnson met Kilmer in early 1887, and developed a lifelong friendship. After meeting Johnson, Kilmer became more involved in Johnson &amp; Johnson. He eventually became an employee and he would introduce one of the first medical research laboratories.

Kilmer was responsible for making many of the innovations in sterilized dressings. The first marketing items Kilmer introduced were medical manuals, guides for how to react when injured on board trains, such as when feet are squashed or when legs are broken at train stations or depots.

In time, Kilmer would influence most of America with his new products. By the late 19th century, railroads had taken most of the nation by storm. Americans were traveling more and farther than ever. To address the medical needs of travelers, Kilmer decided to introduce [[first-aid kit]]s. The [[Emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross symbol]] became as well known as the [[bald eagle]]. Soon, people believed that the first-aid kits were as important to their daily lives as railroads, light bulbs, and family. It became an American way of life to grab a first-aid kit when in need of help.

In 1890, Kilmer received a letter from a colleague asking for advice on treating a skin irritation on one of his patients. The patient had used medicated plasters and it was assumed that the plaster caused the irritation. Kilmer sent him a small tin of Italian [[talc]]. With the success of this treatment, Johnson &amp; Johnson started including containers of talc with its plasters.

==Personal life==
[[File:Evangeline Brewster Johnson by Prince Pierre Troubetzkoy.jpg|thumb|Evangeline Brewster Johnson (Prince Pierre Troubetzkoy, 1922)]]
In 1880, Johnson married Ellen Cutler. They had one child: Roberta Johnson.

Johnson later married Evangeline Brewster Armstrong. They had three children: [[John Seward Johnson I]], [[Robert Wood Johnson II]], and Evangeline Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cook |first=Joan |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/18/obituaries/evangeline-johnson-merrill-93-prominent-supporter-of-the-arts.html?pagewanted=1 |title=Evangeline Johnson Merrill, 93, Prominent Supporter of the Arts |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=1990-06-18 |accessdate=2015-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter Evangeline married composer [[Leopold Stokowski]] by whom she had two children.

In 1910, Johnson died of chronic renal insufficiency ([[Bright's disease]]) at the age of 64.

'''Schering AG''' was a research-centered [[Germany|German]] [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] [[pharmaceutical company]] headquartered in [[Wedding (Berlin)|Wedding]], [[Berlin]], which operated as an independent company from 1851 to 2006. In 2006 it was bought by [[Bayer|Bayer AG]] and merged to form the Bayer subsidiary [[Bayer Schering Pharma|Bayer Schering Pharma AG]], which was renamed [[Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals]] in 2011. Schering was listed on the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]] and had 26,000 employees as of 2004.

The American pharmaceutical company [[Schering-Plough]], formerly the Schering Corporation, was originally the US subsidiary of Schering AG, and merged with [[Merck &amp; Co.]] in 2009.

==History==
In 1851, [[Ernst Christian Friedrich Schering]] opened the ''Grüne Apotheke'' (Green Pharmacy) in [[Berlin]]'s ''Chausseestraße'', and in 1871 converted into the name ''Chemische Fabrik auf Actien'' (formerly E. Schering). This date is the company's date of incorporation.

The company grew strongly in the following years. In 1913, the company employed 935 workers, 112 [[Master craftsman#Germany|master craftsman]] and 180 office employees. In addition to the Berlin site, two factories were also located in Russia ([[Moscow]] and Wydriza) with over 1,000 workers and a plant in [[Great Britain]]. Turnover at the time was about 10 million [[German gold mark]], created with the production of photochemicals and pharmaceuticals. Important products produced were [[salicylic acid]], the antigout preparation [[Cinchophen|atophan]], various sleeping and disinfecting agents.

At the beginning of the 1920s, Schering took over the wash and colouring company {{ill|W. Spindler|de}} located in the Berlin district ''Köpenick''. In 1922, the management acquired the majority of shares in the chemical factory ''Chemischen Fabrik auf Actien'' (formerly E. Schering) from the [[Upper Silesia|Upper Silesian]] {{ill|Oberschlesische Kokswerke und Chemische Fabriken|de}}.

In 1937, the companies ''Kokswerke und Chemische Fabriken AG'' and the ''Chemischen Fabrik auf Actien'' amalgamated with the sister company ''Schering-Kahlbaum AG'' and, on the same day, renamed on account of the internationally respected name ''Schering'' to ''Schering Aktiengesellschaft''. The pharmaceutical business thus became part of a mining and chemical group, which also produced [[Radiography|radiographic]] products and [[pesticide]] products.

Schering was the manufacturer of [[Primodos]].

=== Bayer takeover 2006 ===
In March 2006, [[Merck KGaA]] announced a €14.6bn bid for Schering, which by 2006 had annual gross revenue of around €5 billion&lt;ref&gt;Schering AG press release. Feb 20, 2006 [http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/2005-a-record-year-for-schering-ag-55363567.html 2005 a Record Year for Schering AG]&lt;/ref&gt; and employed about 26,000 people in 140 subsidiaries worldwide.&lt;ref name=KumarMergers/&gt; [[Bayer]] responded with a [[White knight (business)|white knight]] bid and in July acquired the majority of shares of Schering for €14.6bn,&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Eve Laforte for First Word Pharma. July 12th, 2006 [http://www.firstwordpharma.com/node/144265 Bayer completes acquisition of Schering AG]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2007, Bayer took over Schering AG and formed Bayer Schering Pharma. The acquisition of Schering was the largest take-over in Bayer's history,&lt;ref name=KumarMergers&gt;B Rajesh Kumar. Mega Mergers and Acquisitions: Case Studies from Key Industries.

At the time of the merger, the company employed more than 26,000 people in 140 subsidiaries worldwide.  Schering's annual gross revenue was nearly €5 billion (2003).

Schering AG focused on the business areas of [[gynaecology]], [[andrology]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[oncology]], and [[Contrast medium|contrast agents]]. Schering's best-known products are probably its brands of [[combined oral contraceptive pill]]s. Other key products included the [[Interferon beta-1b|interferon-beta]] brand Betaferon (Betaseron in North America) and the paramagnetic contrast agent [[Gadopentetic acid|Magnevist]].

The largest German manufacturing facility was located in [[Bergkamen]].

In 1997 the company acquired Pharmavene for £105 million in order to access Pharmavene's drug delivery methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/shire-buys-us-drugs-delivery-firm-for-pounds-105m-1280736.html|title=Shire buys US drugs delivery firm for pounds 105m|author=Grimond, Magnus |date=1997-02-26 | work=The Independent|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the same year Shire acquired Richwood Pharmaceutical Company, forming Shire-Richwood Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/investment-column-shire-focuses-on-buying-richwood-1243915.html|title=Investment Column: Shire focuses on buying Richwood|author=Grimond, Magnus|date=1997-08-04 | work=The Independent|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000 to 2009===
In 2001 the company acquired Biochem Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2717558/Canadians-give-go-ahead-for-Shire-takeover-of-BioChem.html|title=Canadians give go-ahead for Shire takeover of BioChem|author=Dunne, Helen |date=2001-05-10 | work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shire's next acquisition didn't come until 2005 when it acquired Transkaryotic Therapeutics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.readabstracts.com/Business-international/UK-drug-maker-agrees-to-buy-Transkaryotic-Hedge-Funds-vex-a-Shire-takeover-of-Transkaryotic.html|title=U.K. drug maker agrees to buy Transkaryotic|date=|work=readabstracts.com|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two years later - in 2007 - New River Pharmaceuticals Inc, for a then company record of $2.6 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmatimes.com/mobile/07-02-21/Shire_buys_New_River_Pharmaceuticals_for_2_6_billion.aspx|title=Shire buys New River Pharmaceuticals for $2.6 billion|date=|work=pharmatimes.com|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the purchase of New River, Shire gained access and ownership of [[Vyvanse]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6468">'''Virtual CFO''' (or '''vCFO''' for short) stands for virtual [[chief financial officer]]. A virtual CFO is an outsourced service provider offering high skill assistance in financial requirements of an organization, just like a chief financial officer does for large organizations.&lt;ref name="IndiaTimes"&gt;[http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-12-19/news/45377498_1_smes-clients-startups "Virtual CFO services gaining traction in NCR region"] in ''The Economic Times''&lt;/ref&gt; A virtual CFO may be a single person or an entity.

== Target market ==

The mushrooming of the startup ecosystem has generated specialized service providers which fit the requirement of startups. Virtual CFO is one such specialized service provider. Startups normally do not have the resources to hire a full-time CFO.&lt;ref name="TECCPV"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=747tKaSdtgkC&amp;pg=PA394&amp;dq=virtual+cfo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zRj6UuypFc2nrgeshIHgCg&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=virtual%20cfo&amp;f=false ''Technology Entrepreneurship: Creating, Capturing, and Protecting Value''] by Thomas N. Duening, Robert A. Hisrich, Michael A. Lechter&lt;/ref&gt; "There have been studies claiming that among the top issues faced by Indian startup CEOs are hiring financial and legal experts," according to a virtual CFO.&lt;ref name="IndiaTimes"/&gt; Startups like to keep fixed costs low and having outsourced service provider provides them the flexibility of choosing services as and when required. A Virtual CFO provides strategic, value add services to a startup which cannot be provided by an accountant.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=z5sLg7JGu_IC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=virtual+cfo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zRj6UuypFc2nrgeshIHgCg&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=virtual%20cfo&amp;f=false ''Business Owner's Handbook: The Ultimate Small Business Book -- Focus on Management of Money and Leadership to Increase Company Value''] By Marty Koenig and Keith McAslan&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, VCFO services are typically used by small to medium-businesses with annual sales in excess of $1 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fintelligent.com/ Fintelligent]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Singapore, the market is mainly served by [http://supercfo.com/ SuperCFO], [https://www.cfocentre.com.sg/ CFOCentre] and [https://www.excide.co Excide]. SuperCFO and CFOCentre focus on experienced finance individuals that are parachuted into the company. On the other hand, [https://www.excide.co/ Excide] provides virtual CFO services with emphasis on their all-rounded team and technology capabilities. While there are many other accounting firms adopting the term, "[http://hirevirtualcfo.com/ Virtual CFO] ", most of them are merely bookkeeping services.

== Services offered ==

The primary role of a [[chief financial officer]] in any organization is to oversee the financial planning, maintain and report on the financial activities and manage [[financial risk]] of the business. A virtual CFO provides the same services but since the common clientele of a Virtual CFO are small businesses and startups, there are certain more services that are expected of them. Services offered by a Virtual CFO often follow the Financial pyramid of needs. In the basic level, a Virtual CFO is expected to be the bookkeeper of the client and has to take responsibility for the accuracy of the account books and interpret the financial information from the accounting data to the client. They make take responsibility for executing or overseeing the reporting process. On the more strategic side, they are the financial and strategic sparring partner from the CEO. Additionally, they are also responsible for suggesting measures to control expenditure and acquire capital at low cost.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffthomson/2013/02/14/signs-a-small-business-needs-a-cfo/ 'Signs a Small Business Needs a CFO'] in ''Forbes''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practice ==

Small companies may need a controller on a weekly or fortnightly basis. Virtual CFOs also offer one-time help with strategic transactions, financial processes, business plans and budgeting.

In the USA, Virtual CFOs earn between $55 and $250 an hour,&lt;ref name="TECCPV"/&gt; as per their level of expertise. Clients are invoiced on an hourly or monthly rate depending on the nature of service. Most firms provide tailor-made services and the service charges vary from client to client&lt;ref name="IndiaTimes"/&gt; This practice is gaining ground in India, with a thriving start-up and SME culture in the country. This sector has discovered new virtual CFO companies in the last three to four years, mainly because the start-ups want to focus in their core areas, leaving the technical job to technical people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-12-19/news/45377498_1_smes-clients-startups ''The Economic Times'']&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this practice should be differentiated from finance outsourcing. Finance outsourcing is commonly understood to indicate a trans-national outsourcing process, in which financial management of companies is generally outsourced from Western countries to low-wage group countries, like India, South Africa, Brazil, etc.

== Trademark ==

virtualcfo is a registered trademark of VirtualCFO, Inc. and vcfo Holdings, Inc. in the United States and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vcfo.com/legal&lt;/ref&gt; However, as a generic term "virtual cfo" is used by many finance outsourcing firms throughout the world.

== Professional qualifications ==

There is currently no official requirement as to the qualifications that a virtual CFO should hold. However, it is generally expected for a virtual CFO to have finance related university degree, professional accountancy qualification and sufficient relevant experience.

In addition, virtual CFOs can obtain the Qualified Cloud CFO (QCCFO) professional certification provided by the International Association of Qualified Cloud Accountants (IAQCA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaqca.com/qccfo/ |title=Qualified Cloud CFO (QCCFO) certification}} - official website of the certification&lt;/ref&gt; that is specifically focused on the knowledge that financial professionals need to deliver their services within the Internet and Cloud environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10144">A '''whipsaw strike''' (also called a '''selective strike''')&lt;ref&gt;In Germany, the term is "schwerpunktstreik".&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[strike action|strike]] by a [[trade union]] against only one or a few employers in an industry or a multi-employer association at a time. The strike is often of a short duration, and usually recurs during the labor dispute or contract negotiations—hence the name "whipsaw".

==Multi-employer bargaining==
As unionization spreads in an industry, unions often attempt to encourage employers in that industry to [[collective bargaining|bargain]] as a group. The goal is to negotiate an industry-wide&lt;ref&gt;This contract may be geographically limited and occur at the local, regional or national level. It may also be limited to a specific market, whether local, regional or national. See: Hardin, et al., ''The Developing Labor Law: The Board, the Courts, and the National Labor Relations Act,'' 2002; and Williams and Adam-Smith, ''Contemporary Employment Relations: A Critical Introduction,'' 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; contract which equalizes pay across employers, forcing businesses to compete on the basis of quality, innovation, and [[occupational safety and health]].&lt;ref name="Brisbin"&gt;Brisbin, ''A Strike Like No Other Strike: Law and Resistance During the Pittston Coal Strike of 1989-1990,'' 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; This activity is known as multi-employer bargaining.  Multi-employer bargaining has been common in the [[United States]] and other countries since the 1880s. It is more common in heavily unionized industries such as [[construction]], [[steelmaking]] and [[shipping|transportation]]; where there is high turnover due to the nature of the job (such as construction and [[stevedore|longshore operations]]); and where numerous small employers face a powerful labor union.&lt;ref&gt;Hardin, et al., ''The Developing Labor Law: The Board, the Courts, and the National Labor Relations Act,'' 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Although increasingly rare in the private sector in the [[United Kingdom]], multi-employer bargaining remains common in Western Europe (especially in [[Germany]]), [[Scandinavia]], [[Japan]], and some [[South America]]n countries (such as [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Mexico]], [[Peru]] and [[Uruguay]]).&lt;ref&gt;Williams and Adam-Smith, ''Contemporary Employment Relations: A Critical Introduction,'' 2005; O'Connell, ''Collective Bargaining Systems in 6 Latin American Countries: Degrees of Autonomy and Decentralization,'' May 1999; Tolliday, ''The Power to Manage?: Employers and Industrial Relations in Comparative Historical Perspective,'' 1991; International Labor Organization ''World Labour Report 1994,'' April 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; A few countries, such as [[Australia]] and [[Canada]], encourage multi-employer bargaining by law.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, "Multi-Employer Cohesion in Australian Construction," ''Journal of Industrial Relations,'' 1987; Wetzel, Maxey and Gallagher, "Management and Union Assessments of Multi-Employer Bargaining in Health Care: A Canadian Example," ''Journal of Health and Human Resources Administration,'' Spring 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Employers face an economic incentive to break away from the employer bargaining group.  If the employer does so and is able to negotiate a contract with lower labor costs, that employer will achieve a significant competitive advantage in the marketplace.

==Whipsaw strike in multi-employer bargaining==
To discourage employers from breaking away from the bargaining group, unions developed the whipsaw strike. In a whipsaw strike, the union strikes one employer (or just a few employers) in the multi-employer bargaining group. The strike is usually of a short duration (a few days or a week at most). The union strikes employer after employer. Strikes may occur one after another and may overlap, or there may be long lulls between strikes. The same employer may be struck repeatedly, with sometimes as little as 24 hours between strikes.&lt;ref name="Brisbin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Story"&gt;Getman and Kohler, "The Story of 'NLRB v. Mackay Radio &amp; Telegraph Co.': The High Cost of Solidarity," in ''Labor Law Stories,'' 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosenblum"&gt;Rosenblum, ''Copper Crucible: How the Arizona Miners' Strike of 1983 Recast Labor-Management Relations in America,'' 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of a whipsaw strike may vary.  In some cases, the strike is conducted only against an employer the union believes is considering quitting the employer association. In other cases, the job action is conducted against a strong employer who is committed to staying in the employer group. The strike serves as an example to keep other, weaker businesses (which have a greater incentive to leave the employer group) in line.  Sometimes, a whipsaw strike is used as a bargaining tool.  For example, the strike may be directed at an employer or employers in the group which the union believes are holding up an agreement, or to keep employers off balance in negotiations, weaken the employer group's economic strength, and exercise the union's economic power.&lt;ref name="Brisbin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Story" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosenblum" /&gt;

==Employer responses and legality==
Employer reactions to whipsaw strikes vary widely. In some countries which ban worker strikes, the whipsaw strike is illegal and employers are able to work with government law enforcement officials to end its use. In countries where the whipsaw strike is permitted, employers often counter this form of strike by [[Lockout (industry)|locking out]] all employees who work for the employer association and using [[strikebreakers]] to provide temporary or permanent replacements.

Few nations have addressed the use of lockouts during whipsaw strikes, however. In the United States, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] has ruled on the legality of the practice. The question before the Court was whether a lockout during a whipsaw strike was an [[unfair labor practice]] (ULP) under the [[National Labor Relations Act]] and its various amendments. In ''[[NLRB v. Truck Drivers Local 449]] ("Buffalo Linen Supply Co."),'' [[case citation|353 U.S. 87]] (1957), the Court held that such a lockout was not a ULP.&lt;ref name="Brisbin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Story" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosenblum" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''NLRB v. Truck Drivers Local 449 ("Buffalo Linen Supply Co."),'' 353 U.S. 87 (1957). This case is more commonly cited as "Buffalo Linen Supply Co." The National Labor Relations Board titles cases based on the ULP filed against the employer or the union.  In this case, the ULP had been filed against the employer, Buffalo Linen Supply Co.  However, complainant Truck Drivers Local 449 appealed the case to the courts.

'''William Henry Fitzhugh Lee''' (May 31, 1837 – October 15, 1891), known as '''Rooney Lee''' (often spelled "Roony" among friends and family) or '''W.H.F. Lee''', was the second son of General [[Robert E. Lee]] and [[Mary Anna Custis Lee|Mary Anna Custis]]. He was a planter, a [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[cavalry]] [[General officer|General]] in the [[American Civil War]], and later a [[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]] from [[Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = William Henry Fitzhugh "Rooney" Lee - Arlington House, The Robert  E. Lee Memorial  (U.S. National Park Service)|url = http://www.nps.gov/arho/learn/historyculture/william-lee.htm|website = www.nps.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Lee was born at [[Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial|Arlington House]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]], and named for William Henry Fitzhugh, his mother's uncle. At an early age, his father began to call him Rooney; what prompted him to use this nickname is not known, but it stuck as a way to differentiate him from his cousin [[Fitzhugh Lee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Daughtry |first=Mary Bandy |date=2002 |title=Gray Cavalier: The Life and Wars of General W.H.F. "Rooney" Lee |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4_yQTema8jIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=William+Henry+Fitzhugh+Lee+rooney&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjDleSYu83MAhXMOz4KHctEAxcQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=William%20Henry%20Fitzhugh%20Lee%20rooney&amp;f=false |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=Da Capo Press |pages=1–2 |isbn=978-0-306-81173-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rooney Lee attended [[Harvard University]], where he befriended [[Henry Adams]], who wrote about his relationship with Lee in chapter four of his autobiography, ''[[The Education of Henry Adams]].''
[[File:Robert E Lee 1845.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Rooney Lee, about 8 years old, with his father Robert E. Lee]]
Lee followed in his father's footsteps after graduation, entering the [[United States Army]] in 1857 as a [[second lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]]. He served with the [[6th U.S. Infantry]] under [[Albert Sidney Johnston]], and participated in the [[Utah War]] against the [[Mormons]]. In 1859, he resigned from the U.S. Army to operate his [[White House Plantation]], on the south shore of the [[Pamunkey River]], in [[New Kent County, Virginia]].

==Civil War==
With the outbreak of the Civil War, Lee was commissioned as a [[Captain (land and air)|captain]] in the Confederate Army cavalry and was soon promoted to major. He initially served as a cavalry commander for [[Brigadier General (CSA)|Brig. Gen.]] [[William Loring]] in the mountains of western Virginia during his father's [[Western Virginia Campaign]].  Loring's forces were transferred to the lower Shenandoah Valley and the command of [[Stonewall Jackson]] in late 1861, and occupied the town of [[Romney, West Virginia|Romney]] in early 1862. Lee was soon after assigned to the command of [[Major General (CSA)|Maj. Gen.]] [[J.E.B. Stuart]], who was leading the cavalry forces for [[Joseph E. Johnston]]'s Army of Northern Virginia, in the [[Peninsula Campaign]]. After joining Stuart, Rooney Lee's regiment participated in Stuart's first ride-around the Union army, as well as the subsequent [[Seven Days Battles]] around Richmond.  During this time, Rooney's nearby White House plantation was burned to the ground, and his son Robert died of typhoid fever. 

During the [[Northern Virginia Campaign]], Rooney played a leading role in Stuart's well-crafted attack on General John Pope's supply base at Catlett's Station on August 22, 1862, capturing a paymaster's safe full of Yankee greenbacks.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.civilwarwomenblog.com/charlotte-lee/&lt;/ref&gt;  His cavalry regiment was assigned to the brigade of Brig. Gen. [[Fitzhugh Lee]], his cousin, for the [[Maryland Campaign]]. Following the [[Battle of South Mountain]], Lee was knocked unconscious after a horse fell from under him, and was unable to participate in the [[Battle of Antietam]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.civilwarwomenblog.com/charlotte-lee/&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon his recovery, he temporarily commanded Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry brigade in Stuart's [[Chambersburg Raid]]; his conduct earning him promotion to Brigadier General.  He then commanded the 3rd Brigade of Stuart's Cavalry Division at the Battles of [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]] mere weeks after the death of his infant daughter.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.civilwarwomenblog.com/charlotte-lee/&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] the following year, Lee was detached from Stuart's cavalry to defend against [[Stoneman's 1863 Raid]]. 

At the beginning of the [[Gettysburg Campaign]], Lee was shot in the thigh during combat at [[Battle of Brandy Station|Brandy Station]].  He spent the next two weeks recovering at [[Hickory Hill (Ashland, Virginia)|Hickory Hill]], Virginia, before being captured by Union forces.  As a [[prisoner of war]], he was sent to [[Fort Monroe]] for several months, before being shipped to [[New_York_(state)|New York]], where he was held until returned to the Confederate Army on February 25, 1864, in exchange for Union Brig. Gen. [[Neal S. Dow]]. 

In April 1864, Lee was promoted to [[Major General (CSA)|major general]] and commanded a [[division (military)|division]] in the Cavalry Corps during the battles of [[Battle of the Wilderness|The Wilderness]]; [[Battle of Todd's Tavern|Todd's Tavern]]; [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House|Spotsylvania Court House]]; and [[Battle of North Anna|North Anna]] in the [[Overland Campaign]]. With the death of Jeb Stuart, Rooney Lee's role increased. Lee's cavalry division patrolled the extreme right of the Confederate lines during the [[Siege of Petersburg]], defending against the [[Wilson-Kautz Raid]] at [[Battle of Staunton River Bridge|Staunton River Bridge]], [[Battle of Sappony Church|Sappony Church]] and [[First Battle of Ream's Station|First Ream's Station]]. His division was then sent north to briefly aid in the defense of Richmond at the [[Second Battle of Deep Bottom]], before supporting General [[Wade Hampton III]]'s [[Beefsteak Raid]], and then returning to Petersburg for the [[Battle of Boydton Plank Road]].

By last year of the war, Rooney Lee had risen to second-in-command of the Confederate cavalry in Virginia; General Hampton having been transferred to South Carolina to raise troops, and Lee's cousin, Fitzhugh, promoted to overall command. Lee's cavalry division screened the Confederate evacuation of Petersburg, notably at the [[Battle of Namozine Church]] during the [[Appomattox Campaign]].  He surrendered along with his father at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]] with only 300 officers and men, one-tenth the size of the command during the Petersburg Campaign.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.civilwarwomenblog.com/charlotte-lee/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postbellum career==
Lee returned to White House Plantation and planting after the war. Nearby, his younger brother [[Robert E. Lee, Jr.|Rob]] lived at Romancoke Plantation across the river in [[King William County, Virginia|King William County]].

After their mother died in 1873, Rooney inherited [[Ravensworth (plantation)|Ravensworth Plantation]], the old Fitzhugh family property (near present-day [[Springfield, Virginia|Springfield]]) in [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]] with {{convert|563|acre|km2}} of land. He moved there with his family from White House.

In 1875 Rooney was elected to the [[Virginia Senate]], serving until 1878. He was elected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1887. He served in the House until his death at Ravensworth in 1891. He is interred in the [[Lee Chapel]] at [[Washington and Lee University]] in [[Lexington, Virginia]], with his parents and siblings.

==Marriage and family==
Lee married twice, first in 1859 to Charlotte Georgiana Wickham, daughter of George and Charlotte Carter Wickham and a descendant of the attorney [[John Wickham (1763)|John Wickham]] and his wife. They had two children, Robert Edward Lee, born March 11, 1860 and died June 30, 1862 and Charlotte Carter Lee, born October 19, 1862 and died December 6, 1862. Charlotte Carter Wickham Lee died December 26, 1863.

On November 28, 1867, he married Mary Tabb Bolling. They had two sons, who both lived to adulthood: Robert Edward Lee III, born February 11, 1869 at Petersburg, and George Bolling Lee, born August 30, 1872 at Lexington.

Lee's mother, Mary Anna Randolph Custis, was the only surviving child of [[George Washington Parke Custis]] and [[Mary Lee Fitzhugh Custis|Mary Lee Fitzhugh]]. George was the grandson of [[Martha Washington|Martha Dandridge]] and step-grandson of President [[George Washington]].
 
Lee was also a descendant of [[Charles II of England]] through [[Charlotte Lee, Lady Baltimore|Lady Charlotte Lee]] (granddaughter of [[Barbara Palmer, 1st Duchess of Cleveland|Barbara Villiers]]), who married [[Benedict Calvert, 4th Baron Baltimore|the 4th Baron Baltimore]], and possibly, a descendant of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]], through [[Benedict Swingate Calvert]] (grandson of Lady Charlotte Lee), the illegitimate son of [[Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore|5th Baron Baltimore]] and of an unknown mother, who was supposed to be [[Melusina von der Schulenburg, Countess of Walsingham|Melusina von der Schulenburg]], illegitimate daughter of the King.
