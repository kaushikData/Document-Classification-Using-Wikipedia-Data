The '''Sayyd Alma Kalayy airstrike''' was a major [[friendly fire]] incident via [[airstrike]] during the [[War in Afghanistan (2001-present)|Invasion of Afghanistan]]. It happened on December 5, 2001 when a U.S. soldier responsible for calling in airstrikes accidentally misguided the Boeing B-52 bomber to strike a hill [[Battle of Sayyd Alma Kalay|held by American Special Forces]] and dozens of their Afghan allies.

== Events ==

Two days earlier, Captain (now Lieutenant Colonel) [[Jason Amerine]] and Afghan tribal leader [[Hamid Karzai]] [[Battle of Sayyd Alma Kalay|fought for the vital Arghandab town of Sayyd Alma Kalay]]. The [[Taliban]] withdrew from the town, and Amerine and Karzai entered the town. After both talked in the headquarters, Amerine left to discuss further airstrikes with another officer. While studying a map, a huge explosion hit the hill near them, apparently from one of their own bombs. Amerine was wounded, while many on the hill were killed or also wounded. A military investigation revealed that one of the men from the headquarters in Sayyd Alma Kalay who arrived earlier in the day made a mistake: he was on the ground calling in airstrikes when he accidentally gave the wrong coordinates for a [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]] that dropped the 2,000 lb bomb on the hill on which several Americans and Afghans were proposed.

== Deaths and Wounds ==

Three of Amerine's friends died:

*Master Sergeant Jefferson Davis, 39 years old, of Watuga, Tennessee
*Sergeant First Class Dan Petithory, 32 years old, of Cheshire, Massachusetts
*Staff Sergeant Brian Prosser, 28 years old, of Bakersfield, California

10 Afghans died as well. Forty Afghans and Americans, including Amerine, were wounded. The wounded were taken to [[Ramstein Air Base]] in [[Germany]] for treatment.

The '''2003 Italy blackout''' was a serious [[power outage]] that affected all of [[italian peninsula]] for 12 hours and part of [[Switzerland]] near [[Geneva]] for 3 hours on 28 September 2003. It was the largest blackout in the series of blackouts in 2003, involving about 56 million people.

==Causes==

Power went off at about 03:20 hrs. local time on 28 September 2003.  Initial reports from Italy's electricity supplier, [[ENEL]], stated that the [[Lukmanier Powerline|power line which supplied electricity to Italy from Switzerland]] was damaged by storms, causing it to trip and also the two 400 kV power lines between [[France]] and Italy to trip due to sudden increased demand from those two power lines. Later, it has been shown that the trip of the first line from Switzerland - the so-called "Lukmanier" line - was caused by a tree flashover. The trigger of the Italian blackout was a sluggish trimming of bushes and trees below HV overhead lines.

The [[Cascading failure|cascading effect]] disrupted power flow to Italy from the two main exporting coutries France and Switzerland. ENEL lost control of the grid in the next 4 seconds, with the lines to neighbouring countries tripped one by one amid the cascading effect. Swiss electricity company [[ATEL]] later concurred that a power line between Switzerland and Italy went out for a few hours.

Frequency dropped down to 49&amp;nbsp;Hz, due to the loss of import power. Within the next 2,5 minutes, frequency went further down until the under-frequency threshold of 47,5&amp;nbsp;Hz was hit and all generators were tripped according to the under-frequency protection settings. The reason for the blackout was that during this phase the under-voltage load shedding (UVLS) could not compensate the additional loss of generation, when ca. 7,5 GW of distributed power plants tripped during under-frequency operation (cf. figure "Frequency behaviour in Italy in the transitory period", UCTE report, April 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;115&lt;ref name="UCTE-report" /&gt;).

==Effects==

The night of 27 September 2003 is the night of the annual overnight [[Nuit Blanche]] in [[Rome]], the capital of Italy. Thus, many people were on the streets and all public transportation were still operating at the time of the blackout (at about 3:00 on 28 September 2003) despite the fact that it was very late at night. The blackout caused the carnival to end early. Several hundred people were trapped in [[Rapid transit|underground]] trains. Coupled with heavy rain at the time, many people spent the night sleeping in train stations and on streets in Rome.

Throughout Italy, 110 trains were cancelled, with 30,000 people stranded on trains in the railway network. All flights in Italy were also cancelled. Police described the scene as chaos but there were no serious accidents.

The blackout did not spread further to neighbouring countries, such as [[Austria]], [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]], which are connected to Italy. Only part of the [[Canton of Geneva|Geneva Canton]] of Switzerland suffered a power outage for three hours.

==Restoration of service==

After three hours, energy was restored in northern regions. Electricity was restored gradually in most places, and in most cities electricity was powered on again during the morning. [[Rolling blackout]]s continued to affect about 5% of the population on the next two days (29–30 September) as the electricity company ENEL continued its effort to restore supply.

==Official report==
The final report of the investigation committee on the 28 September 2003 blackout in Italy was published in April 2004 by [[UCTE#History|UCTE]].&lt;ref name="UCTE-report"&gt;[https://www.entsoe.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/_library/publications/ce/otherreports/20040427_UCTE_IC_Final_report.pdf Final UCTE Report, 2004-04-27]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific research==
Researchers in [[physics]] and [[complex network]]s have modelled the 2003 Italy blackout as a cascade of failures in interdependent networks. Several nodes in the network of power stations failed, causing a failure of the Internet communication network, which in turn caused a further breakdown of power stations. The goal of research was to understand how to build more robust networks.&lt;ref&gt;Sergey V. Buldyrev, Roni Parshani, Gerald Paul, H. Eugene Stanley &amp; Shlomo Havlin. Catastrophic cascade of failures in interdependent networks. ''Nature'' '''464''', 1025-1028 (15 April 2010), http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v464/n7291/abs/nature08932.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2017–18 Qatar diplomatic crisis''' began in June 2017, when [[Foreign relations of Saudi Arabia#Qatar|Saudi Arabia]], [[Qatar–United Arab Emirates relations|United Arab Emirates]], [[Bahrain–Qatar relations|Bahrain]], [[Egypt–Qatar relations|Egypt]], the [[Maldives]], [[Mauritania]], [[Senegal]], [[Djibouti]], the [[Comoros]], [[Jordan]], the Tobruk-based [[Libya]]n government, and the [[Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi|Hadi]]-led Yemeni government severed diplomatic relations with [[Qatar]] and banned Qatar airplanes and ships from entering their [[airspace]] and sea routes along with Saudi Arabia blocking the only land crossing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Qatar-Gulf crisis: Your questions answered |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/06/qatar-gulf-crisis-questions-answered-170606103033599.html |website=www.aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=It’s a boycott, not a blockade |url=https://gulfnews.com/opinion/editorials/it-s-a-boycott-not-a-blockade-1.2043769 |accessdate=August 31, 2018 |work=Gulf News |date=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saudi-led coalition cited Qatar's alleged [[Qatar and state-sponsored terrorism|support for terrorism]] as the main reason for their actions, insisting that [[Qatar]] has violated a 2014 agreement with the members of the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] (GCC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Doha's Actions May Destabilize the Region: Saudi Minister|url=http://newsweekme.com/dohas-actions-may-destabilize-region-saudi-minister/|accessdate=2 July 2017|work=Newsweek ME |date=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia and other countries have [[Al Jazeera controversies and criticism|criticized Al Jazeera]] and [[Iran–Qatar relations|Qatar's relations with Iran]]. Qatar claims that it has assisted the [[Qatar–United States relations|United States]] in the [[War on Terror]] and the ongoing [[military intervention against ISIL]].&lt;ref name=Tamim&gt;{{cite news|title=Sheikh Tamim denies Qatar has links to terrorism|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/region/qatar/sheikh-tamim-denies-qatar-has-links-to-terrorism|date=25 May 2017|newspaper=[[Khaleej Times]]|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial supply disruptions were mitigated by additional imports from Iran and Turkey, and Qatar did not agree to any of the Saudi-led coalition's demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Collins |first1=Gabriel |title=Anti-Qatar Embargo Grinds Toward Strategic Failure |url=https://scholarship.rice.edu/bitstream/handle/1911/99690/bi-brief-012218-ces-qatarembargo.pdf?sequence=1 |publisher=Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The demands included reducing diplomatic relations with Iran, stopping military coordination with Turkey, and closing [[Al-Jazeera]].

On 27 July 2017, Qatari foreign minister [[Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani]] told reporters that Egypt, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Bahrain were showing "stubbornness" to Qatar and had not taken any steps to solve the crisis. Al Thani added that the Security Council, the General Assembly and "all the United Nations mechanisms" could play a role in resolving the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/07/27/qatar-says-un-should-play-role-in-resolving-gulf-crisis.html|title=Qatar says UN should play a role in resolving Gulf crisis|date=27 July 2017|publisher=Fox News Channel|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 August 2017, Qatar announced that they would restore full diplomatic relations with Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Qatar To Reinstate Ambassador To Iran Amid Gulf Crisis|url=http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/qatar-to-reinstate-ambassador-to-iran-amid-gulf-crisis-1741557|date=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since he took power in 1995, [[Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani]] believed Qatar could find security only by transforming itself from a Saudi appendage to a rival of Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/13/world/middleeast/how-the-saudi-qatar-rivalry-now-combusting-reshaped-the-middle-east.html|title=How the Saudi-Qatar Rivalry, Now Combusting, Reshaped the Middle East|first=Max|last=Fisher|date=13 June 2017|work=The New York Times|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia withdrew its ambassador to Doha from 2002 to 2008 to try to pressure Qatar to curb its individualistic tendencies.

The exact reasons for the diplomatic break-offs are unclear, but contemporary news coverage primarily attributes this to several events in April and May 2017.

===April 2017 hostage negotiations===
[[File:Flag of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham.svg|right|thumb|250px|Flag of [[Tahrir al-Sham]], a Sunni militant group. Qatar is accused of paying the group $140&amp;nbsp;million in a deal that saw the release of hostages&lt;ref name="SolomonFinTimes" /&gt; and allowing of humanitarian aid to Shi'ite and Sunni villages in Syria.&lt;ref name=Hostages /&gt;]]
{{Further|2015 Qatari hunters kidnapping}}
In April 2017, Qatar was involved in [[2015 Zabadani cease-fire agreement|a deal]] with both [[Sunni]] and [[Shi'ite]] militants in Iraq and Syria. The deal had two goals. The immediate goal was to secure the return of 26 Qatari hostages (including [[House of Thani|Qatari royals]]) who had been kidnapped by Shi'ite militants while falcon hunting in Southern Iraq and kept in captivity for more than 16 months.&lt;ref name="FA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts|first1=David |title=A Dustup in the Gulf|journal=Foreign Affairs|date=June 2017 |url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2017-06-13/dustup-gulf}}{{subscription required|work=Foreign Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hostages&gt;{{cite news|title=Big Ransom and Syria Deals Win Release of Royal Qatari Hunters|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/world/middleeast/big-ransom-and-syria-deals-win-release-of-royal-qatari-hunters.html?mcubz=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second goal was to get both Sunni and Shi'ite militants in Syria to allow [[humanitarian aid]] to pass through and allow the safe evacuation of civilians.&lt;ref name=Hostages/&gt; According to the ''[[New York Times]]'', this deal allowed the evacuation of at least 2,000 civilians from [[Madaya, Syria|the Syrian village of Madaya]] alone.&lt;ref name=Hostages/&gt; What outraged Saudi Arabia and the UAE is the amount of money Qatar had to pay to secure the deal. According to the ''[[Financial Times]]'' Qatar paid $700&amp;nbsp;million to Iranian-backed [[Shia Islam|Shi'a]] militias in Iraq, $120–140&amp;nbsp;million to [[Tahrir al-Sham]], and $80&amp;nbsp;million to [[Ahrar al-Sham]].&lt;ref name="SolomonFinTimes"&gt;Erika Solomon, [https://www.ft.com/content/dd033082-49e9-11e7-a3f4-c742b9791d43 The $1bn hostage deal that enraged Qatar’s Gulf rivals: Doha reportedly paid al-Qaeda affiliate and Iran to win release of royal hunting party] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170605210800/https://www.ft.com/content/dd033082-49e9-11e7-a3f4-c742b9791d43|date=5 June 2017|title=}}, ''Financial Times'' (5 June 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the [[Riyadh Summit 2017|Riyadh Summit]] in late May 2017, many world leaders, including US President [[Donald Trump]] visited the region. Trump gave strong support for Saudi Arabia's efforts in fighting against states and groups allied with Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood, leading to an [[2017 United States-Saudi Arabia arms deal|arms deal]] between the countries.

Hassan al-Thawadi, secretary general of the Qatar World Cup supreme committee, has stated that the projects are going as scheduled for the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]]. Qatar's only land border and air and sea routes have been cut off by [[Bahrain]], [[Egypt]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE). As the blockade came into play, World Cup organizers were asked to investigate a "Plan B", [[FIFA]] however has confidence in not exploring a "Plan B" for an alternate 2022 host. According to Thawadi, all these logistical obstacles are being overcome and building progress is continuing with only minimal cost increases, in preparation for the first World Cup in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/10/gulf-blockade-poses-risk-qatar-world-cup-171006210428080.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=8 October 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171008154735/http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/10/gulf-blockade-poses-risk-qatar-world-cup-171006210428080.html |archivedate=8 October 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Israel]]'s defence minister, [[Avigdor Lieberman]], described the situation as an "opportunity" for Israel, stating, "Some [Arab countries'] interests overlap with Israeli interests, including the issue with al-Jazeera."

Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] has demanded al-Jazeera shut down its offices in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-demands-al-jazeera-offices-in-israel-be-shut-down/ |title=Netanyahu demands al-Jazeera offices in Israel be shut down |website=The Times of Israel |accessdate=30 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170727013412/http://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-demands-al-jazeera-offices-in-israel-be-shut-down/ |archivedate=27 July 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 June 2017, Egypt's deputy [[United Nations|UN]] Ambassador Ihab Moustafa called for the [[United Nations Security Council]] to launch an investigation into accusations that Qatar "paid up to $1 billion to a terrorist group active in Iraq" to free 26 Qatari hostages, including members of its royal family, which payment would violate UN resolutions. The Qataris were kidnapped on 16 December 2015 from a desert camp for falcon hunters in [[southern Iraq]]. The hostages were released eighteen months later in April 2017. Qatari diplomats responded to the Egyptian calls for an investigation by reaffirming their commitment to the UN resolutions towards eliminating the financing of terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-un-idUSKBN18Z26W |title=Egypt calls for U.N. inquiry into accusation of Qatar ransom payment |date=8 June 2017 |agency=Reuters |access-date=8 June 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170608222124/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-un-idUSKBN18Z26W |archivedate=8 June 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/latest-qatar-releases-initial-report-alleged-hack-47904088 |title=The Latest: Egypt seeks UN probe of alleged Qatar ransom |last=News |first=ABC |publisher=ABC News |access-date=8 June 2017 |language=en |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170608042824/http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/latest-qatar-releases-initial-report-alleged-hack-47904088 |archivedate=8 June 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the blockade of [[Qatar Airways]] from the airspace of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt, [[Oman Air]] has taken up a significant role transporting travelers from and to [[Doha]], mostly through Iranian airspace, while still allowing Qatar passport holders to book flights. The travel embargo has had a significant impact on foreign nationals living and working in Qatar, with about 100,000 Egyptians and citizens from other countries stranded there, unable to book direct flights or obtain travel documents for their return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=D.

On 31 July 2017, the agency asserted its neutrality in the conflict and announced that Qatar Airways will have access to three contingency routes over international waters in early August based on a preliminary agreement reached with the Saudi aviation authority (GACA) early that month. The ICAO, based in [[Montréal]], also reminded all member countries to comply with the [[Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation|1944 Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation]] and its addenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/08/qatar-airways-expected-access-air-corridors-170801020434530.html|title=Qatar Airways expected to access new flight routes|agency=Al Jazeera News|date=31 July 2017|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Arab Emirates banned Qatar-flagged ships from calling at [[Fujairah]].

On 8 June 2017 shipping giant [[Maersk Line|Maersk]] was unable to transport in or out of Qatar entirely.

===Energy===
Qatar is a global [[List of countries by natural gas production|leader]] in [[liquefied natural gas]] production. Despite the severing of ties, Qatari natural gas continues to flow to the [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]] and [[Oman]] through [[Abu Dhabi]] based [[Dolphin Energy]]'s [[Dolphin Gas Project|pipeline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Law|first=Bill|date=14 November 2017|title=Qatar Rides Out the Blockade|url=http://www.indrastra.com/2017/11/Qatar-Rides-Out-Blockade-003-11-2017-0006.html|journal=IndraStra Global|publication-place=New York, USA|publication-date=9 November 2017|volume=003|issue=11|pages=0006|issn=2381-3652}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pipeline meets about 30–40 percent of UAE's energy needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/06/07/news/qatar-uae-gas-pipeline/index.html |title=Qatar keeps gas flowing to UAE despite blockade|last=Alkhalisi|first=Zahraa|date=7 June 2017|website=CNNMoney|accessdate=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shipping constraints from the crisis have also rerouted multiple shipments of oil and gas to and from the Gulf, which has caused reverberations in many local energy markets.

The meeting expressed the need for an immediate resolution of the crisis which respects Qatar’s sovereignty. In a Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation, the United States expressed its readiness to deter and confront any external threat to Qatar’s territorial integrity.

According to a report by the Qatar-owned Al-Jazeera, "Qatari officials immediately dismissed the document as neither reasonable or actionable." Iran denounced the blockade. US Secretary of State [[Rex Tillerson]] said that some of the demands would be very hard to meet but encouraged further dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/amp/news/2017/06/iran-hassan-rouhani-condemns-siege-qatar-170625174347048.html|title=Archived copy|accessdate=30 June 2017|deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629232954/http://www.aljazeera.com/amp/news/2017/06/iran-hassan-rouhani-condemns-siege-qatar-170625174347048.html|archivedate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The year '''664 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. In the [[Roman Empire]], it was known as '''year 90 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'' '''. The denomination 664 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

'''''Barbara Frietchie''''' is a 1924 [[silent film]] about an old woman who helps out soldiers during the [[American Civil War]]. It is based on the play that had starred [[Julia Marlowe]] at the turn of the century which in turn was taken from the real-life story of [[Barbara Fritchie]]. There were two silent film versions, a [[1915 in film|1915]] version and [[1924 in film|1924]] version. The 1915 version, directed by [[Herbert Blaché]], starred [[Mary Miles Minter]] and [[Anna Q. Nilsson]]. The 1924 version, directed by [[Lambert Hillyer]], starred [[Florence Vidor]] and [[Edmund Lowe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibdb.com/production.php?id=5233 ''Barbara Frietchie'' as produced on Broadway by Charles Frohman at the Criterion Theatre, October 23, 1899 to January 1900; IBDb.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/B/BarbaraFrietchie1924.html ''Barbara Frietchie'' at silentera.com database]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lydia Knott]], mother of director Hillyer and a well known character actress in her own right, appears quite prominently in this film as a member of the Frietchie family but for some reason she is uncredited.

== History ==
The supposed origins of the legend are some 1996 postings written by Texas reporter Brian Bethel on a "ghost-related mailing list" relating two alleged encounters with "black-eyed kids." Bethel describes encountering two such children in [[Abilene, Texas]] in 1996,&lt;ref name="bethel"/&gt; and claims that a second person had a similar, unrelated encounter in [[Portland, Oregon]]. Bethel's stories have become regarded as classic examples of [[creepypasta]], and gained such popularity that he published a [[FAQ]] "just to keep up with demand for more info about the new urban legend."&lt;ref name=Snopes /&gt;&lt;ref name=DailyDot /&gt; In 2012, Brian Bethel told his story on reality TV series ''[[Monsters and Mysteries in America]]''. He wrote a follow-up article for the Abilene Reporter News, describing his experience and maintaining his belief that it was legitimate.&lt;ref name="bethel"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bethel|first1=Brian|title=Brian Bethel recounts his possible paranormal encounter with 'BEKs'|url=http://www.reporternews.com/news/columnists/brian-bethel/brian-bethel-recounts-his-possible-paranormal-encounter-with-beks-ep-384772497-348207271.html|website=[[Abilene Reporter-News]]|publisher=Abilene Reporter News|accessdate=1 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208221117/http://www.reporternews.com/news/columnists/brian-bethel/brian-bethel-recounts-his-possible-paranormal-encounter-with-beks-ep-384772497-348207271.html|archive-date=December 8, 2015|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the horror film ''[[The Haunting of Sunshine Girl#Sunshine Girl and the Hunt for Black Eyed Kids|Black Eyed Kids]]'' was produced with [[Kickstarter]] funding, its director commenting that the black eyed children were "an urban legend that's been floating around on the Internet for years now, I always thought it was fascinating".&lt;ref name=Columbian&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vorenberg |first1=Sue |title=Legend spurs local director's horror film |url=http://www.columbian.com/news/2012/dec/14/legend-spurs-film |website=Columbian.com |publisher=The Columbian |accessdate=30 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121217034359/http://www.columbian.com/news/2012/dec/14/legend-spurs-film |archivedate=December 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 episode of [[MSN]]'s ''Weekly Strange'' that featured reports of black eyed children is thought to have helped spread the legend on the internet.&lt;ref name=Snopes /&gt;

During one week in September 2014, the British tabloid ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'' ran three sensationalistic front-page stories about alleged sightings of black-eyed children, connected to the sale of a supposedly haunted pub in Staffordshire. The paper claimed a "shock rise in sightings around the world".&lt;ref name="de"&gt;[http://www.dailyedge.ie/black-eyed-ghost-children-1703721-Oct2014/ Here’s the actual story behind the ‘black-eyed ghost children’], ''Daily Edge'' 2 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Alleged sightings are taken seriously by [[ghost hunting|ghost hunters]], some of whom believe black eyed children to be [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]], [[vampire]]s, or [[ghost]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/black-eyed-child-returns-haunt-7846214|title= Black Eyed Child returns to haunt Cannock Chase | publisher = [[Birmingham Mail]]| author = Mike Lockley | date = Sep 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science writer [[Sharon A. Hill]] was unable to find any documentation of black-eyed child encounters, concluding that the tales are passed on as "friend of a friend" ghost stories. Hill considers the legend to resemble "typical spooky folklore stories" such as the [[black dog (ghost)|phantom black dog]], where the subject is not supernatural, and there may never have been an actual original encounter.&lt;ref name=randi.org /&gt; [[Snopes]] lists this phenomenon as being a legend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/black-eyed-children/|title=FACT CHECK: Black-Eyed Children|publisher=Snopes|author=David Mikkelson|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''blood sport''' is a category of [[sport]] or [[entertainment]] that involves bloodshed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title= Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary|chapter= Blood sport|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TAnheeIPcAEC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;dq=blood+sport&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zq3LT8-bHIT-8ASbkJHqDg&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwAjgo#v=onepage&amp;q=blood%20sport&amp;f=false|page= 134|year= 2003|edition= 11|isbn= 978-0-87779-807-1|access-date= 20 May 2017|publisher= Merriam-Webster, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common examples of the former include combat sports such as [[Cockfight|cockfighting]] and [[dog fighting]] and some forms of [[hunting]] and [[fishing]]. Activities characterized as blood sports, but involving only human participants, include the [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] [[Gladiator|gladiatorial]] games and the modern [[mixed martial arts]] (cage fighting).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-04-28/the-rise-and-risks-of-mixed-martial-arts/3977084|title= Cage fighting becoming the new blood sport|last= Cohen|first= Hagar|date= 27 April 2012|website= [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|access-date= 20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}
[[File:Two greyhounds with a hare.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|A hare caught by two greyhounds.]]
According to Tanner Carson, the earliest use of the term is in reference to mounted hunting, where the quarry would be actively chased, as in [[fox hunting]] or [[hare coursing]]. Before [[firearms]] a hunter using [[arrow]]s or a [[spear]] might also wound an animal, which would then be chased and perhaps killed at close range, as in [[Medieval hunting|medieval]] [[boar]] hunting. The term was popularised by author [[Henry Stephens Salt]].

Later, the term seems to have been applied to various kinds of [[Bait (dogs)|baiting]] and forced combat: [[bull-baiting]], [[bear-baiting]], [[cockfighting]] and later developments such as [[dog fighting]] and [[rat-baiting]]. The animals were specially bred for fighting. In the [[Victorian era]], [[social reform]]ers began a vocal opposition to such activities, claiming grounds of [[ethics]], [[morality]] and [[animal welfare]].

===Hunting and recreational fishing===

[[Animal rights]] and [[animal welfare]] advocates have sought to extend the term ''blood sport'' to various types of [[hunting]]. [[Trophy hunting]] and [[fox hunting]] in particular have been disparaged as "blood sports" by those concerned about animal welfare, animal ethics and conservation.&lt;ref name= "GreenwoodSalt1915"&gt;{{cite book|last= Greenwood|first= George|chapter= The Cruelty of Sport|pages= 1–33|title= Killing for Sport|editor-last= Salt|editor-first= Henry S.|chapter-url= https://www.gutenberg.org/files/49097/49097-h/49097-h.htm#THE_CRUELTY_OF_SPORT|year=2015|orig-year= 1915|publisher= [[George Bell &amp; Sons]]|author-link= George Greenwood|editor-link= Henry Stephens Salt|access-date= 20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Recreational fishing]] has sometimes been described as a blood sport by those within the recreation.&lt;ref name="Wyatt"&gt;{{cite book|last= Wyatt|first= Bob|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dLgi0yL1ddkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=blood%20sport&amp;f=false|title=What Trout Want: The Educated Trout and Other Myths|page= 3|year= 2013|publisher= Stackpole Books|isbn= 978-0-8117-1179-1|access-date=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limitations on blood sports have been enacted in much of the world. Certain blood sports remain legal under varying degrees of control in certain locations (''e.g.,'' [[bullfighting]] and [[cockfighting]]) but have declined in popularity elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Lewine|first= Edward|title= Death and the Sun: A Matador's Season in the Heart of Spain|page= 231|publisher= Houghton Mifflin Company|date= July 2005|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=A-6oZQc1rfgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn= 978-0-618-26325-7|access-date= 20 May 2017|author-link= Edward Lewine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Mitchell|first= Timothy|title= Blood Sport: a social history of Spanish bullfighting|publisher= University of Pennsylvania Press|date= July 1991|isbn= 978-0-8122-3129-8|page= 244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of blood sports are widely cited to believe that they are traditional within the culture.&lt;ref name="PR"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues2/2005/vol09n19/Cockfighting.html|title= Cockfighting Persists as Underground Sport|last= Stratton|first= Jim|date= 18 January 2005|website= Puerto Rico Herald|access-date= 20 May 2017|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081006071848/http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues2/2005/vol09n19/Cockfighting.html|archivedate= 6 October 2008|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bullfighting aficionados, for example, do not regard bullfighting as a sport but as a cultural activity.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} It is sometimes called a tragic [[spectacle]], because in many forms of the event, the bull is invariably killed and the bullfighter is always at risk of death.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Blood sports have been a common theme in fiction. While [[historical fiction]] depicts real-life sports such as [[gladiatorial games]] and [[jousting]], [[speculative fiction]], not least [[dystopia|dystopic]] [[science fiction]] suggests variants of blood sports in a contemporary or future society. Some popular works themed on blood sports are ''[[Battle Royale (film)|Battle Royale]]'', ''[[The Hunger Games]]'', ''[[The Running Man (novel)|The Running Man]]'', ''[[The Long Walk]]'', ''[[Fight Club]]'', ''[[Death Race 2000]]'', ''[[Amores Perros]]'', and "[[The Most Dangerous Game]]". Blood sports are also a common setting for video games (''[[Unreal Tournament]]'', ''[[Street Fighter]]'' etc.), making up much of the [[fighting game]] genre.

Developed science fiction universes such as ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Doctor Who]]'' feature different blood sports.

'''''Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson''''' is a [[rock musical]] with music and lyrics written by [[Michael Friedman (composer)|Michael Friedman]] and a [[Book (musical theatre)#Definitions|book]] written by its director [[Alex Timbers]].&lt;ref name=lesfreres&gt;[http://www.lesfreres.org/archives/06_jackson.html " 'Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson' production history"] lesfreres.org, retrieved August 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The show is a comedic historical rock musical about the founding of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. It redefines [[Andrew Jackson]], America's seventh President, as an [[Emo]] rock star and focuses on [[populism]], the [[Indian Removal Act]], and his relationship with his wife [[Rachel Jackson|Rachel]].

==Synopsis==

The show opens when the cast, dressed as 19th-century American cowboys and prostitutes take the stage.  They are led by [[Andrew Jackson]].  They sing about their eagerness to strip the English, Spanish, French, and, most importantly, the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], of their land in the [[United States|US]].  Along with this, they sing of the desire to bring political power back to the public and away from the elite ("Populism Yea Yea").

Jackson's childhood is shown in the [[Tennessee]] hills during the late 18th century.   His family and the local shoe cobbler die of cholera and in Indian attacks.  This leads him to join the military, where he is imprisoned by the British.  Jackson begins to express his disdain for the US government’s lack of involvement with the people of the frontier and how he wishes someone would stand up to them ("I'm Not That Guy").

Jackson is then shown as a young adult, regaling local tavern goers with his short meeting with [[George Washington]].  He is interrupted and attacked by several Spaniards.  Jackson defeats them, but is injured in the process.  A woman named [[Rachel Jackson|Rachel]] helps him to recover from his injuries.  They fall in love during his recovery and eventually marry, though Rachel is not yet divorced from her current husband ("Illness as Metaphor").  At the end of the song, news comes that British, Indian, and Spanish forces are making advances into American territory.  Meanwhile, the US government continues to do nothing to stop the attacks. Jackson realizes that if he wants this cycle to end, he must change things himself ("I'm So That Guy").

Jackson organizes a militia to remove Indian Tribes throughout the Southeast both by force and negotiation ("[[Ten Little Indians]]"). In the aftermath of a battle, he adopts a young Native American child named [[Lyncoya Jackson|Lyncoya]].  [[John Quincy Adams]], [[Henry Clay]], [[John Calhoun]], and [[Martin Van Buren]] are introduced as they express their concern over Jackson's unauthorized territorial expansion.  Jackson rebuffs their pleas, explaining how he has driven out the French and the Spanish, while acquiring more land than [[Thomas Jefferson]].

The [[Battle of New Orleans]] transforms Jackson into a national hero. He becomes Governor of Florida and decides to run for United States President in 1824.  Although he receives the most popular and [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral votes]], he is not elected President, due to the political maneuvering in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. ("[[Corrupt Bargain|The Corrupt Bargain]]").  Jackson spends the four years after the election at his home, [[The Hermitage (Nashville, Tennessee)|The Hermitage]].  He returns from political exile and forms the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].  During the presidential election of 1828, Andrew Jackson becomes a surprise candidate ("Rock Star"). This is grueling both publicly and personally to Jackson and his family.  Rachel, feeling as if she has no private life, questions Andrew's love for her versus the American People ("The Great Compromise").
  
Days before the election, a [[United States Senate|Senate]] panel led by [[Henry Clay|Clay]] investigates Jackson's past wrongdoings and accuses Rachel of bigamy.  Despite this, Jackson ends up winning the election and becomes the 7th President of the United States.  However, the accusation of his rivals, along with the stress of the election, leads to Rachel dying of grief.  He vows to use both his presidency and his wife's death as a mandate to "take this country back" ("Public Life").

Once in office, Jackson is faced with a plethora of problems, ranging from the [[Second Bank of the United States|National Bank]] to questions about Indian relocation.  Being the “People’s President,” Jackson begins polling the American populace on all executive decisions.  This draws the ire of Congress and the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]].  In response, Jackson consolidates [[Executive (government)|Executive Power]], thus making the Presidency more powerful than [[United States Congress|Congress]] and the Courts. At first, his exhilarating cowboy-like governing tactics are met with great enthusiasm by the average citizen.  But, as the problems grow tougher, the public begins to resent being asked to make difficult decisions ("Crisis Averted").

As the American people gradually turn on him, Jackson takes stock of all that he has lost: his family, his wife, and now the love of the American public. He decides he must take ultimate responsibility for the nation's choices and declares that he alone will be the one to make the unenviable policy decisions regarding the Indians' fate ("The Saddest Song").  He summons Black Fox—an Indian Chief who organized the remaining Indian tribes into a confederation against Tennessee settlers—in order to make one last deal with the Native Americans still living in American Territories.  Jackson implores Black Fox to peacefully move his people west of the [[Mississippi River]].  Black Fox asks for time to consult his tribe. But, Jackson violently snaps and decrees that federal troops will forcibly move the Indians West.

Near the end, the musical reviews Jackson's legacy and the views attributed to him.  Some believe he was one of America's greatest presidents, while others believe him to be an “American [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]].”  The final scene shows Jackson receiving an honorary doctorate at Harvard.  He reflects upon his achievements and his questionable decisions.  The show  telescopes out and we get a bird's-eye view of Jackson's damning legacy and our collective culpability ("Second Nature").

Finally, the company gathers to sing "[[The Hunters of Kentucky]]," before taking their bows.

===Controversy===
The original Off-Broadway run was criticized by the Native American community at large and a production in [[Minneapolis]] in June 2014 faced public protest by New Native Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Royce|first1=Graydon|title=Journalist|url=http://www.startribune.com/new-native-theatre-protests-bloody-bloody-andrew-jackson/261888441/|accessdate=13 June 2016|publisher=Star Tribune|date=June 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Fountain Theatricals, a student organization at [[Stanford University]] dedicated to musical theatre and performing arts education, cancelled its production of the show for their Fall 2014 semester production due to pressure from the Stanford American Indian Organization.

== Reception ==

''Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson'' received mostly positive reviews.  The ''[[New York Daily News]]'' called it "bloody entertaining" and Benjamin Walker "magnetic and energetic", applauding the show for its lightweight and silly atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/arts/2010/10/14/2010-10-14_bloody_bloody_andrew_jackson_review_old_hickory_meets_adam_lambert_in_spirited_p.html] ''The New York Daily News''&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted that "there is no show in town that more astutely reflects the state of this nation than ''Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson''."&lt;ref&gt;[http://theater.nytimes.com/2010/10/14/theater/reviews/14bloody.html] ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas one local critic of the San Francisco production (2012) referred to it as "an unmistakable exercise in American self-loathing."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bayareacritic-at-large.com/2012/10/bloody-bloody-andrew-jackson-san.html] ''Bay Area Critic-at-Large''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12387">[[File:Cardiff giant exhumed 1869.jpg|thumb|right|300px|alt=Photo|The Cardiff Giant being exhumed during October 1869.]]
[[File:Cardiff Giant.png|thumb|upright|The Cardiff Giant displayed at the Bastable in Syracuse, NY circa 1869.]]
The '''Cardiff Giant''' was one of the most famous [[hoax]]es in American history. It was a {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} purported "[[petrified]] man" uncovered on October&amp;nbsp;16, 1869, by workers digging a well behind the barn of William C. "Stub" Newell in [[Cardiff, New York]]. Both it and an unauthorized copy made by [[P.T. Barnum]] are still being displayed.

==Creation and discovery==
The giant was the creation of a New York [[tobacconist]] named George Hull. Hull, an [[Atheism|atheist]], decided to create the giant after an argument at a [[Methodism|Methodist]] revival meeting about [[Nephilim|Genesis 6:4]] which stated that there were giants who once lived on Earth.&lt;ref name=MagnussonP188&gt;{{Harvnb|Magnusson|2006|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a petrified man did not originate with Hull, however. During 1858 the newspaper ''Alta California'' had published a bogus letter claiming that a prospector had been petrified when he had drunk a liquid within a [[geode]]. Some other newspapers also had published stories of supposedly petrified people.&lt;ref name=Archaeology/&gt;

Hull hired men to quarry out a {{convert|10|ft|4.5|in|m|adj=mid|-long|1}} block of [[gypsum]] in [[Fort Dodge, Iowa]], telling them it was intended for a monument to [[Abraham Lincoln]] in New York. He shipped the block to Chicago, where he hired Edward Burghardt, a German stonecutter, to carve it into the likeness of a man and swore him to secrecy.

Various stains and acids were used to make the giant appear to be old and weathered, and the giant's surface was beaten with steel knitting needles embedded in a board to simulate pores. During November 1868, Hull transported the giant by railroad to the farm of his cousin, William Newell. By then, he had spent US$2,600 for the hoax (nearly 
{{inflation|US|2600|1868|2017|fmt=eq|cursign=US$|r=-3}}, adjusted for inflation).

Nearly a year later, Newell hired Gideon Emmons and Henry Nichols, ostensibly to dig a well, and on October 16, 1869 they found the giant. One of the men reportedly exclaimed, "I declare, some old Indian has been buried here!"&lt;ref name=Archaeology&gt;{{citation |last=Rose |first=Mark |title=When Giants Roamed the Earth |date=November–December 2005 |journal=Archaeology |publisher=Archaeological Institute of America |volume=58 |issue=6 |url=http://www.archaeology.org/0511/etc/giants.html |accessdate=April 26, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibition and exposure as fraud==
Newell set up a tent over the giant and charged 25&amp;nbsp;cents for people who wanted to see it. Two days later he increased the price to 50&amp;nbsp;cents. People came by the wagonload.&lt;ref name=Archaeology/&gt;

Archaeological scholars pronounced the giant a fake, and some geologists even noticed that there was no good reason to try to dig a well in the exact spot the giant had been found.  Yale [[paleontologist]] [[Othniel C. Marsh]] termed it "a most decided humbug".  Some theologians and preachers, however, defended its authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050212173955/http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/cardiff.htm Cardiff Giant, Geological Hall, Albany]&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, Hull sold his part-interest for $23,000 ({{inflation|US|23000|1870|r=-3|fmt=eq}}) to a syndicate of five men headed by David Hannum. They moved it to [[Syracuse, New York]], for exhibition. The giant drew such crowds that showman [[P. T. Barnum]] offered $50,000 for the giant. When the syndicate refused, he hired a man to model the giant's shape covertly in wax and create a plaster replica. He displayed his giant in New York, claiming that his was the real giant, and the Cardiff Giant was a fake.&lt;ref name=Archaeology/&gt;

As the newspapers reported Barnum's version of the story, David Hannum was quoted as saying, "[[There's a sucker born every minute]]" in reference to spectators paying to see Barnum's giant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyreference.org/library/refbarnum.html HistoryReference.org: P. T. Barnum Never Did Say "There's a Sucker Born Every Minute"]&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the quotation has often been misattributed to Barnum himself.

Hannum sued Barnum for calling his giant a fake, but the judge told him to get his giant to swear on his own genuineness in court if he wanted a favorable injunction.&lt;ref name=Archaeology/&gt;

On December 10, 1869, Hull confessed everything to the press, and on February 2, 1870 both giants were revealed as fakes in court; the judge also ruled that Barnum could not be sued for terming a fake giant a fake.

==Subsequent and current resting places==
The Cardiff Giant was displayed at the 1901 [[Pan-American Exposition]], but did not attract much attention.&lt;ref name=Archaeology/&gt;

==Imitators==
{{refimprove|section|date=October 2017}}&lt;!--only last entry has a citation--&gt;
The Cardiff Giant has inspired a number of similar hoaxes. 
*In 1876 the [[Solid Muldoon]] was exhibited in [[Beulah, Colorado]] at 50 cents a ticket. There was also a rumor that Barnum had offered to buy it for $20,000. One employer later revealed that this was also a creation of George Hull, aided by Willian Conant. The Solid Muldoon was made of clay, ground bones, meat, rock dust, and plaster.&lt;ref name=archaeology&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rose |first=Mark |date=November–December 2005 |url=http://www.archaeology.org/0511/etc/giants.html |title=When Giants Roamed the Earth |journal=Archaeology |volume=58 |issue=6 |publisher=Archaeological Institute of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1877, the owner of [[Taughannock House]] hotel on [[Cayuga Lake]], New York, hired men to create a fake petrified man and place it where the workers who were expanding the hotel would dig it up. One of the men who had buried the giant later revealed the truth when drunk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lifeinthefingerlakes.com/the-taughannock-giant/|title=The Taughannock Giant|author=A. Glenn Rogers|origyear=1953|date=19 August 2003|publisher=Life in the Finger Lakes|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1892 [[Soapy Smith|Jefferson "Soapy" Smith]], ''de facto'' ruler of the town of [[Creede, Colorado]], purchased a petrified man for $3,000 and exhibited it for 10 cents a peek. Soapy's profits did not come from displaying "McGinty", as he named it, but rather from distractions, such as the [[shell game]] set up to entertain the crowds as they waited in line. He also profited by selling interests in the exhibition. This was a real human body, intentionally injected with chemicals for preservation and petrification. Soapy displayed McGinty from 1892 to 1895 throughout [[Colorado]] and the northwest United States.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Jeff (2009). ''Alias Soapy Smith: The Life and Death of a Scoundrel'', Klondike Research. pp. 237–43. {{ISBN|0-9819743-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*During 1897, a petrified man found downriver from [[Fort Benton, Montana]], was claimed by promoters to be the remains of former territorial governor and U.S. Civil War General [[Thomas Francis Meagher]]. Meagher had drowned in the [[Missouri River]] during 1867. The petrified man was displayed across Montana as a novelty and even exhibited in New York and Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;Kemmick, Ed.

==Popular culture==

* During 1871, [[L.

* During 1903, [[Mark Twain]] wrote "A Ghost Story" in which the ghost of the Cardiff Giant appears in the hotel room in [[Manhattan]] to demand that he be reburied. The giant is so confused that he haunts Barnum's plaster copy of himself.&lt;ref name="SS1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Rizer|first=Fran |title=A Hoax of a Ghost Hoax| url=http://www.sleuthsayers.org/2013/04/a-hoax-of-ghost-hoax.html |work=Hoaxes |publisher=SleuthSayers |location=Columbia, SC |date=2013-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* George Auger, a [[Ringling Brothers Circus|Ringling Brothers]] circus giant, used the stage name "Cardiff Giant". In 1923 Auger was cast to portray the character "Colosso" in [[Harold Lloyd]]'s comedy film ''[[Why Worry?]]''. He died, however, soon after production on that film began, which sparked a nationwide search for a replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=George Auger: The Cardiff Giant|url=http://www.thehumanmarvels.com/george-auger-the-cardiff-giant/|website=The Human Marvels|accessdate=25 July 2017|date=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2099">'''Christmas Rock Night''' is a [[Christian music festival]] held annually during December in [[Ennepetal]], [[Germany]]. The festival does not focus on particular styles of Christian music, but leans toward harder forms including [[christian metal|metal]] and [[Christian alternative rock|alternative]].

==Background==
Founded in 1980, the first festival drew only three bands. Since then it has expanded to a two- to three-day event which regularly draws international artists such as [[Skillet (band)|Skillet]], [[Icon For Hire]], [[Fireflight]], [[P.O.D.]], [[Disciple (band)|Disciple]], [[Savior Machine]], [[Petra (band)|Petra]], [[Bride (band)|Bride]], and [[Split Level]].

The festival has spawned a few spinoff festivals. ''Fishcore'', a one-off festival, was held in 1999. It featured European bands such as Noise Toys, Lightmare, and [[Sacrificium]] in competition with each other. ''Legends Of Rock'' is a best-of festival held closer to Spring in 2007, 2008 and 2009. This festival features international bands such as [[Bloodgood]], [[The Electrics]], [[Glenn Kaiser]] Band, and [[Rex Carroll]], sometimes for reunion events.&lt;ref name="CM_07-1-25"&gt;{{cite journal |date=2007-01-25 |url=http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/articles/news/legends_of_rock/25771/p1/ |title=Legends Of Rock: Why?, Split Level, The Electrics, Tourniquet for German festival |journal=[[Cross Rhythms (magazine)|Cross Rhythms]] |accessdate=2007-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the festival, under the leadership of Detlev and Martina Westermann, took the German Promikon Award in the category "Best Christian organizers."

Tricia Olszewski of [[TheWrap]] referred to the film as "a sweet and inviting road trip, taking place in the colorful fall and accompanied by an indie soundtrack that lulls. It’s also a trip back in time, offering the now-archaic sound of a typewriter’s taps and the quaintness of a period in which a man and woman had to be married to secure a motel room. The fledgling relationship between Jamie and Deedee is touching, too, with both actors giving natural if not outstanding performances."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Olszewski|first=Tricia|title=‘Coming Through the Rye’ Review: Chris Cooper’s J.D.

Stephen Farber of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote "Sadwith works expertly with all of the castmembers, and he also brings visual flair to the pastoral scenes in New Hampshire.

      <comment>/* Response of Hawke Government to stock market crash */ Australia has an independent reserve bank which sets interest rates. The article claims that the government decided to delay a rise in interest rates for political reasons, but not citation is given. Attempting to influence independent monetary policy would amount to corruption, and would be a fairly significant claim that in turn should require citation of substantial supporting evidence.</comment>

The [[early 1990s recession]] saw a period of economic downturn affect much of the world in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The [[economy of Australia]] suffered its worst recession since the [[Great Depression]].

[[File:DJIA Black Monday 1987.svg|thumb|250px|[[Dow Jones Industrial Average|Dow Jones]] (July 1987 through January 1988)]]

{{Main|Early 1990s recession}}

In October 1987, the international [[Black Monday (1987)|Stock Market Slump]] saw markets crash around the world.

In the 1980s, Singapore Prime Minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]] famously predicted that Australia was at risk of becoming the "[[white trash]] of Asia" due to high unemployment, inflationary pressures and government debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-24/lee-kuan-yew-warned-australia-could-be-the-white-trash-of-asia/6342578|title=Singapore founding PM Lee Kuan Yew once warned Australia could be 'white trash' of Asia|work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC)|date=24 March 2015|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the comments, Bob Hawke was Australia's Prime Minister and he stated that the comment was "not an overstatement". The white trash quote is still used today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afr.com/news/politics/the-poor-white-trash-of-asia-a-phrase-that-changed-an-economy-20150324-1m5mzm|title=the poor white trash of Asia: a phrase that changed an economy|work=[[Australian Financial Review]]|date=23 March 2015|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, the [[Australian Labor Party]] Government of [[Bob Hawke]] had come to power in 1983. The [[Hawke-Keating Government]] shifted the Labor Party from its traditional allegiance to economic protectionism and have moved to deregulate Australia's finance industry restructure the role of trade unions.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/hawke/in-office.aspx#section7 |title=In office – Robert Hawke – Australia's PMs – Australia's Prime Ministers |publisher=Primeministers.naa.gov.au |date= |accessdate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ian Macfarlane (economist)|Ian Macfarlane]], Governor of the Reserve Bank from 1996 to 2006, has said that the financial excesses of the 1980s were of such a scale that they made the 1990s recession "inevitable", describing Australia's economy at the end of the 1980s as overstretched and vulnerable to contractionary shock. The pressure of high interest rates on businesses – many of which were "borrowed up to the hilt" – became relentless.&lt;ref name="theage2006"/&gt;

The debate as to the causes or extent to which international factors and domestic government policy contributed to the severity of the 1990s recession in Australia continues. Speaking in 2006, former Reserve bank Governor Ian Macfarlane said:&lt;ref name="theage2006"/&gt;

{{quotation|The emphasis on interest rates and deregulation at least reminds us that what we are dealing with is essentially a financial event. The recession of 1990-91was dominated by financial failure. In most cases, it was the fall in asset prices that meant that loans could not be repaid, thus transferring the distress to financial institutions.|[[Ian Macfarlane (economist)|Ian Macfarlane]], former [[Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia]], speaking in 2006.}}

==Response of Hawke Government to stock market crash==
{{Main|Hawke Government}}

The [[Hawke Government|Hawke Labor Government]] initially responded to the crisis by asking the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to defer its national wage case. Commodity prices dropped and the Australian dollar sharply declined. The Reserve Bank conducted a $2&amp;nbsp;billion intervention to hold the dollar at 68c but it crashed to 51c. In December 1987, Keating said that the Australian economy would weather the storm because the Hawke Government had already balanced its Budget and brought down inflation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"/&gt;

The Government postponed major policy adjustments, planning a mini-Budget for May. Hawke wrote to US President Reagan calling on the US to reduce its Budget deficit. The Business Council called for wage reductions, decreased government expenditure, a lower dollar and deregulation of the labour market. Seven months into the crisis, Hawke told the State Premiers that the "savings of Australia must be freed" to go into business investment for export expansion, and funding to the states was cut. A phase out of tariff protections was continued and company tax was cut by 10% to 39%. In the May mini-Budget, payment to the states was cut by $870&amp;nbsp;million and tax cuts deferred. The Government declared cost cutting was completed.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"/&gt;

[[File:Bob Hawke 1987 portrait crop.jpg|thumb|upright|Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]]. The [[Hawke-Keating Government]] oversaw the [[economy of Australia]] during the [[early 1990s recession]].]]

A surge in commodity prices began in 1986 and assisted the economy to a small 1987 surplus of $2.3&amp;nbsp;Billion. With commodity prices now over their peak, economic conditions were entering a decline, with high interest rates, a growing current account deficit, declining demand, increasing foreign debt and a wave of corporate collapses. Furthermore, the collapse of the Eastern Bloc economies, was to see wool and wheat prices decline, savaging Australia's agricultural sector.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"/&gt;

Treasurer [[Paul Keating]] budgeted a record $9.1&amp;nbsp;billion surplus for 1989–90, and Labor won the 1990 election, aided by the support of environmentalists. To court the green vote, environment minister [[Graham Richardson]] had placed restrictions on mining (notably uranium mining&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;) and logging which had a detrimental effect on already rising unemployment. David Barnett wrote in 1997 that Labor fiscal policy at this time "self-defeating as "with one hand it was imposing a monetary squeeze, while on the other it was encouraging spending with wage increases and tax cuts".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"/&gt;

By July 1990, Australia had entered severe recession.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2000"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rba.gov.au/publications/confs/2000/gruen-stevens.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021231227/http://www.rba.gov.au/publications/confs/2000/gruen-stevens.pdf |archivedate=21 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the Treasurer had insisted Australia would face a "soft landing", but after receiving the September quarter accounts indicating a large contraction of 1.6 per cent, he adopted a different political strategy, instead arguing that the downturn was a necessary correction by opening a press conference in November as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ross Gittins |url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/this-time-its-a-recession-we-dont-have-to-have-20110605-1fncx.html#ixzz2MXrn5Dxn |title=This time it's a recession we don't have to have |publisher=Smh.com.au |date=6 June 2011 |accessdate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/keating/before-office.aspx |title=Before office – Paul Keating – Australia's PMs – Australia's Prime Ministers |publisher=Primeministers.naa.gov.au |date= |accessdate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.unisa.edu.au/bhpml/anniversary/1990.asp |title=Hawke Government events – 1990 |publisher=Library.unisa.edu.au |date= |accessdate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|The first thing to say is, the accounts do show that Australia is in a recession. The most important thing about that is that this is a recession that Australia had to have – '''Treasurer [[Paul Keating]], November 1990'''.}}

The remark has continued to spark debate as to the extent of Keating's responsibility for the depth of the Recession. Former Reserve Bank Governor Ian Macfarlane has said that policymakers did not "set out to have a recession in order to reduce inflation. The recession happened because of the unwinding of the excesses of the 1980s, the international recession of the early 1990s and the high interest rates". High interest rates were employed to slow the asset price boom of 1988–89. Treasurer Keating, the Reserve Bank and Treasury itself generally agreed on the need for high interest rates in 1989 and the pace of their reduction.&lt;ref name="theage2006"/&gt;

The popularity of Hawke's prime ministership, along with the health of the Hawke-Keating political partnership deteriorated along with the Australian economy and Keating began to position himself for a challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/hawke/in-office.aspx |title=In office – Robert Hawke – Australia's PMs – Australia's Prime Ministers |publisher=Primeministers.naa.gov.au |date= |accessdate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government promised economic recovery for 1991 and launched a series of asset sales to increase revenue. GDP sank, unemployment rose, revenue collapsed and welfare payments surged.

According to former Reserve Bank Governor Ian Macfarlane:
{{quotation|The recession started in the September quarter of 1990 and lasted until the September quarter of 1991. During the recession, GDP fell by 1.7 per cent, employment by 3.4 per cent and the unemployment rate rose to 10.8 per cent. Like all recessions, it was a period of disruption and economic distress. It was particularly deep in Victoria, where a disproportionate share of the financial failure occurred. Victorian employment fell by 8.5 per cent compared with a fall of 2.1 per cent for the rest of Australia.|[[Ian Macfarlane (economist)|Ian Macfarlane]], former [[Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia]], speaking in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Macfarlane|first1=Ian|title=The Recession of 1990 and Its Legacy|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/boyerlectures/lecture-4-the-recession-of-1990-and-its-legacy/3353124|website=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Reforms were conducted between 1990 and 1991, with Australia's telecommunications opened to competition; and tariffs were reduced to five per cent, while the phasing out of textile, clothing and motor vehicle protection began.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

A slow recovery from recession began around the September quarter in 1991, though unemployment continued to rise until late 1992.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2000"/&gt;

==Financial crises and collapses==

A number of financial institutions failed around Australia, including the [[State Bank of Victoria]], the [[State Bank of South Australia]], the [[Teachers Credit Union of Western Australia]], the [[Pyramid Building Society]] as well as several merchant banks, a mortgage trust, and a friendly society.&lt;ref name="theage2006"/&gt;

In 1990, Victoria's [[Pyramid Building Society]] collapsed with debts in excess of $2&amp;nbsp;billion. With Victoria deeply in debt, Labor Premier [[John Cain II|John Cain]] resigned and [[Joan Kirner]] was elevated to the post of [[Premier of Victoria]]. Melbourne businessman [[Christopher Skase]]'s business empire crashed spectacularly and he fled to Majorca in Spain. The Liberal-National Coalition, led by [[Jeff Kennett]] was swept into office in a 1992 [[landslide victory]] and commenced a wide ranging program of expenditure cuts, privatisation of public assets, and economic reform to reduced government debt and rejuvenate the economy.

The [[State Bank of South Australia]], owned by the [[Government of South Australia]], collapsed in 1991. The bank had been a beneficiary of the commercial property boom of the 1980s, but by February 1991 the [[John Bannon|Bannon Labor Government]] had to launch a $970 million bailout due to its bad debts, and the bank's debts soon reached $3&amp;nbsp;billion. Premier Bannon resigned after appearing at a Royal Commission into the affair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.abc.net.au/sa/2008/05/top-10-financia.html |title=Top 10 Financial Moments That Shaped SA – ABC South Australia – Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) |publisher=Blogs.abc.net.au |date=29 May 2008 |accessdate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Western Australia suffering at the end of the 1980s boom, the Labor Party replaced Premier [[Brian Burke (Australian politician)|Brian Burke]] firstly with [[Peter Dowding]] and then [[Carmen Lawrence]]; the subsequent [[WA Inc]] investigation saw Burke jailed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/partys-over-for-burke-as-secret-deals-exposed/story-e6frg6pf-1111112505121&lt;/ref&gt; West Australian high flying businessman [[Alan Bond (businessman)|Alan Bond]] was declared bankrupt in 1992 and jailed in 1997 for corporate fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/671477.stm |title=ASIA-PACIFIC &amp;#124; Alan Bond released from prison |publisher=BBC News |date=9 March 2000 |accessdate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response of the Federal Opposition==
{{Main|Fightback! (policy)}}

The Opposition [[Liberal Party of Australia]] turned to economist [[John Hewson]] as its new leader. Hewson argued that the nation was in economic crisis. He said the Hawke-Keating government had increased the severity of the recession by initially encouraging the economy to boom post-stock crash as elections were approaching, which necessitated higher interest rates and tighter monetary policy than would otherwise have been necessary. Hewson called for a radical reform program and formulated a package which included a consumption tax policy and industrial relations reform to address the poor economic situation. The [[Fightback! (policy)|Fightback!]] policy was launched in November 1991. The comprehensive plan further destabilised Hawke's leadership.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;Barnett &amp; Goward; John Howard Prime Minister; Viking; 1997; Ch 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Keating Government==
[[File:Paul_Keating_1985.jpg|thumb|upright|As Treasurer in 1990, [[Paul Keating]] (pictured in 1985) famously described the 1990s recession as "the recession we had to have". He challenged Bob Hawke for the leadership of the Labor Party in 1991 and became Prime Minister of Australia.]]

{{main|Keating Government}}

The ACTU campaigned for a wage increase. Hawke brokered an increase for waterside workers and public servants. By April 1991, unemployment was nearing 10% and rising. On 3 June, Keating challenged Hawke for the leadership of Labor, but lost the vote and became a destabilising presence on the back bench. The new treasurer, [[John Kerin]] and Deputy Prime Minister [[Brian Howe (politician)|Brian Howe]] blamed Keating's 1990 economic policy for the poor state of the Australian economy. Industrial Relations Minister Peter Cook indicated an intention to introduce a more flexible wage system. In his July budget, Kerrin forecast a deficit of $4.7&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; In a press conference, Kerin was unable to recall what GOS—[[Gross Operating Surplus]]—stood for.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.couriermail.com.au/ipad/alp-elder-kerin-quits-in-disgust/story-fn6ck51p-1226114796757&lt;/ref&gt; In December, shortly before Keating's successful second challenge against Hawke, Kerin was removed as Treasurer and appointed Minister for Transport and Communications and the Minister for Finance, Ralph Willis, became Treasurer. Hawke attributed the change to loss of confidence in communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.unisa.edu.au/bhpml/anniversary/1991.asp |title=Hawke Government events – 1991 |publisher=Library.unisa.edu.au |date= |accessdate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1992, shortly after Hawke lost office and was replaced as leader of the Labor Party and as Prime Minister by his former deputy Paul Keating, unemployment had reached 11 per cent, the highest level in Australia since the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s. Australia had faced eight-quarters of declining economic growth. The new prime minister, Paul Keating, placed emphasis on expanding ties to Asia as a means of securing Australia's economic future and tied this to a culture agenda of reducing ties to traditional allies.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/keating/in-office.aspx |title=In office – Paul Keating – Australia's PMs – Australia's Prime Ministers |publisher=Primeministers.naa.gov.au |date= |accessdate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1992, the [[Keating Government]] released the ''One Nation'' policy, designed to target job creation. The government introduced the ''Australian National Training Authority Act 1992'' and the ''Disability Discrimination Act 1992'', which it hoped would assist the disabled to remain productive and off welfare. By the close of 1992, unemployment was still rising, but growth had improved.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;

Keating called an election for March 1993. He promised company tax rate and personal income tax cuts (the "L-A-W tax cuts") and campaigned heavily against the Hewson led Opposition's proposal for a Goods and Services Tax. Despite the economic conditions, Keating led Labor to victory. With an ever rising deficit however, Keating was unable to deliver the tax cuts promised prior to the election and sought to reduce expenditure.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;

In May 1994, the government launched a five-year economic plan entitled ''Working Nation''. By the end of the year, inflation had declined, growth continued to improve and unemployment was again below 10%.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;

==Aftermath==

Following the early 1990s recession, Australia experienced a record period of economic growth.

Speaking in 2006, former Reserve Bank Governor Ian Macfarlane said that a beneficial legacy of the 1990s recession was a lasting reduction in inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/business/why-the-recession-was-good-for-us/2006/12/01/1164777795744.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2 |title=Why the recession was good for us – Business – Business |publisher=smh.com.au |date=2 December 2006 |accessdate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liberal-National Coalition Government of [[John Howard]] was elected in a landslide victory in 1996. It reduced government expenditure, prioritised a return to Budget surplus and instigated industrial relations reforms to speed Australia's economic recovery. Following the 1998 Election, introduced a revised Goods and Services Tax. Inflation and interest rates lowered. Between 1996 and 2005, unemployment fell from over 8% to 5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/howard/in-office.aspx |title=In office – John Howard – Australia's PMs – Australia's Prime Ministers |publisher=Primeministers.naa.gov.au |date= |accessdate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; To strengthen the financial reporting framework for the financial sector, the [[Howard Government]] introduced the [[Corporations Act 2001]] and [[Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Act 2004]], following the recommendations in the Report of the HIH Insurance Royal Commission released in April 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asic.gov.au/clerp9 |title=Australian Securities and Investments Commission – CLERP 9 |publisher=Asic.gov.au |date= |accessdate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Euclid''''' is a visible to [[near-infrared]] [[space telescope]] currently under development by the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) and the Euclid Consortium. The objective of the Euclid mission is to better understand [[dark energy]] and [[dark matter]] by accurately measuring the [[accelerating universe|acceleration of the universe]]. To achieve this, the [[Korsch telescope|Korsch]]-type telescope will measure the shapes of galaxies at varying distances from Earth and investigate the relationship between distance and redshift. Dark energy is generally accepted as contributing to the increased acceleration of the expanding universe, so understanding this relationship will help to refine how [[physicists]] and [[astrophysicists]] understand it. Euclid's mission advances and complements ESA's [[Planck telescope]].  The mission is named after the ancient Greek mathematician [[Euclid of Alexandria]]. 

Euclid is a medium-class ("M-class") mission and is part of ESA's "[[Cosmic Vision]]" (2015–2025) scientific program. This class of missions have an ESA budget cap at around €500 million. Euclid was chosen in October 2011 together with [[Solar Orbiter]], out of several competing missions. The launch date is planned for 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/euclid/45403-mission-status/ |title=Mission Status |first1= |last1= |date= |publisher=[[European Space Agency]] |access-date=November 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific objectives and methods==
Euclid will probe the history of the [[metric expansion of space|expansion of the universe]] and the [[Structure formation|formation of cosmic structures]] by measuring the redshift of galaxies out to a factor of 2, which is equivalent to seeing back 10 billion years in the past.&lt;ref name="science"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/euclid/42267-science/ |title=Euclid Science Goals}}&lt;/ref&gt; The link between galactic shapes and their corresponding redshift will give a look into how dark energy contributes to the increased acceleration of the universe. The methods employed exploit the phenomenon of [[gravitational lens]]ing, measurement of [[Baryon acoustic oscillations]], and measurement of galactic distances by [[spectroscopy]].

Gravitational lensing (or gravitational shear) is a consequence of the deflection of light rays caused by the presence of matter that locally modifies the [[general relativity|curvature of space-time]]: light emitted by galaxies, and therefore observed images, are distorted as they pass close to matter lying along the line of sight. This matter is composed partly of visible galaxies but it is mostly dark matter. By measuring this "shear", the amount of dark matter can be inferred, furthering the understanding of how it is distributed in the universe.

Spectroscopic measurements will permit measuring the redshifts of galaxies and determining their distances using the [[Hubble's Law]]. In this way one can reconstruct the three-dimensional distribution of galaxies in the universe.

From this data, it is possible to simultaneously measure the statistical properties concerning the distribution of dark matter and galaxies, and measure how these properties change as the spacecraft looks further back in time. Highly precise images are required to provide the most accurate measurements, as any distortion inherent in the sensors themselves must be accounted for and calibrated out, otherwise the resultant data will be of questionable use.&lt;ref name="science" /&gt;

==Mission characteristics==
ESA selected [[Thales Alenia Space]] Italy for the construction of the satellite. Euclid is 4.5 metres long with a diameter of 3.1 metres and a mass of 2.1 tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=46676 |title=Euclid –  Spacecraft – Introduction |publisher=ESA |accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Euclid payload is managed by [[Airbus Defence and Space]]. It consists of a [[Korsch telescope]] with a primary mirror 1.2 meters in diameter, which covers an area of 0.5&amp;nbsp;[[square degree|deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]. An international consortium of scientists will provide a visible instrument (VIS) and an infrared instrument (NISP). These large format cameras will be used to characterise the morphometric, photometric and spectroscopic properties of galaxies:&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=46676&amp;fbodylongid=2157 |title=Euclid –  Spacecraft – Payload |publisher=ESA |accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* a camera operating at [[visible spectrum|visible wavelengths]] (550–920&amp;nbsp;nm) made of a mosaic of 6x6 [[e2v]] [[Charge Coupled Device|Charge Coupled Detectors]], containing 600 million pixels, allows measurement of the deformation of galaxies;
* a camera composed of a mosaic of 4x4 [[Teledyne]] H2RG detectors sensitive to [[infrared|near-infrared]] light radiation (1000–2000&amp;nbsp;nm) with 65 million pixels to:
# provide low precision measurements of redshifts, and thus distances, of over a billion galaxies from multi-color photometry ([[photometric redshift]] technique); and
# use a spectrometer to analyse the spectrum of light in near-infrared (1000–2000&amp;nbsp;nm), to acquire precise redshifts and distances of million galaxies, with an accuracy 10 times better than photometric redshifts, and to determine the [[baryon acoustic oscillations]].

The telescope bus includes [[solar panel]]s that provide power and stabilises the [[attitude control|orientation]] and pointing of the telescope to better than 35 [[milliarcseconds]]. The telescope is carefully insulated to ensure good thermal stability so as to not disturb the optical alignment.

The telecommunications system is capable of transferring 850 [[gigabits]] per day. It uses the [[Ka band]] to send scientific data at a rate of 55 megabits per second during the allocated period of 4 hours per day to the 35-m dish [[Cebreros Station|Cebreros ground station]] in Spain, when the telescope is visible from [[Earth]]. Euclid will have an onboard storage capacity of at least 300&amp;nbsp;[[gigabyte|GB]].

In 2015 Euclid passed a preliminary design review, having completed a large number of technical designs as well as built and tested key components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Euclid_dark_Universe_mission_ready_to_take_shape|title=Euclid dark Universe mission ready to take shape|publisher=[[ESA]]|date=17 December 2015|accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission execution and Euclid data==
Euclid will be launched on a [[Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz rocket]] from [[Guiana Space Center|Kourou.]] Following a travel time of 30 days it will be stabilised to travel a [[Lissajous orbit|Lissajous path]] of large amplitude (about 1 million kilometres) around the Sun-Earth [[Lagrangian point|Lagrangian point L2]].&lt;ref name="esaOperations" /&gt;

During its mission, which will last at least 6 years, Euclid will observe about 15,000&amp;nbsp;deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or about a third of the extragalactic sky (the sky facing away from the [[Milky Way]]). The survey will be complemented by additional observations about 10 times deeper pointing toward two different fields located close to the [[ecliptic]] poles and covering 20&amp;nbsp;deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; each. The two fields will be regularly visited during the whole duration of the mission. They will be used as calibration fields and to monitor the telescope and instrument performance stability as well as to produce scientific data to observed the most distant galaxies and [[quasars]] in the universe.

To measure a photometric redshift for each galaxy with sufficient accuracy, the Euclid mission depends on additional photometric data obtained in at least 4 visible filters.  This data will be obtained from ground-based telescopes located in both northern and southern hemispheres to cover the full 15,000&amp;nbsp;deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the mission. In total each galaxy of the Euclid mission will get photometric information in at least 7 different filters covering the whole range 460–2000&amp;nbsp;nm.

About 10 billion astronomical sources will be observed by Euclid, of which 1 billion will have their gravitational shear measured with a precision 50 times more accurate than is possible today using ground-based telescopes. Euclid will measure spectroscopic redshifts for 50 million objects.

The scientific exploitation of this enormous data set will be carried out by a European-led consortium of more than 1200 people in over 100 laboratories in 15 countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Switzerland, UK, Canada and the US). The Euclid Consortium&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.euclid-ec.org/|title=Euclid Consortium site|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also responsible for the construction of the Euclid instrument payload and for the development and implementation of the Euclid [[ground segment]] which will process all data collected by the satellite. The laboratories contributing to the Euclid Consortium are funded and supported by their national space agencies, which also have the programmatic responsibilities of their national contribution, and by their national research structures (research agencies, observatories, universities). Overall, the Euclid Consortium contributes to about 30% of the total budget cost of the mission until completion.

The huge volume, diversity (space and ground, visible and near infrared, morphometry, photometry and spectroscopy) and the high level of precision of measurements needed demand considerable care and effort in the data processing making this a critical part of the mission. [[ESA]], the national agencies and the Euclid Consortium are spending considerable resources to set up top level teams of researchers and engineers in algorithm development, software development, testing and validation procedures, data archiving and data distribution infrastructures. In total, 9 Science Data Centres spread over countries of the Euclid Consortium will process more than 10 petabytes of raw input images over 10 years to deliver by 2028 a public data base of the Euclid mission to the whole scientific community.

With its wide sky coverage and its catalogues of billions of stars and galaxies, the scientific value of data collected by the mission goes beyond the scope of [[cosmology]]. This database will provide the worldwide astronomical community with abundant sources and targets for the future missions such as [[James Webb Space Telescope|JWST]], [[European Extremely Large Telescope|E-ELT]], [[Thirty Meter Telescope|TMT]], [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array|ALMA]], [[Square Kilometer Array|SKA]] or [[Large Synoptic Survey Telescope|LSST]].

'''Festival of the Sun''' (FOTSUN) is an annual outdoor music festival held in December at the Sundowner Breakwall Tourist Park, [[Port Macquarie, New South Wales]], Australia. It was first held in 2001 and first ticketed in 2005.

==History==
Originally launched by Simon Luke who had starting running numerous small free festivals in the region with funds pulled together from small local business support with the concept of building a live arts industry in the region. Festival of the Sun had really officially become known by 2003 once it was moved into the local tourist park still as a free festival with self funding. 
2005 was the first ticketed year attracting approximately 1200 people. Festival of the Sun is coming into its 15th official year in 2018

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2289">The '''Flying Broom International Women's Film Festival''' is an annual [[Ankara]]-based [[film festival]] celebrating women's contributions to filmmaking.

Established by [[Halime Güner]] in 1997 in order to raise awareness and fight for [[women's rights|women's human rights]], it has been organized by the [[women's empowerment]] organization [[Flying Broom]].

The Flying Broom Women's Film Festival team is headed by Ayşegül Oğuz and Didem Baltacı. Other members of the festival's team are Sibel Astarcıoğlu, and Uğur and Ürün Güner. The festival gives out the Bilge Olgaç Honorary Award and the Lifelong Achievement Award. It is the only women's film festival in the world to give out the Fipresci Award.

==2005==
The 2005 festival was held from the 5th to 12 May 2005. The opening night ceremony presenters were [[Müjde Ar]] and Mahir Günşiray. Sevda Ferdağ was presented the Lifelong Achievement Award by [[Müjde Ar]], her co-star in Ağır Roman.
Former Lifelong Achievement Award winners are Sezer Sezin (2003) and Suzan Avci (2004). The Bilge Olgaç Honorary Award was given to Jeyan Ayral Tözüm (film and stage actress) and [[Sevin Okyay]] (film critic, journalist, TV presenter, author and the Turkish translator of ''Harry Potter'').

The theme of this year's festival was [[love]]. [[Greta Garbo]] was remembered with a special section on her centennial birthday. The nominees for the Fipresci Award included very popular films like Sally Potter's ''Yes'', Mania Akbari's ''[[20 Fingers (film)|20 Fingers]]'', Keren Yedeya's ''Or'', Lucile Hadzihalilovich's ''Innocence'', and [[Agnès Jaoui]]'s ''[[Look at Me (film)|Look at Me]]''. The winner of the Fipresci Award was ''To Take a Wife'' by Ronit and Schlomi Elkabitz of Israel.

'''''Glas Koncila''''' is a [[Croatia]]n, [[Roman Catholic]], weekly [[newspaper]] published in [[Zagreb]] and distributed throughout the country.

== Publishing history ==
The newspaper (whose title means "Voice of the [[Second Vatican Council|Council]]") began publication on October 4, 1962, at the initiative of the Zagreb Franciscans and based upon a decision made by the archbishop of Zagreb, [[Franjo Šeper]], as a mimeographed bulletin which reported on the events of the Second Vatican Council.

It was first printed on September 29, 1963, with the motto "The New Face of the Church". The publisher was the Archdiocesan Cathedra in Zagreb and the editor-in-chief was the head of this institution. It was issued every two weeks until the end of 1984. In December 1984, the publication's editor Živko Kustić was put under investigation for disseminating "misinformation" and was sentenced to two months in jail the following month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramet|first=Sabrina P.|authorlink=Sabrina P. Ramet|title=Nihil obstat: religion, politics, and social change in East-Central Europe and Russia|publisher=Duke University Press|year=1998|pages=168–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since January 1985, ''Glas Koncila'' has been a weekly newspaper, published jointly by the archdioceses of Zagreb, Split, Sarajevo, Rijeka and Zadar. From 1987 to 1991, the archdiocese of Belgrade was also one of the publishers. Since 2004, the publisher is again the Archdiocesan Cathedra in Zagreb.

== A promoter of conciliar renewal ==
''Glas Koncila'', a Catholic religious newspaper, reports on the events of the Church where the [[Croatian language]] is spoken and the Universal [[Christian Church|Church]], while also covering other important events from the religious point of view, particularly in the light of ethics, Christian morality and [[Catholic social doctrine]]. It popularizes various religious contents and explains the Sunday Biblical messages in a contemporary context, thereby placing itself directly in the service of the Gospels.

In the Church where the Croatian language is spoken, this publication promotes Conciliar renewal and the ecumenical spirit. It faithfully transmits the official opinions of the leadership of the Church among the Croats and comments unofficially on current events in the Church, nation and the world, under the inspiration of the Gospels and Church history.

''Glas Koncila'' is open to a broad spectrum of Church-historical opinions, covers important events in the non-Catholic religious communities that live in this region, responds to current questions, covers important cultural events and promotes human and Christian solidarity.

== Independence and openness ==
''Glas Koncila'' has also maintained its independence from the political authorities in democratic Croatia, in which it has increasingly opened discussion on actual topics concerning overall national life, promoting the values of the Gospels as the foundation of a healthy and pluralistic society.

''Glas Koncila'' devotes particular attention to social questions in the light of [[Catholic social doctrine]], expanding its coverage of culture and recognizing culture as a synthesis of the religious and all that is human. Therefore, it serves as the co-organizer for meetings of Catholic artists. By awarding the Golden Oil Lamp, the newspaper promotes ethical and moral values in Croatian film production.

''Glas Koncila'' devotes particular attention to the education of children, issues a monthly children's publication, ''[[Mali Koncil]]'', and organizes Catechism Olympics which involve several thousand catechism students in competitions at the parish, deanery, diocesan and national levels.

Through the publication of the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Code of Canon Law]], the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]], a major biography of the Blessed Archbishop Cardinal [[Alojzije Stepinac]], the Contracts between the Holy See and the Republic of Croatia, and many other works, ''Glas Koncila'' has affirmed itself as a distinguished publisher.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2854">The '''Grand Master of Ceremonies of France''' or '''Grand maître des cérémonies de France''' was one of the Great Officers of the [[Maison du Roi]] ("King's Household") during the [[Ancien Régime]] and [[Bourbon Restoration]].  His function was to organize all public ceremonies of the crown.

The position was created by [[Henri III of France|Henri III]] on January 1 1585, to relieve the [[Grand Master of France]] of part of his workload.  The Grand Master of Ceremonies took his oath of office at the hands of the Grand Master of France.  

The Grand Master of Ceremonies oversaw state ceremonies and not court etiquette or private functions.  He played a role in ceremonies cerebrating or commemorating births, baptisms, marriages, and funerals for members of the royal family, royal feasts, ambassadorial receptions, the [[coronation]], [[royal entry|royal entries]] into towns, [[lit de justice|lits de justice]], meetings of the [[French States-General|States General]] and important assemblies.

The duties of The Grand Master of Ceremonies were principally :
* overseeing logistics of ceremonies (materials, workers, plans, menus);
* carrying messages and convocations from the king to [[Parlement]], the other sovereign courts or notable individuals;
* accompanying the king and the queen, or foreign sovereigns, on their travels, so as to manage the ceremonies during the trip;
* making official records of the ceremonies to serve as [[jurisprudence]] and to aid future ceremonies;

The '''Henryk Batuta hoax''' was a [[hoax]] perpetrated on the [[Polish Wikipedia]] from November 2004 to February 2006, the main element of which was a biographical article about a person who did not exist.

==History==
The perpetrators of the hoax created an article about '''Henryk Batuta''' (born '''Izaak Apfelbaum'''), a fictional socialist revolutionary and Polish [[Communist]]. The fake [[biography]] said Batuta was born in [[Odessa]] in 1898, and participated in the [[Russian Civil War]]&lt;!-- and? --&gt;. The article was created on 8 November 2004 and exposed as a hoax 16 months later when on 1 February 2006, it was listed for deletion.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

The article was ten sentences long while it existed on Polish Wikipedia. It gained some prominence after stories about it appeared in prominent Polish newspapers (''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]'') and magazines (''[[Przekrój]]''), as well as a British one (''[[The Observer]]'').{{cn|date=June 2016}}

The article also falsely claimed a street in [[Warsaw]] was named "Henryk Batuta Street", after the fictional communist official. The anonymous hoaxers who created the article, according to the press calling themselves "The Batuta Army" (pl. "Armia Batuty"), allegedly wanted to draw attention to the fact that there are still places in Poland named after former communist officials who "do not deserve the honour".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/feb/12/wikipedia.web20|title=Bell tolls for Hemingway's fake comrade|author=Tom Parfitt|date=February 11, 2006|accessdate=August 25, 2015|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hoax was exposed when the article was listed for deletion. Even after the article was exposed as a well-organized hoax, its perpetrators tried to convince others of its authenticity by providing false bibliographical information and even by uploading a doctored photograph of a street name "ulica Henryka Batuty" (Henryk Batuta Street). The mystification was "officially" exposed and confirmed on 9 February 2006, when the Polish daily ''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]'' and weekly ''[[Przekrój]]'' published their articles about the hoax.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

In this area of the Służew district there are many street names relating to music and this is one of them.&lt;ref&gt;Article on the Służewiec nad Dolinką District with mention of its musical street names, including the Batuta Str. {{cite web |url=https://smsnd.pl/pliki/pliki/25lecie_smsnd/album_smsnd.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021065235/https://smsnd.pl/pliki/pliki/25lecie_smsnd/album_smsnd.pdf |archivedate=2016-10-21 |df= }}. Retrieved 21 October 2016 ([[Polish language|pol.]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content of the hoax article ==

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Henryk Batuta''', real name Izaak Apfelbaum, (born 1898 in [[Odessa]] – died 1947 near [[Ustrzyki Górne]]) was a Polish communist and an activist in the international workers' movement.

[[File:HenrykBatutaHoaxFakeStreetName.jpg|thumb|right| Ul. Henryka Batuty.]]

A participant of the [[Russian civil war]], he joined the [[Communist Party of Poland]] after returning home. Enforcing party sentences, he organised assassinations of undercover political police informers; the killings were carried out by [[Wacław Komar]], among others. Only in the fifties was this revealed. From 1934 to 1935 he was imprisoned in [[Bereza Kartuska Detention Camp|Bereza Kartuska]], later he emigrated. He participated in the [[Spanish civil war]]. During [[World War II]] he stayed in the [[Soviet Union]]; in 1943 he joined the [[Union of Polish Patriots]]; he became the major of the [[Internal Security Corps]]. He died in 1947 near [[Ustrzyki Górne]] in a clash with the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]].&lt;br /&gt;

His figure is commemorated by a street in [[Warsaw]] ([[Służew nad Dolinką]]). [[History of Poland (1989–present)|After 1989]] many suggested renaming the street, but the name was never changed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19606">In [[economics]], the '''hold-up problem (or commitment problem)''' is central to the theory of incomplete contracts and shows the difficulty in writing complete contracts. A hold-up problem arises when two factors are present:
#Parties to a future [[Rational economic exchange|transaction]] must make noncontractible relationship-specific investments before the transaction takes place. 
#The specific form of the optimal transaction (such as quality-level specifications, time of delivery, what quantity of units) cannot be determined with certainty beforehand.&lt;ref&gt;Rogerson, W.P. (1992). Contractual Solutions to the Hold-Up Problem. ''The Review of Economic Studies, 4''(59), 777-793. {{jstor|2297997}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The hold-up problem is a situation where two parties may be able to work most efficiently by cooperating but refrain from doing so because of concerns that they may give the other party increased bargaining power, and thereby reduce their own profits. When party A has made a prior commitment to a relationship with party B, the latter can 'hold up' the former for the value of that commitment. The hold-up problem leads to severe [[economic cost]] and might also lead to underinvestment.

== Underinvestment ==

It is often argued that the possibility of a hold-up can lead to underinvestment in relation-specific investment and thus [[inefficiency]]. Underinvestment occurs because investors cannot guarantee themselves a sufficient share of the return through ex post bargaining.&lt;ref&gt;Ellingsen, T., &amp; Johannesson, M. (2004). Is There a Hold-Up Problem? ''The Scandinavian Journal of Economics, 3''(106), 475-494. {{jstor|3441120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, predictions of the outcome are very sensitive to assumptions made about the bargaining process. The bargaining process can be seen as a game with multiple equilibria. Underinvestment may occur only when the agent fails to coordinate on an efficient equilibrium.

== Principle ==

In a scenario where two risk-neutral parties S (supplier) and B (Buyer) can make profit by working together, it is efficient to work together as long as the buyers' valuation exceeds the sellers' costs (Schmitz, 2001). When the two parties could agree on a binding contract covering the whole period of the investment and anticipating all possible outcomes and providing protection for both parties in every situation that may arise at the time the investment is made, the parties would have enough confidence to make the investment, and both parties could enjoy high profits. Then, it can be assumed that there are no wealth constraints and there is no private information. According to the [[Coase theorem]], voluntary bargaining results in trade whenever it is efficient.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitz, P.W. (2001). The Hold-Up Problem and Incomplete Contracts: A Survey of Recent Topics in Contract Theory. ''Bulletin of Economic Research, 1''(53), 1-17. Retrieved from http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/12562/2/MPRA_paper_12562.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, making such a contract is not often possible for these four reasons:
*Unforeseeable external factors
*Lack of trust
*Quality problems
*[[Asymmetric information]]

The initial contract can cover only short-term situations; eventually, renegotiation is needed, which provides an opportunity for e.g. S to hold up B. As S knows that the investment is a significant cost to B and tries to use this as leverage to negotiate an increase in its prices. In that case, S has more bargaining power, compared to B, and tries to use it to its own advantage. The source of power lies in the investment of B. For B it is hard to find out whether or not the raise in prices is reasonable. In an extreme case, S could demand 100 percent of the profits if the only alternative to B is to lose the entire initial investment. Even if the outcome would be [[Pareto efficient]], B might not accept the agreement. If the renegotiations turn out to be unsuccessful both parties are worse off: B has made an investment that goes to waste, and S lost a customer.

Inefficiency is caused by the hold-up problem when B is reluctant to make the investment ex ante from the fear that S uses its extra bargaining power to its own advantage. In that case the supplier is 'holding up' the buyer.&lt;ref&gt;Balkenborg, D., Kaplan, T.R., &amp; Miller, T. (2010). A simple economic teaching experiment on the hold-up problem. ''MPRA Paper No. 24772''. Retrieved from http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/24772/1/MPRA_paper_24772.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Auto Industry ===
A historic example concerns the US car industry, but the example is sharply disputed by Coase (2000).&lt;ref&gt;Coase, R.H. (2000). The Acquisition of Fisher Body by General Motors. ''Journal of Law and Economics, 1''(43), 15-32. {{jstor|10.1086/467446}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher Body had an exclusive contract with General Motors (GM) to supply car body parts and so Fisher Body was the only company to deliver the components according to GM's specifications. In 1920, a sharp increase in demand occurred that was above expectations. It is claimed that Fisher Body used the unforeseen situation to hold up GM by increasing the price for the additional parts produced. It has been said that the hold up led to GM acquiring Fisher Body in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, O. (1995). Firms, contracts, and financial structure. Oxford &amp; New York: Oxford University Press, Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Democratization of South Africa ===
During transition out of South African [[apartheid]], many white elites feared that democratization would result in [[tyranny of the majority]]. Now that fair elections were held, many wealthy whites feared that the longtime poor blacks (or their elected representatives) would expropriate wealth from the white minority. For this reason there was white resistance against democratic and fair elections. To ensure a peaceful transition (and to uphold the credibility of the elections), the [[African National Congress]] needed to make a commitment to protect the incomes and wealth of the white elites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=R. P. |last=Inman |first2=D. L. |last2=Rubinfeld |year=2013 |title=Understanding the Democratic Transition in South Africa |journal=American Law and Economics Review |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=1–38 |doi=10.1093/aler/ahs023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This commitment allowed whites to respect the results of a democratic election which would put the majority blacks in power. That credible commitment from the ANC made the new democractic regime sufficiently attractive to whites in South Africa, otherwise they would not have agreed to transition out of autocracy.

== Solutions  ==
=== Contractual  ===
Rogerson (1992) showed the existence of a first-best contractual solution to the hold-up problem in even extremely complex environments involving x agents with arbitrarily complex transaction decisions and utility functions. He shows that three important environmental assumptions must be made:
#No [[externalities]] so that the investment of each agent directly affects only its own type. Therefore, the following situation is not allowed: a situation where a seller's investment has influence on the quality of the product that he sells to the buyer.
#[[Risk neutrality]].
#Only one investor has partially private information so that only one agent makes an investment decision.
Furthermore, the solution also requires 'powerful' contracts to be written.
#Complex contracts can be written.
#Each party commits to participate so all parties are willing to sign the contract at the time of signing.
#The contract prevents from renegotiating the outcomes of the contract so that renegotiation in equilibrium is not possible. 
According to Rogerson (1992) the hold-up problem does not necessarily create inefficiencies; when it does, one of the above requirements is not satisfied. The requirements are necessary to come to an absolutely best solution.&lt;ref&gt;Rogerson, W.P. (1992). Contractual Solutions to the Hold-Up Problem. ''The Review of Economic Studies, 4''(59), 777-793. {{jstor|2297997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If there are direct externalities and renegotiation cannot be prevented, even under symmetric information, underinvestment cannot be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Mirrlees Approach to Mechanism Design with Renegotiation (with Applications to Hold-up and Risk Sharing)|journal = Econometrica|date = 2002|issn = 1468-0262|pages = 1–45|volume = 70|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/1468-0262.t01-1-00268|first = Ilya|last = Segal|first2 = Michael D.|last2 = Whinston}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there are direct externalities, the seller's investment is a hidden action and the buyer has private information about its valuation, the absolutely best solution may not be attained even when the parties have full commitment power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = On the Interplay of Hidden Action and Hidden Information in Simple Bilateral Trading Problems|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022053101927905|journal = Journal of Economic Theory|date = 2002|pages = 444–460|volume = 103|issue = 2|doi = 10.1006/jeth.2001.2790|first = Patrick W.|last = Schmitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Subgame-Perfect Implementation Under Information Perturbations*|url = http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/127/4/1843|journal = The Quarterly Journal of Economics|issn = 0033-5533|pages = 1843|volume = 127|issue = 4|doi = 10.1093/qje/qjs026|first = Philippe|last = Aghion|first2 = Drew|last2 = Fudenberg|first3 = Richard|last3 = Holden|first4 = Takashi|last4 = Kunimoto|first5 = Olivier|last5 = Tercieux|year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of direct externalities, simple contracts may solve the hold-up problem even when each party has private information about its valuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Simple contracts, renegotiation under asymmetric information, and the hold-up problem|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014292101000885|journal = European Economic Review|date = 2002|pages = 169–188|volume = 46|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/S0014-2921(01)00088-5|first = Patrick W.|last = Schmitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Maskin|Maskin]] and [[Jean Tirole|Tirole]] (1999) argue that complex contracts can solve the hold-up problem when there are ex ante indescribable contingencies, and [[Oliver Hart (economist)|Hart]] and [[John Hardman Moore|Moore]] (1999) argue that the solution does not work when renegotiation cannot be ruled out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Unforeseen Contingencies and Incomplete Contracts|url = http://restud.oxfordjournals.org/content/66/1/83|journal = The Review of Economic Studies|date = 1999|issn = 0034-6527|pages = 83–114|volume = 66|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/1467-937X.00079|first = Eric|last = Maskin|first2 = Jean|last2 = Tirole}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Foundations of Incomplete Contracts|url = http://restud.oxfordjournals.org/content/66/1/115|journal = The Review of Economic Studies|date = 1999|issn = 0034-6527|pages = 115–138|volume = 66|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/1467-937X.00080|first = Oliver|last = Hart|first2 = John|last2 = Moore}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taken together, whether or not suitable contracts can solve the hold-up problem is disputed in contract theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Incomplete Contracts: Where do We Stand?|journal = Econometrica|date = 1999|issn = 1468-0262|pages = 741–781|volume = 67|issue = 4|doi = 10.1111/1468-0262.00052|first = Jean|last = Tirole}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an experimental study, Hoppe and Schmitz (2011) found that option contracts may alleviate the hold-up problem even when renegotiation is possible, which may be explained by Hart and Moore's (2008) idea that contracts may serve as reference points.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Can contracts solve the hold-up problem?

=== Option contracts and renegotiation  ===
{{main|option contract}}
Research of [[Georg Nöldeke|Nöldeke]] and [[Klaus M. Schmidt|Schmidt]] (1995) argued that the underinvestment problem due to the hold-up problem is eliminated if parties are able to write a simple [[option contract]]. Such a contract gives the seller the right but not the obligation to deliver a fixed quantity of the good and also makes the contractual payment of the buyer dependent on the delivery decision of the seller. Thus, this contract does not depend on renegotiation or complicated mechanisms, but its crucial feature is that one of the parties can unilaterally decide whether the trade takes place. However, such a contract is unachievable unless it is possible to enforce the payments conditional on the delivery decision of the seller. That means that the court must be able to verify delivery of the good to the buyer by the seller.&lt;ref&gt;Nöldeke, G., &amp; Schmidt, K. (1995). Option Contracts and Renegotiation: A Solution to the Hold-up Problem. ''The RAND Journal of Economics, 2''(26), 163-179. {{jstor|2555911}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The possibility was ruled out in earlier research where it was assumed that when trade fails, it is not possible for the court to distinguish whether the buyer did not accept the delivery or the seller refused to supply.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, O., &amp; Moore, J. (1988). Incomplete Contracts and Renegotiation. ''Econometrica, 4''(56), 755-785. {{jstor|1912698}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vertical integration ===
{{main|Vertical integration}}
The organization and governance structure of a firm might be seen as a mechanism for dealing with a hold-up problem. A solution to the hold-up problem is [[vertical integration]] such as a [[merger]] in which all parts of the body being produced internally rather than outside.&lt;ref&gt;Holmström, B., &amp; Roberts, J. (1998). The Boundaries of the Firm Revisited. ''The Journal of Economic Perspectives, 4''(12), 73-94. {{jstor|2646895}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vertical integration shifts the ownership of the organizational asset of the firm and therewith creates more flexibility and avoids potential of a hold-up. In that way, the (transaction) costs associated with contractually induced hold-ups are saved and also the costs associated with the number of contracts written and executed. Hold-up problems are created from the existence of firm-specific investments.but also from the set of long-term contracts that are used in the presence of the certain investments. Whether a vertical integration is adopted as a solution to the hold-up problem depends on the magnitude of the specific investment and the ability to write long-term contracts, flexible enough to avoid a potential hold-up. However, the ability to write flexible long-term contracts strongly depends upon the underlying market uncertainty and the reputation of the company. Therefore, those factors will also influence the likelihood of vertical integration.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, B. (1998). Vertical Integration as Organizational Ownership: The Fisher Body-General Motors Relationship Revisited. ''Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization, 1''(4), 199-213. Retrieved from http://www.heinonline.org/HOL/Page?page=199&amp;handle=hein.journals%2Fjleo4&amp;collection=journals#207&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which vertical integration can alleviate the hold-up problem also depends on the information structure. While traditional incomplete contracting models of vertical integration such as [[Sanford J. Grossman|Grossman]] and [[Oliver Hart (economist)|Hart]] (1986) assume symmetric information, Schmitz (2006) has extended the incomplete contracting framework to allow for asymmetric information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Costs and Benefits of Ownership: A Theory of Vertical and Lateral Integration|journal = Journal of Political Economy|volume = 94|issue = 4|pages = 691|doi = 10.1086/261404|first = Sanford J.|last = Grossman|first2 = Oliver D.|last2 = Hart|date = 1986|url = https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3450060/Hart_CostsBenefits.pdf?sequence=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Information Gathering, Transaction Costs, and the Property Rights Approach|journal = American Economic Review|date = 2006|issn = 0002-8282|pages = 422–434|volume = 96|issue = 1|doi = 10.1257/000282806776157722|first = Patrick W|last = Schmitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hunchun incident''' (October 2, 1920) was a reported raid on a [[Japan]]ese consulate in Manchuria resulting in the death of thirteen Japanese.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The Japanese government used this incident to justify sending thousands of Imperial Japanese troops into [[Manchuria]] on October 5, 1920. These escalations culminated with the [[Battle of Qingshanli]] (October 21–26, 1920) between [[Japan]] and the Korean Independence Army,{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}  where [[Koreans|Korean]] rebels fought Japanese soldiers.

==Background==

For more than a decade prior to Korea’s [[March 1st Movement]] (1919) nationalist groups of Korean rebels, many of whom were former soldiers in the Korean army, organized into various pro-independence factions in Manchuria.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}  Due to its strategic location across the Korean border, guerilla fighters could effectively launch raids on Japanese consular police stations, and then retreat back to the Chinese side of the boundary.&lt;ref&gt;Erik W. Esselstrom, 2005, Rethinking the Colonial Conquest of Manchuria: The Japanese Consular Police in Jiandao, Modern Asian Studies 39, (February) vol. 1: 44.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, Hong Pomdo (a previous [[Righteous Army]] leader) created the Korean Independence Army and trained so-called independence fighters in [[Yanji]]. Additionally, the Northern Route Military Headquarters was established under the leadership of So Il, with Kim Chwajin commanding more than four hundred independence fighters at its officer training school. Separately, Yi Tonghwi also trained over 3,000 independence fighters in Hunchun and armed them with weapons provided by the Red [[Bolshevik]] army.&lt;ref&gt;Kang Man-gil, 1994, A History of Contemporary Korea (United Kingdom: Global Oriental) p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to the March 1st Movement’s failure to secure independence and arouse international sentiments toward the Koreans’ plight under Japanese colonial rule, disaffected Koreans came together on April 13, 1919 in Shanghai to form a republican Korean provisional government with the hope of working together with the independence factions in Manchuria to eventually obtain freedom from Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Michael E. Robinson, 2007, Korea’s Twentieth-Century Odyssey: A Short History (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

As the momentum behind Korean independence movements in Manchuria increased, Japanese consular police chief Suematsu Kichiji became increasingly concerned about increasing radical Bolshevism among Koreans. To try and suppress these movements, he ordered numerous illegal police raids on suspected radical Jiandao base camps, which were protested by local Chinese leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Erik W. Esselstrom, 2005, Rethinking the Colonial Conquest of Manchuria: The Japanese Consular Police in Jiandao, Modern Asian Studies 39, (February) vol. 1: 45.&lt;/ref&gt;  While it is clear that some of the Korean guerrilla fighters in Manchuria were influenced by leftist ideologies, the major factions primarily supported the [[Shanghai Provisional Government]] and were focused primarily on Korean independence and self-determination.&lt;ref&gt;Kang Man-gil, 1994, A History of Contemporary Korea (United Kingdom: Global Oriental) p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Angered by the Japanese suppression of the March 1st Movement, Korean independence fighters in Manchuria began increasing their raids against Japanese border posts, killing numerous Japanese guards, with the eventual goal of advancing into Korea to remove the Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;Kang Man-gil, 1994, A History of Contemporary Korea (United Kingdom: Global Oriental) p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the early summer months of 1920, Korean rebels fought with Japanese troops in thirty-two battles along the border. After one particular Japanese counterattack, Hong Pomdo’s forces surrounded and killed 120 Japanese soldiers and wounded more than 200.&lt;ref&gt;Kang Man-gil, 1994, A History of Contemporary Korea (United Kingdom: Global Oriental) p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attack and Controversy==

In effort to contain the Korean rebels, Japan petitioned both [[Tokyo]] and the Chinese government to help, but received little assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Erik W. Esselstrom, 2005, Rethinking the Colonial Conquest of Manchuria: The Japanese Consular Police in Jiandao, Modern Asian Studies 39, (February) vol. 1: 45.&lt;/ref&gt;   Subsequently, on October 2, 1920, a Japanese consulate in the Chinese city of [[Hunchun]] in [[Jilin]] Province was attacked and burned to the ground purportedly (according to Japanese sources) by the Korean Independence Army, killing thirteen Japanese people.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |title=Text of Bryce EUlogies and Statement on Siberia |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/01/24/98975084.pdf |accessdate=June 13, 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=January 24, 1922}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was further reported that the “bandits” carrying out this attack “committed indiscriminate acts of murder and pillage” and “looted local shops.”&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erik W. Esselstrom, 2005, Rethinking the Colonial Conquest of Manchuria: The Japanese Consular Police in Jiandao, Modern Asian Studies 39, (February) vol. 1: 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many South Korean historians maintain, however, that the attack on Hunchun was not carried out by the Korean rebels, but rather was staged by the Japanese to justify incursion into Manchuria.&lt;ref&gt;Erik W. Esselstrom, 2005, Rethinking the Colonial Conquest of Manchuria: The Japanese Consular Police in Jiandao, Modern Asian Studies 39, (February) vol. 1: 47.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some South Korean sources further believe that the attack was coordinated with Chinese bandit leader Ch'ang-chiang-hao who had been bribed by the Japanese to carry out the attack with several bandits in order to incriminate the Koreans. These sources maintain that Chang went further than the Japanese had requested him to in the scale of his attack.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}  Other South Korean scholars even maintain that the entire incident was a complete Japanese fabrication.&lt;ref&gt;Kang Man-gil, 1994, A History of Contemporary Korea (United Kingdom: Global Oriental) p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[North Korea]] is likewise skeptical about the Japanese narrative of the incident, with official sources recently asserting that “the Japanese imperialists cooked up the ‘Hunchun incident’ in which they hurled mounted bandits into attacking their consulate and kicked up a wholesale whirlwind of suppression against Koreans in Northeast China under that pretext.”&lt;ref&gt;"North Korea Criticizes Japan's ‘Punitive Operations’ in 1920." BBC Monitoring Asia Pacific, Oct 02, 2009, http://search.proquest.com/docview/460755521&lt;/ref&gt;

Though it is difficult for historians to determine who was behind the attack, or whether the incident actually took place, this controversial event is historically significant because Japan used it to justify its escalated military intervention in Manchuria.&lt;ref&gt;Erik W. Esselstrom, 2005, Rethinking the Colonial Conquest of Manchuria: The Japanese Consular Police in Jiandao, Modern Asian Studies 39, (February) vol. 1: 47.&lt;/ref&gt;  Japan petitioned and received permission from China to send 15,000 troops from the 19th Division of the [[Chosen Army]] of Japan to contain the Korean rebel armies in Jilin province.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Aftermath==

In reaction to the Hunchun incident, a Japanese punitive “Jiandao Expedition” was accordingly sent to Manchuria, and used “search and destroy” patrols to suppress the guerrilla fighters by carrying out numerous arrests and executions.&lt;ref&gt;Erik W. Esselstrom, 2005, Rethinking the Colonial Conquest of Manchuria: The Japanese Consular Police in Jiandao, Modern Asian Studies 39, (February) vol. 1: 47.&lt;/ref&gt;  By December 1920, a Korean Commission report described that Japanese soldiers had burned down thirty-two villages and killed “all the male inhabitants of the [Hunchun] district, and massacred 145 peaceful inhabitants.” One house was reportedly burned down with “women and children inside.”&lt;ref&gt;“Koreans Charge Cruelty,” New York Times, December 24, 1920, https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1920/12/24/103519339.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Korean independence forces in Manchuria were never effectively organized under the leadership of the Shanghai Provisional Government, they did achieve notable military victories against the Japanese brigades.&lt;ref&gt;Kang Man-gil, 1994, A History of Contemporary Korea (United Kingdom: Global Oriental) pp. 33-34.&lt;/ref&gt;  The most significant of these was the [[Battle of Qingshanli]], where about 400 Korean rebels were able to defeat the better-trained Japanese after four days of intense combat.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asianinfo.org/asianinfo/korea/history/independence_army.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  In this battle the Koreans killed about 1,200 Japanese soldiers while losing only 60 of their own.&lt;ref&gt;Kang Man-gil, 1994, A History of Contemporary Korea (United Kingdom: Global Oriental) p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, according to Japanese records, 11 soldiers were [[killed in action]], 24 wounded.&lt;ref&gt;陸軍第十九師團司令部　「間島事件鮮支人死傷者調」　大正十年二月二十五日&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1921, after a series of skirmishes and retreats on both sides, as well as criticism from local Chinese authorities and the international community, most members of the 19th Division withdrew from eastern Manchuria.&lt;ref&gt;Erik W. Esselstrom, 2005, Rethinking the Colonial Conquest of Manchuria: The Japanese Consular Police in Jiandao, Modern Asian Studies 39, (February) vol. 1: 48.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the socialist-leaning Korean rebels were then recruited by the Red Bolshevik army to assist in its civil war prior to the formation of the [[Soviet Union]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39657">[[File:UNCAC 1.png|thumb|Chapter V of the United Nations Convention against Corruption (2003) makes clear that Asset Recovery is an international priority in the fight against corruption]]

'''International asset recovery''' is any effort by governments to repatriate the proceeds of corruption hidden in foreign jurisdictions. Such assets may include monies in bank accounts, real estate, vehicles, arts and artifacts, and precious metals. As defined under the [[United Nations Convention against Corruption]], asset recovery refers to recovering the proceeds of corruption, rather than broader terms such as [[confiscation|asset confiscation]] or [[asset forfeiture]] which refer to recovering the proceeds or instrumentalities of crime in general.

Often used to emphasize the "multi-jurisdictional" or cross-border aspects of a corruption investigation, international asset recovery includes numerous processes such as the tracing, freezing, confiscation, and repatriation of proceeds stored in foreign jurisdictions, thus "making it one of the most complex projects in the field of law".&lt;ref name="u4"&gt;{{cite|author= Smith, Jack; Pieth, Mark; Jorge, Guillermo|title=The Recovery of Stolen Assets: A Fundamental Principle of the UN Convention against Corruption|work=U4Brief|publisher=Chr. Michelsen Institute (CMI) – U4|date=February 2007|issue=2|url=http://www.repatriationgroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/U4-Brief.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even considering the difficulties present, Africa specialist Daniel Scher counters that international asset recovery's "potential rewards in developing countries make it a highly attractive undertaking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scher|first1=Daniel|title=Asset Recovery|journal=African Security Review|date=January 2005|volume=14|issue=4|pages=17–26|doi=10.1080/10246029.2005.9627584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite domestic legislation in some countries allowing for the confiscation and forfeiture of proceeds of corruption, it is improvements in finance, transportation, and communications technologies in the 20th century that have made it easier for corrupt leaders and other "[[politically exposed person]]s" to conceal massive amounts of stolen wealth in [[offshore financial centers]].

By taking advantage of differences in legal systems, the high costs in coordinating investigations, lack of international cooperation, and [[bank secrecy]] in some recipient countries, corrupt officials have been able to preserve much of their loot overseas.

== Social impact ==
Recovering stolen assets is important for a variety of reasons. According to the [[World Bank]], the cross-border flow of proceeds from criminal activity, corruption and tax evasion is estimated between US$1–1.6 trillion per year—half of this amount is looted from developing and transition economies.&lt;ref name="worldbankquote"&gt;[http://www.assetrecovery.org/kc/node/be3d0de7-cd8c-11dc-b471-db7db47931e5.58 Stolen Assets Recovery Initiative: Challenges, Opportunities, and Action Plan, additional text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923175435/http://www.assetrecovery.org/kc/node/be3d0de7-cd8c-11dc-b471-db7db47931e5.58 |date=2015-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; US $20–40 billion of this flow originated in bribes to public officials from developing and transition countries. A 2005 report by the Commission for Africa cites a European Commission estimate that "stolen African assets equivalent to more than half of the continent's external debt are held in foreign banks accounts".&lt;ref name="halfafrica"&gt;[http://www.commissionforafrica.org/english/report/thereport/english/11-03-05_cr_report.pdf - Report of the Commission for Africa Report- Our Common Interest], p.152&lt;/ref&gt; As stated by the World Bank in 2004, "corruption is... the single greatest obstacle to economic and social development. Corruption undermines development by distorting the rule of law and weakening the institutional foundation on which economic growth depends. The harmful effects of corruption are especially severe on the world's poorest, who are most reliant on the provision of public services, and are least capable of paying the extra costs associated with fraud and corruption".&lt;ref name=worldbankcit&gt;[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTPUBLICSECTORANDGOVERNANCE/EXTANTICORRUPTION/0,,menuPK:384461~pagePK:149018~piPK:149093~theSitePK:384455,00.html 'World Bank Topic: Anticorruption']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deterrence to future corruption ==

Several countries, especially economically deprived nations, have endured the brunt of [[systemic corruption]] as their public wealth illegally flowed into bank accounts and properties in developed countries and [[offshore financial centre]]s. Successful conviction of criminals and/or confiscation of their assets creates a strong deterrent for potential corrupt officials that there is no safe haven for hiding illicit wealth.

== Current feasibility ==

Successes in recent years in recovering billions of dollars of stolen assets has demonstrated that asset recovery is feasible. For example, by 2005 [[Nigeria]] had recovered $1.2 billion stolen by former President [[Sani Abacha]] by requesting assistance from multiple jurisdictions including Switzerland, Jersey, and Liechtenstein. To recover Nigerian assets, the Swiss government designated the Abacha family a "criminal organization", allowing it to bypass the need for a conviction.&lt;ref name=radha&gt;[http://www.freedomfromfearmagazine.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=98:criminal-assets&amp;catid=37:issue-1&amp;Itemid=159 Radha Ivory, ''Criminal Assets: A Little Lateral Thinking'' in Freedom from Fear Magazine, October 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, asset recovery was recognized as "a fundamental principle" of the [[United Nations Convention against Corruption|UNCAC]]. The signing and ratification of the [[UNCAC]] by over 160 countries is seen as a major step in furthering cooperation between countries to join forces to fight corruption and assist each other in recovering looted assets. Legal precedents, increasing international cooperation, as well as enhanced capacities make asset recovery more possible now than ever.

[[Image:Icar1.jpg|thumb|Each of the necessary steps—tracing, freezing, confiscation and repatriation—presents its own unique challenges.]]

== The asset recovery process ==

Managing the stages of an asset recovery investigation can be extremely time consuming, complex and requires a great deal of resources, expertise, and political will. First, a victim country must succeed in tracing the stolen assets. Second, the victim country must request cooperation from authorities in the jurisdictions where the assets reside to seize the assets; these requests usually come in the form of a [[Mutual Legal Assistance]] request or a [[letter rogatory]], though some common law countries allow the filing of a [[Mareva injunction]] in civil courts to achieve the same end. Third, legal processes must usually be initiated in the requested country in order to confiscate the assets. Following this, requested authorities must repatriate the assets back to the requesting country.

Each of the necessary steps—tracing, freezing, confiscation and repatriation—presents its own unique challenges.&lt;ref name=fourphases&gt;[http://www.assetrecovery.org/kc/node/322c8609-8bd0-11dd-b0b1-bd28a6282634.134 'Recovering Stolen Assets' Edited by Mark Pieth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923175431/http://www.assetrecovery.org/kc/node/322c8609-8bd0-11dd-b0b1-bd28a6282634.134 |date=2015-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tracing ===

Determining the existence of assets through an exhaustive financial investigation is the first requirement in any asset recovery case. Assets must be followed not only to their final hiding place, but causality must be established between the asset and the criminal activity. This poses a particular challenge when dealing with developing countries that have a cash-based society where monies often do not flow through the recorded financial system, other techniques must be used.

When assets do go through the financial system, tracing from one account to the next will usually leave an audit trail that can be exploited by financial investigators. As stolen assets are often layered through several different accounts and corporate vehicles, investigators will often benefit from outside information such as seized financial documents and suspicious transaction reports filed with banking regulators and other law enforcement agencies. Given the speed that monies can be transferred in the global financial system, identifying and tracing the bank accounts of the perpetrators is not an easy task, even for a seasoned investigator. A high degree of expertise, resources and cooperation between multiple intelligence and law enforcement agencies is essential for successful tracing.

Though not often, occasionally investigators may come across documentation that leads directly to the stolen assets. For example, investigations seeking to trace Ferdinand Marcos' looted billions were greatly accelerated by finding Marcos' bank records in the former presidential palace.&lt;ref name=malacanang&gt;[http://www.assetrecovery.org/kc/node/5c8d49bf-a340-11dc-bf1b-335d0754ba85.46 Mutual Legal Assistance, Extradition and Recovery of Proceeds of Corruption in Asia and the Pacific] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923175434/http://www.assetrecovery.org/kc/node/5c8d49bf-a340-11dc-bf1b-335d0754ba85.46 |date=2015-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[suspicious activity report]]s filed with national financial intelligence units can often uncover connections that can expose cases of grand corruption.

To obtain non-public information in foreign jurisdictions requires the submission of either a "Mutual Legal Assistance" (MLA) request, obtain a disclosure action through a tort claim, or submit a traditional [[letter rogatory]] through diplomatic channels. These requests are more likely to be successful when all countries involved have treaties in place, either bilateral or multilateral, to allow for legal cooperation. Notably, the UNCAC purports to provide a legal basis for international cooperation for asset recovery.

=== Freezing ===

Once financial investigations have identified assets as being possible proceeds of crime/corruption, freezing those assets becomes critical. However, premature freezing prevents investigators from following the money trail in real time. If alerted, the beneficiaries of targeted assets will most likely try to transfer the assets to make them unreachable. If delayed, there is a risk that the assets may be transferred beyond the investigator's reach. Confidentiality is key at this point. To prevent suspects from moving assets yet to be discovered, courts can place a [[gag order]] to prevent banks or officials from informing their clients until a transfer request is made. Recently some banks have also begun proactively cooperating with their national financial intelligence units by requesting consent on suspicious transfers.

In March 2006, a Guernsey branch of Banque Nationale de Paris Paribas refused to transfer funds beneficially controlled by Tommy Suharto and instead froze the funds based on guidance from Guernsey's Financial Services Commission.

=== Confiscation/forfeiture ===

Whether by criminal or civil actions, a judgment is essential to transfer legal ownership of assets already frozen back to the requesting country. See Legal Avenues to Obtaining Judgment below.

=== Repatriation/monitoring ===
There is no standard procedure for the restitution of illicitly acquired assets, as no two cases are exactly alike. Certain cases involving asset recovery have seen difficulties emerge during the repatriation stage.
While stolen money is unquestionably the sovereign property of the requesting government, enforcing asset recovery requests is often complex and costly. Often there are complex issues around the claims of legitimate third parties, as corrupt proceeds can be mixed with legitimate income.

Additionally, requested countries and the international community as a whole do not want to see repatriated assets embezzled all over again. Although determining the disposal of assets is handled on a case-by-case basis, the World Bank has acted as a neutral third party to ensure that assets are invested into development efforts such as health and education.

== Legal mechanisms to obtaining judgment ==

Determining the tactic by which an asset recovery practitioner can obtain court judgments to freeze, seize, and repatriate assets is also of critical importance. Generally, there are four approaches which can be taken to recover stolen assets.

=== Criminal confiscation ([[in personam]]) ===

Courts have the authority to confiscate assets that have been identified as the proceeds or instrumentalities of crime. In the context of international asset recovery, using criminal convictions to recover stolen assets is usually only possible when a legal basis exists between states, such as a bi-lateral or multilateral agreement. If no other arrangement is in place, [[UNCAC]] signatories may use the Convention itself as a legal basis for enforcing confiscation orders obtained in a foreign criminal court. Specifically, Article 54 Section 1A of the UNCAC provides that:

"''Each State Party (will)... take such measures as may be necessary to permit its competent authorities to give effect to an order of confiscation issued by a court of another state party.''"&lt;ref name="uncaclegalbasis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org|title=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|first=|last=agt|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, UNCAC Section 54 2A also provides for the provisional freezing or seizing of property where there are sufficient grounds for taking such actions in advance of a formal request being received. Generally, [[dual criminality]] must also exist between the jurisdictions, whereby the predicate offense must be recognized as a crime by both the requested and requesting state.

Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) is vital to this process, although there remain countries that are reluctant to enforce a court order from another jurisdiction without some form of pre-existing treaty. However, MLA requests can generate vital information in the early stages of an investigation in tracing, identifying, and temporarily freezing the accounts linked to corruption.

To be truly effective, international asset recoveries through MLA require strong inter-state cooperation as well as two critical elements—a criminal conviction either in the requesting state or the recipient state, and an enforceable confiscation order.

However, satisfying conditions for international asset recovery using criminal convictions remains problematic. Criminal proceedings usually require that the accused is present before the court, where many wrongdoers may be dead or have fled the country to avoid arrest or prosecution. MLA requests must be detailed and precisely written in the language of the requested state. Additionally, influential and powerful defendants can use their influence to suppress investigations, manipulate witnesses or judges, or hire law firms to create endless adjournments and appeals.

=== Civil proceedings (in personam) ===

States have another option to recover stolen assets—civil proceedings. In relation to foreign assets, a State will bring a private action in the civil courts of the foreign jurisdiction where corruptly acquired assets are located. This is the same process that would be used by private citizens or corporate entities with a claim against another, in the context of fraud for example, by a liquidator seeking to recover assets wrongfully diverted from an insolvent company.

This mechanism has been particularly successful in international cases involving public officials where a criminal conviction of corruption is difficult or impossible to obtain. Among the benefits of civil proceedings include a lower burden of proof ("clear and convincing/balance of probabilities" instead of "beyond a reasonable doubt") and the absence of a defendant not preventing progress in the proceedings. Instead, the court is satisfied so long as the defendant has been properly served notice of the proceedings. In the United Kingdom, the High Court held that serving notice to a lawyer acting on behalf of a defendant has also been used when the individual is in hiding.&lt;ref name="dariyefootnote"&gt;[https://archive.is/20130414065941/http://www.assetrecovery.org/kc/node/4710f64d-c5fb-11dd-b3f1-fd61180437d9.3 Edmond Angell Palmer Dodge's Case Study of Civil Proceedings against former Nigerian governor Joshua Dariye in the United Kingdom]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, civil courts retain some of the benefits of a criminal action, for example the ability to freeze assets to prevent dispersal, pierce bank secrecy, issue gag orders to third parties to maintain the confidentiality of the investigation, and even order search/seizure actions. Many practitioners have found that effective programs to recover corruptly acquired assets often use a coordinated package of criminal and civil measures to secure and recover assets. Furthermore, where criminal mechanisms can go some way to freeze but not recover assets, civil proceedings may effectively intervene.

=== Civil procedures against property ([[in rem]]) ===

A third tactic is the use of [[in rem]] actions, also known as Non-Conviction Based Asset Forfeiture (NCBF) to recover assets directly. This method takes place in a civil court. An advantage of [[in rem]] actions is that it does not require either a civil or criminal conviction against an individual in order to confiscate his/her assets. Instead, guilt is assigned to the property and prosecutors must only prove that the property in question was involved in an illegal activity. Hence, a possible case name for [[in rem]] action could be 'United States of America vs. US $100,000 in a Toyota Pickup.' The owner or beneficiary of targeted property must then prove that either that the property was not involved or that he/she provide an innocent owner defense.

[[In rem]] asset recovery has been controversial and the fairness of the procedures has been questioned. Prior to 2000 in the United States, for example, the burden of proof was on the property owner to prove that his property was not derived from, or used to commit, a criminal offense, and there was no remedy for "innocent owners" who were without fault concerning the illegal use of their property. Remedial legislation enacted in 2000, however, addressed these concerns and Non-Conviction Based Asset Forfeiture has become a standard part of law enforcement in the U.S., yielding US$1.5b annually in asset recoveries. While encouraged in UNCAC, adapting domestic law to create a legal basis for in rem recoveries is not required of state parties. Examples of in rem legislation can be found in jurisdictions such as the United States, the United Kingdom, the Philippines, Australia, Colombia and [[Proceeds of Crime Act 1996|Ireland]].

=== ''Accion civil resarcitoria'' (civil action) ===

In civil law jurisdictions, there is a fourth mechanism which is a hybrid between conviction-based and in rem actions. An 'accion civil resarcitoria' is meant to redress victims of criminal offenses and to expedite the process it takes place within the criminal court. Such actions depend on the criminal proceedings in that it cannot be initiated unless there is a concurrent criminal investigation underway. Once the criminal proceedings make it to trial, the accion civil resarcitoria separates in that forfeiture of property is not dependent on a criminal conviction of an individual. Unlike a criminal confiscation or in rem action, a successful 'accion civil resarcitoria' recognizes damages and awards a monetary compensation.

For example, in [[Switzerland]], where foreign States seeking the return of corruptly acquired assets are often permitted to be a civil party to Swiss criminal investigations or proceedings concerning those assets. Such investigations or proceedings may be commenced by an investigating magistrate on receipt of a request for [[mutual legal assistance]]. The foreign State will have the ability to access documents on the Court file, to participate in the examination of witnesses, to make submissions to the investigating magistrate, and to seek the repatriation of the assets. This procedure produces an efficient and often effective combination of civil and criminal proceedings.

== International frameworks for asset recovery ==

'''[[United Nations Convention against Corruption]] (2005)'''

Responding to increasing recognition of the problems caused by public corruption and its devastating effects on the poorest of nations, the international community took a bold step in 2003 by creating and ratifying the [[United Nations Convention Against Corruption]] (UNCAC).&lt;ref name="uncactext"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/CAC/index.html|title=Convention against Corruption|first=|last=natasha.kamberska|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[UNCAC]] came into force on December 14, 2005 and so far has been ratified by over 130 parties. While the [[UNCAC]] is not the first international effort to combat corruption, it is innovative in two respects: it is the first treaty to reference the recovery of stolen assets as a priority in the fight against corruption. Second, the treaty also provides a nearly universal multi-lateral platform for mutual legal assistance in corruption related offenses.

'''[[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention|OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions]] (1999)'''
- A convention signed by 37 countries, this OECD convention requires that bribery of foreign public officials in the context of international business transactions be criminalized. The framework of the Convention is housed in the OECD Secretariat, but country-level compliance is ensured through a rigorous peer-evaluation mechanism which monitors both the legislative framework and implementation in signatory countries under the auspices of the OECD Working Group on Bribery.

More specifically, the OECD Convention requires that bribery of foreign public officials be punishable, by effective, proportionate and dissuasive criminal penalties comparable to those applicable to their own public officials. It commits Parties to interpret territorial jurisdiction in as broad a manner as possible and to establish nationality jurisdiction if this is in accord with their legal system. Parties are obliged to establish corporate liability (the liability of "legal persons") for foreign bribery, and where a Party's legal system does not provide criminal liability for companies, the Party must apply effective, proportionate and dissuasive non-criminal sanctions to them. Furthermore, countries must facilitate mutual legal assistance and cannot invoke "bank secrecy" to deny mutual legal assistance.&lt;ref name="oecdconvention"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/document/18/0,3343,en_2649_34859_35430226_1_1_1_1,00.html#why_convention_important|title=Fighting Bribery and Corruption: Frequently asked questions - OECD|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the OECD Convention is important in the sense that it creates the obligation for state parties to criminalize the bribery of foreign public officials, it does not directly consider the recovery of proceeds of corruption.

'''[[Convention against Transnational Organized Crime|United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime]] (2003)'''
The United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized came into force on September 29, 2003 and has been ratified by over 145 countries. The purpose of this Convention is to promote cooperation to prevent and combat transnational organized crime more effectively. It is the main international instrument in the fight against transnational organized crime.&lt;ref name="UNTOCtext"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/CTOC/index.html|title=Convention on Transnational Organized Crime|first=|last=ivan.restrepo|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially relevant to asset recovery is Article 6 of the Convention, which requires state parties to criminalize the laundering the proceeds of crime, and Article 12, which requires parties to create a legal basis for the confiscation of proceeds of crime.

'''[[Inter-American Convention Against Corruption]] (1997)'''

The Inter-American Convention Against Corruption (IACAC) was adopted by the member countries of the Organization of American States on 29 March 1996; it came into force on 6 March 1997. The IACAC is distinctive in that it was the first international convention to address the problem of corruption.

Currently, the IACAC is ratified by 33 countries.&lt;ref name="IACACsig"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/juridico/english/Sigs/b-58.html|title=:: Multilateral Treaties &gt; Department of International Law  &gt; OAS ::|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iacac"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/juridico/English/treaties/b-58.html|title=:: Multilateral Treaties &gt; Department of International Law  &gt; OAS ::|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption and Related Offences (2003)&lt;ref name="AUC2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africa-union.org/Official_documents/Treaties_%20Conventions_%20Protocols/Convention%20on%20Combating%20Corruption.pdf|title=African Union Convention text|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spirit of complementing UNCAC, 35 African Heads of State and Government met in Maputo, Mozambique in July 2003. According to Honorable. Dauda Kamara, Member of the Pan-African Parliament, a specific regional convention was "considered necessary because Africa, given its currently low-level economic development, needed to adopt specific and well defined measures that will protect its vast resources from any further exploitation by more powerful and developed nations of the world through corrupt practices". The Convention was entered into force on August 5, 2006 after the required minimum of 15 signatories was met. To date, 43 countries have signed the Convention and 29 states have ratified it.&lt;ref name="apaucc"&gt;[http://www.apnacafrica.org/docs/Sierraleoneworkshop_PRESENTATION%209%20HON.%20DAUDA%20KAMARA.doc The United Nations Convention against Corruption and the African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption and Other Related Offences- An Overview and Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904051402/http://www.apnacafrica.org/docs/Sierraleoneworkshop_PRESENTATION%209%20HON.%20DAUDA%20KAMARA.doc |date=2011-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AUCACupdate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/Documents/Treaties/List/African%20Convention%20on%20Combating%20Corruption.pdf |title=The African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption: List of Countries which have Signed, Ratified/Acceded |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221085010/http://www.africa-union.org/root/AU/Documents/Treaties/List/African%20Convention%20on%20Combating%20Corruption.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International asset recovery initiatives ==

There are several organizations that have prioritized asset recovery and created initiatives to enable further international cooperation while bringing the issue to the forefront of political and public discussion. These initiatives also include providing technical assistance, research and capacity development to developing countries.

These organizations include but are not limited to:

*[[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC)
*[[Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative]] of the [[World Bank]] (StAR)
*[[International Centre for Asset Recovery]] (ICAR)
*[[The International Association for Asset Recovery]] (IAAR)
*[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD)
*[[Transparency International]] (TI)
*[[Financial Action Task Force]] (FATF)
*[[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE)
*[[U4 Anti-Corruption Resource Center]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u4.no/|title=U4 Anti-Corruption Resource Centre » U4|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (U4)
*[[UNCAC Conference of States Parties]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/CAC/CAC-COSP.html|title=Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption|first=|last=natasha.kamberska|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (UNCAC COSP)

Additionally, several regional networks exist to facilitate judicial cooperation between national authorities by enabling direct personal contact and sharing information. These networks include, but are not limited to:
*[[Asset Recovery Interagency Network Asia Pacific]] (ARIN-AP)
*[[Camden Assets Recovery Interagency Network]] (CARIN)
*Commonwealth Network of Contact Persons
*Corruption Hunters Network
*European Judicial Network
*Hemispheric Information Exchange Network for Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters and Extradition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/juridico/mla/en/index.html|title=Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Organization of American States]]
*Ibero-American Legal Assistance Network

== Capacity development and training ==

Asset recovery can be a highly complex field of work, requiring expertise, funds, coordinated action and persistence. [COSP Note on AR] Training and technical assistance are sometimes needed to pursue asset recovery cases, particularly in those countries lacking institutional framework and experience.

Several international and inter-governmental organizations with assistance from development agencies and donor countries have begun addressing this challenge. International organizations such as the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC), the World Bank's StAR Initiative&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldbank.org/star|title=Home - Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative (StAR)|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Swiss-based non-governmental organization International Centre for Asset Recovery&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baselgovernance.org/icar/|title=Asset Recovery/ICAR - Basel Governance|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been offering training and capacity development.&lt;ref name="icar1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baselgovernance.org/icar|title=Asset Recovery/ICAR - Basel Governance|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several organizations have taken steps to address the lack of easily accessible, comprehensive and practical information on international asset recovery. This lack of information has been identified as a key problem by a number of countries at the first meeting of the UNCAC Open-Ended Working Group on Asset Recovery held in Vienna in August 2007. The ICAR hosts an online Asset Recovery Knowledge Center&lt;ref name="ARKC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assetrecovery.org|title=Asset Recovery Forum|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that includes technical publications, news articles, case studies, and individual country laws. Other organizations such as the StAR Initiative have created in-depth handbooks and manuals to assist practitioners. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) offers a free MLA Request Writer Tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/mla|title=Mutual Legal Assistance Request Writer Tool|first=|last=charlotte.gunnarsson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U4 Help Desk&lt;ref name="u4helpdesk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u4.no/helpdesk|title=Helpdesk|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives practitioners the ability to ask experts any question related to asset recovery/anti-corruption and receive a tailor made response within 10 working days (or assistance within 48 hours in case of urgency).&lt;ref name="u4helpdesk"/&gt;

== Challenges ==

Despite increases in national capacities and enhanced international cooperation, many technical, legal, political, and material challenges still remain. Furthermore, there are several thorny issues to be resolved concerning the repatriation and monitoring of stolen assets to victim countries.

=== Lack of political will to enforce recoveries ===

Lack of political will has been identified repeatedly as one of the stumbling blocks to effective international asset recovery.

While over 130 countries have ratified UNCAC, there still needs to be greater international cooperation and awareness. Twenty countries have signed but not ratified the UNCAC. In other cases, mutual legal assistance requests have not been honored in spite of treaty obligations. There are many examples of cases where international asset recovery would have been possible, if there had been political will. These include: monies in Switzerland frozen that belonged to the former Zaire President Mobutu Sese Seko and against former Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi.&lt;ref name="mobutumonies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/lawyer-warns-against-returning-mobutu-assets/7365572|title=Lawyer warns against returning Mobutu assets|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="moikrollreport"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/wiki/The_looting_of_Kenya_under_President_Moi|title=The looting of Kenya under President Moi - WikiLeaks|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Repatriation of assets ===

The exact terms of repatriation are still unclear. Without specific mutual legal assistance agreements, they are done on a case by case basis. For instance, Switzerland confiscated US 600 million of former Nigerian President Abacha's loot, but worked out an agreement to use the money for development purposes, monitored by the World Bank. Other potential agreements are not so generous. When Indonesia originally approached Hong Kong to repatriate Indonesian banker Hendra Rahardja's assets, the Hong Kong authorities offered to assist for a 20% commission, and then splitting the remaining money evenly.&lt;ref name="hari"&gt;[http://www.assetrecovery.org/kc/node/b1917646-e21a-11dd-8d28-f13739c882dc.52 RI poised to recover $800m in stolen assets ''The Jakarta Post'' May 9, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130414074129/http://www.assetrecovery.org/kc/node/b1917646-e21a-11dd-8d28-f13739c882dc.52 |date=April 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other impediments to asset recovery ===

*Lack of funding
*Lack of sufficient information
*Slow response (reluctance?) from requested countries
*Lack of technical capacity
*Lack of Remedial Procedures

Remedial procedures are necessary in situations where a defendant has died, absconded, or the statute of limitations has expired. Should any of these conditions apply, a traditional criminal process is not possible and assets cannot be recovered. Therefore, the UNCAC promotes the creation of remedial procedures to deal with such cases, such as Non-Conviction Based Forfeiture.

== Further reading ==

For more detailed information, the International Centre for Asset Recovery's Knowledge Center&lt;ref name="ARKC" /&gt; also contains a large collection of legal instruments, glossary, case studies, and publications relating to asset recovery.&lt;ref name="ARKC"/&gt; Notably, the Knowledge Center has an extensively detailed library of asset recovery related news articles, along with a Newsfeed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.assetrecovery.org/kc/rss/latest-news |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021234638/http://www.assetrecovery.org/kc/rss/latest-news |archivedate=2008-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that is updated daily.

The Stolen Assets Recovery Initiative has also put together a Stolen Asset Recovery bibliography&lt;ref&gt;http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTSARI/Resources/StAR_Bibilography_Final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which contains a list of books, journal articles and reports and other working papers produced by both governmental and nongovernmental organizations which touch upon issues associated with the recovery of stolen assets in cases of political corruption.&lt;ref name="bibliography"&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTSARI/Resources/StAR_Bibilography_Final.pdf Stolen Asset Recovery Bibliography, prepared by the World Bank StAR Initiative]&lt;/ref&gt; The materials listed in the bibliography focus on many aspects of the asset recovery process – from investigation and prosecution in corruption cases, to identification of stolen assets and also mutual legal assistance in situations where assets are located in a foreign jurisdiction from which a victim country seeks their return. The StAR bibliography also draws upon literature on related topics including money laundering prevention and civil asset forfeiture.

A '''jam session''' is a relatively informal musical event, process, or activity where [[musician]]s, typically instrumentalists, play improvised solos and [[vamp (music)|vamp]] on tunes, songs and [[chord progression]]s. To "jam" is to  [[musical improvisation|improvise]] music without extensive preparation or predefined [[arrangement]]s, except for when the group is playing well-known [[jazz standard]]s or [[Cover version|cover]]s of existing popular songs. Original jam sessions, also 'free flow sessions', are often used by musicians to develop new material (music) and find suitable [[arrangement]]s. Both styles can be used simply as a social gathering and communal practice session. Jam sessions may be based upon existing songs or forms, may be loosely based on an agreed [[chord progression]] or [[chord chart|chart]] suggested by one participant, or may be wholly improvisational. Jam sessions can range from very loose gatherings of amateurs to evenings where a jam session coordinator or host acts as a "[[gatekeeper]]" to ensure that only appropriate-level performers take the stage, to sophisticated improvised recording sessions by professionals which are intended to be broadcast live on radio or TV or edited and released to the public.

== Jazz ==
One source for the phrase "jam session" came about in the 1920s when white and black musicians would congregate after their regular paying gigs, to play the jazz they could not play in the "[[Paul Whiteman]]" style bands they played in. When [[Bing Crosby]] would attend these sessions, the musicians would say he was "jammin' the beat", since he would clap on the one and the three. Thus these sessions became known as "jam sessions".&lt;ref&gt;"Really The Blues" by Mezz Mezzrow&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mezz Mezzrow]] also gives this more detailed and self-referential description, based on his experience at the jazz speakeasy known as the Three Deuces:

{{quote
|text=
I think the term 'jam session' originated right in that cellar.  Long before that, of course, the colored boys used to get together and play for kicks, but those were mostly private sessions, strictly for professional musicians, and the idea was usually to try to cut each other, each one trying to outdo the others and prove himself best. Those impromptu concerts of theirs were generally known as 'cuttin' contests.'  Our idea…was to play together, to make the improvisation really collective… Down in that basement concert hall, somebody was always yelling over to me, 'Hey Jelly, what you gonna do?'—they gave me that nickname, or sometimes called me Roll, because I always wanted to play [[Clarence Williams (musician)|Clarence Williams]]' '(I Ain't Gonna Give Nobody None O' This) Jelly Roll'—and almost every time I'd cap them with, 'Jelly's gonna jam some now,' just as a kind of play on words.  We always used the word 'session' a lot, and I think the expression 'jam session' grew up out of this playful yelling back and forth.&lt;ref&gt; "Really the Blues," Milton "Mezz" Mezzrow and Bernard Wolfe, New York: Random House 1946, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

The New York  scene during [[World War II]] was famous for its after-hours jam sessions. One of the most famous was the regular after-hours jam at [[Minton's Playhouse]] in [[New York City]] that ran in the 1940s and early 1950s. The jam sessions at Minton's were a fertile meeting place and proving ground for both established soloists like [[Ben Webster]] and [[Lester Young]], and the younger jazz musicians who would soon become leading exponents of the [[bebop]] movement, including [[Thelonious Monk]] (Minton's house pianist), saxophone player [[Charlie Parker]], and trumpeter [[Dizzy Gillespie]]. The Minton's jams had competitive "[[cutting contest]]s", in which soloists would try to keep up with the house band and outdo each other in improvisational skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Giddins|first1=Gary|last2=DeVeaux|first2=Scott|date=2009|title=Jazz|publisher=W.W.

== Afro-Cuban music ==
{{main|Descarga}}
Influenced by jazz, [[Cuban music]] saw the emergence of improvised jam sessions during the [[filin (music)|filin]] movement of the 1940s, where [[bolero]]s, [[son cubano|sones]] and other song types were performed in an extended form called ''[[descarga]]''. During the 1950s these ''descargas'' became the basis of a new genre of improvised jams based on the [[son montuno]] with notable jazz influences pioneered by the likes of [[Julio Gutiérrez (musician)|Julio Gutiérrez]] and [[Cachao]]. During the 1960s, descargas played an important role in the development of [[salsa music|salsa]], especially the [[salsa dura]] style.&lt;ref name="Gerard"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gerard|first1=Charley|title=Music from Cuba: Mongo Santamaria, Chocolate Armenteros, and Cuban Musicians in the United States|date=2001|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group|Praeger Publishers]]|location=[[Westport, CT]]|pages=101–126|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cZH22u6_p50C|isbn=9780275966829}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rock ==
As the instrumental proficiency of pop and rock musicians improved in the 1960s and early 1970s, onstage jamming—free improvisation—also became a regular feature of rock music; bands such as [[Pink Floyd]], [[Cream (band)|Cream]], [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]], [[Deep Purple]], [[The Who]], [[Grateful Dead|the Grateful Dead]], [[AC/DC]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Santana (band)|Santana]], [[King Crimson]] and the [[Allman Brothers Band]] would feature live improvised performances that could last anywhere between 10 and 20 minutes. However, they can be shorter on the recorded version.

=== Jam bands ===
{{main|Jam band}}[[File:CK5 rocking the light board.jpg|thumb|right|200px| [[Phish]] is an example of a "jam band".]]

Though the [[Grateful Dead]] are often credited as being the first jam band, [[Cream (band)|Cream]] incorporated long improvisations into their songs as early as 1967. However, the Grateful Dead allowed the "jam band" to become a genre unto itself; more recent bands following in their steps include [[Phish]], [[moe.]], [[Umphreys Mcgee]], and [[Widespread Panic]], all of which feature extended improvisational sessions. Other bands, such as the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] also regularly perform live jam sessions. Progressive rock band [[Coheed and Cambria]] often end shows with a jam session to their song "The Final Cut" with different instruments.

== Bluegrass ==
[[Image:Bluegrass pickin'.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Bluegrass pickin'.]]
[[Bluegrass music]] also features a tradition of jamming. Bluegrass jams happen in the parking lots and campgrounds of bluegrass [[music festival|festival]]s, in music stores, bars and restaurants and on stages. Bluegrass jams tend to be segregated by the skill level of the players. Slow jams for beginners provide an entry point. Open bluegrass jams are open to all comers, but the players in an open jam will expect a certain level of proficiency from participants. The abilities to hear [[chord progression]]s and keep time are essential, and the ability to play improvised leads that contain at least a suggestion of the melody is desirable. Jams that require advanced musical proficiency are generally private events, by invitation only.&lt;!-- Newbie gate crashers are politely, but firmly ushered out the door --&gt;

'''John Cary "Red" Morgan''' (August 24, 1914 – January 17, 1991) was a [[United States Army Air Forces]] pilot in [[World War II]] who received the [[Medal of Honor]] for his actions during a 1943 bombing run over Germany, which also inspired the character of 2nd Lieutenant Jesse Bishop in the novel and film ''[[Twelve O'Clock High]]''.

==Background==
Born August 24, 1914, in [[Vernon, Texas|Vernon]], [[Texas]], son of attorney Samuel A. Morgan Sr. and Verna Johnson Morgan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?indiv=1&amp;dbid=6224&amp;h=61465878&amp;ssrc=pt&amp;tid=19424490&amp;pid=28058036099&amp;usePUB=true] Year: 1930; Census Place: Amarillo, Potter, Texas; Roll: 2384; Page: 12A; Enumeration District: 0012; Image: 601.0; FHL microfilm: 2342118.

Fifteenth Census of the United States, 1930. Washington, D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, 1930. T626, 2,667 rolls.&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan graduated from a military school in 1931 and then attended several colleges, including [[Amarillo College]], [[New Mexico Military Institute]], [[West Texas A&amp;M University|West Texas State Teachers College]], and the [[University of Texas]] at [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]. While at Texas he learned to fly aircraft, and in 1934 dropped out of college. He worked in the [[Fiji|Fiji Islands]] as a foreman on a [[pineapple]] [[plantation]] until 1938, when he returned to enlist as an aviation cadet in the U.S. Army Air Corps. However, because of his poor education record, he was refused enlistment. Working at an [[oil well|oil-drilling]] site for [[Texaco]], Morgan suffered a broken neck in an [[industrial accident]], and as a result was later classified [[4F (military conscription)|4-F]] by the [[Selective Service System]].

==Military service==
In August, 1941, Morgan joined the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]], and after completion of flight training in [[Saskatchewan]], [[Ontario]], and [[Church Lawford|RAF Church Lawford]], [[England]], was posted as a [[Sergeant Pilot]] with [[RAF Bomber Command]]. On March 23, 1943, he was transferred to the U.S. Army Air Forces as a [[Flight Officer]] and assigned to the [[RAF Alconbury#92d Bombardment Group (Heavy)|92nd Bomb Group]]'s 326th Bomb Squadron, [[RAF Alconbury]], [[England]].

Morgan, on his fifth U.S. mission, was [[co-pilot]] of a crew flying a [[B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17F]], ser. no. 42-29802, to a target in [[Hanover]], [[Germany]], on July 28, 1943. It was for his participation in this mission that he received the Medal of Honor (citation shown below in full), which was awarded on December 18, 1943.

===Medal of Honor action===
Morgan's experience began as his group formation neared the German coast. The B-17, nicknamed ''Ruthie II'', was attacked by a large number of [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]] fighters and had part of its oxygen system to the gunners' positions in the rear of the aircraft knocked out. The first burst of fire also smashed the cockpit's windshield, damaged the interphone, and split open the skull of pilot Lt. Robert Campbell. The pilot's upper body slumped over his control wheel, causing it to start out of control. F/O Morgan seized the controls on his side and by sheer strength pulled the plane back into formation.

The disabled pilot continued to try to wrest the controls away from Morgan and smashed at the co-pilot with his fists, knocking some teeth loose and blackening both his eyes. Meanwhile, the top turret gunner was also seriously injured when a 20&amp;nbsp;mm shell tore off his left arm at the shoulder. He fell out of the turret position, and was found by the navigator bleeding to death. The navigator bailed the gunner out of the aircraft in a successful effort to save his life.

Unknown to Morgan, the waist, tail and radio gunners became unconscious from lack of oxygen and were threatened with death by [[Hypoxia (medical)|anoxia]]. Morgan, unable to call for assistance because of the damaged interphone, had to decide whether to turn back immediately or try to fly all the way to the target and back within the protection of the formation. He also had to decide whether or not to subject Campbell to anoxia by cutting off his oxygen to disable him. In spite of wild efforts by the fatally wounded pilot to seize the controls, Morgan chose to complete the mission and not cut off his pilot's oxygen supply.

For two hours he held position in the formation - flying with one hand, fighting off the pilot with the other. At length the navigator entered the flight deck and relieved the situation. The navigator and bombardier secured the dying pilot in the nose compartment of the airplane. F/O  Morgan's B-17 reached the target at [[Hanover]] and successfully dropped its bombs. 
With all his fuel gauges reading empty, Morgan landed the bomber at [[RAF Foulsham]]. Lt. Campbell died an hour and half later, and the five surviving  gunners recovered from various degrees of frostbite. The B-17 was declared damaged beyond economical repair and never flew again.

===Subsequent career===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:John Cary Red Morgan.gif|thumb|left|135px|John C. "Red" Morgan|{{ifdc|1=John Cary Red Morgan.gif|log=2009 March 25}}]] --&gt;
F/O Morgan transferred to the [[RAF Alconbury#482d Bombardment Group (Pathfinder)|482nd Bomb Group]] in October 1943 to fly B-17 [[H2X radar]] aircraft and was promoted to [[second lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] in November. He remained on combat duty, flying in all 25½ missions. On March 6, 1944, Morgan was the pilot of a B-17 leading the first major USAAF attack against [[Berlin]] when he was shot down and captured, held in [[Stalag Luft I]], [[Barth, Germany|Barth]], Germany, for the remainder of the war, the only person to become a POW after being awarded the Medal of Honor.

In 1948 [[Sy Bartlett]] and [[Beirne Lay, Jr.]] published their novel ''[[Twelve O'Clock High]]'' and used Morgan as a model for a primary character, Lt. Jesse Bishop. The wording of his actions appearing in his citation was used as dialogue in the script to describe the actions of Bishop under similar circumstances, and like Morgan, Bishop's character was awarded the Medal of Honor and later became a POW. The circumstances also became a featured part of the 1949 film adaptation.

After the war, Morgan returned to work for Texaco in [[California]] selling [[aviation fuel]].  Called back to active duty when the Korean War broke out, he took a leave of absence from Texaco (1950 - 1953) and applied for combat duty.  The Air Force denied his request but allowed him to fly cargo planes in the United States for two years.  He completed his final year on active duty in the office of the Deputy Assistant [[Secretary of the Air Force]]. He retired from the Air Force, a lieutenant colonel. Morgan is survived by his only child Sam Morgan, who himself retired from the US Air Force after 20 plus years of service.  Morgan has four grandchildren and three step grandchildren of which three are currently serving in the Army and Marine Corps.  Mark, the oldest, has served in every operation since Desert Storm in 1991 minus the Balkan Campaigns.  John, Wade and Rachel have all served one or more tours in Iraq or Afghanistan since the attacks on 9/11.

Morgan died on January 17, 1991, from complications associated with Alzheimer's and a stroke and is buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]].

When questioned of his valor and heroism, Morgan replied,''" There's no such thing as a hero. ... I was pushed into circumstances where I was forced to act. You can never say how you're going to react to something until it happens, but I think most people would have done the same."''

==Medal of Honor citation==
'''Citation''':

&lt;blockquote&gt;For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty, while participating on a bombing mission over enemy-occupied continental [[Europe]], 28 (''sic'') July 1943. Prior to reaching the German coast on the way to the target, the B17 aircraft in which 2d Lt. (''sic'') Morgan was serving as [[co-pilot]] was attacked by a large force of enemy fighters, during which the [[oxygen]] system to the tail, waist, and radio gun positions was knocked out. A frontal attack placed a cannon shell through the windshield, totally shattering it, and the pilot's skull was split open by a .303 caliber shell, leaving him in a crazed condition. The pilot fell over the steering wheel, tightly clamping his arms around it. 2d Lt. Morgan at once grasped the controls from his side and, by sheer strength, pulled the aircraft back into formation despite the frantic struggles of the semiconscious pilot. The [[intercom|interphone]] had been destroyed, rendering it impossible to call for help. At this time the top turret gunner fell to the floor and down through the hatch with his arm shot off at the shoulder and a gaping wound in his side. The waist, tail, and radio gunners had lost consciousness from lack of oxygen and, hearing no fire from their guns, the copilot believed they had bailed out. The wounded pilot still offered desperate resistance in his crazed attempts to fly the aircraft. There remained the prospect of flying to and over the target and back to a friendly base wholly unassisted. In the face of this desperate situation, 2d Lt. Officer Morgan made his decision to continue the flight and protect any members of the crew who might still be in the ship and for 2 hours he flew in formation with one hand at the controls and the other holding off the struggling pilot before the navigator entered the steering compartment and relieved the situation. The miraculous and heroic performance of 2d Lt. Morgan on this occasion resulted in the successful completion of a vital bombing mission and the safe return of his aircraft and crew.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He was named as "the principal architect of the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]]" in the ''[[9/11 Commission Report]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/10024-khalid-shaikh-mohammed | title=The Guantánamo Docket: Khalid Shaikh Mohammed | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheikh Mohammed was a member of [[Osama bin Laden]]'s [[al-Qaeda]] organization, leading al-Qaeda's [[propaganda]] operations from around 1999 until late 2001. He confessed to FBI and CIA agents to a role in many of the most significant terrorist plots over the last twenty years, but his interrogators' use of [[torture]] has caused many to question certain aspects of his confessions.&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/mar/19/truthandtorture |title=Truth and torture &amp;#124; Comment is free |publisher=Theguardian.co.uk |date=May 20, 2014 |accessdate=June 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mohammed was captured on March 1, 2003, in the Pakistani city of [[Rawalpindi]] by a combined operation of the US [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) and Pakistan's [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI).  Immediately after his capture, Mohammad was [[Extraordinary rendition|extraordinarily rendered]] to secret CIA prison sites in Afghanistan, then Poland, where he was interrogated by U.S. operatives.&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Filkins |first1=Dexter |title=Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and the C.I.A. |url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/khalid-sheikh-mohammed-cia |website=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt; By December 2006 he had been transferred to military custody at [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]]. In March 2007, after significant interrogations, Mohammed confessed to masterminding the [[September 11 attacks]], the [[Richard Reid]] shoe bombing attempt to blow up an airliner, the [[Bali nightclub bombing]] in [[Indonesia]], the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]], the murder of [[Daniel Pearl]], and various foiled attacks, as well as numerous other crimes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Black-Banners-Inside-Against-al-Qaeda/dp/0393079422 [[Ali Soufan]] and Daniel Freedman, ''The Black Banners: The Inside Story of 9/11 and the War Against al-Qaeda''], 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prosecutor"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/04/khalid-sheikh-mohammed-military-prosecutor Chris McGreal, "Khalid Sheikh Mohammed: former military prosecutor denounces trial"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', May 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He was charged in February 2008 with [[war crimes]] and murder by a [[Military Commissions Act of 2006|U.S. military commission]] at Guantanamo Bay detention camp which could carry the [[death penalty]] if convicted.

According to U.S. federal documents, in 1982 he had heard [[Abdul Rasul Sayyaf]]'s speech in which a call for jihad against the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] was declared.&lt;ref name=NYTimesGuantanamoDocketISN10024 /&gt; At age 16, he joined the [[Muslim Brotherhood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |publisher=Harper Paperbacks |last=Mcdermott |first=Terry |title=Perfect Soldiers: The 9/11 Hijackers: Who They Were, Why They Did It |date=August 1, 2006}}, page 111&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from high school in 1983, Mohammad travelled to the [[United States]] and enrolled in [[Chowan University]] in [[Murfreesboro, North Carolina]].

The following year he went to [[Peshawar]], Pakistan,&lt;ref name=NYTimesGuantanamoDocketISN10024 /&gt; where he and his brothers, including [[Zahid Al-Sheikh|Zahed]], joined the [[mujahideen]] forces engaged in the [[Soviet–Afghan War]]. He attended the Sada training camp run by Sheikh [[Abdallah Azzam]], and after that he worked for the magazine ''al-Bunyan al-Marsous'', produced by Sayyaf's rebel group, the [[Islamic Union for the Liberation of Afghanistan]]. In 1992, he received a master's degree in Islamic Culture and History through correspondence classes from [[University of the Punjab|Punjab University]] in Pakistan.&lt;ref name=NYTimesGuantanamoDocketISN10024 /&gt; By 1993, Mohammad had married and moved his family to [[Qatar]], where he took a position as project engineer with the Qatari Ministry of Electricity and Water.&lt;ref name=NYTimesGuantanamoDocketISN10024 /&gt; He began to travel to different countries from that time onward.

The United States 9/11 Commission Report notes that, "By his own account, KSM's animus toward the United States stemmed not from his experiences there as a student, but rather from his violent disagreement with U.S. foreign policy favoring Israel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report.pdf |format=PDF |title=The 9/11 Commission Report |publisher=9-11commission.gov |accessdate=June 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on August 29, 2009, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported from US intelligence sources that Mohammed's time in the U.S. contributed to his radicalisation.

&lt;blockquote&gt;KSM's limited and negative experience in the United States—which included a brief jail stay because of unpaid bills—almost certainly helped propel him on his path to becoming a terrorist," according to this intelligence summary. "He stated that his contact with Americans, while minimal, confirmed his view that the United States was a debauched and racist country."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32605529/ns/us_news-washington_post/ "9/11 planner is recast as key asset for CIA"], [[MSNBC]]. accessed September 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Philippines 1994–1995===
Mohammed was in the [[Philippines]] in late 1994 and early 1995; he then identified as a [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] or a [[Qatar]]i [[plywood]] exporter and used the aliases "Abdul Majid" and "Salem Ali."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Alleged Sept. 11 mastermind's nephew plotted 1993 bombing: FBI's most-wanted terrorist after bin Laden lived in luxury in Philippines with '93 plotter |work=Ottawa Citizen |agency=Associated Press |date=June 26, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|title=Womaniser, joker, scuba diver: the other face of al-Qaida's No 3 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/mar/03/alqaida.terrorism1|accessdate=September 12, 2006 |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=March 3, 2003 |first=Rohan |last=Gunaratna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bosnia 1995===

The news agency [[Adnkronos]] reported in 2009 that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, under an assumed name, had traveled to Bosnia in 1995, as a humanitarian aid worker for Egyptian Relief.&lt;ref name=Adnkronos2009-01-20&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.adnkronos.com/AKI/English/Security/?id=3.0.2928330465|title=Bosnia: Senior al-Qaeda figure granted citizenship, says report|publisher=[[Adnkronos]]|date=January 20, 2009|accessdate=January 23, 2009|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adnkronos quoted the [[Sarajevo]] paper ''Daily Fokus'', reporting that local intelligence officials confirmed Mohammed had obtained Bosnian citizenship in November 1995.&lt;ref name=Adnkronos2009-01-20 /&gt; Those officials told ''Daily Fokus'' that Egyptian Relief was a front for the [[Muslim Brotherhood]].

==Alleged terrorist activities==
&lt;!-- Please do not remove word "Alleged" from above heading. It is applicable for legal reasons, especially as Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is alive. --&gt;

===Operation Bojinka===
{{Main|Bojinka plot}}
Mohammed traveled to the [[Philippines]] in 1994 to work with his nephew [[Ramzi Yousef]] on the Bojinka plot, a [[Manila]]-based plot to destroy twelve commercial airliners flying routes between the United States, [[East Asia]], and [[Southeast Asia]]. The 9/11 Commission Report says that "this marked the first time KSM took part in the actual planning of a terrorist operation."&lt;ref name="911report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_Ch5.htm |title=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|publisher=9-11commission|accessdate=August 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Using airline timetables, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Ramzi Yousef devised a scheme whereby five men could, in a single day, board 12 flights—two each for three of the men, three each for the other two—assemble and deposit their bombs and exit the planes, leaving timers to ignite the bombs up to several days afterward. By the time the bombs exploded, the men would be far away and far from reasonable suspicion. The math was simple: 12 flights with at least 400 people per flight. Somewhere in the neighborhood of 5,000 deaths. It would be a day of glory for them, calamity for the Americans they supposed would fill the aircraft.&lt;ref name="mcdermott"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/aug/11/nation/na-manila11|title=Echoes of '95 Manila Plot|accessdate=September 13, 2006|work=Los Angeles Times|first=Terry|last=McDermott| date=August 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bojinka plans included renting or buying a [[Cessna]], packing it with explosives and crash landing it into CIA headquarters, with a backup plan to hijack the twelfth airliner in the air and use that instead. This information was reported in detail to the U.S. at the time.

In December 1994, Yousef had engaged in a test of a bomb on [[Philippine Airlines Flight 434]] using only about ten percent of the explosives that were to be used in each of the bombs to be planted on US airliners. The test resulted in the death of a Japanese national on board a flight from the Philippines to Japan. Mohammed conspired with Yousef in the plot until it was uncovered on January 6, 1995. Yousef was captured February 7 of that same year.

Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was indicted on terrorism charges in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]] in January 1996 for his alleged involvement in Operation Bojinka,&lt;ref name="mohammed"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2003-03-02/world/mohammed.biog_1_ahmed-abdul-qadoos-al-qaeda-military-committee-ayman-al-zawahiri?_s=PM:asiapcf |publisher=CNN |title=Top al Qaeda operative caught in Pakistan |date=March 1, 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302073403/http://articles.cnn.com/2003-03-02/world/mohammed.biog_1_ahmed-abdul-qadoos-al-qaeda-military-committee-ayman-al-zawahiri?_s=PM%3Aasiapcf |archivedate=March 2, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was subsequently placed on the October 10, 2001, initial list of the FBI's twenty-two [[FBI Most Wanted Terrorists|Most Wanted Terrorists]].&lt;ref name="List Released"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/10/10/inv.mostwanted.list/ |title=Most wanted terrorists list released |date=October 1, 2001 |accessdate=July 18, 2008 |publisher=CNN |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080714134800/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/10/10/inv.mostwanted.list/ |archivedate=July 14, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renewal of relationship with Osama bin Laden===
By the time the [[Bojinka plot]] was discovered, Mohammed had returned to Qatar and his job as a project engineer at the country's Ministry of Electricity and Water. He traveled in 1995 to [[Sudan]], [[Yemen]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Brazil]] to visit elements of the worldwide [[jihadist]] community, although no evidence connects him to specific terrorist actions in any of those locations. On his trip to Sudan, he attempted to meet with [[Osama Bin Laden]], who was at the time living there, aided by Sudanese political leader [[Hassan al-Turabi]]. After the US asked the Qatari government to arrest Mohammed in January 1996, he fled to [[Afghanistan]], where he renewed his alliance with Abdul Rasul Sayyaf. Later that year, he formed a working relationship with Bin Laden, who had settled there.

Bin Laden and his colleagues relocated their operations to Afghanistan at this time. [[Abu Hafs al-Masri]]/[[Mohammed Atef]], bin Laden's chief of operations, arranged a meeting between bin Laden and Mohammed in [[Tora Bora]] sometime in mid-1996, in which Mohammed outlined a plan that would eventually become the quadruple hijackings of 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3128802.stm|title=Suspect 'reveals 9/11 planning'|publisher=BBC News|date=September 22, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bin Laden urged Mohammed to become a full-fledged member of Al Qaeda, but he continued to refuse such a commitment until around early 1999, after the [[1998 U.S. embassy bombings]] in [[Nairobi]] and [[Dar es Salaam]].&lt;ref name="911-ch5"&gt;{{cite book|title=9/11 Commission Report|author=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|year=2004|publisher=Government Printing Office|chapter=Chapter 5|url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_Ch5.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mohammed moved his family from [[Iran]] to [[Karachi]], [[Pakistan]], in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;''9/11 Commission Report'', p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; That year, he tried unsuccessfully to join mujahideen leader [[Ibn al-Khattab]] in [[Chechnya]], another area of special interest to Mohammed. Unable to travel to Chechnya, he returned to Afghanistan. He ultimately accepted bin Laden's invitation to move to [[Kandahar]] and join al-Qaeda as a full-fledged member. Eventually, he became leader of Al Qaeda's [[Mass media|media]] committee.

===Plan for September 11, 2001 attacks===
{{main|September 11 attacks}}
The first hijack plan that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed presented to the leadership of [[al-Qaeda]] called for several airplanes on both east and west coasts to be hijacked and flown into targets. His plan evolved from an earlier foiled plot known as the Bojinka plot (see above). Bin Laden rejected some potential targets suggested by Mohammed, such as the [[U.S. Bank Tower (Los Angeles)|U.S. Bank Tower]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Looming Tower|The Looming Tower: Al-Qaeda and the Road to 9/11]] |author=Wright, Lawrence |year=2006 |publisher=Knopf |page=308 |authorlink=Lawrence Wright}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1998 or early 1999, Bin Laden gave approval for Mohammed to proceed to organize the plot.&lt;ref name="911-ch5"/&gt; Meetings in early 1999 took place with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Osama bin Laden, and his military chief [[Mohammed Atef]].&lt;ref name="911-ch5"/&gt; Bin Laden led the plot and provided financial support.&lt;ref name="911-ch5"/&gt; He was also involved in selecting the participants, including choosing [[Mohamed Atta]] as the lead hijacker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bergen, Peter |title=[[The Osama bin Laden I Know]] |publisher=Free Press |year=2006 |page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khalid Shekih provided operational support, such as selecting targets and helping arrange travel for the hijackers.&lt;ref name="911-ch5"/&gt; Atef directed the actions of the hijackers.&lt;ref name=uoqnvz&gt;{{cite web|last=Schone |first=Mark |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/scenes-planners-911-attacks/story?id=11610817#.Tzh5u1GRlJF |title=9/11 Perpetrators: Where Are They Now? – ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=September 11, 2010 |accessdate=July 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Atta was chosen as the leader of the mission, "he met with Bin Laden to discuss the targets: the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]], which represented the U.S. economy; [[the Pentagon]], a symbol of the U.S. military; and the [[U.S. Capitol]], the perceived source of U.S. policy in support of Israel. The [[White House]] was also on the list, as Bin Laden considered it a political symbol and wanted to attack it as well." If any pilot could not reach his intended target, he was to crash the plane.&lt;ref&gt;

According to testimony by Philip Zelikow, bin Laden was motivated by a desire to punish the US for supporting Israel and wanted to move up the attack date. Mohammed argued for ensuring the teams were prepared.

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Bin Laden] allegedly told KSM it would be sufficient simply to down the planes and not hit specific targets. KSM stood his ground, arguing that the operation would not be successful unless the pilots were fully trained and the hijacking teams were larger.&lt;ref name=PbsNewshour&gt;

In a 2002 interview with [[Al Jazeera]] journalist [[Yosri Fouda]], Mohammed admitted that he and [[Ramzi bin al-Shibh]] were involved in the "Holy Tuesday operation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/mar/04/alqaida.terrorism |title= 'We left out nuclear targets, for now' |newspaper=The Guardian |date=March 3, 2003 | location=London | accessdate=April 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; KSM, however, disputes this claim via his Personal Representative: "I never stated to the Al Jazeera reporter that I was the head of the al-Qaeda military committee."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.defenselink.mil/news/transcript_ISN10024.pdf|title=Verbatim Transcript of Combatant Status Review Tribunal Hearing for ISN 10024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2002 interview with ''[[Al Jazeera]]'' correspondent [[Yosri Fouda]],  KSM and  [[Ramzi bin al-Shibh]], described the preparations for 9/11 attacks and said that they first thought of "striking at a couple of nuclear facilities" in the USA but then "it was eventually decided to leave out nuclear targets for now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/mar/04/alqaida.terrorism|title='We left out nuclear targets, for now'|date=March 4, 2003|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was captured in [[Rawalpindi]], [[Pakistan]] (about 20&amp;nbsp;km southwest of Islamabad), on March 1, 2003, by the Pakistani ISI, possibly in a joint action with the CIA's [[Special Activities Division]] paramilitary operatives&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/22/washington/22ksm.html|title=Inside a 9/11 Mastermind's Interrogation|date=June 22, 2008|last=Shane|first=Scott|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and officers of the American [[Diplomatic Security Service]]. He has been in U.S. custody since that time.

Initially Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was held in the CIA's [[Salt Pit]] (''Cobalt'') prison in [[Afghanistan]]. After just a "few minutes" of questioning at ''Cobalt'', he was subject to "[[enhanced interrogation techniques]]". He was slapped, grabbed in the face, placed in [[stress positions]], placed in standing [[sleep deprivation]], doused with water, subject to [[Murphy drip|rectal rehydration]] multiple times, without a determination of medical need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=December 9, 2014|title=Inside the CIA's Sadistic Dungeon|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/09/inside-a-cia-dungeon.html#|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|accessdate=December 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2003, Mohammad was held at a secret CIA prison, or [[black site]], in [[Poland]], where the CIA [[waterboarding|waterboarded]] him 183 times.&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt; He was then transferred to another secret CIA prison in [[Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-23269437|title=BBC News – Khalid Sheikh Mohammed 'asked to design' vacuum cleaner|work=[[BBC ]]|accessdate=July 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2006, the U.S. government announced it had moved Mohammed from a secret CIA prison (or [[black site]]) to the military custody at the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5321606.stm |title=Americas &amp;#124; Bush admits to CIA secret prisons |publisher=News.bbc.co.uk |date=September 7, 2006 |accessdate=June 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Red Cross]], [[Human Rights Watch]] and Mohammed consider that the harsh interrogation techniques, including [[waterboarding]], which he received from U.S. agents amount to [[torture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/projects/pdf/042809_redcross.pdf|title=Red Cross report; page 37|format=PDF|date=February 14, 2007|accessdate=October 6, 2010|publisher=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Randall|last=Mikkelsen|title=CIA says used waterboarding on three suspects|date=February 5, 2008|publisher=Reuters|url =https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSN05191813|accessdate=November 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mohammad was also subject to [[sleep deprivation]] for a period of seven-and-a-half days, during much of which he was forced to stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/09/cia-torture-report-worst-findings-waterboard-rectal |title=Rectal rehydration and broken limbs: the grisliest findings in the CIA torture report &amp;#124; US news |publisher=Theguardian.com |date= |accessdate=June 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to later reports, Mohammed initially told American interrogators he would not answer any questions until he was provided with a lawyer, which was refused. He claims to have been kept naked for more than a month during his isolation and interrogations, and said he was "questioned by an unusual number of female handlers".&lt;ref name='MayerPg273'&gt;{{cite book|last=Mayer|first=Jane|authorlink=Jane Mayer|title=The Dark Side: The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned Into a War on American Ideals|publisher=Random House, Inc.|year=2009|page=273|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w8-y8v99TCIC&amp;pg=PA273|isbn=9780307456298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A CIA document reveals that [[Jane Harman]] (D-CA) and [[Porter Goss]] (R-FL) of the [[House Intelligence Committee]] were briefed on July 13, 2004, by the CIA [[Deputy Director for Operations]] [[James Pavitt]], General Counsel Scott Muller, and [[CIA Inspector General]] [[John L. Helgerson]] on the status of the interrogation process of Mohammed. By this date, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed had been subjected to 183 applications of waterboarding.&lt;ref name="bradbury1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bradbury|first=Steven|title=Memorandum from Steven Bradbury for John A.

A U.S. official has clarified that the "183"  number represents the number of times water was poured onto Mohammed's face—not the number of times the CIA waterboarded him. According to a 2007 Red Cross report,  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was subjected a total of "five sessions of ill-treatment."

"The water was poured 183 times – there were 183 pours," the official explained, adding that "each pour was a matter of seconds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/projects/pdf/042809_redcross.pdf |format=PDF |title=ICRC Report on the Treatment of Fourteen 'High Value Detainees' in CIA Custody |date=February 2007 |publisher=Foxnews.com |accessdate=June 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2006 Mohammed described his mistreatment and torture in detention, including the waterboarding, to a representative of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]].

According to the "unclassified summary of evidence" presented during the CSRT hearing, a computer hard drive seized during the capture of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed contained the following:
* information about the four airplanes hijacked on September 11, 2001 including code names, airline company, flight number, target, pilot name and background information, and names of the hijackers;
* photographs of 19 individuals identified as September 11, 2001 hijackers;
* a document that listed the pilot license fees for Mohammad Atta and biographies for some of September 11, 2001 hijackers;
* images of passports and an image of [[Mohamed Atta|Mohammad Atta]];
* transcripts of chat sessions belonging to at least one of September 11, 2001 hijackers;
* three letters from Osama bin Laden;
* spreadsheets that describe financial assistance to families of known al Qaeda members
* a letter to the United Arab Emirates threatening attack if their government continued to help the United States;
* a document that summarized operational procedures and training requirements of an al Qaeda cell; and
* a list of killed and wounded al Qaeda militants.

At the hearing, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed said the computer belonged not to him, but to [[Mustafa Ahmad al-Hawsawi]], arrested together with him.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:Verbatim Transcript of Combatant Status Review Tribunal Hearing for ISN 10024]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, a ''[[New York Times]]'' article, citing unnamed CIA officers, claimed that Mohammed had been held in a [[black site]] or secret facility in [[Poland]] near [[Szczytno-Szymany International Airport|Szymany Airport]], about 100 miles north of [[Warsaw]].

In April 2011, the British newspaper, ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' said it received [[Guantanamo Bay files leak|leaked documents]] regarding the [[Guantanamo Bay]] interrogations of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.

They helped us disrupt an al Qaeda operation to develop anthrax for terrorist attacks.

In March 2007, Mohammed testified before a closed-door hearing in Guantánamo Bay. According to transcripts of the hearing released by the Pentagon, he said, "I was responsible for the 9/11 operation, from A to Z." The transcripts also show him confessing to:

* The [[Bali nightclub bombings]],
* Richard Reid's attempted shoe bombing,
* Planning the attacks on [[Heathrow Airport]] and [[Clock Tower, Palace of Westminster|Big Ben clock tower]] in London,

CIA officials have previously told [[ABC News]] that "Mohammed lasted the longest under waterboarding, two and a half minutes, before beginning to talk."&lt;ref name=Abc&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/Investigation/story?id=1322866 CIA's Harsh Interrogation Techniques Described: Sources Say Agency's Tactics Lead to Questionable Confessions, Sometimes to Death], ABC News, November 18, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Legal experts say this could taint all his statements. Forensic psychiatrist [[Michael Welner]], M.D., an expert in false confessions, observed from the testimony transcript that his concerns about his family may have been far more influential in soliciting Mohammed's cooperation than any earlier reported mistreatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/Health/story?id=2955471&amp;page=1|title=ABC News: Expert Looks Beyond Mohammed's Confessions|publisher=Abc News|date=March 15, 2007|accessdate=October 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One CIA official cautioned that "many of Mohammed's claims during interrogation were 'white noise' designed to send the U.S. on wild goose chases or to get him through the day's interrogation session." For example, according to [[Mike Rogers (Michigan politician)|Mike Rogers]], a former FBI agent and the top [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] on the terrorism panel of the [[House Intelligence Committee]], he admitted responsibility for the Bali nightclub bombing, but his involvement "could have been as small as arranging a safe house for travel. It could have been arranging finance." Mohammed also made the admission that he was "responsible for the 1993 World Trade Center Operation," which killed six and injured more than 1,000 when a bomb was detonated in an underground garage, Mohammed did not plan the attack, but he may have supported it. [[Michael Welner]] noted that by offering legitimate information to interrogators, Mohammed had secured the leverage to provide misinformation as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Khalid Sheikh Mohammed's own words provide glimpse into the mind of a terrorist |url=http://www.wsvn.com/news/articles/world/BO46072/ |publisher=WSVN |agency=Associated Press |date=March 16, 2007 |accessdate=March 11, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825162537/http://www.wsvn.com/news/articles/world/BO46072/ |archivedate=August 25, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article discussing the reliability of Khalid's confession and the motive for giving misinformation under torture, Ali Soufan, a former FBI special agent with considerable experience interrogating al-Qaeda operatives, pointed out that:

{{quote|When they are in pain, people will say anything to get the pain to stop. Most of the time, they will lie, make up anything to make you stop hurting them. That means the information you're getting is useless.}}

His words are echoed by the US Army Training Manual's section on interrogation, which suggests that:

{{quote|the use of force is a poor technique, as it ... can induce the source to say whatever he thinks the interrogator wants to hear.}}

As an example of this the article discloses that although the George W. Bush administration made claims that the water-boarding (simulated drowning) of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed produced vital information that allowed them to break up a plot to attack the [[U.S. Bank Tower]] (formerly Library Tower and First Interstate Bank World Center) in Los Angeles in 2002, this has been proven to be untrue. In 2002 Sheikh Mohammed was busy evading capture in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/the-lay-scientist/2010/nov/04/2|title=Does torture work?|work=The Guardian|date=November 4, 2010|accessdate=June 15, 2011|location=London|first=Martin|last=Robbins}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise the claim by the Obama administration that torture of Kahlid Mohammed led to the lead in finding Osama Bin Laden has also been shown to be false. According to U.S. Senator John McCain, "The trail to bin Laden did not begin with a disclosure from Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who was waterboarded 183 times ... not only did the use of 'enhanced interrogation techniques' on Khalid Sheikh Mohammed not provide us with key leads on bin Laden's courier, Abu Ahmed; it actually produced false and misleading information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ken|last=Dilanian|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/may/12/news/la-pn-mccain-bin-laden-20110512|title=John McCain: Abusive interrogation didn't yield trail to Osama bin Laden|work=Los Angeles Times|date=May 12, 2011|accessdate=July 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43007276/ns/politics-more_politics/t/mccain-says-torture-did-not-lead-bin-laden/#.UH-ZW8XMhIE|title=McCain says torture did not lead to bin Laden|publisher=MSNBC|date=December 5, 2011|accessdate=July 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Mohammed arrived at Guantánamo, a team of FBI and military interrogators tried to elicit from him the same confessions that the CIA had obtained about the 9/11 plot, but by using only legal means of interrogation. By 2008, the Bush Administration believed that this so-called Clean Team had compiled sufficient evidence to charge Mohammed and the others with capital murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/02/15/100215fa_fact_mayer|title=The Trial.Eric Holder and the battle over Khalid Sheikh Mohammed|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=February 16, 2010|author=[[Jane Mayer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, also known as Sheikh Omar, was [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]] in a Pakistani court for the murder of Daniel Pearl. Omar's lawyers recently announced that they planned to use Mohammed's confession in an appeal. They had always acknowledged that Omar played a role in Pearl's murder, but argue that Mohammed was the actual murderer.

==Prosecution in France==
In 2009, the French government decided to try Khalid Sheikh Mohammed ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' on terrorism charges with respect to the [[Ghriba synagogue bombing]] on the [[Tunis]]ian island of [[Djerba]] in 2002, which killed 14 German tourists, five Tunisians and two French nationals. They intended to charge him along with the captured German national [[Christian Ganczarski]] and Tunisian Walid Nawar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h7KDqZLMV7eCw9v9p68QHjoesfNQ |title=France tries trio over Djerba synagogue bombing |publisher=Google.com |date=January 4, 2009 |accessdate=July 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; French judges later decided to separate Khalid Sheikh Mohammed's case from those of Ganczarski and Nawar and try him separately at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expatica.com/nl/news/local_news/Al-Qaeda-militant-found-guilty-for-Tunisian-synagogue-attack-_49356.html |title=Michel Moutot.

==Trial for role in World Trade Center attacks ==
{{main|United States v. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed}}
On February 11, 2008, the [[United States Department of Defense]] charged Mohammed, [[Ramzi bin al-Shibh]], [[Mustafa Ahmad al-Hawsawi]], [[Ali Abd al-Aziz Ali]] and [[Walid Bin Attash]] for the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] under the [[Guantanamo military commission|military commission]] system, as established under the [[Military Commissions Act of 2006]]. They have reportedly been charged with the murder of almost 3000 people, terrorism and [[providing material support for terrorism]] and plane hijacking; as well as attacking civilian objects, intentionally causing serious bodily injury and destruction of property in violation of the law of war. The charges against them list 169 overt acts allegedly committed by the defendants in furtherance of the September 11 events.&lt;ref name=Charged&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defense.gov/news/commissionsCo-conspirators.html |title=U.S. Department of Defense – Military Commissions |publisher=Defense.gov |accessdate=October 6, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101109025708/http://www.defense.gov/news/commissionsCo-conspirators.html |archivedate=November 9, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The charges include 2,973 individual counts of murder—one for each person killed in the 9/11 attacks.&lt;ref name="bbc6jun08"&gt;{{cite news|title=Guantanamo 9/11 suspects on trial|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7437164.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=June 6, 2008|accessdate=December 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution is seeking the [[death penalty]], which would require the unanimous agreement of the commission judges.&lt;ref name=Charged/&gt;

[[Human rights]] groups, including [[Amnesty International]], [[Human Rights Watch]] and the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]], and U.S. military defense lawyers have criticised the military commissions for lacking due process for a fair trial. Critics generally argue for the trials to be held in a [[United States district court|federal district court]], with defendants treated as criminal suspects, or by [[court-martial]] as a prisoner under the [[Geneva Conventions]], which prohibit civilian trials for prisoners of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usmilitary.about.com/library/milinfo/genevacon/blart-84.htm|title=Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War (Article 84)|publisher=Usmilitary.about.com|date=June 19, 2010|accessdate=October 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mohammed could face the death penalty under any of these systems.

{{As of|2017}}, the case is progressing through the legal system.

== Legal rulings affecting him ==
In ''[[Boumediene v. Bush]]'' (2008), the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled that detainees had the right of access to US federal courts to petition under [[habeas corpus]] to challenge their detentions, and that the [[Detainee Treatment Act of 2005]] and the [[Military Commissions Act of 2006]] were flawed. A revised [[Military Commissions Act of 2009|Military Commissions Act]] was passed by Congress in 2009 to address court concerns.

== Release of new images ==

Journalists and [[VIP]]s visiting Guantanamo are not allowed to take any pictures that show the captives' faces. Journalists may see "[[high value detainees|high value]]" captives such as Khalid Sheikh Mohammed only when they are in the court room, where cameras are not allowed. But, on September 9, 2009, independent counter-terrorism researchers found new images of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and his nephew Ammar al Baluchi on "jihadist websites".  According to [[Carol Rosenberg]], writing in ''[[The Miami Herald]]'': "The pictures were taken in July, said [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] spokesman Bernard Barrett, under an agreement with prison camp staff that lets Red Cross delegates photograph detainees and send photos to family members."&lt;ref name="photos"/&gt;

==Khalid Sheikh Mohammad and Sulaiman Abu Ghaith==
Khalid Sheikh Mohammad has participated as a witness in the trials of two alleged al-Qaeda members, [[Zacarias Moussaoui]] and [[Salim Hamdan]].  LA Times reporter Richard Serrano wrote:

"In 2006, his interrogation summaries were read aloud in the capital murder trial of Zacarias Moussaoui, the so-called 20th hijacker, and Moussaoui was spared the death penalty. Two years later, different Mohammed statements were read in a military commission trial, or tribunal, that led to the release from Guantanamo Bay of Osama bin Laden's chauffeur, Salim Hamdan."&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Richard A.

Stanly Cohen, an attorney for [[Sulaiman Abu Ghaith]], requested to interview Mohammad, who they described as "the most qualified person alive" to assist in Abu Gaith's defense. Mohammad, through his attorney David Nevin, agreed to be interviewed, but only "in the absence of government personnel whether physically present or by listening or recording remotely."&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com"/&gt;

Mohammed instead drafted a 14-page statement response to 451 interrogatories submitted by Cohen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Klasfeld|first=Adam|title=KSM Would Have Been a Dud in al-Qaida Case|url=http://www.courthousenews.com/2014/04/22/67243.htm|publisher=Courthouse News Services|accessdate=May 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the response, Mohammad called Abu Ghaith, a "pious man" and "spellbinding speaker" who, to the best of his knowledge, did not play any military role in al-Qaeda operations and had no military training.  Mohammed argued that Western foreign policy has been hypocritical in that it allowed for the rise of the Mujahideen in the Soviet War, but that Western media has since branded the Mujahideen "terrorists" or "foreign fighters." He further claimed that the Taliban's strict Islamic rule had restored security to Afghanistan in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Worthington|first=Andy|title=From Guantánamo, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed's Declaration in the New York Trial of Sulaiman Abu Ghaith |url=http://www.andyworthington.co.uk/2014/03/18/from-guantanamo-khalid-sheikh-mohammeds-declaration-in-the-new-york-trial-of-sulaiman-abu-ghaith/|publisher=Author|accessdate=May 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  U.S. District Judge [[Lewis A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27873">A '''look-alike''', '''double''', or '''[[doppelgänger]]''' is a person who closely resembles another person in appearance.

Celebrity look-alikes—those who resemble well-known entertainers, politicians, and other public figures—can work as entertainers themselves, impersonating their targets in a variety of venues, including [[film|movies]], [[television]], [[stage (theatre)|stage shows]], [[party|parties]], and [[Corporate entertainment|corporate functions]]. These professional look-alikes are often represented by talent agencies that specialize in celebrity [[impersonator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Tsar Nicholas II &amp; King George V.JPG|thumb|250px|Cousins [[Tsar Nicholas II]] ''(left)'' and King [[George V]] in German military uniforms, [[Berlin]], before [[World War I]]]]
* Cousins, [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s King [[George V]] (1865–1936) and [[Russia]]'s [[Tsar Nicholas II]] (1868–1918), shared an uncanny resemblance.  Their facial features were only different up close.  At King George's wedding in 1893, according to ''[[The Times]]'' of [[London]],  the crowd may have confused Nicholas with George, because their beards and dress made them look alike.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' (London), Friday, 7 July 1893, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mikheil Gelovani]], a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] actor and [[Joseph Stalin]] look-alike, played the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] leader in propaganda films of the 1930s and 1940s. In 2008, 88-year-old Felix Dadaev, a former dancer and [[juggler]], disclosed that he had been one of four look-alikes whom Stalin had employed as decoys to mislead enemies and potential [[assassination|assassins]] (there in fact were attempts on Stalin's life—two at [[Yalta Conference|Yalta]] alone).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/worldnews.html?in_article_id=559234&amp;in_page_id=1811 |title=The Man Who Was Stalin's Body Double Finally Tells His Story |author=Will Stewart |date=April 12, 2008 |work=Mail Online |accessdate=3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 1944, shortly before [[D-Day]], [[M. E. Clifton James]], who bore a close resemblance to [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery]], was sent to [[Gibraltar]] and [[North Africa]], in order to deceive the Germans about the location of the upcoming invasion. This story was the subject of a book and film, ''[[I Was Monty's Double]]''.
* [[Paul is dead|A notable conspiracy theory]] holds that [[Paul McCartney]] died in 1966 and was replaced by a [[Canadians|Canadian]] policeman named William Shears Campbell.
* In the 1970s, actor-comedian Richard M. Dixon (born James LaRoe), look-alike to then-President [[Richard Nixon]], gained some celebrity, portraying the president in the films, ''Richard'' (1972) and ''The Faking of the President'' (1976). He also appeared in director [[Woody Allen]]`s initially unreleased [[short film]] ''[[Men of Crisis: The Harvey Wallinger Story]]'' (1971).
* [[Jeannette Charles]] has, since the early 1970s, worked as a look-alike to Britain's [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]].
* [[Saddam Hussein]] allegedly employed several [[political decoys|look-alikes for political purposes]] during his [[Iraq]] reign. According to a [[CBS]] ''[[60 Minutes]]'' segment in late January 2008, Saddam Hussein denied to an American interrogator that he had employed doubles.
* The [[BBC]] comedy programme ''[[Doubletake (TV show)|Doubletake]]'' made extensive use of look-alikes playing their doubles in apparently embarrassing situations, seen through [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] cameras and amateur video, using distance shots and shaky camera-work to disguise the true identity of those being filmed. Due to the nature of this programme and conditions of filming, many of the world's most authentic lookalikes boycotted the project leaving the producer to rely on the careful use of soft focus, lighting and carefully positioned camera angles to make the mainly amateur lookalikes resemble the characters they portrayed.
* [[Armando Iannucci]]'s ''[[Friday Night Armistice]]'' (1996–98) featured "the bus of Dianas", a bus full of [[Princess Diana]] look-alikes which was dispatched to "care" at the sites of various minor tragedies.
* Steve Sires, a look-alike of [[Microsoft]]'s [[Bill Gates]], came to attention when he attempted to trademark "Microsortof", and subsequently acted in Microsoft commercials. He appeared as Gates in the 2002 film, ''[[Nothing So Strange]]'' and the 2010 film, ''[[The Social Network]]''.
* UK ''[[Celebrity Big Brother (UK TV series)|Celebrity Big Brother]]'' contestant [[Chantelle Houghton]] worked briefly and unsuccessfully for a look-alike agency as a [[Paris Hilton]] look-alike, earning the nickname "Paris [[Travelodge]]". By the time Chantelle Houghton won [[Celebrity Big Brother 4 (UK)|series 4]] of ''Celebrity Big Brother'', the same agency had already signed up a professional model who made a more convincing Paris Hilton look-alike... and who was briefly also offered as a fake "Chantelle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/jan/29/broadcasting.bigbrother |title=From Nobody Much to Someone Special |author=Lucy Rock |date=January 29, 2006 |work=The Observer |accessdate=3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* UK ''[[Richard and Judy]]'' ran a competition for Little Britain Lookalikes in 2005. After the live final broadcast on Friday, 28 January 2005, on [[Channel Four]], two winning contestants, Gavin Pomfret and Stuart Morrison, formed a Little Britain tribute act called "Littler Britain."
* [[Dolly Parton]] has stated that she lost a 'Dolly Parton Look-Alike Contest'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aoltv.com/2011/03/25/dolly-parton-lost-dolly-parton-look-a-like-contest/ |title=Dolly Parton Explains How She Lost Dolly Parton Look-a-Like Contest (VIDEO) |publisher=Aoltv.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2008 a friend pointed out to [[Bronx]] native [[Louis Ortiz]] his striking resemblance to then-presidential-candidate [[Barack Obama]].  Ortiz, initially as a money-making venture, sought gigs as an Obama [[impersonator]].  Ryan Murdock is making a documentary film about his experiences, ''The Audacity of Louis Ortiz''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/458/play-the-part |title=This American Life from WBEZ, 458: "Play the Part," originally aired 2012-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Two of the [[Parti Québécois]]'s candidates: [[Bertrand St-Arnaud]] and [[Bernard Drainville]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-votes-2014/can-you-tell-bernard-drainville-and-bertrand-st-arnaud-apart-1.2597069|title=Can you tell Bernard Drainville and Bertrand St-Arnaud apart?|date=April 3, 2014|work=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Larissa Tudor]] looked strikingly similar to former [[Grand Duchess Tatiana of Russia]]. Larissa's background was sketchy and included a lot of irregularities. After her death in 1926 it was rumored that she was the former grand duchess. When author Occleshaw wrote a book about Larissa 60 years after her death, those who had known her identified a picture of the former Grand Duchess Tatiana as being Larissa.

== Literature ==
* In [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s short story [[William Wilson (short story)|"William Wilson"]] (1839), a man is followed by his double.
* [[Alexandre Dumas, père]]'s, ''[[The Vicomte of Bragelonne: Ten Years Later#Part Three: The Man in the Iron Mask (Chapters 181–269)|The Man in the Iron Mask]]'' (1850—the third part of Dumas' novel, ''[[The Vicomte de Bragelonne]]'') involves King [[Louis XIV of France]] and the King's [[identical twin]].
* In [[Charles Dickens]]' novel ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' (1859), two characters, [[Charles Darnay]] and [[Sydney Carton]], bear an uncanny resemblance to one another.
* In ''[[The Woman in White (novel)|The Woman in White]]'' (1859), by [[Wilkie Collins]], the protagonist meets two women, Anne Catherick and Laura Fairlie, who strongly resemble one another. The villain of the story, Count Fosco, uses this resemblance to steal Laura Fairlie's fortune.  (See also Wilkie Collins' ''The Woman in White'' in "[[Illegitimacy in fiction#Victorian|Illegitimacy in fiction:  Victorian]]".)
* In [[Mark Twain]]'s first [[historical fiction]] (1882), the novel ''[[The Prince and the Pauper]]'', [[Edward VI of England|Prince Edward]], son of [[Henry VIII of England]], and his pauper look-alike, Tom Canty, trade places.
* In [[Anthony Hope]]'s novel ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda]]'' (1894), a man [[impersonate]]s a king he closely resembles, after the king is abducted on the eve of his coronation.
* [[Bolesław Prus]]' [[historical novel]] ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'' (1895) features several cases of look-alikes. The characters include the [[Haran]]ian Phut ([[Aka (initialism)|aka]] the [[Chaldea]]n priest Berossus) and his look-alike (chapter 20), and the [[protagonist]] Ramses and his look-alike and [[archenemy|nemesis]], Lykon. Also, chapter 33 makes reference to look-alikes of an earlier [[pharaoh]], [[Ramses the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', translated from the Polish by [[Christopher Kasparek]], 2nd, revised ed., Warsaw, Polestar Publications, {{ISBN|83-88177-01-X}}, and New York, Hippocrene Books, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Georg Kaiser]]'s 1917 play ''The Coral'' depicts a powerful industrialist whose male secretary is his exact double. The secretary's duties include impersonating his employer at public functions. Other employees can tell the two men apart only by the fact that the secretary always wears a coral watch-fob.
* ''[[The Living and the Dead (Boileau-Narcejac novel)|The Living and the Dead]]'', 1954 novel by collaborators [[Boileau-Narcejac]], on which [[Alfred Hitchcock]] based his 1958 film ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]''.
* In [[Robert A. Heinlein|Robert Heinlein's]] novel ''[[Double Star]]'' (1956), actor Lawrence Smith is approached to impersonate prominent politician John Joseph Bonforte, who has been kidnapped, despite his antipathy toward Bonforte's policies. In studying the man to perfect his imposture, Smith eventually comes to admire Bonforte. He continues this performance through an election and, when Bonforte dies, the subsequent tenure in office as "Supreme Minister." This story parallels that of the film [[Dave (film)|Dave]], but in this case when the actual politician dies, and Bonforte's staff begins to suggest shifts in policy contrary to Bonforte's beliefs, Smith refuses to submit to their desires, removes them from their positions, and continues in the role for the rest of his life, in honor of Bonforte's legacy.
* In [[Daphne du Maurier]]'s novel ''[[The Scapegoat (Daphne du Maurier)|The Scapegoat]]'' (1957), an Englishman meets his double, a French aristocrat, while visiting France, and is forced into changing places with him, finding himself caught up in all the intrigues and passions of his double's complex family.
* In [[Richard P. Powell|Richard Powell's]] novel ''Don Quixote, U.S.A.'' (1966), Arthur Peabody Goodpasture, an inept [[Peace Corps]] volunteer and the spitting image of El Gavilan, a revolutionary leader in the fictional Republic of San Marco in South America, is forced to assume the identity of El Gavilan after the original is kidnapped and taken to the Soviet Union when El Gavilan's plot to have Goodpasture abducted by the Russians goes wrong.
* In [[Jack Higgins]]'s 1975 novel ''[[The Eagle Has Landed (novel)|The Eagle Has Landed]]'', [[Nazi German]] [[paratrooper]]s attempt to abduct British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] from an English village he is visiting. It subsequently transpires that the actual Churchill had been elsewhere while a [[political decoy]] visited the village.
* ''"The Leader and the Damned"'' (1983) by [[Colin Forbes (novelist)|Colin Forbes]] is a [[secret history]] thriller whose plot is based on the assumption that [[Adolf Hitler]] was assassinated in 1943, a bomb completely destroying his body. The Nazi hierarchy kept this as a top secret and got a double to impersonate Hitler, and it was this double who led Nazi Germany until its final demise in 1945.
* In [[Clive Cussler]]'s 1984 novel ''[[Deep Six (novel)|Deep Six]]'', a [[body double|double]] is used after the U.S. president is kidnapped by Korean and Soviet agents.
* [[Christopher Priest (novelist)|Christopher Priest]]'s novel ''[[The Prestige]]'' (1995) features two rival [[illusionist|magicians]], one of whom uses his twin brother as a [[Body double|double]] in a disappearing-and-reappearing act.

'''Meyrick Edward Clifton James''' (April 1898 – 8 May 1963) was an actor and soldier, with a [[Look-alike|resemblance]] to [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery]]. This was used by [[MI5|British intelligence]] as part of a deception campaign during the [[World War II|Second World War]].

==Early life==
Clifton James was born in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Western Australia]], the youngest son of notable Australian public servant [[John Charles Horsey James]] and his wife Rebecca Catherine Clifton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A040530b.htm |title=James, John Charles Horsey |work=Australian Dictionary of Biography |accessdate= 13 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://members.iinet.net.au/~perthdps/graves/bio-29.htm#e  |title=East Perth Cemeteries |work=Bicentennial Dictionary of Western Australians: pre-1829–1888 |first=R. |last=Erickson |year=1988 |volume=2 |page=1618 |accessdate=1 Apr 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After serving in the [[Royal Fusiliers]] during the [[World War I|First World War]], and seeing action at the [[Battle of the Somme]], he took up acting, "starting at 15 shillings weekly with [[Fred Karno]], who put [[Charlie Chaplin|Chaplin]] on the road to fame."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Swainson |first=Leslie |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=iTpVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=eZUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6357,3788325&amp;dq=clifton-james&amp;hl=en |title=No Clash of Arms in War Film |newspaper=The Age |location=Melbourne, Australia |date=27 August 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]] he volunteered his services to the [[British Army]] as an entertainer. Instead of being assigned to [[Entertainments National Service Association|ENSA]] as he had hoped, on 11 July 1940 James was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] in the [[Royal Army Pay Corps]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=34905 |date=23 July 1940 |page=4595 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually posted to [[Leicester]]. Here, his acting seemed to be limited to his membership of the Pay Corps Drama and Variety Group. In 1944 his resemblance to Montgomery was spotted, and he was employed to pretend to be the general as part of a campaign designed to deceive the Germans in the lead-up to [[Normandy landings|D-Day]].

==Operation Copperhead==
{{main|Operation Copperhead}}
About seven weeks before [[D-Day]] in 1944, [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] J V B Jervis-Reid noticed James's resemblance to Montgomery while he was reviewing photographs in a newspaper. James, it seemed, had 'rescued' a failing patriotic show by appearing in it, quite briefly, as 'Monty'. [[MI5]] decided to exploit the resemblance to confuse German intelligence. James was contacted by Lieutenant-Colonel [[David Niven]], who worked for the Army's film unit, and was asked to come to London on the pretext of making a film.

When Niven explained that it was about something different, James supposedly burst into tears because he thought he had been exposed as a bigamist, who was receiving a double marriage allowance. Like many of Niven's anecdotes, this one is viewed with scepticism.&lt;ref name="Lord"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lord|first=Graham|title=Niv: The Authorized Biography of David Niven|publisher=Orion Books|year=2003|location= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ruse was part of a wider deception which aimed to divert troops from [[Northern France]], by convincing the Germans that an Allied invasion of [[Southern France]] ([[Operation Dragoon]]) would precede a northern invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aia.lackland.af.mil/homepages/pa/spokesman/Jan05/atc10.cfm|title=The impersonation of General Montgomery|first=Dr Dennis|last=Casey|publisher=Air Intelligence Agency|accessdate=13 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan was code-named [[Operation Copperhead|Operation ''Copperhead'']] and James was assigned to Montgomery's staff to learn his speech and mannerisms. Despite the problems that he had with alcohol (Montgomery was teetotal), and the differences in personality, the project continued. He also had to give up smoking. Clifton James had lost his right-hand middle finger in the [[First World War]] and so a prosthetic finger was made.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

On 25 May 1944, James flew from [[RAF Northolt]] to [[Gibraltar]] on-board [[Winston Churchill|Churchill's]] private aircraft. During a reception at the [[Governor of Gibraltar|Governor-General]]'s house, hints were made about "Plan 303", a plan to invade [[Southern France]]. German intelligence picked this up and ordered agents to find out what they could about "Plan 303". James then flew to [[Algiers]] where over the next few days he made a round of public appearances with [[Henry Maitland Wilson, 1st Baron Wilson|General Maitland Wilson]], the Allied commander in the [[Mediterranean]] theatre. He was then secretly flown to [[Cairo]] where he stayed until the invasion in [[Normandy]] was well under way. He then returned to his job after an absence of five weeks.

Various reasons were put forward for the speedy conclusion of the operation (including the suggestion that James was seen in Gibraltar smoking and drunk), though the most likely explanation is the one put forward by [[Dennis Wheatley]] (who was part of the British deception efforts during the war) in ''The Deception Planners'' published in the 1980s. In it, he states that the operation was wound up successfully, its purpose accomplished. The effectiveness of the deception is hard to assess. According to captured enemy generals, German intelligence believed that it was Montgomery, though they still guessed that it was a feint.&lt;ref name="Lord"/&gt;

==Post-war life==
After being [[demobilise]]d in June 1946, he was unable to find theatrical employment and was obliged to apply for [[unemployment benefits]] to support his wife and two children in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article75085801|title=Monty's Double Broke|newspaper=[[The Northern Times]]|location=Carnarvon, Western Australia|date=4 April 1947|accessdate=11 May 2014|page=4|publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''I Was Monty's Double''==
In 1954, James published his exploits in a book entitled ''[[I Was Monty's Double]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=James|first=M. E. Clifton|title=I Was Monty's Double|publisher=Hamilton and Co.|year=1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; (released in the US as ''The Counterfeit General Montgomery''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=James|first=M. E. Clifton |title=The Counterfeit General Montgomery |publisher=Avon |location=New York |year=1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The book became the basis for the script of the [[I Was Monty's Double (film)|1958 film]] starring [[John Mills]] and [[Cecil Parker]] with James playing himself and Montgomery. The script was 'tweaked' for effect; 'Operation Copperhead' became 'Operation Hambone', and additional elements of comedy, danger and intrigue were added. James also appeared in a short cameo (and non-speaking) appearance as Field Marshal Montgomery in the 1957 film ''[[High Flight (film)|High Flight]]'', starring [[Ray Milland]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

On 20 January 1959, James appeared on an episode of the TV series ''[[To Tell the Truth]]''.

==Death==
James died on 8 May 1963 at his home on Thorn Road in [[Worthing]], [[Sussex]], aged 65.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Obituaries |day_of_week=Thursday |date=9 May 1963 |page_number=17 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', 15 May 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
[[New Year]] traditions and celebrations in [[Canada]] vary regionally. New Year's Eve (also called ''New Year's Eve Day'' or ''Veille du Jour de l'An'' in French) is generally a social holiday. In many cities, such as [[Toronto]], [[Ottawa]] and [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls]] in [[Ontario]], [[Edmonton]] and [[Calgary]] in [[Alberta]], [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] and [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], there are large celebrations which may feature concerts, late-night partying, sporting events, and fireworks, with free public transit service during peak party times in most major cities. In some areas, such as in rural Quebec, people [[Ice fishing|ice fish in the old days]]. Since 2000, the highlight of New Year's Eve celebrations is in Montreal's old port, which comes alive with concerts that take place and fireworks at midnight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/canada/new-year-eve|title=New Year's Eve in Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1956 to 1976, Guy Lombardo and his Royal Canadians serenaded Canada on the CBC, via a feed from CBS, from the ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel on Park Avenue in New York City. After Lombardo's death in 1977, the Royal Canadians continued on CBC and CBS until 1978.

In 1992, the sketch comedy troupe [[Royal Canadian Air Farce]] began airing its annual New Year's Eve special ''Year of the Farce'' on [[CBC Television]], which features sketches lampooning the major events and news stories of the year. The 1992 edition was presented as a one-off special, but served as a [[pilot episode|pilot]] for a [[Royal Canadian Air Farce (TV series)|regular Air Farce series]] that
premiered the following year, and ran until 2008. ''Year of the Farce'' episodes continued to air annually as part of the series, while the 2008 edition doubled as the program's [[series finale]]. One-off ''Year of the Farce'' specials have continued to air on New Year's Eve or New Year's Day since, featuring members of the original cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.torontosun.com/entertainment/tv/2010/12/16/16582916.html#/entertainment/tv/2010/12/16/pf-16582916.html |title='Air Farce' returns once again |author=Bill Harris |date=18 December 2010 |work=Toronto Sun |access-date=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sun-farcenye"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/entertainment/columnists/bill_harris/2009/12/18/12203461-qmi.html|title=Farce back for New Year's Eve|last=Harris|first=Bill|date=18 December 2009|work=Toronto Sun|access-date=29 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the CBC's [[French language]] network [[Ici Radio-Canada Télé]] airs its own yearly New Year's Eve comedy special, ''[[Bye Bye (TV series)|Bye Bye]]''. Unlike ''Year of the Farce'', ''Bye Bye'' has been presented by various comedians; originally running from 1968 to 1998, it was revived in 2006 by the Québécois troupe [[Rock et Belles Oreilles]]. Its 2008 edition, hosted and co-produced by Québécois television personality [[Véronique Cloutier]], was criticized for featuring sketches that viewers perceived as offensive, including sketches making fun of English Canadians and then American [[president-elect]] [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.cbc.ca/arts/tv/story/2009/01/09/mtl-cloutier-byebye-0901.html Producers apologize for offensive skits in Quebec New Year's Eve special]'' on CBC.ca, 9 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several fireworks shows across the country. Over one million spectators attend the most popular, the "Año Nuevo en el Mar", in [[Valparaiso]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cooperativa.cl/un-millon-de-personas-disfruto-del-ano-nuevo-en-el-mar-en-valparaiso/prontus_nots/2011-01-01/084745.html|title=Un millón de personas disfrutó del "Año Nuevo en el Mar" en Valparaíso}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2000, the sale of fireworks to individuals has been illegal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=169320|title=Ley 19680: Prohíbe el uso de fuegos artificiales, mediante reforma de la Ley Nº 17.798, sobre control de armas y explosivos, y prohíbe la venta al público de fuegos artificiales y regula la realización de espectáculos pirotécnicos masivos}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning fireworks can now only be observed at major displays.

===Ecuador===
A New Year's Eve tradition in [[Ecuador]] is for men to dress haphazardly in drag (clowny looking make-up, cheap colorful wigs, very hairy legs in miniskirts) for New Year's Eve representing the "widow" of the year that has passed. The "widows" then go to the streets and stop each car that passes on that particular street in order to parody some form of sexy dancing. Large crowds would gather around to watch and laugh at the entertainment and the drivers are forced to give the "widows" some coins in order to obtain passage through the street.

There are also traditional family events and meals and modern celebrations such as hosting parties and going to nightclubs. People usually eat grapes and drink Champagne with close family members and friends.

The main event takes place at midnight where fireworks are lit along with thousands of life-size effigies called "Año Viejo". Most every local family creates the effigy from paper scraps, old clothes or purchases it altogether. They place just outside the front of their home. The effigy represents things you disliked from the previous year and are made to look like famous celebrities, politicians, public servants, cartoons, etc. They are burnt right at midnight to shed the old year and represent a new beginning. Some of the braver Ecuadorians jump through these burning effigies 12 times to represent a wish for every month.

===Guatemala===
In [[Guatemala]], banks close on New Year's Eve, and businesses close at noon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atozworldtravel.com/worldtravel2_country.asp?nid=20.17&amp;next_nid=20.18&amp;cid=58&amp;parent=Society%20and%20Culture#NewYearsDay |title=Guatemala: Society and Culture / Holidays and Festivals |publisher=Atozworldtravel.com |accessdate=31 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the town of [[Antigua Guatemala|Antigua]], people usually gather at the Santa Catalina Clock Arch to celebrate New Year's Eve ({{lang-es|Fin del Año}}).

===Mexico===
Mexicans celebrate New Year's Eve, (Spanish: ''Vispera de Año Nuevo'') by eating a grape with each of the twelve chimes of a clock's bell during the midnight countdown, while making a wish with each one. Mexican families decorate homes and parties in colors that represent wishes for the upcoming year: red encourages an overall improvement of lifestyle and love, yellow encourages blessings of improved employment conditions, green for improved financial circumstances, and white for improved health. Mexican sweet bread is baked with a coin or charm hidden in the dough. When the bread is served, the recipient of the slice with the coin or charm is said to be blessed with good luck in the New Year. Another tradition is to make a list of all the bad or unhappy events over the past 12 months; before midnight, this list is thrown into a fire, symbolizing the removal of negative energy from the new year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topics-mag.com|title=TOPICS Online Magazine - ESL/EFL - Sandy Peters and Thomas Peters|publisher=|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, they are expressed for all the good things during the year that is ending so that they will continue in the new year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.focusonmexico.com/Mexican_customs_for_the_New_Year.html |title=Mexican customs for the New Year |publisher=Focus on Mexico |access-date=31 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711014410/http://www.focusonmexico.com/Mexican_customs_for_the_New_Year.html |archivedate=11 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. media coverage of New Year's Eve festivities have historically been centered on New York City; in 1929, [[Guy Lombardo]] and the Royal Canadians' began to hold an annual New Year's Eve [[Big band remote|radio broadcast]] from the [[The Roosevelt Hotel (Manhattan)|Roosevelt Hotel]]. They were well known for the [[big band|band]]'s signature performance of "[[Auld Lang Syne]]" at midnight, which helped make the [[Traditional pop music|standard]] synonymous with the New Year's holiday. The broadcast moved to [[CBS]] television from 1956 to 1976, adding coverage of the ball drop, and moved to the [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf-Astoria]] ballroom in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/12/31/archives/while-guy-lombardo-rings-out-the-old.html|title=While Guy Lombardo Rims Out the Old…|last=Wilson|first=John S.|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-11-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Lynch |first=Stephen |title=New Year's song remains ingrained in public mind |url=http://www.augustachronicle.com/stories/123199/cy2_124-4983.shtml |newspaper=[[The Orange County Register]] |date=31 December 1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050426133815/http://www.augustachronicle.com/stories/123199/cy2_124-4983.shtml |archivedate=26 April 2005 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ppg-Lombardo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/tv/20011226guy1226p6.asp|title=Next week to be 25th New Year's Eve without Guy Lombardo|accessdate=1 January 2007|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|first=Frazier|last=Moore|date=26 December 2001|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Lombaro's death, [[Dick Clark]]'s ''[[Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve|New Year's Rockin' Eve]]'' (which premiered for 1973 on [[NBC]], and moved to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] for 1975) became the dominant New Year's Eve [[television special|special]] on U.S. television (especially among younger viewers), with Clark hosting it (as well as [[ABC 2000 Today|ABC's special coverage of the year 2000]]) for 33 straight years.

====Religious observances====
In the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], 1 January is a [[solemnity]] honoring the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], the Mother of Jesus; it is a [[Holy Day of Obligation]] in most countries ([[Australia]] being a notable exception), thus the Church requires the attendance of all Catholics in such countries for [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] that day. However a vigil Mass may be held on the evening before a Holy Day; thus it has become customary to celebrate Mass on the evening of New Year's Eve. (New Year's Eve is a [[Silvester|feast day]] honoring [[Pope Sylvester I]] in the Roman Catholic calendar, but it is not widely recognized in the United States.)

Many Christian congregations have New Year's Eve [[watchnight service]]s. Some, especially [[Lutheran]]s and [[Methodist]]s and those in the [[Black church|African American community]], have a tradition known as "Watch Night", in which the faithful congregate in services continuing past midnight, giving thanks for the blessings of the outgoing year and praying for divine favor during the upcoming year. In the English-speaking world, Watch Night can be traced back to [[John Wesley]], the founder of Methodism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interpretermagazine.org/interior.asp?ptid=43&amp;mid=11612|title=Watch Night services provide spiritual way to bring in New Year|publisher=The United Methodist Church Interpreter Magazine|date=November–December 2006|last=Butler|first=Joey|accessdate=10 January 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301064835/http://www.interpretermagazine.org/interior.asp?ptid=43&amp;mid=11612|archivedate=1 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; who learned the custom from the [[Moravian Brethren]] who came to England in the 1730s. Moravian congregations still observe the Watch Night service on New Year's Eve. Watch Night took on special significance to African Americans on New Year's Eve 1862, as slaves anticipated the arrival of 1 January 1863, when [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] had announced he would sign the [[Emancipation Proclamation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wsbrec.org/blackfacts/WatchNight.htm |title=Watch Night |publisher=Western States Black Research &amp; Educational Center |date=August 2004 |last=Sutton |first=Charyn |accessdate=10 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614065235/http://www.wsbrec.org/blackfacts/WatchNight.htm |archivedate=14 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Caracas]], the bells of the Cathedral of Caracas ring twelve times.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During these special programs, is a tradition to broadcast songs about the end of the year. It is a non-working holiday. Popular songs include "Viejo año" ("Old year"), by [[Gaita Zuliana|Gaita]] group [[Maracaibo 15]], and "Cinco pa' las 12" ("Five minutes before twelve"), which was versioned by several popular singers including Nestor Zavarce, Nancy Ramos and [[José Luis Rodríguez El Puma]]. The unofficial hymn for the first minutes of the New Year is "Año Nuevo, Vida Nueva" ("New Year, New Life"), by the band Billo's Caracas Boys. Many people play the national anthem in their houses.

For the arrival of 2013, the [[Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre]] initiated the countdown, while the fireworks display and A Symphony of Lights show were extended to eight minutes.

Shopping malls are often major celebration venues. The [[Times Square (Hong Kong)|Times Square]] shopping mall, for instance, holds their own celebration of the ball drop held at [[Times Square]], [[New York City]]. There are also various district-wide celebrations.

====Taiwan====

The most prominent New Year's event in [[Taiwan]] is a major fireworks show launched from the [[Taipei 101]] skyscraper in [[Taipei]]. In 2018, the show was enhanced by the installation of a new LED display system on the north face of the tower between its 35th and 90th floors, which can be used to display digital animation effects. This change countered a reduction in the number of firework shells launched during the show, as part of an effort to produce less pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3329936|title=Xiangshan good for watching Taipei 101 fireworks display but not for light show: GEO|work=Taiwan News|access-date=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201712140017.aspx|title=Taipei 101 New Year's Eve fireworks display to be longest ever|work=Focus Taiwan|access-date=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central Asia===
In [[Central Asia]], New Year's Eve celebrations were inherited from Soviet traditions; thus they are similar to those of Russia. An example of such traditions would be the playing of the national anthem at midnight and the presidential address before it.

===Japan===
{{Main|Ōmisoka}}
[[File:Tokyo Tower in New Year's Eve 2012.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Tokyo Tower on New Year's Eve, 2012]]
In [[Japan]], New Year's Eve is used to prepare for and welcome ''Toshigami'' (年神), the New Year's god. People clean their home and prepare [[Kadomatsu]] or [[Shimenawa]] to welcome the god before New Year's Eve. Buddhist temples ring their bells 108 times&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; at midnight in the tradition ''Joya no Kane'' (除夜の鐘). The rings represent the 108 elements of ''[[Kleshas (Buddhism)|bonō]]'' (煩悩), mental states that lead people to take unwholesome actions.

In most cities and urban areas across Japan, New Year's Eve celebrations are usually accompanied by concerts, countdowns, fireworks and other events. In [[Tokyo]], the two most crowded celebrations are held at the Shibuya crossing in [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]] and the [[Zōjō-ji|Zojoji Temple]] in [[Minato, Tokyo|Minato]]. People gather around the Zojoji Temple to release helium balloons with New Year's wishes up in the sky and watch the lighting of [[Tokyo Tower]] and [[Tokyo Skytree]] with a year number displayed on the observatory at the stroke of midnight.

Three notable music-oriented television specials air near New Year's Eve. Since 1951, [[NHK]] has traditionally broadcast ''[[Kōhaku Uta Gassen]]'' (''Red and White Song Battle'') on New Year's Eve, a music competition where two teams of popular musicians (the red and white teams, which predominantly contain female and male performers respectively) perform songs, with the winning team determined by a panel of judges and viewer votes. The special is traditionally one of the most-watched television programs of the year in Japan. Although it did air on 31 December from 1959 to 2006, the [[Japan Record Award]]s ceremony, recognizing outstanding achievements in the [[Music of Japan|Japanese music industry]], is held annually on 30 December since 2007 and is broadcast by [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]]. Since 1996, artists from [[Johnny &amp; Associates]] perform a special concert titled ''Johnny's Countdown'' at the [[Tokyo Dome]] and is broadcast live by [[Fuji Television|Fuji TV]] every 31 December.

===Korea===
There are two New Years celebrated in both [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]], which are Lunar New Year and Solar New Year. The Solar New Year are always celebrated on the first day of January while Lunar New Year varies. Sometimes there are some traits that both North and South Korea celebrate, while some traits are celebrated differently or only on one side.

In both Koreas, they call New Year's Day 설날 (Seoll-Nal). They eat a special soup called 떡국 (Tteok-Guk) which is a hot soup with thin, flat rice cakes and most of the times, eggs are inserted. The Koreans believe that one would get to earn one age if you eat the soup on New Year's Day. They say if one dares to not eat the soup on New Year's Day, then he or she will lose luck.

Most cities and urban areas in both Koreas host New Year's Eve gatherings. In South Korea, two of the biggest celebrations take place in [[Seoul]]: the ringing of [[Bosingak]] bell 33 times at midnight and fireworks display at [[Myeong-dong]], and an LED laser light show and fireworks display at the [[Lotte World Tower]] in [[Songpa District|Songpa-gu]]. In [[Pyongyang]], North Korea, the chimes of the clock at the Grand People's Study House and fireworks display along [[Kim Il-sung Square]], [[Juche Tower]] and the surrounding areas signal the start of the New Year. The celebration in Pyongyang, however, also marks the beginning of the [[North Korean calendar]] or the Juche Year, which is based on 15 April 1912, [[Kim Il-sung]]'s date of birth.

===Mongolia===
Mongolians began celebrating the Gregorian New Year in the Socialist period, with influence from the former Soviet Union. As a modern tradition, New Year's Eve as well as New Year's Day are public holidays, and are two of the biggest holidays of the year. They celebrate New Year's Eve with their family. It is common, just like in the former Soviet Union, that the [[National Anthem of Mongolia]] is to be played at the midnight hour on television.

===Pakistan===
New Year's Eve is usually celebrated with fireworks in big cities (e.g. [[Lahore]], [[Karachi]] and [[Islamabad]]). Musical nights and concerts are also held.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Families enjoy a traditional dish called [[Biryani]].&lt;ref name="pakistan new years"&gt;{{cite news|title=New Year's Celebration in Pakistan|url=http://dailypakistan.com.pk/daily-bites/01-Jan-2017/502142|agency=Daily Pakistan|date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippines===
In the [[Philippines]], New Year's Eve (''Bisperas ng Bagong Taon'') is a special non-working holiday. [[Filipino people|Filipinos]] usually celebrate New Year's Eve in the company of family or close friends. Traditionally, most households host or attend a midnight feast called the ''Media Noche''. Typical dishes included holiday fare, ''[[pancit]]'' (for long life) and ''[[ham]]ón''. ''[[Lechon]]'' (roasted pig), is usually prepared, as is barbecued food. Some refrain from serving chicken, as their scratching and pecking for food is unlucky, being an idiom for a hand-to-mouth existence.

Many opt to wear new, bright, or colourful clothes with circular patterns, such as [[polka dot]]s, or display sweets and twelve round fruits as the centrepiece, in the belief that circles attract money and fortune and that candies represent a sweeter year ahead. Several customs must only be done at midnight: some throw about coins to increase wealth in the coming year, or jump to increase their height, while some follow the [[Spanish influence on Filipino culture|Spanish custom]] of eating twelve grapes, one for each month of the year. People also make loud noises by blowing on cardboard or plastic horns, called ''torotot'', banging on pots and pans, playing loud music, blowing car horns, or by igniting firecrackers, in the belief that the din scares away bad luck and evil spirits. [[Bamboo cannon]]s are also fired on the night in some places.

Urban areas usually host many New Year's Eve parties and countdown celebrations hosted by the private sector with the help of the local government. These parties, which include balls hosted by hotels, usually display their own fireworks and are often very well-attended. Some popular locations for celebrations include the area along [[Manila Bay]] at [[Roxas Boulevard]] or [[Luneta Park]] in [[Manila]], the intersection of Ayala and Makati Avenues in [[Makati City]], [[Resorts World Manila]] and [[SM Mall of Asia]] in [[Pasay City]], [[Quezon Memorial Circle]] in Diliman and [[Eastwood City]] in Libis, [[Quezon City]], [[Bonifacio Global City]] in [[Taguig City]], [[Entertainment City]] in [[Parañaque|Parañaque City]], and the [[Philippine Arena]] at [[Ciudad de Victoria]] in [[Bocaue, Bulacan|Bocaue]] and [[Santa Maria, Bulacan|Santa Maria]], [[Bulacan]].

[[File:The New Year Countdown. Venue Marina Bay, Singapore. Have a prosperous year ahead. Cheers! (3144588854).jpg|thumb|200px|right|The New Year countdown party in Singapore]]
The biggest New Year's Eve celebration in [[Singapore]] takes place in the [[Marina Bay, Singapore|Marina Bay]] area. It is attended by 250,000 or more people. The party spans around the bay area starting from the [[The Float at Marina Bay|Marina Bay floating Stadium]] to the Esplanade promenade, the [[Esplanade Bridge]], [[Benjamin Sheares Bridge]], [[Merlion Park]], and the [[Padang, Singapore|Padang]] at [[City Hall, Singapore|City Hall]] facing the Marina Bay. The celebrations are also visible from nearby hotels such as [[The Fullerton Hotel Singapore|The Fullerton Hotel]], [[Marina Mandarin Singapore|Marina Mandarin]], [[The Ritz-Carlton Millenia Singapore|The Ritz-Carlton Millenia]], [[Marina Bay Sands]], offices located at [[Raffles Place]], [[Marina Bay Financial Centre]], Residential Apartments at [[The Sail @ Marina Bay]], and from [[Singapore Flyer|The Singapore Flyer]]. On the waterfront of [[Marina Bay, Singapore|Marina Bay]], 20,000 inflatable "wishing spheres" carrying 500,000 wishes written by [[Singaporeans]] form a visual arts display filled with brilliant colors beamed from the spotlights erected along the Esplanade promenade open area. Audiences are also entertained by a host of variety shows and concerts staged at the Marina Bay floating platform stage, featuring local and overseas artists. The shows are viewable by all at the bay and telecast live on various [[television channel]]s in [[Republic of Singapore]], as well as internationally all over Southeast Asia through [[Channel News Asia]].

At one minute to midnight, the concert emcees initiate the final countdown together with the audience. When midnight arrives, fireworks are launched from the waters at Marina Bay, lighting up the whole bay against the backdrop of the [[Raffles Place|Singapore skyline]].

There are other countdown parties across Singapore; these include [[VivoCity]] and areas such as -
* Ang Mo Kio
* Bedok
* Boon Lay
* Bukit Panjang
* Jurong East
* Punggol
* Sengkang
* Serangoon Gardens
* Tampines
* Woodlands

===Thailand===
Aside from the traditional Thai New Year called ''[[Songkran (Thailand)]]'' (which falls on 13 April or 14 April), Thais also celebrate the arrival of the Gregorian New Year on 1 January with their families, relatives and friends, which includes a family dinner and following different customs. It is a public holiday. In most cities and urban areas across [[Thailand]], New Year's Eve celebrations are accompanied by countdowns, fireworks, concerts and other major events, notably, the CentralWorld Square at [[CentralWorld]] and the area along [[Chao Phraya River]] in [[Bangkok]], and the Pattaya Beach in [[Pattaya]], while public places such as hotels, pubs, restaurants and nightclubs, also host New Year's Eve parties by offering food, entertainment and music to the guests, and they usually stay open until the next morning.

==Europe==
===Albania===
Preparations for New Year's Eve in [[Albania]] start with the Christmas tree, which in Albania is known as "New Year's Tree" or "New Year's Pine".  At midnight, everyone toasts and greets each other and fireworks are lit.

===Austria===
In [[Austria]], New Year's Eve is usually celebrated with friends and family. At exactly midnight, all radio and television programmes operated by [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]] broadcast the sound of the [[Pummerin]], the bell of [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|St. Stephen's Cathedral]] in [[Vienna]], followed by the ''Donauwalzer'' ("[[The Blue Danube]]") by [[Johann Strauss II]]. Many people dance to this at parties or in the street. Large crowds gather in the streets of Vienna, where the municipal government organises a series of stages where bands and orchestras play. Fireworks are set off by both municipal governments and individuals.

===Belgium===
In [[Belgium]], New Year's Eve (''Sint Sylvester Vooravond'' ("Saint Sylvester's Eve") or ''Oudjaar'' ("old year")) is celebrated with family parties, called ''réveillons'' in the [[Wallonia|French speaking areas]]. On television, a stand-up comedian reviews the past year after which a musical or variety show signals midnight, when everyone kisses, exchanges good luck greetings, and toasts the New Year and absent relatives and friends with [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]]. Many people light fireworks or go into the street to watch them. Most cities have their own fireworks display: the most famous is at [[Mont des Arts]] in Brussels. Cities, cafés and restaurants are crowded. Free bus services and special New Year's Eve taxis (the ''Responsible Young Drivers'') bring everyone home afterwards.

On 1 January (''Nieuwjaarsdag'' in Dutch) children read their "New Year's letter" and give holiday greeting cards of decorated paper featuring golden cherubs and angels, colored roses and ribbon-tied garlands to parents and godparents, on decorated paper.

Belgian farmers also wish their animals a happy New Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tartanplace.com/newyear/newyrcustom/belgium.html|title=Belgian New Year: Sint Sylvester Vooranvond|author= Christine OKeeffe|publisher=|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
New Year is widely celebrated in [[Bosnia]] and [[Herzegovina]]. Streets are decorated for New Year's Eve and there is a fireworks show and concerts in all the larger cities. Restaurants, clubs, cafes and hotels are usually full of guests and they organize New Year's Eve parties.

In Sarajevo, people gather in the Square of children of Sarajevo where a local rock band entertains them. Several trumpet and rock groups play until the early morning hours. At midnight there is a big fireworks show.

===Czech Republic and Slovakia===
New Year's Eve (''Silvestr/Silvester'') celebrations and traditions in [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]] are very similar. New Year's Eve is the noisiest day of the year. People generally gather with friends at parties, in pubs, clubs, in the streets, or city squares to eat, drink, and celebrate the new year. Fireworks are a popular tradition; in large cities such as [[Bratislava]], or [[Prague]], the fireworks start before noon and steadily increase until midnight. In the first minutes after midnight, people toast with champagne, wish each other a happy new year, fortune and health, and go outside for the fireworks.

In both countries all major TV stations air entertainment shows before and after the midnight countdown, which is followed by the National anthem of each country. The Presidents of the republics gave their [[New Year speech]] in the morning - the new Czech President Miloš Zeman renewed the tradition of Christmas speeches. In recent years however the Czechoslovak national anthem is played at midnight, in honor of the shared history of both nations.

===Denmark===
[[File:CopenhagenNYE.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|New Year fireworks over [[Copenhagen]]]]
People in [[Denmark]] may go to parties or entertain guests at home. There is a special evening meal that concludes with [[Kransekage]], a special dessert, along with champagne. Other traditional dishes are boiled cod, stewed kale and cured saddle of pork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denmark-getaway.com/danish-traditions.html |title=Danish Traditions |publisher=Denmark-getaway.com |accessdate=31 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, expensive cuts of beef as well as sushi have become increasingly popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{da icon}} [http://ekstrabladet.dk/nationen/article1478388.ece Ekstra Bladet - Sushi hitter nytårsaften].

===Estonia===
To celebrate New Year's Eve in [[Estonia]], people decorate villages, visit friends and prepare lavish meals.

Some believe that people should eat seven, nine, or twelve times on New Year's Eve. These are lucky numbers in Estonia; it is believed that for each meal consumed, the person gains the strength of that many men the following year. Meals should not be completely finished—some food should be left for ancestors and spirits who visit the house on New Year's Eve.

Traditional New Year food includes pork with sauerkraut or Estonian sauerkraut (''mulgikapsad''), baked potatoes and swedes with hog's head, and white and blood sausage. Vegetarians can eat potato salad with navy beet{{clarify|date=January 2012}} and pâté. Gingerbread and marzipan are very popular for dessert. Traditional New Year drinks include beer and mead, but mulled wine and champagne have become modern favourites.

===Finland===
In [[Finland]], New Year's Eve is usually celebrated with family or friends. Late supper is served, often featuring wieners, [[Janssons frestelse]], and potato salad. Some municipalities organize fireworks at midnight. Consumer fireworks are also very popular. A Finnish tradition is [[molybdomancy]] - to tell the fortunes of the New Year by melting "tin" (actually lead) in a tiny pan on the stove and throwing it quickly in a bucket of cold water. The resulting blob of metal is analyzed, for example by interpreting shadows it casts by candlelight. These predictions are however never taken seriously.

The Finnish Broadcasting Company broadcasts the reception of the New Year at [[Helsinki Senate Square]]. Countdown to New Year is with the [[Helsinki Cathedral]] clock. In the afternoon programme, the German comedy sketch ''[[Dinner for One]]'' is shown every year. On the radio, just before midnight, the poem ''Hymyilevä Apollo'' (Smiling Apollo) by [[Eino Leino]] is read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/eleino.htm |title=Eino Leino |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305170013/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/eleino.htm |archivedate=5 March 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
[[File:Eiffel Tower on the New Year Eve at midnight.webm|thumb|(video) Celebrations in 2014]]
In [[France]], New Year's Eve (''la Saint-Sylvestre'') is usually celebrated with a feast, ''le Réveillon de la Saint-Sylvestre''&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.vibescout.com/fr/post/reveillon-du-nouvel le Réveillon de la Saint-Sylvestre]" .Vibescout.com. Retrieved 14 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt; (''Cap d'Any'' in [[Northern Catalonia]]). This feast customarily includes special dishes including [[foie gras]], seafood such as oysters, and [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]]. The celebration can be a simple, intimate dinner with friends and family or, ''une soirée dansante'', a much fancier ball.

On New Year's Day (''le Jour de l'An'') friends and family exchange [[New Year's resolutions]], kisses, and wishes. Some people eat [[ice cream]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/france/new-year-day|title=New Year's Day in France}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The holiday period ends on 6 January with the celebration of [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]] (''Jour des Rois''). A traditional type of flat pastry cake, ''la galette des rois'', made of two sheets of puff pastry, filled with ''frangipane'' (almond paste) is eaten. The cake contains a ''fève'', a small china doll; whomever finds it becomes king or queen and gets to wear a gold paper crown and choose his or her partner. This tradition can last up to two weeks.

===Germany===
In [[Germany]], parties are common on New Year's Eve. Fireworks are very popular, both with individuals and at large municipal displays. 31 December and the three days leading up to it are the only four days of the year on which fireworks may be sold in Germany. Every year [[Berlin]] hosts one of the largest New Year's Eve celebrations in all of Europe, attended by over a million people. The focal point is the [[Brandenburg Gate]], where midnight fireworks are centered. Germans toast the New Year with a glass of [[Sparkling wine#Sekt|Sekt]] (German sparkling wine) or champagne.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} [[Molybdomancy]] ''(Bleigießen)'' is another German New Year's Eve tradition, which involves telling fortunes by the shapes made by molten lead dropped into cold water. Other auspicious actions are to touch a chimney sweep or rub some ash on your forehead for good luck and health. Jam-filled doughnuts with and without liquor fillings are eaten. Finally a tiny [[marzipan pig]] is consumed for more good luck.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In some northern regions of Germany (e.g. [[East Frisia]]) the making of Speckdicken is another tradition - people go door to door visiting their neighbors and partaking in this dish. It looks similar to a pancake, but the recipe calls for either dark molasses or dark syrup, with summer sausage and bacon in the center.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Another notable tradition is the British comedy sketch ''[[Dinner for One]]'', which has traditionally been broadcast on German television on New Year's Eve since 1972. The version traditionally broadcast on German television was originally recorded in 1963, and was occasionally used as filler programming by [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]] due to popular demand; in 1972, ''Dinner for One'' received its traditional New Year's Eve scheduling. The sketch, as well as its catchphrase "the same procedure as every year", are well known in German pop culture. ''Dinner for One'' is also broadcast on or around New Year's Eve in other European countries, although it is, ironically, relatively unknown in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="slate-dinnerforone"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mystery of Dinner for One|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2005/12/the_mystery_of_dinner_for_one.html|website=Slate|accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/12/30/bvdinner30.xml | title = Gesundheit to an old favourite | author = Peake, Mike | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] |date= 30 December 2006 | accessdate = 1 January 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greece===
New Year's Eve in [[Greece]] has many traditions. During the day, children sing the New Year's carols to be given money or treats. Then, it is time to have family lunch or dinner. In the evening, people cook a pie named "King's pie (Vassilopita locally)", which is a cake flavored with almonds. Following tradition, they put a coin wrapped in aluminium foil inside the pie.

During the family dinner, the hostess puts some of her jewelry in a plate and serves it in the side of the table, as a symbol of the coming year's prosperity.
After the dinner is over, the dishes are not washed until the next day. The reason for that is that Saint Vassilis (Greek Santa Claus) is awaited during the New Year's Eve and it is considered common courtesy to leave some food for the traveler who visits the house to bring the presents during the night.

When midnight arrives, the families count down and then they turn off all the lights and reopen their eyes to "enter the year with a new light". After the fireworks show, they cut the "Vassilopita" and serve it. The person that gets the wrapped coin is the lucky person of the day and he is also blessed for the rest of the year. Gifts exchanges may follow.

===Hungary===
[[File:Szilveszter 2017.png|thumb|Midnight - Millenáris, NYE 2017]]
New Year's Eve (''Szilveszter'') in Hungary is celebrated with home parties and street parties, including a gathering in downtown [[Budapest]]. Fireworks and firecrackers are popular. Champagne, wine and traditional Hungarian New Year dishes—frankfurter sausages with [[horseradish]], [[lentil soup]], fish, and roast pig—are consumed. The national anthem is commonly sung at midnight.

In past centuries, some Hungarians believed that animals were able to speak on New Year's Eve, and that onion skins sprinkled with salt could indicate a rainy month.

Hungarian Christian communities focus on celebrating Mass on both New Year's Eve and New Year's Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goeasteurope.about.com/od/hungary/p/New-Years-Eve-In-Budapest.htm|title=New Year's Eve in Budapest|author=Kerry Kubilius|work=About.com Travel|accessdate=31 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906010650/http://goeasteurope.about.com/od/hungary/p/New-Years-Eve-In-Budapest.htm|archivedate=6 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goeasteurope.about.com/od/hungary/a/New-Years-Eve-In-Hungary.htm|title=New Year's Eve in Hungary|author=Kerry Kubilius|work=About.com Travel|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iceland===
[[File:NewYearFireworks-Reykjavik.jpg|thumb|New Year fireworks over [[Reykjavík]], [[Iceland]]]]
Fireworks are very popular in [[Iceland]], particularly on New Year's Eve. Iceland's biggest New Year's Eve events are usually in and around the capital, [[Reykjavík]].

''[[Áramótaskaupið]]'' ("The New Year's comedy") is an annual Icelandic television comedy special, which is an important part of the New Year for most. It focuses satirically on the past year, and shows little mercy for its victims, especially politicians, artists, prominent business people and activists.

===Ireland===
New Year's Eve (''Oíche Chinn Bliana'', ''Oíche na Coda Móire'', or ''Oíche Chaille'') celebrations in major cities are modest, with most people favouring small parties in the home for family and friends.

===Italy===
In [[Italy]], New Year's Eve (''Vigilia di Capodanno'' or ''Notte di San Silvestro'') is celebrated by the observation of traditional rituals, such as wearing red [[underwear]]. An ancient tradition in southern regions which is rarely followed today was disposing of old or unused items by dropping them from the window.

Dinner is traditionally eaten with relatives and friends. It often includes [[zampone]] or [[cotechino]] (a meal made with [[pig's trotters]] or entrails), and lentils. At 20:30, the President reads a television message of greetings to Italians.

At midnight, fireworks are displayed all across the country. Rarely followed today is the tradition that consist in eating [[lentil]] stew when bell tolls midnight, one spoonful per bell. This is supposed to bring good fortune; the round lentils represent coins.

===Macedonia===
New Year's Eve is celebrated across [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. New Year's Day is celebrated by day-long fireworks shows. The day is celebrated together with family or friends at home or in restaurants, clubs, cafés and hotels. During the day-time celebration, children get gifts. Evening celebrations include food, music, and dancing to both traditional Macedonian folk music, and modern music. New Year's Eve is celebrated on 31 December and also on 14 January according to the Macedonian Orthodox Calendar.

===Malta===
[[Malta]] organized its first New Year's street party in 2009 in [[Floriana]]. The event was not highly advertised and proved controversial, due to the closing of an arterial street for the day. In 2010 there were the first national celebrations in [[St. George's Square]], [[Valletta]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maltanewyearseve.com |title=Official New Year's Eve Street Celebrations Website in Malta |publisher=Maltanewyearseve.com |accessdate=31 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206100908/http://www.maltanewyearseve.com/ |archivedate=6 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although professional fireworks are very popular in Malta, they are almost totally absent on New Year's Eve. Usually the Maltese hit nightclubs and specific dance music parties to celebrate New Year's Eve.

===Montenegro===
In [[Montenegro]], New Year's Eve celebrations are held in all large cities, usually accompanied by fireworks. It is usually celebrated with family or friends, at home or outside. Restaurants, clubs, cafés and hotels organize celebrations with food and music.

===Netherlands===
New Year's Eve (''Oud en Nieuw'' or ''Oudejaarsavond'') in the [[Netherlands]] is usually celebrated as a cozy evening with family or friends, although many people attend big organized parties. Traditional snack foods are ''[[oliebol]]len'' (oil dumplings) and ''appelbeignets'' (apple slice [[fritter]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/netherlands/new-year-day|title=New Year's Day in the Netherlands}}&lt;/ref&gt; On television, the main feature is the ''[[oudejaarsconference]]'', a performance by one of the major Dutch [[Kleinkunst|cabaretiers]] (comparable to [[stand-up comedy]], but more serious, generally including a satirical review of the year's politics). Historically, in [[Reformed churches|Reformed]] Protestant families, [[Psalm 90]] is read, although this tradition is now fading away.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archief.trouw.nl/artikel?REC=8fa40a69e540abe90713aeecf7c82e58 ''Wim Kan displaced Psalm 90 and prayer'', Trouw, 31 December 2001] {{nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; At midnight, [[mulled wine|Glühwein]] ''(bishops wine)'' or champagne is drunk. Many people light their own fireworks. Towns do not organize a central fireworks display, except for [[Rotterdam]] where the national fireworks display can be seen near the [[Erasmus Bridge]].

===Norway===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}
In [[Norway]] New Year's Eve (''Nyttårsaften'') is the second biggest celebration of the year, after [[Christmas Eve]]. While Christmas Eve is a family celebration, New Year's Eve is an opportunity to celebrate with friends.

Traditionally, there is first a feast, commonly consisting of stuffed, roast turkey with potatoes, sprouts, gravy and Waldorf salad. The accompanying beverage is traditionally beer (commonly either Christmas beer or lager beer). Dessert will often be vanilla pudding or rice cream, and there will be cakes and coffee later in the evening - commonly accompanied by a glass of cognac. Then, at close to 12 am on New Year's Day, people will go outside to send up fireworks. Fireworks are only permitted to be sold to the general public on the days leading up to New Year's Eve, and only to be launched that night.

Due to the general use of fireworks, more fires occur on New Year's Eve than on any other day of the year in Norway. Accordingly, most Norwegian cities, and many towns, host a large, public fireworks display in order to discourage private use of fireworks in built-up areas. People will then congregate in a central square or similar to watch and celebrate.

===Poland===
In [[Poland]] New Year's Eve (''Sylwester'') celebrations include both indoor and outdoor festivities. A large open-air concert is held in the [[Main Market Square, Kraków|Main Square]] in [[Kraków]]. 150,000 to 200,000 revelers celebrate the New Year with live music and a fireworks display over [[St. Mary's Basilica, Kraków|St. Mary's Basilica]].&lt;ref name="onet"&gt;{{cite web|last=Świerczek|first=Marcin|title=Tylko w Onet.tv - sylwester z krakowskiego Rynku na żywo!|publisher=[[Onet.tv]] from Polish Press Agency|location=[[Kraków]]|year=2008|url=http://muzyka.onet.pl/10172,1888447,newsy.html|accessdate=31 December 2010|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

For those who do not wish to spend the New Year in the city, the mountains are a popular destination. [[Zakopane]], located in the [[Carpathian Mountains]], is the most popular Polish mountain resort in winter.

Also, New Year's Eve (''Sylwester'') celebrations are in [[Katowice]], near the [[Spodek]] arena. In [[Sławatycze]], people tour the streets dressed up as bearded men.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/year-eve-celebrated-world-171228130120603.html|title=New Year's Eve 2017: How the world celebrates today|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portugal===
In [[Portugal]] the New Year celebration is taken very seriously. The tradition is to drink champagne and eat twelve raisins - one for each month of the year, making a wish for each. Another Portuguese tradition is a special cake called ''[[Bolo-Rei]]'' (literally: King Cake). ''Bolo-Rei'' is a round cake with a large hole in the centre, resembling a crown covered with crystallised and dried fruit. It is baked from a soft, white dough, with raisins, various nuts and crystallised fruit. Inside is hidden the characteristic ''fava'' ([[broad bean]]). Tradition dictates that whoever finds the ''fava'' has to pay for the ''Bolo-Rei'' next year. Initially, a small prize (usually a small metal toy) was also included within the cake. However, the inclusion of the prize was forbidden by the European Union for safety reasons. The Portuguese brought the recipe of the ''[[Gateau des Rois]]'' from France in the second half of the 19th century. To this day, this recipe is a very well kept secret.

In [[Lisbon]] the New Year is celebrated with a grand concert. The New Year's Concert is held at the CCB ([[Centro Cultural de Belém]]) on the evening of 1 January, featuring the prestigious Lisbon Metropolitan Orchestra.

===Romania===
[[File:Vanghelion.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Romexpo]] indoors during ''Vanghelion'' New Year's Eve party.]]
Traditional celebrations of New Year's Eve (''Revelion'') are the norm in [[Romania]]. Romanians follow centuries-old customs, rituals, and conventions. Children sing "[[Plugușorul]]" and "Sorcova", traditional carols that wish goodwill, happiness and success.

Parties are common in the evening. Since the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], Romanians have gathered in the [[University Square, Bucharest|University Square]] in [[Bucharest]]. Other significant parties occur in [[Piața Constituției]]. New Year's Eve is also marked by a national all-night telecast on [[Romanian Television]], which also celebrates its anniversary on this holiday, having opened its doors in the New Year's Eve of 1956.

===Russia===
{{main|Novy God}}
Most Russians celebrate New Year's Eve with their families and close friends. The origin of this holiday in [[Russia]] derives from [[Christmas]]. Christmas was also a major holiday in Russia until it was banned, with all other religious holidays, by the Communist Party. To compensate for the absence of Christmas, New Year's was celebrated as much as Christmas was, but without the religious aspect of the holiday and lot of a Christmas attributes were repurposed, such as Christmas tree, which became a New Year tree. Even after the fall of the Soviet Union, New Year's is still celebrated in Russia and has become a [[Russian traditions and superstitions|Russian tradition]]. There is an old superstition that if the first visitor (especially an unexpected one) on 1 January is a male, the year will be good. People also try to start the new year without debts.

[[File:S novym godom 2012.ogv|thumb|left|The [[Kremlin Clock]] chimes and the singing of the [[Russian national anthem]] bring in the New Year (2012).]]
The celebration usually starts one or two hours before midnight. A common tradition is to "say farewell to the old year" by remembering the most important events of the last twelve months. At five minutes to midnight most people watch the president's [[New Year speech]] on TV&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Talmazan|first1=Yuliya|title=Top Ten Traditions No Winter Holiday Season In Russia Goes Without|url=http://www.ytfiles.com/2009/12/30/top-ten-traditions-no-winter-holiday-season-in-russia-goes-without|accessdate=31 December 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226112117/http://www.ytfiles.com/2009/12/30/top-ten-traditions-no-winter-holiday-season-in-russia-goes-without|archivedate=26 February 2010|date=30 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and watch popular films or New Year TV shows before and after midnight. There is a tradition to listen to the [[Kremlin]] clock bell ringing twelve times on the radio or on TV, which is followed by the [[National anthem of Russia|national anthem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USSR 1990 New Year's Message Prt. 2 of 2|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOqwPdYoV-c|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Putin: New Year's Address to the Nation (English Subtitles)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_JxKKY7I_Y|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During these twelve seconds people keep silence and make their secret wishes for the next year. After the clock strikes, they drink champagne and have rich dinner, watching TV concerts and having fun. Some people light fireworks outside and visit their friends and neighbors. As 30 and 31 December are working days, a lot of people also have parties at work (so-called "corporatives"), though 31 December is mostly spent at home or with friends. [[Grandfather Frost]] and his [[Snowmaiden|granddaughter Snowmaiden]] bring presents on New Year's Eve.

On 13 January, some of people celebrates "Old New Year", according to the Julian calendar.

===Serbia===
New Year's Eve in Serbia is traditionally celebrated extensively. Indoors, families celebrate New Year's Eve with an abundance of food. Serbs decorate trees, ''Novogodišnja jelka'', at New Year's Eve, rather than at Christmas Eve. Near, or after midnight, Santa Claus (''Deda Mraz'') visits houses and leaves presents under the tree, to be unpacked then or, if the family is asleep, to be discovered in the morning.

Serbian New Year's celebrations take place in [[Belgrade]], and several other major cities such as [[Novi Sad]] and [[Niš]]. As of mid-December, cities are extensively decorated and lit. The decorations remain until way into January due to the influence of the [[Julian calendar]]. Throughout the region, especially amongst former [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] republics, Belgrade is the most popular destination for major parties.

On 13 January, a large part of the population{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} celebrates "[[Old New Year|Serbian New Year]]", according to the Julian calendar. Usually one concert is organized in front of either City Hall or the National Parliament in Belgrade, while fireworks are prepared by the Serbian Orthodox Church and fired from the [[Cathedral of Saint Sava]], where people also gather. Other cities also organize such celebrations.

===Slovenia===
In [[Slovenia]], New Year's Eve is known as a Saint Sylvester's Day (Silvestrovo). Streets are decorated for the whole December. In larger cities like [[Ljubljana]], [[Maribor]], [[Celje]] or [[Koper]] there are concerts, culture programm and countdown followed by fireworks. There is also special programme on the national TV. Tradition is, that family comes together and have a dinner. At midnight, people toast with champagne, wish each other a happy new year, fortune and health. People have already decorated the Christmas tree before Christmas and children are waiting for the third "Good man of December - Dedek Mraz."

===Spain===
[[File:Nochevieja puertadelsol 2006.jpg|thumb|[[Madrid]]'s [[Puerta del Sol]] on New Year's Eve, 2005.]]
Spanish New Year's Eve (''Nochevieja'' or ''Fin de Año'') celebrations usually begin with a family dinner, traditionally including [[shrimp]] or [[prawns]], and [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] or [[capon]]. The actual countdown is primarily followed from the clock on top of the Casa de Correos building in [[Puerta del Sol]] Square in [[Madrid]]. It is traditional to eat [[Twelve Grapes]], one on each chime of the clock. This tradition has its origins in 1909, when grape growers in [[Alicante]] thought of it as a way to cut down on the large production surplus they had had that year. Nowadays, the tradition is followed by almost every Spaniard, and the twelve grapes have become synonymous with the New Year. After the clock has finished striking twelve, people greet each other and toast with sparkling wine such as [[Cava (Spanish wine)|cava]] or [[champagne (wine)|champagne]], or with cider. The song "Un año más," by the Spanish group [[Mecano]], is frequently played.

Earlier in the evening at around 20:00, there is a 10k run called [[San Silvestre Vallecana]], which starts on [[Paseo de la Castellana]], next to [[Santiago Bernabéu Stadium]], and ends at the [[Campo de Fútbol de Vallecas|Vallecas Stadium]].  Professional runners come to Madrid for this 10k.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

After the family dinner and the grapes, many young people attend ''cotillones de nochevieja'' parties (named for the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''cotillón'', which refers to party supplies like confetti, party blowers, and party hats) at pubs, clubs, and similar places. Parties usually last until the next morning and range from small, personal celebrations at local bars to huge parties with guests numbering the thousands at hotel convention rooms. Early the next morning, party attendees usually gather to have the traditional winter breakfast of hot chocolate and fried pastry (''chocolate con [[churro]]s'').

===Sweden===
[[File:New Years Eve 2008-2009 -1.jpg|thumb|[[Gothenburg]] fireworks on New Year's Eve, 2008.]]
In [[Sweden]], New Year's Eve is usually celebrated with families or with friends. A few hours before and after midnight, people usually party and eat a special dinner, often three courses. New Year's Eve is celebrated with large fireworks displays throughout the country, especially in the cities. People over the age of 18 are allowed to buy fireworks, which are sold by local stores or by private persons. While watching or lighting fireworks at midnight, people usually drink champagne.

===Switzerland===
In [[Switzerland]], New Year's Eve is typically celebrated at a residence with friends. There are no particular main dishes associated with the event, although sweets and desserts are usual. Each [[Municipalities of Switzerland|commune]] has its own government-arranged countdown in a public space, accompanied with formal fireworks shows in smaller cities.

===Turkey===
[[File:Kadıköy Yılbaşı.jpg|thumb|New Year's Eve decorations in [[Kadıköy]], Istanbul.]]
[[File:Nişantaşı 2010-11 Yılbaşı Süslemeleri.jpg|thumb|New Year's Eve decorations in [[Nişantaşı]], [[İstanbul]].]]
Numerous decorations and customs traditionally associated with Christmas and [[Bayram (Turkey)|Bayrams]] are part of [[secular]] New Year's Eve celebrations in [[Turkey]]. Homes and streets are lit in glittering lights. Small gifts are exchanged, and large family dinners are organized with family and friends, featuring a special [[Stuffed turkey|turkey]] dish stuffed with a [[zante currant]], [[pine nuts]], [[pimiento]] and [[dill]] ''[[pilaf|iç pilav]]'', [[dolma]], hot [[börek]], [[baklava]], and various other [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish dishes]], accompanied with [[rakı]], [[Turkish wine]], or [[boza]], [[Sharbat|şerbet]], [[salep]], and [[Turkish tea]] or [[Turkish coffee|coffee]]. Even though Turkish people generally do not celebrate [[Christmas]], decorating Christmas trees is a very popular tradition on New Year's Eve in Turkey, and the Turks associate [[Santa Claus]] with New Year's Eve.

Television and radio channels are known to continuously broadcast a variety of special New Year's Eve programs, while [[Municipality|municipalities]] all around the country organize fundraising events for the poor, in addition to celebratory public shows such as concerts and family-friendly events, as well as more traditional forms of entertainment such as the [[Karagöz and Hacivat]] [[shadow theatre|shadow-theater]], and even performances by the [[Mehter]]—the [[Janissary]] Band that was founded during the days of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

Public and private parties with large public attendances are organised in a number of cities and towns, particularly in the largest metropolitan areas such as [[Istanbul]], [[Ankara]], [[Izmir]], [[Adana]], [[Bursa]] and [[Antalya]], with the biggest celebrations taking place in Istanbul's [[Taksim Square|Taksim]], [[Beyoğlu]], [[Nişantaşı]] and [[Kadıköy]] districts and Ankara's [[Kızılay Square]], which generally feature dancing, concerts, laser and lightshows as well as the traditional countdown and fireworks display.

===Ukraine===
In the countries that were formerly part of the Soviet Union, New Year's has the same cultural significance as Christmas has in the United States, but without the religious connotations. Ukrainian families traditionally install spruce trees at home, the equivalent of a Christmas tree. Families gather to eat a large feast and reflect on the past year. They have a large celebration, make toasts, and make wishes for a happy New Year. Families give presents to their friends as well as informal acquaintances. As Ukrainians are traditionally a closely knit community, it is seen as a taboo to not give presents to those the family associates with. Children stay up until midnight, waiting for the New Year. During these celebrations many Ukrainians tune to special New Year shows, which have become a long-standing tradition for the Ukrainian TV. And just before midnight the [[President of Ukraine]] gives his New Year's message to the nation, and when the clock strikes 12, the National Anthem [[Shche ne vmerla Ukraina]] is played in all TV and radio stations as well as in Independence Square in Kiev and other cities where holiday celebrations are held.

The first New year dish in Ukraine which associates with the New year for every Ukrainian person is the Olivier salad. It has become the main «character» of many jokes and anecdotes. There are several versions about where the name Olivier comes from, but most people say that it appeared thanks to the French chef Olivier, who lived in the USSR in the 1960s and was the owner of a French restaurant in Moscow. He was the first one to cook this dish. Nowadays this salad is also called Russian, potato and meat salad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diolli.com/new-year-dishes-in-ukraine/|title=New year dish - Ukrainian food - Diolli.com|date=20 December 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Year is often considered a "pre-celebration" for Greek Catholics and Eastern Orthodox living in Eastern Europe, primarily in Ukraine, since Christmas is celebrated on 7 January.

====England====
{{Main|New Year's Eve in London}}
[[File:LondonTrafSQNYE.jpg|thumb|right|Thousands of people gather in [[central London]] for New Year celebrations, including fireworks at the [[London Eye]] at midnight]]
The most prominent New Year's celebration in England is that of [[Central London]], where the arrival of midnight is greeted with the chimes of [[Big Ben]]. In recent years, a major fireworks display has also been held, with fireworks launched from the nearby [[London Eye]] Ferris wheel. On New Year's Eve 2010, an estimated 250,000 people gathered to view an eight-minute fireworks display around and above the London Eye which was, for the first time, set to a musical soundtrack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-12093696 | publisher=BBC News | title=London Eye fireworks mark new year 2011 | date=1 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The celebrations in London continued into 1 January, with the [[New Year's Day Parade]], held annually since 1987. The 2011 parade involved more than 10,000 musicians, cheerleaders and performers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/jan/01/uk-welcomes-new-year-fireworks | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=David | last=Batty | title=New Year's Eve in the UK: 'The best fireworks ever' | date=1 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other major New Year events are held in the cities of [[Birmingham]], [[Manchester]], [[Liverpool]], [[Leeds]], and [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]].

====Scotland====
{{main|Hogmanay}}
{{see also|Edinburgh's Hogmanay}}
[[File:EdinburghNYE.jpg|thumb|[[Hogmanay]] fireworks in [[Edinburgh]].]]
In [[Scotland]], New Year's (''[[Hogmanay]]'') is celebrated with several different customs, such as [[First-Foot]]ing, which involves friends or family members going to each other's houses with a gift of whisky and sometimes a lump of coal.

[[Edinburgh]], the Scottish capital, hosts one of the world's most famous New Year celebrations. The celebration is focused on a major street party along [[Princes Street]]. The cannon is fired at [[Edinburgh Castle]] at the stroke of midnight, followed by a large fireworks display. Edinburgh hosts a festival of four or five days, beginning on 28 December, and lasting until New Year's Day or 2 January, which is also a [[bank holiday]] in Scotland.

Other cities across Scotland, such as [[Aberdeen]], [[Glasgow]] and [[Stirling]] have large organised celebrations too, including fireworks at midnight.

[[BBC Scotland]] [[Hogmanay Live|broadcast the celebrations]] in Edinburgh to a Scottish audience, with the celebrations also screened across the world. [[STV (TV network)|STV]] covers both worldwide New Year celebrations, and details of events happening around Scotland.

====Wales====
{{Further|Calennig}}
[[File:Mari Lwyd NLW.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A Mari Lwyd c. 1910–1914. Traditionally carried from door to door during [[Calennig]] in [[Wales]]]]
The [[Wales|Welsh]] tradition of giving gifts and money on New Year's Day ({{lang-cy|Calennig}}) is an ancient custom that survives in modern-day Wales, though nowadays it is now customary to give bread and cheese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hutton |first=Ronald |authorlink=Ronald Hutton |title=The Stations of The Sun |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, UK |page=67 |year=1996 |isbn=0-19-820570-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands of people descend every year on [[Cardiff]] to enjoy live music, catering, ice-skating, funfairs and fireworks. Many of the celebrations take place at [[Cardiff Castle]] and [[City Hall, Cardiff|Cardiff City Hall]].

Every New Year's Eve, the [[Nos Galan road race]] (''Rasys Nos Galan''), a {{Convert|5|km|mi|adj=on}} running race, is held in [[Mountain Ash, Wales|Mountain Ash]] in the [[Cynon Valley]], [[Rhondda Cynon Taf]], [[South Wales]]. The race celebrates the life and achievements of Welsh runner [[Guto Nyth Brân]].

Founded in 1958 by local runner Bernard Baldwin, it is run over the 5 kilometre route of Guto's first competitive race. The main race starts with a church service at [[Llanwynno]], and then a wreath is laid on Guto's grave in [[Llanwynno]] graveyard. After lighting a torch, it is carried to the nearby town of Mountain Ash, where the main race takes place.

The race consists of a double circuit of the town centre, starting in Henry Street and ending in Oxford Street, by the commemorative statue of Guto. Traditionally, the race was timed to end at midnight, but in recent times it was rescheduled for the convenience of family entertainment, now concluding at around 9pm.

This has resulted in a growth in size and scale, and the proceedings now start with an afternoon of street entertainment, and fun run races for children, concluding with the church service, elite runners' race and presentations.

==Middle East==

===Australia===
{{See also|Sydney New Year's Eve}}
[[File:Sydney new years 2008-9.JPG|thumb|[[Sydney New Year's Eve 2008–09]]]]
Each major city in [[Australia]] holds New Year's Eve celebrations, usually accompanied by a fireworks display and other events. [[Gloucester Park, Perth|Gloucester Park]], a racecourse in central [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], is the largest and most recognized display in the Western Australian city. In [[Brisbane, Queensland|Brisbane]] events are held at [[South Bank, Queensland|Southbank]]. At night, 50,000 people gather at sites around the [[Brisbane River]] to watch a fireworks display.

The largest celebration in Australia is held in its largest city: [[Sydney]]. Each year, the celebrations in Sydney are accompanied by a theme with two pyrotechnic shows: the ''9:00 pm Family Fireworks'' and the ''Midnight Fireworks''. Centering on the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]], the fireworks are synchronized to a blend of popular music and a lighting display called the "[[Sydney New Year's Eve#Bridge effect|Bridge Effect]]", which displays various symbols and other images related to the current year's theme, located on the bridge itself. The "Midnight Fireworks" are regularly watched by approximately 1.5–2 million people at [[Sydney Harbour]]. As one of the first major New Year's celebrations globally each year, Sydney's ''Midnight Fireworks'' are often broadcast throughout the world during the day of 31 December. In Melbourne, the city follows suit with Sydney having a 9:30 Family Fireworks followed by the midnight fireworks. Celebrations are mostly centered on the [[Yarra River]] and [[Federation Square]], as well as [[Docklands, Victoria|Docklands]]. Most of the firework shows in Melbourne are launched from boats along the river and from atop the city's various skyscrapers.

===Kiribati===
[[Kiritimati]] ([[UTC+14]]), part of [[Kiribati]], is one of the first locations in the world to welcome the New Year.  Other Kiribati islands follow at [[UTC+13]] and [[UTC+12]].

===New Zealand===
Many of New Zealand's cities and towns see in the new year with open-air concerts and fireworks displays.

[[Auckland]] regularly has a fireworks display at midnight from the top of the [[Sky Tower (Auckland)|Sky Tower]]. In [[Wellington]], [[Frank Kitts Park]] is the venue for a festival including fireworks, music, and open-air film displays. Similar events occur in Hamilton, starting with a family-friendly event at Steele Park, followed by an adult-specific party at [[SkyCity Hamilton]]. [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]], one of the first cities in the world to see sunrise at new year&lt;ref&gt;Gisborne is further east than any other New Zealand city, but due to the earth's axial tilt, the hills around Dunedin also receive sunrise at an almost identical time at new year. Nuku'alofa in Tonga and Apia and Samoa also receive the sun at almost exactly the same time. Given that the earth's axial tilt oscillates fractionally, the title of "first city to see the sun" — though usually claimed by Gisborne — is open to some debate.&lt;/ref&gt; also celebrates with a new year festival. The small town of [[Whangamata]], on the [[Coromandel Peninsula]], is a major party venue at new year, especially for Aucklanders.

In the South Island, both [[Christchurch]] and [[Dunedin]] host free live music concerts culminating with a midnight fireworks display. These are held at [[Hagley Park, Christchurch|Hagley Park]] and [[The Octagon, Dunedin|The Octagon]] respectively. The South Island's main resort town, [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]] is also a major new year party venue, with music and fireworks.

===Samoa===
Since changing the [[time zone]] from [[UTC-11]] to [[UTC+13]] in winter and [[UTC+14]] in summer (including new year), Samoa is the first country to receive the New Year as a whole, sharing it with some parts of [[Kiribati]].

The '''Orion Music + More''' was a touring music festival created by American [[thrash metal]]/[[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Metallica]]. On February 7, 2012, the band announced plans to launch the festival, which took place at [[Bader Field]] in [[Atlantic City]] on June 23 and 24, 2012.

It was announced that [[Belle Isle Park|Belle Isle]] would be the site of the Orion Music + More Festival in 2013.

Balki]], featuring [[Akshay Kumar]], [[Sonam Kapoor]] and [[Radhika Apte]] in lead roles. It is based on the short story "The Sanitary Man of Sacred Land" in [[Twinkle Khanna]]'s book ''[[The Legend of Lakshmi Prasad]]'', which is inspired by the life of [[Arunachalam Muruganantham]], a social activist from [[Tamil Nadu]] who introduced low-cost [[sanitary pad]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://t2online.com/lifestyle/padman-twinkle-khanna-book-the-legend-of-lakshmi-prasad-arunachalam-muruganantham-sanitary-pads/cid/1.62451|last=Mazumder|first=Jayeeta|work=T2 Online|title=Padman: The un-caped hero in Twinkle Khanna's book}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released theatrically on 9 February 2018.

==Plot==
The story starts with the marriage of Lakshmikant "Laxmi" Chauhan ([[Akshay Kumar]]) and Gayatri ([[Radhika Apte]]). Laxmi is deeply in love with his wife and will do anything for her comfort and happiness. When Gayatri is temporarily banished from the household during her menstrual periods, Laxmi is caught unaware due to his lack of knowledge about the subject. He gets worried on seeing Gayatri using a dirty rag during her periods. Gayatri tells him he should not interfere in this feminine topic. Undeterred, Laxmi buys sanitary pads for his wife, which are rather costly. Gayatri tells him to return it, as using such costly napkins means cutting off milk expenses. Crestfallen, Laxmi goes to work, where a worker gets injured. He immediately applies a pad to the injury, despite the others referring to it as 'impure'. The doctor lauds Laxmi's quick thinking and says that it is the cleanest choice to stop bleeding. Excited, Laxmi buys some cotton, cloth, and glue and makes a temporary pad, which he thinks is a better replacement for the costly one. 

Gayatri uses it but the pad fails in its function and she tells Laxmi to not interfere in women's matters again. Laxmi again tries to make a pad, and gives it to a female medical student, who decides to help him out but is deterred by her friends. To add to his woes, his meeting with the student makes his wife think that he has an affair. Laxmi tries to give his sister pads, which leads to embarrassment in front of her in-laws. Next, he tries it on himself by attaching a balloon filled with goat blood, which leads to him getting blood all over his trousers in public, resulting in humiliation. This act causes him to be branded 'a man with loose morals' by the entire village. Gayatri's brothers take her away and Laxmi decides to leave, pledging to fight the taboo surrounding menstruation.

After learning that sanitary pads use the more absorbent [[cellulose]] fibre rather than cotton, Laxmi goes to a college to gain knowledge about the materials used in sanitary napkins. In need of money and shelter, he works as a manservant in a professor's house. The professor's son introduces him to the Internet and helps him get information. The professor is baffled by Laxmi's actions and shows him videos of pad-making machines worth millions to derail his ideas. It has the opposite effect: Laxmi is inspired by this to make his own pad-making machine. He borrows money and manages to make a good pad but has no one to test it. He ends up meeting Pari Walia ([[ Sonam Kapoor]]), a modern, educated woman from the city, and supplies a pad to her. When he asks for feedback, she says that it's like a normal pad. Laxmi's joy knows no bounds and he calls Gayatri to give her the news. Gayatri gets upset at his obsession with menstruation, and her brother warns him to stay away. 

Pari sees Laxmi's potential and invites him to an innovation fair in Delhi. Laxmi's invention is recognized as the 'Life-Changing Innovation of the Year' and he shoots to fame but the villagers, on realizing the nature of his invention, insult him. Pari helps a dejected Laxmi sell his pads to rural women, who later join him in his venture. Laxmi and Pari travel from village to village, making low-cost pad-manufacturing machines, creating small pad-making factories, and providing rural women both jobs and pads for sale. He is invited to New York and gives a speech at [[UNICEF]]. Back home, he is awarded the [[Padmashri]]. Pari falls in love with him, which makes Laxmi conflicted as he has feelings for her too. However, she steps back for his happiness, with Laxmi telling her she helped make him a new man. Laxmi returns to a hero's welcome in his village. The film ends with Laxmi and Gayatri finally uniting, and Laxmi finding continued success with his endeavors.

The producers' main agenda was to reach out to a wide audience to create awareness and eradicate prevalent superstitions in India surrounding sanitary pads. As with Kumar's previous film, ''[[Toilet: Ek Prem Katha]]'', he hoped to educate the masses, both women and men, about menstrual hygiene and to stop labelling it as stigma or taboo in society.&lt;ref name="com"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.firstpost.com/entertainment/akshay-kumar-on-padman-our-aim-is-to-create-awareness-with-the-film-not-earn-money-4269005.html|title= Akshay Kumar on Padman: Our aim is to create awareness with the film, not earn money|date=December 21, 2017|accessdate=December 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it was a plea towards politicians to drive their attention towards sanitary pads and making it mandatory across institutions.&lt;ref name="news"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.newsweek.com/why-king-bollywood-akshay-kumar-making-movie-about-menstruation-and-pads-730525|title= Why King of Bollywood Akshay Kumar Made A Movie About Menstruation|author=Abigail Jones|work=''News Room''|date=December 19, 2017|accessdate=December 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea to adapt Murugan's life began in 2015 when [[Twinkle Khanna]] came across his story while doing a research for a column in ''[[The Times of India]]''. Inspired and moved by his persistence and determination, she wrote about him in her book, ''[[The Legend of Lakshmi Prasad]]'' (2016).&lt;ref name="news"/&gt; Later, she planned to adapt his life to the big screen in order to reach out to more audiences, saying "our world is filled with viewers, not readers."&lt;ref name="news"/&gt; Khanna, who also serves as a producer on the film, said she was drawn to the project due to its relevant yet underrated subject about menstruation and Muruganantham's determination.&lt;ref name="pad"/&gt;

[[R. Balki]] was Khanna's first choice to direct the film. She had previously seen Balki's work and appreciated his sensitivity in filmmaking.&lt;ref name="1st"/&gt; 

In November 2017, Sony Pictures became the global distributor for the film.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/robcain/2017/11/14/hollywoods-sony-pictures-joins-akshay-kumars-padman-as-global-distributor/#550ddd1e1135|title=Hollywood's Sony Pictures Joins Akshay Kumar's 'Padman' As Global Distributor|last=Cain|first=Rob|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-11-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===
[[Akshay Kumar]] plays [[Arunachalam Muruganantham]], also known as "India's Menstrual Man".&lt;ref name="pad"/&gt;&lt;ref name="news"/&gt; Kumar was not the first choice to play the role.&lt;ref name="poster2"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://m.timesofindia.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/akshay-kumar-has-million-tales-to-tell-in-new-padman-poster/articleshow/62208028.cms|title= Akshay Kumar has million tales to tell in new 'PadMan' poster|work=''[[The Times of India]]''|date=December 22, 2017|accessdate=December 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1st"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.koimoi.com/bollywood-news/twinkle-khanna-akshay-kumar-not-first-choice-padman/|title= Twinkle Khanna: Akshay Kumar Was Not The First Choice For Padman|author=Sneha Hiro|work=[[Koimoi.com]]|date=December 20, 2017|accessdate=December 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khanna thought of a few actors but she eventually handed it to Kumar after Muruganantham's insistence&lt;ref name="1st"/&gt; and because she thought it would be a game-changing event if Kumar, who the Indian public idolises and men look up to, wore a sanitary pad.&lt;ref name="tex"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/akshay-kumar-the-padman-song-watch-video-4997857/lite/|title= The PadMan Song: Akshay Kumar tells why you need to be a madman to become a superhero, watch video|author=A.

===Filming===
[[File:UN Headquarters 2.jpg|thumb|right|220px|''Pad Man'' is only the second Bollywood film to be granted access to shoot the film inside the [[headquarters of the United Nations]] in [[New York City]], after ''[[Half Girlfriend (film)|Half Girlfriend]]'' in 2016.]]

Majority of the film was shot in a small town beside Narmada river named, [[Maheshwar]] in Madhya Pradesh. After filming ended in India, the team travelled to [[New York City]] where pivotal scenes were filmmed in [[Brooklyn Bridge]], [[Times Square]] and Jazz at [[Lincoln Center]],&lt;ref name="news"/&gt; as well as the [[Headquarters of the United Nations|United Nations headquarter]]. It is the second Bollywood film to be shot at the site following ''[[Half Girlfriend (film)|Half Girlfriend]]'' while Hollywood film ''[[The Interpreter]]'' was the first.&lt;ref name="UNh"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2017/11/19/akshay-kumars-padman-to-be-shot-at-united-nations-headquarters/|title= Akshay Kumar’s PadMan to be shot at United Nations headquarters|work=''[[Pakistan Today]]''|date=November 19, 2017|accessdate=December 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marketing===
The first trailer was released on 15 December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news18.com/news/movies/padman-trailer-akshay-kumar-as-pagla-superhero-is-set-to-break-all-stereotypes-1605149.html|work=[[News 18]]|date=15 December 2017|author=[[News 18]]|title=PadMan Trailer: Akshay Kumar as 'Pagla Superhero' is Set To Break All Stereotypes|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, the trailer began trending on [[Twitter]] with the hashtag #PadManTrailer. Scenes showing Kumar casually trying to wear a sanitary napkin and handing them to his sister became a trending topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.ndtv.com/offbeat/padman-trailer-released-twitter-discusses-periods-1788311|title=Thanks To 'PadMan' Trailer, Twitter Is Discussing...

''[[The Times of India]]'' called it a "unique poster".&lt;ref name="poster2"/&gt;

===Controversy===
The film was banned in Kuwait and Pakistan due to its subject revolving around a taboo. [[Central Board of Film Censors]], Pakistan refused to give the No-Objection Certificate to the film and said, "we cannot allow a film whose name, subject and story are not acceptable yet in our society." They disallowed the Pakistani film distributors IMGC and HKC to purchase the film rights and stated that they were "ruining Islamic traditions, history and culture." Film posters were also removed from the local cinemas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.samaa.tv/entertainment/2018/02/akshay-kumars-padman-pakistan/|title=Akshay Kumar's Padman won't release in Pakistan|date=9 February 2018|publisher=[[Samaa TV]]|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1631295/4|title=Shocking: 'PadMan' banned in Pakistan|date=10 February 2018|work=[[The Express Tribune]]|author=Adnan Lodhi|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bollywoodoverhollywood.com/why-padman-padmavaat-and-veere-di-wedding-were-banned-in-kuwait/|title=Why Pad Man, Padmavaat and Veere Di Wedding Were Banned In Kuwait |date=14 June 2018|publisher=Bollywood Over Hollywood|accessdate=14 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Pakistani women have protested these decisions by sending pictures of them holding sanitary pads to the censor board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mangobaaz.com/outraged-by-the-ban-of-padman-women-sending-pads-to-censor-board/|title=Pakistani Women Are Sending Pads To The Censor Board|date=13 February 2018|publisher=[[Mangobaaz]]|accessdate=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 24, 2008, its headquarters and the homes of its top executives and some associated businesses were raided by the [[FBI]].  [[Wiretap]]s based on information gleaned from a confidential co-[[Conspiracy (crime)|conspirator]] are alleged to detail the existence of a $2 billion investment fraud.  The allegations include creating phony purchase orders from [[Sam's Club]] and [[BJ's Wholesale Club|BJ's]] to create the appearance of tremendous sales of merchandise.  CEO [[Tom Petters]] is the central figure in the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stmedia.startribune.com/documents/Petters0926.pdf Affidavit from investigator]&lt;/ref&gt; A federal court appointed Doug Kelley, a lawyer, as receiver for the Petters companies, excluding bankrupt Sun Country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.startribune.com/business/30563724.html?elr=KArksLckD8EQDUoaEyqyP4O:DW3ckUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aULPQL7PQLanchO7DiUX&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sarasota Chalk Festival''' is an [[United States|American]] cultural event of [[public art]] that  celebrates a [[performing art]] form of pavement art also known as [[Italy|Italian]] [[street painting]]. During the festival artists use chalk, and occasionally special paint, to paint the road surface to create large works of art while the viewer can watch the creative process.&lt;ref name="The Australian - 09Nov2011 - Amazing art brings pavements to life at Sarasota Chalk Festival "&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/travel/world/sarasota-chalk-festival-brings-pavement-art-to-life/story-fn302659-1226189867523|title=Amazing art brings pavements to life at Sarasota Chalk Festival |last=Lush|first=Jennifer|date=November 9, 2011|work=[[The Australian]]|accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival is focused around the street artists who are known as [[Madonnari]] in Italy or commonly referred to ''Street Painters'', ''Chalk Artists'', ''Sidewalk Artists'', or ''Pavement Artists''. The festival is held annually in downtown [[Sarasota]] in [[Owen Burns|Burns Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20101028/ARTICLE/10281004|title= Artists to make the pavement come alive in Sarasota|author= Ball, David|date= October 23, 2010|work= [[Sarasota Herald Tribune]]|publisher= The New York Times Company|page= BN1|accessdate= December 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.yourobserver.com/news/sarasota/Front-Page/102920108602/WEEKEND-BEST-BET-Sarasota-Chalk-Festival|title= Weekend Best Bet: Sarasota Chalk Festival|author= Observer Staff|date= October 29, 2010|work= Your Observer.Com|publisher= The Observer Group|accessdate= December 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 28, 2013 the festival was featured by the [[New York Times]] as a destination recommended on its ''Guide to Intelligent Travel''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://intransit.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/28/calendar-coming-events-in-florida-turkey-and-wisconsin/?smid=tw-share&amp;_r=0 ''Coming Events In Florida''], A Guide to Intelligent Travel, In Transit, Calendar, New York Times, October 28, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cummings, Ian, ''[http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20131029/ARTICLE/131029577/0/columnist?template=printpicart Chalk festival gets travel blog's nod]'', Sarasota Herald-Tribune, Tuesday, October 29, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 2010 during its third season, the Sarasota Chalk Festival became the first ''international'' street painting festival in the United States of America,&lt;ref&gt;[http://vimeo.com/20729191 ''The First International Street Painting Festival in the United States''], Cuomo, Alessio and de Nooij, Sander, Coldsun Productions, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; inviting artists from around the world to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20101028/ARTICLE/10281004|title= Street art goes global this year|author= Weingarten, Abby|date=  October 28, 2010|work= [[Sarasota Herald Tribune]]|publisher= The New York Times Company|page= E6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Setting a unique theme for each year was instituted for the planning of each annual event with that year as well. Documenting the origins, diversity, spirit, appeal, and growing popularity of street painting, filming for a 2013 film on modern street painting around the world began with scenes and interviews at the first international Sarasota festival; a video production describing the film was released in February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Westerink, Peter, de Nooij, Sander, Cuomo, Alessio, ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFeKontv8a8 ''I Madonnari''], 2012, ColdSun Productions and Planet StreetPainting, Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt;

A book, '''''[[Avenida de Colores, Inc.|Sarasota Chalk Festival]]''''' ''(right)'', was published by the festival organization in time for availability at the 2011 festival. The 214-page book, described as a collector edition, provides an extensive history of the street painting it features and discusses many of the artists who have become famous for performing the art at various locations around the world. Many of these artists were invited to the debut of broadening the scope of the festival to international status. The book provides examples of their work—either here or abroad. Many of the artists return each year, so the material remains timely as well as historic. It also describes the music and arts on Sarasota's "Cultural Coast" and the many attractive Sarasota beaches on the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. The book has been available at each festival since its publication and always is available at the festival offices.

===Themes===

===&amp;nbsp;— 2010&amp;nbsp;— Halloween ===

The theme of the 2010 festival was [[Halloween]]. Many renowned street painters from all over the world participated in the event that was held October 25 through October 31. More than 80,000 people attended the seven-day event, and in an unprecedented action prompted by the popularity of the festival, the municipal government extended the street closure for an additional day so people could view the completed artworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.newswiretoday.com/news/80895/|title= Sarasota Chalk Festival Creates Awe-Inspiring Artwork - Attracts 100,000 Visitors and Sets 2011 Dates|author= Newswire|date= November 11, 2010|work= Newswire PR Today|accessdate= December 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://scg.co.sarasota.fl.us/videos/20101112SCWeekly36.asx|title= Sarasota County Weekly Sarasota Chalk Festival|author= Ray Collins|date= November 12, 2010|work= Sarasota County Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[documentaries]] were created about the 2010 festival that were released locally and in Europe, including the first documentary on Street Painting to be released at the Grazie di Curtatone 24-hour Madonnari Competition, August 15, 2012. Sarasota Chalk Festival founder Denise Kowal was invited to be a judge at the 2011 Grazie di Curtatone, making her the second foreigner and first American to be invited to judge this prestigious festival that was the first street painting festival in the world. The Grazie di Curtatone festival is celebrating its fortieth anniversary in 2012 and Denise Kowal was invited again to be a judge of the competition.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Kids paintings sarasota chalk festival.PNG|thumb|Each year, hundreds of chalk paintings on the streets of [[Burns Square]] are made by children attending the festival; they use the free materials given to them and all of the adult and professional artists who participate in the Sarasota Chalk Festival {{Pufc|1=Kids paintings sarasota chalk festival.PNG|date=11 May 2015}}]] --&gt;
The featured artist at the Sarasota festival, Maestro Madonnaro and [[Guinness World Record]] holder, [[Edgar Mueller]], created a [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional (3-D)]] street painting that made history for introducing a new [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] in street art that with special [[Stereoscopy|equipment]] may be seen in three-dimensions. This ground-breaking street painting also appeared to change from a giant by day, to a fetus by night, through the use of [[photoluminescence|photoluminescent]] paints and artificial lighting. It measured 100' x 40'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V22THzYnUXE |title=Guinness World Record Pavement Art time lapse &amp; interview |author=20centuryfoxtrailers |accessdate=December 17, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207103514/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V22THzYnUXE |archivedate=December 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second guest artist and first Guinness World Record holder for a street painter, [[Tracy Lee Stum]], also was featured in 2010. She created a [[two-point perspective]] 65' x 30' 3-D interactive Mousetrap game and completed the installation with assistance from Sharyn Namnath, Julio Jimenez, Charlene Lanzel, and Fred Wilms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ref= http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/Search/Details/Largest-chalk-painting-by-one-artist/105452.htm|title= Largest Chalk Painting by one Artist|author= Guinness World Records|accessdate= December 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third Guinness World Record holder, [[Leon Keer]], traveled from the [[Netherlands]] and won third place for his original street painting featuring depictions of [[Alice in Wonderland]] and [[Little Red Riding Hood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ref= http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/Search/Details/Largest-anamorphic-pavement-art/122515.htm|title= Largest Anamorphic Pavement Art|author= Guinness World Records|accessdate= December 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genna Panzarella, the first woman to be awarded the Maestra Madonnaro title in Grazie di Curtatone, Italy, created a giant painting of a skeletal horse during the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ref= http://articles.sfgate.com/2002-08-23/news/17559208_1_street-painting-festival-indonesian-san-rafael|title= Mill Valley Artist Win International Competition|date= August 23, 2002|accessdate= December 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Maestro Madonnaro Vera Bugatti traveled from Italy to America for the first time in order to create her original street painting, incorporating a [[Batman]] theme.

The 2010 festival supported several secondary events held on its fringes. They included the ''Hallowscreen'' Fringe Film Festival with indoor and outdoor movies organized by executive director Lori Bowen, the France Engels Couture 60' Runway Show in cooperation with Carrianna Hutchinson, Sarasota's Largest Pumpkin Carving Contest, a performance stage with multiple artists such as [[flute|flutist]] Jane Hoffman and guitarist Rick Peterson, the Moving Ethos Dance Company, the West Coast Civic Ballet, the Jump Dance Company, [[The Garbage-Men]], and the Dragonfly Café Poets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq0E4-EN630|title= At the Movies - Hallowscreen|author= Gus Mollasis|date= October 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===&amp;nbsp;— 2011&amp;nbsp;— Pavement art through the ages===

In 2011, with the theme 'Pavement Art Through the Ages', the Sarasota Chalk Festival attracted 250 renowned pavement artists from all over the world. Artists from France, Australia, Germany, Canada, Peru, Spain, Mexico, Netherlands, Japan, Italy, France, and Brazil as well as from almost every state in the United States traveled to participate in the week-long festival that drew 200,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dutchdailynews.com/dutch-artists-create-3d-street-painting|title= Dutch artists create 3-D street painting in Florida|author= Dutch Daily News|date= November 13, 2011|work= dutchdailynews.com/|publisher= Dutch Daily News|accessdate= November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Three-dimensional'''''

A museum gallery displaying works by [[Kurt Wenner]], the innovator of [[three-dimensional|three-dimensional (3-D)]] pavement art, was held and Wenner presented six lectures and demonstrations as well as creating a street painting with students as an instructional lesson on perspective during the event. Wenner had started the first street painting festival in the United States more than 25 years previously.&lt;ref name="Ed Bertha"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://realallthingsrealestate.com/2011/11/kurt-wenner-interview/#more-17413|title= Kurt Wenner Anamorphic Chalk|author= Ed Bertha|date= November 17, 2011|work= allthingsrealestate.com|publisher= Real Magazine|accessdate= November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.srqmagazine.com/issues/issueDetail.cfm?iteID=1672|title= Drawing the Line|author= Ogles, Jacob|date= October 1, 2011|work= SRQ Magazine|publisher= SRQ Media Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutch artist [[Leon Keer]] returned to the festival and, along with other members of Planet Street Painting, executed a 3-D depiction of China's Terracotta Army in Lego. This piece attracted international media attention including videos &lt;ref&gt;[http://sarasotaday.com/blog.cfm?BLOGID=6&amp;BlogTypeID=6 ''Sarasota Chalk Festival''], images and link to a video (''no real than you are'') on the painting, The Art Whisperer, Sarasota Day, September 12, 1012&lt;/ref&gt; on the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/feb/01/3d-street-art|title= 3-D street art: a question of perspective|author= Jonathon Jones|date= February 1, 2012|work = guardian.co.uk|publisher= Guardian|accessdate= July 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dutchdailynews.com/dutch-artists-create-3d-street-painting/|title= Dutch artists create 3-D street painting in Florida|author= Dutch Daily News|date= Nov 13, 2012|work = Dutchdailynews.com|publisher= Dutch Daily News|accessdate= July 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was painted in conjunction with the appearance of a 9-feet-tall Lego man, by artist [[Ego Leonard]], that washed up on Siesta Key in Sarasota on October 25, 2011 with the words, "No Real Than You Are", emblazoned on his green T-shirt. The giant Lego man was "arrested" on charges of "loitering" by the Sarasota County sheriff,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/26/giant-lego-man-florida_n_1032597.html|title= Giant Lego Man Washes Ashore:Did Artist Ego Leonard Leave Toy Figure on Florida's Siesta Key?|author= Huff Post|date= October 26, 2011|work = huffingtonpost.com|publisher= Huffington Post|accessdate= October 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20111101/ARTICLE/111109970|title= Lego men hit the bricks for Sarasota Chalk Festival|author= Thomas Becnel|date= November 1, 2011|work= Heraldtribune.com|publisher= Sarasota Herald Tribune|accessdate= November 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many attempts were made to release Ego Leonard in time for him to attend the festival. Unfortunately, these attempts failed and he missed the entire festival. The sheriff stated that the sculpture must be kept for ninety days so that its owner had time to claim it. With no one coming forward as his owner, finally, he was released to Denise Kowal after the ninety-day period had elapsed. Ego Leonard stayed in Sarasota at historic Burns Square until July 2012, when he "swam" to Los Angeles, California where he was invited to show his artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20120718/ARTICLE/120719601?tc=ar|title= Lego Man leaves Sarasota for California|author= Caroline Bowman|date= July 18, 2012|work=Heraldtribune.com|publisher=Sarasota Herald Tribune|accessdate=July 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another monumental 3-D installation created at the festival was a 30' x 60' opera set by the Baltimore artist, Michael Kirby. The piece was a mix of 3-D art painting and real props and it was created for a performance of ''Madame Butterfly'' by the Sarasota Opera. This undertaking was the first of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.lbknews.com/2011/10/20/sarasota-is-first-city-to-feature-chalk-set-opera/|title= Sarasota is First City to Feature Chalk-Set Opera|author= Karen O'Dowd|date= October 20, 2011|work= lbknews.com|publisher= Longboat Key News|accessdate= October 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the many monumental 3-D installations at the festival others included, 
a 30' x 60' piece entitled ''Avatar'' by German artist Gregor Wosik, 
a 15' x 20' piece depicting mermaids by USA artist Melanie Stimmell, 
a 15' x 15' piece entitled ''Four Continents'' by USA artist Julie Kirk-Purcell, 
a 15' x 30' circus piece by Spanish artist Eduardo Relero, 
a 15' x 20' piece entitled ''Books'' by Brazilian artist Eduardo Kobra,&lt;ref&gt;Ngebgebgenm ''[http://www.nhenhenhem.com/noticias/eduardo-kobra-e-premiado-no-sarasota-chalk-festival-2553.html Eduardo Kobra é premiado no Sarasota Chalk Festival]'', October 11, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

a 12' x 24' piece entitled ''Pirate Ship'' by USA artists Wayne and Cheryl Renshaw, and 
a 15' x 30' piece entitled ''Skatepark'' by USA artist Rod Tryon.

'''''Cellograff'''''

The 2011 festival introduced ''Cellograff'' to the United States. It is a form of graffiti executed on [[cellophane]] wrapped between poles. More than five of these temporary installations were created by iKanoGrafik.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.tampabay.com/features/visualarts/sarasota-chalk-festival-should-draw-big-crowds/1199508|title= Sarasota Chalk Festival Should Draw Big Crowds|author= Bennet, Lennie|date= November 3, 2011|work= tampabay.com|publisher= St. Petersburg Times|accessdate= November 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Going Vertical'''''

The 2011 Sarasota Chalk Festival also added ''Going Vertical'' as an additional feature of the festival and invited [[graffiti]] artists and [[mural]]ists from around the world to participate.&lt;ref name="ticketsarasota.com"&gt;Weingarten, Abby, [http://ticketsarasota.com/2012-10-04/section/nightlife/going-vertical-extends-the-chalk-festival-off-the-streets/ “Going Vertical” extends the Chalk Festival off the streets], Sarasota Herald-Tribune, Ticket, Thursday, October 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; French artist [[MTO (muralist)|MTO]] from Berlin,&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.flickr.com/photos/mto-graff/ Street art and murals by MTO]'', Flicker, accessed 2012.10.12&lt;/ref&gt; Kanos, Astros, and Katre from France, ChorBoggie and Max Ehrman from California, Eduardo Kobra from Brazil,&lt;ref&gt;LaHurd, Jeff, ''[http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20120318/ARTICLE/120319541 The hustle and bustle of Sarasota's golden age]'', Sarasota Herald Tribune, March 18, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/galeriandre/docs/portfolio_eduardo_kobra Portfolio Eduardo Kobra], Issuu, May 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; A mural depicting a historic scene of the busy downtown in Sarasota at the turn of the twentieth century was created by Eduardo Kobra that covered the entire eastern side of a prominent building in Burns Square. It has become the background for photographs of the main events and primary drawings of each succeeding festival. Anat Ronan, Sunny Miller from Lafayette, Indiana, Dutch artist Remko Van Schaik, and many regional artists including Truman Adams completed works in different areas of the city. The artists were assigned to create murals on the walls of several buildings selected in the city, including both private and public properties, but visually accessible to the public. The pieces were created in cooperation with the artists, the city, and the property owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://sarasota.patch.com/articles/chalk-festival-is-going-vertical|author= William Mansell|title= Chalk Festival is Going Vertical|date= November 3, 2011|work= sarasota.patch.com|publisher= Sarasota Patch|accessdate= February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the festival, on November 30, the architect and the city held a reception atop its dramatic new parking garage on Palm Avenue to celebrate the murals that had been painted on each of its five floors as part of ''Going Vertical''. Each floor has a unique mural celebrating the arts in Sarasota, representing dance, film, music, opera, and theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sarasotagov.com/InsideCityGovernment/Content/CAC/Communications/Releases/Garage_murals.htm|author= City of Sarasota|title= Palm Avenue Murals|date= November 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schelle, Charles, ''[http://sarasota.patch.com/articles/city-celebrates-murals-at-palm-avenue-garage#photo-8559428 City Celebrates Murals at Palm Avenue Garage]'', Sarasota Patch, December 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The garage murals were funded through a public art fund that is created with donations required of the developers of new buildings in the city who do not provide public art for their project.

===&amp;nbsp;— 2012&amp;nbsp;— Circus City USA ===

In January 2012 the dates of that year's annual event were announced on the festival's web site as, October 28 through November 6, and the theme, ''Circus City, USA'', was declared. The theme of the festival was chosen to celebrate the 1920s in Sarasota, when the city became the winter home of the [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus|Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus]].

Throughout the year announcements of celebrity artists and performers who would be featured included Sarasota resident and tight rope walker [[Nik Wallenda]], [[Three-dimensional space|3-D pavement art]] innovator [[Kurt Wenner]], Ego Army artist [[Leon Keer]], and Sword-swallower [[Johnny Fox (performer)|Johnny Fox]]. Performers from Circus Sarasota, Sailor Circus, Big Cat Habitat, and Fuzion Dance were scheduled to participate. The 2012 festival also would feature international acrobats and performers alongside the artworks and two life-size sculptures of [[Indian elephants]], as well as two performance stages and a music stage.

A publisher of several local newspapers created a free, forty-page '''[[Sarasota Observer|guide to the ten-day festival]]''' ''(right)'' that provided a map of the 2012 festival, a timeline for its events, articles featuring most of the special events, documentation of donors and volunteers, as well as a history of the festival and the street art it presents.[http://www.yourobserver.com/content/2012-Chalk-Festival-342.html] This free publication was made available in the [[Sarasota Observer]], at many local stores and venues throughout the county, at the offices of the festival, and it was handed to attendees as they entered the festival gates as well as at refreshment and souvenir sales booths among the artworks on the street. The Observer is a newspaper that is distributed for free at newsstands, museums, libraries, government offices, stores, and sidewalk literature boxes in neighborhoods throughout the county.

International coverage of the 2012 festival began with the start of the three-dimensional artwork and this news report, ''Chalk street art festival heads to Florida'', discusses the Kurt Wenner piece extensively.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtqdBPqYYw ''Chalk street art festival heads to Florida''], jn1, November 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous videos about the 2012 chalk festival, have been released in the United States and various native countries of the artists, as well as by fans and producers of similar festivals.

'''''Ego Leonard''''', who appeared on a Sarasota beach in 2011 and became ranked as the ''Number 2'' ''oddball story of the year 2011'' according to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', was featured at the festival. He missed last year during his protective custody "incarceration" by the Sarasota county sheriff.

'''''Snowflake''''' and '''''Surus''''', two life-sized sculptures of [[Indian elephants]], were created to mark the entrances to the festival. They quickly became a favorite of the crowds. After the close of the festival, they were retained on the private property of the founder of the festival, at her historic building that was built by [[Owen Burns]] at the point defining the Burns Square section of town that hosts the festival each year. The elephant pair took on a life of their own, becoming a community favorite for photographs and regular visits. When removed for restoration before being integrated into the 2013 festival, they became a topic of concern,&lt;ref&gt;Favorite, Merab, [http://sarasota.patch.com/groups/around-town/p/where-did-the-elephants-go?ncid=newsltuspatc00000001&amp;evar4=picks-1-post&amp;newsRef=true&amp;yPos=0 ''Where Did the Elephants in Burns Court Square Go?''], Sarasota Patch, News Around Town, Thursday, August 1, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; until reassurances that they would return were published.

'''''Going Vertical''''' also accompanied the festival in 2012 for a second season with Pixel Pancho, Entes y Pesimo, [[MTO (muralist)|MTO]], and many more national and international street artists participating.&lt;ref name="ticketsarasota.com"/&gt; Many dramatic and colorful murals were created and under the leadership of its manager, [[Kafi Benz]], the project expanded to include a mural in Manatee County. The final mural of the 2012 project, ''Go, Go, Denise, Go!'', was painted in December by MTO and featured an image of the chalk festival director as a [[boxer]], presumably in response to the skirmishes in which she acted to defend the street artists when a few people criticized the cutting-edge-street-art nature of some of the artwork,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Jessi, [http://www.thisweekinsarasota.com/get-a-ringside-seat-mto-is-not-pulling-any-punches-in-his-latest-mural/ ''Get a ringside seat: MTO is not pulling any punches in his latest mural''], This Week in Sarasota, December 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and about which MTO produced a [[Documentary film|documentary movie]], ''FL: unpremeditated movie'',&lt;ref&gt;MTO, [http://vimeo.com/59805736 ''FL: unpremeditated movie''], 2013, Berlin, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; that was released in March 2013.

The festival and the murals received accolades in the community and planning for the 2013 season began quickly in January with conferences with city officials about early approvals for essential logistical details for the event scheduled for mid-November.

===&amp;nbsp;— 2013&amp;nbsp;— Legacy of valor ===

Honoring [[veterans]] for the 2013 Chalk Festival was suggested by its official photographer since 2011 and a veteran of the [[Vietnam War]], David Taylor. Choosing the suggestion enabled the festival to receive a sponsorship by the Patterson Foundation, [http://www.thepattersonfoundation.org/] which donated extensive additions to the [[Sarasota National Cemetery]] and kicked off its celebrations leading up to the opening of the planned amphitheater. [http://www.thepattersonfoundation.org/about/faq/faq-sarasota-cemetery.html] Partnering with the foundation resulted in the adoption of its theme, ''Legacy of Valor: honoring veterans, inspiring patriotism, and embracing freedom'' and planning on the adaptation to events scheduled for the festival began. [http://www.yourobserver.com/news/sarasota/Front-Page/0405201326168/Patterson-Foundation-launches-Legacy-of-Valor-camp] The poster for 2013 ''(right)'' carries the festival theme to a universal level, emphasizing the "heart" felt by veterans, support personnel, and citizens alike in a legacy of valor.

More than 500 artists and thousands of people participated in the event embracing the theme as the festival began on November 13 and lasted six days through November 18.

The festival announced in July that it would expand significantly farther to the north for 2013, doubling its area, and the Sarasota Observer provided a [[map]] with a [[diagram]] of the new areas of Pineapple Avenue that would host portions of the event.&lt;ref&gt;Gnaegy, Mallory, [http://www.yourobserver.com/news/sarasota/Front-Page/0730201328320/Sarasota-Chalk-Festival-to-cover-more-ground-in-fe ''Sarasota Chalk Festival to cover more ground in fewer days''], [[Sarasota Observer]], Tuesday, July 30, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The event extended across Main Street in the heart of downtown, past Five Points Park, to First Street. The southerly boundary of the festival remained in Burns Square where South Pineapple Avenue converges with South Orange Avenue.

[[Sculpture]] was featured at the festival again, but in a grander scale. A minimalist sculpture garden based on the Sarasota National Cemetery was featured prominently at one section of the festival, taking up an entire block that to emphasize the solemnity of the sacrifice fallen veterans made for their country. The garden consisted of [[headstones]] and [[memorial]] features. Participation by festival goers was planned to honor veterans known or related to them as well as to all working to defend the country throughout its existence, including [[Rosie the Riveter]]! Ceremonies in the garden were held throughout each day, ending with "[[Taps]]" at dusk.

In August the festival responded to the extensive concern in the community about the two elephant sculptures being removed from Burns Square by explaining that they would return and be integrated into the 2013 festival.&lt;ref&gt;Favorite, Merab, [http://sarasota.patch.com/groups/around-town/p/where-did-the-elephants-go?ncid=newsltuspatc00000001&amp;evar4=picks-1-post&amp;newsRef=true&amp;yPos=0 ''Where did the Elephants in Burns Square Go?''], Sarasota Patch, August 1, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lbknews.com/2013/08/10/elephant-statues-downtown-moved-to-kowals-building/ ''Elephant Statues downtown moved to Kowal's building''], Longboat Key News, August 10, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In September the festival organization made an announcement that a curated exhibition of studio artworks by major artists participating in the chalk festival and ''Going Vertical'', ''Reimagining the Sarasota Chalk Festival Artists'', was planned.&lt;ref&gt;Krapcheva, Elena, ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHffz2ntuAU Re-Imagining Sarasota Chalk Artists Art Nov.15-24 at the Ice House]'', video of preparations for the exhibit and the opening&lt;/ref&gt; Although recognized as street artists, their studio works also hang in museums around the world. Some of these studio works were featured and available for sale during the chalk festival as the premier exhibit on tenth street of the Ice House.&lt;ref&gt;Alfstad&amp;, [http://www.alfstadand.com/press2/press_091913/ ''Reimagining the Sarasota Chalk Festival Artists''], September 19, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greater Sarasota Chamber of Commerce, [http://www.sarasotachamber.com/events/eventdetail.aspx?EventID=1561 ''Reimagining Sarasota Chalk Artist Art Exhibition and Sale''], ''Sarasota News and Events'', November, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gnaegy, Mallory, [http://www.yourobserver.com/news/diversions/A-and-E/1106201330218/Gallery-and-exhibition-space-opens-in-Rosemary-Dis ''Gallery and exhibition space opens in Rosemary District''], Sarasota Observer, November 6, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The VIP premier opening event was November 12, 2013 and the closing event of the festival November 17, 2013. Shortly after the close of the exhibit, many of these paintings became featured at the '''Sarasota Chalk Festival gift shop and gallery''', opened at 529 South Pineapple Avenue. The shop is connected to the festival office at 530 South Orange Avenue via a passage through the historic building and it will remain open throughout the year.

During the first week of November the [[Sarasota Observer]] published a complete guide to the 2013 festival and distributed it within its weekly paper edition. This was the second year the free publication issued a guide to the festival. It featured a map of the festival events and their locations as well as articles on many aspects of the festival. Distribution at the festival and to many outlets in the city made the guide available to visitors.

The November 22, 2013 Sarasota News Leader published a nine-page spread of images from the festival &lt;ref&gt;[http://newsleader.uberflip.com/i/215277/107 ''The 2013 Chalk Festival Features Multi-hued Tributes to the Nation's Heroes''], Sarasota News Leader, November 22, 2013, pages 108-117&lt;/ref&gt; and the publication also featured one of the drawings, portraying John F. Kennedy, on its cover.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsleader.uberflip.com/i/215277 Cover with image from Sarasota Chalk Festival], Sarasota News Leader, November 22, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Going Vertical''''' projects and associated chalk festival events occurred throughout the year. The first mural painted for the 2013 festival season, however, appeared during the end of October on the long, western wall of the Ice House. The mural was painted by JBAK,[http://www.jbakonline.com/JBAKonline.com/about.html] which is the team of James Bullough and Addison Karl.&lt;ref&gt;McFadden, Stephen, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYMjWOXLGPM ''2013 Sarasota Chalk Festival: JBAK], video published October 25, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; They are known internationally for combining the vastly different styles into one painting. The final mural of the season, "Road Trip 2" by MTO,&lt;ref&gt;''[http://urbanitewebzine.com/2013/11/29/mtos-road-trips-in-sarasota-and-miami-florida/ MTO’s Road Trips In Sarasota and Miami, Florida]'', Urbanite, November 29, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.en.ozartsetc.com/2013/12/03/mto-road-trip-part-2-new-mural-florida-usa/ MTO – Road Trip Part 2 New Mural @ Florida, USA]'', Ozarts Etc, December 3, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; was painted on the northern wall of The Players Theatre.[http://www.theplayers.org/] It was completed on November 27.

===&amp;nbsp;— 2014&amp;nbsp;— Extinct and Endangered Species ===

The 2014 festival moved to Venice, Florida after six seasons in Sarasota, Florida, USA. The founder, Denise Kowal, organized artists from around the world to create a Guinness World Record for the Largest Anamorphic (3d) Pavement Art in the world. Kurt Wenner, the innovator of the 3d pavement art form created the design composed of 11 square sectors, each sector was 42 feet on a side and composed of 14 tiles- three feet square each. This makes a total footage of 19,404 square feet. Wenner wrote Kowal, "As I was composing the work I became very aware of the implications of the size. It is really an almost impossible task. A single extra row of plain (unbroken) tiles painted around the work would put this size over 22,000 square feet." The artists led by Julie Kirk-Purcell, one of the first female pioneers of the art form, finished the piece in 11 days with one rain day.  Artists even added fossils in the rocks and signed their names to make the 1/4 mile walk around the painting interesting to viewers. The final measurements was measured at 22,747.6 square feet by Strayer Survey &amp; Mapping in accordance with the National Surveying Standards meeting the accuracy standards required for the record.

In February 2015 [[Guinness World Records]], the global authority on record-breaking achievements, announced that the Sarasota Chalk Festival, a 501c3 nonprofit cultural arts organization, secured the title for the 'Largest Anamorphic Pavement Art' in the world during the November 2014 Chalk Festival in Venice, Florida, U.S.A. Anamorphic (3D) pavement art that involves tricking the brain into seeing something rise above or sink below a flat surface was invented by KURT WENNER in 1982 by combining traditional street painting with his classical training and understanding of illusion.

Artists traveled from all over the world to participate, including past record holders, Remko van Schaik from the Netherlands, Marion Ruthardt, Gregor Wosik and Lydia Hitzfeld from Germany. Other notable pavement artists included Matthew May from the Netherlands, Roberto Carlos Treviño Rodriguez, Carlosalberto Gh, Adry del Rocío and Ruben Arriaga from Mexico, Frederike Fredda Wouters from Germany, Tomoteru ToMo Saito from Japan, Alex Maksiov from Ukraine, JM Navello from France, Vera Bugatti, Ketty Grossi, Luigi Legno, Tony Cuboliquido and FabioFedele ItalianStreetpainting from Italy, Philippenzo Madonnaro, Darya Sharova and Victorio Puzzini from Russia, Sergio Nino from Columbia, Sharyn Chan Namnath, Genna Panzarella, Lori A. Escalera, Lorelle Miller from California, Cathy Gallatin and Mera Oliveria from Oregon, Anat Ronen from Texas, Kitty K Dyble Thompson from Wisconsin, Craig Thomas from Missouri, David Brancato, Jane Durandj, Ilona Fries, Julie Graden, Jamie Sealander, Janet Tombros, Michele Rayner-Altenbernd and Michele Michelle Clinton from Florida. The attempt was made possible because of hundreds of people that included the support of all the artists, volunteers, visitors and major sponsors such as the City of Venice, Fairfield Inn &amp; Suites of Venice, Sharky's On The Pier, Suncoast Air Center, Safway Scaffolding, Sherwin Williams Paint, Pro Paint, Venice Fire Department, LandShark Lager, Venice Gondolier Sun, Clothesline Tees and Kenyon Kowal.

In the [[United States]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] women are more than twice as likely as [[White (people)|White]] women, [[Asian people|Asian]] women, and [[Black (people)|Black]] women to experience [[sexual violence]]. 
 
The [[FBI]] investigates the crime and the office of the [[United States Attorney]] decides whether to prosecute In order to protect victims on reservations.

Recognizing sovereignty and affording Native tribes the right to prosecute non-Natives who commit crimes against Native Americans on reservations has been called an extremely important first step in a series of legal changes that would affect how these violations are responded to and viewed at the community, state, and federal level.

== Amnesty International's "Maze of Injustice" Report ==
[[Amnesty International]] published "Maze of Injustice: the failure to protect indigenous women from sexual violence in the USA"&lt;ref name="sourceamne"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/pdfs/mazeofinjustice.pdf|title=Maze of Injustice: the failure to protect indigenous women from sexual violence in the USA|publisher=Amnesty International|year=2007|location=New York, NY|pages=|chapter=|access-date=July 31, 2018|author=|editor=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, 
in order to represent the voices of survivors of sexual violence. The research was done for the report in 2005 and 2006 in three different locations with different policing and juridical arrangements. Those locations include [[Standing Rock Indian Reservation|Standing Rock Sioux Reservation]] in North and South Dakota, state of Oklahoma, and the state of Alaska&lt;ref name="sourceamne"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/pdfs/mazeofinjustice.pdf|title=Maze of Injustice: the failure to protect indigenous women from sexual violence in the USA|publisher=Amnesty International|year=2007|location=New York, NY|pages=|chapter=|access-date=July 31, 2018|author=|editor=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Amnesty International interviewed victims of sexual assault, tribal, state, and federal law enforcement officials, prosecutors and tribal judges for the report. While finding officials to interview for the report, the Executive Office of US Attorneys told them individual US attorneys cannot participate in the survey.

The report opens with the story of a young Alaskan Native woman raped by a non-native man. In July 2006, the woman was raped and rushed to the ER where she was treated as a drunk. They later sent her to a non-native shelter for women where she was also treated as a drunk because of her trauma (Maze of Injustice, 1). Most Native women don't report their assaults because of the fear nothing will be done.  Another story that the article reported was the story of a 21-year Native women who was raped by four men in later died in 2003. The case was closed because of questioning of jurisdictions (Maze of Injustice, 6). Each women that shared her story in the report had a common element in their stories. The injustice these women faced were mainly based on stereotypes. Rather their trials took place on a Federal or State level the women were viewed as drunks and some blame was put on them.

When pursuing justice women go through a maze between tribal, state and federal law. The women are first asked "was it in our jurisdiction and was the perpetrator Native American?" when they first contact the police department. It takes a lot of time just to have your case heard so women give up (Maze of Injustice 8). ''The Amnesty International'' report go on to list reasons why they believe these injustices are occurring. The first reason for injustice described is the lack of training and delay or failure to respond of police officers (Maze of Injustice, 41). If the police officers are not the first to respond the women lose confidence in pursuing a case against the perpetrators. The next reasons for injustice presented are issues within each level of the US's legal system. The lack of justice for Native women's sexual abuse within the tribal level is the lack of funding from the government. Also, the federal government limits the number of prison sentences tribal courts can make. The federal government also prohibits tribal courts to prosecute Non-Native suspects because of the 1978 Oliphant v. Suquamish case. On a federal level the issue of discrimination and limitations on prosecution of sexual assault is a reason for injustice. Things are a little more complicated on a States level. The distance of courts, language barriers, lack of funding for prosecution, and cultural competency are main causes of injustice for Native victims on a State level (Maze of Injustice 63-67).

''The Amnesty International'' gives their audiences suggestions as to how to stop violence against Indigenous women. Some of their recommendations include: "Federal and state governments should take effective measures, in consultation and co-operation with Native American and Alaska Native peoples, to combat prejudice and eliminate stereotyping of and discrimination against Indigenous peoples. The federal government should take steps – including by providing sufficient funding – to ensure the full implementation of the 2005 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, particularly Title IX (Tribal Programs). Law enforcement agencies should recognize in policy and practice that all police officers have the authority to take action in response to reports of sexual violence, including rape, within their jurisdiction and to apprehend the alleged perpetrators in order to transfer them to the appropriate authorities for investigation and prosecution. In particular, where sexual violence is committed in Indian Country and in Alaska Native villages, tribal law enforcement officials must be recognized as having the authority to apprehend both Native and non-Native suspects. Federal authorities should ensure that tribal police forces have access to federal funding to enable them to recruit, train, equip and retain sufficient law enforcement officers to provide adequate law enforcement coverage which is responsive to the needs of the Indigenous peoples they serve." ( Maze of Injustice 84-87).

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Sudden infant death syndrome''' ('''SIDS'''), also known as '''cot death''' or '''crib death''', is the sudden unexplained [[death]] of a child less than one year of age.&lt;ref name=NIH2013Def&gt;{{cite web|title=Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS): Overview|url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/sids/Pages/default.aspx|website=National Institute of Child Health and Human Development|accessdate=9 March 2015|date=27 June 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223190134/http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/sids/Pages/default.aspx|archivedate=23 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diagnosis requires that the death remains unexplained even after a thorough [[autopsy]] and detailed death scene investigation.&lt;ref name=CDC2013Diag&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/sids/|title=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Sudden Infant Death|accessdate=March 13, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318045725/http://www.cdc.gov/sids/|archivedate=March 18, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; SIDS usually occurs during [[sleep]].&lt;ref name=Kin2009/&gt; Typically death occurs between the hours of 00:00 and 09:00.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Optiz|first1=Enid Gilbert-Barness, Diane E.

&lt;!-- Prevention --&gt;
The most effective method of reducing the risk of SIDS is putting a child less than one year old on their back to sleep.&lt;ref name=NIH2013Epi/&gt; Other measures include a firm mattress separate from but close to caregivers, no loose bedding, a relatively cool sleeping environment, using a [[pacifier]], and avoiding exposure to tobacco smoke.&lt;ref name=Moon2012&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Moon RY, Fu L | title = Sudden infant death syndrome: an update. | journal = Pediatrics in Review | volume = 33 | issue = 7 | pages = 314–20 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22753789 | doi = 10.1542/pir.33-7-314 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Breastfeeding]] and [[immunization]] may also be preventive.&lt;ref name=Moon2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=NIH2014Pre/&gt; Measures not shown to be useful include positioning devices and [[baby monitors]].&lt;ref name=Moon2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=NIH2014Pre&gt;{{cite web|title=How can I reduce the risk of SIDS?|url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/sids/conditioninfo/pages/reduce-risk.aspx|website=National Institute of Child Health and Human Development|accessdate=9 March 2015|date=22 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227031841/http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/sids/conditioninfo/pages/reduce-risk.aspx|archivedate=27 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence is not sufficient for the use of fans.&lt;ref name=Moon2012/&gt; Grief support for families affected by SIDS is important, as the death of the infant is sudden, without witnesses, and often associated with an investigation.&lt;ref name=Kin2009/&gt;

==Definition==
SIDS is a [[diagnosis of exclusion]] and should be applied to only those cases in which an infant's death is sudden and unexpected, and remains unexplained after the performance of an adequate [[postmortem]] investigation, including:
# an [[autopsy]] (by an experienced pediatric [[pathologist]], if possible);
# investigation of the death scene and circumstances of the death;
# exploration of the [[medical history]] of the infant and family.

After investigation, some of these infant deaths are found to be caused by accidental suffocation, [[hyperthermia]] or [[hypothermia]], neglect or some other defined cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/sids/aboutsuidandsids.htm |title=Sudden Unexpected Infant Death and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome: About SUID and SIDS |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=April 16, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420200947/http://www.cdc.gov/sids/aboutsuidandsids.htm |archivedate=April 20, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia and New Zealand are shifting to the term "sudden unexpected death in infancy" (SUDI) for professional, scientific, and coronial clarity.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The term SUDI is now often used instead of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) because some coroners prefer to use the term 'undetermined' for a death previously considered to be SIDS. This change is causing diagnostic shift in the mortality data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/0/5118C5C5561CEC79CC2573A6000B3BBE NZ Ministry of Health] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212171003/http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/0/5118C5C5561CEC79CC2573A6000B3BBE |date=December 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; In addition, the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) has recently proposed that such deaths be called "sudden unexpected infant deaths" (SUID) and that SIDS is a subset of SUID.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/sids/pdf/sudden-unexpected-infant-death.pdf |title=Sudden Unexpected Infant Death |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=April 16, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513173510/http://www.cdc.gov/sids/pdf/sudden-unexpected-infant-death.pdf |archivedate=May 13, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age===
SIDS has a 4-parameter [[lognormal]] [[age distribution]] that spares infants shortly after birth — the time of maximal risk for almost all other causes of non-trauma infant death.

By definition, SIDS deaths occur under the age of one year, with the peak incidence occurring when the infant is at 2 to 4 months of age. This is considered a critical period because the infant's ability to rouse from sleep is not yet mature.&lt;ref name=Kin2009/&gt;

==Risk factors==
The cause of SIDS is unknown. Although studies have identified risk factors for SIDS, such as putting infants to bed on their stomachs, there has been little understanding of the syndrome's biological process or its potential causes. The frequency of SIDS does appear to be influenced by social, economic, and cultural factors, such as maternal education, race or ethnicity, and poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Pickett, KE, Luo, Y, Lauderdale, DS.  Widening Social Inequalities in Risk for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. ''Am J Public Health'' 2005;94(11):1976–1981. {{DOI|10.2105/AJPH.2004.059063}}&lt;/ref&gt; SIDS is believed to occur when an infant with an underlying biological vulnerability, who is at a critical development age, is exposed to an external trigger.&lt;ref name=Kin2009/&gt; The following risk factors generally contribute either to the underlying biological vulnerability or represent an external trigger:

===Tobacco smoke===

===Genetics===
[[Genetics]] plays a role, as SIDS is more prevalent in males.&lt;ref name="wonderANDwho"&gt;See [http://wonder.cdc.gov CDC WONDER online database] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100424201355/http://wonder.cdc.gov/ |date=2010-04-24 }} and {{cite web |url=http://www3.who.int/whosis/menu.cfm?path=whosis,inds,mort&amp;language=english |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-03-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040627063703/http://www3.who.int/whosis/menu.cfm?path=whosis,inds,mort&amp;language=english |archivedate=2004-06-27 |df= }} for data on SIDS by gender in the US and throughout the world.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mage DT, Donner EM 2004 1210–5"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mage DT, Donner EM | title = The fifty percent male excess of infant respiratory mortality | journal = Acta Paediatr. | volume = 93 | issue = 9 | pages = 1210–5 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15384886 | doi = 10.1080/08035250410031305 | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0803-5253&amp;date=2004&amp;volume=93&amp;issue=9&amp;spage=1210 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a consistent 50% male excess in SIDS per 1000 live births of each sex. Given a 5% male excess birth rate, there appears to be 3.15 male SIDS cases per 2 female, for a male fraction of 0.61.&lt;ref name="wonderANDwho"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mage DT, Donner EM 2004 1210–5"/&gt; This value of 61% in the US is an average of 57% black male SIDS, 62.2% white male SIDS and 59.4% for all other races combined. Note that when multiracial parentage is involved, infant race is arbitrarily assigned to one category or the other; most often it is chosen by the mother. The [[sex linkage|X-linkage]] hypothesis for SIDS and the male excess in infant mortality have shown that the 50% male excess could be related to a dominant X-linked [[allele]], occurring with a frequency of {{Frac|1|3}} that is protective of [[Cerebral hypoxia|transient cerebral anoxia]]. An unprotected male would occur with a frequency of {{Frac|2|3}} and an unprotected female would occur with a frequency of {{Frac|4|9}}.

About 10 to 20% of SIDS cases are believed to be due to [[channelopathies]], which are inherited defects in the [[ion channels]] which play an important role in the contraction of the heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Behere|first1=SP|last2=Weindling|first2=SN|title=Inherited arrhythmias: The cardiac channelopathies.|journal=Annals of Pediatric Cardiology|date=2014|volume=8|issue=3|pages=210–20|pmid=26556967|doi=10.4103/0974-2069.164695|pmc=4608198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SIDS has been linked to cold weather with this association believed to be due to over bundling and thus overheating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NIH alerts caregivers to increase in SIDS risk during cold weather |url=https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-alerts-caregivers-increase-sids-risk-during-cold-weather |website=National Institutes of Health (NIH) |accessdate=27 July 2018 |language=en |date=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1998 report found that antimony- and phosphorus-containing compounds used as fire retardants in [[PVC]] and other cot mattress materials are not a cause of SIDS.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://web.archive.org/web/20001026033455/http://www.sids.org.uk/fsid/limerick.htm FSID Press release].&lt;/ref&gt; The report also states that toxic gas cannot be generated from antimony in mattresses and that babies suffered SIDS on mattresses that did not contain the compound.

A set of risk factors SIS has been identified with: increasing SIDS rate with live birth order; low increased risk of SIDS in subsequent siblings of SIDS; apparent life-threatening events (ALTE) are not a risk factor for subsequent SIDS; SIDS risk is greatest during sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mage DT, Donner EM |title=Is SIDS at Borkmann's Point? |journal=[[Medical Hypotheses]] |volume=1 |issue=2/3 |pages=131–7 |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}

For example, an infant with MCAD deficiency could have died by "classical SIDS" if found swaddled and prone with head covered in an overheated room where [[smoking and pregnancy|parents were smoking]]. Genes indicating susceptibility to MCAD and Long QT syndrome do not protect an infant from dying of classical SIDS. Therefore, presence of a susceptibility gene, such as for MCAD, means the infant may have died either from SIDS or from MCAD deficiency. It is currently impossible for the pathologist to distinguish between them.

A 2010 study looked at 554 autopsies of infants in [[North Carolina]] that listed SIDS as the cause of death, and suggested that many of these deaths may have been due to accidental suffocation.  The study found that 69% of autopsies listed other possible risk factors that could have led to death, such as unsafe bedding or sleeping with adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/sids/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811030214/http://www.charlotteobserver.com/sids/ |archivedate=2011-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have underestimated the risk of two SIDS deaths occurring in the same family and the [[Royal Statistical Society]] issued a media release refuting this expert testimony in one UK case in which the conviction was subsequently overturned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rss.org.uk/main.asp?page=1225 "About Statistics and the Law"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070902044706/http://www.rss.org.uk/main.asp?page=1225 |date=2007-09-02 }} (Website).

Sleeping on the back has been found to reduce the risk of SIDS.&lt;ref name=Mitch2009&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mitchell EA | title = SIDS: past, present and future. | journal = Acta Paediatrica | volume = 98 | issue = 11 | pages = 1712–9 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19807704 | doi = 10.1111/j.1651-2227.2009.01503.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus recommended by the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] and promoted as a best practice by the US [[National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]] (NICHD) "[[Safe to Sleep]]" campaign. The incidence of SIDS has fallen in a number of countries in which this recommendation has been widely adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mitchell EA, Hutchison L, Stewart AW | title = The continuing decline in SIDS mortality | journal = Arch Dis Child | volume = 92 | issue = 7 | pages = 625–6 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17405855 | pmc = 2083749 | doi = 10.1136/adc.2007.116194 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sleeping on the back does not appear to increase the risk of choking even in those with [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]].&lt;ref name=Moon2012/&gt; While infants in this position may sleep more lightly this is not harmful.&lt;ref name=Moon2012/&gt; Sharing the same room as one's parents but in a different bed may decrease the risk by half.&lt;ref name=Moon2012/&gt;

===Pacifiers===
The use of [[pacifier]]s appears to decrease the risk of SIDS although the reason is unclear.&lt;ref name=Moon2012/&gt; The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] considers pacifier use to prevent SIDS to be reasonable.&lt;ref name=Moon2012/&gt; Pacifiers do not appear to affect breastfeeding in the first four months, even though this is a common misconception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jaafar|first=Sharifah Halimah|last2=Ho|first2=Jacqueline J.|last3=Jahanfar|first3=Shayesteh|last4=Angolkar|first4=Mubashir|date=2016-08-30|title=Effect of restricted pacifier use in breastfeeding term infants for increasing duration of breastfeeding|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=8|pages=CD007202|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007202.pub4|issn=1469-493X|pmid=27572944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bedding===
Product safety experts advise against using pillows, overly soft mattresses, sleep positioners, bumper pads (crib bumpers), stuffed animals, or fluffy bedding in the crib and recommend instead dressing the child warmly and keeping the crib "naked."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |title=What Can Be Done?  |publisher=American SIDS Institute  |url=http://www.sids.org/nprevent.htm  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030621224728/http://www.sids.org/nprevent.htm  |archivedate=2003-06-21  |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blankets or other clothing should not be placed over a baby's head.&lt;ref name=AAP2016Guid&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Task Force on Sudden Infant Death|last1=Syndrome|title=SIDS and Other Sleep-Related Infant Deaths: Updated 2016 Recommendations for a Safe Infant Sleeping Environment|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2016/10/20/peds.2016-2938|journal=Pediatrics|date=24 October 2016|issn=0031-4005|pages=e20162938|doi=10.1542/peds.2016-2938|volume=138|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025013544/http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2016/10/20/peds.2016-2938|archivedate=25 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sleep sacks===
In colder environments where bedding is required to maintain a baby's body temperature, the use of a "[[Sleeping bag#Infant use|baby sleep bag]]" or "sleep sack" is becoming more popular. This is a soft bag with holes for the baby's arms and head. A zipper allows the bag to be closed around the baby. A study published in the ''European Journal of Pediatrics'' in August 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=L'Hoir MP, Engelberts AC, van Well GT, McClelland S, Westers P, Dandachli T, Mellenbergh GJ, Wolters WH, Huber J | title = Risk and preventive factors for cot death in The Netherlands, a low-incidence country | journal = Eur. J. Pediatr. | volume = 157 | issue = 8 | pages = 681–8 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9727856 | doi = 10.1007/s004310050911 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has shown the protective effects of a sleep sack as reducing the incidence of turning from back to front during sleep, reinforcing putting a baby to sleep on its back for placement into the sleep sack and preventing bedding from coming up over the face which leads to increased temperature and carbon dioxide rebreathing. They conclude in their study, "The use of a sleeping-sack should be particularly promoted for infants with a low birth weight." The American Academy of Pediatrics also recommends them as a type of bedding that warms the baby without covering its head.&lt;ref name="aap_sacks"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Changing Concept of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome: Diagnostic Coding Shifts, Controversies Regarding the Sleeping Environment, and New Variables to Consider in Reducing Risk |publisher=[[American Academy of Pediatrics]] |accessdate=2008-11-06 |url=http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;116/5/1245#SEC15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203234922/http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics%3B116/5/1245#SEC15 |archivedate=3 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vaccination===
A large investigation into [[DPT vaccine|diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccination]] and potential SIDS association by Berlin School of Public Health, Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin concluded: "Increased DTP immunisation coverage is associated with decreased SIDS mortality. Current recommendations on timely DTP immunisation should be emphasised to prevent not only specific infectious diseases but also potentially SIDS."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Müller-Nordhorn|first1=Jacqueline|last2=Hettler-Chen|first2=Chih-Mei|last3=Keil|first3=Thomas|last4=Muckelbauer|first4=Rebecca|title=Association between sudden infant death syndrome and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis immunisation: an ecological study|journal=BMC Pediatrics|date=28 January 2015|volume=15|issue=1|doi=10.1186/s12887-015-0318-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other studies have also reached conclusions that vaccinations reduce the risk of SIDS. Studies generally show that SIDS risk is approximately halved by vaccinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mitchell|first1=E A|last2=Stewart|first2=A W|last3=Clements|first3=M|title=Immunisation and the sudden infant death syndrome.

==Management==
Families who are impacted by SIDS should be offered emotional support and grief counseling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Adams SM, Good MW, Defranco GM | title = Sudden infant death syndrome | journal = Am Fam Physician | volume = 79 | issue = 10 | pages = 870–4 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19496386 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The experience and manifestation of grief at the loss of an infant are impacted by cultural and individual differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Koopmans L, Wilson T, Cacciatore J, etal |title=Support for mothers, fathers and families after perinatal death |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |date=Jun 13, 2013 |volume=6 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000452.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Globally SIDS resulted in about 22,000 deaths {{as of|2010|lc=y}}, down from 30,000 deaths in 1990.&lt;ref name=Loz2012&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Lozano R, Naghavi M, Foreman K, Lim S, Shibuya K, Aboyans V, Abraham J, Adair T, Aggarwal R, Ahn SY, etal | title = Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and 2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010. | journal = Lancet | volume = 380 | issue = 9859 | pages = 2095–128 | date = Dec 15, 2012 | pmid = 23245604 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61728-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rates vary significantly by population from 0.05 per 1000 in Hong Kong to 6.7 per 1000 in American Indians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sharma BR | title = Sudden infant death syndrome: a subject of medicolegal research. | journal = The American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 69–72 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17325469 | doi = 10.1097/01.paf.0000220934.18700.ef }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SIDS was responsible for 0.54 deaths per 1,000 live births in the US in 2005.&lt;ref name=wonder&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wonder.cdc.gov |title=Cdc Wonder |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) |date=2010-02-24 |accessdate=2010-04-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100424201355/http://wonder.cdc.gov/ |archivedate=2010-04-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is responsible for far fewer deaths than congenital disorders and disorders related to short gestation, though it is the leading cause of death in healthy infants after one month of age.

SIDS deaths in the US decreased from 4,895 in 1992 to 2,247 in 2004.&lt;ref name=Bowman07&gt;Bowman L, Hargrove T. Exposing Sudden Infant Death In America. Scripps Howard News Service. {{cite web |url=http://dailycamera.com/news/2007/oct/08/saving-babies-exposing-sudden-infant-death-in/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226153439/http://www.dailycamera.com/news/2007/oct/08/saving-babies-exposing-sudden-infant-death-in/ |archivedate=2009-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; But, during a similar time period, 1989 to 2004, SIDS being listed as the cause of death for sudden infant death (SID) decreased from 80% to 55%.&lt;ref name=Bowman07/&gt; According to John Kattwinkel, chairman of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Special Task Force on SIDS "A lot of us are concerned that the rate (of SIDS) isn't decreasing significantly, but that a lot of it is just code shifting".&lt;ref name=Bowman07/&gt;

===Race===

[[File:US SIDS rates race 2009.png|thumb|Rates of SIDS by race/ethnicity in the U.S., 2009, CDC, 2013]]

In 2013, there are persistent disparities in SIDS deaths among racial and ethnic groups in the U.S. In 2009, the rates of death range from 20.3 per 100,000 live births for Asian/Pacific Islander to 119.2 per 100,000 live births for American Indians/Alaska Native. African American infants have a 24% greater risk of having a SIDS related death&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Powers|first1=D. A.|last2=Song|first2=S.|title=Absolute change in cause-specific infant mortality for blacks and whites in the US: 1983–2002|journal=tion Research and Policy Review|date=2009|volume=28|issue=6|pages=817–851|doi=10.1007/s11113-009-9130-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and experience a 2.5 greater incidence of SIDS than in Caucasian infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pollack|first1=H. A.|last2=Frohna|first2=J. G.|title=A competing risk model of sudden infant death syndrome incidence in two US birth cohorts|journal=The Journal of Pediatrics|date=2001|volume=138|issue=5|pages=661–667|doi=10.1067/mpd.2001.112248|pmid=11343040}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rates are per 100,000 live births and enable more accurate comparison across groups of different total population size.

Research suggests that factors which contribute more directly to SIDS risk—maternal age, exposure to smoking, safe sleep practices, etc.—vary by racial and ethnic group and therefore risk exposure also varies by these groups.&lt;ref name=Kin2009/&gt; Risk factors associated with prone sleeping patterns of African American families include mother's age, household poverty index, rural/urban status of residence, and infant's age. More than 50% of African American infants were placed in non-recommended sleeping positions according to a study completed in South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6829">'''The Baby-Roast''', also known as '''The Hippy Babysitter''' and '''The Cooked Baby''',&lt;ref name="Brunvand"/&gt; is an [[urban legend]] in which a baby is roasted alive at home, usually during the absence of a parent. ''[[The Straight Dope]]'', a newspaper column devoted to exposing myths, reported that it "is one of the classic urban legends",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=February 3, 1984 |url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/194/did-a-stoned-babysitter-once-microwave-a-baby |title=Did a stoned babysitter once microwave a baby? |publisher=''[[The Straight Dope]]'' }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, there have been real life instances where babies have been roasted.

==Plot==
In some versions, the baby is accidentally cooked when miscommunication occurs. For example, "put the turkey in the oven and the baby in the bed" is wrongly heard as "put the baby in the oven and the turkey in the bed".&lt;ref name="Brunvand"/&gt; Other variants set out that the doer of the deed was drug or alcohol-induced or an insane individual.&lt;ref name="Brunvand2001"/&gt; In the end, the roasted baby is sometimes served as food to be consumed by the parents.&lt;ref name="Brunvand2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jan Harold Brunvand|authorlink=Jan Harold Brunvand|title=The Truth Never Stands in the Way of a Good Story|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PhkINW48_J0C&amp;pg=PA55|year=2001|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-07004-4|pages=55–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The person who roasts the baby is usually a babysitter or the baby's sibling.&lt;ref name="Brunvand"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jan Harold Brunvand|authorlink=Jan Harold Brunvand|title=Encyclopedia of Urban Legends|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H8Kk7bS66jMC&amp;pg=PA26|date=1 January 2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-076-5|pages=26–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Documented occurrences==
In real life, there have been documented occurrences of babies being roasted, though by family members instead of strange babysitters.  When Virginian Elizabeth Renee Otte roasted her baby in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mother Charged in Baby's Death |last=Timberg|first=Craig|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/daily/sept99/microwave.htm|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=September 28, 1999|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the incident was cited as causing the legend to become true. In November 2006, a second case of real-life baby-roasting was reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/11/28/mom_microwaves_baby/ |title=Mom cooks baby in microwave oven - police |date=November 28, 2006 |first=Thomas C. |last=Greene |newspaper=[[The Register]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, Ka Yang of California was charged with roasting her seven-week-old baby to death in a microwave. In her defence, she claimed she was having a "seizure fit" when it happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2104988/Mother-accused-murdering-baby-putting-microwave-minutes-face-trial.html |title=Mother 'burned her baby to death in microwave because she was having a seizure fit' |date=February 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012, a British citizen was arrested by Thai police after being found in possession of six corpses of roasted infants, some wrapped in [[gold leaf]], reportedly in conformity with a "black magic ritual".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/05/18/11755862-thai-police-arrest-man-after-babies-bodies-found-roasted-wrapped-in-gold-leaf?lite |title=Thai police arrest man after babies' bodies found roasted, wrapped in gold leaf |date=May 12, 2013 |newspaper=msn }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Siberia]] in January 2013, a roasted, dismembered baby was found by its mother, the alleged perpetrator being the infant's intoxicated uncle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2267723/Mother-finds-dead-baby-daughter-roasting-oven-chopped-drunk-uncle.html |last=Stewart |first=Will |title=Drunk uncle 'chopped up 18-month-old niece then roasted body parts in the oven' while looking after toddler for her mother |date=January 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 16, 2015, a one-year old baby, J'Zyra Thompson, died after her three-year-old sibling put her in the oven and cooked her alive. Their mother, Racqual Thompson, left her four kids at home, which included a five-year-old and a two-year-old, when she went to pick up a pizza. When they returned home, Thompson found J'Zyra's body cooked in the oven. Thompson and her boyfriend of ten months, 21-year-old Cornell Malone, were charged with endangering a child and are awaiting trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fox5dc.com/news/national/55113771-story |last=Damali |first=Keith |title=Mother speaks only on FOX after baby dies in oven |date=November 20, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, a 35-year-old mother in Texas showed up naked at her neighbor's door with her partially burned and naked 2-year-old daughter. When police arrived, she confessed that she had put the girl in the oven along with a cat she had recently shot dead, while making sexual advances toward an officer and singing praise to God. According to an affidavit from the [[Texas Department of Family and Protective Services]], she seemed unconcerned with her daughter while in hospital and jail, where she was charged with injury to a child with serious bodily injury and tested positive for alcohol, marijuana and methamphetamine. The girl was put in foster care.&lt;ref&gt;[http://crimeblog.dallasnews.com/2016/03/mother-who-put-daughter-in-oven.html/ "Glen Rose mother was high before she put daughter in oven, officials say", by Claire Z. Cardona, ''Dallas News Crime Blog'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the 1979 [[blaxploitation]] film ''[[Disco Godfather|Avenging Disco Godfather]]'', a [[Phencyclidine|PCP]] addict claims to have honey-roasted her baby for her family's [[Easter]] dinner, ostensibly so the baby's crying wouldn't spoil the occasion.

In August 2009, a joke advertisement showcasing a "body part roaster" "specially designed to roast infants and other human morsels" surfaced on the website of retailer [[Sears.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/08/21/sears_baby_roaster/ |newspaper=[[The Register]] |date=August 21, 2009 |last=Goodin |first=Dan |title=Baby-roasting BBQ pulled from Sears site }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song 'Babysitter on Acid' by the all-female punk rock band, [[Lunachicks]] is a retelling of the Urban Legend. The teenage babysitter, under the influence of drugs, roasts the baby in the oven and tells the mother over the phone that "Wanna know how the baby is? / Don't worry, she's almost done". The song was released on their 1990 album ''[[Babysitters On Acid]]''.

'''The Crystal Palace''' was a [[cast iron|cast-iron]] and [[plate glass|plate-glass]] structure originally built in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], [[London]], to house the [[Great Exhibition]] of 1851. More than 14,000 exhibitors from around the world gathered in its {{convert|990000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} exhibition space to display examples of technology developed in the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Designed by [[Joseph Paxton]], the Great Exhibition building was {{convert|1851|ft|m|0}} long, with an interior height of {{convert|128|ft|m|0}}.&lt;ref name="oregon"&gt;{{cite web

It has been suggested that the name of the building resulted from a piece penned by the playwright [[Douglas Jerrold]], who in July 1850 wrote in the satirical magazine ''[[Punch magazine|Punch]]'' about the forthcoming Great Exhibition, referring to a "palace of very crystal".&lt;ref&gt;The ''Punch'' issue of 13 July 1850 carried a contribution by Douglas Jerrold, writing as Mrs Amelia Mouser, which referred to a ''palace of very crystal''.{{cite book | title  =''Douglas Jerrold'' | first= Professor Michael | last = Slater | publisher= Duckworth | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-7156-2824-0 | page =243 | location = London}}. In fact the term "Crystal Palace" itself is used seven times in the same issue of Punch (pages iii. iv, 154, 183 (twice), 214 (twice) and 224. It seems clear, however, that the term was already in use and did not need much explanation.    Other sources refer to the 2 November 1850 ''Punch'' issue bestowing the "Crystal Palace" name on the design by {{cite book | title  = Nineteenth-Century European Art: A Topical Dictionary | first = Terry  | last = Strieter | isbn = 0-313-29898-X| page = 50 | year = 1999 | publisher=Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Conn.}} (And {{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2004/08/10/cp_dinosaur_feature.shtml |title=Crystal Palace |quote=The term 'Crystal Palace' was first applied to Paxton's building by Punch in its issue of 2 November 1850 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=21 November 2007 }}.) Punch had originally sided with ''The Times'' against the exhibition committee's proposal of a fixed brick structure, but featured the Crystal Palace heavily throughout 1851 (for example in {{cite web |title=Punch Issue 502 |url=http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/luceneweb/hri3/display.jsp?mode=sciper&amp;file=PU1-20.html&amp;reveal=issue_PU1-20-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420155504/http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/luceneweb/hri3/display.jsp?mode=sciper&amp;file=PU1-20.html&amp;reveal=issue_PU1-20-17 |archivedate=20 April 2006 |df=dmy-all }} included the article "Travels into the Interior of the Crystal Palace" of February 1851). Any earlier name has been lost, according to {{cite web |year=2003 |title=Everything2 ''Crystal Palace'' Exhibition Building Design #251 |url=http://everything2.com/index.pl?node=Crystal%20Palace }}. The use by Mrs Mouser was picked up by a reference in [[The Leader (English newspaper)|''The Leader'']], no. 17, 20 July 1850 (p. 1): "In more than one country we notice active preparations for sending inanimate representatives of trade and industry to take up their abode in the crystal palace which Mr.Paxton is to build for the Exposition of 1851."

After the exhibition, it was decided to relocate the Palace to an area of South London known as Penge Common. It was rebuilt at the top of Penge Peak next to [[Sydenham Hill]], an affluent suburb of large villas. It stood there for 82 years from 1854 until its destruction by fire in November 1936. The nearby residential area was renamed [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] after the landmark including the [[Crystal Palace Park|park]] that surrounds the site, home of the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre]], which had previously been a football stadium that hosted the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Crystal Palace FA Cup Finals 1895.E2.80.931914|FA Cup Final]] between 1895 and 1914. [[Crystal Palace F.C.]] were founded at the site in 1905 and played at the Cup Final venue in their early years. The park still contains [[Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins]]'s [[Crystal Palace Dinosaurs]] which date back to 1854.

The Commission in charge of mounting the Great Exhibition was established in January 1850, and it was decided at the outset that the entire project would be funded by public subscription. An executive Building Committee was quickly formed to oversee the design and construction of the exhibition building, comprising [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], [[Robert Stephenson]], renowned architects [[Charles Barry]] and [[Thomas Leverton Donaldson]], the [[Duke of Buccleuch]] and the [[Earl of Ellesmere]], and chaired by [[William Cubitt]]. By 15 March 1850 they were ready to invite submissions, which had to conform to several key specifications: the building had to be temporary, simple, as cheap as possible, and economical to build within the short time remaining before the Exhibition opening, which had already been scheduled for 1 May 1851.&lt;ref name="Kate Colquhoun 2004"&gt;Kate Colquhoun, ''A Thing In Disguise: The Visionary Life of Joseph Paxton'' (Harper Collins, 2004), Ch. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Within three weeks, the committee had received some 245 entries, including 38 international submissions from Australia, the Netherlands, Belgium, Hanover, Switzerland, Brunswick, Hamburg and France. Two designs, both in iron and glass, were singled out for praise—one by [[Richard Turner (iron-founder)|Richard Turner]], co-designer of the [[Palm House]] at Kew, and the other by French architect Hector Horeau &lt;ref name=hrh&gt;{{cite book |title=Architecture:Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries |last= Hitchcock|first=Henry-Russell |authorlink=Henry-Russell Hitchcock |coauthors= |year=1977 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=Harmondsworth |isbn=0-14-056115-3 |page=184 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but despite the great number of submissions, the Committee rejected them all. Turner was furious at the rejection, and reportedly badgered the commissioners for months afterwards, seeking compensation, but at an estimated £300,000, his design (like Horeau's) was too expensive.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Colquhoun, ''A Thing In Disguise: The Visionary Life of Joseph Paxton'' (Harper Collins, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; As a last resort the committee came up with a standby design of its own, for a brick building in the ''[[rundbogenstil]]'' by Donaldson, featuring a sheet-iron dome designed by Brunel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/1851/7.html|title=The Committee's design for a structure to house the Great Exhibition.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was widely criticized and ridiculed when it was published in the newspapers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crystalpalacefoundation.org.uk/history/history-of-the-crystal-palace-part-1|title=History of the Crystal Palace (part 1)|author=Jeremy Walker|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adding to the Committee's woes, the site for the Exhibition was still not confirmed; the preferred site was in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], adjacent to Princes Gate near Kensington Rd, but other sites considered included [[Wormwood Scrubs]], [[Battersea Park]], the [[Isle of Dogs]], [[Victoria Park, London|Victoria Park]] and [[Regent's Park]]. Opponents of the scheme lobbied strenuously against the use of Hyde Park (and they were strongly supported by ''[[The Times]]''). The most outspoken critic was arch-conservative Col. [[Charles de Laet Waldo Sibthorp]]; he denounced the Exhibition as "one of the greatest humbugs, frauds and absurdities ever known",&lt;ref name="Kate Colquhoun 2004"/&gt; and his trenchant opposition to both the Exhibition and its building continued even after it had closed.

[[File:Gtexhib.jpg|thumb|Joseph Paxton's first sketch for the Great Exhibition Building, about 1850, pen and ink on blotting paper, V&amp;A Museum]]
At this point renowned gardener [[Joseph Paxton]] became interested in the project, and with the enthusiastic backing of Commission member [[Henry Cole]], he decided to submit his own design. At this time, Paxton was chiefly known for his celebrated career as the head gardener for the [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire|6th Duke of Devonshire]] at [[Chatsworth House]], and by 1850 he had become a preeminent figure in British horticulture and had also earned great renown as a freelance garden designer; his works included the pioneering public gardens at [[Birkenhead Park]] which directly influenced [[Frederick Law Olmsted#New York City's Central Park|the design of New York's Central Park]]. At Chatsworth, Paxton had experimented extensively with glasshouse construction, developing many novel techniques for modular construction, using combinations of standard-sized sheets of glass, [[laminated wood]], and prefabricated cast iron. The "Great Stove" (or conservatory) at Chatsworth (built in 1836) was the first major application of Paxton's ridge-and-furrow roof design, and was at the time the largest glass building in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/victorian/art/architecture/iron/21b.html|title=The Great Stove, Chatsworth|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; covering around 28,000 square feet (2600 sq.m.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/art/architecture/iron/21b.html|title=The Great Stove, Chatsworth|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A decade later, taking advantage of the availability of the new [[cast plate glass]], Paxton further developed his techniques with the Chatsworth Lily House, which featured a flat-roof version of the ridge-and-furrow glazing, and a [[curtain wall (architecture)|curtain wall]] system that allowed the hanging of vertical bays of glass from cantilevered beams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=725 Engineering Timelines - Chatsworth Conservatory and Lily House] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304203626/http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=725 |date=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lily House was built specifically to house the giant ''[[Victoria amazonica]]'' waterlily which had only recently been discovered by European botanists; the first specimen to reach England was originally kept at [[Kew Gardens]], but it did not do well. Paxton's reputation as a gardener was so high by that time that he was invited to take the lily to Chatsworth; it thrived under his care and in 1849 he caused a sensation in the horticultural world when he succeeded in producing the first ''amazonica'' flowers to be grown in England (his daughter Alice was drawn for the newspapers, standing on one of leaves). The lily and its house led directly to Paxton's design for the Crystal Palace and he later cited the huge ribbed floating leaves as a key inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virtualherbarium.org/gardenviews/victoriaamazonica.html Jennifer Davit, "Victoria: The Reigning Queen of Waterlilies", Virtual Herbarium] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001651/http://www.virtualherbarium.org/gardenviews/victoriaamazonica.html |date=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paxton left his meeting with Henry Cole on 9 June 1850 fired with enthusiasm. He immediately went to Hyde Park, where he 'walked' the site earmarked for the Exhibition. Two days later, on 11 June, while attending a board meeting of the Midland Railway, Paxton made his original concept drawing, which he doodled onto a sheet of pink [[blotting paper]]. This rough sketch (now in the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]]) incorporated all the basic features of the finished building, and it is a mark of Paxton's ingenuity and industriousness that detailed plans, calculations and costings were ready to submit in less than two weeks    .

The project was a major gamble for Paxton, but circumstances were in his favour: he enjoyed a stellar reputation as a garden designer and builder, he was confident that his design was perfectly suited to the brief, and the Commission was now under enormous pressure to choose a design and get it built, the Exhibition opening now being less than a year away. In the event, Paxton's design fulfilled and surpassed all the requirements, and it proved to be vastly faster and cheaper to build than any other form of building of a comparable size. Indeed, his submission was budgeted at a remarkably low £85,800; by comparison, this was about 2-1/2 times more than the Great Stove at Chatsworth&lt;ref&gt;"Paxton and the Great Stove", ''Architectural History'', Vol. 4, (1961), pp. 77-92&lt;/ref&gt; but it was only 28% of the estimated cost of Turner's design, and it promised a building which, with a footprint of over 770,000 sq.ft. (19 acres, or 7 hectares), would cover roughly twenty-five times the ground area of its progenitor.

Impressed by the low bid for the construction contract submitted by the engineering firm [[Fox, Henderson and Co]], the commission accepted the scheme and finally gave its public endorsement to Paxton's design in July 1850. He was exultant, but now had less than eight months to finalize his plans, manufacture the parts and erect the building in time for the Exhibition's opening, which was scheduled for 1 May 1851. Paxton was able to design and build the largest glass structure yet created, from scratch, in less than a year, and complete it on schedule and on budget. He was even able to alter the design shortly before building began, adding a high, barrel-vaulted [[transept]] across the centre of the building, at 90 degrees to the main gallery, under which he was able to safely enclose several large elm trees that would otherwise have had to be felled—thereby also resolving a controversial issue that had been a major sticking point for the vocal anti-Exhibition lobby.

Paxton's modular, hierarchical design reflected his practical brilliance as a designer and problem-solver. It incorporated many breakthroughs, offered practical advantages that no conventional building could match and, above all, embodied the spirit of British innovation and industrial might that the Great Exhibition was intended to celebrate.

The geometry of the Crystal Palace was a classic example of the concept of form following manufacturer's limitations: the shape and size of the whole building was directly based around the size of the panes of glass made by the supplier, [[Chance Brothers]] of Smethwick. These were the largest available at the time, measuring 10 inches wide by 49 inches long. Because the entire building was scaled around those dimensions, it meant that nearly the whole outer surface could be glazed using millions of identical panes, thereby drastically reducing both their production cost and the time needed to install them.

The original Hyde Park building was essentially a vast, flat-roofed rectangular hall. A huge open gallery ran along the main axis, with wings extending down either side. The main exhibition space was two stories high, with the upper floor stepped in from the boundary. Most of the building had a flat-profile roof, except for the central transept, which was covered by a 72 foot wide barrel-vaulted roof that stood 168
feet high at the top of the arch. Both the flat-profile sections and the arched transept roof were constructed using the key element of Paxton's design: his patented ridge-and-furrow roofing system, which had first seen use at Chatsworth. The basic roofing unit, in essence, took the form of a long triangular prism, which made it both extremely light and very strong, and meant it could be built with the minimum amount of materials.

Paxton set the dimensions of this prism by using the length of single pane of glass (49 inches) as the [[hypotenuse]] of a right-angled triangle, thereby creating a triangle with a length-to-height ratio of 2.5:1, whose base (adjacent side) was 4 feet long. By mirroring this triangle he obtained the 8-foot-wide gables that formed the vertical faces at either end of the prism, each of which was 24' long. With this arrangement, Paxton could glaze the entire roof surface with identical panes that did not need to be trimmed. Paxton placed three of these 8' x 24' roof units side-by-side, horizontally supported by a grid of cast iron beams, which was held up on slim cast iron pillars. The resulting cube, with a floor area of 24'x 24', formed the basic structural module of the building.

By multiplying these modules into a grid, the structure could be extended virtually infinitely. In its original form, the ground level of the Crystal Palace (in plan) measured 1848' x 456', which equates to a grid 77 modules long by 19 modules wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/london/model/geo.html|title=water|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because each module was self-supporting, Paxton was able to leave out modules in some areas, creating larger square or rectangular spaces within the building to accommodate larger exhibits. On the lower level these larger spaces were covered by the floor above, and on the upper level by longer spans of roofing, but the dimensions of these larger spaces were always multiples of the basic 24' x 24' grid unit. The modules were also strong enough to be stacked vertically, enabling Paxton to add an upper floor that nearly doubled the amount of available exhibition space. Paxton also used longer trellis girders to create a clear span for the roof of the immense central gallery, which was 72 feet wide and 1800 feet long.
[[File:Crystal Palace - plan.jpg|thumb|380px|Plan of the Crystal Palace]]
Paxton's roofing system incorporated his elegant solution to the problem of draining the building's vast roof area. Like the Chatsworth Lily House (but unlike its later incarnation at Sydenham) most of the roof of the original Hyde Park structure had a horizontal profile, so heavy rain posed a potentially serious safety hazard. Because normal cast glass is brittle and has low tensile strength, there was a risk that the weight of any excess water build-up on the roof might have caused panes to shatter, showering shards of glass onto the patrons, ruining the valuable exhibits beneath, and weakening the structure. However, Paxton's ridge-and-furrow roof was designed to shed water very efficiently. Rain ran off the angled glass roof panes into U-shaped cast-iron channels which ran the length of each roof section at the bottom of the 'furrow'. These channels were ingeniously multifunctional. During construction, they served as the rails that supported and guided the trolleys on which the glaziers sat as they installed the roofing. Once completed, the channels acted both as the joists that supported the roof sections, and as guttering—a patented design now widely known as a "Paxton gutter". These gutters conducted the rainwater to the ends of each furrow, where they emptied into the larger main gutters, which were set at right angles to the smaller gutters, along the top of the main horizontal roof bearers. These main gutters drained at either end into the cast iron pillars, which also had an ingenious dual function: each was cast with a hollow core, allowing it to double as a concealed down-pipe that carried the storm-water down into the drains beneath the building.

One of the few issues Paxton could not completely solve was leaks—when completed, rain was found to be leaking into the huge building in over a thousand places. The leaks were sealed with putty, but the relatively poor quality of the sealant materials available at the time meant that the problem was never totally overcome.

To maintain a comfortable temperature inside such a large glass building was another major challenge, because the Great Exhibition took place decades before the introduction of mains electricity and air-conditioning. Glasshouses rely on the fact that they accumulate and retain heat from the sun, but such heat buildup would have been a major problem for the Exhibition, and this would have been exacerbated by the heat produced by the thousands of people who would be in the building at any given time. Paxton solved this with two clever strategies. One was to install external canvas shade-cloths that were stretched across the roof ridges. These served multiple functions: they reduced heat transmission, moderated and softened the light coming into the building, and acted as a primitive evaporative cooling system when water was sprayed onto them. The other part of the solution was Paxton's ingenious ventilation system. Each of the modules that formed the outer walls of the building was fitted with a prefabricated set of louvres that could be opened and closed using a gear mechanism, allowing hot stale air to escape. The flooring consisted of boards 22&amp;nbsp;cm (9 inches) wide, which were spaced about 1&amp;nbsp;cm apart; together with the louvres, this formed an effective passive air-conditioning system. Due to the pressure differential, the hot air escaping from the louvres generated a constant airflow that drew cooler air up through the gaps in the floor. The floor too had a dual function: the gaps between the boards acted as a grating that allowed dust and small pieces of refuse to fall or be swept through them onto the ground beneath, where it was collected daily by a team of cleaning boys. Paxton also designed machines to sweep the floors at the end of each day, but in practice, it was found that the trailing skirts of the female visitors did the job perfectly.&lt;ref name="bl.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item106135.html|title=Sketch for the Crystal Palace|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks to the considerable economies of scale Paxton was able to exploit, the manufacture and assembly of the building parts was exceedingly quick and cheap. Each module was identical, fully prefabricated, self-supporting, and fast and easy to erect. All of the parts could be mass-produced in large numbers, and many parts served multiple functions, further reducing both the number of parts needed and their overall cost. Because of its comparatively low weight, the Crystal Palace required absolutely no heavy masonry for supporting walls or foundations, and the relatively light concrete footings on which it stood could be left in the ground once the building was removed (they remain in place today just beneath the surface of the site). The modules could be erected as quickly as the parts could reach the site—indeed, some sections were standing within eighteen hours of leaving the factory—and since each unit was self-supporting, workers were able to assemble much of the building section-by-section, without having to wait for other parts to be finished.

=== Construction ===
[[File:Crystal Palace - interior.jpg|thumb|Interior of the Crystal Palace]]
Fox, Henderson took possession of the site in July 1850 and erected wooden hoardings which were constructed using the timber that later became the floorboards of the finished building. More than 5000 [[navvy|navvies]] worked on the building during its construction, with up to 2000 on site at one time during the peak building phase.&lt;ref&gt;For the peak figure of 2,000 workers daily see: {{cite book | isbn = 0-485-11575-1 | title = The Crystal Palace and the Great Exhibition | page = 34 | author=Hermione Hobhouse. | year = 2002 | publisher=Athlone | location = London }} and the University of Virginia's {{cite web | url =

More than 1,000 iron columns supported 2,224 trellis girders and 30 miles of guttering, comprising 4,000 tons of iron in all.&lt;ref name="bl.uk"/&gt;

First, stakes were driven into the ground to roughly mark out the positions for the cast iron columns; these points were then set precisely by [[theodolite]] measurements. Then the concrete foundations were poured, and the base plates for the columns were set into them. Once the foundations were in place, the erection of the modules proceeded rapidly. Connector brackets were attached to the top of each column before erection, and these were then hoisted into position. Since the project took place before the development of powered cranes, the raising of the columns was done manually using [[Shear legs|shears]] (or shear legs), a simple crane mechanism. These consisted of two strong poles, which were set several meters apart at the base and then lashed together at the top to form a triangle; this was stabilized and kept vertical by guy ropes fixed to the apex, stretched taut and tied to stakes driven into the ground some distance away. Using pulleys and ropes hung from the apex of the shear, the navvies hoisted the columns, girders and other parts into place.

As soon as two adjacent columns had been erected, a girder was hoisted into place between them and bolted onto the connectors. The columns were erected in opposite pairs, then two more girders were connected to form a self-supporting square—this was the basic frame of each module. The shears would then be moved along and an adjoining bay constructed. When a reasonable number of bays had been completed, the columns for the upper floor were erected (longer shear-legs were used for this, but the operation was essentially the same as for the ground floor). Once the ground floor structure was complete, the final assembly of the upper floor followed rapidly.

For the glazing, Paxton used larger versions of machines he had originally devised for the Great Stove at Chatsworth, installing on-site [[production line]] systems, powered by steam engines, that dressed and finished the building parts. These included a machine that mechanically grooved the wooden window sash bars, and a painting machine that automatically dipped the parts in paint and then passed them through a series of rotating brushes to remove the excess.
[[File:Crystal Palace Great Exhibition tree 1851.png|thumb|A tree enclosed within the Crystal Palace]]

The last major components to be put into place were the sixteen semi-circular ribs of the vaulted transept, which were also the only major structural parts that were made of wood. These were raised into position as eight pairs, and all were fixed into place within a week. Thanks to the simplicity of Paxton's design and the combined efficiency of the building contractor and their suppliers, the entire structure was assembled with extraordinary speed—the team of 80 glaziers could fix more than 18,000 panes of sheet glass in a week&lt;ref name="bl.uk"/&gt;—and the building was complete and ready to receive exhibits in just five months.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

When completed, The Crystal Palace provided an unrivaled space for exhibits, since it was essentially a self-supporting shell standing on slim iron columns, with no internal structural walls whatsoever. Because it was covered almost entirely in glass, it also needed no artificial lighting during the day, thereby reducing the Exhibition's running costs.

Full-size elm trees growing in the park were enclosed within the central exhibition hall near the {{convert|27|ft|m|0|adj=on}} tall Crystal Fountain. [[Sparrows]] became a nuisance; shooting was out of the question in a glass building. [[Queen Victoria]] mentioned this problem to the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], who offered the solution, "[[Eurasian sparrowhawk|Sparrowhawk]]s, Ma'am".

Paxton was acclaimed worldwide for his achievement, and was knighted by Queen Victoria in recognition of his work. The project was engineered by [[William Cubitt|Sir William Cubitt]]; Paxton's construction partner was the ironwork contractor [[Charles Fox (civil and railway engineer)|Sir Charles Fox]]'s Fox and Henderson, whose director Charles Fox was also knighted for his contribution. The 900,000 square feet (84,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of glass was provided by the [[Chance Brothers]] glassworks in [[Smethwick]]. They were the only glassworks capable of fulfilling such a large order and had to bring in labour from France to meet it in time.&lt;!--(The [[Hyde Park, London#Poem|Hyde Park]] article features a poem

{{main|The Great Exhibition}}

The Great Exhibition was opened on 1 May 1851 by [[Queen Victoria]]. It was the first of the [[World's Fair]] exhibitions of culture and industry. There were some 100,000 objects, displayed along more than ten miles, by over 15,000 contributors.&lt;ref name="british library"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/histcitizen/victorians/exhibition/greatexhibition.html |title=The Great Exhibition |work=The British Library }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Britain occupied half the display space inside with exhibits from the home country and the Empire. France was the largest foreign contributor.  The exhibits were grouped into four main categories—Raw Materials, Machinery, Manufacturers and Fine Arts. The exhibits ranged from the [[Koh-i-Noor]] diamond, [[Sevres porcelain]] and [[Organ (music)|music organs]] to a massive hydraulic press and a fire-engine. There was also a 27-foot tall Crystal Fountain.

In the first week, the prices were £1;then reduced to 5 shillings for the next three weeks, a price which still effectively limited entrance to middle-class and aristocratic visitors. The working classes finally came to the exhibition on Monday 26 May, when weekday prices were reduced to one shilling (although the price was two shillings and sixpence on Fridays, and still 5 shillings on Saturdays).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wJdDAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=%22exhibition%20of%201851%22&amp;pg=PA85#v=onepage&amp;q=%22exhibition%20of%201851%22&amp;f=false|title=...

The Crystal Palace had the first major installation of [[public toilet]]s,&lt;ref name="bounce"&gt;{{cite book| title= Why does a ball bounce?: 101 questions you never thought of asking |first= Adam |last= Hart-Davis |publisher=Firefly Books |date= 3 October 2005 |isbn= 978-1-55407-113-5 |page = 59 |chapter= 25.

=== Relocation and redesign ===
The life of the Great Exhibition was limited to six months, after which something had to be done with the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.crystalpalacefoundation.org.uk/history/default.asp?ID=10 | title = Crystal Palace history ''Leaving Hyde Park'' October 1851 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110927144920/http://www.crystalpalacefoundation.org.uk/history/default.asp?ID=10 | archivedate = 27 September 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Against the wishes of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliamentary]] opponents, a consortium of eight businessmen including [[Samuel Laing (science writer)|Samuel Laing]] and [[Leo Schuster]] who were both board members of the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway|London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&amp;SCR)]], formed a suitable holding company and proposed that the edifice be erected on a property named Penge Place that had been excised from [[Penge Common]] at the top of [[Sydenham Hill]].&lt;ref name="dukemag"/&gt;

[[File:Kristallpalast Sydenham 1851 aussen.png|thumb|left|The Crystal Palace after its move to Sydenham Hill in 1854.]]
The construction of the building began on Sydenham Hill in 1852.  The new building, while incorporating most of the constructional parts of the Hyde Park building, was so completely different in form as to be properly considered a quite different structure – a '[[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-arts]]' form in glass and metal. The main gallery was redesigned and covered with a new barrel-vaulted roof, the central transept was greatly enlarged and made even higher, and two new transepts were added at either end of the main gallery. It was modified and enlarged so much that it extended beyond the boundary of Penge Place, which was also the boundary between [[Surrey]] and [[Kent]]. The reconstruction was recorded for posterity by [[Philip Henry Delamotte]], and his photographs were widely disseminated in his published works.

Within just two years the rebuilt Palace building was complete, and on 10 June 1854, Queen Victoria again performed an opening [[ceremony]], in the presence of 40,000 guests.&lt;ref name="Peter2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gurney Peter|title=Wanting and Having: Popular politics and liberal consumerism in England, 1830-70|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RT9uDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT222|accessdate=2 December 2017|date=1 November 2015|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-1-5261-0181-5|page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several localities claim to be the area to which the building was moved. The street address of the Crystal Palace was Sydenham (SE26) after 1917, but the actual building and parklands were in Penge.  When built, most of the buildings were in the County of [[Surrey]], as were the majority of grounds, but in 1899 the county boundary was moved, transferring the entire site to [[Penge Urban District]] in Kent. The site is now within the Crystal Palace Ward of the [[London Borough of Bromley]].
[[File:Crystal Palace Park - 1857.jpg|right|thumb|An 1857 plan of the grounds of The Crystal Palace]]

Two [[railway stations]] were opened to serve the permanent exhibition:
*[[Crystal Palace (High Level) railway station|Crystal Palace High Level]]: developed by the [[London, Chatham and Dover Railway|LCDR]], it was an impressive building designed by [[Edward Middleton Barry|Edward Barry]], from which a subway under the Parade led directly to the entrance
*[[Crystal Palace railway station|Crystal Palace Low Level]]: developed by Laing and Schuster's LB&amp;SCR, it is located just off Anerley Road.

The Low Level Station is still in use as {{stnlnk|Crystal Palace}}, while the only remains of the High Level Station are the subway under the Parade with its [[Italy|Italian]] [[mosaic]] roofing, a Grade II [[listed building]].

The South Gate is served by [[Penge West Railway Station]]. For some time this station was on an [[atmospheric railway]]. This is often confused with a 550-metre pneumatic passenger railway which was exhibited at the Crystal Palace in 1864, which was known as the [[Crystal Palace pneumatic railway]].

=== Exhibitions and events ===
[[File:Handel festival QE4 99.jpg|thumb|right|Händel Festival at the Crystal Palace, 1887-1889]]
Dozens of experts such as [[Matthew Digby Wyatt]] and [[Owen Jones (architect)|Owen Jones]] were hired to create a series of courts that provided a narrative of the history of fine art. Amongst these were [[Augustus Pugin]]'s Mediaeval Court from the Great Exhibition, as well as courts illustrating [[Art of ancient Egypt|Egyptian]], [[Alhambra]], [[Roman art|Roman]], [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]], [[Pompeii|Pompeian]], and [[Ancient Greek art|Grecian]] art and many others.&lt;ref name="rebuilding"/&gt;  During the year of re-opening 18 handbooks were published in the Crystal Palace Library by Bradbury &amp; Evans as guides to the new installations. Many of these were written by the specialists involved in creating and curating the new displays. So the 1854 guide to the Egyptian Court, destroyed in the 1866 fire, was entitled: 'The Egyptian Court in the Crystal Palace. Described by Owen Jones, architect, and Joseph Bonomi, sculptor'. That which included a description of the dinosaurs was entitled: 'Geology and Inhabitants of the Ancient World. Described by Richard Owen, FRS. The animals constructed by B.W.Hawkins, FGS'. In the central transept was the 4,000-piece Grand Orchestra built around the 4,500-pipe Great Organ.  There was a concert room with over 4,000 seats that hosted successful [[Handel]] Festivals for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crystalpalacefoundation.org.uk/history/open-again-1854-2 |title=Open Again, 1854 |work=The Crystal Palace Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt; The performance spaces hosted concerts, exhibits, and public entertainment.&lt;ref name="dukemag"/&gt;

[[File:Festival of Empire 1911 Canadian Building.jpg|thumb|[[Festival of Empire]] 1911 with the Canadian Building in the foreground]]
The Centre Transept of the Crystal Palace also once housed a circus and was the scene of daring feats by acts such as the tightrope walker [[Charles Blondin]]. Over the years many world leaders visited the Crystal Palace, and were accorded special festivals, with extended published programs. That for [[Garibaldi]] was entitled "General Garibaldi's Italian Reception and Concert Saturday April 16, 1864"; and that for the [[Shah]]: "Crystal Palace. Grand Fête in  honour of His Majesty The Shah of Persia KG. Saturday July 6th" (1889).  From the beginning general programs were printed, at first for the summer season, and then on a daily basis. So for instance that for the summer of 1864 "Programme of arrangements for the eleventh season, commencing on the 1st May, 1864" included the [[Shakespeare]] Tercentenary Festival and  a course by designer [[Christopher Dresser]]. The daily "Programme for Monday October 6th (1873) included a harvest exhibition of fruit, and the Australasian Collection, formed by H E Pain, of materials from Tasmania, New Caledonia, Solomon Islands, Australia, NZ; and grand military fete was also on offer. Many of these publications were printed by Dickens and Evans, that is Charles Dickens jnr., [[Dickens]]' son working with his father-in-law Frederick Evans.  Another feature of the early programming were Christmas pantomimes, with published librettos, for instance Harry Lemon's 'Dick Whittington and His Wonderful Cat. Crystal Palace Christmas 1869–70' (London 1869).

In 1868, the world's first aeronautical exhibition was held in the Crystal Palace.  In 1871, the world's first [[cat show]], organised by [[Harrison Weir]], was held there. Other shows, such as [[Conformation show|dog shows]], pigeon shows, honey, flower shows, as well as the first national [[motor show]] were also held at the Palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.victorianstation.com/palace.html |title=The Great Exhibition at the Crystal Palace |work=The Victorian Station |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170414235432/http://victorianstation.com/palace.html |archivedate=14 April 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The match which later has been dubbed the world's first [[bandy]] match was held at the Palace in 1875; at the time, the game was called "hockey on the ice".&lt;ref name=SBF&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iof1.idrottonline.se/SvenskaBandyforbundet/Bandy-Sverige/SvenskaBandyforbundet/Historikochstatistik/Historiskamilstolpar/Bandyhistoria1875-1919/ |title=Svenska Bandyförbundet, bandyhistoria 1875–1919 |publisher=Iof1.idrottonline.se |date=1 February 2013 |accessdate=9 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019151140/http://iof1.idrottonline.se/SvenskaBandyforbundet/Bandy-Sverige/SvenskaBandyforbundet/Historikochstatistik/Historiskamilstolpar/Bandyhistoria1875-1919/ |archivedate=19 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new site was also the location of one of [[Charles Spurgeon]]'s sermons, without amplification, before a crowd of 23,654 people on 7 October 1857.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charlesspurgeon.net/page5.html "The Prince of Preachers" Live!] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305052005/http://www.charlesspurgeon.net/page5.html |date=5 March 2016 }} at charlesspurgeon.net (Dave Richards evangelical site)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, [[Robert Baden-Powell]] first noticed the interest of girls in [[Scouting]] while attending a [[1909 Crystal Palace Scout Rally|Boy Scout meeting at Crystal Palace]].

In 1911, the [[Festival of Empire]] was held at the building to mark the [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation]] of [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]. Large pavilions were built for and by the colonies, that for Canada for instance replicating the Parliament in Ottawa. A good record of the Festival is provided by the photogravure plates in the sale catalogue published shortly afterwards by Knight, Frank and Rutley and Horne &amp; Co "The Crystal Palace Sydenham To be sold at auction on Tuesday 28th November" (London, 1911)

During the First World War, it was used as a naval training establishment under the name of HMS ''Victory VI'', informally known as HMS ''Crystal Palace''. More than 125,000 men from the [[Royal Naval Division]], [[Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]] and [[Royal Naval Air Service]] were trained for war at ''Victory VI''.&lt;ref name="crystalpalacefoundation.org.uk"&gt;[http://www.crystalpalacefoundation.org.uk/crystal-palace-history/] {{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the First War World War, the Crystal Palace re-opened as the site of the first [[Imperial War Museum]]; in 1920 this major initiative was fully launched with a program as the 'Imperial War Museum and Great Victory Exhibition Crystal Palace' (published by [[Photocrom]]). A few years later the Imperial War Museum moved to South Kensington, and then in the 1930s to its present site Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park, formerly [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bedlam]].&lt;ref name="disused"/&gt;

On 15–20 October 1934 the [[Pageant of Labour]] was held at the Crystal Palace.&lt;ref&gt;''Official Book and Programme of the Pageant of Labour'', 1934&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of ground and gardens of the park cost considerably more than the rebuilt Crystal Palace. [[Edward Milner]] designed the Italian Garden and fountains, the Great Maze, and the English Landscape Garden.  Raffaele Monti was hired to design and build much of the external statuary around the fountain basins, and the urns, tazzas and vases.&lt;ref name="rebuilding"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crystalpalacefoundation.org.uk/history/the-rebuilding-at-sydenham-1852-1854-2 |title=The Rebuilding at Sydenham, 1852-1854 |work= Crystal Palace Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sculptor [[Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins]] was commissioned to make [[The Crystal Palace Dinosaurs|33 lifesized models]] of the (then) newly discovered dinosaurs and other extinct animals in the park.  The Palace and its park became the location of many shows, concerts and exhibitions, as well as sporting events after the construction of various sports grounds on the site. The [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Crystal Palace FA Cup Finals 1895.E2.80.931914|FA Cup Final]] was held here between 1895 and 1914. On the new site were also various buildings that housed educational establishments such as the [[Crystal Palace School|Crystal Palace School of Art, Science, and Literature]] as well as engineering schools.

[[File:AnerleyHill2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=.6|The Crystal Palace with one of the water towers as seen from [[Anerley]] around 1910]]
Joseph Paxton was first and foremost a gardener, and his layout of gardens, [[fountain]]s, [[Terrace (gardening)|terrace]]s and [[Plunge waterfalls|cascades]] left no doubt as to his ability. One thing he did have a problem with was water supply. Such was his enthusiasm that thousands of gallons of water were needed to feed the myriad fountains and cascades abounding in the Park: the two main jets were {{convert|250|ft|m|0}} high.  [[Water tower]]s were duly constructed, but the weight of water in the raised tanks caused them to collapse. [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] was consulted and came up with plans for two mighty water towers, one at the north end of the building and one at the south. Each supported a tremendous load of water, which was gathered from three reservoirs, at either end of and in the middle of the park. The grand fountains and cascades were opened, again in the presence of the Queen, who got wet when a gust of wind swept mists of spray over the royal carriage.

While the original palace cost £150,000 (equivalent to £{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|150000|1851|r=-4}}}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} the move to Sydenham cost £1,300,000—(£{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|1300000|1853|r=-4}}}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} burdening the company with a debt it never repaid,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.crystalpalacefoundation.org.uk/history/default.asp?ID=11 | title = Crystal Palace history'' The Building'' 1852–1854 | accessdate = 21 November 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071130233100/http://www.crystalpalacefoundation.org.uk/History/default.asp?ID=11 | archivedate = 30 November 2007 | df = dmy-all }} These amounts are in successive years, and partly reflect the extension to five stories made at Sydenham. The £150,000 cost of the Hyde Park Crystal Palace includes the (re-usable) component material cost, so the extent to which the reconstructed Palace had an (unexpectedly) higher construction cost is even greater than the comparison of totals implies.&lt;/ref&gt; partly because admission fees were depressed by the inability to cater for Sunday visitors in its early years: many people worked every day except Sunday,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/archives/m/memorial_from_the_national_sun.aspx | title = Memorial from the National Sunday League on the Sunday opening of the British Museum | quote = working men and their families [...] worked long hours and all day Saturday.

The Crystal Palace at Sydenham continued the observance, opening only to [[shareholder]]s on Sundays: {{cite web | url = http://www.crystalpalacefoundation.org.uk/History/default.asp?ID=12 | title = Crystal Palace History ''Open again'' | quote = neither the building nor grounds were open on Sundays | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071130233106/http://www.crystalpalacefoundation.org.uk/History/default.asp?ID=12 | archivedate = 30 November 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lord's Day Observance Society]] held that people should not be encouraged to work at the Palace on Sunday, and that if people wanted to visit, then their employers should give them time off during the working week. However, the Palace was eventually open on Sundays by 1860, and it was recorded that 40,000 visitors came on a Sunday in May 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1W49qPQKJEwC&amp;pg=PA59#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Palace of the People: The Crystal Palace at Sydenham 1854–1936 |author=Jan Piggott  |pages=57–59 |publisher= Hurst &amp; Co Publishers Ltd |date=2 February 2004|isbn= 978-1850657279 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1890s the Palace's popularity and state of repair had deteriorated; the appearance of stalls and booths had made it a more downmarket attraction.&lt;ref name="disused"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years after the [[Festival of Empire]] the building fell into disrepair, as the huge debt and [[Corrective maintenance|maintenance]] costs became unsustainable, and in 1911 bankruptcy was declared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2004/07/27/history_feature.shtml |title= Crystal Palace: A History |first= G. |last= Holland |date= 24 July 2004 |publisher=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914 the [[Robert Windsor-Clive, 1st Earl of Plymouth|Earl of Plymouth]] bought it to save it from the developers. A public subscription subsequently bought it from the Earl for the nation.

In the 1920s, a board of trustees was set up under the guidance of manager Sir Henry Buckland. He is said to have been a firm but fair man, who had a great love for the Crystal Palace,&lt;ref name="norwoodsociety.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web |author=The Norwood Society |url=http://www.norwoodsociety.co.uk/review/afterthefire.shtml |title=The Norwood Review |publisher=The Norwood Society |date=26 February 2008 |accessdate=17 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514145129/http://www.norwoodsociety.co.uk/review/afterthefire.shtml |archivedate=14 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and soon set about restoring the deteriorating building. The restoration not only brought visitors back, but also meant that the Palace started to make a small profit once more.&lt;ref name="crystalpalacefoundation.org.uk"/&gt; Buckland and his staff also worked on improving the fountains and gardens,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/Collections/OnlineResources/X20L/THEMES/1381/112 ]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; including the Thursday evening displays of [[fireworks]] by [[Brocks Fireworks|Brocks]].

== Destruction by fire ==
[[File:Crystal Palace fire 1936.jpg|thumb|Crystal Palace on fire, 1936]]
On 30 November 1936 came the final catastrophe – fire. Within hours the Palace was destroyed: the glow was visible across eight [[Administrative counties of England#Map 1890–1965|counties]].&lt;ref name="LifeFire"/&gt; That night, Buckland was walking his dog near the palace, with his daughter (Crystal Buckland, named after the palace&lt;ref name="LifeFire"&gt;{{cite journal |page= 34 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=PUEEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA34 |last= London

Inside, he found two of his employees fighting a small office fire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.crystalpalacefoundation.org.uk/History/default.asp?ID=6 |title= Disaster strikes |publisher= The Crystal Palace Foundation |year= 2010 |first= M. |last= Harrison |quote= The first fire brigade call was received by Penge fire station at 7:59&amp;nbsp;pm, the first fire engine arriving at 8:03.

But, even though 89 [[fire engine]]s and over 400 firemen&lt;ref&gt;http://www.20thcenturylondon.org.uk/server.php?show=conlnformationRecord.16{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; arrived they were unable to extinguish it. (The fire spread quickly in the high winds that night,&lt;ref name="burningFilm"/&gt; because it could consume the dry old timber flooring,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ideal-homes.org.uk/bromley/crystal-palace/crystal-palace-fire.htm |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20031027021134/http://www.ideal-homes.org.uk/bromley/crystal-palace/crystal-palace-fire.htm |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2003-10-27 |title= Crystal Palace On Fire, 1936 |quote= The cause of the fire that destroyed the Crystal Palace is unknown, although an electrical fault due to old wiring is suspected. }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the huge quantity of flammable materials in the building.) Buckland said, "In a few hours we have seen the end of the Crystal Palace. Yet it will live in the memories not only of Englishmen, but the whole world". 100,000 people came to Sydenham Hill to watch the blaze, among them [[Winston Churchill]], who said, "This is the end of an age".&lt;ref name="RT"&gt;{{cite web |first1=R. |last1=White |first2=J. |last2=Yorath | title=The Crystal Palace – Demise | url=http://www.whitefiles.org/b3_q/1_architecture/zqla/qla7/7_xtlplc.htm | work=The White Files – Architecture | year=2004 | accessdate=15 June 2010}} (Quotations from Yorath's original [[Radio Times]] article.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as in 1866, when the north transept burnt down, the building was not adequately insured to cover the cost of rebuilding (at least two million pounds).&lt;ref name="burningFilm"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://newsfilm.bufvc.ac.uk/article.php?story=2005100819530392 |title= British Paramount News: Crystal Palace Fire |publisher= newsfilm online |date= 30 October 1936 |quote= Film of the fire that completely destroyed the Crystal Palace. |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130511000755/http://newsfilm.bufvc.ac.uk/article.php?story=2005100819530392 |archivedate= 11 May 2013 |df= dmy-all }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The South Tower and much of the lower level of the Palace had been used for tests by television pioneer [[John Logie Baird]] for his [[mechanical television]] experiments, and much of his work was destroyed in the fire.&lt;ref name="trandsiffusion-baird"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/baird/baird_itv.php|title=Baird's independent television|last=Elen|first=Richard G|date=5 April 2003|accessdate=29 May 2008|publisher=Transdiffusion Broadcasting System|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608091708/http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/baird/baird_itv.php|archivedate=8 June 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="soundscapes-baird"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herbert|first=Ray|date=July 1998|title=Crystal Palace Television Studios|journal=Soundscapes|volume=1|issue=4|publisher=University of Groningen|location=Groningen, The Netherlands|issn=1567-7745|url =http://www.icce.rug.nl/~soundscapes/VOLUME01/Crystal_Palace.shtml|accessdate =29 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baird himself is reported to have suspected the fire was a deliberate act of sabotage against his work on developing television, but the true cause remains unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Robb, ''Quicklook at Television'' (Grittleton: Quicklook Books, 2012) p.17&lt;/ref&gt;

The last singer to perform there before the fire was the Australian ballad contralto [[Essie Ackland]].&lt;ref name=weekly&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51587380?searchTerm=&amp;searchLimits=l-publictag=Essie+Ackland Australian Women’s Weekly, 6 March 1937]&lt;/ref&gt;

Coming as it did just as the [[abdication crisis]] was reaching its terminal stage, the building's destruction was widely seen as symbolic of the end of [[King Edward VIII]]'s brief and controversial reign.

== Since the fire ==
[[File:Crystal Palace Destoyed 1936.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Crystal Palace a few days after the night of 30 November 1936; totally destroyed]]

All that was left standing after the 1936 fire were the two water towers. The south tower to the right of the Crystal Palace entrance was taken down shortly after the fire, as the damage sustained had undermined its integrity and it presented a major risk to houses nearby.

The north tower was demolished with explosives in 1941.&lt;ref name="time-north-tower"&gt;{{cite journal|date=28 April 1941|title=War's Worst Raid|journal=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,765495,00.html|accessdate=29 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pescod-north-tower"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pescod |first=David FRS |title=Correspondence |date=10 February 2005 |journal=The Linnean |volume=21 |issue=2 |page=36 |publisher=[[Linnean Society of London]] |location=London |url=http://www.linnean.org/fileadmin/images/Publications/Linnean-21-2__2__web_complete.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=29 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730041406/http://www.linnean.org/fileadmin/images/Publications/Linnean-21-2__2__web_complete.pdf |archivedate=30 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No reason was given for its removal, although it was rumoured that it was to remove a landmark for WWII German aircraft, but [[Luftwaffe]] bombers actually navigated their way to Central London by tracking the River Thames.
The Crystal Palace grounds were also used as a manufacturing base for aircraft radar screens and other hi-tech equipment of the time. This remained a secret until well after the war.

After the destruction of the Palace, the High Level Branch station fell into disuse, and was finally shut in 1954.

[[File:CPupperterraces01.jpg|thumb|Crystal Palace site: Remains of the upper terrace, 1993]]

After the war the site was used for a number of purposes. Between 1927 and 1972 the [[Crystal Palace circuit|Crystal Palace motor racing circuit]] was located in the park, supported by the [[Greater London Council]], but the [[Noise pollution#Impact of noise pollution in the UK|noise was unpopular]] with nearby residents and racing hours were soon regulated under a high court judgment.&lt;ref name="norwoodsociety.co.uk"/&gt; The [[Crystal Palace transmitting station]] was built on the former Aquarium site in the mid-1950s and still serves as one of London's main television transmission masts.

===Crystal Palace Bowl===
{{anchor|Crystal Palace Bowl}}
Between 1971 and 1980, a series of annual "Crystal Palace Garden Parties" took place in the summer months. Many established as well as aspiring pop artists made their appearances at the Crystal Palace Bowl, including [[The Beach Boys]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Melanie Safka|Melanie]], [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]], [[John Cale]], [[Carlos Santana|Santana]], [[Bob Marley]], [[The Chieftains]], and [[Golden Earring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukrockfestivals.com/Garden-party-71.html|title=Crystal palace Garden party 1971|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Future ===
Over the years, numerous proposals for the former site of the Palace have not come to fruition.
* Plans by the London Development Agency to spend £67.5&amp;nbsp;million to refurbish the site, including new homes and a regional sports centre were approved after Public Inquiry in December 2010. Before approval was announced the LDA withdrew from taking on management of the park and funding the project.
* On 27 July 2013, the Chinese company ZhongRong Holdings held early talks with the [[London Borough of Bromley]] and the [[Mayor of London]], [[Boris Johnson]], to rebuild the Crystal Palace on the north side of the park.&lt;ref name=rebuild&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC News: Plans for Crystal Palace replica|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-23475994 |date=27 July 2013 |accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the developer's sixteen-month exclusivity agreement with Bromley council to develop its plans was cancelled when it expired in February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mann |first1=Will |title=Shattered:£500M Crystal Palace rebuild plan |url=http://www.nce.co.uk/news/structures/shattered-500m-crystal-palace-rebuild-plan/8679193.article |publisher=New Civil Engineer |accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mann|first1=Will|title=Shattered: £500M Crystal Palace rebuild plan|url=http://www.nce.co.uk/news/structures/shattered-500m-crystal-palace-rebuild-plan/8679193.article|publisher=New Civil Engineer|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="720">The '''Teatro D. Pedro II''' was a theatre in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. The theatre was inaugurated in 1871, and received the name of ''Teatro Imperial D. Pedro II'' in 1875.

In 1890, after the proclamation of the ''Republic of Brazil'', the theatre was renamed ''Teatro Lyrico''. The building was demolished in 1934.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18079">'''War reparations''' are payments made after a war by the vanquished to the victors.

They are intended to cover damage or injury inflicted during a war. Generally, the term ''war reparations'' refers to money or goods changing hands, but not to the [[annexation]] of land.

== History ==
Making the defeated party pay a war [[indemnity]] is a common practice with a long history.

In [[Ancient history]], the imposition of reparations on a defeated enemy was often the beginning of forcing that enemy to pay a regular [[tribute]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

[[Roman Empire|Rome]] imposed large [[indemnity|indemnities]] on [[Carthage]] after the [[First Punic War|First]] ( [[Treaty of Lutatius]] ) and [[Second Punic War]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Livy. Ab urbe condita (The Early History of Rome, books I–V, and The History of Rome from its Foundation, books XXI–XXX: The War with Hannibal), London; Penguin Classics, 2002 and 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some war reparations induced changes in monetary policy. For example, the French payment following the Franco-Prussian war played a major role in Germany's decision to adopt the gold standard.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} The 230 million silver [[tael]]s in reparations imposed on defeated China after the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] led Japan to a similar decision.&lt;ref&gt;Metzler, M. 2006. Lever of Empire: The International Gold Standard and the Crisis of Liberalism in Prewar Japan. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===

==== Napoleonic War ====
Following the [[Treaty of Paris (1815)]], defeated France was ordered to pay 700 million francs in indemnities. France was also to pay additional money to cover the cost of providing additional defensive fortifications to be built by neighbouring Coalition countries. In proportion to its GDP, it's the most expensive war reparation ever paid by a country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=E. N. White|year=2001|title=Making the French pay: the cost and consequences of the Napoleonic reparations|journal= European Review of Economic History|number= 5|pages= 337–65}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Franco-Prussian War ====

After the [[Franco-Prussian War]], according to conditions of [[Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)|Treaty of Frankfurt]] (May 10, 1871), [[France]] was obliged to pay a war [[French indemnity|indemnity]] of 5 billion gold francs in 5 years. The indemnity was proportioned, according to population, to be the exact equivalent to the indemnity imposed by [[Napoleon]] on Prussia in [[Treaties of Tilsit|1807]].&lt;ref&gt;A. J. P. Taylor, ''Bismarck: The Man and the Statesman'', without taking in account the Napoleonic War reparation (London: Hamish Hamilton, 1955), p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; German troops remained in parts of France until the last installment of the indemnity was paid in September 1873, ahead of schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=For the Soul of France : culture wars in the age of Dreyfus|last=Brown|first=Frederick|date=2010|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|isbn=0307279219|edition=1st |location=New York|pages=88|oclc=419798763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Greco-Turkish War of 1897 ====

Following the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)]], defeated Greece was forced to pay a large war indemnity to Turkey (£4 million). Greece, which was already in default,{{clarify|date=October 2014}} was compelled to permit oversight of its public finances by an international financial commission.&lt;ref&gt;Wynne William H., (1951), State insolvency and foreign bondholders, New Haven, Yale University Press, vol. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== World War I ====
{{Main|World War I reparations}}
Russians agreed to pay reparations to the [[Central Powers]] when Russia exited the war in the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] (which was repudiated by the [[Bolshevik]] government eight months later).  [[Bulgaria]] paid reparations of 2.25 billion gold francs (90 million pounds) to the Entente, according to the [[Treaty of Neuilly]].

[[Germany]] agreed to pay reparations of 132 billion gold marks to the [[Triple Entente]] in the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which were then cancelled in 1932 with Germany only having paid a part of the sum. This still left Germany with debts it had incurred in order to finance the reparations, and these were revised by the [[Agreement on German External Debts]] in 1953. After another pause pending the reunification of Germany, the last installment of these debt repayments was paid on 3 October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=189637|title='Germany makes final payment for WWI reparations'|work=The Jerusalem Post - JPost.com|accessdate=3 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024060913/http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=189637|archivedate=24 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== World War II Germany ====
{{Further|German reparations for World War II}}

During World War II, Nazi Germany extracted payments from occupied countries and compelled loans. In addition, countries were obliged to provide resources, and forced labour.

After [[World War II]], according to the [[Potsdam conference]] held between July 17 and August 2, 1945, Germany was to pay the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] US$23 billion mainly in machinery and [[manufacturing plant]]s. Reparations to the [[Soviet Union]] stopped in 1953. Large numbers of factories were dismantled or destroyed.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Dismantling in the west stopped in 1950.

Beginning before the German surrender and continuing for the next two years, the [[United States]] pursued a vigorous program of harvesting all technological and scientific know-how as well as all patents and many leading scientists in Germany (known  as [[Operation Paperclip]]). Historian [[John Gimbel]], in his book ''Science Technology and Reparations: Exploitation and Plunder in Postwar Germany'', states that the "intellectual reparations" taken by the U.S. and the UK amounted to close to $10 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Norman M. Naimark ''The Russians in Germany'' {{ISBN|0-674-78405-7}} pg. 206&lt;/ref&gt;
German reparations were partly to be in the form of [[forced labor]]. By 1947, approximately 4,000,000 German [[POW]]s and civilians were used as forced labor (under various headings, such as "reparations labor" or "enforced labor") in the Soviet Union, France, the UK, Belgium and in Germany in U.S run "Military Labor Service Units".

==== World War II Italy ====
According to the [[Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947]], [[Italy]] agreed to pay reparations of about US$125 million to [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], US$105 million to [[Greece]], US$100 million to the Soviet Union, US$25 million to [[Ethiopia]], and US$5 million to [[Albania]].

Roper, Romania: The Unfinished Revolution, Routledge, London, 2000, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bulgaria]] agreed to pay reparations of $50 million to Greece and $25 million to Yugoslavia.
According to the articles of these treaties, the value of US$ was prescribed as 35 US dollars to one [[troy ounce]] of pure [[gold]].

=== Japan ===

==== Sino-Japanese War of 1895 ====
The [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]], signed on April 17, 1895, obliged China to pay an indemnity of 200 million silver taels (¥3.61 billion) to Japan; and to open the ports of [[Shashi District|Shashi]], [[Chongqing]], [[Suzhou]] and [[Hangzhou]] to Japanese trade.

==== World War II Japan ====
According to Article 14 of the [[Treaty of Peace with Japan]] (1951): "Japan should pay reparations to the Allied Powers for the damage and suffering caused by it during the war. Japan will promptly enter into negotiations with Allied Powers". War reparations made pursuant to the San Francisco Peace Treaty with Japan (1951) include: reparations amounting to US$550 million (198 billion yen 1956) were made to the Philippines, and US$39 million (14.04 billion yen 1959) to Viet Nam; payment to the International Committee of the Red Cross to compensate prisoners of war (POW) of 4.5 million pounds sterling (4.54109 billion yen) was made; and Japan relinquished all overseas assets approximately US$23.681 billion (379.499 billion yen).

Japan signed the peace treaty with 49 nations in 1952 and concluded 54 bilateral agreements that included those with Burma (US$20 million 1954, 1963), the Republic of Korea (US$300 million 1965), Indonesia (US$223.08 million 1958), the Philippines (525 million US dollars/52.94 billion yen 1967), Malaysia (25 million Malaysian dollars/2.94 billion Yen 1967), Thailand (5.4 billion Yen 1955), Micronesia (1969), Laos (1958), Cambodia (1959), Mongolia (1977), Spain ($5.5 million 1957), Switzerland, Netherlands ($10 million 1956), Sweden and Denmark. Payments of reparations started in 1955, lasted for 23 years and ended in 1977. For countries that renounced any reparations from Japan, it agreed to pay indemnity and/or grants in accordance with bilateral agreements. In the [[Joint Communiqué of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China]] (1972), People's Republic of China renounces its demand for war reparation from Japan. In the [[Soviet–Japanese Joint Declaration of 1956]], the Soviet Union waived its rights to reparations from Japan, and both Japan and the Soviet Union waived all reparations claims arising from war. Additionally, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), under President [[J. R. Jayewardene]], declined war reparations from Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/south-asia/japan-pm-abe-ends-sri-lanka-trip-with-visit-to-temple|title=Japan PM Abe ends Sri Lanka trip with visit to temple|first=|last=migration|date=8 September 2014|website=straitstimes.com|accessdate=30 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323105543/http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/south-asia/japan-pm-abe-ends-sri-lanka-trip-with-visit-to-temple|archivedate=23 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== United States ====

The [[Federal government of the United States|government of the United States]] under the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan Administration]] officially apologized for the [[Japanese American internment]] during [[World War II]] in 1988 and paid reparations to former internees and their descendants.

=== Iraq and Kuwait ===
After the [[Gulf War]], [[Iraq]] accepted [[United Nations]] [[Security Council]] [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 687|Resolution 687]], which declared Iraq's financial liability for damage caused in its invasion of [[Kuwait]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Documents/687.pdf|title=RESOLUTION 687 (1991)|last=|first=|date=9 April 1991|website=U.S. Department of the Treasury|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170505144929/https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Documents/687.pdf|archive-date=2017-05-05|dead-url=no|access-date=23 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[United Nations Compensation Commission]] ("UNCC") was established, and US$350 billion in claims were filed by governments, corporations, and individuals.  Funds for these payments were to come from a 30% share of Iraq's oil revenues from the [[Oil-for-Food Programme|oil for food]] program.  It was not anticipated that US$350 billion would become available for total payment of all reparations claims, so several schedules of prioritization were created over the years.  The UNCC says that its prioritization of claims by natural people, ahead of claims by governments and entities or corporations (legal persons), "marked a significant step in the evolution of international claims practice."

Payments under this reparations program continue; as of July 2010, the UNCC stated that it had actually distributed US$18.4 billion to claimants.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

There have been attempts to codify reparations both in the Statutes of the [[International Criminal Court]] and the UN Basic Principles on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32340">'''Workplace aggression''' is a specific type of [[aggression]] which occurs in the workplace. Workplace aggression can include a wide range of behaviors, ranging from verbal acts (e.g., insulting someone or spreading rumors) to physical attacks (e.g., punching or slapping).

==Definition==
Aggression, in general, is any behavior an individual carries out with the intent to harm another person or group of people. The aggressor must believe that their behavior is harmful to their target, and that the target is motivated to avoid this behavior.&lt;ref name=andersonbushman02&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anderson |first1=CA |last2= Bushman |first2=BJ |title=Human aggression |journal=Annu Rev Psychol |volume=53 |issue= |pages=27–51 |year=2002 |pmid=11752478 |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135231 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A defining feature of aggression is the intent or motivation to harm. For a behavior to be considered an aggressive act, the individual committing the behavior must intend harm. In other words, if they inflict harm on another without that specific intent, it is not considered aggression.&lt;ref name=andersonbushman02/&gt;

Aggression can occur in a variety of situations. One important domain to understand aggression is in the workplace. Workplace aggression is considered a specific type of [[counterproductive work behavior]] (CWB) and is defined as "any act of aggression, physical assault, threatening or coercive behavior that causes physical or emotional harm in a work setting."&lt;ref name=rai02&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rai | first1 = S. | year = 2002 | title = Preventing workplace aggression and violence—A role for occupational therapy | url = | journal = Journal of Prevention, Assessment, and Rehabilitation | volume = 18 | issue = 15–22| pages = 15–22 |pmid=12441587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers specify that workplace aggression only includes efforts to harm coworkers, former coworkers, current employers, or past employers.&lt;ref name=neumanbaron98/&gt; Others include in workplace aggression any behaviors intended to harm another person that are enacted in a workplace.&lt;ref name=peekasarunyanzwerling01&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0749-3797(00)00290-7 | last1 = Peek-Asa | first1 = C. | last2 = Runyan | first2 = C.W. | last3 = Zwerling | first3 = C. | year = 2001 | title = The role of surveillance and evaluation research in the reduction of violence against workers | url = | journal = American Journal of Preventive Medicine | volume = 20 | issue = 2| pages = 141–148 | pmid = 11165457 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
To delineate the range of behaviors that can be considered aggressive workplace behaviors, researchers have developed schemes of classification for workplace aggression. Neuman and Baron (1998) offer these three dimensions that encompass the range of workplace aggression:
# Expressions of hostility – behaviors that are primarily verbal or symbolic in nature
# [[Obstructionism]] – behaviors intended to hinder an employee from performing their job or the organization from accomplishing its objectives
# Overt aggression – violent acts

In an attempt to further break down the wide range of aggressive workplace behaviors, Baron and Neuman (1996) also classify workplace aggression based on these three dichotomies:
# Verbal–physical
# Direct–indirect
# Active–passive&lt;ref name=baronneuman96&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1098-2337(1996)22:3&lt;161::AID-AB1&gt;3.0.CO;2-Q | last1 = Baron | first1 = R.A. | last2 = Neuman | first2 = J.H. | year = 1996 | title = Workplace violence and workplace aggression: Evidence of their relative frequency and potential causes | url = | journal = Aggressive Behavior | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 161–173 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aggressive acts can take any possible combination of these three dichotomies. For example, failing to deny false rumors about a coworker would be classified as verbal–passive–indirect. Purposely avoiding the presence of a coworker you know is searching for your assistance could be considered physical–passive–direct.

Other researchers offer a classification system based on the aggressor's relationship to the victim.&lt;ref name=peekasarunyanzwerling01/&gt;
# Criminal intent (Type I) – this type of aggression occurs when the aggressor has no relationship to the victim or organization.
# Customer/client (Type II) – the aggressor has a relationship with the organization and aggresses while they are being served as a customer.
# Worker on worker (Type III) – both the aggressor and the victim are employees in the same organization. Often, the aggressor is a supervisor, and the victim is a subordinate.
# Personal relationship (Type IV) – the aggressor has a relationship with an employee at an organization, but not the organization itself. This category includes victims who are assaulted by a domestic partner while at work.

==Covert nature==
In the workplace much of the aggressive behavior enacted on targets are considered covert in nature. According to Bjorkqvist, Osterman, and Hjelt-Back, covert behaviors are those behaviors that are designed to disguise the aggressive behavior or aggressive intentions from the target. Overt aggression, on the other hand, includes behaviors that do not hide the aggressive intent and are open in their intentions. Typically, covert aggression is verbal, indirect, and passive in nature, while overt aggression reflects the physical, direct, and active side of the dichotomies.&lt;ref name=bjorkqvist94&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/1098-2337(1994)20:3&lt;173::AID-AB2480200304&gt;3.0.CO;2-D | last1 = Bjorkqvist | first1 = K. | last2 = Osterman | first2 = K. | last3 = Hjelt-Back | first3 = M. | year = 1994 | title = Aggression among university employees | url = | journal = Aggressive Behavior | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 173–184 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Workplace aggression often takes the form of covert behaviors. This can be attributed to what Bjorkqvist, Osterman, and Lagerspetz call the effect/danger ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/1098-2337(1994)20:1&lt;27::AID-AB2480200105&gt;3.0.CO;2-Q | last1 = Bjorkqvist | first1 = K. | last2 = Osterman | first2 = K. | last3 = Lagerspetz | first3 = K. J. | year = 1994 | title = Sex different in covert aggression among adults | url = | journal = Aggressive Behavior | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 27–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This term refers to the aggressors' subjective evaluation of the relative effects and danger of committing an aggressive act. For an aggressor, it is ideal to have a larger effect/danger ratio. In other words, aggressors want an act to have a large effect with relatively low risk of danger to themselves.

Individuals in the workplace are subjected to prolonged exposure to each other. This prolonged exposure means the victims of the aggressors' actions likely have more time to retaliate, thus increasing the danger aspect of the ratio. Also, workplaces are often communal in nature. That is, people often work in groups and are surrounded by others. The presence of others acts as a built in audience that could "punish" the aggressor for harming a victim. It is for these reasons that individuals often choose covert forms of aggression.&lt;ref name=baronneuman96/&gt;

==Predictors (antecedents)==
Predictors of workplace aggression can occur at both the organizational level and the individual level. Organizational factors examined here include [[organizational justice]], supervision and surveillance, changes in the work environment, and specific job characteristics. At the individual level, gender, age, and alcohol consumption are examined here. While this is not a comprehensive listing of predictors, it does cover the majority of workplace aggression predictors addressed in the empirical literature.

===Organizational (in)justice===
{{Main|Organizational justice}}
Perceived interpersonal justice, the degree to which people feel they are treated with fairness and respect, is negatively related to both psychological and physical aggression against supervisors.&lt;ref name= duprebarling06&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/1076-8998.11.1.13 | last1 = Dupre | first1 = K.E. | last2 = Barling | first2 = J. | year = 2006 | title = Predicting and preventing supervisory workplace aggression | url = | journal = Journal of Occupational Health Psychology | volume = 11 | issue = 1| pages = 13–26 | pmid = 16551171 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inness, Barling, and Turner found similar results;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0021-9010.90.4.731 | last1 = Inness | first1 = M. | last2 = Barling | first2 = J. | last3 = Turner | first3 = N. | year = 2005 | title = Understanding Supervisor-targeted aggression: A within-person, between-jobs design | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 90 | issue = 4| pages = 731–739 | pmid = 16060789 }}&lt;/ref&gt; perceived interpersonal injustice was related to workplace aggression in participants' primary and secondary jobs.

Moreover, perceived procedural justice, the extent to which formal organizational procedures are assumed fair, is related to workplace aggression against supervisors. Greenberg and Barling found that the greater the perceptions of procedural justice, the less workplace aggression was reported.&lt;ref name=greenbergbarling99/&gt;

=== Termination and job security ===
The most extreme forms of workplace aggression may result from personnel decisions, such as individual termination and mass layoffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Perceptions and Punishments of Workplace Aggression: The Role of Aggression Content, Context, and Perceiver Variables1|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0021-9029.2006.00115.x/abstract|journal = Journal of Applied Social Psychology|date = 2006-10-01|issn = 1559-1816|pages = 2509–2531|volume = 36|issue = 10|doi = 10.1111/j.0021-9029.2006.00115.x|first = Theresa J.|last = Brown|first2 = Kenneth E.|last2 = Sumner}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 a man killed one and wounded five others at his former place of employment two years after he was let go from the company due to poor performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Suspect in Orlando shooting spree charged with first-degree murder  - CNN.com|url = http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/11/06/orlando.shootings/index.html?eref=onion|accessdate = 2015-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar event occurred in 2012 when a man shot and killed four employees and then himself after losing his job earlier that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Suspect in Minneapolis shooting spree was laid-off employee|url = http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/09/28/14133671-suspect-in-minneapolis-shooting-spree-was-laid-off-employee?lite|accessdate = 2015-07-19|first = U.S.|last = News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Layoff|Downsizing]] is a tactic used by organizations where there is a slow-down in business in order to remain profitable or minimize losses. This tactic is most commonly observed during widespread economic hardships, such as the [[2008 recession|Great Recession]] of 2008.

Perceived [[Job security|job insecurity]], or feelings of impending termination, has been found to be a predictor of workplace aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Incivility and Workplace Violence {{!}} Civility Toolbox {{!}} Show Me Respect: Promoting Civility at the University of Missouri|url = http://civility.missouri.edu/incivility-workplace-violence.php|website = civility.missouri.edu|accessdate = 2015-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supervision and surveillance===
Workplace surveillance ([[employee monitoring]]) is positively related to workplace aggression against supervisors, such that the greater the number of employee surveillance methods used, the greater the amount of workplace aggression.&lt;ref name=greenbergbarling99/&gt; Furthermore, supervisory control over work performance has also been shown positively related to workplace aggression against supervisors.&lt;ref name= duprebarling06/&gt; This type of behavior has been observed both adults and teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Workplace aggression in teenage part-time employees.|url = http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0021-9010.91.5.987|journal = Journal of Applied Psychology|date = 2006-01-01|volume = 91|issue = 5|doi = 10.1037/0021-9010.91.5.987|first = Kathryne E.|last = Dupré|first2 = Michelle|last2 = Inness|first3 = Catherine E.|last3 = Connelly|first4 = Julian|last4 = Barling|first5 = Colette|last5 = Hoption|pages=987–997|pmid=16953763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Workplace changes===
Baron and Neuman found that certain changes in the work environment can lead to increased aggression that they attribute to heightened anxiety and stress.&lt;ref name=baronneuman96/&gt; Specifically, pay cuts or freezes, changes in management, increased monitoring systems (e.g., increased computer monitoring), increased diversity, and the increased use of part-time employees all were related to higher levels of workplace aggression.

===Job-specific characteristics===
Other antecedents of workplace aggression found in the literature are specific job characteristics. LeBlanc and Kelloway found that certain job features, such as handling guns or collecting valuable items, were significantly more related to workplace aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0021-9010.87.3.444 | last1 = LeBlanc | first1 = M.M. | last2 = Kelloway | first2 = E.K. | year = 2002 | title = Predictors and outcomes of workplace violence and aggression | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 87 | issue = 3| pages = 444–453 | pmid = 12090602 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time spent at work===
Harvey and Keashly found that length of time at work was able to predict workplace aggression such that the longer hours a person worked, the more likely they were to report aggression. The authors attributed this finding to two possible reasons. First, the more hours worked, the greater statistical probability of being victimized. Second, longer hours worked could contribute to fatigue and frustration. This in turn may increase the likelihood of aggressive actions towards coworkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2224/sbp.2003.31.8.807 | last1 = Harvey | first1 = S. | last2 = Keashly | first2 = L. | year = 2003 | title = Predicting the risk for aggression in the workplace: Risk factors, self-esteem, and time at work | url = | journal = Social Behavior and Personality | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 807–814 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender===
In some studies, gender has been shown a significant predictor of workplace aggression. For example, being male is significantly related to reports of aggression against supervisors.&lt;ref name= duprebarling06/&gt; Furthermore, males are more likely to commit aggressive acts in the presence of other men.&lt;ref name=kaukiainenetal&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/ab.1021 | last1 = Kaukiainen | first1 = A. | last2 = Salmivalli | first2 = C. | last3 = Bjorkqvist | first3 = K. | last4 = Osterman | first4 = K. | last5 = Lahtinen | first5 = A. | last6 = Kostomo | first6 = A. | last7 = Lagerspetz | first7 = K. | year = 2001 | title = Overt and covert aggression in work settings in relation to the subjective well-being of employees | url = | journal = Aggressive Behavior | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 360–371 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be attributed to societal cultures that dictate "codes of honor." Females, on the other hand, are no more likely to act aggressively in either the presence of females or males.

===Age===
Age is significantly related to aggression. In their study of age and [[job performance]], Ng and Feldman found that older workers (age 40 or older) engaged in less workplace aggression than younger workers.&lt;ref name=ngfeldman08&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0021-9010.93.2.392 | last1 = Ng | first1 = T.W.H. | last2 = Feldman | first2 = D.C. | year = 2008 | title = The relationship of age to ten dimensions of job performance | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 93 | issue = 2| pages = 392–423 | pmid = 18361640 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alcohol consumption===
The frequency and amount of alcohol typically consumed by a person predicts aggressive behavior. Those who consume more alcohol more frequently are more likely to aggress against a coworker.&lt;ref name= greenbergbarling99&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1099-1379(199911)20:6&lt;897::AID-JOB975&gt;3.0.CO;2-Z | last1 = Greenberg | first1 = L. | last2 = Barling | first2 = J. | year = 1999 | title = Predicting employee aggression against coworkers, subordinates and supervisors: The roles of person behaviors and perceived workplace factors | url = | journal = Journal of Organizational Behavior | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 897–913 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hebei tractor rampage]] began as workplace aggression following alcohol consumption.&lt;ref name="154 per 100"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article548063.ece |title=China coal worker kills 11 in drunken rampage with tractor |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |date=August 2, 2010 |accessdate=August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cyber-aggression==
'''Cyber-aggression''' or [[Harassment by computer|cyber-harassment]]:

    {{Quote|text=Takes the form of obscene or hate e-mail/text messages that threaten or frighten, or e-mails/text messages that contain offensive content, such as sexist or racist material. What is unique about this type of workplace harassment, compared to more traditional forms of harassment, is that this material can be sent by people in addition to work colleagues, by other individuals outside the workplace (either known or not known to the person) or even in the form of spam. |author=Whitty &amp; Carr |source=&lt;ref name="Whitty_Carr04"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Whitty | first1 = Monica T. | last2 = Carr | first2 = Adrian N. | year = 2004 | title = New rules in the workplace: Applying object-relations theory to explain problem Internet and email behaviour in the workplace | doi = 10.1016/j.chb.2004.06.005 | journal = Computers in Human Behavior | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 235–50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

What many do not realize that the phenomenon of cyber-bullying often associated with teenage culture has spread to the workplace in a variety of ways. While this trend is seemingly silent and slow growing, its effects are considered equally hurtful as any form of harassment.

Often, cyber-aggression is the result of individuals in a workplace being offended/upset/or feeling threatened by organizational problems. They then resort to virtual communication as a form of retaliation. These actions are referred to as ''[[Flaming (Internet)|flaming]]'' by Whitty &amp; Carr, or essentially when an individual online writes with hostility towards a particular person or group of people.

===Instant messaging===
Instant messaging has become both a help and a hindrance in organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Greengard, Samuel. "IM speeds workplace communication, but it can also spell trouble." ''Workforce Management'' July 2003: 84-85&lt;/ref&gt; The ease of use with instant messaging, is partially to blame, "Employees can see who else is available, and if it’s someone they want to talk to, they’re able to connect in real time". While this has become an extremely useful tool in workplace communication, instant messengers such at AIM or MSN Messenger are not easily regulated from a managerial aspect, which leads to employees being able to have private conversations on a public platform. These conversations can foster aggressive talk and lead to potentially hurtful information being spread among an organization. Some argue that instant messages are beneficial to the work process because it can easily resolve problems without having to distract the person via phone and you don’t have to wait for an email response.

===Email===
This is one of the most prevalent tools used in cyber-aggression because of its prevalence in workplace communications.&lt;ref&gt;Lacey, Hoda. ""E" is for etiquette when sending emails." ''Travel Trade Gazette'' 13 May 2005: 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, Claire. "Want to tell a lie? Put it in email." ''The Times Higher Education Supplement'' 20 Jan. 2007: 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Often upset workers send loaded messages and attach the email to a large group of co-workers that are not involved in the issue to bring attention to it. An article from the Travel Trade Gazette give some advice to avoid being aggressive in emails.
* Always give a clear subject
* State exactly what you need in a simple manner
* Avoid terms like ''[[wikt:ASAP|ASAP]]''
* Only use reply all when it refers to the whole group
* Using all upper case is electronic SHOUTING!
* Don’t use texting lexicon
* Never send an email when you are upset

===Social networking===
This is one of the fastest growing ways that workers can lash out against each other. The opportunity is high for individuals to be aggressive in a highly public and open forum. Many choose to speak out at their co-workers or superiors because it is a way for them to vent their feelings while not having to say these things face to face.

==Outcomes==
Like the array of behaviors considered workplace aggression, the consequences of workplace aggression are also extensive. For example, Ng and Feldman suggest that "acts of workplace aggression can cause bodily harm to employees, pose physical danger for customers, create public relations crises, and harm the business reputation of the firm as a whole."&lt;ref name=ngfeldman08/&gt; The outcomes of workplace aggression addressed here include the health and well-being of targeted employees and job performance. Gender differences in outcomes are also addressed.

Severity of the repercussions may be influenced by the position of the aggressor. Hershcovis and Barling found that "...supervisor aggression has the strongest adverse effects across attitudinal and behavioral outcomes", followed by co-worker aggression and outsider aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Towards a multi-foci approach to workplace aggression: A meta-analytic review of outcomes from different perpetrators|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/job.621/abstract|journal = Journal of Organizational Behavior|date = 2010-01-01|issn = 1099-1379|pages = 24–44|volume = 31|issue = 1|doi = 10.1002/job.621|first = M. Sandy|last = Hershcovis|first2 = Julian|last2 = Barling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health and well-being===
Workplace aggression can have devastating effects on an organization's employees.&lt;ref name=baronneuman96/&gt; For example, it has been found that targets of workplace aggression report lower levels of [[well-being]].&lt;ref name=baronneuman96/&gt; Other studies have shown that aggression in the workplace can cause the victims of such behaviors to suffer from health problems and displaced aggression - including perpetuating aggression towards random strangers in the street. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/1061-4087.47.4.205 | last1 = Driscoll | first1 = R. | last2 = Worthington | first2 = K. | last3 = Hurrell | first3 = J.J. | year = 1995 | title = Workplace assault: An emerging job stressor | url = | journal = Consult Psychological Practical Research | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 205–211 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bjorkqvist, Osterman, and Hjelt-Back even found that targets exhibited symptoms similar to those of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), such as anxiety and depression.&lt;ref name=bjorkqvist94/&gt; . Sorensen et al. found possible associations between harassment at work and well-being measures of [[low back pain|lower back pain]] and [[sleep deprivation|sleep deficiency]] among a sample of hospital workers.&lt;ref name=sorensen&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sorensen | first1 = G. | last2 = Stoddard | first2 = A.M. | last3 = Stoffel | first3 = S. | last4 = Buxton | first4 = O. | last5 = Sembajwe | first5 = G. | last6 = Hashimoto | first6 = D.| last7 = Dennerlein | first7 = J.T. | last8 = Hopcia | first8 = K. | year = 2011 | title = The Role of the Work Context in Multiple Wellness Outcomes for Hospital Patient Care Workers | journal = Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine | volume = 53 | issue = 8 | pages = 899–910 | pmid=21775897 | doi=10.1097/JOM.0b013e318226a74a | pmc=3693572}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Team performance===
Research has looked at the negative impacts of workplace aggression on team performance and particularly team effectiveness as was evidenced in a recent study by Aube and Rousseau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rousseau | first1 = V. | last2 = Aube | first2 = C. | year = 2011 | title = Interpersonal aggression and team effectiveness: The mediating role of team goal commitment | url = | journal = Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology | volume = 84 | issue = 3| pages = 565–580 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Job satisfaction===
Victims of workplace aggression may suffer from reduced [[job satisfaction]]. Lapierre, Spector, and Leck found that those who perceived being targets of workplace aggression reported significantly lower overall job satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/1076-8998.10.2.155 | last1 = Lapierre | first1 = L.M. | last2 = Spector | first2 = P.E. | last3 = Leck | first3 = J.D. | year = 2005 | title = Sexual versus nonsexual workplace aggression and victims' overall job satisfaction: A meta-analysis | url = | journal = Journal of Occupational Health Psychology | volume = 10 | issue = 2| pages = 155–169 | pmid = 15826225 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, those who perceive abuse from their supervisors report lower levels of job satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1556375 | last1 = Tepper | first1 = B.J. | year = 2000 | title = Consequences of abusive supervision | url = | journal = Academy of Management Journal | volume = 43 | issue = 2| pages = 178–190 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender differences in outcomes===
Research has shown that males and females react to workplace aggression differently. While both males and females have reported lower well-being after experiencing aggression in the workplace, studies indicate that the relationship between experienced workplace aggression and decreased well-being was stronger for men. In one study, results showed that men who experienced work aggression were more likely to report physical, psychosocial, affective, and cognitive problems. This study also showed that the type of aggression, whether it is overt or covert, did not matter for these outcomes.&lt;ref name= kaukiainenetal/&gt; The study attributes these findings to the idea of modern-day masculinity, which stresses achievement and success in the workplace.

For females, nonsexual aggression has been found to have a stronger impact on job satisfaction than sexual aggression. Also, nonsexual aggression has a stronger relationship with job satisfaction in females than in males.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sexual Versus Nonsexual Workplace Aggression and Victims' Overall Job Satisfaction: A Meta-Analysis.|url = http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/1076-8998.10.2.155|journal = Journal of Occupational Health Psychology|date = 2005-01-01|volume = 10|issue = 2|doi = 10.1037/1076-8998.10.2.155|first = Laurent M.|last = Lapierre|first2 = Paul E.|last2 = Spector|first3 = Joanne D.|last3 = Leck|pmid=15826225|pages=155–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
Prevention programs focus on reducing instances of workplace aggression. Programs that incorporate personnel selection, organizational sanctions, and training are recommended.

===Personnel selection===
Based on a workplace prevention program developed by the United States Postal Service (USPS), Neuman and Baron encourage organizations to use personnel screening and testing to identify potential employees who are likely to behave aggressively before they are even hired. This proactive strategy prevents individuals who are predisposed to aggress from even entering the workplace.&lt;ref name=neumanbaron98/&gt;

===Organizational sanctions===
Explicit policies regarding workplace aggression may help organizations to reduce aggression. Employees who perceived that their organization would punish workplace aggressors reported less workplace aggression even when their perceptions of interpersonal justice were high.&lt;ref name="duprebarling06"/&gt; Neuman and Baron also suggest using organizational policies to curb workplace aggression and to shape strong anti-aggressive organizational norms.&lt;ref name=neumanbaron98/&gt;

===Training===
[[Training]] is also an important part of a prevention program. Neuman and Baron suggest that training for both supervisors and subordinates should focus on teaching employees methods for dealing with aggression.&lt;ref name=neumanbaron98&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Neuman | first1 = J.H. | last2 = Baron | first2 = R.A. | year = 1998 | title = Workplace violence and workplace aggression: Evidence concerning specific forms, potential causes, and preferred targets | url = | journal = Journal of Management | volume = 24 | issue =3 | pages = 391–419 |doi=10.1177/014920639802400305 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Rai advises that appropriate training should inform employees that management takes threats seriously, encourage employees to report incidents, and demonstrate management's commitment to deal with reported incidents.&lt;ref name=rai02/&gt;

=== Organizational support ===
Organizational support can influence the effects of workplace aggression. Schat and Kelloway isolated two forms of organizational support: instrumental and informational. Instrumental support refers to providing some type of assistance directly to an afflicted individuals, whereas information support refers to providing employees with self-help informational resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Reducing the adverse consequences of workplace aggression and violence: The buffering effects of organizational support.|url = http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/1076-8998.8.2.110|journal = Journal of Occupational Health Psychology|date = 2003-01-01|volume = 8|issue = 2|doi = 10.1037/1076-8998.8.2.110|first = Aaron C.

[[File:World People's Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth 2010.jpg|thumb|Evo Morales at a press conference during the event.]]

'''The World People's Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth''' was a global gathering of civil society and governments hosted by the government of [[Bolivia]] in Tiquipaya, just outside the city of [[Cochabamba]] on 19-22 April 2010.

== Description ==

The event was attended by around 30,000 people from over 100 countries,{{fact|date=February 2016}} and the proceedings were transmitted live online by [[OneClimate]] and the [[Global Campaign for Climate Action]] (GCCA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oneclimate.net/bolivia |title=is a new social networking space for sharing ideas and experiences on climate change |publisher=Oneclimate.net |date=2010-04-13 |accessdate=2010-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702204842/http://www.oneclimate.net/bolivia |archivedate=2 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was viewed as a response to what some termed failed climate talks &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/18/copenhagen-deal |title=Low targets, goals dropped: Copenhagen ends in failure &amp;#124; Environment &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date=18 December 2009|accessdate=2010-09-12 |location=London |first1=John |last1=Vidal |first2=Suzanne |last2=Goldenberg |first3=Allegra |last3=Stratton}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{FV|date=February 2016}} in Copenhagen during the 15th United Nations Conference of Parties ([[COP15]]) climate meetings in December 2009. There have been claims after the Conference ended that there were flaws in its organization and that the Venezuelan government funded it partially.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bolpress.com/art.php?Cod=2010061710 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the important objectives&lt;ref name="wordpress1"&gt;[http://pwccc.wordpress.com/guia-informativa/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403043159/http://pwccc.wordpress.com/guia-informativa/ |date=3 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the conference was to produce proposals for new commitments to the [[Kyoto Protocol]] and projects in the lead-up to the next UN climate negotiations scheduled during the [[COP16]] meeting in Cancun, Mexico in December 2010.

Conference topics included&lt;ref name="wordpress1"/&gt; a Universal Declaration on the Rights of Mother Earth (see external links below), a World People's Referendum on Climate Change, and the establishment of a Climate Justice Tribunal. 

The World People's Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of the Mother Earth resulted in a People's Accord.

==Critical response==
The film received generally favorable reception across Turkey.  Film critics were appreciative of the battle scenes, but found forgivable flaws with scripting and acting.&lt;ref name="En Son Haber]"&gt;{{cite news|last1=staff|title=Çanakkale 1915 filmine ilk yorumlar|url=http://www.ensonhaber.com/canakkale-1915-filmine-ilk-yorumlar-2012-10-22.html|accessdate=25 April 2015|language=Turkish|publisher=En Son Haber|date=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reviewer [[Atilla Dorsay]] said it was an over the top drama which, while a bit over-done, was not bad for its kind in its depicting events of the greatest importance to the Turkish nation. Reviewer [[Mehmet Açar]] felt the resistance soul filled the audience, as when the film aimed to feel the spirit of resistance in Çanakkale, it managed to do so. While dialogue was problematic in drama scenes the battle scenes were successful.  Reviewer [[Kerem Akça]] felt the film was worth the effort and in places quite impressive, despite significant weaknesses with script and acting. Reviewer [[Uğur Vardan]] felt the real issue brought forth in the film was poverty in the film looking at both sides of imperialism. While the production was highly successful in items such as costume design, it was extremely weak in terms of side issues.&lt;ref name="Haber Turk"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Staff|title=O film için ne dediler?|url=http://www.haberturk.com/kultur-sanat/haber/786055-o-film-icin-ne-dediler|accessdate=25 April 2015|language=Turkish|publisher=[[Habertürk]]|date=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In speaking about various films releasing in Turkey to commemorate the centenary of the Battle of Gallipoli, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' noted that film ''Canakkale 1915'' was "based on the bestselling historical fiction by Turgut Ozakman" and that it "focuses on the battle as a foundation for the Turkish Republic".&lt;ref name="Variety 1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carney|first1=Josh|title=Gallipoli pics do battle in Turkey|url=https://variety.com/2012/film/news/gallipoli-pics-do-battle-in-turkey-1118059599/|accessdate=24 April 2015|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Hurriyet Daily News]]'' called the film "a sure hit in the box office".&lt;ref name="Hürriyet Daily News 2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Güler|first1=Emrah|title=A good year in Turkish cinema, but for who?|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/a-good-year-in-turkish-cinema-but-for-who.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=37980&amp;NewsCatID=381|accessdate=24 April 2015|work=[[Hürriyet Daily News]]|date=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Daily Sabah]]'' reported on ''[[Water Diviner]]'' and in speaking of three other recent Turkish films dealing with the Gallipoli battle, wrote "''Çanakkale 1915'' was the most successful of the three films",&lt;ref name="Daily Sabah"/&gt; screening for 43 weeks, drawing 918,181 viewers, and having a box office return of a whopping $1.00 [[Turkish lira]= 0.00].&lt;ref name="Daily Sabah"&gt;{{cite news|last1=staff|title=‘Water Diviner’ outdoes other films on Gallipoli|url=http://www.dailysabah.com/cinema/2015/02/03/water-diviner-outdoes-other-films-on-gallipoli|accessdate=24 April 2015|work=[[Daily Sabah]]|date=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haber 3"&gt;{{cite news|last1=staff|title=SON UMUT NE KADAR İZLENDİ ? - EN ÇOK İLGİYİ GÖREN ÇANAKKALE 1915|url=http://www.haber3.com/son-umut-ne-kadar-izlendi-3175939h.htm|accessdate=24 April 2015|language=Turkish|publisher=Haber3|date=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Today's Zaman]]'' wrote "director Yeşim Sezgin's newest ''Çanakkale 1915'' might actually outdo [[Sinan Çetin]]'s ''[[Çanakkale Çocukları]]'' in terms of its aggression, opportunism and crooked reductionism."&lt;ref name="Today's Zaman"/&gt;  The reviewer found it frustrating that some scenes "are so blatantly full of improbable valor that they border on the comical because the filmmakers have taken themselves too seriously as they leave behind any kind of introspection."&lt;ref name="Today's Zaman"&gt;{{cite news|last1=YILDIRIM|first1=EMİNE|title='Çanakkale 1915' Fight, never flight|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/arts-culture_canakkale-1915-fight-never-flight_295742.html|accessdate=1 May 2015|work=[[Today's Zaman]]|date=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
