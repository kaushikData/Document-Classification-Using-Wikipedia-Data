      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7367">[[Niger]] is governed through a four layer, semi-decentralised series of '''Administrative divisions'''. Begun 1992, and finally approved with the formation of the [[Fifth Republic of Niger]] on 18 July 1999, Niger has been enacting a plan for Decentralisation of some state powers to local bodies. Prior to the 1999-2006 project, Niger's subdivisions were administered via direct appointment from the central government in [[Niamey]].  Beginning with Niger's first municipal elections of 2 February 1999, the nation started electing local officials for the first time.  Citizens now elect local committee representatives in each [[Communes of Niger|Commune]], chosen by subdivisions of the commune: "Quarters" in towns and "Villages" in rural areas, with additional groupings for traditional polities and nomadic populations.  These officials choose Mayors, and from them are drawn representatives to the Department level.  The same process here chooses a Departmental council and [[Prefect]], and representatives to the Regional level.  The system is repeated a Regional level, with a Regional Prefect, council, and representatives to the [[High Council of Territorial Collectives (Niger)|High Council of Territorial Collectives]] (''Le Haut Conseil des Collectivités Territoriales HCCT''). The HCCT has only advisory powers, but its members (Regions, Departments, and Communes) have some financial, planning, educational and environmental powers.  The central government oversees this process through the office of the [[Minister of Interior (Niger)|Minister of State for the Interior, Public Safety and Decentralization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.etat.sciencespobordeaux.fr/institutionnel/niger.html#Syst%E8me%20judiciaire NIGER.

==Current administrative structure==
[[Niger]] is divided into 7 '''Regions''' (French: ''régions;'' singular&amp;nbsp;– ''région)''. Each region's capital is the same as its name. Additionally, the national capital, [[Niamey]], comprises a [[Capital districts and territories|capital district]].

===[[Regions of Niger]]===
*[[Agadez Region]]
*[[Diffa Region]]
*[[Dosso Region]]
*[[Maradi Region]]
*[[Tahoua Region]]
*[[Tillabéri Region]]
*[[Zinder Region]]

The Regions are subdivided into [[Departments of Niger|Departments]] and [[Communes of Niger|communes]]. As of 2005, there were 36 ''départements'', divided into 265 ''communes'', 122 ''cantons'' and 81 ''groupements''. The latter two categories cover all areas not covered by ''Urban Communes'' (population over 10000) or ''Rural Communes'' (population under 10000), and are governed by the Department, whereas Communes have (since 1999) elected councils and mayors.  Additional semi-autonomous sub-divisions include ''Sultanates'', ''Provinces'' and ''Tributaries'' (''tribus'').&lt;ref&gt;Loi 2001-23, Article 6&lt;/ref&gt;  The Nigerien government estimates there are an additional 17000 Villages administered by ''Rural Communes'', while there are a number of ''Quartiers'' ([[boroughs]]  or neighborhoods) administered by ''Urban Communes''.&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/008/ae953f/ae953f00.pdf GOUVERNEMENT DE LA RÉPUBLIQUE DU NIGER.

==Restructuring==
Prior to the devolution program on 1999-2006, these Regions were styled Departments.  Confusingly, the next level down (Arrondissements) were renamed Departments.&lt;ref&gt;*Mbaye Mbengue FAYE, Faria Ibrahim [http://www.worldbank.org/afr/aids/gom/Annex_06/Annex%2006.01%20Waste%20Management%20TOR%20and%20Plan.doc GESTION DES DECHETS ISSUS DES SOINS DE SANTE (DISS):RAPPORT PROVISOIRE], [[World Bank]], Niamey, December 2001.

===1992 division===
Tillabéri department was created in 1992, when [[Niamey]] Region (then called "department") was split, with the area immediately outside Niamey renamed as the  ''capital district''.&lt;ref&gt;According to [https://www.statoids.com/une.html Statsoid] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040117/https://www.statoids.com/une.html |date=March 4, 2016 }}: "~1992:  Tillabéry Region/department split from Niamey (whose FIPS code was NG05 before the change).  Status of Niamey changed from department to capital district."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical evolution==
Prior to independence, Niger was divided into sixteen [[Cercle (French colonial)|Cercles]] as second level administration divisions: Agadez, Birni N'Konni, Dogondoutchi, Dosso, Filingué, Gouré, Madaoua, Magaria, Maradi, N'Guigmi, Niamey, Tahoua, Téra, Tessaoua, Tillabéry, and Zinder. Their capitals had the same names as the cercle.

After independence, the ''31 December 1961 Law of territorial organization'' created 31 ''circonscriptions''. The 16 colonial cercles continued to exist, and served as a level of division above these circonscriptions. Four cercles (Dogondoutchi, Filingué, N'Guigmi, and Téra) had only one circonscription. The ''Law of August 14, 1964'' then reorganized the country into seven departments, adopting the French second level administration naming system, in contrast to neighbor [[Mali]], which retained the colonial [[Cercles of Mali|Cercles]] and [[Regions of Mali|Regions]].

'''Ageism''' (also spelled "'''agism'''") is [[stereotyping]] of and discrimination against individuals or groups on the basis of their age. This may be casual or systematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Nelson |editor1-first=T.D. |year=2002|title=Ageism: Stereotyping and Prejudice against Older Persons|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|isbn=978-0-262-64057-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Quadagno"&gt;Quadagno, J. (2008). The field of social gerontology. In E. Barrosse (Ed.), Aging &amp; the life course: An introduction to social gerontology (pp. 2–23). New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined in 1969 by [[Robert Neil Butler]] to describe discrimination against [[Old age|seniors]], and patterned on [[sexism]] and [[racism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Butler | first1 = R. N. | year = 1969 | title = Age-ism: Another form of bigotry | journal = The Gerontologist | volume = 9 | issue = 4| pages = 243–246 | doi=10.1093/geront/9.4_part_1.243}}&lt;/ref&gt; Butler defined "ageism" as a combination of three connected elements. Among them were prejudicial attitudes towards older people, old age, and the [[Ageing|aging process]]; discriminatory practices against older people; and institutional practices and policies that perpetuate [[stereotype]]s about elderly people.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson J and Ferraro K, Thirty Years of Ageism Research. In Nelson T (ed). Ageism: Stereotyping and Prejudice Against Older Persons. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

While the term is also used in regards to prejudice and discrimination against [[adolescents]] and [[children]], such as denying them certain rights (e.g. [[voting]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freechild.org/discrimination-against-youth-voice/|title=Discrimination Against Youth Voice|author=|date=7 January 2016|website=freechild.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; ignoring their ideas because they are considered "too young", or assuming that they should behave in certain ways because of their age,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youthrights.org/oppressed.php "Young and Oppressed"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728105250/http://www.youthrights.org/oppressed.php |date=28 July 2011 }}. youthrights.org. Retrieved on 11 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; the term is predominantly used in relation to the treatment of older people. Older people themselves can be deeply ageist, having internalized a lifetime of negative stereotypes about aging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kingsreview.co.uk/magazine/theblog/2015/09/08/youthful-indiscretions/ "Youthful Indiscretions"]. kingsreview.co.uk. Retrieved on 11 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Fear of death]] and fear of disability and dependence are major causes of ageism; avoiding, segregating, and rejecting older people are [[coping mechanism]]s that allow people to avoid thinking about their own mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/20/why-ageism-never-gets-old|title=Why Ageism Never Gets Old|last=Friend|first=Tad|date=2017-11-13|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-11-28|issn=0028-792X|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can also be passive and covert (e.g., a movie that shows only young people inhabiting a locality and no children, infants or old people are shown in the area to drive the notion that the place is "young and romantic").

==Classification==
===Distinction from other age-related bias===
Ageism in common parlance and age studies usually refers to negative discriminatory practices against old people, people in their middle years, teenagers and children. There are several forms of age-related bias. [[Adultism]] is a predisposition towards adults, which is seen as biased against children, youth, and all young people who are not addressed or viewed as adults.&lt;ref&gt;Lauter And Howe (1971) ''Conspiracy of the Young.'' Meridian Press.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Jeunism''' is the discrimination against older people in favor of younger ones. This includes political candidacies, jobs, and cultural settings where the supposed greater vitality and/or [[Human physical appearance|physical beauty]] of youth is more appreciated than the supposed greater moral and/or [[Rigor|intellectual rigor]] of adulthood. [[Adultcentricism]] is the "exaggerated [[egocentrism]] of [[adults]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Martelaer | first1 = K. | last2 = De Knop | first2 = P. | last3 = Theeboom | first3 = M. | last4 = Van Heddegem | first4 = L. | year = 2000 | title = The UN Convention as a Basis for Elaborating Rights of Children In Sport | journal = Journal of Leisurability | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 3–10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Adultocracy'' is the [[Convention (norm)|social convention]] which defines "maturity" and "immaturity," placing adults in a dominant position over [[youth|young people]], both theoretically and practically.&lt;ref&gt;(n.d.) [http://www.zmag.org/0009.htm Youth Liberation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213202808/http://www.zmag.org/0009.htm |date=13 February 2007 }} ''Z'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerontocracy]] is a form of oligarchical rule in which an entity is ruled by leaders who are significantly older than most of the adult population.&lt;ref&gt;Maddox, G. L. (1987). The Encyclopedia of aging (p. 284). New York: Springer Pub. Co..&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chronocentrism]] is primarily the belief that a certain state of humanity is superior to all previous and/or future times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lyon | first1 = P. | last2 = Pollard | first2 = D. | year = 1997 | title = Perceptions of the older employee: is anything really changing? | journal = Personnel Review | volume = 26 | issue = 4| pages = 245–257 [249] | doi=10.1108/00483489710172051}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on a conceptual analysis of ageism, a new definition of ageism was introduced by Iversen, Larsen, &amp; Solem in 2009. This definition constitutes the foundation for higher reliability and validity in future research about ageism and its complexity offers a new way of systemizing theories on ageism: "Ageism is defined as negative or positive stereotypes, prejudice and/or discrimination against (or to the advantage of) elderly people on the basis of their chronological age or on the basis of a perception of them as being 'old' or 'elderly'. Ageism can be implicit or explicit and can be expressed on a micro-, meso- or macro-level" (Iversen, Larsen &amp; Solem, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Iversen | first1 = T.N. | last2 = Larsen | first2 = L. | last3 = Solem | first3 = P.E. | year = 2009 | title = A conceptual analysis of ageism | journal = Nordic Psychology | volume = 61 | issue = 3| pages = 4–22 | doi=10.1027/1901-2276.61.3.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other conditions of fear or aversion associated with age groups have their own names, particularly: paedophobia, the fear of infants and children; ephebiphobia, the fear of youth,&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, A. (2006) ''Washington Youth Voice Handbook.'' CommonAction.&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes also referred to as an irrational fear of adolescents or a prejudice against teenagers;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stop-discrimination.info/6423.0.html?&amp;no_cache=1&amp;mc_glossary%5Bcategories%5D=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017120531/http://stop-discrimination.info/6423.0.html?&amp;no_cache=1&amp;mc_glossary%5Bcategories%5D=1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 October 2007 |title=Stop Discrimination's Glossary (European Union) |work=stop-discrimination.info |accessdate=17 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[gerontophobia]], the fear of elderly people.&lt;ref&gt;Branch, L., Harris, D. &amp; Palmore, E.B. (2005) ''Encyclopedia of Ageism.'' Haworth Press. {{ISBN|0-7890-1890-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implicit ageism===
[[Implicature|Implicit]] ageism is the term used to refer to the implicit or subconscious thoughts, feelings, and behaviors one has about older or younger people. These may be a mixture of positive and negative thoughts and feelings, but gerontologist [[Becca Levy]] reports that they "tend to be mostly negative."&lt;ref name="Levy"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levy | first1 = B. R. | year = 2001 | title = Eradication of Ageism requires addressing the enemy within | journal = The Gerontologist | volume = 41 | issue = 5| pages = 578–579 | doi=10.1093/geront/41.5.578}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stereotyping===
[[stereotype|Stereotyping]] is a tool of cognition which involves categorizing into groups and attributing characteristics to these groups. Stereotypes are necessary for processing huge volumes of information which would otherwise overload a person and are generally accurate descriptors of group characteristics, though some stereotypes are inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Stereotype Accuracy: Toward Appreciating Group Differences |publisher=American Psychological Association |date=September 1995 |isbn=978-1-55798-307-7 |editors= [[Yueh-Ting Lee]], Lee J. Jussim, and Clark R. McCauley}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they can cause harm when the content of the stereotype is incorrect with respect to most of the group or where a stereotype is so strongly held that it overrides evidence which shows that an individual does not conform to it. For example, age-based stereotypes prime one to draw very different conclusions when one sees an older and a younger adult with, say, back pain or a limp.  One might well assume that the younger person's condition is temporary and treatable, following an accident, while the older person's condition is chronic and less susceptible to intervention. On average, this might be true, but plenty of older people have accidents and recover quickly and very young people (such as infants, toddlers and small children) can become permanently disabled in the same situation. This assumption may have no consequence if one makes it in the blink of an eye as one is passing someone in the street, but if it is held by a health professional offering treatment or managers thinking about occupational health, it could inappropriately influence their actions and lead to age-related discrimination. Managers have been accused, by Erdman Palmore, as stereotyping older workers as being resistant to change, not creative, cautious, slow to make judgments, lower in physical capacity, uninterested in technological change, and difficult to train.&lt;ref&gt;Palmore, E. B. (1999).  Ageism: negative and positive (2nd ed., p. 108). New York: Springer Pub.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is when people are rude to children because of their high pitched voice, even if they are kind and courteous. A review of the research literature related to age stereotypes in the workplace was recently published in the Journal of Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Posthuma | first1 = R. A. | last2 = Campion | first2 = M. A. | year = 2009 | title = Age stereotyping in the workplace: Common stereotypes, moderators, and future research directions | journal = Journal of Management | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 158–188 | doi=10.1177/0149206308318617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to common and more obvious forms of stereotyping, such as racism and sexism, ageism is more resistant to change. For instance, if a child believes in an ageist idea against the elderly, fewer people correct them, and, as a result, individuals grow up believing in ageist ideas, even elders themselves.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Invitation to the Life Span, Second Edition|last = Berger|first = Kathleen Stassen|publisher = Worth Publishers|year = 2014|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, ageism can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Ageist beliefs against the elderly are commonplace in today's society. For example, an older person who forgets something could be quick to call it a "senior moment," failing to realize the ageism of that statement. People also often utter ageist phrases such as "dirty old man" or "second childhood," and elders sometimes miss the ageist undertones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In a classic study, researchers analyzed the effects of ageism among the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Aging free from stereotypes: Successful memory in China among the deaf|last = Levy|first = Becca|date = 1994|journal = Journal of Personality &amp; Social Psychology|doi = |pmid = |last2 = Langer|first2 = Ellen}}&lt;/ref&gt; They performed memory tests on three selected groups: residents of China, deaf North Americans, and hearing North Americans. In the three groups, the Chinese residents were presumably the least exposed to ageism, with lifelong experience in a culture that traditionally venerates older generations. Lifelong deaf North Americans also faced less exposure to ageism in contrast to those with typical hearing, who presumably had heard ageist comments their whole life. The results of the memory tests showed that ageism has significant effects on memory.

The gap in the scores between the young and old North Americans with normal hearing were double those of the deaf North Americans and five times wider than those of the Chinese participants. The results show that ageism undermines ability through its self-fulfilling nature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The study was investigating the effect of the [[stereotype threat]], which has been explored as a possible reason for memory deficits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/geronb/58.1.P3 |pmid=12496296 |title=The Impact of Stereotype Threat on Age Differences in Memory Performance |journal=The Journals of Gerontology Series B: Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=P3–11 |year=2003 |last1=Hess |first1=Thomas M. |last2=Auman |first2=Corinne |last3=Colcombe |first3=Stanley J. |last4=Rahhal |first4=Tamara A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; though the stereotype threat has been criticized.&lt;ref name="Ganley2013"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0031412 |pmid=23356523 |title=An examination of stereotype threat effects on girls' mathematics performance |journal=Developmental Psychology |volume=49 |issue=10 |pages=1886–97 |year=2013 |last1=Ganley |first1=Colleen M |last2=Mingle |first2=Leigh A |last3=Ryan |first3=Allison M |last4=Ryan |first4=Katherine |last5=Vasilyeva |first5=Marina |last6=Perry |first6=Michelle }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, when elders show larger independence and control in their lives, defying ageist assumptions, they are more likely to be healthier, both mentally and physically, than other people their age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Research indicates that older people are stereotyped as scoring lower on measures of impulsivity, activism, antagonism and [[openness to experience|openness]] while younger people are stereotyped as scoring higher on these measures. This was found to be universal across cultures and was also found to be reasonably accurate (varying depending on how the accuracy was assessed and the type of stereotype), though differences were consistently exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0029712 |pmid=23088227 |pmc=3514646 |title=Stereotypes of age differences in personality traits: Universal and accurate? |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=103 |issue=6 |pages=1050–1066 |year=2012 |last1=Chan |first1=Wayne |last2=McCrae |first2=Robert R |last3=De Fruyt |first3=Filip |last4=Jussim |first4=Lee |last5=Löckenhoff |first5=Corinna E |last6=De Bolle |first6=Marleen |last7=Costa |first7=Paul T |last8=Sutin |first8=Angelina R |last9=Realo |first9=Anu |last10=Allik |first10=Jüri |last11=Nakazato |first11=Katsuharu |last12=Shimonaka |first12=Yoshiko |last13=Hřebíčková |first13=Martina |last14=Graf |first14=Sylvie |last15=Yik |first15=Michelle |last16=Brunner-Sciarra |first16=Marina |last17=De Figueroa |first17=Nora Leibovich |last18=Schmidt |first18=Vanina |last19=Ahn |first19=Chang-kyu |last20=Ahn |first20=Hyun-nie |last21=Aguilar-Vafaie |first21=Maria E |last22=Siuta |first22=Jerzy |last23=Szmigielska |first23=Barbara |last24=Cain |first24=Thomas R |last25=Crawford |first25=Jarret T |last26=Mastor |first26=Khairul Anwar |last27=Rolland |first27=Jean-Pierre |last28=Nansubuga |first28=Florence |last29=Miramontez |first29=Daniel R |last30=Benet-Martínez |first30=Verónica |display-authors=29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ageism can also manifests itself in perceptions of how dateable one is; which has culminated in terms such as the ''sexpiration date'', indicating the age after which one is no longer appealing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Apt | first1 = Carol | last2 = Farley Hurlbert | first2 = David | year = 1994 | title = The sexual attitudes, behavior, and relationships of women with histrionic personality disorder | url = | journal = Journal of sex &amp; marital therapy | volume = 20 | issue = 2| pages = 125–134 | doi=10.1080/00926239408403423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prejudice===
Ageist [[prejudice]] is a type of emotion which is often linked to the cognitive process of stereotyping. It can involve the expression of derogatory attitudes, which may then lead to the use of discriminatory behavior. Where older or younger contestants were rejected in the belief that they were poor performers, this could well be the result of stereotyping.  But older people were also voted for on a stage in a game where it made sense to target the best performers.  This can only be explained by a subconscious emotional reaction to older people; in this case, the prejudice took the form of distaste and a desire to exclude oneself from the company of older people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195385052.001.0001 |first1=Richard A. |last1=Posthuma |first2=María Fernanda |last2=Wagstaff, |first3=Michael A. |last3=Campion |chapter=Age Stereotypes and Workplace Age Discrimination: A Framework for Future Research |pages=298–312 |chapterurl={{Google books|OSBpAgAAQBAJ|page=298|plainurl=yes}} |editor1-first=Walter C. |editor1-last=Borman |editor2-first=Jerry W. |editor2-last=Hedge |title=The Oxford Handbook of Work and Aging |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-19-538505-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stereotyping and prejudice against different groups in society does not take the same form.  Age-based prejudice and stereotyping usually involves older or younger people being pitied, marginalized, or patronized.  This is described as "'''benevolent prejudice"''' because the tendency to pity is linked to seeing older or younger people as "friendly" but "incompetent." [[Age Concern]]'s survey revealed strong evidence of "benevolent prejudice."  48% said that over-70s are viewed as friendly (compared to 27% who said the same about under-30s).  Meanwhile, only 26% believe over-70s are viewed as capable (with 41% saying the same about under-30s).&lt;ref name="Loretto"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Loretto | first1 = W. | last2 = Duncan | first2 = C. | last3 = White | first3 = P.J. | year = 2000 | title = Ageism and employment: Controversies, ambiguities, and younger people's perceptions | journal = Ageing &amp; Society | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 279–302 | doi=10.1017/s0144686x00007741}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The figure for friendliness of under-30s is, conversely, an example of Hostile Prejudice. '''Hostile prejudice''' based on hatred, fear, aversion, or threat often characterizes attitudes linked to race, religion, disability, and sex. An example of hostile prejudice toward youth is the presumption without any evidence that a given crime was committed by a young person. Rhetoric regarding intergenerational competition can be motivated by politics. Violence against vulnerable older people can be motivated by subconscious hostility or fear; within families, this involves impatience and lack of understanding.  Equality campaigners are often wary of drawing comparisons between different forms of inequality.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The impact of "benevolent" and "hostile" prejudice tends to be different.  The warmth felt towards older or younger people and the knowledge that many have no access to paid employment means there is often public acceptance that they are deserving of preferential treatment—for example, less expensive movie and bus fares. But the perception of incompetence means older and younger people can be seen as "not up to the job" or "a menace on the roads," when there is little or exaggerated evidence to support this.  Prejudice also leads to assumptions that it is "natural" for older or younger people to have lower expectations, reduced choice and control, and less account taken of their views.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

=== Digital ageism ===
Digital ageism refers to the prejudices faced by older adults in the digital world. A few examples of the subtle ways in which digital ageism operates in cultural representations, research, and everyday life: Generational segregation naturalizes youth as digitally adept and the old as digital dunces. There is no empirical evidence, though, for a digital divide between older and younger people, with the former never and the latter always capable to use digital media; a far more accurate description is that of a digital spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lenhart; A. and Horrigan, J.B.|first=|date=2003|title=Re-visualizing the digital divide as a digital spectrum|url=|journal=IT &amp; Society|volume=1 |issue=5|pages=23–39|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.15847/obsOBS612012513 |doi-broken-date=2018-05-29 |url=http://obs.obercom.pt/index.php/obs/article/view/513 |first1=Eugène |last1=Loos |title=Senior citizens: Digital immigrants in their own country? |journal=Observatorio |volume=6 |issue=1 |year=2012 |pages=1–23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loos, E.

=== Visual ageism ===
The term ''visual ageism'' was coined in 2018 by Loos and Ivan. They define ''visual ageism'' as “the social practice of visually underrepresenting older people or misrepresenting them in a prejudiced way”.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Loos. E. F., &amp; Ivan, L. (2018). Visual Ageism in the Media. In: L. Ayalon &amp; C. Tesch-Roemer (Eds.), ''Contemporary perspectives on ageism'' (pp. 163-176)''.'' Berlin: Springer. [https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-319-73820-8_11.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; We are facing a shift from visual ageism characterized by underrepresentation and the negative representation of older people to a representation of older age characterized by images of stereotypically third age older adults (enjoying life and living their golden years), while older adults in their fourth age (inactive and unable to live independently) remain invisible. A review of empirical studies conducted since 1950 in Europe and North America&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; reveals that print and television advertisements started this transition towards a more positive visual representation of older adults in their age during the last decade of the 20th century, followed by television programs some years later, while older adults in their fourth age remain invisible. This is probably due to the increase in third age rhetoric in the media, picturing older people as healthy and as potential consumers, enjoying life and living their golden years. Media representations of older people have moved from visual under- and misrepresentation (negative images)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Atkins | first1 = T. | last2 = Jenkins | first2 = M.

London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; These days, visual ageism in the media tends to come wrapped in the guise of the positive attributes of third age representations of older people, while adults in their fourth age continue to be underrepresented. One possible explanation for this is that healthy third agers might prefer not to be associated with fourth agers, as they remind them too starkly of what lies ahead in their own near future. Although this discomfort or even fear about mortality is undeniably common, from a societal point of view this kind of (self)ageism is hurtful to fourth agers as a group and in a sense to third agers as well, as they risk to become fourth agers themselves one day.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==Discrimination==
Age discrimination is the result of actions taken to deny or limit opportunities to people on the basis of age. These are usually actions taken as a result of one's ageist beliefs and attitudes. Age discrimination occurs on both a personal and institutional level.&lt;ref name="Quadagno" /&gt;

On a personal level, an older person may be told that he or she is too old to engage in certain physical activities, like an informal game of basketball between friends and family. A younger person may be told they are too young to get a job or help move the dining room table. On an institutional level, there are policies and regulations in place that limit opportunities to people of certain ages and deny them to all others. The law, for instance, requires that all people must be at least 16 years old in order to obtain a driver's license in the United States. There are also government regulations that determine when a worker may retire. Currently, in the US, a worker must be between 65 and 67 years old (depending upon his or her birth year) before becoming eligible for full Social Security retirement benefits (age 62 for 70% benefits) but some company pension plans begin benefits at earlier ages.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

A 2006/2007 survey done by the Children's Rights Alliance for England and the National Children's Bureau asked 4,060 children and young people whether they have ever been treated unfairly based on various criteria (race, age, sex, sexual orientation, etc.).  A total of 43% of British youth surveyed reported experiencing discrimination based on their age, far eclipsing other categories of discrimination like sex (27%), race (11%), or sexual orientation (6%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Carolyne |last1=Willow |first2=Anita |last2=Franklin |first3=Catherine |last3=Shaw |date=April 2007 |title=Meeting the obligations of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in England: children and young people's messages to government |url=http://dera.ioe.ac.uk/id/eprint/10935 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistently, a study based on the European Social Survey found that whereas 35% of Europeans reported exposure ageism, only 25% reported exposure to sexism and as few as 17% reported exposure to racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ayalon|first=Liat|title=Perceived Age, Gender, and Racial/Ethnic Discrimination in Europe: Results from the European Social Survey|journal=Educational Gerontology|year=2014|volume=40|issue=7|pages=499–517|doi=10.1080/03601277.2013.845490 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ageism has significant effects in two particular sectors: employment and health care. Age discrimination has contributed to disparities in health between men and women. Reducing ageism and sexism would promote improved doctor-patient relationships and reduce ageist stereotypes in the healthcare industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/josi.12157 |title=Ageism can be Hazardous to Women's Health: Ageism, Sexism, and Stereotypes of Older Women in the Healthcare System |journal=Journal of Social Issues |volume=72 |issue=1 |pages=86–104 |year=2016 |last1=Chrisler |first1=Joan C |last2=Barney |first2=Angela |last3=Palatino |first3=Brigida }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employment===
The concept of ageism was originally developed to refer to prejudice and discrimination against older people and middle age, but has expanded to include children and teenagers.&lt;ref name="Loretto"/&gt; Like [[racism|racial]] and [[gender discrimination]], age discrimination, at least when it affects younger workers, can result in unequal pay for equal work.  Unlike racial and gender discrimination, however, age discrimination in wages is often enshrined in law. For example, in both the United States&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/esa/minwage/q-a.htm Questions and Answers About the Minimum Wage], US Department of Labor&lt;/ref&gt; and the United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agepositive.gov.uk/news/minimum_wage.asp][[Age Positive]], [[Department for Work and Pensions]] in Sheffield and London&lt;/ref&gt; [[minimum wage]] laws allow for employers to pay lower wages to young workers.  Many state and local minimum wage laws mirror such an age-based, tiered minimum wage. As well, the [[Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938]] was amended in 1986 to allow the [[United States Secretary of Labor]] to provide special certificates to allow an employer to pay less than the minimum wage to individuals whose earning or productive capacity is impaired by age, physical or mental deficiency, or injury.&lt;ref name= s2884&gt;"[https://www.congress.gov/bill/99th-congress/senate-bill/2884?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22%5C%22fair+labor+standards%5C%22%22%5D%7D&amp;r=1 S.2884 — 99th Congress (1985-1986)]". ''United States Congress''. October 16, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; These employees must still be paid wages that are related to the individual's productivity and commensurate with those paid to similarly located and employed non-handicapped workers.&lt;ref name= s2884/&gt; Midlife workers, on average, make more than younger workers do, which reflects educational achievement and experience of various kinds (job-specific, industry-specific, etc.). The age-wage peak in the United States, according to Census data, is between 45 and 54 years of age. Seniority in general accords with respect as people age, lessening ageism. Statistical discrimination refers to limiting the employment opportunities of an individual based on stereotypes of a group to which the person belongs. Limited employment opportunities could come in the form of lower pay for equal work or jobs with little [[social mobility]]. Younger female workers were historically discriminated against, in comparison with younger men, because it was expected that, as young women of childbearing years, they would need to leave the work force permanently or periodically to have children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Edmund S. |last1=Phelps |date=September 1972 |title=The Statistical Theory of Racism and Sexism |journal=The American Economic Review |volume=62 |issue=4 |pages=659–61 |jstor=1806107 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Edmund_Phelps/publication/4728049_The_Statistical_Theory_of_Racism_and_Sexism/links/5494a5de0cf2ec1337581a8f/The-Statistical-Theory-of-Racism-and-Sexism.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, midlife female workers may also experience discrimination based on their appearance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.scaman.2013.07.002 |title=Women managers, careers and gendered ageism |journal=Scandinavian Journal of Management |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=175–85 |year=2014 |last1=Jyrkinen |first1=Marjut }}&lt;/ref&gt; and may feel less visible and undervalued&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0144686X07007003 |title=Visible and invisible ageing: Beauty work as a response to ageism |journal=Ageing and Society |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=653–74 |year=2008 |last1=Clarke |first1=Laura Hurd |last2=Griffin |first2=Meridith }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a culture where emphasis is on maintaining an approved standard of beauty, e.g. ‘thin, pretty, White, and young’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/08952841.2015.1125698 |title=There's a cream for that: A textual analysis of beauty and body-related advertisements aimed at middle-aged women |journal=Journal of Women &amp; Aging |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=185–97 |year=2016 |last1=Del Rosso |first1=Teri }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the same standard could have no effect on male colleagues of the same age.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Labor regulations also limit the age at which people are allowed to work and how many hours and under what conditions they may work.  In the United States, a person must generally be at least 14 years old to seek a job, and workers face additional restrictions on their work activities until they reach age 16.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/dol/topic/youthlabor/agerequirements.htm Youth &amp; Labor – Age Requirements], US Department of Labor&lt;/ref&gt; Many companies refuse to hire workers younger than 18. While older workers benefit more often from higher wages than do younger workers, they face barriers in promotions and hiring.  Employers also encourage [[Retirement|early retirement]] or [[layoff]]s disproportionately more for older or more experienced workers.

Some political offices have qualifications that discriminate on the basis of age as a proxy for experience, education, or accumulated wisdom. For example, the President of the United States must be at least 35 years old; a [[United States Senator]] must be at least 30; and a [[United States Congress]] member must be at least 25. In the UK, age discrimination against older people has been prohibited in employment since 2006. Since then, the number of age discrimination cases rose dramatically. The laws protect anyone over the age of 16 who is young as well as old. There were over 6,800 claims submitted to the Employment Tribunal in 2010/11 compared with just 900 in 2006/2007 (immediately after the Regulations came in force).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.agediscrimination.info/{{full citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the figures for 2011/2012 show a 47% fall in the number of claims, and commentators have suggested that the repeal of the [[Default Retirement Age]] may be the reason behind this.

Age discrimination in hiring has been shown to exist in the United States. The [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]]'s first complainants were female flight attendants complaining of (among other things) age discrimination.&lt;ref name="Collins2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gail Collins|title=When Everything Changed: The Amazing Journey of American Women from 1960 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sQ1HhzuaYkEC&amp;pg=PT59|date=14 October 2009|publisher=Little, Brown|isbn=978-0-316-07166-6|pages=59–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, the EEOC declared age restrictions on flight attendants’ employment to be illegal sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=K Barry |url=http://femininityinflight.com/activism.html |title=Timeline of Discrimination |publisher=Femininity in Flight |date= |accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Joanna Lahey, professor at [[The Bush School of Government and Public Service]] at [[Texas A&amp;M]], found recently that firms are more than 40% more likely to interview a young adult job applicant than an older job applicant.&lt;ref&gt;Lahey, J. (2005) [https://ideas.repec.org/p/crr/issbrf/ib33.html Do Older Workers Face Discrimination?] Boston College.&lt;/ref&gt; All states in the [[US]] prohibit youth under 14 from working with a handful of exceptions, and prohibit youth under 18 from working in hazardous occupations. They are also paid a lower minimum wage and not allowed to work full-time.

Also in Europe, pervasive levels of age discrimination are found in [[Belgium]], [[England]], [[France]], Spain, and Sweden. Job candidates revealing older age are found to get 39% (in Belgium) to 72% (in France) less job interview invitations compared to equal candidates revealing a younger name.&lt;ref name="Baert et al 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.joep.2016.10.002 |title=Getting grey hairs in the labour market.

=== Hollywood ===
Ageism in Hollywood, specifically in terms of women, is profound, from the way youth is praised to the lack of jobs for older actresses. The way youth is praised reflects directly on the way older women are presented in the media. President and CEO of the American Association of Advertising Agencies, O. Burtch Drake, spoke in terms of older women's representation throughout the media stating "older women are not being portrayed at all; there is no imagery to worry about."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Kleyman, Paul. "Images of Aging." ''Encyclopedia of Aging''. Ed. David J. Ekerdt. Vol. 2. New York: Macmillan Reference USA, 2002. 679-685. ''Gale Virtual Reference Library''.&lt;/ref&gt; Women over fifty are not the center of attention and if an actress is older they are expected to act anything but their age.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  These same women who have been acting since their teenage years, who have always been told to act their age, now must change the dynamic of their job by not acting their age when they get to be considered old by society and the media. The standards set in film are fixated upon youth - sexuality, beauty, physicality.  Movies that portray women acting their own age (i.e. a 50-year-old acting 50 years old) seems exaggerated and unrealistic because it does not fit the norms associated with women in film and media.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Women are forced to feel that they must continuously improve upon their looks to be seen and they can be replaced by a younger model of themselves. "Silver ceiling" references the new type of ceiling older workers in the entertainment industry, especially women, are being faced with. Underemployment of older actresses surpasses that of older actors because of the typical pairing of older actors with younger actresses in films.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; BBC news anchor, Nigel Kay, found in a survey that "on television older men significantly outnumber older women by about 70 percent to 30 percent."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; An issue amongst older women is that their voices are not being heard, which is especially true for older actresses in Hollywood. The issues about employment they are bringing to light as well as the complaints they have are not being taken seriously and they are being excluded from conversations about Hollywood and employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Being an Older Woman: A Study in the Social Production of Identity|last = Paoletti|first = Isabella|publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|year = 1998|isbn = 0-8058-2120-1|location = New Jersey|pages = 47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the limited ages the film industry portrays and the lack of older actresses, society as a whole has a type of illiteracy about sexuality and those of old age. There is an almost inherent bias about what older women are capable of, what they do, and how they feel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gender, Social Inequalities, and Aging|last = Calasanti|first = Toni M.|publisher = AltaMira Press|year = 2001|isbn = 0-7591-0185-X|location = Walnut Creek|pages = 79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst all ages of actresses there is the attempt to look youthful and fitting to the beauty standards by altering themselves physically, many times under the hands of plastic surgeons.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chivers | first1 = Sally | year = 2006 | title = Baby Jane Grew Up: The Dramatic Intersection Of Age With Disability | url = | journal = Canadian Review of American Studies | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 211–227 | doi=10.1353/crv.2006.0039}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women become frightful of what they will be seen as if they have wrinkles, cellulite, or any other signifier of aging.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Saucier | first1 = Maggi G | year = 2004 | title = Midlife And Beyond: Issues For Aging Women | url = | journal = Journal of Counseling &amp; Development | volume = 82 | issue = 4| pages = 420–425 | doi=10.1002/j.1556-6678.2004.tb00329.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; As women reach their forties and fifties, pressure to adhere to societal beauty norms seen amongst films and media intensifies in terms of new cosmetic procedures and products that will maintain a "forever youthful" look.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  In terms of sexuality, older women are seen as unattractive, bitter, unhappy, unsuccessful in films.  With older women not being represented in the media and film industries, specifically in Hollywood, thoughts of underachievement, ugliness, and disgust crowd the thoughts of older women as they fail to meet beauty norms.  This can cause depression, anxiety, and self-esteem issues in general.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; "In one survey, women reported feeling more embarrassed about their age than by their masturbation practices or same-gender sexual encounters."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Women are forced to feel that they must continuously improve upon their looks to be seen and they can be replaced by a younger model of themselves.

The ideal that younger actresses are better than older actresses in Hollywood can be seen by the preferences of the people who are watching movies. Movie spectators display discrimination against older women in Hollywood. A study between 1926-1999 proved that older men in Hollywood had more leading roles than women who were the same age as them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Psychology At The Movies|last = Young|first = Skip Dine|publisher = Wiley-Blackwell|year = 2012|isbn = 978-0-470-97177-2|location = West Sussex|pages = 91}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many cases where leading actors play the attractive love interest for longer than women.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This portrayal of women never aging but men aging can have a negative affect on not only actresses in Hollywood but also women who are not in the media.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  There are fewer older actresses that get leading roles than young actresses, this promotes the idea that women do not age and that older women are less attractive. This can be harmful to women because they will strive for something that is impossible to have, eternal youth.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

What some people think of as old other people may not. An actress in Hollywood may not consider herself old but can be told she is too old for a part. A very well known example of this is what happened to the actress Maggie Gyllenhaal, "she was recently turned down for a role in a movie because she was too old to play the love interest for a 55-year-old man."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Maggie Gyllenhaal on Hollywood Ageism: I Was Told 37 Is 'Too Old' for a 55-Year-Old Love Interest|url = http://www.thewrap.com/maggie-gyllenhaal-on-hollywood-ageism-i-was-told-37-is-too-old-for-a-55-year-old-love-interest/|website = TheWrap|accessdate = 9 December 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a woman is told she is old she can start to believe that she is. A woman can start acting as if she is older than she believes because she internalizes what other people are saying and what they think about her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Social World of Old Women: Management of Self-Identity|last = Matthews|first = Sarah H.|publisher = Sage Publication|year = 1979|isbn = 0-8039-1225-0|location = Beverly Hills, CA|pages = 166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In film the female body is depicted in different states of dress, and portrayed differently depending on the age of the actress. Their clothing is used as an identity marker of the character. Young women are put into revealing and sexy costumes whereas older women often play the part of a mother or grandmother clad in appropriate attire. This can include a bonnet or apron as she carries about her matronly duties.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Aging Bodies:The Aging Female Body|last = Markson|first = Elizabeth|publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|year = 2003|isbn = 0-7591-0236-8|location = Lanham, Maryland|pages = 78, 79, 80–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can lead both men and women to perceive the female body in a certain way based on what is seen on screen. Annette Kuhn said twenty years ago that "One of the major theoretical contributions of the women's movement has been its insistence on the significance of cultural factors, in particular in the form of socially dominant representations of women and the ideological character of such representation, both in constituting the category 'woman' and in delimiting and defining what has been called the 'sex-gender system'"&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Women's bodies are often seen as an object to be looked at and desired by men. As women get older and enter their post-menopausal years, they no longer are examples of the ideal feminine model. Added to that is the idea that females become mentally unstable as they enter their older years. "They become quarrelsome, vexatious and overbearing, petty and stingy; that is to say they exhibit typically sadistic and anal-erotic traits that they did not possess earlier...(Freud 1958,323-24)"&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Ageism is not new to Hollywood and has been around since the time of silent films. When transitioning from silent movies to talking motion pictures, Charlie Chaplin (a well known silent movie actor) said in an interview that "It's beauty that matters in pictures-nothing else....Pictures! Lovely looking girls...What if the girls can't act?...Certainly I prefer to see, say, Dolores Costello [a 1920s silent movie star], in a thin tale than some aged actress of the stage (Walker 1979,132)".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Healthcare===
There is considerable evidence of discrimination against the elderly in health care.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agediscrimination.info/News/Pages/ItemPage.aspx?Item=553 Complaints soar as 'age discrimination within NHS' leaves elderly neglected].

Agediscrimination.info (18 March 2011). Retrieved on 11 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly true for aspects of the physician-patient interaction, such as screening procedures, information exchanges, and treatment decisions. In the patient-physician interaction, physicians and other health care providers may hold attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors that are associated with ageism against older patients. Studies have found that some physicians do not seem to show any care or concern toward treating the medical problems of older people. Then, when actually interacting with these older patients on the job, the doctors sometimes view them with disgust and describe them in negative ways, such as "depressing" or "crazy."&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nelson | first1 = T. D. | year = 2005 | title = Ageism: Prejudice against our feared future self | journal = Journal of Social Issues | volume = 61 | issue = 2| pages = 207–221 | doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.2005.00402.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For screening procedures, elderly people are less likely than younger people to be screened for cancers and, due to the lack of this preventative measure, less likely to be diagnosed at early stages of their conditions.&lt;ref name="Robb"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robb | first1 = C. | last2 = Hongbin | first2 = C. | last3 = Haley | first3 = W.

After being diagnosed with a disease that may be potentially curable, older people are further discriminated against. Though there may be surgeries or operations with high survival rates that might cure their condition, older patients are less likely than younger patients to receive all the necessary treatments. For example, health professionals pursue less aggressive treatment options in older patients,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Learning to be old: Gender, culture, and aging |edition=2nd |last = Cruikshank|first = Margaret|publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year = 2009|isbn = |location = Lanham, MD|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and fewer adults are enrolled in tests of new prescription drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Disparate inclusion of older adults in clinical trials: Priorities and opportunities for policy and practice change|last = Herrera|first = Angelica P.|date = 2010|journal = American Journal of Public Health|doi = 10.2105/ajph.2009.162982 |pmid = 20147682|volume=100 |pages=S105–S112 |pmc=2837461}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been posited that this is because doctors fear their older patients are not physically strong enough to tolerate the curative treatments and are more likely to have complications during surgery that may end in death.

Other research studies have been done with patients with heart disease, and, in these cases, the older patients were still less likely to receive further tests or treatments, independent of the severity of their health problems. Thus, the approach to the treatment of older people is concentrated on managing the disease rather than preventing or curing it. This is based on the stereotype that it is the natural process of aging for the quality of health to decrease, and, therefore, there is no point in attempting to prevent the inevitable decline of old age.&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robb" /&gt;

Furthermore, caregivers further undermine the treatment of older patients by helping them too much, which decreases independence,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A primer on medication use in older adults for the non-clinician|last = Peron|first = Emily P.|date = 2011–2012|journal = Generations|doi = |pmid = |last2 = Ruby|first2 = Christine M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by making a generalized assumption and treating all elderly as feeble.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Differential medical treatment of elderly people can have significant effects on their health outcomes, a differential outcome which somehow escapes established protections.

In 2017, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled in favor of Maria Ivone Carvalho Pinto de Sousa Morais, who had had an operation that was mishandled and rendered her unable to have sex. Portuguese judges had previously reduced damages to her in 2014, ruling then that the operation, which occurred when she was 50, had happened at "an age when sex is not as important as in younger years." The [[European Court of Human Rights]] rejected that decision, with the majority's ruling stating in part, "The question at issue here is not considerations of age or sex as such, but rather the assumption that sexuality is not as important for a 50-year-old woman and mother of two children as for someone of a younger age. That assumption reflects a traditional idea of female sexuality as being essentially linked to childbearing purposes and thus ignores its physical and psychological relevance for the self-fulfillment of women as people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By SEWELL CHANJULY 25, 2017 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/25/world/europe/sex-after-50-portugal-european-court.html |title=Sex for Women After 50 Is Important After All, European Court Rules - The New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2017 |accessdate=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of ageism==
Ageism has significant effects on the elderly and young people. These effects might be seen within different levels: individual person, selected company, whole economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prokurat|first=Sergiusz|date=2012|title=Age Management as a Tool for the Demographic Decline in the 21st Century: An Overview of its Characteristics|url=http://www.jemi.edu.pl/vol-8-issue-4-2012/age-management-as-a-tool-for-the-demographic-decline-in-the-21st-century-an-overview-of-its-characteristics|journal=Journal of Entrepreneurship, Management and Innovation|volume=8/2012|pages=83–96|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stereotypes and infantilization of older and younger people by patronizing language affects older and younger people's self-esteem and behaviors. After repeatedly hearing a stereotype that older or younger people are useless, older and younger people may begin to feel like dependent, non-contributing members of society. They may start to perceive themselves in terms of the [[looking-glass self]]—that is, in the same ways that others in society see them. Studies have also specifically shown that when older and younger people hear these stereotypes about their supposed incompetence and uselessness, they perform worse on measures of competence and memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levy | first1 = B | year = 1996 | title = Improving memory in old age by implicit self-stereotyping | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 71 | issue = 6| pages = 1092–1107 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.71.6.1092}}&lt;/ref&gt; These stereotypes then become [[self-fulfilling prophecies]]. According to [[Becca Levy]]'s [[Stereotype embodiment theory|Stereotype Embodiment Theory]], older and younger people might also engage in self-stereotypes, taking their culture's age stereotypes—to which they have been exposed over the life course—and directing them inward toward themselves. Then this behavior reinforces the present stereotypes and treatment of the elderly.&lt;ref name="Levy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt;

Many overcome these stereotypes and live the way they want, but it can be difficult to avoid deeply ingrained prejudice, especially if one has been exposed to ageist views in childhood or adolescence.

Age discrimination laws at the national level were strengthened by the Age Discrimination Act 2004, which helps to ensure that people are not subjected to age discrimination in various areas of public life, including employment, the provision of goods and services, education, and the administration of Australian government laws and programs. The Act, however, does provide for exemptions in some areas, as well as providing for positive discrimination, that is, actions which assist people of a particular age who experience a disadvantage because of their age.&lt;ref name="ahrc" /&gt;

In 2011, for the first time a position of Age Discrimination Commissioner was created within the Australian Human Rights Commission. The new Commissioner's responsibilities include raising awareness among employers about the beneficial contributions that senior Australians as well as younger employees can make in the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agediscrimination.info/News/Pages/ItemPage.aspx?Item=431 In Australia, new age discrimination laws have been passed by the Federal Parliament; a position of Age Discrimination Commissioner has been created in the Australian Human Rights Commission for the first time].

In September 2016, California passed state bill AB-1687, an anti-ageism law taking effect on January 1, 2017, requiring "commercial online entertainment employment" services that allow paid subscribers to submit information and resumes (such as [[IMDB Pro]]), to honor requests to have their ages and birthdays removed.

===European Union===
The [[European Union|European]] citizenship provides the right to protection from discrimination on the grounds of age. According to Article 21-1 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|Charter of Fundamental Rights]] of the [[European Union]] [[s:Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union#CHAPTER III.

[[Barbara Robb]], founder of the British pressure group, [[Aid for the Elderly in Government Institutions]] (AEGIS), compiled ''Sans Everything: A Case to Answer'', a controversial book detailing the inadequacies of care provided for older people, which prompted a nationwide scandal in the UK in 1976.  Although initially official inquiries into these allegations reported that they were "totally unfounded or grossly exaggerated",&lt;ref&gt;'Sans Everything (Reports of Inquiries)' ''Hansard'' HC Deb 09 July 1968 vol 768 cc213–6, 214&lt;/ref&gt; her campaigns led to revealing of other instances of ill treatment which were accepted and prompted the government to implement NHS policy changes.&lt;ref name="Anon 1974"&gt;Anon, 'Disturbing report on a hospital: health authorities to be asked to review standards of care' ''Times'', 16 May 1974, 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocacy campaigns==
{{Cleanup rewrite|it has a completely different focus than the rest of the article, which focuses on ageism against the elderly|section|date=August 2015}}
Many current and historical [[intergenerational equity|intergenerational]] and [[youth programs]] have been created to address the issue of Ageism. Among the advocacy organizations created in the United Kingdom to challenge age discrimination are [[Age UK]] and the [[British Youth Council]].

In the United States there have been several historic and current efforts to challenge Ageism. The earliest example may be the [[Newsboys Strike of 1899]], which fought ageist employment practices targeted against youth by large newspaper syndicates in the Northeast. During the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] Administration, [[First Lady]] [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] was active in the national [[youth movement]], including the formation of the [[National Youth Administration]] and the defense of the [[American Youth Congress]]. She made several statements on behalf of youth and against Ageism. In one report entitled, "Facing the Problems of Youth," Roosevelt said of youth,

:"We cannot simply expect them to say, 'Our older people have had experience and they have proved to themselves certain things, therefore they are right.' That isn't the way the best kind of young people think. They want to experience for themselves. I find they are perfectly willing to talk to older people, but they don't want to talk to older people who are shocked by their ideas, nor do they want to talk to older people who are not realistic."&lt;ref&gt;Roosevelt, A.E. (1935) [http://newdeal.feri.org/er/er21.htm "Facing the Problems of Youth,"] ''National Parent-Teacher Magazine 29''(30). Retrieved 7/30/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] formed in 1960 to promote democratic opportunities for all people regardless of age, and the [[Gray Panthers]] was formed in 1970 by [[Maggie Kuhn]], with a goal of eliminating Ageism in all forms.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, M., Long, C. and Quinn, L. (1991) ''No Stone Unturned: the Life and Times of Maggie Kuhn.'' Ballantine Books.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Three O'Clock Lobby]] formed in 1976 to promote [[youth participation]] throughout traditionally ageist government structures in Michigan, while [[Youth Liberation of Ann Arbor]] started in 1970 to promote youth and fight Ageism.

[[Aid for the Elderly in Government Institutions]] (AEGIS) was a British [[pressure group]] that campaigned to improve the care of older people in long-stay wards of [[National Health Service]] [[psychiatric hospitals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.lse.ac.uk/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&amp;id=AEGIS|title=AEGIS - AEGIS (Aid to the Elderly in Government Institutions)|website=LSE Library Services|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitewash"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Whitewash in the old folks’ wards|last=Robinson|first=Anne|date=5 April 1970|work=Sunday Times|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was founded by [[Barbara Robb]] in 1965,&lt;ref name="Whitewash" /&gt; and was active until Robb's death in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=The patients’ campaigner|last=|first=|date=25 June 1976|work=Hampstead and Highgate Express|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sojourner Truth c1864.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Sojourner Truth]]

"'''Ain't I a Woman?'''" is the name given to a speech, delivered extemporaneously, by [[Sojourner Truth]], (1797–1883), born into slavery in New York State. Some time after gaining her freedom in 1827, she became a well known anti-slavery speaker. Her speech was delivered at the Women's Convention in [[Akron, Ohio]], on May 29, 1851, and did not originally have a title.

The speech was briefly reported in two contemporary newspapers, and a transcript of the speech was published in the ''Anti-Slavery Bugle'' on June 21, 1851. It received wider publicity in 1863 during the [[American Civil War]] when [[Frances Dana Barker Gage]] published a different version, one which became known as '''''Ain't I a Woman?''''' because of its oft-repeated question. This later, better known and more widely available version has been the one referenced by most historians.

==Background==

[[File:Am I Not A Woman And A Sister.jpg|thumb|right|1830s image of a slave woman saying "Am I Not a Woman and a Sister?"]]
The phrase "Am I not a man and a brother?" had been used by British [[Abolitionism|abolitionists]] since the late 18th century to decry the inhumanity of slavery.&lt;ref name=Glorying&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aLrm4MZBry4C&amp;pg=RA2-PA1840 |page=1840 |title=Glorying in Tribulation: The Life Work of Sojourner Truth |first= Erlene |last=Stetson |first2=Linda |last2=David |publisher=MSU Press |date=August 31, 1994 |isbn=9780870139086}}&lt;/ref&gt; This male motto was first turned female in the 1820s by British abolitionists,&lt;ref name=Midgley&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zQVHWXADuRYC&amp;pg=PA134 |page=134 |title=Women's Rights and Transatlantic Antislavery in the Era of Emancipation |editor=Kathryn Kish Sklar, James Brewer Stewart |chapter=British Abolition and Feminism in Transatlantic Perspective |last=Midgley |first=Clare |publisher=Yale University Press |date=2007 |isbn=9780300137866}}&lt;/ref&gt; then in 1830 the American abolitionist newspaper ''[[Genius of Universal Emancipation]]'' carried an image of a slave woman asking "Am I not a woman and a sister?"&lt;ref name=Glorying/&gt; This image was widely republished in the 1830s, and struck into a copper coin or token, but without the question mark, to give the question a positive answer.&lt;ref name=Midgley/&gt; In 1833, African American activist [[Maria W. Stewart]] used the words of this motto to argue for the rights of women of every race. Historian [[Jean Fagan Yellin]] argued in 1989 that this motto served as inspiration for Sojourner Truth, who was well aware of the great difference in the level of oppression of white versus black women. Truth was asserting both her sex and race by asking the crowd, "Am I not a woman?"&lt;ref name=Glorying/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a_TXmd_GotkC&amp;pg=PA37 |pages=37–38 |title=The Cambridge Companion to Feminist Literary Theory |editor=Ellen Rooney |chapter=On canons: anxious history and the rise of black feminist literary studies |last=Ducille |first=Ann |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=July 6, 2006 |isbn=9781139826631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Different versions==
The first reports of the speech were published by the ''[[New York Tribune]]'' on June 6, 1851, and by ''[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|The Liberator]]'' five days later. Both of these accounts were brief, lacking a full transcription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=16rQl2WT_-gC&amp;pg=PA18 |title=Sojourner Truth as orator: wit, story, and song |page=18 |last1=Fitch |first1=Suzanne Pullon |last2=Mandziuk |first2=Roseann M. |publisher=Greenwood |year=1997 |isbn=0-313-30068-2 |series=Great American Orators |volume=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first complete transcription was published on June 21 in the ''Anti-Slavery Bugle'' by Marius Robinson, an abolitionist and newspaper editor who acted as the convention's recording secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brezina |first=Corona |title=Sojourner Truth's "Ain't I a woman?" speech: a primary source investigation |year=2004 |publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group |isbn=978-1-4042-0154-5 |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question "Ain't I a Woman" does not appear in his account.&lt;ref name=Mabee/&gt;

Twelve years later, in May 1863, [[Frances Dana Barker Gage]] published a very different transcription. In it, she gave Truth many of the speech characteristics of Southern slaves, and she included new material that Robinson had not reported. Gage's version of the speech was republished in 1875, 1881, and 1889, and became the historic standard. This version is known as "Ain't I a Woman?" after its oft-repeated refrain.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, Maxine Leeds.

Additions that Gage made to Truth's speech include the ideas that she could bear the lash as well as a man, that no one ever offered her the traditional gentlemanly deference due a woman, and that most of her 13 children were sold away from her into slavery. Truth is widely believed to have had five children, with one sold away, and was never known to claim more children.&lt;ref name=Mabee&gt;Mabee, Carleton; Susan Mabee Newhouse. ''Sojourner Truth: Slave, Prophet, Legend'', NYU Press, 1995, pp. 67–82. {{ISBN|0-8147-5525-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further inaccuracies in Gage's 1863 account conflict with her own contemporary report: Gage wrote in 1851 that Akron in general and the press in particular were largely friendly to the woman's rights convention, but in 1863 she wrote that the convention leaders were fearful of the "mobbish" opponents.&lt;ref name=Mabee/&gt; Other eyewitness reports of Truth's speech told a different story, one where all faces were "beaming with joyous gladness" at the session where Truth spoke; that not "one discordant note" interrupted the harmony of the proceedings.&lt;ref name=Mabee/&gt; In contrast to Gage's later version, Truth was warmly received by the convention-goers, the majority of whom were long-standing abolitionists, friendly to progressive ideas of race and civil rights.&lt;ref name=Mabee/&gt;

==The speech==

===1851 version by Robinson===

Marius Robinson, who attended the convention and worked with Truth, printed the speech as he transcribed it in the June 21, 1851, issue of the ''Anti-Slavery Bugle''.&lt;ref name="Sojourner TruthInstitute"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sojournertruth.org/History/Biography/NY.htm |title=Amazing Life page |work=Sojourner Truth Institute site |accessdate=28 December 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230173538/http://www.sojournertruth.org/History/Biography/NY.htm |archivedate=30 December 2006 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|One of the most unique and interesting speeches of the convention was made by Sojourner Truth, an emancipated slave. It is impossible to transfer it to paper, or convey any adequate idea of the effect it produced upon the audience. Those only can appreciate it who saw her powerful form, her whole-souled, earnest gesture, and listened to her strong and truthful tones. She came forward to the platform and addressing the President said with great simplicity: "May I say a few words?" Receiving an affirmative answer, she proceeded:&lt;ref name=Marable&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CkxHDoN5WxYC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;lpg=PA67 |pages=67–68 |title=Let Nobody Turn Us Around: Voices of Resistance, Reform, and Renewal: an African American Anthology |last=Marable |first=Manning |date=2003 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=9780847683468}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|I want to say a few words about this matter. I am a woman's rights.{{sic}} I have as much muscle as any man, and can do as much work as any man. I have plowed and reaped and husked and chopped and mowed, and can any man do more than that? I have heard much about the sexes being equal. I can carry as much as any man, and can eat as much too, if I can get it. I am as strong as any man that is now. As for intellect, all I can say is, if a woman have a pint, and a man a quart – why can't she have her little pint full? You need not be afraid to give us our rights for fear we will take too much, – for we can't take more than our pint'll hold. The poor men seems to be all in confusion, and don't know what to do. Why children, if you have woman's rights, give it to her and you will feel better. You will have your own rights, and they won't be so much trouble. I can't read, but I can hear. I have heard the bible and have learned that Eve caused man to sin. Well, if woman upset the world, do give her a chance to set it right side up again. The Lady has spoken about Jesus, how he never spurned woman from him, and she was right. When Lazarus died, Mary and Martha came to him with faith and love and besought him to raise their brother. And Jesus wept and Lazarus came forth. And how came Jesus into the world? Through God who created him and the woman who bore him. Man, where was your part? But the women are coming up blessed be God and a few of the men are coming up with them. But man is in a tight place, the poor slave is on him, woman is coming on him, he is surely between a hawk and a buzzard.&lt;ref name=Marable/&gt;}}

===1863 version by Gage===
The speech was recalled 12 years after the fact by Gage, an activist in the [[Women's rights|woman's rights]] and [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]] movements. Gage, who presided at the meeting, described the event:&lt;ref&gt;''History of Woman Suffrage'', 2nd ed. Vol.1, Rochester, NY: Charles Mann, 1889, edited by [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], [[Susan B. Anthony]], and [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The leaders of the movement trembled on seeing a tall, gaunt black woman in a gray dress and white turban, surmounted with an uncouth sunbonnet, march deliberately into the church, walk with the air of a queen up the aisle, and take her seat upon the pulpit steps. A buzz of disapprobation was heard all over the house, and there fell on the listening ear, 'An abolition affair!" "Woman's rights and niggers!" "I told you so!" "Go it, darkey!" . . Again and again, timorous and trembling ones came to me and said, with earnestness, "Don't let her speak, Mrs. Gage, it will ruin us. Every newspaper in the land will have our cause mixed up with abolition and niggers, and we shall be utterly denounced." My only answer was, "We shall see when the time comes."

The second day the work waxed warm. Methodist, Baptist, Episcopal, Presbyterian, and Universalist minister came in to hear and discuss the resolutions presented. One claimed superior rights and privileges for man, on the ground of "superior intellect"; another, because of the "manhood of [[Christ]]; if God had desired the equality of woman, He would have given some token of His will through the birth, life, and death of the Saviour." Another gave us a theological view of the "sin of our first mother."

There were very few women in those days who dared to "speak in meeting"; and the august teachers of the people were seemingly getting the better of us, while the boys in the galleries, and the sneerers among the pews, were hugely enjoying the discomfiture as they supposed, of the "strong-minded." Some of the tender-skinned friends were on the point of losing dignity, and the atmosphere betokened a storm. When, slowly from her seat in the corner rose Sojourner Truth, who, till now, had scarcely lifted her head. "Don't let her speak!" gasped half a dozen in my ear. She moved slowly and solemnly to the front, laid her old bonnet at her feet, and turned her great speaking eyes to me. There was a hissing sound of disapprobation above and below. I rose and announced, "Sojourner Truth," and begged the audience to keep silence for a few moments.

The tumult subsided at once, and every eye was fixed on this almost Amazon form, which stood nearly six feet high, head erect, and eyes piercing the upper air like one in a dream. At her first word there was a profound hush. She spoke in deep tones, which, though not loud, reached every ear in the house, and away through the throng at the doors and windows.}}

The following is the speech as Gage recalled it in ''[[History of Woman Suffrage]]'' which was, according to her, in the original dialect as it was presented by Sojourner Truth:

{{quote|"Wall, chilern, whar dar is so much racket dar must be somethin' out o' kilter. I tink dat 'twixt de niggers of de Souf and de womin at de Norf, all talkin' 'bout rights, de white men will be in a fix pretty soon. But what's all dis here talkin' 'bout?

"Dat man ober dar say dat womin needs to be helped into carriages, and lifted ober ditches, and to hab de best place everywhar. Nobody eber helps me into carriages, or ober mud-puddles, or gibs me any best place!" And raising herself to her full height, and her voice to a pitch like rolling thunder, she asked. "And a'n't I a woman? Look at me! Look at my arm! (and she bared her right arm to the shoulder, showing her tremendous muscular power). I have ploughed, and planted, and gathered into barns, and no man could head me! And a'n't I a woman? I could work as much and eat as much as a man—when I could get it—and bear de lash as well! And a'n't, I a woman? I have borne thirteen chilern, and seen 'em mos' all sold off to slavery, and when I cried out with my mother's grief, none but Jesus heard me! And a'n't I a woman?

"Den dey talks 'bout dis ting in de head; what dis dey call it?" ("Intellect," whispered some one near.) "Dat's it, honey. What's dat got to do wid womin's rights or nigger's rights? If my cup won't hold but a pint, and yourn holds a quart, wouldn't ye be mean not to let me have my little half-measure full?" And she pointed her significant finger, and sent a keen glance at the minister who had made the argument. The cheering was long and loud.

"Den dat little man in black dar, he say women can't have as much rights as men, 'cause Christ wan't a woman! Whar did your Christ come from?" Rolling thunder couldn't have stilled that crowd, as did those deep, wonderful tones, as she stood there with outstretched arms and eyes of fire. Raising her voice still louder, she repeated, "Whar did your Christ come from? From God and a woman! Man had nothin' to do wid Him." Oh, what a rebuke that was to that little man.

Turning again to another objector, she took up the defense of Mother Eve. I can not follow her through it all. It was pointed, and witty, and solemn; eliciting at almost every sentence deafening applause; and she ended by asserting: "If de fust woman God ever made was strong enough to turn de world upside down all alone, dese women togedder (and she glanced her eye over the platform) ought to be able to turn it back, and get it right side up again! And now dey is asking to do it, de men better let 'em." Long-continued cheering greeted this. "'Bleeged to ye for hearin' on me, and now ole Sojourner han't got nothin' more to say."&lt;ref name="Woman Suffrage 116"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofwomansu01stanuoft |title=History of Woman Suffrage |volume=1 |page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Gage described the result: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Amid roars of applause, she returned to her corner, leaving more than one of us with streaming eyes, and hearts beating with gratitude. She had taken us up in her strong arms and carried us safely over the slough of difficulty turning the whole tide in our favor. I have never in my life seen anything like the magical influence that subdued the mobbish spirit of the day, and turned the sneers and jeers of an excited crowd into notes of respect and admiration. Hundreds rushed up to shake hands with her, and congratulate the glorious old mother, and bid her God-speed on her mission of 'testifyin' agin concerning the wickedness of this 'ere people.'&lt;ref name="Woman Suffrage 116"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legacy==
There is no single, undisputed official version of Truth's speech. Robinson and Truth were friends who had worked together concerning both abolition of slavery and women's rights, and his report is strictly his recollection with no added commentary. Since Robinson's version was published in the ''Anti-Slavery Bugle'', the audience is largely concerned with the rights of African Americans rather than women; it is possible Robinson's version is framed for his audience. Although Truth collaborated with Robinson on the transcription of her speech, Truth did not dictate his writing word for word.&lt;ref name=pedagogy2010&gt;{{cite journal |last=Siebler |first=Kay |title=Teaching the Politics of Sojourner Truth's "Ain't I a Woman?" |journal=Pedagogy |date=Fall 2010 |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=511–533 |url=http://pedagogy.dukejournals.org/content/10/3/511.full.pdf |accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The historically accepted standard version of the speech was written by Gage, but there are no reports of Gage working with Truth on the transcription.&lt;ref name=pedagogy2010 /&gt; Gage portrays Truth as using a Southern dialect, which the earliest reports of the speech do not mention. Truth is said to have prided herself on her spoken English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Larry | last = Murphy | author-link = | title = Sojourner Truth: A Biography | publisher = Greenwood | year = 2001 | page = xiv | isbn = 978-0-313-35728-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dialect in Gage's 1863 version is less severe than in her later version of the speech that she published in 1881. The rearticulation in the different published versions of Gage's writings serve as the [[metonymic]] transfiguration of Truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mandziuk|first=Roseann M.|author2=Suzanne Pullon Fitch|title=The rhetorical construction of Sojourner truth|journal=Southern Communication Journal|year=2001|volume=66|issue=2|pages=120–138|doi=10.1080/10417940109373192|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10417940109373192#.UmcV8fk72So|accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the crowd Truth addressed that day consisted of mainly white, privileged women.  In Gage's recollection, she describes that the crowd did not want Truth to speak because they did not want people to confuse the cause of suffrage with abolition, despite many reports that Truth was welcomed with respect. Although Gage's version provides further context, it is written as a narrative: she adds her own commentary, creating an entire scene of the event, including the audience reactions. Because Gage's version is built primarily on her interpretation and the way she chose to portray it, it cannot be considered a pure representation of the event.&lt;ref name=pedagogy2010 /&gt;

| ShortSummary    = Police Sergeant David Budd, an Afghanistan War veteran, is on a train to [[Euston railway station|London Euston]] when he foils a suicide bomber's plot to blow up the train. Due to his actions, both terrorist suspects avoid being shot, enabling them to be arrested. His heroism results in his promotion to serve on the detail of Julia Montague, the [[Home Secretary]]. There is tension between the two, with Montague's steadfast support of the [[Iraq War]] and [[War in Afghanistan]] and plans to infringe [[civil liberties]] by updating [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000|RIPA]] conflicting with Budd's experience as a soldier. Her ex-husband and [[Chief Whip]] Roger Penhaligon suspects her of exploiting the terrorist threat, and that she intends to launch a bid to replace the Prime Minister. Meanwhile, Budd struggles to deal with both his [[PTSD]] and his deteriorating relationship with his wife. Budd meets Andy Apsted, an old army friend, in the [[anti-war]] Veterans Peace Group. Apsted is disgusted with his friend's new career.

| ShortSummary    = Stephen Hunter-Dunn, [[Director General of MI5]], informs Montague of intelligence suggesting a terrorist plan to attack Budd's children's school, in retaliation for his foiling of the train bombing. He advises her to keep it secret, fearing a member of the police might have leaked Budd's information to the terrorists. Montague later controversially transfers investigation of the foiled bombing to [[MI5]]. The attack on the school is prevented by a police [[armed response vehicle|ARV]], but the terrorists manage to detonate the bomb in the street, killing five police officers. Budd's family is relocated to a [[safe house]], and although he is removed from Montague's detail, she has him reinstated. She also arranges the offer of a place at a special school for Budd's son. Returning from a [[Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms|COBRA]] meeting, Montague's car comes under sniper fire that kills her driver, but she and Budd survive due to the car's armour plating. Budd pursues and corners the sniper, revealed to be Apsted, who kills himself. That evening, Budd and Montague have sex. The next day he is instructed by Sampson and his superior, CSU Lorraine Craddock, to record Montague's meetings. They also tell him she had prior knowledge that his children's school would be targeted.

| ShortSummary    = Montague is given a tablet by a man calling himself Richard Longcross, containing compromising information about the Prime Minister.  Budd believes Longcross is an alias he is with the security service. Montague corners the PM at [[Chequers]] unannounced, and appears to blackmail him into organising a [[cabinet reshuffle|reshuffle]] that would allow her to take his place. Budd is interviewed by [[Counter Terrorism Command]] detectives Sharma and Rayburn, who seem unconvinced by his account of the sniper attack. RIPA 18 passes the third [[House of Commons]] vote. Travis meets Penhaligon to express concern about Montague's relationship with MI5. Budd and Montague's relationship deteriorates when he accidentally attacks her during a PTSD fit. Before Montague gives her speech at St. Matthew's College, she confesses to Budd that she knew his children's school was a possible target. She says she wants him by her side, not because it is his job, but through choice. As she is giving her speech, Budd sees her PR advisor Tahir Mahmood outside the auditorium, but allows him in after checking his briefcase. However, seconds later, as Mahmood approaches the stage, a bomb explodes.

| ShortSummary    =  Knowles and Mahmood were killed in the blast and Montague is in intensive care. Mike Travis, her junior [[Minister of State]], is appointed Acting Home Secretary and transfers responsibility for investigating the bombings back to Counter Terrorism Command. The police believe that Mahmood was responsible for the bombing, although CCTV is not conclusive that the explosion emanated from the briefcase. Budd falls under suspicion for not spotting the bomb when he spoke to Mahmood. DCI Sharma and DS Rayburn interview him and search his property. The next day, the PM announces that Montague is dead. CCTV from the House of Commons shows adviser Rob MacDonald handing Mahmood the briefcase. Before he is interviewed by police, Travis tells him to stick to their pre-arranged story. Budd attempts suicide, but fails because someone has replaced the bullets in his hidden pistol with [[blank rounds|blanks]]. Returning to Montague's hotel, he discovers the security footage has been tampered with to delete Longcross's visit. On orders from Sampson, he accompanies Rayburn to interview Nadia about who had supplied the explosives for the foiled train attack, but she does not identify the bomb-maker among the pictures she is shown, which include one of Mahmood.

| ShortSummary    = Analysis establishes that the bomb was not in the briefcase, but under the stage. Rayburn discovers that CCTV footage from before the attack was altered, and Budd creates an [[E-FIT]] of Longcross. Apsted is identified by [[SO15]], with his past as an army [[Explosive ordnance disposal|EOD]] officer raising suspicion that he might have been the bomb maker. Nadia identifies Longcross as the man her husband met. Budd researches the ''[[kompromat]]'' Montague was given, and ambushes Penhaligon at his [[Surgery (politics)|constituency surgery]], accusing him of trying to steal the tablet while she was in hospital. Hunter-Dunn denies any association with Longcross, but still refuses to share information with police. MacDonald reveals he and the party planned to embarrass Montague by altering her speech, but never intended physical harm. Budd meets with a gun dealer and attempts to acquire the same type of sniper rifle Apsted used. Luke Aikens (the man who collected Chanel after she was fired) is revealed to be a figure in organised crime, another party threatened by RIPA 18's surveillance. When information regarding Budd's relationship with Montague and his attempted suicide is leaked, Craddock suspends him from duty and revokes his firearms license. He visits Montague's flat and finds the tablet hidden in a photo frame.

| Viewers         = 17.06
| ShortSummary    = Aikens abducts Budd and fits him in a suicide vest with a [[dead man's switch]]. He emerges onto a street and police officers do not believe his story and suspect Budd's involvement in the conspiracy via Apsted. MI5 is monitoring the scene; suspecting that he is being watched, Budd gives false information about the location of the ''kompromat'', and MI5 sends Longcross to retrieve it. However, Budd has booby-trapped the flat with tear gas, which temporarily blinds Longcross, who is then arrested. After a stand-off, Vicky runs towards Budd to prevent the police from shooting him. Still wearing the vest, Budd leads the police to his flat, where Vicky gives them the ''kompromat'' and the blank rounds that confirm Budd's innocence. The explosives officer helps Budd disarm the vest. Budd flees to Dyson's flat and forces her to get Aikens to meet his [[police corruption|police insider]]. Budd follows him and discovers Craddock is the insider. She confesses to providing information about Montague's movements that enabled her assassination and to choosing Budd to be Montague's PPO because his background made him a perfect [[fall guy]]. Nadia is interviewed again and reveals that she lied about recognising Longcross's e-fit. She is an engineer who built the explosive devices. She had remembered the details Budd told her about his children, which led to the attack on their school. The ''kompromat'' is leaked, apparently by Sampson, and it is implied that the Prime Minister and the Director-General of MI5 will resign. In the final scenes, Budd starts [[occupational health]] treatment, and he and Vicky travel with their children to visit his parents.

BBC journalists including [[Andrew Marr]], [[John Pienaar]], [[John Humphrys]] and [[Laura Kuenssberg]] appear as themselves.

==Reception==
Viewing figures for the series were high, with an average of 10.4 million people (peaking at 11 million) watching the final episode live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Waterson |first=Jim |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/sep/24/bodyguard-audience-peaks-with-104m-viewers-series-finale-bbc |title=Bodyguard audience peaks with 10.4m viewers for series finale |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |location=[[London]] |date=2018-09-24 |access-date=2018-10-02 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As significant numbers of viewers watched the show on catchup service iPlayer after transmission, the series sparked a debate on how the media should handle [[Spoiler (media)|spoiler]]s. ''[[Radio Times]]'' revealed the fate of Montague in a cover story during the series' original transmission run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Heritage |first=Stuart |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |location=[[London]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/sep/12/the-real-bodyguard-conspiracy-when-is-it-ok-to-reveal-spoilers |title=The real Bodyguard conspiracy: when is it OK to reveal spoilers? |date=2018-09-12 |access-date=2018-10-02 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series received positive reviews. On the review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the series has an average score of 8.8/10 based on 18 reviews.

There was criticism that the character Nadia was Islamophobic, due to the replacement of one stereotype of Muslim women (that they are oppressed by Muslim men) with another (that Muslims, men and women, are terrorists).&lt;ref name="ds1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/bodyguard/news/a866932/bodyguard-episode-6-controversy-islamophobia/ |access-date=2018-09-24 |title=Bodyguard heavily criticised for Islamophobia as viewers slam episode 6's Nadia twist |last=Lee |first=Jess |website=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=[[Hearst Communications]] |date=2018-09-24 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180924173633/http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/bodyguard/news/a866932/bodyguard-episode-6-controversy-islamophobia/|archive-date=2018-09-24 |df=dmy-all |quote=Although the twist attempted to subvert one particular stereotype about Muslim women, this problematic development served to reinforce other negative and extremely harmful stereotypes about Muslims.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Puerto Rican Nationalist Party}}

'''Cadets of the Republic''', known in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as '''Cadetes de la República''', was a quasi-military youth organization of the [[Puerto Rican Nationalist Party]] in the twentieth century. The organization was also referred to as the '''Liberation Army of Puerto Rico''' ''(Ejército Libertador de Puerto Rico)'' 

The Cadets of the Republic were founded and organized in the 1930s by Dr. [[Pedro Albizu Campos]], the president of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. Some members of the cadets participated in the [[Puerto Rican Nationalist Party Revolts of the 1950s|Puerto Rican Nationalist Party revolts of the 1950s]] against [[United States]] colonial rule.

The following is a brief history of the Cadets of the Republic, covering the period from 1930 to 1950.&lt;!--- Note: All the references can be found within the article ---&gt;

==Origins==
In the 1920s, there was a non-political student organization in the [[University of Puerto Rico]] called ''Patriotas Jóvenes'' (''Young Patriots''). By the 1930s many students, who were also members of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party and influenced by the teachings of Albizu Campos, joined the Patriotas Jóvenes organization. The ''Patriotas'' adopted the Nationalist Party's independence ideals and dismissed any student who would not swear allegiance to them. The organization was later renamed ''Cadetes de la República'' (Cadets of the Republic) and Joaquín Rodríguez, a Nationalist, was placed in charge.&lt;ref name="FBI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pr-secretfiles.net/binders/SJ-100-3_23_023_157.pdf|title=pr-secretfiles.net|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101090251/http://www.pr-secretfiles.net/binders/SJ-100-3_23_023_157.pdf|archivedate=1 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizational structure==
[[File:Pedro Albizu Campos raising his hat to a crowd, 1936.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Don Pedro Albizu Campos, 1936]]
By order of Albizu Campos, the cadets adopted a military structure with companies in various towns of the island. Albizu Campos, who had served as a [[Lieutenant]] in the [[United States Army]] during [[Puerto Ricans in World War I|World War I]], believed that the cadets had to adopt a system of strict military training if they were to become a powerful Puerto Rican Army. He believed that a well-trained and disciplined army would eventually be able to fight against the United States imperialism which ruled the island. Albizu Campos often referred to the cadets as the ''Ejército Libertador de Puerto Rico'' (The Liberation Army of Puerto Rico).&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NIS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writetofight.wordpress.com/the-nationalist-insurrection-of-1950/|title=The Nationalist Insurrection of 1950 (2011)|work=Write To Fight|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cadet headquarters were located at ''Número 11 de la Calle del Cristo'' in [[Old San Juan]]. The cadet organization was divided into companies throughout the cities and towns of [[Arecibo, Puerto Rico|Arecibo]], [[Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico|Cabo Rojo]], [[Cayey]], [[Dorado, Puerto Rico|Dorado]], [[Guayama]], [[Humacao]], [[Isabela, Puerto Rico|Isabela]], [[Jayuya]], [[Lares]], [[Mayagüez, Puerto Rico|Mayagüez]], [[Naranjito, Puerto Rico|Naranjito]], [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]], [[Sabana Grande, Puerto Rico|Sabana Grande]], [[San Germán, Puerto Rico|San Germán]], [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], [[San Lorenzo, Puerto Rico|San Lorenzo]], [[San Sebastián, Puerto Rico|San Sebastián]] and [[Utuado]]. San Juan was the only city with more than one cadet corps. Besides the main city, San Juan also had a cadets corps in the sectors of [[Hato Rey]], [[Santurce, Puerto Rico|Santurce]] and [[Río Piedras]].&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NIS"/&gt;

==Chain of Command==
The cadets had a [[command hierarchy|chain of command]] which had to be followed. Regular cadets were First and Second Class '''Soldiers''', and larger companies had '''Sergeants'''. The Commanding Officer of each company held the rank of '''Captain''', who reported to a Sub-Commander with the rank of '''Colonel''', who in turn reported to the '''Commander-in-Chief'''. The Commander-in-Chief reported only to the '''President''' of the Nationalist Party.&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NIS"/&gt;

==Numbers==
Cadet recruitment was the responsibility of each Captain. United States government reports showed that by the mid-1930s, cadet membership was growing exponentially - particularly amongst younger members, aged 18 through 25.&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NIS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pr-secretfiles.net"&gt;[http://www.pr-secretfiles.net/binders/HQ-105-11898_2_02_27.pdf FBI Files: Pedro Albizu Campos; File Number 105-11898, Section 2, p.43] Retrieved Jan. 8, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The female members of the Nationalist Party had their own organization, known as the ''Hijas de la Libertad'' (Daughters of Freedom). It is estimated by the [[FBI]] and ''El Mundo'' newspaper that at its peak, around 1935-36, cadet membership reached over 10,000.&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NIS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pr-secretfiles.net"/&gt;

==Oath==
[[File:Flag of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party.svg|115px|thumb|left|Puerto Rican Nationalist Party Flag]][[File:Cross-Potent-Heraldry.svg|thumb|110px|right|The Cross potent]]

Cadet candidates were taught the ideals of the party by the Nationalist Municipal Board President. They were then required to take an oath of allegiance to the PRNP. During the verbal oath ceremony the cadets had to place a hand on the Nationalist flag, which was itself symbolic.

The flag showed a white Calatrava Cross, also known as the [[Cross potent]] on the middle of a black background. The Cross of Calatrava was first used by the [[Crusaders]] of Calatrava and later by the [[French people|French]] revolutionists. The black background symbolized the mourning of the Puerto Rican Nation in colonial captivity.&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt;

Cadets swore to be faithful to the Nationalist Party and to participate in public activities organized by the party. Contrary to what is believed, they did not swear to overthrow the Government of the United States. They did, however, swear to fight for Puerto Rico's independence from colonial rule by whatever means necessary.&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt;

==Uniforms==
All of the Cadets were required to wear uniforms during the celebration of Nationalist activities. These uniforms consisted of white trousers, black shirt, black tie, and an overseas cap. The shirt and cap were both emblazoned with a Cross of Calatrava patch. Cadet officers wore an additional black seam on the trousers and a white headquarters cap. Cadets who could not afford to buy the entire uniform wore white trousers with a black shirt.&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NIS"/&gt;

==Drills and tactics==
The cadets practiced military drills and were taught military tactics. They used wooden rifles during their training. During the participation of public activities, each cadet company had two standard bearers. One carried the [[Flags of Puerto Rico|Flag of Puerto Rico]], the other carried the Nationalist Party Flag.&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt;

==Historical events (1930 -1950)==

===Río Piedras massacre===
[[File:Elias Beauchamp (1936).jpg|thumb|185px|left|Elias Beauchamp gives a cadet military salute, moments before being [[Summary execution|summarily executed]] at police headquarters]]
On October 24, 1935, local police officers confronted and opened fire on supporters of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party at the [[University of Puerto Rico]]. Four Nationalist Party members were killed and one police officer was wounded during the shooting known as the [[Río Piedras massacre]].&lt;ref name="Bosque Pérez"&gt;{{cite book|last= Bosque Pérez|first=Ramón|title=Puerto Rico Under Colonial Rule|publisher=SUNY Press|year=2006|pages=71|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=te1cUiXUweYC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=R%C3%ADo+Piedras+massacre&amp;as_brr=3|accessdate=2009-03-17 | isbn=978-0-7914-6417-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isolina Rondón]] watched from her front door on Calle Brumbaugh, near the University of Puerto Rico, as the police shot into the car carrying the four Nationalists. Rondón testified how she saw the police officers shooting at the victims and how she heard one police officer screaming "Do not to let them escape alive".&lt;ref name="IR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peacehost.net/WhiteStar/Voices/eng-rondon.html|title=Isolina Rondón|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, her testimony was ignored and there were no charges raised against the officers. They were instead given a promotion.&lt;ref name="PRET3"&gt;"Puerto Rico Por Encima de Todo: Vida y Obra de Antonio R. Barcelo, 1868-1938"; by: Dr. Delma S. Arrigoitia; '''Page 306'''; Publisher: Ediciones Puerto (January 2008); {{ISBN|978-1-934461-69-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the massacre the top-ranking police chief on the island was appointed by the [[United States|American]] government—a former [[U.S. Army]] [[Colonel]] named Elisha Francis Riggs. Since the entire Insular Police took their orders from Riggs the Nationalists considered him responsible for the massacre.

On February 23, 1936, Riggs was assassinated by Nationalists [[Hiram Rosado]] and [[Elías Beauchamp]], both members of the Cadets, on his way home after attending Mass in San Juan's Cathedral. Rosado and Beauchamp were arrested and executed without a trial at the police headquarters in San Juan but not before Beauchamp posed solemnly for a news photographer with a stiff military salute.&lt;ref name="Bosque Pérez" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Puerto Ricans: a documentary history.

===Arrest of Albizu Campos===
On April 3, 1936, a Federal Grand Jury submitted accusations against Pedro Albizu Campos, [[Juan Antonio Corretjer]], Luis F. Velázquez, [[Clemente Soto Vélez]] and the following members of the cadets: Erasmo Velázquez, Julio H. Velázquez, Rafael Ortiz Pacheco, Juan Gallardo Santiago, and Pablo Rosado Ortiz.

These men all were charged with [[sedition]] and other violations of [[Title 18 of the United States Code]].&lt;ref name="FBI2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pr-secretfiles.net/Timeline_view.html?cat=8&amp;item=59|title=pr-secretfiles.net|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924080758/http://www.pr-secretfiles.net/Timeline_view.html?cat=8&amp;item=59#|archive-date=2015-09-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Title 18 of the [[United States Code]] is the criminal and [[penal code]] of the [[federal government of the United States]].

By way of evidence, the prosecution referred to the creation, organization and the activities of the cadets, which the government made reference to as the "Liberting Army of Puerto Rico." The government prosecutors alleged that the military tactics which the cadets were being taught, was for the sole purpose of overthrowing the Government of the U.S.&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NIS"/&gt; A jury of seven Puerto Ricans and five Americans voted 7-to-5 not guilty. However, Judge [[Robert A. Cooper]] called for a new jury, this time composed of ten Americans and two Puerto Ricans, and a guilty verdict was achieved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prdream.com/patria/timelines/timeline1-1930.html ''The Imprisionement of Men and Women Fighting Colonialism'', 1930 - 1940] Retrieved December 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

March 21, 1937, a [[Palm Sunday]], the cadets were  scheduled to participate in a peaceful march in the city of [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]]. The march had been organized by the Nationalist Party to commemorate the ending of slavery in Puerto Rico by the governing Spanish National Assembly in 1873. The march was also protesting the imprisonment, by the U.S. government, of Nationalist leader Albizu Campos on the alleged sedition charges.&lt;ref name="latino"&gt;{{cite book|title=Latino Americans and political participation |publisher=ABC-CLIO|year= 2004|isbn=1-85109-523-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CKf8_WF7ppEC&amp;pg=PA105&amp;dq=ponce+massacre&amp;as_brr=3#PPA105,M1|accessdate=2009-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Latino Americans and Political Participation: A Reference Handbook".

[[Raimundo Díaz Pacheco]], who by then was the Comandante (Commander) of the Cadets of the Republic, and his brother Faustino were present when the peaceful march turned into a bloody police slaughter, which became known as the [[Ponce Massacre]].

Several days before the scheduled Palm Sunday march, [[Casimiro Berenguer]], a military instructor of the cadets, and other organizers received legal permits for the peaceful protest from [[José Tormos Diego]], the mayor of Ponce. However, upon learning of the planned protest, the colonial [[governor of Puerto Rico]] at the time, [[Blanton Winship|General Blanton Winship]] (who had been appointed by [[US president]] [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]) demanded the immediate withdrawal of the permits.&lt;ref name="Hunter" /&gt;

Without notice to the organizers, or any opportunity to appeal or any time to arrange an alternate venue, the permits were abruptly withdrawn just before the protest was scheduled to begin.&lt;ref name="Hunter"&gt;"The Puerto Rican diaspora"; publisher=[[Temple University Press]]; year=2005; pages=76; {{ISBN|1-59213-413-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Viva la Republica.jpg|right|thumb|400px|"Viva la Republica, Abajo los Asesinos" message which cadet Bolívar Márquez Telechea wrote with his blood before he died]]
Tomas López de Victoria, who at the time was the Captain of the Ponce branch of the cadets, ordered the band to play [[La Borinqueña]], Puerto Rico's national anthem. As the anthem was being played, the demonstrators—which included the Cadets and the women's branch of the Nationalist Party known as the ''Hijas de la Libertad'' (Daughters of Freedom)—began to march.&lt;ref name="LMM"&gt;"Luis Muñoz Marín: Puerto Rico's democratic revolution"; publisher=Editorial UPR; year=2204; pages=152; {{ISBN|0-8477-0158-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Empowered by the [[United States citizen|American]] police chief, and encouraged by the governor, the police fired for over fifteen minutes from four different positions. They fired with impunity on cadets and bystanders alike—killing men, women and children.&lt;ref name="Hunter" /&gt;

The flag-bearer of the cadets was shot and killed during the massacre. A young girl by the name of Carmen Fernández proceeded to take the flag but was shot and gravely injured. A young cadet by the name of Bolívar Márquez Telechea, despite being mortally wounded, dragged himself to a wall and wrote with his blood the following message before he succumbed to his wounds:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.prdream.com/wordpress/2003/03/the-ponce-massacre-why-is-it-important-to-remember/# |title=The Ponce Massacre, why is it important to remember? |access-date=2012-06-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614060534/http://www.prdream.com/wordpress/2003/03/the-ponce-massacre-why-is-it-important-to-remember/# |archive-date=2013-06-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nineteen people were killed and about 235 were wounded.&lt;ref name="Hunter" /&gt; The dead included seventeen men, one woman, and a seven-year-old girl. Some of the dead were demonstrators while others were simply passers-by. Many were chased by the police and shot or clubbed at the entrance of their houses as they tried to escape. Others were taken from their hiding places and killed. Leopold Tormes, a member of the Puerto Rico legislature, told reporters how a policeman murdered a nationalist with his bare hands. Dr. [[Jose N. Gándara]], one of the physicians who assisted the wounded, testified that wounded people running away were shot and that many were again wounded by the clubs and bare fists of the police. No arms were found in the hands of the civilians and cadets who were wounded nor on the dead. About 150 of the demonstrators were arrested immediately afterward; they were later released on bail.&lt;ref name="Hunter" /&gt;

===The Judge Cooper incident===
On June 7, 1937, Albizu Campos and the other leaders of the Nationalist Party were transferred to the Federal Penitentiary in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] by order of federal Judge Robert A. Cooper. The next day Díaz Pacheco participated in an assassination attempt on Judge Cooper in believing that Cooper rigged the jury made up of ten United States ciotizens and two Puerto Ricans,&lt;ref&gt;''Albizu Campos: Puerto Rican Revolutionary;'' Federico Ribes Tovar (1971); p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; and for sentencing the Nationalist leadership to prison terms.&lt;ref name="FBI2"/&gt; Díaz Pacheco, together with nine other Cadets and Nationalists, was arrested and accused of attempting against the life of Judge Cooper. On October 22, 1937, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order Number 7731 designating Martín Travieso, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, to perform and discharge the duties of Judge of the District Court of the United States for Puerto Rico in the trial against the Nationalists thereby permitting Judge Cooper to serve as a Government witness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=61245#axzz1vntr1bu2|title=Franklin D.

===Attempt against Governor Winship===
On July 25, 1938, Governor Winship chose the city of Ponce for a military parade in commemoration of the 1898 invasion of Puerto Rico by the United States. He wanted to prove that his "Law and Order" policy had been a successful one against the Nationalists, a decision that would prove to be disastrous.&lt;ref name="SP"/&gt;

During the parade, a hail of bullets was fired towards the grandstand in an attempt to assassinate Governor Winship. Winship escaped unscathed in what was the first time in Puerto Rican history that an attempt was made on a governor's life.&lt;ref name="SP"/&gt;

The dead included Nationalist Cadet Ángel Esteban Antongiorgi and National Guard Colonel Luis Irizarry while thirty-six other people were wounded. Despite the Nationalist Party's disavowal of any participation in the attack, several Nationalists were arrested and nine were accused of "murder and conspiracy to incite violence." &lt;ref name="SP"/&gt; Among the nine Nationalists accused was the Captain of the Ponce branch of the Cadets Tomás López de Victoria and fellow Cadets Elifaz Escobar, Santiago González Castro, Juan Pietri and Prudencio Segarra. They served eight years in the State Penitentiary of Puerto Rico. However, since the government's actions against them were unjust, Governor Rexford Guy Tugwell had no other choice but to pardon them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prdream.com/patria/timelines/timeline1-1930.html|title=The Imprisonment of Men and Women Fighting Colonialism 1930-1940|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published-inline|date=January 2014}}

Winship proceeded to declare war against the Nationalists, in response to which [[Jaime Benítez]] Rexach, a student at the [[University of Chicago]] at the time, wrote a letter to President Roosevelt which in part read as follows: "The point I am to make is that the Governor (Winship) himself through his military approach to things has helped keep Puerto Rico in an unnecessary state of turmoil. He seems to think that the political problem of Puerto Rico limits itself to a fight between himself and the Nationalists, that no holds are barred in that fight and that everybody else should keep out. As a matter of fact he has played the Nationalist game and they have played his.&lt;ref name="SP"&gt;"Strategy as Politics"; by: Jorge Rodríguez Beruff; Publisher: Universidad de Puerto Rico; pg. 178; {{ISBN|0-8477-0160-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Puerto Rico's Gag Law (Law 53)===
After Díaz Pacheco was released from prison he resumed his role as Commander of the Cadets. Unbeknown to him, his brother Faustino had abandoned the Nationalist Party in 1939 and had turned into an informant for the [[FBI]].&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt;
 
Albizu Campos returned to Puerto Rico in 1947 after having been incarcerated for ten years in Atlanta, Georgia and Díaz Pacheco and the Cadets were among those who greeted him. Albizu Campos named Díaz Pacheco Treasurer General of the party. Thus, Díaz Pacheco now served as both, Comandante (Commander) of the Cadets of the Republic and as Treasurer General of the party. As Treasurer General he was responsible for all the funds received by the municipal treasurers of the party.&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt;
 
On May 21, 1948, the Puerto Rican legislature, which was presided over by Luis Muñoz Marín approved Law 53. The law which is also known as ''Ley de la Mordaza'' or ''Puerto Rico's Gag Law'' was signed into law on June 10, 1948 by the U.S.-appointed governor [[Jesús T. Piñero]]. The law's main objective was to suppress the independence movement in Puerto Rico.  The law made it a crime to own or display a [[Flags of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican flag]], to sing a patriotic tune, to speak or write of independence, or meet with anyone, or hold any assembly, with regard to the political status of Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;"Jaime Benítez y la autonomía universitaria"; by: Mary Frances Gallart;  Publisher: CreateSpace; {{ISBN|1-4611-3699-7}};

===Nationalist Party Revolts of the 1950s===
Membership in the cadets began to dwindle as a result of the persecution which the cadets were subject to by local and federal agencies of United States. In the 1950s the official hierarchy of the Cadets of the Republic was the following:&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt;

[[File:Troops in Jayuya.gif|right|thumb|410px|{{pad|9.0em}}The National Guard occupy Jayuya]]Various incidents between the government and the party led to a call for an armed revolt by the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party against United States Government rule over Puerto Rico.

The revolts specifically repudiated the so-called Free Associated State (''Estado Libre Asociado'') designation of Puerto Rico—a designation widely recognized as a colonial farce.

The revolts, known as the [[Puerto Rican Nationalist Party Revolts of the 1950s]], began on October 30, 1950 upon the orders of Nationalist leader Albizu Campos, with uprisings in various towns, among them [[Arecibo]], [[Mayagüez]], [[Naranjito, Puerto Rico|Naranjito]], [[Peñuelas]] and [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]]. The most notable uprisings occurred in [[Utuado Uprising|Utuado]], [[Jayuya Uprising|Jayuya]], and [[San Juan Nationalist revolt|San Juan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.llmc.com/TitleLLMC.asp?ColID=3&amp;Cat=136&amp;TID=7037&amp;TName=Ponce%20Massacre,%20Com.%20of%20Inquiry,%201937 Law Library Microform Consortium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214194610/http://www.llmc.com/TitleLLMC.asp?ColID=3&amp;Cat=136&amp;TID=7037&amp;TName=Ponce%20Massacre%2C%20Com.%20of%20Inquiry%2C%201937 |date=2010-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was estimated by the FBI that 40 percent of the Cadet membership participated in the revolts. They participated in every incident of the revolts. However, among the more notable incidents in which the Cadets were involved were the following:&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt;

::'''Arecibo Incident'''&lt;br/&gt;López de Victoria led the revolt, which is referred to by the FBI as the "Arecibo Incident", in the town of Arecibo. He ordered Ismael Díaz Matos, a Nationalist leader in [[Arecibo]], to attack the local police station. Díaz Matos did as commanded and killed four policemen before fleeing. Fellow Nationalist Hipólito Miranda Díaz was killed while he covered the escape of his comrades. Díaz Matos and his group were captured and arrested by the National Guard. Among the Cadets arrested who were charged with organizing the attack were López de Victoria and Juan Jaca Hernández, Cadet Captain of Arecibo.&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NIS"/&gt;

::'''Mayagüez Incident'''&lt;br/&gt;The Nationalist group of Mayagüez was one of the largest. The Cadet Captain was José Antonio Vélez Lugo. It was divided into several units, each assigned to attack different targets. One of the groups attacked the town's police station, resulting in the death of three policemen and three bystanders.

::The unit then joined the members of the other units in Barrio La Quinta. Upon the arrival of the local police they headed into the mountains and avoided further casualties through adroit use of guerrilla tactics. Vélez Lugo was eventually captured and charged with attempted murder.

::One of the members of these units was Nationalist cadet [[Irvin Flores|Irvin Flores Rodríguez]], who on March 1, 1954, together with [[Lolita Lebrón]], [[Rafael Cancel Miranda]] and Andrés Figueroa Cordero, attacked the members of the US House of Representatives in Washington, DC with automatic pistols.&lt;ref name="NIS"/&gt;

::'''Ponce Incident'''&lt;br/&gt;Police Corporal Aurelio Miranda approached a car carrying some Nationalists. Fellow officers suggested they arrest them right there. Officer Miranda was shot dead in a firefight between the Nationalists and the police. Antonio Alicea, José Miguel Alicea, Francisco Campos (Albizu Campos' nephew), Osvaldo Pérez Martínez and Ramón Pedrosa Rivera, Captain of the Ponce Cadets, were arrested and accused of the murder of Corporal Miranda during the revolt. Raúl de Jesús was accused of violation of the Insular Firearms Law.&lt;ref name="FBI2"/&gt;

The group was reduced to twelve men and retreated to the house of Damián Torres—which was promptly strafed by 50-caliber machinegun fire, from four American [[P-47 Thunderbolt]] planes. Three men died from this aerial gunfire.

::The National Guard arrived later that day and ordered the nine men who survived the attack to surrender. Once the nationalists surrendered they were forced to march down Dr. Cueto Street to the local town plaza where their shoes, belts and personal belongings were removed.

::The group then was taken behind the police station and where, without a trial, they were machinedgunned.  Five of the nationalists died. They were nationalist leader and Captain of the Utuado branch of the cadets Heriberto Castro Ríos, Julio Colón Feliciano, Agustín Quiñones Mercado, Antonio Ramos and Antonio González.

::González, who was 17 years old, pleaded for water and instead was bayoneted to death.&lt;ref name="HU"/&gt; The four survivors were seriously wounded in what became known as ''La Masacre de Utuado'' (The Utuado Massacre).&lt;ref name="C"&gt;[http://sembrandopatria.com/2009/01/01/fallecio-don-gilberto-martinez-sobreviviente-de-la-masacre-de-utuado/ Claridad] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508055137/http://sembrandopatria.com/2009/01/01/fallecio-don-gilberto-martinez-sobreviviente-de-la-masacre-de-utuado/ |date=May 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

::In addition to the three men killed by the P-47 Thunderbolt planes, these four aircraft inflicted massive damage to the houses, buildings and roads of both Jayuya and Utuado.

::Each plane was heavily armed with eight [[M2 Browning machine gun|.50-caliber machine guns]], four on each wing. They also carried [[rockets]] that were five inches wide, and [[bomb]] loads of 2,500 pounds. This entire arsenal was unleashed on the towns of Jayuya and Utuado.

::'''[[Jayuya Uprising]]'''

===San Juan Nationalist revolt===
Díaz Pacheco was in charge of the group involved in the San Juan revolt. The objective of the revolt was to assassinate the Governor of Puerto Rico Luis Muñoz Marín, at his residence ''[[La Fortaleza]].'' &lt;ref name="Page 2"/&gt;

Early in the morning of October 30, fellow cadets Domingo Hiraldo Resto, Carlos Hiraldo Resto, Gregorio Hernández and Manuel Torres Medina met at the house of Díaz Pacheco, in the San Juan sector of Martín Peña. At 11 A.M., they boarded a green [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] and headed towards Old San Juan. The men arrived at ''La Fortaleza'' at noon and stopped their car 25 feet from their objective's main entrance&lt;ref name="Page 4"&gt;"El ataque Nacionalista a La Fortaleza"; by Pedro Aponte Vázquez; Page 4; Publisher: Publicaciones RENÉ; {{ISBN|978-1-931702-01-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; They got out of the car with a [[submachine gun]] and pistols in hand and immediately began firing at the mansion. Díaz Pacheco headed towards the mansion while the others took cover close to their car, and fired pistols from their positions. 
[[File:La Fortaleza attack-1950.jpg|290px|thumb|left|The bodies of Carlos Hiraldo Resto and Manuel Torres Medina lie on the ground, after their attack on ''La Fortaleza'']]

The ''Fortaleza'' guards and police, who ''knew'' of the planned attack thanks to a double agent name E. Rivera Orellana, were already in defensive positions and returned fire.&lt;ref name="Page7"/&gt;
 
Díaz Pacheco aimed his sub machine gun fire at the second floor of the mansion, where the executive offices of Governor Muñoz Marín were located. During the firefight Díaz Pacheco wounded two police officers, Isidoro Ramos and Vicente Otero Díaz, before he was killed by ''Fortaleza'' guard Carmelo Dávila.&lt;ref name="Page 4"/&gt;

Meanwhile, the police continued to fire upon the other Nationalists. Domingo Hiraldo Resto was seriously wounded, but despite his wounds he dragged himself towards the mansions entrance. He was able to reach the mansions main door and once there he was motionless and appeared to be dead. He suddenly turned and sat on the steps and with his hands held up pleaded for mercy, his pleas however, were answered with a fusillade of gunfire.&lt;ref name="Page7"&gt;"El ataque Nacionalista a La Fortaleza"; by Pedro Aponte Vázquez; Page 7; Publisher: Publicaciones RENÉ; {{ISBN|978-1-931702-01-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

Hernández, who was also severely wounded, continued firing at the police from under his car. A police officer and a detective from ''La Fortaleza'' with submachine guns approached the car and fired upon Hernández, Carlos Hiraldo Resto and Torres Medina. Both Carlos Hiraldo Resto and Torres Medina were killed, and their motionless bodies were by the right side of the car.

Hernández was believed to be dead, however he wasn't, and he was taken to the local hospital along with the wounded police officers where they were operated on for their respective wounds. The battle lasted 15 minutes and at the end of the battle there were five nationalist casualties (four dead and one wounded) plus three wounded police officers.&lt;ref name="Page7"/&gt;

E. Rivera Orellana, a sixth "Nationalist" who later turned out to be an undercover agent, was arrested near ''La Fortaleza'' and later released.&lt;ref name="Page7"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
The revolt of October 1950 failed because of the overwhelming force used by the [[U.S. military]], the [[U.S. National Guard]], the FBI, the [[CIA]], and the Puerto Rican Insular Police—all of whom were aligned against the Nationalists. This force was responsible for the machinegunning of Nationalists and Cadets alike and the aerial bombing of the towns of Jayuya and Utuado.&lt;ref name="DPB"&gt;"Discrimination for Political Beliefs and Associations"; Helfeld, D. M.; Revista del Colegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico; volumen = 25&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Constitution]] places final control of territorial affairs with Congress. However, the responses to the uprising appeared to emanate independently from the federal and local authorities. President [[Harry S. Truman]] distanced himself entirely from the uprisings and acted as though they had never occurred. In addition, the news of the U.S. military response, which killed dozens of Puerto Ricans and wounded hundreds more, was prevented from spreading outside of Puerto Rico. Instead, it was called an "incident between Puerto Ricans."&lt;ref name="NY Latino Journal"/&gt;

Hundreds of Cadets and Nationalists were arrested by mid-November 1950 and the party was never the same. The Cadets of the Republic ceased to function as an officially organized military organ of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party.&lt;ref name="DPB"/&gt;

According to the ''FBI Files - Puerto Rico Nationalist Party (SJ 100-3, Vol. 23),'' Aguedo Ramos Medina (who once served as Commander of Instruction for the Cadets) and Faustino Díaz Pacheco (the brother of Cadet Commander Ramón Díaz Pacheco) both "cooperated" with the FBI and provided them vital and ongoing [[intelligence]] about the Cadets for a period of several years.&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt;

Both of these men—Ramos Medina and Díaz Pacheco—provided the FBI with copious and detailed information about the membership, structure, funding, and activities of the Cadets of the Republic. In providing the FBI this information, both men betrayed the Nationalist movement. Díaz Pacheco, of course, betrayed his own brother.&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt;

Among the factors which have affected the independence movement in Puerto Rico have been the [[Cointelpro]] program and the ''Carpetas program''. The Cointelpro program was a project conducted by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) aimed at surveying, infiltrating, discrediting, and disrupting domestic [[political organizations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politic365.com/2012/10/08/puerto-rico-votes-on-status-a-primer-on-independence/|title=Puerto Rico Votes on Status: A Primer on Independence|author=jeanvidal|date=8 October 2012|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006164839/http://politic365.com/2012/10/08/puerto-rico-votes-on-status-a-primer-on-independence/#|archive-date=2014-10-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Carpetas program was a massive collection of information gathered by the island's police on so-called "political subversives". The police had in its possession thousands of extensive carpetas (files) concerning individuals of all social groups and ages. Approximately 75,000 persons were listed as under political police surveillance. The massive surveillance apparatus was aimed primarily against Puerto Rico's independence movement. Thus, many independence supporters moved to the Popular Democratic Party as a means to an end to stop statehood.&lt;ref&gt;"Las carpetas: persecución política y derechos civiles en Puerto Rico (Spanish Edition) "; Author: Ramón Bosque-Pérez; Publisher: Centro para la Investigación y Promoción de los Derechos Civiles; 1era edición (December 29, 1997); {{ISBN|0-9650043-0-9}}; {{ISBN|978-0-9650043-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Revolution sidebar}}
The '''Carnation Revolution''' ({{lang-pt|Revolução dos Cravos}}), also referred to as the '''25th of April''' ({{lang-pt|25 de Abril|links=no}}), was initially a [[military coup]] in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]] on 25 April 1974 which overthrew the [[authoritarian]] regime of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/25/newsid_4754000/4754581.stm | title = 1974: Rebels seize control of Portugal | publisher = [[BBC]] | work = On This Day, 25 April | date=25 April 1974 | accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revolution started as a military coup organised by the [[Armed Forces Movement]] ({{lang-pt|Movimento das Forças Armadas|links=no}}, MFA) composed of military officers who opposed the regime, but it was soon coupled with an unanticipated and popular campaign of [[civil resistance]]. The MFA would lead to the fall of the Estado Novo and the [[Decolonisation of Africa|withdrawal of Portugal]] from its [[Portuguese Empire|African colonies]].

The name Carnation Revolution comes from the fact that almost no shots were fired and that when the population took to the streets to celebrate the end of the dictatorship and war in the colonies, [[Dianthus caryophyllus|carnations]] were put into the muzzles of rifles and on the uniforms of the army men by [[Celeste Caeiro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://algarvedailynews.com/news/11517-why-april-25th-is-a-holiday-the-carnation-revolution-and-the-events-of-1974|title=Why April 25th is a holiday - the Carnation Revolution and the events of 1974|last=Association|first=Peter Booker, Algarve History|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Portugal, April 25th is a [[Public holidays in Portugal|national holiday]] known as Freedom Day ({{lang-pt|Dia da Liberdade|links=no}}) in commemoration of the revolution.

==Overview==
Portugal had been run by an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] [[dictatorship]] (the ''[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]'', or New State), which was considered by many{{Who?|date=November 2018}} to be [[fascism|fascist]], for over four decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Paul H.|title=Latin Fascist Elites: The Mussolini, Franco, and Salazar Regimes|date=2002|publisher=Praeger|isbn=0-275-97880-X|pages=133|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nUmrfBRNW8kC&amp;pg=PA133&amp;lpg=PA133&amp;dq=estado+novo+and+fascism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0Ph9Jk9yOb&amp;sig=Unj8kS2YICNcrXlRnZu3y1O874k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwirwYyHgZDQAhUEVRQKHcUtATYQ6AEIPDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=estado%20novo%20and%20fascism&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The events of the revolution effectively [[Portuguese transition to democracy|changed the government]] into a [[democracy]], and produced enormous social, economic, territorial, demographic, and political changes in the country. These changes evolved during and after a two-year transitional period known as ''[[Processo Revolucionário Em Curso]]'' (PREC), or ''On-Going Revolutionary Process'', characterised by social turmoil and power disputes between left- and right-wing political forces.{{citation needed|date = October 2015}}

Despite repeated appeals by the revolutionaries, broadcast over the radio, asking the population to stay home, thousands of Portuguese descended on the streets, mixing with the military [[Insurgency|insurgents]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = https://books.google.com/?id=TqRn1lAypsgC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=Lisbon+crowds+portugal+1974+april | first = David | last = Birmingham | title = A Concise History of Portugal | page = 184 | quote = Almost immediately, massive crowds filled the streets, supporting the junior officers, crowds that put carnations in the soldiers' guns, thus helping legitimize and make irreversible the "carnation revolution". | publisher = JHU Press | isbn = 978-0-8018-5158-2 | year = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The military-led coup returned democracy to Portugal, ending the unpopular [[Portuguese Colonial War|Colonial War]] in which thousands of Portuguese citizens had been [[Conscription|conscripted]] into military service, and replacing the ''Estado Novo'' regime and its [[secret police]] which repressed elemental [[civil liberties]] and [[political freedom]]s. It started as a professional class&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www1.ci.uc.pt/cd25a/wikka.php?wakka=movicapi Cronologia: Movimento dos capitães], Centro de Documentação 25 de Abril, [[University of Coimbra]]&lt;/ref&gt; protest of [[Portuguese Armed Forces]] [[Captain (armed forces)|captains]] against a decree law: the ''Dec Lei nº 353/73'' of 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www1.ci.uc.pt/cd25a/wikka.php?wakka=otesacar Arquivo Electrónico: Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho], Centro de Documentação 25 de Abril, [[University of Coimbra]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of Portuguese low-ranking officers organised within the [[Armed Forces Movement]] (''MFA – Movimento das Forças Armadas''), including some who had been fighting the pro-independence [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] in the [[Portuguese empire]]'s territories in Africa,&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Amaro Bernardo, [http://ultramar.terraweb.biz/06livros_manuelamarobernardo_02GuerraPazFuzilamentosdosGuerreiros.htm Guerra, Paz e Fuzilamentos dos Guerrilheiros]&lt;/ref&gt; and rose to overthrow the "Estado Novo" regime that had ruled Portugal since the 1930s. Portugal's new regime pledged itself to end the colonial wars and began negotiations with the [[African independence movements]]. By the end of 1974, Portuguese troops had been withdrawn from [[Portuguese Guinea]] and the latter had become a [[Member states of the United Nations|UN member state]]. This was followed by the independence of [[Colonial Cape Verde|Cape Verde]], [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]], [[Colonial São Tomé and Príncipe|São Tomé and Príncipe]] and [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] in 1975. The Carnation Revolution also led to Portugal's withdrawal from [[Portuguese Timor|East Timor]] in [[Southeast Asia|south-east Asia]]. These events prompted a [[mass exodus]] of Portuguese citizens from Portugal's African territories (mostly from [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] and [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]]), creating over a million Portuguese [[Refugee|refugees]] — the ''[[retornados]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displayStory.cfm?story_id=12079340 Flight from Angola], [[The Economist]] (16 August 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913229-1,00.html Dismantling the Portuguese Empire], [[Time Magazine]] (Monday, 7 July 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the regime's political police, [[PIDE]], killed four people before surrendering, the revolution was unusual in that the revolutionaries did not use direct violence to achieve their goals. Holding red [[Dianthus caryophyllus|carnations]] (''cravos'' in Portuguese), many people joined revolutionary soldiers on the streets of [[Lisbon]], in apparent joy and audible euphoria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,908577,00.html?promoid=googlep Cheers, Carnations and Problems], [[Time Magazine]] (May. 13, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; Red is a symbolic colour for [[socialism]] and [[communism]], which were the main ideological tendencies of many anti-"Estado Novo" insurgents.&lt;ref name ="infiltrated communists"&gt;Stewart Lloyd-Jones, [[ISCTE]] (Lisbon), [http://www1.ci.uc.pt/cd25a/media/Textos/portugal-since-1974.pdf Portugal's history since 1974], "The Portuguese Communist Party (PCP–Partido Comunista Português), which had courted and infiltrated the MFA from the very first days of the revolution, decided that the time was now right for it to seize the initiative. Much of the radical fervour that was unleashed following Spínola's coup attempt was encouraged by the PCP as part of their own agenda to infiltrate the MFA and steer the revolution in their direction.", Centro de Documentação 25 de Abril, [[University of Coimbra]]&lt;/ref&gt; It was the end of the ''Estado Novo'', the longest-lived authoritarian regime in [[Western Europe]], and the final dissolution of the [[Portuguese Empire]]. In the aftermath of the revolution a [[Portuguese Constitution|new constitution]] was drafted, [[censorship]] was formally prohibited, [[Freedom of speech|free speech]] was declared, [[political prisoner]]s were released and the Portuguese overseas territories in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] were immediately granted independence. [[East Timor]] was also offered independence, shortly before being [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|invaded by Indonesia]].

==Context==
At the beginning of the 1970s, a near-half century of authoritarian rule continued to weigh heavily on Portugal. After the [[28 May 1926 coup d'état]], Portugal implemented an authoritarian regime of [[Social Catholicism|social-Catholic]] and [[Integralism|Integralist]] inspiration. In 1933, the regime was recast and renamed ''[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]'' ("New State"), and [[António de Oliveira Salazar]] was named Prime Minister until 1968, when he suffered a stroke following a domestic accident. He was replaced in September by [[Marcello Caetano]], who served until he was deposed on 25 April 1974.

Under the ''Estado Novo'', Portugal's undemocratic government was initially tolerated by its [[NATO]] partners due to its [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] stance. This attitude changed dramatically during the mid-1960s, under pressure of public opinion and leftwing movements rising in Europe.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} There were [[Sham election|formal elections]] but they were rarely contested—with the opposition using the limited [[Political freedom|political freedoms]] allowed during the brief election period to openly [[protest]] against the regime, withdrawing their candidates before the election so as not to provide the regime with [[Legitimacy (political)|political legitimacy]]. In 1958, General [[Humberto Delgado]]—a former member of the regime—stood against the regime's presidential candidate, [[Américo Tomás]], and refused to allow his name to be withdrawn from the competition.

Tomás won the election, but only amidst claims of widespread [[electoral fraud]]; it was widely thought that Delgado would have won had the election been honest.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Immediately after this election, Salazar's government abandoned the practice of popularly electing the president, with that task being given thereafter to the regime-loyal [[National Assembly of Portugal|National Assembly]]. During Caetano's time in office, his attempts at minor political reform were obstructed by the important Salazarist elements within the regime (known as the Bunker). The hardliners had critical support from Tomás, who was not willing to give Caetano nearly as free a hand as Salazar had.

The ''Estado Novo''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s political police—the [[PIDE]] (''Polícia Internacional e de Defesa do Estado''; International Police of State Defense), later to become DGS (''Direcção-Geral de Segurança''), and originally the PVDE (''Polícia de Vigilância e Defesa do Estado'')—[[Persecution|persecuted]] opponents of the regime, who were often tortured, imprisoned or killed.



The [[international community]] was not favourable to the Portuguese regime. The [[Cold War]] was near its peak, and both [[Western Bloc|Western]] and [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern-bloc]] states were supporting the [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] in the [[Portuguese colonies]], attempting to bring these under, respectively, American and Soviet influence (see [[Portuguese Colonial War]]). The overseas policy of the Portuguese Government and the desire of many colonial residents to remain under Portuguese rule eventually led to an abrupt [[decolonisation]] after the Carnation Revolution and the fall of the regime in April 1974.  For the Portuguese ruling regime, the overseas empire was a matter of [[national interest]].

In the view of many Portuguese, a colonial empire was necessary for continued [[national power]] and influence.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Despite objections in world forums such as the [[United Nations]], Portugal had long maintained that its African colonies were an integral part of Portugal, and felt obliged to militarily defend them against [[Communist]]-inspired armed groups, particularly after [[India]]'s [[Annexation of Goa|annexation]] of Portuguese [[Exclave|exclaves]] [[Goa]], [[Daman District, India|Daman]] and [[Diu district|Diu]] ([[Portuguese India]]), in 1961 (see [[Indian Invasion of Goa]]).{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===Independence movements in Portugal's African possessions===

Independence movements started operations in the African colonies of [[Portuguese Mozambique]], [[Portuguese Congo]], [[Portuguese Angola]], and [[Portuguese Guinea]]. The various conflicts forced the Salazar and Caetano regimes to spend more of the country's [[National budget|budget]] on colonial administration and [[Military expenditure|military expenditures]], and Portugal soon found itself increasingly [[International isolation|isolated]] from the rest of the world. Throughout the war period Portugal faced increasing dissent, [[Arms embargo|arms embargoes]] and other punitive [[International sanctions|sanctions]] imposed by most of the international community.&lt;ref name="Adrian Hastings"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1310333/Adrian-Hastings.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Adrian Hastings | date=26 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Portuguese society the war was becoming even more unpopular due to its length and financial costs, the worsening of [[diplomatic relations]] with other United Nations member states, and the role it had always played as a factor of perpetuation of the Estado Novo regime. It was this escalation that would lead directly to the mutiny of members of the FAP in the Carnation Revolution in 1974 – an event that would lead to the independence of the former [[Portuguese colonisation of Africa|Portuguese colonies in Africa]]. Atrocities, such as [[Wiriyamu Massacre|that at Wiriyamu in Mozambique]], undermined the war's popularity and the government's diplomatic position – although some details of the Wiriyamu case remain disputed.&lt;ref name="Adrian Hastings"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gomes, Carlos de Matos, Afonso, Aniceto.

After Caetano succeeded to the presidency, colonial war became a major cause of dissent and a focus for anti-government forces in Portuguese society.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Many left-wing students and anti-war activists were forced to leave the country so they could escape conscription, imprisonment and [[torture]] by government forces. However, between 1945 and 1974, there were also three generations of militants of the radical right at the Portuguese universities and schools, guided by a [[revolutionary nationalism]] partly influenced by the political sub-culture of European [[neo-fascism]]. The core of these radical students' struggle lay in an uncompromising defense of the [[Portuguese Empire]] in the days of the [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] regime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scielo.oces.mctes.pt/pdf/aso/n188/n188a04.pdf A direita radical na Universidade de Coimbra (1945–1974)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303234238/http://www.scielo.oces.mctes.pt/pdf/aso/n188/n188a04.pdf |date=3 March 2009 }}, MARCHI, Riccardo.

===Economic conditions===
{{refimprove|section|date=April 2017}}
The [[economy of Portugal]] and its colonies on the eve of the Carnation Revolution was growing well above the European average.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Average family [[purchasing power]] was rising together with new consumption patterns and trends and this was promoting both investment in new [[capital equipment]] and consumption expenditure for durable and nondurable [[consumer goods]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The Estado Novo regime's economic policy encouraged the formation of large business [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]]. The regime maintained a policy of [[corporatism]] that resulted in the placement of a big part of the Portuguese economy in the hands of a number of strong conglomerates, including those founded by the families of [[António Champalimaud]] ([[Banco Totta &amp; Açores]], [[Banco Pinto &amp; Sotto Mayor]], [[Secil]], [[Cimpor]]), [[José Manuel de Mello]] (CUF – [[Companhia União Fabril]]), [[Américo Amorim]] ([[Corticeira Amorim]]) and the dos Santos family ([[Jerónimo Martins]]).

Those Portuguese conglomerates had a business model with similarities to South Korean [[chaebol]]s and Japanese [[keiretsu]]s and [[zaibatsu]]s.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The [[Companhia União Fabril]] (CUF) was one of the largest and most diversified Portuguese conglomerates with its [[core business]]es (cement, chemicals, [[Petrochemical|petrochemicals]], [[Agrochemical|agrochemicals]], textiles, beer, beverages, [[metallurgy]], [[naval engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[insurance]], banking, paper, tourism, mining, etc.) and corporate headquarters located in [[Continental Portugal|mainland Portugal]], but also with branches, plants and several developing business projects all around the [[Portuguese Empire]], especially in the Portuguese territories of [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]], [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]].

Other medium-sized family companies specialised in textiles (for instance those located in the city of [[Covilhã]] and the northwest), ceramics, porcelain, glass and crystal (like those of [[Alcobaça, Portugal|Alcobaça]], [[Caldas da Rainha]] and [[Marinha Grande]]), engineered wood (like [[SONAE]] near [[Porto]]), canned fish (like those of [[Algarve]] and the northwest), fishing, food and beverages (alcoholic beverages, from liqueurs like [[Licor Beirão]] and [[Ginjinha]], to beer like [[Sagres (beer)|Sagres]], were produced across the entire country, but [[Port Wine]] was one of its most reputed and exported alcoholic beverages), tourism (well established in [[Estoril]]/[[Cascais]]/[[Sintra]] and growing as an international attraction in the [[Algarve]] since the 1960s) and in agriculture (like the ones scattered around the [[Alentejo]] – known as the [[breadbasket]] of Portugal) completed the panorama of the national economy by the early 1970s. In addition, [[rural area]]s' populations were committed to [[agrarianism]] that was of great importance for a majority of the total population, with many families living exclusively from agriculture or complementing their salaries with farming, husbandry and forestry yields.

[[File:Portuguese colonial war map1.PNG|thumb|350px|Portuguese colonies in Africa during the ''[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]'' regime: [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]] were by far the two largest of those territories.]]
Besides that, the colonies were also displaying impressive economic growth and development rates from the 1920s onwards.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Even during the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961–1974), a [[Counter-insurgency|counterinsurgency]] war against independentist [[guerrilla]] and [[terrorism]], [[Portuguese Congo]], [[Portuguese Angola]] and [[Portuguese Mozambique]] (colonies at the time) had continuous economic growth rates and several sectors of its local economies were booming. They were internationally notable centres of production of oil, coffee, cotton, cashew, coconut, timber, minerals (like diamonds), metals (like iron and aluminium), banana, citrus, tea, sisal, beer (Cuca and Laurentina were successful beer brands produced locally), cement, fish and other sea products, beef and textiles. Tourism was also a fast developing activity in Portuguese Africa both by the growing development of and demand for beach resorts and wildlife reserves.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

[[Labor union|Labour unions]] were not allowed and a [[minimum wage]] policy was not enforced. However, from the context of Portugal's expanding economy leading to better living conditions for the Portuguese population in the 1960s, the outbreak of the colonial wars in Africa set off significant social changes, among them the rapid incorporation of more and more women into the labour market. Marcelo Caetano moved on to foster economic growth and some social improvements,{{Vague|date=November 2018}} such as the awarding of a monthly [[pension]] to rural workers who had never had the chance to pay [[social security]]. The objectives of Caetano's pension reform were threefold: enhancing equity, reducing [[Fiscal imbalance|fiscal and actuarial imbalance]], and achieving more [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]] for the economy as a whole; for example, by establishing contributions which distorted labour markets less, or by allowing the savings generated by pension funds to increase the investments in the economy.

After Salazar's stroke in 1968, [[Marcelo Caetano]] had taken over the office of [[Prime Minister of Portugal|Prime Minister]]. His main slogan was "evolution in continuity", suggesting that there would be a reform of the Salazarist system. His so-called "[[Political Spring]]" (also called Marcelist Spring – ''Primavera Marcelista'') included greater political tolerance and [[freedom of the press]] and was regarded as an opportunity by the opposition to gain [[Concession (politics)|concessions]] from the regime. In 1969, Portugal got a slight taste of democracy and Caetano allowed the establishment of the first democratic labour union movement since the 1920s. Nevertheless, after the elections of 1969 and 1973 it was clear that the past practices of [[political repression]] would continue against [[Communism|communists]], [[Anti-colonialism|anti-colonialists]] and other opponents to the regime. In 1973, Caetano was pressured by the ultra-right faction inside the Salazarist elite to abandon his reform experiment.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

[[Image:Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho Campaign Poster 1976.jpg|thumb|right|[[Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho]] rose to mainstream popularity in the mid-1970s due to his leading role in the Carnation Revolution. However, he performed poorly in elections for the Presidency of the country.]]
By the early 1970s, the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] continued to rage, requiring a steadily increasing budget. The [[Portuguese Armed Forces|Portuguese military]] was overstretched and there was no political solution or end in sight. While the [[Casualty (person)|human losses]] were relatively small, the war as whole had already entered its second decade. The Portuguese regime faced criticism from the international community and was becoming increasingly isolated.

The colonial war had a profound impact on Portugal—thousands of young men avoided [[conscription]] by [[Illegal emigration|emigrating illegally]], mainly to France and the United States. In addition, the other goals of the revolutionary [[Armed Forces Movement]] (MFA) were not in the strict interest of the people of Portugal or its colonies, since the movement was initiated not only as an attempt to liberate Portugal from the authoritarian [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime, but as an attempt of rebellion against the new military laws that were to [[Coming into force|come into force]] the next year.&lt;ref name="infopedia.pt"&gt;{{pt icon}} Movimento das Forças Armadas (MFA).

The Revolution was also a way to work against Laws that would reduce military costs and would reformulate the whole Portuguese Military Branch (Decree Law: ''Decretos-Leis n.os 353, de 13 de Julho de 1973, e 409, de 20 de Agosto''). Younger military academy graduates resented a programme introduced by Marcelo Caetano whereby militia officers who completed a brief training programme and had served in the colonies' defensive campaigns could be commissioned at the same rank as military academy graduates. As the war in the colonies was becoming increasingly unpopular in Portugal, with the people becoming weary of war and balking at its ever-rising expense, military insurgents took advantage of the war's unpopularity and gained momentum.

Many ethnic [[Portuguese Africans|Portuguese of the African colonies]] were also increasingly willing to accept independence if their economic status could be preserved.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Following the coup d'état in Portugal in 1974, the new left-wing [[Movimento das Forças Armadas|revolutionary government of Portugal]] began to negotiate with the African pro-independence guerrillas. The new government in [[Lisbon]] was disinclined to prop up Portugal's chaotic and now very expensive empire. All the Portuguese territories in Africa were rapidly granted their independence.

==Events==
{{Main article|Timeline of the Carnation Revolution}}
[[File:Povo mfa.jpg|thumb|right|Portuguese Government poster from the mid-1970s by artist [[João Abel Manta]] (it reads: MFA, People – People, MFA) The character on the left is wearing a military cap, fatigues and boots while holding a [[garden fork]] and the one on the right is wearing a farmer's cap and a military shirt and holding a rifle]]
In February 1974, [[Marcello Caetano|Caetano]] decided to remove General [[António de Spínola]] as [[President of Portugal|President]] in the face of increasing dissent by Spinola over the promotion of military officers and the direction of Portuguese colonial policy. This occurred shortly after the publication of Spínolas's book ''Portugal and the Future'', which expressed his political and military views on the [[Portuguese Colonial War]]. At this point, several left-wing military officers who opposed the war formed a group of conspirators, the ''[[Movement of the Armed Forces|Movimento das Forças Armadas]]'' (MFA, "Armed Forces Movement"), to overthrow the government by a [[Coup d'état|military coup]]. The MFA was headed by major [[Vítor Alves]], major [[Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho]], and captain Vasco Lourenço, later joined by [[Salgueiro Maia]]. The movement was significantly aided by other officers in the Portuguese army who supported Spinola and democratic civil and military reform. Some observers speculate that [[Francisco da Costa Gomes|Francisco de Costa Gomes]] actually led the revolution.

There were two secret signals of the military coup: first the airing (at 10:55 pm) of the song "''[[E Depois do Adeus]]''" by [[Paulo de Carvalho]] (Portugal's entry in the 6 April [[1974 Eurovision Song Contest]]) through the ''Emissores Associados de Lisboa'', which alerted the rebel captains and soldiers to begin the coup. The second signal came on 25 April 1974 at 12:20 am, with [[Rádio Renascença]] broadcasting "''[[Grândola, Vila Morena]]''", a song by [[Zeca Afonso]], an influential [[Folk music|folk musician]] and political singer banned from Portuguese radio at the time. The MFA gave these signals to take over strategic points of power in the country and "announced" that the revolution had started and nothing would stop it except "the possibility of the regime's repression".

Six hours later, the Caetano regime relented. Despite repeated appeals from the "captains of April" (of the MFA) on the radio warning the population to stay safe inside their homes, thousands of Portuguese took to the streets, mingling with the military insurgents and supporting them. One of the central points of those gathering was the Lisbon flower market, then richly stocked with carnations which were in season. Some military insurgents put these flowers in the [[Gun barrel|barrels]] of their guns, an image which was shown on television around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://adst.org/2015/04/the-carnation-revolution-a-peaceful-coup-in-portugal/|title=The Carnation Revolution – A Peaceful Coup in Portugal - Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training|date=2015-04-13|work=Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training|access-date=2018-10-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the origin of the name of this "Carnation Revolution". Although there were no [[Mass demonstration|mass demonstrations]] by the general population prior to the coup, spontaneous civilian involvement turned the military coup into an event with unexpected popular participation.

Caetano found refuge in the main Lisbon military police station at the Largo do Carmo. This building was surrounded by the MFA, which pressured him to cede power to General Spínola. Both Prime Minister Caetano and President [[Américo Tomás]] fled to Brazil. Caetano spent the rest of his life in Brazil, while Tomás returned to Portugal a few years later.

The revolution was closely watched from neighbouring Spain, where the government and opposition were planning for the [[Head of state succession|succession]] of Spanish dictator [[Francisco Franco]], who died a year and a half later, in 1975.

==Aftermath==
{{Main|Portuguese transition to democracy}}[[File:25 Abril 1983 Porto by Henrique Matos 01.jpg|thumbnail|A demonstration in [[Porto]] on 25 April 1983]]
After the military coup in Lisbon on 25 April 1974, power was taken by a military junta, the [[National Salvation Junta]], and Portugal went through a turbulent period, commonly called the ''Continuing Revolutionary Process'' (Portuguese: [[Processo Revolucionário Em Curso]], or PREC).

Initially there was confrontation, at times open, at other times hidden, between the conservative forces around Spinola and the radicals of the MFA. Spinola was forced to appoint key MFA figures to senior security positions. As a result of these reforms, right-wing military figures attempted a [[counter-coup]] to halt the progress of democratisation which failed, resulting in Spinola's removal from office. Thereafter, confrontations within the MFA between leftist forces, often close to the [[Communist Party of Portugal|Communist party]], and more moderate groups, often close to the Socialists, eventually led to the group's splintering and dissolution.

This stage of the PREC lasted until 25 November 1975, the day of [[Coup of 25 November 1975|a pro-communist coup followed by a successful counter-coup by pro-democracy moderates]], marked by constant friction between liberal-democratic forces and leftist/communist political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www1.ci.uc.pt/cd25a/wikka.php?wakka=eacalvao ENTREVISTA COM ALPOIM CALVÃO], Centro de Documentação 25 de Abril, [[University of Coimbra]]&lt;/ref&gt; After a year, the [[Portuguese Constituent Assembly election, 1975|first free election]] was carried out on 25 April 1975 in order to write a new Constitution to replace the Constitution of 1933 which prevailed during the ''Estado Novo'' period. In 1976, another [[Portuguese legislative election, 1976|election]] was held and the first Constitutional government, led by the centre-left socialist [[Mário Soares]], assumed office.

===Decolonisation===
{{Main article|Retornados|Angolan Civil War|Mozambican Civil War|Indonesian invasion of East Timor|Lusophobia|Guinea-Bissau War of Independence}}
Before April 1974, the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] in Africa was consuming as much as 40% of the Portuguese budget and there was no end in sight. At a military level, a part of [[Guinea-Bissau]] was [[De facto state|de facto independent]] since 1973, but the capital [[Bissau]] and the major towns were still under Portuguese control. In [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]], independence movements were only active in a few remote countryside areas from which the Portuguese Army had retreated, and the economies of these two territories were booming.

A direct consequence of the military coup at Lisbon was the sudden withdrawal of Portuguese administrative and military personnel from Portugal's overseas colonies. Hundreds of thousands of other [[Portuguese Africans|Portuguese citizens in Africa]] returned to Portugal. These people—workers, small business people, and farmers—often had deep roots in the former colonies and came to be known as the ''[[retornados]]''.

[[Angola]] would later enter into a decades-long [[Angolan Civil War|civil war]] which involved nations like the [[Soviet Union]], [[Cuba]], [[South Africa]], and the [[United States]]. Millions of Angolans would die in the aftermath of independence due to the violence of the armed conflict, [[malnutrition]] and disease. After a short period of stability, [[Mozambique]] would also later enter into a devastating [[Mozambican Civil War|civil war]] that left it as one of the poorest nations in the world. Since the 1990s, its situation has improved after the war ended and [[multi-party elections]] were held.

[[East Timor]] was [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|invaded by Indonesia]] and would later be [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|occupied]] until 1999. There were an estimated 102,800 conflict-related deaths in the period 1974–99 (approximately 18,600 killings and 84,200 'excess' deaths from hunger and illness), the majority of which occurred during the subsequent Indonesian occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Benetech Human Rights Data Analysis Group |title=The Profile of Human Rights Violations in Timor-Leste, 1974–1999 |work=A Report to the Commission on Reception, Truth and Reconciliation of Timor-Leste |publisher=Human Rights Data Analysis Group (HRDAG) |date=9 February 2006 |url=http://www.hrdag.org/resources/timor_chapter_graphs/timor_chapter_page_02.shtml |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65eZ8hHJe?url=http://www.hrdag.org/resources/timor_chapter_graphs/timor_chapter_page_02.shtml |archivedate=22 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a long period of one-party rule, [[Guinea-Bissau]] endured a brief [[Guinea-Bissau Civil War|civil war]] and a difficult transition to civilian rule in 1998.

[[Cape Verde]] and [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], on the other hand, were spared civil war during the decolonisation period, and by the early 1990s, they have both established [[Multi-party system|multi-party political systems]].

[[Macau]] remained a Portuguese colony until 1999 when [[China]] [[Transfer of sovereignty over Macau|took control]] by [[Joint Declaration on the Question of Macau|agreement]] and enacted a "[[one country, two systems]]" policy similar to [[Hong Kong]]'s.

===Economic issues===
{{Main article|Economic history of Portugal}}
The Portuguese economy had changed significantly by 1973 prior to the revolution, compared with its position in 1961. Total output (GDP at factor cost) had grown by 120 percent in real terms. The pre-revolutionary period was characterised by robust [[Annual growth rate|annual growth rates]] for [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] (6.9 percent), [[industrial production]] (9 percent), [[Consumption (economics)|private consumption]] (6.5 percent), and [[gross fixed capital formation]] (7.8 percent). The revolutionary period itself was characterised by a slowly growing economy whose only impetus was the entering of the European Economic Zone. It never reached pre-revolutionary period growth rates. On the other hand, despite the progress in the 1960s and early 1970s, Portugal at the time of the Revolution was still an [[underdeveloped country]] with poor [[infrastructure]] and inefficient agriculture as well as the worst health and education indicators in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = https://books.google.com/?id=NG1oRqfF7agC&amp;pg=PA1389&amp;dq=Portugal+recession+oil | first = Peter | last = Haggett | title = Encyclopedia of World Geography | publisher = Marshall Cavendish | isbn = 978-0-7614-7289-6 | date = July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, researchers agree that pre-revolution Portugal increasingly accomplished notable social and economic achievements.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | language = pt | url = http://www.sedes.pt/conteudo.aspx?args=1,2 | title = Fundação da SEDES — As primeiras motivações | quote = Nos anos 60 e até 1973 teve lugar, provavelmente, o mais rápido período de crescimento económico da nossa História, traduzido na industrialização, na expansão do turismo, no comércio com a EFTA, no desenvolvimento dos sectores financeiros, investimento estrangeiro e grandes projectos de infra-estruturas. Em consequência, os indicadores de rendimentos e consumo acompanham essa evolução, reforçados ainda pelas remessas de emigrantes. | publisher = [[SEDES]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After a long period of economic divergence before 1914, the Portuguese economy recovered slightly until 1950, entering thereafter on a path of strong economic growth leading to some convergence with Western Europe, of which Portugal was and remained until the 1980s the poorest country. Portuguese economic growth in the period 1960–73 under the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|''Estado Novo'']] regime created an opportunity for real integration with the developed economies of Western Europe, even in spite of the expensive war against guerilla groups in effort in African territories. Through emigration, trade, tourism and foreign investment, individuals and firms changed their patterns of production and consumption, bringing about a structural transformation. Simultaneously, the increasing complexity of a growing economy raised new technical and organisational challenges, stimulating the formation of modern professional and management teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.dge.ubi.pt/investigar/TDiscussao/2001/TD052001.pdf | first = Tiago Neves | last = Sequeira | publisher = [[University of Beira Interior]] | title = Crescrimento Económico no Pós-Guerra: os casos de Espanha, Portugal e Irlanda | format = [[PDF]] | language = pt }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = https://ideas.repec.org/p/ave/wpaper/382006.html | first = Joaquim da Costa | last = Leite | publisher = [[Aveiro University]] | title = Instituições, Gestão e Crescimento Económico: Portugal, 1950–73 | language = pt }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 November 1972, a [[sovereign wealth fund]] (Fundo do Ultramar – The Overseas Fund) was enacted through the Decree Law ''Decreto-Lei n.º 448/ /72'' and the Ministry of Defense ordinance ''Portaria 696/72'', in order to finance the counterinsurgency effort in the Portuguese colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [https://www.dn.pt/inicio/opiniao/interior.aspx?content_id=1722768&amp;seccao=Convidados&amp;page=1 A verdade sobre o Fundo do Ultramar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511164133/http://www.dn.pt/inicio/opiniao/interior.aspx?content_id=1722768&amp;seccao=Convidados&amp;page=1 |date=11 May 2013 }}, [[Diário de Notícias]] (29 November 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; While the counterinsurgency war was won in Angola, it was less than satisfactorily contained in Mozambique and dangerously stalemated in Portuguese Guinea from the Portuguese point of view, so the Portuguese Government had decided to create sustainability policies in order to allow continuous sources of financing for the war effort in the long run. In addition, new Decree Laws (Decree Law: ''Decretos-Leis n.os 353, de 13 de Julho de 1973, e 409, de 20 de Agosto'') were enforced in order to cut down military expenses and increase the number of officers by incorporating [[militia]] and military academy officers in the Army branches as equals.&lt;ref name="infopedia.pt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://maltez.info/respublica/portugalpolitico/grupospoliticos/movimento_das_forcas_armadas.htm Movimento das Forças Armadas (1974–1975)], Projecto CRiPE- Centro de Estudos em Relações Internacionais, Ciência Política e Estratégia. © José Adelino Maltez.

In the agricultural sector, the collective farms, set up in [[Alentejo]] after the 1974–75 [[Eminent domain|expropriations]] due to the leftist military coup of 25 April 1974, proved incapable of modernising, and their efficiency declined. According to government estimates, about {{convert|900000|ha|acre|abbr=off}} of agricultural land were occupied between April 1974 and December 1975 in the name of [[land reform]]; about 32% of the occupations were ruled illegal. In January 1976, the government pledged to restore the illegally occupied land to its owners, and in 1977, it promulgated the Land Reform Review Law. Restoration of illegally occupied land began in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = http://countrystudies.us/portugal/63.htm | quote = In the mid-1980s, agricultural productivity was half that of the levels in Greece and Spain and a quarter of the EC average.

The decollectivization of agriculture, which began in modest form in the late 1970s and accelerated in the late 1980s, promised to increase the efficiency of human and land resources in the south during the 1990s. | publisher = U.S. Library of Congress | work = Country Studies | title = Portugal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Europe/Portugal-AGRICULTURE.html | title = Portugal Agriculture | work = The Encyclopedia of the Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, at the initiation of Salazar's more outward-looking economic policy due to the influence of a new wave of [[Technocracy|technocrats]] with background in economics (some of whom trained abroad, including in [[Economic liberalism|liberal capitalist]] graduate schools from the USA and the UK), Portugal's per capita GDP was only 38 percent of the EC-12 average; by the end of the Salazar period, in 1968, it had risen to 48 percent; and in 1973, on the eve of the revolution, Portugal's per capita GDP had reached 56.4 percent of the EC-12 average (though the figure is necessarily dampened by the 40% of the budget that went to African wars). In 1975, the year of maximum revolutionary turmoil, Portugal's per capita GDP declined to 52.3 percent of the EC-12 average. Due to the new revolutionary economic policies, oil shocks, recession in Europe, the return of hundreds of thousands of overseas Portuguese from the former colonies, Portugal underwent an economic crisis starting in 1974–75.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Problems of Democratic Transition and Consolidation | first = Juan José | last = Linz | url = https://books.google.com/?id=TqRn1lAypsgC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=Financial+crisis+1974+Portugal#PPA129,M1 | publisher = JHU Press | isbn = 978-0-8018-5158-2 | year = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Convergence of real GDP growth toward the EC average occurred as a result of Portugal's economic resurgence since 1985. In 1991 Portugal's GDP per capita climbed to 54.9 percent of the EC average, exceeding by a fraction the level attained during the worst revolutionary period.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://countrystudies.us/portugal/64.htm | title = Economic Growth and Change | publisher = [[U.S. Library of Congress]] | work = Country Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the revolution Portugal's economy would collapse and it took 16 years for the GDP as percentage of the EC-12 average to climb to 54.9 percent again. Portugal had been one of the founding members of EFTA ([[European Free Trade Association]]) in 1960. After the fall of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime and the loss of its colonies in 1974 and 1975, Portugal left EFTA and entered into the [[European Economic Community]] in 1986.

A report published in January 2011 by the ''Diário de Notícias'', a right-wing Portuguese tabloid newspaper, demonstrated that in the period between the Carnation Revolution in 1974 and 2010, the democratic [[Government of Portugal|Portuguese Republic government]]s have encouraged over expenditure and investment bubbles through unclear public-private partnerships. This has funded numerous ineffective and unnecessary external consultancy and advising committees and firms, allowed considerable [[slippage (finance)|slippage]] in state-managed [[public works]], inflated top management and head officers' bonuses and wages, causing a persistent and lasting recruitment policy that has boosted the number of redundant public servants. The economy has also been damaged by risky [[credit (finance)|credit]], [[public debt]] creation and mismanaged European [[structural and cohesion funds]] for almost four decades. Apparently, the Prime Minister [[José Socrates|Sócrates]]'s cabinet was not able to forecast or prevent any of this when symptoms first appeared in 2005, and later was incapable of doing anything to ameliorate the situation when the country was on the verge of bankruptcy in 2011 and required financial assistance from the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [https://dn.sapo.pt/inicio/tv/interior.aspx?content_id=1750097&amp;seccao=Media Grande investigação DN Conheça o verdadeiro peso do Estado] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108021723/http://dn.sapo.pt/inicio/tv/interior.aspx?content_id=1750097&amp;seccao=Media |date=8 January 2011 }}, [[Diário de Notícias]] (7 January 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom of religion===
The [[Constitution of Portugal|constitution of 1976]] guarantees all [[Religion|religions]] the right to practice their faith. Non-Roman Catholic groups came to be recognised as legal entities with the [[Freedom of assembly|right to assemble]]. Portuguese who were both not Roman Catholics and were conscientious objectors had the right to apply for alternative military service. The Roman Catholic Church, however, still sought to place barriers in the way of missionary activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politicsandreligionjournal.com/images/pdf_files/srpski/godina4_broj1/7%20-%20sergej%20flere.pdf|title=REGISTRATION OF RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES IN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new authorities abolished the ban on activities of [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]. In December 1976, the religious organisation of Jehovah's Witnesses was registered. In 1978, in Lisbon, they organised their first international convention in Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;Almeida, Manuel de Jesus. Watchtower, 7 January 1999. – P.23-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freedom Day==
Freedom Day on 25 April is a [[Public holidays in Portugal|national holiday in Portugal]], with both state-sponsored and spontaneous commemorations praising the elemental [[civil liberties]] and [[political freedom]]s achieved after the revolution. It commemorates both the 25 April 1974 military coup, and the first [[free elections]] on that date in 1975.

==Monuments==
[[File:Ponte25Abril1.jpg|thumb|250px|Originally named after [[António de Oliveira Salazar]], in honour of the President of the Council of Ministers, the [[25 de Abril Bridge]] (''Ponte 25 de Abril'') is an icon of [[Lisbon]].]]

The construction of the 25 de Abril Bridge began on 5 November 1962. Forty-five months later, the bridge was inaugurated on 6 August 1966 as the Salazar Bridge, after the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|''Estado Novo'']] regime's leader [[António de Oliveira Salazar]]. Soon after the Carnation Revolution in 1974, the bridge was renamed the [[25 de Abril Bridge]], the day the revolution had occurred. A symbol of those times was captured on film, with citizens removing the big brass "Salazar" sign from one of the main pillars of the bridge and painting a provisional "25 de Abril" in its place.

In Portugal, many avenues, squares, and streets are named after the day of the revolution, ''vinte e cinco de Abril''.

The Portuguese Mint chose the 40th anniversary of the Carnation Revolution for its 2014 [[2 euro commemorative coin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/about-european-union/euro/euro-coins-and-notes/euro-coins/commemorative-and-collector-euro-coins_en?field_nal_country_tid_selective=22088&amp;field_cc_issue_page_target_id_selective=All|title=Commemorative coins|website=European Commission - European Commission|language=en|access-date=2017-07-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019151358/https://ec.europa.eu/info/about-european-union/euro/euro-coins-and-notes/euro-coins/commemorative-and-collector-euro-coins_en?field_nal_country_tid_selective=22088&amp;field_cc_issue_page_target_id_selective=All|archive-date=19 October 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluations of the revolution's outcomes==
After an early period of turmoil, Portugal emerged as a democratic country. It took several years to create a strong democratic government due to the radical leftist{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} inclination of some of the leading revolutionaries. During this period Portugal divested itself of almost all of its former colonies underwent severe economic turmoil as the ''Estado Novo'' had such rigid control over the Portuguese economy that it took a long time time to [[nationalization|nationalise]] and [[reprivatization|reprivatise]] businesses. For the Portuguese and their former colonies, this was a very difficult period, but many{{Who|date=May 2011}} felt that the short-term effects of the Carnation Revolution were well worth the trouble when [[civil rights]] and [[Political freedom|political freedoms]] were achieved. The Portuguese celebrate Freedom Day on 25 April every year, and the day is a national holiday in Portugal.

Most moderate or non-aligned political sectors of the population consider that the core objectives of the revolution were achieved, although there are differing views held by supporters of the former regime and also by supporters of the revolution who felt it did not go far enough.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The international community censured the ''Estado Novo'' regime for refusing to grant [[independence]] to its colonies in Africa. Is leaders [[António de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]] and [[Marcelo Caetano|Caetano]] were accused of being deaf to the so-called "[[Wind of Change (speech)|winds of change]]". After the Carnation Revolution in 1974 and the fall of the incumbent Portuguese authoritarian regime, almost all the Portuguese-ruled territories outside Europe became independent. Several left-wing historians have described the stubbornness of the regime as a lack of sensibility to the "winds of change". For the regime, those overseas possessions were a matter of [[national interest]].

[[File:PC Chick-Fil-A 2012-08-01.jpg|thumb|"Chick-Fil-A Appreciation Day" held on August 1, 2012 in [[Port Charlotte, Florida]].]]
The '''Chick-fil-A same-sex marriage controversy''' was focused on the American [[fast food restaurant]] [[Chick-fil-A]] following a series of public comments made in June 2012 by [[chief operating officer]] [[Dan T. Cathy]] opposing [[same-sex marriage]].

This followed reports that Chick-fil-A's charitable endeavor, the [[S. Truett Cathy]]-operated [[WinShape Foundation]], had donated millions of dollars to political organizations seen by [[LGBT rights in the United States|LGBT activists]] as hostile to [[LGBT rights opposition|LGBT rights]]. Activists called for protests and [[boycott]]s, while supporters of the restaurant chain and opponents of same-sex marriage ate there in support of the restaurant. National political figures both for and against the actions spoke out and some business partners severed ties with the chain.
 
The outcome of the controversy was mixed, as Chick-fil-A's sales rose 12 percent, to $4.6 billion, in the period immediately following the controversy. However, Chick-fil-A released a statement in July 2012 stating, "Going forward, our intent is to leave the policy debate over same-sex marriage to the government and political arena."&lt;ref name="robinson2012"&gt;Robinson, Steve (July 31, 2012).

===Group contributions from opponents of LGBT causes===
In January 2011, the media reported that the American fast food restaurant chain [[Chick-fil-A]] was co-sponsoring a marriage conference along with the Pennsylvania Family Institute (PFI), an organization that had filed an [[Amicus curiae|amicus brief]] against striking down [[Proposition 8]] in California (see ''[[Perry v.

Tax filings for 2012 showed that Chick-fil-A created a new foundation, the Chick-fil-A Foundation, to provide grants to outside groups. It funded only one previously funded group, the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. Other filings for WinShape Foundation showed no funding for groups opposed to LGBT causes.&lt;ref name="QNotes March 2014"/&gt;

===Statements by Dan Cathy===
On June 16, 2012, while on the syndicated radio talk show, ''The [[Ken Coleman]] Show'', Chick-fil-A president and [[chief operating officer]] (COO) [[Dan T. Cathy|Dan Cathy]] stated: {{quote|I think we are inviting God's judgment on our nation when we shake our fist at Him and say, "We know better than you as to what constitutes a marriage".

The following month, on July 2, ''[[Biblical Recorder]]'' published an interview with Dan Cathy, who was asked about opposition to his company's "support of the traditional family." He replied: "Well, guilty as charged."&lt;ref name="Biblical Recorder"&gt;{{cite news|last=Blume|first=K.

{{quote|"We are very much supportive of the family&amp;nbsp;— the biblical definition of the family unit. We are a family-owned business, a family-led business, and we are married to our first wives. We give God thanks for that. ...&amp;nbsp;We want to do anything we possibly can to strengthen families. We are very much committed to that," Cathy emphasized. "We intend to stay the course," he said. "We know that it might not be popular with everyone, but thank the Lord, we live in a country where we can share our values and operate on biblical principles."&lt;ref name="Biblical Recorder"/&gt;}}

The day after the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] struck down Section 3 of the [[Defense of Marriage Act]], Cathy tweeted, "Sad day for our nation; founding fathers would be ashamed of our gen. to abandon wisdom of the ages re: cornerstone of strong societies." The tweet was subsequently deleted, but was archived by ''[[Topsy (analytics)|Topsy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2013/06/26/deleted-tweet-from-chick-fil-a-head-calls-same-sex-ruling-sad-day|title=Deleted Tweet From Chick-fil-A Head Calls Gay Ruling 'Sad Day'|work=[[Wall Street Journal]]|date=June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-06-28/the-blurry-line-between-chick-fil-a-and-chatty-cathy|title=The Blurry Line Between Chick-fil-A and Chatty Cathy|work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|date=June 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, Cathy said he regretted drawing his company into the controversy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abpnews.com/culture/social-issues/item/28503-chick-fil-a-ceo-seeks-to-get-beyond-gay-marriage-debate "Chick-fil-A CEO seeks to get beyond gay marriage debate"], abpnews.com; accessed August 11, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He told the ''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' he has been working with Shane Windmeyer of [[Campus Pride]] since 2012. The article noted that WinShape and the Chick-fil-A Foundation had "dramatically" cut donations to groups opposed by same-sex marriage supporters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myajc.com/news/business/cathy-seeks-to-put-gay-marriage-flap-behind-chick-/nfCHj "Cathy Seeks to Put Gay Marriage Flap Behind Chick-fil-A"], myajc.com; accessed September 10, 2014 (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Policy changes===
In September 2012, [[The Civil Rights Agenda]] (TCRA) announced that Chick-fil-A has "ceased donating to organizations that promote discrimination, specifically against LGBT civil rights". According to the TCRA, Chick-fil-A officials stated in an internal document that they "will treat every person equally, regardless of sexual orientation."&lt;ref name="Huff120919"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/19/chick-fil-a-anti-gay-organizations-funding-ceased_n_1896580.html|title=Chick-Fil-A Agrees To Cease Funding To Anti-Gay Organizations, Chicago LGBT Group Claims|last=Wong|first=Curtis|date=September 19, 2012|newspaper=[[Huffington Post]]|accessdate=September 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter from Chick-fil-A's Senior Director of Real Estate, the company stated: "The WinShape Foundations is now taking a much closer look at the organizations it considers helping, and in that process will remain true to its stated philosophy of not supporting organizations with political agendas."&lt;ref name="Dardick"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/ct-met-chick-fil-a-chicago-0919-20120919,0,3725045.story|title=Moreno relents, will allow Chick-fil-A|last=Dardick|first=Hal|date=September 19, 2012|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|location=Chicago, IL|accessdate=September 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Chicago [[Alderman]] [[Proco Joe Moreno|Proco "Joe" Moreno]], Chick-fil-A has a statement of respect for all sexual orientations in an internal document called ''Chick-fil-A: Who We Are'' and has promised that its not-for-profit arm, WinShape, will not contribute money to groups that oppose gay marriage.&lt;ref name="Voorhees"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2012/09/19/chick_fil_a_gay_marriage_chicken_chain_appears_to_quietly_change_winshape_foundation_strategy_.html|title=Chick-Fil-A Is Done Fighting Gay Marriage.

According to Focus on the Family website, ''CitizenLink.com'': "Contrary to reports first made by the gay-activist group The Civil Rights Agenda (TCRA) on Tuesday and later picked up by mainstream media outlets, Chick-fil-A and its charitable-giving arm, the WinShape Foundation, did not agree to stop making donations to groups that support the biblical definition of marriage in exchange for being allowed to open a franchise in Chicago."&lt;ref name="Dial"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizenlink.com/2012/09/20/chick-fil-a-sets-the-record-straight-2|title=Chick-fil-A Sets the Record Straight|last=Dial|first=Karla|publisher=Focus on the Family|work=Citizen Link|accessdate=September 22, 2012}}{{dead link|date=November 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Arkansas Governor and [[FOX News]] commentator [[Mike Huckabee]] claimed on September 21, 2012 that he had "talked earlier today personally with Dan Cathy, CEO of Chick-fil-A about the new reports that Chick-fil-A had capitulated to demands of the supporters of same sex marriage. This is not true. The company continues to focus on the fair treatment of all of its customers and employees, but to end confusion gave me this statement." The statement provided by Chick-fil-A was posted on Huckabee's website but the company did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0912/81543.html#ixzz3DIrLC3dl Mike Huckabee: Chick-fil-A hasn't changed], politico.com; accessed September 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014, new tax filings from 2012 showed that the company had stopped funding all but one organization which had been previously criticized by LGBT activists and supporters but, that group received just $25,390.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://goqnotes.com/27860/new-chick-fil-a-filings-show-decrease-in-anti-lgbt-funding/|title=New Chick-fil-A filings show decrease in anti-LGBT funding|author=Comer, Matt|date=March 3, 2014|publisher=''Q Notes''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company created a new foundation, the Chick-fil-A Foundation, to fund outside groups. WinShape Foundation's 2012 tax filings showed funding only for its own programs, a Berry College scholarship fund, and Lars WinShape, a home for needy children in Brazil.&lt;ref name="QNotes March 2014"/&gt;

In 2017, Chick-fil-A is warning all its franchisees against speaking out publicly or getting involved in anything that could blur the line between their private beliefs and their public roles as extensions of the Chick-fil-A brand, the company has said.

Last year, that message extended to politics, in part to keep the brand from being exploited by candidates. The company turned down several candidates who tried to use Chick-fil-A to bolster their campaigns, according to David Farmer, Chick-fil-A's vice president of menu strategy and development.

"There are several candidates who would like to use us as a platform," Farmer told Business Insider last year. "We are not engaging. Chick-fil-A is about food, and that's it."

The company still encourages its franchisees to get "entrenched" in their communities. Operators' involvement in their communities is a critical part of what has helped Chick-fil-A attract a passionate following.

Traditionally, that has meant getting involved in local churches. But although Chick-fil-A says its focus now — both for local and corporate involvement and philanthropy — is on youth and education causes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/chick-fil-a-reinvents-itself-liberal-conservative-2017-5|title='Chick-fil-A is about food': How national ambitions led the chain to shed its polarizing image|author=Peterson, Hayley|date=August 6, 2017|publisher=''Business Insider''}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Chick-fil-A's associated foundation continues to donate hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to causes characterized as anti-gay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thinkprogress.org/chick-fil-a-still-anti-gay-970f079bf85/|title='Chick-fil-A is still bankrolling anti-LGBTQ causes|author=Israel, Josh|date=July 6, 2017|publisher=''ThinkProgress''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chick-Fil-A announced their expansion to Canada in the city of Toronto.&lt;ref name="finanpost"&gt;{{cite web |last=Deschamps |first=Tara |title=Controversial Chick-fil-A coming to Canada as Toronto proves magnet for foreign fast food |url=https://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/u-s-fast-food-brand-chick-fil-a-announces-plans-to-come-to-canada |publisher=''Financial Post''|accessdate=October 13, 2018|date=July 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused a number of boycotts and backlash from Canadians due to the huge support of LGBT in Canada, telling the company that they were not welcome in Canada with homophobia and transphobia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Puhak |first1=Janine |title=Chick-fil-A's Canadian expansion sparks pro-LGBTQ protests |url=https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/chick-fil-as-canadian-expansion-sparks-pro-lgbtq-protests |publisher=''Fox News'' |accessdate=October 13, 2018 |date=July 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2018, Chick-Fil-A still plans to open in Toronto.&lt;ref name="finanpost"/&gt;

==Controversy==
===Local government===
After the publication of Cathy's interviews, Democrat [[Thomas Menino]], the [[Mayor#United States of America|Mayor]] of [[Boston]], stated that he would not allow the company to open franchises in the city "unless they open up their policies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Turner|first=Greg|title=Mayor Menino on Chick-fil-A: Stuff it|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/news/regional/view.bg?articleid=1061147182&amp;srvc=home&amp;position=emailed|accessdate=July 21, 2012|newspaper=The Boston Herald|date=July 20, 2012|quote=Chick-fil-A doesn't belong in Boston.

That's where it all started right here. And we're not going to have a company, Chick-fil-A or whatever the hell the name is, on our Freedom Trail.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Menino subsequently wrote a letter to Dan Cathy, citing Cathy's earlier statement on ''The Ken Coleman Show'', and responded: "We are indeed full of pride for our support of same sex marriage and our work to expand freedom for all people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mayor's letter to Chick-fil-A|url=http://bostonherald.com/news/document.bg?f=misc/Chick-fil-A-1&amp;h=Mayor%27s%20letter%20to%20Chick-fil-A&amp;p=&amp;k=bh|accessdate=July 26, 2012|newspaper=The Boston Herald|date=July 20, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724180750/http://bostonherald.com/news/document.bg?f=misc%2FChick-fil-A-1&amp;h=Mayor%27s%20letter%20to%20Chick-fil-A&amp;p=&amp;k=bh#|archive-date=July 24, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Chicago, Democratic alderman Proco "Joe" Moreno announced his determination to block Chick-fil-A's bid to build a second store in the city: "They'd have to do a complete 180", Moreno said in outlining conditions under which he would retract the block. "They'd have to work with [[LGBT]] groups in terms of hiring, and there would have to be a public apology from [Cathy]."&lt;ref name=Chicagoalderman&gt;{{cite news|last=Dardick|first=Hal|title=Alderman to Chick-fil-A: No deal|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/breaking/ct-met-chicago-chick-fil-a-20120725,0,929023.story|accessdate=July 26, 2012|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=July 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreno received backing from Chicago's Mayor, [[Rahm Emanuel]]: "Chick-fil-A values are not Chicago values", Emanuel said in a statement. "They disrespect our fellow neighbors and residents. This would be a bad investment, since it would be empty."&lt;ref name=Chicagoalderman/&gt;

[[San Francisco]] soon followed suit on July 26 when mayor Democrat [[Edwin M. Lee]] [[Twitter|tweeted]], "Very disappointed #ChickFilA doesn't share San Francisco's values &amp; strong commitment to equality for everyone." Lee followed that tweet with "Closest #ChickFilA to San Francisco is 40 miles away &amp; I strongly recommend that they not try to come any closer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lopez|first=Ricardo|title=San Francisco is the third city to tell Chick-fil-A: Keep out|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/money/la-fi-mo-san-franciso-mayor-to-chickfila-keep-out-20120726,0,4169780.story|accessdate=July 26, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=July 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed bans in Boston and Chicago drew criticism from some liberal pundits, legal experts, and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU). [[Kevin Drum]] of ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' magazine said "[T]here's really no excuse for Emanuel's and Menino's actions... you don't hand out business licenses based on whether you agree with the political views of the executives. Not in America, anyway ... what makes this whole situation so weird is that Chick-fil-A President Dan Cathy has always opposed gay marriage. He's a devout Southern Baptist, just like his father, who founded the company. The place is closed on Sundays, for crying out loud.

===Backlash===
Students at several colleges and universities launched efforts to ban or remove the company's restaurants from their campuses. On November 3, 2011, [[New York University]]'s Student Senators Council voted 19 to 4 to retain the Chick-fil-A franchise on campus. This vote came before a petition with over 11,000 signatures opposing its presence on campus was sent to the student council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nyulocal.com/on-campus/2012/03/05/student-council-voted-to-keep-homophobic-chick-fil-a-long-before-petition-launched|title=NYU Decided To Keep "Homophobic" Chick-fil-A Long Before Petition Launched|date=March 5, 2012|accessdate=July 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christine Quinn]], a lesbian politician and then-Speaker of the [[New York City Council|City Council]] who was seeking the nomination as Democratic candidate for the mayoralty in the next election, was outspoken in her opposition to keeping the Chick-fil-A franchise or allowing others, and wrote a letter to this effect to NYU President John Sexton on official letterhead, opening with the words, "I write as the Speaker of the NYC Council", urging NYU to evict a Chick-fil-A due to Cathy's opposition to same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/christine-quinn-overstepped-authority-letter-nyu-chick-fil-a-article-1.1126238 Christine Quinn letter to NYU], nydailynews.com; accessed July 24, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/christine-quinn-chick-fil-a-quit-new-york-won-action-article-1.1126381 "Christine Quinn wants Chick-Fil-A to quit New York"], nydailynews.com; accessed July 24, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 28, 2012, [[Northeastern University]]'s Student Senate passed a resolution to cancel plans for a Chick-fil-A franchise on its campus, stating "the student body does not support bringing CFA [Chick-fil-A] to campus", and "Student concerns reflected CFA's history of donating to anti-gay organizations."

'''Clara Estelle Breed''' (March 19, 1906 &amp;ndash; September 8, 1994)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/56940826/clara-estelle-breed|title=Clara Estelle Breed (1906-1994) - Find A Grave...|website=www.findagrave.com|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[librarian]] in [[San Diego, California]], remembered chiefly for her support for [[Japanese American]] children during [[World War II]]. After the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941, many residents of California who were of Japanese descent were moved to remote [[Japanese American internment]] camps where they stayed until the end of the war. Breed kept in communication with many of the children who were sent to the camps, sending reading materials and visiting them regularly.&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheim, J. (2006). HOW I FOUND Dear Miss Breed. ''Book Links'', 16(1), 13&amp;ndash;14.&lt;/ref&gt;

She worked for the [[San Diego Public Library]] system for more than 40 years, including 25 years as city librarian.

== Early life and education ==
Clara Breed was born in [[Fort Dodge, Iowa]], in 1906. Her parents were Estelle Marie Potter and Reuben Leonard Breed, a Congregational minister. The family lived in New York and Illinois, before moving San Diego in 1920 following the death of Reuben Breed.&lt;ref name="poston"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://postoninterneeobituaries.blogspot.com/2011/11/breed-miss-clara-estelle-1906-1994.html|title=Breed, Miss Clara Estelle (1906&amp;ndash;1994)|work=Poston Internee Obituaries|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1923 graduate of [[San Diego High School]] and a 1927 graduate of [[Pomona College]], Breed received her master's degree in library science from [[Western Reserve University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Clara_Breed/|title=Clara Breed|work=Densho Encyclopedia|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
In 1928 Breed started work as the children's librarian in the East San Diego branch library. In 1945 she was named acting city librarian. The following year, she was appointed San Diego's city librarian, a position she held for 25 years. During her tenure as city librarian, the library system expanded with the creation of a new main library in 1955, and the addition of several branch libraries. She established the Serra Cooperative Library System that increased efficiency of [[interlibrary loan]]s. Previously, library patrons only could check books out of the agency (city, county, etc.) to which they belonged. With the creation of the [[library consortium|cooperative library system]], patrons could borrow books from libraries throughout [[San Diego County, California|San Diego]] and [[Imperial County, California|Imperial]] counties.&lt;ref name = "history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegohistory.org/online_resources/breed.html|title=Clara Estelle Breed (1906&amp;ndash;1994)|publisher=San Diego History Center|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also the driving force behind the construction of San Diego's central library building in the 1950s.&lt;ref name = "library"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdm16736.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/singleitem/collection/p16736coll1/id/32/rec/7|title=Clara Breed, City Librarian, San Diego Public Library, 1945&amp;ndash;1970|publisher=San Diego Public Library|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983 she wrote a centennial history of the San Diego library system, ''Turning the Pages: San Diego Public Library History, 1882&amp;ndash;1982''.&lt;ref name = "library" /&gt;

== World War II and the internment of Japanese American children ==

When the United States became involved in World War II, many families of Japanese descent were moved from San Diego and other [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] cities to [[Japanese American internment|internment]] camps in Arizona and other inland locations. Many of these Japanese-American children were patrons of the library. Breed noticed that before the children were sent to the camps, their behavior and manners had changed; the formerly outgoing and enthusiastic learners had become sullen and withdrawn. When the day came for the children's departure, many of them came to the library to return their library cards and to say goodbye to Breed. She gave the children self-addressed stamped [[postcard]]s and told them to write to her and to tell her what they needed. When the children wrote, she responded and sent them not only reading materials but personal items such as soap and toothbrushes as well. Many of her former library patrons were sent to the [[Poston War Relocation Center]] internment camp in Arizona, where she visited them multiple times.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, T. (2007). Doing Their Part: The Services of the San Diego Public Library during World War II. ''Library Trends'', 55(3), 570&amp;ndash;582.&lt;/ref&gt;

Breed was an outspoken opponent of [[Executive Order 9066]], the internment policy instituted by President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] in February 1942. She wrote to many members of Congress and wrote two published articles about the unfair treatment of the children and the other Japanese Americans placed in internment camps. "[http://www.janm.org/exhibits/breed/art_t.htm All but Blind]"&lt;ref&gt;Breed, C. (1943). All but Blind. ''Library Journal, 68'', 119&amp;ndash;121.&lt;/ref&gt; appeared in ''[[Library Journal]]'' in 1943, and "Americans with the Wrong Ancestors" &lt;ref&gt;Breed, C. (1943). Americans with the wrong ancestors. ''Horn Book Magazine, 19'', 253&amp;ndash;261.&lt;/ref&gt; appeared in ''[[The Horn Book Magazine]]'' the same year. She also wrote letters requesting that college-age students from the internment camps be allowed to attend school in the Midwest, and sent requests to reunite some of the fathers who were separated from their families because they had been deemed to be "security risks."&lt;ref name = "history" /&gt;

Breed received more than 250 letters and postcards from the children during the time they were interned. One of the most prized gifts she received during this time was a carving of her name in [[manzanita]] wood that one of the children had created using the sharp end of a bed spring.&lt;ref name = "history" /&gt;

== Post-war recognition ==
In 1955, Breed was named "San Diego Woman of the Year" by the San Diego Women's Service Council. In 1991, she was honored at the Poston Camp III reunion held in San Diego. In 1993 she received a commendation from President [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref name = "library" /&gt;

In 1993, she gave the letters and artifacts she had saved to one of her former pen pals, Elizabeth (Kikuchi) Yamada, a retired high school English teacher. Yamada donated them to the [[Japanese American National Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;"Clara Estelle Breed; ‘library lady’ who guided city’s modern system" in ''San Diego Union-Tribune'', September 10, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; which featured them in an exhibit called "Dear Miss Breed: Letters from Camp"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janm.org/exhibits/breed/title.htm|title=Dear Miss Breed: Letters from Camp|publisher=Japanese American National Museum|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then made them part of the museum's permanent collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janm.org/collections/clara-breed-collection/|title=Clara Breed Collection|publisher=Japanese American National Museum|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Smithsonian Institution]] incorporated four of the "Dear Miss Breed" letters into a lesson plan on the use of letters as primary historical documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianeducation.org/educators/lesson_plans/japanese_internment/|title=Letters from the Japanese American Internment|publisher=Smithsonian Education|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her letters were also the basis for a 2006 book, ''Dear Miss Breed: True Stories of the Japanese American Incarceration during World War II and a Librarian Who Made a Difference,'' by Joanne Oppenheim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2006-03-27-miss-breed_x.htm?csp=34|title=A picture of 'Miss Breed,' a snapshot of war hysteria|last=Minzesheimer|first=Bob|date=March 26, 2006|work=USA Today|accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Breed was Inducted into the [[San Diego Women's Hall of Fame]] in the Cultural Competent Bridge Builder category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womensmuseumca.org/hall-of-fame/clara-breed|title=Clara Breed|work=Women's Museum of California|accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
The goal of leader development is "the expansion of the person's capacity to be effective in leadership roles and processes."{{attribution needed|date=August 2013}} The two central elements to this are: 
# Leadership can be learned…people do learn, grow, and change
# Leader development helps to make a person effective in a variety of formal and informal leadership roles.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hackman|first=M.|title=Leadership: A communication perspective.|publisher=Waveland Press Inc, Publishers|isbn=978-1-57766-579-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leader development promotes personal growth, helping individuals develop their abilities to manage themselves, to work effectively with others, and to ensure that the work gets done.
Leadership development promotes organizational growth, helping the group as a whole develop the leaders it needs to carry out such tasks as securing the commitment of members and setting direction.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Establishing connections with people who can help one achieve one's goals will increase your chances of emerging as a leader in an organizational context.
A great deal of a leader's development happens internally. Leadership development is an "inside-out" process that starts within the leader and then moves outward to impact others.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} A leader's effectiveness is based on character principles like fairness, integrity, honesty, service, excellence, and growth. According to [[Stephen R. Covey|Stephen Covey's]] ''[[The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People]]'', habits are a combination of knowledge (what to do and why to do it), skill (how to do it), and motivation (wanting to do it).
* ''Habit 1'' is to be proactive; proactive leaders realize that they can choose how they respond to events.
* ''Habit 2'' is to begin with the end in mind; effective leaders always keep their ultimate goals in mind.
* ''Habit 3'' is to put first things first; leader's time should be organized around priorities.
* ''Habit 4'' is to think win/win; those with win/win perspectives take a mutual gains approach to communication, believing that the best solution benefits both parties.
* ''Habit 5'' is to seek first to understand, and then to be understood; effective leaders put aside their personal concerns to engage in empathetic listening.
* ''Habit 6'' is synergize; synergy creates a solution that is greater than the sum of its parts.
* ''Habit 7'' is to sharpen the saw; continual renewal of the physical, social/emotional, spiritual, and mental dimensions of the self.

Spirituality has played a critical role in leaders development, "helping them to make and follow through on their moral choices, develop virtues and character, identify their values and purpose, reaching job assignments and hardships." There are some common spiritual practices that promote leader effectiveness, such as 1. Treating others fairly, 2. Expressing care and concern, 3. Listening responsively, 4. Appreciating the contributions of others, 5. Engaging in reflective practice.,&lt;ref name="Covey 2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Covey|first=S.|title=The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People|year=2004|publisher=Free Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-7432-6951-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "Personal Mastery", the first pathway in Cashman's Seven Pathways to Mastery.&lt;ref name="Cashman 1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cashman|first=K.|title=Leadership from the Inside Out|year=1999|publisher=Executive Excellence Publishing|location=Provo, UT|isbn=978-1-890009-31-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-leadership==
It has been argued, by people such as Kevin Cashman, that leadership should be looked at from within.&lt;ref&gt;Stogdill, R. M. (1965). ''Managers, employees, organizations''. Columbus: Ohio State University, Bureau of Business Research.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cashman, leadership can be defined as the "authentic self-expression that creates value."&lt;ref&gt;McGregor, D. (1960). ''The human side of enterprise''. New York: McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|0071462228}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of leadership can be found at all levels within an organization.&lt;ref name="Hackman"&gt;Hackman, M. &amp; Johnson, C. (2009). ''Leadership: A communication perspective''.  Long Grove, IL: Waveland Press, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; He identifies seven pathways for individuals to lead from the inside out. Instead of a hierarchical order, these pathways are created holistically.&lt;ref name="Hackman, M. 2009"&gt;Hackman, M. &amp; Johnson, C. (2009). ''Leadership: A communication perspective''. Long Grove, IL: Waveland Press, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pathway One: Personal  Mastery'''&lt;ref name="Hackman"/&gt;
*Exploring and getting to know yourself and what is important to you by asking questions such as:
**What do I believe about myself and other people?
**What do I believe about leadership
**What do I believe about life and the world?
'''Pathway Two: Purpose Mastery'''&lt;ref name="Hackman"/&gt;
*Focusing on understanding and using your gifts and talents to add value to those around you
*Identifying activities that are energizing and exciting
'''Pathway Three: Change Mastery'''&lt;ref name="Hackman"/&gt;
*Letting go of old patterns to enhance creativity
*Being adaptable and willing to change 
*Changing current reality allows a leader to see a new reality 
'''Pathway Four: Interpersonal Mastery'''&lt;ref name="Hackman, M. 2009"/&gt;
*Focusing on the development of interpersonal competencies 
*Seeking feedback from others will help to improve personal relationships
'''Pathway Five: Being Mastery'''&lt;ref name="Hackman, M. 2009"/&gt;

*Leading as a whole person by getting in touch with one's authentic self and expressing it to others

==Leading followers through change==
According to Klepper (1997), there are four main periods organizations go through when there is change within. The first period is the Formative Period. It is when a new organization is just getting started. Although there is a founding vision, there are no formal definitions. This is just as well because normally there are a lot of experimentation and innovation taking place. These changes of creativity and discovery are needed to overcome obstacles and accomplish breakthroughs. The second period is Rapid Growth Period. Direction and coordination are added to the organization to sustain growth and solidify gains. Change is focused on defining the purpose of the organization and on the mainstream business. The third period is the Mature Period. The strong growth curve levels off to the overall pace of the economy. Changes are needed to maintain established markets and assuring maximum gains are achieved. The fourth and last period is the Declining Period. This is the rough ride. For many organizations it means down-sizing and reorganization. To survive, changes include tough objectives and compassionate implementation. The goal is to get out of the old and into something new. Success in this period means that the four periods start over again.
&lt;ref name="nwlink.com"&gt;http://www.nwlink.com/~donclark/leader/leadchg.html&lt;/ref&gt;

It is extremely important for leaders to be flexible and acceptable to change because it is inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;(McNamara)&lt;/ref&gt; In order to get through change, organizations need good leaders to help them guide through these tough times. It is vital that the leader keeps the core values of the company in tact while they go through change to make sure that the company still meets the needs of it customers. Some leaders will take note of previous leaders and adopt certain things that were successful that those other leaders did when they went through change. The leader needs to keep the other employees focused during this change period.
&lt;ref&gt;http://managementhelp.org/organizationalchange/&lt;/ref&gt;

As mentioned, leaders really need to have their followers focus on change acceptance since change is inevitable. Connor (1997) says there are five steps to help followers through this.

# Denial – cannot foresee any major changes
# Anger – at others for what they're putting me through
# Bargaining – work out solutions, keep everyone happy
# Depression – is it worth it? doubt, need support
# Acceptance – the reality

Using these steps will help employees and followers understand what is happening and make them more apt to work through the changes instead of just giving up and not giving you their best work they are capable of. People get very comfortable with what they are used to and do not want to have to do something else that they are not comfortable with. People get in routines and like to stick with them if they are working out. There are a few attitudes that leaders can give to employees to help them accept change.

From "Why?" to "What new opportunities will this provide?"
When they ask "why," focus on the benefits that the change will provide them and the organization. Do NOT feel uncomfortable if you are feeling hesitation about the change too...you are also human. By spelling out the benefits, you will not only comfort them, but help to convince yourself too.

From "How will this affect me?" to "What problems will this solve?"
Anything that prevents something from being better is a problem. Let them know what the problem is and how they will be part of the solution.

From "We do not do it this way." to "What would it look like?"
Show them, provide plenty of explanations and compassion, and get your team to ask and answer questions.

From "When will this change be over so we can get back to work?" to "What can I do to help?"
Get them involved in implementing the change. Help them to become part of it.

From "Who is doing this to us?" to "Who can help us?"
Focus on the challenges that must be overcome. Ensure that you enlist help from other departments and colleagues.
&lt;ref name="nwlink.com"/&gt;

By trying to change these views of employees it will make change much easier for everyone and it might end up being for the better.

== Communication and leadership as an internal process ==

According to Hackman and Johnson, communication is an integral part of the internal process of leaders.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Leaders must face many obstacles and challenging situations that can lead to personal growth. Much of the personal development that occurs for leaders is done as an internal process.

As they personally deal with issues, they make decisions that affect their lives and the lives of others. Intrapersonal communication plays an important role in the decision making process and for personal development of the leader. What this communication does inwardly eventually manifests itself in outward effects.

===Personal development as an internal process===
Personal development is an important aspect of leadership.&lt;ref name="Liu 2010 454–479"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=J.|author2=Siu, O. |author3=Shi, K. |title=Transformational leadership and employee well-being: The mediating role of trust in the leader and self-efficacy|journal=Applied Psychology: an International Review|date=July 2010|volume=59|issue=3|pages=454–479|doi=10.1111/j.1464-0597.2009.00407.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need for programs specializing in personal development is widely accepted across a variety of fields from science &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rao|first=S.|title=Personal professional development|journal=AIP Conference Proceedings|date=19 April 2009|volume=1119|issue=1|pages=7–10|doi=10.1063/1.3137917}}&lt;/ref&gt; to religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=E.|title=Personal, institutional, and communal leadership: Rethinking leadership development for the jewish community|journal=Journal of Jewish Communal Service|year=2007|volume=82|issue=3|pages=234–243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leadership programs focus on both the outward display or leadership and the inward attitudes, behaviors, and beliefs. Many of the authors of leadership books around the turn of the century began highlighting the internal process side of leadership development including Stephen Covey, author of ''The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People'', and Kevin Cashman, author of ''Leadership from the Inside Out''. Both were widely successful best-sellers which focused on internal concepts such as "Being Proactive", Habit 1 in Covey's 7 Habits,&lt;ref name="Covey 2004"/&gt; or "Personal Mastery", the first pathway in Cashman's Seven Pathways to Mastery.&lt;ref name="Cashman 1999"/&gt;

These books have spawned personal leadership development programs and seminars designed to help leaders become more in tune with their selves and work on their weaknesses. Recognizing weak points and improving upon them is one valuable skill for leadership development.&lt;ref name="Liu 2010 454–479"/&gt;

Many leadership programs focus on changing attitudes, behaviors, and beliefs within a person.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Kevin Cashman argues that leadership "comes from within and is an expression of who we are."&lt;ref name="Cashman 1999"/&gt;

=== Role of intrapersonal communication ===

When leaders begin self-reflective analysis of themselves, they begin to engage in [[intrapersonal communication]]. Intrapersonal communication is defined as communication occurring within the individual mind or self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Merriam-Webster|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intrapersonal|work=Merriam-Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be as simple as internal thoughts or more complex neurophysiological means of examining our self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walla|first=P|author2=Greiner, K. |author3=Duregger, C. |author4=Deecke, L. |author5=Thurner, S. |title=Self-awareness and the subconscious effect of personal pronouns on word encoding: A magnetoencephalography (MEG) study|journal=Neuropsychologia|year=2007|volume=45|issue=4|pages=796–809|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.08.017 |pmid=17005211}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a long history of research on intrapersonal communication and its connection to internal development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jemmer|first=P.|title=Intrapersonal communication: The hidden language|journal=European Journal of Clinical Hypnosis|year=2009|volume=9|issue=1|pages=37–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals frequently engage in intrapersonal communication as a means of self-awareness and it is an internal process related to personal development.&lt;ref name="Nurius 1988 335–345"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nurius|first=P.|author2=Majerus, D.|title=Rethinking the self in self-talk: A theoretical note and case example|journal=Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology|year=1988|pages=335–345|doi=10.1521/jscp.1988.6.3-4.335|volume=6|issue=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For leaders, there are many benefits for intrapersonal communication. Intrapersonal communication can increase self-awareness.&lt;ref name="Nurius 1988 335–345"/&gt; It can give the leader a better view of self. Research shows it is a means of overcoming communication apprehension, for both interpersonal and public communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Francis|first=T.|author2=Miller, M.|title=Communication apprehension: Levels of first-generation college students at 2-year institutions|journal=Community College Journal of Research &amp; Practice|date=Jan 2008|volume=32|issue=1|pages=38–55|doi=10.1080/10668920701746688}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are some of the benefits for the leader who engages in intrapersonal communication as an internal process for personal development.

== Innovative leadership and change ==

There is little peer-reviewed material on the intermingling of [[innovation]] and [[leadership]].  It is, however, very evident{{According to whom|date=August 2013}} that great innovation comes from great leaders.  [[Steve Jobs]] is an example of one of the great technological innovators of our time.{{According to whom|date=August 2013}} As a new phenomenon and thought, many{{who|date=August 2013}} are seeking out how leadership effects innovation and vice versa.  Many acknowledge the need for public sector support and societal support of innovation in order for funding to occur, and in turn, innovation to occur,&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, J.S. &amp; Machado-Taylor, M.D.M. (2010). Leading Strategic Change in Higher Education: The Need for a Paradigm Shift toward Visionary Leadership. Frontiers in Higher Education (Claes, T. &amp; Preston, D.S., Eds.) Editions Rodopi BV: New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; many universities are implementing innovation networks, and the necessity for unique and independent thinkers is apparent.  [[Google]] says, "Our commitment to innovation depends on everyone being comfortable sharing ideas and opinions".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com/about/corporate/company/culture.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transformational leadership and innovation ===
[[Transformational leadership]], a type of leadership that has an ability to change an organization,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; would likely produce innovation.  Since innovation is more than simply invention, the process of leadership can in and of itself be innovative.  Innovation is a crucial part of being an effective and productive transformational leader.  A transformational leader is creative, interactive, visionary, empowering, and passionate.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; These same characteristics could be assigned to an innovator.  A transformational leader produces innovative followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rank | first1 = J. | last2 = Nelson | first2 = N.E. | last3 = Allen | first3 = T.D. | last4 = Xian | first4 = X. | year = 2009 | title = Leadership predictors of innovation and task performance: Subordinates' self-esteem and self-presentation as moderators | url = | journal = Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology | volume = 82 | issue = 3| pages = 465–489 | doi = 10.1348/096317908X371547 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The subordinates self-concept function determines how the follower will react to the leader.  (cite same article above) The capabilities and strengths of a leader to be a leader have a direct effect on an organization's success.&lt;ref name="Boatman, J. 2011"&gt;Boatman, J. &amp; Wellins, R. (2011). It's Time for a Leadership Revolution. T+D Publications, American Society for Training and Development: Pittsburgh, PA.&lt;/ref&gt;  Oftentimes, leaders are not trained well in leadership development, leaving them unprepared to foster an environment of innovation.&lt;ref name="Boatman, J. 2011"/&gt;  An innovative leader is a transformational leader.{{According to whom|date=August 2013}}

The [[thiol]] side chain in cysteine often participates in [[enzymatic]] reactions, as a [[nucleophile]].  The thiol is susceptible to oxidation to give the [[disulfide bond|disulfide]] derivative [[cystine]], which serves an important structural role in many [[protein]]s. When used as a food additive, it has the [[E number]] E920.  It is [[Genetic code|encoded]] by the [[codon]]s UGU and UGC.

Cysteine has the same structure as [[serine]], but with one of its oxygen atoms replaced by [[sulfur]]; replacing it with [[selenium]] gives [[selenocysteine]]. (Like other natural proteinogenic amino acids cysteine has (L) [[dextrorotation and levorotation|chirality]] in the older D/L notation based on homology to D and L glyceraldehyde.  In the newer R/S system of designating chirality, based on the atomic numbers of atoms near the asymmetric carbon, cysteine (and selenocysteine) have R chirality, because of the presence of sulfur (resp. selenium) as a second neighbor to the asymmetric carbon.  The remaining chiral amino acids, having lighter atoms in that position, have S chirality.)

==Dietary sources==

Although classified as a non[[essential amino acid]], in rare cases, cysteine may be essential for infants, the elderly, and individuals with certain metabolic diseases or who suffer from [[malabsorption]] [[syndrome]]s. Cysteine can usually be synthesized by the human body under normal physiological conditions if a sufficient quantity of [[methionine]] is available.  It is [[catabolized]] in the gastrointestinal tract and blood plasma.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}&lt;!--

Obvious contradiction, not going to delete because reversions

--&gt; In contrast, [[cystine]] travels safely through the GI tract and [[blood plasma]] and is promptly reduced to the two cysteine molecules upon cell entry.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Cysteine is found in most high-[[protein]] foods, including:

Like other amino acids, cysteine has an [[Amphoterism|amphoteric]] character.

== Industrial sources ==

The majority of &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-cysteine is obtained industrially by [[hydrolysis]] of animal materials, such as poultry feathers or hog hair. Despite widespread belief otherwise, little evidence shows that human hair is used as a source material and its use is explicitly banned in the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU Chemical Requirements|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:083:0001:0295:EN:PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synthetically produced &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-cysteine, compliant with Jewish [[kosher]] and Muslim [[halal]] laws, is also available, albeit at a higher price.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url= http://www.vrg.org/nutshell/faqingredients.htm#cystine |title= Questions About Food Ingredients: What is L-cysteine/cysteine/cystine? |publisher= Vegetarian Resource Group |postscript= .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The synthetic route involves fermentation using a mutant of ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]''.

== Biosynthesis ==

[[File:Cysteine biosynthesis.svg|thumb|150px|Cysteine synthesis: [[Cystathionine beta synthase]] catalyzes the upper reaction and [[cystathionine gamma-lyase]] catalyzes the lower reaction.]]
In animals, biosynthesis begins with the amino acid [[serine]].  The sulfur is derived from [[methionine]], which is converted to [[homocysteine]] through the intermediate [[S-adenosylmethionine]].  [[Cystathionine beta-synthase]] then combines homocysteine and serine to form the asymmetrical thioether [[cystathionine]].  The enzyme [[cystathionine gamma-lyase]] converts the cystathionine into cysteine and [[alpha-ketobutyrate]].  In [[plant]]s and [[bacteria]], cysteine biosynthesis also starts from serine, which is converted  to ''O''-acetylserine by the enzyme serine transacetylase. The enzyme O-acetylserine (thiol)-lyase, using sulfide sources, converts this ester into cysteine, releasing acetate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hell R |title=Molecular physiology of plant sulfur metabolism |journal=Planta |volume=202 |issue=2 |pages=138–48 |year=1997 |pmid=9202491 |doi=10.1007/s004250050112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological functions==
The cysteine sulfhydryl group is [[nucleophile|nucleophilic]] and easily oxidized. The reactivity is enhanced when the thiol is ionized, and cysteine [[amino acid residue|residue]]s in proteins have [[acid dissociation constant|pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] values close to neutrality, so are often in their reactive [[thiolate]] form in the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bulaj G, Kortemme T, Goldenberg DP |title=Ionization-reactivity relationships for cysteine thiols in polypeptides |journal=Biochemistry |volume=37 |issue=25 |pages=8965–72 |date=June 1998 |pmid=9636038 |doi=10.1021/bi973101r}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of its high reactivity, the sulfhydryl group of cysteine has numerous biological functions, and cysteine may have played an important role in the development of primitive life on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vallee|first=Yannick|last2=Shalayel|first2=Ibrahim|last3=Ly|first3=Kieu-Dung|last4=Rao|first4=K.

===Precursor to the antioxidant glutathione===
Due to the ability of thiols to undergo redox reactions, cysteine has [[antioxidant]] properties. Its antioxidant properties are typically expressed in the tripeptide [[glutathione]], which occurs in humans and other organisms. The systemic availability of oral glutathione (GSH) is negligible; so it must be biosynthesized from its constituent amino acids, cysteine, [[glycine]], and [[glutamic acid]]. While glutamic acid is usually sufficient because amino acid nitrogen is recycled through glutamate as an intermediary, dietary cysteine and glycine supplementation can improve synthesis of glutathione&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sekhar |first1=Rajagopal V |last2=Patel |first2=Sanjeet G |title=Deficient synthesis of glutathione underlies oxidative stress in aging and can be corrected by dietary cysteine and glycine supplementation |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |date=2011 |volume=94 |issue=3 |pages=847-853 |doi=10.3945/ajcn.110.003483 |url=https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/94/3/847/4431102 |accessdate=29 November 2018}} {{Open Access}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Precursor to iron-sulfur clusters===
Cysteine is an important source of [[sulfide]] in human [[metabolism]]. The sulfide in [[iron-sulfur cluster]]s and in [[nitrogenase]] is extracted from cysteine, which is converted to [[alanine]] in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lill R, Mühlenhoff U |title=Iron-sulfur protein biogenesis in eukaryotes: components and mechanisms |journal=Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. |volume=22 |issue= |pages=457–86 |year=2006 |pmid=16824008 |doi=10.1146/annurev.cellbio.22.010305.104538|url=http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bvb:12-bsb00055966-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metal ion binding===
Beyond the iron-sulfur proteins, many other metal cofactors in enzymes are bound to the thiolate substituent of cysteinyl residues.  Examples include zinc in [[zinc finger]]s and [[alcohol dehydrogenase]], copper in the [[plastocyanin|blue copper protein]]s, iron in [[cytochrome P450]], and nickel in the [NiFe]-[[hydrogenase]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Stephen J. |last1=Lippard |first2=Jeremy M. |last2=Berg |title=Principles of Bioinorganic Chemistry |publisher=University Science Books |location=Mill Valley, CA |year=1994 |isbn=0-935702-73-3}}{{page needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sulfhydryl group also has a high [[Affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]]s, so that proteins  containing cysteine, such as [[metallothionein]], will [[ligand|bind]] metals such as mercury, lead, and cadmium tightly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baker DH, Czarnecki-Maulden GL |title=Pharmacologic role of cysteine in ameliorating or exacerbating mineral toxicities |journal=J. Nutr. |volume=117 |issue=6 |pages=1003–10 |date=June 1987 |pmid=3298579 |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=3298579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roles in protein structure===
In the translation of messenger RNA molecules to produce polypeptides, cysteine is coded for by the UGU and UGC [[codon]]s.

Cysteine has traditionally been considered to be a [[hydrophilic]] amino acid, based largely on the chemical parallel between its [[thiol group|sulfhydryl group]] and the [[hydroxyl]] groups in the side chains of other polar amino acids. However, the cysteine side chain has been shown to stabilize hydrophobic interactions in micelles to a greater degree than the side chain in the nonpolar amino acid glycine and the polar amino acid serine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Heitmann P |title=A model for sulfhydryl groups in proteins. Hydrophobic interactions of the cystein side chain in micelles |journal=Eur. J. Biochem. |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=346–50 |date=January 1968 |pmid=5650851 |doi=10.1111/j.1432-1033.1968.tb19535.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a statistical analysis of the frequency with which amino acids appear in different chemical environments in the structures of proteins, free cysteine residues were found to associate with hydrophobic regions of proteins. Their hydrophobic tendency was equivalent to that of known nonpolar amino acids such as [[methionine]] and [[tyrosine]] (tyrosine is polar aromatic but also hydrophobic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wbiomed.curtin.edu.au/biochem/tutorials/AAs/AA.html|title=A Review of Amino Acids (tutorial)|publisher=Curtin University}}&lt;/ref&gt;), those of which were much greater than that of known polar amino acids such as serine and [[threonine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nagano N, Ota M, Nishikawa K |title=Strong hydrophobic nature of cysteine residues in proteins |journal=FEBS Lett. |volume=458 |issue=1 |pages=69–71 |date=September 1999 |pmid=10518936 |doi=10.1016/S0014-5793(99)01122-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hydrophobicity scales]], which rank amino acids from most hydrophobic to most hydrophilic, consistently place cysteine towards the hydrophobic end of the spectrum, even when they are based on methods that are not influenced by the tendency of cysteines to form disulfide bonds in proteins. Therefore, cysteine is now often grouped among the hydrophobic amino acids,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.russelllab.org/aas/hydrophobic.html | title = Hydrophobic amino acids | accessdate = 2012-09-16 | last = Betts | first = M.J. |author2=R.B.

While free cysteine residues do occur in proteins, most are covalently bonded to other cysteine residues to form [[disulfide bond]]s, which play an important role in the folding and stability of some proteins, usually proteins secreted to the extracellular medium.&lt;ref name=Sevier&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sevier CS, Kaiser CA |title=Formation and transfer of disulphide bonds in living cells |journal=Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. |volume=3 |issue=11 |pages=836–47 |date=November 2002 |pmid=12415301 |doi=10.1038/nrm954}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since most cellular compartments are [[reducing environment]]s, disulfide bonds are generally unstable in the [[cytosol]] with some exceptions as noted below.

[[Image:Cystine-skeletal.png|thumb|right|150px|Figure 2: [[Cystine]] (shown here in its neutral form), two cysteines bound together by a disulfide bond]]

Disulfide bonds in proteins are formed by oxidation of the sulfhydryl group of cysteine residues. The other sulfur-containing amino acid, methionine, cannot form disulfide bonds.  More aggressive oxidants convert cysteine to the corresponding [[sulfinic acid]] and [[sulfonic acid]]. Cysteine residues play a valuable role by crosslinking proteins, which increases the rigidity of proteins and also functions to confer proteolytic resistance (since protein export is a costly process, minimizing its necessity is advantageous).  Inside the cell, disulfide bridges between cysteine residues within a polypeptide support the protein's tertiary structure.  [[Insulin]] is an example of a protein with cystine crosslinking, wherein two separate peptide chains are connected by a pair of disulfide bonds.

[[Protein disulfide isomerase]]s catalyze the proper formation of [[disulfide bond]]s; the cell transfers [[dehydroascorbic acid]] to the [[endoplasmic reticulum]], which oxidizes the environment.  In this environment, cysteines are, in general, oxidized to cystine and are no longer functional as a nucleophiles.

Aside from its oxidation to cystine, cysteine participates in numerous [[post-translational modification]]s.  The [[nucleophilic]] sulfhydryl group allows cysteine to conjugate to other groups, e.g., in [[prenylation]]. [[Ubiquitin]] [[ligase]]s transfer ubiquitin to its pendant, proteins, and [[caspase]]s, which engage in proteolysis in the apoptotic cycle.  [[Intein]]s often function with the help of a catalytic cysteine.  These roles are typically limited to the intracellular milieu, where the environment is reducing, and cysteine is not oxidized to cystine.

==Applications==
Cysteine, mainly the &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-[[enantiomer]], is a [[precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] in the food, pharmaceutical and personal-care industries. One of the largest applications is the production of flavors. For example, the reaction of cysteine with sugars in a [[Maillard reaction]] yields meat flavors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Tzou-Chi |last1=Huang |first2=Chi-Tang |last2=Ho |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=651Zv5hUzyIC&amp;pg=PA71 |pages=71–102 |editor1-first=Y. H. |editor1-last=Hui |editor2-first=Wai-Kit |editor2-last=Nip |editor3-first=Robert |editor3-last=Rogers |title=Meat Science and Applications, ch. Flavors of Meat Products|publisher=CRC |isbn=978-0-203-90808-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-Cysteine is also used as a [[improving agent|processing aid]] for baking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/foodic.html |title=Food Ingredients and Colors |date=November 2004 |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=2009-09-06 |postscript={{inconsistent citations}} |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512090657/https://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/foodic.html |archivedate=2009-05-12 |df= }}. {{Dead link|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of personal care, cysteine is used for [[permanent wave|permanent-wave]] applications, predominantly in Asia. Again, the cysteine is used for breaking up the disulfide bonds in the [[hair]]'s [[keratin]].

Cysteine is a very popular target for site-directed labeling experiments to investigate biomolecular structure and dynamics. [[Maleimide]]s selectively attach to cysteine using a covalent [[Michael addition]].  [[Site-directed spin labeling]] for EPR or paramagnetic relaxation-enhanced NMR also uses cysteine extensively.

===Reducing toxic effects of alcohol===
Cysteine has been proposed as a preventive or antidote for some of the negative effects of alcohol, including liver damage and [[hangover]]. It counteracts the poisonous effects of [[acetaldehyde]]. Cysteine supports the next step in metabolism, which turns acetaldehyde into the relatively harmless [[acetic acid]].  In a [[rat]] study, test animals received an {{LD50}} dose of acetaldehyde. Those that received cysteine had an 80% survival rate; when both cysteine and [[thiamine]] were administered, all animals survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sprince H, Parker CM, Smith GG, Gonzales LJ |title=Protection against acetaldehyde toxicity in the rat by L-cysteine, thiamin and L-2-methylthiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid |journal=Agents Actions |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=125–30 |date=April 1974 |pmid=4842541 |doi=10.1007/BF01966822}}&lt;/ref&gt; No direct evidence indicates its effectiveness in humans who consume alcohol at low levels.

===''N''-Acetylcysteine===
[[N-Acetylcysteine|''N''-Acetyl-&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-cysteine]] is a derivative of cysteine wherein an [[acetyl group]] is attached to the nitrogen atom.  This compound is sold as a dietary supplement, and used as an [[antidote]] in cases of [[acetaminophen]] overdose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kanter MZ |title=Comparison of oral and i.v. acetylcysteine in the treatment of acetaminophen poisoning |journal=Am J Health Syst Pharm |volume=63 |issue=19 |pages=1821–7 |date=October 2006 |pmid=16990628 |doi=10.2146/ajhp060050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sheep==
Cysteine is required by [[sheep]] to produce wool. It is an essential amino acid that must be taken in from their feed.  As a consequence, during drought conditions, sheep produce less wool; however, [[transgenic]] sheep that can make their own cysteine have been developed.&lt;ref name="Transgenic sheep"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Powell BC, Walker SK, Bawden CS, Sivaprasad AV, Rogers GE |title=Transgenic sheep and wool growth: possibilities and current status |journal=Reprod. Fertil. Dev. |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=615–23 |year=1994 |pmid=7569041 |doi=10.1071/RD9940615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dietary restrictions==
The animal-originating sources of L-cysteine as a food additive are a point of contention for people following dietary restrictions such as kosher, halal, vegan or vegetarian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kosher View of L-Cysteine|date=May 2003|publisher=kashrut.com|url=http://www.kashrut.com/articles/L_cysteine/}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid this problem, L-cysteine can also be sourced from microbial or other synthetic processes.

A '''diplomatic gift''' is a [[gift]] given by a [[diplomat]], politician or leader when visiting a foreign country. Usually the gift is reciprocated by the host. The use of diplomatic gifts dates back to the ancient world and givers have competed to outdo each other in the lavishness of their gifts. Examples include silks given to the West by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] in the [[early Middle Ages]],&lt;ref name=Muth&gt;"Silken diplomacy" by Anna Muthesius in Shepard J. &amp; Franklin, Simon. (Eds.) (1992) ''Byzantine Diplomacy: Papers from the Twenty-fourth Spring Symposium of Byzantine Studies, Cambridge, March 1990.'' Aldershot: Variorum, pp. 236-248. {{ISBN|0860783383}}&lt;/ref&gt; the luxury book,&lt;ref name=Low&gt;"The luxury book as diplomatic gift" by John Lowden in Shepard J. &amp; Franklin, Simon. (Eds.) (1992) ''Byzantine Diplomacy: Papers from the Twenty-fourth Spring Symposium of Byzantine Studies, Cambridge, March 1990.'' Aldershot: Variorum, pp. 249-260.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[panda diplomacy]] by the Chinese in the twentieth century.

==The Middle Ages==
In 757 [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperor [[Constantine V]] gave [[Pippin III|Pippin III of Francia]] a mechanical organ intended to indicate the superiority of [[Byzantine technology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Wickham|Wickham, Chris]].

==Nineteenth century==
After the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814–15), [[Rundell and Bridge|Rundell, Bridge, and Rundell]], goldsmiths to the British royal family and government, prepared 22 [[Snuff box|snuff-boxes]] to a value of 1000 [[Guinea (coin)|guineas]] each to be given as diplomatic gifts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcia Pointon]], "Surrounded with brilliants: Miniature portraits in eighteenth century England", ''[[The Art Bulletin]]'', Vol. 83, No. 1, (March 2001), pp. 48-71.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Missteps==
Diplomatic gifts have the potential to seal international friendships, but also to be rebuffed, to seem mismatched, or to accidentally send the wrong message. Taiwan rejected the People's Republic of China's offer of a Panda&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/taiwan/1513878/Were-not-wild-about-your-pandas-China-told.html We're not wild about your pandas, China told] by Richard Spencer, ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', 24 March 2006. Retrieved 17 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and the gifts given by British Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] to President Obama in 2009 were widely seen as more thoughtful than those given by Obama to Brown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1159627/To-special-friend-Gordon-25-DVDs-Obama-gives-Brown-set-classic-movies-Lets-hope-likes-Wizard-Oz.html To my special friend Gordon, 25 DVDs: Obama gives Brown a set of classic movies. Let's hope he likes the Wizard of Oz] by Ian Drury, ''[[The Daily Mail|Mail Online]]'', 6 March 2009. Retrieved 17 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 gift of a "British" table tennis table to President Obama seemed ideal until it was revealed that it was designed in Britain but made in China, evoking worries about the decline of British manufacturing industry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/9151444/David-Camerons-table-tennis-table-gift-to-Barack-Obama-made-in-China.html David Cameron's table tennis table gift to Barack Obama made in China] by James Orr, ''The Telegraph'', 18 March 2012.

{{UStaxation}}
The '''FairTax''' is a proposal to [[tax reform|reform]] the federal tax code of the United States.  It would replace all [[Income tax in the United States|federal income taxes]] (including the [[alternative minimum tax]], [[corporate tax in the United States|corporate income taxes]], and [[Capital gains tax in the United States|capital gains taxes]]), [[payroll tax#United States|payroll taxes]] (including [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax|Social Security and Medicare taxes]]), [[gift tax]]es, and [[Estate tax in the United States|estate taxes]] with a single broad national [[consumption tax]] on retail sales. The ''Fair Tax Act'' ({{USBill|115|HR|25}}/{{USBill|115|S|18}}) would apply a tax, once, at the point of purchase on all new [[Good (economics)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]] for personal consumption. The proposal also calls for a monthly payment to all [[family]] [[household]]s of lawful U.S. residents as an advance rebate, or "prebate", of tax on purchases up to the poverty level.&lt;ref name="billc3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kotlikoff"&gt;[[#refKotlikoff2005|Kotlikoff, 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;  First introduced into the [[United States Congress]] in 1999, a number of congressional committees have heard testimony on the [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]]; however, it has not moved from committee and has yet to have any effect on the tax system.  In recent years, a tax reform movement has formed behind the FairTax proposal.&lt;ref name="movement"&gt;[[#refLinbeck2005|Linbeck statement, 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Attention increased after [[talk radio]] personality [[Neal Boortz]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] Congressman [[John Linder]] published ''[[The FairTax Book]]'' in 2005 and additional visibility was gained in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential campaign]].

As defined in the proposed legislation, the tax rate is 23% for the first year.  This percentage is based on the total amount paid including the tax ($23 out of every $100 spent in total). This would be equivalent to a 30% traditional [[Sales taxes in the United States|U.S. sales tax]] ($23 on top of every $77 spent—$100 total).&lt;ref name="money"&gt;[[#refRegnier2005|Regnier, 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; The rate would automatically adjust annually based on federal receipts in the previous fiscal year.&lt;ref name="billc1"&gt;[[#refFairTaxAct|Fair Tax Act, 2009, Chapter 1]]&lt;/ref&gt; With the rebate taken into consideration, the FairTax would be [[progressive tax|progressive]] on [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]],&lt;ref name="Kotlikoff"/&gt; but would also be [[regressive tax|regressive]] on [[income]] at higher income levels (as consumption falls as a percentage of income).&lt;ref name="wgale"&gt;[[#refGale1998|Gale, 1998]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BHItaxburden"/&gt;  Opponents argue this would accordingly decrease the [[Tax incidence|tax burden]] on [[American upper class|high-income earners]] and increase it on the [[American middle class|middle class]].&lt;ref name="money"/&gt;&lt;ref name="finalreport"&gt;[[#refTaxReformCh9|Tax Reform Panel Report, Ch. 9]]&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters contend that the plan would effectively tax [[wealth]], increase [[purchasing power]]&lt;ref name="comparerates"&gt;[[#refKotlikoff2006|Kotlikoff and Rapson, 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dynamiceffects"&gt;[[#refKotlikoff2007|Kotlikoff and Jokisch, 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt; and decrease tax burdens by broadening the tax base.

The plan's supporters state that a consumption tax would increase [[Saving (money)|savings]] and [[investment]], ease [[compliance cost|tax compliance]] and increase [[economic growth]], increase incentives for [[international business]] to locate in the US and increase US competitiveness in [[international trade]].&lt;ref name="fairtaxbook"&gt;[[#refFairTaxBook|The FairTax Book]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="endorsement"&gt;[[#refOpenLetter|Open Letter to the President]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="consumptiontax"&gt;[[#refAuerbach2005|Auerbach, 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The plan is intended to increase cost transparency for funding the federal government. Supporters believe it would increase [[Civil liberties of the United States|civil liberties]], benefit the [[Natural environment|environment]] and effectively tax [[Crime|illegal activity]] and [[Illegal immigration to the United States|undocumented immigrants]].&lt;ref name="fairtaxbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sipos"&gt;[[#refSipos2007|Sipos, 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents contend that a consumption tax of this size would be extremely difficult to collect, and would lead to pervasive [[tax evasion]].&lt;ref name="money" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wgale" /&gt; They also argue that the proposed sales tax rate would raise less revenue than the current tax system, leading to an increased [[budget deficit]].&lt;ref name="money" /&gt;&lt;ref name="taxnotes"&gt;[[#refGale2005|Gale, 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; Other concerns include the proposed repeal of the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]], removal of [[tax deduction]] incentives, transition effects on after-tax savings, incentives on credit use and the loss of tax advantages to [[municipal bond|state and local bonds]].

==Legislative overview and history==
[[File:U.S. Rep. John Linder with the 2007 Tax code and complete set of Title 26 of the US Code of Federal Regulations.jpg|thumb|Rep [[John Linder]] holding the 133 page ''Fair Tax Act of 2007'' in contrast to the then-current U.S. [[Internal Revenue Code|tax code]] and [[Treasury regulations|IRS regulations]].]]
The legislation would remove the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (after three years), and establish Excise Tax and Sales Tax bureaus in the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]].&lt;ref name="billtIII"/&gt;  The [[U.S. state|states]] are granted the primary authority for the collection of sales tax revenues and the remittance of such revenues to the Treasury.  The plan was created by [[Americans For Fair Taxation]], an [[advocacy group]] formed to change the tax system. The group states that, together with economists, it developed the plan and the name "Fair Tax", based on interviews, polls, and focus groups of the general public.&lt;ref name="money"/&gt; The FairTax legislation has been introduced in the House by Georgia [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] [[John Linder]] (1999–2010) and [[Rob Woodall]] (2011–2014),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://woodall.house.gov/issue/fairtax |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205000339/http://woodall.house.gov/issue/fairtax |archivedate=2015-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while being introduced in the Senate by Georgia Republican [[Saxby Chambliss]] (2003–2014).

Linder first introduced the ''Fair Tax Act'' ({{USBill|106|HR|2525}}) on July 14, 1999, to the [[106th United States Congress]] and a substantially similar bill has been reintroduced in each subsequent session of Congress. The bill attracted a total of 56 House and Senate cosponsors in the [[108th Congress]],&lt;ref name="hrcosponsors2003"&gt;[[#refhr108|H.R.25 108th Cosponsors]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scosponsors2003"&gt;[[#refs108|S.1493 108th Cosponsors]]&lt;/ref&gt; 61 in the [[109th United States Congress|109th]],&lt;ref name="hrcosponsors"&gt;[[#refhr109|H.R.25 109th Cosponsors]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scosponsors"&gt;[[#refs109|S.25 109th Cosponsors]]&lt;/ref&gt; 76 in the [[110th United States Congress|110th]],&lt;ref name="hrcosponsors2007"&gt;[[#refhr110|H.R.25 110th Cosponsors]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="s1025cosponsors2007"&gt;[[#refs110|S.1025 110th Cosponsors]]&lt;/ref&gt; 70 in the [[111th United States Congress|111th]],&lt;ref name="hrcosponsors2009"&gt;[[#refhr111|H.R.25 111th Cosponsors]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scosponsors2009"&gt;[[#refs111|S.296 111th Cosponsors]]&lt;/ref&gt; 78 in the [[112th United States Congress|112th]],&lt;ref name="hrcosponsors2011"&gt;[[#refhr112|H.R.25 112th Cosponsors]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scosponsors2011"&gt;[[#refs112|S.13 112th Cosponsors]]&lt;/ref&gt; 83 in the [[113th United States Congress|113th]] ({{USBill|113|HR|25}}/{{USBill|113|S|122}}), 81 in the [[114th United States Congress|114th]] ({{USBill|114|HR|25}}/{{USBill|114|S|155}}), and 46 in the [[115th United States Congress|115th]] ({{USBill|115|HR|25}}/{{USBill|115|S|18}}).  Former [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Dennis Hastert]] (Republican) had cosponsored the bill in the 109th–110th Congress, but it has not received support from the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] leadership.&lt;ref name="scosponsors"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hrcosponsors2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="support"&gt;[[#refBender2005|Bender, 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; Democratic Representative [[Collin Peterson]] of Minnesota and Democratic Senator [[Zell Miller]] of Georgia cosponsored and introduced the bill in the 108th Congress, but Peterson is no longer cosponsoring the bill and Miller has left the Senate.&lt;ref name="hrcosponsors2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scosponsors2003"/&gt; In the 109th–111th Congress, Representative [[Dan Boren]] has been the only Democrat to cosponsor the bill.&lt;ref name="hrcosponsors"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hrcosponsors2007"/&gt;  A number of congressional committees have heard testimony on the FairTax, but it has not moved from committee since its introduction in 1999.  The legislation was also discussed with President [[George W. Bush]] and his [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Henry M. Paulson]].&lt;ref name="thetruth"/&gt;

To become law, the bill will need to be included in a final version of tax legislation from the [[U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means]], pass both the House and the Senate, and finally be signed by the [[President of the United States|President]].   In 2005, President Bush established an [[President's Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform|advisory panel on tax reform]] that examined several national sales tax variants including aspects of the FairTax and noted several concerns. These included uncertainties as to the revenue that would be generated, and difficulties of enforcement and administration, which made this type of tax undesirable to recommend in their final report.&lt;ref name="finalreport" /&gt;  The panel did not examine the FairTax as proposed in the legislation. The FairTax received visibility in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]] on the issue of taxes and the IRS, with several candidates supporting the bill.&lt;ref name="2008election"&gt;[[#refDavis2007|Davis, 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMcCain2007|CBS News, 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt; A poll in 2009 by [[Rasmussen Reports]] found that 43% of Americans would support a national sales tax replacement, with 38% opposed to the idea; the sales tax was viewed as fairer by 52% of Republicans, 44% of Democrats, and 49% of unaffiliateds.&lt;ref name="rasmussen"&gt;[[#refRasmussen|Rasmussen Reports, 2009]]&lt;/ref&gt;  President [[Barack Obama]] did not support the bill,&lt;ref name="Obama"&gt;[[#refObama2008|Obama, 2008]]&lt;/ref&gt; arguing for more [[Barack Obama economic policy#Taxation|progressive changes]] to the income and payroll tax systems.  President [[Donald Trump]] has [[Economic policy of Donald Trump#Taxation|proposed]] to lower overall income taxation and reduce the number of [[tax brackets]] from seven to three.

==Tax rate==
The sales tax rate, as defined in the legislation for the first year, is 23% of the total payment including the tax ($23 of every $100 spent in total—calculated similar to income taxes). This would be equivalent to a 30% traditional U.S. sales tax ($23 on top of every $77 spent—$100 total, or $30 on top of every $100 spent—$130 total).&lt;ref name="money"/&gt; After the first year of implementation, this rate is automatically adjusted annually using a predefined formula reflecting actual federal receipts in the previous fiscal year.

The [[effective tax rate]] for any household would be variable due to the fixed monthly tax rebate that are used to rebate taxes paid on purchases up to the poverty level.&lt;ref name="Kotlikoff"/&gt; The tax would be levied on all U.S. retail sales for personal consumption on new [[Good (economics)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]]. Critics argue that the sales tax rate defined in the legislation would not be revenue neutral (that is, it would collect less for the government than the current tax system), and thus would increase the [[budget deficit]], unless government spending were equally reduced.&lt;ref name="money"/&gt;

===Sales tax rate===
During the first year of implementation, the FairTax legislation would apply a 23% federal [[Retailing|retail]] sales tax on the total transaction value of a purchase; in other words, consumers pay to the government 23 cents of every dollar spent in total (sometimes called ''[[tax-inclusive]]'', and presented this way to provide a direct comparison with individual income and employment taxes which reduce a person's available money ''before'' they can make purchases). The equivalent assessed tax rate is 30% if the FairTax is applied to the pre-tax price of a good like traditional [[Sales taxes in the United States|U.S. state sales taxes]] (sometimes called ''[[tax-exclusive]]''; this rate is not directly comparable with existing income and employment taxes).&lt;ref name="money"/&gt;  After the first year of implementation, this tax rate would be automatically adjusted annually using a formula specified in the legislation that reflects actual federal receipts in the previous fiscal year.&lt;ref name="billc1"/&gt;

===Effective tax rate===
{{details|Distribution of the FairTax burden}}
A household's [[effective tax rate]] on consumption would vary with the annual expenditures on taxable items and the fixed monthly tax rebate. The rebate would have the greatest effect at low spending levels, where they could lower a household's effective rate to zero or below.&lt;ref name="comparerates"/&gt; The lowest effective tax rate under the FairTax could be negative due to the rebate for households with annual spending amounts below [[Poverty in the United States#Measures of poverty|poverty level spending]] for a specified household size. At higher spending levels, the rebate has less impact, and a household's effective tax rate would approach 23% of total spending.&lt;ref name="comparerates"/&gt; A person spending at the poverty level would have an effective tax rate of 0%, whereas someone spending at four times the poverty level would have an effective tax rate of 17.2%. Buying or otherwise receiving items and services not subject to federal taxation (such as a used home or car) can contribute towards a lower effective tax rate. The total amount of spending and the proportion of spending allocated to taxable items would determine a household's effective tax rate on consumption.  If a rate is calculated on income, instead of the tax base, the percentage could exceed the statutory tax rate in a given year.

Under the FairTax, [[family]] [[household]]s of lawful U.S. residents  would be eligible to receive a "Family Consumption Allowance" (FCA) based on family size (regardless of income) that is equal to the estimated total FairTax paid on [[poverty]] level spending according to the [[Poverty in the United States#Measures of poverty|poverty guidelines]] published by the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]].&lt;ref name="billc3"&gt;[[#refFairTaxAct|Fair Tax Act, 2009, Chapter 3]]&lt;/ref&gt; The FCA is a tax rebate (known as a "prebate" as it would be an advance) paid in twelve monthly installments, adjusted for [[inflation]]. The rebate is meant to eliminate the taxation of household necessities and make the plan [[Progressive tax|progressive]].&lt;ref name="money" /&gt; Households would register once a year with their sales tax administering authority, providing the names and social security numbers of each household member.&lt;ref name="billc3" /&gt; The [[Social Security Administration]] would disburse the monthly rebate payments in the form of a paper check via U.S. Mail, an [[electronic funds transfer]] to a bank account, or a "smartcard" that can be used like a [[debit card]].&lt;ref name="billc3" /&gt;

Opponents of the plan criticize this tax rebate due to its costs. Economists at the [[Beacon Hill Institute]] estimated the overall rebate cost to be $489 billion (assuming 100% participation).&lt;ref name="taxpanelrebuttal"&gt;[[#refRebuttal2006|Rebuttal to Tax Panel Report, 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, economist [[Bruce Bartlett]] has argued that the rebate would create a large opportunity for [[fraud]],&lt;ref name="TFBarlett"&gt;[[#refBartlett2007|Bartlett, 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt; treats children disparately, and would constitute a [[Social welfare provision|welfare]] payment regardless of need.&lt;ref name="Bartletttaxnotes"&gt;[[#refBartlettTaxNotes|Bartlett, 2007, Tax Notes]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[President's Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform]] cited the rebate as one of their chief concerns when analyzing their national sales tax, stating that it would be the largest [[entitlement program]] in American history, and contending that it would "make most American families dependent on monthly checks from the federal government".&lt;ref name="finalreport"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yin"&gt;[[#refYin|Yin, 2006, Fla. L. Rev.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Estimated by the advisory panel at approximately $600 billion, "the Prebate program would cost more than all budgeted spending in 2006 on the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, and Interior combined."&lt;ref name="finalreport"/&gt; Proponents point out that income [[tax deduction]]s, tax preferences, [[tax avoidance|loopholes]], [[tax credit|credits]], etc. under the current system was estimated at $945 billion by the [[United States Congress Joint Committee on Taxation|Joint Committee on Taxation]].&lt;ref name="taxpanelrebuttal"/&gt; They argue this is $456 billion more than the FairTax "entitlement" (tax refund) would spend to cover each person's tax expenses up to the poverty level. In addition, it was estimated for 2005 that the Internal Revenue Service was already sending out $270 billion in refund checks.&lt;ref name="taxpanelrebuttal"/&gt;

===Presentation of tax rate===
[[File:FairTax Rate Presentation.png|thumb|left|Mathematically, a 23% tax out of $100 yields approximately the same as a 30% tax on $77.|180px]]
Sales and income taxes behave differently due to differing definitions of tax base, which can make comparisons between the two confusing. Under the existing individual income plus employment (Social Security; Medicare; Medicaid) tax formula, taxes to be paid are included in the base on which the tax rate is imposed (known as ''[[tax-inclusive]]''). If an individual's gross income is $100 and the sum of their income plus employment tax rate is 23%, taxes owed equals $23. Traditional state sales taxes are imposed on a tax base equal to the pre-tax portion of a good's price (known as ''[[tax-exclusive]]''). A good priced at $77 with a 30% sales tax rate yields $23 in taxes owed.  To adjust an inclusive rate to an exclusive rate, divide the given rate by one minus that rate (i.e. &lt;math&gt;0.23/(1 - 0.23) = 0.23/0.77 = 0.30&lt;/math&gt;).

The FairTax [[statutory rate]], unlike most U.S. [[Sales taxes in the United States|state-level sales taxes]], is presented on a tax base that includes the amount of FairTax paid. For example, a final after-tax price of $100 includes $23 of taxes. Although no such requirement is included in the text of the legislation, Congressman John Linder has stated that the FairTax would be implemented as an inclusive tax, which would include the tax in the retail price, not added on at checkout—an item on the shelf for five dollars would be five dollars total.&lt;ref name="thetruth"&gt;[[#refBoortz2008|Boortz and Linder, 2008]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="americansolutions"&gt;[[#refLinder2007|Linder and Boortz, 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation requires the receipt to display the tax as 23% of the total.&lt;ref name="billc5"/&gt; Linder states the FairTax is presented as a 23% tax rate for easy comparison to income and employment tax rates (the taxes it would be replacing). The plan's opponents call the [[semantics]] deceptive. [[FactCheck]] called the presentation misleading, saying that it hides the real truth of the tax rate.&lt;ref name="FactCheck"&gt;[[#refMiller2007|Miller, 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bruce Bartlett]] stated that polls show tax reform support is extremely sensitive to the proposed rate,&lt;ref name="Bartletttaxnotes"/&gt; and called the presentation confusing and deceptive based on the conventional method of calculating sales taxes.&lt;ref name="BartlettWSJ"&gt;[[#refBartlettWSJ|Bartlett, 2007, Wall Street Journal]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Proponents believe it is both inaccurate and misleading to say that an income tax is 23% and the FairTax is 30% as it implies that the sales tax burden is higher.

===Revenue neutrality===
{{Main|Revenue neutrality of the FairTax}}
A key question surrounding the FairTax is whether the tax has the ability to be revenue-neutral; that is, whether the tax would result in an increase or reduction in overall federal tax revenues. Economists, advisory groups, and political advocacy groups disagree about the tax rate required for the FairTax to be truly revenue-neutral. Various analysts use different assumptions, time-frames, and methods resulting in dramatically different [[tax rates]] making direct comparison among the studies difficult. The choice between [[Static analysis|static]] or [[dynamic scoring]] further complicates any estimate of revenue-neutral rates.&lt;ref name="scoring"&gt;[[#refGingrich2005|Gingrich and Ferrara, 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 study published in ''[[Tax Notes]]'' by the [[Beacon Hill Institute]] at Suffolk University and Dr. [[Laurence Kotlikoff]]  estimated the FairTax would be revenue-neutral for the tax year 2007 at a rate of 23.82% (31.27% tax-exclusive).&lt;ref name="beaconhill"&gt;[[#refBachman2006|Bachman et al., 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; The study states that [[purchasing power]] is transferred to state and local taxpayers from state and local governments. To recapture the lost revenue, state and local governments would have to raise tax rates or otherwise change tax laws in order to continue collecting the same [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|real revenues]] from their taxpayers.&lt;ref name="Yin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="beaconhill"/&gt; The [[Argus Group]] and [[Arduin, Laffer &amp; Moore Econometrics]] each published an analysis that defended the 23% rate.&lt;ref name="galerebuttal"&gt;[[#refBurton1998|Burton and Mastromarco, 1998]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jctrebuttal"&gt;[[#refBurton1998JCT|Burton and Mastromarco, 1998a]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ALME"&gt;[[#refALME2006|Arduin, Laffer &amp; Moore Econometrics, 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; While proponents of the FairTax concede that the above studies did not explicitly account for [[tax evasion]], they also claim that the studies did not altogether ignore tax evasion under the FairTax. These studies presumably incorporated some degree of tax evasion in their calculations by using [[National Income and Product Accounts|National Income and Product Account]] based figures, which is argued to understate total household consumption.&lt;ref name="beaconhill"/&gt; The studies also did not account for capital gains that may be realized by the U.S. government if consumer prices were allowed to rise, which would reduce the real value of nominal [[U.S. government debt]].&lt;ref name="beaconhill"/&gt;  Nor did these studies account for any increased [[economic growth]] that many economists researching the plan believe would occur.&lt;ref name="beaconhill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ALME"/&gt;&lt;ref name="simulating"&gt;[[#refAltig2001|Altig et al., 2001]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BHIeconomic"/&gt;

In contrast to the above studies, [[William G. Gale]] of the [[Brookings Institution]] published a study in ''Tax Notes'' that estimated a rate of 28.2% (39.3% tax-exclusive) for 2007 assuming full taxpayer compliance and an average rate of 31% (44% tax-exclusive) from 2006 to 2015 (assumes that the [[Bush tax cuts]] expire on schedule and accounts for the replacement of an additional $3 trillion collected through the [[Alternative Minimum Tax]]).&lt;ref name="money"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taxnotes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CBO"&gt;[[#refEsenwein2005|Esenwein, 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; The study also concluded that if the tax base were eroded by 10% due to tax evasion, tax avoidance, and/or legislative adjustments, the average rate would be 34% (53% tax-exclusive) for the 10-year period.  A dynamic analysis in 2008 by the [[Baker Institute For Public Policy]] concluded that a 28% (38.9% tax-exclusive) rate would be revenue neutral for 2006.&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;[[#refDiamond2008|Diamond and Zodrow, 2008]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[President's Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform]] performed a 2006 analysis to replace the individual and corporate [[Income tax in the United States|income tax]] with a retail sales tax and estimated the rate to be 25% (34% tax-exclusive) assuming 15% tax evasion, and 33% (49% tax-exclusive) with 30% tax evasion.&lt;ref name="finalreport"/&gt; The rate would need to be substantially higher to replace the additional taxes replaced by the FairTax (payroll, estate, and gift taxes). Several economists criticized the President's Advisory Panel's study as having allegedly altered the terms of the FairTax, using unsound methodology, and/or failing to fully explain their calculations.&lt;ref name="taxpanelrebuttal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="beaconhill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KotlikoffBartlett"&gt;[[#refKotlikoff2008|Kotlikoff, 2008]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxable items and exemptions==
The tax would be levied once at the final retail sale for personal consumption on new goods and services.  Purchases of used items, [[export]]s and [[business-to-business|all business]] transactions would not be taxed. Also excluded are investments, such as purchases of [[stock]], corporate [[mergers and acquisitions]] and [[capital investments]]. [[Saving (economics)|Savings]] and [[Tuition|education tuition]] expenses would be exempt as they would be considered an investment (rather than final consumption).&lt;ref name="billtext"&gt;[[#refFairTaxAct|Fair Tax Act, 2009]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A good would be considered "used" and not taxable if a consumer already owns it before the FairTax takes effect or if the FairTax has been paid previously on the good, which may be different from the item being sold previously. Personal services such as [[health care]], legal services, [[financial services]], and auto repairs would be subject to the FairTax, as would renting apartments and other [[real property]].&lt;ref name="money"/&gt;  Food, clothing, prescription drugs and medical services would be taxed. ([[U.S. state|State]] sales taxes generally exempt these types of basic-need items in an effort to reduce the tax burden on low-income families. The FairTax would use a monthly rebate system instead of the common state exclusions.) [[Internet]] purchases would be taxed, as would retail international purchases (such as a boat or car) that are imported to the United States (collected by the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]]).&lt;ref name="billtext"/&gt;

==Distribution of tax burden==
{{Main|Distribution of the FairTax burden}}
[[File:FairTax married.png|thumb|[[Boston University]] study of the FairTax. Lower rates claimed on workers from a larger tax base, replacing regressive taxes, and wealth taxation.]]
[[File:NRST-percentile.png|thumb|[[President's Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform|President's Advisory Panel's]] analysis of a hybrid National Sales Tax. Higher rates claimed on the middle-class for an income tax replacement (excludes payroll, estate, and gift taxes replaced under the FairTax).]]

The FairTax's effect on the distribution of taxation or [[tax incidence]] (the effect on the distribution of [[Welfare economics|economic welfare]]) is a point of dispute. The plan's supporters argue that the tax would broaden the tax base, that it would be [[progressive tax|progressive]], and that it would decrease tax burdens and start taxing wealth (reducing the [[economic inequality|economic gap]]).&lt;ref name="comparerates"/&gt; Opponents argue that a national sales tax would be inherently [[regressive tax|regressive]] and would decrease tax burdens paid by high-income individuals.&lt;ref name="money"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taranto"/&gt; A person earning $2 million a year could live well spending $1 million, and as a result pay a mere 11% of that year's income in taxes.&lt;ref name="money"/&gt; Households at the lower end of the income scale spend almost all their income, while households at the higher end are more likely to devote a portion of income to saving.  Therefore, according to economist [[William G. Gale]], the percentage of [[income]] taxed is regressive at higher income levels (as consumption falls as a percentage of income).&lt;ref name="wgale"/&gt;

Income earned and saved would not be taxed until spent under the proposal.  Households at the extreme high end of consumption often finance their purchases out of savings, not income.&lt;ref name="wgale" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bartletttaxnotes"/&gt; Economist [[Laurence Kotlikoff]] states that the FairTax could make the tax system much more progressive and generationally equitable,&lt;ref name="Kotlikoff" /&gt; and argues that taxing consumption is effectively the same as taxing [[wages]] plus taxing [[wealth]].&lt;ref name="Kotlikoff" /&gt;  A household of three persons (this example will use two adults plus one child; the rebate does not consider marital status) spending $30,000 a year on taxable items would devote about 3.4% of total spending ([$6,900 tax minus $5,888 rebate]/$30,000 spending) to the FairTax after the rebate. The same household spending $125,000 on taxable items would spend around 18.3% ([$28,750 tax minus $5,888 rebate]/$125,000 spending) on the FairTax.  At higher spending levels, the rebate has less impact and the rate approaches 23% of total spending.  Thus, according to economist [[Laurence Kotlikoff]], the effective tax rate is progressive on [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]].&lt;ref name="Kotlikoff" /&gt;

Studies by Kotlikoff and David Rapson state that the FairTax would significantly reduce marginal taxes on work and saving, lowering overall average remaining lifetime tax burdens on current and future workers.&lt;ref name="comparerates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kotlikoff2"&gt;[[#refKotlikoffRapson2006|Kotlikoff and Rapson, 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt;  A study by Kotlikoff and Sabine Jokisch concluded that the long-term effects of the FairTax would reward low-income households with 26.3% more [[purchasing power]], middle-income households with 12.4% more purchasing power, and high-income households with 5% more purchasing power.&lt;ref name="dynamiceffects"/&gt;  The [[Beacon Hill Institute]] reported that the FairTax would make the federal tax system more progressive and would benefit the average individual in almost all expenditures deciles.&lt;ref name="BHItaxburden"&gt;[[#refTuerk2007|Tuerk et al., 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt;  In another study, they state the FairTax would offer the broadest tax base (an increase of over $2 trillion), which allows the FairTax to have a lower tax rate than current tax law.&lt;ref name="TaxComparisonChart"&gt;[[#refTuerk2007Chart|Tuerk et al., 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gale analyzed a national sales tax (though different from the FairTax in several aspects&lt;ref name="BHItaxburden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="galerebuttal"/&gt;) and reported that the overall tax burden on middle-income Americans would increase while the tax burden on the top 1% would drop.&lt;ref name="wgale"/&gt; A study by the Beacon Hill Institute reported that the FairTax may have a negative effect on the well-being of mid-income earners for several years after implementation.&lt;ref name="BHIeconomic" /&gt; According to the [[President's Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform]] report, which compared the individual and corporate income tax (excluding other taxes the FairTax replaces) to a sales tax with rebate,&lt;ref name="finalreport"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taxpanelrebuttal"/&gt; the percentage of federal taxes paid by those earning from $15,000–$50,000 would rise from 3.6% to 6.7%, while the burden on those earning more than $200,000 would fall from 53.5% to 45.9%.&lt;ref name="finalreport" /&gt;  The report states that the top 5% of earners would see their burden decrease from 58.6% to 37.4%.&lt;ref name="finalreport" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bakerreview"&gt;[[#refZodrow2006|Zodrow and McClure, 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; FairTax supporters argue that replacing the regressive [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax|payroll tax]] (a 15.3% total tax not included in the Tax Panel study;&lt;ref name="finalreport"/&gt; payroll taxes include a 12.4% [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] tax on wages up to $97,500 and a 2.9% [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] tax, a 15.3% total tax that is often split between employee and employer) greatly changes the tax distribution, and that the FairTax would relieve the tax burden on middle-class workers.&lt;ref name="Kotlikoff"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KotlikoffBartlett"/&gt;

==Predicted effects==
{{Main|Predicted effects of the FairTax}}

The predicted effects of the FairTax are a source of disagreement among economists and other analysts.&lt;ref name="FactCheck"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BartlettWSJ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taranto"&gt;[[#refTaranto2007|Taranto, 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Money (magazine)|Money]]'' magazine, while many economists and tax experts support the idea of a [[consumption tax]], many of them view the FairTax proposal as having serious problems with evasion and revenue neutrality.&lt;ref name="money"/&gt; Some economists argue that a consumption tax (the FairTax is one such tax) would have a positive effect on [[economic growth]], incentives for international business to locate in the U.S., and increased U.S. international competitiveness (border tax adjustment in [[International trade|global trade]]).&lt;ref name="fairtaxbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="endorsement"/&gt;&lt;ref name="consumptiontax" /&gt; The FairTax would be tax-free on mortgage interest (up to a basic interest rate) and donations, but some lawmakers have concerns about losing tax incentives on [[home ownership]] and charitable contributions.&lt;ref name="Giuliani"&gt;[[#refGiuliani|Giuliani, 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt; There is also concern about the effect on the income tax industry and the difficulty of repealing the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]] (to prevent Congress from re-introducing an income tax).&lt;ref name="Vance2005b"&gt;[[#refVance2005b|Vance, 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic===
{{details|Predicted effects of the FairTax#Economic effects}}
Americans For Fair Taxation states the FairTax would boost the United States economy and offers a letter signed by eighty economists, including [[Nobel Prize in Economics|Nobel Laureate]] [[Vernon L. Smith]], that have endorsed the plan.&lt;ref name="endorsement" /&gt;  The [[Beacon Hill Institute]] estimated that within five years real GDP would increase 10.7% over the current system, domestic investment by 86.3%, capital stock by 9.3%, employment by 9.9%, [[real wage]]s by 10.2%, and consumption by 1.8%.&lt;ref name="BHIeconomic"&gt;[[#refTuerk2007Economic|Tuerk et al., 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Arduin, Laffer &amp; Moore Econometrics]] projected the economy as measured by GDP would be 2.4% higher in the first year and 11.3% higher by the 10th year than it would otherwise be.&lt;ref name="ALME" /&gt;  Economists [[Laurence Kotlikoff]] and Sabine Jokisch reported the incentive to work and save would increase; by 2030, the economy's [[capital stock]] would increase by 43.7% over the current system, output by 9.4%, and [[real wage]]s by 11.5%.&lt;ref name="dynamiceffects" /&gt; Economist John Golob estimates a consumption tax, like the FairTax, would bring long-term interest rates down by 25–35%.&lt;ref name="interestrate"&gt;[[#refGolob1995|Golob, 1995]]&lt;/ref&gt;  An analysis in 2008 by the [[Baker Institute For Public Policy]] indicated that the plan would generate significant overall [[macroeconomic]] improvement in both the short and long-term, but warned of transitional issues.&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt;

FairTax proponents argue that the proposal would provide tax burden visibility and reduce compliance and efficiency costs by 90%, returning a large share of money to the productive economy.&lt;ref name="Kotlikoff"/&gt; The Beacon Hill Institute concluded that the FairTax would save $346.51 billion in administrative costs and would be a much more efficient taxation system.&lt;ref name="BHItaxcosts"&gt;[[#refTuerk2007Costs|Tuerk et al., 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Reynolds Archer, Jr.|Bill Archer]], former head of the [[House Ways and Means Committee]], asked [[Princeton University]] Econometrics to survey 500 [[Europe]]an and [[Asia]]n companies regarding the effect on their business decisions if the United States enacted the FairTax. 400 of those companies stated they would build their next plant in the United States, and 100 companies said they would move their corporate headquarters to the United States.&lt;ref name="billarcher"&gt;[[#refGaver2006|Gaver, 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters argue that the U.S. has the highest combined statutory corporate income tax rate among [[OECD]] countries along with being the only country with no border adjustment element in its tax system.&lt;ref name="corptax"&gt;[[#refHodge2005|Hodge and Atkins, 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LeoTestimony"&gt;[[#refLinbeck2006a|Linbeck, 2006a]]&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents state that because the FairTax eliminates corporate income taxes and is automatically border adjustable, the competitive tax advantage of foreign producers would be eliminated, immediately boosting U.S. competitiveness overseas and at home.&lt;ref name="linbeck2007b"&gt;[[#reflinbeck2007b|Linbeck, 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents point to a study commissioned by the [[National Retail Federation]] in 2000 that found a national sales tax bill filed by [[Billy Tauzin]], the ''Individual Tax Freedom Act'' ({{USBill|107|HR|2717}}), would bring a three-year decline in the economy, a four-year decline in employment and an eight-year decline in consumer spending.&lt;ref name="NRFarticle"&gt;[[#refVargas2005|Vargas, 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' columnist [[James Taranto]] states the FairTax is unsuited to take advantage of [[supply-side]] effects and would create a powerful disincentive to spend money.&lt;ref name="Taranto"/&gt;   John Linder states an estimated $11 trillion is held in foreign accounts (largely for tax purposes), which he states would be repatriated back to U.S. banks if the FairTax were enacted, becoming available to U.S. [[capital market]]s, bringing down interest rates, and otherwise promoting economic growth in the United States.&lt;ref name="fairtaxbook"/&gt;  Attorney Allen Buckley states that a tremendous amount of wealth was already repatriated under law changes in 2004 and 2005.&lt;ref name="buckley"&gt;[[#refBuckley2008|Buckley, 2008]]&lt;/ref&gt; Buckley also argues that if the tax rate was significantly higher, the FairTax would discourage the consumption of new goods and hurt economic growth.&lt;ref name="buckley"/&gt;

===Transition===
{{details|Predicted effects of the FairTax#Transition effects}}
[[File:TaxbaseStability.png|thumb|Stability of the tax base: a comparison of [[personal consumption expenditure]]s and [[adjusted gross income]]]]

During the transition, many or most of the employees of the IRS (105,978 in 2005)&lt;ref name="irslabor"&gt;[[#refirslabor|IRS Labor Force, 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; would face loss of employment.&lt;ref name="beaconhill"/&gt; The Beacon Hill Institute estimate is that the federal government would be able to cut $8 billion from the IRS budget of $11.01 billion (in 2007), reducing the size of federal tax administration by 73%.&lt;ref name="beaconhill"/&gt; In addition, income tax preparers (many seasonal), tax lawyers, tax compliance staff in medium-to-large businesses, and software companies which sell tax preparation software could face significant drops, changes, or loss of employment. The bill would maintain the IRS for three years after implementation before completely decommissioning the agency, providing employees time to find other employment.&lt;ref name="billtIII"/&gt;

In the period before the FairTax is implemented, there could be a strong incentive for individuals to buy goods without the sales tax using credit. After the FairTax is in effect, the credit could be paid off using untaxed payroll. If credit incentives do not change, opponents of the FairTax worry it could exacerbate an existing consumer debt problem. Proponents of the FairTax state that this effect could also allow individuals to pay off their existing (pre-FairTax) debt more quickly,&lt;ref name="fairtaxbook" /&gt; and studies suggest lower interest rates after FairTax passage.&lt;ref name="interestrate" /&gt;

Individuals under the current system who accumulated savings from ordinary income (by choosing not to spend their money when the income was earned) paid taxes on that income before it was placed in savings (such as a [[Roth IRA]] or [[Certificate of deposit|CD]]). When individuals spend above the poverty level with money saved under the current system, that spending would be subject to the FairTax. People living through the transition may find both their earnings and their spending taxed.&lt;ref name="Taranto2"&gt;[[#refTaranto2007a|Taranto, 2007a]]&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have stated that the FairTax would result in unfair double taxation for savers and suggest it does not address the transition effect on some taxpayers who have accumulated significant savings from after-tax dollars, especially retirees who have finished their careers and switched to spending down their life savings.&lt;ref name="Yin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taranto2"/&gt; Supporters of the plan argue that the current system is no different, since compliance costs and "hidden taxes" embedded in the prices of goods and services cause savings to be "taxed" a second time already when spent.&lt;ref name="Taranto2"/&gt; The rebate would supplement accrued savings, covering taxes up to the poverty level. The income taxes on capital gains, estates, social security and pension benefits would be eliminated under FairTax. In addition, the FairTax legislation adjusts [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] benefits for changes in the price level, so a percentage increase in prices would result in an equal percentage increase to Social Security income.&lt;ref name="billtIII"&gt;[[#refFairTaxAct|Fair Tax Act, 2009, Title III]]&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters suggest these changes would offset paying the FairTax under transition conditions.&lt;ref name="fairtaxbook" /&gt;

===Other indirect effects===
{{details|Predicted effects of the FairTax#Other indirect effects}}
The FairTax would be tax free on mortgage interest up to the [[Federal funds rate|federal borrowing rate]] for like-term instruments as determined by the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury]],&lt;ref name="billc8"&gt;[[#refFairTaxAct|Fair Tax Act, 2009, Chapter 8]]&lt;/ref&gt; but since savings, education, and other investments would be tax free under the plan, the FairTax could decrease the incentive to spend more on homes.  An analysis in 2008 by the [[Baker Institute For Public Policy]] concluded that the FairTax would have significant transitional issues for the [[House|housing]] sector since the investment would no longer be [[Home mortgage interest deduction|tax-favored]].&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt; In a 2007 study, the Beacon Hill Institute concluded that total charitable giving would increase under the FairTax, although increases in giving would not be distributed proportionately amongst the various types of charitable organizations.&lt;ref name="BHIcharity"&gt;[[#refbhicharity|Tuerck et al., 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt; The FairTax may also affect state and local government debt as the federal income tax system provides tax advantages to [[municipal bond]]s.&lt;ref name="bonds"&gt;[[#refbonds|Types of Bonds]]&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents believe environmental benefits would result from the FairTax through [[environmental economics]] and the re-use and re-sale of [[used good]]s. Advocates argue the FairTax would provide an incentive for illegal immigrants to [[Immigration to the United States|legalize]] as they would otherwise not receive the rebate.&lt;ref name="billc3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fairtaxbook" /&gt; Proponents also believe that the FairTax would have positive effects on [[Civil liberties of the United States|civil liberties]] that are sometimes charged against the income tax system, such as [[social inequality]], [[economic inequality]], [[financial privacy]], [[self-incrimination]], [[unreasonable search and seizure]], [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]], and [[due process]].&lt;ref name="Sipos"/&gt;

If the FairTax bill were passed, permanent elimination of income taxation would not be guaranteed; the FairTax bill would repeal much of the existing [[Internal Revenue Code|tax code]], but the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]] would remain in place. Preventing new legislation from reintroducing income taxation would require a repeal of the Sixteenth Amendment to the [[United States Constitution]] with a separate provision expressly prohibiting a federal income tax.&lt;ref name="Vance2005b" /&gt; This is referred to as an "aggressive repeal". Separate income taxes enforced by individual states would be unaffected by the federal repeal. Passing the FairTax would require only a simple majority in each house of the United States Congress along with the signature of the President, whereas enactment of a [[constitutional amendment]] must be approved by two thirds of each house of the Congress, and three-quarters of the individual U.S. states. It is therefore possible that passage of the FairTax bill would simply add another taxation system. If a new income tax bill were passed after the FairTax passage, a hybrid system could develop; albeit, there is nothing preventing a bill for a hybrid system today. To address this issue and preclude that possibility, in the [[111th Congress]] John Linder introduced a contingent [[sunset provision]] in H.R. 25. It would require the repeal of the Sixteenth Amendment within 8 years after the implementation of the FairTax or, failing that, the FairTax would expire.&lt;ref name="titleIV"&gt;[[#refFairTaxAct|Fair Tax Act, 2009, Title IV]]&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have also argued that a tax on state government consumption could be [[unconstitutional]].&lt;ref name="buckley"/&gt;

==Changes in the retail economy==
{{see also|Tax#Economics of taxation|Effect of taxes and subsidies on price}}

Since the FairTax would not tax used goods, the value would be determined by the [[supply and demand]] in relation to new goods.&lt;ref name="pricetheory"/&gt; The price differential/margins between used and new goods would stay consistent, as the cost and value of used goods are in direct relationship to the cost and value of the new goods. Because the U.S. tax system has a hidden [[Effect of taxes and subsidies on price|effect on prices]], it is expected that moving to the FairTax would decrease production costs from the removal of business taxes and compliance costs, which is predicted to offset a portion of the FairTax effect on prices.&lt;ref name="fairtaxbook"/&gt;

===Value of used goods===
Since the FairTax would not tax used goods, some critics have argued that this would create a differential between the price of new and used goods, which may take years to equalize.&lt;ref name="Bartletttaxnotes"/&gt; Such a differential would certainly influence the sale of new goods like vehicles and homes. Similarly, some supporters have claimed that this would create an incentive to buy used goods, creating environmental benefits of re-use and re-sale. Conversely, it is argued that like the income tax system that contains embedded tax cost (see [[FairTax#Theories of retail pricing|Theories of retail pricing]]),&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;[[#refForbes2007|Forbes, 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt; used goods would contain the embedded FairTax cost.&lt;ref name="Taranto2"/&gt; While the FairTax would not be applied to the retail sales of used goods, the inherent value of a used good includes the taxes paid when the good was sold at retail. The value is determined by the supply and demand in relation to new goods.&lt;ref name="pricetheory"&gt;[[#refLandsburg1998|Landsburg, 1998]]&lt;/ref&gt; The price differential / margins between used and new goods should stay consistent, as the cost and value of used goods are in direct relationship to the cost and value of the new goods.

===Theories of retail pricing===
[[File:Tax supply and demand.svg|thumb|A [[supply and demand]] diagram illustrating taxes' effect on prices.]]
Based on a study conducted by [[Dale W. Jorgenson|Dale Jorgenson]], proponents state that [[production cost]] of domestic goods and services could decrease by approximately 22% on average after embedded tax costs are removed, leaving the sale nearly the same after taxes. The study concludes that producer prices would drop between 15% and 26% (depending on the type of good/service).&lt;ref name="jorgensonstudy"&gt;[[#refJorgenson1998|Jorgenson, 1998]]&lt;/ref&gt; Jorgenson's research included all income and payroll taxes in the embedded tax estimation, which assumes employee take-home pay ([[net income]]) remains unchanged from pre-FairTax levels.&lt;ref name="money" /&gt;&lt;ref name="boortzconfusion"&gt;[[#refBoortz2005Confusion|Boortz, 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Price and wage changes after the FairTax would largely depend on the response of the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] monetary authorities.&lt;ref name="thetruth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bartletttaxnotes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tuerck"&gt;[[#refTuerckMemo|Tuerck, 2008]]&lt;/ref&gt; Non-accommodation of the [[money supply]] would suggest retail prices and take home pay stay the same—embedded taxes are replaced by the FairTax. Full accommodation would suggest prices and incomes rise by the exclusive rate (i.e., 30%)—embedded taxes become [[windfall gain]]s. Partial accommodation would suggest a varying degree in-between.&lt;ref name="thetruth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tuerck" /&gt;

If businesses provided employees with [[gross income|gross pay]] (including income tax withholding and the employee share of payroll taxes),&lt;ref name="beaconhill"/&gt; [[Arduin, Laffer &amp; Moore Econometrics]] estimated production costs could decrease by a minimum of 11.55% (partial accommodation).&lt;ref name="ALME"/&gt; This reduction would be from the removal of the remaining embedded costs, including corporate taxes, compliance costs, and the employer share of payroll taxes. This decrease would offset a portion of the FairTax amount reflected in retail prices, which proponents suggest as the most likely scenario.&lt;ref name="thetruth"/&gt; Bruce Bartlett states that it is unlikely that nominal wages would be reduced, which he believes would result in a recession, but that the Federal Reserve would likely increase the money supply to accommodate price increases.&lt;ref name="Bartletttaxnotes"/&gt;  David Tuerck states "The monetary authorities would have to consider how the degree of accommodation, varying from none to full, would affect the overall economy and how it would affect the well-being of various groups such as retirees."&lt;ref name="tuerck"/&gt;

[[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] benefits would be adjusted for any price changes due to FairTax implementation.&lt;ref name="billtIII" /&gt;  The Beacon Hill Institute states that it would not matter, apart from transition issues, whether prices fall or rise—the relative tax burden and tax rate remains the same.&lt;ref name="beaconhill"/&gt;  Decreases in production cost would not fully apply to imported products; so according to proponents, it would provide tax advantages for domestic production and increase U.S. competitiveness in global trade (see [[Predicted effects of the FairTax#Border adjustability|Border adjustability]]).  To ease the transition, U.S. retailers will receive a tax credit equal to the FairTax on their inventory to allow for quick cost reduction. Retailers would also receive an administrative fee equal to the greater of $200 or 0.25% of the remitted tax as compensation for compliance costs,&lt;ref name="billc2"&gt;[[#refFairTaxAct|Fair Tax Act, 2009, Chapter 2]]&lt;/ref&gt; which amounts to around $5 billion.

==Effects on tax code compliance==
One avenue for non-compliance is the black market. FairTax supporters state that the [[black market]] is largely untaxed under the current tax system. Economists estimate the [[underground economy]] in the United States to be between one and three trillion dollars annually.&lt;ref name="shadow"&gt;[[#refMcTague2005|McTague, 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="madness"&gt;[[#refSchlosser2004|Schlosser, 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt; By imposing a sales tax, supporters argue that black market activity would be taxed when proceeds from such activity are spent on legal consumption.&lt;ref name="Taranto3"&gt;[[#refTaranto2007c|Taranto, 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the sale of illegal [[narcotic]]s would remain untaxed (instead of being guilty of income tax evasion, [[drug dealer]]s would be guilty of failing to submit sales tax), but they would face taxation when they used drug proceeds to buy consumer goods such as food, clothing, and cars. By taxing this previously untaxed money, FairTax supporters argue that non-filers would be paying part of their share of what would otherwise be uncollected income and payroll taxes.&lt;ref name="fairtaxbook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AEI"&gt;[[#refaei|American Enterprise Institute, 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other economists and analysts have argued that the underground economy would continue to bear the same tax burden as before.&lt;ref name="consumptiontax" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Taranto3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AEI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="quandry"&gt;[[#refMoffatt2006|Moffatt, 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; They state that replacing the current tax system with a consumption tax would not change the tax revenue generated from the underground economy—while illicit income is not taxed directly, spending of income from illicit activity results in business income and wages that are taxed.&lt;ref name="consumptiontax" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Taranto3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AEI"/&gt;

===Tax compliance and evasion===
[[File:Berryman political cartoon on income tax vs sales tax (3 June 1933).jpg|thumb|left|"No, No! Not That Way"—[[Political cartoon]] from 1933 commenting on a general [[sales tax]] over an [[income tax]].]]
Proponents state the FairTax would reduce the number of tax filers by about 86% (from 100 million to 14 million) and reduce the filing complexity to a simplified state sales tax form.&lt;ref name="KotlikoffBartlett"/&gt; The [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO), among others, have specifically identified the negative relationship between compliance costs and the number of focal points for collection.&lt;ref name="BHIstates"&gt;[[#refbhistates|Tuerck at el, 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the FairTax, the federal government would be able to concentrate tax enforcement efforts on a single tax. Retailers would receive an administrative fee equal to the greater of $200 or 0.25% of the remitted tax as compensation for compliance costs.&lt;ref name="billc2"/&gt; In addition, supporters state that the overwhelming majority of purchases occur in major retail outlets, which are very unlikely to evade the FairTax and risk losing their business licenses.&lt;ref name="beaconhill"/&gt; Economic Census figures for 2002 show that 48.5% of merchandise sales are made by just 688 businesses ([[Big-box store|"Big-Box" retailers]]). 85.7% of all retail sales are made by 92,334 businesses, which is 3.6% of American companies. In the service sector, approximately 80% of sales are made by 1.2% of U.S. businesses.&lt;ref name="thetruth"/&gt;

The FairTax is a national tax, but can be administered by the states rather than a federal agency,&lt;ref name="billc4"/&gt; which may have a bearing on compliance as the states' own agencies could monitor and audit businesses within that state. The 0.25% retained by the states amounts to $5 billion the states would have available for enforcement and administration. For example, [[California]] should receive over $500 million for enforcement and administration, which is more than the $327 million budget for the state's sales and excise taxes.&lt;ref name="LAO"&gt;[[#refCaLAO2004|California Legislative Analyst's Office]]&lt;/ref&gt; Because the federal money paid to the states would be a percentage of the total revenue collected, John Linder claims the states would have an incentive to maximize collections.&lt;ref name="fairtaxbook"/&gt; Proponents believe that states that choose to conform to the federal tax base would have advantages in enforcement, [[information sharing]], and clear interstate revenue allocation rules.&lt;ref name="BHIstates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="billc4"&gt;[[#refFairTaxAct|Fair Tax Act, 2009, Chapter 4]]&lt;/ref&gt; A study by the [[Beacon Hill Institute]] concluded that, on average, states could more than halve their sales tax rates and that state economies would benefit greatly from adopting a state-level FairTax.&lt;ref name="BHIstates"/&gt;

FairTax opponents state that compliance decreases when taxes are not [[Tax withholding in the United States|automatically withheld]] from citizens, and that massive [[tax evasion]] could result by collecting at just one point in the economic system.&lt;ref name="Bartletttaxnotes"/&gt; Compliance rates can also fall when taxed entities, rather than a third party, self-report their tax liability. For example, ordinary personal income taxes can be automatically withheld and are reported to the government by a third party. Taxes without withholding and with self-reporting, such as the FairTax, can see higher evasion rates.  Economist Jane Gravelle of the [[Congressional Research Service]] found studies showing that evasion rates of sales taxes are often above 10%, even when the sales tax rate is in the single digits.&lt;ref name="AEI"/&gt;  Tax publications by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), IMF, and [[Brookings Institution]] have suggested that the upper limit for a sales tax is about 10% before incentives for evasion become too great to control.&lt;ref name="Bartletttaxnotes"/&gt; According to the GAO, 80% of state tax officials opposed a national sales tax as an intrusion on their tax base.&lt;ref name="Bartletttaxnotes"/&gt; Opponents also raise concerns of legal [[tax avoidance]] by spending and consuming outside of the U.S. (imported goods would be subject to collection by the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]]).&lt;ref name="fallacies"&gt;[[#refKarvounis2007|Karvounis, 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Economists from the [[University of Tennessee]] concluded that while there would be many desirable [[macroeconomic]] effects, adoption of a national retail sales tax would also have serious effects on state and local government finances.&lt;ref name="UTKstates"/&gt; Economist Bruce Bartlett stated that if the states did not conform to the FairTax, they would have massive confusion and complication as to what is taxed by the state and what is taxed by the federal government.&lt;ref name="Bartletttaxnotes"/&gt; In addition, sales taxes have long exempted all but a few services because of the enormous difficulty in taxing intangibles—Bartlett suggests that the state may not have sufficient incentive to enforce the tax.&lt;ref name="BartlettWSJ"/&gt; [[University of Michigan]] economist [[Joel Slemrod]] argues that states would face significant issues in enforcing the tax. "Even at an average rate of around five percent, state sales taxes are difficult to administer."&lt;ref name="nyreview"&gt;[[#refSlemrod2005|Slemrod, 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;  University of Virginia School of Law professor George Yin states that the FairTax could have evasion issues with export and import transactions.&lt;ref name="Yin"/&gt; The [[President's Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform]] reported that if the federal government were to cease taxing income, states might choose to shift their revenue-raising to income.&lt;ref name="finalreport"/&gt; Absent the [[Internal Revenue Service]], it would be more difficult for the states to maintain viable income tax systems.&lt;ref name="finalreport"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UTKstates"&gt;[[#refFox2005|Fox and Murray, 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Underground economy===
Opponents of the FairTax argue that imposing a national retail sales tax would drive transactions underground and create a vast [[underground economy]].&lt;ref name="money"/&gt; Under a retail sales tax system, the purchase of intermediate goods and services that are [[factors of production]] are not taxed, since those goods would produce a final retail good that would be taxed. Individuals and businesses may be able to manipulate the tax system by claiming that purchases are for intermediate goods, when in fact they are final purchases that should be taxed. Proponents point out that a business is required to have a registered seller's certificate on file, and must keep complete records of all transactions for six years. Businesses must also record all taxable goods bought for seven years. They are required to report these sales every month (see [[FairTax#Personal versus business purchases|Personal vs. business purchases]]).&lt;ref name="billc5"&gt;[[#refFairTaxAct|Fair Tax Act, 2009, Chapter 5]]&lt;/ref&gt; The government could also stipulate that all retail sellers provide buyers with a written receipt, regardless of transaction type (cash, credit, etc.), which would create a paper trail for evasion with risk of having the buyer turn them in (the FairTax authorizes a reward for reporting tax cheats).&lt;ref name="KotlikoffBartlett"/&gt;

While many economists and tax experts support a consumption tax, problems could arise with using a retail sales tax rather than a [[value added tax]] (VAT).&lt;ref name="money"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bartletttaxnotes"/&gt;  A VAT imposes a tax on the [[value added]] at every intermediate step of production, so the goods reach the final consumer with much of the tax already in the price.&lt;ref name="worstall"&gt;[[#refWorstall|Worstall, 2015]]&lt;/ref&gt; The retail seller has little incentive to conceal retail sales, since he has already paid much of the good's tax. Retailers are unlikely to subsidize the consumer's tax evasion by concealing sales. In contrast, a retailer has paid no tax on goods under a sales tax system. This provides an incentive for retailers to conceal sales and engage in "[[arbitrage|tax arbitrage]]" by sharing some of the illicit tax savings with the final consumer.  Citing evasion, [[Tim Worstall]] wrote in ''Forbes'' that Europe's 20-25% consumption taxes simply would not work if they were a sales tax: that's why they’re all a VAT.&lt;ref name="worstall" /&gt;  [[Laurence Kotlikoff]] has stated that the government could compel firms to report, via [[Tax forms in the United States#1099 series|1099-type forms]], their sales to other firms, which would provide the same records that arise under a VAT.&lt;ref name="KotlikoffBartlett"/&gt;  In the United States, a general sales tax is imposed in 45 states plus the District of Columbia (accounting for over 97% of both population and economic output), which proponents argue provides a large infrastructure for taxing sales that many countries do not have.

===Personal versus business purchases===
Businesses would be required to submit monthly or quarterly reports (depending on sales volume) of taxable sales and sales tax collected on their monthly sales tax return. During [[Sales Tax Audit|audits]], the business would have to produce invoices for the "business purchases" that they did not pay sales tax on, and would have to be able to show that they were genuine business expenses.&lt;ref name="billc5"/&gt; Advocates state the significant 86% reduction in collection points would greatly increase the likelihood of business audits, making [[tax evasion]] behavior much more risky.&lt;ref name="KotlikoffBartlett"/&gt; Additionally, the FairTax legislation has several [[Fine (penalty)|fines]] and [[Sentence (law)|penalties]] for non-compliance, and authorizes a mechanism for reporting tax cheats to obtain a reward.&lt;ref name="billc5"/&gt; To prevent businesses from purchasing everything for their employees, in a family business for example, goods and services bought by the business for the employees that are not strictly for business use would be taxable.&lt;ref name="billc5"/&gt; Health insurance or medical expenses would be an example where the business would have to pay the FairTax on these purchases.  Taxable property and services purchased by a qualified [[non-profit]] or [[religious organization]] "for business purposes" would not be taxable.&lt;ref name="billc7"&gt;[[#refFairTaxAct|Fair Tax Act, 2009, Chapter 7]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==FairTax movement==
[[File:Orlandotaxrallypic1.jpg|thumb|A FairTax rally in [[Orlando, Florida]] on July 28, 2006.]] The creation of the FairTax began with a group of businessmen from Houston, Texas, who initially financed what has become the political advocacy group [[Americans For Fair Taxation]] (AFFT), which has grown into a large tax reform movement.&lt;ref name="movement" /&gt;&lt;ref name="thetruth"/&gt;   This organization, founded in 1994, claims to have spent over $20 million in research, marketing, lobbying, and organizing efforts over a ten-year period and is seeking to raise over $100 million more to promote the plan.&lt;ref name="redherring"&gt;[[#refLinbeck2007|Linbeck, 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt; AFFT includes a staff in [[Houston]] and a large group of volunteers who are working to get the FairTax enacted.

In 2007 [[Bruce Bartlett]] said the FairTax was devised by the [[Church of Scientology]] in the early 1990s,&lt;ref name="BartlettWSJ" /&gt; drawing comparisons between the tax policy and religious doctrine from the faith, whose [[creation myth]] holds that an evil alien ruler known as [[Xenu]] "used phony tax inspections as a guise for destroying his enemies."&lt;ref name=BartlettPlot&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bartlett|first1=Bruce|title=Scientology's Fair Tax Plot|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/scientologys-fair-tax-plot/|accessdate=17 June 2015|work=[[CBS News]]|date=7 September 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213070621/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/scientologys-fair-tax-plot/|archivedate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Representative John Linder told the ''Atlanta Journal-Constitution'' that Bartlett confused the FairTax movement with the Scientology-affiliated [[Citizens for an Alternative Tax System]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGalloway2007|Galloway, 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt; which also seeks to abolish the federal income tax and replace it with a national retail sales tax. Leo Linbeck, AFFT Chairman and CEO, stated "As a founder of Americans For Fair Taxation, I can state categorically, however, that Scientology played no role in the founding, research or crafting of the legislation giving expression to the FairTax."&lt;ref name="redherring" /&gt;

Much support has been achieved by talk radio personality [[Neal Boortz]].&lt;ref name="boortzbook"/&gt; Boortz's book (co-authored by Georgia Congressman [[John Linder]]) entitled ''[[The FairTax Book]]'', explains the proposal and spent time atop the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]]. Boortz stated that he donates his share of the proceeds to charity to promote the book.&lt;ref name="boortzbook"&gt;[[#refboortzbook|Boortz, 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Boortz and Linder have organized several FairTax rallies to publicize support for the plan. Other media personalities have also assisted in growing grassroots support including former radio and TV talk show host [[Larry Elder]], radio host and former candidate for the 2012 GOP Presidential Nomination [[Herman Cain]], Fox News and radio host [[Sean Hannity]], and Fox Business Host [[John Stossel]].&lt;ref name="boortzrally"&gt;[[#refBoortz2006|Boortz, 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; The FairTax received additional visibility as one of the issues in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]]. At a debate on June 30, 2007, several [[2008 Republican presidential candidates|Republican candidates]] were asked about their position on the FairTax and many responded that they would sign the bill into law if elected.&lt;ref name="2008election"/&gt; The most vocal promoters of the FairTax during the 2008 primary elections were Republican candidate [[Mike Huckabee]] and Democratic candidate [[Mike Gravel]]. The Internet, [[blogosphere]], and [[electronic mailing lists]] have contributed to promoting, organizing, and gaining support for the FairTax. In the 2012 Republican presidential primary, and his ensuing [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] presidential run, former Governor of New Mexico and businessman [[Gary Johnson]] actively campaigned for the FairTax.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Johnson 2012 Campaign Site, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Former CEO of [[Godfather's Pizza]] [[Herman Cain]] has been promoting the FairTax as a final step in a multiple-phase tax reform.&lt;ref&gt;[[#HermanCain|RedState, 2011]]&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of the United States, the [[Christian Heritage Party of Canada]] adopted a FairTax proposal as part of their 2011 election platform&lt;ref&gt;[[#ChristianHeritage|Christian Heritage, 2011]]&lt;/ref&gt; but won no seats in that election.

'''Fair fighting''' is a [[conflict resolution]] process, with the aim of improving marital communication.

Fair fighting is a set of rules designed to help couples discuss their differences within boundaries, and in this way preserving the relationship over the need to "win over" the other.
Fair fighting is a method for spouses to effectively communicate their respective needs to each other through the use of problem-solving skills.

Disciplines involved are: [[psychology]], [[marital and family therapy]], and [[conflict resolution]].

==Definition==
Fair fighting is a respectful, structured way of confronting each other on issues
that are causing open or hidden conflict. It is a method for handling and
resolving the differences of opinion that inevitably occur between spouses or
partners. The basic idea is to provide an alternative to “dirty fighting” which uses
reciprocal blaming, yelling, accusing and humiliating the other, in order to win or
be “right.” It provides a way to support an individual's point of view while recognizing
his or her partner’s needs.

A structure is defined{{By whom|date=February 2017}} as: “agreed upon ground rules for handling differences and conflict well.” Very clear rules give couples a road map for getting through discussions.

==Background==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
Relationship counselors have discovered that conflict can be a learning opportunity for people who learn to correctly manage it. [Wilmot and Hocker], [J. Downs] are among many authors who have contributed to the communicative tool of fair fighting. They propose to establish a good frame of rules to fight fair even before the first serious confrontation appears.

==Core ideas==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
People in intimate relationships instigate conflicts in order to resolve unsatisfied needs.
Among [[Maslow’s hierarchy of needs]], marital fighting springs on frustration of needs 2-4:  Safety, Belonging; Love, and Self-Esteem.  The need for safety refers to the absence or alleviation of anxiety and fear of isolation and rejection. It is a sense of well-being, physical and financial security, and provides a foundation for personal health.  The need for belonging and love, when satisfied represents the resolution of the dreaded feelings of loneliness, abandonment, depression, and social anxiety.

Even when a good fight can clear the air and define which needs are claiming for attention, unbridled, applying a zero-sum style of fighting ends up destroying the relationship itself.
With the objective of controlling, humiliating or winning over the other, all kinds of negative things are said that are very difficult to retrieve. The results are discouraging,
because when repetition of the fight happens, inevitable when it is not resolved at the deep needs level, it will sour the relationship. Fair fighting is designed to deal with issues that bring serious conflict while preserving the relationship.

[[File:FreikorpsBerlinStahlhelmM18TuerkischeForm.jpg|thumb|300px|Armed ''Freikorps'' paramilitaries in [[Weimar Germany]] in 1919]]

'''''Freikorps''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈfʁaɪˌkoːɐ̯|lang}}, "Free [[Corps]]") were [[Germans|German]] volunteer units that existed from the 18th to the early 20th centuries, which effectively fought as [[mercenary]] or [[private army|private armies]], regardless of their own nationality. In German-speaking countries, the first so-called ''Freikorps'' ("free regiments", {{lang-de|Freie Regimenter}}) were formed in the 18th century from native volunteers, enemy renegades and deserters. These sometimes exotically equipped units served as [[infantry]] and [[cavalry]] (or more rarely as [[artillery]]), sometimes in just [[Company (military unit)|company]] strength, sometimes in formations up to several thousand strong; there were also various mixed formations or legions. The Prussian ''von Kleist Freikorps'' included infantry, [[Jäger (infantry)|jäger]], [[dragoon]]s and [[hussar]]s. The French [[Volontaires de Saxe]] combined [[uhlan]]s and [[dragoons]].

In the aftermath of [[World War I]] and during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19]], ''Freikorps'' consisting largely of World War I veterans were raised as right-wing [[paramilitary]] militias, ostensibly to fight on behalf of the government&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haffner|first1=Sebastian|title=Defying Hitler|date=2000|publisher=Picador|isbn=0-312-42113-3|pages=30-31, 33}}&lt;/ref&gt; against the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet]]-backed German Communists attempting to overthrow the [[Weimar Republic]].&lt;ref&gt; William L. Shirer, ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany'', New York, NY, Simon &amp; Schuster, 2011, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heiden|first1=Konrad|title=Der Fuehrer: Hitler's Rise to Power|date=1944|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|location=Boston, MA|pages=21-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''Freikorps'' also largely despised the Republic and were involved in assassinations of its supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heiden|first1=Konrad|title=Der Fuehrer: Hitler's Rise to Power|date=1944|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|location=Boston, MA|pages=23-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heiden|first1=Konrad|title=Der Fuehrer: Hitler's Rise to Power|date=1944|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|location=Boston, MA|pages=88-89}}&lt;/ref&gt; An entire series of [[Awards of the German Freikorps|''Freikorps'' awards]] also existed.

== Origins ==
[[File:Serbian, Wurmser, Odonel and Mahony Free Corps in 1798.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Serbian, Wurmser, Odonel and Mahony Free Corps in 1798]]

The very first ''Freikorps'' were recruited by [[Frederick the Great]] during the [[Seven Years' War]]. On 15 July 1759, Frederick ordered the creation of a squadron of volunteer [[hussar]]s to be attached to the 1st Regiment of Hussars (von Kleist's Own). He entrusted the creation and command of this new unit to Colonel Friedrich Wilhelm von Kleist. This first squadron (80 men) was raised in [[Dresden]] and consisted mainly of Hungarian deserters. This squadron was placed under the command of Lieutenant Johann Michael von Kovacs. At the end of 1759, the first four squadrons of [[dragoon]]s (also called horse grenadiers) of the ''Freikorps'' were organised. They initially consisted of Prussian volunteers from [[Berlin]], [[Magdeburg]], [[Mecklenburg]] and [[Leipzig]], but later recruited deserters. The ''Freikorps'' were regarded as unreliable by regular armies, so they were mainly used as sentries and for minor duties.

These early ''Freikorps'' appeared during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] and especially the Seven Years' War, when France, Prussia and the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] embarked on an escalation of [[petty warfare]] while conserving their regular regiments. Even during the last [[Kabinettskriege|Kabinettskrieg]], the [[War of the Bavarian Succession]], ''Freikorp'' formations were formed in 1778. Germans, [[Hungarians]], [[Poles]], [[Lithuanians]] and [[South Slavs]], as well as [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Tatars]] and [[Cossacks]], were believed by all warring parties to be inherently good fighters. The nationality of many soldiers can no longer be ascertained as the ethnic origin was often described imprecisely in the regimental lists. Slavs (Croats, Serbs) were often referred to as "Hungarians" or just "Croats", and Muslim recruits ([[Albanians]], [[Bosnians]], Tatars) as "Turks".

For Prussia, the [[Pandur]]s, who were made up of Croats and Serbs, were a clear model for the organization of such "free" troops. Frederick the Great created 14 "[[free infantry]]" (''Frei-Infanterie'') units, mainly between 1756 and 1758, which were intended to be attractive to those soldiers who wanted military "adventure", but did not want to have to do military drill. A distinction should be made between the ''Freikorps'' formed up to 1759 for the final years of the war, which operated independently and disrupted the enemy with surprise attacks and the free infantry which consisted of various military branches (such as infantry, hussars, dragoons, ''jäger'') and were used in combination. They were often used to ward off [[Maria Theresa]]'s Pandurs. In the era of [[linear tactics]], light troops had been seen necessary for outpost, reinforcement and reconnaissance duties. During the war, eight such volunteer corps were set up:

* [[Friedrich Adolf Rudolf von Trümbach|Trümbach]]'s ''Freikorps'' (Voluntaires de Prusse) (FI)
* [[Friedrich Wilhelm Gottfried Arnd von Kleist|Kleist]]'s ''Freikorps'' (FII)
* [[Joachim Reinhold von Glasenapp|Glasenapp]]'s Free Dragoons (F III)
* Schony's ''Freikorps'' (F IV)
* Gschray's ''Freikorps'' (F V)
* [[Friedrich Wilhelm Bauer|Bauer]]'s Free Hussars (F VI)
* [[Légion Britannique]] (FV - of the [[Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg]])
* Volontaires Auxiliaires (F VI).&lt;ref&gt;Background, formation and numbering according to Bleckwenn (1986) Vol. IV, pp. 82ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Because, with some exceptions, they were seen as undisciplined and less battleworthy, they were used for less onerous guard and [[garrison]] duties. In the so-called "petty wars", the ''Freikorps'' interdicted enemy supply lines with [[guerrilla warfare]]. In the case of capture, their members were at risk of being executed as irregular fighters. In Prussia the ''Freikorps'', which Frederick the Great had despised as "vermin", were disbanded. Their soldiers were given no entitlement to pensions or invalidity payments.

In France, many corps continued to exist until 1776. They were attached to regular dragoon regiments as ''jäger'' [[squadron (army)|squadron]]s. During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Austria recruited various ''Freikorps'' of [[Slavs|Slavic]] origin. The [[Slavonia|Slavonic]] Wurmser ''Freikorps'' fought in Alsace. The combat effectiveness of the six Viennese ''Freikorps'' (37,000 infantrymen and cavalrymen), however, was low. An exception were the border regiments of Croats and Serbs who served permanently on the Austro-[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] border.

== Napoleonic era ==
 [[File:Kersting - Vorposten.jpg|thumb|upright|Painting of three famous Free Corps members in 1815: [[Heinrich Hartmann]], [[Theodor Körner (author)|Theodor Körner]], and [[Friedrich Friesen]]]]
''Freikorps'' in the modern sense emerged in Germany during the course of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. They fought not so much for money but rather out of [[patriotism|patriotic]] motives, seeking to shake off the French [[Confederation of the Rhine]]. After the French under Emperor [[Napoleon]] had either conquered the German states or forced them to collaborate, remnants of the defeated armies continued to fight on in this fashion. Famous formations included the [[King's German Legion]], who had fought for Britain in French-occupied Spain and were mainly recruited from Hanoverians, the [[Lützow Free Corps]] and the [[Black Brunswickers]].

The ''Freikorps'' attracted many nationally disposed citizens and students. ''Freikorps'' commanders such as [[Ferdinand von Schill]], [[Ludwig Adolf Wilhelm von Lützow]] or [[Frederick William, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]], known as the "Black Duke", led their own attacks on Napoleonic occupation forces in Germany. Those led by Schill were decimated in the [[Battle of Stralsund (1809)]]; many were killed in battle or executed at Napoleon's command in the aftermath. The ''Freikorps'' were very popular during the period of the [[German War of Liberation]] (1813–15), during which von Lützow, a survivor of Schill's ''Freikorps'', formed his Lützow Free Corps. The anti-Napoleonic ''Freikorps'' often operated behind French lines as a kind of commando or guerrilla force.

Throughout the 19th century, these anti-Napoleonic ''Freikorps'' were greatly praised and glorified by German nationalists, and a heroic myth built up around their exploits. This myth was invoked, in considerably different circumstances, in the aftermath of Germany's defeat in [[World War I]].

== 1815–1871 ==

Even in the aftermath of the Napoleonic era, ''Freikorps'' were set up with varying degrees of success.

During the March 1848 riots, student ''Freikorps'' were set up in Munich.

In [[First Schleswig War]] of 1848 the ''Freikorps'' of [[Ludwig Freiherr von und zu der Tann-Rathsamhausen|''von der Tann'']], [[Heinrich von Zastrow|''Zastrow'']] and others distinguished themselves.

In 1864 in [[Mexico]], the French formed the so-called ''Contreguerrillas'' under former Prussian hussar officer, Milson. In [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Italy]] [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]] formed his famous ''[[Freischar]]s'', notably the "Thousand of Marsala", which landed in [[Sicily]] in 1860.

Even before the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870/71, ''Freikorps'' were developed in [[France]] that were known as [[franc-tireur]]s.

== Post–World War I ==

The meaning of the word ''Freikorps'' changed over time. After 1918, the term was used for the [[paramilitary]] organizations that sprang up around Germany as soldiers returned in defeat from [[World War I]]. They were the key [[Weimar paramilitary groups]] active during that time. Many German veterans felt disconnected from civilian life, and joined a ''Freikorps'' in search of stability within a [[military]] structure. Others, angry at their sudden, apparently inexplicable defeat, joined up in an effort to put down [[communist]] uprisings, such as the [[Spartacist uprising]], or exact some form of revenge on those they considered [[Stab-in-the-back myth|responsible for the armistice]]. They received considerable support from Minister of Defence [[Gustav Noske]], a member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]]. Noske used them to crush the [[German Revolution of 1918–19]] and the [[Marxist]] [[Spartacist League]], including arresting [[Karl Liebknecht]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]], who were killed on 15 January 1919. They were also used to defeat the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]] in May 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The German Freikorps 1918–23: 1918–23|author=Carlos Caballero Jurado, Ramiro Bujeiro|year=2001|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=1-84176-184-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 May 1919, members of ''Freikorps'' Lützow in [[Ramersdorf-Perlach|Perlach]] near [[Munich]], acted on a tip from a local cleric and arrested and killed twelve alleged communist workers (most of them actually members of the Social Democratic Party). A memorial on Pfanzeltplatz in Munich today commemorates the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jude und Demokrat: Erinnerungen eines Münchener Rechtsanwalts 1883 bis 1939|author=[[Max Hirschberg]] &amp; Reinhard Weber}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris, ''Justice Imperiled: The Anti-Nazi Lawyer [[Max Hirschberg]] in Weimar Germany''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.axishistory.com/index.php?id=7935 Freikorps Lützow] in the ''Axis History Factbook''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WWIposter9.jpg|thumb|right|A recruitment poster for the [[Freikorps Hülsen]]]]
''Freikorps'' also fought against the communists in [[Freikorps in the Baltic|the Baltics]], [[Silesian Uprisings|Silesia]], [[Poland]] and [[East Prussia]] after the end of World War I, including aviation combat, often with significant success. [[Anti-Slavic racism]] was sometimes present, although the [[ethnic cleansing]] ideology and [[anti-Semitism]] that would be expressed in later years had not yet developed.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Mann, ''Fascists'', Cambridge/New York: Cambridge University, 2004, {{ISBN|9780521831314}}, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Baltics they fought against communists as well as against the newborn independent democratic countries [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]]. In Latvia, Freikorps murdered 300 civilians in Mitau who were suspected of having "[[Bolshevik]] sympathies". After the capture of [[Riga]], another 3000 alleged communists were killed,&lt;ref&gt;A Brief History of the Birth of the Nazis: How the Freikorps Blazed a Trail for Hitler

J.|last2=Fielden|first2=Philip|title=Republic to Reich: A History of Germany 1918–1939|date=2007|publisher=Cengage Learning Australia|location=Melbourne, Australia|page=28|edition=Third}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their attack was halted when German citizens loyal to the government went on strike, cutting off many services and making daily life so problematic that the coup was called off.

In 1920, [[Adolf Hitler]] had just begun his political career as the leader of the tiny and as-yet-unknown Deutsche Arbeiterpartei/DAP [[German Workers' Party]], which was soon renamed the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei/NSDAP (National Socialist German Workers Party) or [[Nazi Party]] in Munich. Numerous future members and leaders of the [[Nazi Party]] had served in the ''Freikorps'', including [[Ernst Röhm]], future head of the [[Sturmabteilung]], or SA, [[Heinrich Himmler]], future head of the [[Schutzstaffel]], or SS, and [[Rudolf Höß]], the future ''Kommandant'' of the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. [[Hermann Ehrhardt]], founder and leader of [[Marinebrigade Ehrhardt]], and his deputy Commander Eberhard Kautter, leaders of the [[Viking League]], refused to help Hitler and [[Erich Ludendorff]] in their [[Beer Hall Putsch]] and conspired against them.

Hitler eventually viewed some of them as threats. A huge ceremony was arranged on 9 November 1933 in which the ''Freikorps'' leaders symbolically presented their old battle flags to Hitler's SA and SS. It was a sign of allegiance to their new authority, the Nazi state.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Waite1969|Waite]], p.&amp;nbsp;197.&lt;/ref&gt; When Hitler's internal purge of the party, the [[Night of the Long Knives]], came in 1934, a large number of Freikorps leaders were targeted for killing or arrest, including Ehrhardt and Röhm. Historian Robert GL Waite claims that in Hitler's "Röhm Purge" speech to the ''Reichstag'' on 13 July 1934, he implied that the Freikorps were one of the groups of "pathological enemies of the state".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Waite1969|Waite]], pp.&amp;nbsp;280–1.&lt;br&gt;See also the full text of the speech at http://members.tripod.com/~Comicism/340713.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
In French, the Freikorps are referred to as "Corps Franc." Starting in [[October 1939]], the [[French Army]] stood up a number of Corps Franc units with the mission of carrying out [[ambush]], [[Raid_(military)|raid]], and [[harassment|harassing]] [[Military_operation|operations]] forward of the [[Maginot Line]] during the period known as [[Phoney_War|The Phoney War (Drôle de Guerre)]]. They were tasked with attacking German troops guarding the [[Siegfried Line]]. Future [[Vichy_France|Vichy]] [[Collaborationism#France|collaborationist]], [[Anti-communism|Anti-Bolshevik]] and [[Waffen-SS|SS]] [[Sturmbannführer|Major]] [[Joseph_Darnand#Vichy_collaborator|Joseph Darnand]] was one of the more famous participants in these [[commando]] actions. 

In May of 1940, the experience of the Phoney War era Corps Franc was an influence in creating the [[Groupes Franc Motorisé de Cavalerie|Groupes Francs Motorisé de Cavalerie (GFC)]] who played storied role in the delaying operations and last stands of the [[Battle of France]], notably in the defenses of [[Battle_of_France#Weygand_Plan|the Seine]] and [[Battle_of_Saumur_(1940)|the Loire]].

On November 25 1942, in the immediate aftermath of the [[Operation Torch|Allied Invasion of Vichy French North Africa]] the [[Corps Francs d'Afrique|Corps Francs d'Afrique (CFA)]](African Corps Franc) was stood up in [[French_protectorate_in_Morocco|French Morocco]] within the [[Free French Forces]] by [[Henri_Giraud|General Giraud]]. Giraud drew the members of the all-volunteer unit from [[Moroccans]] of diverse religious backgrounds (Christian, Jew, and Muslim) and gave them the title of ''[[Vélite (First French Empire)|Vélite]]'' a name inspired by the elite light infantry of [[Napoleon|Napoleon's]] [[Imperial_Guard_(Napoleon_I)|Imperial Guard]] who were named after the [[Roman_army_of_the_mid-Republic|Roman]] [[Velites]]. Much of the Corps was drawn from [[Henri d'Astier de la Vigerie]] and [[José Aboulker]]'s [[Géo Gras Group|Géo Gras]] [[French Resistance|French Resistance Group]] which had been responsible for the [[Géo_Gras_Group#November_8,_1942|Algiers Insurrection]] where the Resistance seized control of [[Algiers]] on the night of November 8 1942 in coordination with the [[Operation_Torch|Allied landings]] happening that same night. In taking over Algiers, they managed to capture both [[François_Darlan|Admiral Darlan]] and [[Alphonse Juin|General Juin]] which led to the [[François_Darlan#Darlan's_deal_in_North_Africa|Darlan Deal]] wherein [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] forces came over to the Allied side. [[François_Darlan|Darlan]] was later assassinated by [[Fernand Bonnier de La Chapelle]] an early member of the Corps Franc d'Afrique. They functioned as the [[Free French Forces|Free French]] equivalent to the [[British_Army|British]] [[Commandos_(United_Kingdom)|Commandos]]. 
The Corps Francs d'Afrique went on to fight [[Erwin Rommel|Rommel's]] [[Afrikakorps]] in [[Tunisian_Campaign|Tunisia]] with the [[United States Army|U.S.]] [[United_States_Army_North#World_War_II|5th Army]]. They fought alongside the [[139th_(Sherwood_Foresters)_Brigade|British 139th Brigade]] at [[Battle of Kassarine Pass|Kassarine]] and [[Operation_Ochsenkopf|Sidi Nasr]] where they famously conducted a heroic bayonet charge, facing two to one odds, against the [[Military_history_of_Italy_during_World_War_II|Italian]] [[Bersaglieri|34th Battalion of the 10th Bersaglieri]] near the mountain of [[Sejnane|Kef Zilia]] on the road to [[Bizerte]], taking 380 [[Prisoner of war|prisoners]], killing the Italian Battalion Commander, and capturing the plans for [[Operation Auslading]]. They participated in [[Tunisian_Campaign#Battle|the capture of]] [[Bizerte]] in [[May 1943]].

For its actions, the Corps Franc d'Afrique was awarded the [[Croix de Guerre]]. 

The CFA was formally dissolved on July 9 1943, with its members and equipment forming the corps of the newly created [[Groupe des Commandos d'Afrique|African Commando Group (GCA)]] on July 13 1943 in [[Damous|Dupleix]], [[French_Algeria|Algeria]], today seen as a forbear to the post war [[11e_régiment_parachutiste_de_choc|Parachutist Shock Battalions]] and the modern day [[13th_Parachute_Dragoon_Regiment|13th RDP]]. The GCA went on to fight at [[Pianosa#History|Pianosa]], [[Invasion_of_Elba|Elba]], [[Operation_Avalanche|Salerno]], [[Operation Dragoon|Provence]], [[1st_Army_(France)#1944–1945|Belfort]], [[Fort_de_Giromagny|Giromagny]], [[Battle_of_Alsace|Alsace]], [[Cernay,_Haut-Rhin#Second_World_War|Cernay]], [[Guebwiller]], [[Buhl,_Bas-Rhin|Buhl]], and the [[Western_Allied_invasion_of_Germany|Invasion of Germany]].

'''Heidi Cullen''' is the chief scientist for the non-profit environmental organization, [[Climate Central]], located in [[Princeton, New Jersey]].  In addition, she is a guest lecturer at nearby [[Princeton University]], and the author of the book, ''[[The Weather of the Future]]''. An expert and commentator about issues related to climate change and the environment, she was an on-air personality at [[The Weather Channel]], and is a senior research fellow at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] (Penn).

==Life and career==
Born in [[Staten Island]], New York, Cullen received a B.S. in [[industrial engineering]] and [[operations research]], from [[Columbia University]], followed by a doctorate in climatology and [[Physical oceanography#Ocean.E2.80.93atmosphere interface|ocean-atmosphere]] dynamics from the [[Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory]], also at Columbia.&lt;ref name=TWC&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mlb.weather.com/tv/personalities/Dr-Heidi-Cullen.html | publisher=[[The Weather Channel]] | title=Dr. Heidi Cullen | accessdate=October 17, 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017210751/http://mlb.weather.com/tv/personalities/Dr-Heidi-Cullen.html | archivedate=October 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent to her educational experiences, Cullen worked at the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] (NCAR), located in [[Boulder, Colorado]]. While there, she was given a fellowship from the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) to return to Columbia University, where she worked at the university's International Research Institute for Climate and Society.  The fellowship allowed her to contribute to a project which looked at the effect of climate on water resources in Brazil and Paraguay.&lt;ref name=TYP&gt;{{cite web | url=http://yearsoflivingdangerously.com/science-advisor/heidi-cullen-ph-d/ | publisher=The Years Project | title=Heidi Cullen | accessdate=October 17, 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006130550/http://yearsoflivingdangerously.com/science-advisor/heidi-cullen-ph-d/ | archivedate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After her fellowship, Cullen joined The Weather Channel, becoming their initial expert on climate change topics.  In October 2006 she previewed her 30-minute program, ''The Climate Code''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newsonwomen.com/news_on_women/2006/08/dr_heidi_cullen.html | publisher=News on Women | title=Dr Heidi Cullen and The Climate Code | accessdate=October 17, 2014 | last=Krause | first=Alice | date=August 23, 2006 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017214903/http://www.newsonwomen.com/news_on_women/2006/08/dr_heidi_cullen.html | archivedate=October 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April of the following year, along with a broadband program, ''The Climate Code'' would change to an hour format, and be retitled, ''[[Forecast Earth]]''; Cullen was part of the creation process of both shows. In November 2008, [[NBC]], the parent company of The Weather Channel, cancelled the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/capitalweathergang/2008/11/nbc_fires_twc_environmental_un.html | publisher=[[The Washington Post]] | title=NBC Fires Weather Channel Environmental Unit | last=Freedman | first=Andrew | date=November 21, 2008 | accessdate=October 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving The Weather Channel, Cullen became the chief climatologist for the not-for-profit organization, Climate Central, where she issues reports on climate topics.  In addition to her responsibilities at Climate Central, she lectures at nearby Princeton University, and is a senior research fellow at the Penn's Wharton Risk Management and Decision Processes Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://waterforfood.nebraska.edu/wff2013/heidi-cullen/ | publisher=[[University of Nebraska]] | title=Heidi Cullen | accessdate=October 17, 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017220618/http://waterforfood.nebraska.edu/wff2013/heidi-cullen/ | archivedate=October 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010 she authored the book, ''The Weather of the Future'', which gives one perspective of what different locations might look in the year 2050 based upon current climate modeling theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/books/authors/138601291/heidi-cullen | publisher=[[National Public Radio]] | title=Books by Heidi Cullen | accessdate=October 17, 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205094057/http://www.npr.org/books/authors/138601291/heidi-cullen | archivedate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kakutani|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She also had the capacity of chief science advisor for the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] series, ''The Years of Living Dangerously''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://roadtoparis.info/top-list/20-women-making-waves-climate-change-debate/heidi-cullen/ | publisher=International Council for Science | title=Heidi Cullen - Climatologist leading us through Years of Living Dangerously | accessdate=October 17, 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017221607/http://roadtoparis.info/top-list/20-women-making-waves-climate-change-debate/heidi-cullen/ | archivedate=October 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sho.com/sho/years-of-living-dangerously/about | publisher=Showtime | title=Years of Living Dangerously: About the Series | accessdate=October 17, 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723072237/http://www.sho.com/sho/years-of-living-dangerously/about | archivedate=July 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also currently a member of the Science Advisory Board for NOAA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sab.noaa.gov/Board/board.html | publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] | title=Science Advisory Board Members | accessdate=October 17, 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714214524/http://www.sab.noaa.gov/Board/board.html | archivedate=July 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sits on the Council of the American Meteorological Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ametsoc.org/stacpges/CommitteeDisplay/CommitteeDisplay.aspx?CC=CNCIL | publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]] | title=Council of the AMS | accessdate=October 17, 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701210619/http://ametsoc.org/stacpges/CommitteeDisplay/CommitteeDisplay.aspx?CC=CNCIL | archivedate=July 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ho Chi Minh 1946.jpg|thumb|Hồ Chí Minh was the founder and leader of the Communist Party of Vietnam]]
This article describes the '''history of the Communist Party of Vietnam''', which ruled all or part of Vietnam beginning in 1945.

== Thanh Niên ==

The [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] (CPV) originated in 1925. In the spring of that year the young man born Nguyễn Sinh Cung—under the [[pseudonym]] Nguyễn Ái Quốc (Nguyen the Patriot) but best known as [[Hồ Chí Minh]] (Ho the Enlightened One)—established the Vietnamese Revolutionary Youth Association (&lt;small&gt;''Vietnamese:''&lt;/small&gt; ''Việt Nam Thanh Niên Kách Mệnh Hội''—commonly: "Thanh Niên") a [[communism|Communist]] political organization.{{sfn|Huynh|1982|pp=63–64}}

Thanh Nien sought to employ [[patriotism]] to end the [[colonialism|colonial occupation]] of the country by France.{{sfn|Huynh|1982|p=64}} The group sought political and social objectives—both national independence and [[land reform|redistribution of land]] to working [[peasant]]s.{{sfn|Huynh|1982|p=64}}

The establishment of Thanh Niên was preceded by the arrival of [[Communist International]] [[functionary]] Ho Chi Minh in [[Guangzhou|Canton]], China from Moscow in December 1924.{{sfn|Huynh|1982|p=66}} Ho was ostensibly sent to China to work as a secretary and interpreter to [[Mikhail Borodin]],{{sfn|Huynh|1982|p=66}} but he actually set to work almost immediately attempting to transform the existing Vietnamese patriotic movement towards revolutionary ends. Ho managed to convert a small group of émigré [[intellectuals]] called Tam Tam Xa (Heart-to-Heart Association) to [[revolutionary socialism]] and Thanh Niên was born.{{sfn|Huynh|1982|p=66}}

The headquarters of the organization in Canton directed the underground revolutionary movement in Vietnam, making all important decisions.{{sfn|Huynh|1982|p=67}}

Thanh Nien was designed to prepare for an [[revolution|armed struggle]] against the French colonial occupation.{{sfn|Huynh|1982|p=70}}  Ho Chi Minh and his associates envisioned three phases.{{sfn|Huynh|1982|p=70}} In the first phase, an external center was to be established as a training center, source of unified political [[propaganda]] and headquarters for strategic decision-making and the maintenance of organizational and [[ideology|ideological discipline]].{{sfn|Huynh|1982|p=70}} Secret revolutionary groups called "cells" were to be trained in Canton and returned to Vietnam to operate.{{sfn|Huynh|1982|p=71}}

In the second phase, activity would become "semi-secret", in which Thanh Niên [[cadres]] would initiate political and economic activities, including [[strike action]], [[boycott]]s and protests, which might include [[political violence]] as a means of mobilizing the masses.{{sfn|Huynh|1982|p=71}} A third, insurrection phase, would rise up and overthrow the established political regime by force of arms, establishing a new revolutionary government.{{sfn|Huynh|1982|p=71}}

Thanh Niên was conceived of as a relatively open [[mass organization]], with the most trusted members part of a directing center called the Communist Youth Corps (CYC).{{sfn|Huynh|1982|p=66}} At the time of Thanh Nien's dissolution in 1929, the CYC is believed to have consisted of 24 members.{{sfn|Huynh|1982|pp=78–79}} In addition to Thanh Nien, this small inner circle directed two other mass organizations, Nong Hoi ("Peasants' Association") and Cong Hoi ("Workers' Association").{{sfn|Huynh|1982|p=79}}

The CYC and Thanh Niên published pamphlets and newspapers, including a guidebook of revolutionary theory and practical techniques called ''The Road to Revolution,'' as well as four newspapers—''Thanh Nien'' ("Youth") from June 1925 to May 1930; ''Bao cong nong'' ("Worker-Peasant") from December 1926 to early 1928; ''Linh kach menh'' ("Revolutionary Soldier") from early 1927 to early 1928; and ''Viet Nam tien phong'' ("Vanguard of Vietnam") in 1927.{{sfn|Huynh|1982|p=67}}

=== Factional split of 1929 ===

[[File:Indochine française (1913).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Within [[French Indochina]], Vietnam was divided into the administrative regions of [[Tonkin (French protectorate)|Tonkin]] in the North, [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]] along the Central coast and [[French Cochinchina|Cochinchina]] in the South.]]

In 1928 Thanh Niên was forced into hiding by the Chinese [[Kuomintang]] (KMT).{{sfn|Huynh|1982|p=76}} The center had to be moved repeatedly to avoid repression—first to [[Wu-Chou]] and then to Hong Kong.{{sfn|Huynh|1982|p=114}} Ho Chi Minh departed Canton in May 1927 and was incommunicado with the Vietnamese movement.{{sfn|Huynh|1982|p=114}} The lack of contacts with a unified headquarters catalyzed an organizational split, with movement radicals beginning to take instructions from the [[Comintern]] via the [[Communist Party of France]] and others following a different path.{{sfn|Huynh|1982|p=76}}

In September 1928 the radical Bac Ky Regional Committee of Thanh Niên held a conference at which it affirmed Comintern's new [[Third Period]] analysis, positing a revolutionary upsurge around the world.{{sfn|Huynh|1982|p=109}} Noting the growth of the organization among intellectuals in urban centers, the conference determined to send its largely [[petty bourgeois]] membership into the countryside and to urban factories in an attempt to bring communist ideas to the poor peasantry and the numerically tiny [[working class]].{{sfn|Huynh|1982|pp=110–111}} In a letter to Comintern, Thanh Niên estimated that approximately 90 percent of its membership consisted of intellectuals; a full-scale offensive to win mass support was desired.{{sfn|Huynh|1982|p=111}}

The Central Committee of Thanh Niên called a National Congress of the organization, slated to begin on [[May Day]] of 1929.{{sfn|Huynh|1982|p=116}} This gathering, held 1–9 May 1929 and attended by 17 delegates from each of the three main administrative districts of Vietnam, plus Hong Kong and [[Siam]], would prove the occasion for a split between those who placed primary emphasis on the so-called "national question" (independence from colonialism) and those who sought social revolution.{{sfn|Huynh|1982|pp=116–118}} Ho Chi Minh was not in attendance, still missing from the scene.{{sfn|Huynh|1982|pp=116–118}} The conclave was chaired by Nguyen Cong Vien, making use of the pseudonym Lam Duc Thu, who summarily ruled the question of formation of a proper [[Communist party]] out of order, prompting a walkout of three members of the northern delegation, leaving only an informer working on behalf of the French [[secret police]] at the session as the [[Tonkin]] representative.{{sfn|Huynh|1982|pp=116–118}}

The walkouts were sharply critical of those who refused to split, charging the remaining Thanh Niên leaders as "false revolutionaries" and "petit-bourgeois intellectuals" who were attempting to build bridges with the "anti-revolutionary and anti-worker" Kuomintang.{{sfn|Huynh|1982|p=119}} On 17 June more than 20 delegates from cells throughout the Tonkin region held a conference in [[Hanoi]], where they declared the dissolution of Thanh Niên and the establishment of a new organization called the [[Communist Party of Indochina]] (ICP).{{sfn|Huynh|1982|p=120}}

The new Northern party published pamphlets detailing its rules based upon Comintern's "Model Statutes for a Communist Party" as well as the International program approved by the Sixth World Congress of Comintern in 1928.{{sfn|Huynh|1982|p=120}} Three periodicals were launched—the newspaper ''Co do'' ("Red Flag"), the theoretical journal ''Bua liem'' ("Hammer and Sickle") and the trade union publication ''Cong hoi do'' ("Red Trade Union").{{sfn|Huynh|1982|p=120}}

The other faction, based in the central and southern administrative districts of the country, named itself the [[Communist Party of Annam]] in the fall.{{sfn|Huynh|1982|p=120}} The two organizations spent the rest of 1929 engaged in a polemical battle in an attempt to gain hegemony over the movement.{{sfn|Huynh|1982|p=122}}

A third Vietnamese communist party emerged around this time, unconnected with Thanh Niên called the League of Indochinese Communists (&lt;small&gt;''Vietnamese:''&lt;/small&gt; Đông Dương Cộng sản Liên Đoàn).{{sfn|Huynh|1982|p=122}} This group had its roots in another national liberation group which had existed as a rival to Thanh Niên.{{sfn|Huynh|1982|p=122}}

== 1930: Communist Party of Vietnam ==

The two warring offspring of Thanh Niên joined with individual members of a third Marxist group founded by [[Phan Bội Châu]] at a "Unification Conference" held in Hong Kong from 3–7 February 1930.{{sfn|Kolko|1985|p=27}} Ho Chi Minh became active again and was responsible for brokering the peace, as well as writing the initial manifesto and statement of tactics of the group.{{sfn|Kolko|1985|p=27}} The new party was named the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV).

The Hong Kong conference (held in [[Kowloon City]]) elected a nine-member Provisional Central Committee consisting of 3 members from [[Tonkin (French protectorate)|Tonkin]] in the North, 2 from the central region of [[Annam (French Colony)|Annam]], 2 from the southern district [[French cochinchina|Cochinchina]] and 2 from the émigré Vietnamese community in China.&lt;ref name="asian"&gt;[http://www.asianartmall.com/Ho%20Chi%20Minh.html "Ho Chi Minh and the Communist Movement,"] asianartmall.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The latter group had previously been organized within the [[South Seas Communist Party]].&lt;ref name="asian"/&gt;

Comintern was sharply critical of the way in which the organization was unified, decrying the Vietnamese's party's failure to eliminate so-called "heterogeneous elements".{{sfn|Huynh|1982|p=127}} The organization's declared emphasis upon national liberation under the [[slogan]] "An Independent Viet Nam" was criticized as a manifestation of [[nationalism]], while the party's emphasis on its role in the international communist movement was deemed insufficient.{{sfn|Huynh|1982|p=128}} A new conference was demanded, labeled the "First Plenum of the Central Committee."{{sfn|Huynh|1982|p=126}} The session was held in Hong Kong in October 1930 and renamed the organization the [[Indochinese Communist Party]] (&lt;small&gt;''Vietnamese:''&lt;/small&gt; Đông Dương Cộng sản Đảng) (ICP) to mark Comintern's imposed changes.

At the time it formally came into being, ICP could claim to be a vanguard of only a small working class – a mere 221,000 people in a country of 17 million. Even of this minority, most were far removed from modern industry, with one-third of these employed in various capacities on [[rubber plantation]]s and the like.{{sfn|Kolko|1985|p=16}} The working class in the North was semi-peasant in nature, leaving work in the mines and factories for the [[Tết|Tết festival]] that marked the start of the new year, often not returning. Working conditions were poor and [[turnover (employment)|labor turnover]] high.{{sfn|Kolko|1985|p=17}}

During its first five years ICP membership reached about 1500, plus a large additional contingent of sympathizers. Despite the group's small size, it exerted influence in a turbulent Vietnamese social climate. Back-to-back bad harvests in 1929 and 1930 combined with an onerous debt burden served to radicalize many peasants. In the industrial city of [[Vinh]] [[May Day]] demonstrations were organized by ICP activists, which gained critical mass when families of semi-peasant workers joined demonstrations as a means of venting their dissatisfaction.{{sfn|Kolko|1985|p=28}}

As three May Day marches grew into mass rallies, French colonial authorities moved to squelch what they perceived to be dangerous [[peasant revolt]]s. Government forces fired upon the assembled crowd, killing dozens of participants and inflaming the population. In response local councils sprung up in various villages in an effort to govern themselves as the revolt spread. Repression began in the fall, with some 1,300 eventually killed by the French and many times more imprisoned or deported. General Secretary Tran Phu and many leaders of the Central Committee were arrested and killed. While ICP was effectively wiped out in the region, popular memory lived on.{{sfn|Kolko|1985|p=28}} Lê Hồng Phong was assigned from Comintern to restore the movement.

=== Popular Front period (1935–1939) ===

The First National Party Congress was held in secret in [[Macau]] in 1935. At the same time, a Comintern Congress in Moscow adopted a policy towards a [[popular front]] against [[Fascism]] and directed [[Communist]] movements around the world to collaborate with anti-fascist forces regardless of their orientation towards [[socialism]]. This required ICP to regard all nationalist parties in [[French Indochina|Indochina]] as potential allies.

[[Hà Huy Tập]] was appointed General Secretary (instead of Lê Hồng Phong).

=== World War II ===
[[Image:Giap-Ho.jpg|thumb|250px|Võ Nguyên Giáp (left) and Hồ Chí Minh in Hà Nội, October 1945]]

The Second World War drastically weakened France's grasp on Indochina. The [[Battle of France|fall of France]] to [[Nazi Germany]] in May 1940 and [[Vichy France]]'s subsequent collaboration with the Axis powers served to delegitimize French claims to ownership. Preoccupation with the European war made colonial governance from France impossible and the country was occupied by the forces of [[imperial Japan]].{{sfn|Kolko|1985|p=30}}

ICP instructed its members to move to rural areas and to go into hiding as an underground organization. Despite this preventive measure, more than 2,000 party members were imprisoned, including many key leaders.{{sfn|Kolko|1985|p=30}} Party activists were particularly hard hit in the southern region of Cochinchina, where the previously strong organization was wiped out by arrests and killings. After an uprising in Cochinchina in 1940, most of the Central Committee leaders were arrested, killed, including [[Nguyễn Văn Cừ (revolutionary)|Nguyễn Văn Cừ]] (General Secretary), Hà Huy Tập; and Lê Hồng Phong was deported to [[Côn Đảo]] and died later.{{sfn|Kolko|1985|p=31}}

Following the elimination of the old leadership, a new group emerged, including [[Trường Chinh]], [[Phạm Văn Đồng]] and [[Võ Nguyên Giáp]]—individuals who together with Ho Chi Minh would provide a unified leadership over the ensuing decades.{{sfn|Kolko|1985|pp=30–31}}

Ho Chi Minh returned to Vietnam in February 1941 and established a military organization known as the [[Viet Minh|League for the Independence of Vietnam]] (&lt;small&gt;''Vietnamese:''&lt;/small&gt; Việt Nam Độc Lập Đồng Minh Hội, commonly "Viet Minh").{{sfn|Kolko|1985|p=30}} The Viet Minh originally downplayed their social objectives, painting themselves as a patriotic organization battling for national independence to garner maximum public support against the Japanese military occupation.{{sfn|Kolko|1985|p=31}} As the most uncompromising force fighting the occupation, the Viet Minh gained popular recognition and legitimacy in what would develop into a political vacuum.{{sfn|Kolko|1985|p=32}}

Ho Chi Minh's personal fate was not an easy one. With his organization underarmed and its bases isolated, Ho traveled to China in August 1942 seeking Allied military aid. Ho was arrested by the Nationalist government and subjected to 14 months of brutal imprisonment, followed by another year of restricted movement. Ho was unable to return to Vietnam until September 1944. The Communist Party and its Viet Minh offshoot managed to prosper without him. Despite its position as the core of the Viet Minh organization, the Indochinese Communist Party remained very small through the war years, with an estimated membership of 2–3,000 in 1944.{{sfn|Kolko|1985|p=32}}

ICP launched an uprising in 1945, the [[August Revolution]] that freed Le Duan and other party faithful.

=== Dissolution and reformation ===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2013}}
The ICP formally dissolved in 1945 to hide its Communist affiliation and its activities were folded into the Marxism Research Association and the Viet Minh. Its remnants functioned as the core of the Viet Minh. The [[CIA]] estimated that membership grew over the years as follows: 50,000 members (1946), 400,000 members (1950).

The Party was re-founded as the Workers Party of Vietnam (Đảng lao động Việt Nam) at the 2nd Congress in [[Tuyên Quang]] in 1951. The Congress decided to split into three parties, one each for Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. At the time the party had 766,349 members. The Third National Congress, held in Hanoi in 1960, formalized the tasks of constructing socialism in what was by then [[North Vietnam]] and committed the party to liberation in the South. The party had some 500,000 members (both north and south). At the 4th Congress in 1976, the Workers Party of North Vietnam merged with the [[People's Revolutionary Party (Vietnam)|People's Revolutionary Party]] of South Vietnam to form the Communist Party of Vietnam. At the time, the party had 1,550,000 members.

== Ruling party (1976–present)==
On 2 July 1976, South Vietnam and North Vietnam were reunified to form the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. CPV retained its power.

=== 4th Congress (1976–1982) ===

The 4th Congress consisted of 1,008 delegates. A new policy for socialist construction was approved, the [[Second Five-Year Plan (Vietnam)|Second Five-Year Plan]] (1976–80) was approved and several amendments were made to the party constitution. The new approach emphasized building socialism domestically, while at the same time supporting socialist expansion abroad. The party's economic goal at the time was to build a strong and prosperous socialist country over 20 years by skipping the stage of capitalist development.{{sfn|Van|Cooper|p=55}} The Second Five-Year Plan failed utterly and during the period between the 4th and 5th Party Congresses, heated debate about economic policy took place. The first was at the 6th Central Committee plenum of the 4th Congress in September 1979, but the most revealing discussion  occurred at the 10th Central Committee plenum of the 4th Congress that lasted form 9 October to 3 November 1981. The plenum adopted a reformist line, but it was forced to moderate its position when several grass-root chapters objected.

=== 5th Congress (1982–1986) ===
{{see|5th Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam}}
At the 5th National Congress, held in March 1982, [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam|General Secretary]] [[Lê Duẩn]] said the party had to reach two goals; the first was to construct socialism and the second was to protect Vietnam from Chinese aggression, giving priority to socialist construction.{{sfn|Võ|1990|p=125}} The party leadership acknowledged the failure of the Second Five-Year Plan, claiming that it was their failure to grasp the economic and social conditions which aggravated the country's economic problems.{{sfn|Võ|1990|p=126}} The [[Third Five-Year Plan (Vietnam)|Third Five-Year Plan]] (1981–85) emphasized the need to improve living conditions and the need for more industrial investment, but [[Agriculture in Vietnam|agriculture]] was given top priority. Other points were to improve planning, trade relations with [[COMECON]], the [[Lao People's Democratic Republic]] and the [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]].{{sfn|Võ|1990|p=127}}

{{quote box |quote = On the days that our party was fighting for power, it depended on the people for support. Now, the possession of power is likely to lead to alienation from the masses, arrogance and high-handedness, greed and embezzlement, bureaucratism and authoritarianism in economic and ideological leadership. All this must be strongly criticised and condemned.|Nguyễn Văn Linh in a press conference where he talked about the need to relax state censorship and allow more freedom of expression in general.{{sfn|Largo|2002|p=2}}|}}

While Lê Duẩn continued to believe in the Third Five-Year Plan,{{sfn|Võ|1990|p=141}} leading members within the Communist Party were losing their trust in the system. It was in this mood in 1985 that market prices were introduced. This led to a period of [[inflation]] that reached over 100%.{{sfn|Võ|1990|pp=165–166}} The Third Five-Year Plan also failed.{{sfn|Võ|1990|p=168}} Lê Duẩn died on 10 July 1986, months short of the [[6th National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam|6th Party Congress]].{{sfn|Corfield|2008|pp=111–112}} A [[Politburo of the Communist Party of Vietnam|Politburo]] meeting held 25–30 August 1986, paved the way for more radical reforms. In an ironic twist, the new reform movement was led by the former [[Maoism|Maoist]]-[[Stalinism|Stalinist]] hardliner [[Trường Chinh]].{{sfn|Võ|1990|p=181}}

=== 6th Congress (1986–1991)===
{{see|6th Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam}}
At the 6th Congress, [[Nguyễn Văn Linh]] was elected General Secretary – a victory for the party's old guard reformers. The new leadership would later launch [[Đổi Mới]] and establish the framework for a [[socialist-oriented market economy]].{{sfn|Võ|1990|pp=183–185}} The economic reforms were initiated alongside a relaxation of state censorship and increased freedom of expression.{{sfn|Largo|2002|p=2}}

The [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of communism]] in the [[Eastern Bloc]] and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 led the Vietnamese leadership to distinguish between economic and political reform – believing the former led to the fall of communism in Eastern Europe. Despite vague references to "[[imperialism|imperialist]] and reactionary forces", the party asserted that the changes in Europe were because of its lack of reform, or the unsuccessful implementation of reform. The Draft Platform for the Building of Socialism in the Transition Period was created at the Central Committee meeting of 17–26 November 1990, to prepare for the upcoming [[7th National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam|7th Congress]]. It declared that socialism, "regardless of the tortuous path ahead", was the right path and the communist movement would be revitalized in the face of [[capitalism]]'s own contradictions.{{sfn|Jeffries|1993|p=238}}

=== 7th Congress (1991–1996) ===
{{see|7th Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam}}
At the 7th Party Congress, Nguyễn Văn Linh retired from active politics. He reaffirmed Vietnam's commitment to socialism.{{sfn|Jeffries|1993|p=238}} [[Đỗ Mười]], a conservative, succeeded Nguyễn Văn Linh as General Secretary, [[Võ Văn Kiệt]], the leading communist reformer, was appointed [[Prime Minister of Vietnam|prime minister]] and [[Lê Đức Anh]], a conservative communist, was appointed [[President of Vietnam|president]].{{sfn|Largo|2002|p=3}}

In the aftermath of the 7th Party Congress, the conservatives tried to retake control of the Party. In 1994, four new members were appointed to the [[7th Politburo of the Communist Party of Vietnam|7th Politburo]], all of whom opposed more radical reform. Despite conservative maneuvering, the reform proved highly successful and economic growth between the 7th and [[8th National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam|8th Party Congress]] averaged 8 percent.{{sfn|Largo|2002|p=4}} While the growth figures were impressive, sustaining growth run required ongoing reforms – however, such reforms, it was believed, would lead to instability and maybe even threaten the Communist Party's hold on power. The conservatives opposed change for that reason, while the reformers held that change was the only way to develop the economy. The [[1997 Asian financial crisis|Asian financial crisis of the late-1990s]] shrank growth to 2 percent annually.{{sfn|Largo|2002|p=5}}

====Infighting====
Factional infighting broke out between the 7th and 8th Party Congresses, crippling the country's leadership. While reformers led by Võ Văn Kiệt wanted to open Vietnam to the global economy via a [[neo-liberalism|neo-liberal]] approach – which meant a total break with [[Leninism|Leninist economics]] – conservatives wanted Vietnam's [[state-owned enterprises]] to dominate and pointed to the success of [[Four Asia Tigers]]. The party that had worked via consensus was breaking apart rapidly.

In a 1995 letter to the Politburo, which was later leaked to the press, Võ Văn Kiệt wrote "in order to mobilize the genius of all within party, there must be uncompromising democracy."{{sfn|Largo|2002|p=7}} He lambasted the conservatives, claiming that the state-owned sector had to shrink in favor of the private sector and that Vietnam had to forsake its relations with the remaining [[socialist state]]s. He advised the party to stop meddling in government affairs and put national interest above government affairs. In response, conservatives sent [[Nguyen Ha Phan|Nguyễn Hà Phan]] around the country to criticise Võ Văn Kiệt, who he claimed was deviating from socialism.{{sfn|Largo|2002|p=7}} As the power struggle continued, Chief of Staff [[Đào Đình Luyện]] was demoted for his support of the reformist line and Nguyễn Hà Phan was demoted from the Politburo and put under [[house arrest]] on charges of treason in April 1996.

During these hard times, conservatives launched a campaign led by [[Đào Duy Tùng]], the editor-in-chief of ''[[Communist Review]]'' (Vietnamese: ''Tạp chí Cộng Sản'').{{sfn|Corfield|2008|p=119}} Thanks to his support within the party, Đào Duy Tùng attained unprecedented control over personnel appointment and the drafting of the Political Report to the 8th Party Congress. However, at the 10th Central Committee meeting of the 7th Party Congress, he was accused of "anti-democratic behaviour" and abuse of power and because of it, he was not reelected to the Politburo, attaining only 10 percent of the vote.

=== 8th Congress (1996–2001)===

The fall of Đào Duy Tùng, Đỗ Mười's planned successor, led to a compromise solution where the general secretary, prime minister and president were reelected at the 8th Party Congress because of the lack of a majority driven by the conservative – reformist power struggle.{{sfn|Largo|2002|p=8}} However, a significant turnover within the party leadership occurred and for the first time in years, the central leadership lost ground to the provincial party branches and government bureaucrats – only 8.9 percent of the new Central Committee members came from the central party apparatus, while 67 percent of the new members had either an immediate provincial background or a government background.{{sfn|Largo|2002|p=8}}

The first sign of the future transition came when President Lê Đức Anh suffered a stroke in 1996. With a leading conservative incapacitated, reformers led by Võ Văn Kiệt launched an unsuccessful campaign for power. At the June 1997 Central Committee meeting, both Lê Đức Anh and Võ Văn Kiệt confirmed their resignation to the 9th National Assembly, the assembly would be dissolved in September 1997. Đỗ Mười, it seems, tried to hold on to his post until 2001. [[Phan Văn Khải]] was approved as Võ Văn Kiệt's successor and the relatively unknown [[Trần Đức Lương]] succeeded Lê Đức Anh as President because of conservative infighting.{{sfn|Largo|2002|pp=10–11}} At the 4th Central Committee plenum of the 8th Congress, [[Lê Khả Phiêu]], a conservative military man, was elected General Secretary with backing from the reformers – again, the conservatives were troubled by infighting and they had trouble choosing a candidate for the post of General Secretary; they went through Đoàn Khuê, [[Nông Đức Mạnh]], Nguyễn Đức Bình, Nguyễn Thị Xuân Mỹ, Lê Minh Hương, Lê Xuân Tùng and Phạm Thế Duyệt until they settled for [[Nguyễn Văn An]], but by then it was too late.{{sfn|Largo|2002|p=12}}

====Lê Khả Phiêu====
Unlike his predecessors, Lê Khả Phiêu represented a compromise among the factions. Because of this, Lê Khả Phiêu entered his secretaryship with a handicap.{{sfn|Abuza|2001|pp=3–4}} Another problem facing him was his lack of a patronage network. He had previously worked as the Head of the General Political Department, but he was unpopular among several of his military colleagues.{{sfn|Abuza|2001|p=5}} The Asian financial crisis and the power struggle within the party crippled efficient administration, presenting Lê Khả Phiêu with a daunting task. While the conservatives believed Vietnam could weather the storm, the reformers believed Vietnam could revitalise its economy by introducing a radical reform package. The conservatives blamed the crisis on the deficiencies of capitalism and believed Vietnam's lack of integration with the global economy was a blessing, while the reformers blamed "[[crony capitalism]]", which occurred because of imperfect markets and government intervention.{{sfn|Abuza|2001|p=6}}

Lê Khả Phiêu took a subdued approach, weighing in only at the ends of discussions, instead of leading them.{{sfn|Abuza|2001|p=8}} The devolution of authority from the Central Committee had increased rapidly since the 6th Party Congress. Provincial-level officials first felt the pinch of the economic crisis and were the most eager to launch reforms. This led to Lê Khả Phiêu's downfall in 2001. While he was able to persuade the Politburo to keep him as general secretary (a two-third majority voted in favor of retaining him), the 12th Central Committee plenum of the 8th Party Congress overturned the Politburo's decision and ousted him.{{sfn|Abuza|2001|pp=9–12}} Nông Đức Mạnh succeeded Lê Khả Phiêu in 2001 as general secretary in the immediate aftermath of the [[9th National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam|9th Party Congress]].{{sfn|Abuza|2001|p=14}}

The foundation of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] ({{lang-de|Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands}}, SPD) can be traced back to the 1860s, and for much of the 20th and 21st centuries it has represented the centre-left in German politics. The SPD has been the ruling party at several points, first under [[Friedrich Ebert]] in 1918. The party was outlawed in Nazi Germany but returned to government in 1969 with [[Willy Brandt]]. Meanwhile, the [[East German]] branch of the SPD was merged with the ruling [[Communist Party of Germany|KPD]]. In the modern [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]], the SPD are the second largest party after the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] and are currently (as of 2017) in government as a junior coalition partner to Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]]'s CDU. The SPD last held the chancellorship under [[Gerhard Schröder]] from 1998 to 2005.

==Social Democracy in Germany until 1945==

=== Imperial Germany 1863–1918 ===
&lt;!--Linked to from Adolf Stoecker--&gt;
The party was founded on May 23, 1863, by [[Ferdinand Lassalle]] under the name ''Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein'' (ADAV, [[General German Workers' Association]]). In 1869, [[August Bebel]] and [[Wilhelm Liebknecht]] founded the ''Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei'' (SDAP, [[Social Democratic Workers' Party of Germany]]), which merged with the ADAV at a conference held in Gotha in 1875, taking the name ''Socialist Workers' Party of Germany'' (SAPD). At this conference, the party developed the [[Gotha Program]], which [[Karl Marx]] criticized in his ''[[Critique of the Gotha Program]]''. Through the [[Anti-Socialist Laws]], [[Otto von Bismarck]] had the party outlawed for its pro-revolution, anti-monarchy sentiments in 1878; but in 1890 it was legalized again. That same year - in its [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] convention - it changed its name to ''Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands'' (SPD), as it is known to this day.

Anti-socialist campaigns were counterproductive. 1878–90 was the SPD's 'heroic period'. The party's new program drawn up in 1891 at Halle was more radical than 1875's Gotha program. From 1881 to 1890 the party's support increased faster than in any other period. In 1896, the National Liberals and Conservatives in [[Saxony]] replaced the democratic vote with a Prussian-style three-tiered suffrage, upper class votes counting the most. They did this to drive out the local SPD which lost its last seat in 1901. However, in the 1903 election the number of socialist deputies increased from 11 to 22 out of 23.&lt;ref&gt;Retallack, Imperial Germany, page 187&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-14077-0005, August Bebel.jpg|thumb|[[August Bebel]] in 1863, co-chairman from 1892 to 1913]]Because Social Democrats could be elected as list-free candidates while the party was outlawed, SPD continued to be a growing force in the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]], becoming the strongest party in 1912 (in imperial Germany, the parliamentary balance of forces had no influence on the formation of the cabinet). During this period, SPD deputies in the Reichstag were able to win some improvements in working and living conditions for working-class Germans,&lt;ref name="country-data"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-4869.html|publisher=country-data.com|title=Germany - Political Parties|accessdate=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; thereby advancing the cause of its policies in a general way and securing material benefits for its supporters.&lt;ref name="Guttsman"&gt;The German Social Democratic Party, 1875–1933: From Ghetto To Government by W. L. Guttsman&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Landtag]], the SPD was able to extract some concessions from time to time in areas for which the assembly was responsible, such as education and social policy. In Hesse, the party was successful in demanding that church tax be listed separately in assessments, and it was able to secure improvements in judicial procedure. The SPD also had occasional successes in raising wages and improving the working conditions of municipal labourers.&lt;ref name="Guttsman"/&gt;

SPD pressure in the Reichstag in the late nineteenth century supported an expansion in the system of factory inspection, together with a minor reform in military service under which the families of reservists, called up for training or manoeuvres, could receive an allowance. In the 1880s, SPD deputies in Saxony successfully agitated in support of improved safety for miners and better control of mines.&lt;ref name="Guttsman"/&gt;

In 1908, the same year the government legalized women's participation in politics, [[Luise Zietz]] became the first woman appointed to the executive committee of the SPD.&lt;ref name="Biesinger2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph A.

Despite the passage of anti-socialist legislation, the SPD continued to grow in strength in the early twentieth century, with a steady rise in membership from 384,327 in 1905/06 to 1,085,905 in 1913/14. SPD was seen as a populist party, and people from every quarter of German society sought help and advice from it. With its counseling service (provided free of charge by the mostly trade union maintained workers’ secretarial offices), the German social democratic movement helped large numbers of Germans to secure their legal rights, primarily in social security. There also existed a dynamic educational movement, with hundreds of courses and individual lectures, theatre performances, libraries, peripatetic teachers, a central school for workers’ education, and a famous Party School, as noted by the historians Susanne Miller and Heinrich Potthoff,

{{cquote|With all of this, the SPD and the Free Trade Unions were not only delivering the necessary tools for the political and social struggle, but were also a cultural movement in the widest sense of the term.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;The Social Democratic Party of Germany 1848–2005 by Heinrich Potthoff and Susanne Miller{{page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Growth in strength did not initially translate into larger numbers in the Reichstag. The original constituencies had been drawn at the empire's formation in 1871, when Germany was almost two-thirds rural. They were never redrawn to reflect the dramatic growth of Germany's cities in the 1890s. By the turn of the century, the urban-rural ratio was reversed, and almost two-thirds of all Germans lived in cities and towns. Even with this change, the party still managed to become the largest single faction in the Reichstag at the 1912 elections. It would be the largest party in Germany for the next two decades.

In the states of [[Bavaria]], [[Wurttemberg]], [[Hesse]], and [[Baden]], the SPD was successful in extracting various socio-political and democratic concessions (including the replacement of the class-based electoral systems with universal suffrage) through electoral alliances with bourgeois parties, voting for parliamentary bills and state budgets. In the Reichstag, the SPD resorted to a policy of tactical compromise in order to exert direct influence on legislation. In 1894, the parliamentary SPD voted for a government bill for the first time ever. It reduced the import duty on wheat, which led to a reduction in the price of food. In 1913, the votes of SPD parliamentarians helped to bring in new tax laws affecting the wealthy, which were necessary due to the increase in military spending.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;

The Social Democrats gave particular attention to carrying out reforms at the local level, founding a tradition of community politics which intensified after 1945. The establishment of local labour exchanges and the introduction of unemployment benefits can be credited in part to the SPD. In 1913, the number of Social Democrats on municipal and district councils approached 13,000. As noted by Heinrich Potthoff and Susanne Miller,

{{cquote|“Here, and in their work in the administration of industrial insurance, in community employment offices and courts of arbitration, lay one of the roots of the gradual penetration by the Social Democrats of the imperial German state.”&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;The Social Democratic Party of Germany 1848–2005 by Heinrich Potthoff and Susanne Miller{{page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As Sally Waller wrote, the SPD encouraged great loyalty from its members by organising educational courses, choral societies, sports clubs, and libraries. The party also ran welfare clinics, founded libraries, produced newspapers, and organised holidays, rallies, and festivals. As also noted by Weller, they played a role in shaping a number of progressive reforms:

{{cquote|“The SPD also helped promote Germany’s extensive system of welfare support giving Germany the most comprehensive system of social insurance in Europe by 1913. They pressed successfully for some constitutional changes like the secret ballot (1904) and payment of MPs (1906), which permitted lower middle and working-class men, with no other income, to put themselves forward as deputies for the Reichstag. In 1911, they supported measures whereby Alsace-Lorraine was given Reichstag representation and universal male suffrage at 21 years was introduced. They also successfully resisted the taxation proposals that would hit the working man harder and promoted progressive taxes, whereby those with the most would be forced to pay more.”&lt;ref&gt;AQA History: The Development of Germany, 1871–1925 by Sally Waller&lt;/ref&gt;}}

And in this from historian Richard M. Watt:

{{cquote|“The political and organizational success of the Social Democrats had enabled them to demand and obtain a respectable body of legislation incorporating social reform, outlawing child labor and improving working conditions and wages, to the point where the German Social Democratic Party was the model for socialist parties in every other nation, and the German worker the most envied in Continental Europe.”&lt;ref&gt;The Kings Depart: The Tragedy of Germany: Versailles and the German Revolution by Richard M. Watt&lt;/ref&gt;}}
====Erfurt Program of 1891====
As a reaction to government prosecution, the [[Erfurt Program]] of 1891 was more radical than the Gotha Program of 1875, demanding [[nationalization]] of Germany's major industries. However, the party began to move away from [[revolutionary socialism]] at the turn of the 20th century. [[Eduard Bernstein|Bernstein]] authored a series of articles on the ''Problems of Socialism'' between 1896 and 1898, and later a book, ''Die Voraussetzungen des Sozialismus und die Aufgaben der Sozialdemokratie'' ("The Prerequisites for Socialism and the Tasks of Social Democracy"), published in 1899, in which he argued that the winning of reforms under capitalism would be enough to bring about socialism. Radical party activist [[Rosa Luxemburg]] accused Bernstein of [[Marxist revisionism|revisionism]] and argued against his ideas in her pamphlet [[Social Reform or Revolution]], and Bernstein's program was not adopted by the party.
 
====First World War====
Conservative elites nevertheless became alarmed at SPD growth--especially after it won 35% of the national vote in [[German federal election, 1912|the 1912 elections]]. Some elites looked to a foreign war as a solution to Germany's internal problems. SPD policy limited antimilitarism to aggressive wars--Germans saw 1914 as a defensive war.  On 25 July 1914, the SPD leadership appealed to its membership to demonstrate for peace and large numbers turned out in orderly demonstrations.  The SPD was not revolutionary and many members were nationalistic. When the war began, some conservatives wanted to use force to suppress the SPD, but Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg wisely refused.  However, the increasing loyalty of the party establishment towards Emperor and Reich, coupled with its antipathy toward Russia led the party under Bebel's successor [[Friedrich Ebert]] to support the war. The SPD members of parliament voted 96-14 on 3 August 1914 to support the war. They next voted the money for the war, but resisted demands for an aggressive peace policy that would involve takeover of new territories.&lt;ref&gt;V. R. Berghahn, ''Germany and the Approach of War in 1914'' (1974) pp 178-85 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Dieter Groh, "The 'Unpatriotic Socialists' and the State." ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 1.4 (1966): 151-177. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/259895 online]. &lt;/ref&gt;

There remained an antiwar element especially in Berlin.  They were expelled from the SPD in 1916 and formed the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany]]. Bernstein left the party during the war, as did [[Karl Kautsky]], who had played an important role as the leading Marxist theoretician and editor of the theoretical journal of SPD, “[[Die Neue Zeit]]”. Neither joined the Communist party after the war; they both came back to the SPD in the early 1920s, From 1915 on theoretical discussions within the SPD were dominated by a group of former [[Anti-Revisionism|anti-revisionist]] Marxists, who tried to legitimize the support of the First World War by the German SPD group in the Reichstag with Marxist arguments. Instead of the class struggle they proclaimed the struggle of peoples and developed much of the rhetoric later used by Nazi propaganda (“Volksgemeinschaft” etc.). The group was led by [[Heinrich Cunow]], [[Paul Lensch]] and [[Konrad Haenisch]] (“Lensch-Cunow-Haenisch-Gruppe”) and was close to the Russian-German revolutionary and social scientist [[Parvus]], who gave a public forum to the group with his journal “Die Glocke”. From the teachings of [[Kurt Schumacher]] and Professor [[Johann Plenge]], there is a link to the current right-wing “[[Seeheimer Kreis]]” within the SPD founded by [[Annemarie Renger]], Schumacher's former secretary.

Those against the war were expelled from the SPD in January 1917 (including [[Rosa Luxemburg]], [[Karl Liebknecht]] and [[Hugo Haase]]) - the expelees went on to found the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany]], in which the [[Spartacist League]] was influential.

====1918 revolution====
In the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|1918 revolution]], Ebert controversially sided with the [[Reichswehr|Imperial Army command]] against communists, while the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] elected him as [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|head of the new government]].

A revolutionary government met for the first time in November 1918. Known as the Council of People's Commissioners, it consisted of three Majority Social Democrats ([[Friedrich Ebert]], [[Philipp Scheidemann]], and [[Otto Landsberg]]) and three United Social Democrats ([[Emil Barth]], [[Wilhelm Dittman]], and [[Hugo Haase]]). The new government faced a social crisis in the German Reich following the end of the First World War, with Germany threatened by hunger and chaos. There was, for the most part, an orderly return of soldiers back into civilian life, while the threat of starvation was combated.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt; Wage levels were raised,&lt;ref&gt;Comparative Economic Systems, Volume 3 by Richard L. Carson&lt;/ref&gt; universal proportional representation for all parliaments was introduced, and a series of regulations on unemployment benefits, job-creation and protection measures, health insurance,&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt; and pensions&lt;ref&gt;Weimar Germany by Anthony McElligott&lt;/ref&gt; saw the institution of important political and social reforms. In February 1918, workers made an agreement with employers which secured them total freedom of association, the legal guarantee of an [[eight-hour day|eight-hour workday]], and the extension of wage agreements to all branches of trade and industry. The People's Commissioners made these changes legally binding.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt; In addition, the SPD-steered provisional government introduced binding state arbitration of labor conflicts, created worker's councils in large industrial firms, and opened the path to the unionization of rural labourers.&lt;ref&gt;German History in Modern Times: Four Lives of the Nation by William W. Hagan&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1918, a decree was passed providing relief for the unemployed. This provided that communities were to be responsible for unemployment relief (without fixing an amount) and established that the Reich would contribute 50% and the respective German state 33% of the outlay. That same month, the government declared that labour exchanges were to be further developed with the financial assistance of the Reich. Responsibility for job placement was first transferred from the Demobilization Office to the Minister of Labour and then to the National Employment Exchange Office, which came into being in January 1920.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Evolution of Social Insurance 1881–1981: Studies of Germany, France, Great Britain, Austria, and Switzerland edited by Peter A.

===Weimar Republic (1918–1933)===

Subsequently, the Social Democratic Party and the newly founded [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD), which consisted mostly of former members of the SPD, became bitter rivals, not least because of the legacy of the [[German Revolution]]. Under [[Defense Minister of Germany]] [[Gustav Noske]], the party aided in putting down the Communist and left wing [[Spartacist uprising]] throughout Germany in early 1919 with the use of the [[Freikorps]], a morally questionable decision that has remained the source of much controversy amongst historians to this day. While the KPD remained in staunch opposition to the newly established parliamentary system, the SPD became a part of the so-called [[Weimar Coalition]], one of the pillars of the struggling republic, leading several of the short-lived interwar [[cabinets]]. The threat of the Communists put the SPD in a difficult position. The party had a choice between becoming more radical (which could weaken the Communists but lose its base among the [[middle class]]) or stay moderate, which would damage its base among the working class. Splinter groups formed: In 1928, a small group calling itself [[Neu Beginnen]], in the autumn of 1931, the [[Socialist Workers' Party of Germany]], and in December 1931 the [[Iron Front]].

Under Weimar, the SPD was able put its ideas of social justice into practice by influencing a number of progressive social changes while both in and out of government. The SPD re-introduced and overhauled the Bismarckian welfare state, providing protection for the disadvantaged, the unemployed, the aged, and the young. The “Decree on Collective Agreements, Workers’ and Employees’ Committees, and the Settlement of Labour Disputes” of December 1918 boosted the legal effectiveness of collective bargaining contracts,&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt; while a number of measures were carried out to assist veterans, including the Decree on Social Provision for Disabled Veterans and Surviving Dependents of February 1919 and the Compensation Law for Re-enlisted Men and Officers of September 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Origins of the German Welfare State: Social Policy in Germany to 1945 by Michael Stolleis&lt;/ref&gt; The War Victims’ Benefits Law of May 1920 introduced a more generous war-disability system than had existed in the past.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=West Germany Under Construction: Politics, Society, and Culture in the Adenauer Era|author=Moeller, R.G.|date=1997|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472066483|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2E22iqWFrrYC&amp;pg=PA94|page=94|accessdate=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new piece of legislation took into account all grievances voiced during the war and, for the first time in social legislation in Germany, considered child maintenance in calculating widows’ pensions.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Behind the Lines: Gender and the Two World Wars|author=Higonnet, M.R.|date=1987|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300044294|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kdm3N-YMI9YC&amp;pg=PA134|page=134|accessdate=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, the federal government launched a campaign to recolonize parts of the German interior including in Silesia,&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=The German Revolution, 1918-1919|author=Lutz, R.H.|date=1922|issue=no. 1|publisher=The University|isbn=9780722223901|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qQg4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA101|page=101|accessdate=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and new provisions for maternity were introduced.&lt;ref name="hathitrust"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?q1=germany%201919;id=mdp.39015033605539;view=1up;seq=160;start=1;size=10;page=search;num=152#view=1up;seq=160|publisher=babel.hathitrust.org|title=The American labor legislation review. v.10-11 1920-21. - Full View &amp;#124; HathiTrust Digital Library &amp;#124; HathiTrust Digital Library|accessdate=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google4"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Politics of German Child Welfare from the Empire to the Federal Republic|author=Dickinson, E.R.|date=1996|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674688629|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yM0y7LOn6x0C&amp;pg=PA144|page=144|accessdate=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1920, an industrial relations law was passed, giving workers in industry legally guaranteed representation, together with the right to co-determination in cases of hiring and firing, holiday arrangements, the fixing of working hours and regulations, and the introduction of new methods of payment. A Socialisation Law was also passed, while the government adopted guidelines on the [[workers' council]]s. In addition to workers' councils at national, regional, and factory level, the government made provision for economic councils in which employers and employees would work together on matters affecting the economy as a whole (such as nationalisation) and lend support to the Weimar parliament.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;

SPD governments also introduced unemployment insurance benefits for all workers (in 1918),&lt;ref&gt;''Foundations of the Welfare State'' by [[Pat Thane]]&lt;/ref&gt; trade union recognition and an eight-hour workday, while municipalities that came under SPD control or influence expanded educational and job-training opportunities and set up health clinics.&lt;ref&gt;Weimar Germany: promise and tragedy by Eric D. Weitz&lt;/ref&gt; Off the shop floor, Social Democratic workers took advantage of the adult education halls, public libraries, swimming pools, schools, and low-income apartments built by municipalities during the Weimar years, while considerable wage increases won for the majority of workers by the [[Free Trade Unions (Germany)|Free Trade Unions]] between 1924 and 1928 helped to narrow the gap between unskilled and skilled workers.&lt;ref&gt;German social democracy and the rise of Nazism by Donna Harsch&lt;/ref&gt; A number of reforms were also made in education, as characterised by the introduction of the four-year common primary school.&lt;ref&gt;Imitation and Politics: Redesigning Modern Germany by Wade Jacoby&lt;/ref&gt; Educational opportunities were further widened by the promotion of adult education and culture.&lt;ref name="Guttsman"/&gt; The SPD also played an active and exemplary role in the development of local politics in thousands of towns and communities during this period.&lt;ref&gt;''The Social Democratic Party of Germany 1848–2005'' by Heinrich Potthoff and Susanne Miller&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923, the SPD Minister of Finance, Rudolf Hilferding, laid much of the groundwork for the stabilization of the German currency.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Bernstein to Brandt: A Short History of German Social Democracy edited by Roger Fletcher&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted by Edward R. Dickinson, the Revolution and the democratisation of the state and local franchise provided Social Democracy with a greater degree of influence at all levels of government than it had been able to achieve before 1914. As a result of the reform of municipal franchises, socialists gained control of many of the country's major cities. This provided Social Democrats with a considerable degree of influence in social policy, as most welfare programmes (even those programmes mandated by national legislation) were implemented by municipal government. By the Twenties, with the absence of a revolution and the reformist and revision element dominant in the SPD, Social Democrats regarded the expansion of social welfare programmes, and particularly the idea that the citizen had a right to have his or her basic needs met by society at large, as central to the construction of a just and democratic social order. Social Democrats therefore pushed the expansion of social welfare programmes energetically at all levels of government, and SPD municipal administrations were in the forefront of the development of social programmes. As remarked by Hedwig Wachenheim in 1926, under Social Democratic administration many of the country's larger cities began to become experimental “proletarian cooperatives.”&lt;ref name="google5"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Politics of German Child Welfare from the Empire to the Federal Republic|author=Dickinson, E.R.|date=1996|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674688629|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yM0y7LOn6x0C&amp;pg=PA147|page=147|accessdate=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protective measures for workers were vastly improved, under the influence or direction of the SPD, and members of the SPD pointed to positive changes that they had sponsored, such as improvements in public health, unemployment insurance, maternity benefits, and the building of municipal housing.&lt;ref&gt;Creating German communism, 1890–1990: from popular protests to socialist state by Eric D. Weitz&lt;/ref&gt; During its time in opposition throughout the Twenties, the SPD was able to help push through a series of reforms beneficial to workers, including increased investment in [[public housing]], expanded disability, health, and social insurance programmes, the restoration of an eight-hour workday in large firms, and the implementation of binding arbitration by the Labour Ministry.&lt;ref name="Smaldone"&gt;Confronting Hitler: German Social Democrats in Defense of the Weimar Republic, 1929–1933 by William Smaldone&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, the Social Democrats were responsible for a law which increased maternity benefit "to cover the cost of midwifery, medical help and all necessary medication and equipment for home births."&lt;ref name="google6"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Politics of the Body in Weimar Germany: Women’s Reproductive Rights and Duties|author=Usborne, C.|date=1992|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=9781349122448|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L6euCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47|page=47|accessdate=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Prussia, (which became an SPD stronghold following the introduction of universal suffrage) an important housing law was passed in 1918 which empowered local authorities to erect small dwellings and buildings of public utility, provide open spaces, and enact planning measures. The law further directed that all districts with more than 10,000 inhabitants had to issue police ordinances regarding housing hygiene. In addition, a reform in education was carried out.&lt;ref name="ebscohost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/65218686/teenagers-revolution-sch-lerr-te-democratization-right-wing-radicalization-germany-1918-1923|publisher=connection.ebscohost.com|title=The Teenagers' Revolution: SchÃ¼lerrÃ¤te in the Democratization and Right-Wing Radicalization of Germany, 1918â€“1923|accessdate=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar measures were introduced in other areas subjected to the influence of the SPD, with the Reich (also under the influence of the SPD) controlling rents and subsidising the construction of housing.&lt;ref name="Childs"&gt;Germany In The Twentieth Century by David Childs&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Weimar era, the SPD held the chancellorship on two occasions, first from 1918 to 1920, and then again from 1928 to 1930. Through aggressive opposition politics, the SPD (backed by the union revival linked to economic upsurge) was able to effect greater progress in social policy from 1924 to 1928 than during the previous and subsequent periods of the party's participation in government.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;  In Prussia, the SPD was part of the government from 1918 to 1932, and for all but nine months of that time (April–November 1921 and February–April 1925), a member of the SPD was minister president.

The SPD's last period in office was arguably a failure, due to both its lack of a parliamentary majority (which forced it to make compromises to right-wing parties) and its inability to confront the Great Depression. In 1927, the defence ministry had prevailed on the government of Wilhelm Marx to provide funds in its draft budget of 1928 for the construction of the first of six small battleships allowed for under the treaty of Versailles, although the Federal Council (largely for financial reasons) stopped this action. This issue played a major role during the 1928 election campaign, with supporters of the proposal arguing that all the possibilities left for German armaments should be fully used, while the SPD and the KPD saw this as a wasteful expenditure, arguing that such money should instead be spent on providing free meals for schoolchildren. The SPD's lack of a parliamentary majority (which prevented it from undertaking any major domestic reform)&lt;ref&gt;A history of modern Germany: 1840–1945 by Hajo Holborn&lt;/ref&gt; meant that, in order to hold the coalition together, [[Hermann Müller (politician)|Hermann Müller]] and the other SPD ministers were forced to make concessions on issues such as taxation, unemployment insurance, and the construction of pocket battleships.&lt;ref name="Smaldone"/&gt;

Party chairman [[Otto Wels]] demanded that the funds be spent on free school meals as had been promised during the election campaign. However, against the wishes and votes of Wels and the other SPD deputies, the SPD ministers in Müller's cabinet (including Müller himself) voted in favour of the first battleship being built, a decision that arguably destroyed the party's credibility.&lt;ref&gt;A history of modern Germany, 1800–2000 by Martin Kitchen&lt;/ref&gt;

Müller's SPD government eventually fell as a result of the catastrophic effects of the Great Depression. Müller's government, an ideologically diverse “Grand Coalition” representing five parties ranging from the left to the right, was unable to develop effective counter-measures to tackle the catastrophic effects of the economic crisis, as characterised by the massive rise in the numbers of registered unemployed. In 1928–29, 2.5&amp;nbsp;million were estimated to be unemployed, a figure that reached over 3&amp;nbsp;million by the following winter. A major problem facing Müller's government was a deficit in the Reich budget, which the government spending more than it was receiving. This situation was made worse by the inadequacy of the unemployment scheme which was unable to pay out enough benefits to the rising numbers of unemployed, forcing the government to make contributions to the scheme (which in turn worsened the budget deficit). The coalition was badly divided on this issue, with the SPD wishing to raise the level of contributions to the scheme while safeguarding both those in work and those out of work as much as possible. The right-wing parties, by contrast, wished to reduce unemployment benefits while lightening the tax burden. Unable to garner enough support in the Reichstag to pass laws, Müller turned to Hindenburg for support, wishing him to grant him the use of the emergency powers under Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution so that he did not have to rely on support from the Reichstag.&lt;ref&gt;Germany, 1858–1990: hope, terror, and revival by Alison Kitson&lt;/ref&gt;

Müller refused to agree to reductions in unemployment benefit which the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] under [[Heinrich Bruning]] saw as necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Essential Modern World History by Steve Waugh&lt;/ref&gt; The government finally collapsed in March 1930 when Müller (lacking support from Hindenburg) resigned, a fall from office that according to the historian [[William Smaldone]] marked “the effective end of parliamentary government under Weimar.”&lt;ref name="Smaldone"/&gt;

On July 20, 1932, the SPD-led Prussian government in Berlin, headed by [[Otto Braun]], was ousted by [[Franz von Papen]], the new Chancellor, by means of a Presidential decree. Following the appointment of [[Adolf Hitler]] as chancellor on January 30, 1933 by president [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]], the SPD received 18.25% of the votes during the last (at least partially) free elections on March 5, gaining 120 seats. However, the SPD was unable to prevent the ratification of the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]], which granted extraconstitutional powers to the government. The SPD was the only party to vote against the act (the KPD being already outlawed and its deputies were under arrest, dead, or in exile). Several of its deputies had been detained by the police under the provisions of the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]], which suspended civil liberties. Others suspected that the SPD would be next, and fled into exile.&lt;ref name="RiseFall"&gt;William Shirer, ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'' (Touchstone Edition) (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, even if they had all been present, the Act would have still passed, as the 441 votes in favour would have still been more than the required two-thirds majority.

After the passing of the Enabling Act, dozens of SPD deputies were arrested, and several more fled into exile. Those that remained tried their best to appease the Nazis. They voted in favour of Hitler's foreign policy statement of 19 May, in which he declared his willingness to renounce all offensive weapons if other countries followed suit. They also publicly distanced themselves from their brethren abroad who condemned Hitler's tactics. It was to no avail. Over the course of the spring, the police confiscated the SPD's newspapers and property. The party was finally banned on June 19, 1933.&lt;ref name="RiseFall"/&gt;

The party was a member of the [[Labour and Socialist International]] between 1923 and 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski, Werner. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=83QdPwAACAAJ Geschichte der sozialistischen arbeiter-internationale: 1923 - 19]''. Berlin: Dt. Verl. d. Wissenschaften, 1985. p. 287&lt;/ref&gt;

===Era of national socialism / SoPaDe (1933–1945)===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-18450-0002, Demütigung von Bernhard Kuhnt durch SA.jpg|thumb|Former SPD minister president of Oldenburg, Bernhard Kuhnt, humiliated by Nazis in 1933]]
Being the only party in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] to have voted against the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]] (with the [[Communist Party of Germany]] prevented from voting), the SPD was banned in the summer of 1933 by the new Nazi government. Many of its members were jailed or sent to [[Nazi concentration camps]]. An exile organization, known as [[Sopade]], was established, initially in Prague. Others left the areas where they had been politically active and moved to other towns where they were not known.

Between 1936 and 1939 some SPD members [[Spanish Civil War|fought in Spain]] for the Republic against Franco and the German [[Condor Legion]].

After the annexation of Czechoslovakia in 1938 the exile party resettled in Paris and, after the defeat of France in 1940, in London. Only a few days after the outbreak of World War II in September 1939 the exiled SPD in Paris declared its support for the Allies and for the military removal from power of the [[Nazi government]].

==History after World War II==

===From occupation to the Federal Republic ===
[[File:Kurt Schumacher.jpg|thumb|World War I volunteer and concentration camp inmate [[Kurt Schumacher]], SPD chairman after the war]]
The SPD was recreated after [[World War II]] in 1946 and admitted in all four [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|occupation zones]]. In [[West Germany]], it was initially in opposition from the first election of the newly founded Federal Republic in 1949 until 1966. The party had a leftist period and opposed the republic's integration into Western structures, believing that this might diminish the chances for German reunification.

The SPD was somewhat hampered for much of the early history of the Federal Republic, in part because the bulk of its former heartland was now in the Soviet occupation sector, which later became [[East Germany]]. In the latter area, the SPD was forced to merge with the [[Communist Party of Germany]] to form the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] (SED) in 1946. The few recalcitrant SPD members were quickly pushed out, leaving the SED as essentially a renamed KPD.  In the British Occupation Zone, the SPD held a referendum on the issue of merging with the KPD, with 80% of party members rejecting such a fusion.  This referendum was ignored by the newly formed SED.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Germany: 1815-1990|last=Carr|first=William|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton|year=1991|isbn=|edition=4th|location=United Kingdom|pages=369–370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, a few former SPD members held high posts in the East German government. [[Otto Grotewohl]] served as East Germany's first prime minister from 1949 to 1964. For much of that time retained the perspective of a left-wing social democrat, and publicly advocated a less repressive approach to governing. [[Friedrich Ebert, Jr.]], son of former president Ebert, served as mayor of [[East Berlin]] from 1949 to 1967; he'd reportedly been blackmailed into supporting the merger by using his father's role in the schism of 1918 against him.

During the fall of Communist rule in 1989, the SPD (first called SDP) was re-established as a separate party in East Germany ([[Social Democratic Party in the GDR]]), independent of the rump SED, and then merged with its West German counterpart upon reunification.

Despite remaining out of office for much of the postwar period, the SPD were able to gain control of a number of local governments and implement progressive social reforms. As noted by [[Manfred G. Schmidt|Manfred Schmidt]], SPD-controlled Lander governments were more active in the social sphere and transferred more funds to public employment and education than CDU/CSU-controlled Lander.&lt;ref&gt;The German Social Democrats since 1969: A Party in Power and Opposition by Gerard Braunthal&lt;/ref&gt; During the mid-sixties, mainly SPD-governed Lander such as Hesse and the three city-states launched the first experiments with comprehensive schools as a means of as expanding educational opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;The German education system since 1945 by Ivan Christoph Führ&lt;/ref&gt; SPD local governments were also active in encouraging the post-war housing boom in West Germany, with some of the best results in housing construction during this period achieved by SPD-controlled Lander authorities such as West Berlin, Hamburg, and Bremen.&lt;ref name="Childs"/&gt; In the [[Bundestag]], the SPD opposition were partly responsible for the establishment of the postwar [[welfare state]] under the [[Adenauer]] Administration, having put parliamentary pressure on the CDU to carry out more progressive social policies during its time in office.&lt;ref&gt;The two red flags: European social democracy and Soviet communism since 1945 by David Childs&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Bundestag, The SPD aspired to be a “constructive opposition,” which expressed itself not only  in the role it played in framing the significant amount of new legislation introduced in the first parliamentary terms of the Bundestag, but also in the fact that by far the biggest proportion of all laws were passed with the votes of SPD members. The SPD played a notable part in legislation on reforms to the national pensions scheme, the integration of refugees, and the building of public-sector housing. The SPD also had a high-profile “in judicial policy with the Public Prosecutor Adolf Arndt, in the parliamentary decision on the Federal Constitutional Court, and reparations for the victims of National Socialism.” In 1951, the law on the right of “co-determination” for employees in the steel, iron, and mining industries was passed with the combined votes of the SPD and CDU, and against those of the FDP.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;

===Governing party from 1966 to 1982===
[[File:SPD logo 1969.png|thumbnail|right|Logo of the Social Democratic Party during the 1960s and 1970s]]
In 1966 the coalition of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) and the liberal [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP) fell and a [[grand coalition]] between CDU/CSU and SPD was formed under the leadership of CDU Chancellor [[Kiesinger]]. The welfare state was considerably expanded,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~ces/publications/docs/pdfs/CES_35.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; while social spending was almost doubled between 1969 and 1975.&lt;ref name="country-data2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-4975.html|publisher=country-data.com|title=Germany - Social Democratic Party of Germany|accessdate=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes were made to income maintenance schemes which met some of the SPD's long-standing demands,&lt;ref&gt;Growth to Limits: Germany, United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy by Peter Flora&lt;/ref&gt; and many other social reforms were introduced, including the equalising of wages and salaries between white-collar and blue-collar employees, the continuation of wage and salary payments, a law to promote employment, and a vocational training law. Although these measures were largely due to the efforts of the CDU minister [[Hans Katzer]], it is arguable that he would never have been able to push his programme through the cabinet (let alone envisage it) without the SPD.&lt;ref name="Donhoff"&gt;Foe into friend: The Makers of the New Germany from Konrad Adenauer to Helmut Schmidt by Marion Dönhoff&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1969 Employment Promotion Act, which was based largely on a proposal prepared by the SPD in 1966,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.socialpolicy.ed.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/39268/REC-WP_0110_Bonoli.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; established active labour market intervention measures such as employment research,&lt;ref&gt;The German economy by E. Owen Smith&lt;/ref&gt; and offered “substantial state assistance to employees with educational aspirations.”&lt;ref&gt;Education and work in Great Britain, Germany, and Italy by Annette Jobert&lt;/ref&gt; Under the direction of the SPD [[Minister of Economics]] [[Karl Schiller]], the federal government adopted Keynesian demand management for the first time ever. Schiller called for legislation that would provide both his ministry and the federal government with greater authority to guide economic policy.&lt;ref name="countrystudies137"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/germany/137.htm|publisher=countrystudies.us|title=Germany - The Economic Miracle and Beyond|accessdate=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, Schiller introduced the Law for Promoting Stability and Growth,&lt;ref&gt;Germany in Our Time: A Political History of the Postwar Years by Alfred Grosser&lt;/ref&gt; which was subsequently passed by the Bundestag. Regarded as the Magna Carta of medium-term economic management, the legislation provided for coordination of federal, Lander, and local budget plans in order to give fiscal policy a stronger impact. It also set a number of optimistic targets for four basic standards by which West German economic success would henceforth be measured, which included trade balance, employment levels, economic growth, and currency stability.&lt;ref name="countrystudies137"/&gt;

One of the rare German Keynesians of that era, Schiller believed that government had both “the obligation and the capacity to shape economic trends and to smooth out and even eliminate the business cycle,”&lt;ref name="countrystudies137"/&gt; and his adopted policy of Keynesian demand management helped West Germany to overcome the economic recession of 1966/67.&lt;ref name="cooper"&gt;Paradoxes of peace: German peace movements since 1945 by Alice Holmes Cooper&lt;/ref&gt; Unemployment was quickly reduced (standing at just under 1% by Autumn 1968), while industrial output rose by almost 12% in 1968. The successful economic and financial policies pursued by the Grand Coalition under the direction of Schiller was also helped by the persuasion of entrepreneurs and trade unions to accept a programme of “concerted action.”&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt; According to Lisanne Radice and Giles Radice, “concerted action” was not a formal [[incomes policy]], but it did nevertheless ensure that collective bargaining took place “within a broadly agreed view of the direction of the economy and the relationships between full employment, output and inflation.”&lt;ref name="Radice"&gt;Socialists in the Recession: The Search for Solidarity by Giles Radice and Lisanne Radice&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Schiller's economic policies were not only successful in restoring West Germany's economic growth, but they also demonsteated the SPD's economic competence, and this undoubtedly played a major role in the victory of the SPD in the federal election of 1969.

In 1969 the SPD won a majority for the first time since 1928 by forming a [[social-liberal coalition]] with the FDP and led the federal government under [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellors]] [[Willy Brandt]] and [[Helmut Schmidt]] from 1969 until 1982. In its 1959 [[Godesberg Program]], the SPD officially abandoned the concept of a workers' party and Marxist principles, while continuing to stress [[social welfare provision]]. Although the SPD originally opposed West Germany's 1955 rearmament and entry into [[NATO]] while it favoured neutrality and reunification with East Germany, it now strongly supports German ties with the alliance.

A wide range of reforms were carried out under the Social-Liberal coalition, including, as summarised by one historical study

‘improved health and accident insurance, better unemployment compensation, rent control, payments to families with children, subsidies to encourage savings and investments, and measures to “humanize the world of work” such as better medical care for on-the-job illnesses or injuries and mandated improvements in the work environment.'&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;A History of West Germany Volume 2: Democracy and its discontents 1963–1988 by Dennis L. Bark and David R. Gress&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the SDP-FDP coalition, social policies in West Germany took on a more egalitarian character and a number of important reforms were carried out to improve the prospects of previously neglected and underprivileged groups.&lt;ref name="WalkerLawsonTownsend"&gt;Responses to poverty: lessons from Europe by Robert Walker, Roger Lawson, and Peter Townsend&lt;/ref&gt; Greater emphasis was placed on policies favouring single parents, larger families, and the lower paid, and further improvements were made in social benefits for pensioners and disabled persons. Rates of social assistance (excluding rent) as a percentage of average gross earnings of men in manufacturing industries rose during the Social-Liberal coalition's time in office,&lt;ref&gt;Poverty and Inequality in Common Market Countries by Victor George and Roger Lawson&lt;/ref&gt; while social welfare provision was greatly extended, with pensions and health care opened up to large sections of the population.&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;Contemporary Germany: A Handbook by Derek Lewis&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn substantially increased the size and cost of the social budget, as social program costs grew by over 10% a year during much of the Seventies.&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt; Government spending as a percentage of GDP rose significantly under the SPD-FDP coalition, from 39% in 1969 to around 50% by 1982.&lt;ref name="Sinn"&gt;Can Germany be saved?: the malaise of the world's first welfare state by Hans-Werner Sinn&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1970 and 1981, social spending as a proportion of GNP rose by 21.4%, and in terms of percentage of GNP went up from 25,7% in 1970 to 31.2% in 1981.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Much was accomplished in the way of social reform during the SDP-FDP coalition's first five years on office, with one study noting that "“the years 1969 to 1974 represent a phase of social policy in which the state introduced new minimum benefits and extended existing ones.”&lt;ref name="google7"&gt;{{cite book|title=Time and Poverty in Western Welfare States: United Germany in Perspective|author1=Leisering, L.|author2=Leibfried, S.|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521003520|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KScADiSdelIC&amp;pg=PA185|page=185|accessdate=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1970, the government drew up an Action Programme for the Promotion of the Rehabilitation of Handicapped Persons.&lt;ref&gt;Survey of social security in the Federal Republic of Germany by Dieter Schewe, Karlhugo Nordhorn and Klaus Schenke&lt;/ref&gt; During that same year, bills were tabled to extend and increase housing allowances (passed in 1970), to extend and standardise the promotion of vocational training (passed in 1971), to automatically index pensions for war victims (passed in 1970), to increase family allowances (passed in 1970), and to reform “shop rules” (which came into force in 1972). In 1974, a bankruptcy allowance was introduced for employed persons when their employers became insolvent. Developments in accident insurance led to the inclusion of schoolchildren, students and children at kindergarten and thus to more widespread measures for accident prevention. In addition, farm and household assistance was introduced as a new service in agricultural accident insurance. A major pension reform law extended the accessibility of pension insurance by providing generous possibilities for backpayments of contributions, while adjustment of currently paid out pensions was brought forward by 6 months. The Rehabilitation and Assimilation Law of 1974 improved and standardised benefits for the disabled, while a law was passed that same year on the establishment of an additional relief fund for persons employed in agriculture and forestry. The Law on the Improvement of Works’ Old Age Schemes of 1974 brought conditional non-forfeiture of qualifying periods for works pensions as well as the prohibition of cuts in works pensions due to increases in social insurance pensions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In addition, a number of reforms in areas such as civil and consumer rights&lt;ref name="spiegel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14352174.html|publisher=spiegel.de|title=Dreizehn Jahre geliehene Macht - DER SPIEGEL 43/1982|accessdate=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; the environment,&lt;ref name="spiegel2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14354171.html|publisher=spiegel.de|title=Dreizehn Jahre geliehene Macht - DER SPIEGEL 45/1982|accessdate=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; education,&lt;ref name="spiegel3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14353078.html|publisher=spiegel.de|title=Dreizehn Jahre geliehene Macht - DER SPIEGEL 44/1982|accessdate=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and urban renewal&lt;ref name="google8"&gt;{{cite book|title=Japan and Central Europe Restructuring: Geographical Aspects of Socio-economic, Urban, and Regional Development|author=Flüchter, W.|date=1995|publisher=Harrassowitz|isbn=9783447035316|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C8J1pypuORUC&amp;pg=PA150|page=150|accessdate=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google9"&gt;{{cite book|title=How to Make Successful Urban Development Programme: Experience from Nine European Countries|author=Burgers, J.|date=2004|publisher=Garant|isbn=9789044113938|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TdAM2GS0t3kC&amp;pg=PA100|page=100|accessdate=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; were carried out. in 1972, a pension reform act was passed which, according to one historical study, ensured that workers “would not suffer financial hardship and could maintain an adequate standard of living after retirement.”&lt;ref&gt;A History of West Germany Volume 2: Democracy and its discontents 1963–1988 by Dennis L.

Under a law of April 1974, the protection hitherto granted to the victims of war or industrial accidents for the purpose of their occupational and social reintegration was extended to all handicapped persons, whatever the cause of their handicap, provided that their capacity to work has been reduced by at least 50%. Another law, passed in August that same year, supplemented this protection by providing that henceforth the benefits for the purposes of medical and occupational rehabilitation would be the same for all the categories of persons concerned: war victims, the sick, the victims of industrial accidents, congenitally handicapped persons, representing a total of about 4&amp;nbsp;million persons in all. In addition, a new benefit was introduced to help such people in all branches of social security, taking the form of an adaptation benefit equivalent to 80% of the previous gross salary and to be granted over the period between the time when the person in question is forced to stop work and the time when he resumes work. A law on home-based workers, passed by the Federal Parliament in June 1974, sought to modernise the working conditions of approximately 300 000 people who work at home by means of the following measures:&lt;ref name="aei.pitt.edu"&gt;http://aei.pitt.edu/9842/1/9842.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*Employers were obliged to inform their home-based workers concerning the method of calculation and the composition of their pay.
*In order to increase safety at work the employer was obliged to explain accident risks and dangers to health.
*Home-based workers were now given the opportunity of making contributions towards asset formation.
*Protection from dismissal was extended. The periods of notice, which are graduated according to the length of time the worker has been employed, were considerably increased. In addition, the guarantee of payment during the period of notice was consolidated.
*The agreed wage for the same or equivalent work in industry would be used more than previously as the standard for wage increases for home-based workers.
*The Law also applied to office work at home, which was becoming increasingly important and substantial.

Children's allowances for students up to the age of twenty-seven were introduced,&lt;ref name="Donhoff"/&gt; together with a flexible retirement age, new married couples’ and families’ legislation, an extension of co-determination, rehabilitation and special employment rights for the severely handicapped, adjustments and increases in the pensions of war victims, a revision of child benefit, a new youth employment protection law, health insurance for farmers, pension schemes for the self-employed, and guaranteed works’ pensions. Although the principle of the social welfare state was enshrined in the constitution of West Germany, and laws and measures taken (often jointly by the CDU/CSU coalition partners and the SPD) to meet this commitment, it was only when the SPD came to power in Bonn that the provisions of the social welfare system “reached a level which few other countries could equal.”&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt; In 1975, three tax levels were introduced that removed many lower-income persons from the tax rolls and raised child benefit payments.&lt;ref&gt;A History of West Germany Volume 2: Democracy and its discontents 1963–1988 by Dennis L. Bark and David R. Gress.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various improvements were also made to health care provision and coverage during the social-liberal coalition's time in office. In 1974, domestic aid during in-patient or in-patient cures was established, sick pay to compensate for wages lost while caring for a child was introduced, and the time-limit to in-patient care was removed. That same year, the cover of rehabilitation services was increased, together with the cover of dental and orthodontic services.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ministerial-leadership.org/sites/default/files/resources_and_tools/10%20german%20health%20insu.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Health insurance coverage was extended to self-employed agricultural workers in 1972, and to students and the disabled in 1975.&lt;ref name="germanculture"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.germanculture.com.ua/library/facts/bl_health_care_develop.htm|publisher=germanculture.com.ua|title=Development of the Health Care System in Germany|accessdate=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1971, an International Transactions Tax Law was passed.&lt;ref name="google12"&gt;{{cite book|title=International Handbook on Comparative Business Law|author=Campbell, D.|date=2013|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789401743990|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fMSfBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT79|accessdate=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, a number of amendments were made to the Federal Social Assistance Act. "Help for [[social vulnerability|the vulnerable]]" was renamed "help for overcoming particular social difficulties," and the number of people eligible for assistance was greatly extended to include all those "whose own capabilities cannot meet the increasing demands of modern industrial society." The intention of these amendments was to include especially such groups as discharged prisoners, drug and narcotic addicts, alcoholics, and the homeless.&lt;ref&gt;Time and Poverty in Western Welfare States: United Germany in Perspective by Lutz Leisering and Stephan Leibfried&lt;/ref&gt; Under the SPD, people who formerly had to be supported by their relatives became entitled to social assistance.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0KnP2KKdzyAC&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=malaise+first+welfare+state+brandt+1972+and+1974#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Can Germany Be Saved?: The Malaise of the World's First Welfare State – Hans-Werner Sinn |publisher=Google Books  |accessdate=2012-11-14|isbn=9780262195584|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the recreational and residential value of towns (building schools, training institutions, baths, sports facilities, Kindegarten etc.) was increased from 1970 with the help of a new programme.&lt;ref name="archive"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/WahlprogrammDerSpdMitWillyBrandtFrFriedenSicherheitUndEine|publisher=archive.org|title=Wahlprogramm der SPD : mit Willy Brandt fur Frieden, Sicherheit und eine bessere Qualitat des Lebens : Sozialdemokratischen Partei Deutschlands : Free Download &amp;amp; Streaming : Internet Archive|accessdate=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of liberal social reforms in areas like censorship,&lt;ref&gt;The Military-Industrial Complex and American Society by Sterling Michael Pavelec&lt;/ref&gt; homosexuality,&lt;ref name="cooper"/&gt; divorce, education, and worker participation in company management were introduced,&lt;ref&gt;Germany: a reference guide from the Renaissance to the present by Joseph A. Biesinger&lt;/ref&gt; whilst social security benefits were significantly increased. Increases were made in unemployment benefits,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.urge.it/files/papers/2_wpurge3_2009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; while substantial improvements in benefits were made for farmers, students, war invalids, the sick, families with many children, women, and pensioners between 1970 and 1975, which led to a doubling of benefit and social security payments during that period.&lt;ref&gt;Germany, 1945–1990: a parallel history by Jürgen Weber&lt;/ref&gt; By 1979, old age and survivors’ benefits were 53% higher in real terms than in 1970, while family benefits were 95% higher.&lt;ref name="WalkerLawsonTownsend"/&gt;

The Second Sickness Insurance Modification Law linked the indexation of the income-limit for compulsory employee coverage to the development of the pension insurance contribution ceiling (75% of the ceiling), obliged employers to pay half of the contributions in the case of voluntary membership, extended the criteria for voluntary membership of employees, and introduced preventive medical check-ups for certain groups.&lt;!--ref name="autogenerated3"/--&gt; The Law on Sickness Insurance for Farmers (1972) included the self-employed, their dependants and people who receive old age assistance in sickness insurance. The Law on the Social Insurance of Disabled Persons (1975) included in sickness and pension insurance disabled persons employed in workshops and institutions under certain conditions, while a law was passed in June that year to include all students in statutory sickness insurance.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Social protection against the risks of an occupational accident, death, disability, and old age was newly regulated in 1974 through a Civil Servant Provisioning Law that was standard throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;Social Policy in the Federal Republic of Germany: The Constitution of the Social by Hans F. Zacher&lt;/ref&gt;

Educational reforms were introduced which led to the setting up of new colleges and universities, much greater access for young people to the universities, increased provision for pre-school education, and a limited number of comprehensive schools.&lt;ref&gt;German Political Parties: A Documentary Guide edited by G.E.

The staff councils were given an increased say in social and personal matters, together with a wider operational basis for their activities in connection with day release and training opportunities. The arrangements governing cooperation between the staff councils and the trade union were also improved. Young workers were given increased rights of representation, while foreign workers received voting rights and thus achieved equality in this respect with German employees.&lt;ref name="aei.pitt.edu"/&gt;

A new federal scale of charges for hospital treatment and a law on hospital financing were introduced to improve hospital treatment, the Hire Purchase Act entitled purchasers to withdraw from their contracts within a certain time limit, compensation for victims of violent acts became guaranteed by law, the Federal Criminal Investigation Office became a modern crime-fighting organisation, and the Federal Education Promotion Act was extended to include large groups of pupils attending vocational schools.&lt;ref&gt;Helmut Schmidt, Perspectives on Politics edited by Wolfram F Hanrieder&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, the minimum statutory retirement age was reduced from 65 to 63, while “flexible” retirement was provided for those between the ages of 63 and 67.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.socialsecurity.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v38n7/v38n7p38.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, a federal law was passed that obliged television stations to spend certain amounts of money each year to sponsor productions by independent film companies.&lt;ref&gt;Germany and the Germans by John Ardagh&lt;/ref&gt;

A law to improve the system of sickness benefits provided that those insured would receive compensation when obliged to stay at home to care for a sick child and thereby incurring a loss of income. An insured person could request unpaid leave of absence on such occasions. The same law established the right to a home help, to be paid for by the health service, where the parents are in hospital or undergoing treatment, provided that the household included a child under 8 or a handicapped child required special care.&lt;ref&gt;http://aei.pitt.edu/9801/1/9801.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google14"&gt;{{cite book|title=Women in the Two Germanies: A Comparative Study of A Socialist and a Non-Socialist Society|author=Shaffer, H.G.|date=2013|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=9781483153360|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0eFsBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA17|page=17|accessdate=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SPD-FDP coalition's time in office also saw a considerable expansion in the number of childcare places for three- to six-year-old children, with the number of facilities rising from 17,493 in 1970 to 23,938 in 1980, and the number of places from 1,160,700 to 1,392,500 during that same period.&lt;ref name="google15"&gt;{{cite book|title=Children, Families, and States: Time Policies of Childcare, Preschool, and Primary Education in Europe|author1=Allemann-Ghionda, C.|author2=Hagemann, K.|author3=Jarausch, K.H.|date=2011|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=9780857450975|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PUxFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA280|page=280|accessdate=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsidies for day care rose between 1970 and 1980, but fell between 1980 and 1983.&lt;ref name="google16"&gt;{{cite book|title=Canadian Family Policies: Cross-national Comparisons|author=Baker, M.|date=1995|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=9780802077868|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eWF56_J-6aEC&amp;pg=PA215|page=215|accessdate=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of housing, Brandt stated that the aims of the SPD-FDP government were improving housing benefit, developing a long-term programme of social housing construction, and to increase owner-occupation. As noted by Mark Kleinman, this led to a boom in housing construction, with output peaking at 714,000 in 1973 before falling to under 400,000 in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Housing, Welfare and the State in Europe: A Comparative Analysis of Britain, France and Germany by Mark Kleinman&lt;/ref&gt;

A Federal Education Grants Act was also introduced, which opened up better chances of higher education for low-income children.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt; In addition, labor-protection and anti-trust laws were significantly strengthened, while from 1969 to 1975 alone some 140 laws were passed that entitled various socially disadvantaged groups to tax subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;http://mises.org/journals/rae/pdf/rae5_2_4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; During the mid-Seventies recession, eligibility for short-term unemployment benefits was extended from 6 to 12 months, and to 24 months in some cases.&lt;ref name="heinonline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/month100&amp;div=135&amp;id=&amp;page|publisher=heinonline.org|title=Work-Sharing Initiatives at Home and Abroad 100 Monthly Labor Review 1977|accessdate=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Active Labour Market Policies were substantially expanded, with the number of people benefiting from such schemes increasing from 1,600 in 1970 to 648,000 by 1975.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sps.ed.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/39268/REC-WP_0110_Bonoli.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the SPD-FDP government gave more priority to raising minimum housing standards.&lt;ref name="google17"&gt;{{cite book|title=Poverty and Inequality in Common Market Countries|author1=George, V.|author2=Lawson, R.|date=1980|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|isbn=9780710005175|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R5g9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA223|page=223|accessdate=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Law on Nursing Homes and Homes for the Elderly (1974) sought to guarantee minimum standards in an important area of social services,&lt;ref&gt;Social Policy in the Federal Republic of Germany: The Constitution of the Social by Hans F.

Wage rates also rose significantly under the coalition, as characterised by a 60% real increase in the hourly wages of manufacturing sector employees between 1970 and 1980.&lt;ref name="Sinn"/&gt; In addition, educational opportunities were significantly widened as a result of policies such as the introduction of free higher education,&lt;ref name="Sinn"/&gt; the raising of the school-leaving age to 16,&lt;ref name="Radice"/&gt; increased expenditure on education at all levels,&lt;ref name="Childs"/&gt; and the introduction of a generous student stipend system.&lt;ref name="Sinn"/&gt; Although the coalition failed to restructure the education system along comprehensive lines, the cumulative impact of its educational reforms was such that according to Helmut Becker (an authoritative commentator on German education), there was greater achievement at all levels and the chances of a twenty-year-old working-class child born in 1958 going to college or university was approximately six times greater than a similar child born ten years earlier.&lt;ref name="Radice"/&gt;

In summarising the domestic reforms introduced by the SPD-FDP coalition, historian [[Reiner Pommerin]] noted that

“There were few difficulties with the wave of domestic reforms, which the SPD-led coalitions initiated. In fact, the SPD’s domestic reform program was often compared with contemporary American developments, like such as [[civil rights movement]] and the [[Great Society]]”
.&lt;ref&gt;The American impact on postwar Germany by Reiner Pommerin&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted further by [[Henrich Potthoff]] and [[Susanne Miller]], in their evaluation of the record of the SPD-FDP coalition,

“Ostpolitik and detente, the extension of the welfare safety net, and a greater degree of social liberality were the fruits of Social Democratic government during this period which served as a pointer to the future and increased the respect in which the federal republic was held, both in Europe and throughout the world.”&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;

In 1982 the SPD lost power to the new CDU/CSU-FDP coalition under CDU Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] who subsequently won four terms as chancellor. The Social Democrats were unanimous about the armament and environmental questions of that time, and the new party [[Alliance '90/The Greens|The Greens]] was not ready for a coalition government then.

Kohl lost his last re-election bid in 1998 to his SPD challenger [[Gerhard Schröder]], as the SPD formed a [[Red-green alliance|red-green coalition]] with The Greens to take control of the German federal government for the first time in 16 years.

===Schröder government 1998–2005===
Led by [[Gerhard Schröder]] on a moderate platform emphasizing the need to reduce unemployment, the SPD emerged as the strongest party in the [[German federal election, 1998|September 1998 elections]] with 40.9% of the votes cast. Crucial for this success was the SPD's strong base in big cities and ''Bundesländer'' with traditional industries. Forming a [[coalition government]] with the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green Party]], the SPD thus returned to power for the first time since 1982.

[[File:Schroeder2002.jpg|thumb|Gerhard Schröder, elections of 2002]]
[[Oskar Lafontaine]], elected SPD chairman in November 1996 had in the run-up to the election forgone a bid for the SPD nomination for the chancellor candidacy, after Gerhard Schröder won a sweeping re-election victory as prime minister of his state of [[Lower Saxony]] and was widely believed to be the best chance for Social Democrats to regain the Chancellorship after 16 years in opposition. From the beginning of this teaming up between Party chair Lafontaine and chancellor candidate Schröder during the election campaign 1998, rumors in the media about their internal rivalry persisted, albeit always being disputed by the two. After the election victory Lafontaine joined the government as finance minister. The rivalry between the two party leaders escalated in March 1999 leading to the overnight resignation of Lafontaine from all his party and government positions. After staying initially mum about the reasons for his resignation, Lafontaine later cited strong disagreement with the alleged [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] and anti-social course Schröder had taken the government on. Schröder himself has never commented on the row with Lafontaine. It is known however, that they haven't spoken to each other ever since. Schröder succeeded Lafontaine as party chairman.

A number of progressive measures were introduced by the Schröder Administration during its first term in office. The parental leave scheme was improved, with full-time working parents legally entitled to reduce their working hours from 2001 onwards, while the child allowance was considerably increased, from 112 euros per month in 1998 to 154 euros in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Modernising the welfare state: the Blair legacy by Martin A. Powell&lt;/ref&gt; Housing allowances were also increased, while a number of decisions by the Kohl Government concerning social policy and the labour market were overturned, as characterised by the reversal of retrenchments in health policy and pension policy.&lt;ref&gt;Social Democracy in Power: The Capacity to Reform by Wolfgang Merkel, Alexander Petring, Christian Henkes, and Christopher Egle&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes introduced by the Kohl government on pensions, the continued payment of wages in the case of sickness, and wrongful dismissal were all rescinded.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt; In 1999, for instance, the wage replacement rate for sick pay (which was reduced from 100% to 80% of earnings under the previous Kohl Government) was restored to 100%.&lt;ref&gt;http://econ.tau.ac.il/papers/labor/Puhani_Sonderhof_TA.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A programme on combating youth unemployment was introduced, together new measures designed to out a stop to those designating themselves as “self-employed” for tax purposes, and new regulations on 630-DM jobs, which were subject for the first time to national insurance contributions. Tax reforms brought relief to people on low-incomes and benefited families, while a second pillar was added to the pension system which relied on self-provision for retirement.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;

In the [[German federal election, 2002|September 2002 elections]], the SPD reached 38.5% of the national vote, barely ahead of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]]/[[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]], and was again able to form a government with the help of The Greens. The European elections of 2004 were a disaster for the SPD, marking its worst result in a nationwide election after World War II with only 21.5% of the vote. Earlier the same year, leadership of the SPD had changed from chancellor Gerhard Schröder to [[Franz Müntefering]], in what was widely regarded as an attempt to deal with internal party opposition to the economic reform programs set in motion by the federal government.

While the SPD was founded in the 19th century to defend the interests of the [[working class]], its commitment to these goals has been disputed by some since 1918, when its leaders supported the suppression of more radical socialist and communist factions during the [[Spartacist Uprising]]. But never before has the party moved so far away from its traditional [[Democratic socialism|socialist]] stance as it did under the Schröder government. Its ever-increasing tendency towards liberal economic policies and cutbacks in government spending on social welfare programs led to a dramatic decline in voter support. The Schroeder Administration presided over a significant rise in poverty and inequality, with the percentage of Germans living in poverty, according to one measure, rising from 12% in 2000 to 16.5% in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://ftp.iza.org/dp5062.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Welfare cuts, which affected mainly the SPD's clientele, led to disillusionment amongst supporters and precipitated a fall in party membership.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt; For many years, membership in the SPD had been declining. Down from a high of over 1&amp;nbsp;million in 1976, there were about 775,000 members at the time of the 1998 election victory, and by February 2008, the figure had dropped to 537,995. By early 2009, membership figures had fallen behind the ones of the CDU for the first time ever.

In January 2005, some SPD members left the party to found the [[Labour and Social Justice – The Electoral Alternative]] (WASG) in opposition to what they consider to be neoliberal leanings displayed by the SPD. Former SPD chairman Oskar Lafontaine also joined this new party. (Later, to contest the early federal election called by Schröder after the SPD lost heavily in a state election in their traditional stronghold of North Rhine-Westphalia, the western-based WASG and the eastern-based post-communist [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]] would merge to form [[The Left (Germany)|The Left Party]], (''Die Linke''.) These developments put pressure on the SPD to do something about its social image.

In April 2005, party chairman [[Franz Müntefering]] publicly criticized excessive profiteering in Germany's [[market economy]] and proposed stronger involvement of the federal state in order to promote economic justice. This triggered a debate that dominated the national news for several weeks. Müntefering's suggestions have been met with popular support, but there has also been harsh criticism not only by  the industrial lobby. Political opponents claimed that Müntefering's choice of words, especially his reference to [[private equity]] funds as “locusts”, were bordering on Nazi language.

In the [[German federal election, 2005]], the SPD ended up trailing its rivals by less than 1%, a much closer margin than had been expected. Although the party had presented a program that included some more traditional left themes, such as an additional 3% tax on the highest tax bracket, this did not prevent the Left Party from making a strong showing, largely at the SPD's expense. Nevertheless, the overall result was sufficient to deny the opposition camp a majority.

==The Merkel-led grand coalition==
{{update|date=February 2012}}
In the current German government, the SPD is now the junior partner in a [[grand coalition]] with the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]]/[[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|CSU]] under the leadership of Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]], with [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] as [[Vice-Chancellor of Germany|Vice-Chancellor]].

However, Müntefering resigned as party chairman and was succeeded as chairman by [[Matthias Platzeck]], [[minister-president]] of [[Brandenburg]]. Müntefering's decision came after the party's steering committee chose a woman from the left wing of the party, [[Andrea Nahles]], as secretary general over Müntefering's choice, his long-time aide [[Kajo Wasserhövel]]. However, after Müntefering said her election indicated that he had lost the confidence of the party and he would therefore resign, Nahles turned down the post of secretary general to prevent the party splitting. [[Hubertus Heil]] was elected in her place.

On April 10, 2006 Matthias Platzeck announced his resignation of the Chair because he suffered a major [[hearing loss]] in March 2006. The interim Chairman from April 10 to May 14 was [[Kurt Beck]]. He won the full leadership on a small party convention on May 14. He resigned on September 7, 2008; on September 8, 2008 the party's executive committee nominated [[Franz Müntefering]] to be elected as chairman at an extraordinary party conference on October 18, 2008. In the meantime [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] serves as provisional chairman.

During the Schröder administration, Schröder and Lafontaine disliked each other, because Lafontaine quit as Finance Minister in 1999. After his resignation there was a huge distrust of Lafontaine in the SPD which lasts to today. However, due to the rise of Angela Merkel and Guido Westerwelle on the national stage of politics in 2005 and a belief in the German public of the failed social policies of the SPD on labour issues ([[Hartz IV]]), the SPD lost heavily in opinion polls and lost a couple of statewide elections. So there was the urgency to form new coalitions with the Left who have a similar political agenda than the weakened Green Party or the other conservative parties in Germany. However the leader of the Left was the lost child of the SPD - Oskar Lafontaine - who had fallen out with the SPD. There is a common oath in the SPD not to form coalitions with the Left, because of Lafontaine.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

[[File:Frank-Walter Steinmeier 08.jpg|thumb|Candidate for chancellorship in 2009: Frank-Walter Steinmeier, minister of the exterior since 2005]]
So, a state leader of the SPD - [[Andrea Ypsilanti]] - choose to form a minority coalition with the Left in [[Hesse]] after a lost state election in January 2008. This decision was heavily criticized by national leaders of the SPD. But the leader at that time - Kurt Beck - was for the coalition in Hesse and supported Ypsilanti. Beck who is a popular minister-president has lost a lot reputation on a national level because of the support. At an emergency session of leaders of the SPD, Kurt Beck resigned the chairmanship of the SPD, because after 8 months there was no coalition and Beck was criticized for supporting Ypsilanti. In November 2008, the Landtag in Hesse was dissolved and there will be new elections in January 2009.

But several other state leaders of SPD have started flirting with the "Left" and today there is a huge struggle in the SPD on how to treat the Left in order to gain Bundesrat seats to be once again a true national party. In November 2008, the SPD was at 25% in national opinion polls, one of the lowest values in recent memory. Furthermore, today in the SPD there is rift between two internal factions of the party. One side of the party - the right-wing [[Seeheimer Kreis]] refuses to do coalitions with the Left Party. Members of the right-wing include Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Gerhard Schröder. The other side of the party - the political left of the SPD - embraces coalitions with the radical Left. Members include Andrea Ypsilanti and Andrea Nahles.

Also a reason for today's struggle with the Left is that the SPD is currently itself in a national coalition with the conservative coalition. So the SPD is in a dual struggle. At first the struggle for not endangering the national coalition with Merkel and therefore endangering a national political crisis that maybe result in further losses for the SPD. And secondly the struggle for not forgetting the roots where the SPD came from, because the SPD itself is left party, whose political positions have been eaten by the Left party. So the SPD has to position itself again.

After the coalition talks completed in February 2018, the party held a [[SPD party member vote on the 2018 coalition agreement of Germany|vote]] to let its members decide about the new coalition treaty with the CDU and CSU parties.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-politics-spd-vote-factbox/factbox-what-happens-if-germanys-spd-votes-against-coalition-with-merkel-idUSKCN1GE26C Factbox: What happens if Germany's SPD votes against coalition with Merkel?], Reuters.com&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of the Republic of Macedonia}}

The [[Republic of Macedonia]] is a signatory to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and the U.N. Geneva [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|Convention relating to the Status of Refugees]] and [[United Nations Convention Against Torture|Convention against Torture]], and the Macedonian Constitution guarantees basic human rights to all citizens.

There do however continue to be problems with [[human rights]]. According to human rights organisations, in 2003 there were suspected extrajudicial executions, threats and intimidation against human rights activists and anti-regime journalists and allegations of [[torture]] by the police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.amnesty.org/report2003/mkd-summary-eng Amnesty International - Summary - Macedonia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hrw2006"&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/campaigns/macedonia/ Human Rights Watch - Campaigns - Conflict in Macedonia]&lt;/ref&gt;

The country also has issues with the human rights of [[ethnic minorities]], such as [[Albanians in the Republic of Macedonia|Albanians]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Serbs]], [[Roma in Macedonia|Roma]], [[Turks_in_the_Republic_of_Macedonia|Turks]], [[Aromanians]], [[Greeks]] and [[Vlachs]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}{{specify|date=November 2013}}{{examples|date=November 2013}}

Although Albanians have since 2002 been allowed to study in Albanian, before graduating from university they are required to pass a test of their comprehension and use of the [[Macedonian language]].&lt;ref name="hrw2001"&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/wr2k1/europe/macedonia.html Human Rights Watch - Macedonia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==HRW and Helsinki Watch==

According to [[Human Rights Watch]], many former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] citizens remain "effectively stateless"&lt;ref name="hrw2001" /&gt; as a result of a citizenship law drafted after Macedonia's secession from the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]].

Conflict between ethnic Albanian secesionists and the Macedonian government has resulted in serious violations of [[human rights]] on both sides.&lt;ref name="hrw2006" /&gt;

According to the [[International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights]], the following human rights abuses have been reported:&lt;ref name="Helsinki"&gt;[http://www.mhc.org.mk/search_result.asp?path=/eng/a_izveshtai/a_drugi_i_03_2006_1.htm&amp;search=Albanians Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2005 (MHC)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311004230/http://www.mhc.org.mk/search_result.asp?path=%2Feng%2Fa_izveshtai%2Fa_drugi_i_03_2006_1.htm&amp;search=Albanians |date=2007-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation broken|date=November 2013}}{{Failed verification|date=November 2013}}

==Ombudsman's Report==
{{Outdated section|date=November 2013}}
According to the [http://www.ombudsman.mk/default.aspx?Lan=EN Ombudsman’s Annual Report for 2005]
* The Public administration continues to show elements of bureaucratic behavior, inefficiency, inaction and non-interest about the needs of the citizen, as well as lack of awareness about their rights. Because of that the citizen fulfill their rights with difficulties, untimely and through long administrative procedures faced with misuses of official authorization, incompetent and careless behavior with disrespect of the human dignity and the legal regulative and its inappropriate implementation.
* The court proceedings since many years are slow and inefficient that is partially a result of subjective weaknesses because of incompetent and careless behavior, lack of sufficient training of the court and administrative personnel, but as well from objective condition and possibilities in which the court system is functioning. Because of this the clients cannot fulfill their right of trial in a reasonable deadline.
* In the police proceedings it was determined violation of human rights with excessive use of means of coercion and misuse of other police authorization by police officials.
* The Sector for internal control and professional standards shows unprofessional attitude in fulfillment of the function internal control mechanism by covering the negative condition during the police procedure, which obstructs the work of the Ombudsman.
* The Penitentionary system is overburdened and is functioning with numerous problems because of the bad material condition, disorganized security situation, unprofessional management of the houses of correction and borstal institutions and can not secure dignified stay of the convicted persons which places that group of population in the margins of the society.

The '''Infanticide Act''' ({{lang-sv|Barnamordsplakatet}}), often referred to as "Infanticide act of Gustav III" (''{{lang|sv|Gustav III:s barnamordsplakat}}'') after its instigator [[Gustav III of Sweden]], was a historical [[Law of Sweden|Swedish law]], which was introduced in 1778 and in effect until 1917, with alterations in 1856.

The law was introduced in order to prevent [[infanticide]]s, the killings of newborn children outside of marriage, and granted mothers both the right and the means for an [[anonymous birth]]. Its 1856 amendment however restricted this to a mere [[confidential birth]], where the [[midwife]] was ordered to keep the mother's name in a sealed envelope to allow the grown-up child to request undisclosure of its biological [[ancestry]].

== Original act of 1778 ==
The problem of infanticide was since long acknowledged to be affected by the social stigma condemning unmarried mothers: previously, a reform of 1741 abolished the [[Public humiliation]] punishment of ''[[Uppenbar kyrkoplikt]]'' for unmarried mothers to prevent infanticide,&lt;ref&gt;Ohlander, Ann-Sofie, Kärlek, död och frihet: historiska uppsatser om människovärde och livsvillkor i Sverige, Norstedt, Stockholm, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; and the Infanticide Act of 1778 was a continuation of this work.

It allowed for mothers to give birth anonymously, to spare them social embarrassment and difficulty. It also forbade the [[midwife]] to ask for the name of the father, which they had previously been obliged to do. The mother was allowed to leave her home area and give birth in an area where she was unknown without having to answer any questions about her identity. The birth certificate should only include the date of the birth and the name of the child, while its mother should be registered as "Mother Unknown".

The child would then be placed in an [[orphanage]]. However, if the father was known, he could bring the child from the orphanage, midwife or the home where the "anonymous" woman had given birth to his home as a foster child. The mother might then join him, officially as a nurse to care for the baby, and very often the couple got married. The child was then a legitimate child to the man and had his name. The word "[[stepmother]]" disappeared from most official papers, as a married woman taking care of the children in her household would be recognized legally as their mother.

== 1856 amendment ==
In 1856, the law was amended. The midwife was now ordered to advise the mother at a secret birth to write down her name and home address in a sealed envelope. The mother was then to have the [[vicar]] in the town where she gave birth to put his seal on it and keep it safe. The paper could also be kept at the birth registration office. The function of the paper was to enable the mother to claim her child if she should wish it after having left it after birth. They could also be opened on request by the child.

The law from 1856 states: ''“If a midwife is called upon during a confidential parturition, or, if she receives a woman in childbirth who wishes to remain anonymous, the midwife is prohibited to inquire about the name of the child's father, as well as to entice, persuade, extort, or to conduct further investigations into any potentially related information. Although the delivery may have been confidential, it is not the further task of a midwife to also conceal the child, nor to provide aid or assistance in such an undertaking. At a confidential parturition, the midwife is urged to advise the child’s mother to disclose her name and address onto a paper, sealed by herself, later to be assigned with the official seal of the vicar, to whom she is hastily to report the delivery. When the document has been signed by the concerned and provided with a seal by the vicar, the woman should be urged—for her own, as well as for the certitude of the child—to carefully store said document. ”''

== 1917 abolition ==
{{expand section|date=October 2015}}
In 1917, the law was abolished and the possibility to give birth anonymously was criminalized.

The '''International Disability Alliance''' (IDA), created in 1999, is an umbrella organization focused on improving awareness and rights for individuals with disabilities around the globe. The IDA works with [[Non-governmental organization|Non Governmental Organizations]] (NGO's), supranational organizations such as the [[United Nations]] (UN), as well as state governments in order to create legislation, fund disability programs in developing and industrialized countries, and advocate for people with disabilities around the world. The IDA works very closely with the United Nations, and in particular they use the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities|United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] (UNCRPD) as their code of conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.internationaldisabilityalliance.org/|title=International Disability Alliance|website=International Disability Alliance|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 7, 2013 the IDA became [[Incorporation (business)|legally incorporated]] and given legal status as an entity. What this means is that it has greater strength in its ability to negotiate better terms for people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.edf-feph.org/newsroom/news/historical-day-disability-movement-worldwide-international-disability-alliance-becomes|title=A historical day for the Disability Movement worldwide: The International Disability Alliance becomes a legal entity {{!}} European Disability Forum|website=www.edf-feph.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== IDA Leadership ==
Because the IDA is more of an umbrella organization, each member organization is free to govern themselves. However there is a high governing secretariat,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.internationaldisabilityalliance.org/secretariat|title=IDA Secretariat|website=International Disability Alliance|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; made up of fourteen people, based in New York and Geneva that oversees and guides the agenda. The leader of this secretariat is its Executive Director Vladimir Cuk. According to LinkedIn, Cuk has a Master's degree in disability studies, and previously held the position of director of the New York Secretariat of the IDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/vladimir-cuk-804bba6|title=LinkedIn|last=Cuk|first=Vladimir|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vladimir Cuk has been extensively involved with the U.N in its mission to better implement practices that improve lives of people with disabilities. In a speech to the U.N. Cuk outlined problems in the way the U.N was classifying people with disabilities, worried that it would give countries the ability to not follow through on implementing new reforms. “If we cannot give clear recommendations, member states have an excuse not to disaggregate data. So for us it is a red flag, and we are gravely worried we are witnessing these disagreements within the U.N. system.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.devex.com/news/there-is-a-major-obstacle-to-tracking-disability-inclusion-in-the-sdgs-90762|title=There is a major obstacle to tracking disability inclusion in the SDGs|date=2017-08-24|work=Devex|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuk also attended a meeting of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) in which he lobbied for countries to put in place measures to take care of individuals with disabilities during natural disasters and humanitarian crises. Cuk said  "In both wealthy and poor countries, we are getting reports that people with disabilities are the last to be reached and the last to be rescued. This results in a significantly disproportionate number of deaths for people with disabilities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.icrc.org/en/document/people-disabilities-emergencies|title=People with disabilities in emergencies|date=2015-05-07|work=International Committee of the Red Cross|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== IDA Mission ==
The UNCRPD created a framework regarding how countries should treat people with disabilities. The IDA's goal is to enforce these rules on a country by country basis. In a letter to the UN [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights]] (UNOHCHR), the IDA clearly stated their mission, "newborns with disabilities are murdered in different regions across the world for want of a family's capacity or willingness to take care of a child considered to be a burden."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/CEDAW/HarmfulPractices/InternationalDisabilityAlliance.pdf|title=IDA letter to the OHCHR of the UN|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IDA's mission is to change the way people regard people with disabilities. In many places around the world people with disabilities are regarded as defective or as the IDA put it "a burden." Through their 2030 initiative, the IDA hopes to have new services up and running to achieve this loss of stigma by 2030.

The IDA is working to help the UN implement their [[Sustainable Development Goals|sustainable development goals]] (SDG's) which provide a framework of standards countries should abide by. The IDA is particularly interested in goal #8 which specifically mentions persons with disabilities having the ability to become contributing members of society

== Prior Advocacy ==
The IDA along with its member organizations, lobbied the UN Council on Human Rights in order to advocate the fair treatment of women and children with Disabilities. This proposal was made to the UN Committee of the Rights of the Child and the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and Harmful Practices. This Committee focuses on the fair treatment of women, however the IDA broadened this to include women with disabilities because this population is particularly vulnerable. The proposal outlines several horrific practices that they would like to see abolished such as the rape of women with Disabilities and the forced abortion of children who will be disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/CEDAW/HarmfulPractices/InternationalDisabilityAlliance.pdf|title=IDA letter to the OHCHR of the UN|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 the IDA in partnership with the [[International Disability and Development Consortium]], wrote a position paper focused on how countries need to change their financing practices in order to better accommodate people with disabilities. These topics include changing the wording of laws to ensure persons with disabilities have the right to access social programs. In many developed countries, no citizen is barred from having access to social programs like welfare, however in under developed countries this right does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/CEDAW/HarmfulPractices/InternationalDisabilityAlliance.pdf|title=IDA position paper 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current Projects ==
Through the [https://wfdeaf.org/ World Federation of the Deaf] (WFD) the IDA is receiving funds from the Finnish government to provide resources for the deaf in Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia.

Member organization [https://ds-int.org/ Down Syndrome International] (DSI) is working on creating an international cardiac health protocol for individuals with Down Syndrome. This would give doctors around the world a set of guidelines on how to treat people with Down syndrome.

Member organization [http://inclusion-international.org/ Inclusion International] has filed a third party intervention in the Romanian court case Stoian v Romania in order to advocate for more inclusion in the Romanian school system.

The IDA along with the United Kingdom have plans to host a global summit, with world leaders and businesses, in order to further the cause of rights for individuals with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.devex.com/news/advocates-welcome-dfid-pledge-on-disability-warn-of-complexities-91654|title=Advocates welcome DFID pledge on disability, warn of complexities|date=2017-12-04|work=Devex|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, the IDA met with other disability advocates, and presented case studies of people with disabilities in various countries around the world. they did this both to highlight deficiencies in how countries are handling issues of inclusion, and also to highlight growth in cases where good changes have taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sdg.iisd.org/news/advocates-find-varying-inclusiveness-of-disability-in-vnrs/|title=Advocates Find Varying Inclusiveness of Persons with Disabilities in VNRs {{!}} News {{!}} SDG Knowledge Hub {{!}} IISD|last=Hub|first=IISD's SDG Knowledge|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Istitut Ladin Micurà de Rü''' is a government-financed cultural institute in [[South Tyrol]], [[Italy]], tasked with preserving and promoting the [[Ladin language]] and culture.

== Foundation and name ==
The institute was set up by the Autonomous Province Bolzano - South Tyrol on 31 July 1976 and formally started its activity on 3 September 1977 in the Ladin village [[San Martin de Tor]]. The institute was named in honour of the Ladin linguist [[Micurà de Rü]], who in 1833 published the first Ladin grammar ''"Versuch einer deütsch-ladinischen Sprachlehre"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.micura.it/eng/304.html |title=Ladin institute - Istitut Ladin Micurà de Rü |date= |accessdate=2011-03-07 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080730200318/http://www.micura.it/eng/304.html |archivedate= 30 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.micura.it/eng/331.html |title=Origin of the name - Istitut Ladin Micurà de Rü |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2008-03-20 |accessdate=2015-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080320100115/http://www.micura.it/eng/331.html |archivedate=20 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean-Marie Le Pen''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒɑ̃ ma.ʁi lə.pɛn}}; born 20 June 1928) is a French politician who served as President of the [[National Rally (France)|National Front]] from 1972 to 2011. A [[Member of the European Parliament]] (MEP) since 2004, he had previously been elected to the same position between 1984 and 2003. He also served as Honorary President of the National Front from 2011 to 2018.

Born and raised as a Roman Catholic in [[La Trinité-sur-Mer]], Le Pen first attended the [[Jesuit]] high school François Xavier in [[Vannes]] then Dupuy-de-Lôme in [[Lorient]]. After being dismissed from it in April for indiscipline, he briefly attended the high school Jules-Simon in Vannes before being dismissed again for indiscipline. Le Pen finally graduated from Claude-Debussy high school in Saint-Germain-en-Laye in 1947. He then entered the [[University of Paris|faculty of law in Paris]] and graduated from it in 1949. After his time in the military, he studied [[political science]] and law at [[Panthéon-Assas University]]. His graduate thesis, submitted in 1971 by him and Jean-Loup Vincent, was titled ''Le courant anarchiste en France depuis 1945'' or "''[[The anarchist movement in France since 1945]]''".

Le Pen focuses on issues related to [[immigration to France]], the [[European Union]], [[Traditional values|traditional culture and values]], [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]] and [[Economy of France|France's high rate of unemployment]]. His progression in the 1980s is known as the "lepénisation of spirits" due to its noticeable effect on mainstream political opinion. His controversial speeches and his integration into public life have made him a figure who polarizes opinion, considered as the "Devil of the Republic" among his opponents or as the "last samurai in politics" among his supporters.

His longevity in politics and his five attempts to become [[President of France]] have made him a major figure in [[Politics in France|French political life]]. His progress to the second round in the [[French presidential election, 2002|2002 presidential election]] left its mark on French public life and the "21st of April" is now a frequently used expression in France. He is currently a [[Member of the European Parliament]] (MEP) and served as the Honorary President of the National Front from January 2011 to March 2018. He was expelled from the party by his daughter [[Marine Le Pen]] in 2015, after new controversial statements.

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Jean Louis Marie Le Pen was the only son of Jean Le Pen (1901-1942). Jean Le Pen was born in French Brittany, like his ancestors and had started work at the age of 13 on a transatlantic vessel. He was the president of L'Association des Ancients Combattants and Councilor of La Trinité-sur-Mer.&lt;ref&gt;Le Pen, Jean-Marie. p45&lt;/ref&gt; Jean-Marie Le Pen's mother, Anne-Marie Hervé (1904&amp;ndash;1965) was a seamstress and also of local ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;Le Pen, Jean-Marie. p16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="genea"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jean-Marie Le Pen: genealogie|url=https://gw.geneanet.org/pierfit?lang=fr&amp;p=jean+marie&amp;n=le+pen&amp;oc=1|website=geneanet.org|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Pen was born on 20 June 1928 in [[La Trinité-sur-Mer]], a small seaside village in [[Brittany]], the son of Anne Marie Hervé and Jean Le Pen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linternaute.com/biographie/Jean-Marie-le-pen/ |title=Biographie Jean-Marie Le Pen |publisher=Linternaute.com |date=20 June 1928 |accessdate=21 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816131939/http://www.linternaute.com/biographie/jean-marie-le-pen/ |archive-date=16 August 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a fisherman. He was [[orphan]]ed as an adolescent (''pupille de la nation'', brought up by the state), when his father's boat ''La Persévérance'' was blown up by a mine in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Le Pen, Jean-Marie, p82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="genea"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fauchoux, Marc and Forcari, Christophe. p42&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised as a Roman Catholic and studied at the [[Jesuit]] high school François Xavier in [[Vannes]],&lt;ref&gt;Le Pen, Jean-Marie, p72&lt;/ref&gt; then at the ''[[lycée]]'' of [[Lorient]].&lt;ref&gt;Le Pen, Jean-Marie, p94&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1944, aged 16, he was turned down (because of his age) by Colonel Henri de La Vaissière (then representative of the [[French Communist Party|Communist Youth]]) when he attempted to join the [[French Forces of the Interior]] (FFI).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexpress.fr/info/france/elysee_2007/actu.asp?id=10247 Quand Le Pen voulait rejoindre les FFI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001030819/http://www.lexpress.fr/info/france/elysee_2007/actu.asp?id=10247 |date=1 October 2007 }}, ''[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]'', 28 March 2007 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then entered the [[University of Paris|faculty of law in Paris]], and started to sell the monarchist ''[[Action Française]]'''s newspaper, "''Aspects de la France''", in the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/biographies/IVRepublique/le-pen-Jean-Marie-20061928.asp |title=Assemblée nationale&amp;nbsp;– Les députés de la IVe République : Jean-Marie Le Pen |publisher=Assemblee-nationale.fr |date= |accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was repeatedly convicted of assault and battery (''coups et blessures'').&lt;ref name = "BioRFI"/&gt;

Le Pen started his political career as the head of the student union in [[Toulouse]]. He became president of the ''Association corporative des étudiants en droit'', an association of law students whose main occupation was to engage in street brawls against the "''Cocos''" ([[French Communist Party|communists]]). He was excluded from this organisation in 1951.

After his time in the military, he studied [[political science]] and law at [[Panthéon-Assas University]]. His graduate thesis, submitted in 1971 by him and Jean-Loup Vincent, was titled ''Le courant anarchiste en France depuis 1945'' or "''[[The anarchist movement in France since 1945]]''".

===Military service===
After receiving his law diploma, he enlisted in the [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]]. He arrived in [[French Indochina|Indochina]] after the 1954 [[battle of Dien Bien Phu]],&lt;ref name="BioRFI"/&gt; which had been lost by France and which prompted [[Prime Minister of France]] [[Pierre Mendès France]] to put an end to the [[First Indochina War|Indochina war]] at the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]]. Le Pen was then sent to [[Suez Crisis|Suez]] in 1956, but arrived only after the cease-fire.&lt;ref name="BioRFI"/&gt;

In 1953, a year before the beginning of the [[Algerian War]], he contacted President [[Vincent Auriol]], who approved Le Pen's proposed volunteer disaster relief project after a [[North Sea flood of 1953|flood in the Netherlands]]. Within two days, there were 40 volunteers from his university, a group that would later help victims of an earthquake in [[Italy]]. In Paris in 1956, he was elected to the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]] as a member of [[Pierre Poujade]]'s UDCA populist party. Le Pen has often presented himself as the youngest member of the Assembly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jean-Marie Le Pen|title=Biographie|url=http://www.jeanmarielepen.com/p/biographie.html|website=LE BLOG DE Jean-Marie Le Pen|accessdate=9 May 2017|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a young communist, André Chène, 27 years old and half a year younger, was elected in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sirinelli|first1=Jean-Francois|title=Vie politique française au xxe siècle|date=1995|publisher=Presses universitaires de France|location=Paris, France|pages=573|edition=first|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=André Chène|url=http://www2.assemblee-nationale.fr/sycomore/fiche/%28num_dept%29/1761|website=ASSEMBLÉE NATIONALE|accessdate=9 May 2017|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kauffmann|first1=Grégoire|title=La naissance du Front national : La réponse de l'auteur|journal=[[L'Histoire]]|date=December 2011|issue=370|pages=6|url=http://www.lhistoire.fr/la-naissance-du-front-national-la-r%C3%A9ponse-de-lauteur|accessdate=9 May 2017|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, Le Pen became the General Secretary of the National Front of Combatants, a veterans' organization, as well as the first French politician to nominate a Muslim candidate, Ahmed Djebbour, an Algerian, elected in 1957 as deputy of Paris. The next year, following his break with Poujade, he was reelected to the National Assembly as a member of the [[National Centre of Independents and Peasants|Centre National des Indépendants et Paysans]] (CNIP) party, led by [[Antoine Pinay]].

Le Pen claimed that he had lost his left eye when he was savagely beaten during the [[French legislative election, 1958|1958 election]] campaign. Testimonies suggest however that he was only wounded in the right eye and did not lose it. He lost the sight in his left eye years later, due to an illness. (Popular belief that he wears a [[glass eye]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} is unfounded.) During the 1950s, Le Pen took a close interest in the [[Algerian War]] (1954–62) and the French defence budget.

Elected deputy of the French Parliament under the [[Pierre Poujade|Poujadist]] banner, Le Pen voluntarily reengaged himself for two to three months in the French Foreign Legion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=CatusJack |url=http://www.dailymotion.com/relevance/search/Jean-Marie+Le+Pen+et+La+Torture/video/x446or_jeanmarie-le-pen-et-la-torture-13-e_politics |title=Jean-Marie Le Pen et La Torture [1/3&amp;#93; Excellent !&amp;nbsp;– une vidéo |publisher=Dailymotion |date= |accessdate=13 June 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was then sent to [[Algerian War|Algeria]] (1957) as an [[French secret services|intelligence officer]]. He has been accused of having engaged in [[torture during the Algerian War|torture]]. Le Pen has denied these accusations, although he admitted knowing of its use.&lt;ref name="BioRFI"/&gt;

===Far-right politics===
Le Pen directed the [[French presidential election, 1965|1965 presidential campaign]] of far-right candidate [[Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour]], who obtained 5.19% of the votes. He insisted on the rehabilitation of the [[Collaborationist]]s, declaring that:

{{Quote|Was General [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]] more brave than Marshal [[Philippe Pétain|Pétain]] in the occupied zone? This isn't sure. It was much easier to [[French Resistance|resist]] in [[London]] than to resist in France.&lt;ref name="BioRFI"/&gt;}}

In 1962, Le Pen lost his seat in the Assembly. He created the Serp (''Société d'études et de relations publiques'') firm, a company involved in the [[music industry]], which specialized in historical recordings and sold recordings of the choir of the [[Confédération Générale du Travail|CGT]] trade-union and songs of the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]], as well as [[Nazism|Nazi]] marches.

===National Front===

In 1972, Le Pen founded the [[National Front (France)|Front National]] (FN) party. He then ran in the [[French presidential election, 1974|1974 presidential election]], obtaining 0.74% of the vote.&lt;ref name="BioRFI"/&gt; In 1976, his Parisian flat was dynamited (he lived at that time in his castle of Montretout in Saint-Cloud). The crime was never solved.&lt;ref name="BioRFI"/&gt; Le Pen then failed to obtain the 500 signatures from "grand electors" (''grands électeurs'', mayors, etc.) necessary to present himself in the [[French presidential election, 1981|1981 presidential election]], won by the candidate of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] (PS), [[François Mitterrand]].

Criticizing immigration and taking advantage of the economic crisis striking France and the world since the [[1973 oil crisis]], Le Pen's party managed to increase its support in the 1980s, starting in the municipal elections of 1983. His popularity has been greatest in the south and east of France. The FN obtained 10% in the [[European Parliament election, 1984|1984 European elections]]. A total of 35 FN deputies entered the Assembly after the [[French legislative elections, 1986|1986 elections]] (the only legislative elections held under proportional representation), which were won by the right wing, bringing [[Jacques Chirac]] to Matignon in the first [[cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]] government (that is, the combination of a right-wing Prime minister, Chirac, with a socialist President, Mitterrand). In Paris, Jean-Marie Le Pen was elected in the National Assembly.

In 1984, Le Pen won a seat in the [[European Parliament]] and has been consistently reelected since then. In 1988 he lost his reelection bid for the [[French National Assembly]] in the [[Bouches-du-Rhône]]'s 8th constituency. He was defeated in the second round by [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist]] Marius Masse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/11/tribun/fiches_id/2110.asp Marius Masse] biography&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 Le Pen's invite to London by Conservative MPs was militantly protested by large numbers coordinated by the Campaign Against Fascism in Europe, CAFE, which led to a surge of anti-fascist groups and activity across Europe. In 1992 and 1998 he was elected to the [[List of regions in France|regional]] council of [[Provence-Alpes-Côte-d'Azur]].

[[Image:Jean-Marie Le Pen a son maison.jpg|left|thumb|Jean-Marie Le Pen, November 2005]]

Le Pen ran in the French presidential elections in 1974, 1988, 1995, 2002, and 2007. As noted above, he was not able to run for office in 1981, having failed to gather the necessary 500 signatures of elected officials. In the [[French presidential election, 2002|presidential elections of 2002]], Le Pen obtained 16.86% of the votes in the first round of voting. This was enough to qualify him for the second round, as a result of the poor showing by the PS candidate and incumbent prime minister [[Lionel Jospin]] and the scattering of votes among 15 other candidates. This was a major political event, both nationally and internationally, as it was the first time someone with such far right views had qualified for the second round of the French presidential elections. There was a widespread stirring of national public opinion as virtually the entire French political spectrum from the centre-right to the left united in fierce opposition to Le Pen's ideas. More than one million people in France took part in street rallies; slogans such as "vote for the crook, not the fascist" were heard in opposition to Le Pen. Le Pen was then defeated by a large margin in the second round, when incumbent president Jacques Chirac obtained 82% of the votes, thus securing the biggest majority in the history of the [[Fifth French Republic|Fifth Republic]].

In the [[French regional elections, 2004|2004 regional elections]], Le Pen intended to run for office in the [[Provence-Alpes-Côte-d'Azur]] region but was prevented from doing so because he did not meet the conditions for being a voter in that region: he neither lived there nor was registered as a taxpayer there. However, he was planned to be the FN's top candidate in the region for the [[French regional elections, 2010|2010 regional elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontnational.com/?p=1274 |title=FN list of candidates |publisher=Frontnational.com |date=25 August 2008 |accessdate=13 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002190335/http://www.frontnational.com/?p=1274 |archivedate= 2 October 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Pen again ran in the [[French presidential election, 2007|2007 French presidential election]] and finished fourth. His 2007 campaign, at the age of 78 years and 9 months, makes him the oldest candidate for presidential office in [[History of France|French history]].

After Le Pen left office in January 2011, his daughter [[Marine Le Pen]] was elected by the adherents of the party against [[Bruno Gollnisch]]. He became honorary chairman of the party&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/le-corre_france-a-critical-player.pdf|title=FRANCE: A CRITICAL PLAYER IN A WEAKENED EUROPE|last=LE CORRE|first=PHILIPPE|date=April 2017|website=www.brookings.edu|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and won his seat again at the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (France)|European elections in 2014]].

On 4 May 2015, Le Pen was suspended from the party after he refused to attend his disciplinary hearing at the party for describing the gas chambers used in concentration camps during the [[Holocaust]] as a "detail" of history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/05/world/europe/far-right-party-in-france-tries-to-push-jean-marie-le-pen-provocative-founder-to-the-margins.html|title=Far-Right Party in France Tries to Push Jean-Marie Le Pen, Provocative Founder, to the Margins|first1=Alissa J.|last1=Rubin|first2=Aurelien|last2=Breeden|date=4 May 2015|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Le Pen won two legal cases: the first one decided in June to cancel this dismissal of membership and the second one decided in July to stop voting operation. On 10 July 2015, the members of his party were to vote to accept or reject a whole series of measures aiming at changing the [[National Front (France)|National Front]]'s status including the Honorary Presidency of Le Pen. But on 8 July 2015, another French court ruled to suspend the vote and urged the party to organize a Congress in presence of its members as Le Pen sued the National Front again. The party decided to appeal against both of these decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2015/07/08/la-justice-donne-a-nouveau-raison-a-jean-marie-le-pen_4675601_823448.html |title=Jean-Marie Le Pen fait suspendre l'assemblée générale du FN |publisher=Lemonde.fr |date= |accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a French court decided to suspend the vote of its members, the FN decided, on 29 July 2015, to count the votes on the suppression of his Honorary Presidency, which showed that 94% of the members were in favor of this decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Un mot à ajouter ? |url=http://www.liberation.fr/politiques/2015/07/29/fn-94-des-adherents-approuvent-la-suppression-de-la-presidence-d-honneur_1355925 |title=Vote massif des adhérents FN contre Jean-Marie Le Pen, qui renonce à se présenter en Paca |publisher=Libération |date=29 July 2015 |accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberation.fr/direct/element/_14247/ |title=29 juillet 2015 à 19:40 |publisher=Libération |date= |accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the legal challenges to the FN's removal of Le Pen as its honorary president, he continued to officially hold the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Juridiquement, Jean-Marie Le Pen est toujours président d'honneur du FN | url=http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/politique/fn/juridiquement-jean-marie-le-pen-est-toujours-president-d-honneur-du-fn_1873324.html | date=27 January 2017 | publisher=''[[L'Express]]'' | accessdate=28 April 2017 | language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, Le Pen was expelled from the National Front after a special party congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34009901|title=French National Front expels founder Jean-Marie Le Pen|work=BBC News|date=20 August 2015|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since founded the [[Comités Jeanne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europe1.fr/politique/jean-marie-le-pen-lance-des-comites-jeanne-darc-au-secours-2697814|title=Jean-Marie Le Pen lance des comités "Jeanne d'Arc, au secours !"|website=www.europe1.fr|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valeursactuelles.com/politique/jean-marie-le-pen-cree-les-comites-jeanne-au-secours-pour-peser-sur-le-fn-60287|title=Jean-Marie Le Pen crée les comités "Jeanne, au secours!" pour peser sur le FN|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life, wealth and security===
[[Image:Le Pen Paris 2007 05 01 n5.jpg|right|thumb|Le Pen with his wife at a political rally in 2007]]

Le Pen's marriage to [[:fr:Pierrette Lalanne|Pierrette Lalanne]] from 29 June 1960 to 18 March 1987 resulted in three daughters; these daughters have given him nine granddaughters. The break-up of the marriage was somewhat dramatic, with his ex-wife posing nude in the French edition of ''[[Playboy]]'' to ridicule him.&lt;ref name="BioRFI"/&gt; Marie-Caroline, one of his daughters, broke with Le Pen, following her husband to join [[Bruno Mégret]], who split from the FN to found the rival [[National Republican Movement|Mouvement National Républicain]] (MNR, National Republican Movement).&lt;ref name="BioRFI"/&gt; The youngest of Le Pen's daughters, [[Marine Le Pen]], is leader of the [[National Front (France)|Front National]]. On 31 May 1991, Jean-Marie Le Pen married Jeanne-Marie Paschos ("Jany"), of [[Greek people|Greek]] descent. Born in 1933, Paschos was previously married to Belgian businessman Jean Garnier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eu.greekreporter.com/2014/06/02/the-greek-french-stepmother-of-marine-le-pen/|title=The Greek-French Stepmother of Marine Le Pen  {{!}} Greek Reporter Europe|website=eu.greekreporter.com|language=en-US|access-date=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, Le Pen inherited a fortune from Hubert Lambert (1934–1976), son of the cement industrialist Leon Lambert (1877–1952), one of three sons of Lambert Cement founder Hilaire Lambert. Hubert Lambert was a political supporter of Le Pen and a [[monarchist]] as well.&lt;ref name=BioRFI/&gt; Lambert's [[Will (law)|will]] provided 30 million francs (approximately 5 million euros) to Le Pen, as well as his opulent three-storey 11-room mansion at 8 Parc de Montretout, [[Saint-Cloud]], in the western suburbs of [[Paris]].

===Controversial statements===

Le Pen has been accused and convicted several times&lt;ref name=2004fine&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-93051559.html "Le Pen convicted of inciting racial hatred for anti-Muslim remarks"], ''Associated Press'', 2 April 2004.

A Paris court found in February 2005 that his verbal criticisms, such as remarks disparaging Muslims in a 2003 ''[[Le Monde]]'' interview, were "inciting racial hatred",&lt;ref name=2004fine /&gt; and he was fined 10,000 euros and ordered to pay an additional 5,000 euros in damages to the ''[[Ligue des droits de l'homme]]'' (League for Human Rights). The conviction and fines were upheld by the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]] in 2006.&lt;ref name=2006fine&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-123367529.html "France's far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen convicted of inciting racial hatred"], ''Associated Press'', 11 May 2006.

* In May 1987, he advocated the forced isolation from society of all people infected with HIV, by placing them in a special "sidatorium". "Sidaïque"&lt;ref&gt;"SIDA" = ''Syndrome d'Immuno-Déficience Acquise'', the French name for [[AIDS]]&lt;/ref&gt; is Le Pen's pejorative [[solecism]] for "person infected with AIDS" (the more usual French term is "[[serostatus|séropositif]]" (seropositive))&lt;ref name=aids&gt;[http://www.ina.fr/archivespourtous/index.php?vue=notice&amp;id_notice=I00005231 "Le Pen et le sida: les modes de contagion et l'exclusion"], ''L'Heure de vérité,'' [[Antenne 2]], 6 May 1987 (QuickTime video, French).

* On 21 June 1995, he attacked singer [[Patrick Bruel]], who is of Algerian Jewish descent, on his policy of no longer singing in the city of [[Toulon]] because the city had just elected a mayor from the National Front. Le Pen said, "the city of Toulon will then have to get along without the vocalisations of singer Benguigui". Benguigui, an Algerian name, is Bruel's birth name.
* In February 1997, Le Pen accused Chirac of being "on the payroll of Jewish organizations, and particularly of the [[B'nai B'rith]]"&lt;ref name=1997jewb&gt;Nicolas Domenach and Maurice Szafran, ''Le Roman d'un President'', Pion: 1997, {{ISBN|2-259-18188-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=1997jewr&gt;Douglas Johnson, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_199703/ai_n8760814/print "Ancient and Modern"]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''The Spectator'', 15 March 1997.

*On many occasions, before and after the FIFA World Cup, he claimed that the [[France national football team|French World Cup squad]] contained too many non-white players, and was not an accurate reflection of French society. He went on to scold players for not singing ''[[La Marseillaise]]'', saying they were not "French".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://football.guardian.co.uk/worldcup2006/story/0,,1809453,00.html | title = We are, Frenchmen says Thuram, as Le Pen bemoans number of black players | first = Dominic | last = Fifield | date = 30 June 2006 | publisher = The Guardian | accessdate =7 February 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2073351,00.html Far-Right Le Pen's Slurs Fail to Upset France's Quest For Glory] Deutsche Welle, 29 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguing that his party includes people of various ethnic or religious origins like Jean-Pierre Cohen, Farid Smahi or Huguette Fatna, he has attributed some anti-Semitism in France to the effects of Muslim immigration to Europe and suggested that some part of the Jewish community in France might eventually come to appreciate National Front ideology.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Le Pen has made statements [[climate change|denying climate change]] and linking climate science and [[communism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Arthur Neslen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/18/french-national-front-launches-nationalist-environmental-movement |title=French National Front launches nationalist environmental movement |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prosecution concerning Holocaust denial===
Le Pen has made several provocative statements concerning the [[Holocaust]] which have been interpreted by the legal system as constituting [[Holocaust denial]]. He has been convicted of racism or inciting racial hatred at least six times.&lt;ref name="2004fine"/&gt; Thus, on 13 September 1987, he said, "I ask myself several questions. I'm not saying the gas chambers didn't exist. I haven't seen them myself. I haven't particularly studied the question. But I believe it's just a detail in the history of [[World War II]]." For Le Pen, the French deportation of 76,000 Jews from France to [[Nazi concentration camps]], where they were killed, is a trivial matter, and he denies that 6 million Jews were killed, saying "I don't think there were that many deaths. There weren't 6 million ... There weren't mass murders as it's been said."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/frances-national-front-party-founder-jean-marie-le-pen-says-the-battle-is-already-won/2017/03/20/8161bee8-08e3-11e7-bd19-fd3afa0f7e2a_story.html|title=France's National Front co-founder Jean-Marie Le Pen says the battle is already won|last=McAuley|first=James|date=20 March 2017|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=15 November 2017|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was eventually condemned under the [[Gayssot Act]] to pay 1.2 million [[French Franc|francs]] (183,200 euros).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Jean-Marie Le Pen renvoyé devant la justice pour ses propos sur l'Occupation | publisher = [[Le Monde]] | url = http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3224,36-794895@51-776560,0.html/ | date = 13 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the [[European Parliament]], of which Le Pen was then a member, removed his [[parliamentary immunity]] so that Le Pen could be tried by a German court in [[Germany]], for comments he made at a December 1996 press conference before the German [[Republicans (Germany)|Republikaner]] party. Echoing his 1987 remarks in France, Le Pen stated: "If you take a 1,000-page book on World War II, the concentration camps take up only two pages and the gas chambers 10 to 15 lines. This is what one calls a detail." In June 1999, a [[Munich]] court found this statement to be "minimizing the Holocaust, which caused the deaths of six million Jews," and convicted and fined Le Pen for his remarks.&lt;ref name=1999fine&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-23235520.html "Le Pen Convicted for Racial Hatred"], ''Associated Press'', 2 June 1999. Retrieved 18 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Le Pen retorted ironically: "I understand now that it's the Second World War which is a detail of the history of the gas chambers."&lt;ref&gt;[[20 minutes (Switzerland)|20 minutes]] [http://www.20minutes.fr/ledirect/1016873/jean-marie-pen-propos-chambres-gaz-antisemites]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other legal problems and allegations===

*'''Prosecution for assault : ''' In April 2000, Le Pen was suspended from the [[European Parliament]] following prosecution for the physical assault of Socialist candidate [[Annette Peulvast-Bergeal]] during the 1997 general election. This ultimately led to him losing his seat in the European parliament in 2003. The Versailles appeals court banned him from seeking office for one year.&lt;ref name=1998ban&gt;Julian Nundy, [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-18675114.html "One-year election ban for Le Pen"], ''The Scotsman'', 18 November 1998. Retrieved 18 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Statements about Muslims in France : ''' In 2005 and 2008, Le Pen was fined, in both case 10,000 euros for "incitement to discrimination, hatred and violence towards a group of people", on account of statements made about Muslims in France. In 2010. the [[European Court of Human Rights]] declared Le Pen's application inadmissible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=867478&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 ECtHR Admissibility decision in case No. 18788/09] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Allegations of war crimes in Algeria : ''' Le Pen allegedly practiced [[torture]] during the [[Algerian War]] (1954–1962), when he was a lieutenant in the French Army. Although he denied it, he lost a trial when he attacked ''[[Le Monde]]'' newspaper on charges of [[defamation]], following accusations by the newspaper that he had used torture. ''Le Monde'' has produced in May 2003 the [[dagger]] he allegedly used to commit [[war crime]]s as court evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=804499 "L'affaire du poignard du lieutenant Le Pen en Algérie"], ''[[Le Monde]]'', 17 March 2003 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although war crimes committed during the Algerian War are [[amnesty|amnestied]] in France, this was publicised by the newspapers ''[[Le Canard Enchaîné]]'', ''[[Libération]]'', and ''Le Monde'', and by [[Michel Rocard]] (ex-[[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]]) on TV ([[TF1]] 1993). Le Pen sued the papers and Michel Rocard. This affair ended in 2000 when the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Cour de cassation]] (French supreme jurisdiction) concluded that it was legitimate to publish these assertions. However, because of the amnesty and the [[statute of limitations]], there can be no criminal proceedings against Le Pen for the crimes he is alleged to have committed in Algeria. In 1995, Le Pen unsuccessfully sued Jean Dufour, regional counselor of the [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]] ([[French Communist Party]]) for the same reason.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.algeria-watch.org/fr/article/hist/1954-1962/lepen_torture.htm "Le Pen et la torture, l'enquete du "Monde" validée par le tribunal"], ''[[Le Monde]]'', 28 June 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=758856 "J'ai croisé Le Pen à la villa Sésini" (I bumped into Le Pen in the Sesini Villa)], interview with [[Paul Aussaresses]] (who had argued in favor of the use of torture in Algeria), ''Le Monde'', 4 June 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=754007 "Un lourd silence"], ''Le Monde'', 5 May 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.humanite.fr/journal/2002-05-02/2002-05-02-33187 "Quand Le Pen travaillait 20 heures par jour"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515022811/http://www.humanite.fr/journal/2002-05-02/2002-05-02-33187 |date=15 May 2006 }} in ''[[L'Humanité]]'', 2 May 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.humanite.fr/journal/2002-06-04/2002-06-04-34925 "New Revelations on Le Pen, tortionary"] {{dead link|date=June 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} in ''[[L'Humanité]]'', 4 June 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.humanite.fr/journal/1995-04-04/1995-04-04-722345 "Le Pen attaque un élu du PCF en justice"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929131821/http://www.humanite.fr/journal/1995-04-04/1995-04-04-722345 |date=29 September 2007 }}, in ''[[L'Humanité]]'', 4 April 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.humanite.fr/journal/1995-07-26/1995-07-26-730510 Jean Dufour: "Le Pen vient d'être débouté"] {{dead link|date=June 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, in ''[[L'Humanité]]'', 26 June 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.humanite.fr/journal/2003-06-27/2003-06-27-374693 "Torture: Le Pen perd son procès en diffamation contre Le Monde"]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, in ''[[L'Humanité]]'', 27 June 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of European Reform Treaty===
Le Pen has been a vocal critic of the European Reform Treaty (formally known as the [[Treaty of Lisbon]]) which was signed by EU member states on 13 December 2007, and entered into force on 1 December 2009. In October 2007, Le Pen suggested that he would personally visit [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] to assist the "No" campaign but finally changed his mind, fearing that his presence would be used against the supporters of the NO vote. Ireland finally refused to ratify the treaty. Ireland is the only EU country which had a citizen referendum. All other EU states, including France, ratified the treaty by parliamentary vote, despite a previous citizen referendum where over 55% of French voters rejected the European Reform Treaty (although that vote was on a different draft of the Treaty in the form of the Constitutional Treaty).{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

After the Irish "No" vote, Le Pen addressed the French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] in the [[European Parliament]], accusing him of furthering the agenda of a "cabal of international finance and free market fanatics." Ireland has since accepted the treaty in a second Lisbon referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8288181.stm|title=

===Public perception===
Le Pen is often nicknamed the "[[Menhir]]", due to his "granitic nature" as he is perceived as someone who does not give way to pressure or who cannot be easily knocked down. It also connects him to France's Celtic origins.&lt;ref name="books.google.fr"&gt;José Pedro Zúquete, [https://books.google.fr/books?id=7HsXCJBRZS8C&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=Jean-Marie+Le+Pen+menhir&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Hc-lVIbLHoOsadmngZAM&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Jean-Marie%20Le%20Pen%20menhir&amp;f=false Missionary Politics in Contemporary Europe ]&lt;/ref&gt; Le Pen is often described as one of the most flamboyant and charismatic orators in Europe, whose speech blends folksy humour, crude attacks and rhetorical finesse.&lt;ref name="books.google.fr"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=1wl9AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT171&amp;dq=Jean+marie+le+pen+orator&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tv-wVLOHJ8TkaIXQgKAE&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Jean%20marie%20le%20pen%20orator&amp;f=false |author=Josep M.

However, Le Pen remains a polarizing figure in France: opinions regarding him tend to be quite strong. A 2002 [[IPSOS]] poll showed that while 22% of the electorate have a good or very good opinion of Le Pen, and 13% an unfavorable opinion, 61% have a very unfavorable opinion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipsos.fr/CanalIpsos/poll/7542.asp Ipsos.fr&amp;nbsp;– Political Action Barometer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050318215522/http://www.ipsos.fr/CanalIpsos/poll/7542.asp |date=18 March 2005 }} (French)&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Pen and the National Front are described by much of the media and nearly all commentators as far right. Le Pen himself and the rest of his party disagree with this label; earlier in his political career, Le Pen described his position as "neither right, nor [[left wing|left]], but French" (''ni droite, ni gauche, français''). He later described his position as right-wing and opposed to the "socialo-communists" and other right-wing parties, which he deems are not real right-wing parties. At other times, for example during the 2002 election campaign, he declared himself "socially left-wing, economically right-wing, nationally French" (''socialement à gauche, économiquement à droite, nationalement français''). He further contends that most of the French political and media class are corrupt and out of touch with the real needs of the common people, and conspire to exclude Le Pen and his party from mainstream politics. Le Pen criticizes the other political parties as the "establishment" and lumped all major parties ([[French Communist Party|Communist]], [[French Socialist Party|Socialist]], [[Union for French Democracy]] (UDF) and [[Rally for the Republic]] (RPR)) into the "Gang of Four" (''la bande des quatre''&amp;nbsp;– an allusion to the [[Gang of Four]] during China's [[Cultural Revolution]]).

===Relations with other groups===
Some of Le Pen's statements led other right-wing groups, such as the [[Austrian Freedom Party]],&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Crumley in ''[[Time International]]'' magazine, (5 June 2002) writes: "Denunciations of Jean-Marie Le Pen and his xenophobic National Front (FN) as racist, anti-Semitic and hostile to minorities and foreigners aren't exactly new. More novel, however, are such condemnations coming from far-right movements like the [[Austrian Freedom Party]] (FPO), which itself won international opprobrium in 1999 after entering government on a [[Populism|populist]] platform similar to Le Pen's."&lt;/ref&gt; and some National Front supporters, to distance themselves from him. Controversial Dutch anti-Islam lawmaker [[Geert Wilders]], who has often been accused of being far-right, has also criticized Le Pen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11469579 | work=BBC News | title=In quotes: Geert Wilders | date=4 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bruno Mégret]] left the National Front to found his own party (the [[National Republican Movement]], MNR), claiming that Le Pen kept the Front away from the possibility of gaining power. Mégret wanted to emulate [[Gianfranco Fini]]'s success in [[Italy]] by making it possible for right-wing parties to ally themselves with the Front, but claimed that Le Pen's attitude and outrageous speech prevented this. Le Pen's daughter [[Marine Le Pen|Marine]] leads an internal movement of the Front that wants to "normalize" the National Front, "de-[[enclave]]" it, have a "culture of government" etc.; however, relations with Le Pen and other supporters of the hard line are complex.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Le Canard Enchaîné]]'', 9 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Le Pen's National Front electoral successes along with the party gaining wider public prominence led to suggestions for the renewal of the pan-European alliance of extreme-right parties with Le Pen as its figurehead,&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/jan/08/uk.eu Romania's first gift to the European Union&amp;nbsp;– a caucus of neo-fascists and Holocaust deniers]" by Ian Traynor, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 8 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; a suggestion that eventually did indeed bring about the establishment of the [[Europe of Nations and Freedom]] group in the [[European Parliament]], chaired by Le Pen's daughter Marine.

Conservative commentator and author [[Ann Coulter]] called him an "anti-American adulterer" but said his anti-immigration, anti-Muslim message "finally hit a nerve with voters" after years of irrelevance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/coulter050202.asp | title = French voters tentatively reject dynamiting Notre Dame | author = Coulter, Ann | publisher = [[Jewish World Review]] | date = 2 May 2002 | accessdate =7 February 2007 | authorlink = Ann Coulter }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paleoconservatism|Paleoconservative]] commentator [[Pat Buchanan]] contends that even though Le Pen "made radical and foolish statements," the EU violated his right to freedom of speech.&lt;ref name = Buchanan&gt;{{cite news | title = True Fascists of the New Europe | url = http://www.theamericancause.org/pattruefascists.htm | author = Buchanan, Pat | publisher = The American Cause | date = 30 April 2002 | accessdate =7 February 2007 | authorlink = Pat Buchanan }}&lt;/ref&gt; Buchanan wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As it is often the criminal himself who is first to cry, "Thief!" so it is usually those who scream, "Fascist!" loudest who are the quickest to resort to anti-democratic tactics. Today, the greatest threat to the freedom and independence of the nations of Europe comes not from Le Pen and that 17% of French men and women who voted for him. It comes from an intolerant European Establishment that will accept no rollback of its powers or privileges, nor any reversal of policies it deems "progressive".&lt;ref name = Buchanan/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A '''joint session''' or '''joint convention''' is, most broadly, when two normally separate [[Decision making|decision]]-making groups meet together, often in a [[special session]] or other extraordinary meeting, for a specific purpose.

Most often it refers to when both houses of a [[bicameral]] [[legislature]] sit together. A joint session typically occurs to receive foreign or domestic [[diplomat]]s or [[leader]]s, or to allow both houses to consider [[bill (law)|bill]]s together.

Some constitutions give special power to a joint session, voting by majority of all members of the legislature regardless of which house or chamber they belong to. For example, in Switzerland a joint session of the two houses elects the members of the Federal Council (cabinet). In [[India]], disputes between houses are resolved by a joint sitting but without an intervening election.&lt;ref name="President summons joint sitting of Parliament"&gt;{{cite news|title=President summons joint sitting of Parliament |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2002-03-22/news/27358290_1_rajya-sabha-joint-session-anti-terrorism-bill |accessdate=31 July 2012 |newspaper=The Economic Times |date=Mar 22, 2002 |agency=PTI |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69YZE2vx4?url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2002-03-22/news/27358290_1_rajya-sabha-joint-session-anti-terrorism-bill |archivedate=31 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Australia ==
In the [[Parliament of Australia|Australian federal parliament]], a joint sitting can be held, under certain conditions, to overcome a deadlock between the two houses. For a deadlock to be declared, a [[bill (law)|bill]] has to be rejected twice by the Senate at an interval of at least three months, after which a [[double dissolution]] election can be held. If, following the election, the new parliament is still unable to pass the bill, it may be considered by a joint sitting of the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[Australian Senate|Senate]], and must achieve an absolute majority of the total number of members and senators in order to pass. The only example of this occurring was the [[Joint Sitting of the Australian Parliament of 1974]] under the [[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government, at which six deadlocked bills were passed.

Because the House has twice as many members as the Senate, the former has an advantage in a joint sitting. However, the voting system used for the Senate before 1949, which might be called "multiple at-large voting", often led to landslide if not wipe-out results in each state, resulting in a winning margin over the whole of Australia of up to 36-0. That would have given the party or grouping enjoying such a large Senate majority an advantage in any joint sitting, had there been one.

The voting system now used for the Senate, [[single transferable vote|quota-preferential proportional representation]], almost inevitably leads to very evenly divided results. Six senators are elected from each state and two from each territory. A party or grouping has to get at least 57% of the vote in any State to obtain a four-two majority of seats in that state, whereas from 51% to 56% of the vote yields only an equality of three seats to each major party or group.

==Austria==
{{further|Federal Assembly (Austria)}}
The Federal Assembly is a formal joint session of the two houses of the bicameral [[Austrian Parliament]], to swear the elected President of Austria into office.

==Belgium==
{{further|Belgian Federal Parliament}}
The [[Chamber of Representatives (Belgium)|Chamber of Representatives]] and the [[Senate (Belgium)|Senate]] convene as United Chambers ({{lang-nl|Verenigde Kamers}}; {{lang-fr|Chambres réunies}}; {{lang-de|Vereinigten Kammern}}) to swear the [[Monarchy of Belgium|King]] into office, as stipulated by article 91 of the Constitution.

== Canada ==
The [[Canadian government]] procedure is called a [[joint address (Canada)|joint address]], with the members of the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] attending the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] as guests. There is no procedure in Canada for both chambers of the [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] to sit in a true joint session.

Various [[government agencies]] and [[non-governmental organization]]s may also meet jointly to handle problems which each of the involved parties has a [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stake]] in.

== France ==
The [[Congress of France]] is an assembly of both houses of the [[Parliament of France|French Parliament]], convened at the [[Palace of Versailles]], which can approve certain amendments to the [[Constitution of France|constitution]] by a three-fifth majority of all members. Since 2008, the Congress may also be convened to hear an address from the [[President of France|President of the Republic]].

==Germany==
The [[Federal Convention (Germany)|Federal Convention]] elects the [[President of Germany]]. It includes members from the [[Bundestag]] and representatives of the [[States of Germany]].

== India ==

In [[India]], if an ordinary [[bill (law)|bill]] has been rejected by any house of the [[Parliament of India|parliament]] and if more than six months have elapsed, the [[President of India|President]] may summon a joint session for purpose of passing the bill. The bill is passed by a simple majority of a joint sitting. Since the [[lower house]] ([[Lok Sabha]]) has more than twice the members of the upper house ([[Rajya Sabha]]),&lt;ref name="Rajya Sabha"&gt;{{cite web|title=RAJYA SABHA - AN INTRODUCTION|url=http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/about_parliament/rajya_sabha_introduction.asp|publisher=rajyasabha.nic.in|accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lok Sabha"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lok Sabha|url=http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/intro/introls.htm|publisher=parliamentofindia.nic.in|accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a group commanding a majority in the lower house of the [[Government of India]] can pass such a bill even if it was previously rejected by the upper house.

So far, [[Joint Session of Indian Parliament]] has been called for only three [[bill (law)|bill]]s - the [[Dowry Prohibition Act, 1960|Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961]], the Banking Service Commission Repeal Bill, 1978, and the [[Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002]] - have been passed at joint sessions.&lt;ref name="President summons joint sitting of Parliament"/&gt;&lt;ref name="782 MPs await novel joint session"&gt;{{cite news |title=782 MPs await novel joint session |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2002-03-23/news/27343982_1_rajya-sabha-joint-session-controversial-anti-terrorism-bill |accessdate=31 July 2012 |newspaper=The Economic Times |date=Mar 23, 2002 |agency=TNN }}&lt;/ref&gt;//

==Ireland==
In the [[Irish Free State]], the predecessor of the [[Republic of Ireland]], the [[Governor-General's Address to Dáil Éireann|Governor-General's Address]] to both houses was made to [[Dáil Éireann (Irish Free State)|the lower house]], with [[Seanad Éireann (Irish Free State)|Senators]] invited to attend.

== Philippines ==
In the [[Philippines]], [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] can convene in a joint session for the following:
*To declare the existence of a state of war
*Canvassing of votes after a [[Philippine presidential election|presidential election]]
*Every [[State of the Nation Address (Philippines)|State of the Nation Address]]
*Revocation or extension of the
**Proclamation of martial law, or 
**Suspension of the privilege of the [[writ of habeas corpus]]

While the State of the Nation address occurs annually, and presidential elections occur every six years, the only time that the other two conditions were met after the approval of the 1987 [[Constitution of the Philippines|constitution]] was after the declaration of martial law in [[Maguindanao]] after the [[Maguindanao massacre]].

Joint sessions are typically held at the seat of the House of Representatives, which is at the [[Batasang Pambansa Complex]], [[Quezon City]].

== United Kingdom ==
{{see also|List of people who have addressed both Houses of the United Kingdom Parliament}}
[[List of English monarchs|English]] and later [[List of British monarchs|British monarchs]] have jointly addressed the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and the [[House of Lords]] since the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Diamond Jubilee"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17438874 |title=Diamond Jubilee: Queen rededicates herself to UK |date=20 March 2012 |accessdate=7 December 2012 |publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1939, foreign heads of state and dignitaries have been invited to address both houses of Parliament, the first to do so was [[President of France|French President]] [[Albert Lebrun]] in March 1939.&lt;ref name=both&gt;{{Cite web|title=Addresses to both Houses of Parliament since 1939|url=http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN04092|publisher=House of Commons Library|accessdate=21 February 2015|date=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[speech from the throne]] upon the [[State Opening of Parliament]] is made before a joint sitting of both Houses. This occurs in the House of Lords, the upper chamber, due to the [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] that the monarch never enters the House of Commons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State Opening of Parliament|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/occasions/stateopening/|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The closing of each of parliamentary session is also marked by a speech to both Houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prorogation|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/occasions/prorogation/|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States ==
{{Main article|Joint session of the United States Congress}}
The [[State of the Union Address]] of the [[president of the United States]] is traditionally made before a "joint session" of the [[United States Congress]]. Many states refer to an analogous event as a "joint convention".  Such assemblies are typically held in the chamber of the [[lower house]] as the larger body. [[State constitution (United States)|State constitutions]] of [[U.S. state]]s may require joint conventions for other purposes; for example [[Tennessee]]'s requires such to elect the [[Tennessee Secretary of State|secretary of state]], the state treasurer, and the comptroller of the treasury.

The first foreign dignitary to address a joint session of Congress was Ambassador [[André Lefebvre de La Boulaye|André de La Boulaye]] of France who addressed a joint session on May 20, 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.house.gov/Institution/Foreign-Leaders/Joint-Sessions/ |title=Office of Art and Archives of the U.S. House of Representatives - Joint Meeting &amp; Joint Session Addresses Before Congress by Foreign Leaders &amp; Dignitaries |publisher=Artandhistory.house.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front''' ({{lang-fr|Front de Libération Nationale Kanak et Socialiste}}, FLNKS) is a pro-independence alliance of political parties in [[New Caledonia]]. It was founded in 1984 at a congress of various political parties. Its supporters are mostly from the [[Kanak people|Kanak]] indigenous population but also include supporters from other ethnic communities.

==History==
This is composed of the [[Caledonian Union]] (UC) (a centre-left formerly multi-ethnic party dating back to the early postwar period) on the one hand and the [[Nationalist Unions for Independence]] (UNI) on the other. The UNI includes [[Melanesian Progressive Union]] (a political movement based on the island's west coast and mainly around the village of Poya, where its founder, the late Edmond Nekiriai hails from), the [[Oceanian Democratic Rally]] (a [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] ([[Wallis and Futuna|Wallisian-and-Futunian]]) based party) and the [[Party of Kanak Liberation]] (PALIKA), a more radical party founded by left-leaning students that came back from France after the [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968 riots]]. Both the UC and UNI are of approximately equal size, and with varying rhetoric. However, all support the independence of [[New Caledonia]]. The party boycotted the [[New Caledonian independence referendum, 1987|1987 independence referendum.]]&lt;ref name=DD&gt;[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=nc011987 New Caledonia (France), 13 September 1987: Status] Direct Democracy {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party has been divided since the early 1990s between the Caledonian Union and UNI, and, as a result, the two factions often run candidates and lists against each other and neither can agree on a leader of the FLNKS. The coalition only has a spokesperson, Victor Tutugoro.

An attempt to re-unite the party was made on the occasion of the [[French legislative election, 2007|2007 legislative elections]] in France, in which both New Caledonian [[Constituency (France)|constituencies]] were up for election. In [[New Caledonia's 1st constituency]], Charles Washetine, a member of UNI-Palika ran with a Caledonian Union running mate. In [[New Caledonia's 2nd constituency]], the leader of the Caledonian Union, Charles Pidjot, ran with a UNI-Palika running mate. However, both were defeated by the candidates of [[The Rally-UMP]].

The FLNKS ran a common list in the [[South Province, New Caledonia|South Province]] in the [[New Caledonian legislative election, 2009|2009 election]] which obtained 8.82% and 4 seats in the province. In the province during the [[New Caledonian legislative election, 2004|2004 elections]], the pro-independence faction was divided and did not win any seats.

The '''labour movement''' or '''labor movement'''&lt;ref&gt;See [[American and British English spelling differences]].&lt;/ref&gt; consists of two main wings, the '''trade union movement''' ([[British English]]) or '''labor union movement''' ([[American English]]), also called '''trade unionism''' or '''labor unionism''' on the one hand, and the '''political labour movement''' on the other.

* The trade union movement consists of the [[collective]] organisation of [[Working class|working people]] developed to represent and campaign for better working conditions and treatment from their employers and, by the implementation of [[labour and employment law]]s, from their governments. The standard unit of organisation is the [[trade union]].

* The political labour movement in many countries includes a [[political party]] that represents the interests of employees, often known as a "[[List of political parties named "Labour Party" or similar|labour party]]" or "[[workers' party]]". Many individuals and political groups otherwise considered to represent [[ruling class]]es may be part of and active in the labour movement.

The labour movement developed in response to the depredations of industrial [[capitalism]] at about the same time as [[socialism]]. However, while the goal of the labour movement is to protect and strengthen the interests of labour within capitalism, the goal of socialism is to replace the capitalist system entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Eatwell &amp; Wright|first= Roger &amp; Anthony|title= Contemporary Political Ideologies: Second Edition |publisher= Bloomsbury Academic|date=March 1, 1999|isbn= 978-0826451736|page = 83|quote= If ‘labourism’ sought to protect and defend the interests of labour in relation to this system, ‘socialism’ sought to change the system itself...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Europe]], the labour movement began during the [[industrial revolution]], when agricultural jobs declined and employment moved to more industrial areas. The idea met with great resistance. In the early 19th century, groups such as the [[Tolpuddle Martyrs]] of [[Dorset]] were punished and [[penal transportation|transported]] for forming unions, which was against the laws of the time.

Trade unionism was active during the early to mid 19th century and various labour parties and trade unions were formed throughout the industrialised parts of the world. The [[International Workingmen's Association]], the first attempt at international coordination, was founded in London in 1864. The major issues included the right of the workers to organize themselves, and the right to an 8-hour working day. In 1871 workers in France rebelled and the Paris Commune was formed. From the mid-nineteenth century onward the labour movement became increasingly globalised.

{{cquote| Labour has been central to the modern globalization process. From issues of the embodied movement of workers to the emergence of a global division of labour, and organized responses to capitalist relations of production, the relevance of labour to globalization is not new, and it is far more significant in shaping the world than is usually recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=2007 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= O’Brien | first2= Robert | title= Globalization and Economy, Vol. 4: Globalizing Labour | url= https://www.academia.edu/4303461/Globalization_and_Economy_Vol._4_Globalizing_Labour_editor_with_Robert_OBrien_Sage_Publications_London_2007 | publisher= Sage Publications |location=London | pages= ix-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The movement gained major impetus during the late 19th and early 20th centuries from the [[Catholic Social Teaching]] tradition which began in 1891 with the publication of [[Pope Leo XIII]]'s foundational document, ''[[Rerum novarum]]'', also known as "On the Condition of the Working Classes," in which he advocated a series of reforms including limits on the length of the work day, a living wage, the elimination of child labour, the rights of labour to organise, and the duty of the state to regulate labour conditions.

Throughout the world, action by labourists has resulted in reforms and [[labor rights|workers' rights]], such as the two-day [[Workweek|weekend]], [[minimum wage]], paid [[holiday]]s, and the achievement of the [[eight-hour day]] for many workers. There have been many important labour activists in modern history who have caused changes that were revolutionary at the time and are now regarded as basic. For example, [[Mary Harris Jones]], better known as "Mother Jones", and the [[National Catholic Welfare Council]] were important in the campaign to end [[child labour]] in the [[United States]] during the early 20th century.

==Labour parties==
{{see also|List of Labour Parties}}
Modern labour parties originated from an increase in organising activities in [[Europe]] and [[European colonialism|European colonies]] during the 19th century, such as the [[Chartism|Chartist movement]] in the [[United Kingdom]] during 1838&amp;ndash;50.

In 1891, localised labour parties were formed, by trade union members in the British colonies of [[Australia]]. They later amalgamated to form the [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP). In 1893, Members of Parliament in the [[Queensland|Colony of Queensland]] briefly formed the world's first labour [[government]].

The [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]] was created as the [[British Labour Party#Labour Representation Committee|Labour Representation Committee]], as a result of an 1899 resolution by the [[Trade Union Congress]].

While archetypal labour parties are made of direct union representatives, in addition to members of geographical branches, some union federations or individual unions have chosen not to be represented within a labour party and/or have ended association with them.

==Labour festivals==
{{main|Labour festival}}
Labour festivals have long been a part of the labour movement. Often held outdoors in the summer, the music, talks, food, drink, and film have attracted hundreds of thousands of attendees each year.

==Labour and racial equality==
{{Expand section|date=July 2011}}

A degree of strategic bi-racial cooperation existed among [[New Orleans Dock Workers and Unionization|black and white dockworkers on the waterfronts of New Orleans]], Louisiana during the early 20th century. Although the groups maintained racially separate labour unions, they coordinated efforts to present a united front when making demands of their employers. These pledges included a commitment to the "50-50" or "half-and-half" system wherein a dock crew would consist of 50% black and 50% white workers and agreement on a single wage demand to reduce the risk of ship owners pitting one race against the other.  Black and white dockworkers also cooperated during protracted labour strikes, including [[1892 New Orleans general strike|general levee strikes in 1892]] and 1907 as well as smaller strikes involving skilled workers such as screwmen in the early 1900s.

{{quotation|Negroes in the United States read the history of labour and find it mirrors their own experience. We are confronted by powerful forces telling us to rely on the good will and understanding of those who profit by exploiting us [...] They are shocked that action organizations, sit-ins, civil disobedience and protests are becoming our everyday tools, just as strikes, demonstrations and union organization became yours to insure that bargaining power genuinely existed on both sides of the table [...] Our needs are identical to labor's needs: decent wages, fair working conditions, livable housing, old age security, health and welfare measures [...] That is why the labor-hater and labor-baiter is virtually always a twin-headed creature spewing anti-Negro epithets from one mouth and anti-labor propaganda from the other mouth.| [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King, Jr]], ''"If the Negro Wins, Labor Wins"'', December 11, 1961&lt;ref&gt;''A Testament of Hope: The Essential Writings and Speeches of Martin Luther King, Jr'', edited by James Melvin Washington, HarperCollins, 1991, {{ISBN|0-06-064691-8}}, pg 202-203&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Development of labour movements within nation states ==
Historically [[Labour economics|labour markets]] have often been constrained by national borders that have restricted movement of workers. Labour laws are also primarily determined by individual nations or states within those nations. While there have been some efforts to adopt a set of international labour standards through the [[International Labour Organization|International Labour Organisation]] (ILO), international sanctions for failing to meet such standards are very limited. In many countries labour movements have developed independently and represent those national boundaries.

== Development of an international labour movement ==
With ever-increasing levels of international trade and increasing influence of multinational corporations, there has been debate and action among labourists to attempt international co-operation. This has resulted in renewed efforts to organize and collectively bargain internationally. A number of international union organisations have been established in an attempt to facilitate international collective bargaining, to share information and resources and to advance the interests of workers generally.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5071">[[File:3 Geuzenpenning, halve maan.jpg|thumb|A Dutch crescent-shaped [[Geuzen medal]] at the time of the anti-Spanish [[Dutch Revolt]], with the slogan ''"Liver Turcx dan Paus"'' ("Rather Turkish than [[Pope]]..."), and ''"En Despit de la Mes"'' ([[French language|French]] "En Despit de la Messe", i.e. "In Spite of [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]]"), 1570.]]
'''Liever Turks dan Paaps''' ("Rather Turkish than  [[Papist]]"), also '''Liever Turksch dan Paus''' ("Rather Turkish than Pope"), was a [[Low Countries|Dutch]] slogan during the [[Dutch Revolt]] of the end of the 16th century. The slogan was used by the Dutch mercenary naval forces (the "[[Sea Beggars]]") in their fight against Catholic Spain.

During the Dutch Revolt, the Dutch were under such a desperate situation that they looked for help from many places no matter their religion, and "indeed even a Turk", as wrote the secretary of [[Jan van Nassau]].&lt;ref name="Schmidt103"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=U-OshMIPD48C&amp;pg=PA103 Schmidt, p.103]&lt;/ref&gt; [[William the Silent|William of Orange]] had already sent ambassadors to the [[Ottoman Empire]] for help in 1566, and it is speculated that it was in response to William's request that [[Selim II]] sent his fleet to attack the Spanish at [[Tunis]] in 1574.&lt;ref name="Schmidt103"/&gt; The Dutch viewed Ottoman successes against the Habsburgs with great interest, and saw Ottoman campaigns in the Mediterranean as an indicator of relief on the Dutch front. William wrote around 1565:
{{quote|The Turks are very threatening, which will mean, we believe, that the king will not come to the Netherlands this year.|Letter of William of Orange to his brother, circa 1565.&lt;ref name="Schmidt103"/&gt;}}

The British author [[William Rainolds]] (1544–1594) wrote a pamphlet entitled "Calvino-Turcismus" in criticism of these tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13018a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "Liever Turks dan Paaps" was coined as a way to express that life under the [[Muslim]] Ottoman Sultan would have been more desirable than life under the Catholic King of Spain.&lt;ref name="Schmidt104"&gt;Schmidt, p.104&lt;/ref&gt; The Flemish noble D'Esquerdes wrote to this effect that he:

{{quote|would rather become a tributary to the Turks than live against his conscience and be treated according to those [anti-heresy] edicts.|Letter of Flemish noble D'Esquerdes.&lt;ref name="Schmidt104"/&gt;}}

While the Turks had a reputation for cruelty, they were also known for their [[religious tolerance]] within their dominions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rijksmuseumspotlight.com/aria/aria_assets/NG-VG-1-407-A?lang=en Sea Beggar medal]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam]]&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the King of Spain did not tolerate the Protestant faith.&lt;ref name="Schmidt104"/&gt; At one point, a letter was sent from [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] to the "Lutherans" in [[Flanders]], claiming that he felt close to them, "since they did not worship idols, believed in one God and fought against the Pope and Emperor".&lt;ref&gt;''The Ottoman state and its place in world history'' by Kemal H. Karpat p.53 [https://books.google.com/books?id=orEfAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA53]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BjC7K1j_AT8C&amp;pg=PA208&amp;hl=en ''Muslims and the Gospel'' by Roland E. Miller p.208]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, various religious refugees, such as the [[Huguenots]], some [[Anglicans]], [[Quakers]], [[Anabaptists]] and even [[Jesuits]] and [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]] were able to find refuge at [[Constantinople]] and elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire,&lt;ref&gt;''The Ottoman Empire and early modern Europe'', by Daniel Goffman p.111 [https://books.google.com/books?id=3uJzjatjTL4C&amp;pg=PA111]&lt;/ref&gt; where they were given rights of residence and worship.&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, p.110&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the Ottomans supported the [[Calvinist]]s, not only in their territories of [[Transylvania]] and [[Hungary]], but also in France.&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, p.111&lt;/ref&gt;

The slogan ''Liever Turks dan Paaps'' did not mean the Dutch seriously contemplated coming under Ottoman suzerainty, as they were far away from that empire's sphere of influence; rather, it was an expression of their antipathy to the Catholic regime they had been subjected to.&lt;ref name="Schmidt104"/&gt;

'''''Livestock's Long Shadow: Environmental Issues and Options''''' is a [[United Nations]] report, released by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations ([[FAO]]) on 29 November 2006,&lt;ref name="FAO-Report"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.htm|title=Livestock's long shadow|date=16 August 2018|website=Fao.org|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that "aims to assess the full impact of the [[livestock]] sector on environmental problems, along with potential technical and policy approaches to mitigation".&lt;ref name="FAO-Report"/&gt;

==About==
The assessment was based on the most recent and complete data available, taking into account direct impacts, along with the impacts of feed crop agriculture required for livestock production.  The report states that the livestock sector is one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global. The findings of this report suggest that it should be a major policy focus when dealing with problems of [[land degradation]], [[climate change]] and [[air pollution]], [[water shortage]] and [[water pollution]], and [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]].

Based on this report, senior U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization official Dr. Henning Steinfeld stated that the [[meat industry]] is “one of the most significant contributors to today’s most serious environmental problems" and that "urgent action is required to remedy the situation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000448/index.html|title=Livestock a major threat to environment|website=Fao.org|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a Life Cycle Analysis approach, the report evaluates "that livestock are responsible for 18 percent of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/010/a0701e/a0701e03.pdf|title=Livestock impacts on the environment|last=|first=|date=|year=2006|website=|publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]]|accessdate=October 25, 2016|author=FAO Agriculture and Consumer Protection Department|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150828131058/http://www.fao.org/ag/magazine/0612sp1.htm|archivedate=August 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
GHG emissions arise from feed production (e.g. chemical fertilizer production, deforestation for pasture and feed crops, cultivation of feed crops, feed transport and soil organic matter losses in pastures and feed crops), animal production (e.g. enteric fermentation and methane and nitrous oxide emissions from manure) and as a result of the transportation of animal products. Following this approach the report estimates that livestock contributes to about 9% of total anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions, but 37% of methane and 65% of nitrous oxide emissions. Along the animal food chain, main sources of emissions are:

* Land use and land use change: 2.5 Giga tonnes [[carbon dioxide equivalent]]; including forest and other natural vegetation replaced by pasture and feed crop in the Neotropics (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and carbon release from soils such as pasture and arable land dedicated to feed production (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)
* Feed Production (except carbon released from soil): 0.4 Giga tonnes CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent, including fossil fuel used in manufacturing chemical fertilizer for feed crops (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and chemical fertilizer application on feedcrops and leguminous feed crop (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)
* Animal production: 1.9 Giga tonnes CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent, including enteric fermentation from ruminants (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and on-farm fossil fuel use (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)
* Manure Management: 2.2 Giga tonnes CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent, mainly through manure storage, application and deposition (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)
* Processing and international transport: 0.03 Giga tonnes CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent

In March 2010, a newspaper reported that an unnamed American scientist had convinced one of the authors of the report that the report's comparison of the relative magnitude of emissions from transportation versus the meat production industry was flawed, because it was based on different calculations of each sector's emissions: "The meat figure had been reached by adding all greenhouse-gas emissions associated with meat production, including fertiliser production, land clearance, methane emissions, and vehicle use on farms, whereas the transport figure had only included the burning of fossil fuels."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/environment/|title=Environment|date=30 March 2016|accessdate=16 August 2018|website=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Questions about methodology==
Meat industry sources object to the methodology used in the UN report, notably that deforestation for livestock was included in the calculations. These sources point out that pasture-grass-feeding, such as is common in New Zealand, may lead to lower emissions attributable to livestock, despite the fact that methane and nitrous oxide from [[livestock]] make up half of New Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maf.govt.nz/climatechange/slm/vggr/page-01.htm#P610_60455|title=New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry – Voluntary Greenhouse Gas Reporting Feasibility Study – Summary|website=Maf.govt.nz|accessdate=16 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612215844/http://www.maf.govt.nz/climatechange/slm/vggr/page-01.htm#P610_60455|archive-date=2011-06-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to this assumption, however, a study in the Journal of Animal Science comparing the methane emissions from grazing and feedlot cattle concluded that grass-fed cattle produce about 4 times ''more'' methane than grain-fed cattle.

An April 2008 inventory report of emissions in the United States, by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]&lt;ref name="epa.gov"&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/usinventoryreport.html U.S. Greenhouse Gas Inventory Reports] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218171807/http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/usinventoryreport.html |date=2011-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found "In 2006, emissions sources contained within the Agricultural Chapters were responsible for emissions of … 6 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions."  The Agricultural Chapters contained topics such as [[rice]] production, [[enteric fermentation]] in domestic livestock, livestock [[manure]] management, and agricultural [[soil management]], but omitted fuel combustion, agricultural {{CO2}} fluxes, and other land use changes.  These were placed separately into the Energy chapter, Land Use, Land-Use Change chapter, and Forestry Chapter.&lt;ref name="epa.gov"/&gt;  This is also true in the US EPA's 2009 Draft U.S. Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/downloads09/07ES.pdf|title=Page being updated|website=Epa.gov|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2009 issue of the [[Worldwatch Institute]] magazine, environmental assessment specialists Robert Goodland and Jeff Anhang argued in Livestock and Climate Change that the FAO vastly underestimated the environmental impact of the livestock sector and that it accounts for at least 51% of global GHG emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/17/business/global/17iht-rbofcows.html?_r=4&amp;|title=Looking for a Solution to Cows' Climate Problem|first=Fiona|last=MacKay|website=Nytimes.com|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Anhang2009&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Goodland R|author2= Anhang J|title=Livestock and Climate Change: What if the key actors in climate change were pigs, chickens and cows?|journal=World Watch Magazine|date=Nov{{ndash}}Dec 2009|volume=22|issue=6|pages=10–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some criticisms included the FAO's use of the 100-year [[global-warming potential]] (GWP) of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; rather than the 20-year GWP favored by Goodland and Anhang. However, Goodland and Anhang continue to use the 100-year GWP for anthropogenic greenhouse gases in their analysis, with the sole exception of methane emissions from livestock. More controversially, Goodland and Anhang argue that animal respiration should be included, despite widely adopted conventions that they be treated as part of short-term carbon cycle and excluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/files/pdf/Livestock%20and%20Climate%20Change.pdf|format=PDF|title=Livestock and Climate Change|website=Worldwatch.org|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report was well received by the FAO and has been cited by several UN agencies and international institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.unep.org/pdf/unep-geas_oct_2012.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-08-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728151333/http://www.unep.org/pdf/unep-geas_oct_2012.pdf |archive-date=2014-07-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unescobkk.org/fileadmin/user_upload/shs/Energyethics/ECCAPWG13rpt_Final_.pdf|format=PDF|title=Energy Flow, Environment and Ethical Implications for Meat Production|website=Unescobkk.org|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ccchina.gov.cn/Detail.aspx?newsId=28601&amp;TId=62 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-08-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812210150/http://www.ccchina.gov.cn/Detail.aspx?newsId=28601&amp;TId=62 |archive-date=2014-08-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite that, some criticism on Livestock and Climate Change was received including from within the FAO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilri.org/ilrinews/index.php/archives/6239|title=Livestock and climate change: Towards credible figures|website=Ilri.org|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using revised methods and a later reference year (2005), the FAO subsequently estimated that livestock accounted for 14.5 percent of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/resources/en/publications/tackling_climate_change/index.htm|title=Tackling climate change through livestock // FAO's Animal Production and Health Division|website=Fao.org|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New Party''' was a [[political party]] briefly active in the [[United Kingdom]] in the early 1930s.  It was formed by [[Sir Oswald Mosley]], an [[Member of Parliament|MP]] who had belonged to both the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] parties, quitting Labour after its 1930 conference narrowly rejected his "Mosley Memorandum", a document he had written outlining how he would deal with the problem of unemployment.

==Mosley Memorandum==
On 6 December 1930, Mosley published an expanded version of the "Mosley Memorandum", which was signed by Mosley, his wife and fellow Labour MP [[Lady Cynthia Mosley|Lady Cynthia]] and 15 other Labour MPs: [[Oliver Baldwin]], [[Joseph Batey]], [[Aneurin Bevan]], [[W. J. Brown]], [[William Cove]], [[Robert Forgan]], [[J. F. Horrabin]], [[James Lovat-Fraser]], [[John McGovern (politician)|John McGovern]], [[John James McShane]], [[Frank Markham]], [[H. T. Muggeridge]], [[Morgan Philips Price]], [[Charles Simmons (politician)|Charles Simmons]], and [[John Strachey (politician)|John Strachey]]. It was also signed by [[A. J. Cook (trade unionist)|A. J. Cook]], [[general secretary]] of the [[Miners' Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;Labour Party statement on the New Party, 23 October 1931&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding the New Party==
[[File:History of British Fascism.png|thumbnail|left|A flowchart showing the history of the early British fascist movement]]
On 28 February 1931 Mosley resigned from the Labour Party, launching the New Party the following day. The party was formed from six of the Labour MPs who signed the Mosley Manifesto (Mosley and his wife, Baldwin, Brown, Forgan and Strachey), although two (Baldwin and Brown) resigned membership after a day and sat in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] as independent MPs; Strachey resigned in June. The party received £50,000 funding from [[William Morris, 1st Viscount Nuffield|Lord Nuffield]] and launched a magazine called ''Action'', edited by [[Harold Nicolson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Francis|last=Selwyn|year=1987|title=Hitler's Englishman: The Crime of Lord Haw-Haw |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mosley also set up a party militia, the "Biff Boys" led by the [[England national rugby union team|All-England rugby]] captain [[Peter Howard (journalist)|Peter Howard]].&lt;ref name="jones"&gt;{{cite book |first=Nigel |last=Jones |year=2005 |title=Mosley |publisher=Haus Publishers Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Party's first electoral contest was at the [[Ashton-under-Lyne by-election, 1931|Ashton-under-Lyne by-election]] in April 1931. The candidate was Allan Young, and his [[election agent]] was [[Wilfred Risdon]]. With a threadbare organisation they polled some 16% of the vote, splitting the Labour vote and allowing a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] to be returned to the Commons. Two more MPs joined the New party later in 1931—[[William Edward David Allen|W.E.D. Allen]] from the [[Conservative Party (UK)#Conservatives and Unionists|Unionists]] and [[Cecil Dudgeon]] from the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]]. At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1931|1931 general election]] the New Party contested 25 seats, but only Mosley himself, and a candidate in [[Merthyr Tydfil (UK Parliament constituency)|Merthyr Tydfil]] (where they stood against only the Labour Party) polled a decent number of votes, and three candidates [[lost their deposit]]s.

==Policies==
The New Party programme was built on the "Mosley Memorandum", advocating a national policy to meet the economic crisis that the [[Great Depression]] had brought.  Mosley's desire for complete control of policy making decisions in the New Party led many members to resign membership.  He favoured granting wide-ranging powers to the government, with only general control by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] and creating a five-member [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] without specific portfolio, similar to the [[War Cabinet]] adopted during the [[World War I|First World War]].  His economic strategy broadly followed [[Keynesian]] thinking and suggested widespread investment into housing to provide work and improve housing standards overall, while also supporting [[protectionism]] with proposals for high tariffs walls.&lt;ref name="jones"/&gt;

==Demise==
Following the election Mosley toured [[Europe]] and became convinced of the virtues of [[Fascism]].  Gradually, the New Party became more authoritarian, with parts of it (notably its youth movement NUPA) adopting overtly fascist thinking.  The New Party's sharp turn to the right led previous supporters such as [[John Strachey (politician)|John Strachey]] and [[Harold Nicolson]] to leave it.  In 1932 Mosley united most of the various fascist organisations in the UK, forming the [[British Union of Fascists]], into which the New Party subsumed itself.

An unrelated [[The New Party (UK, 2003)|New Party]] was launched in Britain in 2003.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1762">The '''Observatorio Venezolano de Prisiones''' '''(OVP,''' in English '''Venezuelan Observatory of Prisons)''' is a Venezuelan [[NGO]] working to improve [[human rights]] for prisoners. Its offices are located in [[Caracas]].
Several media have quoted the Venezuelan Observatory of Prisons: [[New York Times]] and [[Associated Press]].

== History ==
The OVP was founded in 2002. Among its members there are political scientists, criminologists, sociologists, architects and experts in the prison system.

The organisation was very vocal when in 2014 when 34 inmates at the Uribana prison died during protests.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/12/01/venezuela-deaths-prison-protest HRW reports on Uribana]&lt;/ref&gt; This was in the wake of the [[2013 Uribana prison riot]] in which over 60 prisoners died.

The IACHR expressed concerns after government official [[Diosdado Cabello]] informed on his TV program Hitting with the Hammer when several representatives of the OVP were arriving in Venezuela after an international tour. The IACH considered Cabello was threatening them by notifying what were private details of a trip.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oas.org/en/iachr/media_center/PReleases/2015/032.asp IACH expresses concerns for the safety of OVP representatives]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe''' ('''OSCE''') is the world's largest security-oriented [[intergovernmental organization]]. Its mandate includes issues such as [[arms control]], promotion of [[human rights]], [[freedom of the press]], and fair elections. It employs around 3,460 people, mostly in its field operations but also in its secretariat in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] and its institutions. It has its origins in the 1975 Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) held in [[Helsinki]], Finland.

The OSCE is concerned with early warning, conflict prevention, [[crisis management]], and post-conflict rehabilitation. Its 57 participating states are located in [[Europe]], northern and central [[Asia]], and [[Northern America|North America]]. The participating states cover much of the land area of the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. It was created during the [[Cold War]] era as an East–West forum.&lt;ref name=galbreath&gt;{{cite book|last=Galbreath|first=David J.|title=The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780203960943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-P0805-314, Helsinki, KSZE-Konferenz, Schlussakte.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Helmut Schmidt]], [[Erich Honecker]], [[Gerald Ford]] and [[Bruno Kreisky]] at the 1975 CSCE summit in [[Helsinki]], Finland.]]

The Organization has its roots in the 1973 '''Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe''' (CSCE). Talks had been mooted about a European security grouping since the 1950s but the [[Cold War]] prevented any substantial progress until the talks at [[Dipoli]] in [[Espoo]] began in November 1972. These talks were held at the suggestion of the [[Soviet Union]] which wished to use the talks to maintain its control over the [[Communism|communist]] countries in [[Eastern Europe]], and [[President of Finland]] [[Urho Kekkonen]] hosted them in order to bolster his [[Paasikivi-Kekkonen line|policy of neutrality]]. [[Western Europe]], however, saw these talks as a way to reduce the tension in the region, furthering economic cooperation and obtaining humanitarian improvements for the populations of the [[Eastern Bloc|Communist bloc]].

The recommendations of the talks, in the form of "The Blue Book", gave the practical foundations for a three-stage conference called the "Helsinki process".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Recommendations of the Helsinki Consultations|url=http://www.osce.org/mc/40213|publisher=Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|accessdate=9 May 2015|date=3 July 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CSCE opened in Helsinki on 3 July 1973 with 35 states sending representatives. Stage&amp;nbsp;I only took five days to agree to follow the Blue Book. Stage&amp;nbsp;II was the main working phase and was conducted in [[Geneva]] from 18 September 1973 until 21 July 1975. The result of Stage&amp;nbsp;II was the [[Helsinki Accords|Helsinki Final Act]] which was signed by the 35 participating states during Stage&amp;nbsp;III, which took place in [[Finlandia Hall]] from 30 July – 1 August 1975. It was opened by [[Holy See]]’s diplomat Cardinal [[Agostino Casaroli]], who was chairman of the conference.

The concepts of improving relations and implementing the act were developed over a series of follow-up meetings, with major gatherings in [[Belgrade]] (4 October 1977{{spaced ndash}}8 March 1978), [[Madrid]] (11 November 1980{{spaced ndash}}9 September 1983) and [[Vienna]] (4 November 1986{{spaced ndash}}19 January 1989).

The collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] required a change of role for the CSCE. The [[Paris Charter|Charter of Paris for a New Europe]], signed on 21 November 1990, marked the beginning of this change. &lt;!--Huh?:--&gt;With the changes capped by the renaming of the CSCE to the OSCE on 1 January 1995, in accord with the results of the conference held in [[Budapest]], Hungary, in 1994. The OSCE now had a formal secretariat, Senior Council, Parliamentary Assembly, Conflict Prevention Centre, and Office for Free Elections (later becoming the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights).

In December 1996, the "[[Lisbon]] Declaration on a Common and Comprehensive Security Model for Europe for the Twenty-First Century" affirmed the universal and indivisible nature of security on the European continent.

In [[Istanbul]] on 19 November 1999, the OSCE ended a two-day summit by calling for a political settlement in [[Chechnya]] and adopting a [[Charter for European Security]]. According to then Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Igor Ivanov]], this summit marked a turning point in Russian perception of the OSCE, from an organization that expressed Europe's collective will, to an organization that serves as a [[Western world|Western]] tool for "forced democratization".&lt;ref&gt;Ivanov, Igor S., ''The New Russian Diplomacy'', [[Nixon Center]] and [[Brookings Institution]] Press: [[Washington, D.C.]], 2002. pp. 97-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through its Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), the OSCE observes and assesses elections in its member states, in order to support fair and transparent democratic processes, in keeping with the mutual standards to which the organization is committed;&lt;ref name="cns2004"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewPolitics.asp?Page=%5CPolitics%5Carchive%5C200408%5CPOL20040809c.html |title=International Monitoring of US Election Called 'Frightening'|last=Hammond|first=Roch|date=9 August 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203051236/http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewPolitics.asp?Page=%5CPolitics%5Carchive%5C200408%5CPOL20040809c.html|archive-date=3 February 2008|website=CNSNews.com|publisher=Cybercast News Service|access-date=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; between 1994 and 2004 the OSCE sent teams of observers to monitor more than 150 elections, typically focusing on elections in emerging democracies.&lt;ref name="USAToday2004"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-08-10-osce-observers_x.htm |title=U.S. invites international observers to Nov. election|publisher=''USA Today''. usatoday.com|date= 10 August 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515111154/http://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-08-10-osce-observers_x.htm|archive-date=15 May 2008|access-date=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, at the invitation of the [[United States]] Government, the ODIHR deployed an assessment mission, made up of participants from six OSCE member states, which observed that year's US presidential election and produced a report.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/usa/eom/general_2004 Presidential Election, 2 November 2004, United States of America]". OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights. Retrieved 2016-12-30.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that a US presidential election was the subject of OSCE monitoring, although the organization had previously monitored state-level American elections in Florida and California, in 2002 and 2003.&lt;ref name="USAToday2004"/&gt; The 2004 assessment took place against the backdrop of the controversial recount effort in the 2000 US presidential election,&lt;ref name="USAToday2004"/&gt; and came about largely through the initiative of 13 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] members of the  [[United States House of Representatives]]. That group, which included [[Barbara Lee]], of California, and [[Eddie Bernice Johnson]], of Texas, initially addressed a request for election observers to the [[United Nations]], in a letter to [[Kofi Annan]], the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary-General]], but the request was declined.&lt;ref name="cns2004"/&gt; Subsequently, the administration of [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]], through the [[United States Department of State|State Department]], headed by [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Colin Powell]], responded to the lawmakers' concerns by inviting the OSCE election-monitoring mission.&lt;ref name="cns2004"/&gt;

== Legal status ==
A unique aspect of the OSCE is the non-binding status of its constitutive charter. Rather than being a formal [[treaty]] ratified by national [[legislature]]s, the Helsinki Final Act represents a political commitment by the [[head of government|heads of government]] of all signatories to build security and cooperation in Europe on the basis of its provisions. This allows the OSCE to remain a flexible ''process'' for the evolution of improved cooperation, which avoids disputes and/or sanctions over implementation. By agreeing to these commitments, signatories for the first time accepted that treatment of citizens ''within'' their borders was also a matter of legitimate international concern.  This open process of the OSCE is often given credit for helping build democracy in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, thus leading to the end of the Cold War{{fact|date=October 2016}}. Unlike most international intergovernmental organizations, however, the OSCE does not have international legal personality on account of the lack of legal effect of its charter.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.osce.org/secretariat/36184 Making a credible case for a legal personality for the OSCE]", OSCE Secretariat&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, its headquarters’ host, [[Austria]], had to confer legal personality on the organization in order to be able to sign a legal agreement regarding its presence in [[Vienna]].

== Structure and institutions ==
Political direction to the organization is given by heads of state or government during summits. Summits are not regular or scheduled but held as needed. The last summit took place in Astana (Kazakhstan), on 1 and 2 December 2010. The high-level decision-making body of the organization is the Ministerial Council, which meets at the end of every year. At ambassadorial level the Permanent Council convenes weekly in Vienna and serves as the regular negotiating and decision-making body. The chairperson of the Permanent Council is the ambassador to the Organization of the participating State which holds the chairmanship. From 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017 the Chairperson-in-Office is Austrian Foreign Minister, Sebastian Kurz, who succeeded German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier.

In addition to the Ministerial Council and Permanent Council, the Forum for Security Co-operation is also an OSCE decision-making body. It deals predominantly with matters of military co-operation, such as modalities for inspections according to the Vienna Document of 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/documents/fsc/1999/11/4265_en.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050430191753/http://www.osce.org/documents/fsc/1999/11/4265_en.pdf|title=Vienna Document 1999 of the Negotiations on Confidence- and Security-building Measures|publisher=Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|date=16 November 1999|archive-date=30 April 2005|accessdate=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OSCE's Secretariat is located in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. The current Secretary General is [[Lamberto Zannier]] of Italy, who took over from [[Marc Perrin de Brichambaut]] of France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/sg/78779|accessdate=2011-07-06|title=Secretary General|date=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization also has offices in [[Copenhagen]], [[Geneva]], [[The Hague]], [[Prague]] and [[Warsaw, Poland|Warsaw]].

[[File:OSCE-Permanent Council.JPG|thumb|A meeting of the OSCE Permanent Council at the [[Hofburg]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]].]]
{{As of|2016|03}}, the OSCE employed 3,462 staff, including 513 in its secretariat and institutions and 2,949 in its 17 field operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/whatistheosce/factsheet?download=true|title=What is the OSCE?|publisher=Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|page=7|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] is made up of 323 parliamentarians from 57 member states. The Parliamentary Assembly performs its functions mainly via the Standing Committee, the Bureau, and 3 General Committees (Committee on Political Affairs and Security, Committee on Economic Affairs, Science, Technology and Environment, and Committee on Democracy, Human Rights and Humanitarian Questions).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/pa/260596?download=true|title=The OSCE Parliamentary Assembly|last=|first=|date=|website=www.osce.org|access-date=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Parliamentary Assembly passes resolutions on matters such as political and security affairs, economic and environmental issues, and democracy and human rights. Representing the collective voice of OSCE parliamentarians, these resolutions and recommendations are meant to ensure that all participating states live up to their OSCE commitments. The Parliamentary Assembly also engages in parliamentary diplomacy, and has an extensive election observation program.

The oldest OSCE institution is the [[Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights]] (ODIHR), established in 1991 following a decision made at the 1990 [[Paris Charter|Summit of Paris]]. It is based in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]], and is active throughout the OSCE area in the fields of [[election observer|election observation]], democratic development, human rights, tolerance and non-discrimination, rule of law, and [[Romani people|Roma]] and [[Sinti]] issues. The ODIHR has observed over 300 elections and referendums since 1995, sending more than 50,000 observers. It has operated outside its own area twice, sending a team that offered technical support to the 9 October 2004 presidential elections in [[Afghanistan]], an OSCE Partner for Co-operation, and an election support team to assist with parliamentary and provincial council elections on 18 September 2005. ODIHR is headed by Michael Georg Link.

The Office of the [[OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media]], established in December 1997, acts as a watchdog to provide early warning on violations of [[freedom of expression]] in OSCE participating States. The representative also assists participating States by advocating and promoting full compliance with OSCE norms, principles and commitments regarding freedom of expression and free media. As of 2011, the current representative is expert in media law from Bosnia and Herzegovina [[Dunja Mijatovic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/fom/43206|title=Representative on Freedom of the Media|website=Osce.org|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[High Commissioner on National Minorities]] was created on 8 July 1992 by the Helsinki Summit Meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. It is charged with identifying and seeking early resolution of ethnic tension that might endanger peace, stability or friendly relations between participating states.

Each year the OSCE holds an OSCE Asian Conference with partner nations like Australia, Thailand, South Korea, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="osceasianconf"&gt;{{cite web|title=2017 OSCE Asian Conference|url=http://www.osce.org/event/2017-osce-asian-conference|publisher=OSCE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OSCE considers itself a regional organization in the sense of [[Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osce.org/ec/43240 |title=Secretariat - External Cooperation |publisher=OSCE}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is an [[United Nations General Assembly observers|observer]] in the [[United Nations General Assembly]].&lt;ref name="UN_ARES485"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-48-5 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=48 |resolution_number=5 |accessdate=2008-10-01 |date=22 October 1993 |title=Observer status for the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe in the General Assembly}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Chairman-in-Office gives routine briefings to the [[United Nations Security Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{UN document |docid=S-PV-5982 |body=Security Council |type=Verbatim Report |meeting=5982 |page=2 |anchor=pg002-bk06 |date=26 September 2008 |speakername=Mr. Stubb | speakernation=Finland |accessdate=2008-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The three dimensions==
=== Politico-military dimension (first dimension) ===
The OSCE takes a comprehensive approach to the [[politico-military]] dimension of security, which includes a number of commitments by participating States and mechanisms for conflict prevention and resolution. The organization also seeks to enhance military security by promoting greater openness, transparency and co-operation.

; [[Arms control]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/what/arms-control|title=Arms control|website=Osce.org|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The end of the Cold War resulted in a huge amount of surplus weapons becoming available in what is known as the international [[grey market]] for weapons. The OSCE helps to stop the - often illegal - spread of such weapons and offers assistance with their destruction.  The OSCE hosts the annual exchange of information under the [[Conventional Forces in Europe]] treaty.  The OSCE has also implemented two additional exchanges of information, the [[Vienna Document]] and the [[Global Exchange of Military Information]].  The [[Open Skies Consultative Commission]], the implementing body for the [[Treaty on Open Skies]], meets monthly at its Vienna headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/oscc|title=Open Skies Consultative Commission|website=Osce.org|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Border management&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/what/borders|title=Border management|website=Osce.org|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The actions taken by the OSCE in border monitoring range from conflict prevention to post-conflict management, capacity building and institutional support.

; Combating terrorism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/what/terrorism|title=Combating terrorism|website=Osce.org|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With its expertise in conflict prevention, crisis management and early warning, the OSCE contributes to worldwide efforts in [[counter-terrorism|combating terrorism]].

; Conflict prevention&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/what/conflict-prevention|title=Conflict prevention and resolution|website=Osce.org|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/cpc|title=Conflict prevention and resolution|website=Osce.org|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The OSCE works to prevent conflicts from arising and to facilitate lasting comprehensive political settlements for existing conflicts. It also helps with the process of rehabilitation in post-conflict areas.

; Military reform
The OSCE's Forum for Security Co-operation provides a framework for political dialogue on military reform, while practical activities are conducted by field operations, as well as the Conflict Prevention Centre.

; Policing
OSCE police operations are an integral part of the organization's efforts in conflict prevention and post-conflict rehabilitation.

; Implementation
The OSCE was a rather small organization until selection by the international community to provide electoral organization to post war Bosnia and Herzegovina in early 1996. Ambassador Frowick was the first OSCE representative to initiate national election in September 1996, human rights issues and rule of law specifically designed to provide a foundation for judicial organization within Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The OSCE had regional offices and field offices, to include the office in Brcko in northeastern Bosnia and Herzegovina which remained in limbo until the Brcko Arbitration Agreement could be decided, finalized and implemented.

Brcko become a "special district" and remains so today.

The OSCE essentially took the place of the United Nations in Bosnia and Herzegovina in part because the Bosnian leadership felt deep contempt for the UN efforts to stop the war which began in 1991 and ended in 1995. During the time the United Nations were attempting a political solution, thousands of UN troops were posted in and around Bosnia and Herzegovina with special emphasis on Sarajevo. Between the inclusive dates of 1991 through 1995, over 200,000 Bosnians were killed and over one million displaced and another million as refugees. [[citation needed]]

The OSCE continues to have a presence and a number of initiatives to bring a sustained peace to the region.

=== Economic and environmental dimension (second dimension) ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}

Activities in the economic and environmental dimension include the monitoring of developments related to economic and environmental security in OSCE participating States, with the aim of alerting them to any threat of conflict; assisting States in the creation of economic and environmental policies, legislation and institutions to promote security in the OSCE region.

; Economic activities
Among the economic activities of the OSCE feature activities related to migration management, transport and energy security. Most activities are implemented in co-operation with partner organizations.

; Environmental activities
The OSCE has developed a range of activities in the environmental sphere aimed at addressing ecologic threats to security in its participating States. Among the activities feature projects in the area of hazardous waste, water management and access to information under the [[Aarhus Convention]].

=== Human dimension (third dimension) ===
The commitments made by OSCE participating States in the [[three generations of human rights|human dimension]] aim to ensure full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms; to abide by the [[rule of law]]; to promote the principles of democracy by building, strengthening and protecting democratic institutions; and to promote [[toleration|tolerance]] throughout the OSCE region.

;Combating trafficking in human beings
Since 2003 the OSCE&lt;ref name="osce.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osce.org/cthb|title=Combating trafficking in human beings|website=Osce.org|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; has had an established mechanism for combating trafficking in human beings, as defined by Article 3 of the [[Convention against Transnational Organized Crime|Palermo Protocol]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://untreaty.un.org/English/TreatyEvent2003/Texts/treaty2E.pdf|title=Palermo Protocol|website=Untreaty.un.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928150400/http://untreaty.un.org/English/TreatyEvent2003/Texts/treaty2E.pdf|archivedate=28 September 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is aimed at raising public awareness of the problem and building the political will within participating states to tackle it effectively.

The OSCE actions against [[human trafficking|trafficking in human beings]] are coordinated by the Office of the Special Representative and Co-ordinator for Combating Trafficking in Human Beings.&lt;ref name="osce.org"/&gt; [[Maria Grazia Giammarinaro]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/cthb/43180|title=Maria Grazia Giammarinaro|website=Osce.org|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a judge in the Criminal Court of Rome, took Office as the Special Representative in March 2010. From 2006 to 2009 this Office was held by [[Eva Biaudet]], a former Finnish Minister of Health and Social Services. Biaudet currently serves as Finnish Ombudsman for Minorities. Her predecessor was former Austrian Minister Helga Conrad, who served as the first OSCE Special Representative for Combating Trafficking in Human Beings.

The activities around Combating Trafficking in Human Beings in the OSCE Region of the Office of the Special Representative include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/publications/cthb/2007/10/27431_971_en.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015181750/http://www.osce.org/publications/cthb/2007/10/27431_971_en.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=15 October 2009|title=Combating Trafficking in Human Beings in the OSCE Region|website=Osce.org|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Co-operation with governments, helping them to accept and act on their responsibilities for curbing trafficking in human beings;
* Providing governments with decision and policy-making aids and offering guidance on anti-trafficking management, with the aim of arriving at solutions tailored to the needs of the individual countries and in line with international standards;
* Assisting governments to develop the national anti-trafficking structures required for efficient internal and transnational co-operation;
* Raising awareness to draw attention to the complexity of the problem and to the need for comprehensive solutions;
* Considering all dimensions of [[human trafficking]], namely trafficking for [[sexual exploitation]], trafficking for [[forced labour|forced and bonded labour]], including domestic servitude, trafficking into [[forced marriage]]s, trafficking in organs and trafficking in children;
* Ensuring the effective interaction of all agents and stake holders involved in the fight against human trafficking, ranging from governmental authorities, law enforcement officials to NGOs, and—last but not least—[[international organization]]s, as the agencies providing support thorough expertise and know-how;
* Guaranteeing the highest possible visibility of the OSCE's fight against human trafficking to focus attention on the issue.

;Democratization
The OSCE claims to promote democracy and assist the participating states in building [[democratization|democratic institutions]].

;Education
Education programmes are an integral part of the organization's efforts in conflict prevention and post-conflict rehabilitation.

;Elections
As part of its democratization activities, the OSCE carries out election assistance projects in the run-up to, during, and following elections. However, the effectiveness of such assistance is arguable—Kazakhstan, for example, despite being the former chair of the OSCE, is considered by many to be one of the least democratic countries in the world. Moreover, the recent democratic advances made in other Central Asian republics, notably Kyrgyzstan, have led to rumours of Soviet-style disruption of the Kyrgyz democratic process by, in particular, Kazakhstan and Russia. This may be in large part due to fears over the long-term stability of these countries' own quasi-dictatorships.

;Gender equality
The equality of men and women is an integral part of sustainable democracy. The OSCE aims to provide equal opportunities for men and women and to integrate [[gender equality]] in policies and practices.

;Human rights
The OSCE's [[human rights]] activities focus on such priorities as [[freedom of movement]] and religion, preventing torture and trafficking in persons.

;National and international NGOs
OSCE could grant [[Consultative Status|consultive status]] to [[NGOs]] and [[International nongovernmental organizations|INGOs]] in the form of "Researcher-in-residence programme" (run by the Prague Office of the OSCE Secretariat): accredited representatives of national and international NGOs are granted access to all records and to numerous topical compilations related to OSCE field activities.

;Media freedom
The OSCE observes relevant media developments in its participating states with a view to addressing and providing early warning on violations of [[freedom of expression]].

;Minority rights
Ethnic conflict is one of the main sources of large-scale violence in Europe today. The OSCE's approach is to identify and to seek early resolution of ethnic tensions, and to set standards for the rights of persons belonging to [[minority group]]s and [[High Commissioner on National Minorities]] has been established.

== OSCE Democracy Defender Award ==

The Democracy Defender Award honors a person or group for contributions to the promotion of democracy and the defense of human rights "in the spirit of Helsinki Final Act and other OSCE principles and commitments." The award was established in 2016 on the initiative of Ambassadors of 8 countries, and supported by the delegations of the 18 countries of the OSCE (22 countries in 2017).&lt;ref name="demdefend"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swedenabroad.com/en-GB/Embassies/OSCE/Current-affairs/News/Democracy-Defender-Award-presented-at-Schwedenhaus-sys/|title=Democracy Defender Award presented at Schwedenhaus|publisher=OSCE mission in Sweden}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="epde"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epde.org/en/newsreader/items/russian-epde-member-golos-awarded-2017-democracy-defender-award-in-vienna.html|title=Russian EPDE member "Golos" awarded 2017 Democracy Defender Award in Vienna|publisher=European Platform for Democratic Elections}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Following an unprecedented period of activity in the 1990s and early 2000s (decade), the OSCE has in the past few years faced accusations from the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] states (primarily{{Citation needed|reason=Why primarily?|date=December 2016}} [[Russia]]) of being a tool for the Western states to advance their own interests. For instance, the events in [[Ukraine]] in 2004 (the "[[Orange Revolution]]") led to allegations by Russia of OSCE involvement on behalf of the pro-Western [[Viktor Yushchenko]]. At the 2007 [[Munich Conference on Security Policy]], [[Vladimir Putin]] made this position very clear:
::"They [unnamed Western States] are trying to transform the OSCE into a vulgar instrument designed to promote the foreign policy interests of one or a group of countries. And this task is also being accomplished by the OSCE's bureaucratic apparatus, which is absolutely not connected with the state founders in any way. Decision-making procedures and the involvement of so-called non-governmental organizations are tailored for this task. These organizations are formally independent but they are purposefully financed and therefore under control".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kommersant.com/p741749/r_527/Munich_Speech_Vladimir_Putin/ "The Munich Speech"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221222921/http://www.kommersant.com/p741749/r_527/Munich_Speech_Vladimir_Putin/ |date=21 February 2007 }}, ''Kommersant Moscow''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/a/1058603.html|title=OSCE: Election Experts Debate Russian Criticism|publisher=Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brama.com/news/press/2004/07/040729csce.html|title=Criticism of OSCE by Nine CIS Countries Draws the Response|website=Brama.com|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aspr.ac.at/osce_report06.pdf|title=Austrian Study Centre for Peace and Conflict Resolution (ASPR) - Peace Castle Austria|website=Aspr.ac.at|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia and its allies are advancing the concept of a comprehensive OSCE reform, which would make the Secretariat, institutions and field presences more centralized and accountable to collective consensus-based bodies and focus the work of the Organization on topical security issues (human trafficking, terrorism, non-proliferation, arms control, etc.), at the expense of the "Human Dimension", or human rights issues. The move to reduce the autonomy of the theoretically independent OSCE institutions, such as ODIHR, would effectively grant a Russian veto over any OSCE activity. Western participating States are opposing this process, which they see as an attempt to prevent the OSCE from carrying out its democratization agenda in post-Soviet countries.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Following the [[2008 U.S. presidential election]], OSCE's ODIHR was accused of having double standards by Russia's lawmaker Slutsky. The point was made that while numerous violations of the voting process were registered, its criticism came only from within the United States (media, human rights organizations, McCain's election staff), while the OSCE known for its bashing criticism of elections on the post-Soviet space remained silent.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.kommersant.com/page.asp?id=-13534 OSCE, ODIHR Showed Double Standard at U.S. Election, Russia’s Lawmaker Said] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511125521/http://www.kommersant.com/page.asp?id=-13534 |date=11 May 2011 }}", [[Kommersant]], 6 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.osce.org/documents/odihr/2005/03/13658_en.pdf OSCE/ODIHR Election Observation Mission Final Report]" of the U.S. 2008 presidential election&lt;/ref&gt;

=== OSCE Parliamentary Assembly ===

In 2004 the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly sent [[election observer]]s to the U.S. Presidential elections. The OSCE Parliamentary Assembly’s president at the time was Democratic Congressman [[Alcee Hastings]]. Hastings had previously been impeached for corruption by the U.S. Congress. The OSCE faced criticism of partisanship and double standards due to Hastings's past and the fact that the OSCE's mandate was to promote democracy and the values of civil society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=US vote 'mostly free and fair'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/americas/2004/vote_usa_2004/3987655.stm|accessdate=23 December 2013|newspaper=BBC|date=5 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] was criticized from within by the Latvian delegation for lacking transparency and democracy. [[R. Spencer Oliver|Spencer Oliver]] (b. 1938) secretary general of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, who has held the post since the organization's inception in 1992, faced a challenge from the Latvian [[Artis Pabriks]]. According to the rules of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly the incumbent general secretary can only be replaced with a full consensus minus one. Pabriks called the rules "quite shocking from the perspective of an organization that's monitoring elections".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0710/An_election_in_Copenhagen.html An election in Copenhagen] politico.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[Ilkka Kanerva]] was elected the president of the OSCE PA. Kanerva had previously been fired from his post as foreign minister of Finland after lying about sending over 200 text messages to an erotic dancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1583679/Finnish-minister-quits-over-saucy-texts.html|title=Finnish minister quits over saucy texts|author=Graeme Baker|date=2 April 2008|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2012 Texas controversy ===
Before the U.S. presidential elections of November 2012, the OSCE announced its intention to send electoral observers to Texas and to other [[U.S. state]]s. This prompted the Attorney General of Texas [[Greg Abbott]] to send letters to U.S. [[Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] and to the OSCE,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oag.state.tx.us/newspubs/releases/2012/102312abbot_letter.pdf ATTORNEY GENERAL OF TEXAS] oag.state.tx.us&lt;/ref&gt; threatening to arrest OSCE officials if they should enter electoral premises in Texas and break [[Texas law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oag.state.tx.us/oagnews/release.php?id=4199|title=Texas Attorney General|website=Oag.state.tx.us|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reply, the U.S. Department of State stated that OSCE observers enjoyed immunities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2012/10/199824.htm#DEPARTMENT Daily Press Briefing: 26 October 2012] US State Department&lt;/ref&gt; In the event, no incidents between OSCE and Texas authorities were recorded during the elections.

=== War in Donbass ===
[[File:OSCE SMM monitoring the movement of heavy weaponry in eastern Ukraine (16524364807).jpg|thumb|OSCE SMM monitoring the movement of heavy weaponry in eastern Ukraine]]
The organization has been criticized by the Ukrainian press and government for actions during the Russian–Ukraine conflict. During the [[War in Donbass]], an OSCE observer allowed Russian separatists to use the organization's marked vehicle, which prompted the belief that the OSCE was biased in the war and not interested in carrying out its duties of mediating a ceasefire. The organization issued a statement regretting the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ru.tsn.ua/politika/nablyudateli-obse-vozili-v-svoem-avtomobile-vooruzhennyh-boevikov-389982.html |publisher=TSN|title=Наблюдатели ОБСЕ возили в своем автомобиле вооруженных боевиков|language=Russian|date=3 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization has also been criticized by Ukraine for allegedly failing to monitor the implementation of the [[Minsk Protocol]]. The agreement called for a creation of a 40&amp;nbsp;km buffer zone, but upon Ukrainian forces withdrawing from their 20&amp;nbsp;km portion of the buffer, Russian separatists are said to have simply occupied the abandoned territory without withdrawing from their own 20&amp;nbsp;km buffer.  Likewise, there are allegations of separatists using OSCE marked vehicles for transportation. Moreover, the mission also received criticism alleging that only 2 checkpoints on the Russian–Ukrainian border are currently being monitored, which has been described as "seriously inadequate" by Daniel Baerm the US ambassador to the OSCE.

On the other hand, Ukraine has faced criticism following a BBC report showing an alleged violation of the Minsk agreement when Ukraine stationed tanks in the residential neighborhood Avdeevka. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://twitter.com/TomBurridgebbc/status/826812407225909249 | title=We met Ukrainian troops and tanks in #Avdiivka ... | date=1 February 2017 | author=Tom Burridge | publisher=Twitter | accessdate=6 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission has also been criticized for waiting  months to deploy drones to help monitor the border as well as withdrawing them after only several weeks of use due to Russian electronic attacks. Ukraine has argued that approximately 80% of the OSCE observers located near [[Mariupol]] were Russian citizens and many had ties to Russian security agencies such as the FSB and GRU. The organization has also been accused of allegedly revealing the locations of Ukrainian troops to Russian forces during the conflict and that Russian OSCE observers may be directly coordinating separatist artillery strikes on Ukrainian positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://osce.einnews.com/article__detail/233848306?lcode=xlBANnWjcZIh_XzBy9uIdg%3D%3D|publisher=OSCE news|title=The OSCE monitoring mission has stopped using drones to monitor the situation in the rebel-held territories}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://euroua.com/europe/osce/3258-missiya-obse-v-ukraine-pod-shkvalom-kritiki|publisher=EuroUA|title=Миссия ОБСЕ в Украине под шквалом критики}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gazeta.ua/ru/articles/politics/_litvin-rasskazal-genseku-obse-chto-kritika-v-adres-ukrainy-ne-vsegda-ob-ektivna/400033|publisher=Gazeta|title=Литвин рассказал генсеку ОБСЕ, что критика в адрес Украины не всегда объективна}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.liga.net/news/politics/4011607-rossiya_uznala_ot_obse_mesta_dislokatsii_ryada_podrazdeleniy_sil_ato.htm|publisher=Liga|title=Россия узнала от ОБСЕ места дислокации ряда подразделений сил АТО}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukrinform.ua/rus/news/minoboroni_80_sotrudnikov_obse_v_mariupole__rossiyane_sredi_nih_fsbshniki_1682979|publisher=Ukrinform|title=Минобороны: 80% сотрудников ОБСЕ в Мариуполе – россияне, среди них ФСБшники}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 December 2014, an OSCE observer was injured by Ukrainian counter artillery fire while observing militants firing at Ukrainian forces. The OSCE team was located next to two pro-Russian mortar teams. The OSCE team did not radio in or record the Russian mortar team firing on Ukrainian positions. Critics stated that the unorthodox behavior of being located next to an active separatist artillery position and not reporting the incident showed that the OSCE team was not acting in an impartial manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://burkonews.info/osce-observer-wounded-counter-fire-observing-separatist-militia-firing-mortar-ukrainian-forces/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20141213050204/https://burkonews.info/osce-observer-wounded-counter-fire-observing-separatist-militia-firing-mortar-ukrainian-forces/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-12-13|publisher=BurkoNews|title=OSCE observer is wounded from counter-fire while observing separatist militia firing a mortar at Ukrainian forces.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 October 2015 a suspended OSCE monitor confirmed he was a former employee of Russia's [[Main Intelligence Directorate]]. The suspended SMM stated he had no trouble receiving the position and neither the OSCE nor Ukraine's Security Service thoroughly checked his background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unian.info/politics/1166116-suspended-osce-monitor-confirms-hes-russian-gru-officer.html|publisher=UNIAN|title=Suspended OSCE monitor confirms he's Russian GRU officer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the report the OSCE issued a comment stating the monitor has been fired due to violations of the organization's code of conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valuewalk.com/2015/10/osce-ukraine-lies/|publisher=Value Walk|title=That Time A Russian OSCE Monitor In Ukraine Got Drunk, Said Too Much}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 April 2016 photos of OSCE  monitors attending the wedding of a Russian separatist were found. The wedding was hosted in June 2015.  The OSCE expressed regret over the incident, issuing a statement saying "The unprofessional behavior displayed by the monitors in the picture is an individual incident that should not be abused to cast a shadow on the reputation of other mission members." The OSCE reported that the monitors were no longer with the OSCE special monitoring mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/ukraine-osce-staff-at-separatist-wedding/27660759.html|publisher=Radio Free Europe|title=OSCE Expresses 'Regret' After Staff Shown At Separatist Wedding In Ukraine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017 an OSCE vehicle struck a mine, killing one member and injuring two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-osce-idUSKBN17P0CZ|title=American member of watchdog OSCE killed in Ukraine|date=24 April 2017|publisher=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two armoured vehicles were on patrol was near [[Luhansk]] when one struck the mine.&lt;ref name="NYT01"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/23/world/europe/american-killed-ukraine.html?&amp;moduleDetail=section-news-1&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=Europe&amp;region=Footer&amp;module=MoreInSection&amp;version=WhatsNext&amp;contentID=WhatsNext&amp;pgtype=article |title=Land Mine Kills American on Monitoring Mission in Ukraine |date=23 April 2017 |work=The New York Times |access-date=24 April 2017 |agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dead man was American while the injured woman was from [[Germany]] and the other person was from the [[Czech Republic]].&lt;ref name=NYT01/&gt;

On 18 July 2018 it was revealed that Russian intelligence services received inside information about the activities of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine from a staff member of the OSCE. The insider information consisted of observer's preference to alcohol, women, their financial situation, and their contacts in Ukraine.

In April 2017, Turkish President [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] criticized the OSCE for reporting that opposition "No" campaigners in the [[Turkish constitutional referendum, 2017|Turkish constitutional referendum]] had faced bans, police interventions and arrests. Erdoğan said: "Now the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe says if the result is ‘yes’, that means there are a lot of problems. Who are you? First of all, you should know your place. This is not your duty."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.euronews.com/2017/04/14/erdogan-slams-osce-ahead-of-constitutional-referendum Erdogan slams OSCE ahead of constitutional referendum]".

The '''PIDE''' or '''International and State Defense Police''' ({{lang-pt|Polícia Internacional e de Defesa do Estado}}) was a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[security agency]] that existed during the ''[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]'' regime of [[António de Oliveira Salazar]]. Formally, the main roles of the PIDE were the [[border control|border, immigration and emigration control]] and internal and external State security. However, it became more known by its [[political police]] activities.

The agency that would later become the PIDE was established by the Decree-Law 22992 of August 1933, as the '''Surveillance and State Defense Police''' or '''PVDE'''. It resulted from the merger of two former agencies, the Portuguese International Police and the Political and Social Defense Police. The PVDE was transformed into the PIDE in 1945. PIDE was itself transformed into the '''Directorate-General of Security''' or '''DGS''' in 1968. After the 25 April 1974 [[Carnation Revolution]], DGS was disbanded in Portugal, but continued to exist transitionally in the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese overseas territories]] as the '''Military Information Police''' or '''PIM''', being finally completely disbanded in 1975.

Although the acronym PIDE was only formally used from 1945 to 1969, the set of successive [[secret police]]s that existed during the 40 years of the ''Estado Novo'' regime are commonly referred to as the PIDE. Historically, this set of police agencies is also often referred as '''PIDE/DGS''', from the acronyms of its two last designations. It is referred in this last way in article 293 of the [[Portuguese Constitution]], which states the criminalization and judgment of its former officers.

During its existence, the organization was known for its actions during the [[Spanish Civil War]], its role as a political police, its [[counter-espionage]] activities during [[World War II]] and its [[counter-insurgency]] operations in the [[Portuguese Colonial War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldwithouttorture.org/tag/pide/ 25 de Abril Always], worldwithouttorture.org, retrieved 21 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.photius.com/countries/portugal/national_security/portugal_national_security_intelligence_service~1142.html Portugal Intelligence Services], photius.com, retrieved 21 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Background===
During the [[Portuguese First Republic]] and the following ''[[Ditadura Nacional]]'' regimes, the police services were reorganized several times, with the remote ancestors of PIDE appearing. 

In 1918, the police services were organized as an [[umbrella organization]] named Civic Police, which started to include two agencies that were the remote ancestors of the PIDE: the Preventive Police and the Emigration Police. The first agency was a secret police responsible for the State security. The Preventive Police would become the State Security Police in 1919, the Social Defense Police in April 1919, and the Preventive and State Security Police in October 1919. The Emigration Police was an agency responsible for the border and migration control, with a special focus in the fight against illegal emigration.

After the [[28 May 1926 coup d'état]] and the establishment of the military ''Ditadura Nacional'', the Preventive and State Security Police was disbanded. However, soon after, two similar agencies were created, the Lisbon Information Police and the Porto Information Police, respectively under the control of the civil governor of Lisbon and the civil governor of Porto. In 1928, the two agencies were merged into a single Information Police under the direct control of the Minister of the Interior. In the same year, the Portuguese International Police was created as a section of the Information Police, succeeding the former Emigration Police. In 1931, the Information Police was disbanded and the Portuguese International Police became autonomous, under the direct control of the Minister of the Interior. In 1932, the Political and Social Surveillance Section of the Portuguese International Police was created, with the same role of the former Information Police. 

Already with Salazar in office as prime-minister, the Political and Social Surveillance Section became autonomous in January 1933, as the Political and Social Surveillance Police. The Portuguese International Police and the Political and Social Surveillance Police would merge in August 1933, as the PVDE.

===PVDE===
The origins of PIDE can be traced to 1933, the year of the inauguration of the ''Estado Novo''. Under direct orders from Salazar himself, the Surveillance and State Defence (''Polícia de Vigilância e de Defesa do Estado'') or PVDE was created, with two main sections:
*Social and Political Defence Section, which was used to prevent and repress crimes of a political and social nature (see: [[Censorship]])
*International Section'', which was used to control the entrance of [[immigrant]]s, to expel undesirable immigrants and to take care of [[counter-espionage]] and/or international espionage.

PVDE was founded and led by Captain Agostinho Lourenço. According to Professor Douglas Wheeler “an analysis of Lourenco´s career suggest strongly that British Intelligence Services’ influence had an impact on the structure and activity of PVDE”. Lourcenço had earned a reputation with British observers, recorded in a confidential print generated at the British Embassy, which suggested a “pro-British” bias on his part. Lourenço always kept a good relationship with the [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] which allowed him to later in 1956 became the head of international police organization, [[Interpol]].

In 1936, the [[prison]] of [[Tarrafal camp|Tarrafal]] was created in the [[Portuguese Cape Verde|Portuguese colony of Cape Verde]]. This camp, under the direct control of the PVDE, was the destination for those political prisoners considered dangerous by the regime. Among the first prisoners were the convicted sailors from the 1936 Naval Revolt. The sailors affiliated with the Communist Party, had attempted to sail two Portuguese Navy ships out of Lisbon to join the Spanish Republican forces fighting in Spain. Throughout the more than 40 years of the ''Estado Novo'', 32 people lost their lives in Tarrafal, which was known for its severe methods of torture.

Also in 1936, with the beginning of the [[Spanish Civil War]] and in 1937 with the attempt against Salazar's life by [[anarchist]] militants, the PVDE started focusing its battle against [[communism]] and the underground [[Portuguese Communist Party]]. During this pre-[[World War II]] period, several [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italian]] and [[Nazi Germany|German]] advisors came to Portugal to help the PVDE to adopt a model similar to the [[Gestapo]].

During World War II, the PVDE experienced its most intense period of activity. Neutral [[Lisbon]] was the [[Europe]]an centre of [[espionage]] and one of the favourite [[exile]] destinations. Writers such as [[Ian Fleming]] (the creator of [[James Bond]]) were based there, while other prominent people such as the [[Duke of Windsor]] and the [[Spanish monarchy|Spanish Royal Family]] were exiled in Estoril. German spies attempted to buy information on trans-[[Atlantic]] [[shipping]] to help their [[submarine]]s fight the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. The Spaniard Juan Pujol Garcia, better known as [[Juan Pujol (alias Garbo)|Codename Garbo]], passed on misinformation to the Germans, hoping it would hasten the end of the [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] regime - he was recruited by Britain as a [[double agent]] while in Lisbon. Conversely, [[William Colepaugh]], an [[United States|American]] [[traitor]], was recruited as an [[secret agent|agent]] by the Germans while his ship was in port in Lisbon - he was subsequently landed by [[U-boat]], {{GS|U-1230||2}}, in [[Maine]] before being captured. In June 1943, a commercial [[airliner]] carrying the [[actor]] [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]] was shot down over the [[Bay of Biscay]] by the [[Luftwaffe]] after taking off from Lisbon, possibly because German spies in Lisbon believed that [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] was on board.

Several [[United States|American]] reports called Lisbon "The Capital of Espionage". However, the PVDE always maintained a neutral stance towards foreign espionage activity, as long as no one intervened in Portuguese internal policies.

===PIDE===
[[File:Vila Algarve, Maputo, Nov 2011.jpg|thumb|235px|''Vila Algarve'' in November 2011, the former headquarters of PIDE in Mozambique, at Lourenço Marques (presently [[Maputo]]).]]  
In 1945, the PVDE was dissolved and replaced by the PIDE. Unlike its predecessor, which sought inspiration in the Gestapo, PIDE followed the [[Scotland Yard]] model. Receiving the same status as the ''[[Polícia Judiciária]]'' (criminal investigation police), it had full powers to investigate, detain, and arrest anyone who was thought to be plotting against the State. It had two main functions:
*Administrative functions (which included those related to the migration services)
*[[Criminal]] prevention and repression functions

PIDE is considered by many authors as being one of the most functional and effective [[secret service]]s in history. Using a wide network of [[covert cell]]s, which were spread throughout Portugal and its overseas territories, PIDE had infiltrated agents into almost every underground movement, including the Portuguese Communist Party as well as the independence movements in [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] and [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]]. The PIDE encouraged citizens - the so-called ''bufos'' (snitches) - to denounce suspicious activities, through the use of monetary and prestige incentives. This resulted in an extremely effective espionage service which was able to fully control almost every aspect of Portuguese daily life.

The PIDE intensified its actions during the [[Colonial War|Portuguese Colonial War]], creating a successful paramilitary unit called [[Flechas]] (Arrows). [[Yves Guérin-Sérac]], a former officer of the [[French Army]] and founder of the [[Organisation armée secrète|OAS]] [[right-wing terrorist]] group during the [[Algerian War of Independence]] (1954–62), set up "[[Aginter Press]]" in Lisbon and participated with the PIDE in [[covert operation]]s.

In 1969, [[Marcelo Caetano]] changed the name PIDE to DGS (''Direcção-Geral de Segurança'', "General Security Directorate"). The death of Salazar and the subsequent ascension of Caetano brought some attempts at [[democratization]], in order to avoid popular insurgency against [[censorship]], the ongoing colonial war, and the general restriction of civil rights. This resulted in a decrease in the perceived level of [[violence]] used by the secret police and a consequent reduction in its effectiveness.

==End of PIDE/DGS==
The most dramatic moments of the 1974 Carnation Revolution occurred near the DGS headquarters at António Maria Cardoso Street in Lisbon. Unidentified agents - desperate after being surrounded by rebellious troops and a throng of civilians - opened fire from the top of the building, killing four demonstrators. In turn, a DGS agent was also killed by the rebellious troops when trying to escape. These five people were the only victims of the coup d'état which brought down the dictatorship.

This was the last strategic point to be occupied by the insurgents, thus leading to the escape of many of the agents and the destruction of most of the records. In the days following the revolution, most escaped to [[Spain]] or went underground. Many of the agents, including the director-general Silva Pais were however captured. 89 of those agents would latter escape from the Alcoentre penitentiary, in a massive and never well-explained prison break in June 1975.

Some of the PIDE/DGS archives were reportedly handed over by the Portuguese Communist Party to [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] agents{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}.

After being ''sanitized'', the corporation continued its operations in the Portuguese colonies under the name of the Military Information Police (''Polícia de Informação Militar'').

A commission was created for the extinction of the secret police. The remainder of the documents since 1990 are in the [[Torre do Tombo]] National Archive. They can be consulted, but the names of agents and informers are not disclosed.

The only PIDE agents who faced trial were those responsible for the death of exiled opposition leader [[Humberto Delgado]]. They were [[tried in absentia|tried ''in absentia'']] and the case dragged on for several years. None of them ever served time in jail.

The brutality of the PIDE/DGS is dramatised in the 2000 film ''[[April Captains]]'', about the events of the day of the Carnation Revolution.

Because of the memory of the abuses of the PIDE/DGS in supporting the regime, the establishment of a new civilian intelligence agency was delayed for more than a decade. However, following [[1983 Turkish embassy attack in Lisbon|a terrorist attack]] on the [[Embassy]] of [[Turkey]], the assassination of a [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] representative at a [[Socialist International]] conference in 1983, and a number of domestic terrorist attacks by isolated far-left and far-right groups, the [[Government of Portugal|Portuguese government]] became convinced of the need for a new intelligence agency. This led to the establishment of the [[Sistema de Informações da República Portuguesa]] (SIRP, Intelligence System of the Portuguese Republic) in 1984.

The '''Chinese People's Liberation Army''' ('''PLA''') is the armed forces of the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) and [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC). The PLA consists of five professional service branches: the [[People's Liberation Army Ground Force|Ground Force]], [[People's Liberation Army Navy|Navy]], [[People's Liberation Army Air Force|Air Force]], [[People's Liberation Army Rocket Force|Rocket Force]], and the [[People's Liberation Army Strategic Support Force|Strategic Support Force]]. Units around the country are assigned to one of five [[Theater (warfare)|Theater commands]] by geographical location. The PLA is [[List of countries by number of military and paramilitary personnel|the world's largest military force]] and constitutes the [[List of countries by military expenditures|second largest defence budget in the world]]. It is one of the fastest modernising military power in the world and has been termed as a [[Potential superpowers#China|potential military superpower]], with significant regional defense and rising global power projection capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = China News: Asia Times Online is a quality Internet-only publication that reports and examines geopolitical, political, economic and business issues.

The PLA is under the command of the [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] (CMC) of the CPC. It is legally obliged to follow the principle of [[civilian control of the military]], although in practical terms this principle has been implemented in such a way as to ensure the PLA is under the absolute control of the [[Communist Party of China]]. Its [[commander in chief]] is the [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]] (usually the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]]). The [[Ministry of National Defense of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of National Defense]], which operates under the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]], does not exercise any authority over the PLA and is far less powerful than the CMC. 

[[Military service]] is compulsory by law; however, compulsory military service in China has never been enforced due to large numbers of military and paramilitary personnel. In times of national emergency, the [[People's Armed Police]] and the [[People's Liberation Army militia]] act as a reserve and support element for the [[People's Liberation Army Ground Force|PLAGF]].

== Mission statement ==
Former CMC chairman [[Hu Jintao]] had defined the missions of the PLA as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.rand.org/pubs/testimonies/2009/RAND_CT332.pdf |title = The PLA Navy's '&amp;#39;New Historic Missions'&amp;#39;: Expanding Capabilities for a Re-emergent Maritime Power |format = PDF |accessdate = 1 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second Sino-Japanese War ===
{{Further information|Chinese Civil War|Second Sino-Japanese War}}

The People's Liberation Army was founded on 1 August 1927 during the [[Nanchang uprising]] when troops of the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) rebelled under the leadership of [[Zhu De]], [[He Long]], [[Ye Jianying]] and [[Zhou Enlai]] after the [[Shanghai massacre of 1927|massacre of the Communists]] by [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. They were then known as the [[Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army]], or simply the Red Army. Between 1934 and 1935, the Red Army survived several campaigns led against it by Chiang Kai-Shek and engaged in the [[Long March]].

During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] from 1937 to 1945, the Communist military forces were nominally integrated into the [[National Revolutionary Army]] of the [[Republic of China]] forming two main units known as the [[Eighth Route Army]] and the [[New Fourth Army]]. During this time, these two military groups primarily employed [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla tactics]], generally avoiding large-scale battles with the Japanese with some exceptions while at the same time consolidating their ground by absorbing nationalist troops and paramilitary forces behind Japanese lines into their forces. After the Japanese surrendered in 1945, the Communist Party merged the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army, renaming the new million-strong force the "People's Liberation Army". They eventually won the [[Chinese Civil War]], establishing the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949. The PLA then saw a huge reorganisation with the establishment of the Air Force leadership structure in November 1949 followed by the Navy leadership the following April. In 1950, the leadership structures of the artillery, armoured troops, air defence troops, public security forces, and worker–soldier militias were also established. The chemical warfare defence forces, the railroad forces, the communications forces, and the strategic forces, as well as other separate forces (like engineering and construction, logistics and medical services), were established later on, all these depended on the leadership of the Communist Party and the National People's Congress via the Central Military Commission (and until 1975 the National Defense Council).

The banner in the background of the picture bears a slogan (in Chinese) which declares "The Friendship And Unity Of The North Korean And Chinese Peoples Are Always Steadfast And Strong!"]]

During the 1950s, the PLA with Soviet assistance began to transform itself from a peasant army into a modern one.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url = http://libweb.uoregon.edu/ec/e-asia/read/chicom.pdf |title=Pamphlet number 30-51, Handbook on the Chinese Communist Army |publisher=Department of the Army |date=7 December 1960 |accessdate=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of this process was the reorganisation that created thirteen military regions in 1955. The PLA also contained many former [[National Revolutionary Army]] units and generals who had defected to the PLA. [[Ma Hongbin]] and his son [[Ma Dunjing (1906–1972)]] were the only two Muslim generals who led a Muslim unit, the 81st corps, to ever serve in the PLA. [[Han Youwen]], a Salar Muslim general, also defected to the PLA. In November 1950, some units of the PLA under the name of the [[People's Volunteer Army]] intervened in the [[Korean War]] as United Nations forces under General [[Douglas MacArthur]] approached the [[Yalu River]]. Under the weight of this offensive, Chinese forces drove MacArthur's forces out of North Korea and captured [[Seoul]], but were subsequently pushed back south of Pyongyang north of the [[38th parallel north|38th Parallel]]. The war also served as a catalyst for the rapid modernisation of the [[PLAAF]]. In 1962, the PLA ground force also fought India in the [[Sino-Indian War]], achieving all objectives.

Prior to the [[Cultural Revolution]], military region commanders tended to remain in their posts for long periods of time. As the PLA took a stronger role in politics, this began to be seen as somewhat of a threat to the party's (or, at least, civilian) control of the military. The longest-serving military region commanders were [[Xu Shiyou]] in the [[Nanjing Military Region]] (1954–74), [[Yang Dezhi]] in the [[Jinan Military Region]] (1958–74), [[Chen Xilian]] in the [[Shenyang Military Region]] (1959–73), and [[Han Xianchu]] in the Fuzhou Military Region (1960–74). The establishment of a professional military force equipped with modern weapons and doctrine was the last of the [[Four Modernizations]] announced by Zhou Enlai and supported by [[Deng Xiaoping]]. In keeping with Deng's mandate to reform, the PLA has demobilised millions of men and women since 1978 and has introduced modern methods in such areas as [[military recruitment|recruitment]] and manpower, [[military strategy|strategy]], and [[military education and training|education and training]]. In 1979, the PLA fought [[Vietnam]] over a border skirmish in the [[Sino-Vietnamese War]] where both sides claimed victory.

During the Sino-Soviet split, strained relations between China and Soviet Russia resulted in bloody border clashes and mutual backing of each other's enemies. China and Afghanistan had neutral relations with each other during the King's rule. When the pro-Soviet Afghan Communists seized power in Afghanistan in 1978, relations between China and the Afghan communists quickly turned hostile. The Afghan pro-Soviet communists supported China's enemies in Vietnam and blamed China for supporting Afghan anti-communist militants. China responded to the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] by supporting the [[Afghan mujahideen]] and ramping up their military presence near Afghanistan in Xinjiang. China acquired military equipment from the United States to defend itself from Soviet attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=S. Frederick Starri |editor=S.

The [[People's Liberation Army Ground Force]] trained and supported the Afghan Mujahidin during the Soviet–Afghan War, moving its training camps for the mujahideen from Pakistan into China itself. Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of anti-aircraft missiles, rocket launchers and machine guns were given to the Mujahidin by the Chinese. Chinese military advisors and army troops were also present with the Mujahidin during training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=S. Frederick Starr |editor=S.

=== Since 1980 ===
In the 1980s, China shrunk its military considerably to free up resources for [[economic development]], resulting in the relative decline in resources devoted to the PLA. Following the [[People's Liberation Army at Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|PLA's suppression]] of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], ideological correctness was temporarily revived as the dominant theme in Chinese military affairs. Reform and modernisation have today resumed their position as the PLA's primary objectives, although the armed forces' political loyalty to the CPC has remained a leading concern. Another area of concern to the political leadership was the PLA's involvement in civilian economic activities. These activities were thought to have impacted PLA readiness and has led the political leadership to attempt to divest the PLA from its non-military business interests.

Beginning in the 1980s, the PLA tried to transform itself from a land-based power centred on a vast ground force to a smaller, more mobile, high-tech one capable of mounting operations beyond its borders. The motivation for this was that a massive land invasion by Russia was no longer seen as a major threat, and the new threats to China are seen to be a declaration of independence by [[Taiwan]], possibly with assistance from the United States, or a confrontation over the [[Spratly Islands]]. In 1985, under the leadership of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China]] and the CMC, the PLA changed from being constantly prepared to "hit early, strike hard and to fight a nuclear war" to developing the military in an era of peace. The PLA reoriented itself to modernization, improving its fighting ability, and to become a world-class force. Deng Xiaoping stressed that the PLA needed to focus more on quality rather than on quantity. The decision of the Chinese government in 1985 to reduce the size of the military by one million was completed by 1987. Staffing in military leadership was cut by about 50 percent. During the Ninth Five Year Plan (1996–2000) the PLA was reduced by a further 500,000. The PLA had also been expected to be reduced by another 200,000 by 2005. The PLA has focused on increasing mechanisation and informatization so as to be able to fight a high-intensity war.&lt;ref&gt;The Political System of the People's Republic of China.

[[File:Chinese honor guard in column 070322-F-0193C-014.JPEG|thumb|upright=1.25|PLA in Beijing, 2007]]

Former CMC chairman [[Jiang Zemin]] in 1990 called on the military to "meet political standards, be militarily competent, have a good working style, adhere strictly to discipline, and provide vigorous logistic support" ({{zh |s = 政治合格、军事过硬、作风优良、纪律严明、保障有力 |p = zhèngzhì hégé, jūnshì guòyìng, zuòfēng yōuliáng, jìlǜ yánmíng, bǎozhàng yǒulì }}).&lt;ref&gt;News of the Communist Party of China, [http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/67481/69242/69244/4690367.html Hyperlink] . Retrieved 28 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1991 [[Gulf War]] provided the Chinese leadership with a stark realisation that the PLA was an oversized, almost-obsolete force. The possibility of a militarised Japan has also been a continuous concern to the Chinese leadership since the late 1990s. In addition, China's military leadership has been reacting to and learning from the successes and failures of the [[Military of the United States|American military]] during the [[Kosovo War]], the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|2001 invasion of Afghanistan]], the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], and the [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|Iraqi insurgency]]. All these lessons inspired China to transform the PLA from a military based on quantity to one based on quality. Chairman [[Jiang Zemin]] officially made a "[[Revolution in Military Affairs]]" (RMA) part of the official national military strategy in 1993 to [[Modernization of the People's Liberation Army|modernise the Chinese armed forces]]. A goal of the RMA is to transform the PLA into a force capable of winning what it calls "local wars under high-tech conditions" rather than a massive, numbers-dominated ground-type war. Chinese military planners call for short decisive campaigns, limited in both their geographic scope and their political goals. In contrast to the past, more attention is given to [[reconnaissance]], mobility, and deep reach. This new vision has shifted resources towards the navy and air force. The PLA is also actively preparing for [[space warfare]] and [[cyber-warfare]].

For the past 10 to 20 years, the PLA has acquired some advanced weapons systems from Russia, including [[Sovremenny class destroyers]], [[Sukhoi Su-27]] and [[Sukhoi Su-30]] aircraft, and [[Kilo class submarine|Kilo-class]] diesel-electric submarines. It has also started to produce several new classes of destroyers and frigates including the [[Type 052D]] class guided missile destroyer. In addition, the PLAAF has designed its very own [[Chengdu J-10]] fighter aircraft and a new stealth fighter, the [[Chengdu J-20]]. The PLA launched the new [[Type 094 submarine|Jin class]] nuclear submarines on 3 December 2004 capable of launching nuclear warheads that could strike targets across the Pacific Ocean and have two aircraft carriers, one commissioned in 2012 and a second launched in 2017.

In 2015, the PLA formed new units including the PLA Ground Force, the PLA Rocket Force and the PLA Strategic Support Force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.chinamil.com.cn/news-channels/photo-reports/2016-01/01/content_6840110.htm China establishes Rocket Force and Strategic Support Force - China Military Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The PLA on 1 August 2017 marked the 90th anniversary since its establishment, before the big anniversary it mounted its biggest parade yet and the first outside of Beijing, held in the [[Zhurihe Training Base]] in the [[Northern Theater Command]] (within the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region), the first time it had ever been done to mark PLA Day as past parades had already been on 1 October, National Day of the PRC.

=== Peacekeeping operations ===
The People's Republic of China has sent the PLA to various hotspots as part of China's role as a prominent member of the United Nations. Such units usually include engineers and logistical units and members of the paramilitary [[People's Armed Police]] and have been deployed as part of peacekeeping operations in [[Lebanon]],&lt;ref&gt;2012-06-21, [http://english.people.com.cn/90786/7853069.html New Chinese peacekeeping force arrives in Lebanon], ''People's Daily''&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Republic of the Congo]],&lt;ref&gt;2012-10-20, [http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90786/7984656.html Chinese peacekeepers to Congo (K) win medals], PLA Daily&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sudan]],&lt;ref&gt;Daniel M.

== Organization ==

=== National military command ===
The state military system upholds the principle of the CPC's absolute leadership over the armed forces. The party and the State jointly established the CMC that carries out the task of supreme military leadership over the armed forces. The [[1954 Constitution of the People's Republic of China|1954 Constitution]] stated that the State President directs the armed forces and made the State President the chairman of the Defense Commission. The Defense Commission is an advisory body and does not hold any actual power over the armed forces. On 28 September 1954, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party re-established the CMC as the commanding organ of the PLA. From that time onward, the current system of a joint system of party and state leadership of the military was established. The Central Committee of the Communist Party leads in all military affairs. The State President directs the state military forces and the development of the military forces which is managed by the State Council.

To ensure the absolute leadership of the Communist Party over the armed forces, every level of party committee in the military forces implements the principles of democratic centralism. In addition, division-level and higher units establish political commissars and political organisations, ensuring that the branch organisations are in line. These systems combined the party organisation with the military organisation to achieve the party's leadership and administrative leadership. This is seen as the key guarantee to the absolute leadership of the party over the military.

In October 2014 the [[People's Liberation Army Daily|PLA Daily]] reminded readers of the [[Gutian Congress]], which stipulated the basic principle of the Party controlling the military, and called for vigilance as "[f]oreign hostile forces preach the nationalization and de-politicization of the military, attempting to muddle our minds and drag our military out from under the Party's flag."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinamil.com.cn/jfjbmap/content/2014-10/27/content_91241.htm 在弘扬古田会议精神中铸牢军魂, ''Zài hóngyáng gǔtián huìyì jīngshén zhōng zhù láo jūn hún''] ''[[People's Liberation Army Daily|PLA Daily]]'' 27 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Military leadership ===
The leadership by the CPC is a fundamental principle of the Chinese military command system. The PLA reports not to the State Council but rather to two Central Military Commissions, one belonging to the state and one belonging to the party.

In practice, the two central military commissions usually do not contradict each other because their membership is usually identical. Often, the only difference in membership between the two occurs for a few months every five years, during the period between a party congress, when Party CMC membership changes, and the next ensuing [[National People's Congress]], when the state CMC changes.

The leadership of each type of military force is under the leadership and management of the corresponding part of the Central Military Commission of the CPC Central Committee. Forces under each military branch or force such as the subordinate forces, academies and schools, scientific research and engineering institutions and logistical support organisations are also under the leadership of the CMC. This arrangement has been especially useful as China over the past several decades has moved increasingly towards military organisations composed of forces from more than one military branch. In September 1982, to meet the needs of modernisation and to improve co-ordination in the command of forces including multiple service branches and to strengthen unified command of the military, the CMC ordered the abolition of the leadership organisation of the various military branches. Today, the PLA has air force, navy and second artillery leadership organs.

In 1986, the People's Armed Forces Department, except in some border regions, was placed under the joint leadership of the PLA and the local authorities. Although the local party organisations paid close attention to the People's Armed Forces Department, as a result of some practical problems, the CMC decided that from 1 April 1996, the People's Armed Forces Department would once again fall under the jurisdiction of the PLA.

According to the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]], the CMC is composed of the following: the Chairman, Vice-Chairmen and Members. The [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]] has overall responsibility for the commission.

&lt;center&gt;'''The Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China and the Central Military Commission of the People's Republic of China'''&lt;/center&gt;

; Chairman:
* [[Xi Jinping]] (also [[General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party]], [[President of the People's Republic of China]], and Commander-in-chief of the PLA)

; Vice Chairmen:
* Air Force General [[Xu Qiliang]] 
* General [[Zhang Youxia]]

; Members:
* [[Ministry of National Defense of the People's Republic of China|Minister of National Defense]] – General [[Wei Fenghe]]
* Chief of the [[Joint Staff Department of the Central Military Commission|Joint staff]] – General [[Li Zuocheng]]
* Director of the [[Political Work Department of the Central Military Commission|Political Work Department]] – Admiral [[Miao Hua]]
* Secretary of the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] – General [[Zhang Shengmin]]

=== Central Military Commission ===
In December 1982, the fifth National People's Congress revised the state constitution to state that the State Central Military Commission leads all the armed forces of the state. The chairman of the State CMC is chosen and removed by the full NPC while the other members are chosen by the NPC standing committee. However, the CMC of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party remained the party organisation that directly commands the military and all the other armed forces.

In actual practice, the party CMC, after consultation with the democratic parties, proposes the names of the State CMC members of the NPC so that these people after going through the legal processes can be elected by the NPC to the State Central Military Commission. That is to say, that the CMC of the Central Committee and the CMC of the State are one group and one organisation. However, looking at it organizationally, these two CMCs are subordinate to two different systems – the party system and the state system. Therefore, the armed forces are under the absolute leadership of the Communist Party and are also the armed forces of the state. This is a unique joint leadership system that reflects the origin of the PLA as the military branch of the Communist Party. It only became the national military when the People's Republic of China was established in 1949.

By convention, the chairman and vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission are civilian members of the Communist Party of China, but they are not necessarily the heads of the civilian government. Both [[Jiang Zemin]] and [[Deng Xiaoping]] retained the office of chairman even after relinquishing their other positions. All of the other members of the CMC are uniformed active military officials. Unlike other nations, the [[Minister of National Defense of the People's Republic of China|Minister of National Defense]] is not the head of the military, but is usually a vice-chairman of the CMC.

In 2012, to attempt to reduce corruption at the highest rungs of the leadership of the Chinese military, the commission banned the service of alcohol at military receptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/china/2012/china-121222-voa01.htm |title = Strict Changes Announced for China Military Brass |author = John Pike |publisher = globalsecurity.org |accessdate = 1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2016 military reforms ===
On 1 January 2016, The Central Military Commission (CMC) released a guideline&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = China releases guideline on military reform - Xinhua {{!}} English.news.cn |url = http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-01/01/c_134970353.htm |website = news.xinhuanet.com |accessdate = 2016-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on deepening national defense and military reform, about a month after CMC Chairman Xi Jinping called for an overhaul of the military administration and command system at a key meeting.

On 11 January 2016, the PLA created a joint staff directly attached to the Central Military Commission (CMC), the highest leadership organization in the military. The previous four general headquarters of the PLA were disbanded and completely reformed. They were divided into  '''15 functional departments instead''' — a significant expansion from the domain of the General Office, which is now a single department within the Central Military Commission .

# General Office (办公厅)
# Joint Staff Department (联合参谋部) 
# Political Work Department (政治工作部)
# Logistic Support Department (后勤保障部)
# Equipment Development Department (装备发展部)
# Training and Administration Department (训练管理部)
# National Defense Mobilization Department (国防动员部)
# Discipline Inspection Commission (纪律检查委员会)
# Politics and Legal Affairs Commission (政法委员会)
# Science and Technology Commission (科学技术委员会)
# Office for Strategic Planning (战略规划办公室)
# Office for Reform and Organizational Structure (改革和编制办公室)
# Office for International Military Cooperation (国际军事合作办公室)
# Audit Office (审计署)
# Agency for Offices Administration (机关事务管理总局)

Included among the 15 departments are three commissions. The CMC Discipline Inspection Commission is charged with rooting out corruption.

=== Theater commands ===
[[File:Map of Theatres of PLA en.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|The five theater commands of the PLA.{{Citation needed||date=February 2016}}]]

{{Main article|Theater commands of the People's Liberation Army}}

Until 2016, China's territory was divided into seven [[PLA Military Region|military regions]], but they were reorganized into five theater commands in early 2016. This reflects a change in their concept of operations from primarily ground-oriented to mobile and coordinated movement of all services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://asia.nikkei.com/Features/China-up-close/Xi-declares-victory-over-old-rivals-Jiang-Hu Xi declares victory over old rivals Jiang, Hu] Asia Nikkei Asian Review, Feb 11, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The five new theatre commands are:
* [[Eastern Theater Command]]
* [[Western Theater Command]]
* [[Northern Theater Command]]
* [[Southern Theater Command]]
* [[Central Theater Command]]

The PLA [[garrison]]s in [[People's Liberation Army Hong Kong Garrison|Hong Kong]] and [[People's Liberation Army Macau Garrison|Macau]] both come under the Southern Theater Command.

The military reforms have also introduced a major change in the areas of responsibilities. Rather than separately commanding their own troops, service branches are now primarily responsible for administrative tasks (like equipping and maintaining the troops). It is the theater commands now that have the command authority. This should, in theory, facilitate the implementation of joint operations across all service branches.&lt;ref&gt;"2.12 The military and politics," in: [[Sebastian Heilmann]], editor, [{{cite web |url=https://www.merics.org/en/about-us/merics-analysis/chinas-political-system/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170323234015/https://www.merics.org/en/about-us/merics-analysis/chinas-political-system/ |archivedate=23 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }} China''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s Political System'']'','' Lanham, Boulder, New York, London: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers (2017)   {{ISBN|978-1442277342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coordination with civilian national security groups such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is achieved primarily by the leading groups of the Communist Party of China. Particularly important are the leading groups on foreign affairs, which include those dealing with Taiwan.

== Service branches ==
The PLA encompasses five main service branches: the Ground Force, the Navy, the Air Force, the Rocket Force, and the Strategic Support Force. Following the 200,000 troop reduction announced in 2003, the total strength of the PLA has been reduced from 2.5 million to just under 2.3 million. Further reforms will see an additional 300,000 personnel reduction from its current strength of 2.28 million personnel. The reductions will come mainly from non-combat ground forces, which will allow more funds to be diverted to naval, air, and strategic missile forces.  This shows China's shift from ground force prioritisation to emphasising air and naval power with high-tech equipment for offensive roles over disputed coastal territories.&lt;ref name="areas"&gt;[http://the-japan-news.com/news/article/0000911699 China plans military reform to enhance its readiness] – The-Japan-news.com, 2 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the PLA has paid close attention to the performance of US forces in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq]]. As well as learning from the success of the US military in [[network-centric warfare]], joint operations, [[C4ISTAR|C4ISR]], and [[High tech|hi-tech]] [[weapon]]ry, the PLA is also studying unconventional tactics that could be used to exploit the vulnerabilities of a more technologically advanced enemy. This has been reflected in the two parallel guidelines for the PLA ground forces development. While speeding up the process of introducing new technology into the force and retiring the older equipment, the PLA has also placed an emphasis on [[asymmetric warfare]], including exploring new methods of using existing equipment to defeat a technologically superior enemy.

In addition to the four main service branches, the PLA is supported by two [[Paramilitary forces of China|paramilitary organisations]]: the [[People's Armed Police]] (including the [[China Coast Guard]]) and the [[Militia (China)|Militia]] (including the maritime militia).

=== Ground Force ===
[[File:ZTZ-99A tank 20170902.jpg|thumb|A [[Type 99 tank|Type 99A]] Main battle tank in service with the PLAGF.]]
{{Main article|People's Liberation Army Ground Force}}

The PLA has a ground force with 975,000 personnel, about half of the PLA's total manpower of around 2 million.&lt;ref name="IISS2018_p250"&gt;[[International Institute for Strategic Studies]]: The Military Balance 2018, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; The ground forces are divided among the five theatre commands as named above. In times of crisis, the PLA Ground Force will be reinforced by numerous [[Military reserve force|reserve]] and paramilitary units. The PLAGF reserve component has about 510,000 personnel divided into 30 infantry and 12 anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) divisions. In recent years two amphibious mechanised divisions were also established in Nanjing and Guangzhou MR. At least 40 percent of PLA divisions and brigades are now mechanised or armoured, almost double the percentage before 2015.

While much of the PLA Ground Force was being reduced over the past few years, technology-intensive elements such as [[special operations forces]] (SOF), [[army aviation]], [[surface-to-air missile]]s (SAMs), and electronic warfare units have all been rapidly expanded. The latest operational [[military doctrine|doctrine]] of the PLA ground forces highlights the importance of information technology, [[electronic warfare|electronic]] and [[information warfare]], and long-range [[precision strike]]s in future warfare. The older generation telephone/radio-based command, control, and communications (C3) systems are being replaced by an integrated battlefield information networks featuring local/wide-area networks ([[LAN]]/[[Wide area network|WAN]]), [[satellite communications]], [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] (UAV)-based [[surveillance]] and [[reconnaissance]] systems, and mobile [[command and control]] centres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.sinodefence.com/army/default.asp |title = Chinese Ground Forces |publisher = SinoDefence.com |accessdate = 12 February 2010 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131104200224/http://www.sinodefence.com/army/default.asp |archivedate = 4 November 2013 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 January 2016, as part of military reforms, China created for the first time a separate headquarters for the ground forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Sub-anchor: New units of PLA forces - Xinhua {{!}} English.news.cn |url = http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/video/2016-01/03/c_134973168.htm |website = news.xinhuanet.com |accessdate = 2016-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; China's ground forces have never had their own headquarters until now. Previously, the People's Liberation Army's Four General Departments served as the de facto army headquarters, functioning together as the equivalent of a joint staff, to which the navy, air force and the newly renamed Rocket Force would report. The Commander of the PLA Ground Force is [[Han Weiguo]]. The Political Commissar is [[Liu Lei]].

=== Navy ===

{{Main article|People's Liberation Army Navy}}

Until the early 1990s, the navy performed a subordinate role to the [[People's Liberation Army Ground Force|PLA Land Forces]]. Since then it has undergone rapid modernisation. The 240,000 strong People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) is organised into three major fleets: the [[North Sea Fleet]] headquartered at [[Qingdao]], the [[East Sea Fleet]] headquartered at [[Ningbo]], and the [[South Sea Fleet]] headquartered in [[Zhanjiang]]. Each fleet consists of a number of [[surface ship]], [[submarine]], [[naval air force]], [[coastal defence and fortification|coastal defence]], and [[marine (military)|marine]] units.&lt;ref name="Studies20182"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AyqdtAEACAAJ|title=The Military Balance 2018|author=International Institute for Strategic Studies|date=14 February 2018|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-85743-955-7|pages=249–259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The navy includes a 15,000 strong [[People's Liberation Army Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] (organised into two brigades), a 26,000 strong [[People's Liberation Army Naval Air Force|Naval Aviation Force]] operating several hundred attack helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft.&lt;ref name="Studies20184"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AyqdtAEACAAJ |title=The Military Balance 2018 |author=International Institute for Strategic Studies |date=14 February 2018 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-85743-955-7 |pages=249–259 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of its overall programme of naval modernisation, the PLAN is in the stage of developing a [[blue water navy]]. In November 2012, then President [[Hu Jintao]] reported to the Chinese [[Communist_Party_of_China|Communist Party]] Congress his desire to “enhance our capacity for exploiting marine resource and build China into a strong maritime power.”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.defensenews.com/global/asia-pacific/2018/07/03/china-launches-two-destroyers/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|People's Liberation Army Air Force}}

The 395,000 strong People's Liberation Army Air Force is organised into five Theater Command Air Forces (TCAF) and 24 air divisions.&lt;ref name="Studies20185"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AyqdtAEACAAJ|title=The Military Balance 2018|author=International Institute for Strategic Studies|date=14 February 2018|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-85743-955-7|pages=249–259}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest operational units within the Aviation Corps is the air division, which has 2 to 3 aviation regiments, each with 20 to 36 aircraft. The [[surface-to-air missile]] (SAM) Corps is organised into SAM [[division (military)|divisions]] and [[brigade]]s. There are also three airborne [[15th Airborne Corps|divisions]] manned by the PLAAF. [[J-XX]] and [[XXJ]] are names applied by Western intelligence agencies to describe programs by the [[People's Republic of China]] to develop one or more [[Fifth generation jet fighter|fifth-generation]] [[fighter aircraft]].&lt;ref name="JDW"&gt;Chang 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="miltech"&gt;Coniglio 2006, P.44&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:China Announces Troop Cuts at WWII Parade (screenshot) 20159180736.JPG|thumb|DF-21D on 2015 China WWII Parade.]]
{{Main article|People's Liberation Army Rocket Force}}

The 100,000 strong People's Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) is the main strategic missile force of the PLA.&lt;ref name="Studies20186"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AyqdtAEACAAJ|title=The Military Balance 2018|author=International Institute for Strategic Studies|date=14 February 2018|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-85743-955-7|pages=249–259}}&lt;/ref&gt; It controls China's [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] and conventional [[strategic missile]]s. China's total nuclear arsenal size is estimated to be between 100 and 400 (thermo)nuclear weapons. The PLARF has approximately 100,000 personnel and six ballistic missile divisions (missile corps bases). The six divisions are independently deployed in different theater commands and have a total of 15 to 20 missile brigades.

=== Strategic Support Force ===
{{Main article|People's Liberation Army Strategic Support Force}}

Founded on December 31, 2015 as part of the first wave of reforms of the PLA, the People's Liberation Army Strategic Support Force is the newest branch of the PLA. It as strength of 175,000.&lt;ref name="Studies20187"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AyqdtAEACAAJ|title=The Military Balance 2018|author=International Institute for Strategic Studies|date=14 February 2018|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-85743-955-7|pages=249–259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial announcements regarding the Strategic Support Force did not provide much detail, but Yang Yujun of the Chinese Ministry of Defense described it as a combination of all support forces. Additionally, commentators speculate that it will include high-tech operations forces such as space, [[cyberspace]] and [[electronic warfare]] operations units, independent of other branches of the military.&lt;ref name=boldstep&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/china-takes-bold-steps-toward-military-reform |title = China Takes Bold Steps Toward Military Reform |website = Stratfor }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another expert, Yin Zhuo, said that "the major mission of the PLA Strategic Support Force is to give support to the combat operations so that the PLA can gain regional advantages in the astronautic war, space war, network war and electromagnetic space war and ensure smooth operations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://english.chinamil.com.cn/news-channels/pla-daily-commentary/2016-01/06/content_6846500.htm |title = Expert: PLA Strategic Support Force a key force to win wars - China Military Online |last = Yao |first = Jianing |website = english.chinamil.com.cn }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conscription and terms of service ==
Technically, military service with the PLA is obligatory for all Chinese citizens. In practice, mandatory [[military service]] has not been implemented since 1949 as the People's Liberation Army has been able to recruit sufficient numbers voluntarily.&lt;ref name=Kang2015&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.cna.com.tw/news/newsworld/201504020004-1.aspx |title = 解放軍地位高 農夫搶當兵 |trans-title = The PLA is respected, peasants are scrambling to join the army |agency=Central News Agency (Republic of China) |author=Kang Shi-ren (康世人) |date=2015-04-02 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170203162818/http://www.cna.com.tw/news/newsworld/201504020004-1.aspx |archivedate=2017-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All 18-year-old males have to register themselves with the government authorities, in a way similar to the [[Selective Service System]] of the United States. In practice, registering does not mean that the person doing so must join the People's Liberation Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://mil.huanqiu.com/china/2016-08/9258138.html |title = 适龄男青年要依法兵役登记 不登记可能无法贷款 |trans-title = The men in the right age should register for the draft.Those un-registered may not apply loan.) |newspaper = Sichuan Daily (四川日报) |date=2016-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 55 of the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]] prescribes [[conscription]] by stating: "It is a sacred duty of every citizen of the People's Republic of China to defend his or her motherland and resist invasion. It is an honoured obligation of the citizens of the People's Republic of China to perform [[military service]] and to join the [[militia]] forces."&lt;ref&gt;
[[s:Constitution of the People's Republic of China|Constitution of the People's Republic of China]]
&lt;/ref&gt; The 1984 Military Service Law spells out the legal basis of conscription, describing military service as a duty for "all citizens without distinction of race... and religious creed". This law has not been amended since it came into effect. Technically, those 18–22 years of age enter selective compulsory military service, with a 24-month service obligation. In reality, numbers of registering personals are enough to support all military posts in China, creating so-called "volunteer conscription".&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.xinhuanet.com/politics/2017-01/11/c_1120290676.htm |title = 今年征兵准备工作全面展开 国防部征兵办公室下发通知确保高质量完成征兵任务 (The Preparation of Conscription in This Year Has Begun.

Residents of the [[special administrative regions of China|Special administrative regions]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], are exempted from joining the military.

== Military intelligence ==

=== Joint Staff Department ===
The [[Joint Staff Department of the Central Military Commission|Joint Staff Department]] carries out staff and operational functions for the PLA and had major responsibility for implementing military modernisation plans. Headed by chief of general staff, the department serves as the headquarters for the entire PLA and contained directorates for the five armed services: Ground Forces, Air Force, Navy, Strategic Force and Support Forces. The Joint Staff Department included functionally organised subdepartments for [[artillery]], [[armour]]ed units, engineering, [[military operation|operations]], [[military training|training]], [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]], [[mobilisation]], [[surveying]], [[communications]], [[quartermaster]] services, and politics.

Navy Headquarters controlled the [[North Sea Fleet]], [[East Sea Fleet]], and [[South Sea Fleet]]. Air Force Headquarters generally exercised control through the commanders of the five theater commands. [[Nuclear force]]s were directly subordinate to the Joint Staff Department through the Strategic Forces commander and political commissar. Conventional main, regional, and [[militia]] units were controlled administratively by the military region commanders, but the Joint Staff Department in Beijing could assume direct operational control of any main-force unit at will. Thus, broadly speaking, the Joint Staff Department exercises operational control of the main forces, and the military region commanders controlled the regional forces and, indirectly, the militia. The post of principal intelligence official in the top leadership of the Chinese military has been taken up by a number of people of several generations, from Li Kenong in the 1950s to Xiong Guangkai in the late 1990s; and their public capacity has always been assistant to the deputy chief of staff or assistant to the chief of staff.

Ever since the CPC officially established the system of "major military regions" for its army in the 1950s, the [[intelligence agencies]] inside the Army have, after going through several major evolutions, developed into the present three major military intelligence setups:
# The central level is composed of the Second and Third Departments under the Joint Staff Headquarters and the Liaison Department under the Political Work Department.
# At the major military regions intelligence activities consist of the Second Bureau established at the same level as the Operation Department under the headquarters, and the Liaison Department established under the Political Work Department.
# The third system includes a number of communications stations directly established in the garrison areas of all the major military regions by the Third Department of the Joint Staff Headquarters.

The Second Bureau under the headquarters and the Liaison Department under the Political Department of major military regions are only subjected to the "professional leadership" of their "counterpart" units under the Central Military Commission and are still considered the direct subordinate units of the major military region organizationally. Those entities whose names include the word "institute", all [[research institute]]s under the charge of the Second and the Third Departments of the Joint Staff Headquarters, including other research organs inside the Army, are at least of the establishment size of the full regimental level. Among the deputy commanders  of a major [[Theater commands of the People's Liberation Army|Theater command]] in China, there is always one who is assigned to take charge of intelligence work, and the intelligence agencies under his charge are directly affiliated to the headquarters and the political department of the military region.

The Conference on Strengthening Intelligence Work held from 3 September 1996 – 18 September 1996 at the Xishan Command Center of the [[Ministry of State Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of State Security]] and the General Staff Department. Chi Haotian delivered a report entitled "Strengthen Intelligence Work in a New International Environment To Serve the Cause of Socialist Construction." The report emphasised the need to strengthen the following four aspects of intelligence work:
* Efforts must be made to strengthen understanding of the special nature and role of intelligence work, as well as understanding of the close relationship between strengthening intelligence work on the one hand, and of the [[Four Modernizations]] of the motherland, the reunification of the motherland, and opposition to hegemony and power politics on the other.
* The United States and the West have all along been engaged in infiltration, intervention, sabotage, and intelligence gathering against China on the political, economic, military, and ideological fronts. The response must strengthen the struggle against their infiltration, intervention, sabotage, and intelligence gathering.
* Consolidating intelligence departments and training a new generation of intelligence personnel who are politically reliable, honest and upright in their ways, and capable of mastering professional skills, the art of struggle, and advanced technologies.
* Strengthening the work of organising intelligence in two international industrial, commercial, and financial ports—Hong Kong and Macau.

Although the four aspects emphasised by Chi Haotian appeared to be defensive measures, they were in fact both defensive and offensive in nature.

==== Second Department ====
{{unreferenced section |date = March 2014 }}

The Second Department of the Joint Staff Headquarters is responsible for collecting [[military intelligence]]. Activities include [[military attaché]]s at Chinese embassies abroad, clandestine special agents sent to foreign countries to collect military information, and the analysis of information publicly published in foreign countries.

The Second Department oversees military [[human intelligence (espionage)|human intelligence]] (HUMINT) collection, widely exploits [[Open Source Intelligence|open source (OSINT) materials]], fuses HUMINT, [[signals intelligence]] (SIGINT), and [[imagery intelligence]] data, and disseminates finished intelligence products to the CMC and other consumers. Preliminary fusion is carried out by the Second Department's Analysis Bureau which mans the National Watch Center, the focal point for national-level indications and warning. In-depth analysis is carried out by regional bureaus. Although traditionally the Second Department of the [[Joint Staff Department of the Central Military Commission|Joint Staff Department]] was responsible for military intelligence, it is beginning to increasingly focus on [[Science, technology and society|scientific and technological]] intelligence in the military field, following the example of Russian agencies in stepping up the work of collecting scientific and technological information.

The research institute under the Second Department of the Joint Staff Headquarters is publicly known as the Institute for International Strategic Studies; its internal classified publication "Foreign Military Trends" (《外军动态》, ''Wai Jun Dongtai'') is published every 10 days and transmitted to units at the division level.

The PLA Institute of International Relations at [[Nanjing]] comes under the Second Department of the [[Joint Staff Department of the Central Military Commission|Joint Staff Department]] and is responsible for training [[military attaché]]s, assistant military attachés and associate military attachés as well as [[secret agent]]s to be posted abroad. It also supplies officers to the military intelligence sections of various [[military region]]s and [[group armies]]. The Institute was formed from the PLA "793" [[Foreign Language]] Institute, which moved from [[Zhangjiakou]] after the Cultural Revolution and split into two institutions at [[Luoyang]] and [[Nanjing]].

The Institute of International Relations was known in the 1950s as the School for Foreign Language Cadres of the Central Military Commission, with the current name being used since 1964. The training of intelligence personnel is one of several activities at the Institute. While all graduates of the [[Moscow Institute of International Relations]] were employed by the [[KGB]], only some graduates of the Beijing Institute of International Relations are employed by the Ministry of State Security. The former Institute of International Relations, since been renamed the [[Foreign Affairs College]], is under the administration of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] and is not involved in secret intelligence work. The former Central Military Commission foreign language school had foreign faculty members who were either Communist Party sympathizers or were members of foreign communist parties. But the present Institute of International Relations does not hire foreign teachers, to avoid the danger that its students might be recognised when sent abroad as clandestine agents.

Those engaged in professional work in military academies under the Second Department of the Joint  Staff Headquarters usually have a chance to go abroad, either for advanced studies or as [[military officer]]s working in the military attaché's office of Chinese embassies in foreign countries. People working in the military attaché's office of embassies are usually engaged in collecting military information under the cover of "military diplomacy". As long as they refrain from directly [[subversion (politics)|subversive]] activities, they are considered as well-behaved "military diplomats".

Some bureaus under the Second Department which are responsible for espionage in different regions, of which the First Bureau is responsible for collecting information in the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and [[Macau]], and also in [[Taiwan]]. Agents are dispatched by the Second Department to companies and other local corporations to gain cover.

The "Autumn Orchid" intelligence group assigned to Hong Kong and Macau in the mid-1980s mostly operated in the mass media, political, industrial, commercial, and religious circles, as well as in universities and colleges. The "Autumn Orchid" intelligence group was mainly responsible for the following three tasks:
* Finding out and keeping abreast of the political leanings of officials of the Hong Kong and Macau governments, as well as their views on major issues, through social contact with them and through information provided by them.
* Keeping abreast of the developments of foreign governments' political organs in Hong Kong, as well as of foreign financial, industrial, and commercial organisations.
* Finding out and having a good grasp of the local media's sources of information on political, military, economic, and other developments on the mainland, and deliberately releasing false political or military information to the media to test the outside response.

The "Autumn Orchid" intelligence group was awarded a Citation for Merit, Second Class, in December 1994. It was further awarded another Citation for Merit, Second Class, in 1997. Its current status is not publicly known. During the 2008 Chinese New Year celebration CCTV held for Chinese diplomatic establishments, the head of the Second Department of the Joint Headquarters was revealed for the first time to the public: the current head was [[Major General]] Yang Hui (杨晖).

==== Third Department ====
{{unreferenced section |date = March 2014}}

The Third Department of the Joint Staff Department is responsible for monitoring the [[telecommunications]] of foreign armies and producing finished intelligence based on the military information collected.

The [[military communications|communications]] stations established by the Third Department of the Joint Staff Headquarters are not subject to the [[jurisdiction]] of the provincial [[military district]] and the major [[military region]] of where they are based. The communications stations are entirely the agencies of the Third Department of the Joint Staff Headquarters which have no affiliations to the provincial military district and the military region of where they are based. The personnel composition, budgets, and establishment of these communications stations are entirely under the jurisdiction of the Third Department of the General PLA General Staff Headquarters, and are not related at all with local troops.

China maintains the most extensive [[SIGINT]] network of all the countries in the Asia-Pacific region. As of the late 1990s, SIGINT systems included several dozen ground stations, half a dozen ships, truck-mounted systems, and airborne systems. Third Department headquarters is in the vicinity of the GSD First Department (Operations Department), AMS, and NDU complex in the hills northwest of the [[Summer Palace]]. As of the late 1990s, the Third Department was allegedly manned by approximately 20,000 personnel, with most of their linguists trained at the Luoyang Institute of Foreign Languages.

Ever since the 1950s, the Second and Third Departments of the Joint Staff Headquarters have established a number of institutions of secondary and [[higher education|higher learning]] for bringing up "special talents." The PLA Foreign Language Institute at [[Luoyang]] comes under the Third Department of the Joint Staff Department and is responsible for training [[foreign language]] officers for the monitoring of foreign [[military intelligence]]. The Institute was formed from the PLA "793" Foreign Language Institute, which moved from Zhangjiakou after the Cultural Revolution and split into two institutions at Luoyang and Nanjing.

Though the distribution order they received upon graduation indicated the "Joint Staff Headquarters", many of the graduates of these schools found themselves being sent to all parts of the country, including remote and uninhabited backward mountain areas. The reason is that the monitoring and control stations under the Third Department of the PLA General Staff Headquarters are scattered in every corner of the country.

The communications stations located in the [[Shenzhen]] base of the [[PLA Hong Kong Garrison]] started their work long ago. In normal times, these two communications stations report directly to the Central Military Commission and the Joint Staff Headquarters. Units responsible for co-ordination are the communications stations established in the garrison provinces of the military regions by the Third Department of the PLA General Staff Headquarters.

By taking direct command of [[military communications]] stations based in all parts of the country, the CPC Central Military Commission and the Joint Staff Headquarters can not only ensure a successful [[interception]] of enemy [[radio communications]], but can also make sure that none of the wire or [[wireless communication]]s and contacts among major military regions can escape the detection of these communications stations, thus effectively attaining the goal of imposing a direct supervision and control over all major [[military region]]s, all provincial [[military district]]s, and all [[group armies]].

===== Monitoring stations =====
{{unreferenced section |date = March 2014}}

China's main [[SIGINT]] effort is in the Third Department of the Joint Staff Department of the Central Military Commission, with additional capabilities, primarily domestic, in the Ministry of State Security (MSS). SIGINT stations, therefore, are scattered through the country, for domestic as well as international interception. Prof. Desmond Ball, of the [[Australian National University]], described the largest stations as the main Technical Department SIGINT net control station on the northwest outskirts of Beijing, and the large complex near [[Lake Khanka|Lake Kinghathu]] in the extreme northeast corner of China.

As opposed to other [[Great power|major powers]], China focuses its SIGINT activities on its region rather than the world. Ball wrote, in the eighties, that China had several dozen SIGINT stations aimed at Russia, Japan, [[Taiwan]], Southeast Asia and India, as well as internally. Of the stations apparently targeting Russia, there are sites at Jilemutu and [[Jixi]] in the northeast, and at [[Erenhot|Erlian]] and [[Hami City|Hami]] near the Mongolian border. Two Russian-facing sites in [[Xinjiang]], at [[Qitai]] and [[Korla]] may be operated jointly with resources from the US [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s Office of SIGINT Operations, probably focused on missile and space activity. Other stations aimed at South and Southeast Asia are on a net controlled by [[Chengdu]], Sichuan. There is a large facility at Dayi, and, according to Ball, "numerous" small posts along the Indian border. Other significant facilities are located near [[Shenyang]], near [[Jinan]] and in [[Nanjing]] and Shanghai. Additional stations are in the [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]] military districts opposite Taiwan.

On [[Hainan Island]], near [[Vietnam]], there is a naval SIGINT facility that monitors the South China sea, and a ground station targeting US and Russian satellites. China also has ship and aircraft platforms in this area, under the [[South Sea Fleet]] headquarters at [[Zhanjiang]] immediately north of the island. Targeting here seems to have an [[ELINT]] as well as [[COMINT]] flavor. There are also truck-mounted mobile ground systems, as well as ship, aircraft, and limited satellite capability. There are at least 10 intelligence-gathering [[Auxiliaries|auxiliary]] vessels.

As of the late nineties, the Chinese did not appear to be trying to monitor the [[United States Pacific Command]] to the same extent as does Russia. In future, this had depended, in part, on the status of Taiwan.

==== Fourth Department ====
{{Main article|Fourth Department of the General Staff Headquarters Department}}

The Fourth Department (ECM and Radar) of the Joint Staff Headquarters Department has the [[electronic intelligence]] (ELINT) portfolio within the PLA's [[SIGINT]] apparatus. This department is responsible for [[electronic countermeasures]], requiring them to collect and maintain data bases on electronic signals. 25 ELINT receivers are the responsibility of the Southwest Institute of Electronic Equipment (SWIEE). Among the wide range of SWIEE ELINT products is a new KZ900 airborne ELINT pod. The GSD 54th Research Institute supports the ECM Department in development of digital ELINT signal processors to analyse parameters of radar pulses.

=== Liaison Department ===
The [[Political Work Department of the Central Military Commission|Political Work Department]] maintains the [[Communist Party of China|CPC]] structure that exists at every level of the PLA. It is responsible for overseeing the political education, indoctrination and discipline that is a prerequisite for advancement within the PLA. The PWD controls the internal prison system of the PLA. The International Liaison Department of the Political Work Department is publicly known as the "China Association for International Friendly Contacts". The department prepares political and economic information for the reference of the Political Bureau. The department conducts ideological and political work on foreign armies, explaining China's policies, and disintegrate enemy armies by dampening their morale. It is also tasked with instigating rebellions and disloyalty within the Taiwan military and other foreign militaries.

The Liaison Office has dispatched agents to infiltrate Chinese-funded companies and private institutions in Hong Kong. Their mission is [[counter-espionage]], monitoring their own agents, and preventing and detecting foreign intelligence services buying off Chinese personnel.

=== Special forces ===
{{Main article|People's Liberation Army Special Operations Forces}}

{{unreferenced section |date = March 2014}}

China's special ground force is called PLASF ([[People's Liberation Army Special Operations Forces]]). It includes highly trained soldiers, a team of commander, assistant commander, sniper, spotter, machine-gun supporter, bomber, and a pair of assault group. China's counterterrorist unit is drawn from the police force rather than the military. The name changes frequently, but as of this writing, it is known as the Immediate Action Unit (IAU). The Chinese Army fields large number of special operations groups and would appear to have a vast pool of manpower to choose from. However, it is believed that any significant terrorist activity within Chinese borders would draw the attention of the IAU.

China has reportedly developed a force capable of carrying out long-range air-borne operations, long-range reconnaissance, and amphibious operations. Formed in China's Guangzhou military region and known by the nickname "Sword of Southern China", the force supposedly receives army, air force and naval training, including flight training, and is equipped with "hundreds of high-tech devices", including global-positioning satellite systems. All of the force's officers have completed military staff colleges, and 60 percent are said to have university degrees. Soldiers are reported to be cross-trained in various specialties, and training is supposed to encompass a range of operational environments. It is far from clear whether this unit is considered operational by the Chinese. It is also not clear how such a force would be employed. Among the missions mentioned were "responding to contingencies in various regions" and "cooperating with other services in attacks on islands". According to the limited reporting, the organisation appears to be in a phase of testing and development and may constitute an experimental unit. While no size for the force has been revealed, there have been Chinese media claims that "over 4,000 soldiers of the force are all-weather and versatile fighters and parachutists who can fly airplanes and drive auto vehicles and motor boats".{{Citation needed |date = December 2009}}

===Sea-based nuclear weapons===
The Chinese navy has developed [[Type 094 submarine|Type 094]] [[ballistic missile submarine]], open source satellite imagery has shown that at least 4 of these have been completed. This submarine will be capable of carrying 12 of the longer ranged [[JL-2]] with a range of approximately 7500&amp;nbsp;km. China is also developing the more advanced [[Type 096 submarine]], able to carry up to 24 [[JL-3]] ballistic missiles each. The [[PRC]] is interested in augmenting its [[ICBM]] forces with [[SSBN]]s to enhance its comprehensive nuclear deterrent force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chinapower.csis.org/ssbn/|title=Does China have an effective sea-based nuclear deterrent?|publisher=ChinaPowerCSIS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nuclear deterrent patrols commenced in December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Richard D., Jr.|title=China advances sea- and land-based nuclear deterrent capabilities|journal=Jane's Defence Weekly|volume=53|issue=6|date=16 December 2015|publisher=Jane's Information Group|location=Surrey, UK|issn=0265-3818}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Weapons and equipment ==
According to the [[United States Defense Department]], China is developing kinetic-energy weapons, high-powered lasers, high-powered [[microwave|microwave weapon]]s, [[Particle beam#Particle beams as weapons|particle-beam weapon]]s, and [[electromagnetic pulse]] weapons with its increase of military fundings.&lt;ref&gt;The Standard, 5 March 2008, Volume 1, No. 134, Major jump in military spending, Alarm raised over cyber, space advance, ''the Pentagon said in a report. ... "The PLA is also exploring satellite jammers, kinetic-energy weapons, high-powered lasers, high-powered microwave weapons, particle-beam weapons, and electromagnetic pulse weapons for counterspace application", it said, adding it was not clear if the cyber intrusions were backed by the military.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The PLA has said of reports that its modernisation is dependent on sales of advanced technology from American allies "Some people have politicized China's normal commercial cooperation with foreign countries, smearing our reputation." These contributions include advanced European diesel engines for Chinese warships, military helicopter designs from Eurocopter, French anti-submarine sonars and helicopters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/12/19/us-breakout-submarines-special-report-idINBRE9BI0PD20131219 |title = Chinese military's secret to success: European engineering |last1 = Lague |first1 = David |date = 19 December 2013 |agency = Reuters  |accessdate = 20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian technology for the [[Houbei class missile boat]],&lt;ref&gt;Lague, David.

According to the [[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]]'s data, China became the world's third largest exporter of major arms in 2010–14, an increase of 143 percent from the period 2005–2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = The United States leads upward trend in arms exports, Asian and Gulf states arms imports up, says SIPRI |url = http://www.sipri.org/media/pressreleases/2015/at-march-2015 |website = sipri.org |publisher = [[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]] (SIPRI) |accessdate = 18 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; China's share of global arms exports hence increased from 3 to 5 percent. China supplied major arms to 35 states in 2010–14. A significant percentage (just over 68 percent) of Chinese exports went to three countries: Pakistan, Bangladesh and Myanmar. China also exported major arms to 18 African states. Examples of China's increasing global presence as an arms supplier in 2010–14 included deals with Venezuela for armoured vehicles and transport and trainer aircraft, with Algeria for three frigates, with Indonesia for the supply of hundreds of anti-ship missiles and with Nigeria for the supply of a number of unmanned combat aerial vehicles. Following rapid advances in its arms industry, China has become less dependent on arms imports, which decreased by 42 percent between 2005–2009 and 2010–14. Russia accounted for 61 percent of Chinese arms imports, followed by France with 16 percent and Ukraine with 13 per cent. Helicopters formed a major part of Russian and French deliveries, with the French designs produced under licence in China. Over the years, China has struggled to design and produce effective engines for combat and transport vehicles. It continued to import large numbers of engines from Russia and Ukraine in 2010–14 for indigenously designed combat, advanced trainer and transport aircraft, and for naval ships. It also produced British-, French- and German-designed engines for combat aircraft, naval ships and armoured vehicles, mostly as part of agreements that have been in place for decades.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |title = Trends in International Arms Transfer, 2014 |url = http://books.sipri.org/product_info?c_product_id=495 |website = sipri.org |publisher = Stockholm International Peace Research Institute |accessdate = 18 March 2015 |ref = SIPRI Fact Sheet, March 2015 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150319023856/http://books.sipri.org/product_info?c_product_id=495 |archivedate = 19 March 2015 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cyberwarfare ===
{{Main article|Cyberwarfare in the People's Republic of China}}

There is a belief in the western military doctrines that the PLA have already begun engaging countries using [[cyber-warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Gorman |first = Siobhan |url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123914805204099085 |title = Electricity Grid in U.S. Penetrated By Spies |work = The Wall Street Journal |date = 8 April 2009 |accessdate = 1 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |url = http://www.foxnews.com/video2/video08.html?maven_referralObject=4258140&amp;maven_referralPlaylistId=&amp;sRevUrl=http://www.foxnews.com/ |title = Power Grid Penetrated? |publisher = Fox News Channel |date = 22 December 2009 |accessdate = 1 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been a significant increase in the number of presumed Chinese military initiated cyber events from 1999 to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first = Bryan |last = Krekel |title = Capability of the People's Republic of China to Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation |publisher = [[Northrop Grumman]] |year = 2009 |url = http://www.uscc.gov/researchpapers/2009/NorthropGrumman_PRC_Cyber_Paper_FINAL_Approved%20Report_16Oct2009.pdf |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110203052113/http://www.uscc.gov/researchpapers/2009/NorthropGrumman_PRC_Cyber_Paper_FINAL_Approved%20Report_16Oct2009.pdf |archivedate = 3 February 2011 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyberwarfare has gained recognition as a valuable technique because it is an asymmetric technique that is a part of [[Chinese Information Operations]].  As is written by two PLAGF Colonels, Qiao Liang and Wang Xiangsui, "Methods that are not characterised by the use of the force of arms, nor by the use of military power, nor even by the presence of casualties and bloodshed, are just as likely to facilitate the successful realisation of the war's goals, if not more so.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Qiao |first1=Liang |last2=Wang |first2 = Xiangsui |title = Unrestricted Warfare |year=1999 |url = http://www.terrorism.com/documents/unrestricted.pdf |publisher = PLA Literature and Arts Publishing House via [[Foreign Broadcast Information Service]] |accessdate = 15 August 2000 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20000815214700/http://www.terrorism.com/documents/unrestricted.pdf |archivedate = 15 August 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While China has long been suspected of [[cyber spying]], on 24 May 2011 the PLA announced the existence of their cyber security squad.&lt;ref&gt;Beech, Hannah.

=== Nuclear weapons ===
{{Main article|China and weapons of mass destruction|People's Liberation Army Rocket Force}}

[[File:Medium and Intercontinental Range Ballistic Missiles.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Range of medium and intercontinental ballistic missiles (2006)]]

In 1955, China decided to proceed with a [[nuclear weapons]] program. The decision was made after the United States threatened the use of nuclear weapons against China should it take action against [[Quemoy]] and [[Matsu (islands)|Matsu]], coupled with the lack of interest of the Soviet Union for using its nuclear weapons in defence of China.

After their first [[nuclear test]] (China claims minimal Soviet assistance before 1960) on 16 October 1964, China was the first state to pledge [[no-first-use]] of nuclear weapons. On 1 July 1966, the Second Artillery Corps, as named by Premier Zhou Enlai, was formed. In 1967, China [[Chinese nuclear test No. 6|tested]] a fully functional [[hydrogen bomb]], only 32 months after China had made its first fission device. China thus produced the shortest fission-to-fusion development known in history.

China became a major international arms exporter during the 1980s. Beijing joined the Middle East arms control talks, which began in July 1991 to establish global guidelines for conventional arms transfers, and later announced that it would no longer participate because of the US decision to sell 150 [[F-16]]A/B aircraft to Taiwan on 2 September 1992.

It joined the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) in 1984 and pledged to abstain from further atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons in 1986. China acceded to the nuclear [[Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT) in 1992 and supported its indefinite and unconditional extension in 1995. [[List of nuclear weapons tests of China|Nuclear weapons tests by China]] ceased in 1996, when it signed the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]] and agreed to seek an international ban on the production of fissile nuclear weapons material.

In 1996, China committed to provide assistance to unsafeguarded nuclear facilities. China attended the May 1997 meeting of the NPT Exporters (Zangger) Committee as an observer and became a full member in October 1997. The [[Zangger Committee]] is a group which meets to list items that should be subject to IAEA inspections if exported by countries, which have, as China has, signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty. In September 1997, China issued detailed nuclear export control regulations. China began implementing regulations establishing controls over nuclear-related [[dual-use]] items in 1998. China also has decided not to engage in new nuclear co-operation with [[Iran]] (even under safeguards), and will complete existing co-operation, which is not of proliferation concern, within a relatively short period. Based on significant, tangible progress with China on nuclear nonproliferation, President [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] in 1998 took steps to bring into force the 1985 US–China Agreement on Peaceful Nuclear Cooperation.

Beijing has deployed a modest ballistic missile force, including land and sea-based intermediate-range and intercontinental ballistic missiles ([[ICBM]]s). It was estimated in 2007 that China has about 100–160 liquid fuelled ICBMs capable of striking the United States with approximately 100–150 [[IRBM]]s able to strike Russia or Eastern Europe, as well as several hundred tactical [[SRBM]]s with ranges between 300 and 600&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name="2007annualreport p19"&gt;2007 Annual Report to Congress: Military Power of the People's Republic of China. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;
Currently, the Chinese nuclear stockpile is estimated to be between 50 and 75 land and sea based ICBM's.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.defense.gov/pubs/2013_China_Report_FINAL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

China's nuclear program follows a doctrine of [[minimal deterrence]], which involves having the minimum force needed to deter an aggressor from launching a first strike. The current efforts of China appear to be aimed at maintaining a survivable nuclear force by, for example, using solid-fuelled ICBMs in silos rather than liquid-fuelled missiles. China's 2006 published deterrence policy states that they will "uphold the principles of counterattack in self-defense and limited development of nuclear weapons", but "has never entered, and will never enter into a nuclear arms race with any country". It goes on to describe that China will never undertake a first strike, or use nuclear weapons against a non-nuclear state or zone.&lt;ref name="2007annualreport p19" /&gt; US strategists, however, suggest that the Chinese position may be ambiguous, and nuclear weapons may be used both to deter conventional strikes/invasions on the Chinese mainland, or as an international political tool – limiting the extent to which other nations can coerce China politically, an inherent, often inadvertent phenomenon in international relations as regards any state with nuclear capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;2007 Annual Report to Congress: Military Power of the People's Republic of China. p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Space-based warfare ===
{{Main article|ASAT program of China}}

The PLA has deployed a number of space-based systems for military purposes, including the [[imagery intelligence]] satellite systems like the ZiYan series,&lt;ref&gt;Squadron Leader KK Nair, "Space: The Frontiers of Modern Defence", Knowledge World Publishers, New Delhi, Chapter 6, p. 123–126.&lt;/ref&gt; and the militarily designated JianBing series, synthetic aperture satellites (SAR) such as JianBing-5, [[BeiDou satellite navigation network]], and secured communication satellites with FENGHUO-1.&lt;ref&gt;Squadron Leadr KK Nair, Space:The Frontiers of Modern Defence, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

The PLA is responsible for the [[Chinese space program]]. To date, all the participants have been selected from members of the PLA Air Force. China became the third country in the world to have sent a man into space by its own means with the flight of [[Yang Liwei]] aboard the [[Shenzhou&amp;nbsp;5]] spacecraft on 15 October 2003 and the flight of [[Fei Junlong]] and [[Nie Haisheng]] aboard [[Shenzhou&amp;nbsp;6]] on 12 October 2005 and [[Zhai Zhigang]], [[Liu Boming (astronaut)|Liu Boming]], and [[Jing Haipeng]] aboard [[Shenzhou&amp;nbsp;7]] on 25 September 2008.

The PLA started the development of an anti-ballistic and anti-satellite system in the 1960s, code named Project 640, including ground-based lasers and anti-satellite missiles. On 11 January, 2007, China conducted a successful [[2007 Chinese anti-satellite missile test|test]] of an [[anti-satellite missile]], with an SC-19 class KKV.&lt;ref name="channelnewsasia.com"&gt;[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/253580/1/.html China plays down fears after satellite shot down], [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] via [[MediaCorp Channel NewsAsia|Channelnewsasia]], 20 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Its anti ballistic missile test was also successful.

The PLA has tested two types of hypersonic space vehicles, the Shenglong Spaceplane and a new one built by [[Chengdu Aircraft Corporation]]. Only a few pictures have appeared since it was revealed in late 2007. Earlier, images of the [[High-enthalpy Shock Waves Laboratory]] [[wind tunnel]] of the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences|CAS]] [[Key Laboratory of high-temperature gas dynamics]] (LHD) were published in the Chinese media. Tests with speeds up to Mach 20 were reached around 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://lhd.imech.cas.cn/kyzb/201307/t20130723_116736.html |title = 氢氧爆轰驱动激波高焓风洞 |publisher=中国科学院高温气体动力学重点实验室 |date=2005-03-17 |accessdate=2008-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Military spending in the People's Liberation Army has grown about 10 percent annually over the last 15 years.&lt;ref name="2007annualreport p25"&gt;2007 Annual Report to Congress: Military Power of the People's Republic of China. p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]], SIPRI, estimated China's military expenditure for 2013 to $188.5&amp;nbsp;billion US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = SIPRI Military Expenditure Database |url = http://www.sipri.org/research/armaments/milex/milex_database |website = sipri.org |publisher=Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, SIPRI |accessdate = 18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; China's military budget for 2014 according to IHS Jane's, a defence industry consulting and analysis company, will be $148&amp;nbsp;billion US,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Ramzy |first=Austin |url = http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/feb/4/middle-east-russia-and-china-fuel-2014-global-defe/ |title = Middle East, Russia and China fuel 2014 global defense spending surge: report |work = The Washington Times |date = 4 February 2014 |accessdate = 24 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the [[List of countries by military expenditures|second largest]] in the world. The [[United States military budget]] for 2014 in comparison, is $574.9&amp;nbsp;billion US.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Lawrence |first = Dune |url = http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/03/china-to-ramp-up-military-spending/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=1 |title = China to Ramp Up Military Spending |work = The New York Times |date = 3 February 2014 |accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is down from a high of $664.3&amp;nbsp;billion US in 2012.  According to [[SIPRI]], China became the world's third largest exporter of major arms in 2010–14, an increase of 143 per cent from the period 2005–2009. China supplied major arms to 35 states in 2010–14. A significant percentage (just over 68 per cent) of Chinese exports went to three countries: Pakistan, Bangladesh and Myanmar. China also exported major arms to 18 African states. Examples of China's increasing global presence as an arms supplier in 2010–14 included deals with Venezuela for armoured vehicles and transport and trainer aircraft, with Algeria for three frigates, with Indonesia for the supply of hundreds of anti-ship missiles and with Nigeria for the supply of a number of unmanned combat aerial vehicles. Following rapid advances in its domestic arms industry, China has become less dependent on arms imports, which decreased by 42 per cent between 2005–2009 and 2010–14.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; China's rise in military spending come at a time when there are tensions along the South China Sea with territorial disputes involving the Philippines, Vietnam, and Taiwan, as well as escalating tensions between China and Japan involving the disputed Diaoyu (Chinese spelling) and Senkaku (Japanese spelling) islands. Former-United States Secretary of Defense [[Robert Gates]] has urged China to be more transparent about its military capabilities and intentions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gFVKfVEoZkFhnNFrEqRsKbqkQsfA "US, China need transparent military ties: Gates."] Agence France-Presse, 30 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia-pacific/amid-development-of-stealth-fighter-aircraft-carrier-china-insists-its-military-not-a-threat/2011/06/13/AGLmKiSH_story.html "Amid development of stealth fighter, aircraft carrier, China insists its military not a threat."] Associated Press, 13 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commercial interests ==
[[File:Wuhan - No 6907 Factory of PLA of China - 4138.jpg|thumb|PLA Factory No. 6907, [[Wuhan]]. The white characters on the blue sign roughly translate to: "Secret/Classified Area, Do Not Enter Unless Invited."]]

Until the mid-1990s the PLA had extensive commercial enterprise holdings in non-military areas, particularly real estate. Almost all of these holdings were supposedly spun off in the mid-1990s. In most cases, the management of the companies remained unchanged, with the PLA officers running the companies simply retiring from the PLA to run the newly formed private holding companies.&lt;ref name=scmp1884377&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/1884377/xi-wants-pla-inc-return-its-proper-role|title=China's President Xi Jinping wants ‘PLA Inc’ to stop its song and dance, plans end for profit-making activities|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of PLA involvement in commercial enterprises began in the 1950s and 1960s. Because of the socialist [[state-owned]] system and from a desire for military self-sufficiency, the PLA created a network of enterprises such as farms, guest houses, and factories intended to financially support its own needs. One unintended side effect of the Deng-era economic reforms was that many of these enterprises became very profitable. For example, a military guest house intended for soldier recreation could be easily converted into a profitable hotel for civilian use. There were two main factors which increased PLA commercial involvement in the 1990s. One was that running profitable companies decreased the need for the state to fund the military from the [[government budget]]. The second was that in an environment where legal rules were unclear and political connections were important, PLA influence was very useful.{{Citation needed |date = October 2008}}

By the early 1990s party officials and high military officials were becoming increasingly alarmed at the military's commercial involvement for a number of reasons. The military's involvement in commerce was seen to adversely affect military readiness and spread corruption. Further, there was great concern that having an independent source of funding would lead to decreased loyalty to the party. The result of this was an effort to spin off the PLA's commercial enterprises into private companies managed by former PLA officers, and to reform military [[procurement]] from a system in which the PLA directly controls its sources of supply to a contracting system more akin to those of Western countries. The separation of the PLA from its commercial interests was largely complete by the year 2000. It was met with very little resistance, as the spinoff was arranged in such a way that few lost out.&lt;ref name=scmp1884377/&gt; The rapidly expanding [[CEFC China Energy]], that bought a $9 billion stake in [[Russia]]'s largest oil producer [[Rosneft]],&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-02/why-cefc-spent-9-billion-on-rosneft-while-seeing-30-oil-risk Why an Enigmatic Chinese Company Just Spent $9 Billion on a Stake in Rosneft]".

== Anthem and insignia ==
{{listen |filename=March of the PLA.ogg|title=Military Anthem of the People's Liberation Army|description=Introduction of the March of the PLA (instrumental)}}

The military anthem of the PLA is the [[Military Anthem of the People's Liberation Army]] ({{zh |s = 中国人民解放军军歌 |t = 中國人民解放軍軍歌 |p = Zhōngguó Rénmín Jiěfàngjūn Jūngē }}). The [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] adopted the song on July 25, 1988. The lyrics of the anthem were written by [[Gong Mu]] and the music was composed by [[Zheng Lücheng]].

The PLA's insignia consists of a roundel with a red star bearing the [[Chinese character]]s for ''Eight One'', referring to the [[Nanchang uprising]] which began on August 1, 1927.

The '''''Polizia di Stato''''' ([[State Police]] or P.S.) is one of the national [[police]] forces of [[Italy]].

It is the main police force for providing police duties and it is also responsible for highway patrol (''[[autostrada|autostrade]]''), railways (''ferrovie''), airports (''aeroporti''), customs (together with the ''[[Guardia di Finanza]]'') as well as certain waterways, and assisting the local police forces.

It was a military force until 1981 when the Italian State Law 121 was passed. This converted the State Police to a civil force,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.normeinrete.it/cgi-bin/StampaFrameURN?URL=http://www.italgiure.giustizia.it/nir/lexs/1981/lexs_279127.html |title=Normeinrete - Navigazione URN |publisher=Normeinrete.it |date= |accessdate=8 September 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is in contrast to the other main police forces of Italy: the ''[[Carabinieri|Arma dei Carabinieri]]'', which is a [[military police]] ([[gendarmerie]]) force&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carabinieri.it/Internet/Multilingua/EN/InstitutionalDuties/07_EN.htm |title=Arma dei Carabinieri - Home - &gt; - EN - Institutional Duties |publisher=Carabinieri.it |date= |accessdate=8 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914131608/http://www.carabinieri.it/Internet/Multilingua/EN/InstitutionalDuties/07_EN.htm |archivedate=14 September 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carabinieri.it/Internet/Multilingua/EN/GoverningBodies/08_EN.htm |title=Arma dei Carabinieri - Home - &gt; - EN - Governing Bodies |publisher=Carabinieri.it |date= |accessdate=8 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423124124/http://www.carabinieri.it/Internet/Multilingua/EN/GoverningBodies/08_EN.htm |archivedate=23 April 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Guardia di Finanza]]'', the Italian customs and border protection police that also falls in the military corps category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gdf.it/Organizzazione/Chi_siamo/I_Compiti_del_Corpo/index.html |title=Guardia di Finanza - I Compiti del Corpo |publisher=Gdf.it |date= |accessdate=8 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Polizia di Stato'' is the principal Italian police force for the maintenance of public security and as such it is run directly from the ''Dipartimento della Pubblica Sicurezza'' (Department of Public Security), and the keeping of public order (''ordine pubblico'').

Approximately 1,500 officers are assigned to the "neighbourhood police" service, the ''Polizia di Quartiere'', which has a police presence on the streets and deters crime. Pairs of ''poliziotti'' (policemen) patrol areas of major cities on foot.

== Organization ==
The headquarters of the ''Polizia di Stato'' are in [[Rome]] and its chief is referred to as the ''Capo della Polizia'' (''Chief of the Police'') with official Rank of ''Capo della Polizia - Direttore Generale della Pubblica Sicurezza'' (''Chief of the Police - Director General of the Public Security''). The Chief of the State Police is also the Honorary President of the ''National Association of State Police'' (''Associazione Nazionale della Polizia di Stato''). Three vice chiefs/director generals report to the chief and their main functions are:
* accomplishment of the functions{{Clarify|date=December 2008}}
* planning and coordination activity
* Director of the Criminal Investigation Police

The force is organized on a regional and provincial basis.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.poliziadistato.it/articolo/960&lt;/ref&gt; The territory of the Italian republic is divided into 20 regions. They include 107 provincial commands - one each in the 14 metropolitan cities (''città metropolitane''), 80 provinces (''province''), 6 free municipal consortiums (''liberi consorzi comunali'', the formal provinces of [[Sicily]]), 4 abolished [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] provinces, 2 autonomous provinces - [[South Tyrol|Bolzano - Alto Adige]] and [[Trentino|Trento]] and 1 in Valle d'Aosta, which is an autonomous region with no provinces nor akin administrative subdivision at all. The administrative centre of each provincial command is the local headquarters, called ''Questura'' which is commanded by a ''Questore'' (that is also the highest State Police authority for the province - ''Autorità Provinciale di Pubblica Sicurezza'' - ''Provincial Authority of Public Security''). The only exceptions are the 4 recently created provinces (Monza and Brianza, Fermo and Barletta-Andria-Trani (established by law in 2004, operational since 2009) and South Sardinia (established in and operational since 2016). The territory of each province is further divided into Public Security Offices (''Commissariati di Pubblica Sicurezza''), commanded by a ''Vice Questore Aggiunto'' or ''Commissario Capo'' (''Chief Comissioner''). The lowest public security authority is the police station or precinct (''Stazione di polizia'').

===Questure===
There is a ''Questura'' in each of the 103 Italian provincial capitals. It is responsible for all the activities carried out by the Polizia di Stato within the province.

===Commissariati di Pubblica Sicurezza===
In major cities and highly populated towns there are police stations named ''Commissariati di Pubblica Sicurezza'' (''Public Security Offices''). Each ''Commissariato di Pubblica Sicurezza'' is under the Authority of a ''Questura''. Their task is to control, prevent and fight crime in their jurisdiction, and to deal with paperwork as to, among other things, requests for gun licences, passports, permits, and regularization of foreigners.

''Polizia di Quartiere'' is the ''[[community policing|Quarter Police]]''. Pairs of ''Poliziotti'' (Policemen) patrol areas of major cities on foot.

==Special operations==
About 24,000 officers, that is almost a quarter of police personnel, work within the Highway Patrol (''[[Polizia Stradale]]''), Railroad Police (''Polizia Ferroviaria''), Postal and Telecommunications Police (''Polizia Postale e delle Telecomunicazioni'') and Border and Immigration Police (''Polizia di Frontiera'').

===Highway patrol===
 {{Main|Polizia Stradale}}
The ''[[Polizia Stradale]]'', or ''PolStrada'' for short, is a [[highway patrol]] organization. PolStrada police the {{convert|7000|km|mi}} of motorways (''autostrada'') in Italy, the main highways and arterial roads outside towns. Their duties are the prevention and detection of driving offences, car accident reports, planning and carrying out of services to regulate traffic, providing escorts for road safety, protection and control of the road network, rescue operations and cooperation in the collection of traffic flow data.

===Railway Police===
The [[Railroad police|''Polizia Ferroviaria'']], or ''PolFer'' for short, ensure the security of travelers and their belongings on trains and at stations plus the safety and control of dangerous goods. Railroad Police officers patrol, in particular, long-distance and night trains, and at stations in big cities where vagrants often accumulate. ''[[Rete Ferroviaria Italiana]]'' and other ''[[Ferrovie dello Stato]]'' companies co-operate fully with the railroad police in dealing with railway security for passengers.

[[Image:PDS trucks.jpg|thumb|left|Police [[golf cart]]s at [[Venice|Venice Railway Station]]]]

===Post and telecommunications===
The ''Polizia postale e delle comunicazioni'', or ''Polizia Postale'' for short, investigates all crimes that use communications as part of its modus operandi such as computer hacking, online child pornography, credit card fraud, spreading computer viruses or software copyright violations.

===Immigration and Border Police===
To control the flow of migrants into Italy, the Department of Public Security set up the Immigration and Border Police Service (Polizia di Frontiera), to enforce regulations concerning the entry and stay of aliens in Italy. The service operates at both central and local level with many land, air and maritime border police offices.

The service is also responsible for passport control, the issuing of residence permits, as well as the prevention and control of illegal immigration. Although due to the [[Schengen Agreement]] the land borders have diasppeared, the division is still present on all borders to do systematic or random checks. In airports the border police are in charge of security (hand baggage searches are done by airport companies or private security companies but are supervised by the Polizia di Frontiera and by the [[Guardia di Finanza]]) and immigration checks.

===Mobile units===
There are 13 mobile units of "Reparto Mobile" located in the main Italian cities. These can be deployed throughout the country to maintain public order with crowd-control equipment and vehicles or perform rescue services in areas affected by natural disasters. These units employ personnel that are trained and equipped for their task.

The P.d.S.'s bomb disposal units, mounted detachments, canine units, air support squadrons and maritime and river police units all fall under the mobile unit HQ.

===Anti Terrorism Police===
[[Image:2june2006 309.jpg|thumb| Photo of Army Parade in [[Rome]], 2 June 2006, [[Republic Day]]. NOCS special groups]]
The Anti Terrorism Police is a specialist body made up of the Central Directorate for the Anti Terrorism Police and of the Branches for ''General Investigations and Special Operations Division'' ([[DIGOS]] - ''Divisione Investigazioni Generali e Operazioni Speciali''), located in the ''questure'' at the local level. The Directorate for the Anti Terrorism Police has two departments: one is mainly responsible for information collection and analysis while the other develops and coordinates investigations aimed at preventing and fighting terrorism. The ''[[Nucleo Operativo Centrale di Sicurezza]]'' (Central Operational Core of Security) is the State Police’s elite [[police tactical unit]].

==Training==
Recruit training is carried out at the police academy and at an advanced school for senior police officers. There are schools for basic training of cadet officers and technical operators, for teaching police specialties, for instructors, pilots, dog handlers and mounted police officers and the community police school.

==Weapons==
The standard [[service pistol]] of the ''Polizia di Stato'' is the [[Beretta 92|Beretta Model 92FS]]; other sidearms might be made available to the Police personnel according to necessities and assignments. In addition, a [[Beretta M12|Beretta PM-12S]] [[sub-machine gun]] is issued to every squad car. Other firearms, such as the [[Beretta AR70/90|Beretta 70/90 assault weapons system]], [[Heckler &amp; Koch MP5]] sub-machine guns and [[Benelli (firearms)|Benelli shotguns]] are in service with the corps and can either be issued to the general personnel according to particular necessities or to the specialties the officers are assigned to. A [[40mm grenade]] launcher, the [[Heckler &amp; Koch HK69A1|GL-40/90]], manufactured by [[Franchi (firearms)|Luigi Franchi S.p.A.]] under license from Heckler &amp; Koch of Germany is the standard issue weapon for [[riot control]] operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siulproma.com/pdf/circolari/2009/Circ._Armi_in_uso_alla_Polizia_di_Stato.pdf |work=Italian Ministry of Interior |title=Decree n° 559/A/1/ORG/DIP.GP/14 of March 6, 2009, concerning weapons and equipment in use with the Italian National Police |language=Italian |accessdate=August 25, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716075641/http://www.siulproma.com/pdf/circolari/2009/Circ._Armi_in_uso_alla_Polizia_di_Stato.pdf |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Red Eyebrows''' ({{zh|c=赤眉|p='''Chìméi'''}}) was one of the two major agrarian rebellion movements against [[Wang Mang]]'s short-lived [[Xin dynasty]], the other being [[Lülin]]. It was so named because the rebels painted their eyebrows red.&lt;ref name="Hinsch2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hinsch|first=Bret|title=Women in Early Imperial China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ayHkR_fs24C&amp;pg=PA102|date=16 August 2010|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=978-0-7425-6824-2|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rebellion, initially active in the modern [[Shandong]] and northern [[Jiangsu]] regions, eventually led to Wang Mang's downfall by draining his resources, allowing Liu Xuan ([[Gengshi Emperor]]), leader of the Lülin, to overthrow Wang and temporarily reestablish an incarnation of the [[Han dynasty]].  The Red Eyebrows later overthrew Gengshi Emperor and placed their own Han descendant puppet, teenage Emperor [[Liu Penzi]],&lt;ref name="han"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; on the throne, who ruled briefly until the Chimei leaders' incompetence in ruling the territories under their control (which matched their brilliance on the battlefield) caused the people to rebel against them, forcing them to retreat and attempt to return home.  When their path was blocked by the army of [[Liu Xiu]]'s (Emperor Guangwu) newly established Eastern Han regime, they surrendered to him.

== Rise and first rebellion ==
Circa 17 AD, due to Wang Mang's incompetence in ruling—particularly in his implementation of his land reform policy—and a major [[Yellow River]] flood affecting the modern Shandong and northern Jiangsu regions, the people who could no longer subsist on farming were forced into rebellion to try to survive. The rebellions were numerous and fractured.  Two key examples are discussed below.

=== Mother Lü ===
The case of [[Mother Lü]] was a highly unusual one.  Her son was a minor official at the Haiqu county (海曲, in modern [[Rizhao]], [[Shandong]]) government, who was accused of a minor offence and executed by the county magistrate.  Mother Lü, who was a substantial landowner, sold off her property and used the proceeds to befriend poor young men. When she gathered thousands, she stormed the county seat in the year 17 and killed the magistrate to avenge her son's death.  She then led her men to the sea, but died soon afterwards.&lt;ref name="xin"/&gt;

=== Fan Chong ===
[[Fan Chong]] (樊崇, who would eventually become the leader of the Red Eyebrows, albeit in a collective leadership) had his own rebellion in 18, also in the Ju and Langya counties (near modern [[Rizhao]] region). He used [[Mount Tai]] as his base, and he was able to gather about 10,000 men.  He soon entered into an alliance with other rebel leaders Pang An (逄安), Xu Xuan (徐宣), Xie Lu (謝祿), and Yang Yin (楊音), pooling resources with them, and they soon became powerful and unstoppable for the local governments.&lt;ref name="xin"/&gt;

=== Joining of the forces ===
[[File:Dahuting Tomb mural, cavalry and chariots, Eastern Han Dynasty.jpg|thumb|400px|A mural showing [[Horses in East Asian warfare|chariots and cavalry]], from the Dahuting Tomb (Chinese: 打虎亭汉墓, Pinyin: ''Dahuting Han mu'') of the late [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] (25-220 AD), located in [[Zhengzhou]], Henan province, China]]
In 19, at the behest of his official Tian Kuang (田況), Wang Mang oddly reacted to the agrarian rebellions by raising taxes.  This only aggravated the agrarian rebels.  In 21, Wang sent vice generals Jing Shang (景尚) and Wang Dang (王黨) to try to put down the rebellions, but Jing and Wang's soldiers were so lacking in military discipline that they further angered the populace which had not rebelled, which caused them to join or help the rebels in greater earnest.  Tian, who had earlier aggravated the rebellions, however, had some success against them, and he advocated a policy where the villagers would be evacuated to the cities to trap the rebels into attacking fortifications.  Wang, who by this point had distrusted Tian due to his military successes, refused and summoned him back to the capital [[Chang'an]].

About this time, Mother Lü died, and her followers joined forces with Fan Chong's forces.

It should be noted that by this point, Fan and the other rebel leaders still lacked any real political ambition—even as they were showing genuine military abilities.  The only rules of law that they had among the rebels was that one who murders would die, and one who wounds would be responsible for the care of the victim until he or she heals.  The only titles for the rebel leaders were "county educator" (三老, ''sanlao''), "county clerk" (從事, ''congshi''), and "sheriff" (卒史, ''zushi'') -- not more grandiose titles as "general" or "prince".

=== Confrontation with Xin forces ===
By 22, the forces that Jing and Wang led against Fan and other rebel generals were in shambles, and in 22, Fan killed Jing in battle.

Wang Mang reacted by sending two of his senior generals, Wang Kuang (王匡) and Lian Dan (廉丹) with a massive (100,000+ men) regular force, against these rebels.  Fan and the other rebel leaders, concerned that during battles it would become impossible to tell friend or foe, ordered that their men color their eyebrows red—and this is where the name Chimei (which literally means "red eyebrows") came from.

Wang and Lian, while capable generals on the battlefield, also failed to maintain proper military discipline.  This led to a famous lament by the people victimized by their forces:

:''I'd rather meet the Chimei than the ''Taishi'' (太師, Wang's title).  The ''Taishi'' is relatively mild, but ''Gengshi'' (更始, Lian's title -- should not be confused with Liu Xuan's title) wants to kill me!''

In winter 22, Wang and Lian had some successes against the Chimei leader Suolu Hui (索盧恢), capturing the city of Wuyan (無鹽, in modern [[Tai'an]], [[Shandong]]).  Rather than allowing their forces to rest, however, Wang decided to attack the Chimei stronghold of Liang (梁, in modern [[Shangqiu]], [[Henan]]), and Lian reluctantly attacked Liang with him.  At the battle of Chengchang (成昌, in modern [[Tai'an]], [[Shandong]]), the tired Xin forces were defeated by the Chimei and collapsed.  Lian died in battle and Wang fled without his troops.  This ended any serious attempt by Xin forces against the Chimei, as Xin would soon be confronted with the even closer Lülin threat, which would capture Chang'an in 23 and kill Wang Mang, ending the Xin Dynasty and placing Gengshi Emperor on the throne.

== Temporary submission to Gengshi Emperor ==
After Wang Mang's death, the entire empire largely, at least nominally, submitted to Gengshi Emperor as the legitimately restored Han emperor.  Gengshi Emperor temporarily placed his capital at [[Luoyang]], and he sent diplomats to try to persuade Chimei generals to submit as well.  Fan Chong and the other key generals agreed, and 20 odd Chimei generals went to Luoyang and were made marquesses.  However, they were not given any actual [[marches]], and, seeing that their men were about to disband, they fled from Luoyang, back to their then-base of [[Puyang]].  The strategist Liu Lin (劉林) suggested to Liu Xiu, then a key general of Gengshi Emperor's, to break the Yellow River levee and destroy the Chimei by that manner, but Liu Xiu refused.

== Second rebellion and demise ==
=== Campaign against Chang'an ===
By late 24, while Chimei was strong militarily, the soldiers were fatigued from all of the wars and wanted to return home.  Fan and the other leaders concluded that in order to keep them together, a bigger goal needed to be set.  They therefore set their eyes on Gengshi Emperor's regime, which by then had relocated to Chang'an.  The Chimei forces were divided into two armies, one led by Fan and Pang, targeting Wu Gate (武關, in modern [[Shangluo]], [[Shaanxi]]), and the other led by Xu, Xie, and Yang, targeting Luhun Gate (陸渾關, in modern [[Luoyang]], [[Henan]]), but both aiming for Chang'an.

In spring 25, the two armies rejoined at Hongnong (弘農, in modern [[Sanmenxia]], [[Henan]]) and defeated a major general of Gengshi Emperor's, Su Mao (蘇茂).  By this point the Chimei had grown to about 300,000 men.  Gengshi Emperor's generals wanted to abandon Chang'an and head back to their home territory in modern southern [[Henan]] and northern [[Hubei]], but Gengshi Emperor refused.

About this time, after being urged to do so by priests of [[Liu Zhang (Han prince)|Liu Zhang]] (Prince Jing of Chengyang whose principality many Chimei men came from and who was worshipped as a god after his death in 177 BC) the Chimei leaders seriously considered the idea of finding one of Liu Zhang's descendants and making him emperor to inherit the Han throne.  They found three of Liu Zhang's male descendants among their army, and, after drawing lots, they made one of them, the 15-year-old [[Liu Penzi]], emperor—but the new "emperor" had no real power and continued to serve as a cattleman in the army.&lt;ref name="han"/&gt;&lt;ref name="xin"/&gt;

In autumn 25, Chimei forces captured Chang'an, and Gengshi Emperor fled, being only followed by several loyal followers, including Liu Zhi (劉祉) the Prince of Dingtao and Liu Gong (劉恭) the Marquess of Shi—who, incidentally, was Liu Penzi's older brother.  He soon surrendered and, under intercession by Liu Gong, was made the Prince of Changsha.&lt;ref name="xin"/&gt;

=== Loss of popular support ===
Meanwhile, Emperor Penzi was installed on the Han throne in Chang'an.  Initially, the people of the Guanzhong (關中, modern central [[Shaanxi]]) region submitted and offered tributes—and were surprised when the Chimei soldiers continuously robbed them on the way to Chang'an. The locals soon resumed maintaining and defending their outposts. They also started to look forward to Liu Xiu, who by then had declared himself as an emperor as well (establishing the Eastern Han Dynasty), and his general [[Deng Yu]], whose forces were then stationed nearby but not confronting the Chimei forces, content to consolidate his control over the Commanderies of Shang, Beidi, and Anding (modern northern [[Shaanxi]] and eastern [[Gansu]]) and to wait for the Chimei to collapse by themselves.

The people of Chang'an, under direct Chimei rule, began to yearn for the return of Gengshi Emperor.  In response, the Chimei general Xie Lu, who was in charge of Gengshi Emperor at that time, strangled him. Liu Gong hid Gengshi Emperor's body and prepared it for eventual burial.&lt;ref name="xin"/&gt;

In 26, Liu Gong, seeing the dangers of the situation for his brother the emperor, decided to make one attempt to either put the situation under control or disengage his brother from the mess.  At the New Year's Day imperial gathering, Liu Gong first spoke and asked that Emperor Penzi be allowed to yield the throne, and Emperor Penzi jumped off the throne, took the imperial seal off himself, and spoke while crying:

:''Now there is an emperor, but everyone continues to act as robbers. The people hate us and do not trust us. This is because you chose the wrong [[Emperor of China|Son of Heaven]]. Please return my body to me.  But if you want to kill me to divert blame, then I must die.''

Fan and the other leaders were ashamed, and they left their seats and bowed down to Emperor Penzi, apologizing for their failures. They physically forced Emperor Penzi back onto the throne and put the imperial seal back onto him. For weeks after the incident, the generals restrained their soldiers from unlawful acts, and the people praised Emperor Penzi as a merciful and brilliant emperor.  However, the lawlessness returned before long. Soon, the food supplies were completely depleted, and the Chimei forces burned many Chang'an palaces and other buildings and pillaged the city, then marched west into the modern eastern Gansu region.

=== Flight back east and collapse ===
In autumn 26, The Chimei forces attacked the territory held by the regional warlord Wei Xiao (隗囂), but were repelled by Wei.  At this time, they suffered from a sudden cold spell that froze many soldiers to death.  They headed back east and reentered Chang'an and engaged in a series of battles with Deng and, despite their reduced strength at this time, continued to defeat Deng regularly.  The wars led to a severe famine in the Guangzhong region, which affected not only the people of the region but also both Chimei and Deng's forces.  Chimei, lacking food, eventually abandoned Chang'an and headed east.&lt;ref name="xin"/&gt;  Liu Xiu set up two forces at Xin'an (新安, in modern [[Luoyang]], [[Henan]]) and Yiyang (宜陽, also in modern Luoyang) to block their progress, as his forces under Deng and [[Feng Yi]], whom he had sent to relieve Deng, continued to battle the Chimei.  In spring 27, the Chimei won a great victory against both Deng and Feng at Hu (湖縣, in modern [[Sanmenxia]], [[Henan]]) -- a rarity in the records regarding them in that the battle tactics demonstrating Chimei generals' brilliance were recorded in historical accounts.  The Chimei general engaged in the tactic of feigning defeat and retreat—abandoning what appeared to be supplies of food.  Deng's forces, also hungry, tried to take the food, which turned out to only contain one layer of beans with dirt underneath.  Having locked Deng's forces into this frenzy, the Chimei forces then collapsed on them, defeating them.

However, this victory would be the last for the Chimei.  About a month later, they suffered a major defeat at Feng's hands—in which Feng created confusion for the Chimei by also coloring his troops' eyebrows red.  The remnants of the Chimei withdrew east toward Yiyang.  Liu Xiu personally led the troops to wait for them.  As the Chimei arrived at Yiyang, they were surprised to see Liu Xiu's overwhelming forces, and decided to negotiate surrender terms.  After Liu Xiu agreed not to execute Emperor Penzi, the Chimei emperor and generals surrendered.

== Aftermath ==
The Chimei generals and their families were settled in the Eastern Han capital of Luoyang and given regular stipends and land, but not official positions.  Eventually, Fan and Pang prepared to rebel again, and they were discovered and executed.  Yang and Xu returned to their home lands and died of old age there.  Xie was assassinated by Liu Gong to avenge Gengshi Emperor, and Liu Xiu, sympathetic to Liu Gong, pardoned him.

Liu Xiu made the former Emperor Penzi an assistant to his uncle Liu Liang (劉良), the Prince of Zhao.  Later, Liu Penzi suffered an illness that blinded him, and Liu Xiu gave him a large swarth of farmland, allowing him to survive on the rent from the farms.

'''Rublon''' is a [[two-factor authentication]] system that acts as an additional security layer which protects the [[password]]-based [[login]] process to [[web application]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.institutionalinvestor.com/blogarticle/3223444/Blog/Getting-Past-Passwords-and-a-Secure-Future.html |title=Getting Past Passwords and a Secure Future |author=Jeff Kutler |publisher=Institutional Investor |date=June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wpcentral.com/say-hello-rublon-new-way-stay-secure-your-windows-phone |title=Say hello to Rublon; a new way to stay secure with your Windows Phone |author=Michael Archambault |publisher=Windows Phone Central |date=September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A protected [[user (computing)|account]] can only be accessed by someone who enters the correct password and scans a [[QR code]] using the Rublon [[mobile app]], which holds the [[digital identity]] of the account's owner. In [[web browser]]s that have been previously defined as trusted, only the password is needed in order to sign into a protected account of any supported web application.

== Mobile app ==
Accounts can be protected by installing the Rublon mobile app, which is available for smartphones with [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[BlackBerry OS]], [[iOS]] and [[Windows Phone]]. The app is also used to define trusted browsers that make it possible to sign in using a password only. The app can be activated by providing an email address, which results in the creation of the user's digital identity using asymmetric cryptographic [[RSA (cryptosystem)|RSA]] keys.

== Supported web applications ==
Rublon protects the accounts of web applications that are integrated with its system. There are plugins for [[Magento]], [[PrestaShop]] and [[WordPress]], allowing administrators of websites based on these platforms to integrate them without programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wpmayor.com/plugin-reviews/rublon-review/ |title=Rublon Review |author=Jean Galea |publisher=WPMayor |date=October 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wpwhitesecurity.com/wordpress-plugins/rublon-invisible-two-factor-authentication-wordpress/ |title=Secure WordPress Login with Rublon Two-Factor Authentication |author=Robert Abela |publisher=WP White Security |date=December 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.net-security.org/review.php?id=318 |title=Two-factor authentication for WordPress using Rublon |author=Berislav Kucan |publisher=Help Net Security |date=February 28, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303105947/https://www.net-security.org/review.php?id=318 |archivedate=March 3, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Web application developers may use the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[PHP]] [[Software development kit|SDKs]] to integrate Rublon with their services.

''Scantegrity II'' prints the confirmation codes in [[invisible ink]] to improve usability and dispute resolution. As the system relies on cryptographic techniques, the ability to validate an election outcome is both [[Software independence|software independent]] as well as independent of faults in the physical [[Chain of custody|chain-of-custody]] of the paper ballots. The system was developed by a team of researchers including cryptographers [[David Chaum]] and [[Ron Rivest]].

[[Optical scan voting system]]s produce an electronic [[Tally (voting)|tally]], while maintaining the original paper ballots which can be rescanned or manually hand-counted to provide an ostensibly corroborative tally. However, the correctness of each of these tallies requires the voter to either trust that the software is error-free and has not been hacked, or that the physical chain-of-custody of the ballots has not been broken at any point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Rowell |first=Laurie |title=Down for the Count |newspaper=ACM NetWorker Magazine |date=March 2008 |url=http://mags.acm.org/networker/200803/ |issue=12:1 |pages=17–23 |format= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205070217/http://mags.acm.org/networker/200803/ |archivedate=December 5, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other E2E voting systems such as [[Punchscan]] and [[ThreeBallot]], address these issues but require existing polling place equipment and procedures to be greatly altered or replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Scantegrity is an [[Retrofit|add-on]] meant to be used in conjunction with existing optical scan equipment, thereby requiring fewer hardware and software and procedural modifications.&lt;ref name="scantegrity" /&gt;
 
For all other voters, the ballot marking procedure is essentially identical to conventional optical scan paper-ballots. Similarly, the underlying system still produces both an electronic tally as well as a human readable [[wiktionary:paper trail|paper trail]] through which [[Vote counting system#Manual counting|manual recounts]] can still be conducted.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, the voter can simply ignore the code and continue to mark and cast their ballot as normal.

The confirmation codes are randomly assigned to the ballots, allowing voters to freely share their codes while keeping their votes secret. The codes are also [[Commitment scheme|pre-committed]] to a committee of mutually-distrustful entities (such as representatives of each political party) so that the confirmation codes cannot be changed or misprinted without detection. Voters may request additional ballots to audit—they ensure the ballots are properly printed by revealing all the codes and comparing these to the codes committed to.

=== Checking ===

After the election is finished, the election authority publicly posts a list of confirmation codes for the positions marked on each ballot it received. Voters who wrote down their codes can verify that the codes are correct for their ballot number and that no codes were added or removed.&lt;ref name="technologyreview" /&gt; If the posted record is incorrect, the voter may file a dispute. Spurious disputes can be excluded from consideration by comparing the claimed codes to the set of possible codes for a given contest on a ballot—the probability of randomly guessing a code that actually appeared on the ballot is low.

=== Verification ===

After the election, the trustees generate an independent tally from the voter-verifiable list of ballots and confirmation codes. Since the link between a confirmation code and the candidate voted for must remain secret, the tally is generated using an anonymity-preserving backend. Many such backends have been proposed for tallying votes, including the ones used by [[Punchscan]] and [[Prêt à Voter]]. Steps in the tally can be recalculated by anyone to ensure its correctness. For this reason, the system is more accurately described as mathematical voting than electronic voting. The security of the system does not require any software to operate correctly, only that the mathematical operations are independently corroborated by all interested parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

{{discrimination sidebar}}

'''''Snob''''' is a pejorative term for a person that believes there is a correlation between [[social status]] and human worth.&lt;ref name=debotton&gt;De Botton, A. (2004), ''Status Anxiety''. London: Hamish Hamilton&lt;/ref&gt; ''Snob'' also refers to a person that feels superiority over those from lower social classes, education levels, or other social areas. The word ''snobbery'' came into use for the first time in England during the 1820s.

A snob is also a tool (an anvil) used by cobblers in the manufacture of footwear.

== Examples ==
Snobs can through time be found ingratiating themselves with a range of prominent groups – soldiers ([[Sparta]], 400 BC), bishops (Rome, 1500), poets (Weimar, 1815), farmers (China, 1967) – for the primary interests of snobs is distinction, and as its definition changes, so, naturally and immediately, will the objects of the snob's admiration.&lt;ref name="debotton" /&gt;

Snobbery existed also in mediaeval feudal aristocratic Europe, when the clothing, manners, language and tastes of every class were strictly codified by customs or law.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} [[Chaucer]], a poet moving in the court circles, noted the provincial French spoken by the Prioress among the [[Canterbury Tales|Canterbury pilgrims]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
And French she spoke full fair and fetisly&lt;br&gt;
After the school of Stratford atte Bowe,&lt;br&gt;
For French of Paris was to her unknowe.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

William Rothwell notes "the simplistic contrast between the 'pure' French of Paris and her 'defective' French of Stratford atte Bowe that would invite disparagement".&lt;ref&gt;Rothwell, "Stratford Atte Bowe re-visited" ''The Chaucer Review'', 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Snobbery surfaced more strongly as the structure of the society changed, and the [[bourgeoisie]] had the possibility to ''imitate'' [[aristocracy]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} Snobbery appears when elements of culture are perceived as belonging to an aristocracy or elite, and some people (the snobs) feel that the mere adoption of the fashion and tastes of the elite or aristocracy is sufficient to include someone in the elites, upper classes or aristocracy.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

However, a form of snobbery can be adopted by someone not a part of that group; a [[pseudointellectual|pseudo-intellectual]], a celebrity worshipper, and a poor person idolizing money and the rich are types of snobs who do not base their snobbery on their personal attributes. {{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}Such a snob idolizes and imitates, if possible, the manners, worldview, and [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] of a classification of people to which they aspire, but do not belong, and to which they may never belong (wealthy, famous, intellectual, beautiful, etc.).{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

==Snob victim==
The term "snob" is often misused when describing a "gold-tap owner",&lt;ref name="debotton" /&gt; i.e. a person who insists on displaying (sometimes non-existent) wealth through [[conspicuous consumption]] of luxury goods such as clothes, jewelry, cars etc. Displaying awards or talents in a rude manner, boasting, is a form of snobbery. A popular example of a "snob victim" is the television character [[Hyacinth Bucket]] of the BBC comedy series ''[[Keeping Up Appearances]]''.

== Analysis ==
[[William Hazlitt]] observed, in a culture where deference to class was accepted as a positive and unifying principle,&lt;ref&gt;The social historian [[G.M. Trevelyan]] referred to the deferential principle in British society as "beneficent snobbery", according to Ray 1955:24.&lt;/ref&gt; "Fashion is gentility running away from vulgarity, and afraid of being overtaken by it," adding subversively, "It is a sign the two things are not very far apart."&lt;ref&gt;Hazlitt, ''Conversations with Northcote'', quoted in Gordon N. Ray, "Thackeray's 'Book of Snobs'", ''Nineteenth-Century Fiction'' '''10'''.1 (June 1955:22-33) p. 25; Ray examines the context of snobbery in contemporaneous society.&lt;/ref&gt; The English novelist [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton|Bulwer-Lytton]] remarked in passing, "Ideas travel upwards, ''manners'' downwards."&lt;!--italics in original--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bulwer-Lytton, ''England and the English'', noted in Ray 1955:24.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not the deeply ingrained and fundamentally accepted idea of "one's betters" that has marked snobbery in traditional European and American culture, but "aping one's betters".

Snobbery is a defensive expression of [[Emotional insecurity|social insecurity]], flourishing most where an [[The Establishment|Establishment]] has become less than secure in the exercise of its traditional prerogatives, and thus it was more an organizing principle for Thackeray's glimpses of British society in the threatening atmosphere of the 1840s than it was of Hazlitt, writing in the comparative social stability of the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;See: Ray 1955:25f.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social justice warrior''' ('''SJW''') is a [[pejorative]] term for an individual who promotes [[socially progressive]] views, including [[feminism]], [[civil rights]], and [[multiculturalism]],{{refn|name=Ohlheiser}}{{refn|name=Johnson}} as well as [[identity politics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/billy-corgan-compares-social-justice-warriors-to-cults-maoists-kkk-20160419 |title=Billy Corgan Compares 'Social Justice Warriors' to Cults, Maoists, KKK |first= |date=April 19, 2016 |publisher= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126172247/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/billy-corgan-compares-social-justice-warriors-to-cults-maoists-kkk-20160419 |archive-date=January 26, 2017 |dead-url=no |work=Rolling Stone |author=Blistein, Jon |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The accusation that somebody is an SJW carries implications that they are pursuing [[social validation|personal validation]] rather than any deep-seated [[belief|conviction]],{{refn|name=Heron &amp; Belford}} and engaging in [[wikt:disingenuous|disingenuous]] arguments.{{refn|name=Ringo}}

The phrase originated in the late 20th century as a neutral or positive term for people engaged in [[social justice]] activism.{{refn|name=Ohlheiser}} In 2011, when the term first appeared on [[Twitter]], it changed from a primarily positive term to an overwhelmingly negative one.{{refn|name=Ohlheiser}} During the [[Gamergate controversy]], the negative connotation gained increased use, and was particularly aimed at those espousing views adhering to [[social liberalism]], cultural inclusivity, or feminism, as well as views deemed to be [[politically correct]].{{refn|name=Ohlheiser}}{{refn|name=Johnson}}

The term has entered [[popular culture]], including a [[parody]] [[role-playing video game]], ''Social Justice Warriors'', released in 2014.{{refn|name=Parreno}}{{refn|name=SJW Review}}&lt;ref name="Breiner"&gt;{{cite web|first=Andrew|last=Breiner |url=http://thinkprogress.org/culture/2015/03/13/3632998/game-fight-off-internet-trolls/|title=Don't Feed The Trolls, Fight Them|date=March 13, 2015|work=[[ThinkProgress]] |archivedate=March 1, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301193351/http://thinkprogress.org/culture/2015/03/13/3632998/game-fight-off-internet-trolls/|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
{{details|Social justice}}
Dating back to 1824, the term ''social justice'' refers to justice on a societal level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=[[The Oxford English Dictionary]] |date=September 2005 |subscription=yes |title=social justice |url=http://oed.com/search?searchType=dictionary&amp;q=social+justice |edition=3rd |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the early 1990s to the early 2000s, ''social-justice warrior'' was used as a neutral or complimentary phrase.{{refn|name=Ohlheiser}} An example from the ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'' in 1991 about a local music festival reads:

{{quote|[Quebec guitarist Rene] Lussier will present the world premiere of his ambitious Quebecois mood piece ''Le Trésor de la Langue'', which juxtaposes the spoken word—including sound bites from Charles de Gaulle and Quebec nationalist and social-justice warrior Michel Chartrand—with new-music noodlings.&lt;ref name="Ohlheiser"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ohlheiser |first=Abby |title=Why 'social justice warrior,' a Gamergate insult, is now a dictionary entry |date=October 7, 2015 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/10/07/why-social-justice-warrior-a-gamergate-insult-is-now-a-dictionary-entry |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126171340/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/10/07/why-social-justice-warrior-a-gamergate-insult-is-now-a-dictionary-entry/ |deadurl=no |work=The Washington Post |archivedate=January 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Katherine Martin, the head of U.S. dictionaries at [[Oxford University Press]], said in 2015 that "[a]ll of the examples I've seen until quite recently are lionizing the person".{{refn|name=Ohlheiser}} {{As of|2015}}, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' had not done a full search for the earliest usage.{{refn|name=Ohlheiser}}

==Pejorative use==
{{quote box |width=25em | bgcolor=#c6dbf7 |align=right |halig=left | salign=right|quote="the 'social justice warrior,' i.e., the stereotype of the feminist as unreasonable, sanctimonious, biased, and self-aggrandizing."|source=Scott Selisker{{refn|name=Selisker}}}}

According to Martin, the term switched from primarily positive to overwhelmingly negative around 2011, when it was first used as an insult on [[Twitter]].{{refn|name=Ohlheiser}} The same year, an [[Urban Dictionary]] entry for the term also appeared.{{refn|name=Ohlheiser}} The term's negative use became mainstream due to the 2014 [[Gamergate controversy]],&lt;ref name="Jeong"&gt;{{cite book |first=Sarah |last=Jeong |author-link=Sarah Jeong |year=2015 |title=The Internet of Garbage |publisher=Forbes Media |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i24nCgAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; emerging as the favoured term of Gamergate proponents to describe their ideological opponents.{{refn|name=Ohlheiser}} In [[Internet culture|Internet]] and [[video game culture]] the phrase is broadly associated with the Gamergate controversy and wider [[culture war]] fallout, including the 2015 [[Sad Puppies]] campaign that affected the [[Hugo Award]]s.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite web |quote=A Social Justice Warrior, or SJW, is any person, female or male, who argues online for political correctness or feminism.

Use of the term has been described as attempting to degrade the motivations of the person accused of being an SJW, implying that their motives are "for personal validation rather than out of any deep-seated conviction".&lt;ref name="Heron &amp; Belford"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Heron|first1=Michael James|first2=Pauline |last2=Belford|first3=Ayse|last3=Goker|title=Sexism in the circuitry: female participation in male-dominated popular computer culture |journal=ACM SIGCAS Computers and Society |year=2014 |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=18–29 |doi=10.1145/2695577.2695582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The negative connotation has primarily been aimed at those espousing views adhering to [[Social Progressivism|social progressivism]], cultural inclusivity, or [[feminism]].{{refn|name=Ohlheiser}}{{refn|name=Johnson}} This usage implies that a person is engaging in disingenuous social justice arguments or activism to raise his or her personal reputation.{{refn|name=Ringo}} Allegra Ringo writes for ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' that "[i]n other words, SJWs don't hold strong principles, but they pretend to. The problem is, that's not a real category of people. It's simply a way to dismiss anyone who brings up social justice."{{refn|name=Ringo}} 

The term has been used by Rita Panahi to criticize what she perceives as [[double standards]] in social justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Panahi|first1=Rita|title=Curious double standards of the perpetually outraged|url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/rendezview/curious-double-standards-of-the-perpetually-outraged/news-story/2c4c618b905c27150840851e17f99852|website=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=February 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' reporter Clinton Nguyen quoted the term during a report which analyzed the aggressive behavior behind 'social justice'-oriented [[Tumblr]] users, citing to an example in which Tumblr users engaged in sustained harassment towards an artist on the site over the content of the artist's work. The subsequent torment was so vicious that the artist [[attempted suicide]]. Users who supported the artist reported at least ten attackers to the police, and led to at least one arrest.&lt;ref name="Vice"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nguyen|first1=Clinton|title=An Attempted Suicide Forced a Tumblr Community to Open Its Eyes About Bullying|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/3da838/an-attempted-suicide-forced-a-tumblr-community-to-open-its-eyes-about-bullying|website=Vice|accessdate=March 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[David A. French]], the aims of social justice warriors are opposed to those of the [[Christian right]].&lt;ref&gt;French, David. [http://www.nationalreview.com/article/427523/ferocious-religious-faith-campus-social-justice-warrior-david-french "The Ferocious Religious Faith of the Campus Social-Justice Warrior"]. ''National Review''. November 23, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Explain|date=January 2018}}

The term is commonly used by participants in online discussion in [[criticism of feminism]].&lt;ref name="Selisker"&gt;{{cite journal |issn=0028-6087 |oclc=1296558 |doi=10.1353/nlh.2015.0024 |last=Selisker |first=Scott |title=The Bechdel Test and the Social Form of Character Networks |journal=New Literary History |volume=46 |issue=3 |year=2015 |pages=505–523}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott Selisker, writes in ''[[New Literary History]]'', "[Forum participants] often make personal criticisms of what they see as a type: the 'social justice warrior,' i.e., the stereotype of the feminist as unreasonable, sanctimonious, biased, and self-aggrandizing".{{refn|name=Selisker}}

In August 2015, ''social justice warrior'' was one of several new words and phrases added to [[Oxford Dictionaries]].{{refn|name=Ohlheiser}}&lt;ref name="Wagner"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/08/27/435232388/can-you-use-that-in-a-sentence-dictionary-adds-new-words |publisher=[[NPR]] |title=Can You Use That In A Sentence?

Elizabeth Nolan Brown writes on ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' that proponents of "social justice" on both the left and the right share similarities such as outrage, claims of victimhood, and portraying opponents as bullying and evil and their side as the truly oppressed.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brown |first1=Elizabeth |title=Trump Fans and 'Social Justice Warriors,' Two Sides of the Same Authoritarian Coin|url=http://reason.com/blog/2016/05/12/trump-fans-and-social-justice-warriors |publisher=Reason |accessdate=August 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, the concept was incorporated into a [[parody]] [[role-playing video game]] titled ''Social Justice Warriors''.&lt;ref name="Parreno"&gt;{{cite web |first=Ryan |last=Parreno |url=http://gameranx.com/updates/id/24055/article/social-justice-warriors-now-have-their-own-rpg/ |title=Social Justice Warriors Now Have Their Own RPG |date=September 9, 2014 |work=Gameranx |archivedate=January 3, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103021359/http://www.gameranx.com/updates/id/24055/article/social-justice-warriors-now-have-their-own-rpg |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SJW Review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technologytell.com/gaming/144852/social-justice-warrior-review-meh/ |title=Social Justice Warrior Review |work=Technology Tell |date=March 30, 2015 |archivedate=January 3, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160103130249/http://www.technologytell.com/gaming/144852/social-justice-warrior-review-meh/ |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developed by Nonadecimal Creative, ''Social Justice Warriors'' involved the concept of debating online against [[Internet troll]]s who make [[racist]] and other provocative comments by choosing from different responses such as "'dismember their claims with your logic,' rebroadcast their message to be attacked by others, or go for the personal attack."{{refn|name=SJW Review}} Users were able to select a [[character class]]; and gameplay involved changes to user meters of ''Sanity'' and ''Reputation''.{{refn|name=SJW Review}} Game creator Eric Ford explained that the game was designed to foster [[critical thinking]] and was not "intended to suggest that racist, sexist, or other offensive comments shouldn't be confronted online. The goal is to encourage critical thinking on how it can be done more effectively, and at less cost to the real-world social justice warriors."{{refn|name=SJW Review}}

'''Something New''' is a political party in the United Kingdom, founded in October 2014. The party is primarily based on the concept of an [[open-source]] manifesto, which means that it could be described as a party of the [[Radical center (politics)|radical centre]], as it combines ideas from the [[Left-wing politics|left]] and [[Right-wing politics|right]] of politics. It could also be described as [[Syncretic politics|syncretic]].&lt;ref name=dickens&gt;{{cite podcast |url=http://openhorsham.podomatic.com/entry/2015-01-07T10_30_39-08_00|quote=We're trying to go forwards from that to take the best parts from all the political thinking so far, from all of the ways we've tried to do things so far, and move forward.

Something New was founded in 2013,&lt;ref name=OEC2&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://openelectoralcommission.org.uk/parties/PP1958/something-new/|website=OpenElectoralCommission|accessdate=15 April 2015|title=Something New}} A mirror of data from the [[Electoral Commission]] PEF [https://pefonline.electoralcommission.org.uk/Search/EntitySearch.aspx entity registration search]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and was revived in October 2014.

In the course of the election campaign, both Smith and Robinson attended several pre-election [[hustings]]. On 21 March 2015, Smith attended one husting organised by the [[Sussex]] branch of the [[Campaign to Protect Rural England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=21 March 2015: Countryside… or Concrete?|url=http://www.cpresussex.org.uk/events/past-events/item/2559-21-march-2015-countryside-or-concrete|website=CPRE Sussex|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson attended one husting in South West Surrey that included the incumbent Member of Parliament and [[Secretary of State for Health|Health Secretary]] [[Jeremy Hunt (politician)|Jeremy Hunt]] and the chief challenger, [[National Health Action Party]] candidate [[Louise Irvine]].&lt;ref name=gets&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Becca|title=Election 2015: South West Surrey constituency candidates make their final pitches|url=http://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/local-news/election-2015-south-west-surrey-9166139|accessdate=5 May 2015|work=getSURREY|date=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Smith stated that he wished to beat the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] candidate in Horsham, as the Green Party received only 570 votes at the [[UK General Election, 2010|2010 general election]] with very little campaigning.&lt;ref name=beat&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tamplin|first1=Harley|title=Something New candidate: ‘I want to beat Green Party in Horsham’|url=http://www.wscountytimes.co.uk/news/local/something-new-candidate-i-want-to-beat-green-party-in-horsham-1-6732675|accessdate=8 May 2015|work=West Sussex County Times|date=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Smith only received 375 votes whereas the Green Party candidate received 2,151.

Following the 2015 general election, Something New stood a candidate, Jessie Macneil-Brown, in a by-election in the Stepney Green Ward on [[Tower Hamlets London Borough Council]], that was held on 11 June 2015. Macneil-Brown won just over 1% of the vote and came last out of all the candidates.&lt;ref name=tower /&gt; Something New also intends to contest the [[London Assembly election, 2016]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last=Smith|first=James|date=11 May 2015|title=May 2015 Election Results|url=http://www.somethingnew.org.uk/may_2015_election_results|publisher=Something New|access-date=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 May 2015, [[Lindsey Garrett]], Chair of the [[New Era estate|New Era]] Tenants Association, was announced as Something New's candidate for [[Mayor of London]] in the [[London mayoral election, 2016]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last=Hilton|first=Alexander|date=14 May 2015|title=New Era's Lindsey Garrett to Seek London Mayoralty|url=http://www.somethingnew.org.uk/lindsey_garrett_seeks_london_mayoralty|publisher=Something New|access-date=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garrett was instrumental in removing Westbrook Partners from the estate and worked with [[Russell Brand]] and other New Era residents throughout the campaign.

== OpenPolitics Project==

The OpenPolitics Project was launched in August 2013.&lt;ref name=positive&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gilley|first1=Matthew|title=Digital democracy|url=http://positivenews.org.uk/2015/peace_democracy/17315/digital-democracy/|accessdate=3 April 2015|work=[[Positive News]]|date=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an open-source manifesto, in that anyone is free to contribute a policy that is then discussed and subject to consensus or scrapped.&lt;ref name=district&gt;{{cite news|last1=Butler|first1=Nik|title=Open ended promises|url=http://www.thedistrictpost.co.uk/news/2015/02/opinion-open-ended-promises/|accessdate=8 April 2015|work=The  District Post|location=Horsham|date=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It combines elements of [[open-source governance]] and also [[direct democracy]] and [[consensus democracy]]. The project is organised on [[GitHub]] and the contribution process is operated in a way similar to Wikipedia's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bluer|first1=Jordan|title=OpenPolitics: 'Wikipedia-like' manifesto lets YOU decide the agenda|url=http://www.mancunianmatters.co.uk/content/020372393-openpolitics-wikipedia-manifesto-lets-you-decide-agenda|accessdate=12 March 2015|work=Mancunian Matters|date=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fringe&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gilley|first1=Matthew|title=Open Source Politics, with James Smith from the Something New party|url=http://partiesonthefringe.com/2015/02/20/open-source-politics-with-james-smith-from-the-something-new-party/|accessdate=28 February 2015|date=20 February 2015|website=Parties on the Fringe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manifesto is supported by a base of active contributors, numbering roughly 25.&lt;ref name="positive" /&gt; Any candidates are open to stand on the OpenPolitics Manifesto, however only Something New and their two candidates for the 2015 general election have pledged to stand on the policies.&lt;ref name=whip&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Andrew|title=Time for Something New?|url=http://ukwhippersnapper.blogspot.co.uk/2015/01/time-for-something-new.html|website=Whippersnapper|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Smith has said, on behalf of Something New, that the three policies that he would prioritise would be to "change the voting system to three-member [[single transferable vote]], tackle off-shoring of profits, and target of no new fossil-fuel vehicles by 2030."&lt;ref name=fringe /&gt; Smith has also described the Manifesto as "never 'finished,'
never 'published.' It's a [[living document]], always being updated and improved."&lt;ref name=essay /&gt;

On behalf of Something New and the OpenPolitics Project, Smith wrote an essay that was included in the Design Commission's report on "Designing Democracy." The essay appeared on pages 67 and 68 of the report in Section 4: The Stuff of Democracy. The inquiry was headed by Dr Richard Simmons and [[John Howell (politician)|John Howell]] and the report was launched on 23 March 2015.&lt;ref name=essay&gt;{{cite web|title=Essay Collection: Designing Democracy|url=http://www.policyconnect.org.uk/apdig/research/essay-collection-designing-democracy|website=[[Associate Parliamentary Design and Innovation Group|All-Party Parliamentary Design and Innovation Group]]|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith concluded his essay with the line, "The Open Revolution is here to change everything."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last=Smith|first=James|date=23 March 2015|title=Designing a better democracy|url=http://www.somethingnew.org.uk/designing_a_better_democracy|publisher=Something New|access-date=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Iran]] convened a conference titled "'''International Disarmament and Non-proliferation: World Security without Weapons of Mass Destruction'''" on 17 and 18 April 2010 in [[Tehran]].  The theme of the conference was ''Nuclear Energy for All, Nuclear Weapons for No One''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.ir/cms/cms/Tehran/en/NEW/151891.html Tehran nuclear disarmament conference will be a success:Iran Foreign Ministry Spokesman]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference resulted in Iranian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]'s call for action toward the [[nuclear disarmament|elimination of all nuclear weapons]].

==Background==
{{See also|Nuclear program of Iran}}
The [[New START]] treaty was signed on 8 April 2010, in [[Prague]] by US President [[Barack Obama]] and [[Russian President]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]].  This treaty resumed the START process of reducing the number of [[nuclear weapons]] in the two nations, for the first time requiring verifiability between them.

The conference was held just days after a Nuclear Security Summit was held in [[Washington, DC]] on 12–14 April over the security of "vulnerable nuclear material."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3871471,00.html Iran to host conference on nuclear disarmament]&lt;/ref&gt; This conference was viewed as a counterpoint to the Washington summit.&lt;ref name="aljaz"&gt;{{en icon}} [http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2010/04/201041762943810423.html Aljazeera.net]&lt;/ref&gt; Its intention was to prove Iran's national and political will for the eradication of nuclear weapons, where Iran said the chemical weapons convention determined such weapons should be destroyed but the United States had chosen to ignore it.&lt;ref name="minforaff"&gt;[http://cms.mfa.gov.ir/cms/cms/Tehranicd/en/NewsEvents/g12989 CMS.MFA.gov.ir]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, the [[NPT Review Conference (2010)|review conference]] for the [[Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT) was held at [[United Nations headquarters]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=51015 Disarmament: NGOs Praise U.S. Leadership on Nukes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415192034/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=51015 |date=2010-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, the [[EastWest Institute]] released a joint US-Russian ''Threat Assessment on Iran's Nuclear and Missile Potential''. The report said there was no specific evidence that Iran was seeking the ability to attack Europe and that "it is indeed difficult to imagine the circumstances in which Iran would do so." It added that if Iran did pursue this capability, it would need six to eight years to develop a missile capable of carrying a 1,000 kilogram warhead 2,000 kilometers; and that Iran ending "IAEA containment and surveillance of the nuclear material and all installed cascades at the Fuel Enrichment Plan" might serve as an early warning of Iranian intentions. The report concluded that there was "no IRBM/ICBM threat from Iran and that such a threat, even if it were to emerge, is not imminent."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ploughshares.org/sites/default/files/resources/20090516_ewi_iransnucleamissilepotential.pdf East-West Institute: Iran’s Nuclear and Missile Potential]&lt;/ref&gt; Incoming [[International Atomic Energy Agency#Secretariat|Director General]] of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], [[Yukiya Amano]] said he had not seen any evidence in IAEA official documents that Iran was seeking the ability to develop nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

* The US was officially registered as a participant, but denied having been invited (''see [[Tehran International Conference on Disarmament and Non-Proliferation, 2010#Controversies|controversies]]'').

==Issues==
The conference was composed of three panels focusing on the following topics:
* Disarmament challenges;
* International obligations of States for disarmament and non-proliferation and consequences of the continued existence of WMDs;
* Practical steps for the materialization of disarmament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.ir/cms/cms/Tehranicd/en/ProgramoftheConference/index.html Tehran International Conference on Disarmament and Non- Proliferation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410193007/http://www.mfa.gov.ir/cms/cms/Tehranicd/en/ProgramoftheConference/index.html |date=2010-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iranian Foreign Minister [[Manouchehr Mottaki]] said he had "stressed that nuclear energy must be for everybody. While &lt;nowiki&gt;[the Washington summit]&lt;/nowiki&gt; discussed the protection of nuclear material, in this coming conference we will emphasise the necessity of disarmament."&lt;ref name="aljazeera"/&gt;

==Discussions==
[[Supreme Leader of Iran]] [[Ayatollah]] [[Seyyed Ali Khamenei]] sent a message to the nuclear disarmament conference clarifying that "Iran regards using nuclear weapons as [[Haraam|forbidden in Islam]] and it is incumbent on everyone to safeguard humanity from such weapons," while "every nation is entitled to the peaceful use of this technology."&lt;ref name="tehrantimes.com"/&gt;  He called the US the world's "only nuclear scofflaw" for its advocating of arms control while maintaining a huge nuclear arsenal of its own as well as support for Israel notwithstanding their [[Nuclear weapons and Israel|atomic arsenal]] despite not being a signatory of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/middleeast/la-fg-iran-nukes18-2010apr18,0,3590707.story Iran lashes out at U.S. during Tehran nuclear summit]&lt;/ref&gt;  (The US and Iran are signatories of the NPT.)&lt;ref&gt;Federation of American Scientists, "Signatories and parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of nuclear weapons," [http://www.fas.org/nuke/control/npt/text/npt3.htm FAS.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmadinejad said that "threatening with nuclear weapons only dishonoured the American government officials and more fully exposed their inhumane and aggressive policies." He also called for more rigorous action than that outlined by the US summit.  His comments drew applause when he called for the destruction of all atomic weapons, starting with those in the US arsenal.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;Washington Post, 17 April 2010, "At Iran Nuclear Summit, Ahmadinejad Calls for U.S. to Disarm First", [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/17/AR2010041702111.html WashingtonPost.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  He further called on the US to end its "blind support" for Israel, which he estimated has 200 atomic warheads but has failed to sign the NPT.  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei reiterated a religious edict he had issued earlier against the use of all nuclear weapons, and called the nuclear arsenal of the US "tools of terror and intimidation."&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;  Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki said that a nuclear weapons-free Middle East requires "the Zionist regime to join the NPT." This was seen as a call for Israel to join the NPT and open up its nuclear facilities to international inspectors.&lt;ref name="almanar"/&gt; The Secretary General of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, added that "Israel should ink the NPT without any waste of time," adding that the Middle East should be turned into a region free from nuclear weapons.  He also called for tangible measures in this regard, and cautioned that "Either you should destroy the WMDs or they will kill us."&lt;ref&gt;[http://cms.mfa.gov.ir/cms/cms/Tehranicd/en/NewsEvents/e12989 CMS.MFA.gov.ir]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The head of Iran's [[Atomic Energy Organisation]] [[Ali Akbar Salehi]] said the NPT was under threat as it currently stood. "If countries armed with nuclear weapons want to respect and bolster NPT, they should fully fulfill their pledges to this end. There is no doubt that [the] continuation of [a] nuclear arms race and adoption of dual-standard policies in dealing with peaceful nuclear energy will create a challenge for the world. If policies such as selective approaches, use of language of threat, unjust and dual standard policies are not halted at the earliest opportunities, NPT will lose its legitimacy and the IAEA will be deviated from its main principles." He added that "interference [from] certain western countries [are] weakening of the NPT's letter of association, the body is now serving [the] United Nations Security Council which pursues {{Sic|hide=y|politically|-}}motivated policies of [a] few countries."&lt;ref&gt;[http://cms.mfa.gov.ir/cms/cms/Tehranicd/en/NewsEvents/h12989 CMS.MFA.gov.ir]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this vein, the Secretary of Iran's [[Supreme National Security Council|Supreme National Security Council of Iran]], [[Saeed Jalili]], called for strengthening of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) as the only way to stop nuclear proliferation. According to [[IRNA]], Jalili said "preventing [[Major powers]] from imposing their influence on the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is another way of promoting nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation and strengthening of NPT."&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.irib.ir/index.php/news/political/33251 Jalili Stresses Strengthening NPT for N-Disarmament, Non-Proliferation ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722015150/http://english.irib.ir/index.php/news/political/33251 |date=2011-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Iranian chief nuclear negotiator, Jalili, underlined Tehran's commitment to dialogue to remove concerns through the implementation of undertakings of all the relevant sides.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=8901281376 Jalili: N. Armed States Incompetent to Fulfill Disarmament] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509011652/http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=8901281376 |date=2011-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He put forward a proposal which consists of three pillars:
* A clear timetable be drawn up for the elimination of all nuclear weapons and an international verification mechanism for the nuclear activities of nuclear-weapon states. This verification mechanism should be similar to the one used to verify the fulfillment of commitments by non-nuclear weapon states under article 3 of NPT.
* A fact-finding committee to be established by the IAEA to investigate the sources of proliferation of nuclear weapons to the Zionist regime and report the results of its findings to the Security Council and the General Assembly during current year.
* In the framework of nonproliferation measures, nuclear-weapon states be prohibited from any kind of nuclear cooperation with non-members and commit themselves not to transfer any kind of nuclear material, equipment and technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voltairenet.org/article165011.html Address by Saeed Jalili at the International Conference on Nuclear Disarmament]&lt;/ref&gt;

Iran's ambassador to the IAEA said he had offered proposals for a better future for the IAEA.&lt;ref name="minforaff"/&gt;

==Results==
A 15-point communique was released at the end of the conference.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100729114146/http://www.salamiran.org/content/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=320&amp;Itemid=0 Salamiran.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmadinejad called for "an independent international group which plans and oversees nuclear disarmament and prevents proliferation...This group should act in a way where all independent countries and governments could have a say and role in running the affairs of that group. Until now the presence and political domination of the agency has prevented them from carrying out their duties and has diverted the agency from performing its legal obligations." He also took blows at the United States in saying "[Those who] possess, have used or threatened to use nuclear weapons [should] be suspended from the IAEA and its board of governors, especially the US which has used a weapon made of atomic waste in the [[Iraq War|Iraq war]]."&lt;ref name="aljaz"/&gt; He suggested that the United States and its vast arsenal of atomic warheads was delaying the long-awaited prospect of global nuclear disarmament. He said its so-called deterrence policy had been the primary reason behind the proliferation of [[weapons of mass destruction|WMD]]'s in recent years.  "Washington has not only applied nuclear weapons against other nations, but has for years threatened to use weapons of mass destruction against world countries in order to gain the upper hand...such countries should be stripped of their membership to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). They have no place [in the UN nuclear watchdog] or its Board of Governors."&lt;ref&gt;[http://cms.mfa.gov.ir/cms/cms/Tehranicd/en/NewsEvents/b29189 SMS.MFA.gov.ir]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran's ambassador to the IAEA said he had offered proposals to better the body in the future.&lt;ref name="minforaff"/&gt;

On 18 April, Iran's Foreign Minister indicated that "Iran plans to hold talks with all 15 members of the UN Security Council in an effort to break a deadlock over a nuclear fuel deal."&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.news.yahoo.com/18/20100418/tpl-iran-to-talk-with-security-council-m-59299dc.html Iran to talk with Security Council members on nuclear deal]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mottaki said "The talks will focus on the fuel exchange [deal]. They will be conducted by Iran's missions in those countries. In principle the issue of fuel exchange has been agreed upon ... We think ... details could be worked out."&lt;ref name="almanar"&gt;[http://www.almanar.com.lb/newssite/NewsDetails.aspx?id=133985&amp;language=en Almanar.com.lb]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
===Iranian reactions===
The Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, [[Ramin Mehmanparast]], saying "The estimates show that this conference will be warmly welcomed by countries"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.ir/cms/cms/Tehran/en/NEW/151891.html MGA.gov.ir]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; He added a thinly veiled attack on the United States in saying that "The world is currently witnessing discrimination. On one hand, using nuclear energy for peaceful purposes is limited while at the same time, countries which possess nuclear weapons do not allow nations to access nuclear energy. These countries allow themselves to use nuclear weapons and announce that they will not hesitate to use these arms against other nations. This can lead to a collective effort. The international community would like to set in motion a real move to enjoy nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and for national development. We are witnessing big threats by possessors of nuclear weapons. They are boldly threatening to use nukes. Any use of nuclear weapons to harm humanity is condemned."&lt;ref&gt;[http://cms.mfa.gov.ir/cms/cms/Tehranicd/en/NewsEvents/d29189 CMS.MFA.gov.ir]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Deputy Foreign Minister for Education and Research, Mohammad Bagher Khorramshad accusing the [[Western world#Modern political|West]] of having made a [[hue and cry]] to prevent the conference from going through because they feared the conference would question their own sincerity to international community and adding that "A few colonial powers seek to monopolize production of nuclear energy and deprive other of it. It is among [the] legitimate rights of every nation to make use of nuclear technology and no one is authorized to deprive them of such a privilege.&lt;ref name="forminiran"&gt;[http://cms.mfa.gov.ir/cms/cms/Tehranicd/en/NewsEvents/161892 CMS.MFA.gov.ir]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Mottaki closed the conference saying that "Those who think of attacking Iran are playing with fire. They will very well realize the consequences of their actions. "We don't believe they will attack. We do not see they have the capacity on the ground."&lt;ref name="almanar"/&gt; He also called the conference a success because the participants achieved the goal of highlighting the necessity of nuclear disarmament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=123899&amp;sectionid=351020104 PressTV.ir]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unofficial reaction came from such places as the academics at the [[University of Tehran]], one of whom suggested that "Most countries in the world do feel that the UN Security Council as well as the IAEA board of governors is not democratic, so it is something that most people in the south have a great deal of sympathy with. The problem that Iran is facing right now is the fact that western countries are very much biased against the country. So he is using this opportunity to point out Iran's position and show that it is a very reasonable and logical one and the reason that Iran is unable to get its voice across is because these bodies are undemocratic."&lt;ref name="aljaz"/&gt;

===External reactions===
====Countries====
*{{IRQ}} / {{flag|Lebanon}} / {{SYR}} The Foreign Ministers of Iraq, Lebanon and Syria also supported Iran's right to nuclear technology while condemning Israel's nuclear arsenal. Syria's [[Walid Muallem]] said "We back Iran for pursuing peaceful nuclear technology. The major threat in the region is Israel which has nuclear warheads. Israel must join this treaty and take quick steps to destroy its nuclear weapons which number over 200 warheads." His Lebanese counterpart, [[Ali al-Shami]], said Iran was seeking "nuclear energy for peaceful aims and it was not deviating from the treaty." Adding that Israel needed to be "stripped" off its nuclear arsenal. "There is more need to strip Israel of its nuclear arsenal, as the international community is aware of its nuclear weapons capability and that this regime has defiantly declared it will use these weapons whenever it wants. Since the atomic weapons of the Zionist regime are not inspected, there is a danger of these weapons being used in future. This regime must join the NPT without any conditions." Iraq's Hoshyar Zebari chimed in that "We reject any threat against Iran and insist on Iran's rights to use peaceful nuclear energy."&lt;ref name="almanar"/&gt; On the sidelines Iran's parliamentary speaker and Lebanon's Shami also criticised Israel. Parliament Speaker [[Ali Larijani]] said Muslim states must try to prevent Israel from "implementing its hostile plans" because they have "a religious responsibility" to do so. "The Muslim ummah must take serious and practical steps against the immeasurable number of atrocities carried out by Israel in various parts of Palestine especially, [Jerusalem] al-Quds." He called Lebanon "the symbol of resistance against Israel," and praised the Lebanese determination to fight Israel.  Shami said the Lebanon would never forget the support Iran has shown to Lebanon's [[Hezbollah|resistance movement]]. He added that Israel's policies toward the region were focused on expansionist policies, therefore "Islamic and Arab states in the region and around the world need to take a steadfast stance against Israel's evil policies that include the Judisization of al-Quds."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=123642&amp;sectionid=351020101 PressTV.ir]&lt;/ref&gt;
**{{flag|Lebanon}} Upon returning home after the conference Lebanon's foreign minister called for the UN to pressure Israel: "Regional and international communities should pressure the Security Council into imposing sanctions against Israel."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almanar.com.lb/newssite/NewsDetails.aspx?id=134087&amp;language=en Almanar.com.lb]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{RUS}} The Russian Deputy Foreign Minister at the conference "called for more confidence-building measures from Tehran to allay international concerns over its nuclear program".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/russia-prods-iran-at-tehran-hosted-nuclear-disarmament-conference/404144.html Russia Prods Iran at Tehran-Hosted Nuclear Disarmament Conference]&lt;/ref&gt; Russia added that the conference "is an excellent opportunity to have a free-flowing exchange of views on some critical issues. We are discussing scenarios and the way to go forward to this goal [of having nuclear energy for all, and nuclear weapons for none. [World powers, however, remain united over] a set of issues that are not resolved that maybe considered satisfactory by the United States and some other countries."&lt;ref&gt;[http://cms.mfa.gov.ir/cms/cms/Tehranicd/en/NewsEvents/c29189 CMS.MFA.gov.ir]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{OMA}} Oman said the conference is indicative of Iran's peaceful nuclear programme: "The Islamic Republic of Iran emphasizes that it is pursuing a peaceful, and not - as certain states claim - a military (nuclear) goal. We have taken part in the Tehran conference in a bid to reemphasize that Iran's nuclear program is peaceful."&lt;ref&gt;[http://cms.mfa.gov.ir/cms/cms/Tehranicd/en/NewsEvents/f12989 CMS.MFA.gov.ir]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{flag|Singapore}} Singapore disavowed the statement Iran issued after the conference, saying "The ministry said there was no agreement among delegates to the Tehran Conference to issue such a document, and 'neither was there any discussion on the contents of the document."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v5/newsindex.php?id=491965 Bernama.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{USA}} The US., amongst other countries, also welcomed the Iranian decision to resume talk on a nuclear fuel swap.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.ir/cms/cms/Tehran/en/NEW/151892.html MFA.gov.ir]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=123816&amp;sectionid=351020104 PressTV.ir]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Miscellaneous====
* Paul Ingram, executive director of the [[British American Security Information Council]], said that "the Tehran conference will undermine US strategies in forming a front against Iran. Obama held the [[2010 Nuclear Security Summit|Nuclear Security Summit]] in an aim to reach an international consensus against Iran; however, his efforts were of no avail." He added that the conference could increase international support for Iran as well as lessen tension.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=123533&amp;sectionid=351020101 PressTV.ir]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Time Magazine]] noted that while "the Tehran conference yielded few concrete results," despite Iran's failure to comply with all the transparency demands of the IAEA "there was evidence at Iran's summit that Tehran's nuclear strategy is succeeding."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1982962,00.html?xid=rss-topstories Ahmadinejad's Answer to Obama's Nuclear Summit]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
Iran said there would be some sort of American representation at the conference, however this was denied by the [[US State Department]] which stated that no US official had been invited.&lt;ref name="aljazeera"/&gt;

Former Iranian president [[Mohammad Khatami]] was encouraged not to attend another nuclear disarmament conference in [[Hiroshima]], [[Japan]].&lt;ref name="aljazeera"&gt;{{Cite news |title= Iran to open nuclear summit |url= http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2010/04/201041623302176311.html |publisher= [[Al Jazeera]] |date= 17 April 2010 |accessdate= 17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His aide claimed there was an outright ban on him leaving the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} [http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2010/04/2010416125124638313.html Aljazeera.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Terra Madre''' is a network of food communities. Terra Madre network was launched by the [[Slow Food]] grass roots organization, and the intent is to provide small-scale farmers, breeders, fishers and food artisans whose approach to food production protects the environment and communities. The network brings them together with academics, cooks, consumers and youth groups so that they can join forces in working to improve the food system.&lt;ref name="terramadre"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terramadre.info/|title=TerraMadre Rete delle comunit&amp;agrave; del cibo|author=Blulab|publisher=terramadre.info|accessdate=2014-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Terra Madre network holds a major biennial conference which are held in [[Torino, Italy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saladino|first1=Dan|title=Terra Madre Part 1: A Global Food Gathering|publisher=BBC|date=16 October 2016| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07z3fw0| website=[[The Food Programme]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; intended to foster discussion and introduce innovative concepts in the field of food, [[gastronomy]], [[globalization]], [[economics]]. The first of these conferences was held in 2004.

The national and regional Terra Madre work closely with the [[Slow Food]] convivia to increase the capacity of local communities to provide good, clean and fair food.

The Terra Madre Foundation was created to conceive, finance and organize international gatherings and other emerging projects, to assure the continuity of Mother Earth.

The founding members of the Terra Madre Foundation include:&lt;ref name="terramadre2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terramadre.org/pagine/organizzazione/?id=5232CF8A11b3b22E6BRym3D36877&amp;tp=3|title=Fondazione Terra Madre - Organizzazione - TerraMadre Rete delle comunit&amp;agrave; del cibo|author=Blulab|publisher=terramadre.org|accessdate=2014-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Transport''' is a [[sans serif]] [[typeface]] first designed for [[road signs in the United Kingdom]]. It was created between 1957 and 1963 by [[Jock Kinneir]] and [[Margaret Calvert]] as part of their work as designers for the Department of Transport's Anderson and [[Worboys Committee|Worboys]] committees.&lt;ref name="DM"&gt;[http://designmuseum.org/design/jock-kinneir-margaret-calvert Design Museum — Jock Kinneir + Margaret Calvert], URL accessed 16 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New Transport"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Transport|first=Margaret|last=Calvert|author-link=Margaret Calvert|url=http://www.newtransport.co.uk/|publisher=A2-Type|accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Before its introduction, British road signs used the capitals-only Llewellyn-Smith alphabet that was introduced following the Maybury Report of 1933 and revised in 1955–57. Older signs, known as [[fingerpost]]s, tended to use a variety of [[sans serif]] alphabets as supplied by their manufacturers. For the kinds of roads on which either of these alphabets was likely to be seen, legibility was not a pressing issue, but the planning and building of Britain's first [[motorway]] in the 1950s was a catalyst for change.

The Ministry of Transport appointed an Advisory Committee on Traffic Signs for Motorways under the chairmanship of Sir Colin Anderson in 1957 and Jock Kinneir and his assistant Margaret Calvert were appointed as [[graphic design]]ers to it. All aspects of signing were investigated and tested, initially on the [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] bypass (1958, now part of the [[M6 motorway]]), before their introduction on the ([[London]]–[[Yorkshire]]) [[M1 motorway]] a year later. The committee looked at examples from other European countries as well as the USA but Kinneir and Calvert found them somewhat harsh and unsatisfactory. Instead, they developed a more rounded typeface with distinctive tails to 'a', 't', and 'l', and bar-less [[fractions]], all of which helped legibility.

The department, seeing the successful early results of this work then appointed another committee, under the chairmanship of Sir Walter Worboys and again using Kinneir and Calvert as designers, to look at Traffic Signs for All-Purpose Roads. Work for this also resulted in the introduction of the pictogram signs based on those recommended by the 1949 [[United Nations]] World Conference on Road and Motor Transport.

==Characteristics==

Two forms of the typeface exist; Transport Medium and Transport Heavy.&lt;ref name="Transport URW" /&gt; Both have the same basic form, but Transport Heavy is [[emphasis (typography)|boldface]], to allow easier readability of black letters on white backgrounds, such as those used on non-primary roads, while Transport Medium is lighter, and is used for white letters on dark backgrounds, such as the green primary route signs.

The Transport typefaces are the only ones allowed on UK road signs (except for motorway signs, where route numbers appear in their own separate typeface known as [[Motorway (typeface)|Motorway]]).&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/3113/regulation/13/made Regulation 13] and [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/3113/schedule/13/made Schedule 13] of The Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2002 (legislation.gov.uk)&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a limited number of symbols are available in Transport, mainly those commonly used in road signs, such as [[apostrophe]]s, the [[pound sign]] and certain [[vulgar fraction]]s such as ½ and ⅓.&lt;ref name="CRBD"&gt;[http://www.cbrd.co.uk/fonts/ Chris's British Road Directory], URL accessed 5 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Various [[diacritic]]s are also available, for use in languages other than English, such as [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Irish language|Irish]].

== Other uses around the world ==
Although developed in the United Kingdom, the typeface has been used in many other countries around the world. In addition to the [[Crown dependency|Crown dependencies]], [[British overseas territories]] and some limited residual usage in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth states]], the typeface is also used in Hong Kong, Iceland, Ireland, Greece, and Portugal, and in much of the Middle East. Denmark uses a variation with added spacing and modified figures. Italy and Spain use bolder variants, called ''Alfabeto Normale'' in Italy and ''Carretera Convencional'' in Spain (the latter originally only on non-motorway roads, but since 2014 it applies to any new sign both in motorway and non-motorway roads).

In countries where other [[writing system|scripts]] (such as the [[Arabic script]]) are used, Transport is often used for [[Latin script|Latin]] [[transliteration]]s.&lt;ref name="DM"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbrd.co.uk/roadsfaq/#36 FAQ §3.6 Fonts on signs] from Chris's British Road Directory&lt;/ref&gt; [[Road signs in the Republic of Ireland]] use [[all-caps]] Transport Heavy for English names; for Irish names, mixed-case Transport Heavy [[Oblique type|oblique]] is used with variants for ''A'', ''a'', ''i'', ''M'' and ''N'': [[script a]], [[tittle#Dotless and dotted i|dotless i]], and tall versions of ''m'' and ''n''.

In Indonesia, since April 2014, changeable message signs/electronic signs have used Transport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kemhubri.dephub.go.id/perundangan/images/stories/doc/permen/2014/pm_13_tahun_2014.pdf Indonesia Transport Minister's Rule No. 13/2014] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006141343/http://kemhubri.dephub.go.id/perundangan/images/stories/doc/permen/2014/pm_13_tahun_2014.pdf |date=6 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digitisations==

The original Transport family, with its two weights, has been digitised by [[URW++]].&lt;ref name="Transport URW"&gt;{{cite web|title=Transport|url=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/transport/|website=MyFonts|publisher=URW++|accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Transport===
An updated version of the typeface has been developed by Henrik Kubel of A2/SW/HK and Margaret Calvert during 2012, with the family expanded to include six different weights (Thin, Light, Regular, Medium, Bold, Black) with [[oblique type|oblique]] stylings to complement them. It also has other features including [[text figures]] and [[small capitals]].&lt;ref name="New Transport1"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Transport|url=http://www.newtransport.co.uk/|website=New Transport|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of its first public uses has been on the UK's revamped central government website, '[[GOV.UK]]', where it has been selected as the sole font for all text.&lt;ref name="New Transport GOV.UK"&gt;{{cite web|title=A few notes on typography|url=http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/07/05/a-few-notes-on-typography|website=GOV.UK|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transport New===
An updated though unofficial family based upon Transport was first released by independent foundry K-Type in 2008. The family includes Light, Medium and Heavy weights along with true italics which were added in 2015.&lt;ref name="Transport New" &gt;{{cite web|title=Transport New|url=http://www.k-type.com/fonts/transport-new/|website=K-Type|accessdate=17 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Unlock Democracy''' is a British [[pressure group]], based in [[London]]. The organisation campaigns for a more [[participatory democracy]] in Britain, founded upon a written [[constitution]]. Unlock Democracy works to promote democratic reform across the political spectrum and is not aligned with any political party. The organisation's activities include producing a range of publications, lobbying politicians and political parties and working on projects to promote greater public involvement in politics, at both local and national levels.

Unlock Democracy is governed by an annually elected membership council and from that a management board. It is funded from three main sources: grant income for specific projects from various foundations and trusts, subscriptions and donations from its members and supporters, and income from its subsidiary company Rodell Properties Ltd.

The founding Director was [[Peter Facey]]. He was Director of Unlock Democracy’s predecessor organisation the [[New Politics Network]] in 2001 and latter also becoming Director of [[Charter 88]]. He was responsible for the merger of the two organisations in 2007.  He was succeeded as Director in 2013 by long-time deputy Director Alexandra Runswick.

== History ==

In 2003, 15 years after the formation of [[Charter 88]], the organisation was experiencing a very turbulent period and this led to great organisational changes. A loss of intellectual contribution, the organisation's increasing financial woes and a period of resignations and redundancies created a near crisis situation in late 2003. In February 2005, Charter 88 and the [[New Politics Network]] (NPN) set up a joint working relationship to make the most of their resources in the establishment of the [[Elect the Lords]] campaign. The two organisations decided to formalise their working relationship in 2006, and Unlock Democracy was founded in 2007.

Members of Charter 88 (a pressure group advocating a charter of connected constitutional changes, including a written constitution, electoral reform, freedom of information, etc.)  and NPN (the organisation established after the winding up of the think tank [[Democratic Left (United Kingdom)|Democratic Left]], which was itself the legal successor of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]]) voted to merge the two organisations. NPN Director [[Nina Temple]], among others, attempted to steer the organisation back towards its democratic socialist roots at the 2003 AGM. The movement and subsequent campaigning of the organisation could be seen as remaining truer to its Charter 88 roots than those of the NPN. The NPN strapline, however, "connecting people and politics", was retained.

The merger was completed in November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Unlock Democracy Website - History http://www.unlockdemocracy.org.uk/pages/a-short-history&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campaign goals ==

Unlock Democracy's primary goal is the setting in place of a democratic participative process resulting in a [[written constitution]]. That constitution should explicitly set out the [[separation of powers]] between the [[Executive (government)|Executive]], the [[Legislature]] and the [[Judiciary]]. It should also explicitly determine the divisions and limitations of powers between central and [[local government]] within the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Unlock Democracy Website - Purpose http://www.unlockdemocracy.org.uk/pages/purpose-and-constitution&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlock Democracy has engaged with the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]] Governance of Britain programme.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} It attends party conferences and runs external events such as People and Politics Day. It continues to work with and support other organisations such as [[Local Works]] on the [[Sustainable Communities Act]]. Lastly, it continues its work on democratic reform, including the ''Elect the Lords'' campaign, and the campaign for a review of the [[United Kingdom general elections overview|UK general election]] electoral system.
The current Director, Alex Runswick, sits as a trustee on [[The Reform Foundation]] board and allows their offices to be used to host meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=ReformFDN|author=Reform Foundation|number=537675071360622593|date=26 November 2014|title=Time for a trustees meeting! Thanks to @AlexRunswick from @UnlockDemocracy for letting us use her office.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
