On October 3, 2013, in [[Washington, D.C.]], Miriam Carey, 34, a dental hygienist from [[Stamford, Connecticut]], attempted to drive through a [[White House]] security checkpoint in her black [[Infiniti G37]] coupe, struck a [[United States Secret Service|U.S. Secret Service]] officer, and was chased by the Secret Service to the [[United States Capitol]] where she was fatally shot by law enforcement officers. A young child, Carey's daughter, was found unharmed in the car after it was ultimately stopped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=David Montgomery|title =How Miriam Carey's U-turn at a White House checkpoint led to her death|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=November 26, 2014|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/style/2014/11/26/how-miriam-careys-u-turn-at-a-white-house-checkpoint-led-to-her-death/|accessdate=November 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==White House incident and police response==
At about 2:12&amp;nbsp;p.m., a vehicle driven by Miriam Carey allegedly struck one of the [[White House]] barriers at the intersection of 15th St. NW and [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue NW]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Connecticut woman Miriam Carey suffered 'postpartum depression' after having baby before crashing White House gate, mom says|date=October 3, 2013|work=[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/shots-fired-u-s-capitol-report-article-1.1475378}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 2:13&amp;nbsp;p.m. she drove into a restricted White House checkpoint at 15th and E Streets NW, without authorization and without stopping. When an off-duty U.S. Secret Service officer placed a metal bike rack in her path to block her exit, she struck the bike rack and the off-duty Secret Service officer who was standing behind it with her car, knocking both the bike rack and the officer onto the ground.&lt;ref name="Justice Dept 2014"&gt;{{ cite web | title=U.S. Attorney’s Office Concludes Investigation Into The Death Of Miriam Carey: No Charges To Be Filed In Shooting Near U.S. Capitol | url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/us-attorney-s-office-concludes-investigation-death-miriam-careyno-charges-be-filed |date=July 10, 2014 |publisher=US Department of Justice }}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secret Service attempted to arrest the suspect but she continued to drive the car evasively, colliding with one officer who fell on the hood of the car and rolled off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Police shoot and kill woman outside Capitol after chase | url=http://www.myfoxdc.com/story/23602725/police-shoot-kill-woman-outside-capitol-after-chase | publisher=WTTG My Fox DC | accessdate=October 3, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003220250/http://www.myfoxdc.com/story/23602725/police-shoot-kill-woman-outside-capitol-after-chase | archive-date=October 3, 2013 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/04/us/gunfire-reported-outside-the-capitol.html?hp&amp;_r=1&amp;gwh=79A838CEC6CF20E013DECB8F4D464CEC&amp; | title=Car Chase, White House to Capitol, Has Fatal End | publisher=nytimes.com | accessdate=October 4, 2013 | first=Michael S. | last=Schmidt | date=October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carey then drove 40–80&amp;nbsp;mph down Pennsylvania Avenue, weaving through traffic and ignoring red lights. Police gave chase east on Pennsylvania Avenue for a dozen blocks. The chase then proceeded south on 1st St. NW/SW between [[Peace Circle]] and [[Garfield Circle|Garfield traffic circle]].&lt;ref name="Justice Dept 2014"/&gt;

At Garfield Circle, uniformed and plain clothes Secret Service officers attempted to box the car in with at least five marked vehicles and one unmarked cruiser, on United States Capitol grounds, on the sidewalk on the east side of the circle. Four uniformed and two plainclothes officers proceeded to surround the car on foot with guns drawn, shouting orders.  Carey eluded the box-in by backing into the Secret Service cruiser behind her and driving away, striking a Secret Service officer in the process.  The suspect proceeded north at high speed, circling Peace Circle twice and then proceeding east on [[Constitution Avenue]]. She got as far as the northeast corner of the Capitol grounds, in the vicinity of the [[Hart Senate Office Building]] and came upon U.S Capitol Police Truck Interdiction Point at 2nd St and Maryland Ave NE with raised barriers blocking her path.&lt;ref name="justice.gov"&gt;https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/us-attorney-s-office-concludes-investigation-death-miriam-careyno-charges-be-filed&lt;/ref&gt;  She then made a sharp left and crossed over the median and struck an unmarked police officer's vehicle that had stopped in front of the Hart Senate Office Building. After ignoring multiple police commands, she revved her engine in reverse at a U.S. Capitol Police Officer who was approaching the vehicle from behind.&lt;ref name="justice.gov"/&gt;  As the officer ran towards the median to avoid being struck by Carey's vehicle, he and another officer from the U.S. Secret Service started firing.  The two officers fired nine rounds each at the vehicle. The vehicle crashed into the kiosk and came to a rest.  She was unconscious and did not get out of the vehicle.  No officers fired after the vehicle crashed. It was at that time that officers discovered there was a young child in the vehicle and they safely removed the child from the vehicle.&lt;ref name="justice.gov"/&gt;

A [[shelter in place]] order was issued for the Capitol building during the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Shelter-in-place Lifted at Capitol Building After Gunshots Fired in Area | url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/307463-shelter-in-place-ordered-at-capitol-building-after-gunshots-fired-in-area/?photo=2 | publisher=Epoch Times | accessdate=October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
Carey was brought to [[MedStar Washington Hospital Center]] and pronounced dead. There was an 18-month-old child, believed to be the suspect's daughter, in the back seat of the car. The child was unharmed and taken to a children's hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Shots fired at U.S.Capitol, female suspect killed | url=http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/10/03/20805397-shots-fired-at-uscapitol-female-suspect-killed?lite | publisher=NBC News | accessdate=October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[FBI]] obtained a [[search warrant]] and conducted a search of the woman's home in [[Stamford, Connecticut]] to try to determine the possible motivation of her actions.  As a precaution, a [[bomb squad]] robot was used to enter inside Carey's house at 114 Woodside Green.&lt;ref name=nycbslocal&gt;{{cite web | title=Miriam Carey, Of Stamford, Conn., Shot Dead After Capitol Hill Car Chase | url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/10/03/u-s-capitol-in-lockdown-after-report-of-shots-fired | publisher=[[CBS New York]] | date=October 3, 2013 | accessdate=October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Car chase ends with multiple shots fired near Capitol Hill, causing lockdown | url=http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/15677206-car-chase-ends-with-multiple-shots-fired-near-capitol-hill-causing-lockdown | publisher=allvoices.com | accessdate=October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite news |author1=Cohen, Tom |author2=Gast, Phil | title=Wild car chase ends with suspect shot to death near U.S. Capitol | url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/03/politics/u-s-capitol-shooting-main/index.html?hpt=hp_t1 | publisher=[[CNN]] | accessdate=October 3, 2013 | date=October 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=foxnews&gt;{{cite news | title='Mass Panic': Car chase from White House to Capitol ends with suspect dead | url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/10/03/us-capitol-in-lockdown-reports-shots-fired | publisher=[[FOX News]] | accessdate=October 4, 2013 | date=October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both [[United States Capitol Police|U.S. Capitol Police]] and [[Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia|Washington DC Metropolitan Police]] revealed that they believed that the incident was isolated and not part of a terrorist plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Police say shooting at Capitol an isolated incident, not terrorism | url=http://www.capitalgazette.com/ap/washington/police-say-shooting-at-capitol-an-isolated-incident-not-terrorism/article_8ac22303-55f3-5b20-bfb7-e2b8cc80989e.html | publisher=capitalgazette.com | accessdate=October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miriam Carey's sisters have questioned police actions in this chase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Miriam Carey's Sisters Question Police Actions In Deadly Washington, DC Chase| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/04/miriam-carey-sisters-dc_n_4047108.html| publisher=The Huffington Post| accessdate=October 4, 2013| date=October 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2014, Carey's family officially announced  a [[wrongful death claim]] against the US Capitol Police and the Secret Service but still have never officially filed a lawsuit. The statute of limitations for a wrongful death lawsuit is 3 years. That time has expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/family-of-woman-killed-in-us-capitol-car-chase-suing-police/ |title=Family of woman killed in US Capitol car chase suing police |date=10 February 2014 |publisher=[[CBS News]] |work=Cbsnews.com |accessdate=5 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Secret Service has been criticized by various organizations for its handling of the incident, questioning the use of lethal force for a traffic mixup, citing at least 22 instances in which intruders have successfully breached the White House itself without resulting in a fatality. Carey's U-Turn at the White House check point and her subsequent path away from the building was captured on video by [[Al Hurra TV]] videographer Danny Farkas which was used during the news cycle following her death, as well as evidence in the [[US Attorneys Office]] investigation. Footage from this video has been used to justify claims that Secret Service used excessive force on Carey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/style/2014/11/26/how-miriam-careys-u-turn-at-a-white-house-checkpoint-led-to-her-death/|title=How Miriam Carey’s U-turn at a White House checkpoint led to her death|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Secret Service has since refused to release the video of Carey's death.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/style/2014/11/26/how-miriam-careys-u-turn-at-a-white-house-checkpoint-led-to-her-death/|title=How Miriam Carey’s U-turn at a White House checkpoint led to her death|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 10, 2014, the U.S. Attorney's Office announced that no charges would be filed against the federal officers and agents, stating, "After a thorough review of all the evidence, the U.S. Attorney's Office concluded that the evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers who were involved in the shooting used excessive force or possessed the requisite criminal intent at the time of the events."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=U.S. Attorney's Office Will Not Charge Officers in Death of Woman in Capitol Hill Chase| url=http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/US-Attorneys-Office-No-Prosecution-in-Death-of-Woman-in-Capitol-Hill-Chase-266626031.html| publisher=NBC News| accessdate=July 11, 2014| date=July 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carey's sister attested that she was "not delusional" and had been placed on a one-year medicated treatment plan for her postpartum depression.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt; Dr. Steven Oken, her employer for eight years, described Carey as a "non-political person" who was "always happy".&lt;ref name="GoldmanABC"/&gt; On the day of the incident, Carey was supposed to be taking her daughter to a doctor's appointment in Connecticut.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/04/idella-carey-capitol-chase-suspect-mother_n_4041808.html "Idella Carey, Capitol Chase Suspect's Mother, Says Daughter Was Depressed"], Associated Press, October 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI found two medications in her apartment, as well as a laptop, a flash drive and three nonfunctional cell phones.

On December 10, 2012 Stamford police investigated the complaint and noted that Carey believed herself to be the "Prophet of Stamford" and insisted that Barack Obama had her house under electronic surveillance. These police records were released shortly after a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)]] request made by several media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/local/miriam-carey-police-reports/640/|title=Miriam Carey – police reports|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 20, 2015 a vigil was held in [[Union Square, Manhattan]] as part of the [[Say Her Name]] campaign to recognize the lives and deaths of black women killed or injured by police.

'''Abbad ibn Bishr''' ({{lang-ar|'''عباد بن بشر'''}}) (c.587&amp;ndash;632) was a companion of the [[Islam]]ic prophet [[Muhammad]]. He was known for his devotion to worship, knowledge and courage in battle.

He was enthralled by the [[Qur'an]] after first hearing it recited by [[Musab ibn Umayr]] before the [[Hijra (Islam)|hijra]] when Abbad was about fifteen years old. The Qur'an had a special place in his heart, and he became renowned for his recitation so much so that he was known among the companions as ''the friend of the Qur'an''. Muhammad's wife [[Aishah bint Abi Bakr]] once said: "There are three persons among the Ansar whom no one could excel in virtue: Sad ibn Muadh, Usayd ibn Khudayr, and Abbad ibn Bishr."

==Life==
In 625 (4 years after [[Hijri year|hijra]]), Muhammad received news that the [[Najd]] tribes were planning to attack [[Medina]]. In preemption, he assembled a detachment of over four hundred men including Abbad ibn Bishr. Arriving at Najd, they found the men of the tribes had fled to the hills. When the time of ''salatul asr'' came, Muhammad feared an ambush so he arranged the Muslims in ranks and divided them into two groups and performed ''salatul-khawf'' (the Prayer of Fear). Seeing their disciplined ranks, the hostile tribesmen became uneasy. After Muhammad made his presence known, he felt a conflict was unnecessary and decided to depart. On the way back to Medina, the Muslims pitched camp in a valley for a night. The responsibility of guarding the camp was assumed by Abbad ibn Bishr and [[Ammar bin Yasir]], whom Muhammad had paired as brothers following his arrival in Medina.

After reaching the mouth of the valley, Abbad noticed that his brother was tired and volunteered to keep watch for the first half of the night and allow him to rest. Since there appeared to be no imposing threats, Abbad stood up for prayer. While absorbed in recitation, a stranger stalked the outskirts of the valley in search of Muhammad and his followers. He was among those who had planned to attack Muhammad, but fled into the mountains.

From a distance, the man saw the figure of Abbad and knew the Muslim force must be inside the valley. Silently he drew his bow, and fired an arrow which embedded itself in Abbad's flesh. Calmly, Abbad removed the arrow and went on with his recitation, still absorbed in his [[Salat]]. The attacker shot two more arrows, which also found their mark. Abbad pulled them out and finished his recitation. Weak and in pain, he stretched out his hand while still in prostration and shook his sleeping companion. Abbad continued the prayer to its end and then said: "Get up and stand guard in my place. I have been wounded."

Ammar stood up, and seeing them both, the attacker fled into the darkness. Ammar turned to Abbad, blood flowing from his wounds, and asked "Why didn't you wake me when you were hit by the first arrow?"

Abbad replied "I was reciting verses of the Qur'an which filled my soul with awe and I did not want to cut short the recitation. Muhammad had commanded me to commit this surah to memory. Death would have been dearer to me than that the recitation of this surah should be interrupted."

==Death==
Abbad was killed fighting the forces of Musailma at the [[battle of Yamamah]] in 632. Before the battle, he observed the lack of mutual confidence between the Muhajirin and [[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]], realized the campaign would fail unless they were separately regimented, and distinguished those who bore their responsibility and were steadfast in combat. When the battle commenced, Abbad ibn Bishr stood on a mound and shouted:

''"O Ansar, distinguish yourselves among men. Destroy your scabbards. And do not forsake Islam."''

Abbad gathered about four hundred men from the Ansar and launched an offensive into the enemy ranks, forcing their retreat to the ''garden of death'', where Abbad ibn Bishr was mortally wounded. Although the battle was a victory for the Muslims, twelve hundred of their force were killed. So numerous were Abbad’s wounds, that he was hardly recognizable. Although he passed at a young age, Abbad contributed much to the strength of the early Muslim community, and his life and martyrdom continue to inspire followers of [[Islam]] the world over.

An '''abortive flower'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Smith | first=Arma A. | title=Abortive Flower Buds of Trillium | journal=Botanical Gazette | year=1896 | jstor=2464003 | volume=22 | issue=5 | pages=402–403 | issn=0006-8071 | doi=10.1086/327429}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[flower]] that has a [[stamen]] but an under developed, or no [[pistil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://webstersdictionary1828.com/Dictionary/abortive|title=Websters Dictionary 1828 - Webster's Dictionary 1828 - abortive|website=Websters Dictionary 1828|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It falls without producing fruit or seeds, due to its inability to [[wikt:fructify|fructify]]. Flowers require both male and female organs to reproduce, and the pistils and ovary serve as female organs, while the stamens are considered male organs.

Illustrative examples include ''[[Urginea Nagarjunae|Urginea nagarjunae]]'' and ''[[Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae]]''.

==== Causes of Flower Abortion ====
Pollinated flowers and fruits can abort selectively. It could be because of the order of pollination, the number of developing seeds, pollen source, or some combination of these.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephenson|first=A G|date=1981|title=Flower and Fruit Abortion: Proximate Causes and Ultimate Functions|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.es.12.110181.001345|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|language=en|volume=12|issue=1|pages=253–279|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.12.110181.001345|issn=0066-4162|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flowers and fruits can also abort because of outside causes like insufficient light, unsuitable photo-period, high temperature, nutrient deficiency, [[ethylene]], [[Drought tolerance|drought stress]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gpnmag.com/article/causes-of-flower-bud-abortion/|title=Causes of Flower Bud Abortion - Greenhouse Product News|work=Greenhouse Product News|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is research to suggest that random selective abortions based on the timing of fertilization could increase the genetic quality of seeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ezoe|first=Hideo|date=2018-06-09|title=Excessive flower production as an anti-predator strategy: when is random flower abortion favored?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10144-018-0625-6|journal=Population Ecology|language=en|volume=60|issue=3|pages=275–286|doi=10.1007/s10144-018-0625-6|issn=1438-3896}}&lt;/ref&gt; The age of the flower also has an effect on the percentage of abortion. The older the flower, the more likely it is to be aborting the fruit or pollen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=Nesta|date=1924|title=On The Determination of the Percentage of Abortive Pollen in Plants|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/2/1/65|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=2|pages=65-73|via=The Company of Biologists Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abu 'Afak''' ({{lang-ar|أبو عفك}}, died c. 624) was a [[Jew]]ish [[poet]] who lived in the [[Hijaz]] region (today [[Saudi Arabia]]). Abu 'Afak did not [[religious conversion|convert]] to [[Islam]] and was vocal about his opposition to [[Muhammad]]. He became a significant political enemy of Muhammad.

As an elderly man, Abu 'Afak Arwan wrote a politically charged poem against Muhammad and his followers that is preserved in the [[Sirah Rasul Allah|Sira]]. Muhammad then allegedly called for Abu 'Afak's death, and Salim ibn Umayr killed him. The affair was recorded by [[Ibn Ishaq]] in "''Sirat Rasul Allah''" (The Life of the Prophet of God), the oldest biography of Muhammad.

==Sources==

===Ibn Ishaq's account===

The following is an excerpt from [[Alfred Guillaume]]'s translation of Ibn Ishaq's [[prophetic biography]], chapter "Salim b. Umayr's expedition to kill Abu Afak".&lt;blockquote&gt;Abu Afak was one of the B. Amr b. Auf of the B. Ubayda clan. He showed his disaffection when the apostle [Muhammad] killed al-Harith b. Suwayd b. Samit and said:
::Long have I lived but never have I seen
::An assembly or collection of people
::More faithful to their undertaking
::And their allies when called upon
::Than the sons of Qayla when they assembled,
::Men who overthrew mountains and never submitted,
::A rider who came to them split them in two (saying)
::"Permitted", "Forbidden", of all sorts of things.
::Had you believed in glory or kingship
::You would have followed Tubba.&lt;ref&gt;Tubba was a ruler from Yemen who invaded the [[Hijaz]] and was resisted by the Qaylites&lt;/ref&gt;

The apostle [Muhammad] said, "Who will deal with this rascal for me?" Whereupon Salim b. Umayr, brother of B. Amr b. Auf, one of the "weepers", went forth and killed him. Umama b. Muzayriya said concerning that:

::You gave the lie to God's religion and the man Ahmad [the prophet]!
::By him who was your father, evil is the son he produced!
::A [[hanif]] gave you a thrust in the night saying
::Take that, Abu Afak, in spite of your age!
::Though I knew whether it was man or jinn
::Who slew you in the dead of night (I would say naught).&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Ishaq, ''Sirat Rasul Allah'', p.675&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Waqidi’s Account===

The following is an excerpt from Rizwi Faizer’s translation of [[Al-Waqidi|Waqidi’s]] military history, chapter “The Expedition to Kill Abu ‘Afak”.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sa’id b. Muhammad related to us from ‘Umara b. Ghaziyya, and Abu Mus’ab related to us from Isma’il b. Mus’ab b. Isma’il b. Zayd b. Thabit from his elders, who said: “There was a sheikh of the Banu ‘Amr ibn ‘Awf called ‘Abu Afak. He was an old man who had reached one hundred and twenty years when the Prophet arrived in Medina. He provoked the enmity of the Prophet and did not enter Islam. When the Messenger of God went out to Badr and returned, and God granted him victory, Abu ‘Afak envited him and opposed him, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;‘Long have I lived but never have I seen
An assembly or collection of people,
more minds that came to a commitment swiftly when called.
A rider dispossessed them of their affairs,
splitting them into forbidden and permitted.
If it was kingship that you believed in,
you would have followed Tubba’.’&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Salim b. ‘Umayr said – and he was one of the weepers of the Banu Najjar – ‘I vowed that I would kill Abu Afak or die in the attempt. I waited for a heedless moment.’ Then, one summer’s night, as Abu Afak slept in the courtyard with the Banu ‘Amr b. ‘Awf, Salim b. ‘Umayr approached, and pressed the sword upon his liver until it entered his bed. The enemy of God screamed. Those among the people who heard his words returned to him. They entered his place and buried him. They said, ‘Who killed him? By God, if we learn who killed him, we will surely kill him for it.’ Al-Nahdiyya, a Muslim woman, said these verses about that.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;‘You lied about the religion of God and the man Ahmad.
By the life of he who produced you, miserable is what he produced.
A Hanif gave you, at the end of the night, a thrust.
Abu ‘Afak, take it inspite of your age.
Indeed if I knew who killed you in the dead of night
Whether man or Jinn, I would not say.’”&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ma’an b. ‘Umar related to me saying: “Ibn Ruqaysh informed me that Abu ‘Afak was killed in Shawwal, the twentieth month AH.”&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad ibn Umar al-Waqidi. ''Kitab al-Maghazi''. Translated by Faizer, R., Ismail, A., &amp; Tayob, A. K. (2011). ''The Life of Muhammad'', pp. 86-87. London &amp; New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Al Waqidi was said by many Islamic Hadith scholars to be an unreliable source of information.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Dhahabi, Siyar A'lam al-Nubala', vol. 9, pg. 462&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ibn Sa'd's accounts===

Another description of this story comes from [[ibn Sa'd al-Baghdadi#The Major Classes|The Major Classes]] by [[ibn Sa'd al-Baghdadi]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Then occurred the "sariyyah" [raid] of Salim Ibn Umayr al-Amri against Abu Afak, the Jew, in [the month of] [[Shawwal]] in the beginning of the twentieth month [[Islamic calendar|from the hijra]], of the Apostle of Allah. Abu Afak, was from Banu Amr Ibn Awf, and was an old man who had attained the age of one hundred and twenty years. He was a Jew, and used to instigate the people against the Apostle of Allah, and composed (satirical) verses [about Muhammad].

Salim Ibn Umayr who was one of the great weepers and who had participated in Badr, said, "I take a vow that I shall either kill Abu Afak or die before him. He waited for an opportunity until a hot night came, and Abu Afak slept in an open place. Salim Ibn Umayr knew it, so he placed the sword on his liver and pressed it till it reached his bed. The enemy of Allah screamed and the people who were his followers, rushed to him, took him to his house and interred him."&lt;ref&gt;[[ibn Sa'd al-Baghdadi#The Major Classes|The book of The Major Classes]], Volume 2, (2), p.32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ibn Sa'd gives a second account, which cites his sources.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Muhammad ibn ‘Umar [Waqidi] reported from Sa’id ibn Muhammad az-Zuraqi from ‘Umara ibn Ghaziya that Abu Mus’ab Isma’il ibn Mus’ab ibn Isma’il ibn Zayd ibn Thabit related from his shaykhs that Abu ‘Afak was an old man of the Banu ‘Amr ibn Awf. He reached the age of one hundred and twenty and he heard about the Prophet but he did not enter Islam. Salim ibn ‘Umayr vowed to kill him and sought him until he killed him. That was at the command of the Prophet. Muhammad ibn ‘Umar [Waqidi] reported from Ma’n ibn ‘Umar from Ibn Ruqaysh of the Banu Asad ibn Khuzayma that Abu ‘Afak was killed in Shawwal at the beginning of the twentieth month of the Hijra [late March/early April 624].&lt;ref&gt;ibn Sa'd al-Baghdadi. ''The Book of the Major Classes'', Volume 3. Translated by Bewley, A. (2013). ''The Companions of Badr'', p. 376. London: Ta-Ha Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many criticize this chain as it contains al-Waqidi, who has been regarded as "weak" by many Hadith scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Waqar Akbar Cheema&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aecium''' (plural '''aecia''') is a specialised reproductive structure found in some [[Rust (fungus)|rust]]s and [[Smut (fungus)|smut]]s which produces [[aeciospore]]s. In some literature aecia are also referred to as "cluster cups".

An aecidium (plural aecidia) is an aecium in which the spores are always formed in chains and enclosed in a cup-shaped [[peridium]].

He is a leading researcher in [[Stem cell|stem cell biology]], specialising in single cell techniques. In 2012 he started as director of the [[Hubrecht Institute]] and was awarded two times an ERC Advanced Grant, in 2012 and in 2017. In 2014 he became a member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] ([[KNAW]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.knaw.nl/nl/leden/leden/11404 |title=Alexander van Oudenaarden |language=Dutch |publisher=[[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] |date= |accessdate=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Spinoza Prize]] in 2017.

== Biography ==
Van Oudenaarden was born 19 March 1970, in [[Zuidland]], a small town in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] province of [[South Holland]]. He studied at the [[Delft University of Technology]], where he obtained an [[Master of Science|MSc]] degree in Materials Science and Engineering (''[[cum laude]]'') and an MSc degree in Physics, both in 1993, and subsequently a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree in Physics (''cum laude'') in 1998 in experimental condensed matter physics, under the supervision of professor [[J.E. Mooij]]. He received the Andries Miedema Award (best doctoral research in the field of condensed matter physics in the Netherlands) for his thesis on "Quantum vortices and quantum interference effects in circuits of small tunnel junctions". In 1998, he moved to [[Stanford University]], where he was a postdoctoral researcher in the departments of Biochemistry and of Microbiology &amp; Immunology, working on force generation of polymerising actin filaments in the [[J.A. Theriot|Theriot]] lab and 
a postdoctoral researcher in the department of Chemistry, working on [[Micropatterning]] of supported phospholipid bi-layers in the [[S.G. Boxer|Boxer]] lab. In 2000 he joined the department of Physics at MIT as an assistant professor, was tenured in 2004 and is now a full professor.  In 2001 he received the [[National Science Foundation|NSF]] CAREER award, and was both an [[Sloan Fellowship|Alfred Sloan Research Fellow]] and the [[W. M. Keck Foundation|Keck Career Development]] Career Development Professor in Biomedical Engineering. In 2012 Alexander became the director of the Hubrecht Institute as the successor of [[Hans Clevers]]. In 2017 he received his second ''ERC Advanced Grant'', for his study titled "a single-cell genomics approach integrating gene expression, lineage, and physical interactions". He was awarded the [[Spinoza Prize]] in 2017.

He is married and has three children.

'''Allergan, Inc.''' was an American global [[pharmaceutical]] company focused on eye care, neurosciences, medical dermatology, medical aesthetics, breast enhancement, obesity intervention and urologics. Allergan, Inc. was formed in 1948, incorporated in 1950 and became a public company in 1970. It ceased operation in 2015 when it was acquired by Irish-based [[Activis plc]] (itself a 2013 U.S. [[Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Corporate tax inversions|tax inversion]] to Ireland), who then renamed the group as [[Allergan plc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2015/07/30/actavis-allergan-timeline/|title=From Actavis to Allergan: One pharma company's wild dealmaking journey|publisher=[[Forbes Magazine]]|date=30 July 2015|quote=For a master class in mergers and acquisitions, one need only look at the company formerly known as Actavis. Now called Allergan, after its $70 billion acquisition of that maker of Botox last fall, the pharmaceutical firm has undertaken a dizzying series of deals in just the last few years, reinventing and renaming itself in a fashion that might make the artist formerly known as The Artist Formerly Known As Prince proud.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history ==
The company traces its roots back to 1948 and pharmacist Gavin S. Herbert, who in 1950 established Allergan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Allergan focused on the discovery and development of novel formulations for specialty markets, as well as intimate collaboration with physicians and the scientific community. 1953 saw Allergan producing eye drops and formulating new products such as the first cortisone eye drop to treat allergic inflammation and the first ophthalmic steroid decongestant.&lt;ref name="allergan.co.uk1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allergan.co.uk/AboutUs/CompanyHistory.aspx|title=Company History|work=allergan.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Acquisitions==
Allergan became a publicly traded company in 1970 and was acquired by [[SmithKline Beckman]] for $259 million in 1980.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-07-27/business/fi-352_1_smithkline-beckman|title=Shareholders OK SmithKline Deal Spinning Off Beckman, Allergan|last=Berkman|first=Leslie|date=1989-07-27|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-02-12|work=|language=en-US|issn=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After generating $756 million in revenue and $80 million in profit in 1988, Allergan was spun-off by SmithKline Beckman in 1989.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In July 2002, the Allergan ophthalmic surgical and contact lens care businesses were spun-off to create a new company, [[Advanced Medical Optics]]. In 2003, Allergan's flagship product, [[Botulinum toxin|Botox]], was the focus of a high-profile lawsuit and media scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/sep/22/health/he-botox22|title=Taking aim at Botox|last=Piccalo|first=Gina|date=2003-09-22|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=2016-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 2006, Allergan acquired Inamed Corporation for $3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QgoAz-FYv48C&amp;pg=PT151&amp;lpg=PT151&amp;dq=allergan+inamed+march+2006&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Rnsji0Oysz&amp;sig=X-tAtxP_nlpkwputuIQnEgQDLqA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiL2onpgYzSAhUOwWMKHehfAAAQ6AEISTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=allergan%20inamed%20march%202006&amp;f=false|title=The Almanac of American Employers 2008|last=Plunkett|first=Jack|accessdate=2017-02-12|publisher=Plunkett Research, Ltd.|year=2007|isbn=9781593920951|location=|pages=|language=English|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 1, 2013, the company acquired [[MAP Pharmaceuticals Inc.]], a development-stage company mainly researching the treatment of [[migraine]] and other oral drugs in Neurology for approximately $958 million. The principal products of this sub-company are under review with the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/finance?cid=630|title=Allergan, Inc.:  quotes &amp; news - Google Finance|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013, the company sold its obesity intervention business to [[Apollo Endosurgery, Inc.]], for a cash payment of $75 million and a $15 million minority equity interest in Apollo Endosurgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/allergan-inc-completes-sale-of-obesity-intervention-business-2013-12-02|title=Allergan, Inc. Completes Sale of Obesity Intervention Business}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014 [[Actavis|Actavis, plc]] announced its intention to acquire Allergan, Inc., the manufacturer of Botox&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-30084329|title=BBC News - Actavis to buy Botox-maker Allergan $66bn|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completion of the deal would increase its market capitalization to $147 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-11-17/actavis-surges-to-top-drugmaker-ranks-with-plan-to-broaden-sales.html|title=Actavis Surges to Top Drugmaker Ranks With Acquisitions|author=Caroline Chen|work=Bloomberg.com|date=2014-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/cfo/2014/11/17/the-morning-ledger-actavis-could-again-evade-treasurys-grasp-for-post-inversion-tax-break/|title=The Morning Ledger: Actavis Could Again Evade Treasury’s Grasp for Post-Inversion Tax Break|work=WSJ | first=James|last=Willhite|date=2014-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 17, 2015, [[Actavis|Actavis, plc]] completed the acquisition of Allergan, Inc. in a cash and equity transaction valued at approximately $70.5 billion, and was folded into that company. The combination created a $23 billion diversified global pharmaceutical company with commercial reach across 100 countries. In June 2015, [[Actavis|Actavis, plc]] officially changed its name to [[Allergan, plc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Actavis plc is now Allergan plc|url=http://www.actavis.com/NEWS/News/Thomson-Reuters/Actavis-plc-is-now-Allergan-plc|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June Allergan, Inc. announced it would acquire [[Kythera Biopharmaceuticals]] for around $2.1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/allergan-to-acquire-kythera-for-2-1b/81251398/|title=Allergan to Acquire Kythera for $2.1B|work=GEN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attempted acquisition by Valeant Pharmaceuticals===

On April 22, 2014, details were released by [[Valeant Pharmaceuticals]] and hedge fund CEO, [[Bill Ackman]], about a $46 billion (CAD) offer presented to Allergan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Valeant, Bill Ackman bid $45B for Botox-maker Allergan|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/valeant-bill-ackman-bid-45b-for-botox-maker-allergan-1.2617495|publisher=Canadian Associated Press / CBC|accessdate=22 April 2014|date=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valeant proposed to exchange $48.30 in cash and 0.83 shares of Valeant per Allergan share. Allergan, Inc. stockholders would own 43 per cent of the combined company. This bid was rejected by Allergan as being too risky, claiming Valeant's business model of serial acquisitions and low organic growth being unsustainable. Soon after Valeant released a statement saying a new offer will be presented May 28, 2014, where it emerged that Valeant had increased their offer to $49.4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Valeant raises offer for Allergan|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-28/valeant-raises-takeover-offer-for-allergan-with-more-cash.html|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=29 May 2014|first=Phil|last=Serafino|date=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 31 the offer was revised and increased to $53.3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Valeant raises offer for Allergan for second time|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-30/valeant-raises-takeover-offer-for-allergan-for-second-time.html|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=31 May 2014|first=Sonali|last=Basak|date=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 18, Valeant began its tender offer for a hostile takeover of Allergan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-18/valeant-begins-tender-offer-for-allergan-hostile-takeover.html|title=Valeant Begins Tender Offer for Allergan Hostile Takeover|date=18 June 2014|work=Bloomberg|accessdate=7 October 2014|first=Sonali|last=Basak}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 27, 2014, Valeant and [[Pershing Square Capital Management]] asked a Chancery Judge to set a trial for September 24, 2014 to decide on whether Valeant and Pershing had properly secured enough support from Allergan shareholders to force a meeting of investors to consider replacing a majority of the company’s directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-26/allergan-says-valeant-seeking-hearing-on-shareholder-meeting-1-.html|title=Allergan Says Valeant Seeking Hearing on Shareholder Meeting|author=Jef Feeley|date=27 August 2014|work=Bloomberg|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day Allergan announced that they had set a December shareholder vote to decide whether the company should replace part of the board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-26/allergan-sets-december-shareholder-vote-on-valeant-bid.html|title=Allergan Sets December Shareholder Vote on Valeant Bid|date=27 August 2014|work=Bloomberg|accessdate=7 October 2014|first=Cynthia|last=Koons}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the afternoon of August 27, ''Bloomberg'' reported that Valeant and Pershing Square had won their case with the Chancery Judge setting an October 6 date for the aforementioned trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-27/valeant-ackman-win-bid-to-fast-track-allergan-case.html|title=Valeant, Ackman Win Bid to Fast-Track Allergan Case|author=Jef Feeley|date=27 August 2014|work=Bloomberg|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 17, 2014, [[Actavis|Actavis, plc]] announced it would acquire [[Allergan]] in a [[White knight (business)|white knight]] bid for approximately $66 billion, putting an end to Valeant's hostile takeover attempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-11-17/actavis-to-buy-allergan-for-66-billion-tops-valeant-bid.html|title=Actavis to Buy Allergan for $66 Billion, Tops Valeant Bid|author=David Welch|work=Bloomberg.com|date=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety reports ==
In 2011, FDA reported issues in the investigation of safety of silicone gel-filled breast implants. However, the company announced later the reassurance to patients of the safety and exclusion of its drugs from the investigated breast implant devices, stating that all of its products are above safety standards around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agn.client.shareholder.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=635213|title=Allergan - Allergan Reassures Patients and Surgeons of the Quality and Safety of Its Breast Implant Devices Sold and Distributed Worldwide|work=shareholder.com|access-date=2014-02-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222054136/http://agn.client.shareholder.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=635213|archive-date=2014-02-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine (AAHPM)''' is a professional organization for physicians specializing in [[Hospice and Palliative Medicine]],  headquartered in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. Membership is open to all health care providers committed to improving the care of patients with serious or life-threatening illnesses. AAHPM has more than 5,200 members; 82 percent are physicians, 12 percent are nurses or other health care providers and 6 percent are residents or students.

AAHPM started a patient [http://www.palliativedoctors.org website] to help educate the public on the importance of hospice and palliative care.

== Background ==
AAHPM was founded in 1988, with 250 charter members, as the Academy of Hospice Physicians (The Academy).  [[Josefina Magno|Josefina B. Magno]], MD, president of the [[International Hospice Institute and College|International Hospice Institute]] and Gerald Holman, MD, director of St. Anthony’s Hospice and Life Enrichment Center met to discuss the formation of The Academy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.josemariaescriva.info/article/the-late-josefina-magno2c-md2c-hero-to-terminally-patients-and-their-families&lt;/ref&gt;

During the next few years, members worked to build the association by educating people on the importance of hospice care through newsletters and position statements. The Academy worked on publishing a quarterly newsletter and a physician self-study series. In 1994, The Academy was awarded a grant from the [[National Cancer Institute]] to develop a book series.

The American Board of Hospice and Palliative Medicine was incorporated by the Academy in May 1996. They offered their first certifying exam later that year. The Academy gained approval from the [[Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education]] (ACCME), which allowed it to provide [[Continuing medical education|CME]] to physicians.  The Academy also changed its name to the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine (AAHPM).

By the turn of the century, AAHPM’s membership grew, and it secured a seat in the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) House of Delegates.

AAHPM’s strong presence and position on highly controversial subjects has made the Academy a prominent voice in hospice and palliative care. In 2003, AAHPM was able to develop its infrastructure and establish the College of Palliative Care with a $1.2-million grant from Open Society Institute’s Project on Death in America.

== Position statements ==
AAHPM tracks critical issues and provides members with the information, tools, and training required to be effective advocates for their patients and their practice. In recent years, AAHPM has promoted policies that would increase the number of palliative medicine specialists, expand support for research, and improve access to palliative care services for patients with serious illness and their families.

== Publications ==
The Academy publishes a variety of resources for hospice and palliative care professionals, including: UNIPAC Self-Study Program: A Resource for Hospice and Palliative Care Professionals, Primer of Palliative Care, Hospice Medical Director Manual, and online practice tests: HPM PASS, HPM FAST and HMD PREP.

==Educational offerings==
AAHPM, together with the Hospice and Palliative Nurses Association (HPNA), sponsors an educational conference each year. The Annual Assembly provides disease updates and sessions on the latest advances in clinical research, cultural, ethical and legal, psychological, social, and spiritual aspects of care for physicians, nurses, social workers, pharmacists, and others who practice hospice and palliative care.

Annual Assembly Sites:
*March 14–17, 2018: Boston, Massachusetts
*March 13–16, 2019: Orlando, Florida
*March 18–21, 2020: San Diego, California

AAHPM also offers educational courses during the year which focus on topics of interest to hospice and palliative care professionals.

'''Andrew Edward Faulkner''' was an American politician and businessman who served as a member of the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] from 1947 until his death in 1951.

==Early life==
Faulkner was born on September 23, 1913 in [[Salem, Massachusetts]]. He attended grammar and high school in [[Beverly, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="Public Officers"&gt;{{cite book|title=Public officers of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 1949-1950|url=https://archive.org/stream/publicofficersof19491950bost#page/164/mode/2up/search/beverly|accessdate=June 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After serving in the [[United States Navy]], Faulkner ran a filling station until 1948, when he started a fuel oil business.&lt;ref name="Obituary" /&gt;

==Political career==
Faulkner served three years on the Beverly Board of Aldermen before serving terms in the Massachusetts House of Representatives.&lt;ref name="Public Officers" /&gt;

==Death==
On November 15, 1951, Faulkner used an alias to check into a low-rate rooming house in [[Scollay Square]]. He was given a room on the third floor and a few minutes later was observed opening the window, crawling out onto the fire escape and walking to the end of it. He then appeared to jump five feet across and ten feet below to another fire escape of an adjacent building. Faulkner held onto the fire escape for a moment before falling 35 feet to his death. The Medical Examiner ruled Faulkner's death as accidental, based on cuts and bruises on Faulkner's hands that showed he had tried to save himself. Police ruled out the theory of robbery (Faulkner was said to have collected $1,000 prior to his death, however police stated they were confident that the $279 found in his pockets was all the money he had in his position) and investigators instead believed that he had been feeling ill and had gone out on the fire escape to get some air before accidentally falling off.&lt;ref name="Obituary"&gt;{{cite news|title=Legislator Killed in Fall From Scollay Sq.

An '''antheridium''' is a [[haploid]] structure or organ producing and containing male [[gamete]]s (called ''antherozoids'' or [[sperm]]). The plural form is '''antheridia''', and a structure containing one or more antheridia is called an '''androecium'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Generic concepts within hornworts: Historical review, contemporary insights and future directions |author=D.

Antheridia are present in the [[gametophyte]] phase of [[cryptogam]]s like [[bryophyte]]s and [[fern]]s. Many [[alga]]e and some [[Fungus|fungi]], for example [[ascomycete]]s and [[water mould]]s, also have antheridia during their [[reproductive]] stages. In [[gymnosperm]]s and [[angiosperm]]s, the male gametophytes have been reduced to [[Pollen|pollen grains]] and in most of these the antheridia have been reduced to a single [[generative cell]] within the pollen grain. During [[pollination]], this generative cell divides and gives rise to sperm cells.

The female counterpart to the antheridium in cryptogams is the [[archegonium]], and in flowering plants is the [[gynoecium]].

An antheridium typically consists of sterile [[cell (biology)|cell]]s and spermatogenous [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]. The sterile cells may form a central support structure or surround the spermatogenous tissue as a protective jacket. The spermatogenous cells give rise to [[spermatid]]s via mitotic [[cell division]]. In some [[bryophyte]]s, the antheridium is borne on an '''''antheridiophore''''', a stalk-like structure that carries the antheridium at its apex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Shimamura|first=Masaki|date=2016-02-01|title=Marchantia polymorpha: Taxonomy, Phylogeny and Morphology of a Model System|url=https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/57/2/230/2460945/Marchantia-polymorpha-Taxonomy-Phylogeny-and#41305768|journal=Plant and Cell Physiology|language=en|volume=57|issue=2|pages=230–256|doi=10.1093/pcp/pcv192|issn=0032-0781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:STS-103 Reflection on astronaut's visor.jpg|thumb]]
[[File:Laurel van der Wal.jpg|thumb|[[Laurel van der Wal]], head of bioastronautics at [[Space Technology Laboratories]], 1961]]
'''Bioastronautics''' is a specialty area of [[biology|biological]] and [[astronautics|astronautical]] research which encompasses numerous aspects of biological, behavioral, and medical concern governing humans and other living organisms in a [[space flight]] environment; and includes design of payloads, [[Space colonization|space habitat]]s, and [[life support]] systems.  In short, it spans the study and support of life in [[space]].

Bioastronautics includes many similarities with its sister discipline [[astronautical hygiene]]; they both study the hazards that humans may encounter during a space flight.  However, astronautical hygiene differs in many respects e.g. in this discipline, once a hazard is identified, the exposure risks are then assessed and the most effective measures determined to prevent or control exposure and thereby protect the health of the astronaut.  Astronautical hygiene is an applied scientific discipline that requires knowledge and experience of many fields including bioastronautics, space medicine, ergonomics etc.  The skills of astronautical hygiene are already being applied for example, to characterise moon dust and design the measures to mitigate exposure during lunar exploration, to develop accurate chemical monitoring techniques and use the results in the setting SMACs.    

Of particular interest from a biological perspective are the effects of reduced gravitational force felt by inhabitants of spacecraft.  Often referred to as "[[microgravity]]", the lack of sedimentation, buoyancy, or convective flows in fluids results in a more quiescent cellular and intercellular environment primarily driven by chemical gradients.  Certain functions of organisms are mediated by gravity, such as [[gravitropism]] in plant roots and negative gravitropism in plant stems, and without this stimulus growth patterns of organisms onboard spacecraft often diverge from their terrestrial counterparts.  Additionally, metabolic energy normally expended in overcoming the force of gravity remains available for other functions.  This may take the form of accelerated growth in organisms as diverse as worms like ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]'' to miniature [[parasitoid wasp]]s such as ''Spangia endius''.  It may also be used in the augmented production of [[secondary metabolites]] such as the vinca alkaloids [[Vincristine]] and [[Vinblastine]] in the [[rosy periwinkle]] (''[[Catharanthus roseus]]''), whereby space grown specimens often have higher concentrations of these constituents that on earth are present in only trace amounts.

From an engineering perspective, facilitating the delivery and exchange of air, food, and water, and the processing of waste products is also challenging.  The transition from expendable physicochemical methods to sustainable bioregenerative systems that function as a robust miniature ecosystem is another goal of bioastronautics in facilitating long duration space travel.  Such systems are often termed [[Closed Ecological Life Support Systems]] (CELSS).

From a medical perspective, long duration space flight also has physiological impacts on astronauts.  Accelerated bone decalcification, similar to [[osteopenia]] and [[osteoporosis]] on Earth, is just one such condition.  Study of these effects is useful not only in advancing methods for safe habitation of and travel through space, but also in uncovering ways to more effectively treat the related terrestrial ailments.

[[NASA]]'s [[Johnson Space Center]] in Houston, Texas maintains a Bioastronautics Library ([http://library.jsc.nasa.gov/libweb/Library%20Web%20Documents/Library%20map.pdf map]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}). The one-room facility provides a collection of textbooks, reference books, conference proceedings, and academic journals related to bioastronautics topics. Because the library is located within secure government property (not part of [[Space Center Houston]], the official visitors center of JSC), it is not generally accessible to the public.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2451">In [[criminology]], '''brutalization''' refers to a hypothesized cause-and-effect relationship between [[execution]]s and an increase in the [[homicide]] rate. This hypothesis proposes this relationship occurs because executions diminish the public's respect for life. Such an effect represents the opposite of a [[Deterrence (legal)|deterrent]] effect.&lt;ref name=sf&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=D.

He was appointed on 27 March 1874 by [[Alexander Mackenzie (politician)|Alexander Mackenzie]]. He served until his resignation on 4 February 1875. He’s the first member of the family Panet-Raymond. The family name of her mother was Raymond and his father was Panet.

==Education==
He was born in Quebec on November 27, 1829. He was the son of The Hon. [[Philippe Panet]], late Judge of the [[Queen's Bench|Court of Queen's Bench]], [[Lower Canada]]. His mother, Luce Casgrain, was the daughter and co-heiress of Pierre Casgrain (1771-1828) J.P., Seigneur of La Bouteillerie. Panet was a nephew of politicians [[Louis Panet]] and [[Charles Panet]]. He was educated at the Quebec Seminary and at the Jesuit College in Georgetown, Quebec. He studied law in Quebec with his relation The Hon. [[Jean-Thomas Taschereau (jurist)|Jean-Thomas Taschereau]], late of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]. He was called to the Bar of Lower Canada in 1854.

==Family==

He was married three times and had sixteen children. The former Panet House, was built in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]] by Colonel Charles-Eugène Panet, Deputy Minister of Militia and Defence, in 1876. In 1986, the Panet house became part of the King Edward Avenue Heritage Conservation District. The house is currently the Embassy of the Republic of Angola.

==Career==
He practiced law for three years in Quebec (1854–1857). He was [[coroner]] for the City and District of Quebec for fourteen years. He was a Lieutenant-Colonel of the 9th Voltigeurs de Québec (1869–80). In 1886, he was gazetted a Colonel in the Canadian militia. In 1874 he was called to the Senate of Canada. In 1875, he resigned his seat in the Senate to accept the position of deputy minister of militia and defence, (1875–98). In 1888, he presented to Parliament a "Report upon the suppression of the rebellion in the North-West Territories and matters in connection therewith" [[Department of Militia and Defence]].

He retained this position until shortly before his death at Ottawa on November 22, 1898.&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/encyclopedia/CharlesEugenePanet-QuebecHistory.htm Panet, Charles Eugène The Quebec History Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==
#''Facial droop:'' Have the person smile or show his or her teeth. If one side doesn't move as well as the other so it seems to droop, that could be a sign of a stroke.
#* Normal: Both sides of face move equally
#* Abnormal: One side of face does not move as well as the other (or at all)
#''Arm drift:''  Have the person close his or her eyes and hold his or her arms straight out in front with palms facing up for about 10 seconds. If one arm does not move, or one arm winds up drifting down more than the other, that could be a sign of a stroke.
#* Normal: Both arms move equally or not at all
#* Abnormal: One arm does not move, or one arm drifts down compared with the other side
#''Speech:''  Have the person say, "You can't teach an old dog new tricks," or some other simple, familiar saying. If the person slurs the words, gets some words wrong, or is unable to speak, that could be a sign of a stroke.
#* Normal: Patient uses correct words with no slurring
#* Abnormal: Slurred or inappropriate words or mute

Patients with 1 of these 3 findings as a new event have a 72% probability of an [[Stroke#Ischemic|ischemic stroke]].
If all 3 findings are present the probability of an acute stroke is more than 85%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=American Heart Association |title=Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support Provider Manual |publisher=First American Heart Association Printing |location=USA |year=2011 |page=137 |isbn=978-1-61669-010-6 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;!--|accessdate=April 24, 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Stopped blood circulation has historically proven irreversible in most cases. Prior to the invention of [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR), [[defibrillation]], [[epinephrine]] injection, and other treatments in the 20th century, the absence of blood circulation (and vital functions related to blood circulation) was historically considered the official definition of [[death]]. With the advent of these strategies, cardiac arrest came to be called ''clinical death'' rather than simply ''death'', to reflect the possibility of post-arrest resuscitation.

At the onset of clinical death, consciousness is lost within several seconds. Measurable brain activity stops within 20 to 40 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Limits of reversal==

Most tissues and organs of the body can survive clinical death for considerable periods. Blood circulation can be stopped in the entire body below the heart for at least 30 minutes, with injury to the spinal cord being a limiting factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The brain, however, appears to accumulate ischemic injury faster than any other organ. Without special treatment after circulation is restarted, full recovery of the brain after more than 3 minutes of clinical death at normal body temperature is rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Usually brain damage or later brain death results after longer intervals of clinical death even if the heart is restarted and blood circulation is successfully restored. Brain injury is therefore the chief limiting factor for recovery from clinical death.

Although loss of function is almost immediate, there is no specific duration of clinical death at which the non-functioning brain clearly dies. The most vulnerable cells in the brain, CA1 neurons of the [[hippocampus]], are fatally injured by as little as 10 minutes without oxygen.  However, the injured cells do not actually die until hours after resuscitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 1990, the laboratory of resuscitation pioneer [[Peter Safar]] discovered that reducing body temperature by three degrees Celsius after restarting blood circulation could double the time window of recovery from clinical death without brain damage from 5 minutes to 10 minutes. This [[induced hypothermia]] technique is beginning to be used in emergency medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Hypothermia during clinical death==
Reduced body temperature, or [[therapeutic hypothermia]], during clinical death slows the rate of injury accumulation, and extends the time period during which clinical death can be survived.  The decrease in the rate of injury can be approximated by the [[Q10 (temperature coefficient)|Q&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]] rule, which states that the rate of biochemical reactions decreases by a factor of two for every 10&amp;nbsp;°C reduction in temperature. As a result, humans can sometimes survive periods of clinical death exceeding one hour at temperatures below 20&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Life support during clinical death==
The purpose of [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) during [[cardiac arrest]] is ideally reversal of the clinically dead state by restoration of blood circulation and breathing. However, there is great variation in the effectiveness of CPR for this purpose. Blood pressure is very low during manual CPR,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Patients supported by methods that certainly maintain enough blood circulation and oxygenation for sustaining life during stopped heartbeat and breathing, such as [[cardiopulmonary bypass]], are not customarily considered clinically dead. All parts of the body except the heart and lungs continue to function normally. Clinical death occurs only if machines providing sole circulatory support are turned off, leaving the patient in a state of stopped blood circulation.

==Controlled clinical death==
Certain surgeries for [[cerebral aneurysm]]s or [[aortic arch]] defects require that blood circulation be stopped while repairs are performed.  This deliberate temporary induction of clinical death is called [[standstill operation|circulatory arrest]].  It is typically performed by lowering body temperature to between 18&amp;nbsp;°C and 20&amp;nbsp;°C (64 and 68&amp;nbsp;°F) and stopping the heart and lungs. This state is called [[deep hypothermic circulatory arrest]]. At such low temperatures most patients can tolerate the clinically dead state for up to 30 minutes without incurring significant brain injury.&lt;ref name="Conolly, S"&gt;{{cite journal

==Clinical death and the determination of death==
Death was historically believed to be an event that coincided with the onset of clinical death. It is now understood that death is a series of physical events, not a single one, and determination of permanent death is dependent on other factors beyond simple cessation of breathing and heartbeat.&lt;ref name="Crippen"/&gt;

Clinical death that occurs unexpectedly is treated as a medical emergency. [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] is initiated. In a United States hospital, a [[hospital emergency codes|Code Blue]] is declared and [[Advanced Cardiac Life Support]] procedures used to attempt to restart a normal heartbeat. This effort continues until either the heart is restarted, or a physician determines that continued efforts are useless and recovery is impossible. If this determination is made, the physician pronounces [[legal death]] and resuscitation efforts stop.

If clinical death is expected due to terminal illness or withdrawal of supportive care, often a [[Do Not Resuscitate]] (DNR) or "no code" order is in place. This means that no resuscitation efforts are made, and a physician or nurse may pronounce [[legal death]] at the onset of clinical death.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

A patient with working heart and lungs who is determined to be [[brain death|brain dead]] can be pronounced [[legal death|legally dead]] without clinical death occurring.  However, some courts have been reluctant to impose such a determination over the religious objections of family members, such as in the [[Jesse Koochin]] case.&lt;ref&gt;Appel, JM. Defining Death:  When Physicians and Families Differ” ''Journal of Medical Ethics'' Fall 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar issues were also raised by the case of [[Mordechai Dov Brody]], but the child died before a court could resolve the matter.&lt;ref&gt;

'''David Kano''' is a [[fictional character]] who regularly appeared during the first season of the science fiction television series ''[[Space: 1999]]''.  He is of Jamaican origin and in his mid-thirties.  He was played by actor [[Clifton Jones]].

==Character biography==
As part of the Moonbase Alpha senior staff and head of the Technical Section,&lt;ref&gt;''Space: 1999'' episode "[[The Last Sunset (Space: 1999)|The Last Sunset]]"&lt;/ref&gt; David Kano was the resident computer expert on Moonbase.  It was said to owe his expertise to his parents, both of whom were computer programmers.

Prior to his position on Alpha, Kano was one of several volunteer test subjects on Earth to receive an experimental cybernetic implant that would enable the human brain to interface with a computer, taking advantage of its vast memory and calculating speed.  Kano was the only subject not to be rendered permanently brain damaged by the experiment.  He retains the access port from this programme in the right occipital area of his skull.&lt;ref name="GOP"&gt;''Space: 1999'' episode "[[Guardian of Piri]]"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Series one==
Kano had an almost symbiotic relationship with Alpha's Main Computer, which was curiously programmed with a female voice. He also referred to the computer as 'Computer' instead of "the computer" as though it were a name. He also habitually referred to Computer as 'she' or 'her'. Kano was invaluable to [[John Koenig|Commander Koenig]] as the person who had the ability to ask ''Computer'' the right questions and was privy to confidential computer output before everyone else.  Kano's faith in computers in general was unshakable and he would tout human error over computer error every time.&lt;ref name="GOP"/&gt;

Well liked among the Alphans, Kano was an easygoing person who got along well with fellow key staff.  While typically addressed as 'Kano', [[Paul Morrow]] was one of the few to address him by given name, indicating that the two probably knew each other for some time.  While not socially inept, Kano preferred to spend most of his time with Computer, often playing chess with her.  He could occasionally be seen playing chess with his fellow Alphans when seeking 'a real game' as he beat Computer every time.&lt;ref&gt;''Space: 1999'' episodes "[[Black Sun (Space: 1999)|Black Sun]]" and "[[Dragon's Domain (Space: 1999)|Dragon's Domain]]"&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode "[[Missing Link (Space: 1999)|Missing Link]]" marks a notable instance where Kano lost his temper and harshly reprimands a junior staff member who accidentally spills coffee on him.  Morrow also almost comes to blows with Kano over what he perceives as Kano's unnecessary harsh treatment of said junior staff member. However, everyone at this time is overly stressed due to Commander Koenig's being on the brink of death due to events in that episode.  These harsh exchanges were promptly forgotten when Koenig recovered.

Kano first appeared in Series One's second episode "[[Matter of Life and Death (Space: 1999)|Matter of Life and Death]]". The pilot episode has a similar Black character in the same position, Benjamin Ouma, played by actor [[Lon Satton]]. (An examination of early drafts of the script for "[[Breakaway (Space: 1999)|Breakaway]]" indicated Ouma was the head of the Computer Section.)  Kano replaced Ouma without any reason given and Ouma was never seen on the show again.  Accounts from cast and crew indicate Satton did not get along with producers and fellow actors alike (especially Martin Landau) and was removed from the series.

==Series two==
Along with fellow regular cast members [[Prentis Hancock]] and [[Barry Morse]], [[Clifton Jones]] did not return for the second series of the show.  The absence of these characters was never accounted for in official canon.  In the fan production ''[[List of Space: 1999 episodes#Message from Moonbase Alpha|Message from Moonbase Alpha]]'' which takes place 25 years later, [[Sandra Benes]] briefly recalls Professor Bergman, Paul and other characters no longer with them at that time, although it is not specifically said that either is necessarily deceased.  But she did not mention Kano, which suggests either an overlook on Sandra's part or that Kano was still alive and well on Alpha but had taken up residence on Alpha off-screen in a different capacity.  The fan-produced "Moonbase Alpha Technical Journal" would state that he, along with Paul Morrow, had died in an Eagle crash in the time between the two series.

In the officially licensed series of novels published by Powys Media, in particular the novel ''Born for Adversity'' by David McIntee, Kano's fate is revealed. He is killed during a further attempt to link his brain to Computer, resulting in a copy of his mind being preserved within Computer's memory. With the arrival of the Psychons on the Moon, and with them an incarnation of the biological computer Psyche, Kano is transferred to Psyche and becomes one with it. He departs with the Psychons and is presumably still alive at the time of Message for Moonbase Alpha.

In reality, he was not rehired by the production as American producer [[Fred Freiberger]] felt that the Year One supporting cast lacked character definition and had garnered no fan support.

'''Molly Anne Bish''' (August 2, 1983 – June 27, 2000) was a sixteen-year-old American girl from rural [[Worcester County, Massachusetts]], who disappeared while working as a lifeguard in her hometown of [[Warren, Massachusetts]]. Her remains were found three years later in neighboring [[Hampden County, Massachusetts|Hampden County]] after what became the largest search in the state's history.

==Disappearance==
In the summer of 2000, 16-year-old Molly Bish began working as a lifeguard at Comins Pond in Warren, Massachusetts.&lt;ref name="hours"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/12/01/48hours/main586143.shtml |title=Where's Molly? Bay State Mystery |publisher=CBS News |date= |accessdate=2015-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On June 26, the day before Molly's disappearance, her mother, Magi, saw a mustached man in a white car parked in the lot of the beach where Molly's lifeguard post was located.&lt;ref name="amw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amw.com/missing_children/case.cfm?id=24911|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205141314/http://www.amw.com/missing_children/case.cfm?id=24911|title=Missing children|archivedate=February 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he seemed suspicious at the time, she afforded him no further thought until after Molly's disappearance. On June 27, Magi drove Molly to Comins Pond and dropped her off near the lifeguard station. Magi reportedly saw no sign of the stranger from the previous day or his white sedan. However, another witness reported that he saw a man matching the stranger's description in the pond's parking lot just minutes before Molly arrived. A local worker also reported that he saw a similar car parked at a cemetery connected to the pond by a path. Magi Bish was the last known person to see Molly before her disappearance. Several hours later, police contacted Molly's parents, informing them that no lifeguard had been on duty all day and that Molly's belongings had been left unattended at her station.

==Body discovery==
An extensive search was immediately launched. It was to become the largest and most expensive search for a missing person ever undertaken in Massachusetts. Her case was profiled on the numerous American television shows ''[[Disappeared (TV series)|Disappeared]]'', ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'',&lt;ref name="amw"/&gt; ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unsolved.com/0242-Bish.html|title=Unsolved Mysteries - Molly Bish|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910030456/http://www.unsolved.com/0242-Bish.html|archivedate=September 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[48 Hours (TV series)|48 Hours]]''.&lt;ref name="hours"/&gt; On June 9, 2003, Molly's body was found five miles from her family home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebostonchannel.com/news/2258530/detail.html|title=Molly Bish's remains identified|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927114026/http://www.thebostonchannel.com/news/2258530/detail.html|archivedate=September 27, 2011|publisher=WCVB-TV}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hunter had seen a blue bathing suit in the woods on Whiskey Hill in [[Palmer, Massachusetts|Palmer]], in late fall 2002. In May 2003, he mentioned this to Tim McGuigan, who contacted police. An intense search of the area soon located Molly's body.

==Further developments==

In 2004 Magi and John Bish founded The Molly Bish Center and Foundation in collaboration with Anna Maria College.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.annamaria.edu/about/mbc&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, a [[Connecticut]] resident charged with attempted kidnapping in Connecticut was briefly under investigation in connection with the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/connecticut/articles/2005/11/21/bish_parents_speak_of_impact_of_arrest/ |title=Bish parents speak of impact of arrest - The Boston Globe |publisher=Boston.com |date=2005-11-21 |accessdate=2015-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a new suspect was investigated. Rodney Stanger, a Florida resident convicted of murdering his girlfriend, had lived in [[Southbridge, Massachusetts]]&amp;nbsp;– a few miles from the town of Warren&amp;nbsp;– for more than 20 years. Rodney moved to Florida a year after the Bish murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/232-Everett-St_Southbridge_MA_01550_M39588-23205|title=Check out the home I found in Southbridge|website=realtor.com®|language=en|access-date=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.realtor.com/property-detail/232-Everett-St_Southbridge_MA_01550_e5baa005 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-01 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723222005/http://www.realtor.com/property-detail/232-Everett-St_Southbridge_MA_01550_e5baa005 |archivedate=July 23, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocala.com/article/20101028/articles/101029663|title=Rodney Stanger sentenced to 25 years for murder of girlfriend|work=Ocala.com|accessdate=2015-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the murder of Crystal Morrison, Stanger's girlfriend of 20 years, Crystal's sister alerted the Massachusetts authorities. Stanger was known to have access to a white car similar to the one seen the day before Bish's disappearance. He was also known to fish in Comins Pond and hunt in the woods where Bish's body was found. In addition, Stanger closely matched the description provided by Magi Bish of the man seen in the white sedan the day before Molly's disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs3springfield.com/news/local/38580217.html |title=Possible Suspect In Molly Bish Case |accessdate=June 1, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206103645/http://www.cbs3springfield.com/news/local/38580217.html |archivedate=February 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stanger has not been charged in her case.

In 2009, Stanger was investigated for the Bish murder. Police also questioned him in connection with the 1993 murder of [[Holly Piirainen]] in Southbridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.necn.com/Boston/New-England/2009/08/05/Family-holds-out-hope-to-find/1249502689.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120910051423/http://www.necn.com/Boston/New-England/2009/08/05/Family-holds-out-hope-to-find/1249502689.html |archivedate=September 10, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bish and Piirainen were the same age, and Bish had written a letter of hope to Piirainen's parents in 1993. Stanger was not charged in this case. In 2012, forensic evidence led authorities to name David Pouliot&amp;nbsp;— who died in 2003&amp;nbsp;— as a person of interest in the Piirainen case.&lt;ref name=myfoxboston&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfoxboston.com/story/25883882/14-years-passed-ago-molly-bish-vanished-family-still-wants-justice |title=14 years ago Molly Bish vanished, family still wants justice - Boston News, Weather, Sports &amp;#124; FOX 25 |publisher=MyFoxBoston |date= |accessdate=2015-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='ABC News 2012-01-03'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://abcnews.go.com/US/massachusetts-cold-case-linked-dead-man/story?id=15280841#.TwN--5hLdWg | title = Cold Case Murder of Holly Piirainen, 10, Linked to Dead Man | accessdate =January 3, 2012 | work = ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, Gerald Battistoni, a.k.a.

{{Refimprove|date=August 2007}}
'''Disembowelment''' or '''evisceration''' is the removal of some or all of the [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s of the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]] (the [[bowels]], or viscera), usually through a horizontal incision made across the [[Abdomen|abdominal]] area.  Disembowelment may result from an accident but has also been used as a method of [[torture]] and [[execution]].  In such practices, disembowelment may be accompanied by other forms of torture, or the removal of other vital organs.

==Disembowelment as torture==
If a living creature is disemboweled, it is invariably fatal without major medical intervention.  Historically, disembowelment has been used as a severe form of [[capital punishment]].  If the intestinal tract alone is removed, death follows after several hours of gruesome pain. The victim will often be fully conscious while the torture is performed if the vital organs aren't damaged, and will be able to see their intestine being removed, but will eventually lose consciousness due to blood loss. However, in some forms of intentional disembowelment, decapitation or the removal of the [[heart]] and [[lung]]s would hasten the victim's death.

===Asia===
[[File:Seppuku-2.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Ukiyo-e]]'' woodblock print of warrior about to perform ''[[seppuku]]'', from the [[Edo period]].]]

====Japan====
In [[Japan]], disembowelment played a central part as a method of execution or the ritualized [[suicide]] of a [[samurai]]. In killing themselves by this method, they were deemed to be free from the dishonor resulting from their crimes. The most common form of disembowelment was referred to in Japanese as ''[[seppuku]]'' (or, colloquially, ''hara-kiri''), literally "stomach cutting," involving two cuts across the abdomen, sometimes followed by pulling out one's own [[Viscus|viscera]]. The act of [[decapitation]] by a second (''kaishaku-nin'') was added to this ritual suicide in later times in order to shorten the suffering of the samurai or leader, an attempt at rendering the ritual more humane. Even later the knife was just a simple formality and the swordsman would decapitate before the subject could reach for it.  The commission of a crime or dishonorable act was only one of many reasons for the performance of seppuku; others included the atonement of cowardice, as a means of apology, or following the loss of a battle or the surrender of a [[Japanese castle|castle]].

====Vietnam====
Various accounts have asserted that during the [[Vietnam War]], members of the [[Viet Cong]] sometimes made calculated use of disembowelment as a means of [[psychological warfare]], to coerce and intimidate rural [[peasant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hubbel |first=John G. |title=The Blood-Red Hands of Ho Chi Minh |journal=Readers Digest |date= November 1968  |pages=61–67 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Off With Their Hands |journal=Newsweek |date=15 May 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Peer De Silva, former head of the [[Saigon]] department of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), wrote that from as early as 1963, Viet Cong units were using disembowelment and other methods of mutilation as psychological warfare.&lt;ref name=desilva&gt;{{cite book |last=De Silva |first=Peer |title=Sub Rosa: The CIA and the Uses of Intelligence |year=1978 |publisher=Time Books |place=New York |isbn=0-8129-0745-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extent, however, to which this punishment was perpetrated may be impossible to gauge and while detailed accounts survive regarding how civilians were disemboweled by Viet Cong, the use of this torture appears to have been quite arbitrary and there is no record that such actions were sanctioned by the [[North Vietnam]]ese government in [[Hanoi]]. Disembowelment and other methods of intimidation and torture were intended to frighten civilian peasants at a local level into cooperating with the Viet Cong or discourage them from cooperating with the [[South Vietnamese Army]] or its allies.&lt;ref name=desilva/&gt;

===Europe===

====Romania====
In early 1941, during the [[Legionnaires%27 rebellion and Bucharest pogrom#The Bucharest pogrom|Bucharest pogrom]] in which 125 [[Jewish]] civilians were killed, multiple cases of torture including disembowelment were recorded.&lt;ref name="Ancel"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ancel|first=Jean|title=History of the Holocaust – Romania |year=2002|publisher=[[Yad Vashem]]|location=[[Israel]]|isbn=965-308-157-8|language=he}} For details of the Pogrom itself, see volume I, pp. 363–400.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Netherlands====
On 10 July 1584, [[Balthasar Gérard]] shot and killed [[William the Silent|William of Orange]], who had advocated for [[Spanish Netherlands|Dutch independence]] from the [[Philip II of Spain|King of Spain]].&lt;ref name=jardine&gt;{{Cite book| author= [[Lisa Jardine|Jardine, Lisa]] |title= The Awful End of William the Silent: The First Assassination of A Head of State With A Handgun |place= London |publisher= HarperCollins |year= 2005 |isbn= 0-00-719257-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The assassin was interrogated and condemned to death almost immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Motley|first=John L.|title=The Rise of the Dutch Republic, Vol. 3|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4836|authorlink=John Lothrop Motley|year=1856}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 July, after suffering various tortures during each of the five days since the assassination, Gérard was disemboweled and [[dismembered]] while still alive, after which his heart was torn out and then he was beheaded by his Dutch executioners.&lt;ref name=jardine/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] |first =Michel |title=[[Discipline and Punish]] |chapter = The Spectacle of the scaffold. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Roman Empire====
[[Christian]] tradition states that [[Erasmus of Formiae]], also known as Saint Elmo, was finally executed by disembowelment in about A.D. 303, after he had suffered extreme forms of torture during the persecutions of Emperor [[Diocletian]] and [[Maximian]].

====England====
[[File:BNMsFr2643FroissartFol97vExecHughDespenser.jpg|thumb|The execution of [[Hugh Despenser the Younger]], who was hanged, drawn and quartered for high treason in 1326]]
In [[England]], the punishment of being "[[hanged, drawn and quartered]]" was typically used for men convicted of [[high treason]]. This referred to the practice of dragging a man by a hurdle (similar to a fence) through the streets, removing him from the hurdle and (1) hanging him from the neck (but removing him before [[death]]), (2) drawing (i.e. disembowelling) him slowly on a wooden block by slitting open his abdomen, removing his [[entrail]]s and his other organs (which were frequently thrown on a fire), and then [[decapitation|decapitating]] him and (3) quartering, i.e. dividing the body into four pieces.  The man's head and quarters would often be [[parboiled]] and displayed as a [[Deterrence (legal)|warning]] to others. As part of the disembowelment, the man was also typically [[emasculation|emasculated]] and his genitals and entrails would be burned.

[[William Harrington (priest)|William Harrington]] is an example of someone tortured on the rack, [[Hanging|hanged]] until not quite dead, then subjected to disembowelment.&lt;ref name="Schama"&gt;{{cite news |first=Simon |last=Schama |title=Simon Schama's John Donne |date=26 May 2009 |publisher=BBC2 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctwo |accessdate=18 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany====
From the 15th century, ordinances are retained that threaten with a terrible punishment for those who stripped off the bark of a standing tree in the common woods. A typical wording is found in the 1401 ordinance from [[Oberursel (Taunus)|Oberursel]]:&lt;ref&gt;For a number of such ordinances, see * {{cite book|last=Grimm|first=Jacob|title=Deutsche Rechtsalterthümer

{{quote|"and whoever is caught stripping off a standing tree, mercy would have been more beneficial to him than the law is; for when law is to be fulfilled, then one is to cut up his stomach at the navel, and pull out a length of the gut. The gut is to be nailed to the tree, and one is keep going around that tree with the person, so long as he still has any part of the gut left in his body"}}
[[Jacob Grimm]] observes that no case of the punishment being carried out has been found in records from that period (15th century), but 300 to 500 years earlier, the [[West Slavs|Western Slavic]] tribes like the [[Wends]]  are said to have revenged themselves upon Christians by binding the guts to an erect pole and driving them around until the person was fully eviscerated.&lt;ref&gt;'''i)''' General comment, with connotations of this being a type of human sacrifice {{cite book|last=Hübner|first=Johann|title=Kurtze Fragen aus der politischen Historia, volume 6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9t4GAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA500|page=500|year=1703|publisher=Gleditsch|location=|accessdate=2013-03-13}}, '''ii)''' 8th century description from 772-73, {{cite book|last=Caesar|first=Aquilin Julius|title=Beschreibung des Herzogthum Steyermarks, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r4wAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA88|pages=88–89|year=1786|publisher=Zaunrith|location=Gräz|accessdate=2013-03-13}},  '''iii)''' Danish 1096 retaliation on Wends, by like execution method, {{cite book|last=Sell|first=Johann Jakob|title=Geschichte des Herzogthums Pommern, volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iQcBAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA88|pages=88–89|year=1819|publisher=Flittner|location=Berlin|accessdate=2013-03-13}}, '''iv)''' 1131 pagan attacks on Christians by Wends, {{cite book|last=Röper|first=Friedrich L.|title=Geschichte und Anekdoten von Dobberan in Mecklenburg|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f30AAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA111|pages=111–13|year=1808|publisher=Self-published|location=Dobberan|accessdate=2013-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 13th century, members of the now extinct Baltic ethnic group of [[Old Prussians]] in one of the battles against the [[Teutonic Knights]], are said to have captured one such knight in 1248, and made to undergo this punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Voigt|first=Johannes|title=Geschichte Preussens: Von den altesten Zeiten bis zum Untergange der Herrschaft des Deutschen Ordens.

Those who had engaged in the passive role of homosexual anal intercourse had their intestines pulled out, then their bodies were filled with ash, and finally, were burnt.

==Suicide==
The Japanese tradition of ''seppuku'' is a well known example of highly ritualized suicide, within a wider cultural world of norms and symbolism. However, reported examples of suicides exist, in which a person performed disembowelment on himself or herself, without any ambient culture of approved, or expected, suicide.

The Spartan king [[Cleomenes I]]  is reported, in a fit of madness, to have slit his stomach open, and ripped his own bowels out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lauremberg|first=Peter|title=Neue und vermehrte Acerra philologica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wcRCAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA985|page=985|year=1708|publisher=Johann A. Plener|location=Frankfurt and Leipzig|accessdate=2013-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman statesman [[Cato the Younger]] committed suicide in [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]], after [[Cato_the_Younger#The_Civil_War|his side]] lost to [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], by plunging a knife in his own gut, in the dead of night. According to [[Parallel Lives|Plutarch]], Cato's son heard the commotion from a nearby room, and called a doctor who stitched the wound close; after his son and the doctor left, Cato tore the stitching open with his hand and died. On account of his tragic, highly symbolic suicide, Cato is often termed ''Uticensis'' ("of Utica"), in order to differentiate him from his homonymous ancestor, [[Cato the Elder|Cato "the Elder" or "the Censor"]].

In 1593, a suicide occurred in [[Bad Wimpfen|Wimpfen]]. A young, pregnant woman, who had become a widow a few weeks before, was lying in her bed. She took a large knife, opened her belly in a cross, and threw out the fetus, her own intestines, and dug out her spleen and flung that out as well. She lived for 10 hours after the act, and when the priests sought to bring her a final consolation and blessing, she said it would all be in vain, because she was a daughter of the devil, and was beyond any sort of redemption. Then, she died, was put in a sack and thrown in the river. She was affluent, so it was clear that poverty had not driven her to this act.&lt;ref&gt;Forty years earlier, in 1555 Seidenberg (nowadays [[Zawidow]]), a woman who had become pregnant by another man than her (absent) husband sought to preserve her honour by cutting out the fetus. Having pulled it out, along with much else, she began screaming of pain, but no one could help her, and she died three days later. {{cite book|last=Döpler|first=Jacob|title=Theatrum Poenarum, volume 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LZlBAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA313|pages=313–14|year=1697|publisher=Friedrich Lanckischen Erben|location=Leipzig|accessdate=2013-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1617, a merchant in the municipality Grossglockau&lt;ref&gt;For status as municipality, see:{{cite book|last=Janssen|first=Johannes|title=History of the German People at the Close of the Middle Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N509AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA336|page=336|year=1896|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=London|accessdate=2013-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; slit up his abdomen so that the intestines fell out; he then pulled out his stomach and threw it on the bed. The chronicler notes he lived long enough to regret his action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Khevenhüller|first=Franz C.|title=Annales Ferdinandei, volume 7-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TnFZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PT138|page=column 1158|year=1723|publisher=M.G. Weidmann|location=Leipzig|accessdate=2013-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transanal evisceration==
When a portion of the intestinal tract is forcefully pulled from or expelled from the body through the anus, it is referred to as ''transanal evisceration''. Following the first report of transanal small intestine evisceration by Brodie in 1827, more than 70 cases have been reported to date, the majority occurring spontaneously in elderly individuals. Straining, chronic constipation, and rectal ulcerations predispose to spontaneous perforation in elderly individuals.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Medappil|first1=Noushif|title=Blunt abdominal trauma with transanal small bowel evisceration|journal=J Emerg Trauma Shock|date=Jan–Mar 2013|volume=6|issue=1|pages=56–57|doi=10.4103/0974-2700.106328|pmid=23493429|pmc=3589862}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cases of transanal evisceration of children whilst sitting over uncovered [[swimming pool]] drains have been reported; notable cases include Valerie Lakey (1993) and [[Death of Abigail Taylor|Abigail Taylor]] (2007).  In Taylor's case, the suction dislodged and damaged her liver and pancreas; several meters of her small intestine were forcefully pulled through her anus.  In both these cases, the victims were left with [[short bowel syndrome]] and required feeding by total [[parenteral nutrition]]. After multiple operations, Taylor later died from transplant-related cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wsbtv.com/news/13626279/detail.html |title=Wading Pool Drain Sucks Out Girl's Organ |date=5 Jul 2007 |work=WSB Atlanta |accessdate=28 June 2011 |location=MINNEAPOLIS |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629124327/http://www.wsbtv.com/news/13626279/detail.html |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/160648/ |title=Family Reaches Settlement that Guarantees $25 Million Payment |date=January 14, 1997 |work=[[WRAL-TV]] |accessdate=29 October 2010 |location=RALEIGH}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A person, usually a child, can suffer a similar injury if a heavy weight is applied directly over the abdomen. Large intestine (Rectosigmoid) rupture with transanal evisceration has been reported from blunt abdominal trauma and suction injuries. A direct blow or impingement of intestine between the vertebrae and anterior abdominal wall results in sudden increase in the intra-abdominal or intraluminal pressure of the intestine and rupture.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt; The downward pressure forces a portion of the intestine to burst from the anus.

===Cultural references===
The short story "[[Haunted (Palahniuk novel)#"Guts"|Guts]]" from the book ''[[Haunted (Palahniuk novel)|Haunted]]'' by [[Chuck Palahniuk]] is based on the concept of transanal evisceration.

In Japanese folklore, it was believed that malicious ''[[Kappa (folklore)|Kappa]]''{{spaced ndash}}water-goblins that inhabited ponds and rivers{{spaced ndash}}might thrust a hand into the anus of a human swimmer, seeking a mythical sphere called a ''shirikodama''.

In American Horror Story: Roanoke (2016), Cricket is disemboweled by The Butcher (Thomyson White)

In the video game [[Fallout: New Vegas]], if the character Arcade Gannon is sold into slavery, during the ending slideshow he narrates how, during an unguarded moment, he used a [[Scalpel|medical scalpel]] to disembowel himself.

==Embalming==
The process of [[embalming]] sometimes includes removing the internal organs. [[Mummy|Mummification]], especially as practised by the [[ancient Egypt]]ians, entailed the removal of the internal organs prior to the preservation of the remainder of the body.  The organs removed were embalmed, stored in [[canopic jars]] and then placed in the tomb with the body.

James Cook, on his second voyage, noted an embalming custom on some of the Pacific islands his crew visited, a custom utilizing transanal evisceration:&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book|last=Potts|first=James|title=The Hibernian Magazine, Or, Compendium of Entertaining Knowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JbkRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA693|year=1784|publisher=James Potts|location=Dublin|page=693, col 2|accessdate=2013-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|We found the body not only entire in every part; but, what surprised us much more, was, that putrefaction had scarcely begun (...); though the climate is one of the hottest, and Tee had been dead above five months.(...) Such were Mr. [[William Anderson (naturalist)|Anderson]]'s remarks to me, who also told me, on his enquiring inte the method of effecting this preservation of their dead bodies, he had been informed, that, soon after their death, they are disemboweled, by drawing their intestines, and other viscera, out at the anus; and the whole cavity is then filled or stuffed with cloth; introduced through the same part(...)}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11050">'''Fish School Search''' (FSS), proposed by Bastos Filho and Lima Neto in 2007 is, in its basic version,&lt;ref&gt;C. J. A. B Filho., F. B. de Lima Neto, A. J. C. C.. Lins, A. I. S. Nascimento., and M. P. Lima, "A novel search algorithm based on fish school behavior," Systems, Man and Cybernetics, SMC 2008. IEEE International Conference on, 2008, pp. 2646-2651.&lt;/ref&gt; an unimodal optimization algorithm inspired on the collective behavior of fish schools. The mechanisms of feeding and coordinated movement were used as inspiration to create the search operators. The core idea is to make the fishes “swim” toward the positive gradient in order to “eat” and “gain weight”. Collectively, the heavier fishes are more influent in the search process as a whole, what makes the barycenter of the fish school moves toward better places in the search space over the iterations.&lt;ref&gt;de Lima Neto, Fernando Buarque, and Marcelo Gomes Pereira de Lacerda. "Multimodal Fish School Search Algorithms Based on Local Information for School Splitting." 2013 BRICS Congress on Computational Intelligence and 11th Brazilian Congress on Computational Intelligence. IEEE, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The FSS uses the following principles:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fbln.pro.br/fss/&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Simple computations in all individuals (i.e. fish)
# Various means of storing information (i.e. weights of fish and school barycenter)
# Local computations (i.e. swimming is composed of distinct components)
# Low communications between neighboring individuals (i.e. fish are to think local but also be socially aware)
# Minimum centralized control (mainly for self-controlling of the school radius)
# Some distinct diversity mechanisms (this to avoid undesirable flocking behavior)
# Scalability (in terms of complexity of the optimization/search tasks)
# Autonomy (i.e. ability to self-control functioning)

==Algorithm==

FSS is a population based search algorithm inspired in the behavior of swimming fishes that expand and contract while looking for food. Each fish &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional location represents a possible solution for the optimization problem. The algorithm makes use of weights for all the fishes which represents cummulative account on how successful has been the search for each fish in the school. FSS is composed of the feeding and movement operators, the latter being divided into three sub-components, which are:&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Monteiro, I. M. C. Albuquerque, F. B. L. Neto, and F. V. S. Ferreira, “Optimizing multi-plateau functions with FSS-SAR (Stagnation Avoidance Routine),” Submitted to IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Individual component of the movement===
Every fish in the school performs a local search looking for promising regions in the search space. It is done as represented below:

&lt;math&gt;
x_{i}(t + 1) = x_{i}(t)+rand(-1,1)step_{ind},
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;x_{i}(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_{i}(t + 1)&lt;/math&gt; represent the position of the fish &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; before and after the individual movement operator, respectively. &lt;math&gt;rand(-1, 1)&lt;/math&gt; is a uniformly distributed random number varying from -1 up to 1 and &lt;math&gt;step_{ind}&lt;/math&gt; is a parameter that defines the maximum displacement for this movement. The new position &lt;math&gt;x_{i}(t + 1)&lt;/math&gt; is only accepted if the fitness of the fish improves with the position change. If it is not the case, the fish remains in the same position and &lt;math&gt;x_{i}(t + 1) = x_{i}(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Collective-instinctive component of the movement===
An average of the individual movements is calculated based on the following:

&lt;math&gt;
I=\frac{\sum^{N}_{i=1} \Delta x_{i} \Delta f_{i}}{\sum^{N}_{i=1} \Delta f_{i}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The vector &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; represents the weighted average of the displacements of each fish. It means that the fishes that experienced a higher improvement will attract fishes into its position.
After the vector &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; computation, every fish will be encouraged to move according to:

&lt;math&gt;
x_i(t+1)=x_{i}(t)+I.
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Collective-volitive component of the movement===

This operator is used in order to regulate the exploration/exploitation ability of the school during the search process. First of all, the barycenter &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; of the school is calculated based on the position &lt;math&gt;x_{i}&lt;/math&gt; and the weight &lt;math&gt;W_{i}&lt;/math&gt; of each fish:

&lt;math&gt;
B(t)=\frac{\sum^{N}_{i=1} x_{i}(t) W_{i}(t)}{\sum^{N}_{i=1} W_{i}(t)},
&lt;/math&gt;

and then, if the total school weight &lt;math&gt;\sum^{N}_{i=1} W_{i}&lt;/math&gt; has increased from the last to the current iteration, the fishes are attracted to the barycenter according to equation A. If the total school weight has not improved, the fishes are spread away from the barycenter according to equation B:

Eq. A:

&lt;math&gt;
x_i(t+1)=x_{i}(t)- step_{vol} rand(0,1)\frac{x_{i}(t) - B(t)}{distance(x_{i}(t),B(t))},
&lt;/math&gt;

Eq. B:

&lt;math&gt;
x_i(t+1)=x_{i}(t)+step_{vol} rand(0,1)\frac{x_{i}(t) - B(t)}{distance(x_{i}(t),B(t))},
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;step_{vol}&lt;/math&gt; defines the size of the maximum displacement performed with the use of this operator. &lt;math&gt;distance(x_{i}(t),B(t))&lt;/math&gt; is the euclidean distance between the fish &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; position and the school barycenter. &lt;math&gt;rand(0, 1)&lt;/math&gt;  is a uniformly distributed random number varying from 0 up to 1.
 
Besides the movement operators, it was also defined a feeding operator used in order to update the weights of every fish according to:

&lt;math&gt;
W_{i}(t+1)=W_{i}(t)+\frac{\Delta f_i}{max(| \Delta f_i |)},
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;W_{i}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the weight parameter for fish &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Delta f_i&lt;/math&gt; is the fitness variation between the last and the new position, and &lt;math&gt;max(| \Delta f_i |)&lt;/math&gt; represents the maximum absolute value of the fitness variation among all the fishes in the school.
&lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is only allowed to vary from 1 up to &lt;math&gt;W_{scale}/2&lt;/math&gt;, which is a user defined attribute. The weights of all fishes are initialized with the value &lt;math&gt;W_{scale}/2&lt;/math&gt;.

===The pseudo-code for FSS===

# Initialize user parameters
# Initialize fishes positions randomly
# while Stopping condition is not met do
# Calculate fitness for each fish
# Run individual operator movement
# Calculate fitness for each fish
# Run feeding operator
# Run collective-instinctive movement operator
# Run collective-volitive movement operator
# end while

The parameters &lt;math&gt;step_{ind}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;step_{vol}&lt;/math&gt; decay linearly according to:

&lt;math&gt;
step_{ind}(t+1)=step_{ind}(t)-\frac{step_{ind}(initial)}{It_{max}},
&lt;/math&gt;

and similarly:

&lt;math&gt;
step_{vol}(t+1)=step_{vol}(t)-\frac{step_{vol}(initial)}{It_{max}},
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;step_{ind}(initial)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;step_{vol}(initial)&lt;/math&gt; are user defined initial values for &lt;math&gt;step_{ind}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;step_{vol}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. &lt;math&gt;It_{max}&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum number of iterations allowed in the search process.

==Variations of FSS==

===dFSS(Density based Fish School Search)===

This version excels for multimodal hyper-dimensional functions. It includes modifications in the previous operators: Feeding and Swimming, as well as new: Memory and Partition operators. The latter two were introduced to account for the partition of the main school into subgroups. Some changes were also included in the stop conditions that now also have to consider subswarms.&lt;ref&gt;Madeiro, S. S., de Lima-Neto, F. B., Bastos-Filho, C. J. A., &amp; do Nascimento Figueiredo, E. M. (2011, June). Density as the segregation mechanism in fish school search for multimodal optimization problems. In International Conference in Swarm Intelligence (pp. 563-572). Springer Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;

===wFSS(Weight based Fish School Search)===

wFSS is a weight based niching version of FSS intended to produce multiple solutions. The niching strategy is based on a new operator called link formator. This operator is used to define leaders for the fishes in order to form sub-schools.&lt;ref&gt;F. Buarque De Lima Neto and M. Gomes Pereira de Lacerda, “Weight based fish school search,” in Systems, Man and Cybernetics (SMC), 2014 IEEE International Conference on. IEEE, 2014, pp. 270–277.&lt;/ref&gt;

===FSS-SAR(Stagnation Avoidance Routine Fish School Search)===

In the original version of the algorithm, the individual movement component is only allowed to move a fish if it improves the fitness. However, in a very smooth search space, there would be many moving trials with no success and the algorithm could fail to converge.
To solve these issues, was introduced a parameter X for which 0 &lt;= X &lt;= 1 in the individual component of the movement. X decays exponentially along with the iterations and measures a probability for a worsening allowance for each fish. It means that, every time a fish tries to move to a position that does not improve its fitness, a random number is chosen and if it is smaller than X the movement is allowed.&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Monteiro, I. M. C. Albuquerque, F. B. L. Neto, and F. V. S. Ferreira, “Optimizing multi-plateau functions with FSS-SAR (Stagnation Avoidance Routine),” Submitted to IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===bFSS(Binary Fish School Search)===

The bFSS intended to cope with premature convergence. Proposing the use of a binary encoding scheme for the internal mechanisms of the fish school search. It combined the FSS with fuzzy modeling in a wrapper approach for Feature Selection.&lt;ref&gt;Sargo, João AG, et al. "Binary Fish School Search applied to feature selection: Application to ICU readmissions." 2014 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE). IEEE, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===MOFSS(Multi-Objective Fish School Search)===

In the MOFSS the operators are adapted to solve multi-objective problems. The algorithm deploys an External Archive to store the best non-dominated solutions found during the search process. This approach has been extensively used for different bio-inspired multiobjective optimizers.&lt;ref&gt;Deb, K., Thiele, L., Laumanns, M., &amp; Zitzler, E.(2002) Scalable Multi-Objective Optimization Test Problems, In: IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (pp. 825–830).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nebro, A. J., Durillo, J. J., Garça-Nieto, J., Coello

(2009) SMPSO: A new PSO-based metaheuristic for multi-objective optimization, In: IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Multicriteria Decision-Making (pp. 66–73). doi:10.1109/MCDM.2009.4938830&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the solutions within the External Archive are used to guide the fish movements in the proposal version.&lt;ref&gt;Bastos-Filho, Carmelo JA, and Augusto CS Guimarães.

A '''fitness function''' is a particular type of [[objective function]] that is used to summarise, as a single [[figure of merit]], how close a given design solution is to achieving the set aims. Fitness functions are used in [[genetic programming]] and [[genetic algorithm]]s to guide simulations towards optimal design solutions.

==Genetic programming and algorithms==

In particular, in the fields of [[genetic programming]] and [[genetic algorithm]]s, each design solution is commonly represented as a string of numbers (referred to as a [[chromosome (genetic algorithm)|chromosome]]). After each round of testing, or simulation, the idea is to delete the ''n'' worst design solutions, and to [[crossover (genetic algorithm)|breed]] ''n'' new ones from the best design solutions. Each design solution, therefore, needs to be awarded a figure of merit, to indicate how close it came to meeting the overall specification, and this is generated by applying the fitness function to the test, or simulation, results obtained from that solution.

The reason that genetic algorithms cannot be considered to be a lazy way of performing design work is precisely because of the effort involved in designing a workable fitness function. Even though it is no longer the human designer, but the computer which comes up with the final design, it is still the human designer who has to design the fitness function. If this is designed badly, the algorithm will either converge on an inappropriate solution, or will have difficulty converging at all.

The fitness function must not only correlate closely with the designer's goal, it must also be computed quickly. Speed of execution is very important, as a typical genetic algorithm must be iterated many times in order to produce a usable result for a non-trivial problem.

[[Fitness approximation]] may be appropriate, especially in the following cases: 
* Fitness computation time of a single solution is extremely high 
* Precise model for fitness computation is missing
* The fitness function is uncertain or noisy.

Two main classes of fitness functions exist: one where the fitness function does not change, as in optimizing a fixed function or testing with a fixed set of test cases; and one where the fitness function is mutable, as in [[niche differentiation]] or [[co-evolution|co-evolving]] the set of test cases.

Another way of looking at fitness functions is in terms of a [[fitness landscape]], which shows the fitness for each possible chromosome.

Definition of the fitness function is not straightforward in many cases and often is performed iteratively if the fittest solutions produced by genetic algorithms are not what is desired. [[Interactive genetic algorithms]] address this difficulty by outsourcing evaluation to external agents (normally humans).

==A==
* '''[[Afterlife]]:''' (or life after death) A generic term referring to a continuation of [[existence]], typically [[spirituality|spiritual]] and experiential, beyond this world, or after death.  This article is about current generic and widely held or reported concepts of afterlife.
* '''[[Agnosticism]]:''' the view that the existence of God or the supernatural is unknown or unknowable.
* '''[[Ahimsa]]:''' A [[religion|religious]] concept which advocates [[non-violence]] and a respect for all [[life]]. ''Ahimsa'' (अहिंसा ahiṁsā) is [[Sanskrit]] for avoidance of ''himsa'', or injury. It is interpreted most often as meaning peace and reverence toward all [[Sentience|sentient]] beings. Ahimsa is the core of [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Buddhism]]. Its first mention in Indian philosophy is found in the Hindu scriptures called the [[Upanishads]], the oldest dating about 800 BC. Those who practice Ahimsa are often [[vegetarianism|vegetarians]] or [[vegan]]s.
* '''[[Aikido]]:''' (合気道 ''Aikidō'', also 合氣道 using an older style of [[kanji]]) Literally meaning "harmony energy way", or with some poetic license, "way of the harmonious spirit", is a [[gendai budo]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; a modern [[Japan]]ese [[martial art]]. Practitioners of aikido are known as aikidoka. It was developed by [[Morihei Ueshiba]] (植芝盛平) (also known by aikidoka as [[o-sensei]] (大先生)) over the period of the 1930s to the 1960s. Technically, the major parts of aikido are derived from [[Daito Ryu|Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu]] (大東流合気柔術), a form of jujutsu with many joint techniques, and [[kenjutsu]] (剣術), or Japanese sword technique (some believe the tactics in Aikido are especially influenced by [[Yagyu Shinkage-ryu|Yagyū Shinkage-ryū]]). Aikido is also considered to contain a significant spiritual component.
* '''[[Akashic Records]]:''' ([[Akasha]] is a [[Sanskrit]] word meaning "sky", "space" or "[[aether (mythology)|aether]]") Said to be a collection of mystical  knowledge that is stored in the aether; i.e. on a non-physical plane of existence. The concept is common in some [[New Age]] religious groups. The Akashic Records are said to have existed since the beginning of the planet. Just as we have various specialty [[Library|libraries]] (e.g., medical, law), there are said to exist various Akashic Records (e.g., human, animal, plant, mineral, etc.). Most writings refer to the Akashic Records in the area of [[human]] experience.
* '''[[Ancestor worship]]:''' (拜祖), also ancestor veneration (敬祖) A [[anthropology of religion|religious practice]] based on the belief that one's [[ancestor]]s possess [[supernatural]] powers.
* '''[[Animism]]''': The [[religious belief]] that all objects, places, and creatures possess a distinct spiritual essence.
* '''[[Asceticism]]:''' Denotes a life which is characterised by refraining from worldly pleasures ([[austerity]]). Those who practice ascetic lifestyles often perceive their practices as [[virtue|virtuous]] and pursue them to achieve greater [[spirituality]].
* '''[[Atheism]]:''' In the broadest sense, is the absence of belief in the existence of [[deities]]. Less broadly, atheism is the rejection of belief that any deities exist. In an even narrower sense, atheism is specifically the position that there are no deities. Atheism is contrasted with [[theism]], which, in its most general form, is the belief that at least one deity.

==B==
* '''[[Bagua (concept)]]:''' ({{zh|c=八卦|p=bā guà|w=pa kua|l=eight trigrams|}}, [[Korean language|Korean]] 한국어: 팔괘) A fundamental philosophical concept in ancient China.  It is an [[octagon]]al diagram with eight trigrams on each side.  The concept of ''bagua'' is applied not only to [[China|Chinese]] [[Taoist]] thought and the ''[[I Ching]]'', but is also used in other domains of Chinese culture, such as [[fengshui]], [[martial art]]s, [[navigation]], etc.
* '''[[Bahá'í Faith]]:''' An emerging global religion founded by [[Bahá'u'lláh]], a nineteenth-century [[Iran]]ian exile.
* '''[[Blessing]]''': (from to ''bless'', [[Old English language|Old English]] ''bleodsian'' or ''bletsian'') Originally meant "sprinkling with [[blood]]" during the pagan sacrifices, the [[Blót]]s (reference: [[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|AHD]]). A blessing, (also used to refer to bestowing of such) is the infusion of something with [[Sacred|holiness]], divine will, or one's hopes. Within [[Roman Catholicism]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], and similar traditions, formal blessings of the church are performed by [[bishop]]s, [[priest]]s, and sometimes [[deacon]]s, but as in many other religions, anyone may formally bless another.

==C==
* '''[[Chakra]]:''' In [[Hinduism]] and its spiritual systems of [[yoga]] and in some related eastern cultures, as well as in some segments of the [[New Age]] movement—and to some degree the distinctly different [[New Thought]] movement—a chakra is thought to be an energy node in the [[human body]].
* '''[[Chant]]:''' The [[rhythm]]ic speaking or [[singing]] of [[word]]s or [[sound]]s, either on a single [[pitch (music)|pitch]] or with a simple [[melody]] involving a limited set of [[note (music)|notes]] and often including a great deal of [[repetition (music)|repetition]] or statis. Chant may be considered speech, music, or a heightened form of speech which is more effective in conveying emotion or expressing ones spiritual side.
* '''[[Channelling (mediumistic)|Channelling]]:''' The act of having spirits enter or possess one's body in order to speak and act through one as practised in many cultures and religions.
* '''[[Creation (disambiguation)|Creation]]:''' The term creation refers to the beginnings of [[List of first men or women in mythology and religion|humanity]], [[earth]], [[life]], and the [[universe]] ([[cosmogony]]). Creation may explain that the beginnings of the universe were a deliberate act of "[[Creationism|Creation]]" by a [[God|supreme being]].
* '''[[Consciousness]]:''' A quality of the [[mind]] generally regarded to comprise qualities such as [[subjectivity]], [[self-awareness]], [[sentience]], [[sapience]], and the ability to [[perception|perceive]] the relationship between [[Identity (social science)|oneself]] and one's [[natural environment|environment]]. Many philosophers divide consciousness into phenomenal consciousness which is experience itself and access consciousness which is the processing of the things in experience.
:Many cultures and religious traditions place the seat of consciousness in a [[soul]] separate from the body.  Conversely, many scientists and philosophers consider consciousness to be intimately linked to the neural functioning of the [[brain]] dictating the way in which the world is experienced. This aspect of consciousness is the subject of much debate and research in [[philosophy of mind]], [[psychology]], [[brain]] [[biology]], [[neurology]], and [[cognitive science]].

* '''[[Contemplation]]:''' A type of [[prayer]] or [[meditation]] in the [[Christian]], especially [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]], tradition. It is an attempt to [[experience]] [[God]] directly. It is connected to Christian [[mysticism]], and authors such as [[Teresa of Avila]], [[Margery Kempe]], [[Augustine Baker]] and [[Thomas Merton]] have written about it extensively. It is briefly described in the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]], paragraphs 2709 onwards, where the [[Song of Songs]] is quoted.
* '''[[Cosmogony]]:''' [Gr. ''Kosmogonia'' from ''Kosmos'' the world and root of ''gignesthai'' to be born] The coming into [[existence]], the creation and origination of the [[universe]].  It is also the ''study'' of these aspects. So ''a cosmogony'' describes how the [[Universe]] came to be; hence, the creation myth in the [[Book of Genesis]] is one such cosmogony, and there are many others, both [[science|scientific]] and [[mythology|mythological]].  This contrasts with [[cosmology]], which studies the Universe at large, throughout its existence.

==D==
* '''[[Deism]]:''' Historical and modern deism is defined by the view that [[reason]], rather than [[revelation]] or [[tradition]], should be the basis of belief in God. Deists reject organized religion and promote reason as the essential element in making moral decisions. This "rational" basis was usually founded upon the [[cosmological argument]] (first cause argument), the [[teleological argument]] (argument from design), and other aspects of what was called ''[[natural theology|natural religion]]''. Deism has become identified with the classical belief that God created but does not intervene in the world, though this is not a necessary component of deism.
* '''[[Deity]]:''' (or a god) A postulated [[preternatural]] being, usually, but not always, of significant power, [[worship]]ped, thought [[holy]], [[divinity|divine]], or [[sacred]], held in high regard, or respected by [[human]] beings.   They assume a variety of forms, but are frequently depicted as having human or animal form.   Sometimes it is considered [[blasphemous]] to imagine the deity as having any concrete form.   They are usually [[immortality|immortal]].  They are commonly assumed to have personalities and to possess consciousness, intellects, desires, and emotions much like humans.  Such natural phenomena as lightning, floods, storms, other "acts of God”, and [[miracle]]s are attributed to them, and they may be thought to be the authorities or controllers of every aspect of human life (such as birth or the [[afterlife]]).  Some deities are asserted to be the directors of time and fate itself, to be the givers of human law and morality, to be the ultimate judges of human worth and behavior, and to be the designers and creators of the [[Earth]] or the [[universe]].  Some of these "gods" have no power at all-they are simply worshipped.
* '''''[[Dhammapada]]:''''' ([[Pāli|Pali]], translates as ''Path of the [[Dharma]]''. Also [[Prakrit]] ''Dhamapada'', [[Sanskrit]] ''Dharmapada'') A [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[religion|religious]] [[scripture]], containing 423 [[Verse (poetry)|verse]]s in 26 categories. According to tradition, these are answers to questions put to [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]] on various occasions, most of which deal with [[ethics]].
* '''[[Dharma]]:''' ([[sanskrit]], roughly ''law'' or ''way'') The way of the higher Truths. Beings that live in harmony with Dharma proceed quicker towards ''[[moksha]]'', [[nirvana]], or personal [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|liberation]], a concept first taught in [[India]]n religions ([[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]]).
* '''[[Dhikr]]:''' Arabic. ("pronouncement", "[[invocation]]" or "[[Memorial|remembrance]]") also spelled ''zikr'' based on its pronunciation in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Persian language|Persian]].
:Dhikr is the remembrance of God commanded in the [[Qur'an]] for all [[Muslims]]. To engage in dhikr is to have awareness of God according to [[Islam]]. Dhikr as a devotional act includes the repetition of divine names, supplications and aphorisms from [[hadith]] literature, and sections of the Qur'an. More generally, any activity in which the Muslim maintains awareness of God is considered dhikr.

==E==

* '''[[Emanationism]]:''' Technically is a [[henotheism]] component in the [[cosmology]] of certain [[religion|religious]] or philosophical systems that argue a Supreme Being did not directly create the physical [[universe]], but instead ''emanated'' lower spiritual beings who created the world.
* '''[[Enlightenment (spiritual)|Enlightenment]]:''' As a concept is related to the [[Buddhist]] ''[[Bodhi]]'' but is a cornerstone of religious and [[spirituality|spiritual]] understanding in practically all [[religion]]s. It literally means being illuminated by acquiring new wisdom or understanding.
* '''[[Entheogen]]:''' A modern term derived from two Ancient Greek words, ἔνθεος (''entheos'') and γενέσθαι (''genesthai''). ''Entheos'' means literally "in God", more freely translated "inspired". The Greeks used it as a term of praise for poets and other artists. ''Genesthai'' means "to cause to be". So an entheogen is "that which causes (a person) to be in God". The translation "creating the divine within" that is sometimes given is not quite correct -- ''entheogen'' implies neither that something is created (as opposed to just perceiving something that is already there) nor that that which is experienced is ''within'' the user (as opposed to having independent existence).
* '''[[Epigenesis (creative intelligences)|Epigenesis]]:''' The [[philosophical]]/[[theology|theological]]/[[Esoteric knowledge|esoteric]] idea that since the [[mind]] was given to the human being, it is this original creative impulse, epigenesis, which has been the cause of all of [[Human|mankind]]'s development.
* '''[[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]]:''' ({{lang-el|επιφάνεια}}, "the appearance; miraculous phenomenon") A [[Christian]] feast intended to celebrate the 'shining forth' or revelation of God to mankind in human form, in the person of [[Jesus]]. The observance had its origins in the eastern Christian churches, and included the birth of Jesus; the visit of the three [[Biblical Magi|Magi]] (Caspar, Melchior and Balthasar) who arrived in [[Bethlehem]]; and all of Jesus' childhood events, up to his [[baptism]] in the Jordan by [[John the Baptist]].  The feast was initially based on, and viewed as a fulfillment of, the Jewish [[Hanukkah|Feast of Lights]].  This was fixed on January 6.
* '''[[Eschatology]]:''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''eschatos'' meaning "last" + ''[[-logy]]'') A part of [[theology]] concerned with the final events in the [[history of the world]] or the ultimate [[destiny|fate]] of [[human kind]], commonly phrased as the end of the world. In many [[religion]]s, the end of the world is a future event [[prophecy|prophesied]] in [[sacred text]]s or [[folklore]]. More broadly, eschatology may encompass related concepts such as the [[messiah]] or messianic era, the [[afterlife]], and the [[soul]].
* '''[[Esotericism]]:''' Refers to knowledge suitable only for the advanced, privileged, or initiated, as opposed to [[exotericism|exoteric knowledge]], which is public. It is used especially for [[Mysticism|mystical]], [[occult]] and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] viewpoints.
* '''[[Eternal return]]:''' (or sometimes eternal recurrence) A concept originating from ancient Egypt and developed in the teachings of [[Pythagoras]].
* '''[[Eternity]]:''' While in the popular mind, eternity often simply means existing for an [[Infinity|infinite]], i.e., limitless, amount of [[time]], many have used it to refer to a timeless existence altogether outside of time.  There are a number of [[arguments for eternity]], by which proponents of the concept, principally, [[Aristotle]], purported to prove that matter, motion, and time must have existed eternally.
* '''[[Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism]]:''' Eutheism and dystheism are [[dialectic]] opposites within the spectrum of [[theism|theistic]] religious beliefs.
:* Eutheism is the belief that [[God]] exists and is [[Goodness and value theory|good]].
:* Dystheism is the belief that God exists but is ''not'' good.

* '''[[Existence]]:''' There is no universally accepted theory of what the word existence means.  The dominant (though by no means universal) view in twentieth-century and contemporary Anglo-American philosophy is that existence is what is asserted by statements of [[first-order logic]] of the form "for some x Fx".  This agrees with the simple and commonsensical view that, in uttering "There is a bridge across the Thames at Hammersmith", or "A bridge crosses the Thames at Hammersmith", we are asserting the ''existence'' of a bridge across the Thames at Hammersmith.  The word "existence", on this view, is simply a way of describing the [[logical form (linguistics)|logical form]] of ordinary subject-predicate sentence.
* '''[[Exorcism]]:''' The practice of evicting [[demon]]s or other evil [[spiritual being|spiritual entities]] which are supposed to have [[spiritual possession|possessed]] (taken control of) a person or object. The practice, though ancient in roots, is still part of the belief system of many [[religion]]s. The word "exorcism" means "I cause [someone] to swear," referring to the exorcist forcing the spirit to obey a higher power.

==F==

* '''[[Faith healing]]:''' The use of solely [[spirituality|spiritual]] means in treating [[disease]], sometimes accompanied with the refusal of modern [[medicine|medical]] techniques. Another term for this is spiritual healing. Faith healing is a form of [[alternative medicine]].
* '''[[Fasting]]:''' The act of willingly abstaining from all [[food]]  and in some cases [[drink]], for a period of time. Depending on the tradition, fasting practices may forbid [[sexual intercourse]], (or any sexual desire), [[masturbation]], as well as refraining from eating certain types or groups of food (e.g. [[meat]]).
:Fasting for religious and spiritual reasons has been a part of human custom since pre-history. It is mentioned in the [[Qur'an]], in the [[Mahabharata]], in the [[Upanishads]], and in the [[Bible]], in both the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]].

==G==
* '''[[Glossolalia]]:''' (from the Greek, "γλώσσα" (glossa), tongue and "λαλώ" (lalô), to speak) comprises the utterance of what appears (to the casual listener) either as an unknown foreign language (xenoglossia), meaningless syllables, or utterance of an unknown mystical language; the utterances sometimes occur as part of religious worship (religious glossolalia) and are commonly referred to in such circles as "speaking in tongues".
* '''[[Gnosticism]]:''' A blanket term for various mystical initiatory [[religions]], [[sects]] and knowledge schools, which were most prominent in the first few centuries AD. It is also applied to modern revivals of these groups and, sometimes, by analogy to all religious movements based on secret knowledge gnosis, thus can lead to confusion.
* '''[[God]]:''' The term God is capitalized in the [[English language]] as a [[proper noun]] when used to refer to a specific [[monotheistic]] concept of a [[supernatural]] Supreme Being in accordance with [[Christianity|Christian]], [[Judaism|Jewish]] (sometimes as "G-d" - cf. [[Names of God in Judaism]]), and more recently (in the U.S.A) [[Islam|Muslim]] and some [[Hindu]] traditions.
* '''[[Goddess]]:''' a female deity in polytheistic religions.
* '''[[Great Awakening]]s:''' Commonly said to be periods of religious revival in Anglo-American religious history. They have also been described as periodic revolutions in American religious thought. The Great Awakenings appear to form a cycle, with a period of roughly 80 years. There are three generally accepted Great Awakenings in American history: The [[First Great Awakening]] (1730s - 1740s); The [[Second Great Awakening]] (1820s - 1830s); The [[Third Great Awakening]] (1880s - 1900s).
* Sri '''[[Guru Granth Sahib]]''' Ji ({{lang-pa|ਸ੍ਰੀ ਗੁਰੂ ਗ੍ਰੰਥ ਸਾਹਿਬ ਜੀ}}): ''Granth'' is [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] for book; ''Sahib'' is [[Hindi]] meaning master, from [[Arabic language|Arabic]], meaning companion, friend, owner, or master&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;  is more than a holy book of the [[Sikh]]s. The Sikhs treat this Granth (''holy book'') as a living [[Guru]]. The holy text spans 1430 pages and contains the actual words spoken by [[the Ten Gurus of Sikhism|the founders of the Sikh religion]] and various other [[Saint]]s from other religions including [[Hinduism]] and [[Islam]].
* '''[[Guru]]:''' ({{lang-sa|गुरू}}, {{lang-pa|ਗੁਰੂ}}) A teacher in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] or [[Sikhism]]. Based on a long line of [[philosophy|philosophical]] understanding as to  the importance of knowledge,  the guru is seen in these religions as a sacred [[Conduit (spiritualism)|conduit]], or a way to [[self-realization (disambiguation)|self-realization]]. In [[India]] and among people of [[Hindu]], [[Buddhist]], or [[Sikh]] belief, the title retains a hallowed meaning.
:Guru also refers in Sanskrit to ''[[Brihaspati]]'', a Hindu figure analogous to the Roman planet/god [[Jupiter]]. In [[Vedic astrology]], Jupiter/Guru/Brihaspati is believed to exert teaching influences.  Indeed, in many [[Languages of India|Indian languages]], such as [[Hindi]],  the occidental Thursday is called either ''Brihaspativaar'' or ''Guruvaar'' (''vaar'' meaning period or day).
:In contemporary India and [[Indonesia]], guru is widely used within the general meaning  of "teacher".  In Western usage, the original meaning of guru has been extended to cover anyone who acquires followers, and  not necessarily in an established school of philosophy or religion.  In a further metaphorical extension, guru is used of a person who has authority because of his or her perceived knowledge or skills in a domain of expertise.
:The importance of discerning between a true guru and a false one is explored in scriptures and teachings of religions in which a guru plays a role. The assessment and criticism of gurus and the [[Guru-shishya tradition]] are espoused in the discourse about [[cult]]s and [[new religious movement]]s by Western secular scholars, [[theology|theologians]], [[anti-cult movement|anti-cultists]], and by [[Scientific skepticism|skeptics]] both in the West and in India.

==H==
* '''[[Hymn]]:''' A song specifically written as a [[song]] of praise, adoration or [[prayer]], typically addressed to a [[deity|god]].
:A writer of hymns is known as a hymnist or hymnodist, and the process of singing a hymn is called ''hymnody''; the same word is used for the collectivity of hymns belonging to a particular denomination or period (e.g. "nineteenth century Methodist hymnody" would mean the body of hymns written and/or used by Methodists in the nineteenth century).  Books called [[hymnal]]s are collections of hymns, which may or may not include music.
:Ancient hymns include the ''[[Great Hymn to the Aten]]'', composed by the [[pharaoh]] [[Akhenaten]], and the [[Veda]]s, a collection of hymns in the tradition of [[Hinduism]]. The Western tradition of hymnody begins with  the [[Homeric Hymns]], a collection of ancient Greek hymns, the oldest of which were written in the 7th century BCE  in praise of the gods of [[Greek mythology]].

==I==
* '''''[[I Ching]]:'''''  The oldest of the [[Chinese classic texts]]. It describes an ancient system of [[cosmology]] and [[philosophy]] which is at the heart of Chinese cultural beliefs.  The philosophy centers on the ideas of ''the dynamic balance of opposites'', ''the evolution of events as a process,'' and ''acceptance of the inevitability of change'' (see ''Philosophy'', below). In [[Western world|Western]] cultures, the ''I Ching'' is regarded by some as simply a system of [[divination]]; others believe it expresses the wisdom and philosophy of [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]].
* '''[[Iconolatry]]:''' (from the two [[Greek language|Greek]] terms ''eikon'' denoting simply a picture or image, and ''latreia'' to adore or worship) [[Icon]] in Greek simply denotes a picture but has now come to be closely associated with religious art used by the [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]]es. Icons are used by Orthodox Churches to assist in [[prayer]] and [[worship]] of God. Icon (image) is the same word used in the [[Bible]] in Genesis 1:27, Colossians 1:15.
* '''[[Inner peace]]:''' (or peace of mind) A [[colloquialism]] that refers to a state of [[being]] [[mind|mentally]] or [[spirituality|spiritually]] at [[peace]], with enough [[knowledge]] and [[understanding]] to keep oneself strong in the face of discord or [[Stress (medicine)|stress]].  Being "at peace" is considered by many to be healthy ([[homeostasis]]) and the opposite of being stressed or anxious.  Peace of mind is generally associated with bliss and [[happiness]]. Most religious people believe that it is only truly possible to achieve inner peace with [[Miracle|divine intervention]] of some form or another.
:Peace of mind, serenity, and calmness are descriptions of a disposition free from the effects of stress.  In some cultures, inner peace is considered a state of [[consciousness]] or [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] that may be cultivated by various forms of training, such as [[prayer]], [[meditation]], [[T'ai chi ch'uan|T'ai Chi Ch'uan]] or [[yoga]], for example.  Many spiritual practices refer to this peace as an experience of [[Know thyself|knowing oneself]].

* '''[[Integrity]]:''' Comprises the personal inner sense of "wholeness" deriving from [[honesty]] and consistent uprightness of [[moral character|character]]. The etymology of the word relates it to the Latin adjective ''integer'' (whole, complete).  Evaluators, of course, usually assess integrity from some [[perspective (cognitive)|point of view]], such as that of a given [[ethical tradition]] or in the context of an [[ethical relationship]].
* '''[[Involution (esoterism)|Involution]]:''' the process by which the Divine manifests the [[cosmos]] is called involution.  The process by which the creation rises to higher states and states of [[consciousness]] is the [[evolution]].  Involution prepares the [[universe]] for the [[Big Bang]]; evolution continues from that point forward.  The term ''involution'' comes from the idea that the divine ''involves'' itself in creation.
:After the creation, the Divine (i.e. [[the Absolute]], [[Brahman]], [[God]]; all these essentially mean the same thing) is both the [[singular god|One]] (the Creator) and the Many (that which was created).

==J==
* '''[[Japa]]:''' (or Japam) A spiritual discipline in which a devotee repeats a [[mantra]] or the name of the [[God]]. The repetition can be aloud or just the movement of lips or in the mind. This [[spiritual practice]] is present in the major [[religions]] of world. This is considered as one of the most effective spiritual practices.
*  '''[[Jihad]]:''' ({{lang-ar|جهاد}} ''jihād'') An [[List of Islamic terms in Arabic|Islamic term]], from the Arabic root ''jhd'' ("to exert utmost effort, to strive, struggle"), which connotes a wide range of meanings: anything from an inward spiritual struggle to attain perfect [[faith]] to a political or military struggle to further the Islamic cause. The meaning of "Islamic cause" is of course open to interpretation. The term is frequently mistranslated into English as "[[religious war|holy war]]", although jihad can apply to warfare. Mainstream Muslims consider jihad to be the most misunderstood aspect of their religion by non-Muslims. The Islamic religious legitimacy of the goals or methods of various [[Islamism|Islamist]] movements who adopt the terminology of jihad is often brought into question, usually by moderate and [[liberal movements within Islam|liberal Muslims]].

==K==
* '''[[Karma]]:''' ([[Sanskrit]]: कर्म from the root kri, "to do", meaning ''deed'') or Kamma ([[Pāli|Pali]]: meaning ''action, effect, destiny'') A term in several [[India]]n religions that comprises the entire cycle of [[Causality|cause and effect]].  Karma is a sum of all that an individual has done and is currently doing. The effects of those deeds actively create present and future experiences, thus making one responsible for one's own life. In religions that incorporate [[reincarnation]], karma extends through one's present life and all past and future lives as well.
*  '''[[Koan]]:''' A [[narrative|story]], [[dialog]], question, or statement in the history and lore of [[Zen|Chan]] ([[Zen]]) [[Buddhism]], generally containing aspects that are inaccessible to [[rationality|rational]] understanding, yet that may be accessible to [[Intuition (knowledge)|Intuition]].  Koans are often used by Zen practitioners as objects of [[meditation]] to induce an experience of [[bodhi|enlightenment]] or realization, and by Zen teachers as ''testing questions'' when a student wishes to validate their experience of enlightenment.

==L==
* '''[[Love]]:''' Has many different meanings in [[English language|English]], from something that gives a little pleasure ("I loved that meal") to something one would die for ([[patriotism]], pairbonding). It can describe an intense feeling of [[affection]], an [[emotion]] or an emotional state. In ordinary use, it usually refers to interpersonal love. Probably due to its psychological relevance, love is one of the most common themes in art.
:Just as there are many types of lovers, there are many kinds of love. Love is inherent in all human cultures. It is precisely these cultural differences that make any universal definition of love difficult to establish. See the [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]].
:Expressions of love may include the love for a "soul" or mind, the love of laws and organizations, love for a body, love for nature, love of food, love of money, love for learning, love of power, love of fame, love for the respect of others, et cetera.  Different people place varying degrees of importance on the kinds of love they receive. Love is essentially an abstract concept, easier to experience than to explain.

==M==

* '''[[Mantra]]:''' A [[religion|religious]] [[syllable]] or [[poem]], typically from the [[Sanskrit]] language. Their use varies according to the school and philosophy associated with the mantra. They are primarily used as [[Conduit (spiritualism)|spiritual conduit]]s, words and vibrations that instill one-pointed [[concentration]] in the devotee. Other purposes have included religious ceremonies to  accumulate wealth, avoid danger, or eliminate enemies. Mantras originated in [[India]] with Vedic [[Hinduism]] and were later adopted by [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] and [[Jainism|Jains]], now popular in various modern forms of spiritual practice which are loosely based on practices of these Eastern religions.
* '''[[Meaning of life]]:''' The question “What is the meaning of life?” means different things to different people.  The ambiguity of the query is inherent in the word “meaning”, which opens the question to many interpretations, such as: ''“What is the [[origin of life]]?”'', ''“What is the [[nature]] of life (and of the [[universe]] in which we live)?”'', ''“What is the [[importance|significance]] of life?”'', ''“What is [[Value theory|valuable]] in life?”'', and ''“What is the purpose of, or in, (one's) life?”''.  These questions have resulted in a wide range of competing answers and arguments, from practical [[science|scientific]] theories, to [[philosophy|philosophical]], [[theology|theological]] and [[spirituality|spiritual]] explanations.  Similar questions people ask themselves about the origin and purpose of life are “Why am I here?” and “Why are we here?”.
* '''[[Meditation]]:''' Refers to any of a wide variety of spiritual practices (and their close secular analogues) which emphasize mental activity or quiescence. The English word comes from the [[Latin]] ''meditatio'', which could perhaps be better translated as "[[contemplation]]." This usage is found in [[Christian]] [[spirituality]], for example, when one "meditates" on the sufferings of Christ; as well as Western philosophy, as in [[René Descartes|Descartes']] ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'', a set of six mental exercises which systematically analyze the nature of reality.
:In the late nineteenth century, [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophists]] adopted "meditation" to refer to various spiritual practices drawn from [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and other [[Eastern religions]]. Thus the English word "meditation" does not exclusively translate any single term or concept from the sacred languages of Asia, such as the [[Sanskrit]] ''[[wikt:dhyana|dhyana]]'', ''[[samādhi]]'', or ''[[pranayama]]''. (Note that whereas in Eastern religions meditation is often a central part of religious/spiritual practice, in Christianity it is rather a fringe activity if practised at all.)

* '''[[Metaphysics]]:''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] words ''meta'' = after/beyond and ''physics'' = nature) A branch of [[philosophy]] concerned with the study of "first principles" and "being" ([[ontology]]). Problems that were not originally considered metaphysical have been added to metaphysics.  Other problems that were considered metaphysical problems for centuries are now typically relegated to their own separate subheadings in philosophy, such as [[philosophy of religion]], [[philosophy of mind]], [[philosophy of perception]], [[philosophy of language]], and [[philosophy of science]]. In rare cases subjects of metaphysical research have been found to be entirely physical and natural, thus making them part of [[physics]].
* '''[[Mind's eye]]:''' (or third eye) A phrase used to refer to one's ability to "[[visualize|see]]" things (such as [[vision (religion)|visions]]) with the [[mind]]. This is, essentially, a reference to [[imagination]] and [[memory]], although it can have [[religion|religious]] or [[occult]] connotations. Also, the term "third eye" has been associated with the [[Pineal gland]].  It is a commonly held belief that in some practices (such as the ones described below) are actually referring to and studying the Pineal Gland.
* '''[[Miracle]]:''' According to many [[religion]]s, a miracle, derived from the [[Latin]] word ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#miraculum|miraculum]]'' meaning 'something wonderful', is a striking interposition of  divine intervention by [[God]] in the [[universe]] by which the operations of the ordinary course of [[Nature]] are overruled, suspended, or modified. One must keep in mind that in [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and in other faiths people have substantially different definitions of the word ''miracle''. Even within a specific religion there is often more than one usage of the term.
:Sometimes the term ''miracle'' may refer to the action of a [[supernatural]] being that is not a god. Then the term divine intervention refers specifically to the direct involvement of a deity.

* '''[[Moksha]]:''' ([[Sanskrit]]: मोक्ष, ''liberation'') or Mukti ([[Sanskrit]]: विमुक्ति, ''release'') Refers, in general, to liberation from the [[samsara|cycle]] of death and [[reincarnation|rebirth]]. In higher [[Hindu philosophy]], it is seen as a transcendence of phenomenal being, of any sense of [[consciousness]] of [[time]], [[space]], and [[Causality|causation]] ([[karma]]). It is not seen as a [[soteriology|soteriological]] goal in the same sense as in, say, a [[Christian]] context, but signifies dissolution of the sense of self, or [[Ego (religion)|ego]], and the overall breakdown of ''nama-roopa'' (name-form). It is, in [[Hinduism]], viewed as analogous to [[Nirvana]], though [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] thought tends to differ with even the [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita Vedantist]] reading of liberation. [[Jainism]] and [[Surat Shabd Yoga|Surat Shabda Yoga]] traditions also believe in Moksha.
* '''[[Muraqaba]]:''' The [[Sufi]] word for [[meditation]]. Literally it means "to watch over", "to take care of" or "to keep an eye". [[Metaphor]]ically, it implies that with meditation, a person watches over or takes care of his spiritual heart (or soul), and acquires knowledge about it, its surroundings and its creator.
* '''[[Mysticism]]:''' From the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|μυω}} (''mueo'', "to conceal"), is the pursuit of achieving communion with or conscious awareness of [[ultimate reality]], the [[divinity|divine]], [[Spirituality|spiritual truth]], or [[God]] through direct, personal experience (intuition or insight) rather than rational thought; the belief in the existence of realities beyond perceptual or intellectual apprehension that are central to being and directly accessible through personal experience; or the belief that such experience is a genuine and important source of knowledge. In the [[Hellenistic]] world, "mystical" referred to secret religious rituals.

==N==
* '''[[Nasma]]:''' A body made of the purest form of light (called Noor) which is more pure than any visible color. Shah Wali Ullah was the first who give hints about this body. Qalandar Baba Auliya give its more details while [[Khwaja Shamsuddin Azeemi]] thoroughly described that body. This body is actually that is controlling the human physical body. The lights coming from Nasma to material body are visible only through [[Kirlian photography]]. These visible lights are called Aura.
* '''[[Neopaganism]]:''' (sometimes Neo-Paganism) Describes a heterogeneous group of [[new religious movement]]s which attempt to revive ancient, mainly pre-[[Christian]] and often pre-[[Judaic]] [[Indo-European religion]]s.  As the name implies, these religions are [[Paganism|Pagan]] in nature, though their exact relationship to older forms of Paganism is the source of much contention.
* '''[[New Age]]:''' Describes a broad movement of late twentieth century and contemporary [[Western culture]] characterised by an individual eclectic approach to [[spirituality|spiritual]] exploration. It has some attributes of a new, emerging religion but is currently a loose network of spiritual seekers, teachers, healers and other participants. The name "New Age" also refers to the [[market segment]] in which goods and services are sold to people in the movement.
* '''[[Nirvana]]:''' In the Indian religions [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Hinduism]],  nirvāna (from the [[Sanskrit]] निर्वाण, [[Pāli|Pali]]: Nibbāna -- [[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 涅槃; [[Pinyin]]: niè pán), literally "extinction" and/or "extinguishing", is the culmination of the yogi's pursuit of liberation.  [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha Gautama]], the Buddha, described the [[Dharma]] as a [[raft]] which, after floating across a [[river]], will enable the passenger to reach nirvana. [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]] also use the word nirvana to describe the state of [[moksha]], and it is spoken of in several Hindu [[Tantra|tantric]] texts as well as the [[Bhagavad Gita]].
* '''[[Nondualism]]:''' The belief that [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] or [[dichotomy]] are illusory phenomenae.  Examples of dualisms include self/other, mind/body, male/female, good/evil, active/passive, and many others.  A nondual [[philosophical]] or [[religious]] perspective or [[theory]] maintains that there is no fundamental distinction between [[mind]] and [[matter]], or that the entire phenomenological world is an illusion (with the reality being described variously as the Void, the Is, Emptiness, or the Mind of God).

==P==
* '''[[Pandeism]]:''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''pan''=all, ''en''=in and [[Latin]] ''[[Deus]]''=God; "all-in-God") is a term generally used to describe philosophical systems, often mixing elements of [[pantheism]] and [[deism]]. This use has been inconsistent over time.
* '''[[Panentheism]]''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] words: ''pan''=all, ''en''=in and ''Theos''=God; "all-in-God") is the view that [[God]] is both [[immanent]] within all [[creation myth|creation]], and also maintains a [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] character.
* '''[[Pantheism]]:''' ({{lang-el|pan}} = all and ''Theos'' = God) Literally means "[[God]] is [[The All|All]]" and "All is God". It is the view that everything is of an all-encompassing [[immanent]] God; or that the [[universe]], or [[nature]], and God are equivalent. More detailed definitions tend to emphasize the idea that [[natural law]], [[existence]] and/or the [[universe]] (the [[Absolute Infinite|sum total]] of all that it was and shall be) is represented or personified in the [[Theology|theological]] principle of 'God'.
* '''[[Parapsychology]]:''' The study of the evidence involving phenomena where a person seems to affect or to gain information about something through a means not currently explainable within the framework of mainstream, conventional [[science]]. Proponents of the existence of these phenomena usually consider them to be a product of unexplained mental abilities.
* '''[[Physical universe]]:''' The part of the universe composed of [[matter]], as opposed to a [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[supernatural]] essence.
* '''[[Pilgrimage]]:''' A term primarily used in [[religion]] and [[spirituality]] of a long [[Quest|journey]] or [[wikt:Search|search]] of great [[moral]] significance.  Sometimes, it is a journey to a sacred place or [[shrine]] of importance to a person's [[belief]]s and [[faith]].  Members of every religion participate in pilgrimages.  A person who makes such a journey is called a [[pilgrim]].
* '''[[Plane (cosmology)]]:''' In [[metaphysics]] and [[esoteric cosmology]], a plane of existence (sometimes called simply a plane, dimension, vibrating plane, or an inner, invisible, spiritual, supraphysical world or [[World egg|egg]]) is a theoretical region of [[space]] and/or [[consciousness]] beyond the known physical [[universe]], or the region containing the universe itself.  Many [[esoteric]] teachings (e.g., [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] and [[rosicrucianism]]) propound the idea of a whole series of subtle planes or worlds or dimensions which, from a center, interpenetrate themselves and the physical [[planet]] in which we live, the [[planetary system|solar systems]], and all the physical structures of the [[universe]]. This interpenetration of planes culminates in the universe itself as a physical structured, dynamic and evolutive expression [[emanationism|emanated]]&amp;nbsp;– through a series of stages, becoming progressively more material and embodied&amp;nbsp;– from ''The Supreme Being'': which allows from Itself the irruption of auto-Singularities, as the ''[[Big Bang]]'', originated from Its unintelligible ''Chaos''.
* '''[[Prayer]]:''' An effort to communicate with  [[God]], or to some [[deity]] or deities, or another form of spiritual entity, or otherwise, either to offer [[praise]], to make a request, or simply to express one's thoughts and emotions.
* '''[[Prophecy]]:''' In a broad sense, is the prediction of future events. The [[etymology]] of the word is ultimately Greek, from ''pro-'' "before" plus the root of ''phanai'' "speak", i. e. "speaking before" or "foretelling", but prophecy often implies the involvement of supernatural phenomena, whether it is communication with a deity, the reading of magical signs, or [[astrology]]. It is also used as a general term for the revelation of divine will.
:Throughout history, people have sought knowledge of future events from special individuals or groups who were thought to have the gift of prophecy, such as [[Oracle]]s at [[Delphi]] in ancient Greece. Cultures in which prophecy played an important role include the [[North American Indians]], [[Maya civilization|Mayan]]s, [[Celt]]s, [[Druid]]s, [[China|Chinese]], [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Assyria]]ns, [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]]s, [[Hindu]]s, [[Hebrews]], [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]], [[Greeks]], and many in the [[Christian]] tradition, among others.

==Q==
* '''[[Qi]]:''' Also commonly spelled ''ch'i'', ''chi'' or ''ki'', is a fundamental concept of everyday [[China|Chinese]] culture, most often defined as "air" or "breath" (for example, the colloquial [[Mandarin Chinese]] term for "[[weather]]" is ''tiān qi'', or the "breath of heaven") and, by extension, "life force" or "spiritual energy" that is part of everything that exists. References to qi or similar philosophical concepts as a type of [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] [[energy]] that sustains living beings are used in many belief systems, especially in [[Asia]].
* '''[[Qigong]]:''' ({{zh|s=气功|t=氣功|p=qìgōng|w=ch'i&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; kung&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}) An increasingly popular aspect of [[Chinese medicine]] involving the coordination of different breathing patterns with various physical postures and motions of the body. Qigong is mostly taught for health maintenance purposes, but there are also some who teach it, especially in China, for therapeutic interventions.  Various forms of traditional qigong are also widely taught in conjunction with [[Chinese martial arts]], and are especially prevalent in the advanced training of what are known as the ''[[neijia]]'' (internal martial arts).

==R==
* '''[[Reality]]:''' In everyday usage means "everything that exists." The term "Reality," in its most liberal sense, includes everything that is, whether or not it is observable, accessible or understandable by science, philosophy, theology or any other system of analysis. Reality in this sense may include both [[being]] and [[nothing]]ness, whereas "[[existence]]" is often restricted to being.
* '''[[Reincarnation]]:''' As a doctrine or [[mysticism|mystical]] belief, holds the notion that one's '[[Spirit]]' ('[[Soul]]' depending on interpretation), 'Higher or True Self', 'Divine Spark', 'I' or 'Ego' (not to be confused with the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] as defined by psychology) or critical parts of these returns to the material world after physical [[death]] to be reborn in a new body. The natural process is considered integrative of all experiences from each lifetime. A new [[wikt:personality|personality]] feature, with the  associated [[moral character|character]], is developed during each life in the physical world, based upon past integrated experience and new acquired experiences. Some Reincarnation theories express that usually rebirth is made each time in alternated female and male type of bodies. Also that there is interaction between pre-determinism of certain experiences or lessons intended to happen during the physical life, and the [[free-will]] action of the individual as they live that life.
* '''[[Religion]]:''' Sometimes used interchangeably with [[faith]] or [[belief]] system&amp;mdash;is commonly defined as belief concerning the [[supernatural]], [[sacred]], or [[divinty|divine]]; and the [[moral code]]s, practices, values, institutions and rituals associated with such belief. In its broadest sense some have defined it as the sum total of answers given to explain humankind's relationship with the universe. In the course of the [[development of religion]], it has taken many forms in various cultures and individuals.  Occasionally, the word "religion" is used to designate what should be more properly described as "organized religion"&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; that is, an organization of people supporting the exercise of some religion, often taking the form of a [[Juristic person|legal entity]] (see [[religion-supporting organization]]). There are many different religions in the world today.
* '''[[Religious ecstasy]]:''' A trance-like state characterized by expanded mental and spiritual awareness and is frequently accompanied by visions, hallucinations, and physical euphoria.  Such an experience usually lasts about a half-hour.  However, there are many records of such experiences lasting several days, and some people claim to have experienced ecstasy over a period of over three decades, or to have recurring experiences of ecstasy during their lifetime.
* '''[[Repentance]]:''' The [[feeling]] and act in which one recognizes and tries to right a wrong, or gain [[forgiveness]] from someone that they wronged. In religious contexts it usually refers to repenting for a sin against [[God]]. It always includes an admission of guilt, and also includes at least one of: a solemn promise or resolve not to repeat the offense; an attempt to make restitution for the wrong, or in some way to reverse the harmful effects of the wrong where possible.
* '''[[Responsibility assumption]]:''' A [[doctrine]] in the [[spirituality]] and [[personal growth]] fields holding that each individual has substantial or total [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] for the events and circumstances that befall them in their [[personal life|life]].
:The term ''responsibility assumption'' thus has a specialized meaning beyond the general concept of taking responsibility for something, and is not to be confused with the general notion of making an assumption that a concept such as "responsibility" exists.

* '''[[Revelation]]:''' Refers to an uncovering or disclosure of that which had been previously wholly or partly hidden via communication from the divine.  In [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] religions, revelation is the process in which [[God]] makes himself, his will, and/or other information known to mankind. The recipient of revelation is commonly referred to as a [[prophet]], and sometimes is termed a messenger.
: There are a number of ways that religious thinkers have traditionally approached this topic; many widely differing views have been proposed.  Generally speaking, one can find all of the following viewpoints in varying segments of [[Judaism]] and in varying groups within [[Christianity]].

* '''[[Revivalism]]:''' A revival is the apparent restoration of a living creature from a dead state to a living state. In a New Testament story, Lazarus was revived by divine intervention.   In religious terms, Revival is the substitution of [[religious]] fervor in life and worship, for an intellectualized, pragmatic approach to everyday conduct (often stigmatized by revivalists as 'pride').
* '''[[Ritual]]:''' A formalised, predetermined set of [[symbol]]ic actions generally performed in a particular environment at a regular, recurring interval. The set of actions that comprise a ritual often include, but are not limited to, such things as recitation, [[singing]], group processions, repetitive [[dance]], manipulation of [[sacred]] objects, etc. The general purpose of rituals is to express some fundamental truth or meaning, evoke spiritual, numinous emotional responses from participants, and/or engage a group of people in unified action to strengthen their communal bonds. The word ritual, when used as an adjective, relates to the noun '[[rite]]', as in ''[[rite of passage]]''.

==S==
* '''[[Sacrifice]]:''' (from a Middle [[English language|English]] verb meaning 'to make sacred', from Old [[French language|French]], from [[Latin]] sacrificium : sacer, sacred; sacred + facere, to make) Commonly known as the practice of offering food, or the lives of animals or people to the [[deity|gods]], as an act of [[propitiation]] or [[worship]]. The term is also used [[metaphor]]ically to describe selfless good deeds for others.
* '''[[Sadhana]]:''' [[spirituality|Spiritual]] exercise by a [[Sadhu]] or a [[Sadhaka]] to attain a desired goal. The goal of sadhana is to attain some stage, which can be either [[moksha]], liberation from the cycle of birth and death ([[Samsara]]), or a particular goal such as the blessing by a deity through his or her appearance before the Sadhaka at the end of the limited Sadhana. Sadhana can involve [[meditation]], [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]] to a deity, namasmarana (sometimes with the help of a [[Hindu prayer beads|japa mala]]), [[mortification of the flesh]] or unorthodox practices such as in a smashana sadhana on a cremation ground. Each type of Yoga entails its own type of sadhana. To embark on a sadhana, a [[guru]] is required to give one the necessary know-how and the seed for the future result, in the form of some [[diksha]], initiation, which he or she has received from his or her guru.
* '''[[Saint]]:''' Generally refers to someone who is exceptionally virtuous and [[holy]]. It can be applied to both the living and the dead and is an acceptable term in most of the world's popular religions. The Saint is held up by the community as an example of how we all should act, and his or her life story is usually recorded for the edification of future generations.
:The process of officially recognizing a person as a Saint, practiced by some churches, is called [[canonization]], though many [[Protestant]] groups use the less formal, broader usage seen in [[Bible|Scripture]] to include all who are faithful as saints.

* '''[[Salvation]]:''' Refers to deliverance from undesirable state or condition. In [[theology]], the study of salvation is called soteriology and is a vitally important concept in several religions.  [[Christianity]] regards salvation as deliverance from the bondage of [[sin]] and from condemnation, resulting in eternal life with [[God]].
* '''[[Satguru]]:''' (or Sadguru) Means true [[guru]] (Sanskrit सदगुरू sat=true), literally: true teacher. The title means that his students have [[faith]] that the guru can be [[Trust (sociology)|trusted]] and will lead them to [[moksha]], [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] or [[inner peace]]. It is based on a long line of Hindu philosophical understandings of the importance of knowledge and that the teacher, guru, is the sacred [[Conduit (spiritualism)|conduit]] to self-realization.
* '''[[SBNR]]:''' Acronym used by individuals who define themselves as Spiritual But Not Religious.
* '''[[Seven Virtues]]:''' Derived from the [[Psychomachia]], an epic poem written by [[Prudentius]] (c. 410). Practicing these [[virtue]]s is alleged to protect one against temptation toward the [[Seven Deadly Sins]]. The ''Seven Virtues'' considered by the [[Roman Catholic]] church are those of [[humility]], [[meekness]], [[Charity (virtue)|charity]], [[chastity]], [[moderation]], [[Diligence|zeal]] and [[generosity]]. These are considered to be the polar opposite of the [[seven deadly sins]], namely [[pride]], [[wrath]], [[envy]], [[lust]], [[gluttony]], [[sloth]] and [[Seven deadly sins#Greed|greed]].
* '''[[Shabd]]:''' (or Shabda) Literally means “sound” or “word” in Sanskrit.  Esoterically, Shabd is the “Sound Current vibrating in all creation. It can be heard by the inner ears.”  Variously referred to as the Audible Life Stream, Inner Sound, Sound Current or Word in English, the Shabd is the [[Esotericism|esoteric]] essence of [[God]] which is available to all human beings, according to the [[:Category:Shabd paths|Shabd path]] teachings of [[Eckankar]], the [[Quan Yin Method]], [[Sant Mat]] and [[Surat Shabd Yoga]].
:Adherents believe that a [[Satguru]], or [[ECK Master]], who is a [[human]] being, has merged with the Shabd in such a manner that he or she is a living manifestation of it at its highest level (the “Word made flesh”). However, not only can the Satguru can attain this, but all human beings are inherently privileged in this way. Indeed, in Sant Mat the raison d’être for the human form is to meditate on the Sound Current, and in so doing merge with it until one’s own divinity is ultimately realized.

* '''[[Shamanism]]:''' Refers to the traditional healing and religious practices of [[Northern Asia]] ([[Siberia]]) and [[Mongolia]]. By extension, the concept of shamanism has been extended in common language to a range of traditional beliefs and practices that involve the ability to diagnose, cure, and sometimes cause human suffering by traversing the [[axis mundi]] and forming a special relationship with, or gaining control over, [[spiritual being|spirits]].  Shamans have been credited with the ability to control the weather, [[divination]], the interpretation of dreams, [[astral projection]], and traveling to upper and lower worlds.  Shamanistic traditions have existed throughout the world since prehistoric times.
* '''[[Shinto]]:''' (神道 ''Shintō'') (sometimes called Shintoism) A native [[religion]] of [[Japan]] and was once its [[state religion]]. It involves the worship of ''[[kami]]'', which can be translated to mean [[deity|gods]], [[spirit]]s of nature, or just spiritual presences. Some kami are local and can be regarded as the [[spiritual being|spirit]] or [[genius (mythology)|genius]] of a particular place, but others represent major natural objects and processes, for example, [[Amaterasu]], the [[Sun goddess]]. The word Shinto was created by combining two [[kanji]]: "神" ''shin'' meaning god (the character can also be read as "kami" in Japanese) and "道" ''tō'' meaning [[Tao]] ("way" or "path" in a [[philosophical]] sense). Thus, Shinto means "the way of the gods."
:After World War II, Shinto lost its status of [[state religion]]; some Shinto practices and teachings, once given a great deal of prominence during the war, are no longer taught nor practiced today, and some remain largely as everyday activities without religious connotations like [[omikuji]] (a form of [[sortition]]).

* '''[[Shunyata]]:''' (Śūnyatā, शून्यता ([[Sanskrit]], [[Pāli|Pali]]: {{Sunnata}}), or "Emptiness") In [[Buddhist]] [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] critique and Buddhist [[epistemology]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], shunyata signifies that everything one encounters in life is empty of soul, permanence, and self-nature. Everything is inter-related, never self-sufficient or independent; nothing has independent reality. Yet shunyata never connotes [[nihilism]], which Buddhist doctrine considers to be a delusion, just as it considers [[materialism]] to be a delusion.
* '''[[Simran (Sanskrit word)|Simran]]:''' 'Simran', derived from the word 'Smarana,' (from Sanskrit), means: remembering or contemplating on the highest&amp;nbsp;– that which should be valued in memory, in general. It teaches that: everything changes while inner and outer purity naturally happen. Smarana does not project about restriction through God or religion. It shows that remembering the highest aspect of life that one has seen will eventually open up what's important to an individual.
* '''[[Soul]]:''' The soul, according to many [[Religion|religious]] and [[Philosophy|philosophical]] traditions, is the ''ethereal substance''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; [[spirit]] ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]:''[[rooah]]'' or ''[[nefesh]]'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; particular to a unique living [[being]]. Such traditions often consider the soul both [[Immortality|immortal]] and innately aware of its immortal nature, as well as the true basis for [[sentience]] in each living being.
:The concept of the soul has strong links with notions of an [[afterlife]], but opinions may vary wildly, even within a given religion, as to what happens to the soul after [[death]]. Many within these religions and philosophies see the soul as immaterial, while others consider it possibly material.

* '''[[Spirit]]:''' The English word spirit comes from the [[Latin]] ''spiritus'', meaning breath. In [[religion]] and [[spirituality]], the [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] of the human being has for obvious reasons been strongly linked with the very occurrence of life. A similar significance has been attributed to human [[blood]]. ''Spirit'' has thus evolved to denote that which separates a living body from a corpse, but can be used metaphorically (she performed the piece with spirit or she put up a spirited defence) where it is a synonym for such words as 'vivacity'.
* '''[[Spiritism]]:''' A religious and philosophic doctrine established in France in the mid-19th century by [[Allan Kardec]]. The term was coined by him as the specific name of the doctrine he was about to publish but, given the fact that the word was created from roots taken from the common language, it was soon incorporated into the normal use and has been used to name other doctrines as well, though the authentic Spiritists protest against this usage.
: During the late 19th century, many well educated people from [[Europe]] and the [[United States]] embraced Spiritism as a logical explanation of themes related to the Christian Revelation. Most of the initial enthusiasm receded, while in some places the work of a few dedicated preachers managed to achieve a solid foundation.
:Spiritism is not to be confused with [[spiritualism]]. Its use with that meaning is regarded as pejorative by both Spiritualists and Spiritists. Uncapitalised, the word, in English, is an obsolete term for [[animism]] and other religious practices involving the [[invocation]] of [[spiritual beings]], including [[shamanism]].

* '''[[Spiritual evolution]]:''' The [[philosophical]]/[[theology|theological]]/[[Esoteric knowledge|esoteric]] idea that nature and human beings and/or human culture evolve along a predetermined [[cosmology|cosmological]] pattern or ascent, or in accordance with certain pre-determined potentials. Predeterminism of evolution concept is also complemented with the idea of a creative impulse of human beings, known as [[Epigenesis (creative intelligences)|epigenesis]].
:Within this broad definition, theories of spiritual evolution are very diverse.  They may be cosmological (describing existence at large), personal (describing the development of the individual), or both.  They can be [[Holism|holistic]] (holding that higher realities emerge from and are not reducible to the lower),  [[Idealism|idealist]] (holding that reality is primarily mental or spiritual) or [[nondual]] (holding that there is no ultimate distinction between mental and physical reality).  All of them can be considered to be [[teleology|teleological]] to a greater or lesser degree.

* '''[[Spiritualism]]:''' May refer to a variety of modern [[religion|religious]] [[ideology|ideologies]], primarily active in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]].  Central tenets of Spiritualist [[liturgy]] and [[dogma]] are the beliefs and practices of [[Medium (spirituality)|mediumship]] which purports to be evidence of the continued existence of an individual's [[spirit]] or [[soul]] after [[death]]. The origin of Spiritualism is commonly considered to be the [[Modern Spiritualist movement]] of the 19th century [[United States]].
* '''[[Spirituality]]:''' In a narrow sense, is a concern with matters of the [[spirit]], however that may be defined; but it is also a wide term with many available readings. It may include belief in [[supernatural]] powers, as in [[religion]], but the emphasis is on personal experience. It may be an expression for life perceived as higher, more complex or more integrated with one's [[worldview]], as contrasted with the merely sensual.
* '''[[Sufi whirling]]:''' The practice of Sufi whirling (or Sufi spinning), is a twirling [[meditation]] that originated among the ancient [[India]]n mystics and [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[Sufism|Sufi]]s, which is still practiced by the [[Dervish]]es of the [[Mevlevi Order|Mevlevi]] order. Following a recommended fast of several hours, Sufi whirlers begin with hands crossed onto shoulders and may return their hands to this position if they feel dizzy. They rotate on their left feet in short twists, using the right foot to drive their bodies around the left foot. The left foot is like an anchor to the ground, so that if the whirler loses his or her balance, he or she can think of their left foot, direct attention towards it and regain balance back.
* '''[[Sufism]]:''' (Arabic تصوف tas&amp;#803;awwuf) A [[mysticism|mystic]] [[tradition]] of [[Islam]], which is based on the pursuit of spiritual truth as a definite goal to attain. In modern language it might also be referred to as Islamic spirituality or Islamic [[mysticism]]. While [[fiqh]] focuses on the legal aspects of Islam, Sufism focuses on the internal aspects of Islam, such as perfecting the aspect of sincerity of [[faith]] and fighting one's [[Ego (spirituality)|ego]]. Sufi practitioners are organized into a diverse range of brotherhoods and sisterhoods, with a wide diversity of thought. Sufi orders ("[[tariqa]]s") can be [[Shi'a]], [[Sunni]], both or neither.
* '''[[Supplication]]:''' (also known as petitioning) The most common form of [[prayer]], wherein a person asks a [[supernatural]] [[deity]] to provide something, either for that person who is praying or for someone else on whose behalf a prayer of supplication is being made.  One example of supplication is the [[Catholic]] [[ritual]] of [[novena]] (from ''novem'', the Latin word for "nine") wherein one repeatedly asks for the same favor over a period of nine days.  This ritual began in [[France]] and [[Spain]] during the [[Middle Ages]] when a nine-day period of hymns and prayers led up to a [[Christmas]] feast, a period which ended with gift giving. In [[Islam]], the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''du'a'' is often used for supplication.  ''Du'a'' may be made in any language, although there are many traditional Islamic supplications in Arabic, [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]].

==T==
* '''''[[Tao Te Ching]]:''''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 道德經, ''Dào dé jīng'') Roughly translated as ''The Book of the Way and its Virtue'' (see [[#Translations of the title|article]] on translating the title) is an ancient [[Chinese classic texts|Chinese scripture]]. Tradition has it that the book was written around 600 BCE by a sage called [[Laozi]] (WG: Lao Tzu, "Old Master"), a record-keeper in the Emperor's Court of the [[Zhou Dynasty]]. A careful reading of the text, however, suggests that it is a compilation of [[Maxim (saying)|maxims]] sharing similar themes. The authenticity of the date of composition/compilation and the authorship are still debated.
* '''[[Tenrikyo]]:''' (天理教; ''Tenrikyō'', lit. ''Teaching of Divine Reason'', also known as Tenriism) A [[religion]] of [[Japan]]ese [[Shinto]] origin with some [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] influence. It was founded by a female peasant, [[Nakayama Miki]], who underwent a revelatory experience from 1838 onwards. After this date she is referred to as [[Oyasama]] (lit. Honoured Parent) by followers. Tenrikyo is estimated to have about 2 million followers worldwide with 1.5 million of those in Japan.
* '''[[Theism]]:''' The belief in one or more [[deity|god]]s or [[goddess]]es. More specifically, it may also mean the belief in God, a god, or gods, who is/are actively involved in maintaining the [[Universe]]. This secondary meaning is shown in context to other beliefs concerning the divine. The term is attested in English from 1678, and was probably coined to contrast with ''atheism'' attested from ca. 1587.
* '''[[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|Theosis]]:''' In [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Rite Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic]] theology, theosis, meaning ''divinization'' (or woodenly, ''deification'' or, ''to become god''), is the call to man to become [[holy]] and seek union with God, beginning in this life and later consummated in the [[resurrection]]. ''Theosis'' comprehends salvation from sin, is premised upon apostolic and early Christian understanding of the life of faith, and is conceptually foundational in both the East and the West.
* '''[[Tithe]]:''' (from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''teogotha'' "tenth") A one-tenth part of something, paid as a voluntary contribution or as a [[tax]] or levy, usually to support a [[Jewish]] or [[Christian]] religious organization. Today, tithes (or ''tithing'') are normally voluntary and paid in [[money|cash]], [[check (finance)|check]]s, or [[stock]]s, whereas historically tithes could be paid in kind, such as agricultural products. There are still European countries today that allow some churches to assess a mandatory tithe which is enforced by law.
* '''''[[Torah]]:''''' (תורה) A [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word meaning "[[teaching]]," "[[Education|instruction]]," or "[[law]]." It is the central and most important document of [[Judaism]] revered by [[Jew]]s through the ages. It primarily refers to the first section of the [[Tanakh]]&amp;mdash;the first five books of the [[Hebrew Bible]], but the term is sometimes also used in the general sense to also include both of Judaism's written law and [[Oral law#Oral law in Judaism|oral law]], encompassing the entire spectrum of authoritative [[Jew]]ish religious teachings throughout history, including the [[Mishnah]], the [[Talmud]], the [[midrash]], and more.
* '''[[Transcendentalism]]:''' The name of a group of new ideas in [[literature]], [[religion]], [[culture]], and [[philosophy]] that advocates that there is an ideal [[spirituality|spiritual]] state that 'transcends' the physical and empirical and is only realized through a knowledgeable intuitive awareness that is conditional upon the individual. The concept emerged in [[New England]] in the early-to mid-nineteenth century.  It is sometimes called "''American'' ''Transcendentalism''" to distinguish it from other uses of the word ''[[Transcendence (disambiguation)|transcendental]]''. It began as a protest against the general state of culture and [[society]] at the time, and in particular, the state of [[intellectualism]] at [[Harvard]] and the doctrine of the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] church which was taught at [[Harvard Divinity School]].

==U==
* '''[[Unitarian Universalism]]:''' (UU or UUism) A theologically [[Liberalism|liberal]], inclusive [[religion]] formed by the merger of [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] and [[Universalist]] organizations in the mid-20th century. UUs generally: cherish creativity, freedom, and compassion; embrace diversity and interconnectedness; and promote personal spiritual growth and justice-making through worship, fellowship, personal experience, social action, deeds, and education. While one UU may differ from another in personal creed, the term UU is a distinct theological signifier and [[Unitarianism]] or [[Universalism]] should not be confused or interchanged with Unitarian Universalism.

==V==
* '''[[Veneration]]:''' In traditional Christian churches (for example, [[Catholicism]] and [[Eastern Orthodoxy]]), veneration ([[Latin]] ''veneratio'', [[Greek language|Greek]] δουλια ''dulia''), or veneration of saints, is a special act of honoring a dead person who has been identified as singular in the traditions of the religion, and through them honoring [[God]] who made them and in whose image they are made. Veneration is often shown outwardly by respectfully bowing or making the [[sign of the cross]] before a [[saint]]'s [[icon]], [[relic]]s, or [[cult image]]. These items are often also kissed.
* '''[[Vipassana]]:''' (Sanskrit: vipasyanā) The practice of Insight Meditation.  While it is often referred to as [[Buddhist meditation]], the practice taught by the Buddha was non-sectarian, and has a universal application.  It does not require conversion to Buddhism.  While the [[meditation]] practices themselves vary from school to school, the underlying principle is the investigation of phenomena (Sanskrit: [[Dharma#In Buddhist phenomenology|dharmas]]) as they manifest in the five aggregates ([[Skandha]]) namely, matter or form ([[Rupa (Buddhism)|Rupa]]), sensation or feelings ([[Vedana]]), perception ([[Samjna]]), mental formations ([[Sankhara|Sankara]]) &amp; consciousness ([[Vijnana]]).  This process leads to direct experiential perception, Vipassanā.

==W==
* '''[[Wabi-sabi]]:''' (in [[Kanji]]: 侘寂) Represents a comprehensive [[Japan]]ese world view or [[aesthetic]].  It is difficult to explain wabi-sabi in [[Western culture|Western]] terms, but the aesthetic is sometimes described as one of beauty that is imperfect, [[impermanent]], or incomplete. A concept derived from the [[Buddhist]] assertion of the first noble truth—[[Dukkha]].
* '''[[Worship]]:''' Usually refers to specific acts of [[religion|religious]] praise, honour, or [[wikt:devotion|devotion]], typically directed to a [[supernatural]] being such as a [[god]] or [[goddess]].  It is the informal term in English for what [[sociology of religion|sociologists of religion]] call ''[[cult (religion)|cultus]]'', the body of practices and traditions that correspond to [[theology]]. Religious worship may be performed individually, in informally organized groups, or as part of an organized service with a designated leader (as in a [[Christian Church|church]], [[synagogue]], [[temple]], or [[mosque]]).  In its older sense in the [[English language]] of ''worthiness'' or ''respect'', ''worship'' may sometimes refer to actions directed at members of higher social classes (such as [[lord]]s or [[monarch]]s) or to particularly esteemed persons (such as a lover). Typical acts of worship include: [[prayer]]; [[sacrifice]] (''[[korban]]'' in Hebrew); [[ritual]]s; [[meditation]]; [[holiday]]s, [[festival]]s; [[pilgrimage]]s; [[hymn]]s or [[psalm]]s; the construction of [[temple]]s or [[shrine]]s; the creation of [[idolatry|idols]] of the deity.

==Y==
* '''[[Yana (Buddhism)]]:''' A [[Sanskrit]] word with a range of meanings including nouns such as vehicle, journey, and path; and verbs such as going, moving, riding, and marching. In the Indian religions Buddhism and Hinduism, both ''yana'' and ''[[marga (disambiguation)|marga]]'' (road or path) express the metaphor of spiritual practice as a path or journey. Ancient texts in both religions discuss doctrines and practices associated with various ''yanas''. In Buddhism, ''yana'' often augments the metaphor of the spiritual path with the idea of various vehicles that convey a person along that path. The ''yana/marga'' metaphor is similar to the Chinese image of the [[Tao]] (path or way) but Indian and Chinese cultures appear to have evolved such similar metaphors independently.
* '''[[Yin and yang]]:''' The concept of yin and yang ({{lang-ko|음양}}; [[Revised Romanization of Korean|Revised]]: eumyang; [[McCune–Reischauer]]: ŭmyang; {{zh|t=陰陽|s=阴阳|p=yīnyáng}}; {{lang-vi|Âm-Dương}}) originates in ancient [[Chinese philosophy]] and [[metaphysics]], which describes two primal opposing but complementary forces found in all things in the universe.  Yin, the darker element, is passive, dark, feminine, downward-seeking, and corresponds to the night; yang, the brighter element, is active, light, masculine, upward-seeking and corresponds to the day.
* '''[[Yoga]]:''' (Sanskrit योग, "union") A family of [[spiritual practice]]s that originated in India, where it is seen primarily as a means to [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] (or [[bodhi]]). Traditionally, [[Karma yoga]], [[Bhakti yoga]], [[Jnana yoga]], and [[Rāja yoga]] are considered the four main yogas. In the [[western world|West]], yoga has become associated with the [[asana]]s (postures) of [[Hatha yoga]], which are popular as fitness exercises. Yoga as a means to [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] is central to [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]].

==Z==

* '''[[Zazen]]:''' In [[Zen]] [[Buddhism]], sitting meditation or zazen ({{lang-ja|座禅}}; literally "seated concentration") is a [[meditation|meditative]] discipline practitioners perform to [[samatha|calm]] the body and the mind and experience [[vipassana|insight]] into the nature of existence.  While the term originally referred to a sitting practice, it is now commonly used to refer to practices in any posture, such as walking.

During [[sleep]] or awake rest, replay refers to the re-occurrence of a sequence of cell activations that also occurred during activity, but the replay has a much faster time scale. It may be in the same order, or in reverse. Cases were also found where a sequence of activations occurs before the actual activity, but it is still the same sequence. This is called '''preplay'''.

The phenomenon has mostly been observed in the [[hippocampus]], a brain region associated with [[Memory management|memory]] and [[spatial navigation (neuroscience)|spatial navigation]]. Specifically, the cells that exhibit this behavior are [[place cell]]s, characterized by reliably increasing their activity when the animal is in a certain location in space. During navigation, the place cells fire in a sequence according to the path of the animal. In a replay instance, the cells are activated as if in response to the same spatial path, but at a much faster rate than the animal actually moved in.

== Background ==
[[Place cell]] activity was already well established when the first study explored this phenomenon in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pavlides C, Winson J | title = Influences of hippocampal place cell firing in the awake state on the activity of these cells during subsequent sleep episodes | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 9 | issue = 8 | pages = 2907–18 | date = August 1989 | pmid = 2769370 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They showed that neural activity of single place cells during [[sleep]] resembled the activity during the awake state. This activity was greater than that of other cells and this study was only the first step towards understanding replay. Subsequent studies showed that large groups of cells also demonstrated this type of increased activity during sleep. In addition, it was discovered that the order of activity of place cells was also replicated during sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Skaggs WE, McNaughton BL | title = Replay of neuronal firing sequences in rat hippocampus during sleep following spatial experience | journal = Science | volume = 271 | issue = 5257 | pages = 1870–3 | date = March 1996 | pmid = 8596957 | doi = 10.1126/science.271.5257.1870 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Firing sequences of three and more neurons observed in the hippocampus during locomotion were shown to recur selectively during subsequent slow-wave sleep more likely than during the preceding sleep, and the sequence replay was compressed during high frequency oscillations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nádasdy Z, Hirase H, Czurkó A, Csicsvari J, Buzsáki G | title = Replay and time compression of recurring spike sequences in the hippocampus | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 19 | issue = 21 | pages = 9497–507 | date = November 1999 | pmid = 10531452 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These high frequency field oscillations called '''ripples''' were observed in the sleep state and later shown to play a causal role in [[memory consolidation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eschenko O, Ramadan W, Mölle M, Born J, Sara SJ | title = Sustained increase in hippocampal sharp-wave ripple activity during slow-wave sleep after learning | journal = Learning &amp; Memory | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 222–8 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18385477 | pmc = 2327264 | doi = 10.1101/lm.726008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Girardeau G, Benchenane K, Wiener SI, Buzsáki G, Zugaro MB | title = Selective suppression of hippocampal ripples impairs spatial memory | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 12 | issue = 10 | pages = 1222–3 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19749750 | doi = 10.1038/nn.2384 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next step was the discovery of replay during the awake state. In 1999, ten years after the initial discovery, neural recordings in the awake state were also shown to have replay activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kudrimoti HS, Barnes CA, McNaughton BL | title = Reactivation of hippocampal cell assemblies: effects of behavioral state, experience, and EEG dynamics | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 19 | issue = 10 | pages = 4090–101 | date = May 1999 | pmid = 10234037 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considerably more difficult to detect this activity in the awake state and several methods including [[neural decoding|Bayesian decoding]] have been used to quantify replay events that occur during short wave ripples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Davidson TJ, Kloosterman F, Wilson MA | title = Hippocampal replay of extended experience | journal = Neuron | volume = 63 | issue = 4 | pages = 497–507 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19709631 | pmc = 4364032 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2009.07.027 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent advances include finding that replay can occur in reverse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Karlsson MP, Frank LM | title = Awake replay of remote experiences in the hippocampus | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 12 | issue = 7 | pages = 913–8 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19525943 | pmc = 2750914 | doi = 10.1038/nn.2344 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it has also been found to occur in different environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carr MF, Jadhav SP, Frank LM | title = Hippocampal replay in the awake state: a potential substrate for memory consolidation and retrieval | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 147–53 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21270783 | pmc = 3215304 | doi = 10.1038/nn.2732 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of replay in memory consolidation in these different conditions and environments is still being explored and several theories attempt to answer this question.

== Location and behavioral state ==
Replay can occur in several different behavioral, physiological, and environmental conditions. The first distinction between awake and sleep states may represent different roles in memory consolidation. In the sleep state, the ripple events and place cell activity similar to that of the activity in the environment define the replay events. In the sleep state, there is also a distinction between [[REM sleep|REM]] (rapid eye movement) and [[Slow-wave sleep|SWS]] (slow wave sleep) which has implications for replay events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Louie K, Wilson MA | title = Temporally structured replay of awake hippocampal ensemble activity during rapid eye movement sleep | journal = Neuron | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 145–56 | date = January 2001 | pmid = 11182087 | doi = 10.1016/S0896-6273(01)00186-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee AK, Wilson MA | title = Memory of sequential experience in the hippocampus during slow wave sleep | journal = Neuron | volume = 36 | issue = 6 | pages = 1183–94 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12495631 | doi = 10.1016/s0896-6273(02)01096-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During SWS the place cells fire in a sequential order indicating replay and possibly indicate memory consolidation. However, during REM sleep where [[dream]]s occur in humans, replay events also occurred suggesting a possible role for place cells in dreams.

In the awake state the same activity occurs, however it is more difficult to detect and the animal must be in a resting state. Lastly, there are many environments for replay events in the awake animal. The length of the track can be short or long and still be replayed by a population of place cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Davidson TJ, Kloosterman F, Wilson MA | title = Hippocampal replay of extended experience | journal = Neuron | volume = 63 | issue = 4 | pages = 497–507 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19709631 | pmc = 4364032 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2009.07.027 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, replay of a single environment can occur when the animal is in that environment or in different environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Diba K, Buzsáki G | title = Forward and reverse hippocampal place-cell sequences during ripples | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 10 | issue = 10 | pages = 1241–2 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17828259 | pmc = 2039924 | doi = 10.1038/nn1961 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Karlsson MP, Frank LM | title = Awake replay of remote experiences in the hippocampus | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 12 | issue = 7 | pages = 913–8 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19525943 | pmc = 2750914 | doi = 10.1038/nn.2344 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may show that consolidation of memory is a persistent process that may occur in several different types of environments and behavioral conditions. The robustness of the replay events indicates the importance of this process.

== Preplay ==
As mentioned above, the sequential activation of hippocampal place cells according to their place fields may occur during rest periods before the animal is actually traversing the activated path, even if the animal has never experienced it before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dragoi G, Tonegawa S | title = Preplay of future place cell sequences by hippocampal cellular assemblies | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7330 | pages = 397–401 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21179088 | pmc = 3104398 | doi = 10.1038/nature09633 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that hippocampal activation during rest may have a function not only in memory consolidation and retrieval, but also in [[planning]]: it contributes to the organization of the [[Biological neural network|network]] for improving the [[Neural encoding|encoding]] of future events.

== Sensory cue for activation ==
[[Stimulus (physiology)|Sensory stimuli]] can induce replay events or enhance the replay:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carr MF, Jadhav SP, Frank LM | title = Hippocampal replay in the awake state: a potential substrate for memory consolidation and retrieval | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 147–53 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21270783 | pmc = 3215304 | doi = 10.1038/nn.2732 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the awake state, replay often begins from the current location and continue either forward or backward in time, and nearby locations are more likely to be the [[place field]]s of neurons exhibiting replay than far away locations. This is like [[Cued recall|cued memory retrieval]], where a sensory input triggers retrieval of similar or relevant memories. The cue may even trigger a replay in a different environment, if the place cells cued represent a location in a different environment in addition to the current location of the animal.

== Interaction with cortex ==
Several studies are beginning to understand that replay may not only occur in the [[hippocampus]]. After learning, similar replay events occurred in both the [[thalamus]] and [[neocortex|cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ribeiro S, Gervasoni D, Soares ES, Zhou Y, Lin SC, Pantoja J, Lavine M, Nicolelis MA | title = Long-lasting novelty-induced neuronal reverberation during slow-wave sleep in multiple forebrain areas | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = E24 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14737198 | pmc = 314474 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0020024 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[visual cortex]] showed population activity that was both coordinated into discrete time regions and that it occurred simultaneously with activity in the hippocampus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ji D, Wilson MA | title = Coordinated memory replay in the visual cortex and hippocampus during sleep | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 100–7 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17173043 | doi = 10.1038/nn1825 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrent re-activation in the hippocampus and cortex may demonstrate that memory consolidation requires cortical input/output to maintain a memory. This hypothesis fits well with the idea that the cortex plays an integral role in memory retrieval after consolidation occurs. Therefore, hippocampal replay may play the role of information transfer between the hippocampus and cortex, yet this idea requires further verification.

== Function in memory ==
Hippocampal replay in the awake state has been shown &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carr MF, Jadhav SP, Frank LM | title = Hippocampal replay in the awake state: a potential substrate for memory consolidation and retrieval | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 147–53 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21270783 | pmc = 3215304 | doi = 10.1038/nn.2732 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to correlate with performance in [[spatial navigation|navigation]] tasks after the replay event. This suggest that replay plays a role in consolidation of memories related to spatial location,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Derdikman D, Moser MB | title = A dual role for hippocampal replay | journal = Neuron | volume = 65 | issue = 5 | pages = 582–4 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20223195 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2010.02.022 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although a clear causal relationship between replay and memory consolidation is still unproven. Furthermore, replay also seems to be related to [[memory retrieval]]: it is activated by cues that also trigger memory retrieval, and in situations that require it, such as [[planning]] a trajectory based on the consequences of past choices. This relationship is also still only correlative, but there are studies showing evidence for the necessity of replay in successful memory retrieval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dupret D, O'Neill J, Pleydell-Bouverie B, Csicsvari J | title = The reorganization and reactivation of hippocampal maps predict spatial memory performance | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 13 | issue = 8 | pages = 995–1002 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20639874 | pmc = 2923061 | doi = 10.1038/nn.2599 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Replay is likely to participate in both the consolidation of memories and in building a [[cognitive map]].

In studies done to monitor the patterns of the hippocampal replay of events happening in the minds of the rats, it was discovered that they rely heavily on long term re-playable memories for their daily lives. To determine if the animals could really retain the memories scientists set up a series of episodic events (i.e. a series of tunnels, a maze, a track full of twists and turns) to visualize the neuron activity as the rat completes its round around the new surroundings. The chemogenetic activating drug clozapine N-oxide (CNO), but not vehicle, reversibly impairs episodic memory replay in rats previously injected bilaterally in the hippocampus with a recombinant viral vector containing an inhibitory designer receptor exclusively activated by a designer drug (DREADD; AAV8-hSyn-hM4Di-mCherry). By contrast, two non-episodic memory assessments are unaffected by CNO, showing selectivity of this hippocampal-dependent impairment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Panoz-Brown D, Iyer V, Carey LM, Sluka CM, Rajic G, Kestenman J, Gentry M, Brotheridge S, Somekh I, Corbin HE, Tucker KG, Almeida B, Hex SB, Garcia KD, Hohmann AG, Crystal JD | title = Replay of Episodic Memories in the Rat | journal = Current Biology | volume = 28 | issue = 10 | pages = 1628–1634.e7 | date = May 2018 | pmid = 29754898 | pmc = 5964044 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2018.04.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Héctor Luís Camacho Matías''' (May 24, 1962 – November 24, 2012), commonly known by his nickname "'''Macho'''" '''Camacho''', was a Puerto Rican [[professional boxer]] and entertainer. Known for his quickness in the ring and flamboyant style,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last=Santiago | first=Luis | date=November 20, 2012 | url=http://www.elnuevodia.com/trayectoriadelmachocamacho-1390119.html | title=Trayectoria del 'Macho' Camacho |trans-title=Biography of 'Macho' Camacho | newspaper=[[El Nuevo Día]] | language=Spanish | accessdate=November 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camacho competed professionally from 1980 to 2010, and was a [[triple champion|three-weight world champion]]. He held the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] [[super featherweight]] title from 1983 to 1984, the WBC [[lightweight]] title from 1985 to 1987, and the [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] [[junior welterweight]] title twice between 1989 and 1992.

In a storied [[amateur boxing|amateur]] career, Camacho won three [[New York Golden Gloves]] tournaments, beginning with the Sub-Novice 112&amp;nbsp;lbs championship in 1978.&lt;ref name=NYDN&gt;{{Cite news | last=Farrell | first=Bill | date=November 15, 2011 | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more-sports/golden-gloves/1977-1986-article-1.977906#ixzz2D0UmDR3y | title=1977–1986: A New Generation of Champions | newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] | accessdate=November 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his professional career, Camacho had many notable fights against some of the biggest names in boxing, defeating [[Roberto Durán]] twice late in Duran's career, and knocking out [[Sugar Ray Leonard]] to send him into permanent retirement. He also fought [[Julio César Chávez]], [[Félix Trinidad]], and [[Oscar De La Hoya]], among others.

During his later years, Camacho expanded his popular role and appeared on a variety of Spanish-language [[reality television]] shows including [[Univision|Univision's']] dancing show ''[[Mira Quien Baila]]'' and a weekly segment on the popular show ''[[El Gordo y La Flaca]]'', named "Macho News". However, he also had much-publicized troubles with drug abuse and criminal charges. In 2005, Camacho was arrested for burglary, a charge to which he would later plead guilty. In 2011 he was shot at three times by would-be carjackers in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], but was uninjured. In late 2012, Camacho was awaiting trial in Florida on charges of physical abuse of one of his sons.

On November 20, 2012, Camacho was shot and seriously wounded while sitting in a car outside a bar in his native [[Bayamón, Puerto Rico|Bayamón]]; the driver, a childhood friend, was killed in the shooting. Camacho died four days later; after he was declared clinically brain dead, his mother requested the doctors remove him from life support.&lt;ref name="bigstory.ap.org"&gt;{{cite news|title=CAMACHO'S MOTHER SAYS LIFE SUPPORT WILL END |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/somber-vigil-macho-camacho-puerto-rico |work=Associated Press |accessdate=November 24, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128051254/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/somber-vigil-macho-camacho-puerto-rico |archivedate=November 28, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS News"&gt;{{cite web|title=Camacho's mother says life support will end|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-400_162-57553831/camachos-mother-says-life-support-will-end/|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=November 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After lying in state for two days in [[Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico|Santurce]], Camacho's remains were transported to [[New York (state)|New York]] for burial at request of his mother.

==Early life and amateur career==
Camacho was born in [[Bayamón, Puerto Rico|Bayamón]], [[Puerto Rico]], to Héctor Luis Camacho Sr. and his wife María Matías. He was the youngest of five children, which included a brother Felix and sisters Raquel, Estrella, and Esperanza.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; When he was three, his parents separated, and his mother took the children with her to New York City.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; They lived in the [[James Weldon Johnson]] [[housing project]] in [[Spanish Harlem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eldiariony.com/pesar-nueva-york-muerte-macho-camacho|title=Pesar en NY por la muerte del "Macho" Camacho|work=El Diario|author=Acosta, José|language=Spanish|date=November 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camacho attended local schools and ran into trouble as a teen, getting into street fights and landing in jail at fifteen. Pat Flannery, a language teacher in high school, helped the youth, teaching him to read and "acting like a father figure".&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; When Camacho learned boxing and [[karate]] as a teenager, Flannery guided him to the [[Golden Gloves]] competitions.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; Demonstrating talent as a boxer, Camacho chose that sport as a career.

As an amateur, Camacho won three New York [[Golden Gloves Championship]]s. Camacho won the 1978 112&amp;nbsp;lb Sub-Novice Championship, 1979 118&amp;nbsp;lb Open Championship, and 1980 119&amp;nbsp;lb Open Championship. In 1979 Camacho defeated Paul DeVorce of the [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]] [[Police Athletic League]] in the finals to win the title, and, in 1980, Camacho defeated Tyrone Jackson in the finals to win the Championship. &lt;!--unable to verify this, please add reference that is not a wikipedia mirror: Camacho trained at the LaSombra Sporting Club in New York.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} --&gt;

Camacho's nickname of "Macho" has been explained in various ways. According to his father, he gave him the nickname because he was his youngest son.&lt;ref name="primera" /&gt; According to the ''[[New York Times]]'', his mentor Pat Flannery is the one who gave him the nickname during his teens.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; According to Camacho himself, the nickname came as a result of American co-workers at a factory who couldn't pronounce his last name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=De dónde salió lo del Macho|author=Colón, David |newspaper=''INdice'' |date=November 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==
After a stellar amateur career, Camacho began a quick rise through the professional rankings, first in the featherweight and then in the junior-lightweight division. He was so confident that he claimed he could beat world featherweight champions [[Salvador Sánchez]] and [[Eusebio Pedroza]]. However, Sánchez died while Camacho was still coming up in the ranks. In the junior-lightweight division, he defeated the top contenders Irleis ''Cubanito'' Perez, Melvin Paul, John Montes, and Refugio Rojas.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

When the World Junior Lightweight champion, [[Bobby Chacón]], refused to go to Puerto Rico to defend his title against Camacho, the [[World Boxing Council]] (WBC) declared the world championship vacant. [[Rafael Limón]], who had been defeated and lost the championship to Chacon, fought him for the vacant title. It was the first time Camacho was in a ring with a former world champion; he scored knockdowns on Limón in the first and third rounds before the referee stopped the fight in the fifth round.

Camacho also fought his first defense in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], where he met [[Rafael Solis (boxer)|Rafael Solis]], a fellow [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]]. Camacho got tested in this fight for the first time, and was shaken in round three by a Solis uppercut. He knocked out Solis with a right to the chin in round five, and retained the title.

===Lightweight===
Moving up to lightweight, Camacho won the [[United States Boxing Association]] title against Roque Montoya with a twelve-round decision. His victory in the next fight, broadcast on [[Home Box Office]] (HBO), made him a two-time world champion. Camacho beat the [[Mexican people|Mexican]] defending world champion, [[José Luis Ramírez]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] to win the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] world Lightweight championship. Camacho dropped Ramirez in round three and won the fight by a unanimous twelve-round decision.

The two other reigning world champions in his division at that time, [[Livingstone Bramble]] and [[Jimmy Paul]], were reluctant to unify the crown with Camacho. Instead, he beat [[Freddie Roach (boxing)|Freddie Roach]] before his next fight of importance came along, ten months after beating Ramírez.

He met [[Edwin Rosario]] on June 13, 1986, at [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]], a bout also broadcast on HBO. The fight was notable for the shifts of dominance between the men. Camacho dominated rounds one to four, but had to hang on in rounds five, six and seven, when he felt Rosario's power. He came back to take rounds eight and nine, but Rosario came back to take the last three rounds. It was a close fight, but Camacho retained the title by a split decision of the judges.

Camacho retained his title against [[Cornelius Boza Edwards]], a former world junior lightweight champion, in [[Miami]] in a unanimous decision, after dropping Edwards in the first round.

===Light welterweight===
He went up in weight and competed at the next level. After a few fights there, he met [[Ray Mancini|Ray "Boom Boom" Mancini]], the former world lightweight champion who had a record of 29–3 with 23 knockouts, for the vacant [[WBO]] Light Welterweight title. Camacho was the fresher of the two and won a split twelve-round decision. He joined that exclusive group of world champion boxers who have become world champions in three weight divisions.

Camacho next met [[Vinny Pazienza]], whom he defeated on points. His next challenger was [[Tony Baltazar]], from [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. He defeated Baltazar by points in a fight televised by HBO. His undefeated streak came to an end, and he lost his world championship to [[Greg Haugen]], the former world Lightweight champion. The referee had deducted one point from Camacho for refusing to touch gloves with Haugen at the start of the 12th round. After the fight, an unidentified substance was found in Haugen's urine, and a rematch was ordered. Camacho regained the title, beating Haugen in a close split decision.

In 1992 in Las Vegas, Camacho met [[Julio César Chávez]], a formidable Mexican champion who was undefeated 81–0. Camacho entered the ring in an outfit based on the Puerto Rican flag; the fight was televised by [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]]'s [[Pay Per View]]. Camacho was later criticized {{By whom|date=March 2013}} for his retreating tactics during the fight; Chávez kept pushing the fight and harassed him with hard punches to the body. The bout ended with a victory for Chávez by unanimous decision.

Since 1992 Camacho's notable fights included two victories (by points) over [[Roberto Durán]], (one in [[Atlantic City]], the other in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]]). In 1997, he knocked out [[Sugar Ray Leonard]] in five rounds. This loss sent the forty-one-year-old Leonard into permanent retirement, putting an end to his third comeback attempt six years after a loss to [[Terry Norris]] in 1991.

===Welterweight and later career===
Camacho fought for the [[NWA World Welterweight Championship|World Welterweight Championship]] against [[Félix Trinidad]] (1994) and [[Oscar De La Hoya]] (1997), but he lost both matches by unanimous decisions.

On December 5, 2003, Camacho recovered from a first-round knockdown (the third against him in his career) to defeat Craig Houk by knockout in round three. He won consecutive unanimous ten-round decisions over Clinton McNeil and [[Raúl Jorge Muñoz]]. After that, his boxing career went on hiatus, as he faced criminal charges. He pled guilty to burglary and acknowledged drug abuse, but was given probation.

Camacho returned to boxing on July 18, 2008, competing against Perry Ballard for the World Boxing Empire's Middleweight Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fightnews.com/fightnews_2/headlines/EkEyuVpVZlDmebmyyi.html|title=Camacho stops Ballard| publisher=Fightnews.com|date=July 19, 2008|accessdate=August 2, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080730221324/http://www.fightnews.com/fightnews_2/headlines/EkEyuVpVZlDmebmyyi.html|archivedate=July 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fight lasted seven rounds. Camacho won when Ballard's corner threw the towel. Before this fight, Camacho was trained by [[Angelo Dundee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefightnetwork.com/print/767/camacho_stops_ballard_in_seven|title=Camacho Stops Ballard in Seven|publisher=[[The Fight Network]]|date=July 20, 2008|accessdate=August 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His last two fights resulted in a draw and a loss, against [[Yori Boy Campas|Luis Ramón Campas]] and Saúl Duran, respectively. His last fight against Duran was on May 14, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=607&amp;cat=boxer|title=Hector Camacho Boxing Record|work=BoxRec|accessdate=November 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years and troubles==
===2005 burglary===
On January 6, 2005, Camacho was arrested by police in [[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]], [[Mississippi]] on charges of trying to burgle an electronic goods store and carrying the drug [[ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]] on him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.caracol.com.co/noticias/actualidad/arrestado-por-robo-el-macho-camacho/20050107/nota/138032.aspx |title=Arrestado por robo el Macho Camacho |work=Caracol Radio |author= |language=Spanish |date=January 7, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107141714/http://www.caracol.com.co/noticias/actualidad/arrestado-por-robo-el-macho-camacho/20050107/nota/138032.aspx |archivedate=January 7, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, he declared himself guilty of being [[Substance intoxication|under the influence]] at the time of the burglary. He was sentenced to 7 years in prison, but a judge eventually suspended all but one year of the sentence and gave Camacho [[probation]]. He served two weeks in jail after violating that probation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.elnuevodia.com/problemasdemachocamachoconlaley-1390124.html|title=Problemas de Macho Camacho con la ley|work=[[El Nuevo Día]]|author=Pillot, Víctor|language=Spanish|date=November 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011 shooting===
On February 12, 2011, Camacho was attacked near the Luis Lloréns Torres housing project in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]]. Camacho said he was taking a friend to a nearby bar when two men approached his vehicle (a 2005 [[BMW X5]]) and tried to [[carjack]] him. When he tried to drive away, they shot at him three times.  He said that since "everybody loves me," he didn't think the men had realized who he was. He did not file a police report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.elnuevodia.com/tiroteadomachocamachoenel2011-1390645.html|title=Tiroteado Macho Camacho en el 2011|work=[[El Nuevo Día]]|author=Maldonado, Sugaily|language=Spanish|date=November 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Child abuse charges===
In November 2011, the Florida state attorney's office signed a warrant for Camacho's arrest for child abuse. He was accused of having physically attacked and injured his teenage son at his home with Camacho's ex-wife in March 2011.&lt;ref name="Tolomeo"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tolomeo|first=Natalie|title=Boxer 'Macho' Camacho to face child abuse charges today|url=http://www.cfnews13.com/content/news/cfnews13/news/article.html/content/news/articles/cfn/2012/9/4/boxer_macho_camacho_.html?cid=rss|publisher=Central Florida News 13|accessdate=September 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camacho turned himself in to Florida authorities in April 2012. After posting a $5,000 bond at the Orange County Jail in Orlando, he was released. A trial was pending for Camacho in [[Orange County, Florida]], at the time of his death.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==2012 shooting and death==
On November 20, 2012, around 7 p.m. [[Atlantic Standard Time|AST]], Camacho was shot once in the jaw in [[Bayamón, Puerto Rico|Bayamón]], [[Puerto Rico]]. Camacho, 50, was seated in the passenger seat of a friend's [[Ford Mustang]] when he was shot by unknown individuals from a passing SUV. The driver of the car, Adrian Mojica Moreno,&lt;ref name=CBS/&gt; a childhood friend of Camacho, was killed in the attack. Camacho was taken to San Pablo Hospital in [[Bayamón, Puerto Rico|Bayamón]], where he was reported to be in critical condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primerahora.com/gravehectorelmachocamachotrassertiroteadoenbayamon-725211.html|title=Grave Héctor "El Macho" Camacho tras ser tiroteado en Bayamón|author=Javier Colón Dávila and Michelle Estrada Torres|publisher=''[[Primera Hora (Puerto Rico)|Primera Hora]]''|language=Spanish|date=November 20, 2012|accessdate=November 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police said a chase took place and that the van from which the shots were fired was found in the area of [[Public housing in Puerto Rico|Jardines de Cataño]].

===Funeral and burial===
After Camacho's death, his mother, María Matías, expressed the wish for her son to be buried in [[New York City]], where he had grown up and started his fighting career.

==Legacy and honors==
Several sports journalists, analysts, and experts from Puerto Rico and United States have praised Camacho's skills and influence in the boxing world. The journalist [[Rafael Bracero]] and Francisco Valcárcel, president of the [[World Boxing Organization]], agreed that Camacho was among the "Top 5 Puerto Rican boxers" of all time, along with [[Félix Trinidad|Félix "Tito" Trinidad]], [[Wilfredo Gómez]], and [[Wilfredo Benitez]]. The boxing historian, Mario Rivera Martinó, praised Camacho, calling him a "complete fighter" in the Lightweight division. [[José Sulaimán]] stated that he "revolutionized boxing during his time".{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Ed Brophy, director of the [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]], noted Camacho's talents in attracting an audience. He said, "Camacho brought a lot of excitement to boxing. He was bright, colorful, and always gave something to talk about with his walks to the ring, with his unique style of entering, and the costumes he wore." Brophy also praised Camacho's boxing skills, describing him as "an exciting fighter, and one of the greats. He faced the best, going up and down several divisions."&lt;ref name="Sanchez"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.elnuevodia.com/entreleyendasmachocamacho-1393099.html|title=Entre leyendas Macho Camacho|work=[[El Nuevo Día]]|author=Sánchez, José A.|date=November 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alfredo R. Martínez, senior editor of [[ESPN Deportes]], also noted Camacho's flamboyant approach, saying that "if he wasn't the first, he was one of the firsts that entered the ring with extravagant costumes, feather crests, bright clothes, everything to the rhythm of some pop song".&lt;ref name="Sanchez"/&gt;

Hiram Martínez, senior editor of ESPN Deportes, said about Camacho's training: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;he transforms into a hungry, focused, and dedicated boxer, that works hours and hours polishing his speed, his wit, and the style that turned him into one of the greats of all time. That's the only way you can explain why all those great hitters he faced during the best moments of his career never knocked him down.&lt;ref name="recuerdos"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Jaime Vega-Curry (deputy editor of ESPN Deportes), said Camacho was "a character that combined a contagious charisma, impressive boxing quality, a child's soul, a salesman's shrewdness, and a superlative confidence on himself and in the force of his 'Macho Time'"&lt;ref name="recuerdos"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espndeportes.espn.go.com/news/story?id=1664745&amp;s=box&amp;type=story|title=Recuerdos sobre 'Macho' Camacho|work=[[ESPN Deportes]]|author=|date=November 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brophy noted Camacho would be eligible for the [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]] in December 2015. He added that "Camacho is part of boxing history, and that's what the International Boxing Hall of Fame is about."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.elnuevodia.com/conunsitialenelsalondelafama-1393773.html|title=Con un sitial en el Salón de la Fama|work=[[El Nuevo Día]]|author=Sánchez, José A.|date=November 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Camacho invited Cedeño to sing a version with him of ''[[La Borinqueña]]'' before a fight, together with Pedro Guzmán, a fellow comedian/musician.

A little flash… Like Héctor "Macho" Camacho". after placing tassels in the boxing outfit of [[Luanne Platter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livedash.com/transcript/king_of_the_hill-(boxing_luanne)/4590/TOONP/Friday_October_15_2010/477650/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130128214516/http://www.livedash.com/transcript/king_of_the_hill-(boxing_luanne)/4590/TOONP/Friday_October_15_2010/477650/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 28, 2013 |title=King of the Hill – Boxing Luanne: Transcript |publisher=LiveDash.com |accessdate=November 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapper [[Lil Wayne]] referred to Camacho and the professional wrestler "Macho Man" ([[Randy Savage]]) in his 2008 single, "[[Mr. Carter]]".

Following retirement, Camacho expanded his role as a television personality. In 2010, he took part in ''¡[[Mira Quien Baila (U.S.)|Mira Quien Baila]]!'', a [[reality show]] that is the American/Spanish-Speaking version of ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://entretenimiento.univision.com/mira-quien-baila Mira Quien Baila!]&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first to be eliminated from the competition. Camacho later joined the Univision entertainment news program ''[[El Gordo y La Flaca]]'' as a ''Mira Quien Baila'' critic and entertainment world newscaster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zayzay.com/news/hector-macho-camacho-joins-el-gordo-y-la-flaca-show/ Hector ‘Macho’ Camacho Joins ‘El Gordo Y La Flaca’ Show]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2012, Camacho starred on a [[dating game show]] titled ''It's Macho Time,'' where women competed to be his "girlfriend".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.primerahora.com/nota-619056|title=Héctor "Macho" Camacho busca novia en programa a transmitirse por canal de YouTube|work=''[[Primera Hora (Puerto Rico)|Primera Hora]]''|author=|language=Spanish|date=February 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11562">The '''Larnoch Road murders''' were a high-profile [[double murder|double-murder]] case in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]].  In 1999, Stephen Stone and Gail Maney were convicted of the 1989 murder of Deane Fuller-Sandys over a drug-related dispute. Stone was also convicted of the rape and murder of Leah Stephens, a witness to the killing of Fuller-Sandys. Two other men were also convicted of being accessories to the murder of Fuller-Sandys by disposing of his body.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=Tony |title=A Case of Murder: Bizarre and Unsolved Murders in New Zealand |date=2000 |publisher=Hodder Moa Beckett |location=Auckland, N.Z. |isbn=9781869588083}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="H Files"&gt;{{cite news |title=The H Files: Burglary in Henderson, West Auckland that triggered a 'sordid and murderous' plan |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12076882 |work=New Zealand Herald |date=24 June 2018 |language=en-NZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case is unusual in New Zealand legal history because of the decade-long gap between the crime and the conviction, the securing of a conviction despite a lack of [[forensic evidence]], and the [[Witness immunity|legal
 immunity]] granted to key witnesses.&lt;ref name="Curious"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Maas |first1=Amy |last2=Dudding |first2=Adam |title=Gone Fishing: the curious case of homicide cop Mark Franklin |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/104942560/gone-fishing-the-curious-case-of-homicide-cop-mark-franklin |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=29 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stickley 1999" /&gt;

==Disappearance of victims==

On 21 August 1989, Deane Wade Fuller-Sandys, a 21-year-old Auckland [[tire|tyre]]-fitter, went missing. His body was never found. Authorities initially believed he might have drowned after being swept out to sea while fishing at West Auckland's [[Whatipu|Whatipu Beach]], where his car was discovered shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name=Larkin&gt;{{cite news |last1=Larkin |first1=Naomi |title=Quest for justice on windswept beach |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=3369 |work=[[New Zealand Herald]] |date=30 June 2000 |language=en-NZ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five days later, on 26 August 1989, Leah Romany Stephens, a 20-year old Auckland [[sex worker]], also disappeared. Her skeletal remains were discovered in a forest near the [[Muriwai]] Golf Course three years later, in June 1992. Police enquiries at the time did not lead to an arrest.&lt;ref name="H Files" /&gt;

==Police investigation==

In early 1997, Auckland police began to receive information that the  disappearances of Deane Fuller-Sandys and Leah Stephens (by then a [[cold case]])&lt;ref name="Wall 220913" /&gt; were connected. Gail Denise Maney (born {{circa}} 1967), a sex worker, and her friend Stephen Ralph Stone (born 1969), a nightclub [[Bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]] with [[gang]] affiliations, were arrested and charged with having murdered Fuller-Sandys at Maney's then-home in Larnoch Road in the West Auckland suburb of [[Henderson, New Zealand|Henderson]]. Stone was also charged with raping and murdering Stephens at the same house. Gail Maney's younger brother, Colin Neil Maney (born {{circa}} 1971), and a mutual acquaintance, Mark William Henriksen (born {{circa}} 1967),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Witness paid to lie, claims co-accused |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=138234 |work=[[New Zealand Herald]] |date=30 June 2000 |language=en-NZ}}&lt;/ref&gt; were charged with being [[Accessory (legal term)|accessories]] to the murder of Fuller-Sandys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Witness recalls victim's final night |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=3330 |work=[[New Zealand Herald]] |date=30 June 2000 |language=en-NZ}}&lt;/ref&gt; All four denied the charges.&lt;ref name=Larkin /&gt;

==Trial==

The trial ran from 1–26 March 1999 at Auckland's High Court. Two male and two female witnesses were granted [[name suppression]] and [[Witness immunity|immunity from prosecution]] in exchange for their trial testimony.&lt;ref name="Stickley 1999"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Stickley |first1=Tony |last2=Wall |first2=Tony |title=The face of a ruthless killer |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/tony-stickley/news/article.cfm?a_id=143&amp;objectid=4348 |work=[[New Zealand Herald]] |date=30 June 2000 |language=en-NZ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court heard that in August 1989, Gail Maney had ordered the killing of Deane Fuller-Sandys because she believed he had stolen drugs from her rented house at 22 Larnoch Road. On 21 August 1989, Fuller-Sandys was lured by one of the female witnesses to the [[Garage (residential)|
garage]] of 22 Larnoch Road, where Stone used a handgun to shoot him in front of at least eight witnesses, among whom was Leah Stephens.&lt;ref name="Hit"&gt;{{cite news |title=Accused ordered 'hit' witness tells court |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=137537 |work=[[New Zealand Herald]] |date=30 June 2000 |language=en-NZ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone passed the gun to each of the four male witnesses, including Colin Maney and Henriksen, and directed them to fire bullets into the body to make them complicit in the murder. The men disposed of Fuller-Sandys' body in [[Woodhill Forest]] (although subsequent police searches failed to discover his remains),&lt;ref 
 name="LovedOnes"&gt;{{cite news |title=Loved ones want return of Uncle Deane's body |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=4350 |work=[[New Zealand Herald]] |date=30 June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and left his vehicle at Whatipu Beach to make it appear he had drowned there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Hit' accused faces retrial |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=136700 |work=[[New Zealand Herald]] |date=30 June 2000 |language=en-NZ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five days later, Stone, believing that Leah Stephens was likely to inform police of the murder of Fuller-Sandys, raped and then murdered her with a knife at 22 Larnoch Road. The two male witnesses with immunity said they had disposed of Stephens' body at Muriwai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Brother's 'words' create drama at murder trial |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=3239 |work=[[New Zealand Herald]] |date=30 June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After two days' deliberation, the jury found Stone and Gail Maney guilty of the murder of Fuller-Sandys.&lt;ref name=LovedOnes /&gt; Colin Maney and Mark Henriksen were convicted of being accessories to the murder of Fuller-Sandys by helping to dispose of his body. Stone was also convicted of the rape and murder of Stephens. He and Gail Maney were both sentenced to [[life imprisonment]]. Stone also received a 10-year [[concurrent sentence]] for the rape of Stephens. Henriksen was sentenced to three years' imprisonment, while Colin Maney (the youngest of the accused) received a two-year [[suspended sentence]].&lt;ref name="H Files" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Killer won't help family find body |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10662806 |work=[[New Zealand Herald]] |date=31 July 2010 |language=en-NZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

Gail Maney and Mark Henriksen appealed their convictions and were granted a retrial on the grounds that the original trial judge had not adequately summed up the case for their defence to the jury.&lt;ref name=Reid&gt;{{cite news |last1=Reid |first1=Neil |title=Stone-cold hitman |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/3979427/Stone-cold-hitman |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=1 August 2010 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, both were again found guilty at their retrial in June 2000.&lt;ref name="Second"&gt;{{cite news |title=Second guilty verdict, life sentence for Maney |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=138951 |work=[[New Zealand Herald]] |date=30 June 2000 |language=en-NZ}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Gail Maney filed another appeal after one of the key female witnesses recanted her original trial testimony implicating Maney, but this appeal was also rejected.&lt;ref name="Stickley 2005"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Stickley |first1=Tony |title=Witness says she lied at murder hit trials |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10112192 |work=[[New Zealand Herald]] |date=22 February 2005 |language=en-NZ}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was [[paroled]] in 2010, but was twice recalled to prison  for breaches of her parole conditions.&lt;ref name="Akoorie"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Akoorie |first1=Natalie |title=Woman who ordered killing of Deane Fuller-Sandys back in jail |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11867492 |work=[[New Zealand Herald]] |date=4 June 2017 |language=en-NZ}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continues to maintain her innocence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Maas |first1=Amy |last2=Dudding |first2=Adam |title=Gone Fishing: Convicted murderer Gail Maney fights for her innocence |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/103925536/gone-fishing-convicted-murderer-gail-maney-fights-for-her-innocence |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=25 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--British naval and MI6 frogman--&gt;
'''Lionel Kenneth Phillip Crabb''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|OBE|GM}} (28 January 1909 – [[Declared death in absentia|presumed dead]] 19 April 1956), known as '''Buster Crabb''',  was a [[Royal Navy]] [[frogman]] and [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] diver who [[Missing person|vanished]] during a reconnaissance mission around a [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet]] cruiser berthed at [[Portsmouth Naval Base|Portsmouth Dockyard]] in 1956.

==Early life==
Lionel Crabb was born in 1909 to Hugh and Beatrice Crabb of Streatham, south-west London. They were a poor family. In his youth he held many jobs but after two years training for a career at sea in the school ship [[HMS Conway (school ship)|HMS ''Conway'']] he joined the [[merchant navy]] and the [[Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]] before the [[Second World War]].

==Second World War==
At the outbreak of the Second World War, Crabb was first an army gunner. Then, in 1941, he joined the [[Royal Navy]]. The next year he was sent to [[Gibraltar]] where he worked in a mine and bomb disposal unit to remove the Italian [[limpet mine]]s that enemy divers had attached to the hulls of Allied ships. Initially, Crabb's job was to disarm mines that British divers removed, but eventually he decided to learn to dive.

He was one of a group of underwater clearance divers who checked for limpet mines in Gibraltar harbour during the period of [[Decima Flottiglia MAS#Chronicle of operations|Italian frogman and manned torpedo attacks]] by the Decima Flottiglia MAS. They dived with oxygen [[rebreather]]s [[Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus]], which until then had not been used much if at all for swimming down from the surface. At first they swam by [[breaststroke]] without [[swimfin]]s.&lt;ref name=knowles&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knowles|first1=Sydney|title=A diver in the dark : Experiences of a pioneer Royal Navy clearance diver|date=2009|publisher=Woodfield Publishing|location=Bognor Regis|isbn=1846830826|pages=21–22|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 December 1942, during one such attack, two of the Italian [[frogmen]], Lieutenant [[Licio Visintini|Visintini]] and Petty Officer Magro died, probably killed by [[depth charge]]s. Their bodies were recovered, and their swimfins and [[Scuba set]]s were taken and from then on used by [[Sydney Knowles]] and Commander Lionel Crabb.

==Awards==
He was awarded the [[George Medal]] for his efforts and was promoted to [[lieutenant commander]]. In 1943 he became Principal Diving Officer for [[Northern Italy]], was assigned to clear mines in the ports of [[Livorno]] and [[Venice]]; he was later created an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] for these services. He was also an investigating diver in the suspicious death of [[General Sikorski]] of the [[Polish Army]], whose [[B-24 Liberator]] aircraft crashed near Gibraltar in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;UKTV History "Infamous Assassinations", episode "General Sikorski" aired 2 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time he had gained the nickname "Buster", named after American actor and swimmer [[Buster Crabbe]]. After the war Crabb was stationed in [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] and led an underwater explosives disposal team that removed mines placed by Jewish divers from the [[Palyam]], the maritime force of the [[Palmach]] elite Jewish fighting force during the years of [[Mandatory Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eldar|first1=Mike|title=Shayetet 13|date=1993|publisher=Sifriat Ma'ariv|location=Tel Aviv|pages=68, 81–83|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1947, he was demobilised from the military.

==Civilian diver==
Crabb moved to a civilian job and used his diving skills to explore the wreck of a [[Spanish galleon]] from the [[Spanish armada|1588 Armada]], off [[Tobermory, Mull|Tobermory]] on the [[Isle of Mull]]. He then located a suitable site for a discharge pipe for the [[Atomic Weapons Research Establishment]] at [[Aldermaston]]. He later returned to work for the Royal Navy. He twice dived to investigate sunken Royal Navy submarines — the [[HMS Truculent (P315)|HMS ''Truculent'']] in January 1950 and [[HMS Affray (P421)|HMS ''Affray'']] in 1951 — to find out whether there were any survivors. Both efforts were fruitless. In 1952 Crabb married Margaret Elaine Player, the daughter of Henry Charles Brackenbury Williamson and the former wife of Ernest Albert Player. The couple separated in 1953 and divorced about two years later.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

In 1955 Crabb took frogman [[Sydney Knowles]] with him to investigate the hull of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] cruiser ''[[Sverdlov class cruiser|Sverdlov]]'' to evaluate its superior manoeuvrability. According to Knowles, they found a circular opening at the ship's bow and inside it a large [[propeller]] that could be directed to give [[Bow thruster|thrust to the bow]]. That same year, March 1955, Crabb was made to retire due to his age, but a year later he was recruited by [[MI6]]. By this point, Crabb's heavy drinking and smoking had taken its toll on his health, and Crabb was not the diver that he had been in World War II.&lt;ref name="Hoole"/&gt;

==Crabb Affair==
===Disappearance===
[[File:AleksandrNevskiy1983a.jpg|thumb|240px| ''Ordzhonikidze'' was a [[Sverdlov class cruiser]] similar to that shown in this photograph (''Alexander Nevsky'').]]
MI6 recruited Crabb in 1956 to investigate the Soviet cruiser ''Ordzhonikidze'' that had taken [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and [[Nikolai Bulganin]] on a diplomatic mission to Britain.&lt;ref name="hastings"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hastings|first1=Stephen|title=Obituary: Nicholas Elliott|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-nicholas-elliott-1370833.html|website=independent.co.uk|publisher=''[[The Independent]]'' (newspaper)|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Peter Wright]] in his book ''[[Spycatcher]]'' (1987), Crabb was sent to investigate ''Ordzhonikidze'''s propeller, a new design that Naval Intelligence wanted to examine. On 19 April 1956, Crabb dived into [[Portsmouth Harbour]] and his MI6 controller never saw him again. Crabb's companion in the Sally Port Hotel took all his belongings and even the page of the hotel register on which they had written their names. Ten days later British newspapers published stories about Crabb's disappearance in an underwater mission.

MI6 tried to cover up this espionage mission. On 29 April, under instructions from Rear Admiral [[John Gilchrist Inglis|John Inglis]], the [[Naval Intelligence Division|Director of Naval Intelligence]],&lt;ref name="Hoole"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoole|first=Rob|title=The Buster Crabb Enigma|url= http://www.mcdoa.org.uk/Buster%20Crabb%20Enigma.htm |publisher=Warship World|accessdate=10 July 2011|date= January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Admiralty announced that Crabb had vanished when he had taken part in trials of secret underwater apparatus in [[Stokes Bay]] on the [[Solent]]. The Soviets answered by releasing a statement stating that the crew of ''Ordzhonikidze'' had seen a frogman near the cruiser on 19 April.

British newspapers speculated that the Soviets had captured Crabb and taken him to the Soviet Union. The [[Prime Minister of Great Britain|British Prime Minister]] [[Anthony Eden]] apparently disapproved of the fact that MI6 had operated without his consent in the UK (the preserve of the Security Service, "MI5"). It is mistakenly claimed that Eden forced director-general [[John Sinclair (British spy)|John Sinclair]] to resign following the incident. In fact, he had determined to replace Sinclair with MI5 director-general [[Dick White]] before the incident.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew, Christopher. "Defend the Realm: The Authorized History of MI5." p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; Eden told MPs it was not in the public interest to disclose the circumstances in which the frogman met his end.&lt;ref name=mirror-20071117&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/topstories/2007/11/17/cold-war-spy-riddle-ends-89520-20119884/|title=Cold war spy riddle ends|author=Nick Webster and Claire Donnelly|date=17 November 2007|publisher=[[Daily Mirror]]|accessdate=17 November 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118224401/http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/topstories/2007/11/17/cold-war-spy-riddle-ends-89520-20119884/|archive-date=18 November 2007|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rawls, John. ''A Theory of Justice''. Harvard University Press, 1971, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Body found===
A little less than 14 months after Crabb's disappearance, on 9 June 1957, a body in a diving suit was brought to the surface in their net by two fishermen off [[Pilsey Island]] in [[Chichester Harbour]].&lt;ref name="mitchell"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mitchell|first1=Peter|last2=Knight|first2=Jim|title=Buster Crabb|url=http://www.submerged.co.uk/buster-crabb.php|website=submerged.co.uk|publisher=Peter Mitchell|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The body was brought to shore in a [[landing craft]]&lt;ref group='note'&gt;A Second World War Assault Landing Craft, ALC148&lt;/ref&gt; operated by members of RAF Marine Craft Unit No. 1107.&lt;ref name="mitchell"/&gt;

It was missing its head and both hands, which made it impossible to [[Forensic pathology|identify]] (using then-available technology).&lt;ref name="Hoole"/&gt; According to British diving expert Rob Hoole, the body had the same height as Crabb, the same body-hair colour, and was dressed in the same clothes, Pirelli two-piece diving suit and Admiralty Pattern swim fins that Crabb was wearing when he embarked on his final mission.&lt;ref name="Hoole"/&gt; Hoole wrote that given the length of time that Crabb's body had been in the water, there was "nothing sinister" about the missing head and hands.&lt;ref name="Hoole"/&gt; Crabb's ex-wife was not sure enough to identify the body, nor was Crabb's girlfriend, Pat Rose. Sydney Knowles was requested to identify the body shortly after its discovery.{{sfnp|Knowles|2009|p= 138}} He described the body as being clad in a faded green rubber frogman suit of a type issued to Royal Navy divers, and the remains of a white sweater.{{sfnp|Knowles|2009|p= 140}} The suit had been cut open from the neck to the groin and along both legs, revealing very dark pubic hair.{{sfnp|Knowles|2009|p= 139}} Knowles examined the body closely, looking for a Y-shaped scar behind the left knee and a prominent scar on the left thigh. He failed to find any scars on the body, and stated that it was not Crabb.{{sfnp|Knowles|2009|p= 139-140}}

A pathologist, Dr. D. P. King, examined the body and stated in a short report for the inquest that a careful examination of the body failed to reveal any scars or marks of identification.{{sfnp|Knowles|2009|p= 138}}

===Inquest===
The [[inquest]] was opened on 11 June 1957 by Bridgman, who had received the pathologist's report that there was no way of establishing identification.{{sfnp|Knowles|2009|p= 142}} As neither Knowles nor Crabb's ex-wife nor a Lieutenant McLanachan, a Royal Navy torpedo officer from HMS ''Vernon'', had been able to identify the body; Bridgman adjourned the inquest until 26 June to allow time for a positive identification.{{sfnp|Knowles|2009|p= 142}}

The inquest was resumed on 26 June. The pathologist, King, gave evidence that he had returned to the mortuary and re-examined the body on 14 June. He reported that he had found a scar in the shape of an inverted Y on the left side of the left knee, and a scar on the left thigh, about the size of a [[Sixpence (British coin)|sixpenny coin]]. King stated that the scar had been photographed whilst he was present.{{sfnp|Knowles|2009|p= 144}}

===Fate===
As information was declassified under the 50-year rule, new facts on Crabb's disappearance came to light. On 27 October 2006, [[the National Archives]] released papers relating to the fatal ''Ordzhonikidze'' mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6089952.stm|title=Details on vanished 'spy' diver|publisher=BBC|date=27 October 2007|accessdate= 10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sydney Knowles, a former diving partner of Crabb's, stated in a televised interview on ''[[Inside Out (2002 TV programme)|Inside Out – South]]'' on 19 January 2007 that Crabb did not dive alone on his fatal last mission: "He told me they'd given him a buddy diver." Furthermore, papers released under the Freedom of Information Act indicate that there were other divers investigating the ''Ordzhonikidze'' while the ship was in Portsmouth Harbour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/south/series11/index_mobile_phones_bugging.shtml |title=BBC Inside Out |publisher=BBC |date=19 January 2007 |accessdate=8 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 November 2007, ''[[The Independent]]'' reported how the government had covered up the death of 'Buster' Crabb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Verkaik |first=Robert |title=Freedom Of Information: How the Government covered up the death of 'Buster' Crabb |publisher=''The Independent'' |date=9 November 2007 |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/legal/article3143239.ece |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111015318/http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/legal/article3143239.ece |archivedate=11 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cruiser ''Ordzhonikidze'' was later transferred by the Soviet government to Indonesia in 1962, where it operated as KRI ''Irian''. The ship operated in the conflict against the Netherlands over [[West Papua (region)|West Papua]], and was later used as floating detention centre for suspected communists during the [[Indonesian killings of 1965–1966]]. The cruiser was scrapped in 1971.

==Theories and speculations==
===Died during Soviet interrogation===
The spy [[Harry Houghton]] wrote a book called "Operation Portland" after he was released from prison in which he outlined the explanation of Crabb's death which he claimed to have been given by his Russian handler, a man he knew as Roman, in July 1956. Houghton claims that shortly before the Soviet visit he had been meeting Roman in a pub in [[Puncknowle]], Dorset, and happened to see a friend who worked at the Underwater Detection Establishment with her boyfriend who was a diver. The boyfriend was annoyed that he had been training for something special, which had just been called off. Shortly after hearing this, Roman had cut short the meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Houghton |first=Harry |authorlink=Harry Houghton |title=Operation Portland |publisher=Hart-Davis |year=1972 |page=43 |ISBN=0246105488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this account, after guessing that there may be some attempt by divers connected with the ''Ordzhonikidze'', the Soviet Navy had arranged for six underwater sentries to watch the bottom of the ship, which had been fitted with wire jackstays on either side to help them hold on to. When Crabb arrived, a struggle ensued in which Crabb's air supply was turned off and he passed out. He was then hauled on board, and taken to the sick bay (having passed out a second time) and given medical treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Houghton |first=Harry |authorlink=Harry Houghton |title=Operation Portland |publisher=Hart-Davis |year=1972 |pages=49–50 |ISBN=0246105488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Crabb had recovered sufficiently, the Soviets began to interrogate him; Crabb was making a confession when he collapsed and this time did not recover. The Soviets, aware that they might be accused of causing his death, decided to fix his body lightly to the bottom of the ship so that it came loose once the ship was under way. In the event, the body entangled in something underwater which meant it did not get discovered for fourteen months. Houghton also puts forward the theory that Crabb's mission was to plant a small limpet mine on the ''Ordzhonikidze'' whose purpose was to detect whether the Soviet Navy was using the latest [[sonar]] technology: if it was, the mine would detonate, and the ship would slow down; if not, the mine would eventually detach and go to the bottom of the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Houghton |first=Harry |authorlink=Harry Houghton |title=Operation Portland |publisher=Hart-Davis |year=1972 |pages=50–51 |ISBN=0246105488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Killed by the Soviets===
In a 1990 interview Joseph Zwerkin, a former member of Soviet Naval intelligence who had moved to [[Israel]] after the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|breakup of the Soviet Union]], claimed that the Soviets had noticed Crabb in the water and that a Soviet sniper had shot him. Official government documents regarding Crabb's disappearance are not scheduled to be released until 2057.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Socotra|first=Vic|title=The Crabb Affair |url=http://www.vicsocotra.com/stories/9-25-07-crabb_affair.htm|publisher=www.vicsocotra.com|accessdate=12 July 2011|date=25 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 November 2007, the [[BBC]] and the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' reported that Eduard Koltsov, a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[frogman]], claimed to have caught Crabb placing a mine on the ''Ordzhonikidze'' hull near the ammunition depot and cut his throat. In an interview for a documentary film, Koltsov showed the dagger he allegedly used in a Russian documentary as well as an [[Order of the Red Star]] medal that he claimed to have been awarded for the deed.&lt;ref name=mirror-20071117 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russian 'killed UK diver' in 1956|publisher=BBC|date=16 November 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7097646.stm|accessdate=16 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koltsov, 74 at the time of the interview, stated that he wanted to clear his conscience and make known exactly what happened to Crabb.&lt;ref name="Williams 2007"&gt;{{cite web| last = Williams | first = David | title = Cold War mystery solved? I killed Buster Crabb says Russian frogman  | publisher = Daily Mail  |date=16 November 2007| url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-494433/Cold-War-mystery-solved-I-killed-Buster-Crabb-says-Russian-frogman.html  | accessdate = 2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It seems extremely unlikely that the British government would have tried to blow up a Soviet ship on a diplomatic mission while it was anchored in British waters carrying the leaders of the Soviet Union, making Koltsov's claim of a mine suspect.&lt;ref name="Williams 2007"/&gt; A Russian journalist from the military ''[[Krasnaya Zvezda]]'' newspaper considers Koltsov's story improbable. In particular the archive documents do not confirm that Koltsov (a city bus driver for 30 years in Rostov-on-Don) was awarded Order of the Red Star or was a Soviet frogman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Фальшивая "Барракуда"|publisher=[[«Красная звезда»]]|date=27 September 2008|url=http://old.redstar.ru/2008/09/27_09/7_02.html|accessdate=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An account of this event in the ''[[Daily Mail]]''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-494433/Cold-War-mystery-solved-I-killed-Buster-Crabb-says-Russian-frogman.html&lt;/ref&gt; says that Buster Crabb may have been planting not an explosive device but a listening device.

===Captured, brainwashed, defected or a double agent===
Certain [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Members of Parliament]] and Michael Hall became concerned about Crabb's ultimate fate and in 1961, Commander [[John Simon Kerans|J.S. Kerans]] (and later in 1964 [[Marcus Lipton]]) submitted proposals to re-open the case but were rebuffed. Various people speculated that Crabb had been killed by some secret Soviet underwater weapon; that he had been captured and imprisoned in [[Lefortovo prison]] with prison number 147, that he had been [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] to work for the Soviet Union to train their frogman teams; that he had defected and became a commander in the [[Soviet Navy]];&lt;ref&gt;See ''The Fake Defector'' by Hutton who suggests he used the name "Lev Lvovich Korablov"&lt;/ref&gt; that he was in the Soviet Special Task Underwater Operational Command in the [[Black Sea]] Fleet; or that MI6 had asked him to defect so he could become a [[double agent]].&lt;ref name="Hoole"/&gt;

===MI5 theory===
On 26 March 2006, ''[[the Mail on Sunday]]'' published an article by Tim Binding entitled "Buster Crabb was murdered – by MI5". Binding wrote a fictionalised account of Crabb's life, ''Man Overboard'' which was published by Picador in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=DJ Taylor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jun/11/featuresreviews.guardianreview14 |title=Review: Man Overboard by Tim Binding|publisher=The Guardian |date= 11 June 2005|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Binding stated that, following the book's publication, he was contacted by [[Sydney Knowles]].&lt;ref name="MI5 linked to Crabb death"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.divemagazine.co.uk/news/latest-news/2514-mi5-linked-to-crabb-death |title=MI5 linked to Crabb death |publisher=Divemagazine.co.uk |date=21 April 2006 |accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Binding alleged that he then met Knowles in [[Spain]] and was told that Crabb was known by [[MI5]] to have intentions of [[defection|defecting]] to the [[USSR]]. This would have been embarrassing for the UK — Crabb being an acknowledged war hero. Knowles has suggested that MI5 set up the mission to the ''Ordzhonikidze'' specifically to murder Crabb, and supplied Crabb with a new diving partner who was under orders to kill him. Binding stated Knowles alleged that he was ordered by MI5 to identify the body found as Crabb, when he knew it was definitely not Crabb. Knowles went along with the deception. Knowles has also alleged that his life was threatened in [[Torremolinos]] in 1989, at a time when Knowles was in discussions with a [[biographer]]. About the claims that Crabb was planning to defect to the Soviet Union, Reg Vallintine of the Historical Diving Society was quoted as saying:"Diving historians find it very hard to believe that this man, who prided himself on being a patriot, would have seriously considered defecting. Crabb was very fond of being a hero, and it is hard to imagine him jeopardising that status."&lt;ref name="MI5 linked to Crabb death"/&gt; It is not clear just why MI6 would recruit a man who was known to be planning to defect to the Soviet Union to spy against the Soviet Union or why Crabb would agree to such a mission if he really had decided that he wanted to live in the Soviet Union.

===Death by misadventure===
The British diving expert Rob Hoole wrote in 2007 that Crabb had probably died of oxygen poisoning or perhaps carbon dioxide poisoning, and that Crabb's age and poor health caused by his heavy drinking and smoking had made him unsuitable for the mission that he had been assigned.&lt;ref name="Hoole"/&gt; In support of the death by misadventure theory, Hoole noted that before disappearing on his second attempt to dive the ''Ordzhonikidze'', Crabb had during his first attempt experienced equipment failure, which suggested that Crabb's equipment was not up to standard.&lt;ref name="Hoole"/&gt; Crabb's MI6 officer [[John Nicholas Rede Elliott]] always took the view that Crabb had suffered equipment failure and/or his health had given way, and that his reputation had been unfairly dragged through the mud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last = Hastings  | first = Stephen  | authorlink = Stephen Hastings    | title = Obituary: Nicholas Elliott   | publisher = The Independent  |date= 18 April 1994| url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-nicholas-elliott-1370833.html    | accessdate = 2 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical media===
In a War Documentary Series titled “Secrets Of War,” episode titled  “The Cold War. Khrushchev's Regime“ A 1996 interview with former head of the KGB [[Vladimir Semichastny]] reported, Crabb's decapitated body was found floating in the harbour 2 months after his disappearance. In the interview, Semichastny states that the “Crabb Affair” was handled elegantly.&lt;ref&gt;War Documentary Series titled “Secrets Of War,” episode titled “The Cold War. Khrushchev's Regime“ hosted by Charlton Heston, published by Mill Creek in 2014 - English narration&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MV ''Christinaki''''' was a [[Malta|Maltese]] [[bulk carrier]] which sank in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] {{convert|240|nmi|km}} south west of Ireland during a force 10 gale with a cargo of scrap metal and 27 crew while she was travelling from [[Liverpool]], [[United Kingdom]] to [[Vera Cruz (city)|Vera Cruz]].&lt;ref name=JGM&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/survivors-sighted-as-rescuers-hunt-cargo-ship-lost-in-storm-1391867.html |title=Survivors sighted as rescuers hunt cargo ship lost in storm |publisher=independent.co.uk |date=4 February 1994 |accessdate=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==
''Christinaki'' was constructed in 1973 at the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders Ltd. shipyard in [[Govan]], [[Scotland]], [[United Kingdom]]. She was launched on 29 June 1972 and completed on 1 February 1973 for [[Irish Shipping]] and was named ''MV Irish Pine''&lt;ref name="clydebuilt"&gt;{{cite web |title=MV Irish Pine |publisher=Clydebuilt Database |year=2014 |url=http://www.clydesite.co.uk/clydebuilt/ireland/IRISH_PINE_126.html |accessdate=2016-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and switched owners and names several times before her demise in 1994.
The ship was {{convert|174.96|m|ftin}} long, with a beam of {{convert|25.6|m|ftin}} and a depth of {{convert|9.75|m|ftin}}. The ship was assessed at {{GRT|16,704}}. She had a 1 x 6cyl. 2SA Kincaid-B&amp;W 6K74EF engine driving a single screw propeller, the engine was rated at 11.400 b.h.p.&lt;ref name="clydebuilt"/&gt;&lt;ref name=JSM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parthenon.uk.com/disaster-christinaki.htm |title=Loss of the Bulk Carrier "MV Christinaki" |publisher=parthenon.uk.com |date=2009 |accessdate=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sinking ==
On 2 February 1994, ''Christinaki'' left [[Liverpool]], [[United Kingdom]] with a cargo of scrap metal bound for [[Vera Cruz (city)|Vera Cruz]]. 

The following day the weather worsened and the ship was soon caught in a force 10 storm {{convert|240|nmi|km}} south west of Ireland with 35 feet (10 meter) waves ramming her deck. The ship quickly took on water as the hold hatch covers failed. The crew knowing that the ship was taken in water and was in mortal danger quickly radioed a distress signal at 4 PM. The last radio contact was made at 4:30 PM, at this time the ships is believed to have sunk. Rescuers searched the following day for any survivors near the last known location of the ship but it was soon clear that the 27 Greek and Filipino crew members had perished.&lt;ref name=ASM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?58850 |title=MV Christinaki [+1994] |publisher=Wrecksite |date=1 August 2008 |accessdate=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wreck ==
The wreck's current position is unknown.

'''Margarete Hielscher''' (September 12, 1899 in [[Arnsdorf]] - April 13, 1985 in [[Stadtroda]]) was a German doctor, who was involved in Nazi crimes in the context of "child euthanasia". Margarete Hielscher propagated in 1930 a segregation of mentally handicapped people whom she described as "hereditary inferiority"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.am/books?id=XVrPAQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=Margarete+Hielscher&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Der Nürnberger Ärzteprozess. 3., überarbeitete Auflage|last=Jürgen|first= Peter|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster, 1994|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;. During the Second World War, she led under the hospital clinic director [[Gerhard Kloos]] - euphemistically called - "Children's Department" at the [[Thuringia]] State Hospitals Stadtroda, which was affiliated to the youth psychiatric department; the children admitted there, at least 72 died through food deprivation or lethal injection.

'''Massa''' (1930 &amp;ndash; 30 December 1984) was the oldest living [[gorilla]], reaching an age of 54 years, until his death in 1984.&lt;ref name=Massa&gt;{{cite web|title=All results for Massa The Gorilla |url=http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?gsln=Massa%20the%20Gorilla&amp;gsfn=&amp;gl=allgs |website=http://search.ancestry.com/ |accessdate=30 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827191220/http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?gsln=Massa%20the%20Gorilla&amp;gsfn=&amp;gl=allgs |archivedate=27 August 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Massa was born in the wild in [[Ghana]].  He was shipped to [[United States|America]] at an early age and his first owner was [[Brooklyn]] [[Eccentricity (behaviour)|eccentric]] [[Gertrude Lintz]].  In 1935, after accidentally spilling water on Massa, which startled him severely, Mrs. Lintz decided to sell him to the [[Philadelphia Zoo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.philly.com/2000-03-31/news/25607542_1_massa-gorillas-african-lowland A Farewell To Massa, Daily News, by Frank Dougherty, Jan. 2, 1985]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/01/us/54-year-old-gorilla-oldest-in-captivity-dies-in-philadelphia.html, NY Times, 54-YEAR-OLD GORILLA, OLDEST IN CAPTIVITY, DIES IN PHILADELPHIA, UPI,  January 1, 1985 ]&lt;/ref&gt;{{deadlink|date=January 2017}}

In his prime, Massa weighed 400&amp;nbsp;lbs.

Massa lived at the zoo until his death from a [[stroke]] on 30 December 1984, following a special birthday party held by the zoo, complete with a special cake and a live [[dixieland]] band.  He was buried within the grounds of the zoo.

The film ''[[Buddy (1997 film)|Buddy]]'' was based on the life of Massa (with some elements from the life of another of Mrs. Lintz's gorillas, [[Gargantua (gorilla)|Gargantua]], who was known at the time as Buddy).

'''Nigger''' was a male black [[labrador retriever]] belonging to [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] [[Guy Gibson]] of the [[Royal Air Force]], and the mascot of [[No. 617 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;617&amp;nbsp;Squadron]]. Gibson owned the dog when he was previously a member of [[No. 106 Squadron RAF|106 Squadron]]. Nigger often accompanied Gibson on training flights&lt;ref name="Toms2006" /&gt; and was a great favourite of the members of both 106 and 617 Squadrons. He was noted for his liking of beer, which he drank from his own bowl in the Officers' Mess.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holland|2012|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nigger died on 16 May 1943, the day of the famous [[Operation Chastise|"Dam Busters" raid]], when he was hit by a car.  He was buried at midnight as Gibson was leading the raid. "Nigger" ([[Morse code]]: -. .. --. --. . .-. ) was the codeword Gibson used to confirm the breach of the [[Möhne Reservoir|Möhne Dam]]. Nigger's grave is at [[RAF Scampton|Royal Air Force station Scampton]], [[Lincolnshire]].&lt;ref name="Toms2006" /&gt;

==Name==
The word [[nigger]] was used as a dog's name during the early part of the 20th century. A black explosive [[sniffer dog]] named Nigger served with a [[Royal Engineers]] mine clearance unit in 1944 during the [[Normandy Campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/205205977 | title=THE BRITISH ARMY IN NORMANDY 1944 | publisher=Imperial war Museum | accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dog leading a [[sledge dog]] team on the [[Terra Nova Expedition]] to the Antarctic (1910-1912) was also named Nigger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/6/7/2/6721/6721-8.txt|title=The Voyages of Captain Scott|first=Charles|last= Turley|publisher=[[Project Gutenberg]]|accessdate=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portrayal on film==
=== Censorship ===
Nigger was portrayed in the 1955 British [[war film]] ''[[The Dam Busters (film)|The Dam Busters]]'', in which he was mentioned by name frequently. In 1999, British television network [[ITV Network|ITV]] broadcast a censored version of the film, with all instances of the name removed. ITV blamed regional broadcaster [[London Weekend Television]], which in turn alleged that a junior staff member had been responsible for the unauthorised cuts. When [[ITV Network|ITV]] again showed a censored version in June 2001, it was criticised by [[Index on Censorship]] as "unnecessary and ridiculous" and because the edits introduced continuity errors.&lt;ref name="Guardian1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ramsden2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent1" /&gt;  The code word "nigger" transmitted in [[Morse Code]] upon the successful completion of the central mission was not censored.  More recently, in 2012, ITV3 had shown the film uncut a few times, but with a warning at the start that it contains racial terms from the period which some people may find offensive.  However, in 2013 the film had been shown a few times by Channel 5 uncut and without any warning. On Thursday 17th May 2018 a uncut version was shown on UK channel Film 4 with warning explaining about historical and some would find racial offensive.

Some edited American versions of the film use dubbing to change Nigger's name to Trigger.&lt;ref name="Guardian1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ramsden2003" /&gt;

[[File:RAF Scampton 022.jpg|thumb|right|Nigger's grave]]
[[File:Hangar at RAF Scampton, showing Nigger's grave - geograph.org.uk - 55064.jpg|thumb|right|Area around the grave]]

===Symbolism===
Film critics have observed that Nigger is used in the film as a symbol of the men's emotional attachment to one another, an attachment that is not directly expressed between the film's characters.  Sarah Street notes that the film, while full of emotion, does not articulate it except through secondary devices such as the affection that the characters are shown giving to Nigger.&lt;ref name="Street1997" /&gt;  Christine Geraghty, a lecturer in media studies, observed that "Gibson's suppression of feelings is presented as appropriate rather than problematic, and the use of the dog as his most explicit emotional attachment is in keeping with the way in which class and masculinity are brought together in this isolated but self-sufficient figure."&lt;ref name="Chapman2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Geraghty2000" /&gt;  James Chapman, lecturer at the [[Open University]], adds to that the observation that the scene where Gibson is shown choking back his grief at the death of Nigger, silent and blinking awkwardly, is an example of the [[stiff upper lip]] behaviour characteristic of British war films of the genre.&lt;ref name="Street1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chapman2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Geraghty2000" /&gt;

===Renaming===
[[Richard Todd]], who played Gibson in the film, was interviewed on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]'' programme in 2005 along with Jonathan Falconer, author of a book about the film, about the name of the dog and whether any remake of the film should retain the name.&lt;ref name="Bressey2008" /&gt; Todd, in a pre-recorded interview, said:
{{quote|With political correctness which is a new concept of a way of life in this country and I think all over the world it didn't exist when we made the original film so Nigger was Nigger, but nowadays you can't say that sort of thing.&lt;ref name=Bressey2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Todd2005 /&gt;}}

In response to being asked whether the name should be censored in a remake, Falconer said:
{{quote|No.  I think it's a question of historical accuracy here &amp;hellip; the film and obviously the events are very much part of the time they were made in and took part in and so I think tinkering with the historical accuracy of the film and of the story is a very dangerous and slippery slope to start down.&lt;ref name=Bressey2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Falconer2005 /&gt;}}
In response to being asked whether he thought people would accept this as historical accuracy, Falconer said:
{{quote|Well they ought to.  If they are being objective about it then I think they should accept it as historical accuracy, but I can understand why some people may find it offensive.&lt;ref name=Bressey2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Falconer2005 /&gt;}}

In the same interview, [[George Baker (actor)|George Baker]], who also acted in the film, in response to being asked whether any opinion had been expressed on the name at the time that the film was made, said:
{{quote|No, none at all.  Political correctness wasn't even invented, and an awful lot of black dogs were called Nigger.&lt;ref name=Bressey2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Baker2005 /&gt;}}

[[Peter Jackson]], producer of the remake that later began, said in 2006 that "It is not our intention to offend people. But really you are in a no-win, damned-if-you-do-and-damned-if-you-don't scenario:  If you change it, everyone's going to whinge and whine about political correctness. And if you don't change it, obviously you are offending a lot of people inadvertently. &amp;hellip; We haven't made any decisions about what we'll do."&lt;ref name="Independent1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN1" /&gt;  [[Stephen Fry]], writer for the remake, was asked to provide several alternative names for the dog, and came up with several suggestions.  Executive producer [[David Frost]] rejected them all, saying "Guy sometimes used to call his dog Nigsy, so I think that's what we will call it. Stephen has been coming up with other names, but this is the one I want."&lt;ref name="Independent1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DominionPost1" /&gt;  Jackson's assistant contradicted this a week later, however, saying "To stay true to the story, you can't just change &amp;#91;the name&amp;#93;. We have not made any decisions yet. The script is still being written; and that decision will be made closer to the time."&lt;ref name="Independent1" /&gt;

Recently, one writer, James Holland, has commented that controversy over the dog's name seems to have overshadowed other aspects of the raid.  When he told people that he was planning to write a book on the raid, 9 out of 10 replied "What are you going to call the dog?".  He found that the three characters connected with the raid that most people had heard of were Guy Gibson, Barnes Wallis and Nigger the dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holland|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''optokinetic drum''' —also called '''catford drum'''— is a rotating instrument to test [[visual system|vision]] in which individuals are seated facing the wall of the drum. The interior surface of the drum is normally striped; thus, as the drum rotates, the subject's eyes are subject to a moving visual field while the subject remains stationary, this phenomenon is called [[Optokinetic response|optokinetic Nystagmus]]. The speed of the drum and the duration of the test may be varied.  [[Treatment group|Control groups]] are placed in a drum without stripes or rotation.  After exposure to the rotating drum, subjects are surveyed to determine their susceptibility to [[motion sickness]].  A study in which the optokinetic drum was used to test the symptoms of the [[sopite syndrome]] showed increased [[Mood swing|mood changes]] in response to the visual cues, though these effects were compounded by other environmental factors such as [[boredom]] and lack of [[Physical exercise|activity]].&lt;ref&gt;Kiniorski, E. T., Weider, S. K., Finley, J. R., Fitzgerald, E. M., Howard, J. C., Di Nardo, P. A., et al. (2004). Sopite symptoms in the optokinetic drum.

{{Spanish name 2|Sarmiento|de Gamboa}}
[[File:Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa (RPS 16-11-2014) Alcalá de Henares.png|thumbnail|Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa.]]
'''Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa''' (1532–1592) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] explorer, author, historian, mathematician, astronomer, and scientist. His birthplace is not certain and may have been [[Pontevedra]], in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], where his paternal family originated, or [[Alcalá de Henares]] in [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]], where he later is known to have studied .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artehistoria.jcyl.es/cronicas/contextos/10105.htm ''Relación y derrotero del viaje y descubrimiento del Estrecho de la Madre de Dios - antes llamado de Magallanes'']. ''Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa, según Amancio Landín, uno de sus más reputados biógrafos, nació en Pontevedra, hacia 1532. Julio Guillén --el marino-académico--, por su parte, dice que es posible fuera Colegial Mayor en la Universidad de Alcalá de Henares, ciudad que fue --asegura-- cuna del gran marino español. Este, no ha dejado aclarada la duda sobre su origen geográfico, pues afirmó ser natural de ambos lugares''.&lt;/ref&gt; His father [[Bartolomé Sarmiento]]  was born in  Pontevedra and his mother [[María Gamboa]] was born in [[Bilbao]], [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
At the age of 18, Sarmiento de Gamboa entered the royal military in the European wars. Between 1550 and 1555 the future navigator fought in the armies of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]]. In 1555 he began his exploring career, sailing across the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. His first destination was [[New Spain]] (in what is today [[Mexico]]), where he lived for two years. Little is known of this period in his life, other than that he encountered difficulties with the [[Inquisition]]. He then sailed to [[Peru]], where he lived for more than twenty years, gaining a reputation as a navigator.&lt;ref name=Quanchi&gt;Quanchi (2005). ''Historical Dictionary of the Discovery and Exploration of the Pacific Islands'', page 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Lima he was accused by the Inquisition of possessing two magic rings and some magic ink and of following the precepts of [[Moses]]. He then joined [[Álvaro de Mendaña]]'s expedition through the southern [[Pacific Ocean]] to find the ''[[Terra Australis Incognita]]'', which, should Mendaña followed Sarmiento's indications, had reached [[New Zealand]] or/and [[Australia]]; but they discovered the [[Solomon Islands]] instead, in 1568. The expedition failed to find gold and attempts at establishing a settlement in the Solomon Islands ended in failure.&lt;ref name= Quanchi/&gt;

In order to take credit of the discoveries for himself Mendaña threw the journals and maps made by Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa overboard and abandoned him in [[Mexico]]. However, a trial was then held in Lima, with the result giving Sarmiento credit for the discoveries.

In 1572 he was commissioned by [[Francisco de Toledo]], the fifth [[Viceroy of Peru]], to write a history of the [[Incas]]. Toledo hoped such a history would justify Spanish colonisation by revealing the violent history of the Incas. Sarmiento collected oral accounts first hand from Inca informants and produced a history (commonly titled ''The History of the Incas'') that chronicles their violent conquest of the region.

===''The History of the Incas''===
Written in [[Cuzco]], the capital of the Inca Empire, just forty years after the arrival of the first Spaniards in the city, Sarmiento's ''The History of the Incas'' contains extremely detailed descriptions of Inca history and mythology.  The royal sponsorship of the work guaranteed Sarmiento direct access to the highest Spanish officials in Cuzco. It also allowed him to summon influential natives, as well as those who had witnessed the fall of the Inca Empire, so that they could relate their stories. Sarmiento travelled widely and interviewed numerous local leaders and lords, surviving members of the royal Inca families, and the few remaining Spanish conquistadors who still resided in Cuzco. Once the first draft of the history was completed, in an unprecedented effort to establish the unquestionable authenticity of the work, his manuscript was read, chapter by chapter, to forty-two indigenous authorities for their commentary and correction.  After the public reading, which occurred on 29 February and 1 March 1572, the manuscript was entrusted to a member of the viceroy's personal guard. He was to take the manuscript to Spain and deliver it to King Philip II, along with four painted cloths showing the history of the Incas and a number of other artefacts and objects that Toledo had collected. However, due to a series of unusual events, this irreplaceable document of Inca history was relegated to obscurity for centuries.

===Strait of Magellan===
He became the commander of the naval station in the Pacific in 1578, when Sir [[Francis Drake]] attacked the coasts of Peru and Mexico. Sarmiento de Gamboa sailed out of the port of [[Callao]] with eleven vessels in 1579 to capture Drake. He did not find Drake, who had gone westward through the Pacific Ocean, but he explored the southern Pacific Coast of South America, passed the [[Magellan Strait]] from west to east for the second time, drawing precious maps of many points of the Strait, and, after an impressive sailing of the [[Atlantic Ocea]]n from southwest to northeast, he reached Spain in late 1580.

On his reporting the results of his expedition to King [[Philip II of Spain]], the latter resolved to fortify the Strait, and in 1581 sent an expedition of twenty-four vessels with 2,500 men from [[Cadiz]], under the command of Sarmiento de Gamboa and [[Diego Flores Valdez]]. The expedition lost eight vessels in a storm, and Flores, on account of rivalry with Sarmiento de Gamboa, abandoned him with twelve vessels in the entry of the Strait and returned to Spain. With only four vessels, Sarmiento de Gamboa continued the voyage, arriving in January 1583 at a favorable point, where he established a fort and colony garrisoned by 300 men which he called ''Rey Don Felipe''. The settlement failed shortly after he left, and when [[Thomas Cavendish]] visited the ruins in 1587 he renamed the place [[Puerto del Hambre|Port Famine]].

In 1584 Sarmiento de Gamboa sailed for Europe, but he was captured by an English fleet under to Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] and carried to [[England]] where he was presented to Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]]. They had a conversation in [[Latin]], which was their only common language, and despite Spain's official policy of keeping all navigational information secret, shared his maps with British cartographers.&lt;ref name= Quanchi/&gt; Queen Elizabeth gave him a "Letter of Peace" to be carried to King Phillip II of Spain. However, on his way back to Spain he was captured by French [[Huguenot]]s and was  kept prisoner until 1588. During that time Spain mounted the [[Spanish Armada]] and attacked the English fleet. If Queen Elizabeth's  "Letter of Peace" had been delivered in time to Spain, there might not have been a war. Meanwhile, his colony dissolved and gradually perished of starvation; one of the survivors was rescued by Cavendish's fleet in 1587, and another by Meriche in 1589. After his liberation, Sarmiento de Gamboa made a representation of his experience and a complaint against Flores to King Philip II; it seems that his complaint was neglected.

===Later life===
Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa spent the rest of his life dedicating himself to his writings and worked as an editor of poetry. On his last naval mission in the service of the king he was made Admiral of an armada of galleons en route to the Indies. He died on board ship, near the coast of Lisbon.

==Legacy==
Sarmiento de Gamboa is commemorated in the [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific name]] of a species of South American lizard, ''[[Liolaemus|Liolaemus sarmientoi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). ''The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. {{ISBN|978-1-4214-0135-5}}. ("Sarmiento", p. 233).&lt;/ref&gt;

A Spanish research vessel, [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buque_Oceanogr%C3%A1fico_Sarmiento_de_Gamboa ''BO Sarmiento de Gamboa''], also carries his name.

'''Sex-selective abortion''' is the practice of terminating a pregnancy based upon the predicted sex of the infant. The selective [[abortion]] of female fetuses is most common where male children are valued over female children, especially in parts of [[East Asia]] and [[South Asia]] (particularly in countries such as [[People's Republic of China]], [[India]] and [[Pakistan]]), as well as in the [[Caucasus]], and [[Western Balkans]].&lt;ref name="Goodkind"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Goodkind, Daniel |year=1999 |title=Should Prenatal Sex Selection be Restricted?: Ethical Questions and Their Implications for Research and Policy |journal=Population Studies |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=49–61 |jstor=2584811 |doi=10.1080/00324720308069}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gettis"&gt;A.

Sex selective abortion was first documented in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/china-s-new-birth-rule-can-t-restore-missing-women-and-fix-a-population/&lt;/ref&gt; and became commonplace by the late 1980s in [[South Korea]] and [[China]].

Studies and reports focusing on sex-selective abortion are predominantly statistical; they assume that birth sex ratio—the overall ratio of boys and girls at birth for a regional population, is an indicator of sex-selective abortion. This assumption has been questioned by some scholars.&lt;ref name=James-JournalofEndocrinology /&gt;

Scholars who support the assumption, suggest that the expected birth sex ratio range is 103 to 107 males to females at birth.&lt;ref name=unfpa2012&gt;[http://www.unfpa.org/webdav/site/global/shared/documents/publications/2012/Report_SexRatios_2012.pdf Report of the International Workshop on Skewed Sex Ratios at Birth] United Nations FPA (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kseb&gt;Kraemer, Sebastian. "The Fragile Male." British Medical Journal (2000): n. pag. British Medical Journal. Web. 20 Oct. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Countries considered to have significant practices of sex-selective abortion are those with birth sex ratios of 108 and above (selective abortion of females), and 102 and below (selective abortion of males).&lt;ref name=unfpa2012 /&gt;

== Human sex ratio at birth ==
{{Main|Human sex ratio}}
[[File:Abortion Laws.svg|thumb|400px|The [[human sex ratio]] at birth can vary for natural reasons as well as from sex-selective abortion. In many nations abortion is legal (see above map, dark blue).]]
Sex-selective abortion affects the [[human sex ratio]]—the relative number of males to females in a given age group.&lt;ref name=coevolution /&gt; Studies and reports that discuss sex-selective abortion are based on the assumption that birth sex ratio—the overall ratio of boys and girls at birth for a regional population, is an indicator of sex-selective abortion.&lt;ref name=James-JournalofEndocrinology /&gt;&lt;ref name= Junhong /&gt;

The natural human sex ratio at birth was estimated, in a 2002 study, to be close to 106 boys to 100 girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Unexplained differences in sex ratios at birth in Europe and North America | pmc=102777 | publisher=BMJ, NCBI/National Institutes of Health | pmid=11976243 |year=2002 |last1=Grech |first1=V |last2=Savona-Ventura |first2=C |last3=Vassallo-Agius |first3=P |volume=324 |issue=7344 |pages=1010–1 |journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.) | doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7344.1010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human sex ratio at birth that is significantly different from 106 is often assumed to be correlated to the prevalence and scale of sex-selective abortion. This assumption is controversial, and a subject of continuing scientific studies.

=== High or low human sex ratio implies sex-selective abortion ===
One school of scholars suggest that any birth sex ratio of boys to girls that is outside of the normal 105-107 range, necessarily implies sex-selective abortion. These scholars&lt;ref&gt;Therese Hesketh and Zhu Wei Xing, Abnormal sex ratios in human populations: Causes and consequences, PNAS, September 5, 2006, vol. 103, no. 36, pp 13271-13275&lt;/ref&gt; claim that both the sex ratio at birth and the population sex ratio are remarkably constant in human populations. Significant deviations in birth sex ratios from the normal range can only be explained by manipulation, that is sex-selective abortion.&lt;ref name= KlausenWink&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Klausen | first1 = Stephan | last2 = Wink | first2 = Claudia | year = 2003 | title = Missing Women: Revisiting the Debate | doi = 10.1080/1354570022000077999 | journal = Feminist Economics | volume = 9 | issue = 2–3| pages = 263–299 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a widely cited article,&lt;ref name= Sen1990&gt;Sen, Amartya (1990), More than 100 million women are missing, New York Review of Books, 20 December, pp. 61–66&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amartya Sen]] compared the birth sex ratio in Europe (106) and United States (105) with those in Asia (107+) and argued that the high sex ratios in East Asia, West Asia and South Asia may be due to excessive female mortality. Sen pointed to research that had shown that if men and women receive similar nutritional and medical attention and good health care then females have better survival rates, and it is the male which is the genetically fragile sex.&lt;ref name=kseb /&gt;

Sen estimated [[Missing women of Asia|'missing women' from extra women who would have survived in Asia]] if it had the same ratio of women to men as Europe and United States. According to Sen, the high birth sex ratio over decades, implies a female shortfall of 11% in Asia, or over 100 million women as missing from the 3 billion combined population of South Asia, West Asia, North Africa and China.

=== High or low human sex ratio may be natural ===
Other scholars question whether birth sex ratio outside 103-107 can be due to natural reasons. William James and others&lt;ref name=James-JournalofEndocrinology&gt;{{cite journal|author=James W.H.|title=Hypothesis:Evidence that Mammalian Sex Ratios at birth are partially controlled by parental hormonal levels around the time of conception|journal=Journal of Endocrinology|volume=198|pages=3–15|date=July 2008|doi= 10.1677/JOE-07-0446|url=http://joe.endocrinology-journals.org/content/198/1/3.full.pdf+html|issue=1|pmid=18577567}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see:

*there are equal numbers of X and Y chromosomes in mammalian sperms
*X and Y stand equal chance of achieving conception
*therefore equal number of male and female zygotes are formed, and that
*therefore any variation of sex ratio at birth is due to sex selection between conception and birth.

James cautions that available scientific evidence stands against the above assumptions and conclusions. He reports that there is an excess of males at birth in almost all human populations, and the natural sex ratio at birth is usually between 102 and 108. However the ratio may deviate significantly from this range for natural reasons such as early marriage and fertility, teenage mothers, average maternal age at birth, paternal age, age gap between father and mother, late births, ethnicity, social and economic stress, warfare, environmental and hormonal effects.&lt;ref name=James-JournalofEndocrinology /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Graffelman | first1 = Jan | last2 = Hoekstra | first2 = Rolf F. | year = 2000 | title = A Statistical Analysis of the Effect of Warfare on the Human Secondary Sex Ratio | url = | journal = Human Biology | volume = 72 | issue = 3| pages = 433–445 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This school of scholars support their alternate hypothesis with historical data when modern sex-selection technologies were unavailable, as well as birth sex ratio in sub-regions, and various ethnic groups of developed economies.&lt;ref name=rjhmam&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jacobsen | first1 = R. | last2 = Møller | first2 = H. | last3 = Mouritsen | first3 = A. | year = 1999 | title = Natural variation in the human sex ratio | url = | journal = Hum.

James' hypothesis is supported by historical birth sex ratio data before technologies for ultrasonographic sex-screening were discovered and commercialized in the 1960s and 1970s, as well by reverse abnormal sex ratios currently observed in Africa. Michel Garenne reports that many African nations have, over decades, witnessed birth sex ratios below 100, that is more girls are born than boys.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Garenne, Southern African Journal of Demography, Vol. 9, No. 1 (June 2004), pp. 91-96&lt;/ref&gt; [[Angola]], [[Botswana]] and [[Namibia]] have reported birth sex ratios between 94 and 99, which is quite different than the presumed 104 to 106 as natural human birth sex ratio.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Garenne, Southern African Journal of Demography, Vol. 9, No. 1 (June 2004), page 95&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Graunt]] noted that in London over a 35-year period in the 17th century (1628–62),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Campbell | first1 = RB | date = Aug 2001 | title = John Graunt, John Arbuthnott, and the human sex ratio | url = | journal = Hum.

(1938), Variations in the ratio at birth in USA, Human Biology, 10:36–64&lt;/ref&gt; Other historical records from Asia too support James hypothesis. For example, Jiang et al. claim that the birth sex ratio in China was 116–121 over a 100-year period in the late 18th and early 19th centuries; in the 120–123 range in the early 20th century; falling to 112 in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Jing-Bao Nei (2011), [http://bmb.oxfordjournals.org/content/98/1/7.full.pdf+html Non-medical sex-selective abortion in China: ethical and public policy issues in the context of 40 million missing females], British Med Bull 98 (1): 7-20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jiang B, Li S.

=== Data on human sex ratio at birth ===
In the United States, the sex ratios at birth over the period 1970–2002 were 105 for the white non-Hispanic population, 104 for Mexican Americans, 103 for African Americans and Native Americans, and 107 for mothers of Chinese or Filipino ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Matthews TJ, etal |title=Trend Analysis of the Sex Ratio at Birth in the United States |journal=National Vital Statistics Reports |volume=53 |issue=20 |date=June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Western European countries c. 2001, the ratios ranged from 104 to 107.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sex ratio in Switzerland|url=http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/en/index/themen/00/01/blank/02.html | publisher=Switzerland Federal Statistics Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UN Sex Ratio Statistics|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/unpop.htm|publisher=United Nations Population Division}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex ratio at birth (per 100 female newborn)|url=http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?q=sex+ratio+birth&amp;d=PopDiv&amp;f=variableID%3a52|publisher=United Nations Data Division}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aggregated results of 56 Demographic and Health Surveys&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.measuredhs.com/ Demographic and Health Survey]&lt;/ref&gt; in African countries, the birth sex ratio was found to be 103, though there is also considerable country-to-country, and year-to-year variation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Garenne M |title=Sex ratios at birth in African populations: a review of survey data |journal=Hum. Biol. |volume=74 |issue=6 |pages=889–900 |date=December 2002 |pmid=12617497 |doi=10.1353/hub.2003.0003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2005 study, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported sex ratio at birth in the United States from 1940 over 62 years.&lt;ref name=NCHS&gt;{{cite web|title=Trend Analysis of the Sex Ratio at Birth in the United States|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr53/nvsr53_20.pdf|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Center for Health Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statistical evidence suggested the following: For mothers having their first baby, the total sex ratio at birth was 106 overall, with some years at 107. For mothers having babies after the first, this ratio consistently decreased with each additional baby from 106 towards 103. The age of the mother affected the ratio: the overall ratio was 105 for mothers aged 25 to 35 at the time of birth; while mothers who were below the age of 15 or above 40 had babies with a sex ratio ranging between 94 and 111, and a total sex ratio of 104. This United States study also noted that American mothers of Hawaiian, Filipino, Chinese, Cuban and Japanese ethnicity had the highest sex ratio, with years as high as 114 and average sex ratio of 107 over the 62-year study period. Outside of United States, European nations with extensive birth records, such as Finland, report similar variations in birth sex ratios over a 250-year period, that is from 1751 to 1997 AD.&lt;ref name=tvlkjt&gt;{{cite journal |author1=T Vartiainen |author2=L Kartovaara |author3=J Tuomisto  |last-author-amp=yes |year= 1999|title= Environmental chemicals and changes in sex ratio: analysis over 250 years in finland|journal= Environmental Health Perspectives|volume= 107|issue= 10 |pages= 813–815|pmid= 10504147|doi=10.1289/ehp.99107813|pmc=1566625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, according to CIA estimates,&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt; the countries with the highest birth sex ratio were [[Liechtenstein]] (126), [[China]] (115), [[Armenia]] (113), [[India]] (112), [[Hong Kong]] (112), [[Azerbaijan]] (111), [[Falkland Islands]] (111), [[Vietnam]] (111), [[Albania]] (110), [[Grenada]] (110), [[San Marino]] (110), [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] (108), [[Isle of Man]] (108), [[Kosovo]] (108) and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] (108). The lowest boys to girls birth sex ratios in 2016 were estimated by CIA for&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt; [[Nauru]] (83), [[Kazakhstan]] (94), [[Barbados]] (101), [[Haiti]] (101), [[Aruba]] (102), [[Bermuda]] (102), [[Cayman Islands]] (102), [[Kenya]] (102),  [[Malawi]] (102), [[Mozambique]] (102), [[Puerto Rico]] (102), [[Qatar]] (102), [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]] (102), and [[South Africa]] (102).

=== Data reliability ===
The estimates for birth sex ratios, and thus derived sex-selective abortion, are a subject of dispute as well. For example, United States' CIA projects&lt;ref name=cia&gt;"[https://www.webcitation.org/6MCaBqfKG?url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2018.html Sex Ratio], The World Factbook, CIA, US Government (2013); Note: Sex ratio of 1.26 is same as 126 boys per 100 girls".&lt;/ref&gt; the birth sex ratio for [[Switzerland]] to be 106, while the Switzerland's Federal Statistical Office that tracks actual live births of boys and girls every year, reports the latest birth sex ratio for Switzerland as 107.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/6MCba7CSK?url=http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/en/index/themen/01/06/blank/key/02/01.html Births and deliveries] Switzerland (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Other variations are more significant; for example, CIA projects&lt;ref name=cia /&gt; the birth sex ratio for [[Pakistan]] to be 105, United Nations FPA office claims&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unfpa.org/webdav/site/global/shared/documents/Guilmoto_Revised_presentation_Hanoi_Oct2011.pdf Sex Ratios] {{webarchive|url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120604063319/https://www.unfpa.org/webdav/site/global/shared/documents/Guilmoto_Revised_presentation_Hanoi_Oct2011.pdf |date=June 4, 2012 }}, Christophe Z Guilmoto, UNFPA (2011), Page 13&lt;/ref&gt; the birth sex ratio for Pakistan to be 110, while the government of Pakistan claims its average birth sex ratio is 111.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov.pk/index.php Sex ratio at birth – National and Regional Census Data] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170513014654/http://www.census.gov.pk/index.php |date=May 13, 2017 }} Pakistan Census (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see:

The two most studied nations with high sex ratio and sex-selective abortion are China and India. The CIA estimates&lt;ref name=cia /&gt; a birth sex ratio of 112 for both in recent years. However, The World Bank claims the birth sex ratio for China in 2009 was 120 boys for every 100 girls;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2013/05/28/000333037_20130528144138/Rendered/PDF/776250JRN020090UBLIC00Missing0Girls.pdf The Consequences of the "Missing Girls" of China], Avraham Y. Ebenstein and Ethan Jennings Sharygin (2009), THE WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW, VOL. 23, NO. 3, page 401, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; while United Nations FPA estimates China's 2011 birth sex ratio to be 118.&lt;ref name=unfpaaugust2012 /&gt;

For India, the United Nations FPA claims a birth sex ratio of 111 over 2008–10 period,&lt;ref name=unfpaaugust2012 /&gt; while The World Bank and India's official 2011 Census reports a birth sex ratio of 108.&lt;ref name=teconomist /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/population_enumeration.aspx India Census 2011 Provisional Report] Government of India (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; These variations and data reliability is important as a rise from 108 to 109 for India, or 117 to 118 for China, each with large populations, represent a possible sex-selective abortion of about 100,000 girls.

== Prenatal sex discernment ==

[[File:Sex determination ban.JPG|thumb|left|Sign in an Indian hospital stating that prenatal sex determination is not done there and is illegal]]
[[File:Boy.JPG|thumb|Ultrasonography image showing the fetus is a boy.]]
The earliest post-implantation test, [[cell free fetal DNA]] testing, involves taking a blood sample from the mother and isolating the small amount of fetal [[DNA]] that can be found within it. When performed after week seven of pregnancy, this method is about 98% accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.2011.1114 |journal=JAMA |year=2011 |volume=306 |issue=6 |pages=627–636 |title=Noninvasive Fetal Sex Determination Using Cell-Free Fetal DNA |author1=Devaney SA |author2=Palomaki GE |author3=Scott JA |author4=Bianchi DW |pmid=21828326 |pmc=4526182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-14457670 |date=10 August 2011 |title=Baby gender blood tests 'accurate' |first=Michelle |last=Roberts |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Obstetric ultrasonography]], either transvaginally or transabdominally, checks for various markers of fetal sex. It can be performed at or after week 12 of pregnancy. At this point, {{frac|3|4}} of fetal sexes can be correctly determined, according to a 2001 study.&lt;ref name=mazza&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Mazza V, Falcinelli C, Paganelli S, etal |title=Sonographic early fetal gender assignment: a longitudinal study in pregnancies after in vitro fertilization |journal=Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol |volume=17 |issue=6 |pages=513–6 |date=June 2001 |pmid=11422974 |doi=10.1046/j.1469-0705.2001.00421.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accuracy for males is approximately 50% and for females almost 100%. When performed after week 13 of pregnancy, ultrasonography gives an accurate result in almost 100% of cases.&lt;ref name=mazza /&gt;

The most invasive measures are [[chorionic villus sampling]] (CVS) and [[amniocentesis]], which involve testing of the chorionic villus (found in the placenta) and [[amniotic fluid]], respectively. Both techniques typically test for [[Chromosome abnormality|chromosomal disorders]] but can also reveal the sex of the child and are performed early in the pregnancy. However, they are often more expensive and more dangerous than blood sampling or ultrasonography, so they are seen less frequently than other sex determination techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alfirevic | first1 = Z | last2 = von Dadelszen | first2 = P | year = 2003 | title = Instruments for chorionic villus sampling for prenatal diagnosis | url = | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = | issue = | page = CD000114 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD000114 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prenatal sex determination is restricted in many countries, and so is the communication of the sex of the fetus to the pregnant woman or her family, in order to prevent sex selective abortion.
In India, prenatal sex determination is regulated under the [[Pre-conception and Prenatal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act]] 1994.&lt;ref&gt;http://pndt.gov.in/writereaddata/mainlinkfile/File53.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

;Availability
China launched its first ultrasonography machine in 1979.&lt;ref name= Junhong /&gt; Chinese health care clinics began introducing ultrasound technologies that could be used to determine prenatal sex in 1982. By 1991, Chinese companies were producing 5,000 ultrasonography machines per year. Almost every rural and urban hospital and family planning clinics in China had a good quality sex discernment equipment by 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Junhong | first1 = Chu | year = 2001 | title = Prenatal Sex Determination and Sex-Selective Abortion in Rural Central China | url = | journal = Population and Development Review | volume = 27 | issue = 2| page = 260 |doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2001.00259.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The launch of ultrasonography technology in India too occurred in 1979, but its expansion was slower than China. Ultrasound sex discernment technologies were first introduced in major cities of India in the 1980s, its use expanded in India's urban regions in the 1990s, and became widespread in the 2000s.&lt;ref name=maydrgermany /&gt;

== Prevalence ==
The exact prevalence of sex-selective abortion is uncertain, with the practice taking place in some societies as an [[open secret]], without formal data on its frequency. Some authors argue that it is quite difficult to explain why this practice takes place in some cultures and not others, and that sex-selective abortion cannot be explained merely by patriarchal social norms, because most societies are male dominated, but only a minority practice sex-selective abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=4208631|year=2014|author1=Hohmann|first1=S.

China, the most populous country in the world, has a serious problem with an unbalanced sex ratio population. A 2010 BBC article stated that the sex birth ratio was 119 boys born per 100 girls, which rose to 130 boys per 100 girls in some rural areas.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8451289.stm&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences estimated that more than 24 million Chinese men of marrying age could find themselves without spouses by 2020.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt; In 1979, China enacted the [[one child policy]], which, within the country's deeply patriarchal culture, resulted in an unbalanced birth sex ratio. The one child policy was enforced very aggressively throughout the years, including through [[forced abortion]]s and [[forced sterilization]]s, but it has been gradually loosened in recent years, and formally abolished in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34665539&lt;/ref&gt; China's strong son preference is well documented in documentaries such as ''[[The Dying Rooms]]'' (1995) and ''[[It's a Girl: The Three Deadliest Words in the World]]'' (2012).

When sex ratio began being studied in China in 1960, it was still within the normal range. However, it climbed to 111.9 by 1990&lt;ref name= Junhong&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Junhong | first1 = Chu | year = 2001 | title = Prenatal Sex Determination and Sex-Selective Abortion in Rural Central China | jstor=2695209 | journal = Population and Development Review | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 259–81 | doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2001.00259.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to 118 by 2010 per its official census.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-08/16/c_131052436.htm China's sex ratio declines for two straight years] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222173509/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-08/16/c_131052436.htm |date=February 22, 2015 }} Xinhua, China&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kang C, Wang Y. Sex ratio at birth. In: Theses Collection of 2001 National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Survey. Beijing: China Population Publishing House, 2003:88-98.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers believe that the causes of this sex ratio imbalance are increased female infant mortality, underreporting of female births and sex-selective abortion. According to Zeng et al. (1993), the most prominent cause is probably sex-selective abortion, but this is difficult to prove that in a country with little reliable birth data because of the hiding of "illegal" (under the One-Child Policy) births.&lt;ref name=zengyi93&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yi | first1 = Zeng | display-authors = etal   | year = 1993 | title = Causes and implications of the recent increase in the reported sex ratio at birthin China | url = | journal = Population and Development Review | volume = 19 | issue = 2| pages = 283–302 | doi=10.2307/2938438| jstor = 2938438 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These illegal births have led to underreporting of female infants. Zeng et al., using a reverse survival method, estimate that underreporting keeps about 2.26% male births and 5.94% female births off the books. Adjusting for unreported illegal births, they conclude that the corrected Chinese sex ratio at birth for 1989 was 111 rather than 115.&lt;ref name=zengyi93 /&gt; These national averages over time, mask the regional sex ratio data. For example, in some provinces such as [[Anhui]], [[Jiangxi]], [[Shaanxi]], [[Hunan]] and [[Guangdong]], sex ratio at birth is more than 130.&lt;ref&gt;Tania Branigan, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/02/chinas-great-gender-crisis China's Great Gender Crisis] The Guardian, UK, 2 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hesketh /&gt;

Traditional Chinese techniques have been used to determine sex for hundreds of years, primarily with unknown accuracy. It was not until [[ultrasonography]] became widely available in urban and rural China that sex was able to be determined scientifically. In 1986, the Ministry of Health posted the Notice on Forbidding Prenatal Sex Determination, but it was not widely followed.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Health and State Family Planning Commission.1986. "Notice on strictly forbidding prenatal sex determination," reprinted in Peng Peiyun(ed.), 1997, Family Planning Encyclopedia of China. Beijing: China Population Press, p. 939.&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, the Ministry of Health outlawed the use of sex determination techniques, except for in diagnosing hereditary diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Health. 1989. "Urgent notice on strictly forbidding the use of medical technology to perform prenatal sex determination," reprinted in Peng Peiyun (ed.), 1997, Family Planning Encyclopedia of China. Beijing: China Population Press, pp. 959-960.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many people have personal connections to medical practitioners and strong [[son preference]] still dominates culture, leading to the widespread use of sex determination techniques.&lt;ref name=Junhong /&gt; According to Hardy, Gu, and Xie (2000), ultrasound has spread to all areas of China, as evidenced by the spread of the high sex ratio throughout the country.&lt;ref name=Xie&gt;Hardee, Karen, Gu Baochang, and Xie Zhenming. 2000. "Holding up more than half the sky:Fertility control and women's empowerment in China,"paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the Population Association of America, 23–25 March, Los Angeles.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardy, Gu, and Xie suggest sex-selective abortion is more prevalent in rural China because son preference is much stronger there.&lt;ref name=Xie /&gt; Urban areas of China, on average, are moving toward greater equality for both sexes, while rural China tends to follow more traditional views of gender. This is partially due to the belief that, while sons are always part of the family, daughters are only temporary, going to a new family when they marry. Additionally, if a woman's firstborn child is a son, her position in society moves up, while the same is not true of a firstborn daughter.&lt;ref name= Junhong /&gt;

In the past, desire for a son was manifested by large birth rates—many couples would continue to have children until they had a son.&lt;ref name=Junhong /&gt; However, the combination of financial concerns and, more importantly, the One-child policy (discussed further below) have led to an increase in gender planning and selection. Even in rural areas, most women know that ultrasonography can be used for gender discernment. For each subsequent birth, Junhong found that women are over 10% more likely to have an ultrasound (39% for firstborn, 55% for second born, 67% for third born). Additionally, he found that the sex of the firstborn child impacts whether a woman will have an ultrasound in her subsequent pregnancies: 40% of women with a firstborn son have an ultrasound for their second born child, versus 70% of women with firstborn daughters. This points to a strong desire to select for a son if one has not been born yet.&lt;ref name=Junhong /&gt;

[[File:Sex ratio at birth in mainland China.png|thumb|450px|Birth sex ratios have dramatically changed in China since the implementation of the [[One-Child Policy]].]]
Because of the lack of data about childbirth, a number of researchers have worked to learn about abortion statistics in China. One of the earliest studies by Qui (1987) found that according to cultural belief, fetuses are not thought of as human beings until they are born, leading to a cultural preference for abortion over infanticide.&lt;ref&gt;Qiu Renzong. 1987. Life Ethics Shanghai:ShanghaiPeople'sPress&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, [[infanticide]] and infant abandonment are rather rare in China today.&lt;ref name= Junhong /&gt; Instead, Junhong found that roughly 27% of women have an abortion. Additionally, he found that if a family's firstborn was a girl, 92% of known female would-be second born fetuses were aborted.&lt;ref&gt;Junhong, Chu. 2000. "Study on the quality of the family planning program in China,"paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the Population Association of America, 23–25 March, Los Angeles.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2005 study, Zhu, Lu, and Hesketh found that the highest sex ratio was for those ages 1–4, and two provinces, Tibet and Xinjiang, had sex ratios within normal limits. Two other provinces had a ratio over 140, four had ratios between 130-139, and seven had ratios between 120-129, each of which is significantly higher than the natural sex ratio.&lt;ref name=Hesketh&gt;Zhu, W., L. Lu, and T Hesketh. "China’s Excess Males, Sex Selective Abortion, and One Child Policy: Analysis of Data from 2005 National Intercensus Survey."] British Medical Journal (2009): n. pag.{{jstor|20512658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variance in the one child policy has led to three types of provinces. Zhu et al. call Type 1, the most restrictive, policy where 40% of couples are permitted to have a second child but generally only if the first is a girl. In Type 2 provinces, any couple is permitted to have a second child if the first born is a girl or if the parents petition “hardship” and the petition is accepted by local officials. Type 3 provinces, typically sparsely populated, allow couples a second child and sometimes a third, irrespective of sex. Zhu et al. find that Type 2 provinces have the highest birth sex ratios, as seen in [[Henan]], [[Anhui]], [[Jiangxi]], [[Hunan]], [[Guangdong]], and [[Hainan]].&lt;ref name=Hesketh /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Winckler | first1 = Edwin A | year = 2002 | title = Chinese Reproductive Policy at the Turn of the Millennium: Dynamic Stability | url = | journal = Population and Development Review | volume = 28 | issue = 3| pages = 379–418 | doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2002.00379.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The child sex ratio in India shows a regional pattern. India's 2011 census found that all eastern and southern states of India had a child sex ratio between 103 and 107,&lt;ref name=cc2011 /&gt; typically considered as the “natural ratio.” The highest sex ratios were observed in India's northern and northwestern states – [[Haryana]] (120), [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] (118) and [[Jammu &amp; Kashmir]] (116).&lt;ref name=ci20012011&gt;[http://censusindia.gov.in/2011-prov-results/data_files/india/s13_sex_ratio.pdf Child Sex Ratio 2001 versus 2011] Census of India, Government of India (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The western states of Maharashtra and Rajasthan 2011 census found a child sex ratio of 113, Gujarat at 112 and Uttar Pradesh at 111.&lt;ref name=ci20012011 /&gt;

The Indian census data suggests there is a positive correlation between abnormal sex ratio and better socio-economic status and literacy. Urban India has higher child sex ratio than rural India according to 1991, 2001 and 2011 Census data, implying higher prevalence of sex selective abortion in urban India. Similarly, child sex ratio greater than 115 boys per 100 girls is found in regions where the predominant majority is Hindu, Muslim, Sikh or Christian; furthermore "normal" child sex ratio of 104 to 106 boys per 100 girls are also found in regions where the predominant majority is Hindu, Muslim, Sikh or Christian. These data contradict any hypotheses that may suggest that sex selection is an archaic practice which takes place among uneducated, poor sections or particular religion of the Indian society.&lt;ref name=cc2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=wbhindia /&gt;

Rutherford and Roy, in their 2003 paper, suggest that techniques for determining sex prenatally that were pioneered in the 1970s, gained popularity in India.&lt;ref&gt;Rutherford, R., and T. K. Roy. "Factors Affecting Sex-selective Abortion in Indian and 17 Major States." International Institute for Population Sciences and Honolulu: East-West Center (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; These techniques, claim Rutherford and Roy, became broadly available in 17 of 29 Indian states by the early 2000s. Such prenatal sex determination techniques, claim Sudha and Rajan in a 1999 report, where available, favored male births.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sudha | first1 = S. | last2 = Rajan | first2 = S.

Arnold, Kishor, and Roy, in their 2002 paper, too hypothesize that modern fetal sex screening techniques have skewed child sex ratios in India.&lt;ref name=Arnold&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arnold | first1 = Fred | last2 = Kishor | first2 = Sunita | last3 = Roy | first3 = T.

"Abortion research in India: What we know, and what we need to know," in Radhika Ramasubban and Shireen J. Jejeebhoy (eds.), Women's Reproductive Health in India. New Delhi: Rawat Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mevlude Akbulut-Yuksel and Daniel Rosenblum, in their 2012 paper, find that despite numerous publications and studies, there is limited formal evidence on the effects of the continued spread of ultrasound technology on missing women in India. They conclude, contrary to common belief, that the recent rapid spread of ultrasound in India, from the 1990s through 2000s, did not cause a concomitant rise in sex-selection and prenatal female abortion.&lt;ref name=maydrgermany&gt;Mevlude Akbulut-Yuksel and Daniel Rosenblum (January 2012), [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1989245 The Indian Ultrasound Paradox], IZA DP No. 6273, Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit, Bonn, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian government and various advocacy groups have continued the debate and discussion about ways to prevent sex selection. The immorality of prenatal sex selection has been questioned, with some arguments in favor of prenatal discrimination as more humane than postnatal discrimination by a family that does not want a female child. Others question whether the morality of sex selective abortion is any different over morality of abortion when there is no risk to the mother nor to the fetus, and abortion is used as a means to end an unwanted pregnancy?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kumar | first1 = Dharma | year = 1983 | title = Male utopias or nightmares? | url = | journal = Economic and Political Weekly | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 61–64 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gangoli | first1 = Geetanjali | year = 1998 | title = Reproduction, abortion and women's health | url = | journal = Social Scientist | volume = 26 | issue = 11–12| pages = 83–105 | doi=10.2307/3517661| jstor = 3517661 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goodkind | first1 = Daniel | year = 1996 | title = On substituting sex preference strategies in East Asia: Does pre-natal sex selection reduce post natal discrimination? | url = | journal = Population and Development Review | volume = 22 | issue = 1| pages = 111–125 | doi=10.2307/2137689| jstor = 2137689 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

India passed its first abortion-related law, the so-called Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act of 1971, making abortion legal in most states, but specified legally acceptable reasons for abortion such as medical risk to mother and rape. The law also established physicians who can legally provide the procedure and the facilities where abortions can be performed, but did not anticipate sex selective abortion based on technology advances.&lt;ref&gt;"Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act 1971 – Introduction." Health News RSS. Med India, n.d. Web. 20 Oct. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

With increasing availability of sex screening technologies in India through the 1980s in urban India, and claims of its misuse, the Government of India passed the [[Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act, 1994|Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques Act (PNDT)]] in 1994. This law was further amended into the Pre-Conception and Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation and Prevention of Misuse) (PCPNDT) Act in 2004 to deter and punish prenatal sex screening and sex selective abortion. The impact of the law and its enforcement is unclear. [[United Nations Population Fund]] and India's National Human Rights Commission, in 2009, asked the Government of India to assess the impact of the law. The Public Health Foundation of India, an activist NGO in its 2010 report, claimed a lack of awareness about the Act in parts of India, inactive role of the Appropriate Authorities, ambiguity among some clinics that offer prenatal care services, and the role of a few medical practitioners in disregarding the law.&lt;ref name=wbhindia /&gt;

The [[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare]] of India has targeted education and media advertisements to reach clinics and medical professionals to increase awareness. The Indian Medical Association has undertaken efforts to prevent prenatal sex selection by giving its members ''Beti Bachao'' (save the daughter) badges during its meetings and conferences.&lt;ref name=wbhindia /&gt;

In November 2007, MacPherson estimated that 100,000 abortions every year continue to be performed in India solely because the fetus is female.&lt;ref name=macpherson /&gt;

Abnormal sex ratios at birth, possibly explained by growing incidence of sex-selective abortion, have also been noted in some other countries outside South and East Asia. According to the 2011 CIA estimates, countries with more than 110 males per 100 females at birth also include [[Albania]] and former Soviet republics of [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]].

For 2005–10 birth data, the sex ratio in Armenia is seen to be a function of birth order. Among couples having their first child, Armenia averages 138 boys for every 100 girls every year. If the first child is a son, the sex ratio of the second child of Armenian couple averages to be 85. If the first child is a daughter, the sex ratio of the second Armenian child averages to be 156 boys for 100 girls. Overall, the birth sex ratio for in Armenia exceeds 115, far higher than India's 108, claim scholars.&lt;ref name=teconomist /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael, M; King, L; Guo, L; McKee, M; Richardson, E; Stuckler, D (2013), [http://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/1130041/1/3909713.pdf The mystery of missing female children in the Caucasus: an analysis of sex ratios by birth order], International perspectives on sexual and reproductive health, 39 (2), pp. 97-102, ISSN 1944-0391&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="John Bongaarts 2013 pages 185"&gt;John Bongaarts (2013), The Implementation of Preferences for Male Offspring, Population and Development Review, Volume 39, Issue 2, pages 185–208, June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; While these high birth sex ratios suggest sex-selective abortion, there is no direct evidence of observed large-scale sex-selective abortions in Caucasus.&lt;ref name=fmesle /&gt;

An imbalanced birth sex ratio has been present in the 21st century in the [[Western Balkans]], in  countries such as [[Albania]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Kosovo]] and [[Montenegro]]. As of 2016, according to CIA estimates, Albania has one the highest birth sex imbalances in the world, at 110.&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt; According to Eurostat and birth record data over 2008–11, the birth sex ratios of Albania and Montenegro for that period were 112 and 110 respectively.&lt;ref name=unfpaaugust2012&gt;[http://www.unfpa.org/webdav/site/global/shared/documents/publications/2012/Sex%20Imbalances%20at%20Birth.%20PDF%20UNFPA%20APRO%20publication%202012.pdf Sex Imbalances at Birth: Current trends, consequences and policy implications] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230232549/http://www.unfpa.org/webdav/site/global/shared/documents/publications/2012/Sex%20Imbalances%20at%20Birth.%20PDF%20UNFPA%20APRO%20publication%202012.pdf |date=December 30, 2013 }} United Nations FPA (August 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the birth registration data for Macedonia and Kosovo indicate birth sex ratios above 108; for example, in 2011 the birth sex ratio was 108 in Macedonia, while in 2010 the birth sex ratio for Kosovo was 112.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unfpa.org/webdav/site/global/shared/documents/publications/2012/Sex%20Imbalances%20at%20Birth.%20PDF%20UNFPA%20APRO%20publication%202012.pdf Sex Imbalances at Birth: Current trends, consequences and policy implications] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230232549/http://www.unfpa.org/webdav/site/global/shared/documents/publications/2012/Sex%20Imbalances%20at%20Birth.%20PDF%20UNFPA%20APRO%20publication%202012.pdf |date=December 30, 2013 }} United Nations FPA (August 2012), see page 23&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, Montenegrin health authorities have expressed concern with regard to the significant imbalance between the number of male and female births.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/gender-selection-raises-concerns-in-montenegro&lt;/ref&gt;
Scholars claim this suggests that sex-selective abortions are becoming common in southeast Europe.&lt;ref name=czgparis&gt;[http://www.demographie.net/guilmoto/pdf/research%20note%20on%20BM%20in%20SE%20Europe4.pdf HIGH SEX RATIO AT BIRTH IN SOUTHEAST EUROPE] Christophe Z Guilmoto, CEPED, Université Paris-Descartes, France (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stump, Doris (2011), [http://www.assembly.coe.int/CommitteeDocs/2011/ASEGAselectionprenatalee.pdf Prenatal Sex Selection], Committee on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men, Council of Europe&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Verropoulou and Tsimbos (2010), ''Journal of Biosocial Science'', vol. 42, No. 3, pp. 425-430.&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States ==
Like in other countries, sex-selective abortion is difficult to track in the United States because of lack of data.

While the majority of parents in United States do not practice sex-selective abortion, there is certainly a trend toward male preference. According to a 2011 [[Gallup poll]], if they were only allowed to have one child, 40% of respondents said they would prefer a boy, while only 28% preferred a girl.&lt;ref&gt;Newport, Frank. "Americans Prefer Boys to Girls, Just as They Did in 1941." Gallup, 23 June 2011. Web. 2 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; When told about prenatal sex selection techniques such as sperm sorting and in vitro fertilization embryo selection, 40% of Americans surveyed thought that picking embryos by sex was an acceptable manifestation of reproductive rights.&lt;ref name=Jesudason&gt;Jesudason, Sujatha, and Anat Shenker-Osorio. "The Atlantic." The Atlantic. N.p., 31 May 2012. Web. 03 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; These selecting techniques are available at about half of American fertility clinics, as of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;"Half Fertility Clinics Allow Parents to Pick Gender." Msnbc.com. Associated Press, 20 Sept. 2006. Web. 03 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is notable that minority groups that immigrate into the United States bring their cultural views and mindsets into the country with them. A study carried out at a Massachusetts infertility clinic shows that the majority of couples using these techniques, such as [[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] came from a Chinese or Asian background. This is thought to branch from the social importance of giving birth to male children in China and other Asian countries.&lt;ref&gt;Savior Siblings: Is PGD Being Regulated?. (2009, June 29). Savior Siblings. Retrieved September 23, 2013, from http://ourethicaljourney09.blogspot.ca/2009/06/is-big-brother-watching-pgd-regulations.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of the 2000 United States Census suggests possible male bias in families of Chinese, Korean and Indian immigrants, which was getting increasingly stronger in families where first one or two children were female. In those families where the first two children were girls, the birth sex ratio of the third child was 151.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/15/nyregion/15babies.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;hp|title=U.S. Births Hint at Bias for Boys in Some Asians | work=The New York Times | first=Sam | last=Roberts | date=June 15, 2009 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of this movement toward sex preference and selection, many bans on sex-selective abortion have been proposed at the state and federal level. In 2010 and 2011, sex-selective abortions were banned in [[Oklahoma]] and [[Arizona]], respectively. Legislators in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[West Virginia]], [[Michigan]], [[Minnesota]], [[New Jersey]], and [[New York (state)|New York]] have also tried to pass acts banning the procedure.&lt;ref name=Jesudason /&gt;

== Other countries ==
A 2013 study&lt;ref name="John Bongaarts 2013 pages 185" /&gt; by [[John Bongaarts]] based on surveys in 61 major countries calculates the sex ratios that would result if parents had the number of sons and daughters they want. In 35 countries, claims Bongaarts, the desired birth sex ratio in respective countries would be more than 110 boys for every 100 girls if parents in these countries had a child matching their preferred gender (higher than India's, which The Economist claims is 108).&lt;ref name=teconomist /&gt;

== Estimates of missing women ==
Estimates of implied missing girls, considering the "normal" birth sex ratio to be the 103–107 range, vary considerably between researchers and underlying assumptions for expected post-birth mortality rates for men and women. For example, a 2005 study estimated that over 90 million females were "missing" from the expected population in [[Afghanistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[South Korea]] and [[Taiwan]] alone, and suggested that sex-selective abortion plays a role in this deficit.&lt;ref name="Gettis" /&gt;&lt;ref name=hudsonboer&gt;VALERIE M. HUDSON and ANDREA M. DEN BOER [http://kar.kent.ac.uk/11409/1/WW-missingwomen-05.pdf Missing Women and Bare Branches: Gender Balance and Conflict] ECSP Report, Issue 11&lt;/ref&gt; For early 1990s, Sen estimated 107 million missing women, Coale estimated 60 million as missing, while Klasen estimated 89 million missing women in China, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, [[West Asia]] and [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name= KlausenWink /&gt; Guilmoto,&lt;ref name=czg /&gt; in his 2010 report, uses recent data (except for Pakistan), and estimates a much lower number of missing girls, but notes that the higher sex ratios in numerous countries have created a gender gap – shortage of girls – in the 0–19 age group.

== Disparate gendered access to resources ==
Although there is significant evidence of the prevalence of sex-selective abortions in many nations (especially India and China), there is also evidence to suggest that some of the variation in global sex ratios is due to disparate access to resources. As MacPherson (2007) notes, there can be significant differences in gender violence and access to food, healthcare, immunizations between male and female children. This leads to high infant and childhood mortality among girls, which causes changes in sex ratio.&lt;ref name=macpherson /&gt;

Disparate, gendered access to resources appears to be strongly linked to socioeconomic status. Specifically, poorer families are sometimes forced to ration food, with daughters typically receiving less priority than sons (Klasen and Wink 2003).&lt;ref name= KlausenWink /&gt; However, Klasen's 2001 study revealed that this practice is less common in the poorest families, but rises dramatically in the slightly less poor families.&lt;ref name= KlausenWink /&gt; Klasen and Wink's 2003 study suggests that this is "related to greater female economic independence and fewer cultural strictures among the poorest sections of the population". In other words, the poorest families are typically less bound by cultural expectations and norms, and women tend to have more freedom to become family breadwinners out of necessity.&lt;ref name= KlausenWink /&gt;

Increased sex ratios can be caused by disparities in aspects of life other than vital resources. According to Sen (1990), differences in wages and job advancement also have a dramatic effect on sex ratios. This is why high sex ratios are sometimes seen in nations with little sex-selective abortion.&lt;ref name= Sen1990 /&gt; Additionally, high female education rates are correlated with lower sex ratios (World Bank 2011).&lt;ref&gt;World Bank, Engendering Development, The World Bank, (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Lopez and Ruzikah (1983) found that, when given the same resources, women tend to outlive men at all stages of life after infancy. However, globally, resources are not always allocated equitably. Thus, some scholars argue that disparities in access to resources such as healthcare, education, and nutrition play at least a small role in the high sex ratios seen in some parts of the world (Klasen and Wink 2003). For example, Alderman and Gerter (1997) found that unequal access to healthcare is a primary cause of female death in developing nations, especially in Southeast Asia. Moreover, in India, lack of equal access to healthcare has led to increased disease and higher rates of female mortality in every age group until the late thirties (Sen 1990). This is particularly noteworthy because, in regions of the world where women receive equal resources, women tend to outlive men (Sen 1990). Women outlive men in all but 2 countries.&lt;ref&gt;Austad, Steven N. Fischer, Kathleen E. "Sex Differences in Lifespan." Cell Metabolism 23, June 14, 2016 https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2016.05.019. pages 1026-1028&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic disadvantage alone may not always lead to increased sex ratio, claimed Sen in 1990. For example, in sub-Saharan Africa, one of the most economically disadvantaged regions of the world, there is an excess of women. So, if economic disadvantage is uncorrelated with sex ratio in Africa, some other factor(s) may be at play.&lt;ref name= Sen1990 /&gt; More detailed analysis of African demographics, in 2002, suggests that Africa too has wide variation in birth sex ratios (from 1.01 in Bantu populations of East Africa to 1.08 in Nigeria and Ethiopia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garenne | first1 = M | year = 2002 | title = Sex ratios at birth in African populations: a review of survey data | url = | journal = Human Biology | volume = 74 | issue = 6| pages = 889–900 | pmid = 12617497 | doi=10.1353/hub.2003.0003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus economic disadvantage remains a possible unresolved hypothesis for Africa as well.

== Reasons for sex-selective abortion ==
Various theories have been proposed as possible reasons for sex-selective abortion. Culture rather than economic conditions is favored by some researchers because such deviations in sex ratios do not exist in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], [[Latin America]], and the [[Caribbean]].&lt;ref name="Gettis" /&gt; Other hypotheses include disparate gender-biased access to resources,&lt;ref name=macpherson /&gt; and attempts to control population growth such as using one child policy.&lt;ref name=Hesketh /&gt;

Some demographers question whether sex-selective abortion or infanticide claims are accurate, because underreporting of female births may also explain high sex ratios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.2307/1972351 | title=The missing girls of China: a new demographic account | last=Johansson | first=Sten | last2=Nygren | jstor=1972351 | first2=Olga | year=1991 | volume=17 | issue=1 | journal = Population and Development Review | pages=35–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Are births underreported in rural China? | first=M.

=== Cultural preference ===

[[File:Infanticide-ganges.jpg|thumb|200px|Infanticide committed by throwing an infant into the [[Ganges river]].]]
The reason for intensifying sex-selection abortion in China and India can be seen through history and cultural background. Generally, before the [[information era]], male babies were preferred because they provided manual labor and continuation of the family [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]]. Labor is still important in developing nations as China and India, but when it comes to family lineage, it is of great importance.

The selective abortion of female fetuses is most common in areas where cultural norms value male children over female children for a variety of social and economic reasons.&lt;ref name="Goodkind" /&gt; A son is often preferred as an "asset" since he can earn and support the family; a daughter is a "liability" since she will be married off to another family, and so will not contribute financially to her parents. Sex selective female abortion is a continuation, in a different form, of a practice of [[female infanticide]] or withholding of postnatal health care for girls in certain households.&lt;ref name="Gupta_2005"&gt;Das Gupta, Monica, "Explaining Asia's Missing Women": A New Look at the Data", 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in some cultures sons are expected to take care of their parents in their old age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mahalingam | first1 = R. | title = Culture, ecology, and beliefs about gender in son preference caste groups | doi = 10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2007.01.004 | journal = Evolution and Human Behavior | volume = 28 | issue = 5 | pages = 319–329 | year = 2007 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors are complicated by the effect of diseases on child sex ratio, where communicable and noncommunicable diseases affect males and females differently.&lt;ref name="Gupta_2005" /&gt; In parts of India and Pakistan, there are social norms such as [[purdah]], which stipulate that female seclusion and confinement to the home is necessary. Such practices are prevalent among some Muslim and Hindu communities in South Asia. When females interact with men, or are believed to do so, the "[[family honor]]" is tarnished.

Historically, in many South Asian populations, women were allocated a very low status, evidenced through practices such as [[Sati (practice)|sati]], an ancient funeral custom where a [[widow]] immolated herself on her husband's [[pyre]] or committed [[suicide]] in another fashion shortly after her husband's death.&lt;ref&gt;Sophie Gilmartin (1997), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25058378 The Sati, the Bride, and the Widow: Sacrificial Woman in the Nineteenth Century], Victorian Literature and Culture, Cambridge University Press, Vol. 25, No. 1, page 141, '''Quote: Suttee, or sati, is the obsolete Hindu practice in which a widow burns herself upon her husband's funeral pyre...'''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Arvind Sharma]] (2001), Sati: Historical and Phenomenological Essays, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120804647}}, pages 19-21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=julialeslie&gt;On attested Rajput practice of sati during wars, see, for example {{cite book|last1=Leslie |first1=Julia|chapter=Suttee or Sati: Victim or Victor?|page=46|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vPdYkFguJ8IC&amp;pg=PA46|title=Institutions and Ideologies: A SOAS South Asia Reader|year=1993|last2=Arnold|first2=David (ed.)|last3=Robb|first3=Peter (ed.)|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780700702848|volume=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such societies, in placing almost no value on females, encouraged parents to commit [[infanticide]] of girls or to abandon them. The modern practice of sex-selective abortion is therefore a continuation of other historical practices. During the 19th century, in the Northwest [[British raj|British India]], one-fourth of the population preserved only half the daughters, while other 3/4th of the population had balanced sex ratio. There were 118 males per 100 females. This is comparable to the contemporary sex ratio in the area, now divided between India and Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Child Survival: Anthropological Perspectives on the Treatment and Maltreatment of Children|last = Hughes|first = Nancy Scheper|publisher = Springer|isbn = 9781556080289|year = 1987|page = 99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chinese culture]] is deeply patriarchal. Pre-modern Chinese society was predominantly patriarchal and patrilineal from at least the 11th century BCE onwards.{{sfnp|Wu|2009|p=86}} There has long been a son preference in China, leading to high rates of female infanticide, as well as a strong tradition of restricting the [[freedom of movement]] of women, particularly upper class women, manifested through the practice of [[foot binding]]. Although the legal and social standing of women have greatly improved in the 20th century, son preference remains still strong, and the situation was aggravated by the [[one child policy]].

Interpretations of [[Confucianism]] have been argued to contribute to the low status of women. The gender roles prescribed in the [[Three Obediences and Four Virtues]] became a cornerstone of the family, and thus, societal stability. Starting from the Han period, Confucians began to teach that a virtuous woman was supposed to follow the males in her family: the father before her marriage, the husband after she marries, and her sons in widowhood. In the later dynasties, more emphasis was placed on the virtue of chastity. The Song dynasty Confucian [[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]] stated that: "To starve to death is a small matter, but to lose one's chastity is a great matter."&lt;ref name="ebrey"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GDPskRXfl5cC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Women and the Family in Chinese History|author= Patricia Buckley Ebrey |pages=10&amp;ndash;12|publisher=Routledge |date=19 September 2002 |isbn= 978-0415288224}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "cult of chastity" accordingly, condemned many widows to poverty and loneliness by placing a social stigma on remarriage.&lt;ref name=Adler&gt;{{cite web | last = Adler | first = Joseph A. | title = Daughter/Wife/Mother or Sage/Immortal/Bodhisattva?

In modern East Asia, a large part of the pattern of preferences leading to this practice can be condensed simply as a desire to have a male heir. Monica Das Gupta (2005) observes, from 1989 birth data for China, there was no evidence of selective abortion of female fetuses among firstborn children. However, there was a strong preference for a boy if the first born was a girl.&lt;ref name="Gupta_2005" /&gt;

===Dowry===
[[File:Say no to dowry.jpg|thumb|A social awareness campaign in India against dowries.]]
{{See|Dowry system in India}}
[[File:India - Delhi wedding - 5438.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Wedding gifts for  the son of the Imam of Delhi, India, with soldiers and 2000 guests. Large dowries are expected among several populations in South Asia, especially in India and Pakistan.]]
[[Dowry]] is the property that parents of a female transfer at her marriage. Dowry is an ancient practice, that has been common in many cultures around the world, and which is today prevalent especially in South Asia. The custom of dowry is most common in cultures that are strongly [[patrilineal]] and that expect women to reside with or near their husband's family ([[patrilocality]]).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/dowry&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirti Singh states that dowry is widely considered to be both a cause and a consequence of son preference, and this may lead to girls being unwanted, sex selective abortion, [[female infanticide]] or abuse of female children.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20140313094849/http://india.unfpa.org/drive/LawsandSonPreferenceinIndia.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[dowry system in India]] is a major part of [[Indian culture]] and refers to the durable goods, cash, and real or movable property that the bride's family gives to the bridegroom, his parents, or his relatives as a condition of the marriage.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Dowry Deaths and Access to Justice in Kali's Yug: Empowerment, Law and Dowry Deaths|last = Rani Jethmalani &amp; P.K.

=== One-child policy ===
[[File:Danshan Nongguang Village Bulletin board.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[one child policy]] in [[China]] has contributed to the imbalanced sex ratios. Image shows a community bulletin board in Nonguang Village, [[Sichuan province]], China, keeping track of the town's female population, listing recent births by name and noting that several thousand yuan of fines for unauthorized births remain unpaid from the previous year.]]
Following the 1949 creation of the People's Republic of China, the issue of population control came into the national spotlight. In the early years of the Republic, leaders believed that telling citizens to reduce their fertility was enough, repealing laws banning [[contraception]] and instead promoting its use. However, the contraceptives were not widely available, both because of lack of supply and because of cultural taboo against discussing sex. Efforts were slowed following the famine of 1959–61 but were resumed shortly thereafter with virtually the same results. Then, in 1964, the Family Planning Office was established to enforce stricter guidelines regarding fertility and it was moderately successful.&lt;ref&gt;Henneberger, S. "China's One-Child Policy." : History. N.p., 2007. Web. 24 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, the government adopted the [[One-Child Policy]], which limited many families to one child, unless specified by provincial regulations. It was instituted as an attempt to boost the Chinese economy. Under it, families who break rules regarding the number of children they are allowed are given various punishments (primarily monetary), dependent upon the province in which they live.&lt;ref&gt;"History of the One-Child Policy." All Girls Allowed, 2013. Web. 25 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

As stated above, the sex ratios of a province are largely determined by the type of restriction placed upon the family, pointing to the conclusion that much of the imbalance in sex ratio in China can be attributed to the policy. Research by Junhong (2001) found that many parents are willing to pay to ensure that their child is male (especially if their first child is female), but will not do the same to ensure their child is female.&lt;ref name=Junhong /&gt; Likely, fear of the harsh monetary punishments of the One-Child Policy make ensuring a son's birth a smart investment. Therefore, son's cultural and economic importance to families and the large expenses associated with multiple children are primary factors leading to China's disparate sex ratio.

In 2013, China announced plans to formally change the One-Child policy, making it less stringent. The National People's Congress has changed the policy to allow couples to have two children, so long as one of the partners is an only child. This change was not sparked by sex ratios, but rather by an aging population that is causing the workforce to become increasingly smaller. It is estimated that this new law will lead to two million more births per year and could cause a baby boom in China. In 2015, China officially relaxed its one child law.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-38714949&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, many of China's social problems are based on overpopulation. So, it is unclear if this new law will actually lead to women being more valued in Chinese society as the number of citizens increases.&lt;ref&gt;"China’s one-child policy to change in the new year."

=== Trivers–Willard hypothesis ===
The [[Trivers–Willard hypothesis]] argues that available resources affect male [[reproductive success]] more than female and that consequently parents should prefer males when resources are plentiful and females when resources are scarce. This has been applied to resource differences between individuals in a society and also to resource differences between societies. Empirical evidence is mixed with higher support in better studies according to Cronk in a 2007 review. One example, in a 1997 study, of a group with a preference for females was [[Romani people|Romani]] in [[Hungary]], a low status group. They "had a female-biased sex ratio at birth, were more likely to abort a fetus after having had one or more daughters, nursed their daughters longer, and sent their daughters to school for longer."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cronk | first1 = L. | doi = 10.1016/S1472-6483(10)60546-9 | title = Boy or girl: Gender preferences from a Darwinian point of view | journal = Reproductive BioMedicine Online | volume = 15 | pages = 23–32 | year = 2007 | pmid =  18088517| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Societal effects ==

=== Missing women ===
{{Main|Missing women}}
The idea of “missing women” was first suggested by Amartya Sen, one of the first scholars to study high sex ratios and their causes globally, in 1990. In order to illustrate the gravity of the situation, he calculated the number of women that were not alive because of sex-selective abortion or discriminatory practices. He found that there were 11 percent fewer women than there “should” have been, if China had the natural sex ratio. This figure, when combined with statistics from around the world, led to a finding of over 100 million missing women. In other words, by the early 1990s, the number of missing women was “larger than the combined casualties of all famines in the twentieth century” (Sen 1990).&lt;ref name= Sen1990 /&gt;

This has led to particular concern due to a critical shortage of wives. In some rural areas, there is already a shortage of women, which is tied to migration into urban areas (Park and Cho 1995).&lt;ref name= ParkCho&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Park | first1 = Chai Bin | last2 = Cho | first2 = Nam-Hoon | year = 1995 | title = Consequences of son preference in a low- fertility society:Imbalance of the sex ratio at birth in Korea | url = | journal = Population and Development Review | volume = 21 | issue = 1| pages = 59–84 | doi=10.2307/2137413}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[South Korea]] and [[Taiwan]], high male sex ratios and declining birth rates over several decades have led to cross-cultural marriage between local men and foreign women from countries such as mainland China, Vietnam and the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/22/world/asia/22brides.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Norimitsu | last=Onishi | title=Korean Men Use Brokers to Find Brides in Vietnam | date=February 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, sex-selective abortion is not the only cause of this phenomenon; it is also related to migration and declining fertility.&lt;ref name= ParkCho /&gt;

=== Trafficking, forced marriage and sex work ===
Some scholars argue that as the proportion of women to men decreases globally, there will be an increase in [[Human trafficking|trafficking]] and sex work (both forced and self-elected), as many men will be willing to do more to obtain a sexual partner (Junhong 2001).&lt;ref name= Junhong /&gt; Already, there are reports of women from [[Vietnam]], [[Myanmar]], and [[North Korea]] systematically trafficked to mainland [[China]] and [[Taiwan]] and sold into [[forced marriage]]s.&lt;ref name="Hvistendahl_WSJ"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303657404576361691165631366 |title=The War Against Girls | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Jonathan V.|last=Last|date=June 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Ullman and Fidell (1989) suggested that pornography and sex-related crimes of violence (i.e., rape and molestation) would also increase with an increasing sex ratio.&lt;ref&gt;Ullman, Jodie and Linda Fidell. 1989. "Gender selection and society," " in Joan Offerman- Zuckerberg (ed.), Gender in Transition: A New Frontier. New York: Plenum Medical Book
Company, pp. 179-187.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Widening of the gender social gap ===
As Park and Cho (1995) note, families in areas with high sex ratios that have mostly sons tend to be smaller than those with mostly daughters (because the families with mostly sons appear to have used sex-selective techniques to achieve their “ideal” composition).&lt;ref name= ParkCho /&gt; Particularly in poor areas, large families tend to have more problems with resource allocation, with daughters often receiving fewer resources than sons.&lt;ref name=ParkCho /&gt; Blake (1989) is credited for noting the relationship between family size and childhood “quality.” Therefore, if families with daughters continue to be predominantly large, it is likely that the social gap between genders will widen due to traditional cultural discrimination and lack of resource availability.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, Judith. 1989. Family Size and Achievement. Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Guttentag and Secord (1983) hypothesized that when the proportion of males throughout the world is greater, there is likely to be more violence and war.&lt;ref name= Guttentag&gt;Guttentag, M and P Secord. "Too Many Women? The Sex Ratio Question." Sage Publications. 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Potential positive effects ===
Some scholars believe that when sex ratios are high, women actually become valued more because of their relative shortage.&lt;ref name= ParkCho /&gt; Park and Cho (1995) suggest that as women become more scarce, they may have “increased value for conjugal and reproductive functions” (75). Eventually, this could lead to better social conditions, followed by the birth of more women and sex ratios moving back to natural levels.&lt;ref name= ParkCho /&gt; This claim is supported by the work of demographer Nathan Keifitz. Keifitz (1983) wrote that as women become fewer, their relative position in society will increase. However, to date, no data has supported this claim.&lt;ref&gt;Keifitz, Nathan. Foreword. In: Bennett NG, editor. Sex selection of children. New York: Academic Press; 1983. p. xi-xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested by Belanger (2002) that sex-selective abortion may have positive effects on the mother choosing to abort the female fetus. This is related to the historical duty of mothers to produce a son in order to carry on the family name. As previously mentioned, women gain status in society when they have a male child, but not when they have a female child. Oftentimes, bearing of a son leads to greater legitimacy and agency for the mother. In some regions of the world where son preference is especially strong, sonless women are treated as outcasts. In this way, sex-selective abortion is a way for women to select for male fetuses, helping secure greater family status.&lt;ref&gt;Belanger, Daniele. "Sex-selective abortions: short-term and long-term perspectives"] Reproductive Health Matters 10.19(2002): 194-197. {{jstor|3775793}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goodkind (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goodkind | first1 = Daniel | year = 1999 | title = Should prenatal sex selection be restricted? Ethical questions and their implications for research and policy | url = | journal = Population Studies | volume = 53 | issue = 1| pages = 49–61 | doi=10.1080/00324720308069}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that sex-selective abortion should not be banned purely because of its discriminatory nature. Instead, he argues, we must consider the overall lifetime possibilities of discrimination. In fact, it is possible that sex-selective abortion takes away much of the discrimination women would face later in life. Since families have the option of selecting for the fetal sex they desire, if they choose not to abort a female fetus, she is more likely to be valued later in life. In this way, sex-selective abortion may be a more humane alternative to infanticide, abandonment, or neglect. Goodkind (1999) poses an essential philosophical question, “if a ban were enacted against prenatal sex testing (or the use of abortion for sex-selective purposes), how many excess postnatal deaths would a society be willing to tolerate in lieu of whatever sex-selective abortions were avoided?”

== Sex-selective abortion in the context of abortion ==
MacPherson estimates that 100,000 sex-selective abortions every year continue to be performed in India.&lt;ref name=macpherson /&gt; For a contrasting perspective, in the United States with a population {{frac|1|4}}th of India, over 1.2 million abortions every year were performed between 1990 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s0101.pdf Abortions—Number and Rate by Race: 1990 to 2007] US Census Bureau, Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In [[England and Wales]] with a population {{frac|1|20}}th of India, over 189,000 abortions were performed in 2011, or a yearly rate of 17.5 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15–44.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/213386/Commentary1.pdf Abortion Statistics, England and Wales: 2011] Department of Health, UK Government (May 2012), page 3&lt;/ref&gt; The average for the [[European Union]] was 30 abortions per year per 1,000 women.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/6Q6jc7T6J?url=http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/Life-stages/sexual-and-reproductive-health/activities/abortion/facts-and-figures-about-abortion-in-the-european-region Facts and figures about abortion in the European Region] World Health Organization (2012), Summary Note 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scholars have noted the difficulty in reconciling the discriminatory nature of sex-selective abortion with the right of women to have control over their own bodies. This conflict manifests itself primarily when discussing laws about sex-selective abortion. Weiss (1995:205) writes: "The most obvious challenge sex-selective abortion represents for [[pro-choice]] feminists is the difficulty of reconciling a pro-choice position with moral objections one might have to sex selective abortion (especially since it has been used primarily on female fetuses), much less the advocacy of a law banning sex-selective abortion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weiss | first1 = Gail | year = 1995 | title = Sex-Selective Abortion: A Relational Approach |  jstor=3810465 | journal = Hypatia | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 202–217 | doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.1995.tb01360.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As a result, arguments both for and against sex-selective abortion are typically highly reflective of one's own personal beliefs about abortion in general. Warren (1985:104) argues that there is a difference between acting within one's rights and acting upon the most morally sound choice, implying that sex-selective abortion might be within rights but not morally sound. Warren also notes that, if we are to ever reverse the trend of sex-selective abortion and high sex ratios, we must work to change the patriarchy-based society which breeds the strong son preference.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Mary Ann. "Gendercide: The Implications of Sex-Selection." Rowman and Allenheld. 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws against sex-selective abortion, especially those that exist in some [[U.S. state]]s, are controversial, because it is not clear how they can be enforced, and [[pro-choice]] activists argue that such laws are brought by [[anti-abortion movement]] forces who are using this as a [[pretext]] to restrict women's access to safe and legal abortion and to harass doctors who perform abortions: [[NARAL]] states that "For many years, anti-choice lawmakers have tried to ban abortion using every possible reason  and excuse –including, now, on the grounds of purported concern about race or sex selection."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.prochoiceamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/4.-Race-and-Sex-Selection-Abortion-Bans-A-False-Solution-to-the-Real-Problems-of-Racism-and-Sexism.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; There is concern that such bans may put women who seek sex-selective abortions in danger because they may seek unsafe abortions, and that these bans do not address the root cause of sex-selective abortion, including the pregnant women's fear that they or their future daughters will suffer abuse, violence and stigmatization.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nwlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/prendafactsheet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International ===
The practice of prenatal sex selection has been condemned internationally. It is often seen as a result of discriminatory social views which consider females inferior to males. In 1994 over 180 states signed the Programme of Action of the [[International Conference on Population and Development]], agreeing to "eliminate all forms of discrimination against the girl child".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/webdav/site/global/shared/documents/publications/2011/Preventing_gender-biased_sex_selection.pdf|title=Preventing gender-biased sex selection|publisher=[[UNFPA]]|accessdate=November 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the resolution of [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|PACE]]'s Committee on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men condemned the practice of prenatal sex selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc11/EDOC12715.pdf|title=Prenatal sex selection|publisher=[[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|PACE]]|accessdate=November 1, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003133834/http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc11/EDOC12715.pdf|archivedate=October 3, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By country ===
Many nations have attempted to address sex-selective abortion rates through a combination of media campaigns and policy initiatives.

;Canada
In Canada, a group of MPs led by [[Mark Warawa]] are working on having the [[Canadian Parliament|Parliament]] pass a resolution condemning sex-selective pregnancy termination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Natasha|title=MP takes aim at sex selection|url=http://www.langleytimes.com/news/172874451.html|work=The Langley Times|accessdate=October 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Kennedy, [http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/03/26/mp-continues-push-for-sex-selection-abortions-vote-after-motion-rejected/ MP continues push for sex-selection abortions vote after motion rejected], Postmedia News, 2013-03-26&lt;/ref&gt;

;USA
The [[United States Congress]] has debated legislation that would outlaw the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/30/politics/house-abortion-gender/index.html | title=House debates abortion ban for sex of fetus | work=CNN Online | date=May 31, 2012 | accessdate=May 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation ultimately failed to pass in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/01/us/politics/house-rejects-bill-to-ban-sex-selective-abortions.html?_r=1 | title=House Rejects Bill to Ban Sex-Selective Abortions | work=New York Times | date=May 31, 2012 | accessdate=May 31, 2010 | first=Jennifer | last=Steinhauer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the state level, laws against sex-selective abortions have been passed in a number of U.S. states;&lt;ref name=christie20130529&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/29/arizona-abortion-ban-race-sex_n_3355493.html|title=Arizona Race And Sex-Selective Abortion Ban Draws ACLU Lawsuit|first=Bob|last=Christie|date=2013-05-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530172555/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/29/arizona-abortion-ban-race-sex_n_3355493.html|archivedate=May 30, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the law passed in [[Arizona]] in 2011 prohibits both sex-selective and race-selective abortion.&lt;ref name=christie20130529 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/50leg/1r/bills/hb2443p.pdf|title=HB 2443: An Act amending Title 13, Chapter 36, Arizona Revised Statutes, by adding section 13-3603.02; ....}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azleg.state.az.us/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/ars/13/03603-02.htm&amp;Title=13&amp;DocType=ARS|title=Arizona Revised Statutes, 13-3603.02.

;United Kingdom
The law on sex-selective abortion is unresolved in the United Kingdom. In order for an abortion to be legal, doctors need to show that continuing the pregnancy could threaten the physical or mental health of the mother. In a recent case, two doctors were caught on camera offering a sex-selective abortion but the Director of Public Prosecution deemed it not in the public interest to proceed with the prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/11208011/MPs-vote-to-make-sex-selection-abortion-illegal.html&lt;/ref&gt; Following this incidence, MPs voted 181 to 1 for a Bill put forward by [[Tessa Munt]] and 11 other MPs aiming to end confusion about the legality of this practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Burnham's MP Tessa Munt backs sex-selection abortion bill|url=http://www.thisisthewestcountry.co.uk/news/11644656.Burnham_s_MP_Tessa_Munt_backs_sex_selection_abortion_bill/|publisher=thewestcountry.co.uk|accessdate=5 January 2015|date=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK: Sex-Selective Abortions Voted Illegal By Parliament Members|issn=2204-3888|url=http://gender-selection.com.au/index.php/component/content/article/19-portfolio/dec-2014-1-1/39-jia-ge?Itemid=0|publisher=gender-selection.com.au|accessdate=5 January 2015|date=1 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105103146/http://gender-selection.com.au/index.php/component/content/article/19-portfolio/dec-2014-1-1/39-jia-ge?Itemid=0|archivedate=January 5, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organisations such as [[BPAS]] and [[abortion Rights (Organisation)|Abortion Rights]] have been lobbying for the decriminalisation of sex-selective abortions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement on sex-selective abortion|url=http://www.abortionrights.org.uk/statement-on-sex-selective-abortion|publisher=Abortion Rights|accessdate=9 December 2014|date=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement on sex-selective abortion|url=http://spikedonlinepodcasts.podbean.com/e/on-air-off-message-ann-furedi-on-sex-selective-abortion/|publisher=Spiked.com|accessdate=12 December 2014|date=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;China
China's government has increasingly recognized its role in a reduction of the national sex ratio. As a result, since 2005, it has sponsored a “boys and girls are equal campaign.”&lt;ref name=JianSong&gt;Song, Jian. 2009. "Rising sex ratio at birth in China: responses and effects of social policies." &lt;http://iussp2009.princeton.edu/papers/91145&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 2000, the Chinese government began the “Care for Girls” Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;"'Care For Girls' Gaining Momentum." 'Care For Girls' Gaining Momentum. China Daily, 07 Aug. 2004. Web. 03 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, several levels of government have been modified to protect the “political, economic, cultural, and social” rights of women.&lt;ref name= JianSong /&gt; Finally, the Chinese government has enacted policies and interventions to help reduce the sex ratio at birth. In 2005, sex-selective abortion was made illegal in China. This came in response to the ever-increasing sex ratio and a desire to try to detract from it and reach a more normal ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2005 | title = China Makes Sex-Selective Abortions a Crime | jstor=3776292| journal = Reproductive Health Matters | volume = 13 | issue = 25| page = 203 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sex ratio among firstborn children in urban areas from 2000 to 2005 didn't rise at all, so there is hope that this movement is taking hold across the nation.&lt;ref name=Junhong /&gt;

UNICEF and UNFPA have partnered with the Chinese government and grassroots-level women's groups such as All China Women's Federation to promote gender equality in policy and practice, as well engage various social campaigns to help lower birth sex ratio and to reduce excess female child mortality rates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.cn/en/index.php?c=index&amp;a=lists&amp;catid=135 Gender Equality] UNICEF (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unfpa.org/gender/docs/sexselectn_china.pdf UNFPA First Agency to Campaign against Sex Selection in China] United Nations Population Fund (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

;India
In India, according to a 2007 study by MacPherson, Prenatal Diagnostic Techniques Act (PCPNDT Act) was highly publicized by NGOs and the government. Many of the ads used depicted abortion as violent, creating fear of abortion itself within the population. The ads focused on the religious and moral shame associated with abortion. MacPherson claims this media campaign was not effective because some perceived this as an attack on their character, leading to many becoming closed off, rather than opening a dialogue about the issue.&lt;ref name=macpherson&gt;{{Cite journal|author=MacPherson, Yvonne |title=Images and Icons: Harnessing the Power of Media to Reduce Sex-Selective Abortion in India |journal=Gender and Development |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=413–23 |date=November 2007 |doi=10.1080/13552070701630574}}&lt;/ref&gt; This emphasis on morality, claims MacPherson, increased fear and shame associated with all abortions, leading to an increase in unsafe abortions in India.&lt;ref name=macpherson /&gt;

The government of India, in a 2011 report, has begun better educating all stakeholders about its MTP and PCPNDT laws. In its communication campaigns, it is clearing up public misconceptions by emphasizing that sex determination is illegal, but abortion is legal for certain medical conditions in India. The government is also supporting implementation of programs and initiatives that seek to reduce gender discrimination, including media campaign to address the underlying social causes of sex selection.&lt;ref name=wbhindia&gt;[http://www.wbhealth.gov.in/download/IMPLEMENTATION%20OF%20THE%20PCPNDT%20ACT%20IN%20INDIA.pdf IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PCPNDT ACT IN INDIA – Perspectives and Challenges] Public Health Foundation of India, Supported by United Nations FPA (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jskvrc.gov.in/ipas/2.pdf MTP and PCPNDT Initiatives Report] Government of India (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other recent policy initiatives adopted by numerous states of India, claims Guilmoto,&lt;ref name=czg /&gt; attempt to address the assumed economic disadvantage of girls by offering support to girls and their parents. These policies provide [[conditional cash transfer]] and scholarships only available to girls, where payments to a girl and her parents are linked to each stage of her life, such as when she is born, completion of her childhood immunization, her joining school at grade 1, her completing school grades 6, 9 and 12, her marriage past age 21. Some states are offering higher pension benefits to parents who raise one or two girls. Different states of India have been experimenting with various innovations in their girl-driven welfare policies. For example, the state of Delhi adopted a pro-girl policy initiative (locally called ''Laadli scheme''), which initial data suggests may be lowering the birth sex ratio in the state.&lt;ref name=czg&gt;Christophe Z Guilmoto, [https://www.unfpa.org/webdav/site/global/shared/documents/Guilmoto_Revised_presentation_Hanoi_Oct2011.pdf Sex imbalances at birth Trends, consequences and policy implications] {{webarchive|url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120604063319/https://www.unfpa.org/webdav/site/global/shared/documents/Guilmoto_Revised_presentation_Hanoi_Oct2011.pdf |date=June 4, 2012 }} United Nations Population Fund, Hanoi (October 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://delhi.gov.in/wps/wcm/connect/doit_wcd/wcd/Home/Delhi+Ladli+Scheme/ Delhi Laadli scheme 2008] Government of Delhi, India&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sextus Aelius Paetus Catus''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 198-194 BC) or Sextus Aelius Q.f. Paetus Catus (or "the clever one"),&lt;ref&gt;Information on the career and works of Sextus Aelius Paetus from an Oxford University site (accessed via [http://www.oup.com/uk/orc/bin/9780199276073/resources/timeline/jurists_rep2.pdf Google cache] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101002110745/http://www.oup.com/uk/orc/bin/9780199276073/resources/timeline/jurists_rep2.pdf |date=2010-10-02 }}), or as &lt;www.oup.com/uk/orc/bin/9780199276073/resources/timeline/jurists_rep2.pdf&gt; (PDF). Retrieved 30 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Roman Republic]]an [[Roman consul|consul]], elected in 198 BC. Today, he is best known for his interpretation of the laws of the [[Twelve Tables]], which is known to us only through the praise of [[Cicero]]. Paetus Catus came from a prominent [[plebe]]ian noble family; his father was a [[praetor]], and his elder brother was another consul, [[Publius Aelius Paetus (consul 201 BC)|Publius Aelius Paetus]].

==Family==
Sextus Aelius Paetus was apparently the younger surviving son of [[Quintus Aelius Paetus]], a praetor who was one of the many Roman senators killed at [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]] in August 216 BC. Other members of the gens Aelia who rose to high office included [[Publius Aelius Paetus]], who was consul in 337 BC, and [[Gaius Aelius Paetus]], consul in 286 BC.[https://web.archive.org/web/20090427001929/http://web.genealogie.free.fr/Les_dynasties/Antiquite/Rome_et_Constantinople/Gentes/A_Gentes.htm].  Both earlier consuls may have been ancestors, or collateral kinsmen, but the connection is not mentioned by the Roman historian [[Livy]].

Paetus's elder brother became [[Master of the Horse]] in 202, and consul in the following year. Other members of the family, including Publius's son, succeeded to the consulship in later years.

==Political career==
Little is known of Paetus Catus's political career, or how he acquired the additional [[cognomen]] of "Catus". Livy mentions that he was [[curule aedile]] in 200 BC, when he imported grain from Africa.

According to an Oxford dictionary of Roman jurists,&lt;ref&gt;See above, which represents an extract, including the entry on Sextus Aelius Paetus Catus, online)&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Paetus Catus's rapid rise from curule aedile to the consulship and censorship was not due to his father's death or his elder brother's successes, but his  aptitude for the law. He was apparently nicknamed “catus” meaning “clever” or "the clever one" in recognition of his legal skills.  Catus may have given up other aspects of his public career (he is not mentioned in any military action by Livy) to devote his time to the study of law. The Oxford dictionary believes that he may have been the first professional jurist in the history of Rome. (It is not clear if earlier jurists were not professional, or were part-timers, but a Roman paterfamilias of rank and status, or his grown sons, would be expected to defend his family's clients in legal matters. Perhaps the Punic war meant that too many such patrons were away from Rome, and unable to handle legal matters).

His brother [[Publius Aelius Paetus (consul 201 BC)|Publius Aelius Paetus]] had been consul three years earlier in 201, and was elected censor 199.  Publius's success may have helped Sextus to the consulship in 198, but he was overshadowed by his younger and eventually more famous patrician colleague, [[Titus Quinctius Flamininus|Titus Quinctius T.f. Flamininus]], then aged only thirty.

Sextus did not distinguish himself militarily during his consulship, with all honours, including the Macedonian/Greek campaigns, going to his much younger colleague Flamininus. His own efforts in his assigned province were not marked with much success. However, he was still elected censor in 194 with [[Gaius Cornelius Cethegus]], possibly out of respect for his skills as a jurist, possibly out of respect for his elder brother, a former censor.

==Paetus, the jurist==
Aelius Paetus and his brother [[Publius Aelius Paetus (consul 201 BC)|Publius]] were both apparently jurists. Sextus was author of a work, ''Commentaria tripartita'' or ''tripertita '', which systematically set out each provision of the [[Twelve Tables]], provided a commentary, and then discussed a relevant action-at-law for each provision. Another work called ''Ius Aelianum'' discussed actions-at-law only.&lt;ref&gt;However, another source (William Smith's 1875 Dictionary, insists these two works are one and the same - ''Commentaria tripartita'', or ''Ius Aelianum'', also called ''Tripertita '' (perhaps a misspelling) [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Jus_Aelianum.html]; the work, according to this source, apparently contained the Law of the [[Twelve Tables]], an interpretation thereof, and ''Legis Actiones'' (actions-at-law).&lt;/ref&gt; The former work was praised by no less a judge than [[Cicero]], and was evidently extant during the lifetime of his friend [[Titus Pomponius Atticus]] who refers to it.  When the work disappeared is unknown.

[[File:Square ribbon knot.svg|thumb|240px|The square knot, drawn as a [[ribbon knot]]]]
[[File:Square knot sum of trefoils stick number.png|175px|thumb|Square knot {{=}} trefoil + trefoil reflection. [[stick number|Sticks depicted]].]]

In [[knot theory]], the '''square knot''' is a [[composite knot]] obtained by taking the [[Connected sum#Connected sum of knots|connected sum]] of a [[trefoil knot]] with its [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]].  It is closely related to the [[granny knot (mathematics)|granny knot]], which is also a connected sum of two trefoils.  Because the trefoil knot is the simplest nontrivial knot, the square knot and the granny knot are the simplest of all composite knots.

The square knot is the mathematical version of the common [[reef knot]].

==Construction==
The square knot can be constructed from two trefoil knots, one of which must be left-handed and the other right-handed.  Each of the two knots is cut, and then the loose ends are joined together pairwise.  The resulting connected sum is the square knot.

It is important that the original trefoil knots be mirror images of one another.  If two identical trefoil knots are used instead, the result is a granny knot.

==Properties==
The square knot is [[amphichiral knot|amphichiral]], meaning that it is indistinguishable from its own mirror image.  The [[crossing number (knot theory)|crossing number]] of a square knot is six, which is the smallest possible crossing number for a composite knot.

The [[Alexander polynomial]] of the square knot is

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(t) = (t - 1 + t^{-1})^2, \, &lt;/math&gt;

which is simply the [[square (algebra)|square]] of the Alexander polynomial of a trefoil knot.  Similarly, the [[Alexander–Conway polynomial]] of a square knot is

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla(z) = (z^2+1)^2.&lt;/math&gt;

These two polynomials are the same as those for the granny knot.  However, the [[Jones polynomial]] for the square knot is

:&lt;math&gt;V(q) = (q^{-1} + q^{-3} - q^{-4})(q + q^3 - q^4) = -q^3 + q^2 - q + 3 - q^{-1} + q^{-2} - q^{-3}. \, &lt;/math&gt;

This is the product of the Jones polynomials for the right-handed and left-handed trefoil knots, and is different from the Jones polynomial for a granny knot.

The [[knot group]] of the square knot is given by the presentation

:&lt;math&gt;\langle x, y, z \mid x y x = y x y, x z x = z x z \rangle. \, &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Square Knot|urlname=SquareKnot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the knot group of the granny knot, and is the simplest example of two different knots with isomorphic knot groups.

Unlike the granny knot, the square knot is a [[ribbon knot]], and it is therefore also a [[slice knot]].

The proper strappado causes permanent visible damage.

==Variants==

There are three variants of this torture. In the first, victims have their arms tied behind their backs; a large rope is then tied to the wrists and passed over a [[pulley]], [[Beam (structure)|beam]], or a hook on the roof. The torturer pulls on this rope until the victim is hanging from the arms. Since the hands are tied behind the victim's back, this will cause a very intense pain and possible [[dislocation (medicine)|dislocation]] of the arms.&lt;ref name="cassar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="illum2016-07-08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="maestrogianni"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Attard|first1=Christian|title=The sad end of Maestro Gianni - A Neapolitan Buonavoglia and Sculptor|journal=Treasures of Malta|date=2013|issue=56|volume=XIX|url=https://www.academia.edu/7166765/The_Sad_end_of_Giovanni_Puglisi_-_A_Neapolitan_Buonavoglia_and_Sculptor|page=49|publisher=Fondazzjoni Patrimonju Malti|issn=1028-3013|oclc=	499647242|location=Valletta}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full weight of the subject's body is then supported by the extended and internally rotated shoulder sockets. While the technique shows no external injuries, it can cause long-term [[nerve]], [[ligament]], or [[tendon]] damage. The technique typically causes [[brachial plexus injury]], leading to [[paralysis]] or loss of sensation in the arms.

The second variation, known as squassation, is similar to the first, but a series of drops are added, meaning that the victim is allowed to drop until his or her fall is suddenly checked by the rope.&lt;ref name="borg-muscat"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Borg-Muscat|first1=David|title=Prison life in Malta in the 18th century – Valletta's Gran Prigione|journal=Storja|date=2001|pages=48–49|url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Storja/Storja2001/05s.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416102655/http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Storja/Storja2001/05s.pdf|archivedate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the damage caused by the suspension, the painful jerk would cause major stress to the extended and vulnerable arms, leading to broken shoulders. It is believed that [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], during his 1513 imprisonment after allegedly conspiring against the [[Medici]] family in [[Florence]], was subjected to this form of strappado.

In the third variant, the victim's hands are tied to the front. The victim is also hung from the hands, but the ankles are tied and a heavy weight is attached to them. This will cause pain and possible damage not only to the arms, but also to the legs and hips.

==History==
According to [[William Godwin]], [[Girolamo Savonarola]] was tortured by strappado multiple times before being put to death in a [[trial by ordeal]] (fire); Savonarola, however, apparently renounced his confessions after being tortured, which eventually led to his sentence of [[Death by burning|burning at the stake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John Abraham|last=Heraud|author-link=John Abraham Heraud|title=The life and times of Girolamo Savonarola: illustrating the progress of the Reformation in Italy, during the fifteenth century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n9wEAAAAYAAJ|year=1843|publisher=Whittaker|page=371}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This device was thought to be used during the [[Salem Witch Trials]] of Salem, Massachusetts in 1692 to torture accused witches.

==Modern instances==
[[File:Metallstange-zur-Folterung.jpg|thumb|upright|A sculpture depicting strappado]]
In the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]], prisoners were punished by having their hands tied behind their back, and then being suspended on a pole with their feet just above the ground for half an hour. This was also systematically used in [[Dachau Concentration Camp]] for infringement of camp rules. Originally the punishment used tree branches, but it was moved into a shower room on special poles so that victims could not relieve the pain as they could by using the tree. Holocaust survivor [[Jean Améry]] writes of his own experiences of strappado when being tortured at the Nazi concentration camp of Fort Breendonk in occupied Belgium. Améry's analytical descriptions of the torture were included in a number of works by the writer [[W. G. Sebald]] (notably the novel ''Austerlitz'').

The "ropes" was one of several torture methods employed at the Hỏa Lò Prison, popularly known as the [[Hanoi Hilton]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/25/magazine/25stockdale.html "The Prisoner"], ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The site was used by the [[North Vietnamese Army]] to house, torture and interrogate captured servicemen, mostly American [[airmen]] shot down during bombing raids (including [[USAF]] officer [[Joseph Kittinger]], and [[US Navy]] pilot [and later [[US Senator]]] [[John McCain#Prisoner of war|John McCain]]).&lt;ref name="karnow-655"&gt;{{cite book | last=Karnow | first=Stanley | authorlink=Stanley Karnow | title=Vietnam: A History | publisher=[[The Viking Press]] | year=1983 | isbn=0-670-74604-5}} p. 655.&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the torture was usually not acquiring military information; rather, it was to break the will of the prisoners, both individually and as a group, and to get written or recorded statements from the prisoners who criticized U.S.&amp;nbsp;conduct of the war and praised how the [[North Vietnam]]ese treated them.&lt;ref name="afm-valor"&gt;Hubbell, ''P.O.W.'', pp. 288–306.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 1997 [[Human Rights Watch]] report, this technique was "widely employed" by the security forces of [[Turkey]], where it is "usually used together with high-pressure water, electric shock, beating, or [[sexual molestation]] such as squeezing the [[testicle]]s or breast or placing a [[Baton (law enforcement)|nightstick]] against or in the [[vagina]] or [[anus]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/reports/1997/turkey/Turkey-04.htm#P176_36663 TURKEY: TORTURE AND MISTREATMENT IN PRE-TRIAL DETENTION BY ANTI-TERROR POLICE - Techniques of Abuse]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] found Turkey guilty of torture for its use of reverse hanging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrcr.org/safrica/freedom_security/aksoy_turkey.html ''Aksoy v.

In 2003, one of the Bulgarian nurses interrogated during the [[HIV trial in Libya]], Snezhana Dimitrova, stated that she had been tortured in this way.

&lt;blockquote&gt;They tied my hands behind my back. Then they hung me from a door. It feels like they are stretching you from all sides.

In November 2003, [[Manadel al-Jamadi]], a suspected terrorist, was tortured to death at [[Abu Ghraib Prison]] during a [[Central Intelligence Agency]] interrogation.

'''Surinder Kapoor''' (23 December 1925 – 24 September 2011) was an [[Indian people|Indian]] [[film producer]]. He produced [[Bollywood]] films and also served as President of the Film &amp; Television Producers Guild of India from 1995 to 2001.  He was born in [[Peshawar]], [[British Raj|British India]] (in present-day [[Pakistan]]). Surinder Kapoor belonged to a [[Punjabi Hindu]] family from Peshawar.

[[Prithviraj Kapoor]], the famous [[Bollywood]] actor and a distant cousin, is the one who invited Surinder Kapoor to Bombay to join the [[Hindi Film Industry]].&lt;ref name="Surinder Kapoor &amp; Prithviraj Kapoor"&gt;{{cite news|title=Surinder Kapoor, cousin of Prithviraj Kapoor|url=http://movies.rediff.com/report/2009/may/04/surinder-kapoor-on-life-and-times.htm|newspaper= Rediff.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started his film career as a secretary to Hindi film star of the 1950s [[Geeta Bali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Its all in the family |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-10-02/news-interviews/28093851_1_bollywood-sanjay-leela-bhansali-s-saawariya-shashi-kapoor |accessdate=28 March 2012|newspaper=Times of India|date=2 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dada Saheb Phalke Academy honoured him with the Shri L V Prasad Phalke award in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bollywood veteran Manoj Kumar felicitated with Phalke Ratna award|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/movies-and-theatre/bollywood-veteran-manoj-kumar-felicitated-with-phalke-ratna-award_529055.html |publisher=Zee news |accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked in an interview, how he established S.K.International Films, he quoted in an interview "[[Rajesh Khanna]] who played the title-role in [[Shehzada]] was truly of a princely disposition. He started shooting for me without ever discussing the price, saying that we could settle that once the film is made, he said and made banner S. K. International Films became an acknowledged company."&lt;ref&gt;http://syndication.screenindia.com/news/the-other-kapoor/511928/{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; His first successful film in Hindi as a producer was Shehzada directed by [[K. Shankar]] which was a remake of Tamil film Idhu Sathiyam (1963). However, Surinder's subsequent release [[Phool Khile Hain Gulshan Gulshan (film)]] and Bikash Rao were flops, due to which he went into huge debts. Later as a producer in 1980's he made good money with his productions, which were remakes of Kannada, Tamil or Telugu films like [[Hum Paanch (1980 film)|Hum Paanch]], [[Woh Saat Din]], [[Loafer (1996 film)|Loafer]], [[Judaai (1997 film)|''Judaai'']], [[Sirf Tum (1997 film)|''Sirf Tum'']], [[Hamara Dil Aapke Paas Hai]], [[Pukar (2000 film)|''Pukar'']], [[No Entry]] - all of them starring his son [[Anil Kapoor]] in the lead.

He died after suffering a cardiac arrest on 24 September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Film producer Surinder Kapoor dies|url=http://daily.bhaskar.com/article/MAH-MUM-film-producer-surinder-kapoor-dies-2457355.html |accessdate=28 March 2012 |newspaper=Daily Bhaskar |date=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pradhan|first=Bharathi|title=Separation pangs for Sri|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1111002/jsp/7days/story_14577895.jsp |accessdate=28 March 2012 |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His three sons, [[Boney Kapoor|Boney]], [[Anil Kapoor|Anil]] and [[Sanjay Kapoor|Sanjay]], are also involved in the film industry. [[Anil Kapoor]] is a successful Bollywood actor. His daughter-in-law [[Sridevi]] married to his eldest son [[Boney Kapoor|Boney]] was a famous [[Bollywood]] actress. His daughter, Reena, is married to Sandeep Marwah of Marwah Films &amp; Video Studios. [[Boney Kapoor|Boney]] is a well known and a famous Producer and [[Sanjay Kapoor|Sanjay]] acted in several movies.

'''''The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia''''' is a 2006 book by [[Neil Gorsuch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/judge-neil-gorsuch-scotus-nominee/story?id=45008516 | title = Judge Neil Gorsuch: What You Need to Know About the SCOTUS Nominee  | date= 31 January 2017 | accessdate = 4 February 2017 | publisher = ''ABC News'' | author = Audrey Taylor and Geneva Sands }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book presents legal and moral arguments against [[euthanasia]] and [[assisted suicide]], advocating for the retention of bans on the practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nationallawjournal.com/home/id=1202778122006/Neil-Gorsuch-In-His-Own-Words?mcode=1202617074964&amp;curindex=1&amp;slreturn=20170103203025 | title =  Neil Gorsuch: In His Own Words | date= 2 February 2017 | accessdate = 4 February 2017 | publisher = ''The National Law Journal'' | author = Tony Mauro }}&lt;/ref&gt; It explores case histories from jurisdictions that have legalized the practice, including [[Oregon]] and the [[Euthanasia in the Netherlands|Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="JRE"/&gt; ''The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia'' grew out of Gorsuch's doctoral dissertation.

==Contents==

In ''The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia'', Gorsuch treats [[physician-assisted suicide]] and [[euthanasia]] as morally identical acts.&lt;ref name="JRE"/&gt; The scope of the book is limited to intentional killing by private persons, avoiding the complexities of considering the issue alongside the [[death penalty]] and warfare.&lt;ref name="JRE"/&gt; In the book, Gorsuch rejects commonly held views about autonomy, arguing that states should sometimes place "paternalistic constraints on the choices of its citizens."&lt;ref name="JRE"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boer|first1=Theo A.|title=Recurring Themes in the Debate About Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide|journal=Journal of Religious Ethics|date=1 September 2007|volume=35|issue=3|pages=529–555|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9795.2007.00318.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9795.2007.00318.x/full|language=en|issn=1467-9795}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sharply criticizes judge [[Richard Posner]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]], who wrote that government should not interfere with a person's decision to end their life. Gorsuch argues that Posner's view could require the legalization of [[consensual homicide]] and would lead to mass [[suicide pact]]s, [[duel]]s, and [[organ trade|organ sales]].&lt;ref name="WaPo"/&gt; Gorsuch further characterized assisted suicide as, "essentially a right to consensual homicide."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sltrib.com/home/4894718-155/ap-gorsuch-case-review-shows-hes?page=2 | title = AP: Gorsuch case review shows he’s no crusader on abortion | date= 2 February 2017 | accessdate = 4 February 2017 | publisher = ''Salt Lake Tribune'' | author = Larry Neumeister, Garance Bruke and Mitch Weiss }}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that the U.S. should "retain existing law [banning assisted suicide and euthanasia] on the basis that human life is fundamentally and inherently valuable, and that the intentional taking of human life by private persons is always wrong."&lt;ref name="Gorsuch 2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gorsuch |first=N.M. |title=The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia |publisher=Princeton University Press |series=New Forum Books |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-4008-3034-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DwwqAgdREKoC |accessdate=February 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accusation of plagiarism==

On April 4, 2017, [[Buzzfeed]] and ''[[Politico]]'' ran articles highlighting similar language occurring in ''The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia'' and an earlier law review article by Abigail Lawlis Kuzma, [[Indiana]]'s deputy [[attorney general]]. Academic experts contacted by ''Politico'' "differed in their assessment of what Gorsuch did, ranging from calling it a clear impropriety to mere sloppiness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Analysis {{!}} Neil Gorsuch’s 11th-hour plagiarism scare|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/04/05/neil-gorsuchs-11th-hour-plagiarism-scare/|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LoganBizInside04042016"&gt;Bryan Logan (April 4, 2016) [http://www.businessinsider.com/neil-gorsuch-plagiarism-allegations-supreme-court-confirmation-2017-4 Neil Gorsuch is accused of plagiarism amid a heated Supreme Court confirmation fight], businessinsider.com; accessed April 15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BresnanhanPolitico04042017"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/gorsuch-writings-supreme-court-236891|title=Gorsuch's writings borrow from other authors|publisher=politico.com|accessdate=April 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Short Section In Neil Gorsuch's 2006 Book Appears To Be Copied From A Law Review Article|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/a-short-section-in-neil-gorsuchs-2006-book-appears-to-be|work=BuzzFeed|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gorsuch's advisor at Oxford, John Finnis, stated, "The allegation is entirely without foundation. The book is meticulous in its citation of primary sources. The allegation that the book is guilty of plagiarism because it does not cite secondary sources which draw on those same primary sources is, frankly, absurd."&lt;ref name="LoganBizInside04042016"/&gt; Kuzma stated, "I have reviewed both passages and do not see an issue here, even though the language is similar. These passages are factual, not analytical in nature, framing both the technical legal and medical circumstances of the '[[Baby Doe Law|Baby/Infant Doe]]' case that occurred in 1982."&lt;ref name="LoganBizInside04042016"/&gt; [[Noah Feldman]], a Harvard Law professor, thought that Gorsuch had committed "minor plagiarism", that deserved "no more punishment than the embarrassment attendant on its revelation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gorsuch's Plagiarism Is Worthy of Embarrassment|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-04-05/gorsuch-s-plagiarism-is-worthy-of-embarrassment|work=Bloomberg.com|date=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Oosthuizen''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɛ|s|t|h|aɪ|z|ən}} {{respell|WEST|hye|zən}}; born 2 April 1988) is a South African [[professional boxer]]. He is a former [[International Boxing Organization|IBO]] world champion in two [[weight class (boxing)|weight classes]], having held the [[super-middleweight]] title from 2011 to 2014, and the [[light-heavyweight]] title in 2015.

==Professional career==
{{Update|section|date=November 2017}}
Oosthuizen made his professional debut on 29 February 2008, knocking out Johannes Swart in two rounds. He then reeled off twelve straight victories, nine of which coming by way of knockout.

===IBO super-middleweight champion===
On 6 November 2010, Oosthuizen faced off against [[International Boxing Organization|IBO]] [[Super Middleweight]] titleholder [[Isaac Chilemba]]. The result was a split-decision draw which allowed Chilemba to retain the title, Oosthuizen claims that attempted to make a rematch were swiftly declined.&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web | last =Wainwright|first =Anson| title =Thomas Oosthuizen: "I will take an ugly win over a pretty loss any day."  | work = | publisher =''Max Boxing'' | date =20 September 2011 | url= http://www.maxboxing.com/news/promo-lead/thomas-oosthuizen-i-will-take-an-ugly-win-over-a-pretty-loss-any-day | accessdate =2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 March 2011, Oosthuizen got a second crack at the [[International Boxing Organization|IBO]] title against Evert Bravo (Chilemba had vacated the title to move up to the [[Light Heavyweight]] class).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Jackson|first =Ron| title =Oosthuizen-Bravo for IBO belt   | work = | publisher =''Fightnews'' | date =3 September 2011 | url= http://www.fightnews.com/Boxing/oosthuizen-bravo-for-ibo-belt-79204 | accessdate =2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oosthuizen won the fight via a ninth-round technical knockout, which saw the referee stepping in to save Bravo from taking further punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Chaykovsky|first =Edward| title =Thomas Oosthuizen Stops Evert Bravo, Wins IBO Title   | work = | publisher =''Boxing Scene'' | date =26 March 2011 | url= http://www.boxingscene.com/thomas-oosthuizen-stops-evert-bravo-wins-ibo-title--37459 | accessdate =2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oosthuizen made his American debut on the undercard of [[Andre Berto]] vs. [[Jan Zaveck]], winning a unanimous decision over Aaron Pryor Jr on 3 September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Chaykovsky|first =Edward| title=Oosthuiszen, Bailey and Del Valle Win Bouts in Biloxi  | work = | publisher =''Boxing Scene'' | date =3 September 2011 | url= http://www.boxingscene.com/oosthuiszen-bailey-del-valle-win-bouts-biloxi--43353 | accessdate =2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After two seemingly lackluster performances (a draw with [[Brandon Gonzáles]] and split decision victory over [[Ezequiel Maderna]]), a motorcycle injury forced Oosthuizen to withdraw from a scheduled bout fight with [[Eleider Alvarez]]. He was subsequently released by his promoter Rodney Berman, who cited the fact that Oosthuizen was at least 13 pounds over the 175&amp;nbsp;lb. limit for the bout; stating, "He's had so many chances and blown every one".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Rafael|first =Dan| title =Thomas Oosthuizen injured, released   | work = | publisher =ESPN | date =26 January 2014 | url= http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/10251611/thomas-oosthuizen-crashes-bicycle-dropped-promotor | accessdate =2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a brief stint in rehabilitation, Oosthuizen was able to mend ties with his promoter in an attempt to move forward with his boxing career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldengloves.co.za/boxing-news/tommy-gun-re-loads/ |title="Tommy Gun" re-loads!| publisher= ''Golden Gloves''|accessdate=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He vacated his IBO Super Middleweight Title on April 21, 2014 and is scheduled to face Frenchman Doudou Ngumbu in Light Heavyweight bout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldengloves.co.za/boxing-news/no-title-tommy-gun-turns-the-corner/ |title=No-title ‘Tommy Gun’ turns the corner| publisher= ''Golden Gloves''|accessdate=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldboxingnews.net/news/wbn/2014/05/05/oosthuizen-faces-ngumbu-on-return-whilst-makabu-walks-out-on-golden-gloves.html |title=OOSTHUIZEN FACES NGUMBU ON RETURN...| publisher= ''World Boxing News''|accessdate=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tūhawaiki''' ({{circa|1805}} &amp;ndash; 10 October 1844) — often known as ''Hone Tūhawaiki'', ''John Tūhawaiki'' or ''Jack Tūhawaiki'', or by his nickname of "Bloody Jack" — became a [[paramount chief]] of the [[Ngāi Tahu]] [[Māori people|Māori]] [[iwi]] in the southern part of the [[South Island]] of [[New Zealand]], and was based predominantly on [[Ruapuke Island]]. He gained his nickname from early interactions with [[Foveaux Strait]] [[whaling|whalers]] on account of his colourful and expletive-laden speech, and it embarrassed him in later years after his conversion to Christianity.

Born at [[Inch Clutha]] in [[South Otago]] in the early years of the 19th century, he gained prominence in about 1833 when a war-party led by him defeated the [[Ngāti Toa]] chief [[Te Rauparaha]] at [[Lake Grassmere]]. The Ngāti Toa leader escaped with his life only through luck. Four years later, a war-party led by Tūhawaiki and [[Te Matenga Taiaroa|Taiaroa]] inflicted severe damage on Ngāti Toa troops in a number of raids. Around the same time, Tūhawaiki became Ngāi Tahu chief upon the death of his uncle, Te Whakataupuka. He gained a reputation as a bold and intelligent military [[leadership|leader]], as well as shrewd and insightful in his non-military dealings with [[pākehā]] settlers.

On 10 June 1840, Tūhawaiki signed a copy of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] aboard {{HMS|Herald|1822|6}} at Ruapuke.

Tūhawaiki became involved in numerous sales of land to [[Pakeha settlers|settlers]] and [[entrepreneur]]s, notably that of the [[Otago]] Block to Frederick Tuckett, Symonds, and Clarke for £2,400 in July 1844.

During the spring of 1844, Tūhawaiki drowned south of [[Timaru]] when his boat hit rocks at a location now known as Tūhawaiki Point. Other New Zealand places named in his honour include Jack's Bay and the nearby Tūhawaiki Island in [[the Catlins]], as well as a peak in Fiordland's Darran Mountains.

A number of artefacts belonging or relating to Tūhawaiki still exist in New Zealand museums. The [[Southland Museum and Art Gallery]] has a bayonet and a 12-pounder cannon reputedly owned by Tūhawaiki, the [[Otago Museum]] has a revolving flintlock rifle thought to be Tūhawaiki's, and the [[Hocken Collections]], [[University of Otago]] has a document signed by Tūhawaiki in both English and [[moko]]-form [http://www.treaty2u.govt.nz/images/two-parties-main-3.jpg].

It is considered part of the [[Czechoslovak New Wave]] movement.&lt;ref name="popmatters" /&gt; The film stars 13-year-old [[Jaroslava Schallerová]] as Valerie, with a supporting cast that includes Helena Anýžová, Karel Engel, Jan Klusák, and Petr Kopriva.

''Valerie and Her Week of Wonders'' was filmed in the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] town of [[Slavonice]] and surrounding areas. The film portrays the heroine as living in a disorienting dream, cajoled by priests, [[vampire]]s, and men and women alike. The film blends elements of the [[Fantasy film|fantasy]] and horror film genres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kinoeye.org/03/09/krzywinska09.php|work=KinoEye|accessdate=10 December 2011|title=Czech horror: Jaromil Jireš's  Valerie a týden divů  (Valerie and Her Week of Wonders, 1970)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot==
Valerie, a pretty young girl, is asleep when a thief steals her earrings; as she tries to investigate, she's startled by a horrific man, the Constable, who covers his face with a mask. The thief returns her earrings the next day, angering the Constable.

Back at her house, Valerie's grandmother, Elsa, tells her that the earrings were left behind by Valerie's mother upon joining a convent. Previously, the earrings belonged to the Constable, who also owned their house. Valerie also learns that a group of missionaries and a company of actors are coming to town. During her neighbor Hedvika's wedding, Valerie sees the Constable watching her in the crowd and her grandmother also seems to recognize him. Valerie receives a letter from the thief, Orlík ("Eaglet"), warning her that the Constable, his uncle, killed Orlík's parents and now wants Valerie's earrings back. Orlík asks Valerie to meet him at the church that evening; when they meet he doesn't hide his attraction to her.

Later, Valerie meets the Constable in the street, in disguise; he leads Valerie to a chamber where her grandmother [[Self-flagellation|whips herself]] to win back the love of a past lover, a priest named Gracián. Orlík saves Valerie and tells her that his uncle is in love with her. The Constable meets Elsa, who calls him Richard and was his lover when she was 17. He promises to make her young again if she sells him the house that Valerie will inherit. Meanwhile, Orlík gives Valerie a pearl for protection, then hides her from Richard again. At a picnic, Gracián tells Valerie that Orlík is her brother. That night, Gracián comes into her bedroom and attempts to rape her, but she swallows the pearl to protect herself. Meanwhile, Richard and Elsa sneak into Hedvika's; while Hedvika and her husband consummate their marriage, Elsa bites her on the neck, stealing the blood necessary to become young again.

Valerie finds Orlík bound to a waterfall by Richard. Valerie frees Orlík and takes him to her house, avoiding his romantic intentions by blindfolding him, since she now thinks they're siblings. They discover Gracián hanging dead from Valerie's window and take the body to a crypt under Valerie's house; Elsa is there, now a [[vampire]]. Disguised as a young woman, Elsa introduces herself as a distant cousin and tells Valerie that her grandmother left suddenly. She tries to bite Valerie, then restrains her while she's asleep and steals the earrings. Elsa imprisons Valerie, who then observes Elsa having sex with a man and then killing him, then attempting to seduce Orlík, who instead steals the earrings again.

Orlík frees Valerie, returns her earrings, and confesses his love for her. He tries to explain that he's not her father's son, but Richard's, but Valerie runs away. She has guessed Elsa is actually her grandmother, and started to feel something for Richard, who's dying. Valerie steals a chicken from the market and takes it to Richard, who's just told Elsa that he is Valerie's father, and that Valerie's blood is the key to their survival. When Valerie heals Richard, he reverts to being a monster and attacks her. He plans to transplant Orlík's heart into Valerie to make her immortal, but Elsa wants it for herself. Valerie, pretending to be unconscious, overhears everything. She revives Gracián, who wasn't actually dead, and finds a goodbye letter from Orlík.

Valerie meets Hedvika, sick from Elsa's bite and depressed about her marriage. They retreat into Hedvika's bedroom and spend the night together, after which Hedvika is healed. Outside, Gracián tells a crowd that Valerie is a witch who tempted him into sin. He orders her captured and [[burned at the stake]], but Valerie swallows the magic earrings and escapes unharmed. In the crypt, now a brothel, Valerie tricks Richard into drinking one of the earrings, turning him into a polecat. In a progressively more dreamlike sequence, Valerie reunites with Orlík, revealed to be one of the actors; then Elsa, who doesn't recall anything that's happened; then her long-lost parents. In the final scene everyone dances around Valerie in the forest, while the virgins sing for her. Eventually she falls asleep in a bed in the forest, alone.

===Home media===
In January 2004, the film was released on [[DVD]] in the United States and Canada by [[Facets Video]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Valerie-Week-Wonders-týden-divu/dp/B00013D48G|work=Amazon.com|title=Valerie and Her Week of Wonders|accessdate=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June of that same year, the film was released on DVD in the UK by [[Redemption Films|Redemption Films Ltd.]]. In June 2015, the film was released on DVD and [[Blu-ray]] by [[the Criterion Collection]], featuring a [[4K resolution|4K]] digital restoration; three early [[short film]]s by director Jireš, ''Uncle'' (1959), ''Footprints'' (1960), and ''The Hall of Lost Steps'' (1960); interviews from 2006 with Jaroslava Schallerová and Jan Klusák; and an alternate [[psychedelic folk]] soundtrack by [[the Valerie Project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/films/27860-valerie-and-her-week-of-wonders|title=Valerie and Her Week of Wonders (1970)|website=[[The Criterion Collection]]|access-date=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 100% based on {{nowrap|14 reviews}}, with a [[weighted average]] rating of 7.8/10.&lt;ref name="rottentomatoes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Valerie and Her Week of Wonders (1970) - Rotten Tomatoes|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/valerie_and_her_week_of_wonders/|website=Rotten Tomatoes.com|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film "Consistently and humorously anticlerical", writing that it "may be the most exotic flower to bloom on the grave of the [[Prague Spring]], but it's one with deep roots in 20th-century Czech culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/05/movies/homevideo/tom-jerry-and-valerie-and-her-week-of-wonders-cat-mouse-and-head-trip.html|title=Tom, Jerry and ‘Valerie and Her Week of Wonders’: Cat, Mouse and Head Trip|author=[[J. Hoberman]]|date=2 July 2015|website=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Jordan Cronk of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' wrote that the film "may be a willfully enigmatic, even obtuse viewing experience, but every frame continues to vibrant with energy and thrum with life", and gave the film a rating of three-and-a-half out of five stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/dvd/review/valerie-and-her-week-of-wonders|title=Valerie and Her Week of Wonders|author=Jordan Cronk|date=29 June 2015|website=[[Slant Magazine]]|access-date=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mike D'Angelo]] of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the film a rating of C-, calling it "the sort of film that you really have to experience for yourself" and writing that "some will see not so much a week of wonders as a week of wanking. Others will be entranced".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/maybe-ignore-our-grade-and-see-valerie-and-her-wee-221522|title=Maybe ignore our grade and see Valerie And Her Week Of Wonders for yourself|author=[[Mike D'Angelo]]|date=1 July 2015|website=[[The A.V.

In the book ''[[1001 Films You Must See Before You Die|101 Horror Films You Must See Before You Die]]'', author and professor at [[Brunel University]] Tanya Krzyminska called the film "an exquisitely crafted fairy tale woven around the sexual awakening of a young woman". Krzyminska also noted that, although the film shared many similarities with [[Softcore pornography|soft-core pornographic film]]s of the period, "it seeks a broader canvas in a blend of attributes drawn from both high and low culture." Krzyminska also noted the film's elements of [[gothic horror]] and [[fairy tales]], as well as its use of symbolic imagery.&lt;ref name="Schneider2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Jay Schneider|title=101 Horror Movies You Must See Before You Die|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dnmpPQAACAAJ|year=2009|publisher=Octopus Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-84403-673-8|pages=177–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==
Many writers have cited similarities between the film and the work of [[English literature|English writer]] [[Angela Carter]] (1940–1992), who had seen the film during its release in [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinoeye.org/03/09/krzywinska09.php|title=Transgression, transformation and titillation|author=Tanya Krzywinska|publisher=Kinoeye: New Perspectives on European Film|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her screenplay for ''[[The Company of Wolves]]'' (1984) adapted from Carter's short stories, in collaboration with director [[Neil Jordan]], bears a direct or indirect influence. A May 2005 Jireš retrospective film series at [[Riverside Studios]] showed the two films together.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In 2006 members of [[New Weird America]] acts [[Espers (band)|Espers]], [[Fern Knight]], [[Fursaxa]] and other musicians formed [[the Valerie Project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/thevalerieproject|title=the Valerie Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group performs original compositions in unison with the film.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

'''Vātsyāyana''' is the name of an ancient [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosopher]], known for writing the ''[[Kama Soutra]]'', the most famous book in the world on human sexuality. He lived in India during the second or third century CE, probably in Pataliputra (modern day Patna). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=A.N.D.Haskar|title=Kama Sutra |year=2011|publisher=Penguin Classics |isbn=978-0-14-310659-3|pages=17 and 22 (of the introduction)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He is not to be confused with Pakṣilasvāmin Vātsyāyana, the author of ''Nyāya Sutra Bhāshya'', the first preserved commentary on [[Akṣapāda Gotama|Gotama]]'s ''[[Nyaya Sutras|Nyāya Sutras]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sures Chandra Banerji. A Companion to Sanskrit Literature. Motilal Banarsidass Pub., 1990, p. 104-105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JkOAEdIsdUsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;vq=paksilisa&amp;pg=PA104#v=onepage&amp;q=kamasutra&amp;f=false A Companion to Sanskrit Literature]{{pn|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His name is sometimes erroneously confused with Mallanaga, the prophet of the [[Asura]]s, to whom the origin of erotic science is attributed.&lt;ref&gt;Alain Daniélou, p.4. Quote: "The attribution of the first name Mallanaga to Vatsyayana is due to the confusion of his role as editor of the ''Kama Sutra'' with that of the mythical creator of erotic science."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
Hardly anything is known about Vātsyāyana, although it is believed that his disciples went on his instructions, on the request of the Hindu Kings in the Himalayan range to influence the hill tribals to give up the pagan cult of sacrifices. He is said to have created the legend of Tara among the hill tribes as a tantric goddess. Later as the worship spread to the east Garo hills, the goddess manifest of a 'yoni' goddess Kamakhya was created. His interest in human sexual behavior as a medium of attaining spirituality was recorded in his treatise [[Kama Sutra]].

At the close of the Kama Sutra this is what he writes about himself:

&lt;blockquote&gt;After reading and considering the works of Babhravya and other ancient authors, and thinking over the meaning of the rules given by them, this treatise was composed, according to the precepts of the Holy Writ, for the benefit of the world, by Vatsyayana, while leading the life of a religious student at Benares, and wholly engaged in the contemplation of the Deity. This work is not to be used merely as an instrument for satisfying our desires. A person acquainted with the true principles of this science, who preserves his Dharma (virtue or religious merit), his Artha (worldly wealth) and his Kama (pleasure or sensual gratification), and who has regard to the customs of the people, is sure to obtain the mastery over his senses. In short, an intelligent and knowing person attending to Dharma and Artha and also to Kama, without becoming the slave of his passions, will obtain success in everything that he may do.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is believed that he must have lived between the 1st and 6th century CE, on the following grounds: He mentions that [[Satakarni]] [[Satavahana]], a king of Kuntal, killed Malayevati his wife with an instrument called Katamari by striking her in the passion of love. Vatsyayana quotes this case to warn people of the danger arising from some old customs of striking women when under the influence of sexual passion. This king of Kuntal is believed to have lived and reigned, consequently Vatsyayana must have lived after him. On the other hand, another author, [[Varahamihira]], in the eighteenth chapter of his "Brihatsanhita", discusses of the science of love, and appears to have borrowed largely from Vatsyayana on the subject. Varahamihira is believed to have lived during the 6th century, and therefore Vatsyayana must have written his works before the 6th century.
