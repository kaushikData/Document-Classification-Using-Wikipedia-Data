[[Access to public information in Europe|Access to public information]] and [[freedom of information]] (FOI) refer to the right of access to information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' [[accountability]], boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.

On 13 January 2011, the ''[[Verkhovna Rada]]'' (the Parliament of Ukraine) adopted two laws on access to information: The Law of Ukraine “On Access to Public Information”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/laws/ukraine-the-law-on-access-to-public-information.pdf|title=THE LAW OF UKRAINE On Access to Public Information|last=|first=|date=2011|website=article19.org|publisher=Article 19|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the new wording of the Law of Ukraine “On Information” (1992).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://zakon0.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/2657-12|title=Law No. 2938-VI On Information|last=|first=|date=2011|website=zakon0.rada.gov.ua|publisher=Holos Ukrainy official daily|language=Ukrainian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They entered into force on May 9, 2011.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://merlin.obs.coe.int/iris/2011/3/article30.en.html|title=Ukraine- Law on Access to Public Information Adopted|last=Shevchenko|first=Taras|date=March 2011|website=merlin.obs.coe.int|publisher=IRIS Merlin|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Art. 5 of the Law of Ukraine "On Information" provides the «right for information» which includes the possibility of free collection, usage, distribution, storage and protection of information necessary for the exercise of person’s rights, freedoms and legitimate interests&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=3158729|title=The Information Law of Ukraine|last=Kormych|first=Borys|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=|location=Odesa|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Both of the laws were criticized in 2012 by the London-based association advocating for free expression [[Article 19]], which considered that they lack provisions to ensure that the [[Right to privacy|rights to privacy]] and [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] and information are appropriately balanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/3391/en/ukraine:-data-protection-act-and-related-legislation|title=Ukraine: Data Protection Act and related legislation|last=|first=|date=July 26, 2012|website=article19.org|publisher=ARTICLE 19|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freedominfo.org/2012/07/ukraine-access-data-laws-criticized-by-article-19/|title=Ukraine Access, Data Laws Criticized by Article 19|last=|first=|date=July 30, 2012|website=freedominfo.org|publisher=Freedominfo.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 9, 2015, the Ukrainian Parliament approved a law to encourage government agencies to release and provide more information from the country’s archive of Soviet-era [[KGB]] files. The information would be transferred to the Institute of National Remembrance and be declassified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freedominfo.org/2015/04/ukraine-passes-open-data-bill-soviet-files-available/|title=Ukraine Passes Open Data Bill; Soviet Files Available|last=|first=|date=April 30, 2015|website=freedominfo.org|publisher=Freedominfo.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/ukraines-parliament-votes-open-soviet-era-kgb-archives-public-1876756|title=Ukraine’s Parliament Votes To Open Soviet-Era KGB Archives To Public|last=Lynch|first=Dennis|date=September 4, 2015|website=ibtimes.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the same law  encourages to publish free operational data, statistics and reports on government websites and on the national open data web platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.gov.ua/|title=National open data web platform|last=|first=|date=|website=data.gov.ua|language=Ukrainian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 27, 2014, the Parliament of Ukraine passed the draft law No. 0947. According to experts, it makes a variety of improvements related to access to information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cedem.org.ua/en/Analytics/373/|title=Centre for Democracy and Rule of Law (CEDEM)|last=|first=|date=|website=cedem.org.ua|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, fines are added for ungrounded refusals to disclose information, for an untimely or incomplete provision of information, or the provision of false information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freedominfo.org/2014/04/amendments-approved-ukrainian-access-law/|title=Amendments Approved to Ukrainian Access Law|last=|first=|date=April 18, 2014|website=freedominfo.org|publisher=Freedominfo.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Independent Reporting Mechanism]] (IRM) of the [[Open Government Partnership]] (OPG) organization &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opengovpartnership.org/irm/irm-reports|title=IRM Reports|last=|first=|date=|website=opengovpartnership.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 2016, Ukraine’s progress for improving access to information, corruption prevention mechanisms, and bringing citizens in government decision making is “truly impressive”- especially considering the difficult political situation.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opengovpartnership.org/blog/open-government-partnership/2016/03/21/new-report-ukraine-finds-progress-access-information|title=NEW REPORT ON UKRAINE FINDS PROGRESS IN ACCESS TO INFORMATION, BUT MORE EFFORTS ARE NEEDED IN GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY|last=|first=|date=March 21, 2016|website=opengovpartnership.org|publisher=Open Government Partnership|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the IRM,  the country fell short in delivering on promises made to improve government accountability and fight corruption. In particular, according to an expert, Ukraine needs to further open public contracting, including in publicly owned enterprises, and to bring more transparency to natural resource extraction.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; According to IRM, also, in its next [[OPG National Plan]], Ukraine should provide for among its commitments for a system of electronic disclosure so that public officials’ assets are verifiable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opengovpartnership.org/country/ukraine/irm|title=Ukraine- Progress Reports|last=|first=|date=|website=opengovpartnership.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7293">The '''ambient optic array''' is the structured arrangement of [[light]] with respect to a point of observation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trincoll.edu/depts/ecopsyc/perils/folder5/terms.html Terms Used in Ecological Optics]&lt;/ref&gt; American psychologist [[James J. Gibson]] posited the existence of the ambient optic array as a central part of his [[ecological psychology|ecological approach to optics]]. For Gibson, perception is a [[Top-down and bottom-up design|bottom-up process]], whereby the agent accesses information about the environment directly from invariant structures in the ambient optic array, rather than recovering it by means of complex cognitive processes. More controversially, Gibson claimed that agents can also directly pick-up the various [[affordance]]s of the environment, or opportunities for the observer to act in the environment, from the ambient optic array.&lt;ref name="Noë"&gt;Noë, A. (2004). 3.9 Gibson, Affordences and the Ambient Optic Array. ''Action In Perception ''(pp. 103-106). Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The optic array as reflected angles of light==
Gibson stressed that the environment is not composed of geometrical solids on a plane, as in a painting, but is instead best understood as objects nested within one another and organized hierarchically by size. The ambient optic array, therefore, is also organized hierarchically by size, though the components are the [[solid angles]] from the object to the point of observation. Large solid angles come from the facades of various objects and interspaces between objects in the environment. Smaller solid angles are nested within the larger angles, and detail the facets and finer properties of the object. As the observer explores the environment, her relation to these angles change, and accordingly the appearance of the environment changes. For example, objects appear to grow larger or smaller depending on whether the observer moves towards or away from the object. This is because the angle [[subtended angle|subtended]] by the object to the observer becomes bigger as the observer gets closer, and smaller as the observer recedes. However the objective size of the actual object in the environment never changes.&lt;ref name="Gibson"&gt;Gibson, J. J. (1986). ''The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception''. Hillsdale (N.J.): Lawrence Erlbaum Associates&lt;/ref&gt; Put simply by philosopher [[Alva Noë]], the ambient optic array is "how things look from here in these conditions."&lt;ref name="Noë"/&gt;

==Invariants and direct perception ==
Gibson was interested in the structures of the ambient optic array that are invariant, or structures that remain static regardless of the actions of the observer. For example Gibson noted that the upper hemisphere of the array (the sky) tends to be much less structured and brighter than the lower hemisphere (the cluttered earth). No matter what the observer does, the light will always be structured in this way.&lt;ref name="Reed"&gt;Reed, E. (1996). 4. ''Encountering the World: Toward An Ecological Psychology'' (pp. 48-49). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; He also noticed that "[[optical flow]] patterns", or optical flow invariants, are produced in the array as the agent moves about the environment. The above example of objects "growing" or "shrinking" as an observer moves towards or away from them is an example of an optical flow invariant, as the array will always transform like this under those conditions. Gibson hypothesized that agents evolved to ''directly'' access relevant [[information]] about themselves and the environment from the invariant structures in the array, without the need for high level cognitive computations.&lt;ref name="Gibson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Braisby"&gt;Braisby, N., &amp; Cellatly, A. (2012). 3.3 Flow in the ambient optic array. ''Cognitive Psychology'' (2nd ed., pp. 78-79). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, in the aforementioned case of objects appearing to grow or shrink, no cognitive processes mediate the observer sensing the apparent growth in size of the object and the observer perceiving that she has now moved toward the object (or the object has moved toward her).

These invariant properties are linked with Gibson's idea of [[affordance]]s. According to Gibson, an affordance is a property of the environment, much like color and size are. For an animal with the appropriate physiological equipment, a tree affords the ability to climb up it, or the ground the ability to walk upon it. Therefore, he claimed, affordances are also specified in the ambient optic array. This means that not only can an agent directly perceive that there is a horizontal surface or that a tree is a tree, but that a horizontal surface is "walk-on-able" or that a tree is "climb-up-able".&lt;ref name="Noë"/&gt; In fact, the agent's perceptual system is so attuned to the invariant information, Gibson argues, that the agent need not consult any of its prior experiences in order to interact with the environment.&lt;ref name="Braisby"/&gt; This implies that agents pick-up meaning and value directly from the environment, rather than project it onto the world.

== Criticism ==
Many critics have rejected at least some of Gibson's claims. Psychologist [[Richard Gregory]] asserted that Gibson's bottom-up approach to perception is incomplete. He argued that visual illusions like the [[Necker cube]] are the result of the brain's indecision between two equally plausible hypotheses about the cube's orientation. The cube appears to "flip" between these two orientations even though the sensory information remains static. Therefore, Gregory reasoned that top-down processes must mediate perception. In response, Gibson argued that illusions like the Necker cube are the result of artifice and would not be encountered by agents in realistic perceptual situations, and therefore are irrelevant. However, the [[Motion aftereffect|waterfall illusion]] is an example of a naturally occurring illusion and cannot be accounted for by Gibson's theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simplypsychology.org/perception-theories.html Visual Perception Theory]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, these two approaches can be reconciled. For example, [[Ulric Neisser]] developed the perceptual cycle, which involves top-down and bottom-up perceptual processes interacting and informing each other. The processes are causally linked, but of equal importance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://learngen.org/~aust/EdTecheBooks/AECT_HANDBOOK96/08/08-05.html The perceptual cycle.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, [[David Marr (neuroscientist)|David Marr]] claimed that Gibson had profoundly underestimated the intricacy of visual information processing. While useful information may exist directly in the ambient optic array, Gibson does not elaborate on the mechanisms of the direct pick-up of this information. Marr argues that this is a complex information processing problem, and not as simple as Gibson makes it out to be.&lt;ref&gt;Noë, A., &amp; Thompson, E. (2002). 11: Selections from Vision. Vision and mind: ''Selected Readings in the Philosophy of Perception'' (pp. 264-265). Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eduard Kurzbauer - The Dispute - Walters 37102.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''The Dispute'' by [[Eduard Kurzbauer]]]]

'''Annoyance''' is an unpleasant [[Mood (psychology)|mental state]] that is characterized by such effects as [[Irritability|irritation]] and [[distraction]] from one's [[thought|conscious thinking]]. It can lead to [[emotion]]s such as [[frustration]] and [[anger]]. The property of being easily annoyed is called [[irritability]].

==Psychology==
Various reasons exist for why one finds particular stimuli annoying. Measurement of annoyance is highly subjective. As an attempt at measurement, psychological studies on annoyance often rely on their subjects' own ratings of levels of annoyance on a scale. Any kind of stimuli can cause annoyance, such as getting poked in the side or listening to a song repeatedly.  Many stimuli that one is at first neutral to, or even finds pleasant, can turn into annoyances from repeated continued exposure.  One can often encounter this phenomenon with such media as [[popular music]], [[meme]]s, [[commercials]], and [[jingle|advertising jingles]], which by their very nature are continually repeated over a period of weeks or months.

A study published in the ''International Journal of Conflict Management'' found that one's response to an annoyance, at least when the perceived cause is another person, escalate to more extreme levels as they go unresolved.&lt;ref&gt;Dean G Pruitt, John C Parker, Joseph M Mikolic. "Escalation as a reaction to persistent annoyance.", ''International Journalists of Conflict Management.'' Bowling Green: July 1997, Vol 8, Issue 3; pg. 252&lt;/ref&gt; It also found that one was more likely to blame the party who was causing the annoyance in the study, rather than one's self, for the annoyance as it escalated.

[[Psychological warfare]] can involve creating annoyances to distract and wear down the resistance of the target. For example, in 1993, the United States' [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) played music "specifically selected for its irritation ability" on loudspeakers outside the [[Branch Davidian]] church in [[Waco, Texas]] in an attempt to bring about the surrender of [[David Koresh]] and his followers.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Potok. "FBI grinds away at cult", ''USA Today'', April 14, 1993, pg. 1A.&lt;/ref&gt;

==English law==
In the sense of "nuisance", the noun "annoyance" is found in the English "Jury of Annoyance" appointed by an act of 1754 to report upon obstructions in the [[highway]]s.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Annoy|volume=2|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7905">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[category theory]], the '''category of sets''', denoted as '''Set''', is the [[Category (mathematics)|category]] whose [[Category theory|objects]] are [[Set (mathematics)|sets]].  The arrows or [[morphism]]s between sets ''A'' and ''B'' are the [[total function]]s from ''A'' to ''B'', and the composition of morphisms is the [[Function composition|composition of functions]].

Many other categories (such as the [[category of groups]], with [[group homomorphisms]] as arrows) add structure to the objects of the category of sets and/or restrict the arrows to functions of a particular kind.

==Properties of the category of sets==
The axioms of a category are satisfied by '''Set''' because composition of functions is [[Associative property|associative]], and because every set ''X'' has an [[identity function]] ''id&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; : X → X'' which serves as identity element for function composition.

The [[epimorphism]]s in '''Set''' are the [[surjective]] maps, the [[monomorphism]]s are the [[injective]] maps, and the [[isomorphism]]s are the [[bijective]] maps.

The [[empty set]] serves as the [[initial object]] in '''Set''' with [[empty function]]s as morphisms.  Every [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] is a [[terminal object]], with the functions mapping all elements of the source sets to the single target element as morphisms. There are thus no [[zero object]]s in '''Set'''. 

The category '''Set''' is [[complete category|complete and co-complete]]. The [[product (category theory)|product]] in this category is given by the [[cartesian product]] of sets. The [[coproduct (category theory)|coproduct]] is given by the [[disjoint union]]: given sets ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; where ''i'' ranges over some index set ''I'', we construct the coproduct as the union of ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;×{''i''} (the cartesian product with ''i'' serves to ensure that all the components stay disjoint).

'''Set''' is the prototype of a [[concrete category]]; other categories are concrete if they are "built on" '''Set''' in some well-defined way.

Every two-element set serves as a [[subobject classifier]] in '''Set'''. The power object of a set ''A'' is given by its [[power set]], and the [[exponential object]] of the sets ''A'' and ''B'' is given by the set of all functions from ''A'' to ''B''. '''Set''' is thus a [[topos]] (and in particular [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]] and [[Regular_category#Exact_%28effective%29_categories|exact in the sense of Barr]]).

'''Set''' is not [[abelian category|abelian]], [[additive category|additive]] nor [[preadditive category|preadditive]].

Every non-empty set is an [[injective object]] in '''Set'''. Every set is a [[projective module|projective object]] in '''Set''' (assuming the [[axiom of choice]]).

The [[Accessible category|finitely presentable objects]] in '''Set''' are the finite sets. Since every set is a [[direct limit]] of its finite subsets, the category '''Set''' is a [[Accessible category|locally finitely presentable category]].

If ''C'' is an arbitrary category, the [[Contravariant functor|contravariant functors]] from ''C'' to '''Set''' are often an important object of study. If ''A'' is an object of ''C'', then the functor from ''C'' to '''Set''' that sends ''X'' to Hom&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'',''A'') (the set of morphisms in ''C'' from ''X'' to ''A'') is an example of such a functor. If ''C'' is a small category (i.e. the collection of its objects forms a set), then the contravariant functors from ''C'' to '''Set''', together with natural transformations as morphisms, form a new category, a [[functor category]] known as the category of [[presheaves]] on ''C''.

==Foundations for the category of sets==

In [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] the collection of all sets is not a set; this follows from the [[axiom of foundation]]. One refers to collections that are not sets as [[proper class]]es. One cannot handle proper classes as one handles sets; in particular, one cannot write that those proper classes belong to a collection (either a set or a proper class). This is a problem: it means that the category of sets cannot be formalized straightforwardly in this setting. Categories like '''Set''' whose collection of objects forms a proper class are known as [[Large category|large categories]], to distinguish them from the small categories whose objects form a set. 

One way to resolve the problem is to work in a system that gives formal status to proper classes, such as [[NBG set theory]]. In this setting, categories formed from sets are said to be ''small'' and those (like '''Set''') that are formed from proper classes are said to be ''large''.

Another solution is to assume the existence of [[Grothendieck universe]]s. Roughly speaking, a Grothendieck universe is a set which is itself a model of ZF(C) (for instance if a set belongs to a universe, its elements and its powerset will belong to the universe).  The existence of Grothendieck universes (other than the empty set and the set &lt;math&gt;V_\omega&lt;/math&gt; of all [[hereditarily finite set]]s) is not implied by the usual ZF axioms; it is an additional, independent axiom, roughly equivalent to the existence of [[strongly inaccessible cardinal]]s. Assuming this extra axiom, one can limit the objects of '''Set''' to the elements of a particular universe. (There is no "set of all sets" within the model, but one can still reason about the class ''U'' of all inner sets, i.e., elements of ''U''.)

In one variation of this scheme, the class of sets is the union of the entire tower of Grothendieck universes. (This is necessarily a [[proper class]], but each Grothendieck universe is a set because it is an element of some larger Grothendieck universe.) However, one does not work directly with the "category of all sets". Instead, theorems are expressed in terms of the category '''Set'''&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt; whose objects are the elements of a sufficiently large Grothendieck universe ''U'', and are then shown not to depend on the particular choice of ''U''. As a foundation for [[category theory]], this approach is well matched to a system like [[Tarski–Grothendieck set theory]] in which one cannot reason directly about proper classes; its principal disadvantage is that a theorem can be true of all '''Set'''&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt; but not of '''Set'''.

Various other solutions, and variations on the above, have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Mac Lane 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feferman 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blass 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

The same issues arise with other concrete categories, such as the [[category of groups]] or the [[category of topological spaces]].

{{Family law}}
A '''contact centre''' is a neutral place where children of separated families can enjoy contact with their non-resident parents and sometimes other family members, in a comfortable and safe environment. Child contact services are classified into two distinct categories, supported and supervised (which handle cases with safeguarding issues). Its primary role is to support and promote contact between those [[parent]]s, grandparents, guardians and children that do not have a [[Residence in English family law|Residence Order]] (non-resident parent).

Use of a contact centre may be ordered by a [[family court]] in cases where:
*contact is being resumed after a break and there are concerns raised by the resident parent.
*when there are allegations by either party of
**[[domestic violence]] or [[spousal abuse]]
**[[child abuse]] either; [[sexual abuse]], emotional abuse or [[physical abuse]]
**[[neglect]]
*where there is [[parental alienation]] present or where one of the parties involved in the dispute has an [[implacable hostility]] toward another.
*where this has been deemed necessary by a [[Custody Evaluator|custody evaluator]] or child welfare officer for welfare reasons, for evaluation purposes or else as a result of an abuse of power.

==United Kingdom==
The centres are local projects, run by a range of organisations, including community groups, charities, social enterprises, companies and local authorities. The first contact centre in England opened in 1985 and the first centres in [[Scotland]] opened in 1988.

The National Association of Child Contact Centres is the supporting membership body for around 350 child contact centres and services located throughout England (including the Channel Isles), [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naccc.org.uk/]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the largest in Europe. Centres in Scotland are run by Relationships Scotland]. A Nottingham [[Magistrate (England and Wales)|magistrate]], Mary Lower, founded the first child contact centre for private law in 1985. She went on to form the National Association in 1991, continued her involvement as President until she died in 2017. [[James Munby|Sir James Munby]] is now NACCC's President supported by two Vice Presidents ([[Baroness McIntosh of Pickering]] and Sir [[Mark Hedley]]) and Patron - Sir [[Andrew McFarlane (judge)|Andrew McFarlane]] (President of the Family Division and Head of Family Justice). Now an established charity and company limited by guarantee, NACCC has a board of trustees chaired by Hazel Hedley. The staff team are led by the Chief Executive, Elizabeth Coe.

Families either apply direct to go to a child contact centre direct or are referred by family [[Solicitor|solicitors]], family [[mediation|mediators]], [[social worker]]s or [[Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service|CAFCASS]] officers.

==Australia==
Children's Contact Services (CCS) are funded under the [[Government of Australia]]'s "Family Relationship Services Program" (FRSP). The services help with handover of children and also provide supervised contact.

As of 1 February 2004 there were 35 FRSP-funded Children's Contact Services and a number of non-Australian Government funded services.

==Israel==
In Israel there are the largest number of contact centers per capita in the world, 84 for a population of 8 million. There are no contact centers in the non-Jewish areas.
2500 men are sent to contact centers every year, approximately 40% of all divorces.
Conditions are drastic and all forms of abuse take place with no report to the legal courts.

{{Rights |Distinctions}}

Some [[philosophy|philosophers]] and [[political science|political scientists]] make a distinction between '''claim rights''' and '''liberty rights'''. A ''claim right'' is a [[rights|right]] which entails responsibilities, duties, or obligations on other parties regarding the right-holder. In contrast, a ''liberty right'' is a right which does not entail obligations on other parties, but rather only freedom or permission for the right-holder&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.christendom-awake.org/pages/may/rights.html|title=THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A RIGHT AND A LIBERTY by Prof. William E. May|website=www.christendom-awake.org|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The distinction between these two senses of "rights" originates in American jurist [[Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld]]'s analysis thereof in his seminal work ''Fundamental Legal Conceptions, As Applied in Judicial Reasoning and Other Legal Essays''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MurUEJL/2005/9.html|title=Hohfeld's Analysis of Rights: An Essential Approach to a Conceptual &amp; Practical Understanding of the Nature of Rights - [2005] MurUEJL 9|website=classic.austlii.edu.au|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Liberty rights and claim rights are the inverse of one another: a person has a liberty right permitting him to do something only if there is no other person who has a claim right forbidding him from doing so; and likewise, if a person has a claim right against someone else, that other person's liberty is thus limited. This is because the [[deontic logic|deontic]] concepts of obligation and permission&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Tappolet|first=Christine|title=Evaluative vs. Deontic Concepts|date=2013-02-01|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/9781444367072.wbiee118|encyclopedia=International Encyclopedia of Ethics|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781444367072.wbiee118|isbn=9781405186414|accessdate=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; are [[De Morgan dual]]; a person is permitted to do all and only the things he is not obliged to refrain from, and obliged to do all and only the things he is not permitted to refrain from.

==Overview==
A person's ''liberty right to x'' consists in his freedom to do or have ''x'', while a person's ''claim right to x'' consists in an obligation on others to allow or enable him to do or have ''x''. For example, to assert a ''liberty right'' to [[Freedom of speech|free speech]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aclu.org/issues/free-speech|title=Free Speech|work=American Civil Liberties Union|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/topic/free-speech|title=Free Speech|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is to assert that you have permission to speak freely; that is, that you are not doing anything wrong by speaking freely. But that liberty right does not in itself entail that others are obligated to help you communicate the things you wish to say, or even that they would be wrong in preventing you from speaking freely. To say these things would be to assert a ''claim right'' to free speech; to assert that others are obliged to refrain (i.e. prohibited) from preventing you from speaking freely (that is, that it would be wrong for them to do so) or even perhaps obliged to aid your efforts at communication (that is, it would be wrong for them to refuse such aid). Conversely, such claim rights do not entail liberty rights; e.g. laws prohibiting [[vigilante justice]] (establishing a legal claim right to be free thereof) do not thereby condone or permit all the acts which such violent enforcement might otherwise have prevented.

To illustrate, a world with only liberty rights, without any claim rights, would by definition be a world wherein everything was permitted and no act or omission was prohibited; a world wherein none could rightly claim that they had been wronged or neglected. Conversely, a world with only claim rights and no liberty rights would be a world wherein nothing was merely permitted, but all acts were either obligatory or prohibited. The assertion that people have a claim right to liberty – i.e. that people are obliged only to refrain from preventing each other from doing things which are permissible, their liberty rights limited only by the obligation to respect others' liberty – is the central thesis of [[Liberalism|liberal]] theories of [[justice]].

==Second-order rights==
Hohfeld's original analysis included two other types of right: besides ''claims'' (or ''rights'' proper) and ''liberties'' (or ''privileges''), he wrote of ''powers'', and ''immunities''. The other two terms of Hohfeld's analysis, ''powers'' and ''immunities'', refer to second-order liberties and claims, respectively. Powers are liberty rights regarding the modification of first-order rights, e.g. the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] has certain powers to modify some of U.S. citizens' [[legal rights]], inasmuch as it can impose or remove legal duties. Immunities, conversely, are claim rights regarding the modification of first-order rights, e.g. U.S. citizens have, per their [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], certain immunities limiting the positive powers of the U.S. Congress to modify their legal rights&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billofrightsinstitute.org/founding-documents/additional-amendments/|title=Additional Amendments - Bill of Rights Institute|work=Bill of Rights Institute|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As such, immunities and powers are often subsumed within claims and liberties by later authors, or grouped together into "active rights" (liberties and powers) and "passive rights" (claims and immunities)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freedman|first=R.|date=2014-02-01|title=UN Immunity or Impunity? A Human Rights Based Challenge|url=https://academic.oup.com/ejil/article/25/1/239/497359|journal=European Journal of International Law|language=en|volume=25|issue=1|pages=239–254|doi=10.1093/ejil/cht082|issn=0938-5428}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

These different types of rights can be used as building blocks to explain relatively complex matters such as a particular piece of property. For example, a right to use one's computer can be thought of as a liberty right, but one has a power right to let somebody else use your computer (granting them a liberty right), as well as a claim right against others using the computer; and further, you may have ''immunity rights'' protecting your claims and liberties regarding the computer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26248">'''Cognitive specialization''' suggests that certain behaviors, often in the domain of social communication, are passed on to offspring and refined to be maximally beneficial by the process of natural selection. Specializations serve an [[adaptive]] purpose for an organism by allowing the organism to be better suited for its habitat. Over time, specializations often become essential to the species' continued survival.  Cognitive specialization in humans has been thought to underlie the acquisition, development, and evolution of [[language]], [[theory of mind]], and specific social skills such as [[trust (social sciences)|trust]] and [[reciprocity (evolution)|reciprocity]]. These specializations are considered to be critical to the survival of the species, even though there are successful individuals who lack certain specializations, including those diagnosed with [[autism spectrum disorder]] or who lack language abilities.&lt;ref name="Povinelli 1995"&gt;Povinelli D., Preuss T (1995). Theory of mind: evolutionary history of a cognitive specialization, Trends in Neurosciences, Volume 18, Issue 9, Pages 418–424, ISSN 0166-2236, doi:10.1016/0166-2236(95)93939-U. {{PMID|7482808}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive specialization is also believed to underlie adaptive behaviors such as [[self-awareness]], [[navigation]], and problem solving skills in several animal species such as [[chimpanzees]] and [[bottlenose dolphins]].

== Background ==
First studied as an adaptive mechanism specific to humans,&lt;ref name="Povinelli 1995" /&gt; cognitive specialization has since evolved to encompass many behaviors in the social realm. Organisms have evolved over millions of years to become well-adapted to their [[habitats]]; this requires becoming specialized in behaviors that improve an organism’s likelihood of survival and reproduction. Not to be confused with [[functional specialization (brain)|functional specialization]], which examines the specific parts of the brain that are engaged during specific behaviors or processes,&lt;ref&gt;Mahon, B. Z., &amp; Cantlon, J. F. (2011). The specialization of function: Cognitive and neural perspectives. Cognitive neuropsychology, 28(3–4), 147–155. doi:10.1080/02643294.2011.633504 {{PMID|22185234}}&lt;/ref&gt; cognitive specialization is focused on characteristics of the mind (an internal entity), which in turn affects external behaviors. Most of these specializations are thought to have developed in areas of the [[neocortex]] unique to humans.&lt;ref&gt;Pinker, S. (1994). The language instinct: The new science of language and mind (Vol. 7529). Penguin UK.&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant cognitive specializations among humans include theory of mind and language acquisition and production, while non-human animals may specialize in [[foraging]] behavior,&lt;ref&gt;Toth, A. Robinson, G. (2007). Evo-devo and the evolution of social behavior, Trends in Genetics, Volume 23, Issue 7, Pages 334–341, ISSN 0168-9525 doi: 10.1016/j.tig.2007.05.001 {{PMID|17509723}}&lt;/ref&gt; self-awareness, or other adaptive abilities.

== Social behavior ==
Social communication is critical to effective human interaction, and has evolved over time to support the complex exchange of ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Tooby, J., Cosmides, L., &amp; Price, M. E. (2006). Cognitive adaptations for n‐person exchange: the evolutionary roots of organizational behavior. Managerial and Decision Economics, 27(2–3), 103–129. {{PMID|23814325}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, S. (2006). Cognition at the heart of human interaction. Discourse Studies, 8(1), 85–93&lt;/ref&gt; Some social behaviors, such as helping and [[wikt:altruism|altruism]], are largely unique to humans and are instrumental in ensuring the survival of the species.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, H. C., Cosmides, L., &amp; Tooby, J. (2010) Coevolution of cooperation, causal cognition and mindreading. Communicative &amp; integrative biology, 3(6), 522–4. {{PMID|21331228}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[evolutionary psychology|Evolutionary psychologists]] [[Leda Cosmides]] and [[John Tooby]] argue that the human mind contains "specialized mechanisms" that were designed by natural selection to facilitate social communication and exchange.&lt;ref name="Cosmides Tooby 1992"&gt;Cosmides, L., &amp; Tooby, J. (1992). Cognitive adaptations for social exchange. The adapted mind, 163–228. doi: 10.1073/pnas.122352999&lt;/ref&gt; Without this specialized "[[algorithm]]",&lt;ref name="Cosmides Tooby 1992" /&gt; Cosmides and Tooby claim, social exchange among humans would be closer to that of our closest evolutionary ancestors, the great apes. In addition to humans' broad abilities supporting positive social interaction, Stone et al. (2002) put forth evidence for more specific specializations including "cheater detection" and "precautionary reasoning," both of which appear to serve strong adaptive purposes by allowing humans to share resources with only those who are likely to share with them in the future, and avoid sharing resources with untrustworthy individuals.&lt;ref name="Stone"&gt;Stone, V. E., Cosmides, L., Tooby, J., Kroll, N., &amp; Knight, R. T. (2002) Selective impairment of reasoning about social exchange in a patient with bilateral limbic system damage. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 99(17), 11531–11536. doi  10.1073/pnas.122352699 {{PMID|12177408}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the adaptiveness of social communication has been examined in children, adults, and older adults,&lt;ref&gt;Povinelli, D. J., Prince, C. G., &amp; Preuss, T. M. (2005). Parent-Offspring Conﬂict and the Development of Social Understanding.

If social behavior is to be considered a cognitive specialization unique to human neural architecture, it should be present in every human society.&lt;ref name="Shiw" /&gt; To provide cross-cultual evidence that cognitive adaptations specifically support social communication, Sugiyama, Tooby, and Cosmides  investigated social reasoning in a tribe in the Ecuadorian Amazon.&lt;ref name="Shiw" /&gt; The Shiwiar, who are a hunter-horticulturalist group previously unexposed to the presented psychological stimuli, were "as highly proficient" in determining who cheated in a given situation as their counterparts in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Shiw" /&gt; This performance indicates that social communication, at least in the domain of cheater detection, is not determined by one's culture. According to Sugiyama, Tooby, and Cosimdes, the social "algorithms" discussed above are present in both Western and non-Western populations, providing strong evidence for the universality of such a skill.&lt;ref name="Cosmides Tooby 1992" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shiw" /&gt;

== Theory of mind ==
[[Theory of mind]], or the ability to attribute mental states to other people, is thought to be a cognitive specialization unique to humans, with a few possible exceptions discussed below.&lt;ref&gt;Heyes, C.M. (1998). Theory of mind in nonhuman primates. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 21, pp 101-114. doi 10.1017/s0140525x98000703 {{PMID|10097012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jellema, T., Baker, C. I., Wicker, B., &amp; Perrett, D. I. (2000). Neural representation for the perception of the intentionality of actions. Brain and cognition, 44(2), 280–302. doi 10.1006/brcg.2000.1231 {{PMID|11041992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theory of mind is thought to be critical in social cognition and communication because it allows us to distinguish between [[Vagrancy (biology)|accidental]] and purposeful actions, to make judgments about others' internal states, and to determine how another's thoughts may differ from our own.&lt;ref name ="Povinelli 1995" /&gt; The acquisition of theory of mind in humans mostly takes place during early childhood, and is thought to be fully developed by the early school years.&lt;ref&gt;Wellman, H. M., Cross, D., &amp; Watson, J. (2001). Meta‐analysis of theory‐of‐mind development: the truth about false belief. Child development, 72(3), 655–684. {{PMID|11405571}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theory of mind research in [[chimpanzees]] by social psychologists [[David Premack]] and Guy Woodruff in 1978 brought it to the forefront of psychological inquiry, though true theory of mind is only thought to exist in humans.&lt;ref&gt;Premack, D., and Woodruff, G. (1978). Does the chimpanzee have a theory of mind? Behav. Sci. 4: 515–526&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon has been analyzed in many fields, and it is thought to be among the most beneficial specializations for survival of the human species, due to its facilitation of [[cooperation]] and interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Pinker, S. (1999). How the mind works. Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 882(1), 119–127.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In autism ===
Theory of mind appears to be lacking in children with [[autism| autism spectrum disorders]], and this deficit is thought to be a major contributor to frequent impairments in some areas of social understanding in people with autism.&lt;ref name="Baron"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baron-Cohen | first1 = Simon | last2 = Leslie | first2 = Alan M. | last3 = Frith | first3 = Uta | title = Does the autistic child have a "theory of mind"? | journal = [[Cognition (journal)|Cognition]] | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 37&amp;ndash;46 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(85)90022-8 | pmid = 2934210 | date = October 1985 | url = https://doi.org/10.1016/0010-0277(85)90022-8 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20170928145836/http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/images/personal-alan-leslie/publications/Baron-Cohen%20Leslie%20&amp;%20Frith%201985.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that a [[developmental delay]] in (or absence of) theory of mind can impair social functioning—a skill imperative in the survival of the human species—is argued to be evidence for theory of mind as an adaptive cognitive specialization.&lt;ref name="Baron" /&gt; Understanding that others may be thinking different thoughts than I am (colloquially, "putting oneself in another person's shoes") allows humans to communicate effectively and to live in large [[social groups]]. This adaptability is what makes theory of mind a cognitive specialization, rather than just another byproduct of [[human evolution]]: humankind has unique and beneficial communication skills, and this is partially due to our ability to recognize that other people may not think or know the same things we do.&lt;ref name="Povinelli 1995" /&gt;

== Language ==
Though some (including Bates et al.&lt;ref&gt;Bates, E., Thal, D., &amp; Marchman, V. (1991). Symbols and syntax: A Darwinian approach to language development. Biological and behavioral determinants of language development, 29, 66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pink"&gt;Pinker, S. (2003). Language as an adaptation to the cognitive niche. STUDIES IN THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE, 3, 16–37.&lt;/ref&gt;) have argued that language arose as a byproduct of the evolution of humans' general cognitive abilities, [[Steven Pinker]] argues that it is, on its own, an adaptive mechanism. Drawing on existing literature and theory, he proposes several types of evidence for this claim, including the universality and [[ontogeny]] of language. Pinker also uses the [[double dissociation]] between general intelligence and language to argue for language as a specific adaptation. Those who lose language capabilities due to [[traumatic brain injury]] or [[stroke]] but maintain many other cognitive abilities exemplify Pinker's idea that language and general cognition are not always perfectly overlapping in human behavior.&lt;ref name="Pink" /&gt; Using language "multiplies the benefit of knowledge" in multiple domains, including technology, tool use, and intentions of ourselves and others.&lt;ref name="Pink" /&gt;

=== Evolution ===
Arbib puts forth a hypothesis that [[mirror neurons]] in the primate brain were a precursor to language abilities in humans.&lt;ref name="Arbib"&gt;Arbib, M. A. (2005). From monkey-like action recognition to human language: An evolutionary framework for neurolinguistics. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 28(02), 105–124 {{PMID|16201457}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without these neurons in [[Broca's area]] in humans (which is analogous to F5 in monkeys), Arbib claims, we could not have evolved a specialization for language—which is used to explain why non-human animals do not have linguistic capabilities.&lt;ref name="Arbib" /&gt; In addition, Meguerditchian and Vauclair have argued that our evolutionary ancestors' communicative [[gestures]] (such as threat gestures and "food begs" among [[baboons]]) established a foundation on which to build human language skills.&lt;ref&gt;Meguerditchian, A., &amp; Vauclair, J. (2009). Contrast of hand preferences between communicative gestures and non-communicative actions in baboons: Implications for the origins of hemispheric specialization for language. Brain and language, 108(3), 167–174. {{PMID|19091390}}&lt;/ref&gt; This behavior was selected for, built upon, and modified, leading to the capabilities humans have today. Early theories explained early language as an adaptive way to communicate during a [[hunting|hunt]], but recent research has focused on [[ecological]] theories that incorporate social demands; or, as Flinn et al. put it, a "social [[arms race]]" against non-human primates.&lt;ref name = Flinn&gt;Flinn, M. V., Geary, D. C., &amp; Ward, C. V. (2005). Ecological dominance, social competition, and coalitionary arms races: Why humans evolved extraordinary intelligence. Evolution and Human Behavior, 26(1), 10–46.&lt;/ref&gt; As a behavior selected for over the long term, with many successful "intermediary stages," human language differs from all other social behaviors among chimpanzees, which are thought to be more gradual in their evolutionary development.&lt;ref name="Flinn" /&gt; Further evidence for language as a cognitive specialization includes Ferreira et al.'s finding that some parts of language (for instance, [[syntax]]) can be spared in [[amnesia]], while other abilities (like [[memory]] retention) are drastically reduced.&lt;ref name="Fer"&gt;Ferreira, V. S., Bock, K., Wilson, M. P., &amp; Cohen, N. J. (2008). Memory for syntax despite amnesia. Psychological science, 19(9), 940–946. {{PMID|18947361}}&lt;/ref&gt; This and similar dissociations support the theory that specific neural architecture, which has evolved over time, supports language function.&lt;ref name="Fer" /&gt;

=== Universal Grammar ===
Linguist [[Noam Chomsky]] proposed a biological component of language, which he termed [[Universal Grammar]].&lt;ref name="Chom"&gt;Chomsky, N. (1972). Language and mind (p. 100). New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Chomsky, an essential part of language processing is hard-wired into the human brain. This allows language to be produced with or without specific linguistic instruction (which is closely associated with the [[poverty of the stimulus]] argument).&lt;ref name="Chom" /&gt;  All humans—and only humans—have this biological trait, but building blocks of universal grammar have been reported in other species.&lt;ref&gt;Marc D. Hauser; Noam Chomsky; W. Tecumseh Fitch (November 22, 2002). "The Faculty of Language: What Is It, Who Has It, and How Did It Evolve?". Science 298 (5598): 1569–1579. doi 10.1126/science.298.5598.1569. {{PMID|12446899}} {{PMID|12446899}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackendoff argues that Universal Grammar is itself a "pre-existing cognitive specialization":&lt;ref name="Jack"&gt;Jackendoff, R. (2001). Language in the ecology of mind. The Routledge companion to semiotics and linguistics, 52–65.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than needing explicit instruction on how to speak their native language, or having [[vocabulary]] and syntactical rules of a specific language present in their brains from birth, children seem to be [[genetically]] pre-disposed to ''learn'' language.&lt;ref name="Jack" /&gt; Complementary to the connection made between area F5 in macaques' brains,&lt;ref name="Arbib" /&gt; the theory of Universal Grammar allows for an evolutionary perspective on language use as a cognitive specialization. There is some controversy, however, on whether or not Universal Grammar can have evolved by standard Darwinian evolutionary principles, or must be explained using different mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Hinzen, Wolfram (September 2012). "The philosophical significance of Universal Grammar". Language Sciences 34 (5): 635–649. doi:10.1016/j.langsci.2012.03.005.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benefits ===
According to Nowak and Sigmund, language is essential to human life as we know it.&lt;ref name="NS"&gt;Nowak, M. A., &amp; Sigmund, K. (2005). Evolution of indirect reciprocity. Nature, 437(7063), 1291–1298 {{PMID|16251955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without the ability to verbally communicate with members of our social group, there would be no [[Reciprocity (evolution)|reciprocity]] (that is, returning of favors), and no way to cooperate with one another for a greater good.&lt;ref name="NS" /&gt; Some have argued that unique aspects of human language have evolved for unexpectedly beneficial reasons, besides simply asking for help or sharing information about the world. [[Gossip]], viewed by many &lt;ref name="gossip"&gt;Miller, G. (2011). The mating mind: How sexual choice shaped the evolution of human nature. Random House LLC. doi:10.1525/aa.2001.103.4.1196&lt;/ref&gt; to be a superfluous aspect of human communication, may even serve an adaptive purpose. The spread of information about other people, even if it is malicious, may serve as an indicator of social intelligence and a way to deter [[wikt:illicit|illicit]] behaviors.&lt;ref name="gossip" /&gt; Though gossip likely helps some humans and hinders others' [[social standing]], it appears to be an overall benefit of the ability to produce verbal language.&lt;ref name="gossip" /&gt; Without an overall specialization for language (including such sub-specializations as gossip), [[linguists]] argue, humans would not be able to share information efficiently and effectively.&lt;ref name="NS" /&gt;

== Other possible specializations ==
Watson et al. provide support for a specific specialization in language-dependent [[humor]].&lt;ref&gt;Watson, K. K., Matthews, B. J., &amp; Allman, J. M. (2007). Brain activation during sight gags and language-dependent humor. Cerebral Cortex, 17(2), 314–324. {{PMID|16514105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[adaptive]] value has both [[extrinsic]] and [[intrinsic]] components: humor facilitates social bonding if shared extrinsically, and provides pleasure if enjoyed in one's own mind. In addition, Johnson-Frey (2003) proposed a unique human specialization for tool use.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Frey, S. H. (2003). What's so special about human tool use?. Neuron, 39(2), 201–204. doi:10.1016/s0896-6273(03)00424-0 {{PMID|12873378}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Johnson-Frey, humans' ability to use tools is based on complex cognitive mechanisms, not just advanced [[motor skill|sensorimotor]] skills. Rather than it being considered a purely physical specialization based only in [[motor areas]] of the brain, Johnson-Frey argues that tool use should be classified as a cognitive phenomenon due to its foundation in cognition. On a more [[philosophical]] level, Boyer (2003) argues that "[[religious]] thought and behavior" is a specialization that originally developed as a by-product of brain function, and its adaptive purposes led to its continued evolution by [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, P. (2003). Religious thought and behavior as by-products of brain function. Trends in cognitive sciences, 7(3), 119–124. {{PMID|12639693}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krueger et al. (2007) have argued that trust, which may form the foundation for helping and altruism and thus the basis of human social interaction, is also a cognitive specialization.&lt;ref&gt;Krueger, F., McCabe, K., Moll, J., Kriegeskorte, N., Zahn, R., Strenziok, M., &amp; Grafman, J. (2007). Neural correlates of trust. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 104(50), 20084–20089. doi 10.1073/pnas.0710103104 {{PMID|18056800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-human specialization ==

=== In non-human primates ===
Humankind’s closest ancestors, the [[great apes]], have evolved a number of specialized behaviors: [[orangutans]] are specialists at climbing trees, while [[chimpanzees]] and [[gorillas]] have evolved to walk on their knuckles.&lt;ref name="Povinelli 1995" /&gt; However, in considering non-behavioral specializations, Penn et al. (2008) argue that the "profound continuity" [[Charles Darwin]] noted between human and non-human animals in the biological domain is matched by a "profound discontinuity" between human and non-human animal minds.&lt;ref&gt;Penn, D. C., Holyoak, K. J., &amp; Povinelli, D. J. (2008). Darwin's mistake: Explaining the discontinuity between human and nonhuman minds. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 31(02), 109–130. {{PMID|18479531}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, in addition to cognitive-behavioral adaptations, it is possible that chimpanzees have acquired more socially advanced skills through natural selection, including self-recognition (indicated by chimpanzees' established ability to pass the "[[mirror test]]").&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Heyes (1998). Theory of mind in nonhuman primates. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 21, pp 101–114. {{PMID|10097012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This task—in which a successful trial is simply one in which an animal recognizes itself in a mirror—is thought to be a basic building block of theory of mind development.&lt;ref&gt;Povinelli, D. J., Eddy, T. J., Hobson, R. P., &amp; Tomasello, M. (1996). What young chimpanzees know about seeing. Monographs of the society for research in child development, i–189. doi 10.2307/1166159 {{PMID|8795292}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rhesus monkeys]] have also been shown to realize when they remember certain events and items, which is considered to be an instrumental building block in the formation of social relationships, as one must remember who owes him favors, who he can trust, and who he should avoid in order to prosper in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Hampton, R. R. (2001). Rhesus monkeys know when they remember. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 98(9), 5359–5362. doi 10.1073/pnas.071600998 {{PMID|11274360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In other animals ===
More recent evidence has shown that cognitive specialization is not just present in [[primates]]: domesticated [[dogs]] may show signs of understanding human behavior and communication, indicating a social-cognitive specialization that is argued to make them more likely to receive food, shelter and love from their human owners. Being receptive to human behavioral indicators and responding accordingly has allowed dogs to survive and thrive as a [[species]].&lt;ref&gt;Hare, B., Tomasello, M. (2005) Human-like social skills in dogs?, Trends in Cognitive Sciences, Volume 9, Issue 9, pages 439–444, ISSN 1364-6613 {{PMID|16061417}} doi 10.1016/j.tics.2005.07.003&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bottlenose dolphins]] and [[elephants]] have also been shown to pass the "mirror test" explained above. This indication of some elementary self-awareness provides more evidence for foundational theory of mind skills in organisms throughout the [[Animal|animal kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Marten, K. &amp; Psarakos, S.

{{Economics sidebar}}
'''Complexity economics''' is the application of [[complex system|complexity science]] to the problems of [[economics]]. It sees the economy not as a system in equilibrium, but as one in motion, perpetually constructing itself anew.&lt;ref&gt;W. Brian Arthur, Complexity and the Economy, Oxford: Oxford Economic Press, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beinhocker"&gt;Beinhocker, Eric D. The Origin of Wealth: Evolution, Complexity, and the Radical Remaking of Economics. Boston, Massachusetts: Harvard Business School Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It uses computational rather than mathematical analysis to explore how economic structure is formed and reformed, in continuous interaction with the adaptive behavior of the 'agents' in the economy &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0dGLEreBrM&lt;/ref&gt;

== Models ==

The "nearly archetypal example" is an artificial [[stock market]] model created by the [[Santa Fe Institute]] in 1989.&lt;ref name=Rosser1999/&gt; The model shows two different outcomes, one where "agents do not search much for [[Dependent and independent variables|predictors]] and there is convergence on a homogeneous rational expectations outcome" and another where "all kinds of technical trading strategies appearing and remaining and periods of [[economic bubble|bubbles]] and crashes occurring".&lt;ref name=Rosser1999/&gt;

Another area has studied the [[prisoner's dilemma]], such as in a network where agents play amongst their nearest neighbors or a network where the agents can make mistakes from time to time and "evolve strategies".&lt;ref name=Rosser1999/&gt; In these models, the results show a system which displays "a pattern of constantly changing distributions of the strategies".&lt;ref name=Rosser1999/&gt;

More generally, complexity economics models are often used to study how non-intuitive results at the macro-level of a system can emerge from simple interactions at the micro level.  This avoids assumptions of the [[representative agent]] method, which attributes outcomes in collective systems as the simple sum of the rational actions of the individuals.

== Measures ==

=== Economic complexity index ===
MIT physicist [[César Hidalgo]] and Harvard economist [[Ricardo Hausmann]] introduced a spectral method to measure the complexity of a country's economy by inferring it from the structure of the network connecting countries to the products that they export. The measure combines information of a country's [[diversity index|diversity]], which is positively correlated with a country's productive knowledge, with measures of a product ubiquity (number of countries that produce or export the product).&lt;ref name="HidalgoHausmannPNAS"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hidalgo|first=Cesar A.|author2=Hausmann Ricardo|title=The Building Block of Economic Complexity|journal=PNAS|year=2009|issue=106(26)|pages=10570–10575|pmid=19549871|doi=10.1073/pnas.0900943106|pmc=2705545|volume=106|arxiv=0909.3890|bibcode=2009PNAS..10610570H}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ComplexityAtlas"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hausmann &amp; Hidalgo|title=The Atlas of Economic Complexity: Mapping Paths to Prosperity|year=2011|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0615546625|url=http://atlas.media.mit.edu/static/pdf/atlas/AtlasOfEconomicComplexity.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept, known as the [[The Product Space|"Product Space"]], has been further developed by MIT's [[The Observatory of Economic Complexity|Observatory of Economic Complexity]], and in The Atlas of Economic Complexity&lt;ref name=ComplexityAtlas /&gt; in 2011.

==== Relevance ====

The [[economic complexity index]] (ECI) introduced by Hidalgo and Hausmann&lt;ref name=HidalgoHausmannPNAS /&gt;&lt;ref name=ComplexityAtlas /&gt; is highly predictive of future GDP per capita growth.

[[Luciano Pietronero|Pietronero]] and collaborators have recently proposed a different approach.&lt;ref name=metricsfitness1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tacchella|first=Andrea|title=A New Metrics for Countries' Fitness and Products' Complexity|journal=Scientific Reports|date=10 October 2012|volume=2|issue=723|doi=10.1038/srep00723|url=http://www.nature.com/srep/2012/121010/srep00723/full/srep00723.html|display-authors=etal|bibcode=2012NatSR...2E.723T}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=metricsfitness2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cristelli|first=Matthieu|title=Measuring the Intangibles: A Metrics for the Economic Complexity of Countries and Products|journal=PLOS ONE|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0070726|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0070726|display-authors=etal|volume=8|pages=e70726|pmid=23940633|pmc=3733723|bibcode=2013PLoSO...870726C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=metricsflyer&gt;{{cite web|title=Economic Complexity: Measuring the Intangibles.

Differently from the linear algorithm giving rise to the ECI, this non-linearity is a key point to properly deal with the nested structure of the data. The authors of this alternative formula claim it has several advantages:

* Consistency with the empirical evidence from the export country-product matrix that diversification plays a crucial role in the assessment of the competitiveness of countries. The metrics for countries proposed by Pietronero is indeed extensive with respect to the number of products.
* Non-linear coupling between fitness and complexity required by the nested structure of the country-product matrix. The nested structure implies that the information on the complexity of a product must be bounded by the producers with the slowest fitness. 
* Broad and [[Pareto distribution|Pareto]]-like distribution of the metrics.
* Each iteration of the method refines information, does not change the meaning of the iterated variables and does not shrink information.

The metrics for country fitness and product complexity have been used in a report&lt;ref name=fitnessmtricsBCG&gt;{{cite web|title=National Strategy for Sweden: From Wealth to Well-being|url=http://www.bcg.se/expertise_impact/publications/publicationdetails.aspx?id=tcm:106-145990|publisher=BCG|accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of the [[Boston Consulting Group]] on [[Sweden]] growth and development perspectives.

==Features==
[[W. Brian Arthur|Brian Arthur]], [[Steven N. Durlauf]], and [[David A. Lane (scientist)|David A. Lane]] describe several features of complex systems that deserve greater attention in economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first1 = Brian | last1 = Arthur | author1-link = W.

# '''Dispersed interaction'''—The economy has interaction between many dispersed, heterogeneous, agents. The action of any given agent depends upon the anticipated actions of other agents and on the aggregate state of the economy.
# '''No global controller'''—Controls are provided by mechanisms of competition and coordination between agents. Economic actions are mediated by legal institutions, assigned roles, and shifting associations. No global entity controls interactions. Traditionally, a fictitious ''auctioneer'' has appeared in some mathematical analyses of general equilibrium models, although nobody claimed any descriptive accuracy for such models.  Traditionally, many mainstream models have imposed ''constraints'', such as requiring that budgets be balanced, and such constraints are avoided in complexity economics.
# '''Cross-cutting hierarchical organization'''—The economy has many levels of organization and interaction. Units at any given level behaviors, actions, strategies, products typically serve as "building blocks" for constructing units at the next higher level. The overall organization is more than hierarchical, with many sorts of tangling interactions (associations, channels of communication) across levels.
# '''Ongoing adaptation'''—Behaviors, actions, strategies, and products are revised frequently as the individual agents accumulate experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shiozawa | first1 = Y. | year = 2004 | title = Evolutionary Economics in the 21st Century: A Manifest | url = | journal = Evolutionary and Institutional Economics Review | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 5–47 | doi=10.14441/eier.1.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Novelty niches'''—Such niches are associated with new markets, new technologies, new behaviors, and new institutions. The very act of filling a niche may provide new niches. The result is ongoing novelty.
# '''Out-of-equilibrium dynamics'''—Because new niches, new potentials, new possibilities, are continually created, the economy functions without attaining any optimum or global equilibrium. Improvements occur regularly.

==Contemporary trends in economics==
Complexity economics has a complex relation to previous work in economics and other sciences, and to contemporary economics. Complexity-theoretic thinking to understand economic problems has been present since their [[inception]] as [[academic discipline]]s. Research has shown that no two separate micro-events are completely isolated,&lt;ref name="AFC-NA-21"&gt;[[Albert-Laszlo Barabasi]] {{cite web |title =  explaining ''(at 27:07)'' that no two events are completely isolated in the BBC Documentary |work = BBC  |url=http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/six-degrees-of-separation/|publisher= |page =  |accessdate=11 June 2012}} "Unfolding the science behind the idea of six degrees of separation"&lt;/ref&gt; and there is a relationship that forms a [[macroeconomic]] structure. However, the relationship is not always in one direction; there is a reciprocal influence when feedback is in operation.&lt;ref name="CAS-T-06"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psych.lse.ac.uk/complexity/Papers/Ch2final.pdf|title= Page 20 - Ten Principles of Complexity &amp; Enabling Infrastructures |publisher= by Professor Eve Mitleton-Kelly, Director Complexity Research Programme, London School of Economics |accessdate=1 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complexity economics has been applied to many fields.

===Intellectual predecessors===
Complexity economics draws inspiration from [[behavioral economics]], [[Marxian economics]], [[institutional economics]]/[[evolutionary economics]], [[Austrian economics]] and the work of [[Adam Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=29 July 2012
|url=http://sandcat.middlebury.edu/econ/repec/mdl/ancoec/0804.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also draws inspiration from other fields, such as [[statistical mechanics]] in physics, and [[evolutionary biology]]. Some of the 20th century intellectual background of complexity theory in economics is examined in Alan Marshall (2002) The Unity of Nature, Imperial College Press: London. See Douma &amp; Schreuder (2017) for a non-technical introduction to Complexity Economics and a comparison with other economic theories (as applied to markets and organizations).

===Applications===
The theory of complex dynamic systems has been applied in diverse fields in economics and other decision sciences. These applications include [[capital theory]],&lt;ref name=Rosser1983&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosser Jr | first1 = J.

Saari]].&lt;ref name=Saari2001&gt;Saari, Donald G. ''Chaotic Elections: A Mathematician Looks at Voting''. American Mathematical Society (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Complexity economics has attracted the attention of historians of economics.&lt;ref name=Bausor1994&gt;Bausor, Randall.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; Ben Ramalingam's [[Aid on the Edge of Chaos]] includes numerous applications of complexity economics that are relevant to [[aid|foreign aid]].

===Complexity economics as mainstream, but non-orthodox===
According to {{harvtxt|Colander|2000}}, {{harvtxt|Colander|Holt|Rosser|2004}}, and {{harvtxt|Davis|2008}} contemporary [[mainstream economics]] is evolving to be more "eclectic",&lt;ref name=COL2000a&gt;"Economists today are not neoclassical according to any reasonable definition of the term. They are far more eclectic, and concerned with different issues than were the economists of the early 1900s, whom the term was originally designed to describe." {{harvtxt|Colander|2000|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=COL2000b&gt;"Modern economics involves a broader world view and is far more eclectic than the neoclassical terminology allows." {{harvtxt|Colander|2000|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; diverse,&lt;ref name=CHR04a&gt;"In our view, the interesting story in economics over the past decades is the increasing variance of acceptable views..." {{harvtxt|Colander|Holt|Rosser|2004|p=487}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CHR04b&gt;"In work at the edge, ideas that previously had been considered central to economics are being modified and broadened, and the process is changing the very nature of economics." {{harvtxt|Colander|Holt|Rosser|2004|p=487}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CHR04c&gt;"When certain members of the existing elite become open to new ideas, that openness allows new ideas to expand, develop, and integrate into the profession... These alternative channels allow the mainstream to expand, and to evolve to include a wider range of approaches and understandings... This, we believe, is already occurring in economics." {{harvtxt|Colander|Holt|Rosser|2004|pp=488–489}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pluralism in economics|pluralistic]].&lt;ref name=DAV2008a&gt;"despite an increasing pluralism on the mainstream&amp;nbsp;economics research&amp;nbsp;frontier..." {{harvtxt|Davis|2008|p=353}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvtxt|Colander|Holt|Rosser|2004}} state that contemporary mainstream economics is "moving away from a strict adherence to the holy trinity – rationality, selfishness, and equilibrium", citing complexity economics along with [[recursive economics]] and [[dynamical system]]s as contributions to these trends.&lt;ref name=CHR04d&gt;{{harvtxt|Colander|Holt|Rosser|2004|p=485}}&lt;/ref&gt; They classify complexity economics as now  mainstream but [[Heterodox economics|non-orthodox]].&lt;ref name=CHR04e&gt;"The second (Santa Fe) conference saw a very different outcome and atmosphere than the first. No longer were mainstream economists defensively adhering to general equilibrium orthodoxy... By 1997, the mainstream accepted many of the methods and approaches that were associated with the complexity approach." {{harvtxt|Colander|Holt|Rosser|2004|p=497}} {{harvtxt|Colander|Holt|Rosser|2004|pp=490–492}} distinguish between orthodox and mainstream economics.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DAV2008b&gt;{{harvtxt|Davis|2008|p=354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
In 1995-1997 publications, ''[[Scientific American]]'' journalist John Horgan "ridiculed" the movement as being the fourth ''C'' among the "failed fads" of  "[[complexity]], [[chaos theory|chaos]], [[catastrophe theory|catastrophe]], and [[cybernetics]]".&lt;ref name=Rosser1999/&gt; In 1997, Horgan wrote that the approach had "created some potent metaphors: the [[butterfly effect]], [[fractal]]s, [[artificial life]], the [[edge of chaos]], [[self organized criticality]].  But they have not told us anything about the world that is both concrete and truly surprising, either in a negative or in a positive sense."&lt;ref name=Rosser1999&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosser Jr | first1 = J. Barkley | year = 1999 | title = On the Complexities of Complex Economic Dynamics | url = | journal = Journal of Economic Perspectives | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 169–192 | doi=10.1257/jep.13.4.169}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Horgan | first1 = John | year = 1995 | title = From Complexity to Perplexity | url = | journal = Scientific American | volume = 272 | issue = 6| pages = 104–09 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0695-104| bibcode = 1995SciAm.272f.104H}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Horgan, John, The End of Science: Facing the Limits of Knowledge in the Twilight of the Scientific Age. Paperback ed, New York: Broadway Books, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosser "granted" Horgan "that it  is hard to identify a concrete and surprising discovery (rather than "mere metaphor") that has arisen due to the emergence of complexity analysis" in the discussion journal of the [[American Economic Association]], the ''[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]]''.&lt;ref name=Rosser1999/&gt;  Surveying economic studies based on complexity science, Rosser wrote that the findings, rather than being surprising, confirmed "already-observed facts."&lt;ref name=Rosser1999/&gt; Rosser wrote that there has been "little work on empirical techniques for testing dispersed&amp;nbsp;agent complexity&amp;nbsp;models."&lt;ref name=Rosser1999/&gt; Nonetheless, Rosser wrote that "there is a strain of common perspective that has been accumulating as the four C's of cybernetics, catastrophe, chaos, and complexity emerged, which may now be reaching a critical mass in terms of influencing the thinking of economists more broadly."&lt;ref name=Rosser1999/&gt;

[[File:CrowdsAndPower.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. Claassen Verlag)]]
'''''Crowds and Power''''' ({{lang-de|Masse und Macht}}) is a 1960 book by [[Elias Canetti]], dealing with the dynamics of [[crowd]]s and "packs" and the question of how and why crowds obey [[power (social and political)|power]] of rulers. Canetti draws a parallel between ruling and paranoia. Also, the memoirs of [[Daniel Paul Schreber]] are analyzed with an implicit critique of [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Gustave Le Bon]].

The book was translated from German into English by Carol Stewart in 1962 and published by [[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz]].

It is notable for its unusual tone; although wide-ranging in its erudition, it is not scholarly or academic in a conventional way. Rather, it reads like a manual written by someone outside the human race explaining to [[alterity|another]] outsider in concise and highly metaphoric language how people form mobs and manipulate power. Unlike much non-fiction writing, it is highly poetic and seething with anger.

On asking questions:
"On the questioner the effect is a feeling of enhanced power. He enjoys this and consequentially asks more and more questions; every answer he receives is an act of [[submission]]. Personal freedom consists largely in having a defense against questions. The most blatant tyranny is the one which asks the most blatant questions."&lt;ref&gt;''Crowds and Power,'' p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;

This work remains important for the insights it provided into the [[Revolutions of 1989|Eastern European upheaval]] which can be understood within the framework Canetti puts forth.&lt;ref&gt;''Kiss (2004)'', p.730&lt;/ref&gt; Showing the growth of crowds and their power against even the power of the state.

'''Decolonizing Architecture Art Residency''' (DAAR) is an architectural studio and a residency program based in [[Beit Sahour]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. DAAR’s work combines spatial interventions, theoretical writings and collective learning. DAAR is dedicated to architectural experimentations on the reuse and transformation of [[colonial architecture]], settlements, [[Military base|military bases]], 1948 cleansed Palestinian villages, primarily in Palestine. DAAR was founded in 2007 in Beit Sahour near [[Bethlehem]] by Alessandro Petti, Sandi Hilal and [[Eyal Weizman]].

of the most difficult dilemmas of political practice: how to act both propositionally and critically in an environment in which the political force fields, as complex as they may be, are so dramatically skewed.

You will not find here descriptions of popular uprising, armed resistance, or political negotiations, despite these of course forming an integral and necessary part of any radical political transformation. Instead, the authors present a series of provocative projects that try to imagine “the morning after revolution.”&lt;ref name="sternberg-press.com"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4523">A '''disability pretender''' is [[subculture]] term meaning a person who behaves as if he or she were disabled. It may be classified as a type of [[factitious disorder]] or as a [[medical fetishism]].

One theory{{cn|date=January 2018}} is that pretenders may be the "missing link" between devotees and wannabes, demonstrating an assumed continuum between those merely [[attraction to disability|attracted to people with disabilities]] and those who actively wish to become disabled. Many wannabes use pretending as a way to appease the intense emotional pain related to having [[body integrity identity disorder]].

Pretending takes a variety of forms. Some [[chatroom]] users on internet sites catering to devotees have complained that chat counterparts they assumed were female were revealed as male devotees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transabled.org/thoughts/other-thoughts/chloes-thoughts/pretence-and-authenticity.htm#more-7656 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425035041/http://transabled.org/thoughts/other-thoughts/chloes-thoughts/pretence-and-authenticity.htm#more-7656 |title=Pretence and Authenticity |author=Chloe |date=April 18, 2013 |archivedate=25 April 2013 |publisher=transabled.org » Blogging about BIID |accessdate=27 October 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of pretending (where a devotee derives pleasure by pretending to be a disabled woman) may indicate a very broad predisposition to pretending among devotees.

Pretending includes dressing and acting in ways typical of disabled people, including making use of aids ([[Walking sticks]], [[crutches]],  [[wheelchair]]s, [[mobility scooters]], [[white cane]]s, etc). Pretending may also take the form of a devotee persuading his or her sexual partner to play the role of a disabled person. Pretending may be practised in private, in intimacy, or in public, and may occupy surprisingly long periods. In the latter case, some pretenders hope that the disability may become permanent, such as through tissue [[necrosis]] caused by constricted blood supply.

People with this condition may refer to themselves as "transabled".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baril|first1=Alexandre|last2=Trevenen|first2=Kathryn|title=Transabled women lost in translation?

'''Dismemberment''' is the act of cutting, tearing, pulling, wrenching or otherwise removing the limbs of a living thing. It has been practised upon human beings as a form of capital punishment, especially in connection with [[regicide]], but can occur as a result of a traumatic accident, or in connection with murder, suicide, or cannibalism. As opposed to [[surgical]] [[amputation]] of the limbs, dismemberment is often fatal to all but the simplest of creatures. In [[criminology]], a distinction is made between offensive and defensive dismemberment.  Intentional, criminal dismemberment is known as ''mayhem''.

==History==

===Cut apart===
;Sliced to pieces by elephant
Particularly in South-Eastern Asia, [[Execution by elephant|execution by trained elephants]] was a form of capital punishment practiced for several centuries. The techniques by which the convicted person was actually executed varied widely but did, on occasion, include the elephant dismembering the victim by means of sharp blades attached to its feet. The Muslim traveller [[Ibn Battuta]], visiting Delhi in the 1330s, has left the following eyewitness account of this particular type of execution by elephants:&lt;ref&gt;Battuta, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=IZ5CAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intitle:The+intitle:travels+intitle:of+intitle:Ibn+intitle:Battuta&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8K36UOuaLImF4gTe4YDoAw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The travels of Ibn Battuta]", transl. Lee, S, London 1829, pp. 146–47&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|"Upon a certain day, when I myself was present, some men were brought out who had been accused of having attempted the life of the Vizier. They were ordered, accordingly, to be thrown to the elephants, which had been taught to cut their victims to pieces. Their hoofs were cased with sharp iron instruments, and the extremities of these were like knives. On such occasions the elephant-driver rode upon them: and, when a man was thrown to them, they would wrap the trunk about him and toss him up, then take him with the teeth and throw him between their fore feet upon the breast, and do just as the driver should bid them, and according to the orders of the Emperor. If the order was to cut him to pieces, the elephant would do so with his irons, and then throw the pieces among the assembled multitude: but if the order was to leave him, he would be left lying before the Emperor, until the skin should be taken off, and stuffed with hay, and the flesh given to the dogs."|sign=|source=}}
;Quartering procedure in the Holy Roman Empire
[[File:Tiradentes escuartejado (Tiradentes supliciado) by Pedro Américo 1893.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Tiradentes|Tiradentes Quartered]]'', [[Pedro Américo]] (1893)]]
In the [[Holy Roman Empire]] emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]'s 1532 [[Constitutio Criminalis Carolina]] specifies how ''every'' dismemberment (quartering) should ideally occur:&lt;ref&gt;German original "Zu der Viertheylung: Durch seinen gantzen Leib zu vier stücken zu schnitten und zerhawen, und also zum todt gestrafft werden soll, und sollen solche viertheyl auff gemeyne vier wegstrassen offentlich gehangen und gesteckt werden"&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|"Concerning quartering: To cut and hack apart his entire body into four pieces, and thus be punished unto death, and such four parts are to be hanged on stakes publicly on four common thorough-fares."|sign=|source=}}
Thus, the imperially approved way to dismember the convict within the Holy Roman Empire was by means of ''cutting'', rather than dismemberment through ''ripping'' the individual apart. In paragraph 124 of the same code, beheading prior to quartering is mentioned as allowable when extenuating circumstances are present, whereas aggravating circumstances may allow pinching/ripping the criminal with glowing pincers, prior to quartering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Koch|first=Johann Christoph|title=Hals- oder peinliche Gerichtsordnung Kaiser Carls V. und des H. Röm. Reichs nach der Originalausgabe vom J. 1533 auf das genaueste abgedruckt und mit der zweiten und dritten Ausgabe v. J. 1533 und 1534 verglichen|publisher=J.C. Krieger|year=1824|location=Marburg|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q_o6AAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=no#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|pages=91, 60|accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fate of [[Wilhelm von Grumbach]] in 1567, a maverick knight in the Holy Roman Empire who was fond of making his own private wars and was thus condemned for treason, is also worthy of note. Gout-ridden, he was carried to the execution site in a chair and bound fast to a table. The executioner then ripped out his heart, and stuck it in von Grumbach's face with the words: "von Grumbach! Behold your false heart!" Afterwards, the executioner quartered von Grumbach's body. His principal associate was given the same treatment, and an eyewitness avers (confirms)&lt;!--Note that this word "avers" is not a mistake; it means "affirms".--&gt; that ''after'' his heart had been ripped out, Chancellor Brück screamed horribly for "quite some time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ortloff|first=Friedrich|title=Geschichte der Grumbachischen Händel, Volume 4|publisher=Friedrich Frommann|year=1870|location=Jena|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qw9TAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA156|pages=156–158|accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of a highly aggravated execution is illustrated by the fate of Bastian Karnhars on 16 July 1600. Karnhars was found guilty of 52 separate acts of murder, including the rape and murder of 8 women, and the murder of a child, whose heart he had allegedly eaten for rituals of black magic. To begin, Karnhars had three strips of flesh torn from his back, before being pinched 18 times with glowing pincers, having his fingers clipped off one by one, his arms and legs [[broken on the wheel]], and finally, while still alive, quartered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Becherer|first=Johann|title=Neue Thüringische Chronica|publisher=Martin Spiess|year=1601|location=Müllhausen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fds-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA648|pages=648|accessdate=2013-03-24}} See also the 3-day long torture and execution method of [[Peter Niers]], who was executed in 1581 for 544 murders, including the murder of 24 women and their fetuses, the latter to be used in rituals of black magic.&lt;/ref&gt;
;A fabled Turkish execution method
In the seventeenth century, a number of travel reports speak of an exotic "Turkish" execution method, where first, the waist of a man was constricted by ropes and cords, and then a swift bisection of the trunk was performed. [[William Lithgow (traveller and author)|William Lithgow]] presents a comparatively prosaic description of the method:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lithgow|first=William|title=The Totall Discourse, of the Rare Aduentures, and Painefull Peregrinations of Long Nineteene Yeares Trauayles from Scotland, to the Most Famous Kingdomes in Europe, Asia, and Affrica|publisher=Nicholas Okes|year=1632|location=London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=41oj3JOOUAwC&amp;pg=PA153|pages=153|accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|"If a Turke should happen to kill another Turke (...) he is brought forth to the market place, and a blocke being brought hither of foure foote high; the malefactor is stripd naked; and then layd thereupon with his belly downeward, they drawe in his middle together so small with running cords, that they strike his body a two with one blow: his hinder parts they cast to be eaten by hungry dogges kept for the same purpose; and the forequarters and head they throw into a grievous fire, made there for the same end .-and this is the punishment for man-slaughter."|sign=|source=}}
[[George Sandys]], however, during the same period, tells of a method as no longer in use, in a rather more mythologized way:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sandys|first=George|title=A Relation of a Journey Begun an Dom. 1610. Foure Bookes Coutaining a Description of the Turkish Empire, of Aegypt, of the Holy Land, of the Remote Parts of Italt, and Islands Adjoyning|publisher=W.

{{quote|"...they twitch the offender about the waist with a towell, enforcing him to draw up his breath by often pricking him in the body, until they have drawn him within the compasse of a span; then tying it hard, they cut him off in the middle, and setting the body on a hot plate of copper, which seareth the veines, they so up-propping him during their cruell pleasure: who not only retaineth his sense, but the faculties of discourse, until he be taken downe; and then he departeth in an instant."|sign=|source=}}
;Shekkeh in Persia
In 1850s Persia, a particular dismemberment technique called ''shekkeh'' is reported to have been used. Travelling as an official for the [[East India Company]] Robert Binning&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docs.is.ed.ac.uk/docs/lib-archive/bgallery/Gallery/records/eighteen/binning.html Robert B.M. Binning] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618214312/http://www.docs.is.ed.ac.uk/docs/lib-archive/bgallery/Gallery/records/eighteen/binning.html |date=18 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; describes it as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Binning|first=Robert B.M.|title=A Journal of Two Years' Travel in Persia, Ceylon, Etc, Volume 1|publisher=Wm.

The two several halves are then suspended on a camel, and paraded through the streets, for the edification of all beholders. When the shekkeh is to be inflicted in a merciful manner, the culprit's head is struck off, previous to bisecting the trunk."|sign=|source=}}

;Korea
Dismemberment was a form of capital punishment for convicts of [[high treason]] in the Korean kingdom of the [[Joseon Dynasty]]. This punishment was, for example, meted out to Hwang Sa-Yong in 1801.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jai-Keun|first=Choi|pages=135|title=The Origin of the Roman Catholic Church in Korea: An Examination of Popular and Governmental Responses to Catholic Missions in the Late Chosôn Dynasty|publisher=The Hermit Kingdom Press|year=2006|location=Norwalk, California|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sydu4aOL-WoC&amp;pg=PA135|isbn=9781596890640|accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;China
[[The Five Pains]] is a Chinese variation invented during the [[Qin dynasty]]. During the [[Tang dynasty]] (618-907 CE), [[Waist chop|truncation of the body at the waist]] by means of a fodder knife was a death penalty reserved for those who were seen to have done something particularly treacherous or repugnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Benn|first=Charles D.|title=China's Golden Age: Everyday Life in the Tang Dynasty|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|location=Oxford|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ile3jSveb4sC&amp;pg=PA210|page=210|isbn=9780195176650|accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; That practice of cutting in two did not originate in the Tang dynasty; in sources concerning the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE-220 CE), no less than 33 cases of execution by cutting at the waist are mentioned, but occurs very rarely in earlier material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[http://www.zo.uni-heidelberg.de/md/zo/sino/institute/staff/kampen/eacs_scholar_hulsewe.pdf Hulsewé]|first=Anthony François Paulus|title=Remnants of Chʻin Law: An Annotated Translation of the Chʻin Legal and Administrative Rules of the 3rd Century B.C.

;Current use
Dismemberment is no longer used by most modern governments as a form of execution or [[torture]], though [[amputation#As a punishment in Islam|amputation]] is still carried out in countries that practice [[Sharia law]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/middleeast/news/article_1371270.php/Saudi_Arabia_chops_off_hand_of_Egyptian_for_theft Saudi Arabia chops off hand of Egyptian for theft] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811044139/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/middleeast/news/article_1371270.php/Saudi_Arabia_chops_off_hand_of_Egyptian_for_theft |date=11 August 2010 }}, 5 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Torn apart===
Dismemberment was carried out in the [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] and [[Early Modern era]] and could be effected, for example, by tying a person's limbs to chains or other restraints, then attaching the restraints to separate movable entities (e.g. vehicles) and moving them in opposite directions.

====Torn apart by four horses====
Also referred to as "disruption" or being "drawn and quartered", dismemberment could be brought about by chaining four horses to the condemned's arms and legs, thus making them pull him apart, as was the case with the executions of [[François Ravaillac]] in 1610 and [[Robert-François Damiens]] in 1757. Ravaillac's extended torture and execution has been described like this:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tapié|first=Victor L.|title=France in the Age of Louis Xiii and Richelieu|publisher=CUP Archive|year=1984|location=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KPM3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA62|pages=62–63|isbn=9780521269247|accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|"He was condemned to be tortured with red-hot pincers on four limbs and on each breast. His wounds were to be sprinkled with molten lead and boiling oil and his body was then to be torn in pieces by four horses, the remains being subsequently burnt."}} 
In the case of Damiens, he was condemned to essentially the same fate as Ravaillac, but the execution did not quite work according to plan, as the eyewitness [[Giacomo Casanova]] could relate:&lt;ref&gt;Described in {{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Irene|title=The A to Z of Punishment and Torture|publisher=Book Guild Publishing|year=2008|location=Brighton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TE2KfBWPAt0C&amp;pg=PA103|pages=103–104|isbn=9781846242038|accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|Damiens' agony went on for hours as each torture was applied. When the horses failed to disconnect the sinews between his body and his limbs, his body, still alive, was quartered with a knife. His friend, the infamous Casanova, reports that he "watched the dreadful sight for four hours." "I was obliged to turn away my face and to stop my ears as I heard his piercing shrieks, half his body having been torn from him."|sign=|source=}} 
[[Image:Tupac amaru execution.jpg|235px|thumb|The execution of [[Túpac Amaru II]], who was dismembered by four horses 18 May 1781.]]
As late as in 1781, this gruesome punishment was meted out to the [[Peruvian people|Peruvian]] rebel leader [[Túpac Amaru II]] by the Spanish colonial authorities. The following is an extract from the official judicial death sentence issued by the Spanish authorities which condemns Túpac Amaru II to torture and death. It was ordered in the sentence that Túpac Amaru II be condemned to have his tongue cut out, after watching the executions of his family, and to have his hands and feet tied...  
{{quote|...to four horses who will then be driven at once toward the four corners of the plaza, pulling the arms and legs from his body. The torso will then be taken to the hill overlooking the city... where it will be burned in a bonfire... Tupac Amaru's head will be sent to Tinta to be displayed for three days in the place of public execution and then placed upon a pike at the principal entrance to the city.

====The fate of Queen Brunhilda====
[[File:Brunhilda.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Execution of Brunhilda, engraving by Paul Girardet after [[Henri Félix Emmanuel Philippoteaux]]]]
Queen [[Brunhilda of Austrasia]], executed in 613, is generally regarded to have suffered the same death, though one account has it that she was tied to the tail of a single horse and thus suffered more of a [[dragging death]]. The [[Liber Historiae Francorum]], an eighth century chronicle, describes her death by dismemberment as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Cited in {{cite book|last=Bitel|first=Lisa M.|title=Women in Early Medieval Europe, 400–1100|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|location=Cambridge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XRudk_NcA7cC&amp;pg=PA83|pages=83|isbn=9780521597739|accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|"Then King [[Chlothar II|Chlothar]] ordered that she be lifted onto a camel and led through the entire army. Then she was tied to the feet of wild horses and torn apart limb from limb. Finally, she died."|sign=|source=}}
The story of Brunhilda being tied to the tail of a ''single'' horse (and then to die in some gruesome manner) is promoted, for example, by Ted Byfield (2003), in which he writes: "Then they tied her to the tail of a wild horse; whipped into frenzy, it kicked her to death"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Byfield|first=Ted|title=Darkness Descends : A.D. 350 to 565, the Fall of the Western Roman Empire|publisher=Christian History Project|year=2003|location=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kZA4wyCSfUAC&amp;pg=PA223|pages=223|isbn=9780968987339|accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cited source for this claim, however, the seventh century "Life of St. Columban" by the monk Jonas, does not support this claim. In paragraph 58 in his work, Jonas just writes: "..but Brunhilda he had placed first on a camel in mockery and so exhibited to all her enemies round about then she was bound to the tails of wild horses and thus perished wretchedly"&lt;ref&gt;Internet History Sourcebooks,[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/columban.asp Medieval Sourcebook: The Life of St. Columban, by the Monk Jonas, (7th Century)], paragraph 58&lt;/ref&gt;

The storyline of Brunhilde being tied to the tail of a single horse and being subsequently ''dragged'' to death has become a classical motif in artistic representations, as can be seen by the included image.

====Torn apart by four ships====
According to [[Olfert Dapper]], a 17th-century Dutchman who meticulously collected reports from faraway countries from seamen and other travelers, a fairly frequent maritime death penalty among the corsairs on the Barbary coast was to affix the hands and feet to chains on four different ships. When the ships then sailed off in different directions, the chains grew taut, and the man in between was torn apart after a while.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book|last=Dapper|first=Olfert|title=Umbstaendliche und eigentliche Beschreibung von Africa|year=1670|publisher=J. von Meurs|location=Amsterdam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oBs-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA167|pages=167|accessdate=2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Torn apart by two trees====
Roman military discipline could be extremely severe, and the emperor [[Aurelian]] (r. 270–275 CE), who had a reputation for extreme strictness, instituted the rule that soldiers who seduced the wives of their hosts should have their legs fastened to two bent-down trees, which were then released, ripping the man in two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sabin|first1=Philip|last2=van Wees|first2=Hans|last3=Whitby|first3=Michael|title=The Cambridge History of Greek and Roman Warfare: Volume 2, Rome from the Late Republic to the Late Empire|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2007|location=Cambridge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4aX-W6AVNv8C&amp;pg=PA439|pages=439|isbn=9780521782746|accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in an unsuccessful rebellion against the emperor [[Valens]] in 366 CE, the usurper [[Procopius (usurper)|Procopius]] met the same fate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mariev|first=Sergei|title=Ioannis Antiocheni fragmenta quae supersunt omnia|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2008|location=Berlin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qY065QbJL7MC&amp;pg=PA374|pages=374–375|isbn=9783110210316|accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the defeat of [[Darius III]] by [[Alexander the Great]], the Persian monarchy was thrown into turmoil, and Darius was killed. One man, [[Bessus]], claimed the throne as Artaxerxes V, but in 329 BCE, Alexander had him executed. The manner of Bessus' death is rather disputed, and Waldemar Heckel writes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heckel|first=Waldemar|title=The Conquests of Alexander the Great|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2012|location=Cambridge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Chu5MBz1gbQC&amp;pg=PA95|pages=95|isbn= 9781107645394|accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|The exact details of Bessus' death are disputed. He may have been crucified, or torn apart by recoiling trees, or (what is most likely) mutilated before being sent to [[Ecbatana]] for execution.}}
The method of tying people to bent down trees, which are then allowed to recoil, ripping the individual to pieces in the process is, however, mentioned by several travelers to nineteenth century Persia. The British diplomat [[James Justinian Morier]] travelled as a special envoy to the Shah in 1808, and Morier writes the following concerning then prevailing criminal justice:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morier|first=James Justinian|title=A Journey Through Persia, Armenia and Asia Minor, to Constantinople, in the Years 1808 and 1809|publisher=Longman Hurst|year=1812|location=London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KM-Tdt38mAoC&amp;pg=PA204|pages=204|isbn= |accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|..for the King never pardons theft, and orders a convicted thief to be executed instantly. The mode is as follows: two young trees are by main strength brought together at their summits, and there fastened with cords together. The culprit is then brought out, and his legs are tied with ropes, which are again carried up and: fixed to the top of the trees. The cords that force the trees together are then cut; and, in the elasticity and power of this spring, the body of the thief is torn asunder, and left thus to hang divided on each separate tree. The inflexibility of the King in this point has given to the roads a security, which, in former times, was little known.}}

====Torn apart by stones====
An obscure Christian martyr, Severianus&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heiligenlexikon.de/BiographienS/Secundus_Carpophorus_Victorinus_Severianus.html Secundus, Carpophorus, Victorinus und Severianus]&lt;/ref&gt; was, about the year 300 AD, martyred in the following way, according to one tale: One stone was fastened to his head, another bound to his feet. His middle was then fastened by a rope to the top of a wall, and the stones released from the height. His body was ripped apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Münchhausen|first=Albert F., Freiherr von|title=Die Attribute der Heiligen, alphabetisch geordnet (etc.) Nebst einem Anh.: uber die Kleidung der kath.

====A Christian martyr withstands being torn apart====
During the reign of the Roman Emperor [[Diocletian]] a Christian named Shamuna was, allegedly, torn apart in the following manner:{{quote|The governor immediately ordered that Shamuna should be made to kneel down on one side and that an iron chain should be fastened on his knee. This having been done, he hung him up head downwards by the foot with which he had made him kneel; the other he pulled downwards with a heavy piece of iron, which cannot be described in words: thus endeavouring to rend the champion in two. By this means the socket of the hip-bone was wrenched out of its place and Shamuna became lame.}}
Some time thereafter, Shamuna was taken down from his hanging position, and was beheaded instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0858.htm Martyrdom of Shamuna, Guria and Habib]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Drake Landing Solar Community''' (DLSC) is a [[planned community]] in [[Okotoks]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]], equipped with a [[central solar heating]] system and other energy efficient technology. This heating system is the first of its kind in North America, although much larger systems have been built in northern Europe. The 52 homes in the community are heated with a solar district heating system that is charged with heat originating from solar collectors on the garage roofs and is enabled for year-round heating by underground [[seasonal thermal energy storage]] (STES).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dlsc.ca/ |title=Drake Landing Solar Community |accessdate=2008-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The system was designed to model a way of addressing [[global warming]] and the burning of [[fossil fuels]]. The solar energy is captured by 800 [[solar thermal collector]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.climatechangecentral.com/publications/c3-views/september-2007/case-study-drake-landing-shines-solar|title=Case Study: Drake Landing|author=Climate Change Central|accessdate=2007-02-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516001141/http://www.climatechangecentral.com/publications/c3-views/september-2007/case-study-drake-landing-shines-solar|archivedate=2008-05-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; located on the roofs of all 52 houses' garages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/media/newsreleases/2007/200784_e.htm |title=Unique Community a Model for a Greener, Healthier Canada |author=Natural Resources Canada |authorlink=Natural Resources Canada |accessdate=2008-02-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106023111/http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/media/newsreleases/2007/200784_e.htm |archivedate=2007-11-06 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is billed as the first solar powered subdivision in [[North America]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.okotoks.ca/sustainable/Energy/northamericafirst.asp |title=North America's First Solar Powered Subdivision - Drake Landing |publisher=[[Okotoks|Town of Okotoks]] |accessdate=2008-02-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103002142/http://www.okotoks.ca/sustainable/Energy/northamericafirst.asp |archivedate=2008-01-03 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; although its electricity and transportation needs are provided by conventional sources.

== How it works ==

There are 52 homes in this subdivision that contain an array of 800 solar thermal collectors. These solar collectors are arranged on the roofs of garages located behind the homes. During a typical summer day these collectors can generate 1.5 mega-[[watt]]s of [[Solar water heating|thermal power]]. A [[glycol]] solution (an anti-freeze solution; a mixture of water and non-toxic glycol) is heated by the sun’s energy and travels through insulated piping underground through a trench system to the [[heat exchanger]] within the community’s Energy Centre. This is known as the Solar Collector Loop. The glycol solution then transfers its heat to water located in the short-term storage tanks. The District Heating Loop begins with water being heated in the heat exchanger to a temperature of 40-50&amp;nbsp;°C within the Energy Centre. This lower temperature is more energy efficient, as solar collecting is more compatible with lower temperatures. This increases the total amount of heat available to each home.

In the warmer months the previously heated water is taken from the short-term storage tank to the Borehole Thermal Energy Storage (BTES). The Borehole Thermal Energy Storage unit is 144 holes located {{convert|37|m|ft|abbr=on}} below the ground and stretches over an approximate area of {{convert|35|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter. The water returns to the short-term storage tanks in the Energy Centre to be heated again in order to complete the circuit. During colder months the water from the BTES passes back to the short-term storage tank and is then directed to each home. Similar to a [[Hot water storage tank|hot water tank]], the heated water goes through a heat exchanger that blows air across the warm fan coil. Heat travels from the water to the air and is directed through the house via ductwork. When the temperature reaches that said on the thermostat, an automatic valve shuts off the heat transfer unit.&lt;ref name="dlsc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlsc.ca/|title=Drake Landing Solar Community|work=dlsc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Energy centre ==

The Energy Centre building is a 232 square metre (2,500 square feet) building which began operation in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dlsc.ca/reports/bjul15/DLSC_SHC_2012_final.pdf pg5&lt;/ref&gt; It is home to the short-term storage tanks and most mechanical equipment such as pumps, heat exchangers, and controls. The Solar Collector Loop, the District Heating Loop, and the Borehole Thermal Energy Storage Loop pass through the Energy Centre. Two horizontal water tanks occupy the majority of the space within the Energy Centre. These tanks are {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on}} in diameter and {{convert|36|ft|m|abbr=on}} in length. The remaining space within the Energy Centre houses pumps, valves, heat exchangers and other necessary equipment to operate and control the energy system. These tanks are known as [[Energy storage#Short-term thermal storage.2C as heat or cold|Short-Term Thermal Storage]] (STTS).&lt;ref name="dlsc" /&gt;

== Borehole thermal energy system ==

The Borehole Thermal Energy System is located underground to store large quantities of heat collected in the summer to be used in the winter. It consists of 144 [[boreholes]], which stretch to a depth of {{convert|37|m|ft|abbr=on}}. At the surface the pipes are joined together in groups of six to connect to the Energy Centre. The entire BTES is covered by a layer of insulation, on top of which a park is built. When the heated water is to be stored, it is pumped through the pipe series. The heat is then transferred to the surrounding soil as the water cools and returns to the Energy Centre. When the homes need heat, water flows to the centre of the BTES field and picks up the heat from the surrounding soil. The heated water then goes to the short-term energy tank in the Energy Centre and is pumped through the District Heating Loop to the homes.&lt;ref name="dlsc" /&gt;

== Sponsors and partners ==

This project was conceived by [[Natural Resources Canada]]’s CanmetENERGY in partnership with governmental organizations and Canadian industries. Of the $7 million needed for this project this was the breakdown of funds: 
*$2 million from federal government agencies.
*$2.9 million from the [[Federation of Canadian Municipalities]] and Green Municipal Investment Fund. 
*$625,000 from the Alberta Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canmetenergy.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/canmetenergy.nrcan.gc.ca/files/files/pubs/DrakesLanding(ENG).pdf|title=CanmetENERGY|work=nrcan.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Community members ==

Homeowners were willing to pay for these energy efficient homes because it ensured high quality construction. Until the solar heating system began working, [[ATCO]] Gas (an Alberta-based natural gas distribution company) fixed heating costs at $60 per month for the homeowners at the Drake Landing Solar Community.  With rising fuel costs, this was a powerful incentive for homeowners to support the DLSC project. Even if the project had failed, ATCO Gas would have replaced the special hot-water furnaces with traditional natural gas ones. There was limited risk to the homeowners and this encouraged them to support the project.&lt;ref&gt;http://qspace.library.queensu.ca/bitstream/1974/1696/1/Wamboldt_Jason_M_200901_Master.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Local sustainability ==

The 52 homes in Drake Landing Solar Community are certified to Natural Resource Canada’s [[R-2000 program|R-2000]] Standard as well as the Built Green™ Alberta Gold Standard.

== Costs and financing ==

*Each house sold for an average of $380,000.
*Homeowners are receiving an average of $60 per month solar utility bill for heating.
*$7 million for the initial start up of the Drake Landing Solar Community project.
*If this project were repeated it would cost $4 million, as approximately $3 million was for one-time research and development.
*Optimal community size would be 200-300 homes to realize the economies of scale. The number of systems would remain the same; only the number of boreholes would need to increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canmetenergy.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/canmetenergy.nrcan.gc.ca/files/files/pubs/DrakesLanding(ENG).pdf.|title=CanmetENERGY|work=nrcan.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International effects ==

A group of researchers from South Korea visited Drake Landing Solar Community in April 2012 to study the geothermal heating technology and how it can be applied to communities in South Korea, particularly ahead of the [[2018 Winter Olympics]] in [[Pyeongchang County|Pyeongchang]]. The main focus of this research trip was to learn about the economics and reliability of the technology.&lt;ref name="westernwheel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westernwheel.com/article/20120425/WHE0801/304259996/-1/whe/korean-researchers-learn-from-drake-landing|title=Korean researchers learn from Drake Landing|work=Okotoks Western Wheel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Performance ==

On October 5, 2012 the DLSC set a new world record by covering 97% of space heating needs with solar thermal energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarserver.com/solar-magazine/solar-news/archive-2012/2012/kw41/canadian-drake-landing-community-sets-world-record-for-solar-heating.html|title=Canadian Drake Landing community sets world record for solar heating|work=solarserver.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2015-2016 heating season, 100% of space heating needs were met with solar energy.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dlsc.ca/ Accessed on June 1, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15798">The '''Fishman Affidavit''' is a set of court documents submitted by ex-Scientologist [[Steven Fishman]] in 1993 in the federal case, ''Church of Scientology International v. Fishman and Geertz'' (Case No. CV 91-6426 (HLH (Tx) [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]]).

The [[affidavit]] contained criticisms of the [[Church of Scientology]] and substantial portions of the [[Operating Thetan]] [[auditing (Scientology)|auditing]] and course materials.

==Church of Scientology International v. Fishman and Geertz==
The documents were brought as exhibits attached to a declaration by Steven Fishman on 9 April 1993 as part of ''Church of Scientology International v. Fishman and Geertz''. Along with [[Kendrick Moxon]] and Laurie Bartilson, [[Tim Bowles|Timothy Bowles]] was one of the lead attorneys for the Church of Scientology in the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

Fishman told the court that he had committed crimes on behalf of the Church. He also attested that he was assigned to [[murder]] his psychologist, Dr. Uwe Geertz, and then commit [[suicide]].&lt;ref name="greed"&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Behar |authorlink=Richard Behar |title=The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,972865-1,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |publisher= |id= |date=1991-05-06 |accessdate=2008-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="doublecrossed"&gt;{{cite web | first = Tony | last = Ortega | title = Double Crossed | url = http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1999-12-23/news/double-crossed/full | work = [[Phoenix New Times]] | publisher = [[Village Voice Media]] | date = 1999-12-23 | accessdate = 2008-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;Fishman received a mail fraud conviction three years earlier, and he claimed being brainwashed by the Church and that he had committed the crime to cover the cost of his Scientology sessions. The court rejected Fishman’s defense and he was soon after sued for libel by Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cowan |first1=Douglas E. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=91me_xjHB_gC&amp;vq=fishman&amp;dq=Scientology+xenu+internet+OT&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |title=Religion Online: Finding Faith on the Internet |editor-last=Cowan |editor-first=Douglas E. |editor2-last=Dawson |editor2-first=Lome L. |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |accessdate=2015-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As evidence, Fishman submitted course materials he said that he purchased from Ellie Bolger, a fellow Scientologist, and [[Richard Ofshe]], an expert witness for his defense. The Church says the documents were stolen and considers them to be [[copyright]]ed and a [[trade secret]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.courttv.com/archive/legaldocs/cyberlaw/scientology3.html |title=Court TV Library |date=1999-11-28 |accessdate=2007-08-22 |work=Court TV Online Legal Documents |quote=Plaintiff claims that these documents are protected from both unauthorized use and unauthorized disclosure under the copyright laws of the United States and under trade secret laws, respectively. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718105816/http://www.courttv.com/archive/legaldocs/cyberlaw/scientology3.html |archivedate=2007-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other materials, the [[affidavit]] contains 61 pages of the allegedly trade-secret and copyrighted story of [[Xenu]].

The Fishman Affidavit contains much text from the old versions of the Operating Thetan levels. The versions of OT I to OT VII in the Fishman Affidavit are considered authentic as the church's [[Religious Technology Center]] (RTC) brought [[copyright]] lawsuits over their release on the [[Internet]]. Fishman's description of [[OT VIII]] contains the accusation that [[Jesus]] was a [[pedophile]]. After initially asserting copyright to all the OT level descriptions in the affidavit, RTC amended its claim to remove the OT VIII description, calling it a forgery. Fishman stated that he had obtained his copy of OT VIII from Ofshe, a different source than his copies of the other OT Levels, purchased from a fellow Scientologist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Fishman/fishman.html Press Release by Steven Fishman], "Press Release: Scientology upper level references (OT materials) affirmed unsealed and in the public domain by United States Court of Appeals.", Pages 1-7., April 28, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of Scientology dropped its libel case against Fishman and Geertz in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Wayne | last = Garcia | title = Church of Scientology settles suit with PR firm | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sptimes/access/51847739.html?dids=51847739:51847739&amp;FMT=FT | work = | publisher = [[St. Petersburg Times]] | date = 1994-07-07 | quote=Earlier this year, Scientology dropped its libel case against former Scientologist Steve Fishman and his therapist, Uwe Geertz. | accessdate = 2008-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important side aspect of the case was the fact that several high-ranking Scientology officials and lead attorneys for the organization and former high-ranking Scientologists submitted declarations on their activities for the Church of Scientology, giving thereby insight into the internal ongoings of the Scientology management.

Among others, declarations were submitted by:

* Richard Aznaran &amp; Vicki Aznaran, former executives of the [[Religious Technology Center]]
* Jonathan Epstein, at that time International [[Finance Director]] of the [[Church of Scientology International]]&lt;ref&gt;[[:Image:Declaration Jonathan Epstein 1994.pdf|Declaration of Jonathan Epstein, Church of Scientology International vs. Steven Fishman &amp; Uwe Geertz, Case No. CV 91-6426 (HLH (Tx), U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Los Angeles, February 7th, 1994]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Posting to the Internet==
Although the Church of Scientology attempted to prevent others from receiving the document by continuously borrowing it, the text of this declaration and its exhibits were scanned, [[Optical character recognition|converted to text]], and posted onto the [[Usenet]] newsgroup [[alt.religion.scientology]] by ex-Scientologist [[Arnaldo Lerma|Arnie Lerma]].&lt;ref name="rtcvlerma"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.eff.org/legal/cases/Scientology_cases/brinkema_rtc_washpost_112895.opinion |title = Civil Action No. 95-1107-A |accessdate = 2007-10-10 |publisher = [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The material was then placed on the [[World Wide Web]] by [[David S. Touretzky]].

Lerma's newsgroup posting resulted in the August 1995 [[Scientology and the Internet|raid of his home]] for copyright violation on the materials, and the resulting lawsuit ''Religious Technology Center (Scientology) vs Arnaldo Lerma, Richard Leiby, and The Washington Post''.&lt;ref name="rtcvlerma"/&gt; U.S. Federal Judge [[Leonie Brinkema]] ruled that while Richard Leiby and the [[Washington Post]] had not violated copyright, Lerma was liable and fined $2,500 but with no costs awarded to Scientology. Judge Brinkema also stated that the primary motivation for the case was "to stifle criticism of Scientology in general and to harass its critics."&lt;ref name=nightmare&gt;{{cite web | first = Alan | last = Prendergast | title = Nightmare on the Net | url = http://www.westword.com/1997-03-06/news/nightmare-on-the-net/full | work = [[Westword|Denver Westword]] | publisher = [[Village Voice Media]] | date = 1997-03-06 | accessdate = 2008-07-08 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hushhush&gt;{{cite web | first = Alan | last = Prendergast | title = Hush-Hush Money | url = http://www.westword.com/1997-08-14/news/hush-hush-money/full | work = [[Westword|Denver Westword]] | publisher = [[Village Voice Media]] | date = 1997-08-14 | accessdate = 2008-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being posted to the newsgroup, the documents were mirrored on hundreds of websites worldwide.&lt;ref name="scholarship"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/OTIII |title=OT III Scholarship Page |accessdate = 2007-10-10 |publisher = David S. Touretzky}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church of Scientology responded by [[lawsuit|suing]] a number of people and their [[Internet service provider]]s for [[Scientology and the Internet|copyright infringement]]. The defendants responded by challenging the church to prove it was actually the copyright holder of the disputed documents.

The other notable case in connection with this was against [[Netherlands|Dutch]] writer [[Karin Spaink]]. The Church brought suit on copyright violation grounds for reproducing the source material, and claimed rewordings would reveal a trade secret. In 2003, Spaink won the case, with the court holding that her quotation of Scientology works was acceptable and expressing concern about Scientology's attempts to prevent discussion of its doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Wendy M. | last = Grossman | title = The mills of Xenu grind exceeding slow | url = http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=11516 | work = | publisher = [[The Inquirer]] | date = 2003-09-12 | accessdate = 2007-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church appealed but dropped the case after a negative advice on the appeal from the Attorney-General to the court in March 2005. In December 2005 the court dismissed the appeal, making the previous ruling final. The Church has no further possibility for appeal due to their dropping the case. The ruling also reversed earlier decisions affecting [[Hyperlinks|hyperlinking]].&lt;ref name="zdnetuk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.zdnet.co.uk/itmanagement/0,1000000308,39116197,00.htm |title = Hyperlinks remain legal after Scientology defeat |accessdate = 2007-10-10 |publisher = ZDNet UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the church have accused it of intentionally using lawsuits in these and other cases as [[Strategic lawsuit against public participation|SLAPP]] suits, intended to silence their opposition. Critics of Steven Fishman have produced the affidavit of Kenneth D. Long, a Scientology executive, which states that Fishman received services from a Scientology mission, did a few introductory courses, never worked for the Church or [[Citizens Commission on Human Rights|CCHR]], and did not get any auditing or do any courses at the main Miami church, which would conflict with his claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whyaretheydead.net/krasel/aff_kl.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516095709/http://www.whyaretheydead.net/krasel/aff_kl.html |archivedate=2008-05-16 |df= }} Affidavit of Kenneth D.

'''Frantiček Klossner''' (born February 28, 1960) is a Swiss artist based in Bern, known for creating video art, installations, performance, drawings and visual poetry. 

== Biography ==
Frantiček Klossner trained as an artist at the [[F+F School for Art and Media Design Zurich]] (1985–1989), among whose teachers were the artists Hansjörg Mattmüller, Hermann Bohmert, Norbert Klassen, Vollrad Kutscher, [[Valie Export]], [[Peter Weibel]], and the philosopher Gerhard J. Lischka, and among whose guest lecturers were [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Paul Virilio]], and [[Vilém Flusser]]. On graduating, he won a City of Bern art scholarship, thanks to which he was able to move into a studio in the East Village in New York City and there focus on video art, performance, and installations. He won a scholarship to the Swiss Institute in Rome in 1995 and after two years at that institution decided to settle in Rome, where he remained active as an artist until 2000. On returning to Switzerland, he headed the exhibition project Identité mobile at the Murten arteplage of the Swiss National Exhibition, Expo.02.

== Works ==
Works and groups of works by Frantiček Klossner now feature in numerous collections, among them those of the [[Swiss National Museum]], [[Kunsthaus Zurich]], [[Museum of Fine Arts Bern]], Kunstmuseum Solothurn, Kunstsammlung des Kantons Bern, Kunstsammlung der Stadt Zofingen, Graphische Sammlung der Schweizerischen Nationalbibliothek, Kunstsammlung der Schweizerischen Eidgenossenschaft, Collection Banque Bonhôte Neuchâtel, Collection Ketterer-Ertle, Neuer Berliner Kunstverein, Collection Ursula Blickle, Österreichische Galerie Belvedere Vienna, Museo de Arte Moderno de Buenos Aires MAMBA Argentina, Zentrum für Kunst und Medien Karlsruhe ZKM, Collection Reinking Hamburg {{source?|date=November 2018}}

[[File:Hova-Portrait.jpg|thumb|A Hova man, or free commoner, of the [[Merina people]] in 1896.]]
The '''Hova''', or free commoners, were one of the three principal historical [[caste]]s in the [[Merina Kingdom]] of [[Madagascar]], alongside the [[Andriana]] (nobles) and [[Andevo]] (slaves). The term ''hova'' originally applied to all members of a Malagasy clan (possibly of the Zafiraminia people) that migrated into the central highlands from the southeast coast of the island around the 15th century and absorbed the existing population of [[Vazimba]].&lt;ref name = RAISON/&gt; [[Andriamanelo]] (1540–1575) consolidated the power of the Hova when he united many of the Hova chiefdoms around [[Antananarivo]] under his rule.&lt;ref&gt;de la Vassière &amp; Abinal (1885), p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; The term Hova remained in use through the 20th century, though some foreigners transliterated that word to be ''Ankova'', and increasingly used since the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gwyn Campbell|title=David Griffiths and the Missionary “History of Madagascar”|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Va8yAQAAQBAJ |year=2012 |publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=978-90-04-19518-9|page=410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In and after the 16th century, slaves were brought into Madagascar's various kingdoms, and social strata emerged in Merina kingdom. The Hova emerged as the free commoners caste below the nobles hierarchy. The subset of Hova related to the king by blood came under the title ''Andriana''.&lt;ref name = KUS95/&gt; The social structure of the new kingdom became further defined under his son [[Ralambo]] (1575–1612), who further subdivided the Andriana into four ranks.&lt;ref name = RAISON&gt;Raison-Jourde (1983), pp. 141–142&lt;/ref&gt; Ralambo was also the first to use the term ''Imerina'' (land of the [[Merina people|Merina]]) to describe the land occupied by the Hova people, who thereafter gradually adopted the identity and label of ''Merina''.&lt;ref name = KUS95&gt;Kus (1995), pp. 140–154&lt;/ref&gt;

The warriors and soldiers occupation in the Merina society was traditionally selected from the Andriana caste, or from the nobles. Though in 19th century when Merina conquered the other kingdoms and ruled most of the island, a much larger army was needed, and the soldiers then included the Hova caste as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gwyn Campbell|title=David Griffiths and the Missionary “History of Madagascar”|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Va8yAQAAQBAJ |year=2012 |publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=978-90-04-19518-9|pages=623-624}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional occupation of the hova caste was managing rice and crop lands as owners and trading. The labor in the farms and other servitude was the occupation of the Andevo (slave) caste, also called the ''Mainty'' who were denied the right to own land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gwyn Campbell|title=David Griffiths and the Missionary “History of Madagascar”|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Va8yAQAAQBAJ |year=2012 |publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=978-90-04-19518-9|pages=63-67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Janice Harper|title=Endangered Species: Health, Illness, and Death Among Madagascar's People of the Forest |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0jKAAAAAMAAJ |year=2002|publisher=Carolina Academic Press|isbn=978-0-89089-238-1|pages=105–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Hova person could be reduced a slavery for crimes or a debt in default, and in this state he would be referred to as ''Zaza-hova''.&lt;ref name="Keller1901p90"&gt;{{cite book|author=Conrad Keller|title=Madagascar, Mauritius and Other East-African Islands |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t0xCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA90 |year=1901|publisher=S. Sonnenschein|pages=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Andriana, the Hova and the Andevo strata were endogamous in the Merina society. According to William Ellis memoir in 1838, a Hova in the Malagasy society was prohibited from marrying a noble or a slave, as well as a Zaza-hova.&lt;ref name="Ellis1838p164"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Ellis|title=History of Madagascar |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1g9DAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA164|year=1838|publisher=Fisher|page=164 with footnote}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exception, stated Ellis, was the unmarried Queen who could marry anyone from any strata including the Hova, and her children were deemed to be royal.&lt;ref name="Ellis1838p164"/&gt;

'''''Keeping up with the Joneses''''' is an [[idiom]] in many parts of the [[English language|English]]-speaking world referring to the comparison to one's neighbor as a benchmark for [[social class]] or the accumulation of material goods. To fail to "keep up with the Joneses" is perceived as demonstrating socio-economic or cultural inferiority. The phrase originated in a [[Keeping Up with the Joneses (comics)|comic strip of the same name]].&lt;ref name=Safire&gt;Safire, William (November 15, 1998). [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/15/magazine/on-language-up-the-down-ladder.html?src=pm "On Language; Up the Down Ladder"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. Retrieved June 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=toonopedia&gt;{{cite web |last= Markstein|first=Don|year=2010|website=www.toonpedia.com|publisher=Don Markstein's Toonopedia |title= Keeping Up with the Joneses |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/joneses.htm|access-date=June 23, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Keeping up with the joneses.png|thumb|right|510px|Comic strip by Pop Momand, 1921.]]

The phrase originates with the [[comic strip]] ''[[Keeping Up with the Joneses (comics)|Keeping Up with the Joneses]]'', created by [[Arthur R. "Pop" Momand]] in 1913. The strip ran until 1940 in ''[[The New York World]]'' and various other newspapers. The strip depicts the [[social climber|social climbing]] McGinis family, who struggle to "keep up" with their neighbors, the Joneses of the title. The Joneses were [[unseen character]]s throughout the strip's run, often spoken of but never shown. The idiom ''keeping up with the Joneses'' has remained popular long after the strip's end.&lt;ref name="Safire"/&gt;&lt;ref name="toonopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://strippersguide.blogspot.com/2011/02/pop-momand-profiled-by-alex-jay.html|title=Stripper's Guide|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hendrickson, ''The Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://manof300.com/why-are-we-keeping-up-with-the-joneses/|title= Why are We Keeping Up with the Joneses? |publisher= Man of 300|accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of the name ''Jones'' for neighbors involved in social comparison predates Momand's comic strip. In 1879, English writer E. J. Simmons wrote in ''Memoirs of a Station Master'' of the railroad station as a place for social exchange: "The Joneses, who don't associate with the Robinsons, meet there."&lt;ref name=Safire/&gt; American humorist [[Mark Twain]] made an allusion to Smith and Jones families with regard to social custom in the essay "Corn Pone Opinions," written in 1901 but first published in 1923. "The outside influences are always pouring in upon us, and we are always obeying their orders and accepting their verdicts. The Smiths like the new play; the Joneses go to see it, and they copy the Smith verdict."&lt;ref&gt;Mark Twain, [http://grammar.about.com/od/classicessays/a/cornponetwain.htm "Corn Pone Opinions"]&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1908, D.W. Griffith directed a series of comedy shorts starring The [[Biograph Girl]], [[Florence Lawrence]], featuring the people next door, The Joneses.

An alternative explanation is that the Joneses of the saying refer to the wealthy family of [[Edith Wharton]]'s father, the Joneses.&lt;ref name=Lee2013&gt;{{cite book|author=Lee, Hermione |title=Edith Wharton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xEgqbyOkK28C&amp;pg=PA22 |year=2013 |publisher=Random House |isbn=978-1-84595-201-3 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Joneses were a prominent New York family with substantial interests in [[Chemical Bank]] as a result of marrying the daughters of the bank's founder, [[John Mason (businessman)|John Mason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Troubiand Post|first=Marie Caroline|title=The descendants of John Jones and John Mason|year=1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Joneses and other rich New Yorkers began to build country villas in the [[Hudson Valley]] around [[Rhinecliff, New York|Rhinecliff]] and [[Rhinebeck (village), New York|Rhinebeck]], which had belonged to the [[Livingston family|Livingstons]], another prominent New York family to whom the Joneses were related. The houses became grander and grander. In 1853, Elizabeth Schermerhorn Jones built a 24-room [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] villa called [[Wyndcliffe]] described by [[Henry Winthrop Sargent]] in 1859 as being very fine in the style of a Scottish castle, but by Edith Wharton, Elizabeth's niece, as a gloomy monstrosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wharton|first=Edith|title=A Backward Glance|year=1934|publisher=D. Appleton-Century Company Incorporated}}&lt;/ref&gt; The villa reportedly spurred more building, including a house by William B. Astor (married to a Jones cousin), a phenomenon described as "keeping up with the Joneses". The phrase is also associated with another of Edith Wharton's aunts, Mary Mason Jones, who built a large mansion at [[Fifth Avenue]] and 57th Street, then undeveloped. Wharton portrays her affectionately in ''[[The Age of Innocence]]'' as Mrs. Manson Mingott, "calmly waiting for fashion to flow north".

A slightly different version is that the phrase refers to the grand lifestyle of the Joneses who by the mid-century were numerous and wealthy, thanks to the Chemical Bank and Mason connection. It was their relation [[Caroline Webster Schermerhorn Astor|Mrs William Backhouse Astor, Jr]] who began the "patriarchs balls", the origin of "[[Ward McAllister#"The Four Hundred"|The Four Hundred]]", the list of the society elite who were invited. By then the Joneses were being eclipsed by the massive wealth of the [[Astor family|Astors]], [[Vanderbilt family|Vanderbilts]] and others but the four hundred list published in 1892 contained many of the Joneses and their relations—old money still mattered.

==Social effects==
The philosophy of "keeping up with the Joneses" has widespread effects on some [[society|societies]].  According to this philosophy, [[conspicuous consumption]] occurs when people care about their standard of living in relation to their peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Jordi Galí |last=Galí |first=Jordi |title=Keeping up with the Joneses: Consumption Externalities, Portfolio Choice, and Asset Prices |journal=[[Journal of Money, Credit and Banking]] |volume=26 |issue=1 |year=1994 |pages=1–8 |doi= |jstor=2078030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was re-introduced in 1976 when an article about parenting included it{{citation needed|reason=This statement needs to be supported by a citation of a reliable source.|date=July 2016}} and has remained a commercial and cultural watchword ever since.

According to Roger Mason, "the demand for [[Veblen goods|status goods]], fueled by ''conspicuous consumption'', has diverted many resources away from investment in the manufacture of more material goods and services in order to satisfy consumer preoccupations with their ''relative social standing'' and prestige".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mason |first=Roger |title=Conspicuous Consumption and the Positional Economy: Policy and Prescription since 1970 |journal=Managerial and Decision Economics |volume=21 |issue=3/4 |year=2000 |pages=123–132 |doi=10.1002/mde.977 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social status]] once depended on one's family name; however, the rise of [[consumerism]] in the United States gave rise to [[social mobility]]. With the increasing availability of goods, people became more inclined to define themselves by what they possessed and the quest for higher status accelerated. Conspicuous consumption and [[economic materialism|materialism]] have been an insatiable juggernaut ever since.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nd.edu/~ndmag/stuf2s99.htm "Possessions 2"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307002356/http://www.nd.edu/%7Endmag/stuf2s99.htm |date=2008-03-07 }}, ''Notre Dame magazine''&lt;/ref&gt;  The desire to increase one's position in the [[social hierarchy]] is responsible for much of the social mobility in America.  The upward mobility over the past few decades in America is due in part to the large number of women joining the labor force. U.S. women have slowly and steadily increased their participation in the labor force from 46% of all women (age 16+) in 1974 to almost 60% in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qualityinfo.org/olmisj/ArticleReader?itemid=00003582|title=Redirect Page|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in countries where the desire for upward social mobility via consumerism and conspicuous consumption is strong, the poor may not be able to better themselves. Doug Henwood observed that "both the US and British poor were more likely to stay poor for a long period of time: almost half of all people who were poor for one year stayed poor for five or more years, compared with 30% in Canada and 36% in Germany. And, despite claims of great upward mobility in the United States, 45% of the poor rose out of poverty in a given year, compared with 45% in the UK, 53% in Germany, and 56% in Canada. And of those who did exit poverty, 15% of Americans were likely to make a round trip back under the poverty line, compared with 16% in Germany, 10% in the UK, and 7% in Canada".&lt;ref&gt;Henwood, Doug. After the New Economy, pp. 136-7&lt;/ref&gt; The level of income inequality in a country has an inverse relationship with social mobility according to the authors of ''[[The Spirit Level: Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better|The Spirit Level]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pickett|first=Richard Wilkinson, Kate|title=The spirit level: Why more equal societies almost always do better|year=2009|publisher=Allen Lane|location=London|isbn=1-84614-039-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inability to "keep up with the Joneses" might result in dissatisfaction, even for people whose status is high.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/03/100322092057.htm "Money Only Makes You Happy If It Makes You Richer Than Your Neighbors"], ''Science Daily'', March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

One area in which "living above one's means" has caused negative social effects is that of credit card use. In the first quarter of 2002, total credit debt was $660 billion. By 2005, the total credit card debt had increased to $735 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2004/jan2004/debt-j15.shtml|title=US consumer debt reaches record levels - World Socialist Web Site|author=Joanne Laurier|date=15 January 2004|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; America's average credit card debt in 2007 was $8,400 per household. By the end of 2007, consumer debt in America had risen to $2.5 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://creditcounselingbiz.com/credit_counseling_statistics.htm |title=Credit Counseling Statistics |website=CreditCounselingBiz.com |archive-date=2007-12-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224193831/http://creditcounselingbiz.com/credit_counseling_statistics.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

'''Kowtow''', which is borrowed from ''kau tau'' in Cantonese (''koutou'' in Mandarin Chinese), is the act of deep respect shown by [[prostration]], that is, [[kneeling]] and bowing so low as to have one's head touching the ground. An alternative Chinese term is ''ketou''; however, the meaning is somewhat altered: ''kou'' (叩) has the general meaning of ''knock'', whereas ''ke'' (磕) has the general meaning of "touch upon (a surface)", ''tou'' (頭) meaning head. The date of this custom's origin is probably sometime between the [[Spring and Autumn Period]], or the [[Warring States Period]] of China's history because it is already known to have been a custom by the time of the [[Qin Dynasty]] (221 BC – 206 BC).{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In [[East Asia|East Asian]] culture, the kowtow is the highest sign of reverence. It was widely used to show reverence for one's elders, superiors, and especially the [[Emperor of China|Emperor]], as well as for religious and cultural objects of worship. In modern times, usage of the kowtow has become reduced.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==Traditional usage==
In [[Imperial era of Chinese history|Imperial Chinese]] protocol, the kowtow was performed before the Emperor of China. Depending on the solemnity of the situation different grades of kowtow would be used. In the most solemn of ceremonies, for example at the coronation of a new Emperor, the Emperor's subjects would undertake the ceremony of the "three kneelings and nine kowtows", the so-called grand kowtow, which involves kneeling from a standing position three times, and each time, performing the kowtow three times while kneeling. [[Immanuel C. Y. Hsu|Immanuel Hsu]] describes the "full kowtow" as "three kneelings and nine knockings of the head on the ground".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Rise of Modern China|edition= |last= Hsu|first= Immanuel|year= 1970|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= New York|lccn= 78083022|page= 152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Three people 'kowtowing' to an altar, one woman crying, othe Wellcome V0015171.jpg|thumb|Kowtowing in China]]
As government officials represented the majesty of the Emperor while carrying out their duties, commoners were also required to kowtow to them in formal situations. For example, a commoner brought before a local magistrate would be required to kneel and kowtow. A commoner is then required to remain kneeling, whereas a person who has earned a degree in the [[Imperial examination]]s is permitted a seat.

Since one is required by [[Confucianism|Confucian philosophy]] to show great reverence to one's parents and grandparents, children may also be required to kowtow to their elderly ancestors, particularly on special occasions. For example, at a wedding, the marrying couple was traditionally required to kowtow to both sets of parents, as acknowledgement of the debt owed for their nurturing.

[[Confucius]] believed there was a natural harmony between the body and mind and therefore, whatever actions were expressed through the body would be transferred over to the mind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Writings/Theistic%20and%20Non-theistic%20Belief.pdf "Theistic and Non-theistic Belief in China"]. Joseph A. Adler Kenyon College Public Lecture at John Carroll University March 29, 2012. Retrieved 24 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}&lt;!-- A citation from the analects or another reliable source would be helpful--&gt; Because the body is placed in a low position in the kowtow, the idea is that one will naturally convert to his or her mind a feeling of respect. What one does to oneself influences the mind. Confucian philosophy held that respect was important for a society, making bowing an important ritual.

==Modern Chinese usage==

The kowtow, and other traditional forms of reverence, were much maligned after the [[May Fourth Movement]]. Today, only vestiges of the traditional usage of the kowtow remain. In many situations, the standing [[Bowing|bow]] has replaced the kowtow. For example, some, but not all, people would choose to kowtow before the grave of an ancestor, or while making traditional offerings to an ancestor. Direct descendants may also kowtow at the funeral of an ancestor, while others would simply bow. During a wedding, some couples may kowtow to their respective parents, though the standing bow is today more common. In extreme cases, the kowtow can be used to express profound gratitude, apology, or to beg for forgiveness.

The kowtow remains alive as part of a formal induction ceremony in certain traditional trades that involve apprenticeship or discipleship. For example, [[Chinese martial arts]] schools often require a student to kowtow to a master. Likewise, traditional performing arts often also require the kowtow.

==Religion==
{{Main|Prostration (Buddhism)}}
Prostration is a general practice in [[Buddhism]], and not restricted to China. The kowtow is often performed in groups of three before Buddhist statues and images or tombs of the dead. In Buddhism it is more commonly termed either "worship with the crown (of the head)" (頂禮 ding li) or "casting the five limbs to the earth" (五體投地 wuti tou di)—referring to the two arms, two legs and forehead. For example, in certain ceremonies, a person would perform a sequence of three sets of three kowtows—stand up and kneel down again between each set—as an extreme gesture of respect; hence the term ''three kneelings and nine head knockings'' ({{lang|zh-hant|三跪九叩}}). Also, some Buddhist [[pilgrimage|pilgrims]] would kowtow once for every three steps made during their long journeys, the number three referring to the [[Triple Gem]] of Buddhism, the [[Buddhahood|Buddha]], the [[Dharma]], and the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]]. Prostration is widely practiced in India by Hindus to give utmost respect to their deities in temples and to parents and elders. Nowadays in modern times people show the regards to elders by bowing down and touching their feet.

==Diplomacy==
The word "kowtow" came into English in the early 19th century to describe the bow itself, but its meaning soon shifted to describe any abject submission or groveling. The term is still commonly used in English with this meaning, disconnected from  the physical act and the East Asian context.

The kowtow was a significant issue for diplomats, since it was required to come into the presence of the [[Emperor of China]], but it meant submission before him. The British embassies of [[George Macartney, 1st Earl Macartney]] (1793) and [[William Pitt Amherst, 1st Earl Amherst]] (1816) were allegedly unsuccessful, partly because kowtowing would mean acknowledging their King as a subject of the [[Emperor of China|Emperor]].

Dutch ambassador [[Isaac Titsingh]] did not refuse to kowtow during the course of his 1794–1795 mission to the imperial court of the [[Qianlong Emperor]].&lt;ref&gt;van Braam Houckgeest, Andreas Everardus. (1798). [http://ebook.lib.hku.hk/CTWE/B2962471X/ ''An authentic account of the embassy of the Dutch East-India company, to the court of the emperor of China, in the years 1794 and 1795''], Vol. I (English edition). pp. 285 in original (p. 335 of pp. 339 in digitized format).&lt;/ref&gt; The members of the Titsingh mission, including [[Andreas Everardus van Braam Houckgeest]] and [[Chrétien-Louis-Joseph de Guignes]], made every effort to conform with the demands of the complex Imperial court etiquette.

On two occasions, the kowtow was performed by Chinese envoys to a foreign ruler – specifically the Russian Tsar. T'o-Shih, Qing emissary to Russia whose mission to Moscow took place in 1731, kowtowed before Tsarina [[Anna of Russia|Anna]], as per instructions by the [[Yongzheng Emperor]], as did Desin, who led another mission the next year to the new Russian capital at St. Petersburg. &lt;ref&gt;Hsu, Immunel C.-Y. (1999), ''The Rise of Modern China'', New York, Oxford University Press, pp. 115–118 &lt;/ref&gt; Hsu notes that [[Kanghsi Emperor]], Yongzheng's predecessor, explicitly ordered that Russia be given a special status in Qing foreign relations by not being included among tributary states, i.e. recognition as an implicit equal of China.  

The kowtow was often performed in intra-Asian diplomatic relations as well. In 1636, after being defeated by the invading Manchus, King Injo of Joseon (Korea) was forced to surrender by kowtowing three times to pledge tributary status to the Qing Emperor Hong Taiji. As was customary of all Asian envoys to Qing China, Joseon envoys kowtowed three times to the Qing emperor during their visits to China, continuing until 1896 when the Korean Empire withdrew its tributary status from Qing as a result of the First Sino-Japanese War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|script-title=zh:仁祖 34卷, 15年 (1636) 正月30日 |publisher=[[Annals of Joseon Dynasty]]|language=Chinese|quote=龍胡入報, 出傳汗言曰: “前日之事, 欲言則長矣。 今能勇決而來, 深用喜幸。” 上答曰: “天恩罔極。” 龍胡等引入, 設席於壇下北面, 請上就席, 使淸人臚唱。 上行'''三拜九叩頭禮'''。}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The King of the [[Ryukyu Kingdom]] also had to kneel three times on the ground and touch his head nine times to the ground ({{lang|zh|三拜九叩頭禮}}), to show his allegiance to the Chinese emperors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.hi.u-tokyo.ac.jp/personal/tsuruta/sei0005.htm|title=重点領域研究「沖縄の歴史情報研究 (History Study of Okinawa)|quote= – 「通航一覧・琉球国部 正編 巻之二十三　琉球国部二十三、唐国往来」"|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Labia pride''' is a [[Feminist movements and ideologies|feminist movement]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; to raise awareness of the normal appearance of the [[vulva]] and to defy the trend towards cosmetic surgery on the female genitals ([[labiaplasty]], also known as "designer vagina").&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;[http://www.salon.com/2013/02/17/the_labia_pride_movement/ ''The “labia pride” movement. Rebelling against the porn aesthetic, women are taking to the Internet to sing the praises of "endowed" women''] - Salon&lt;/ref&gt; It is supported by several independent feminist groups and based on diverse channels of communication such as [[cyberfeminism]], [[protest march]]es and advocating boycotts against physicians and clinics that make use of [[deceptive advertising]].

==Forms of activism==

=== Muff March ===

The [[London]]-based feminist group [[UK Feminista]] organized a [[Demonstration (protest)|protest march]] through [[Harley Street]], an area synonymous with its private medical providers, in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hackneygazette.co.uk/news/hackney_feminist_leads_muff_march_protest_1_1152988 ''Hackney Feminist leads ‘Muff March’ protest''] - Hackney Gazette&lt;/ref&gt; More than 320 women paraded the street, with slogans like: "Keep your mits off our bits!", "There's nothing finer than my vagina!", and "Harley Street puts my chuff in a huff"&lt;ref name="ukfeminista"&gt;[http://ukfeminista.org.uk/2011/12/rise-in-‘designer-vaginas’-sparks-muff-march-protests/ ''Rise in ‘designer vaginas’ sparks Muff March protests''] - Press release: UK Feminista&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Muff March Harley Street 5.jpg|thumb|''"Love your labia!"'' - Woman displaying sign at the Muff March in London, 2011]]

{{quote|Muff March is about speaking back to a pornified culture which is pressuring women to go under the surgeon's knife and get a 'designer vagina'. We also want to shine a spotlight on the cosmetic surgeons who ruthlessly mine women's bodies to extract maximum profit.[...] Now pornography is exposing women to the toxic myth that there is one 'right' way for their labia to look. It's time to fight back.|[[Kat Banyard]], Director of UK Feminista&lt;ref name="ukfeminista"/&gt;}}

The "Muff March" has been criticized for putting too much emphasis on pornography as a root cause of the problem.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/11/muff-march-porn-designer-vaginas ''Is the Muff March such a cunning stunt?''] - The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Feminist views on pornography]].)

===Photo campaigns===

The growing demand for labiaplasty surgery is sometimes attributed to the idea that many women, as well as men, have unrealistic expectations regarding genital appearance. Almost all explicit depictions of female genitalia that people are confronted with are produced by the [[adult industry|sex industry]]. [[Pornography]] is usually produced in a commercial context and primarily addresses male customers. Therefore, these depictions of female genitalia are often "beautified" to suit commercial need (or in some countries for legal reasons),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/hungrybeast/blog/kdrysdale/healing-it-single-crease/ |title=Healing It To A Single Crease |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606203538/http://www.abc.net.au/tv/hungrybeast/blog/kdrysdale/healing-it-single-crease |archivedate=2012-06-06 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}} [http://vimeo.com/9924049 Video-Podcast on Vimeo]&lt;/ref&gt; either by the selection of models with a certain anatomy or by [[photoshopping]] the images. In practice, this means smoothing out irregularities and "digitally shortening" the [[labia minora]].

{{quote|A whole generation of young women who have grown up with ready access to the Internet are learning about their bodies and sexuality through this medium...Often the first and only way girls get to have a good look at other girls' naked genitals is through pornography, [which gives] a false view of what real women look like.|Madeleine Davies&lt;ref&gt;[http://jezebel.com/5985002/this-aint-no-porn-star-vagina-large-labias-need-love-too ''This Ain’t No Porn Star Vagina: Large Labias Need Love Too''] - Jezebel&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Jodie's liberated vulva.jpg|thumb|upright|Women post photographs of their vulvas "to publicly catalog normal genital diversity" and "counter unrealistic standards"&lt;ref name="salon"/&gt;]]
Several feminist groups, such as the ''Large Labia Project'' or ''Courageous Cunts'' try to oppose the influence that pornography has on anatomic expectations. By encouraging women to release images of their vulvas and post photo submissions of anonymous vulvas on their websites, they want to establish a sphere for women to get realistic impressions of normal vulvas.

However, the campaign itself has been criticized. By giving the false impression that protruding labia are the anatomical norm and small inner labia are the adaptation to beauty standards, it ignores the fact that many women have naturally small labia:

{{quote|In an effort to make "real women" feel better about themselves, some labia proud ladies are taking shots at girls whose labia actually look like the imaginary "Barbie" ideal. Turns out, some girls are actually born like that. Labia, like boobs or entire bodies, come in all shapes, sizes, colors and textures. Shaming one to make another type feel better is bad news. Think of it in terms of thin women who are often shamed or shunned in support of body image advocacy for larger girls.|Jessica Sager&lt;ref name="fewprob"&gt;[http://www.gurl.com/2013/02/19/your-labia/ ''The Labia Pride Movement Has A Few Problems''] - Gurl Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Furthermore, these campaigns as well have been criticized for putting too much blame on the porn industry and the subjection to male desires. It is argued that even though this might be the case to a certain degree, other factors that boost these surgeries are basically ignored.&lt;ref name="fewprob"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2013/02/20/the_large_labia_project_a_misguided_campaign_to_fight_porn_and_promote_real.html ''Insecure About Your Vagina? Sharing a Photo on the Internet Won't Fix That.''] - Slate&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence that smaller labia are actually preferred, as much or more "large labia" porn exists than any labeled for small.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

=== New View campaign ===
New View is a [[New York City]] based, grassroots network of feminists, social scientists and health care providers. In a self-description, New View "is opposed to the growth of the unregulated and unmonitored genital cosmetic surgery industry that is medicalizing women's sexuality and creating new risks, norms and insecurities."&lt;ref&gt;[http://newviewcampaign.org/fgcs.asp ''Female Genital Cosmetic Surgery (FGCS) Activism''] - New View&lt;/ref&gt; The group initiated several events with the aim of empowering women and raising awareness for the topic under names such as the ''Vulvagraphics'' or ''Vulvanomics''.

Courageous Cunts considers itself to be part of the so-called labia pride movement, with the aim of raising awareness for critical issues around [[labiaplasty]] and empowering women to overcome body shame. The site ran a campaign during which women could publicly post photographs of their [[vulva]] to promote a natural genital image and protest against "porn aesthetics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Landscape planning''' is a branch of [[landscape architecture]]. According to Erv Zube (1931–2002) landscape planning is defined as an activity concerned with developing landscaping amongst competing [[land use]]s while protecting natural processes and significant cultural and [[natural resources]]. [[park system|Park systems]] and [[greenway (landscape)|greenways]] of the type designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] are key examples of landscape planning. Landscape designers tend to work for clients who wish to commission construction work. Landscape planners analyze broad issues as well as project characteristics which constrain design projects.

Landscape planners may work on projects which are of broad geographical scope, concern many land uses or many clients or are implemented over a long period of time. As an example, the damage caused by unplanned [[mineral extraction]] was one of the early reasons for a public demand for landscape planning.

==In Asia==
In India, the history of landscape planning can be traced to the [[Vedas]] and to the [[Vaastu Shastra]]s. These ancient texts set forth principles for planning settlements, temples and other structures in relation to the [[natural landscape]]. Relationships with mountains (the home of the gods) and with rivers (regarded as goddesses) were of particular importance. A square form represented the earth and a circular form represented heaven. A [[mandala]] explained the relationship between heaven and earth. Square plans, for both secular and religious structures, were set out with their sides facing north, south, east and west. The earliest surviving stone temple set out in this way is [[Sanchi]].

In China, landscape planning originated with [[Feng Shui]], which is translated into English as 'wind and water' and is used to describe a set of general principles for the planning of development in relation to the [[natural landscape]]. The aim was to find the most auspicious environment possible, one sited in harmony with natural phenomena and the physical and psychological needs of man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Chinese Architecture|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2T1mScdj8CYC|publisher = Yale University Press|date = 2002-01-01|isbn = 0300095597|language = en|first = Nancy Shatzman|last = Steinhardt|first2 = Xinian|last2 = Fu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Europe==
In [[Europe]], the history of landscape planning can be traced to the work of [[Vitruvius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vitruvius Ten Books on Architecture, with regard to landscape and garden design|url = http://www.gardenvisit.com/history_theory/garden_landscape_design_articles/landscape_theory/vitruvius|website = www.gardenvisit.com|accessdate = 2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In discussing the planning of towns, he wrote about site planning with regard to microclimate, about the planning of streets and about the role of metaphor in design. Vitruvius' theories were revived during the renaissance and came to influence the planning of towns throughout Europe and the Americas. [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]] wrote on the need for town squares for markets and specific implementations to make most use of the space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Public and Private Spaces of the City|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=thmCAgAAQBAJ|publisher = Routledge|date = 2003-09-02|isbn = 1134519850|language = en|first = Ali|last = Madanipour}}&lt;/ref&gt; In North Europe this developed into the idea that residential squares should planned around green spaces. The first space of this type was the [[Place des Vosges]]. Residential squares were also made in Britain and their planning developed into the idea of incorporating public open space ([[public park]]s within towns). [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] gave momentum to this idea with his proposal for a [[park system]]s in Boston - the famous [[Emerald Necklace]]. [[Patrick Abercrombie]] took up this idea and incorporated it in his great 1943-4 Open Space Plan for the County of London.

==In the US ==
In the United States, landscape architects provide landscape planning services focused on the natural environment along with [[urban planner|urban planners]]. But, unlike Canada and Europe, the US does not have a national [[land use planning]] system. [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and [[Ian McHarg]] are two influential American landscape architects that also worked as planners. McHarg's work on overlay landscape planning contributed to the development of [[GIS]] and to the foundation of [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]] by [[Jack Dangermond]].

==Legislation==
The principles of landscape planning are now incorporated in various types of legislation and policy documents. In America, the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] was influenced by the work of [[Ian McHarg]] on [[Environmental impact assessment]]. In Germany, the Federal Nature Conservation Act requires the preparation of landscape plans. For the Europe Union as a whole, the [[European Landscape Convention]] has wide-ranging implications for the design and planning of relationships between development and the landscape. In Asia, major development projects are taking place and illustrating the need for good landscape planning. The [[Three Gorges Dam]], for example, will have extensive impacts on the landscape. They have been planned to a degree but future monitoring of the project is likely to show that better landscape planning and design would have been possible.

==Theory==
{{Disputed-section|The Broads|date=December 2012}}
Landscape planners are concerned with the 'health' of the landscape, just as doctors are concerned with bodily health. This analogy can be taken further. Medical doctors advise both on the health of individuals and on matters of public health. When individuals take actions injurious to their own health this is regarded as a private matter. But if they take actions injurious to public health, these actions are properly regulated by law. The [[collective landscape]] is a [[public good]] which should be protected and enhanced by legislation and public administration. If, for example, mineral extraction has a damaging impact on the landscape, this is a proper field for intervention. Negative impacts on the landscape could include visual impacts, ecological impacts, hydrological impacts and recreational impacts. As well as protecting existing public goods, societies are responsible for the creation of new public goods. This can be done by positive landscape planning. There are, for example, many former mineral workings (e.g. the [[Norfolk Broads]]) which have become important public goods. Medical doctors are trained in [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[biochemistry]] etc. before becoming practitioners. Landscape doctors are trained in [[geomorphology]], [[hydrology]], [[ecology]] etc. before becoming practitioners in design and planning. When qualified, they can specialize in areas of landscape planning:
*[[Landscape of roads]] - The landscape treatment of roads is concerned with the planning and design of [[road]]s and [[highway]]s with regard to their [[environmental impact assessment|environmental impact]] on the surrounding landscape. Sylvia Crowe wrote a pioneering book on the design of roads with regard to their impact on the landscape and Ian McHarg proposed an overlay system for highway route selection in his book on ''Design with nature''. In addition, the role of landscape, natural and ecological features and values especially natural and man-made infrastructure networks is hence quite important when planning strategic and macro policies, given that urban and inter-urban access networks are amongst the most important infrastructures in regional national and international levels. From the landscape point of view, ''general highway landscape frameworks'' must be formulated with respect to environmental needs ecological conditions and visual attractions, and particularly road edges. This can underlie quality-oriented planning and landscape design in many highways in regional and national levels.&lt;ref name=Taghvaei&gt;Taghvaei, S-Hassan "Importance of Highway and Expressway Landscape Design." ''Journal of The Urban Development and Organization: Haft Shahr'', '''4''', No. 55-56. Autumn, 2016. 10–30. [www.haftshahrjournal.ir/article_26567_aedaa43a6bea0c726a9f973112885ee1.pdf. Accessed 10 February 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Landscape of forestry]] - The '''landscape treatment of forests''' is concerned with the non-timber objectives which can be obtained by conserving and developing forests: scenic quality, water quality, recreation, [[wildlife management|wildlife conservation]] and other [[environmental good]]s. This work is done by foresters who also hold qualifications in [[landscape architecture]] and also by landscape architects and landscape planners with a specialization in forestry. The [[United States Forest Service]], the [[Forestry Commission|UK Forestry Commission]] and other forest agencies are also employers of landscape architects. They have mitigated criticism of [[plantation|plantation forestry]], [[monoculture]], and [[clear-cutting]].
*[[Landscape of energy]] - The generation of energy has become a major land use with consequent [[Environmental Impact Assessment|environmental impacts]] upon the landscape. Landscape planning for energy is concerned with designs and plans to mitigate the impact of power generation upon the landscape. This includes landscape planning for:
** [[power stations]]
** [[Power transmission|power transmission lines]]
** [[hydroelectric power]]
** [[tidal power]]
** [[solar power]]
** [[wind power]]
*[[Landscape of urbanization]] - Most of the world's cities are expanding into agricultural land. Landscape planning for [[urbanization]] is concerned with the conservation and development of landscape resources as urbanization takes place. [[Ian McHarg|Ian McHarg's]] approach to this problem was to prepare a series of overlay maps showing the different types of quality in the land around settlements: agricultural value, property value, hydrological value, scenic value, recreational value, ecological value etc. The maps of value were then overlaid to produce a composite map which looked like an X-Ray photograph - with the dark areas having the most value and the white areas the least value. His belief was that the 'white land' should be urbanized in preference to the 'black land'. The overlay mapping system which McHarg proposed is now carried out using a [[Geographic Information System]]. Other landscape planners have proposed [[Greenway (landscape)|greenways]] and [[green belt]]s as a means of [[Growth management|urban growth management]].
*[[Landscape Urbanism]] is a theory of [[urbanism]] arguing that [[landscape]], rather than [[architecture]], is more capable of organizing the city and enhancing the urban experience.
*[[Landscape of recreation]] - Recreation has become a large-scale landuse. In the coastal regions of many countries (e.g. [[Spain]] and [[Denmark]]) it is the dominant land use and has had an enormous impact on the natural landscape. The landscape of [[recreation]] is concerned with mitigating the [[Environmental Impact Assessment|environmental impact]] of recreation on the landscape. [[Landscape architects]] and landscape planners work on the landscape of recreation to:
** reclaim landscapes which have been damaged by recreational use
** carry out [[Environmental Impact Assessment|environmental impact assessments]] of [[recreation resource planning|recreational development proposals]]
** prepare landscape plans and designs for recreation projects
*[[Landscape of mineral extraction]] - Mineral extraction has a long history of damaging the landscape. Harm has been caused to scenic quality, water quality, habitat quality and other [[environmental good]]s. The landscape treatment of mineral workings is concerned with:
** the [[Land reclamation|reclamation]] of abandoned [[mining|mines]] and [[quarry|quarries]]
** the planning and design of future mineral workings to minimize their harmful [[environmental impact analysis|environmental impact]] and achieve as many positive impacts on the environment as possible.
*[[Landscape of agriculture]] - The primary purpose of agriculture is food production but concern for other objectives (e.g. wildlife, conservation, biodiversity, recreation and scenery) have a long history and are of increasing importance in wealthy and urbanized countries. The European Union Set-Aside Policy was designed as a means of giving money to farmers to produce non-food environmental goods from farmland. Landscape planners are involved with the preparation of agricultural landscape plans for the achievement of non-food objectives from agricultural land.
*[[River reclamation|Landscape of rivers]] - The construction of new buildings and new roads accelerates the discharge of surface water runoff and raises flood peaks in the lower reachers of river catchments. River banks therefore have to be raised and flood channels have to be constructed. The adoption of [[sustainable urban drainage systems]] facilitates the [[Land reclamation|reclamation]] of rivers. When water is detained, infiltrated and transpired near to the where it falls, flood peaks are lowered and rivers can be reclaimed. The high concrete walls in which they were confined can be replaced by vegetated embankments. Water quality is improved and wildlife returns to the river. Projects to achieve these objectives are described as River Reclamation or River Restoration.
[[Image:khajuraho-landscape.jpg|thumb|right|The western group of [[Khajuraho]] temples (2005) set in an archaeologically inappropriate parkland landscape |300px]]
*[[Landscape of archaeology]] - The landscape of archaeology is concerned with the landscape treatment of archaeological sites. This involves analysis, discussion, the formulation of policies and the preparation of landscape designs relating a number of issues. In Britain the former Ministry of Public Works and Buildings (MPBW) (now [[English Heritage]], [[Cadw]], [[Historic Scotland]] and [[Environment and Heritage Service|Northern Ireland Environment and Heritage Service]]) had a policy of treating archaeological sites like highly manicured gardens. The grass was maintained almost to the quality of a bowling green. The standard of care was admirable but there was little or no regard to the former landscape character of the archaeological site. The development of the discipline of [[landscape archaeology]] has awakened interest in this question because the wider landscape is seen, correctly, as having archaeological value. Most historic societies earned their livelihood from working the land. Their buildings were an important accessory to the use of the land. In countries where the looting of archaeological sites is a problem, there is a tendency for them to be surrounded with chain links or other security fencing. This detracts from the relationship between the site and its landscape setting. In other countries, archaeological sites have become important visitor attractions and sources of revenue. This has led to the building of tourist facilities (visitor centres, hotels etc.) which can easily have a detrimental impact on the archaeological site and its landscape setting.

In each case, the aim is to take a specialist land use and make recommendations for what can be done to enhance its implact on the stock of [[environmental good]]s.

==Methodology==
The conventional planning process is a linear progression of activities. The common steps are:

*Identification of problems and opportunities.
*Establishment of goals.
*Inventory and analysis of the biophysical environment.
*Human community inventory and analysis.
*Development of concepts and the selection of options.
*Adoption of a plan.
*Community involvement and education.
*Detailed design.
*Plan implementation.
*Plan administration.

Landscape planning not always means an ecological planning method, for that it must be considered that "planning is a process that uses the scientific and technical information for considering and reaching consensus on a range of choices. Ecology is the study of the relationship of all living things, including people, to their biological and physical environments. Ecological planning then may be defined as the use of biophysical and sociocultural information to suggest opportunities and constraints for decision making about the use of landscape". (Steiner, 1991)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32177">'''Leaderless resistance''', or '''phantom cell''' structure, is a [[Rebellion|social resistance]] [[strategy]] in which small, independent groups ([[Clandestine cell system|covert cells]]), or individuals (a solo cell is called a "[[Lone wolf (terrorism)|Lone Wolf]]"), challenge an established institution such as a law, economic system, social order, or government. Leaderless resistance can encompass anything from [[nonviolence|non-violent]] protest and [[civil disobedience]] to [[vandalism]], [[terrorism]], and other violent activity.

Leaderless cells lack vertical command links and so operate without hierarchical command,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = [[Simson Garfinkel]] | title = Leaderless resistance today | url = http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1040| work=First Monday| volume= 8| issue= 3|date=3 March 2003| accessdate = May 7, 2006 |doi=10.5210/fm.v8i3.1040}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they have a common goal that links them to the social movement from which their ideology was learned.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"&gt;Joosse, Paul. 2007. "Leaderless Resistance and Ideological Inclusion: the Case of the Earth Liberation Front. Terrorism and Political Violence 19(3): 351-368. http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09546550701424042?journalCode=ftpv20&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaderless resistance is simple and difficult to stamp out. It has been employed by a wide range of movements, including [[animal-liberation movement|animal-liberation]], [[radical environmentalist movements|radical environmentalist]], [[Pro-life movement|anti-abortion]], military [[invasion]] resistance, [[colonialism]] resistance, [[terrorism|terrorist]], and [[hate group]]s.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt;

==General characteristics==
A covert cell may be a lone individual or a small group. The basic characteristic of the structure is that there is no explicit communication between cells that are acting toward shared goals. Members of one cell usually have little or no information about who else is agitating on behalf of their cause.

Leaderless movements may have a symbolic figurehead. This can be a public figure, a [[multiple-use name]], or an inspirational author, who picks generic targets and objectives, but does not actually manage or execute plans. [[Mass media|Media]], in this case, often create a [[positive feedback loop]]: by publishing declarations of a movement’s role model, this instills motivation, ideas, and assumed sympathy in the minds of potential agitators who in turn lend further authority to the figurehead.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} While this may loosely resemble a vertical command structure, it is notably unidirectional: a titular leader makes pronouncements, and activists may respond, but there is no formal contact between the two levels of organization.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt;

As a result, leaderless resistance cells are resistant to [[informant]]s and [[traitor]]s. As there is neither a center that may be destroyed, nor links between the cells that may be infiltrated, it is more difficult for established authorities to arrest the development of a leaderless resistance movement than it is with movements that adopt more conventional hierarchies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

Given {{clarify|date=July 2018|reason=what's asymmetrical about it? asymmetrical with respect to what?|text=the asymmetrical character}} of leaderless resistance, and the fact that it is often strategically adopted in the face of a power imbalance, it has much in common with [[guerrilla warfare]]. The latter strategy, however, usually retains some form of organized, bidirectional leadership and is often more {{clarify|date=July 2018|reason=what does this mean?|text=broad-based}} than the individualized actions of leaderless cells. In some cases, a largely leaderless movement may evolve into a coherent [[insurgency]] or guerrilla movement, as with the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Yugoslav partisans]] of [[World War II]].&lt;!-- In the same conflict, the [[United Kingdom|British]] leadership had extensive plans for the use of such resistance in the event of a successful [[Operation Sealion|German invasion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=British Resistance Organisation |title=History |url=http://www.parhamairfieldmuseum.co.uk/brohistory.html |publisher=parhamairfieldmuseum.co.uk |accessdate=May 7, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050315030541/http://www.parhamairfieldmuseum.co.uk/brohistory.html |archivedate=March 15, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {trivia that doesn't relate to the main topic}--&gt;

Leaderless resistance often involves resistance by violent means, but it is not limited to them. Non-violent groups can use the same structure to author, print, and distribute [[samizdat]] literature, to create self-propagating [[boycotts]] against political opponents via the internet, to maintain an alternative [[Digital currency|electronic currency]] outside of the reach of taxing governments and transaction-logging banks, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;Joosse, Paul. 2012. "Elves, Environmentalism, and 'Eco-terror'" Crime Media Culture 8(1): 75-93. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1741659011433366&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}
The concept of leaderless resistance was developed by Col. [[Ulius Louis Amoss]], a former [[United States Intelligence Community|U.S. intelligence]] officer, in the early 1960s. An [[anti-communist]], Amoss saw leaderless resistance as a way to prevent the penetration and destruction of CIA-supported resistance cells in Eastern European countries under Soviet control.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150626193618/http://www.defendingdissent.org/fame/index.php?title=Leaderless_Resistance:_Amoss_Version_1953-1962] Amoss as cited in Defending Dissent Foundation Study Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was revived and popularized in an essay published by the anti-government [[Ku Klux Klan]] member [[Louis Beam]] in 1983 and again in 1992. Beam advocated leaderless resistance as a technique for [[white nationalism|white nationalists]] to continue the struggle against the [[Federal Government of the United States|U.S. government]], despite an overwhelming imbalance in power and resources.

Beam argued that conventional [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] pyramidal organizations are extremely dangerous for their participants, when employed in a resistance movement against government, because of the ease of disclosing the [[chain of command]]. A less dangerous approach would be to convince like-minded individuals to form independent cells without close communication between each other but generally operating in the same direction.

==In practice==

The first recorded [[direct action]] for [[animal liberation movement|animal liberation]] which progressed (after a considerable delay) into a movement of leaderless resistance was by the original "Band of Mercy" in 1824 whose goal was to thwart [[fox hunters]].&lt;ref name=Best&gt;Best &amp; Nocella (eds), ''Terrorists or Freedom Fighters'', Lantern Books, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by this group and after seeing a pregnant deer driven into the village by fox hunters to be killed, John Prestige decided to actively oppose this sport and formed the [[Hunt Saboteurs Association]] (HSA) in 1964.

A new [[Band of Mercy]] was then formed in 1972. It used direct action to liberate animals and cause economic sabotage against those thought to be abusing animals. [[Ronnie Lee]] and others changed the name of the movement to the [[Animal Liberation Front]] (ALF) in 1976 and adopted a leaderless resistance model focusing broadly on animal liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Webb, Robin. "Animal Liberation — By 'Whatever Means Necessary'," in Best &amp; Nocella (eds), ''Terrorists or Freedom Fighters, Lantern Books, 2004, p. 77.''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Earth First!]] and the [[environmental movement]] in the 1980s also adopted the leaderless resistance model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Southern Poverty Law Center | title = From Push to Shove | url = http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=42 | accessdate = May 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An animal liberation movement advocating violence emerged with the name [[Animal Rights Militia]] (ARM) in 1982. Letter bombs were sent{{by whom?|date=July 2018}} to the then [[British Prime Minister]], [[Margaret Thatcher]]. Two years later the name Hunt Retribution Squad (HRS) was also used.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Peter.

The [[Earth Liberation Front]] (ELF) formed in 1992, breaking from Earth First! when that organization decided to focus on public direct action, instead of the [[ecotage]] that the ELF participated in,&lt;ref&gt;Alleyne, Richard. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/01/19/ncam119.xml "Terror tactics that brought a company to its knees"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', January 19, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;. A [[violent]] group called the [[Justice Department (animal rights group)|Justice Department]] was established in 1993, and in 1994 {{clarify |date=July 2018 |reason=this sounds threatening, but without more information, it's vague. Amazon.com sends razor blades to people, but it doesn't make the papers.|text=sent razor blades}} to hunters such as [[Prince Charles]] and to [[animal research]]ers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/902751.stm "Animal rights, terror tactics"], ''BBC News'', 30 August 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=42 "From push to shove"], ''Southern Poverty Law Group Intelligence Report'', Fall 2002, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 the leaderless resistance strategy was employed by animal liberation organisations like [[Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty]] (SHAC), which was formed from the [[Consort beagles]] campaign and [[Save the Hill Grove Cats]] to close down [[Huntingdon Life Sciences]] (HLS). Despite claiming successes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shac.net/MISC/quantum Quantum Analytics: Drop HLS], ''[[Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty|SHAC]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; leaderless animal liberation and environmental movements generally lack the broad popular support that often occurs in strictly political or military conflicts.{{cite needed|date=July 2018}} The [[Revolutionary Cells (RCALB)|Revolutionary Cells--Animal Liberation Brigade]] (RCALB) appeared in 2003 and sent pipe bombs to [[Chiron Corporation]] and used [[incendiary device]]s against other targets{{clarify |date=July 2018 |reason=It's unclear what the significance of this is to the page topic.|text=, whilst a year later on the south coast of [[Dorset]], the [[Lobster Liberation Front]] (LLF) was founded}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hampshire/dorset/3939111.stm "Activists' 'war' to save lobsters"], ''BBC News'', July 30, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a few years of the victories claimed by the SHAC, other campaigns against animal testing laboratories emerged. At the same time, [[SPEAK (animals)|SPEAK Campaigns]] and the more radical ALF militants, [[Oxford Arson Squad]] began their campaigns towards the same goal: to end [[Oxford University]]'s animal research.

In April 2009, the [[Militant Forces Against Huntingdon Life Sciences]] (MFAH) became active. With the ALF, they began targeting HLS customer and financial Directors, as well as company property. Since then, groups{{Who?|date=July 2018}} have reported over a dozen actions in Europe, including painting homes, burning cars, and grave desecration.

===Islamists===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}
Leaderless resistance is also often well-suited to terrorist objectives. The [[Islamist terrorism|Islamist]] organization [[Al-Qaeda]] uses a typical figurehead/leaderless cell structure. The organization itself may be pyramidal, but sympathizers who act on its pronouncements often do so spontaneously and independently.

Given the small, clandestine character of terrorist cells, it is easy to assume they necessarily constitute leaderless resistance models. When there is bidirectional communication with external leadership, however, the label is inappropriate. The men who executed the bombings of the [[London Underground]] on July 7, 2005 constituted a leaderless resistance cell in that they purportedly acted out of sympathy for [[Islamic fundamentalism]] but under their own auspices. The hijackers involved in the [[September 11 attacks]], by contrast, allegedly received training, direction, and funding from Al-Qaeda, and are not properly designated a leaderless cell.

===Neo-Nazis===
The concept of leaderless resistance remains important to much far right thinking in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Paul de Armond | title = Putting the Far Right into Perspective | url = http://www.publicgood.org/reports/spectrum/ | accessdate = May 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a proposed response to perceived federal government over-reach at the expense of individual rights. {{clarify |date=July 2018 |reason=Garfinkel has yet to be introduced. Who is he?|text=Garfinkel }}, however, found in his research that for the most part the far right seldom used this tactic,{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}. [[Timothy McVeigh]] is one example in the [[United States]]. McVeigh worked in a small cell which based its attack on motivations widespread among far-right anti-government groups and the militia movement.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Leaderless resistance has been advocated by White Supremacist groups such as [[White Aryan Resistance]] and the British neo-Nazi [[Combat 18]]. The modern [[Ku Klux Klan]] is also credited with having developed a leaderless resistance model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = University of Michigan | title = Right-Wing Domestic Terrorism | url = http://www-personal.umich.edu/~lormand/agenda/9909/06.pdf | accessdate = May 7, 2006 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Troy Southgate]] also advocated forms of leaderless resistance during his time as a leading activist in the [[National Revolutionary Faction]] and a pioneer of [[National-Anarchism]].

[[Stormfront (website)|Stormfront]], [[Aryan Nations]], and [[Hammerskin Nation]] link to Beam's ''Leaderless Resistance''. These groups promote lone wolf actions. {{clarify |date=July 2018 |reason=There needs to be more context to show how this quote is used to wink-and-nod to promote lone wolf actions.

===Radical environmentalism===
{{Main article|Radical environmentalism}}
:''Further information: [[Ecotage]], [[Eco-terrorism]], and [[Earth liberation]]''
Leaderless resistance emerged in the environmental movement in 1976 when [[John Hanna (activist)|John Hanna]] and others as the [[Environmental Life Force]] (ELF) (also known now as the ''original ELF'') used explosive and [[incendiary device]]s. The group conducted armed actions in northern [[California]] and [[Oregon]], later disbanding in 1978 following Hanna's arrest for placing incendiary devices on seven crop-dusters at the [[Salinas, California]] airport on [[May Day]], 1977.&lt;ref name=elf&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.originalelf.org/ |title=Original ELF |access-date=2018-12-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415040756/http://www.originalelf.org/ |archive-date=2012-04-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A decade and a half later this form of [[guerrilla warfare]] resurfaced using the same [[acronym]].
[[Image:Earthfirstmonkeywrench.png|thumb|right|180px|The symbol of [[Earth First!]]: a Monkey wrench and stone hammer.]]

In 1980 [[Earth First!]] was founded by [[Dave Foreman]] and others to confront environmental destruction, primarily of the American West. Inspired by the [[Edward Abbey]] novel ''[[The Monkey Wrench Gang]]'', Earth First! made use of such techniques as [[treesitting]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.penbay.org/ef/treesit_first1985.html Earth First's first treesitting civil disobedience action] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051016222643/http://www.penbay.org/ef/treesit_first1985.html |date=2005-10-16 }}, ''Earth First! 1985'', Oregon, June 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[treespiking]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.things.org/~jym/ef/tree-spiking-memo.html Tree Spiking Memo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424015446/http://www.things.org/~jym/ef/tree-spiking-memo.html |date=2008-04-24 }}, ''Earth First!'', April 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; to stop [[logging]] companies, as well as other activities targeted towards [[mining]], [[road]] construction,&lt;ref name="wall"&gt;{{cite book | title = Earth First! and the Anti-Roads Movement: Radical Environmentalism and Comparative Social Movements | last = Wall | first = Derek | year = 1999 | publisher = Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[suburb]]an development, and [[Energy development|energy companies]].

The organization was committed to nonviolent [[ecotage]] techniques from the group's inception. Others split from the movement in the 1990s, including the [[Earth Liberation Front]] (ELF) in 1992, which named itself after the [[Animal Liberation Front]] (ALF) which had formed in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://greenfield.fortunecity.com/tree/16/fire.html ELF Burns Down Vail] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211235040/http://greenfield.fortunecity.com/tree/16/fire.html |date=2006-02-11 }}, ''FIRE'', December 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later in [[Canada]], inspired by the ELF in [[Europe]], the first ''Earth Liberation'' [[direct action]] occurred, but this time as the [[Earth Liberation Army]] (ELA), a similar movement who use ecotage and [[monkeywrenching]] as a tool.

A series of actions earned ELF the label of [[eco-terrorism|eco-terrorists]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://prfamerica.org/EarthLiberationFrontNo1onFBIList.html Earth Liberation Front is now FBI's No. 1 Domestic Terrorist Threat], ''Property Rights of America Foundation Inc'', March 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthliberationfront.com/elf_news.htm ELF News], ''Earth Liberation Front''&lt;/ref&gt; including the burning of a [[ski]] resort in [[Vail, Colorado]] in 1998, and the burning of an [[SUV]] dealership in [[Oregon]] in 1999. In the same year the ELA made headlines by setting fire to the [[Vail Resorts]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], causing $12 million in damages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1571/is_36_15/ai_56063251 waste &amp; abuse - controversy over a temporary dirt road built by Vail Resortsand its effect on wetlands] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925184013/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1571/is_36_15/ai_56063251 |date=2008-09-25 }}, ''BNet'', September 27th 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The defendants in that case were later charged in the [[FBI]]'s "[[Operation Backfire (FBI)|Operation Backfire]]" with other crimes; this was later named by environmentalists as the [[Green Scare]], alluding to the [[Red Scare]] periods of fear over communist infiltration of U.S.&lt;ref name=opb&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/page2/jan06/elf012006.htm Eco-Terror Indictments: "Operation Backfire" Nets 11] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817222138/http://www.fbi.gov/page2/jan06/elf012006.htm |date=2010-08-17 }}, [[FBI]], January 20th 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedom4um.com/cgi-bin/readart.cgi?ArtNum=69570 Resentencing date set for Jeff Luers], ''Freedom4um'', 29 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] several laws were passed{{by whom?|date=July 2018}} increasing the penalty for ecoterrorism, and the U.S. Congress held hearings on the activity of groups such as the ELF. To date no one has been killed as a result of an ELF or ALF action, and both groups forbid harming human or non-human life.&lt;ref name=rel&gt;[[Bron Taylor]], 1998.

===Network analysis in classical setting===
Leaderless resistance [[social network]]s are potentially vulnerable to [[social network analysis]] and its derivative, [[link analysis]]. Link analysis of social networks is the fundamental reason for the ongoing legislative push in the U.S. and the European Union &lt;!-- and elsewhere (where?) --&gt; for mandatory [[Telecommunications data retention|retention of telecommunication traffic data]] and for limiting access to [[Anonymity|anonymous]] [[Prepaid mobile phone|prepaid]] [[Mobile phone|cellphones]], as the stored data contain important network analysis clues.{{cite needed|date=July 2018}}
{{See also|MAINWAY}}

Network analysis was successfully used by French Colonel [[Yves Godard (French officer)|Yves Godard]] to break the [[Nationalism and resistance in Algeria|Algerian resistance]] between 1955 and 1957 and force them to cease their [[bombing]] campaigns. The Algerian conflict may be better described as guerrilla in nature rather than leaderless resistance (see ''Modern Warfare'' by Col. Roger Trinquier), and this illustrates the weakness of cell-structured insurgents when compared to leaderless ones. {{clarify |date=July 2018 |reason=What is mapping data? This term has not been explained.|text= The mapping data}} were obtained{{by whom?|date=July 2018}} by the use of [[informant]]s and [[torture]] and were used{{by whom?|date=July 2018}} to obtain the identities of important individuals in the resistance; these individuals were then [[assassination|assassinated]]{{by whom?|date=July 2018}}, which disrupted the Algerian resistance networks. The more irreplaceable the individual is in the adversary's network, the greater the damage is done to the network by removing them.

===Advantages for leaderless resistance===
Traditional organizations leave behind much evidence of their activities, such as money trails, and training and recruitment material. Leaderless resistances, supported more by [[ideology|ideologies]] than organizations, generally lack such traces. The effects of their operations, as reported by the [[mass media]], act as a sort of messaging and recruitment advertising.

{{clarify |date=July 2018 |reason=Who is Paul Joosse and why is he an authority?|text=Paul Joosse}} argues that leaderless resistance movements can avoid the ideological disputes and infighting that plague radical groups. They do this by {{clarify |date=July 2018 |reason=It's unclear what this means.|text=limiting interaction to the virtual realm}}.&lt;ref&gt;Joosse, Paul. 2007.  "Leaderless Resistance and Ideological Inclusion" Terrorism and Political Violence 19(3): 351-368. http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09546550701424042?journalCode=ftpv20&lt;/ref&gt;

The internet provides counterinsurgents with further challenges. Individual cells (and even a single person can be a cell) can communicate over the internet, anonymously or semi-anonymously sharing information online, to be found by others through well-known websites. Even when it is legally and technically possible to ascertain who accessed what, it is often practically impossible to discern in a reasonable timeframe who is a real threat and who is just curious, a journalist, or a [[web crawler]].

Despite these advantages, leaderless resistance is often unstable.{{cite needed|date=July 2018}} If the actions are not frequent enough or not successful, the stream of publicity, which serves as the recruiting, motivation, and coordination drives for other cells, diminishes. On the other hand, if the actions are too successful, [[support group]]s and other [[social structure]]s will form that are vulnerable to network analysis.

==In fiction==
*The 1970 novel ''A Piece of Resistance'', re-published in the US in 2004 under the title  ''Never Surrender''  by [[Clive Egleton]] depicts resistance to a Soviet occupation of England.
*The 1996 novel ''[[Unintended Consequences (novel)|Unintended Consequences]]'' by [[John Ross (author)|John Ross]] portrays a successful rebellion by the American heartland after decades of bullying by faraway Washington.

'''Legal mobilisation''' is a tool available to paralegal and [[advocacy]] groups, to achieve [[Empowerment#Legal empowerment|legal empowerment]] by supporting a marginalized issues of a stakeholder, in negotiating with the other concerned agencies and other stakeholders, by strategic combined use of [[Legal proceeding|legal processes]] along with [[advocacy]], media engagement and social mobilisation.&lt;ref name=Cotula&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cotula|first1=Lorenzo|title=Legal Empowerment for Local Resource Control: Securing Local Resource Rights Within Foreign Investment Projects in Africa|date= 1 Jan 2007|publisher=IIED, 2007|isbn=9781843696674|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-72KOAj92UgC&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=legal%20awareness&amp;pg=PR2#v=onepage&amp;q=legal%20awareness&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per Frances Kahen Zemans (1983) '' the Legal mobilisation is "a desire or want, which is translated into a demand as an assertion of one's rights".'' &lt;ref name=Zemans&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zemans|first1=Frances|title=Legal Mobilization: The Neglected Role of the Law in the Political System|journal=The American Political Science Review|date=Sep 1983|publisher=American Political Science Association|location=USA|volume= 77|issue=3|jstor=1957268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lisa Vanhala (November 2011) Legal mobilisation in its  narrowest sense, may refer to high-profile litigation efforts for (or, arguably, against) [[social change]] or more '''broadly, term legal mobilisation has been used to describe any type of process by which an individual or collective actors invoke legal norms, discourse, or symbols to influence policy or behavior.'''&lt;ref name=Vanhala&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vanhala|first1=Lisa|title=Legal Mobilization|journal=Political Science|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/obo/9780199756223-0031|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=24 November 2014|ISBN= 9780199756223|doi=10.1093/obo/9780199756223-0031|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This typically means that there are policies or regulations to mobilize around and a mechanism by which to do so.&lt;ref name=Pettinicchio&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pettinicchio|first1=David|title=The When, Why, and How of Legal Mobilization|website=Mobilizing Ideas|url=http://mobilizingideas.wordpress.com/2013/02/04/the-when-why-and-how-of-legal-mobilization/|accessdate=24 November 2014|date=February 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legislative activity does create an opportunity for legal mobilization.

The use of the law and legal systems by disadvantaged people to contest the unfair distribution of power and resources is a real-world phenomenon that predates and exists independently of international law and [[Legal aid|justice assistance]].&lt;ref name=odi&gt;{{cite web|author1=odi.org|title=The politics of legal empowerment: legal mobilisation strategies and implications for development|url=http://www.odi.org/publications/8485-legal-empowerment-mobilisation|website=odi.org|publisher=publications/8485-legal-empowerment-mobilisation|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shibboleths used in war and persecution==

===Dutch–French===
* ''Schild en vriend'': On 18 May 1302, the people of [[Bruges]] killed the [[France|French]] occupiers of the city during a nocturnal surprise attack. According to a famous legend, they stormed into the houses where they knew the tenants were forced to board and lodge French troops serving as city guards, roused every male person from his bed and forced them to repeat the challenge ''schild en vriend'' (shield and friend). The [[Flemings]] pronounced {{Wikt-lang|nl|schild}} with a separate "s" {{IPA|/s/}} and "ch" {{IPA|/x/}}". Flemings would pronounce {{Wikt-lang|nl|vriend}} with a [[Dutch phonology#Consonants|voiced ''v'']] whereas French would render those as a [[French phonology#ref 2|voiceless ''f'']].
Every Frenchman who failed the test was stabbed on the spot, still in his nightgown. Because the signal for the uprising was the [[matins]] bells of the city's churches and monasteries, this became known as the [[Bruges Matins (history)|Bruges Matins]] or ''Brugse Metten''. Like the name of the massacre, the story may have been influenced by the Sicilian uprising mentioned below.
* The problem with this legend is that in Medieval manuscripts of that time, a shield is referred to as "''skilde''" as in Norse and Norse-influenced English words. Therefore, it is sometimes said that the words must have been "'s gilden vriend" meaning "friend of the guilds." The combination of the 's and the g in "'s gilden" would be pronounced {{IPA|/sx/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=iO_qLu8JossC |pages=22–3 |title=The rough guide to Bruges &amp; Ghent |author=Phil Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italian/Sicilian–French===
* ''Ciciri'' ([[chickpea]]s): This was used by native [[Sicily|Sicilians]] to ferret out [[Anjou|Angevin]] [[France|French]] soldiers in the late 13th century during the [[Sicilian Vespers]], the uprising which freed the island from [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] rule. Both the Italian soft c {{IPA|/tʃ/}}, and the Italian r, were (and are still) difficult for the French to pronounce as that sequence of sounds seldom appears in French; also, in French, words are primarily stressed on the final syllable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Language testing: the social dimension | last=McNamara | first=Timothy |author2=Carsten Roever  | year=2006 | publisher=John Wiley and Sons | isbn=978-1-4051-5543-4 | page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frisian–Dutch===
[[File:Nl-Schibbolet-fries.oga|thumb|right|''Bûter, brea, en griene tsiis; wa't dat net sizze kin, is gjin oprjochte Fries'']]
* ''Bûter, brea, en griene tsiis; wa't dat net sizze kin, is gjin oprjochte Fries'' ({{audio|Nl-Schibbolet-fries.oga|example}}) means "Butter, rye bread and green cheese, whoever cannot say that is not a genuine Frisian" was used by the [[Frisians|Frisian]] [[Pier Gerlofs Donia]] during a [[Arumer Zwarte Hoop|Frisian rebellion]] (1515–1523). Ships whose crew could not pronounce this properly were usually plundered and soldiers who could not were beheaded by Donia himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wunseradiel.nl/index.php?simaction=content&amp;pagid=289&amp;mediumid=1|publisher=Gemeente Wûnseradiel|title=Greate Pier fan Wûnseradiel|language=Western Frisian|accessdate=2008-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Castilian Spanish–Latin-American Spanish===
* During the [[Latin American wars of independence]], the name {{lang|es|[[Francisco]]}} was used by [[Colombia]]n rebels to tell locals from Spaniards. Whoever pronounced it as {{IPA|/fɾanˈθisko/}} (as in European Spanish) as opposed to {{IPA|/fɾanˈsisko/}} would have been thrown into the [[Magdalena River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://congresosdelalengua.es/rosario/ponencias/internacional/avila_r.htm|title=III Congreso Internacional de la Lengua Española. Paneles y ponencias. Raúl Ávila|author=Centro Virtual Cervantes|work=congresosdelalengua.es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===English–Dutch===
* The [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381 (also Tyler’s Rebellion, or the Great Rising) was used by the merchants of London in an attempt to get a competitive edge in the trade with the Low Countries by reducing the number of competitors. A massacre among the [[Flemish people|Flemings]] in London&amp;nbsp;– not just the Flemish merchants&amp;nbsp;– ensued. "And many fflemmynges loste hir heedes at that tyme and namely they that koude nat say Breede and Chese, but Case and Brode."&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicles of London''; Oxford University Press, 1905; ed. C. L. Kingsford; p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finnish–Russian===
* {{lang|fi|Yksi}}: [[Finnish language|Finnish]] for "[[one]]", used by the [[White Guard (Finland)|White Guard]] to separate Russians from Finns in the [[Finnish Civil War]] during the invasion of [[Tampere]]. Many of the Russians caught had changed to civilian clothing, so suspected people were rounded up, even from hospitals, and asked to say ''{{lang|fi|yksi}}.'' If the prisoner pronounced it {{IPA-fi|juksi|}}, mistaking the front vowel 'y' for an [[iotation|iotated]] 'u', he was considered a Russian foreign fighter and was shot on the spot. Any Slav or Balt, Communist or not, was killed, including some members of the White Guard.&lt;ref&gt;Heikki Ylikangas, Tie Tampereelle, ref. at http://www.uta.fi/koskivoimaa/valta/1918-40/venalai1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{lang|fi|Höyryjyrä}}: [[Finnish language|Finnish]] for "[[steam roller]]", used by the Finnish Army in the [[Second World War]]. This word is almost impossible to pronounce for anyone not skilled in Finnish, withe frontal 'ö' and 'y' and rolled 'r' {{IPA-fi|höyryjyrä|}}.&lt;ref&gt;https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0ibbolet&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish–French and Haitian Creole===
* [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] dictator [[Rafael Trujillo]] conducted a brutal massacre of undocumented [[Haiti]]an settlers along the Dominican-Haitian border. The action is known as the [[Parsley Massacre]]. Suspects not fluent in Spanish either did not know or could not properly pronounce the Spanish word 'perejil' (parsley). The pronunciation of the word by Haitian citizens tended to be with a [[Alveolar trill|trilled r]] and without the 'l' at the end of the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/shibboleth.html|title=Untitled Document|work=upenn.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Azeri–Armenian===
* The [[Azerbaijani Language|Azeri]] word for Hazelnut, ''[[Azerbaijani alphabet|fındıq]]'', which Armenians typically pronounce with a {{IPA|[p]}} instead of an {{IPA|[f]}}.&lt;ref&gt;

===Polish–German===
* ''Soczewica, koło, miele, młyn'' ([[Old Polish]] pronunciation: {{IPA|[ˈs̪ɔt͡ʃɛvit͡sʲa ˈkɔɫɔ ˈmʲɛlʲɛ ˈmɫɪn̪]}}), meaning "lentil, wheel, grinds [verb], mill": In 1312, the Polish Prince [[Władysław I the Elbow-high|Ladislaus the Elbow-high]] quelled the [[Rebellion of wójt Albert]] in [[Kraków]], populated mostly by [[Silesians|Silesian]], German and Czech citizens. Anyone over the age of 7 who could not pronounce these [[Polish language|Polish]] words was put to death, ejected from the city or had his property confiscated. 'Ł' (then pronounced as a [[velarized alveolar lateral approximant]], aka [[dark l]]) and dental [s̪] are both unlikely to be pronounced properly by Germans since they cannot make out the difference from their own sounds [l] and [s]. (The former was approximated by Germans as ''l'', and has evolved now into a sound similar to English ''w'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historia.focus.pl/polska/soczewica-kolo-miele-mlyn-z-albertem-1091|title=Soczewica, Koło, Miele Młyn z Albertem|last=Węgłowski|first=Adam|date=21 June 2012|publisher=[[Focus (Polish magazine)|Focus.pl]]|language=Polish|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture, religion and language-specific shibboleths===
* English-speaking [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] personnel in Europe, during the [[Second World War]], frequently made use of passwords in which [[labio-velar approximant]]s (w-sounds) were prominent, as these are unusual in spoken [[German language|German]], and the letter w is normally pronounced "v" by native speakers of German. For instance:
** following [[Operation Overlord|D-Day]] (1944) US forces used the challenge-response "Flash" – "Thunder" – "''Welcome''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ambrose|first=Stephen E.|title=D-Day|year=1994|publisher=Touchstone|location=New York|isbn=0-684-80137-X|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli forces]] during the [[1948 Palestine war]] used passwords chosen to contain [[voiceless bilabial stop]]s (p-sounds), which are not found in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and which native speakers of Arabic often replace with a [[voiced bilabial stop]] (b-sounds).{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}
* In the [[Lebanese Civil War]] of 1975, Christian [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] soldiers targeted suspected [[Palestine (region)|Palestinians]] at checkpoints by asking how they pronounced the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word for "tomato", which is pronounced "banadoura" in [[Lebanese Arabic]] and "bandoura" in [[Palestinian Arabic]]. If they said the former, they were let through; if they said the latter, they were shot on the spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ross|first=Stuart|title=Teach Yourself - The Middle East Since 1945|publisher=Hodder Education|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the [[Somali people|Somali]] [[Islamic terrorism|Islamic terrorist]] group [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]]'s [[Westgate shopping mall shooting|2013 shooting and hostage siege attack]] on the [[Westgate (Kenyan shopping mall)|Westgate shopping mall]] in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]], the attackers asked for [[Prophets in Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]]'s mother [[Aminah bint Wahb]]'s name and the ''[[shahada]]'' as religious shibboleths to determine Muslims and non-Muslims. Muslims were freed, while non-Muslims were targeted. An Indian man who could not name Aminah was shot dead.&lt;ref name="Westgate BBC"&gt;{{cite news |title=Nairobi siege: What we know |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-24189116 |newspaper=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=22 September 2013 |quote=An Indian man who was standing next to him was asked for the name of the Prophet's mother and when he was unable to answer, he was shot dead, the witness told him.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Westgate NZH"&gt;{{cite news |title=Explosions inside mall as stand-off nears end |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=11129542 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |date=25 September 2013 |accessdate=26 September 2013 |agency=Agence France-Presse}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The mostly [[Christianity in the Philippines|Christian]] [[Armed Forces of the Philippines|Filipino ground troops]] fighting in the 2013 [[Zamboanga City crisis]] used the [[Lord's Prayer]] as a way to identify [[Moro insurgency in the Philippines|Moro insurgents]]. Those who could not recite the Lord's Prayer in any [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippine language]], including [[Philippine English|English]], were immediately suspected of being part of the armed [[Moro National Liberation Front]] and detained, leading to deeper inter-religious divisions as all non-Christians, including non-combatant Muslims, would also fail the test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism|title=Peace groups warn of empty victory in Zambo siege|url=http://pcij.org/blog/2013/09/27/peace-groups-warn-of-empty-victory-in-zambo-siege|website=The PCIJ Blog|publisher=The Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism|accessdate=31 March 2015|date=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==English shibboleths for native speakers or local natives==

{{See also|Regional accents of English|Regional vocabularies of American English}}
* ''[[Fish and chips]]'': The accents of [[Australia]]ns and [[New Zealand]]ers seem very similar, and the term ''fish and chips'' is sometimes evoked to illustrate a major difference between the two. In [[New Zealand English#Vowels|New Zealand pronunciation]] short ''i'' is a central vowel, {{IPA|[ɘ]}}. This vowel sound is sometimes caricatured as "fush and chups" by Australians. The [[Australian English phonology|Australian pronunciation]] has the front vowel {{IPA|[ɪ]}} (which is more common in most [[varieties of English]]) which, due to an overall [[vowel shift]] in New Zealand, sounds like "feesh and cheeps" to the ears of a New Zealander,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/handle/10092/985 |title=Identification of New Zealand English and Australian English based on stereotypical accent markers |author=Ilka Ludwig |year=2007|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=New Zealand English: phonology |author=Laurie Bauer, Paul Warren |isbn=978-3-11-019637-5 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; sounding like an instance of the "[[Fill–feel merger]]".
* Pronunciation of letters of the [[alphabet]]:
** ''[[H]]'': in [[Northern Ireland]] pronounced 'aitch' by [[Protestant]]s, 'haitch' by [[Catholic]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wnFz_ZIfBgsC&amp;lpg=PA186&amp;ots=D4eCjJRrFG&amp;dq='aitch'%20by%20Protestants%2C%20'haitch'%20by%20Catholics%2C&amp;pg=PA186#v=onepage&amp;q='aitch'%20by%20Protestants,%20'haitch'%20by%20Catholics,&amp;f=false|title=Cities on the Margin, on the Margin of Cities: Representations of Urban Space in Contemporary Irish and British Fiction|author=Philippe Laplace|publisher=Presses Univ.

** ''[[Z]]'': in North America pronounced ''zee'' in the [[United States]]; typically ''zed'' in the rest of the world. Known in [[American history]] and [[popular culture]] for distinguishing American males who fled to Canada from the US to escape the [[draft dodger|military draft]] in the 1950s and 60s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bcUOAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=american+draft+dodgers+in+canada+zed&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=draft+dodgers|title=''Think''|publisher=International Business Machines Corporation|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NbgPAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=american+draft+dodgers+in+canada+zed&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=zed|title=''Science Digest''|year=1958|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian pronunciation was featured in the [[Molson]] [[Molson Canadian|Canadian]] ''[[I Am Canadian]]'' advertisement in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adage.com/article/news/blame-canada-molson-brilliant-rant-states/15731/ Blame Canada and Molson for brilliant 'Rant' at States], ''[[Advertising Age]]'', May 08, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Highland Dress]], for anyone who has served in a [[Scottish Regiment]] or played in a [[pipe band]], or whenever said by a [[Scot]], if ‘[[Tartan|plaid]]’ ''should'' be used to refer to [[tartan]] cloth, it ''could'' be pronounced: {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|l|æ|d}} (to rhyme with ‘had’). NB: This usage, as a synonym for ‘tartan’, is generally only ever found in North America.&lt;ref&gt;English Language &amp; Usage:"[https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/217485/is-there-any-difference-between-plaid-and-tartan Is there any difference between 'plaid' and 'tartan'?]"&lt;/ref&gt; More often, however, when referring to the cape-like garment, in its various forms, worn over the left shoulder as part of the traditional or formal [[Scottish people|Scottish]] dress, the pronunciation is: {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|l|eɪ|d}} (to rhyme with ‘made’); though the [[OED]] accepts both pronunciations in this usage. To further stress the difference in pronunciation of the garment versus the cloth, the garment has an alternative spelling ‘plaide’, though rarely used. Thus: belted-plaid, drummer's plaid, evening-plaid, fly-plaid, full-plaid, piper's plaid, et al., are pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|l|eɪ|d}} by those who have worn, or are familiar, with the same. [[Etymology]]: ''plaide'' ([[Scots Language|Scots]]) via [[Scottish Gaelic]] meaning ‘blanket’ or ‘cloak’, (albeit usually made of tartan; most often the same tartan as the wearer's [[kilt]] or [[trews]]).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/plaid plaid]", Collins English Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Place-name pronunciations===
{{Main|List of names in English with counterintuitive pronunciations}}

====In Australia====
* [[Cairns]], Queensland: [[Australian English phonology|Pronounced]] {{IPA|[ˈkæːnz]}} or {{IPA|[ˈkeːnz]}} by Australians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Macquarie Dictionary, Fourth Edition|year=2005|publisher=The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd.|location=Melbourne|isbn=1-876429-14-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; is pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɛər|n|z}} by speakers of non-Australian dialects. Although {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɛər|n|z}} is standard in the case of the English word 'cairn' referring to a stack of stones,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Merriam-Webster Dictionary|year=2004|publisher=Merriam-Webster|location=Springfield|isbn=087779930X}}&lt;/ref&gt; most Australians consider it erroneous when referring to the city.

====In Canada====
* [[Newfoundland]]: Some outsiders pronounce the island almost as if it were three separate words, {{IPAc-en|nj|uː|ˈ|f|aʊ|n|d|l|ə|n|d}} {{respell|new|FOWND|lənd}} rather than the local pronunciation, {{IPAc-en|ˌ|nj|uː|f|ən|ˈ|l|æ|n|d}} {{respell|NEW|fən|LAND}}, rhyming with "understand".&lt;ref&gt;Story, George Morley, et. al, ''Dictionary of Newfoundland English'' (Toronto, University of Toronto Press:1982), "Newfoundland", p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], Saskatchewan: Pronounced {{IPAc-en|r|ɪ|ˈ|dʒ|aɪ|n|ə}},&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/audio.php?file=ggregi01&amp;word=Regina&amp;text= |title=Regina |author=Merriam-Webster Audio File}}&lt;/ref&gt; rhyming with "[[vagina]]". Familiarity with the standard pronunciation may in some cases distinguish Canadians from Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cjme.com/story/you-heard-what-because-jon-ryan-went-university-regina/531688 |title=You heard what? Because Jon Ryan went to University of Regina |date=February 2, 2015 |newspaper=[[CJME]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]: Vancouver is often pronounced by locals as {{IPAc-en|v|æ|ŋ|ˈ|k|uː|v|ər}} {{respell|vang|KOO|vər}}, with a velar {{IPA|/ŋ/}} instead of {{IPA|/n/}}.
* [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]: Toronto is often pronounced by Torontonians without the second {{IPA|/t/}} and sometimes with the first syllable elided.
* [[Calgary|Calgary, Alberta]]: The majority of local Calgarians will pronounce the name of their city with two syllables {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|l|ɡ|ɹ|i}}, while tourists will use three {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|l|ɡ|ə|ɹ|i}}.

====In Malaysia====
* [[Genting Highlands]]: [[Malaysians]] pronounce it as {{IPA-ms|ˈɡentiŋ|}} (with a hard {{IPA|/ɡ/}}), whereas in English tends to be {{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|n|t|ɪ|ŋ}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/news/business/local-business/casino-shuffles-the-pack-with-revamp-1-6275895|title=Casino shuffles the pack with revamp|work=blackpoolgazette.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In the United Kingdom====
* [[Magdalen Street]], [[Oxford]]: The street is pronounced as {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|ɡ|d|əl|ɪ|n}} {{respell|MAG|dəl|in}} while the name of the [[Magdalen College, Oxford|College]] is always {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɔː|d|l|ɪ|n}} {{respell|MAWD|lin}}. This inconsistency prevents non-locals from the correct pronunciations, regardless of their default way of pronouncing.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Daniel, eds. P.Roach, J.Setter and J.Esling ''Cambridge English Pronouncing Dictionary'', 18th Edition, 2011, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Magdalen College]] and Magdalen Bridge, [[Cambridge]]: In both cases, locals pronounce Madgalen as {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɔː|d|l|ɪ|n}} {{respell|MAWD|lin}}.


====In the United States====
* [[Houston Street (Manhattan)|''Houston'' Street]], [[New York City]]: Locals pronounce the first syllable identically with "house" ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|aʊ|s|t|ən}}), while most visitors will employ the same pronunciation as in [[Houston|Houston, Texas]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|juː|s|t|ən}}). Houston Street is actually a corruption of the original name of Houstoun Street, named after [[Continental Congress]] Delegate [[William Houstoun (lawyer)|William Houstoun]], who pronounced his name in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New York Bookshelf; An Oddly Named Street, A Dark Night, a Gamy Club|date=Feb 8, 2004|work=The New York Times|page=CY12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nevada]]: Nevadans say {{IPAc-en|n|ɪ|ˈ|v|æ|d|ə}} {{respell|nih|VAD|ə}}. Visitors often say {{IPAc-en|n|ɪ|ˈ|v|ɑː|d|ə}} {{respell|nih|VAH|də}}. Additionally, there are a number of smaller towns in other states bearing the name Nevada pronounced yet another way, such as {{IPAc-en|n|ɪ|ˈ|v|eɪ|d|ə}} {{respell|nih|VAY|də}} in [[Nevada, Missouri]] and [[Nevada County, Arkansas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=794|title=Nevada County - Encyclopedia of Arkansas|work=encyclopediaofarkansas.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Similarly, in [[Colorado]]: Locals tend to render the state name as {{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|ɒ|l|ə|ˈ|r|æ|d|oʊ}}, whereas visitors are more likely to use {{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|ɒ|l|ə|ˈ|r|ɑː|d|oʊ}}.
* The US state of Oregon is home to a county, city, river, bay, state forest, museum, Native American tribe, and dairy processing company called [[Tillamook (disambiguation)|Tillamook]]. Residents pronounce it as {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɪ|l|ə|m|ʊ|k}}, while nonresidents often mistakenly say {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɪ|l|ə|m|uː|k}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Connelly |first=Dolly |date=Mar 1, 1970 |title=Mush!...And Then Some: A Tour Of The Great Northwest |journal=Los Angeles Times West Magazine |location=Los Angeles |publisher=Los Angeles Times |pages=20–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Portland, Oregon]]'s Couch Street is {{IPAc-en|k|uː|tʃ}}, rhyming with "pooch," unlike the identically-spelled sofa synonym pronounced {{IPAc-en|k|aʊ|tʃ}}.&lt;ref name="greiner"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Greiner |first=Tony |last2=Bridgewater |first2=Rachel |title=Portland: An eclectic introduction |journal=College &amp; Research Libraries News |volume=75 |issue=8 |date=2014 |pages=422–426}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Boise, Idaho]]: The city's name is commonly pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɔɪ|z|i}} {{respell|BOY|zee}}. However, locals actually pronounce it as {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɔɪ|s|i}} {{respell|BOY|see}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boiseweekly.com/boise/idaho-pronunciation-guide/Content?oid=1749831|title=Idaho Pronunciation Guide – Say it like a local|date=Aug 25, 2010|last=Green|first=Julia|publisher=''[[Boise Weekly]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Buena Vista, Colorado]]. Unlike other places bearing this name in the United States (typical pronunciations include {{IPAc-en|ˌ|b|w|ɛ|n|ə|_|ˈ|v|ɪ|s|t|ə|,_|ˌ|b|w|eɪ|-|,_|-|ˈ|v|iː|s|-}} {{respell|BWE|nə|_|VIS|tə|,_|BWAY|-,_-|VEES|-}}) the town in Colorado is called {{IPAc-en|ˌ|b|j|uː|n|ə|_|ˈ|v|ɪ|s|t|ə}} {{respell|BEW|nə|_|VIS|tə}} by locals.
* [[Quincy, Massachusetts]]: The city's name is commonly pronounced by non-locals as {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|w|ɪ|n|s|i}} {{respell|KWIN|see}}. However, [[South Shore (Massachusetts)|locals]] will pronounce it {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|w|ɪ|n|z|i}} {{respell|KWIN|zee}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quincyma.gov/Utilities/faq.cfm#15 |title=Quincy, MA - 404 |publisher=Quincyma.gov |date= |accessdate=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Likewise, [[Hull, Massachusetts]] would seem to be pronounced {{IPAc-en|h|ʌ|l}}, as in the front of a ship, but locals will invariably render it {{IPAc-en|h|ɔː|l}} homophonous to "hall", as in a corridor.
* [[Louisville, Kentucky]]: The name is pronounced by locals as {{IPAc-en|audio=Loouhvull.ogg|ˈ|l|uː|ə|v|əl}} {{respell|LOO|ə|vəl}}. However, non-locals will usually use {{IPAc-en|audio=Looeevil.ogg|ˈ|l|uː|iː|v|ɪ|l}} {{respell|LOO|ee|vil}}.
* [[Miami, Oklahoma]]: Locals from northeastern Oklahoma pronounce the name as {{IPAc-en|m|aɪ|ˈ|æ|m|ə}} {{respell|my|AM|ə}}, while others pronounce the name like the city in Florida, {{IPAc-en|m|aɪ|ˈ|æ|m|i}} {{respell|my|AM|ee}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigorrin.org/miami_kids.htm |title=Facts for Kids: Miami Indians (Miamis) |publisher=Bigorrin.org |date= |accessdate=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hicksville-ohio.com/History/history2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miamination.com/faq.html ]{{dead link|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Appalachia]]: Residents of the region pronounce it as {{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|p|ə|ˈ|l|æ|tʃ|ə}}, with short vowels, but non-locals rather pronounce it as {{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|p|ə|ˈ|l|eɪ|tʃ|ə|,_|-|ʃ|ə}}. The name was originally Native American, but came to English via Spanish as the local pronunciation is based on the Spanish equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;Walls, David (2006). "Appalachia." ''The Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press), pp. 1006–07.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged'' (Springfield, Mass.: Merriam-Webster, 1993), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Pierre: South Dakotans refer to the state capital as a one-syllable word ([[Help:IPA/English|/ˈpɪər/]]) rhyming with “beer”not like the French two-syllable name is typically pronounced [[Help:IPA/French|[ˈpjɛʁ]]]).
*[[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Nachitoches, Louisiana]]: Locals will recognize the city and parish name as being pronounced nack-a-dish while people unfamiliar with the name may pronounce it as nat-shi-toe-shez or some variation of that.

===Place-name terms===
* Locals refer to [[San Francisco]] as "SF", or simply "the City" within the context of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. Tourists may sometimes say "San Fran" or "Frisco".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Don-t-Call-It-Frisco-3043060.php|title=Don't Call It Frisco|work=SFGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebolditalic.com/articles/3271-don-t-call-it-frisco-the-history-of-san-francisco-s-nicknames|title=Don’t Call It Frisco: The History of San Francisco’s Nicknames|work=The Bold Italic}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Southern California]], locals generally use the article "the" preceding the number of a [[freeway]]. [[Northern California]] locals generally do not use "the" before a numerical freeway name. For example, Southern Californians usually refer to [[U.S. Route 101|Highway 101]] as "The 101," whereas Northern Californians will refer to it as simply "101."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanspeech.dukejournals.org/content/76/2/221.full.pdf?sid=dc6c8b23-3d37-4ebd-b28b-30ac80f124d2|title="The" Freeway in Southern California|work=American Speech}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/mr-roadshow/ci_29015047/roadshow-debate-highway-names-roars|title=Roadshow: The Debate on Highway Names Roars On|work=The San Jose Mercury News}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, people in the rest of the United States more often precede a freeway's route number with its highway classification, as in "U.S. 101" for a Federal highway or "Interstate 5" or "I-5" for an interstate highway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/71459/why-southern-californians-say-freeway-numbers|title=Why Southern Californians Say "The" Before Freeway Numbers|work=Mental Floss}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Long-time Democratic residents of [[Washington, D.C.]], will refer to [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport|Reagan National Airport]] as simply as "National," while Republicans and visitors to the area are more likely to call it by the name of the former president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2015/03/31/national-reagan-dca-17-years-later-locals-still-cant-agree-on-the-name-of-the-airport-in-question/|title=National?

* Additionally, many long-time residents of the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area will refer to it as "The DMV" (the ''' District, Maryland, ''' and '''Virginia ''', specifically referencing the Fairfax, Alexandria, and Arlington Counties of Virginia; the city itself; and the Montgomery and Prince George's Counties of Maryland). This frequently leads to outsiders confusing it with the local [[Department of Motor Vehicles]], or "Delmarva", the portmanteau of [[Delaware]], [[Maryland]], and [[Virginia]] (referring to the combined areas of the [[Eastern Shore of Maryland]], [[Eastern Shore of Virginia]], and [[Delaware]]), both of which can also be abbreviated to "DMV".

'''MIVILUDES''' (an acronym for the [[French language|French-language]] phrase ''Mission interministérielle de vigilance et de lutte contre les dérives sectaires'', i.e. "Interministerial Mission for Monitoring and Combatting Cultic Deviances") is a [[France|French]] [[government agency]], with responsibility for monitoring groups perceived &lt;!-- perceived by whom exactly ? --&gt; to constitute a threat to public order or that violate French law, coordinating the government response, informing the public about potential risks, and assisting victims. The agency was created in 2002.

==Functions==
The mission of MIVILUDES involves analysing "the phenomenon of movements with a [[cult]]ic character whose actions affront the [[rights of man]] and  fundamental liberties, or which constitute a threat to public order or which are contrary to the laws and regulations".&lt;ref&gt;From the ''[[Journal Officiel de la République Française|Journal Officiel]]'' of 28 November 2002, quoted in [[:fr:Mission interministérielle de vigilance et de lutte contre les dérives sectaires|Mission interministérielle de vigilance et de lutte contre les dérives sectaires]] : ''Sa mission est définie officiellement (dans le Journal Officiel du 28 novembre 2002) comme étant d'analyser « le phénomène des mouvements à caractère sectaire dont les agissements sont attentatoires aux droits de l'homme et aux libertés fondamentales ou constituent une menace à l'ordre public ou sont contraires aux lois et règlements ».''&lt;/ref&gt;

MIVILUDES provides information related to "cultic deviances" to the media, the French government, and individual members of the public. It recommends contacts and other organizations, and produces and archives documentation and discussion papers on groups considered cults.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miviludes.gouv.fr/spip.php?page=plan Mission Interministérielle de VIgilance et de LUtte contre les DÉrives Sectaires&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101013811/http://www.miviludes.gouv.fr/spip.php?page=plan |date=2007-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
===Background===
The French authorities created MIVILUDES as the successor to MILS (''Mission interministérielle de lutte contre les sectes''; English: "Interministerial Mission in the Fight Against Cults"), which itself functioned from 7 October 1998 as the successor to the ''Observatoire interministériel sur les sectes'' established on 9 May 1996. These organisations were in charge of co-ordinating government monitoring of cults. 

In February 1998, MILS, headed by [[Alain Vivien]], released its annual report on their monitoring of cults in France. The operations of MILS, and Alain Vivien's background as the head of an [[Anti-Cult Movement|anti-cult organization]] (he had served as President of the [[Centre Roger Ikor]] from 1997 to 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.ccmm.asso.fr/index.php3 |title=Centre de documentation, d'éducation et d'action Contre les Manipulations Mentales |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127111947/http://www.ccmm.asso.fr/index.php3 |archivedate=2007-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;), had occasionally received criticism from several human-rights organizations, such as the [[International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights]],&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.ihf-hr.org/viewbinary/viewhtml.php?doc_id=1797 |title=Open Letter to Alain Vivien about Religious Freedom in France |date=June 15, 2000 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050504010205/http://www.ihf-hr.org/viewbinary/viewhtml.php?doc_id=1797 |archivedate=May 4, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom]],{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} a US government agency. (See also [[About-Picard law#Reactions]]). In January 1999 Vivien requested and received police protection following threats and the burglary of his home.&lt;ref&gt;[[L'Humanité]], January 14, 1999; {{cite web|url=https://www.humanite.fr/journal/1999-01-14/1999-01-14-441385 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050430103350/http://www.humanite.fr/journal/1999-01-14/1999-01-14-441385 |archivedate=2005-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vivien resigned in June 2002 under criticism.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.cesnur.org/2002/fr_vivien.htm Alain Vivien Resigns from President of the French Anti-Cult Mission]&lt;/ref&gt;

===MIVILUDES===
MIVILUDES was created by a [[President of the French Republic|president]]ial decree on 28 November 2002. [[Jean-Louis Langlais]], a senior civil-servant at the [[Ministry of the Interior]], served as its president from 2002 to 2005.&lt;ref name="miviludes.gouv.fr"&gt;[http://www.miviludes.gouv.fr/spip.php?article138&amp;iddiv=2 Mission Interministérielle de VIgilance et de LUtte contre les DÉrives Sectaires&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013110316/http://www.miviludes.gouv.fr/spip.php?article138&amp;iddiv=2 |date=2007-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Announcing the formation of MIVILUDES, the French government acknowledged the criticism that MILS had received from outside France for certain activities that could be considered in violation of [[religious freedom]]. The decree establishing MIVILUDES&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miviludes.gouv.fr/spip.php?rubrique162&amp;iddiv=1 Mission Interministérielle de VIgilance et de LUtte contre les DÉrives Sectaires&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026085807/http://www.miviludes.gouv.fr/spip.php?rubrique162&amp;iddiv=1 |date=2007-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
referred to MILS only indirectly in announcing the abrogation (in Article 8) of the decree establishing MILS. 

In an interview in March 2003, Langlais categorised the fight as not against "sects", but against "sectarian deviances". He stated that current French law lacks a definition for a "sect" and, therefore "the law cannot define sectarian deviances". Nevertheless, he portrayed the role of MIVILUDES as contributing to "defining what could simply be an administrative jurisprudence".&lt;ref&gt;'France and "cults": a new orientation' - Interview with Jean-Louis Langlais, by Willy Fautré. ''Compass Direct'', 5 April 2003. [http://www.religioscope.info/article_138.shtml Available online; retrieved 2007-01-28 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 report by the [[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom]] concluded with an assessment that the restructuring of the main French agency concerned with this issue — referring to MILS being replaced by MIVILUDES — had improved religious freedoms in France.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean-Michel Roulet became president of MIVILUDES in October 2005,&lt;ref name="miviludes.gouv.fr"/&gt; followed by [[Georges Fenech]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miviludes.gouv.fr/-Historique-?iddiv=2 Historique] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507073958/http://www.miviludes.gouv.fr/-Historique-?iddiv=2 |date=2011-05-07 }}//La MIVILUDES&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8411">The '''Mainz Diocesan Feud''' ({{lang-de|Mainzer Erzstiftsfehde}}), also known as the '''Baden-Palatine War''' (''Badisch-Pfälzischer Krieg''), took place in 1461/1462 and was a warlike conflict for the throne of the [[Electorate of Mainz]].

== Background ==
[[File:Schedelsche Weltchronik - Mainz.jpg|thumb|Mainz at the end of the 15th century]]
In 1459 the ''[[Domkustos]]'', [[Diether of Isenburg]], was elected, with a small majority, beating [[Adolph II of Nassau|Adolph of Nassau]] to become the new [[Archbishop]] of [[Electorate of Mainz|Mainz]]. Diether immediately had to join the so-called anti-Palatinate alliance which had fallen into a dispute in 1458 with the Count Palatine, [[Frederick I of the Palatinate|Frederick I]]. Diether forged an alliance and marched to war against the Count Palatine, but lost the decisive battle of [[Pfeddersheim]] in July 1460.

Because Diether was able to achieve his papal confirmation only with some difficulty and by paying a large amount of money  (''Servitiengeld'', 20,000 [[guilder]]s), he opposed the political, legal, and financial demands of both Emperor and Pope. Pope [[Pius II]] thus sought his replacement by Adolph of Nassau who had been defeated in the 1459 election. He [[Anathema|banished]] Diether on 21 August 1461 and declared him deposed, citing Diether's oppositional attitude towards the Church and Emperor [[Frederick III (HRR)|Frederick III]], Diether's reform efforts, and his demands for abolition of papal [[annates]]. Adolph of Nassau was appointed by the Pope as the new Archbishop of Mainz and enthroned on 1 October 1461. The city of [[Mainz]], however, continued to support Diether, who refused to vacate the archbishop's throne.

== Course ==
Adolph allied himself with the Archbishop of [[Trier]], [[John II of Baden]]; the Bishop of Metz, [[George of Baden]]; the Bishop of Speyer, [[John II Nix of Hoheneck]]; and Count [[Ulrich V of Württemberg]]. Margrave [[Charles I of Baden]] at first tried to mediate between the warring factions, then took the side of his brother, Bishop George of [[Bishopric of Metz|Metz]], who was in Adolph's camp, thus precipitating the Baden-Palatinate war, an attempt to seize the disputed bishopric by force.

On Diether's side were the city council of Mainz, his brother Louis, and Prince-Elector [[Frederick I of the Palatinate]], originally an enemy of Diether's. For his assistance, Frederick was given the towns of [[Lorsch]], [[Heppenheim (Bergstraße)|Heppenheim]] and [[Bensheim]].

Initially the Baden troops devastated the Palatine estates left of the Rhine, then advanced alongside those from Speyer and Württemberg up the eastern side of the Rhine and rampaged through the Palatine lands there too.

In summer 1462, those on the side of the alliance under Adolph of Nassau believed rumours that Count Palatine Frederick and his troops were holding on in Bavaria in order to stand by the Duke in a [[feud]] against the [[Principality of Ansbach|Margrave of Ansbach]]. Under the assumption that the Palatinate was therefore undefended, Baden and Württemberg troops marched from [[Bretten]] with 8,000 men and invaded the state. They advanced, burning and plundering, from Speyer over the [[Rhine]] to [[Seckenheim]]. Because Frederick I had, however, not stayed in Bavaria, Adolph's forces were surprised and heavily defeated in the forest near Seckenheim by Frederick I and the counts of [[House of Leiningen|Leiningen]] and [[County of Katzenelnbogen|Katzenelnbogen]], because the mounted vanguard of the alliance had felt so unthreatened that they had strayed too far ahead of their foot soldiers. Margrave Charles I and his brother, Bishop George of Metz, were wounded and taken prisoner. With the capture of Count Ulrich V of Württemberg soon afterwards by [[Keckhans von Gemmingen|Hans von Gemmingen]] this phase of the war came to an end. His victory in the [[Battle of Seckenheim]] earned Frederick the nickname "the Victorious" (''der Siegreiche''). The name of the settlement of [[Mannheim-Friedrichsfeld|Friedrichsfeld]] ("Frederick's field"), built on the site and now a district of [[Mannheim]], commemorates that event.

Frederick I had the prisoners taken to his castle at  [[Heidelberg Castle|Heidelberg]] and put in chains until the ransoms demanded by him were paid. Margrave Charles had to pay 25,000 [[guilder]]s, hand over [[Sponheim]] as a pledge and agree [[Pforzheim]] as a [[fief]] of the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]]. The Bishop of Metz had to pay 45,000 guilders for his release. Most importantly for Frederick, though, the victory had sealed the long-term security of his position as [[prince-elector]].

But the diocesan feud did not end there. Further battles cost many lives and resulted in the devastation of all the settlements, and the town of Mainz itself suffered severe damage. In the night of 28 October 1462, as a result of the betrayal of some of Mainz's citizens, Adolph of Nassau broke into the town through the gate called the ''Gautor'' with 500 men and, after 12 hours of street fighting took possession of the town. 400 men lost their lives and Adolph's people plundered and sacked parts of the town including the former Dominican monastery. As a punishment for its support of Diether, Adolph removed the town's privileges of freedom and thus its status as a [[Free City of Mainz|free town]]; the town came under the rule of a [[vicedominus]] appointed by the Archbishop. The following day the citizens were summoned to the ''Dietmarkt'' market place. All 800 citizens who appeared were driven out of the town; about 400 of them were released again some time later and allowed to remain in Mainz.

== Conclusion ==
The diocesan feud itself ended only after several attempts at mediation in October 1463. Diether of Isenburg stood down and recognised Adolph as his successor in the [[Treaty of Zeilsheim]]. He himself was paid off with a considerable sum of money and a small principality, created from the Mainz estate, consisting of the towns of [[Frankfurt-Höchst|Höchst]], [[Hanau-Steinheim|Steinheim]] and [[Dieburg]].

The alliances of both contenders for the archbishop's throne had been bought at considerable cost to both their personal and the archiepiscopal estate. A number of castles and towns were transferred to the Palatinate, Hesse and, briefly, even Saxony. The settlement of that debt remained a dominant issue in the Archbishopric in the coming years.

After the death of Adolph in 1475, Diether of Isenburg was once more elected as archbishop by the Mainz cathedral chapter and confirmed by Pope [[Sixtus IV]]. Diether reigned without further conflict until his death in 1482.

==Synonyms==
Mashups are known by a number of different names:
* Bootlegs (mostly in Europe, not to be confused with unofficial [[remix]]es)
* Boots (but not "booty" which is a branch of electro)
* Mash-ups
* Mashed hits
* Smashups (or smash-ups)
* Bastard pop (as in the combined songs are unofficial; this term is rarely used anymore)
* Blends
* Cutups (or cut ups, a term originally coined by [[William S. Burroughs]] to describe some of his literary experiments that involved literally "cutting up" different texts and rearranging the pieces to create a new piece.)
* Powermixing (usually the pace has to be sped up to allow for more song to be played and thus cannot play any single blend for the full length of the song)
* Crossovers, but it is in a form of mashup, or version vs. version.
In addition, more traditional terms such as "edits" or (unauthorized) "remixes" are favored by many "[[Bootleg recording|bootleggers]]" (also known as 'leggers).{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==History==
The practice of assembling new songs from purloined elements of other tracks stretches back to the beginnings of recorded music. If one extends the definition beyond the realm of pop, precursors can be found in [[musique concrète]], as well as the classical practice of (re-)arranging traditional [[folk music|folk]] material and the jazz tradition of reinterpreting [[Jazz standard|standards]]. In addition, many elements of mashup culture have antecedents in [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and the [[DIY ethic]] of [[punk rock|punk]] as well as overlap with the [[free culture movement]].

===Precursors===

==== "The Flying Saucer" ====
In 1956, [[Bill Buchanan (songwriter)|Bill Buchanan]] and [[Dickie Goodman]] released what they called a "break-in" song, (i.e. material from one song would "break-in" to another) called "The Flying Saucer". The track, a reinterpretation of [[Orson Welles]]' celebrated ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio)|War of the Worlds]]'' mock-emergency broadcast interspliced with musical snippets comically dramatizing the portentous [[patter]] of the announcer, spawned a raft of imitations. Goodman had several other similar hits in the 1960s and 1970s.

====Novelty records====
There have been a number of novelty records and one-off hits that have included uncleared samples. The song "[[Your Woman]]" by [[White Town]] features an uncredited sample from a 1932 song "My Woman" by the Lew Stone Band taken from the soundtrack of the [[Dennis Potter]] series ''[[Pennies From Heaven (TV series)|Pennies From Heaven]]''. Other notable one-off bootlegs include [[The DNA Disciples|DNA]]'s dance remix of [[Suzanne Vega]]'s "[[Tom's Diner]]"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.billboard.com/music/suzanne-vega&lt;/ref&gt;(1990) and "You Got The Love" by [[The Source (band)|The Source]] featuring [[Candi Staton]] (1991). Vega received quite a few unsolicited mixes of her (a cappella) song, and eventually issued an entire CD of "Tom's Diner" mixes, one notable example being "Jeannie's Diner", in which a resung verse based on Vega's composition describes the premise of the situation comedy "I Dream of Jeannie". "Tom's Diner" is likely to be the first song that was "mash mixed" as we now know the process.

One series was John Morales' (later one half of M and M productions) "Deadly Medleys", in which he mixed-up disco hits of the moment to form beat-consistent collages. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Dutch producer Jaap Eggermont produced the [[Stars on 45]] series of records. These records attempted to cram as many hits as possible into the space of a three and a half-minute pop song, and are more accurately described as medleys. A similar series by [[Mirage (medley group)|Mirage]] in the late 1980s took this further by densely layering the songs on its "Jack Mix" records so that these were very close to later mashups.

Singer-producer [[Jonathan King]] anticipated the mashup genre with several novelty singles. In 1987, King accused the [[Pet Shop Boys]] of plagiarizing the melody of [[Cat Stevens]]' "[[Wild World (song)|Wild World]]" for their song "[[It's A Sin]]". To prove the point, King recorded a version of "Wild World" with an arrangement virtually identical to that of "It's A Sin". King performed an analogous stunt with a version of "[[He's So Fine]]" by [[The Chiffons]] arranged in the style of [[George Harrison]]'s "[[My Sweet Lord]]", making a cheeky reference to the plagiarism suit over the similarities between the two songs.

[[Little Roger and the Goosebumps]] released their single "Gilligan's Island (Stairway)", later renamed "Stairway to Gilligan's Island" in May 1978 on their own Splash Records label. The song combines the lyrics to the theme song of the television show ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'' with the music of "[[Stairway to Heaven]]" by [[Led Zeppelin]]. Later in 1978, Damaskas and [[Barnes &amp; Barnes]] were inspired by Little Roger and the Goosebumps to record "A Day in the Life of Green Acres," a song that combined the music of [[The Beatles]]' "[[A Day in the Life]]" with the lyrics to the theme song of the television show ''[[Green Acres]]''.

====Frank Zappa====
In the 1970s, [[Frank Zappa]] developed a technique he called "[[xenochrony]]" in which a guitar solo was extracted from its original context and placed into a completely different song. His recording engineer referred to this as "the Ampex guitar". In his rock opera ''[[Joe's Garage]]'' (1979), for example, Zappa's xenochrony can be heard on every track apart from ''Watermelon in Easter Hay''.

"Rubber Shirt" from the album ''[[Sheik Yerbouti]]'' consists of a bass track and a drum track taken from two different live performances melded together in the studio.

====John Zorn====
The 1990 [[John Zorn]] album ''[[Naked City (album)|Naked City]]'' features a version of [[Ornette Coleman]]'s "[[Lonely Woman (composition)|Lonely Woman]]" set over the bassline of [[Roy Orbison]]'s "[[Pretty Woman (song)|Pretty Woman]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Is9QbUl1PJ4C&amp;pg=PA286 |title=Dancing in Your Head|publisher=Books.google.co.uk|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====John Oswald====
[[John Oswald (composer)|John Oswald]] has been devising illegitimate compositions since the late 1960s. His 1975 track "Power" married frenetic [[Led Zeppelin]] guitars to the impassioned exhortations of a Southern American evangelist at the same time that [[hip hop music|hip hop]] was discovering the potency of the same (and related) kinds of ingredients. Similarly, his 1990 track "Vane", which pitted two different versions of the song "[[You're So Vain]]" (the [[Carly Simon]] original and a cover by [[Faster Pussycat]]) against each other, was a blueprint for the contemporary mashup subgenre, glitch pop. Oswald coined the term "[[plunderphonics]]" to describe his illegitimate craft. In 1993, he released ''Plexure''. Arguably his most ambitious composition to date, it attempted to microsample the history of CD music up to that point (1982–1992) in a 20-minute collage of bewildering complexity. The ambition of this piece would later be recalled by the British bootlegger [[Osymyso]], whose "[[Intro-Inspection]]" captured the pop-junkie feel of ''Plexure''. Osymyso, who at the time was unaware of Oswald's work, used the same structure of an accelerando (arranging his source material in order from the slowest tempo to the fastest) to link a few bars each of 100 songs, creating a simpler sound than the thousands of overlapping and morphing pop "electroquotations" in ''Plexure''.

====Pink Project====
In 1982, [[Italo disco]] composer and producer Stefano Pulga, under the name [[Pink Project]], had a substantial hit with "Disco Project", a completely re-recorded version of [[The Alan Parsons Project]]'s instrumental track "Mammagamma" (from the album ''[[Eye in the Sky (album)|Eye in the Sky]]''), using "Sirius" (from the same album) as an intro, and featuring the schoolchildren's choir vocals (also entirely re-recorded by female session vocalists) from [[Pink Floyd]]'s "[[Another Brick in the Wall#Part 2|Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2]]" on top of the Parsons track. Technically more similar to a medley of [[cover version]]s (as it did not include any elements directly taken from the original records) than to a mashup, the record was nevertheless identified with the nascent genre by Italian radio DJs.

====Negativland====
Though [[Negativland]] are seldom acknowledged as musical antecedents of mashups, lacking perhaps the sense of fun many contemporary practitioners seek in their craft, their struggle against various forms of "censorship" (in their terms) and legal coercion (for instance, their single "U2" was one of the first pieces of music to be withdrawn for its use of unauthorised samples) has made them poster children for some mashup commentators who approach the issue from a more critical perspective, and with an eye to the complicated cultural issues raised by both accidental and deliberate plundering within music and culture generally.

====The Tape-beatles====
Also known as "Public Works", [[The Tape-beatles]] have used collage techniques to create works of materials appropriated from various sources.

====Double Dee and Steinski====
Working under the name [[Steinski]], New York [[copywriter]] DJ Steve Stein began (in conjunction with engineer and fellow studio boffin Doug "Double Dee" DiFranco) the next chapter in the evolution of illicit pop by producing a trio of underground 12" singles (entitled "The Payoff Mix" (1983), "Lesson 2 (The James Brown Mix)" (1984) and "Lesson 3 (History of Hiphop)" (1985)) which exerted a powerful influence on an entire generation of "samplists".

====Evolution Control Committee====
In 1994, the experimental band [[Evolution Control Committee]] released the first modern mashup tracks on their hand-made cassette album, ''Gunderphonic''. These "Whipped Cream Mixes" combined a pair of [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] a cappellas with instrumentals by [[Herb Alpert]] and the [[Tijuana Brass]]. First released on home-made cassettes in early 1992, it was later pressed on 7" vinyl, and distributed by [[Eerie Materials]] in the mid-1990s, the tracks gained some degree of notoriety on [[college radio]] stations in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evolution-control.com/sounds/gunderphonic/index.htm] {{dead link|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance===

==== ''2 Many DJs'' and "A Stroke of Genie-us" ====
The name [[Pop Will Eat Itself]] was taken from an ''[[NME]]'' feature on the band [[Jamie Wednesday]], written by [[David Quantick]], which proposed the theory that because popular music simply recycles good ideas continuously, the perfect pop song could be written by [combining] the best of those ideas into one track. Hence, Pop Will Eat Itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sickamongthepure.com/files/2002/07/Mansell/Mansell.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041010210309/http://www.sickamongthepure.com/files/2002/07/Mansell/Mansell.html|title=Who the hell is Clint Mansell?|archivedate=10 October 2004|publisher=Sickamongthepure.com|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement gained momentum again in 2001 with the release of the ''2 Many DJs'' album, ''[[As Heard on Radio Soulwax Pt. 2]]'', by [[Soulwax]]'s Dewaele brothers, which combined 45 different tracks; the same year a remix of [[Christina Aguilera]]'s "[[Genie in a Bottle]]" was also released by [[Freelance Hellraiser]], which coupled the pop star with the raucous guitars of "[[Hard To Explain]]" by New York's [[The Strokes]] in an infectious concoction entitled "A Stroke of Genie-us".&lt;ref name="Barely Legal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2002-02-05/music/barely-legal/|title=Barely Legal  |first=Douglas|last=Wolk|date=21 January 2008|publisher=Villagevoice.com|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Software tools====
As a result of this, industry standard tools such as the [[digital audio workstation]] [[Cubase]] and the sound editors [[Wavelab]], [[Soundforge]] and [[Cool Edit Pro]] quickly became ubiquitous. Moreover, new tools such as [[Ableton Live]] and [[Sonic Foundry]]'s (now [[Magix]]'s) [[ACID Pro]] were tweaked to accommodate the needs of this new "scene". Most notably, such features as beat-mapping (a technique that simplifies the synchronization of samples of different tempos) and online previewing (allowing the composer to audition a sample, playing at the right pitch and tempo, alongside their existing composition) made it easy for many people with musical ability but little professional studio experience to knock together new combinations in a fraction of the time it would take with traditional tools, such as the magnetic tape [[John Oswald (composer)|John Oswald]] (and even [[Coldcut]]) slaved over in their early days.

[[Go Home Productions|Mark Vidler]], known as Go Home Productions, summarized it by saying the benefits of such technology of AcidPro: "You don't need a distributor, because your distribution is the internet. You don't need a record label, because it's your bedroom, and you don't need a recording studio, because that's your computer. You do it all yourself."

==== Get Your Bootleg On, Mashuptown, Bootie, Boomselection, A.D.D ====
Around 2001–2002, the blog Boomselection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boomselection.info/|title=DYMTEST|publisher=Boomselection.info|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was launched. It publicised various challenges which resulted in hundreds, if not thousands, of new bootlegs being uploaded to sites around the world. While the scene began as a primarily British phenomenon, the U.S., France and Germany are currently the hotbeds of the modern mashup movement. However, there are notable bootleggers to be found in practically every corner of the globe – wherever an Internet connection and a record collection can be found – including Australia, Belgium, Switzerland, and Sweden.

The Get Your Bootleg on site&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gybo5.com/|title=GYBO - Index page|publisher=Gybo5.com|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (affectionately abbreviated to GYBO) became an important launchpad for new mashup tunes, and was the home of a lively community of bootleggers who offered critiques of new songs, tips for newbies, pointers on where to find a cappellas, legal advice, publicity for mashup events and general discussion of issues surrounding the mashup phenomenon.

The name "Get Your Bootleg On" comes from the [[Missy Elliott]] track "[[Get Ur Freak On]]", which alongside [[Eminem]]’s "[[Without Me (Eminem song)|Without Me]]" remains perhaps the most bootlegged, manipulated, remixed and reinterpreted song from the heyday of the genre. Other popular, frequently bootlegged artists include [[Britney Spears]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Beyoncé Knowles|Beyoncé]].

In early 2005, Boomselection retired itself after a long period of inactivity. The year also marked a series of cease-and-desist orders brought against a number of bootleg sites, and in early 2006 GYBO received its first such notice. To survive, the site prohibited the posting of direct links to copyrighted material within the forums, but allowed users to post links to their own sites containing such material, the defence being that now GYBO was no more in violation of copyright law than Google. For the most part, the community has rallied around the site, and continues to support it in its new form.

The void left by Boomselection's demise was rapidly replaced by Mashuptown&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mashuptown.com|title=Mashuptown.com|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was started in early 2005 and is currently the biggest blog source of mashups on the Internet. The site has recently become the official supplier of mashups to [[Adam Curry]]'s [[Daily Source Code]] [[podcast]].

Also in 2005, [[Bootie (club night)|Bootie]], the biggest bootleg mashup party in the world, began its monthly Bootie Top 10&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bootieusa.com/blog/labels/Top10.html |title=Bootie Blog |publisher=Bootieusa.com |accessdate=18 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222011812/http://www.bootieusa.com/blog/labels/Top10.html |archivedate=22 December 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; where it posts for free download its ten best mashups, as selected by Bootie creators and DJs [[A Plus D]]. Launched in San Francisco in 2003, Bootie was the first club night in the United States dedicated solely to the burgeoning art form of the bootleg mashup, and now hosts monthly parties in several cities around the globe, including Los Angeles, Paris, Boston, Munich, and New York City. The party's slogan, "Music for the A.D.D. Generation" also inspired the creation of "A.D.D", Israel's first mash-up dedicated party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jam, Billy|url= http://www.newyorkpress.com/20/20/music/Music3.cfm|title= Music For Generation ADD: Mashups quietly mature into a thriving subculture|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725000000/http://www.newyorkpress.com/20/20/music/Music3.cfm |archive-date= July 25, 2008|work=[[New York Press]]|date= May 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bonna Music and "Enjoy the Sheket"====
Legal mashups are hard to find, but in some relatively small music markets, legal mashups have been released. Some say that this is because publishers have understood the potential of clearing the rights of major international artist to be combined with local repertoires, to create a wider consumption for both artists on a given track.

In Israel, for example, a group called Bonna Music remixed the [[Depeche Mode]] song "[[Enjoy the Silence]]" with Balagan's "Sheket" ({{lang-he|שקט}}; "Silence"). The mashup was approved by [[Martin Gore]] and released officially a month before [[Depeche Mode]]'s new album ''[[Playing the Angel]]'' in 2005. It was a major hit locally and when Depeche Mode's first single was released they were more welcome in a market where the local repertoire is dominant.

====''Good Copy Bad Copy''====
''[[Good Copy Bad Copy]]'' is a 2007 documentary about the current state of copyright and culture. It has a heavy focus on the mashup community, containing interviews with [[Girl Talk (musician)|Girl Talk]] and [[Danger Mouse (music producer)|Danger Mouse]] that reveal an emerging understanding of digital works and the obstacle to their authoring copyright presents.

====''Glee''====
{{Main article|Glee (TV series)}}
Mash-ups have been featured on many episodes of the popular American TV series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]''. They first appeared in the episode "[[Vitamin D (Glee)|Vitamin D]]", which featured mashing up [[Bon Jovi]]'s "[[It's My Life (Bon Jovi song)|It's My Life]]" with [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]]'s "[[Confessions Part II]]" and [[Beyoncé|Beyoncé Knowles]]'s "[[Halo (Beyoncé Knowles song)|Halo]]" with "[[Walking on Sunshine (Katrina and the Waves song)|Walking on Sunshine]]" by [[Katrina and the Waves]].

====''DJ Hero''====
{{Main article|DJ Hero}}
The 2009 video game ''[[DJ Hero]]'' brought mash-ups together with gameplay elements from the ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' series using many of the same songs that are routinely cut-up in the online remixing scene. Notably, the tracks which use musical ideas from "[[Bitter Sweet Symphony]]" credit the sample source [[Andrew Oldham Orchestra]] rather than [[The Verve]], even though the Verve's use of the sample and the surrounding legal controversy is what popularized the frequent use of the sample in mash-ups.

====''RIP: A Remix Manifesto''====
{{Main article|RiP!: A Remix Manifesto}}
''RIP!: A Remix Manifesto'' is an [[open source]] documentary created by Brett Gaylor and Greg Gillis ([[Girl Talk (musician)|Girl Talk]]). The film consists of a remix of clips submitted by numerous contributors to the [[Open Source Cinema]] project. It focuses in particular on the legal "grey area" of remixing existing copyrighted works.

===Legal issues===

====Copyright Act of 1976====
*Lists the rights of copyright holders in the United States, including several copyright provision amendments. It became a law in October 1976 and was implemented in January 1978. 
*Mashup artists are permitted to remake an original song as long as the new song is substantially similar to the original song. In turn, the mashup artist must pay the original artist $0.94 for every copy of the song they sell for a profit. 
*Asking permission to use the song is not required, as long as payment is made.

====Fair Use Law====
*There are 4 factors a piece of work being considered for infringement must go through:
**1. Purpose and character of the use
**2. Nature of the work being used
**3. Amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the whole
**4. Effect on the market for the original

==Subgenres==

===A vs B===
{{See also|List of mashup songs}}

The original manifestation of mashups in the 2000s was putting an a cappella against a completely different backing track, in order to make a "third song". Following "A Stroke of Genie-us" in 2001, the genre has continued to focus on this basic premise.

Another notable "versus" song is "Zombi – [[Zombie Nation (band)|Zombie Nation]]" which combined [[Zombie Nation (band)|Zombie Nation]]'s "[[Kernkraft 400]]" with [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]]'s ''Zombi'' theme and was featured on the official soundtrack of the film ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]''.

In addition, [[Go Home Productions]], [[Party Ben]] and [[DJ BC]], amongst many others, have produced a number of critically acclaimed songs in this vein, and in some instances have secured record deals on the back of these exercises, which arguably serve as "demo MP3s" of their musical and production skills.

Another example of a legitimate release on the back of an unofficial one can be seen in [[Illicit (Dance music group)|Illicit]]'s "Sneaky Armada",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Various-Exquisite-EP/release/72643|title=Sneaky Armada|publisher=Discogs.com|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which combined [[Groove Armada]]'s "[[I See You Baby]]" with [[Teddy Pendergrass]]'s "You Can't Hide From Yourself". This was subsequently re-played, re-vocalised and re-released on [[Azuli Records|Azuli]]'s Yola label as "Cheeky Armada"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Illicit-Feat-Gramma-Funk-Cheeky-Armada/release/1069370|title=Cheeky Armada|publisher=Discogs.com|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in September 2001 when it reached number 72 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, David. Guinness Book of British Hit Singles &amp; Albums. Guinness World Records Ltd 17th edition (2004), p. 267 {{ISBN|0-85112-199-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illicit also released numerous other unofficial "versus" songs during the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/label/Not+On+Label+(Illicit+Remix+Series)|title=Not On Label (Illicit Remix Series)|publisher=Discogs.com|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not all mash-ups are as simple as A vs B. In some cases, DJs will mash 3, 4, 5, and even 6 songs to form one complete track. Mixing more than two tracks together can be a daunting task, and it requires a great deal of skill. Notably, [[DJ Earworm]] has combined the yearly top 25 songs according to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' into a single mashup since 2007, which has spawned similar creations from popular DJs such as Robin Skouteris or Daniel Kim. These mashups are typically uploaded to [[YouTube]] and attract a lot of attention in the pop culture world.

[[Girl Talk (musician)|Girl Talk]] is known for his style of multi-track mashing; most of his mashups contain samples from 20–30 different tracks. Girl Talk is famous for his style of "cutting" through different songs and often building to the climax of a song, upon which the song settles into a groove before cutting away again.

===Version vs Version===
Mixing two or more versions of a song to create a duet or alternative version of a song is what a version vs version is set to accomplish. It can mix two different versions of a song, such as a ballad and original version, or a [[cover version]] of the song. Some of the more popular version to version mixes are language mixes, which is mixing multiple languages into one song. A slightly less popular style of this is mashing two different remixes or the original and a specific remix of a song together. Version vs Version mashups usually have the same original instrumental but sometimes it is changed to benefit the song.

===Abstract Mash Ups===
Music [[collage]]s which refer to [[avant-garde]] music practice and [[Musique Concrète]]. These are not intended for the dance floor and are made using all types of music and sound as valid sound sources to be played simultaneously and often manipulated. Beat matching and stylistic or aesthetic similarities are not an important factor in these mash ups. Chaos, dissonance and harmony are all possible results.

An early example of this can be heard on [[John Cage]]'s multi-radio composition "Imaginary Landscapes No. 4" (1951) for 12 radios, 24 performers and a conductor. Perhaps the most famous Abstract Mash Up is [[The Beatles]] "[[Revolution 9]]" featuring on their White Album from 1968 which includes samples of conversations, classical music and edited and manipulated samples played simultaneously. Other examples of the [[Psychedelic music|psychedelic]] nature of these mash ups can be heard on "[[Heart Beat, Pig Meat]]" by [[Pink Floyd]] from the soundtrack to the film ''[[Zabriskie Point (film)|Zabriskie Point]]''; "[[The Beatles Play the Residents and the Residents Play the Beatles]]" and the album ''[[The Third Reich 'n Roll]]'' by [[The Residents]] and early turntable work by [[Christian Marclay]].

A current (2013) example of Abstract Mash Ups can be heard on radio shows by [[Joel Cahen]] ({{aka}} 'Spax') on [[Resonance fm]] in London. The series of shows which began in 2005, feature live abstract mash ups using MP3s, turntables, CDs, DVDs and field recordings as simultaneously played sound sources. The third season of this series, ''Soundsoup'', March 2008–April 2010, veered the style towards a more narrative based one.

===Glitch pop===
[[Glitch pop]] is a subgenre of the mashup scene which marries the [[Digital Signal Processing]] (DSP) wizardry associated with [[Kid 606]] and [[Tigerbeat6]] records to the ostensibly familiar contours of pop. Sometimes this is done in a spirit of "homage"; sometimes it serves merely as a form of ridicule and even vilification; often it is both at the same time.

An example of the "double science" at play in glitch pop is Skkatter's "Dirty Pop", which takes a song that is already an epic of carefully constructed digital micro-malfunctions ([[Brian Transeau|BT]]'s [[deconstruction]] of [[*NSYNC]]'s "Pop") and pushes it even further out to the margins of musical mayhem. Similarly, Australian bootlegger and glitch pop co-conspirator [[Dsico]] (real name Luke Collinson) has reworked a number of [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] tunes by such artists as [[The Neptunes]] and (again) *NSYNC in a spirit that is at once both satirical and steeped in [[Fan (aficionado)#Fanboy|fanboydom]]. In most cases these remixes render ostensibly mainstream songs "avant garde" and fresh, sometimes by working against the spirit of the original, but often by leveraging the sugar rush at the heart of much of the best contemporary pop, and adding sonic [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] to its emotional armoury.

===Audio-Viz Mash===
SiX DwArF is a non-commercial mashup artist from Scotland in the UK with a twist. He creates cross-genre mashup tunes but also invents mashup promo videos to go with them which feature on Mash TV, hosted on Veetle and on various video hosting sites. SiX DwArF also creates homemade promos to champion songs that do not already have one in which he feels deserves it, receiving praise from various artists. His modus operandi is: "There's no campaigns, zero commercial gain, no vested interests. Nothing is sacred. Don't do genre... it's stereotype by another name."{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===Remixes===
Technically, all mashups are [[remix]]es. But while most are made up entirely of plundered material, some bootleggers have fused old a cappella tracks with completely new compositions of their own device. An example of popular remix artists that primarily remixes single songs but also mashes songs are [[The White Panda]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thewhitepanda.com/|title=The White Panda|website=www.thewhitepanda.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Chicago-based duo has emerged as one of the biggest upcoming DJs.

Another popular example with fans of [[J-pop|Japanese pop]] is ''Evil Morning'', an album which combines vocal tracks from [[Morning Musume]] and their associated artists with new instrumental tracks that rearrange or replay the original music in the style of [[hard rock]] or [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]].

===Bootleg albums===
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:GreyAlbum.gif|thumb|right|Promotional artwork by Justin Hampton. This was not used for the actual cover, but appeared on the Danger Mouse website.]] --&gt;
[[DJ Danger Mouse]]'s critically acclaimed remix project ''[[The Grey Album]]'' effectively launched a new pop subgenre. While [[The Beatles]] had made appearances on several mash-up tracks prior to this album (for instance PPM's "A Life in the Day" and JPL's "Let It Be Missy Elliott (Beatlesmix)"), ''The Grey Album'' distinguished itself by being made up entirely of samples from The Beatles' ''[[The Beatles (album)|White Album]]'' and vocals from [[Jay-Z]]'s ''[[The Black Album (Jay-Z)|The Black Album]]''. The project received considerable attention following [[EMI]]'s legal threats towards distributors of the album.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rambarran|first=Shara|year=2013|title=‘99 Problems’ but Danger Mouse Ain’t One: The Creative and Legal Difficulties of Brian Burton, ‘Author’ of The Grey Album|url=http://www.popular-musicology-online.com/issues/03/rambarran.html|journal=Popular Musicology|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another album is ''Jon Moskowitz Presents Blue Eyes Meets Bed-Stuy'', produced by DJ Cappel &amp; Smitty (2005). This is a remix/mash-up album of [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] and [[Frank Sinatra]]. The project was very well received, with major online and print coverage. It was conceived and executive produced by Jon Moskowitz. DJ Cappel and Smitty took The Notorious B.I.G.'s a cappellas and remixed them with notable Frank Sinatra songs, by contributing Sinatra's solos, hooks and choruses.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The ''Best of Bootie'' mashup compilation series is compiled and produced each year by [[A Plus D]], creators of the international mashup club [[Bootie (club night)|Bootie]]. The compilations have been released in December every year since 2005, and are annual Internet sensations, with each album garnering over 5000GB+ of downloads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boingboing.net/2007/01/11/mashup-bestof-2006-a.html|title=Mashup best-of 2006 album|work=Boing Boing|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This is NOT a link farm! Only bootleg albums of note and recognition should be listed here, such as albums actually referenced in this article. Please do not add vanity links. They will be hastily removed. Bootleg albums with mainstream references already listed on Wikipedia ARE TO BE LEFT UNTOUCHED. Taste-based deletions will be reported as acts of vandalism.--&gt;

===Cut-ups===
While there is some overlap between the terms "cut up" and "mash up", the former has increasingly come to refer to pieces that rely on the humour (or pathos) of reconstructed spoken word and video material. This may be due to the fact that the term "cut up" was used decades earlier by novelist and artist [[William S. Burroughs]] to refer to his literary cutups as well as his tape recorder experiments, which featured spliced vocal tracks in the same way that his written cut-ups literally cut up and rearranged various texts.

The best known cutups remix political speeches and rallies to satirical effect. Simon Hunt, under the pseudonym [[Pauline Pantsdown]] used the speeches of [[Pauline Hanson]], an anti-immigration, controversial Australian politician to parodic effect in the songs [[I Don't Like It]] and [[Backdoor Man]]. Johan Söderberg's "Endless Love", in which [[George W. Bush]] and [[Tony Blair]] appear to serenade each other like lovebirds, [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]]' "[[Bushwhacked MP3|Bushwhacked]]", a ''[[Detournement|détournement]]'' of Bush's 2003 [[State of the Union Address]], or ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20090906090215/http://onsfoudkilao.neufblog.com/reggaetime/2005/07/sarko_skanking.html Sarkoskanking]'' by Polémix and La Voix Off, a cut-off of [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]'s speeches.

Notable cut up artists include [[Cassetteboy]], [[Osymyso]], [[Rx (band)|rx]], Cartel Communique and [[Evolution Control Committee]].

==Notable mash-up artists==

===Girl Talk===
One of the most well known artists in the mashup industry is Gregg Michael Gillis, otherwise known as [[Girl Talk (musician)|Girl Talk]]. He studied engineering in college and then quit the industry in 2007 in order to focus solely on his music career. He is originally from Pittsburgh, PA and is one of many artists under the record label, [[Illegal Art]], which specializes in music sampling. Other artists with Illegal Art include Junk Culture and People Like Us. Girl Talk has released five albums with Illegal Art: [[Secret Diary]], [[Unstoppable (Girl Talk album)|Unstoppable]], [[Night Ripper]], [[Feed the Animals]], and [[All Day (Girl Talk album)|All Day]]. Girl Talk does not believe that they are violating any factor of the Fair Use Laws as the law does not specify for mashups and remixes and the length of the song that is used. Thus, Girl Talk feels that they should not have to pay the sustained artists a fee for the work they are using. However, others feel that Girl Talk is violating the Fair Use Law and should be penalized.

===Djs from Mars===
With the rise of [[electronic dance music]] in the mainstream media, Italian duo [[Djs from Mars]] became a notable act in mash-up making.
Most well known for mixing opposite genres, on a 128BPM club beat, the duo has toured the world extensively and their mashups have been played by DJs such as [[David Guetta]], [[Bob Sinclar]], [[Martin Solveig]], among others.
Wearing box-masks over their heads, the satirical duo has been mixing [[Lady Gaga]] with [[Metallica]], [[Skrillex]] with [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] and over 30 different songs into one with their "Megashuffle MultiBootleg". Djs from Mars' success was confirmed in March 2011, when the pair opened a show for [[Tiesto]], in Atlantic City.

===DJ Earworm===
Jordan Roseman (a.k.a. [[DJ Earworm]]) gained popularity when he came out with his mashup "United States of Pop" in 2007. The mashup contains the top 25 songs of the year according to the [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 2007]]. He has since released one at the end of each year. Earworm has also released mashups he has done for Capital FM's Summertime Ball since 2010. In addition, Earworm was asked to create multiple mixes for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] to be played at various venues throughout London.

===Mashd N Kutcher===
[[Mashd N Kutcher]] are an Australian live electronic act established in 2014. The duo found acclaim through the mashup releases ‘Mash Machine’, combining vocal rock and pop anthems with current electronic club music.

It was not until 2004 though that they received attention with their album ''[[A Night at the Hip-Hopera]]''. The album combined the music of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] with various music selections from rap, movies, and other various sources. In 2005, Eric Kleptone was awarded the [[Webby Award]] for Artist of the Year by the [[International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/specialwin.php]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003145130/http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/specialwin.php |date=3 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''master–slave dialectic''' is the common name for a famous passage of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', though the original German phrase, ''Herrschaft und Knechtschaft'', is more properly translated as '''Lordship and Bondage'''.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Duquette, [http://www.iep.utm.edu/hegelsoc/ "Hegel’s Social and Political Thought"],  ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Accessed 9 February 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely considered a key element in Hegel's [[philosophy|philosophical]] system, and has heavily influenced many subsequent philosophers.

The passage describes, in narrative form, the development of self-consciousness as such in an encounter between what are thereby (i.e., emerging only from this encounter) two distinct, [[Self-awareness|self-conscious]] beings. The essence of the [[dialectic]] is the movement or motion of recognizing, in which the two self-consciousnesses are constituted in being each recognized as self-conscious by the other. This movement, inexorably taken to its extreme, takes the form of a "struggle to the death" in which one masters the other, only to find that such lordship makes the very recognition he had sought impossible, since the bondsman, in this state, is not free to offer it.

== Context ==
"Independent and Dependent Self-Consciousness: Lordship and Bondage" is the first of two titled subsections in the "Self-Consciousness" chapter of ''Phenomenology''. It is preceded in the chapter by a discussion of "Life" and "Desire", among other things, and is followed by "Free Self-Consciousness: Stoicism, Skepticism, and the Unhappy Consciousness".

Hegel wrote this story or myth in order to explain his idea of how self-consciousness dialectically [[Aufheben|sublates]] into what he variously refers to as Absolute Knowledge, Spirit, and Science. As a work, the ''Phenomenology'' may be considered both as an independent work, apparently considered by Hegel to be an ''[[A_priori_and_a_posteriori|a priori]]'' for understanding the ''[[Science of Logic]]'', and as a part of the ''Science of Logic'', where Hegel discusses [[Universality (philosophy)|absolute knowledge]].

== Recognition ==
Crucially, for Hegel, absolute knowledge, or Spirit, cannot come to be without first a self-consciousness recognizing another self-consciousness.  Such an issue in the history of philosophy had only ever been explored by [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] and its treatment marks a watershed in [[European philosophy]].

== Hegel's myth ==
In order to explain how this works, Hegel uses a story that is in essence an abstracted, idealized history about how two people meet.  However, Hegel's idea of the development of self-consciousness from consciousness, and its sublation into a higher unity in absolute knowledge, is not the contoured brain of natural science and evolutionary biology, but a [[The Phenomenology of Spirit|phenomenological]] construct with a history; one that must have passed through a struggle for freedom before realising itself.

The abstract language used by Hegel never allows one to interpret this story in a straightforward fashion.  It can be read as self-consciousness coming to itself through a child's or adult's development, or self-consciousness coming to be in the beginning of human history (see [[wikt:Hominization|hominization]]) or as that of a society or nation realising freedom.

That the master–slave dialectic can be interpreted as an internal process occurring in one person or as an external process between two or more people is a result, in part, of the fact that Hegel asserts an "end to the antithesis of [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]] and [[Object (philosophy)|object]]". What occurs in the human mind also occurs outside of it. The objective and subjective, according to Hegel, [[Aufheben|sublate]] one another until they are unified, and the "story" takes this process through its various "moments" when the lifting up of two contradictory moments results in a higher unity.

First, the two abstract consciousnesses meet and are astounded at the realisation of the self as a foreign object. Each can choose to ignore the other, in which case no self-consciousness forms and each views the other merely as an animated object rather than an equivalent subject. Or, they become mesmerized by the mirror-like other and attempt, as they previously had done in controlling their own body, to assert their will.

According to Hegel,
:"On approaching the other it has lost its own self, since it finds itself as another being; secondly, it has thereby sublated that other, for this primitive consciousness does not regard the other as essentially real but sees its own self in the other."&lt;ref&gt;G.W.F. Hegel, Phenomenology of Spirit, translated by A.V. Miller with analysis of the text and foreword by J. N. Findlay (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1977); Paragraph 179, Pg. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reaction ===
When initially confronted with another person, the self cannot be immediately recognized :'Appearing thus immediately on the scene, they are for one another like ordinary objects, independent shapes, individuals submerged in the being [or immediacy] of Life'.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

=== Death struggle ===
A struggle to the death ensues. However, if one of the two should die, the achievement of self-consciousness fails.  Hegel refers to this failure as "abstract negation" not the negation or sublation required. This death is avoided by the agreement, communication of, or subordination to, slavery. In this struggle the Master emerges as Master because he does not fear death since he does not see his identity dependent on life, while the slave out of this fear consents to the slavery.  This experience of fear on the part of the slave is crucial, however, in a later moment of the dialectic, where it becomes the prerequisite experience for the slave's further development.

=== Enslavement and mastery ===
Truth of oneself as self-conscious is achieved only if both live; the recognition of the other gives each of them the objective truth and self-certainty required for self-consciousness. Thus, the two enter into the relation of master/slave and preserve the recognition of each other.

=== Contradiction and Resolution ===
However, this state is not a happy one and does not achieve full self-consciousness. The recognition by the slave is merely on pain of death. The master's self-consciousness is dependent on the slave for recognition and also has a mediated relation with nature: the slave works with nature and begins to shape it into products for the master.  As the slave creates more and more products with greater and greater sophistication through his own [[creativity]], he begins to see himself reflected in the products he created, he realises that the world around him was created by his own hands, thus the slave is no longer alienated from his own labour and achieves self-consciousness, while
the master on the other hand has become wholly dependent on the products created by his slave; thus the master is enslaved by the [[labor economics|labour]] of his slave.

== Conclusions ==
One interpretation of this dialectic is that neither a slave nor a master can be considered as fully self-conscious. A person who has already achieved self-consciousness could be enslaved, so self-consciousness must be considered not as an individual achievement, or an achievement of natural and genetic evolution, but as a social phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Moran, ''Hegel and the Fundamental Problems of Philosophy'', Holland: Grüner, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

As philosopher [[Robert Brandom]] explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Hegel's discussion of the dialectic of the Master and Slave is an attempt to show that asymmetric recognitive relations are metaphysically defective, that the norms they institute aren't the right kind to help us think and act with&amp;mdash;to make it possible for us to think and act. Asymmetric recognition in this way is authority without responsibility, on the side of the Master, and responsibility without authority, on the side of the Slave. And Hegel's argument is that unless authority and responsibility are commensurate and reciprocal, no actual normative statuses are instituted. This is one of his most important and certainly one of his deepest ideas, though it's not so easy to see just how the argument works."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Brandom, Interview, Summer 2008. Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdIPuERVjk0 Transcript: http://www.filosofia.it/images/download/multimedia/08_Brandom%20Interview_transcription.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Alexandre Kojève]]'s unique interpretation differs from this. For Kojève, people are born and history began with the first struggle, which ended with the first masters and slaves. A person is always either master or slave; and there are no real humans where there are no masters and slaves. History comes to an end when the difference between master and slave ends, when the master ceases to be master because there are no more slaves and the slave ceases to be a slave because there are no more masters. A synthesis takes place between master and slave: the integral [[citizen]] of the universal and homogenous [[State (polity)|state]] created by [[Napoleon]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexandre Kojève, ''Introduction à la lecture de Hegel'', France: Gallimard, 1947. Translated as ''Introduction to the Reading of Hegel'', New York: Basic Books, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The master and slave relationship influenced numerous discussions and ideas in the 20th century, especially because of its supposed connection to [[Karl Marx]]'s conception of [[class struggle]] as the motive force of social development.{{fact|date=February 2015}}.

Hegel's master–slave dialectic has been influential in the [[social sciences]], [[philosophy]], [[literary studies]], [[critical theory]], [[postcolonial studies]] and in [[psychoanalysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Julia Borossa and Caroline Rooney, "Suffering, Transience and Immortal Longings: Salomé Between Nietzsche and Freud," ''Journal of European Studies'' 33(3/4): 287-304 London, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Hegel's master–slave trope, and particularly the emphasis on recognition, has been of crucial influence on [[Martin Buber]]'s relational schema in ''[[I and Thou]]'', [[Simone de Beauvoir]]'s account of the history and dynamics of gender relations in ''[[The Second Sex]]''&lt;ref&gt; A "five-stage model" of the master-slave dialectic, inflected through de Beauvoir's classic work [http://www.rgwinther.com/CoursesTaught/HegelsMasterSlaveDialecticPhasesandFAQ.pdf can be found here]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Frantz Fanon]]'s description of the colonial relation in ''[[Black Skin, White Masks]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Frantz Fanon, ''Black Skin, White Masks,'' New York: Grove Press, 1967: 62.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Buck-Morss]]'s article ''Hegel and Haiti'' argues that the [[Haitian revolution]] influenced Hegel's writing of his slave-master dialectic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Buck-Morss |first=Susan |authorlink= Susan Buck-Morss |date= Summer 2000 |title=Hegel and Haiti  |journal=Critical Inquiry |publisher= The University of Chicago Press |volume=26  |issue=4 |pages=821–865 |jstor=1344332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{orphan|date=June 2013}}

In [[mathematics]], an '''''N''-topological space''' is a set equipped with ''N'' arbitrary topologies. If ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''τ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''τ''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; are ''N''&amp;nbsp;topologies defined on a nonempty set '''X''', then the ''N''-topological space is denoted by (''X'',''τ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''τ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''τ''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;).
For ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, the structure is simply a [[topological space]].
For ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, the structure becomes a [[bitopological space]] introduced by J. C. Kelly.&lt;ref name="J. C. Kelly"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kelly|first=J. C.|title=Bitopological spaces|journal=Proc. London Math. Soc.|year=1963|volume=13|issue=3|pages=71–89|doi=10.1112/plms/s3-13.1.71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==
Let ''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} be any finite set. Suppose ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}. Then the collection ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{''φ'',&amp;nbsp;''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''X''} will be a topology on&amp;nbsp;''X''. If ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; be ''m'' such topologies (chain topologies) defined on ''X'', then the structure (''X'', ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;) is an '''''m''-topological space'''.

{{Neuropsychology |functions}}

In [[neuropsychology]], [[linguistics]], and the [[philosophy of language]], a '''natural language''' or '''ordinary language''' is any [[language]] that has [[linguistic evolution|evolved]] naturally in humans through use and repetition without conscious planning or premeditation. Natural languages can take different forms, such as [[Vocal language|speech]] or [[Sign language|signing]]. They are distinguished from [[Constructed language|constructed]] and [[formal language]]s such as [[Programming language|those used to program computers]] or to study [[logic]].&lt;ref name="john lyons"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lyons |first=John |title=Natural Language and Universal Grammar |year=1991 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0521246965 |pages=68–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Defining natural language ==

Though the exact definition varies between scholars, natural language can broadly be defined in contrast to artificial or [[constructed language]]s (such as [[Programming language|computer programming languages]] and [[international auxiliary language]]s) and to other [[Biocommunication (science)|communication systems in nature]]. Such examples include bees' [[waggle dance]]&lt;ref name="fernandes"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fernandes |first=Keith |title=On the Significance of Speech: How Infants Discover Symbols and Structure |year=2008 |publisher=ProQuest |location=Ann Arbor, MI |isbn=978-1243524065 |pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[whale vocalization|whale song]], to which researchers have found or applied the linguistic cognates of [[dialect]] and even [[syntax]]. 

All [[variety (linguistics)|language varieties]] of [[world language]]s are natural languages, although some varieties are subject to greater degrees of published [[linguistic prescription|prescriptivism]] or [[list of language regulators|language regulation]] than others. Thus [[nonstandard dialect]]s can be viewed as a [[wild type]] in comparison with [[standard language]]s. But even an [[official language]] with a regulating academy, such as [[Standard French]] with the [[Académie française|French Academy]], is classified as a natural language (for example, in the field of [[natural language processing]]), as its prescriptive points do not make it either constructed enough to be classified as a [[constructed language]] or controlled enough to be classified as a [[controlled natural language]].

== Controlled languages ==
{{Main|Controlled natural language}}

Controlled natural languages are subsets of natural languages whose grammars and dictionaries have been restricted in order to reduce or eliminate both ambiguity and complexity (for instance, by cutting down on rarely used superlative or adverbial forms or [[irregular verbs]]). The purpose behind the development and implementation of a controlled natural language typically is to aid non-native speakers of a natural language in understanding it, or to ease computer processing of a natural language. An example of a widely used controlled natural language is [[Simplified Technical English|Simplified English]], which was originally developed for [[aerospace]] industry maintenance manuals.

== Constructed languages and international auxiliary languages ==
{{Main|Constructed language|International auxiliary language}}
Constructed [[international auxiliary language]]s such as [[Esperanto]] and [[Interlingua]] (even those that have [[native speaker]]s) are not generally considered natural languages.&lt;ref name="Gopsill, F. P. 1990"&gt;Gopsill, F. P., "A historical overview of international languages". In ''International languages: A matter for Interlingua''. Sheffield, England: British Interlingua Society, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Natural languages have been used to communicate and have evolved in a natural way, whereas Esperanto was designed by [[L.L. Zamenhof]] selecting elements from natural languages, not grown from natural fluctuations in vocabulary and syntax. Some natural languages have become naturally "standardized" by children's natural tendency to correct for illogical grammatical structures in their parents' speech, which can be seen in the development of [[pidgin]] languages into [[creole language]]s (as explained by Steven Pinker in ''[[The Language Instinct]]''), but this is not the case in many languages, including constructed languages such as Esperanto, where strict rules are in place as an attempt to consciously remove such irregularities. The possible exception to this are true native speakers of such languages.&lt;ref&gt;Proponents contend that there are 200–2000 [[native Esperanto speakers|native speakers of Esperanto]].&lt;/ref&gt; More substantive basis for this designation is that the vocabulary, grammar, and orthography of Interlingua are natural; they have been standardized and presented by a [[International Auxiliary Language Association|linguistic research body]], but they predated it and are not themselves considered a product of human invention.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Gode|Gode, Alexander]], ''[[Interlingua-English Dictionary|Interlingua-English: A dictionary of the international language]]''. New York: Storm Publishers, 1951. (Original edition)&lt;/ref&gt; Most experts, however, consider Interlingua to be naturalistic rather than natural.&lt;ref name="Gopsill, F. P. 1990"/&gt; [[Latino Sine Flexione]], a second naturalistic auxiliary language, is also naturalistic in content but is no longer widely spoken.&lt;ref&gt;Gopsill, F. P., "Naturalistic international languages". In ''International languages: A matter for Interlingua''. Sheffield, England: British Interlingua Society, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Natural language training''' is a set of procedures used by behavior analysts. These procedures are used to mirror the natural areas of language use for children.&lt;ref name="Hart80"&gt;Hart, B. &amp; Risely, T.R. (1980). "''In vivo'' language intervention: Unanticipated general effects." ''Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis'', 13, 407–432.&lt;/ref&gt; Behavior analysts language training procedures run along a continuum from highly restrictive such as discrete trial training to very nonrestrictive conversationally-based strategies. Natural language falls in the middle of these procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, P. (2004): "Naturalistic Language Teaching Procedures for Children at Risk for Language Delays." ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 5 (4), 404–420 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Natural language training, sometimes referred to as milieu (person's social environment.) language training&lt;ref&gt;Hart, B. &amp; Warren, S. (1978). A milieu approach to teaching language. In R. Schiefelbusch, (Ed.), ''Language Intervention Strategies''. Baltimore University Park Press.&lt;/ref&gt; emerged from generalization research by [[Donald M. Baer|Donald Baer]].&lt;ref&gt;Warren, S.F., Baxter, D.K., Anderson, S.R., Marshall, A.M., &amp; Baer, D.M. (1981). These procedures use free operant principles as opposed to discrete trials. Generalization and maintenance of question-asking by severely retarded individuals. ''Journal of the Association for the Severely Handicapped'', 6, 15–22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Onsnes03"&gt;Osnes, P. &amp; Lieblein. (2003) "An Explicit Technology of Generalization." ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 3 (4),  364–377 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; The focus on these procedures was to use concepts closer to the natural environment to reduce prompt dependency and promote generalization.&lt;ref name="Onsnes03"/&gt; The initial procedure was the incidental teaching procedure.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, B. &amp; Risely, T.R. (1975) "Incidental teaching of language in preschool." ''Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis'', 8, 411–420.&lt;/ref&gt;

The natural language training approach is often contrasted with discrete trial approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Kates-McElrath, K. &amp; Axelrod, S. (2006). "Behavioral Intervention for Autism: A Distinction Between Two Behavior Analytic Approaches." ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 7 (2), Page 242–254. [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; In discrete trial program there is a clear trial window and only the first response is scored. If incorrect no reward is delivered and the trainer moves to the next trial. In the milieu language training program (natural language program), the trainer uses a least-to-most response strategy and waits for the correct response to be produced. Research exists showing that over 90% of the studies report good generalization for natural language training procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, P. (2009). "Promoting Generalization and Maintenance of Skills Learned via Natural Language Teaching." ''J-SPL-ABA'', 4, 90–131. [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Currently, these procedures are used to teach children with [[autism]], [[language delay]]s, and [[developmental disabilities]]. Drawing on a behavior analytic model of child development (see [[Behavior analysis of child development]]) the goal of these procedures is to remediate developmental deficits. Because of their focus on generalization, natural language programs are often recommended when discrete trial programs run into problems.&lt;ref&gt;Lillian V. Pelios &amp; Amy Sucharzewski (2003): "Teaching Receptive Language To Children with Autism: A Selective Overview." ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 4 (4), Pg. 378–385 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferraioli, S., Hughes, C. and Smith, T. (2005). "A Model for Problem Solving in Discrete Trial Training for Children With Autism." ''JEIBI'',  2 (4), 224–235. [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; These procedures are also recommended as part of building comprehensive programs for children with autism.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, M.J. (2005): "Comprehensive ABA Programs: Integrating And Evaluating The Implementation Of Varied Instructional Approaches." ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 6 (4), 249–265. [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
Natural language training procedures use a least to most prompt strategy.&lt;ref name="Hart80"/&gt; This strategy starts with designing/engineering the environment to increase the chances for language to occur, followed by incidental teaching, time delay, [[mand (psychology)|mand]] modeling, and modeling the response. Each intervention is used in a successive fashion if the previous intervention does not produce results.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, P. (2004). "Naturalistic Language Teaching Procedures for Children at Risk for Language Delays." ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 5 (4), 404–445. [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24337">'''Neural adaptation''' or '''sensory adaptation''' is a change over time in the responsiveness of the [[sensory system]] to a constant [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]]. It is usually [[perception|experienced]] as a change in the stimulus. For example, if a hand is rested on a table, the table's surface is immediately felt on the skin. After a little while though this is no longer felt. The sensory neurons that initially respond are no longer stimulated to respond; this is an example of neural adaptation.

All sensory and neural systems have a form of adaptation to constantly detect changes in the environment. Neural receptor cells that process and receive stimulation go through constant changes for mammals and other living organisms to sense vital changes in their environment. Some key players in several neural systems include Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;ions (see [[Calcium in biology]]) that send negative feedback in second messenger pathways that allow the neural receptor cells to close or open channels in response to the changes of ion flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=16027364|pmc=1180786|year=2005|author1=Dougherty|first1=D. P.|title=Computational model of the cAMP-mediated sensory response and calcium-dependent adaptation in vertebrate olfactory receptor neurons|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=102|issue=30|pages=10415–20|last2=Wright|first2=G. A.|last3=Yew|first3=A. C.|doi=10.1073/pnas.0504099102}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also mechanoreception systems that use calcium inflow to physically affect certain proteins and move them to close or open channels.

Functionally, it is highly possible that adaptation may enhance the limited response range of neurons to encode sensory signals with much larger dynamic ranges by shifting the range of stimulus amplitudes.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=11988174|year=2002|author1=Chung|first1=S|title=Short-term depression at thalamocortical synapses contributes to rapid adaptation of cortical sensory responses in vivo|journal=Neuron|volume=34|issue=3|pages=437–46|last2=Li|first2=X|last3=Nelson|first3=S. B.|doi=10.1016/s0896-6273(02)00659-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in neural adaptation there is a sense of returning to baseline from a stimulated response.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=3501690|year=1987|author1=Matikainen|first1=M|title=Endoscopic flushing electrocoagulation for upper gastrointestinal bleeding--an alternative to surgery|journal=Annales chirurgiae et gynaecologiae|volume=76|issue=4|pages=212–4|last2=Airo|first2=I}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent work suggests that these baseline states are actually determined by long-term adaptation to the environment.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Varying rates or speed of adaptation is an important indicator for tracking different rates of change in the environment or the organism itself.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Current research shows that although adaptation occurs at multiple stages of each sensory pathway, it is often stronger and more stimulus specific at “cortical” level rather than “subcortical stages.” &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In short, neural adaptation is thought to happen at a more central level at the [[Cerebral Cortex|cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Webster|first1=Michael|title=Evolving concepts of sensory adaptation|journal=F1000 Biology Reports|date=1 November 2012|volume=4|pages=21|doi=10.3410/B4-21|pmid=23189092|pmc=3501690}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fast and slow adaptation ==
There is fast adaptation and slow adaptation. Fast adaptation occurs immediately after a stimulus is presented i.e., within hundreds of milliseconds. Slow adaptive processes can take minutes, hours or even days. The two classes of neural adaptation may rely on very different physiological mechanisms.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The time scale over which adaptation builds up and recovers depends on the time course of stimulation.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Brief stimulation produces adaptation which occurs and recovers while more prolonged stimulation can produce slower and more lasting forms of adaptation.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Also, repeated sensory stimulation appears to temporarily decrease the gain of thalamocortical synaptic transmission. Adaptation of cortical responses was stronger and recovered more slowly.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== History ==
In the late 1800s, [[Hermann Helmholtz]], a German physician and physicist, extensively researched conscious sensations and different types of perception . He defined sensations as the "raw elements" of conscious experience that required no learning, and perceptions as the meaningful interpretations derived from the senses. He studied the physical properties of the eye and vision, as well as acoustic sensation. In one of his classic experiments regarding how space perception could be altered by experience, participants wore glasses that distorted the [[visual field]] by several degrees to the right. Participants were asked to look at an object, close their eyes, and try to reach out and touch it. At first, the subjects reached for the object too far to the left, but after a few trials were able to correct themselves.

Helmholtz theorized that perceptual adaptation might result from a process he referred to as [[unconscious inference]], where the mind unconsciously adopts certain rules in order to make sense of what is perceived of the world. An example of this phenomenon is when a ball appears to be getting smaller and smaller, the mind will then infer that the ball is moving away from them.

In the 1890s, psychologist [[George M. Stratton]] conducted experiments in which he tested the theory of perceptual adaptation. In one experiment, he wore a reversing glasses for 21½ hours over three days. After removing the glasses, "normal vision was restored instantaneously and without any disturbance in the natural appearance or position of objects."&lt;ref name="Stratton1896"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1896|title=Some preliminary experiments on vision without inversion of the retinal image|url=http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~nava/courses/psych_and_brain/pdfs/Stratton_1896.pdf|journal=Psychological Review|volume=3|issue=6|pages=611–7|doi=10.1037/h0072918|last1=Stratton|first1=George M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stratton glasses experiment (modern version).jpg|thumb|right|Modern version of inverting mirrors with harness.]]

On a later experiment, Stratton wore the glasses for eight whole days. By day four, the images seen through the instrument were still upside down. However, on day five, images appeared upright until he concentrated on them; then they became inverted again. By having to concentrate on his vision to turn it upside down again, especially when he knew images were hitting his [[retina]]s in the opposite orientation as normal, Stratton deduced his brain had adapted to the changes in vision.

Stratton also conducted experiments where he wore glasses that altered his [[visual field]] by 45°. His brain was able to adapt to the change and perceive the world as normal. Also, the field can be altered making the subject see the world upside down. But, as the brain adjusts to the change, the world appears "normal."&lt;ref name=Myers2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cullari1997&gt;{{cite web |last=Cullari |first=Salvatore |title=Re: Upside Down Glasses?  |publisher= [[MadSci Network]] |date=21 Mar 1997 |url=http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/mar97/858984531.Ns.r.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some extreme experiments, psychologists have tested to see if a pilot can fly a plane with altered vision. All of the pilots that were fitted with the goggles that altered their vision were able to safely navigate the aircraft with ease.&lt;ref name=Myers2008&gt;{{cite book |last=Myers |first=David G. |title=Exploring Psychology in Modules |edition=7th |location=New York |publisher=Worth Publishers |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4292-0589-4}}{{Page needed|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Visual ==
Adaptation is considered to be the cause of perceptual phenomena like [[afterimage]]s and the motion aftereffect. In the absence of fixational eye movements, visual perception may fade out or disappear due to neural adaptation. (See [[Adaptation (eye)]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martinez-Conde|first1=S|last2=Macknik|first2=SL|last3=Hubel|first3=DH|title=The role of fixational eye movements in visual perception.|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|date=March 2004|volume=5|issue=3|pages=229–40|pmid=14976522|url=http://neuralcorrelate.com/martinez-conde_et_al_nrn_2004.pdf|doi=10.1038/nrn1348|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716213332/http://neuralcorrelate.com/martinez-conde_et_al_nrn_2004.pdf|archivedate=2006-07-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When an observer's visual stream adapts to a single direction of real motion, imagined motion can be perceived at various speeds. If the imagined motion is in the same direction as that experienced during adaptation, imagined speed is slowed; when imagined motion is in the opposite direction, its speed is increased; when adaptation and imagined motions are orthogonal, imagined speed is unaffected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gilden|first1=D|last2=Blake|first2=R|last3=Hurst|first3=G|title=Neural adaptation of imaginary visual motion.|journal=Cognitive Psychology|date=February 1995|volume=28|issue=1|pages=1–16|doi=10.1006/cogp.1995.1001|pmid=7895467}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies using magnetoencephalography (MEG) have demonstrated that subjects exposed to a repeated visual stimulus at brief intervals become attenuated to the stimulus in comparison to the initial stimulus. The results revealed that visual responses to the repeated compared with novel stimulus showed a significant reduction in both activation strength and peak latency but not in the duration of neural processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Noguchi|first1=Y|last2=Inui|first2=K|last3=Kakigi|first3=R|title=Temporal dynamics of neural adaptation effect in the human visual ventral stream.|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|date=14 July 2004|volume=24|issue=28|pages=6283–90|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0655-04.2004|pmid=15254083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although motion and images are extremely important regarding adaptation, the most important adaptation is adjusting to brightness levels. On entering a dark room or a very brightly lit room it takes a little while to adjust to the different levels. Adjusting to brightness levels allows mammals to detect changes in their surrounding. This is called [[Adaptation (eye)#Dark adaptation|dark adaptation]].

== Auditory ==
Auditory adaptation, as perceptual adaptation with other senses, is the process by which individuals adapt to sounds and noises. As research has shown, as time progresses, individuals tend to adapt to sounds and tend to distinguish them less frequently after a while. Sensory adaptation tends to blend sounds into one, variable sound, rather than having several separate sounds as a series. Moreover, after repeated perception, individuals tend to adapt to sounds to the point where they no longer consciously perceive it, or rather, "block it out". An individual that lives close to the train tracks, will eventually stop noticing the sounds of passing trains. Similarly, individuals living in larger cities no longer notice traffic sounds after a while. Moving to a completely different area, such as a quiet countryside, that individual would then be aware of the silence, crickets, etc.&lt;ref name="Anstis1985"&gt;{{cite web |last=Anstis |first=Stuart |title=Re: Adaptation to auditory streaming of frequency-modulated tones  |publisher= [[PsycNET]] |date=3 June 1985 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/xhp/11/3/257/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanoreception of sound requires a specific set of receptor cells called [[hair cell]]s that allow for gradient signals to pass onto spatial ganglia where the signal will be sent to the brain to be processed. Since this is mechanoreception, different from chemoreception, adaptation of sound from surroundings highly depends on the physical movement of opening and closing of cation channels on the hair cell stereocilia. Mechanoelectric transduction (MET) channels, located at the tops of stereocilia, are poised to detect tension induced by hair bundle deflection. Hair bundle deflection generates a force by pulling on [[tip link]] proteins connecting adjacent stereocilia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=26961949|pmc=4783497|year=2016|author1=Peng|first1=A. W.|title=Adaptation Independent Modulation of Auditory Hair Cell Mechanotransduction Channel Open Probability Implicates a Role for the Lipid Bilayer|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|volume=36|issue=10|pages=2945–56|last2=Gnanasambandam|first2=R|last3=Sachs|first3=F|last4=Ricci|first4=A. J.|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3011-15.2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Olfactory ==
{{Main|Olfactory fatigue}}Perceptual adaptation is a phenomenon that occurs for all of the senses, including smell and touch. An individual can adapt to a certain smell with time. Smokers, or individuals living with smokers, tend to stop noticing the smell of cigarettes after some time, whereas people not exposed to smoke on a regular basis will notice the smell instantly. The same phenomenon can be observed with other types of smell, such as perfume, flowers, etc. The human brain can distinguish smells that are unfamiliar to the individual, while adapting to those it is used to and no longer require to be consciously recognized.

Olfactory neurons utilize a feedback system from the levels of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;ions to activate its adaptation to prolonged smells. Due to the fact that the olfactory signal transduction uses a second messenger transduction system, the [[Olfactory fatigue#mechanism|mechanism]] of adaptation includes several factors that mostly include CaMK or [[calmodulin]] bound to Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;ions.

== Somatosensory ==
This phenomenon also applies to the sense of touch. An unfamiliar piece of clothing that was just put on will be noticed instantly; however, once it has been worn for a while, the mind will adapt to its texture and ignore the stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Re: Sensory Adaptation: Definition, Examples &amp; Quiz  |publisher= [[Education Portal]] |url=http://education-portal.com/academy/lesson/sensory-adaptation-definition-examples-quiz.html#lesson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pain ===
While large mechanosensory neurons such as type I/group Aß display adaptation, smaller type IV/group C nociceptive neurons do not. As a result, pain does not usually subside rapidly but persists for long periods of time; in contrast, other sensory information is quickly adapted to, if surroundings remain constant.

=== Weight training ===
Studies have shown that there is neural adaptation after as little as one weight training session. Strength gains are experienced by subjects without any increased muscle size. Muscle surface recordings using [[electromyography#Surface EMG versus intramuscular|electromyographic (SEMG)]] techniques have found that early strength gains throughout training are associated with increased amplitude in SEMG activity. These findings along with various other theories explain increases in strength without increases in muscle mass. Other theories for increases in strength relating to neural adaptation include: [[anatomical terms of muscle#Agonists and antagonists|agonist-antagonist]] muscle decreased co-activation, [[motor unit]] synchronization, and motor unit increased [[motor unit recruitment#Rate coding of muscle force|firing rates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Kamen|first2=G|last3=Frost|first3=G|date=2006|title=Neural adaptations to resistive exercise: mechanisms and recommendations for training practices.|journal=Sports Medicine|volume=36|issue=2|pages=133–49|doi=10.2165/00007256-200636020-00004|pmid=16464122|last1=Gabriel|first1=DA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neural adaptations contribute to changes in V-waves and [[Hoffmann's reflex]]. H-reflex can be used to assess the excitability of spinal [[alpha motor neuron|α-motoneurons]], whereas V-wave measures the magnitude of motor output from α-motoneurons. Studies showed that after a 14-week resistance training regime, subjects expressed V-wave amplitude increases of ~50% and H-reflex amplitude increases of ~20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Simonsen|first2=EB|last3=Andersen|first3=JL|last4=Magnusson|first4=P|last5=Dyhre-Poulsen|first5=P|date=June 2002|title=Neural adaptation to resistance training: changes in evoked V-wave and H-reflex responses.|journal=Journal of Applied Physiology|volume=92|issue=6|pages=2309–18|doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.01185.2001|pmid=12015341|last1=Aagaard|first1=P}}&lt;/ref&gt; This showed that neural adaptation accounts for changes to functional properties of the spinal cord circuitry in humans without affecting organization of the [[motor cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Riek|first2=S|last3=Carson|first3=RG|date=15 October 2002|title=The sites of neural adaptation induced by resistance training in humans.|journal=The Journal of Physiology|volume=544|issue=Pt 2|pages=641–52|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.2002.024463|pmc=2290590|pmid=12381833|last1=Carroll|first1=TJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Habituation vs adaptation ==
The terms neural adaptation and [[habituation]] are often confused for one another. Habituation is a behavioral phenomenon while neural adaptation is a physiological phenomenon, although the two are not entirely separate. During habituation, one has some conscious control over whether one notices something to which one is becoming habituated. However, when it comes to neural adaptation, one has no conscious control over it. For example, if one has adapted to something (like an odor or perfume), one can not consciously force himself to smell that thing. Neural adaptation is tied very closely to stimulus intensity; as the intensity of a light increases, one's senses will adapt more strongly to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sternberg|first=Robert|title=Cognitive psychology|year=2009|publisher=Cengage Learning/Wadsworth|location=Australia|isbn=978-0-495-50629-4|pages=137–138|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, habituation can vary depending on the stimulus. With a weak stimulus habituation can occur almost immediately but with a strong stimulus the animal may not habituate at all&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rakitin|first1=A|last2=Tomsic|first2=D|last3=Maldonado|first3=H|title=Habituation and sensitization to an electrical shock in the crab Chasmagnathus. Effect of background illumination.|journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior|date=September 1991|volume=50|issue=3|pages=477–87|pmid=1800998|doi=10.1016/0031-9384(91)90533-t}}&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. a cool breeze versus a fire alarm. Habituation also has a set of characteristics that must be met to be termed a habituation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=RF|last2=Spencer|first2=WA|title=Habituation: a model phenomenon for the study of neuronal substrates of behavior.|journal=Psychological Review|date=January 1966|volume=73|issue=1|pages=16–43|pmid=5324565|url=http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~david/courses/perceptionGrad/Readings/ThompsonSpencer-PsychRev1966.pdf|doi=10.1037/h0022681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rhythmic behaviors ==

=== Short-term adaptations ===
Short term neural adaptations occur in the body during [[rhythmic]] activities. One of the most common activities when these neural adaptations are constantly happening is walking.&lt;ref name="pmid10845109"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pearson|first1=KG|title=Neural adaptation in the generation of rhythmic behavior.|journal=Annual Review of Physiology|date=2000|volume=62|pages=723–53|doi=10.1146/annurev.physiol.62.1.723|pmid=10845109}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a person walks, the body constantly gathers information about the environment and the surroundings of the feet, and slightly adjusts the muscles in use according to the [[terrain]]. For example, walking uphill requires different muscles than walking on flat pavement. When the brain recognizes that the body is walking uphill, it makes neural adaptations that send more activity to muscles required for uphill walking.
The rate of neural adaptation is affected by the area of the brain and by the similarity between sizes and shapes of previous stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verhoef|first1=BE|last2=Kayaert|first2=G|last3=Franko|first3=E|last4=Vangeneugden|first4=J|last5=Vogels|first5=R|title=Stimulus similarity-contingent neural adaptation can be time and cortical area dependent.|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|date=15 October 2008|volume=28|issue=42|pages=10631–40|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3333-08.2008|pmid=18923039}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adaptations in the [[inferior temporal gyrus]] are very dependent on previous stimuli being of similar size, and somewhat dependent on previous stimuli being of a similar shape. Adaptations in the [[Prefrontal Cortex]] are less dependent on previous stimuli being of similar size and shape.

=== Long-term adaptations ===
Some rhythmic movements, such as respiratory movements, are essential for survival. Because these movements must be used over the course of the entire lifetime, it is important for them to function optimally. Neural adaptation has been observed in these movements in response to training or altered external conditions.&lt;ref name="pmid10845109" /&gt; Animals have been shown to have reduced breathing rates in response to better fitness levels. Since breathing rates were not conscious changes made by the animal, it is presumed that neural adaptations occur for the body to maintain a slower breathing rate.

== Transcranial magnetic stimulation ==
[[Transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS) is an important technique in modern [[cognitive neuropsychology]] that is used to investigate the perceptual and behavioral effects of temporary interference of neural processing. Studies have shown that when a subject’s visual cortex is disrupted by TMS, the subject views colorless flashes of light, or [[phosphenes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silvanto|first=Juha|author2=Muggleton, Neil G. |author3=Cowey, Alan |author4=Walsh, Vincent |title=Neural adaptation reveals state-dependent effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation|journal=Eur. J. Neurosci.|year=2007|volume=25|issue=6|pages=1874–1881|doi=10.1111/j.1460-9568.2007.05440.x|pmid=17408427}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a subjects’ vision was subjected to the constant stimulus of a single color, neural adaptations occurred that made the subjects used to the color. Once this adaptation had occurred, TMS was used to disrupt the subjects’ visual cortex again, and the flashes of light viewed by the subject were the same color as the constant stimulus before the disruption.

== Drug induced ==
Neural adaptation can occur for other than natural means. Antidepressant drugs, such as those that cause down regulation of β-[[adrenergic receptors]], can cause rapid neural adaptations in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duncan|first1=GE|last2=Paul|first2=IA|last3=Harden|first3=TK|last4=Mueller|first4=RA|last5=Stumpf|first5=WE|last6=Breese|first6=GR|title=Rapid down regulation of beta adrenergic receptors by combining antidepressant drugs with forced swim: a model of antidepressant-induced neural adaptation.|journal=The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics|date=August 1985|volume=234|issue=2|pages=402–8|pmid=2991500}}&lt;/ref&gt; By creating a quick adaptation in the regulation of these receptors, it is possible for drugs to reduce the effects of stress on those taking the medication.

== Post-injury ==
Studies in children with early childhood brain injuries have shown that neural adaptations slowly occur after the injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stiles|first1=J|last2=Reilly|first2=J|last3=Paul|first3=B|last4=Moses|first4=P|title=Cognitive development following early brain injury: evidence for neural adaptation.|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=March 2005|volume=9|issue=3|pages=136–43|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2005.01.002|pmid=15737822}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children with early injuries to the [[linguistics]], spatial cognition and [[affective]] development areas of the brain showed deficits in those areas as compared to those without injury. Due to neural adaptations, however, by early school-age, considerable development to those areas was observed.

'''Overexcitability''' is a term introduced to current psychology by [[Kazimierz Dąbrowski|Kazimirz Dabrowski]] as part of his [[Positive disintegration|theory of positive disintegration]] (TPD). Overexcitability is the translation of a Polish word 'nadpobudliwosc', which means 'superstimulatability' in English.

In his book ''Positive Disintegration'',&lt;ref&gt;Dabrowski, Kazimierz M.D. Positive Disintegration. J.&amp; A. Churchill Ltd. 1964&lt;/ref&gt; Dabrowski uses the terms "hyperexcitability", "increased excitability" "overexcitability" and just "excitability". He uses these terms interchangeably with nervousness.

Dabrowski introduces these terms to describe a heightened physiological experience of stimuli resulting from increased neuronal sensitivities. He describes those who have hyperexcitability as showing "strength and perseveration of reactions incommensurate to their stimuli." Piechowski&lt;ref&gt;Michael Piechowski was a psychologist who did a lot of research using the theories of Dabrowski&lt;/ref&gt; noted that Dabrowski used the term psychic overexcitability to "underline the enhancement and intensification of mental activity much beyond the ordinary".&lt;ref&gt;(p287, p98)&lt;/ref&gt; Also, unlike some other theories of development such as [[Erikson]]'s [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|stages of psychosocial development]], it is not assumed that even a majority of people progress through all levels, which are not tied to ages.

== Five forms ==
There are five forms of overexcitability.  These five forms are psychomotor, sensual, emotional, imaginational and intellectual.

'''Psychomotor''': OE is a heightened excitability of the neuromuscular system. This manifests itself in a capacity for being active and energetic, a love of movement, a surplus of energy and an actual need for physical action.

'''Sensual''': OE is an intensified experience of any type of sensual pleasure or displeasure emanating from one of the five senses, i.e. sight, [[olfaction|smell]], [[touch]], [[taste]], and [[hearing]]. It manifests as an increased appreciation of aesthetic pleasure such as [[music]], [[language]], and [[art]], and delight from tastes, smells, textures, sounds, and sights. Conversely, we see extreme pain and disgust when exposed to sensations perceived as unpleasant.

'''Intellectual''': OE manifests itself as an extreme desire to seek understanding and truth, to gain [[knowledge]], and to analyse and categorise information.  Those high in Intellectual OE are commonly seen as intellectually gifted and have incredibly active minds. They are intensely [[Curiosity|curious]], avid [[Reading (process)|readers]] and keen observers. They frequently love thinking purely for the sake of thinking.

'''Imaginational''': OE manifests as an intensified play of the imagination causing rich association of images, [[invention]], fantasy, use of image and [[metaphor]] and elaborate dreams and visions. Often children high in Imaginational OE do not differentiate between truth and fiction, or are absorbed in their own private world with imaginary companions and dramatizations. 

'''Emotional''': OE is characterised by heightened, intense [[feeling]]s, extreme experience of complex emotions, identification with others' feelings to the point of actual experience and strong sentimental expression. Other indications include physical response to emotional stimuli such as stomachaches when nervous and obsessive concern with death and depression. Emotionally overexcitable people have a strong capacity for deep relationships; they show strong emotional attachments to people, places, and things. They are empathetic, compassionate and extremely sensitive.

According to Dabrowski, a person who manifests any given form of overexcitability and especially one who manifests several forms of overexcitability, sees reality in a different, stronger and more multisided manner.&lt;ref&gt;(Dabrowski, 1972, p7)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Giftedness ==
A small amount of definitive research has led to the belief that intensity, sensitivity and overexcitability are primary characteristics of the [http://sengifted.org/overexcitability-and-the-gifted/ highly gifted.] [[Positive disintegration|The association between OE and giftedness]] appears to be borne out in the research.&lt;ref&gt;(Lysy and Piechowski 1983; Piechowski 1986; Piechowski and Miller 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that at the least OE is a marker of potential for giftedness/creativity. Dąbrowski's basic message is that the gifted will disproportionately display this process of positive disintegration and personality growth. The term "overexcitability" was popularized in the gifted education community by scholars such as Sal Mendaglio, who edited Dabrowski's ''Theory of Positive Disintegration'' and Susan Daniels and Michael M. Piechowski, who edited ''Living with Intensity''.

# the right to use the good
# the right to earn income from the good
# the right to transfer the good to others
# the right to enforce property rights

In economics, property is usually considered to be ownership ([[Property income|rights to the proceeds generated by the property]]) and control over a resource or good. Many economists effectively argue that property rights need to be fixed and need to portray the relationships among other parties in order to be more effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecpo.12021/full|title=Private Property Rights, Investment Patterns, and Asset Structure|first=Zhiyong|last=An|date=1 November 2013|publisher=|journal=Econ Polit|volume=25|issue=3|pages=481–495|via=Wiley Online Library|doi=10.1111/ecpo.12021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regimes ==
Property rights to a good must be defined, their use must be monitored, and possession of rights must be enforced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Community-Based Natural Resource Management in Southern Africa: An Introduction|journal=AuthorHouse|date= 2013|first=K. et al.|last=Mulale}}&lt;/ref&gt;The costs of defining, monitoring, and enforcing property rights are termed [[transaction costs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Measurement Costs and the Organization of Markets|journal=Journal of Law and Economics|date= April 1982|first=Yoram|last=Barzel|volume=25|issue=1|pages=27–48|id= |doi=10.1086/467005|issn=0022-2186|jstor=725223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Douglas Allen, |title=What are Transaction Costs? (Research in Law and Economics) |publisher=Jai Pr |location= |year=1991 |isbn=0-7623-1115-0 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the level of transaction costs, various forms of property rights institutions will develop. Each institutional form can be described by the distribution of rights.

The following list is ordered from no property rights defined to all property rights being held by individuals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Daniel W. Bromley, |title=Environment and Economy: Property Rights and Public Policy |publisher=Blackwell Pub |location=Cambridge, MA |year= 1991|isbn=1-55786-087-4 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Open-access property (''[[res nullius]]'') is not 'owned' by anyone. It is non-excludable (no one can exclude anyone else from using it) but may be [[rivalry (economics)|rival]] (one person's use of it reduces the quantity available to other users). Open-access property is not managed by anyone, and access to it is not controlled. There is no constraint on anyone using open-access property (excluding people is either impossible or prohibitively costly). Examples of open-access property are the upper atmosphere (navigable airspace) or ocean fisheries (navigable waterways).

{{quote|text=Open-access property may exist because ownership has never been established, granted, by laws within a particular country, or because no effective controls are in place, or feasible, i.e., the cost of exclusion outweighs the benefits. The government can sometimes effectively convert open access property into private, common or public property through the land grant process, by legislating to define public/private rights previously not granted.|sign=Kevin Guerin|source=&lt;ref name="NZ"&gt;Guerin, K. (2003). ''Property Rights and Environmental Policy: A New Zealand Perspective''. Wellington, New Zealand: NZ Treasury&lt;/ref&gt;}}
* [[Public property]] (also known as [[state property]]) is property that is owned by all, but its access and use are controlled by the state or community. An example is a national park or a state-owned enterprise.&lt;ref name="NZ"/&gt;
* [[Common property]] or collective property is property that is owned by a group of individuals. Access, use, and exclusion are controlled by the joint owners. True commons can break down, but, unlike open-access property, common property owners have greater ability to manage conflicts through shared benefits and enforcement.&lt;ref name="NZ" /&gt;
* [[Private property]] is both excludable and rival. Private property access, use, exclusion and management are controlled by the private owner or a group of legal owners.

== The environment ==
Implicit or explicit property rights can be created by regulating the environment, either through prescriptive [[Command and control (government)|command and control]] approaches (e.g. limits on input/output/discharge quantities, specified processes/equipment, audits) or by [[market-based instruments]] (e.g. taxes, transferable permits or quotas),&lt;ref name="NZ" /&gt; and more recently through cooperative, self-regulatory, post-regulatory and reflexive law approaches.&lt;ref&gt;See literature on post-regulatory approaches and reflexive law, especially literature from Gunther Teubner. See also the example of the 'conservation property right'&lt;/ref&gt; See the [[Conservation Property Right]]

It has been proposed by [[Ronald Coase]] that clearly defining and assigning property rights would resolve environmental problems by internalizing externalities and relying on incentives of private owners to conserve resources for the future.  At common law nuisance and tort law allows adjacent property holders to seek compensation when individual actions diminish the air and water quality for adjacent landowners.
Critics of this view argue that this assumes that it is possible to internalize all environmental benefits, that owners will have perfect information, that scale economies are manageable, transaction costs are bearable, and that legal frameworks operate efficiently.&lt;ref name="NZ" /&gt;

== Literature ==
In 2013 researchers&lt;ref&gt;Mike Denison and Robyn Klingler-Vidra, October 2012, Annotated Bibliography for Rapid Review on Property Rights, Economics and Private Sector Professional Evidence and Applied Knowledge Services (EPS PEAKS)https://partnerplatform.org/?tcafmd80&lt;/ref&gt; produced an annotated bibliography on the property rights literature concerned with two principal outcomes: (a) reduction in investors risk and increase in incentives to invest, and (b) improvements in household welfare; the researchers explored the channels through which property rights affect growth and household welfare in developing countries. They found that better protection of property rights can affect several development outcomes, including better management of natural resources.

Despite the overwhelming evidence on the economic relevance of property rights however, only recently economists have begun to study their determinants by looking at the trade-off between the dispersed coercive power in a state of anarchy and the predation by a central authority. To illustrate, incomplete property rights allow agents with valuation lower than that of the original owners of economic value to inefficiently expropriate them distorting in this way their investment and effort exertion decisions. When instead, the state is entrusted the power to protect property, it might directly expropriate private parties if not sufficiently constrained by an efficient political process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Development Economics|last=Besley, Timothy|first=and Maitreesh Ghatak|publisher=Elsevier|year=2010|isbn=|location=Amsterdam|pages=4525–4595}}&lt;/ref&gt; The necessity of strong protection of property for efficiency has been however criticized by a vast legal scholarship, originated from the seminal contribution by [[Guido Calabresi]] and [[Douglas Melamed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Calabresi, Guido|first=and Melamed, A. Douglas|date=1972|title=Property Rules, Liability Rules and Inalienability: One View of the Cathedral|url=|journal=Harvard Law Review |volume=85 |pages=1089–1128|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors argue that in the face of transaction costs sufficiently sizeable to prevent consensual trade, legalized private expropriation in the form of, for instance, liability rules can be welfare-increasing. [[Carmine Guerriero]] blends these two different strands of literature by linking property rights protection, transaction costs, and preference heterogeneity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guerriero|first=Carmine|date=2016|title=Endogenous Property Rights|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.1086/686985|journal=Journal of Law and Economics|volume=59 |issue=2|doi=10.1086/686985|pmid=|access-date=|pages=313–358}}&lt;/ref&gt; To elaborate, when property is fully protected, some agents with valuation higher than that of the original owners will be unable to legally acquire value because of sizable transaction costs. When the protection of property is weak instead, low-valuation potential buyers inefficiently expropriate original owners. Hence, a rise in the heterogeneity of the potential buyers' valuations makes inefficient expropriation by low-valuation potential buyers be more important from a social welfare point of view than inefficient exclusion from trade and so induces stronger property rights.  Crucially, this prediction survives even after considering production and investment activities and it is consistent with a novel dataset on the rules on the acquisition of ownership through adverse possession and on the use of government takings to transfer real property from a private party to another private party prevailing in 126 jurisdictions. These data measure “horizontal property rights” and thus the extent of protection of property from “direct and indirect private takings,” which are ubiquitous forms of expropriation that occur daily within the rule of law and are thus different from predation by the state and the elites, which is much less common but has been the focus of the economics literature. To capture preference diversity, the author uses the contemporary genetic diversity, which is a primitive metric of the genealogical distance between populations with a common ancestor and so of the differences in characteristics transmitted across generations, such as preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History and Geography of Human Genes|last=Cavalli-Sforza, Luca L.|first=Paolo Menozzi, and Alberto Piazza|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1994|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regression analysis reveals that the protection of the original owners' property rights is the strongest where contemporary genetic diversity is the largest. Evidence from several different identification strategies suggests that this relationship is indeed causal.

== Property rights approach to the theory of the firm ==
The property rights approach to the theory of the firm based on the [[Incomplete contracts|incomplete contracting]] paradigm was developed by [[Sanford J. Grossman|Sanford Grossman]], [[Oliver Hart (economist)|Oliver Hart]], and [[John Hardman Moore|John Moore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Costs and Benefits of Ownership: A Theory of Vertical and Lateral Integration|url = http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/261404|journal = Journal of Political Economy|date = 1986|issn = 0022-3808|pages = 691–719|volume = 94|issue = 4|doi = 10.1086/261404|first = Sanford J.|last = Grossman|first2 = Oliver D.|last2 = Hart}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Property Rights and the Nature of the Firm|url = http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/261729|journal = Journal of Political Economy|date = 1990|issn = 0022-3808|pages = 1119–1158|volume = 98|issue = 6|doi = 10.1086/261729|first = Oliver|last = Hart|first2 = John|last2 = Moore}}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors argue that in the real world, contracts are incomplete and hence it is impossible to contractually specify what decisions will have to be taken in any conceivable state of the world. There will be renegotiations in the future, so parties have insufficient investment incentives (since they will only get a fraction of the investment's return in future negotiations); i.e., there is a [[hold-up problem]]. Hence, property rights matter, because they determine who has control over future decisions if no agreement will be reached. In other words, property rights determine the parties' future bargaining positions (while their bargaining powers, i.e. their fractions of the renegotiation surplus, are independent of the property rights allocation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Bargaining position, bargaining power, and the property rights approach|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016517651300030X|journal = Economics Letters|date = 2013|pages = 28–31|volume = 119|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.econlet.2013.01.011|first = Patrick W.|last = Schmitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; The property rights approach to the theory of the firm can thus explain pros and cons of integration in the context of private firms. Yet, it has also been applied in various other frameworks such as public good provision and privatization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Proper Scope of Government: Theory and an Application to Prisons|url = http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/112/4/1127|journal = The Quarterly Journal of Economics|date = 1997|issn = 0033-5533|pages = 1127–1161|volume = 112|issue = 4|doi = 10.1162/003355300555448|language = en|first = Oliver|last = Hart|first2 = Andrei|last2 = Shleifer|first3 = Robert W.|last3 = Vishny}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Public versus private ownership: Quantity contracts and the allocation of investment tasks|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272709001492|journal = Journal of Public Economics|date = 2010|pages = 258–268|volume = 94|issue = 3–4|doi = 10.1016/j.jpubeco.2009.11.009|first = Eva I.|last = Hoppe|first2 = Patrick W.|last2 = Schmitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; The property rights approach has been extended in many directions.

== The role of property rights in economic and political development ==
Classical economists such as [[Adam Smith]] and [[Karl Marx]] generally recognize the importance of property rights in the process of economic development, and modern mainstream economics agree with such a recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Besley|first= Timothy|last2= Maitreesh|first2= Ghatak|date= 2009|editor-last= Rodrik|editor-first= Dani|editor2-last= Rosenzweig|editor2-first= Mark R|title= Property Rights and Economic Development|url= |journal= Handbook of Development Economics|publisher= New York: Elsevier|volume= V|pages= 4526–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A widely-accepted explanation is that well-enforced property rights provide incentives for individuals to participate in economic activities, such as investment, innovation and trade, which lead to a more efficient market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Acemoglu|first= Daron|last2= Johnson|first2= Simon|last3= Robinson|first3= James|date= 2005|title= Institutions as a fundamental cause of long-run growth|url= |journal= Handbook of Economic Growth|volume= 1|pages= 397}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of property rights in Europe during the Middle Ages provides an example.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Acemoglu|first= Daron|last2= Johnson|first2= Simon|last3= Robinson|first3= James A.|date= 2005|title= Chapter 6 Institutions as a Fundamental Cause of Long-Run Growth|doi= 10.1016/S1574-0684(05)01006-3|journal= Handbook of Economic Growth|volume= Volume 1|pages= 385–472|series= Handbook of Economic Growth|isbn= 978-0-444-52041-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this epoch, full political power came into the hands of hereditary monarchies, which often abused their power to exploit producers, to impose arbitrary taxes, or to refuse to pay their debts. The lack of protection for property rights provided little incentive for landowners and merchants to invest in land, physical or human capital, or technology. After the [[First English Civil War| English Civil War]] of 1642-1646 and the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, shifts of political power away from the Stuart monarchs led to the strengthening of property rights of both land and capital owners. Consequently, rapid economic development took place, setting the stage for [[Industrial Revolution]].

Property rights are also believed to lower transaction costs by providing an efficient resolution for conflicts over scarce resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Alchian|first= Armen|last2= Demsetz|first2= Harold|date= 1973|title= The Property Right Paradigm|url= |journal= The Journal of Economic History|volume= 33|issue= 1|pages= 16–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empirically, using historical data of former European colonies, Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson find substantial evidence that good economic institutions – those that provide secure property rights and equality of opportunity – lead to economic prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Acemoglu|first= Daron|last2= Johnson|first2= Simon|last3= Robinson|first3= James|date= 2005|chapter= Institutions as a fundamental cause of long-run growth|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=fQ4JBwLsz8cC|title= Handbook of Economic Growth|volume= 1|pages= 385–472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Property rights might be closely related to the evolution of political order, due to their protections of an individual's claims on economic rents.{{cn|date=August 2018}} North, Wallis and Weingast argue that [[origin of property rights | property rights originate]] to facilitate elites' rent-seeking activities. Particularly, the legal and political systems that protect elites' claims on rent revenues form the basis of the so-called "limited access order", in which non-elites are denied access to political power and economic privileges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= North|first= Douglass C|last2= Wallis|first2= John J|last3= Weingast|first3= Barry R|date= 2006|title= A conceptual framework for interpreting recorded human history|url= |journal= National Bureau of Economic Research|volume= 12795|pages= 32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a historical study of medieval England, for instance, North and Thomas find that the dramatic development of English land laws in the 13th century resulted from elites' interests in exploiting rent revenues from land ownership after a sudden rise in land price in the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= North|first= Douglass C|last2= Thomas|first2= Robert P|date= 1971|title= The Rise and Fall of the Manorial System: A Theoretical Model|url= |journal= The Journal of Economic History|volume= 31|issue= 4|pages= 777–803}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the modern "open access order", which consists of a democratic political system and a free- market economy, usually features widespread, secure and impersonal property rights. Universal property rights, along with impersonal economic and political competition, downplay the role of rent-seeking and instead favor innovations and productive activities in a modern economy.&lt;ref&gt;

Queer porn works to have authentic representations with respect to the [[sexual orientation]]s, [[gender identities]] and [[desire]]s of the performers in it.&lt;ref name="seise"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seise|first=Cherie|date=April 2010|year=|title=Fucking Utopia: Queer Porn and Queer Liberation|url=http://freireproject.org/wp-content/journals/sprinkle/Sprinkle_vol3.pdf|journal=Sprinkle: A Journal of Sexual Diversity Studies|volume=3|pages=19–29|via=|accessdate=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from [[heterosexual]] pornography, [[gay pornography]], or [[lesbian pornography]], because queer porn will often be a partnering of performers outside traditional pornographic categories.&lt;ref name="seise" /&gt; Gay porn falls into a similar situation as heterosexual porn by putting an emphasis on androcentric imagery of pleasure, as scholar [[Richard Dyer]] argues, and often glorifies the homonormative, masculine body-type and behavior.

''C’lickme : A Netporn Studies Reader''. Amsterdam: Institute of Network Cultures, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a [[DVD]] may have one scene which shows a [[transgender lesbian]] with a [[cisgender]] femme-identified queer woman, while the next scene may showcase two transgender queer-identified men.&lt;ref name="seise" /&gt;

The genre of queer pornography as defined above is relatively recent and has been popularized and distributed by adult film companies such as [[Pink and White Productions]], Trouble Films, Real Queer Productions among others. While porn is not limited to adult cinema and can exist in the context of a variety of media such as queer written pornography, the currently produced queer porn is mostly in the form of video.

Some prominent queer producers include [[Shine Louise Houston]], Chelsea Poe, and [[April Flores]] who attempt to challenge the filming methods within the [[porn industry]].  Typically within the Porn Industry, the producer and director have the majority of control over how each scene will be performed, who is showcased in each set, and creating a differential of performers’ salaries based on their popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKee|first=Alan|date=2016-04-02|title=Pornography as a creative industry: challenging the exceptionalist approach to pornography|journal=Porn Studies|volume=3|issue=2|pages=107–119|doi=10.1080/23268743.2015.1065202|issn=2326-8743}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queer pornography counters these practices by actively engaging performers in the creations of scenes allowing them to form more organically as a collaboration with a more horizontal access of control rather than a hierarchically vertical system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://goldengatexpress.org/2015/10/20/the-underside-of-the-porn-industry/|title=The underside of the porn industry|last=Wright|first=Cody|date=2015-10-20|website=Golden Gate Xpress|access-date=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dar-dowling/shine-louise-houston-jiz-_b_7595976.html|title=Shine Louise Houston &amp; Jiz Lee: Crowdfunding Queer Porn Their Way.…|last=Dowling|first=Dar|date=2015-06-18|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Queer porn similarly celebrates ejaculation but with some signification differences to conventional porn. Unlike in the mainstream industry, the performer does not have a financial bonus for providing such a "money shot." Directors only encourage performers to perform an orgasm if/when the actors feel like it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since the [[money shot]] in conventional porn relies of visibility for the camera, it necessarily centers on showing external ejaculation of the penis as the ultimate climax. This reflects attention back to the male centered gaze and a representative instance of phallic power and pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/838864947|title=Hard core : power, pleasure, and the "frenzy of the visible"|last=Linda|first=Williams,|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520219434|oclc=838864947|date=1999-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queer porn attempts to broaden such a delineation of phallic centered climax and the pornographic production.

== Discourses on Queer Pornography ==
Queer Pornography has been attracting academic attention since the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pinkwhite.biz/PWWP/superfreaky-queerness-feminism-and-aesthetics-in-queer-pornography/|title=Superfreaky: Queerness, Feminism, and Aesthetics in Queer Pornography {{!}} Pink &amp; White Productions|website=pinkwhite.biz|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/963852414|title=The feminist porn book : the politics of producing pleasure|last=Tristan.|first=Taormino,|date=2013-01-01|publisher=The Feminist Press|isbn=9781558618183|oclc=963852414}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/942285669|title=Porn.com : making sense of online pornography|last=Feona.|first=Attwood,|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9781433102073|oclc=942285669}}&lt;/ref&gt; A challenge within queer pornography is that some labeled queer porn may depict scenarios that could be part of any [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]]  mainstream pornographic film. This follows academic Niels van Doorn’s concept of the “pornoscript,” eroticizing heterosexual difference and focusing on the male subject position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van Doorn|first=Niels|date=2010-11-01|title=Keeping it Real: User-Generated Pornography, Gender Reification, and Visual Pleasure|journal=Convergence|language=en|volume=16|issue=4|pages=411–430|doi=10.1177/1354856510375144|issn=1354-8565}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a scene from Real Queer Productions’s ''Fluid'' depicts a threesome with elements of submissions and dominance, rough vaginal and anal penetration, and external male ejaculation. The film’s adherence to the pornographic conventions is predictable and serialized. However, further inspection into queer porn that appears like [[Heteronormativity|heteronormative]]  pornography reveals particular parody of serial strategy to expose [[Gender Construction|gender construction]] within most conventional pornography.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/880439054|title=Pornography and seriality : the culture of producing pleasure|last=1983-|first=Schaschek, Sarah,|isbn=9781137363121|oclc=880439054}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process creates a queer version of the model of "subversive repetition" theorized by academic [[Judith Butler]].  Drawing particular attention to such a facet through imitation permits its productive act of deconstruction. Thus, queer pornography can disassemble the pornographic norm by mimicking it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Additionally, queer pornography clearly reveals the imitative process of gender identification when introducing the figure of the transgender man. Compared to trans woman(male-to-female) individuals depicted across other types of pornography, female-to-male [[Trans man|trans men]] appear significantly in [[Feminist pornography|feminist]] and queer pornography.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Films of queer pornography make "deviant" sexualities more visible by simultaneously starting a process of their [[normalization (sociology)|normalization]]. So, in order to avoid creating a new kind of norm, queer pornography constantly works along the edge of the [[Gender systems|gender system]]. For example, when strap-on dildos made their appearance in queer pornography leaving viewers guessing whether they were faced with a "real" penis or a dildo, they soon became a common sight. While these strap-on dildos originally offered new ways of thinking about gender and sexuality, their ubiquitous use risked losing their subversive power.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As scholar Sarah Schaschek writes, “If heterosexual pornography accentuates clearly defined identity categories such as class, age, ethnicity, sexuality, or gender, queer films tend to reveal the high degree of stylization behind these identities”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Radical behaviorism''' was pioneered by [[B. F. Skinner]] and is his "philosophy of the science of behavior."&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, Susan M., and Morris, Edward K. (1987). [http://numerons.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/01-a-history-of-the-term-radical-behaviorism.pdf "A History of the Term ''Radical Behaviorism'': From Watson to Skinner"]. ''The Behavior Analyst,'' 10(1), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to the philosophy behind behavior analysis, and is to be distinguished from [[methodological behaviorism]]&amp;mdash;which has an intense emphasis on observable behaviors&amp;mdash;by its inclusion of thinking, feeling, and other private events in the analysis of human and animal psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Chiesa, Mecca (1974). ''Radical Behaviorism: The Philosophy and the Science.'' Reprinted by Authors Cooperative (1994): Boston, Massachusetts. {{ISBN|0962331147}}, {{ISBN|978-0962331145}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The research in behavior analysis is called the [[experimental analysis of behavior]] and the application of this field is called [[applied behavior analysis]] (ABA),&lt;ref&gt;Staats, Finley, Minke, Wolf, 1964, “Reinforcement variables and the control of reading responses” &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Staats and Butterfield, 1965, “Treatment of non-reading in a culturally-deprived juvenile delinquent: an application of reinforcement principles”&lt;/ref&gt; which was originally termed "[[behavior modification]]."&lt;ref&gt;Krasner and Ullmann, 1965, “Research in behavior modification”&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radical behaviorism as natural science==
Radical behaviorism inherits from [[behaviorism]] the position that the science of behavior is a natural science, a belief that animal behavior can be studied profitably and compared with human behavior, a strong emphasis on the environment as cause of behavior, and an emphasis on the operations involved in the modification of behavior. Radical behaviorism does not claim that organisms are ''[[tabula rasa]]'' whose behavior is unaffected by biological or genetic endowment.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Rather, it simply asserts that experiential factors play a major role in determining the behavior of many complex organisms, and that the study of these matters is a major field of research in its own right.

The most precise way to describe radical behaviorism as "radical" is to understand that instances such as evolution and cell division are occurrences that just happen. There is no 3rd party that assists in this transformation, they can however be explained by other naturally occurring events. They should not try to be explained through objects that are not tangible i.e. ghosts or inner entities. We therefore conclude that natural occurring events may be examined in relation to our past and present environments through the effect they have on human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Baum, William. "What is radical behaviorism? A review of Jay Moore's Conceptual foundations of radical behaviorism.." Radical Behaviorism 95.1 (2011): 119-126. ProQuest. Web. 12 Jan. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Common misunderstandings===
Although there are many criticisms of Skinner's work, many textbooks and theorists like Noam Chomsky label Skinnerian or radical behaviorism as S–R (stimulus–response, or to use Skinner's term, "respondent"),&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. (1959) [http://www.chomsky.info/articles/1967----.htm "A Review of B.F. Skinner's ''Verbal Behavior"'']. In Leon A. Jakobovits and Murray S. Miron (eds.), ''Readings in the Psychology of Language'', Prentice-Hall, 1967, pp. 142–3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacCorquodale, K. (1970). [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&amp;artid=1333660 "On Chomsky's review of Skinner's ''Verbal Behavior"'']. ''[[Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior]]'', 13, 83–99.&lt;/ref&gt; or Pavlovian psychology, and argue that this limits the approach. Although contemporary psychology rejects many of Skinner's conclusions, his work into [[operant conditioning]] which emphasizes the importance of consequences in modifying discriminative responses is useful when combined with current understandings about the uniqueness of evolved human thought over other animals &lt;ref name="The Marvelous Learning Animal"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/book-review-marvelous-learning-animal-what-makes-human-nature-unique
|title=The Marvelous Learning Animal|author=Arthur W. Staats|date=2012|accessdate=April 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.


Many textbooks {{By whom|date=March 2012}} argue that radical behaviorism maintains the position that animals (including humans) are passive receivers of conditioning, failing to take into account that:
* operant behavior is titled operant because it operates on the environment
* operant behavior is emitted, not elicited: Animals act on the environment and the environment acts back on them, or
* the consequence of a behavior can itself be a stimulus; one needs not present anything for [[shaping (psychology)|shaping]] to take place.

Radical behaviorism is often dismissed as logical positivism. Skinnerians maintain that Skinner was not a logical positivist and recognized the importance of thinking as behavior. This position is made quite clear in ''About Behaviorism''.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1974). ''About Behaviorism''. New York: Knopf.&lt;/ref&gt; A clearer position for radical behaviorism seems to be the movement known philosophically as American pragmatism.&lt;ref&gt;Moxley, Roy (2003). "Pragmatic Selectionism: The Philosophy of Behavior Analysis". ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 4(3), 289–314. [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

For a review and summary of Skinner's book ''Verbal Behavior'' see the article [[Verbal Behavior]].

==The basics: operant psychology==
{{main|Operant conditioning}}
Skinner saw that classical conditioning did not account for the behavior most of us are interested in, such as riding a bike or writing a book. His observations led him to propose a theory about how these and similar behaviors, called operants, come about.

Roughly speaking, in [[operant conditioning]], an operant is actively emitted and produces changes in the world (i.e., produces consequences) that alter the likelihood that the behavior will occur again.

As represented in the table below, operant conditioning involves two basic actions (increasing or decreasing the probability that a specific behavior will occur in the future), which are accomplished by adding or removing one of two basic types of stimuli, positive reinforcers or negative reinforcers &lt;ref&gt;Huitt and Hummel (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Stimulus type
! Effect: increase behavior
! Effect: decrease behavior
|-
| Positive Reinforcer
| Add positive reinforcer
| Remove positive reinforcer
|-
| Punishment
| Remove punishment:
| Add punishment stimulus
|}


In other words:
* If the probability of a behavior is increased as a consequence of the presentation of a stimulus, that stimulus is a [[positive reinforcer]].
* If the probability of a behavior is increased as a consequence of the withdrawal of a stimulus, that stimulus is a punishment.
* If the probability of a behavior is decreased as a consequence of the presentation of a stimulus, that stimulus is a punisher.
* If the probability of a behavior is decreased as a consequence of the withdrawal of a stimulus, that stimulus is a punishment.


Instrumental conditioning is another term for operant conditioning that is most closely associated with scientists who studied running through a maze. Skinner pioneered the free operant technique, where organisms could respond at any time during a protracted experimental session. Thus Skinner's dependent variable was usually the frequency or rate of responding, not the errors that were made or the speed of traversal of a maze.

Operant conditioning affects the future of the organism, that is how the organism will respond after the actions summarized above occur.

==Explaining behavior and the importance of the environment==
[[John B. Watson]] argued against the use of references to mental states and held that psychology should study behavior directly, holding private events as impossible to study scientifically. Skinner rejected this position conceding the importance of thinking, feelings and "inner behavior" in his analysis. Skinner did not hold to truth by agreement, as Watson did, so he was not limited by observation.

In Watson's days (and in Skinner's early days), it was held that psychology was at a disadvantage as a science because behavioral explanations should take physiology into account. Very little was known about physiology at the time. Skinner argued that behavioral explanations of psychological phenomena are "just as true" as physiological explanations. In arguing this, he took a non-[[reductionistic]] approach to psychology. Skinner, however, redefined behavior to include "everything that an organism does," including thinking, feeling and speaking and argued that these phenomena were valid subject matters. (The challenge was that objective observation and measurement was often impossible.) The term ''radical behaviorism'' refers to just this: that ''everything'' an organism does is a behavior [quotes and references necessary here].

However, Skinner ruled out thinking and feeling as valid ''explanations'' of behavior. The reasoning is this:

Thinking and feeling are not [[epiphenomena]] nor have they any other special status, and are just more behavior to explain. Explaining behavior by referring to thought or feelings are pseudo-explanations because they merely point to more behavior to be explained. Skinner proposed environmental factors as proper causes of behavior because:
* Environmental factors are at a different logical level than behavior and actions.
* One can manipulate behavior by manipulating the environment

This holds only for explaining the class of behaviors known as [[operant]] behaviors. This class of behavior Skinner held as the most interesting study matter.

Many textbooks, in noting the emphasis Skinner places on the environment, argue that Skinner held that the organism is a blank slate or a ''[[tabula rasa]]''. Skinner wrote extensively on the limits and possibilities nature places on conditioning. Conditioning is implemented in the body as a physiological process and is subject to the current state, learning history, and history of the species. Skinner does not consider people a blank slate, or ''tabula rasa''.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. "On Having A Poem" in which he states: "I am not an S–R psychologist." also in ''About Behaviorism'' where he states this position again&lt;/ref&gt;

Many textbooks seem to confuse Skinner's rejection of physiology with Watson's rejection of private events. It ''is'' true to some extent that Skinner's psychology considers humans a [[black box (systems)|black box]], since Skinner maintains that behavior can be explained without taking into account what goes on in the organism. However, the black box is not private events, but physiology. Skinner considers physiology as useful, interesting, valid, etc., but not necessary for operant behavioral theory and research.

[The author of this material has to present quotations and references for it appears that the writer is interpreting radical behaviorism rather than describing Skinner’s radical behaviorism.]

==Private events in a radical behaviorist account==
Radical behaviorism differs from other forms of behaviorism in that it treats everything we do as behavior, including private events such as thinking and feeling. Unlike [[John B. Watson]]'s behaviorism, private events are not dismissed as "epiphenomena," but are seen as subject to the same principles of learning and modification as have been discovered to exist for overt behavior. Although private events are not publicly observable behaviors, radical behaviorism accepts that we are each observers of our own private behavior.

Many textbooks, in emphasizing that Skinner held behavior to be the proper subject matter of psychology, fail to clarify Skinner's position and implicitly or even explicitly posit that Skinner ruled out the study of private events as unscientific. This is Watson's position, not Skinner's. [citations needed]

==Outgrowths==
There are radical behaviorist schools of [[animal training]], [[management psychology|management]], [[clinical psychology|clinical practice]], and [[educational psychology|education]]. Skinner's political views have left their mark in small ways as principles adopted by a small handful of utopian communities such as [[Los Horcones]], and in ongoing challenges to aversive techniques in control of human and animal behavior.

Radical behaviorism has generated numerous descendants. Examples of these include molar approaches associated with [[Richard Herrnstein]] and William Baum, Howard Rachlin's [[teleological behaviorism]], [[William Timberlake]]'s [[behavior systems]] approach, and [[John Staddon]]'s theoretical behaviorism.

Skinner's theories on [[verbal behavior]] have seen widespread application in therapies for [[autistic]] children that are based on [[applied behavior analysis]] (ABA). [This statement appears to be an error in view of the MacPherson, Bonem, Green, and Osborne 1984 paper&lt;ref&gt;MacPherson, Bonem, and Osborne 1984&lt;/ref&gt; that states Skinner’s “verbal behavior“ (1957) led to no research.]

== Criticism ==
Criticisms of Behaviourism focus on its supposed theoretical weaknesses as well as its "cold" methods. Psychologists today consider this classical form of behaviorism to be "wrong" in the sense that modern cognitive research has attempted to clearly demonstrate the role of mental processes in psychology.  A famous, but gruesome line of experimentation by noted psychologist [[Martin Seligman]] has been used to demonstrate behaviorism's inability to explain [[learned helplessness]]. Dogs, which had previously been placed in cages with fully electrified and inescapable floors, later never bothered to discover that newer cages they were placed in had a non-electrified section (separated by a short 'wall' that control dogs had no difficulty hopping). Instead, they laid down and quietly suffered. According to the critiques this demonstrated that, internally, the dogs perceived a lack of control over their environment. This is why they never bothered to remove themselves from the aversive stimulus when they had the option. However, this phenomena can be described and predicted from a behaviorist framework as well&lt;ref&gt;https://imgur.com/a/nLr4a&lt;/ref&gt;. Through a process of extinction the dogs had learned that escaping did not lead to the negative reinforcement of escaping the shocks. Hence, they stopped trying.

'''Reciprocal determinism''' is the theory set forth by [[psychologist]] [[Albert Bandura]] which states that a person's behavior both influences and is influenced by [[personality psychology|personal factors]] and the [[social environment]]. Bandura accepts the possibility that an individual's behavior may be [[operant conditioning|conditioned]] through the use of consequences. At the same time he asserts that a person's behavior (and personal factors, such as cognitive skills or attitudes) can impact the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Bandura (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; These skill sets result in an under- or overcompensated ego that, for all creative purposes, is too strong or too weak to focus on pure outcome. This is important because Bandura was able to prove the strong correlation between this with experiments.

Bandura was able to show this when he created the Bandura's Box experiment.  As an example, Bandura's reciprocal determinism could occur when a child is acting out in school. The child doesn't like going to school; therefore, he/she acts out in class. This results in teachers and administrators of the school disliking having the child around. When confronted by the situation, the child admits he/she hates school and other peers don't like him/her. This results in the child acting inappropriately, forcing the administrators who dislike having him/her around to create a more restrictive environment for children of this stature. Each behavioral and environmental factor coincides with the child and so forth resulting in a continuous battle on all three levels.

Reciprocal determinism is the idea that behavior is controlled or determined by the individual, through cognitive processes, and by the environment, through external social stimulus events.  The basis of reciprocal determinism should transform individual behavior by allowing subjective thought processes transparency when contrasted with cognitive, environmental, and external social stimulus events.

Actions do not go one way or the other, as it is affected by repercussions, meaning one's behavior is complicated and can't be thought of as individual and environmental means. Behavior consist of environmental and individual parts that interlink together to function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/108107398127355 | volume=3 | title=Perpetuating Passivity: Reliance and Reciprocal Determinism in Physician-Patient Interaction | journal=Journal of Health Communication | pages=233–259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many studies showed reciprocal associations between people and their environments over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jeronimus et al.|year=2014|title= Mutual Reinforcement Between Neuroticism and Life Experiences: A Five-Wave, 16-Year Study to Test Reciprocal Causation|journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=107|issue=4|pages=751–64|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0037009|doi=10.1037/a0037009|pmid=25111305}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Laceulle et al. | year = 2015 | title = Why Not Everyone Gets Their Fair Share of Stress: Adolescent's Perceived Relationship Affection Mediates Associations Between Temperament and Subsequent Stressful Social Events | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/per.1989/full| journal = European Journal of Personality| volume = 29 | issue = 2| pages = 125–137 | doi=10.1002/per.1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Research conducted in this field include the study of doctor-patient relationships where one group of patients are termed 'physician-reliant' and the other group 'self-reliant'. The physician-reliant patients tend to be more passive in their decision making and rely on their physicians to make their choices for them. Self-reliant patients take a more active role in deciding which health options would better suit them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Akoul|first=Gregory M.|title=Perpetuating Passivity: Reliance and Reciprocal Determinism in Physician-Patient Interaction|journal=Journal of Health Communication: Internal Perspectives|volume=3|series=3|pages=233–259|doi=10.1080/108107398127355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mathematics===

Another relevant research is regarding the reciprocal determinism of self-efficacy and mathematical performance. It shows that reciprocal determinism may not be the appropriate model in all cultures but does take place in most. Self-efficacy is a conceptualized assessment of the person's competence to perform a specific task. Self-efficacy results from success or failures that arise in attempts to learn a task. Self-efficacy, measure by a personal confidence level before each question, and the mathematical scores were obtained in 41 countries for the study by Kitty and Trevor Williams. The reciprocal determinism of mathematics self-efficacy and achievement was found in 26 of the 30 nations. They suggest that this might be a fundamental psychological process that takes place across national boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Williams et al.|title=Self-Efficacy and Performance in Mathematics: Reciprocal Determinism in 33 Nations|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|pages=453–466|doi=10.1037/a0017271|volume=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Albert Bandura, [[self-efficacy]] is defined as a person's belief in their capability to accomplish a certain task. Another study looked at the relationship of self-efficacy and job culture with job satisfaction among athletic trainers. The study used Bandura's triadic reciprocal causation model as a template to label job satisfaction as the behavioural factor, self-efficacy as the personal factor, and job culture as the environmental factor.&lt;ref&gt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/305027215&lt;/ref&gt;

{{clarify|date=March 2013}}&lt;!--Please clarify what is meant by "reciprocal determinism of self-efficacy and performance" and in what way this may not be the appropriate model in all cultures.--&gt;

==Triadic reciprocal causation==
'''Triadic reciprocal causation''' is a term introduced by [[Albert Bandura]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rU9MRvYIh5YC&amp;pg=PA473&amp;lpg=PA473&amp;dq=triadic+reciprocal+causation&amp;source=web&amp;ots=W1H85MGefi&amp;sig=DbAABuTNweBRbLSL6jQ15Pk7bAA ''Psychology: An International Perspective'' by Michael W. Eysenck, p. 473].&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to the mutual influence between three sets of factors:
* personal factors (e.g., [[cognitive]], [[affective]] and [[biological]] events),
* the environment,
* [[behavior]]

==Interaction of genes and environment==
[[Behavioral genetics]] is a relatively new field of study attempting to make sense of both [[Heredity|genetic]] and environmental contributions to individual variations in human behavior. Genes can be turned on and off. Multiple genes are factors in forming behavior traits.

===Aggression in abused boys===
Researchers believe there is a genetic link to impulsive aggression through the impact of a gene on the production of an [[enzyme]] called [[Monoamine oxidase A]] (MAOA).&lt;ref&gt;Meyer-Lindenberg, Andreas, et al. December 30, 2005. [http://intramural.nimh.nih.gov/research/pubs/lindenberg01.pdf Neural mechanisms of genetic risk for impulsivity and violence in humans.] NIMH. Accessed August 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The MAOA gene reduces the production of MAOA, leading to increased incidents of impulsive aggression. A 26-year study in [[New Zealand]] found strong correlation between experience of [[childhood abuse]] and criminal or violent behavior in males with the MAOA gene.&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/08/01/health/main517241.shtml Study: Abuse And Genetics = Aggression] August 1, 2002. Accessed August 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In that study, impulsive aggression was found to be nine times more likely to manifest in males with the gene who were [[abused]] than in abused males without the gene or males with the gene who had not been abused.

== Malaysian/Indonesian origin ==
Amok originated from the Malaysian/Indonesian word ''meng-âmuk'', which when roughly defined means "to make a furious and desperate charge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hempel A. A., Levine R. D., Meloy J. D., Westermeyer J. D. | year = 2000 | title = Cross-cultural review of sudden mass assault by a single individual in the oriental and occidental cultures | url = | journal = Journal of Forensic Sciences | volume = 45 | issue = 3| pages = 582–588 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Malaysian and Indonesian cultures, amok was rooted in a deep spiritual belief.&lt;ref&gt;Van Loon, F. H. G. (1927). "Amok and Latah". Retrieved March 30, 2013 from PsychINFO. [http://huie.hsu.edu:2308/ehost/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=a71ca420-96ff-40e4-be67-3ac88801c158%40sessionmgr12&amp;hid=3&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&amp;AN=2006-01643-010]&lt;/ref&gt; They believed that amok was caused by the ''hantu belian'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pusat Rujukan Persuratan Melayu: hantu belian|url=http://prpm.dbp.gov.my/Search.aspx?k=hantu+belian|publisher=Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka|accessdate=6 November 2011|location=Malaysia|language=Malay, English|quote=hantu belian}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was an evil tiger spirit that entered one’s body and caused the heinous act. As a result of the belief, those in Indonesian culture tolerated amok and dealt with the after-effects with no ill will towards the assailant.&lt;ref name="ncbi"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Saint Martin | first = Michael | year = 1999 | title = Running Amok: A Modern Perspective on a Culture-Bound Syndrome | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | issn = 0160-6689| pmc = 181064 | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pmid = 15014687 | pages = 66–70 | doi=10.4088/pcc.v01n0302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although commonly used in a colloquial and less-violent sense, the phrase is particularly associated with a specific sociopathic [[culture-bound syndrome]] in the cultures of [[Culture of Malaysia|Malaysia]], [[Culture of Indonesia|Indonesia]] and [[Culture of Brunei|Brunei]]. In a typical case of ''running amok'', an individual (often male), having shown no previous sign of anger or any inclination to violence, will acquire a weapon (traditionally a sword or dagger, but presently any of a variety of weapons) and in a sudden frenzy, will attempt to kill or seriously injure anyone he encounters and himself.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=181064|year=1999|author1=Saint Martin|first1=M. L.|title=Running Amok: A Modern Perspective on a Culture-Bound Syndrome|journal=Primary Care Companion to the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|volume=1|issue=3|pages=66–70|pmid=15014687|doi=10.4088/pcc.v01n0302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amok typically takes place in a well populated or crowded area. Amok episodes of this kind normally end with the attacker being killed by bystanders or committing [[suicide]], eliciting theories that amok may be a form of intentional suicide in cultures where suicide is heavily stigmatized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=23464 |title=Definition of Amok |publisher=Medterms.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who do not commit suicide and are not killed typically lose consciousness, and upon regaining consciousness, claim amnesia.

An early Western description of the practice appears in the journals of [[James Cook|Captain James Cook]], a British explorer, who encountered amok firsthand in 1770 during a voyage around the world. Cook writes of individuals behaving in a reckless, violent manner, without cause and "indiscriminately killing and maiming villagers and animals in a frenzied attack."&lt;ref&gt;(Jackson, Y. (Ed.).(2006). Encyclopedia of multicultural psychology. University of Kansas: Sage Publications)&lt;/ref&gt;

A widely accepted explanation links amok with male [[honor]] (amok by women and children is virtually unknown).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alexanra Ringe|first=Carrie McLaren|title=Curious Mental Illnesses Around the World|url=http://www.stayfreemagazine.org/archives/21/mental_illness.html|publisher=stayfreemagazone.org|accessdate=March 25, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121218053501/http://www.stayfreemagazine.org/archives/21/mental_illness.html#|archive-date=2012-12-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Running amok would thus be both a way of escaping the world (since perpetrators were normally killed or committed suicide) and re-establishing one's reputation as a man to be feared and respected.

== Contemporary syndrome ==
"Running amok" is used to refer to the behavior of someone who, in the grip of strong emotion, obtains a weapon and begins attacking people indiscriminately, often with multiple fatalities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; An episode of amok may be triggered by a period of depression or highly aggressive behavior. The slang terms ''[[going postal]]'' or ''going ballistic'' are similar in scope.
Police describe such an event as a [[spree killer|killing spree]]. If the individual is seeking death an alternate method is often "[[suicide by cop]]".

Amok is often described as a culture-bound (or culture-specific) syndrome,&lt;ref name="pmid15014687"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Saint Martin ML |title=Running Amok: A Modern Perspective on a Culture-Bound Syndrome |journal=Prim Care Companion J Clin Psychiatry |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=66–70 |date=June 1999 |pmid=15014687 |pmc=181064 |doi= 10.4088/pcc.v01n0302|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid1427677"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gaw AC, Bernstein RL |title=Classification of amok in DSM-IV |journal=Hosp Community Psychiatry |volume=43 |issue=8 |pages=789–93 |date=August 1992 |pmid=1427677 |doi= |url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=1427677 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a psychological condition whose manifestation is strongly shaped by cultural factors. Other reported culture-bound syndromes are [[latah]] and [[Penis panic|koro]]. Amok is also sometimes considered one of the subcategories of [[dissociative disorders]] (cross-cultural variant).

== Officially classified as a psychiatric condition ==
In 1849, amok was officially classified as a psychiatric condition based on numerous reports and case studies that showed the majority of individuals who committed amok were, in some sense, mentally ill.&lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt; The modern [[DSM-IV]] method of [[classification of mental disorders]] contains two official types of amok disorder; beramok and amok. Beramok is considered to be the more common of the two and is associated with the depression and sadness resulting from a loss and the subsequent brooding process. Loss includes, but is not limited to, the death of a spouse or loved one, divorce, loss of a job, money, power, etc. Beramok is associated with mental issues of severe depression or other mood disorders. Amok, the rarer form, is believed to stem from rage, insult, or a vendetta against a person, society, or object for a wide variety of reasons. Amok has been more closely associated with psychosis, personality disorders, bipolar disorder, and delusions.&lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt;

== Historical and cross-cultural comparisons ==
Early travelers in Asia sometimes describe a kind of military amok, in which soldiers apparently facing inevitable defeat suddenly burst into a frenzy of violence which so startled their enemies that it either delivered victory or at least ensured what the soldier in that culture considered an honourable death.

An example would be during the [[Battle of Bukit Chandu]] in Singapore during WWII when 41 outnumbered soldiers of the Malay Regiment, led by [[Adnan Saidi]], charged and went all out against a 13 000 strong invading Japanese Army. They continued the fight armed with just knives and bayonets for three days before they were finally defeated.

This form of amok appears to resemble the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] ''[[Berserker]]'', the ''cafard'' or ''cathard'' (Polynesia), ''mal de pelea'' (Puerto Rico), and ''iich'aa'' (Navaho).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/ant100/pdf/MedicalAnthropology.pdf |title=Medical Anthropology: Culture-bound syndromes |accessdate=2009-04-29 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary [[Indonesia]], the term ''amok'' (''amuk'') generally refers not to individual violence, but to frenzied violence by mobs. Indonesians now commonly use the term 'gelap mata' (literally 'darkened eyes') to refer to individual amok. [[Laurens van der Post]] experienced the phenomenon in the East Indies and wrote in 1955:

{{quote|'Gelap mata', the Dark Eye, is an expression used in Sumatra and Java to describe a curious and disturbing social phenomenon. Socially speaking, the Malays, Sumatrans and Javanese are the best behaved people I have ever encountered. On the surface they are an extremely gentle, refined, submissive people. In fact the word 'Malay' comes from 'malu', 'gentle', and gentleness is a quality prized above all others among the Malays and their neighbours. In their family life, in their submission to traditional and parental authority, in their communal duties, they are among the most obedient people on earth. But every now and then something very disturbing happens. A man who has behaved in this obliging manner all his life and who has always done his duty by the outside world to perfection, suddenly finds it impossible to keep doing so. Overnight he revolts against goodness and dutifulness.&lt;ref&gt;[[Laurens van der Post|van der Post, Laurens]], ''The Dark Eye in Africa'' (London, 1955), p.51-52&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the [[Philippines]], ''amok'' also means unreasoning murderous rage by an individual. In 1876, the Spanish governor-general of the Philippines [[José Malcampo]] coined the term ''[[juramentado]]'' for the behavior (from ''juramentar'' - "to take an oath"), surviving into modern [[Philippine languages]] as ''huramentado''.&lt;ref name=Hurley14&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hurley |first1=Vic |title=Swish of the Kris; The Story of the Moros |url=http://www.nikhef.nl/~tonvr/keris/keris2/swish/index.html |accessdate=April 17, 2011 |edition= |series= |volume= |issue= |date= |year=1936 |month= |origyear= |publisher=E.P.

Norse [[Berserker]]s and the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] battle trance are two other examples of the tendency of certain groups to work themselves up into a killing frenzy.

According to the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition]], some notable cases have occurred among the [[Rajputs]]. In 1634, the eldest son of the [[raja]] of [[Jodhpur]] ran amok at the court of [[Shah Jahan]], failing in his attack on the emperor, but killing five of his officials. During the 18th century, again, at [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]] (Sind), two envoys, sent by the Jodhpur chief in regard to a quarrel between the two states, stabbed the prince and twenty-six of his suite before they themselves fell.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Amuck, Running|volume=1|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Korean caste system}}
The '''sangmin''' ({{korean|hanja=常民|hangul=상민|context=old}}) were the common people of [[Joseon]]-era Korea. About 75% of all Koreans at that time were sangmin.

==Etymology==
A more polite but less accurate name for the sangmin is '''yangmin''' ({{korean|hanja=良民|hangul=양민|context=old}}).
==History==
The sangmin consisted of peasants, laborers, fishermen, some craftsmen and merchants. The sangmin were considered "clean workers" but had little social status.  Generally they were poor. They paid most of Korea's taxes and were subject to the military draft. Their lives were hard, but they were the foundation of the [[Joseon Dynasty]], just like the [[chungin]] were the backbone of the government. Some of the sangmin owned land which they farmed. Others rented land from the [[yangban]] as tenant farmers. Those that did not farm had the lowest status. In everyday life, the sangmin were the working people who struggled to survive. The [[yangban]] and [[chungin]] controlled and ruled over them. The sangmin did the heavy work.  During the late Joseon period, particularly in the 19th century the sangmin rebelled many times because of the [[yangban]]s' oppression and corruption.

A '''scatter plot''' (also called a '''scatterplot''', '''scatter graph''', '''scatter chart''', '''scattergram''', or '''scatter diagram''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jarrell |first=Stephen B. |title=Basic Statistics |year=1994 |publisher=Wm. C. Brown Pub. |location=Dubuque, Iowa |isbn=0-697-21595-4 |edition=Special pre-publication |page=492 |quote=When we search for a relationship between two quantitative variables, a standard graph of the available data pairs (X,Y), called a ''scatter diagram'', frequently helps...}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of [[Plot (graphics)|plot]] or [[mathematical diagram]] using [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] to display values for typically two [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] for a set of data. If the points are color-coded, one additional variable can be displayed.
The data are displayed as a collection of points, each having the value of one variable determining the position on the horizontal axis and the value of the other variable determining the position on the [[vertical axis]].&lt;ref&gt;Utts, Jessica M. ''Seeing Through Statistics'' 3rd Edition, Thomson Brooks/Cole, 2005, pp 166-167. {{isbn|0-534-39402-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
A scatter plot can be used either when one continuous variable that is under the control of the experimenter and the other depends on it or when both continuous variables are independent. If a [[parameter]] exists that is systematically incremented and/or decremented by the other, it is called the ''control parameter'' or [[independent variable]] and is customarily plotted along the horizontal axis. The measured or [[dependent variable]] is customarily plotted along the vertical axis. If no dependent variable exists, either type of variable can be plotted on either axis and a scatter plot will illustrate only the degree of [[correlation]] (not [[causality|causation]]) between two variables.

A scatter plot can suggest various kinds of correlations between variables with a certain [[confidence interval]]. For example, weight and height, weight would be on y axis and height would be on the x axis. Correlations may be positive (rising), negative (falling), or null (uncorrelated). If the pattern of dots slopes from lower left to upper right, it indicates a positive [[correlation]] between the variables being studied. If the pattern of dots slopes from upper left to lower right, it indicates a negative correlation. A line of [[Curve fitting|best fit]] (alternatively called 'trendline') can be drawn in order to study the relationship between the variables. An equation for the correlation between the variables can be determined by established best-fit procedures. For a linear correlation, the best-fit procedure is known as [[linear regression]] and is guaranteed to generate a correct solution in a finite time. No universal best-fit procedure is guaranteed to generate a correct solution for arbitrary relationships. A scatter plot is also very useful when we wish to see how two comparable data sets agree to show nonlinear relationships between variables. The ability to do this can be enhanced by adding a smooth line such as [[Local regression|LOESS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cleveland | first = William | title = Visualizing data | publisher = At &amp; T Bell Laboratories Published by Hobart Press | location = Murray Hill, N.J. Summit, N.J | year = 1993 | isbn = 978-0963488404 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, if the data are represented by a mixture model of simple relationships, these relationships will be visually evident as superimposed patterns.

The scatter diagram is one of the [[Seven Basic Tools of Quality|seven basic tools]] of [[quality control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.asq.org/learn-about-quality/seven-basic-quality-tools/overview/overview.html | author = Nancy R. Tague | title = Seven Basic Quality Tools | year = 2004 | work = The Quality Toolbox | publisher = [[American Society for Quality]] | location = [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] | page = 15 | accessdate = 2010-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scatter charts can be built in the form of [[bubble chart|bubble]], marker, or/and [[line chart]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scatter Chart - AnyChart JavaScript Chart Documentation|url=http://docs.anychart.com/7.9.0/Basic_Charts_Types/Scatter_Chart|publisher=[[AnyChart]]|accessdate=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==
For example, to display a link between a person's lung capacity, and how long that person could hold his/her breath, a researcher would choose a group of people to study, then measure each one's lung capacity (first variable) and how long that person could hold his/her breath (second variable). The researcher would then plot the data in a scatter plot, assigning "lung capacity" to the horizontal axis, and "time holding breath" to the vertical axis.

A person with a lung capacity of 400 cl who held his/her breath for 21.7 seconds would be represented by a single dot on the scatter plot at the point (400, 21.7) in the [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]]. The scatter plot of all the people in the study would enable the researcher to obtain a visual comparison of the two variables in the data set, and will help to determine what kind of relationship there might be between the two variables.

== Scatterplot matrices ==
For a set of data variables (dimensions) X&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , X&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;, the scatter plot matrix shows all the pairwise scatter plots of the variables on a single view with multiple scatterplots in a matrix format. For k variables, the scatterplot matrix will contain k rows and k columns. A plot located on the intersection of i-th row and j-th column is a plot of variables X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; versus X&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/scatplma.htm Scatter Plot Matrix] at itl.nist.gov.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that each row and column is one dimension, and each cell plots a scatterplot of two dimensions.

A '''generalized scatterplot matrix'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Emerson|first1=John W.|last2=Green|first2=Walton A.|last3=Schoerke|first3=Barret|last4=Crowley|first4=Jason|title=The Generalized Pairs Plot|journal=Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics|date=2013|volume=22|issue=1|pages=79–91|doi=10.1080/10618600.2012.694762|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/ref/10.1080/10618600.2012.694762}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers a range of displays of paired combinations of categorical and quantitative variables. A [[mosaic plot]], [[fluctuation diagram]], or faceted [[bar chart]] may be used to display two categorical variables. Other plots are used for one categorical and one quantitative variables.

The '''social construction of the body''' is a hypothesis that affirms that the relationship between the body and the [[Sociocultural context|socio-cultural context]] occurs in both senses, and that society and culture influence the formation of its members to some extent.&lt;ref&gt;Guerra Carrasco, René (2005). "Donación de órganos: compresión y significado.". Universidad de Chile (20).&lt;/ref&gt; The body has become a social construction, in whose delimitation have participated multiple disciplines. Thus, [[medicine]] and [[religion]] can be mentioned as the agents that have traditionally influenced, together with the rules of urbanity and educational institutions. These four agents have been building a model, which every individual has as reference. According to [[Bryan Turner (sociologist)|Bryan S. Turner]], the social construction of the body is:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/951272599|title=The body &amp; society : explorations in social theory|last=S.|first=Turner, Bryan|publisher=Sage|isbn=1412929873|oclc=951272599}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"The nearest and immediate feature of my social self, a necessary feature of my social situation and my personal identity, and at the same time an aspect of my personal alienation in the natural environment"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From a [[Sociology|sociological]] perspective, '''social norms''' are informal understandings that govern the behavior of members of a society.&lt;ref name="marshall"&gt;Marshall, G. ''Oxford Dictionary of Sociology''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social psychology]] recognizes smaller group units, such as a team or an office, may also endorse norms separately or in addition to cultural or societal expectations.&lt;ref name="jackson"&gt;Jackson, J. (1965). "Structural characteristics of norms". In I.D. Steiner &amp; M. Fishbein (Eds.), ''Current studies in social psychology'' (pp. 301-309).&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, norms are regarded as collective representations of acceptable group conduct as well as individual perceptions of particular group conduct.&lt;ref name="lapinski &amp; rimal"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lapinski | first1 = M. K. | last2 = Rimal | first2 = R. N. | year = 2005 | title = An explication of social norms | url = | journal = Communication Theory | volume = 15 | issue = 2| pages = 127–147 | doi=10.1093/ct/15.2.127}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be viewed as cultural products (including values, customs, and traditions)&lt;ref name="shetif"&gt;Sherif, M. (1936). ''The psychology of social norms''. NewYork: Harper.&lt;/ref&gt; which represent individuals' basic knowledge of what others do and think that they should do.&lt;ref name="cialdini"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cialdini | first1 = R. D. | year = 2003 | title = Crafting normative messages to protect the environment | url = http://www.psychologicalscience.org/pdf/cialdini.pdf| journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 12 | issue = 4| pages = 105–109 | doi=10.1111/1467-8721.01242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, in the field of social psychology, the roles of norms are emphasized which can guide behavior in a certain situation or environment as "mental representations of appropriate behavior".&lt;ref name="aarts &amp; dijksterhuis/"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aarts | first1 = H. | last2 = Dijksterhuis | first2 = A. | year = 2003 | title = The silence of the library: Environment, situational norm, and social behavior | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 84 | issue = 1| pages = 18–28 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.84.1.18| pmid = 12518968 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it has been shown that normative messages can promote pro-social behavior, including decreasing alcohol use&lt;ref name="collins, carey, &amp; sliwinski"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Collins | first1 = S. E. | last2 = Carey | first2 = K. B. | last3 = Sliwinski | first3 = M. J. | year = 2002 | title = Mailed personalized normative feedback as a brief intervention for at-risk college drinkers | url = | journal = Journal of the Studies of Alcohol | volume = 63 | issue = 5| pages = 559–567 | doi=10.15288/jsa.2002.63.559}}&lt;/ref&gt; and increasing voter turnout.&lt;ref name="gerber &amp; rogers"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gerber | first1 = A. S. | last2 = Rogers | first2 = T. | year = 2009 | title = Descriptive social norms and motivation to vote: everybody's voting and so should you | url = | journal = The Journal of Politics | volume = 71 | issue = 1| pages = 178–191 | doi=10.1017/s0022381608090117| citeseerx = 10.1.1.691.37 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the psychological definition of social norms' behavioral component, norms have two dimensions: how much a behaviour is exhibited, and how much the group approves of that behavior.&lt;ref name="jackson" /&gt; Both of these dimensions can be used in normative messages to alter norms and subsequently alter behaviors; for example, a message can target the former dimension by describing high levels of voter turnout in order to encourage more turnout. At the same time, norms also can be changed contingent on the observed behavior of others (how much behavior is exhibited).

== Behavior  ==
Norms running counter to the behaviors of the overarching society or culture may be transmitted and maintained within small subgroups of society. For example, Crandall (1988) noted that certain groups (e.g., [[cheerleading]] squads, dance troupes, sports teams, sororities) have a rate of [[bulimia]], a publicly recognized life-threatening disease, that is much higher than society as a whole. Social norms have a way of maintaining order and organizing groups.&lt;ref name="haung"&gt;Haung, Peter, Wu, Ho-Mou. "More Order without More Law: A Theory of Social Norms and Organizational Cultures". (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social control ==
Although not considered to be formal laws within society, norms still work to promote a great deal of [[social control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Druzin|first=Bryan|title=Using Social Norms as a Substitute for Law|url=https://works.bepress.com/bryan_druzin/16/|journal=Albany Law Review|volume=78|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are statements that regulate conduct. The cultural phenomenon that is the norm is the prescriber of acceptable behavior in specific instances. Ranging in variations depending on culture, race, religion, and geographical location, it is the foundation of the terms some know acceptable as not to injure others, the golden rule, and to keep promises that have been pledged.&lt;ref&gt;Hechter, Michael et al., eds.. "Introduction". ''Social Norms''. Ed. Michael Hechter et al.. Russell Sage Foundation, 2001. xi–xx.&lt;/ref&gt; Without them, there would be a world without consensus, common ground, or restrictions. Even though the law and a state's legislation is not intended to control social norms, society and the law are inherently linked and one dictates the other. This is why it has been said that the language used in some legislation is controlling and dictating for what should or should not be accepted. For example, the criminalisation of familial sexual relations is said to protect those that are vulnerable, however even consenting adults cannot have sexual relationships with their relatives. The language surrounding these laws conveys the message that such acts are supposedly immoral and should be condemned, even though there is no actual victim in these consenting relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0964663913502068?legid=spsls%3B23%2F1%2F113&amp;patientinform-links=yes|title= The Synthetic Necessary Truth Behind New Labour's Criminalisation of Incest| doi=10.1177/0964663913502068 | volume=23|journal=Social &amp; Legal Studies|pages=113–130|year= 2013|last1= Roffee|first1= James A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social norms can be enforced formally (e.g., through sanctions) or informally (e.g., through [[body language]] and non-verbal communication cues.) Because individuals often derive physical or psychological resources from group membership, groups are said to control ''discretionary stimuli''; groups can withhold or give out more resources in response to members' adherence to group norms, effectively controlling member behavior through rewards and operant conditioning.&lt;ref name="hackman"&gt;Hackman, J.R. (1992). "Group influences on individuals in organizations". In M.D. Dunnette &amp; L.M. Hough (Eds.), ''Handbook of industrial and organizational psychology'' (Vol. 3). Palo Alto: Consulting Psychologists Press, 234-245.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social psychology]] research has found the more an individual values group-controlled resources or the more an individual sees group membership as central to his definition of self, the more likely he is to conform.&lt;ref name="hackman" /&gt; Social norms also allow an individual to assess what behaviors the group deems important to its existence or survival, since they represent a codification of belief; groups generally do not punish members or create norms over actions which they care little about.&lt;ref name="hackman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="feldman"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feldman | first1 = D.C. | year = 1984| title = The development and enforcement of group norms | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 47–55 | doi=10.2307/258231| jstor = 258231 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Norms in every culture create [[conformity]] that allows for people to become [[socialization|socialized]] to the culture in which they live.&lt;ref name="marshall" /&gt; 
 
As social beings, individuals learn when and where it is appropriate to say certain things, to use certain words, to discuss certain topics or wear certain clothes, and when it is not.  Thus, knowledge about [[cultural]] norms is important for [[wikt:impression|impression]]s,&lt;ref name="kamau"&gt;Kamau, C. (2009) Strategizing impression management in corporations: cultural knowledge as capital. In D. Harorimana (Ed) Cultural implications of knowledge sharing, management and transfer: identifying competitive advantage. Chapter 4. Information Science Reference. {{ISBN|978-1-60566-790-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is an individual's regulation of their nonverbal behavior.  One also comes to know through experience what types of people he/she can and cannot discuss certain topics with or wear certain types of dress around. Typically, this knowledge is derived through experience (i.e. social norms are learned through [[social interaction]]).&lt;ref name="kamau" /&gt; Wearing a suit to a job interview in order to give a great first impression represents a common example of a social norm in the [[White-collar worker|white collar work force]].

== Sociology ==
For [[Talcott Parsons]] of the [[Structural functionalism|functionalist]] school, norms dictate the interactions of people in all social encounters. On the other hand, [[Karl Marx]] believed that norms are used to promote the creation of [[role]]s in society which allows for people of different levels of [[social class]] structure to be able to function properly.&lt;ref name="marshall" /&gt; Marx claims that this power dynamic creates [[social order]].

[[Heinrich Popitz]] is convinced that the establishment of social norms, that make the future actions of alter foreseeable for ego, solves the problem of [[contingency (philosophy)|contingency]] ([[Niklas Luhmann]]). In this way, ego can count on those actions as if they would already have been performed and does not have to wait for their actual execution; social interaction is thus accelerated. Important factors in the standardization of behavior are sanctions&lt;ref&gt;See The International Handbook of Sociology, ed. by Stella R. Quah and Arnaud Sales, Sage 2000, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; and social roles.

== Emergence and transmission==
Rulemaking is one of the basic impulses humans have for organizing and simplifying actions. Everyday there are new rules put into place, as well as old rules that are more structured whether it be for a group or an individual. Yet, not only do humans make rules, they strive on finding the rules that come eye to eye about how the world works.&lt;ref&gt;Jasso, Guillermina. "RULE FINDING ABOUT RULE MAKING: COMPARISON PROCESSES AND THE MAKING OF RULES". ''Social Norms''. Ed. Michael Hechter and Karl-Dieter Opp. Russell Sage Foundation, 2001. 348–393.&lt;/ref&gt; These rules, once accepted by an individual or a group after trial and error, then become a norm.

Groups may adopt norms through a variety of ways. Norms can arise formally, where groups explicitly outline and implement behavioral expectations.  Laws or club rules serve as an example of this.&lt;ref name="kendall"&gt;Kendall, D. (2011) ''Sociology in our times''&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of these norms we follow 'naturally' such as driving on the right side of the road in the US and on the left side in the UK, or not speeding in order to avoid a ticket. Many formal norms serve to provide safety to the general public.

However, social norms are much more likely to develop informally, emerging gradually as a result of repeated use of discretionary stimuli to control behavior.&lt;ref name="hackman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chong"&gt;Chong, D. (2000) ''Rational lives: norms and values in politics and society''&lt;/ref&gt; Not necessarily laws set in writing, informal norms represent generally accepted and widely sanctioned routines that people follow in everyday life.&lt;ref name="gerber"&gt;Gerber, L. &amp; Macionis, J. (2011) ''Sociology'', 7th Canadian ed., p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; These informal norms, if broken, may not invite formal legal punishments or sanctions, but instead encourage reprimands, warnings, or [[othering]]; [[incest]], for example, is generally thought of as wrong in society, but many jurisdictions do not legally prohibit it.

===Transfer of norms between groups===
Individuals may also import norms from a previous organization to their new group, which can get adopted over time.&lt;ref name="feldman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bm"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bettenhausen | first1 = K. | last2 = Murnighan | first2 = J.K. | year = 1985 | title = The emergence of norms in competitive decision-making groups | url = | journal = Administrative Science Quarterly | volume = 30 | issue = 3| pages = 350–372 | doi=10.2307/2392667| jstor = 2392667 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Without a clear indication of how to act, people typically rely on their past history to determine the best course forward; what was successful before may serve them well again. In a group, individuals may all import different histories or [[Behavioral script|scripts]] about appropriate behaviors; common experience over time will lead the group to define as a whole its take on the right action, usually with the integration of several members' schemas.&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt; Under the importation paradigm, norm formation occurs subtly and swiftly&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt; whereas with formal or informal development of norms may take longer.

Groups internalize norms by accepting them as reasonable and proper standards for behaviour within the group. Once firmly established, a norm becomes a part of the group's operational structure and hence more difficult to change. While possible for newcomers to a group to change its norms, it is much more likely that the new individual will adopt the group's norms, values, and perspectives, rather than the other way around.&lt;ref name="hackman" /&gt;

== Deviance from social norms ==
[[File:Normal is a bad word.jpg|thumb|250px|"Normal is a bad word", a [[Graffiti|graffito]] in [[Ljubljana]], Slovenia]]
[[Deviance (sociology)|Deviance]] is defined as "nonconformity to a set of norms that are accepted by a significant number of people in a community or society."&lt;ref name="appelbaum"&gt;Appelbaum, R. P., Carr, D., Duneir, M., &amp; Giddens, A. (2009). "Confomity, Deviance, and Crime." Introduction to Sociology, New York, NY: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc., p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;  More simply put, if group members do not follow a norm, they become labeled as a deviant. In the sociological literature, this can often lead to them being considered outcasts of society. Yet, deviant behavior amongst children is somewhat expected. Except the idea of this deviance manifesting as a criminal action, the social tolerance given in the example of the child is quickly withdrawn against the criminal. Crime is considered one of the most extreme forms of deviancy according to scholar Clifford R. Shaw.&lt;ref&gt;Dobbert, Duane L., and Thomas X. Mackey. "Chapter 12: Clifford Shaw and Henry McKay." ''Deviance: Theories on Behaviors That Defy Social Norms''. N.p.: n.p., n.d. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; What is considered "normal" is relative to the location of the [[culture]] in which the [[social interaction]] is taking place.  In psychology, an individual who routinely disobeys group norms runs the risk of turning into the "institutionalized deviant." Similar to the sociological definition, institutionalized deviants may be judged by other group members for their failure to adhere to norms.  At first, group members may increase pressure on a non-conformist, attempting to engage the individual in conversation or explicate why he or she should follow their behavioral expectations. The role in which one decides on whether or not to behave is largely determined on how their actions will affect others.&lt;ref&gt;Drobak, John N. "1. The Role of Social Variables." ''Norms and the Law''. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2006. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Especially with new members who perhaps do not know any better, groups may use discretionary stimuli to bring an individual's behavior back into line. Over time, however, if a member continues to disobey, the group will give up on him as a lost cause; while the group may not necessarily revoke his membership, they may give him only superficial consideration.&lt;ref name="hackman" /&gt; If a worker is late to a meeting, for example, violating the office norm of punctuality, a boss or other co-worker may wait for the individual to arrive and pull him aside later to ask what happened. If the behavior continues, eventually the group may begin meetings without him since the individual "is always late."  The group generalizes the individual's disobedience and promptly dismisses it, thereby reducing the member's influence and footing in future group disagreements.

Group tolerance for deviation varies across membership; not all group members receive the same treatment for norm violations. Individuals may build up a "reserve" of good behavior through [[conformity]], which they can borrow against later.  These ''[[idiosyncrasy credit]]s'' provide a theoretical currency for understanding variations in group behavioral expectations.&lt;ref name="hollander"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hollander | first1 = E.P. | year = 1958 | title = Conformity, status, and idiosyncrasy credit | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 65 | issue = 2| pages = 117–127 | doi=10.1037/h0042501}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A teacher, for example, may more easily forgive a straight-A student for misbehaving—who has past "good credit" saved up—than a repeatedly disruptive student.  While past performance can help build idiosyncrasy credits, some group members have a higher balance to start with.&lt;ref name="hollander" /&gt; Individuals can import idiosyncrasy credits from another group; childhood movie stars, for example, who enroll in college, may experience more leeway in adopting school norms than other incoming freshmen.   Finally, [[leaders]] or individuals in other high-status positions may begin with more credits and be appear to be "above the rules" at times.&lt;ref name="hackman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hollander" /&gt; Even their idiosyncrasy credits are not bottomless, however; while held to a more lenient standard than the average member, leaders may still face group rejection if their disobedience becomes too extreme.

Deviance also causes multiple emotions one experiences when going against a norm. One of those emotions can be widely attributed to guilt. This emotion is connected to the ethics of duty which in turn becomes a primary object of moral obligation. Guilt is followed by an action that is questioned after its doing.&lt;ref&gt;Greenspan, Patricia S. "Chapter 4: Moral Residues." ''Practical Guilt: Moral Dilemmas, Emotions, and Social Norms''. N.p.: Oxford UP, 1995. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be described as something negative to the self as well as a negative state of feeling. Used in both instances, it is both an unpleasant feeling as well as a form of self-punishment. Using the metaphor of "dirty hands",&lt;ref&gt;Greenspan, Patricia S. "Chapter 6: Basing Ethics on Emotion." ''Practical Guilt: Moral Dilemmas, Emotions, and Social Norms''&lt;/ref&gt; it is the staining or tainting of oneself and therefore having to self cleanse away the filth. It is a form of reparation that confronts oneself as well as submitting to the possibility of anger and punishment from others. Guilt is a point in both action and feeling that acts as a stimulus for further "honorable" actions.

=== Operant conditioning ===
The probability of these actions that are committed are coined to [[B. F. Skinner]], that states that [[operant conditioning]] plays a role in the process of social norm. Operant conditioning is the increase that an action will occur again by increasing the reinforced response. This process is that of reward and punishment or trial and error. Hand in hand with deviance, the consequences of one’s behavior, whether positive or negative, will determine the probability of reoccurrence as well as the push towards regulating one’s decisions in the future. Containing five sub categories, this conditioning treatment is an influence in the actions one commits and the feelings one experiences afterwards. In the case of social deviance, an individual who has gone against a norm will feel the negative connotation that comes with defying the conditioning that was taught therefore indicating negative reinforcement.  A perfect example is that of a little girl painting on the wall of the house as she seeks her mother’s approval of her artistic work. When the child witnesses the mother putting her in a "time out", she realizes that if she were to paint on the wall again, it will lead to punishment therefore causing her to notice her negative reinforcement. Which then makes the probability of her painting the wall again, decrease immensely. He also states that humans are conditioned from a very young age on how to behave and how to act with those around us considering the outside influences of the society and location one is in.&lt;ref&gt;Dobbert, Duane L., and Thomas X. Mackey. "Chapter 9: B.F. Skinner." ''Deviance: Theories on Behaviors That Defy Social Norms''. N.p.: n.p., n.d. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Built to blend into the ambiance and attitude around us, deviance is a frowned upon action.

== Focus theory of normative conduct ==
[[Robert Cialdini|Cialdini]], Reno, and Kallgren developed the focus theory of normative conduct to describe how individuals implicitly juggle multiple behavioral expectations at once; expanding on conflicting prior beliefs about whether cultural, situational or personal norms motivate action, the researchers suggested the focus of an individual’s attention will dictate what behavioral expectation they follow.&lt;ref name="cialdini 1990"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cialdini | first1 = R.B. | last2 = Reno | first2 = R.R. | last3 = Kallgren | first3 = C.A. | year = 1990 | title = A focus theory of normative conduct: Recycling the concept of norms to reduce littering in public places | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 58 | issue = 6| pages = 1015–1026 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.58.6.1015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

===Descriptive versus injunctive===
Descriptive norms depict what happens, while injunctive norms describe what ''should'' happen. Cialdini, Reno, and Kallgren (1990) define a descriptive norm as people's perceptions of what is commonly done in specific situations; it signifies what most people do, without assigning judgment. The absence of trash on the ground in a parking lot, for example, transmits the descriptive norm that most people there do not [[litter]].&lt;ref name="cialdini 1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cialdini 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cialdini | first1 = R | year = 2007 | title = Descriptive social norms as underappreciated sources of social control | url = | journal = Psychometrika | volume = 72 | issue = 2| pages = 263–268 | doi=10.1007/s11336-006-1560-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Injunctive norm, on the other hand, transmits group approval about a particular behavior; it dictates how an individual ''should'' behave.&lt;ref name="cialdini 1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cialdini 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="schultz"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schultz | first1 = Nolan | last2 = Cialdini | first2 = Goldstein | last3 = Griskevicius | first3 =  | year = 2007 | title = The constructive, destructive, and reconstructive power of social norms | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 18 | issue = 5| pages = 429–434 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01917.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rivis"&gt;Rivis, Amanda, Sheeran, Paschal. "Descriptive Norms as an Additional Predictor in the Theory of Planned Behaviour: A Meta-Analysis". 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Watching another person pick up trash off the ground and throw it out, a group member may pick up on the injunctive norm that he ought to not litter.

===Prescriptive and proscriptive===
Prescriptive norms are unwritten rules that are understood and followed by society and indicate what we should do.&lt;ref name="wilson"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = K.L. | last2 = Lizzio | first2 = A.J. | last3 = Zauner | first3 = S. | last4 = Gallois | first4 = C. | year = 2001| title = Social rules for managing attempted interpersonal domination in the workplace: Influence of status and gender | url = | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 44 | issue = 3/4| pages = 129–154 | doi=10.1023/a:1010998802612}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Expressing gratitude or writing a Thank You card when someone gives you a gift represents a prescriptive norm in American culture. Proscriptive norms, in contrast, comprise the other end of the same spectrum; they are similarly society's unwritten rules about what one should not do.&lt;ref name="wilson" /&gt; These norms can vary between cultures; while an acceptable greeting in some European countries, kissing a stranger on the cheek constitutes a proscriptive norm in the United States.

===Subjective===
Subjective norm is determined by beliefs about the extent to which important others want them to perform a behavior. Social influences are conceptualized in terms of the pressure that people perceive from important others to perform, or not to perform, a behavior.&lt;ref name="rivis" /&gt;

== Mathematical representations ==
Over the last few decades, several theorists have attempted to explain social norms from a more theoretical point of view.  By quantifying behavioral expectations graphically or attempting to plot the logic behind adherence, theorists hoped to be able to predict whether or not individuals would conform. The return potential model and game theory provide a slightly more economic conceptualization of norms, suggesting individuals can calculate the cost or benefit behind possible behavioral outcomes. Under these theoretical frameworks, choosing to obey or violate norms becomes a more deliberate, quantifiable decision.

===Return potential model===
[[File:Return Potential Model, Jackson, 1965.jpeg|thumb|Figure 1. The return potential model (reproduced from Jackson, 1965).]]
Developed in the 1960s, the return potential model provides a method for plotting and visualizing group norms. In the regular coordinate plane, the amount of behavior exhibited is plotted on the X-axis (label ''a'' in [http://www.tau.ac.il/~toury/works/GT-Role-Norms.htm Figure 1]) while the amount of group acceptance or approval gets plotted on the Y-axis (''b'' in Figure 1).&lt;ref name="jackson"/&gt; The graph represents the potential return or positive outcome to an individual for a given behavioral norm.  Theoretically, one could plot a point for each increment of behavior how much the group likes or dislikes that action. For example, it may be the case that among first-year graduate students, strong social norms around how many daily cups of coffee you drink exist. If the return curve in Figure 1 correctly displays the example social norm, we can see that if someone drinks 0 cups of coffee a day, the group strongly disapproves. The group does not approve of member behavior until someone hits four cups of coffee a day; the graduate students (as represented by the return curve) find it excessive to drink more than seven cups, however, as the approval again dips below zero. As exhibited by the coffee example, the return potential model displays for each increment of behavior how much group approval one can anticipate.

:'''Point of maximum return.''' The point with the greatest y-coordinate is called the point of maximum return, as it represents the amount of behavior the group likes the best.&lt;ref name="jackson"/&gt; While ''c'' in Figure 1 is labeling the return curve in general, the highlighted point just above it at X=6, represents the point of maximum return. Extending our above example, the point of maximum return for first-year graduate students would be 6 cups of coffee; they receive the most social approval for drinking exactly that many cups.  Any more or any fewer cups would decrease the approval.

:'''Range of tolerable behavior.''' Label ''d'' represents the range of tolerable behavior, or the amount of action the group finds acceptable.&lt;ref name="jackson"/&gt; It encompasses all the positive area under the curve. In Figure 1, the range of tolerable behavior extends is 3, as the group approves of all behavior from 4 to 7 and 7-4=3. Carrying over our coffee example again, we can see that first-years only approve of having a limited number of cups of coffee (between 4 and 7); more than 7 cups or fewer than 4 would fall outside the range of tolerable behavior.  Norms can have a narrower or wider range of tolerable behavior. Typically, a narrower range of behavior indicates a behavior with greater consequences to the group.&lt;ref name="hackman"/&gt;

:'''Intensity.''' The intensity of the norm tells how much the group cares about the norm, or how much group affect is at stake to be won or lost.  It is represented in the return potential model by the total amount of area subsumed by the curve, regardless of whether the area is positive or negative.&lt;ref name="jackson"/&gt; A norm with low intensity would not vary far from the x-axis; the amount of approval or disapproval for given behaviors would be closer to zero. A high-intensity norm, however, would have more extreme approval ratings. In Figure 1, the intensity of the norm appears high, as few behaviors invoke a rating of indifference.

:'''Crystallization.''' Finally, norm crystallization refers to how much variance exists within the curve; translated from the theoretical back to the actual norm, it shows how much agreement exists between group members about the approval for a given amount of behavior.&lt;ref name="jackson" /&gt; It may be that some members believe the norm more central to group functioning than others. A group norm like how many cups of coffee first years should drink would probably have low crystallization, since a lot of individuals have varying beliefs about the appropriate amount of caffeine to imbibe; in contrast, the norm of not plagiarizing another student's work would likely have high crystallization, as people uniformly agree on the behavior's unacceptability. Showing the overall group norm, the return potential model in Figure 1 does not indicate the crystallization. However, a return potential model that plotted individual data points alongside the cumulative norm could demonstrate the variance and allow us to deduce crystallization.

===Game theory===
{{Main|Game theory}}
Another general formal framework that can be used to represent the essential elements of the social situation surrounding a norm is the [[repeated game]] of game theory. Rational choice, a branch of game theory, deals with the relations and actions socially committed among rational agents.&lt;ref&gt;Voss, Thomas. Game-Theoretical Perspectives on the Emergence of Social Norms. Social Norms, 2001, p.105.&lt;/ref&gt; A norm gives a person a [[rule of thumb]] for how they should behave. However, a [[rationality|rational]] person only acts according to the rule if it is optimal for them. The situation can be described as follows. A norm gives an [[Expectation (epistemic)|expectation]] of how other people act in a given situation (macro). A person acts optimally given the expectation (micro). For a norm to be [[Structural stability|stable]], people's actions must reconstitute the expectation without change (micro-macro feedback loop). A set of such correct stable expectations is known as a [[Nash equilibrium]]. Thus, a stable norm must constitute a Nash equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cristina Bicchieri|Bicchieri, Cristina]]. 2006. The Grammar of Society: The Nature and Dynamics of Social Norms, New York: Cambridge University Press, Ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt; In the Nash equilibrium, no one actor has any positive incentive in individually deviating from a certain action.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Social norms will be implemented if the actions of that specific norm come into agreement by the support of the Nash equilibrium in the majority of the game theoretical approaches.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Voss 2001, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

From a game-theoretical point of view, there are two [[explanation]]s for the vast variety of norms that exist throughout the world. One is the difference in games. Different parts of the world may give different environmental contexts and different people may have different values, which may result in a difference in games. The other is [[equilibrium selection]] not explicable by the game itself. Equilibrium selection is closely related to [[Coordination game|coordination]]. For a simple example, driving is common throughout the world, but in some countries people drive on the right and in other countries people drive on the left (see [[coordination game]]). A framework called comparative [[institutional analysis]] is proposed to deal with the game theoretical structural understanding of the variety of social norms.

'''The Tanster''' is an American artist in the [[Hamptons]] on the East End of [[Long Island]] in [[New York State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Street Art|url=http://paintingthehamptons.blogspot.com/2015/01/street-art.html|website=Painting the Hamptons|publisher=Gail Gallagher|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She began installing public art works in the community in the late Summer of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Reilly|first1=Brendan|title=Another Guerilla Artist Posts Art Across The Hamptons|url=http://www.danspapers.com/2014/10/another-guerilla-artist-posts-art-across-the-hamptons/|issue=10.2.14|publisher=Dan's Papers|date=October 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her project was named as one the top 10 artistic events in 2014 by the cultural magazine ''[[Dan's Papers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Peterson|first1=Oliver|title=Top 10 Hamptons Art Moments of 2014|url=http://www.danspapers.com/2014/12/top-10-hamptons-art-moments-of-2014/|publisher=Dan's Papers|accessdate=December 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tanster has partnered with a local charity, the Coalition For Women's Cancers at [[Southampton Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Segal|first1=Mark|title="Tanster" Pays It Forward For Women's Cancers|url=http://easthamptonstar.com/Arts/2015305/Tanster-Pays-It-Forward-Womens-Cancers|accessdate=March 5, 2015|publisher=The East Hampton Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each piece of pop up art that The Tanster installs includes donation information for the Coalition. People are encouraged to take the art when they find it. On the back of it is a request for donations and a guide on how people can help.&lt;ref name="east1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Melillo|first1=Alyssa|title=They Call Her 'The Tanster,' And She's on a Rainbow-Filled Mission|url=http://www.27east.com/news/article.cfm/East-End/102797/They-Call-Her-The-Tanster-And-Shes-On-A-Rainbow-Filled-Mission|accessdate=April 14, 2015|publisher=Southampton Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tanster has received corporate sponsorships for her project, including contributions from Home Depot, Rust-Oleum and Meineke.&lt;ref name="east1"/&gt;

==Biography==
The Tanster was born in Southampton Hospital in [[Southampton, New York]], United States and attended Southampton High School. She graduated [[Magna Cum Laude]] from [[Stony Brook University]] and has a master's degree in video production from the [[New York Institute of Technology]]. For a year she lived in Paris, France, studying art history at the [[Sorbonne]]. Her photographs have been published in magazines all over the world and her celebrity photography is currently managed by [[Getty Images]]. She began installing pop up public art in the Hamptons in August 2014.&lt;ref name="east1"/&gt;

==Technique==
The primary style of The Tanster public art installations involves repurposed yard signs spray painted in rainbow palettes. Oftentimes the pieces include original stencils. The yard signs which serve as her canvases are typically plastic rectangles. The Tanster creates her works in a studio in Water Mill, New York and then places them out in the public, either mounted on metal frames or stapled with wire to posts. She also paints, tie dyes, sews and makes videos.

==Podcast media==
In February 2016, The Tanster was interviewed on [[iHeart Radio]]'s Savvy Central channel by Christina Nitschmann. During the interview, The Tanster discussed a variety of topics, including both the origins of her charity rainbow street art project and how she became interested in [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBOCpxkHMKk |title=Artist 'The Tanster' &amp; Steve Lubetkin The Power of Podcasting |publisher=YouTube |date=February 21, 2016 |accessdate=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July of 2018, The Tanster did a wide ranging, two part interview on The Scott Johnson Radio Show on the Building Fortunes Radio Network. The topics covered included her ongoing, multi-media art project which she characterized as a [[Hero's Journey]] partially inspired by [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]]. During the interview, Tanster also discussed her efforts to highlight the statements of Ben Szemkus, an eyewitness whose story links the allegedly sadistic [[NXIVM]] sex cult and certain political elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Scott Johnson Radio Show|url=http://www.buildingfortunesradio.com/scott-johnson-peter-mingils/scott-johnson-bring-the-tanster-on-building-fortunes-radio-to-talk-about-ben-szemkus-and-nxivms-keith-raniere-allison-mack-meeting-with-cohost-peter-mingils-2053|website=Building Fortunes Radio Network|publisher=PM Marketing LLC|accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
Tanster is currently using her artistic talents and her industry to promote public awareness of the elicit behaviors of corrupt institutions and private groups. Her blog is a center of information regarding various topics of public concern. Tanster was featured on Neon Nettle as a source about the persecution that NXIVM whistleblower Ben Szemkus was facing for coming forward with his story. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neon Nettle|url=https://neonnettle.com/news/4626-whistleblower-who-exposed-hillary-clinton-s-child-trafficking-ties-feared-dead|website=Neon Nettle|accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TheTwoCultures.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Oxford University Press|OUP]])]]
'''''The Two Cultures''''' is the first part of an influential 1959 [[Rede Lecture]] by [[United Kingdom|British]] scientist and novelist [[C. P. Snow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Snow| first= Charles Percy | title = The Two Cultures |year=2001 | origyear = 1959 |publisher=Cambridge University Press| location= London | isbn = 978-0-521-45730-9 | page= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = TLS /&gt; Its thesis was that "the intellectual life of the whole of western society" was split into the titular two cultures – namely the [[science]]s and the [[humanities]] – and that this was a major hindrance to solving the world's problems.

'''''The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution''''' (1959) was a published version of the lectures in book form. 

==The lecture==
The talk was delivered 7 May 1959 in the [[Senate House (University of Cambridge)|Senate House]], Cambridge, and subsequently published as ''The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution''. The lecture and book expanded upon an article by Snow published in the ''[[New Statesman]]'' of 6 October 1956, also entitled ''The Two Cultures''.{{Sfn | Snow | 2013}}  Published in book form, Snow's lecture was widely read and discussed on both sides of the Atlantic, leading him to write a 1963 follow-up, ''The Two Cultures: And a Second Look: An Expanded Version of The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Two Cultures: And a Second Look: An Expanded Version of The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution |last=Snow |first=Charles Percy |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year= 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snow's position can be summed up by an often-repeated part of the essay:
{{Quote |A good many times I have been present at gatherings of people who, by the standards of the traditional culture, are thought highly educated and who have with considerable gusto been expressing their incredulity at the illiteracy of scientists. Once or twice I have been provoked and have asked the company how many of them could describe the [[Second Law of Thermodynamics]]. The response was cold: it was also negative. Yet I was asking something which is the scientific equivalent of: ''Have you read a work of [[Shakespeare]]'s?''&lt;ref name= Nature&gt;{{cite journal |title=Across the Great Divide |journal=Nature Physics |year=2009 |volume=5 |issue=5 |page=309 |url = http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v5/n5/full/nphys1258.html |doi= 10.1038/nphys1258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I now believe that if I had asked an even simpler question – such as, What do you mean by [[mass]], or [[acceleration]], which is the scientific equivalent of saying, ''Can you read?'' – not more than one in ten of the highly educated would have felt that I was speaking the same language. So the great edifice of modern [[physics]] goes up, and the majority of the cleverest people in the [[western world]] have about as much insight into it as their [[neolithic]] ancestors would have had.&lt;ref name=Nature /&gt;}}

In 2008, ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' included ''The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution'' in its list of the 100 books that most influenced Western public discourse since the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name = TLS&gt;{{cite news| url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article5418361.ece | location = London | work= The Times | title= The hundred most influential books since the war | date=30 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snow's Rede Lecture condemned the [[British education]]al system as having, since the [[Victorian era]], over-rewarded the humanities (especially [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]) at the expense of scientific and [[engineering]] education, despite such achievements having been so decisive in winning the [[Second World War]] for the Allies.&lt;ref name=Jardine&gt;{{cite journal | title = CP Snow's Two Cultures Revisited | last = Jardine | first = Lisa | authorlink = Lisa Jardine | journal = Christ's College Magazine | year = 2010 | pages = 48–57 | format = PDF | url = http://www.christs.cam.ac.uk/cms_misc/media/Publications_Christs_Magazine_2010_web.pdf | accessdate = 2012-02-13 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120417151018/http://www.christs.cam.ac.uk/cms_misc/media/Publications_Christs_Magazine_2010_web.pdf | archivedate = 17 April 2012 | df = dmy-all }} Jardine's 2009 C. P. Snow Lecture honored the 50th anniversary of Snow's Rede Lecture. She places Snow's lecture into its historical context, and emphasizes the expansion of certain elements of the Rede Lecture in Snow's Godkin Lectures at Harvard University in 1960. These were ultimately published as {{cite book |title = Science and Government |publisher=New American Library |year=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in practice deprived British [[elite]]s (in politics, administration, and industry) of adequate preparation to manage the modern scientific world. By contrast, Snow said, [[German education|German]] and [[American schools]] sought to prepare their citizens equally in the sciences and humanities, and better scientific teaching enabled these countries' rulers to compete more effectively in a scientific age. Later discussion of ''The Two Cultures'' tended to obscure Snow's initial focus on differences between British systems (of both schooling and [[social class]]) and those of competing countries.&lt;ref name=Jardine /&gt;

== Implications and influence ==
The literary critic [[F. R. Leavis]] called Snow a "public relations man" for the scientific establishment in his essay ''Two Cultures?: The Significance of C. P. Snow'', published in ''[[The Spectator]]''.  The article attracted a great deal of negative correspondence in the magazine's letters pages.&lt;ref name=kimball&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kimball |first=Roger |url = http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/-The-Two-Cultures--today-4882 |title=The Two Cultures' today: On the C. P. Snow–F. R. Leavis controversy | journal=[[The New Criterion]] |date=12 February 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1963 book Snow appeared to revise his thinking and was more optimistic about the potential of a mediating third culture.  This concept was later picked up in {{Citation | year = 1995 | title = The Third Culture: Beyond the Scientific Revolution | author-link = John Brockman (literary agent)| first = John | last = Brockman| title-link = The Third Culture: Beyond the Scientific Revolution }}. Introducing the reprinted {{Citation | title = The Two Cultures | year = 1993}}, [[Stefan Collini]]{{Sfn | Collini | 1993 | p = lv}} has argued that the passage of time has done much to reduce the cultural divide Snow noticed, but has not removed it entirely.

[[Stephen Jay Gould]]'s ''[[The Hedgehog, the Fox, and the Magister's Pox]]'' provides a different perspective. Assuming the [[dialectical]] interpretation, it argues that Snow's concept of "two cultures" is not only off the mark, it is a damaging and short-sighted viewpoint, and that it has perhaps led to decades of unnecessary fence-building.

[[Simon Critchley]], in ''Continental Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction'' suggests:{{Sfn | Critchley | 2001 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=syhsLJ1eMOEC&amp;pg=PA49  49]}}
{{Quote |[Snow] diagnosed the loss of a common culture and the emergence of two distinct cultures: those represented by scientists on the one hand and those Snow termed 'literary intellectuals' on the other. If the former are in favour of social reform and progress through science, technology and industry, then intellectuals are what Snow terms 'natural [[Luddites]]' in their understanding of and sympathy for advanced industrial society. In [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]]'s terms, the division is between [[Jeremy Bentham|Benthamites]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridgeans]].|Simon Critchley}}

That is, Critchley argues that what Snow said represents a resurfacing of a discussion current in the mid-nineteenth century. Critchley describes the Leavis contribution to the making of a controversy as "a vicious ''ad hominem'' attack"; going on to describe the debate as "a familiar clash in English cultural history" citing also [[T. H. Huxley]] and [[Matthew Arnold]].{{Sfn | Critchley | 2001 | p = 51}}{{Sfn | Collini | 1993 | p = xxxv}}

In his opening address at the [[Munich Security Conference]] in January 2014, the Estonian president [[Toomas Hendrik Ilves]] said that the current problems related to security and freedom in cyberspace are the culmination of absence of dialogue between "the two cultures": "Today, bereft of understanding of fundamental issues and writings in the development of liberal democracy, computer geeks devise ever better ways to track people... simply because they can and it's cool. Humanists on the other hand do not understand the underlying technology and are convinced, for example, that tracking meta-data means the government reads their emails."&lt;ref&gt;Ilves, Toomas Hendrik: "[http://www.president.ee/en/official-duties/speeches/9796-qrebooting-trust-freedom-vs-security-in-cyberspaceq/index.html Rebooting Trust? Freedom vs Security in Cyberspace] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223112412/http://www.president.ee/en/official-duties/speeches/9796-qrebooting-trust-freedom-vs-security-in-cyberspaceq/index.html |date=23 February 2014 }}" Opening address at Munich Security Conference Cyber 31 January 2014. 31.01.2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antecedents==
Contrasting scientific and humanistic knowledge is a repetition of the ''[[Methodenstreit]]'' of 1890 German universities.&lt;ref name="Brint2002p212"&gt;{{Citation | last = Brint | first = Steven G | year = 2002 | title = The Future of the City of Intellect: The Changing American University | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TDfrzER0obYC&amp;pg=PA212 | pages = 212–3 | quote = positivism-versus-interpretation language [...] these fractal distinctions are generally quite old. Most of them have been around at least since the celebrated ''Methodenstreit'' of the German universities in the late nineteenth century. CP Snow's "two cultures" argument captures a later instantiation of them. [...] In negotiating the complexities of social scientific and humanistic knowledge, it is extremely helpful to have a dichotomy like positivism versus interpretation, because it saves our having to remember the exact degree of positivism of any scholarly group. [...] Every single social science discipline has internal debates about positivism/interpretation, narrative/analysis, and so on. The narrative/analytic debate may look very different in economics, anthropology, and English. But underneath all the surface differences it is quite similar.| isbn = 9780804745314 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A quarrel in 1911 between [[Benedetto Croce]] and [[Giovanni Gentile]] on the one hand and [[Federigo Enriques]] on the other one [https://books.google.it/books?id=oXjMYIonXTYC&amp;pg=PA422&amp;lpg=PA422&amp;dq=1911+croce+gentile+enriques+fight&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=y-I3OzBiJi&amp;sig=KYsoohR9-x53CW8pBXJbYflTqGU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjzrcu80JDeAhWKk4sKHUdaCgEQ6AEwD3oECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false is believed] to have had enduring effects in the separation of the two cultures in Italy and to the predominance of the views of (objective) idealism over those of (logical) positivism. In the social sciences it is also commonly proposed as the quarrel of [[positivism]] versus [[Antipositivism|interpretivism]].&lt;ref name="Brint2002p212" /&gt;

{{Evolutionary biology}}
The '''theoretical foundations of evolutionary psychology''' are the general and specific scientific theories that explain the ultimate origins of psychological traits in terms of [[evolution]]. These theories originated with [[Charles Darwin]]'s work, including his speculations about the evolutionary origins of social instincts in humans. Modern [[evolutionary psychology]], however, is possible only because of advances in evolutionary theory in the 20th century.

Evolutionary psychologists say that [[natural selection]] has provided humans with many [[psychological adaptation]]s, in much the same way that it generated humans' anatomical and physiological adaptations.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; As with adaptations in general, psychological adaptations are said to be specialized for the environment in which an organism evolved, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness, or EEA.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also "Environment of evolutionary adaptation," a variation of the term used in Economics, e.g., in Rubin, Paul H., 2003, ''"Folk economics"'' Southern Economic Journal, 70:1, July 2003, 157-171.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexual selection]] provides organisms with adaptations related to mating.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; For male [[mammal]]s, which have a relatively fast reproduction rate, sexual selection leads to adaptations that help them compete for females.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; For female mammals, with a relatively slow reproduction rate, sexual selection leads to choosiness, which helps females select higher quality mates.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Charles Darwin described both natural selection and sexual selection, but he relied on group selection to explain the evolution of self-sacrificing behavior. Group selection is a weak explanation because in any group the less self-sacrificing animals will be more likely to survive and the group will become less self-sacrificing.

In 1964, [[W.D. Hamilton|William D. Hamilton]] proposed [[inclusive fitness]] theory, emphasizing a "[[gene-centered view of evolution|gene's-eye]]" view of evolution. Hamilton noted that individuals can increase the replication of their genes into the next generation by helping close relatives with whom they share genes survive and reproduce. According to "[[Hamilton's rule]]", a self-sacrificing behavior can evolve if it helps close relatives so much that it more than compensates for the individual animal's sacrifice. Inclusive fitness theory resolved the issue of how "altruism" evolved. Other theories also help explain the evolution of altruistic behavior, including [[evolutionary game theory]], [[tit-for-tat]] reciprocity, and generalized reciprocity. These theories not only help explain the development of altruistic behavior but also account for hostility toward cheaters (individuals that take advantage of others' altruism).&lt;ref name = "moralanimal"/&gt;

Several mid-level evolutionary theories inform evolutionary psychology. The [[r/K selection]] theory proposes that some species prosper by having many offspring while others follow the strategy of having fewer offspring but investing much more in each one. Humans follow the second strategy. [[Parental investment]] theory explains how parents invest more or less in individual offspring based on how successful those offspring are likely to be, and thus how much they might improve the parents' inclusive fitness. According to the [[Trivers-Willard hypothesis]], parents in good conditions tend to invest more in sons (who are best able to take advantage of good conditions), while parents in poor conditions tend to invest more in daughters (who are best able to have successful offspring even in poor conditions). According to [[life history theory]], animals evolve life histories to match their environments, determining details such as age at first reproduction and number of offspring. [[Dual inheritance theory]] posits that genes and human culture have interacted, with genes affecting the development of culture and culture, in turn, affecting human evolution on a genetic level (see also the [[Baldwin effect]]).

[[Criticism of evolutionary psychology|Critics of evolutionary psychology]] have sometimes challenged its theoretical underpinnings, saying that humans never developed powerful social instincts through natural selection and that the hypotheses of evolutionary psychologists are merely just-so-stories.

==General evolutionary theory==
{{Main|Evolution}}
Evolutionary psychology primarily uses the theories of natural selection, sexual selection, and inclusive fitness to explain the evolution of psychological adaptations.

Evolutionary psychology is sometimes seen not simply as a subdiscipline of psychology but as a metatheoretical framework in which ''the entire field of psychology can be examined.''&lt;ref name="Cosmides"&gt;{{cite web |last=Cosmides |first=L |authorlink=Leda Cosmides |author2=Tooby J |authorlink2=John Tooby  |date=1997-01-13 |url=http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/research/cep/primer.html |title= Evolutionary Psychology: A Primer |accessdate=2008-02-16 |publisher=Center for Evolutionary Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural selection===
{{Main|Natural selection}}
Evolutionary psychologists consider Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection to be important to an understanding of psychology.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"&gt;Gaulin, Steven J. C. and Donald H. McBurney. Evolutionary Psychology. Prentice Hall. 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-13-111529-3}}, Chapter 2, “Natural Selection,” p 25-56.&lt;/ref&gt; Natural selection occurs because individual organisms who are genetically better suited to the current environment leave more descendants, and their genes spread through the population, thus explaining why organisms fit their environments so closely.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; This process is slow and cumulative, with new traits layered over older traits.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; The advantages created by natural selection are known as adaptations.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Evolutionary psychologists say that animals, just as they evolve physical adaptations, evolve psychological adaptations.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt;

Evolutionary psychologists emphasize that natural selection mostly generates specialized adaptations, which are more efficient than general adaptations.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; They point out that natural selection operates slowly, and that adaptations are sometimes out of date when the environment changes rapidly.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; In the case of humans, evolutionary psychologists say that much of human nature was shaped during the stone age and may not match the contemporary environment.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt;

===Sexual selection===
{{Main|Sexual selection}}
Sexual selection favors traits that provide mating advantages, such as the peacock's tail, even if these same traits are usually hindrances.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Evolutionary psychologists point out that, unlike natural selection, sexual selection typically leads to the evolution of sex differences.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"&gt;Gaulin, Steven J. C. and Donald H. McBurney. Evolutionary Psychology. Prentice Hall. 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-13-111529-3}}, Chapter 2, “Natural Selection,” p 25-56.&lt;/ref&gt; Sex differences typically make reproduction faster for one sex and slower for the other, in which case mates are relatively scarce for the faster sex.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Sexual selection favors traits that increase the number of mates for the fast sex and the quality of mates for the slow sex.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; For mammals, the female has the slower reproduction rate.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Males typically evolve either traits to help them fight other males or traits to impress females.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Females typically evolve greater abilities to discern the qualities of males, such as choosiness in mating.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt;

===Inclusive fitness===
[[Inclusive fitness]] theory, proposed by [[W.D. Hamilton|William D. Hamilton]], emphasized a "[[Gene-centered view of evolution|gene's-eye]]" view of evolution.  Hamilton noted that what evolution ultimately selects are genes, not groups or species.  From this perspective, individuals can increase the replication of their genes into the next generation not only directly via reproduction, by also indirectly helping close relatives with whom they share genes survive and reproduce.   General evolutionary theory, in its modern form, ''is'' essentially inclusive fitness theory.

Inclusive fitness theory resolved the issue of how "altruism" evolved. The dominant, pre-Hamiltonian view was that altruism evolved via [[group selection]]: the notion that altruism evolved for the benefit of the group. The problem with this was that if one organism in a group incurred any fitness costs on itself for the benefit of others in the group, (i.e. acted "altruistically"), then that organism would reduce its own ability to survive and/or reproduce, therefore reducing its chances of passing on its altruistic traits.

Furthermore, the organism that benefited from that altruistic act and only acted on behalf of its own fitness would increase its own chance of survival and/or reproduction, thus increasing its chances of passing on its "selfish" traits.
Inclusive fitness resolved "the problem of altruism" by demonstrating that altruism can evolve via kin selection as expressed in [[Hamilton's rule]]:
&lt;center&gt;cost &amp;lt; relatedness × benefit&lt;/center&gt;
In other words, altruism can evolve as long as the fitness ''cost'' of the altruistic act on the part of the actor is less than the ''degree of genetic relatedness'' of the recipient times the fitness ''benefit'' to that recipient.
This perspective reflects what is referred to as the [[gene-centered view of evolution]] and demonstrates that group selection is a very weak selective force.

Organisms can evolve physical and mental traits designed specifically to attract mates (e.g., the Peacock's tail) or to compete with members of one's own sex for access to the opposite sex (e.g., antlers).

| [[W.D. Hamilton]] (1964)
| '''''[[Inclusive fitness]] (or "gene's eye view", "kin selection") / Evolution of sexual reproduction'''''&lt;ref name="moralanimal"/&gt;

Selection occurs most robustly at the level of the gene, not the individual, group, or species. Reproductive success can thus be indirect, via shared genes in kin. Being altruistic toward kin can thus have genetic payoffs. (Also see [[Gene-centered view of evolution]])
Also, Hamilton argued that sexual reproduction evolved primarily as a defense against pathogens (bacteria and viruses) to "shuffle genes" to create greater diversity, especially immunological variability, in offspring.
| Altruism toward kin, parental investment, the behavior of the social insects with sterile workers (e.g., ants).

| [[Robert Trivers]] (1972)
| '''''[[Parental Investment]] Theory / Parent - Offspring Conflict / Reproductive Value'''''&lt;ref name="moralanimal"/&gt;

The two sexes often have conflicting strategies regarding how much to invest in offspring, and how many offspring to have. Parents allocate more resources to their offspring with higher reproductive value (e.g., "mom always liked you best"). Parents and offspring may have conflicting interests (e.g., when to wean, allocation of resources among offspring, etc.)

| '''''Game Theory / [[Evolutionary Game Theory]]'''''&lt;ref name="moralanimal"/&gt;

Organisms adapt, or respond, to competitors depending on the strategies used by competitors. Strategies are evaluated by the probable payoffs of alternatives. In a population, this typically results in an "evolutionary stable strategy," or "evolutionary stable equilibrium"—strategies that, on average, cannot be bettered by alternative strategies.
| Facultative, or frequency-dependent, adaptations. Examples: [[Chicken (game)#Hawk-Dove|hawks vs. doves]], cooperate vs. defect, fast vs. coy courtship, etc.

| How to maintain mutually beneficial relationships with non-kin in repeated interactions?
| [[Robert Trivers]] (1971)
| '''''"[[Tit for Tat]]" Reciprocity'''''&lt;ref name="moralanimal"/&gt;

A specific game strategy (see above) that has been shown to be optimal in achieving an evolutionary stable equilibrium in situations of repeated social interactions. One plays nice with non-kin if a mutually beneficially reciprocal relationship is maintained across multiple interactions, while cheating is punished.
| Cheater detection, emotions of revenge and guilt, etc.
|-
| Non-kin, large groups governed by rules and laws
| How to maintain mutually beneficial relationships with strangers with whom one may interact only once?
| [[Herbert Gintis]] (2000, 2003) and others
| '''''[[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)#Patterns of reciprocity|Generalized Reciprocity]]'''''

(Also called "strong reciprocity"). One can play nice with non-kin strangers even in single interactions if social rules against cheating are maintained by neutral third parties (e.g., other individuals, governments, institutions, etc.), a majority group members cooperate by generally adhering to social rules, and social interactions create a positive sum game (i.e., a bigger overall "pie" results from group cooperation).

Generalized reciprocity may be a set of adaptations that were designed for small in-group cohesion during times of high intertribal warfare with out-groups.

Today the capacity to be altruistic to in-group strangers may result from a serendipitous generalization (or "mismatch") between ancestral tribal living in small groups and today's large societies that entail many single interactions with strangers. (The dark side of generalized reciprocity may be that these adaptations may also underlie aggression toward out-groups.)

==Middle-level evolutionary theories==
Middle-level evolutionary theories are consistent with general evolutionary theory, but focus on certain domains of functioning (Buss, 2011)&lt;ref&gt;Buss, D.M. (2011). Evolutionary Psychology. NY: Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;  Specific evolutionary psychology hypotheses may be derivative from a mid-level theory (Buss, 2011).   Three very important middle-level evolutionary theories were contributed by [[Robert Trivers]] as well as [[Robert MacArthur]] and [[E. O. Wilson]]&lt;ref name="Pianka, E.R 1970"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trivers|first=Robert L.|title=The evolution of reciprocal altruism|journal=Quarterly Review of Biology|volume=46|issue=1|pages=35–57|date=March 1971|doi=10.1086/406755|jstor=2822435}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last=Trivers|first=Robert L.|chapter=Parental investment and sexual selection|editor=Bernard Campbell|title=Sexual selection and the descent of man, 1871-1971|pages=136–179|publisher=Aldine Transaction (Chicago)|date=1972|isbn=0-202-02005-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|last=Trivers|first=Robert L.|title=Parent-offspring conflict|volume=14|issue=1|pages=249–264|date=1974|doi=10.1093/icb/14.1.249|publisher=The Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology|journal=American Zoologist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The theory of '''[[parent-offspring conflict]]''' rests on the fact that even though a parent and his/her offspring are 50% genetically related, they are also 50% genetically different. All things being equal, a parent would want to allocate their resources equally amongst their offspring, while each offspring may want a little more for themselves. Furthermore, an offspring may want a little more resources from the parent than the parent is willing to give. In essence, parent-offspring conflict refers to ''a conflict of adaptive interests'' between parent and offspring. However, if all things are not equal, a parent may engage in discriminative investment towards one sex or the other, depending on the ''parent's'' condition.
*The '''[[Trivers–Willard hypothesis]]''', which proposes that parents will invest more in the sex that gives them the greatest reproductive payoff (grandchildren) with increasing or marginal investment. Females are the heavier parental investors in our species. Because of that, females have a better chance of reproducing at least once in comparison to males, but males in good condition have a better chance of producing high numbers of offspring than do females in good condition. Thus, according to the [[Trivers–Willard hypothesis]], parents in good condition are predicted to favor investment in sons, and parents in poor condition are predicted to favor investment in daughters.
*'''[[r/K selection theory]]''',&lt;ref name="Pianka, E.R 1970"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pianka | first1 = E.R. | authorlink = Eric Pianka | date = 1970 | title = On r and K selection | journal = American Naturalist | volume = 104 | issue = 940| pages = 592–597 | doi = 10.1086/282697 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which, in [[ecology]], relates to the selection of traits in organisms that allow success in particular environments. [[r-selected]] species, i.e., species in unstable or unpredictable environments, produce many offspring, each of which is unlikely to survive to adulthood. By contrast, [[K-selected]] species, i.e., species in stable or predictable environments, invest more heavily in fewer offspring, each of which has a better chance of surviving to adulthood.
*'''[[Life history theory]]''' posits that the schedule and duration of key events in an organism's lifetime are shaped by natural selection to produce the largest possible number of surviving offspring.  For any given individual, available resources in any particular environment are finite. Time, effort, and energy used for one purpose diminishes the time, effort, and energy available for another. Examples of some major life history characteristics include: age at first reproductive event, reproductive lifespan and aging, and number and size of offspring. Variations in these characteristics reflect different allocations of an individual's resources (i.e., time, effort, and energy expenditure) to competing life functions. For example, [[attachment theory]] proposes that caregiver attentiveness in early childhood can determine later [[Attachment in adults|adult attachment style]]. Also, [[Jay Belsky]] and others have found evidence that if the father is absent from the home, girls reach first menstruation earlier and also have more short term sexual relationships as women.&lt;ref&gt;Buss, D. (2011).  Evolutionary Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt;

The values that a person holds may be personal or political depending on whether they are considered in relation to the individual or to society.&lt;ref&gt;Mason E. ''Value Pluralism'', 2006 (ed. Zalta E.N. ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', 2018); ''cf''. Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, pp.7ff&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from moral virtue, examples of personal values include friendship, knowledge, beauty etc. and examples of political values, justice, equality and liberty. This article will outline some current ideas relating to the first group - personal values. It will begin by looking at the kinds of thing that have value and finish with a look at some of the theories that attempt to describe what value is.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman M.J. ''Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Value'', 2002 (ed. Zalta E.N. ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;  Reference will be made solely to Western sources although it is recognised that many, if not all, of the values discussed may be universal.

==Introduction==

It is only in the last hundred years or so that the subject of value has become a subject of study in its own right. A new field of enquiry called “[[axiology]]” (from the Greek ''axios'' meaning “worth”), defined as “the philosophical study of goodness or value”, began to emerge at around the beginning of the twentieth century, and its significance lay in extending the scope of the term “value” into fields other than traditional [[Value (ethics)|ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Ex.Brit. s.v. ''Axiology''&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hermann Lotze|R.H.Lotze]], [[Franz Brentano|F.Brentano]] and [[G. E. Moore|G.E.Moore]] have been cited as early proponents of the subject, and to Moore is attributed the important distinction made between [[Instrumental and intrinsic value|intrinsic and instrumental value]], that is, between things that have value in themselves and things that might lead to something of value.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''; cf. Schroeder ''Op.cit''.5&lt;/ref&gt; 

Examples of recent articles which introduce the subject include Mark Schroeder’s ''Value Theory'',&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder M. ''Value Theory'', 2008 (ed. Zalta E.N. ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;  Elinor Mason’s ''Value Pluralism''&lt;ref&gt;Mason ''Op.cit''.1&lt;/ref&gt;  and Michael Zimmerman’s ''Intrinsic and Extrinsic Value''.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.2&lt;/ref&gt; Schroeder defines axiology as being “primarily concerned with classifying what things are good”, and, in accepting that there might be a number of things that can be valued or called good, he asks is there, underlying these, just one or is there more than one fundamental intrinsic value. Mason outlines two ways in which values have been considered in relation to one another: the first is called “[[Monism|monist]]”, which maintains that there is just one intrinsic value to which all other values are auxiliary; and the second is called “[[Value pluralism|pluralist]]”, which maintains that there are many kinds of value and that the most important of these are irreducible to one another. Typical of the first school were the [[Utilitarianism|Utilitarians]], such as [[Jeremy Bentham]], who thought that all the values that a person might hold could be reduced to a desire for happiness or pleasure. [[Immanuel Kant]], too, has been described as a monist in saying that the only good in itself lies in possessing a good will.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''; cf. Kant.I ''Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysics of Morals'', 1785, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding those holding pluralist views, Zimmerman in his book ''The Nature of Intrinsic Value'' (2012) gives some examples of more recent philosophers with lists of the kinds of thing that they thought had value:&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman M.J. ''The Nature of Intrinsic Value'' (Rowman and Littlefield, Lanham, 2001) p.189&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Franz Brentano|Brentano]] (1889): Pleasure, Happiness, Love, Knowledge, Beauty, Proportion, Intention, Exercise, Virtue&lt;ref&gt;Brentano F. ''The Origin of our Knowledge of Right and Wrong'', 1889 (Routledge and Keegan Paul, London, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[G. E. Moore|Moore]] (1908) - Aesthetics, Affection, Knowledge, Consciousness, Pleasure, Virtue&lt;ref&gt;Moore G.E. ''Principia Ethica'' (Cambridge University Press, 1903) pp.122 &amp; ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[W. D. Ross|Ross]] (1936) - Virtue, Pleasure, Knowledge, Artistic activity&lt;ref&gt;Ross W.D. ''The Right and the Good'' (Oxford University Press, 1930)&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, Zimmerman singles out the work of [[William Frankena]] who, in his book ''Ethics'' (1963), gave a comprehensive list of values and who, besides suggesting the use of headings, began to group similar values together.&lt;ref&gt;Frankena W.K. ''Ethics'', 1963 (Prentice-Hall, Eaglewood Cliffs, 1973) pp.87-88; cf. Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.2&lt;/ref&gt; It will be useful to discuss these in the following groups:

1. Beauty, harmony, proportion, aesthetic experience

2. Moral disposition, virtue, pleasure, happiness, contentment

3. Truth, knowledge, understanding, wisdom, honour, esteem

4. Life, health, strength, peace, security

5. Love, affection, friendship, cooperation

6. Power, achievement, freedom, adventure, novelty

Frankena, in formulating his list, builds on what he called the “classical triad” of [[Transcendentals|beauty, goodness and truth]]&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''; cf. O’Hear A. ''Philosophy: The Good, the True and the Beautiful'' (Cambridge University Press, 2010) ''cf''. Perry ''Op.cit''.49, pp.93-97, 693&lt;/ref&gt; and headings similar to these terms can be used to introduce a primary set of values as follows.

==Primary Values==

===Aesthetic values===

[[William Frankena|Frankena]] in his list of values groups beauty with harmony, proportion and aesthetic experience. There are many different kinds of value that can be included in this category and Frankena himself distinguishes between “harmony and proportion in objects contemplated” and “harmony and proportion in one’s own life”.&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit.13'', p.88&lt;/ref&gt; He refers to [[Plato]] who, firstly, in the ''[[Philebus]]'' suggests that aesthetic pleasure lies in the “beauty of colour and form”, and secondly in the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' that formal features like harmony and proportion are important not only to art and music but also to the “good life” which itself should contain “form”, “variety” and “balance”.&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit.13'', p.92; cf. Plato ''The Republic'' (ed. Ferrari G., tr. Griffith T., Cambridge University Press, 2000) pp.88-92; cf Plato ''Philebus'' 51&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another distinction results from the question of whether aesthetic value resides in the object contemplated or in the contemplative experience itself.&lt;ref&gt;Beardsley M.C. ''Aesthetics from Classical Greece to the Present'', 1966 (University of Alabama Press, 1975) pp.101-102 &amp; ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; James Shelley in his article ''The Concept of the Aesthetic'' notes that the term "aesthetic" in deriving from the Greek ''aesthesis'', which means perception or awareness, tends towards the latter interpretation;&lt;ref&gt;Shelley J. ''The Concept of the Aesthetic'', 2009 (ed. Zalta E.N. ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Dickie (philosopher)|George Dickie]] in his book ''Art and the Aesthetic'' charts the development of awareness and consciousness in their growing importance to aesthetic theory;&lt;ref&gt;Dickie G. ''Art and the Aesthetic: An Intuitional Analysis'' (Cornell University Press, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; and Zimmerman refers to [[G. E. Moore|G.E.Moore]] who wrote in relation to art and beauty that “by far the most valuable thing we know or can imagine are certain states of consciousness”.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.2; cf. Moore''Op.cit''.11, p.122&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[William Frankena|Frankena]] and [[Nicolai Hartmann]], who Frankena mentions, begin their lists of values with groups including consciousness, life and existence, and Hartmann makes reference to [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] who considered that the value of beauty in art or nature lay in an increased awareness of life as an “affirmation of existence”.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann N. ''Ethics'': Part II, ''The Realm of Ethical Values'' or ''Axiology of Morals'', 1926 (George Allen and Unwin, London, 1951) Chs. 11&amp;12; cf. Nietzsche F. ''The Birth of Tragedy'' pp.263,290&lt;/ref&gt;

Shelley describes another concept apart from “immediacy” or “focussing one’s attention on the subject” and this is the concept of “disinterestedness", a Kantian term which consists in looking at things objectively and impartially.&lt;ref&gt;Kant I. ''The Critique of Judgement'' (tr. Meredith J.C. Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1952)&lt;/ref&gt; He refers to [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] who realised that if perception were to be the only criterion of aesthetic value then, with a mind stripped of practical interest and cultural preconceptions, anything at all might be seen as beautiful: “One thing is only taken as more beautiful than another because it makes this pure contemplation easier”, wrote Schopenhauer,&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer A. ''The World as Will and Representation'' (tr. Payne E. Dover Publications, New York, 1966) pp.271-272&lt;/ref&gt; a view criticised by Sartwell for making the term beauty, ultimately meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;Sartwell C. ''Beauty'', 2012 (ed. Zalta E.N. ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; Shelley, however, manages to elucidate various criteria of aesthetic value from such a standpoint: firstly, that there is value in simple formal relations, in harmony, grace and balance, and in fact in any other objective aspect that a good critic might care to point to; secondly, that there is value in recognising that people have natural tastes and preferences, whether, for example, they prefer “drama or comicality”, or whether the work is striking in some way; and thirdly, that there is value in recognising the presence of “non-exhibited properties”, realising that the work, or perception, is located within an “art-historical context” where only knowledge of, in [[Arthur Danto|Danto’s]] terminology, an “artworld” can facilitate our feeling “the proper sentiments”.&lt;ref&gt;Shelley ''Op.cit''.18; cf. Dickie ''Op.cit.''19&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the views that aesthetic value lies either in the object or in the subjective experience there is a third view which suggests that value lies in some kind of engagement between the two. [[G. E. Moore|G.E.Moore]]  wrote that it is neither in the “beautiful object” nor in the “conscious perception” where value is found but in the relationship between the two.&lt;ref&gt;Moore ''Op.cit''.11 pp.18,59,122&lt;/ref&gt; Shelley too concludes with the idea that there is some reciprocal relationship between subject and object, his example being that of a Bartok quartet, where “a value originally belonging to the quartet has been transferred to the experience, before being reflected back, once again, onto the quartet.”&lt;ref&gt;Shelley ''Op.cit''.18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethical values===

The second group of values listed by Frankena includes happiness, virtue, pleasure, satisfaction and contentment - values traditionally associated with the field of [[Value (ethics)|ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13&lt;/ref&gt;  Zimmerman introduces Plato whose recurring concern was with the nature of the good, how we should live our lives, and whether it is [[pleasure]] or [[virtue]] that will lead to [[happiness]].&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.9, p.114; cf. Plato ''Op.cit''.16, pp.37,51&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding pleasure, he considers food, drink and shelter to be simple [[goods]] – people value them, they value the work that goes into providing them and the pleasure that comes from enjoying them. Zimmerman after asking why eating should be considered a value refers to [[Aristotle]] who said that value resides in “the proper activity or functioning of things according to their nature” and that it is the “active exercising of man’s faculties that give rise to pleasure”.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.2; cf. Aristotle ''Nicomachean Ethics'' (tr. Thomson J., Penguin, Harmondsworth, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Regarding [[virtue]], Elinor Mason refers to [[John Stuart Mill|J.S.Mill]] who made the distinction between lower values and higher values.&lt;ref&gt;Mason ''Op.cit''.1&lt;/ref&gt;  The distinction is that between efficient cause and final cause: whereas efficient cause includes hunger, thirst and the need for shelter, final cause arises from our having an overview of the relation of [[Causality|cause and effect]] whereby we can determine the end we want to achieve and then decide the means to achieve it.&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, p.86; cf. Aristotle ''Metaphysics'' 982b-983a&lt;/ref&gt;  If the end is well-being or happiness then such values as friendship, knowledge and beauty, as well as material sustenance, might be instrumental in achieving this.&lt;ref&gt;Mason ''Op.cit''.1&lt;/ref&gt;  Mason refers to [[G. E. Moore|G.E.Moore]] who, whilst recognising the virtues of “industry and temperance”, recognised that there exists a “plurality of bearers of value”. [[Love]], [[beauty]] and [[friendship]] are intrinsic values (i.e. good in themselves) rather than instrumental values, and they do not lead in all cases necessarily either to [[pleasure]] or [[happiness]].&lt;ref&gt;Moore ''Op.cit.''11&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another significant writer on value, mentioned by both [[William Frankena|Frankena]] and Zimmerman, is [[John Dewey]] who questioned whether intrinsic values exist at all. All values for Dewey were instrumental. He compared life to an “ongoing stream” of cause and effect, which he called the “continuum of means and ends”,&lt;ref&gt;Dewey J. ''Theory of Valuation'', 1923, in ''International Encyclopaedia of Unified Sciences'' Vol II (University of Chicago Press, 1939) p.43; cf. Anderson ''Op.cit''.140&lt;/ref&gt;  where for example a lack of food leads to human activity leading to a further expenditure of energy, the need for more food and so on. He maintained, like [[Aristotle]], that value lay in economy and in the efficient functioning of a human being in terms of a whole range of needs and wants.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''. pp.15-18, 50&lt;/ref&gt;  These needs arise from a constant “interaction between a human being and his environment” and Dewey introduced the notion of having a “framework” of values to deal effectively with the various categories of being which contribute to our environment.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''. p.47&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural values===

The third of the classical values - [[truth]] – is listed by [[William Frankena|Frankena]] alongside [[knowledge]], understanding and [[wisdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, p.88&lt;/ref&gt;  Given that “truth may never be fully known” he shifted the emphasis onto knowledge, and most lists of values now tend to include knowledge rather than truth as one of the primary values. [[Jesse Prinz]] in ''[[Culture]] and [[Cognitive Science]]'' took this further discussing the relativity of the terms knowledge and truth and the role that culture has in shaping knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Prinz J. ''Culture and Cognitive Science'', 2011 (ed. Zalta E.N. ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;  This relativity is more pronounced in a second group listed by Frankena, a group which included the values of [[honour]], esteem and good reputation. The link between the two groups was noted by [[Nicolai Hartmann|Hartmann]] who realised that the terms “truth” and “truthfulness” involved two different, although related, kinds of value.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann ''Op.cit''.17, Sec.6&lt;/ref&gt;  Whilst [[truth]] is associated with the values of [[knowledge]] and understanding, truthfulness is associated with the values of honesty, uprightness and [[integrity]].

In his article, [[Jesse Prinz|Prinz]] defines [[culture]] as a complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morality and custom where the value associated with these things is acquired by people as members of society. This acquisition takes place through observing role models, imitating one’s parents or learning through association with others. The telling of stories is mentioned&lt;ref&gt;Prinz ''Op.cit''.39&lt;/ref&gt;  and we may think of the value of books, whether fiction or non-fiction, and the worth of films or news programmes in disseminating knowledge and furthering understanding generally. Memory too has its place,&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''; ''cf''. Ruskin J. ''The Seven Lamps of Architecture'' (George Allen, London, 1880) pp.177ff&lt;/ref&gt;  and the importance of history in this respect is highlighted by Zimmerman who notes that some things may have value, not because they are beautiful or useful, but because they have meaning through either personal or cultural associations, for example a rare stamp or the pen with which Lincoln signed his letters.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.2&lt;/ref&gt; 

Knowledge of both [[culture]] and [[subculture]] is important in understanding people’s values.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey ''Op.cit''.35, pp.58-64&lt;/ref&gt;  Jacobson in an article on fitting [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] tells us that what people find funny or shameful, honourable or dishonourable are culturally related, and he refers back to [[Franz Brentano|Brentano]] who introduced the related value of what is appropriate, suitable or fitting.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson D. ''Fitting Attitude Theories of Value'', 2011 (ed. Zalta E.N. ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;  Such values, however, can be considered not only from the point of view of a particular culture but from “the point of view of the universe” where integrating one’s set of values with the principles of some higher truth (“selective copying” is the example he gives) may result in instances of non-conformity and other kinds of differentiation within society.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept of “fittingness” introduces the value of [[integrity]] which Cox, La Caze and Levine discuss in their article ''Integrity'' [2001].&lt;ref&gt;Cox D., La Caze M. &amp; Levine M. ''Integrity'', 2001 (ed. Zalta E.N. ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept is defined in terms of the relation between the different aspects of one’s life – aesthetic, social, intellectual etc. – and in maintaining some sort of balance between them to give a sense of unity or wholeness. Views on integrity range from the practical requirements of honesty and truthfulness on the one hand, where [[Aristotle]] could write “with a true view all the data harmonise and with a false view the facts soon clash”,&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle ''Op.cit''.30, 1098b&lt;/ref&gt;  to more general approaches regarding meaning and [[Personal identity|identity]], or “wisdom and [[Self-concept|self-knowledge]]”.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, La Caze &amp; Levine ''Op.cit''.47&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Secondary Values==

The end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries saw an expansion in the number of values over and above the “classical” or primary values of beauty, goodness and truth. Some, like love, friendship and affection, clearly come from the Christian tradition and were discussed by philosophers like [[G. E. Moore|Moore]] and [[Franz Brentano|Brentano]].&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit.'' 13, pp.56-59; ''cf''. Moore ''Op.cit''.11 pp.131-132&lt;/ref&gt;  A more complex group revolving around concepts such as power, spirit and the will were introduced as values by Brentano and [[Nicolai Hartmann|Hartmann]] and owe as much to the thoughts of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] as they do to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm R. ''Brentano and Intrinsic Value'' (Cambridge University Press, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;  The emergence of a third group of values can be seen as a result of the expansion of the field away from traditional ethics, and in this group there begin to appear more material values – what [[Plato]] called the “goods of the body” – such as life, health and strength in the lists of Hartmann and Frankena.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann ''Op.cit''.17; cf. Plato ''Op.cit''.16 591b; cf Plato ''Meno'' 90ff&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some early attempts were made at compiling a longer set of values and three of these can be mentioned here. [[Ralph Barton Perry|R.B.Perry]], referred to by Frankena, and whose work ''The General Theory of Value'' [1926] was called “the magnum opus of the new approach” by the Encyclopaedia Britannica, increased the total number of categories by adding to the fields of aesthetics, ethics and knowledge the three further fields of religion, economics and politics;&lt;ref&gt;Perry R.B. ''General Theory of Value'' (Harvard University Press; 1926) pp.693-694&lt;/ref&gt;  An earlier work, ''Lebensformen'' [1914], by the psychologist, [[Eduard Spranger]], set out a similar list describing six types of personality, namely the Aesthetic, Economic, Theoretic, Religious, Social and Political;&lt;ref&gt;Spranger E. ''Types of Men'', 1914 (tr. Pigors P., Max Niemeyer Verlag, Halle, 1928)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gordon Allport]], who studied under Spranger, and who was mentioned in [[Christopher Peterson (psychologist)|Peterson]] and [[Martin Seligman|Seligman’s]] ''[[Character Strengths and Virtues]]'' [2004]&lt;ref&gt;Miller C.B. ''Empirical Approaches to Moral Character'', 2016 (ed. Zalta E.N. ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', 2016); ''cf''. Peterson C. &amp; Seligman M. ''Character Strengths and Virtues'' (Oxford University Press, New York, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; , together with Vernon and Lindzey, set out in their ''Study of Values'' [1950] six types of personality each of which was orientated towards a different set of values:&lt;ref&gt;Allport G., Vernon P.E. &amp; Lindzey G.E. ''Study of Values'' (Houghton Mifflin, Boston, 1960)&lt;/ref&gt;

These early links between philosophy and psychology have been discussed recently by C.B.Miller in his article entitled ''Empirical Approaches to Moral Character'' and this concluded with a look at the work of Peterson and Seligman.&lt;ref&gt;Miller ''Op.cit''.55&lt;/ref&gt;  Their classification of values, "[[Values in Action Inventory of Strengths|Values in Action]]" or VIA, arose from an empirical survey of virtues taken from around the world, which led to a six-fold classification, similar to the above, and comprising: Transcendence, Temperance, Wisdom, Justice, Humanity and Courage.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson and Seligman ''Op.cit'' 55&lt;/ref&gt;  Miller suggested, however, that no valid reason has been discovered as to why there should be six categories.

Regarding the content of these additional categories it is clear that their representative values differ according to who is compiling the list. One theory suggests that if the first three categories represent the cognitive or classical tradition, then the additional categories represent the non-cognitive - the “sentimental” or “emotivist” tradition - where neither the cognitive nor the non-cognitive necessarily takes primacy.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit.'' 2; Jacobson ''Op.cit''. 45&lt;/ref&gt;  Zimmerman suggested that values taken from the latter viewpoint could be seen as just expressions of feeling or emotion about what is important.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.&lt;/ref&gt;  A.M.Taylor in her paper, ''Investigation into Facts and Values'' [1983], suggested that there was a fundamental difference between values based on analytical understanding and values based on synthetic or “wholistic” understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor A-M (née Cushan) ''Investigation into Facts and Values'', 1983 (Ondwell Publications, Victoria, Australia, 2014) pp.9, 14-16&lt;/ref&gt;  The older values taken from the “aesthetic, moral and scientific spheres” were not enough and new categories would be required to include such concepts as “creativity, feeling and innovation”. Jacobson also introduced a distinction between cognitive and non-cognitive values, and among the values derived from feeling or sentiment he included those of being “pride-worthy, shameful, funny and fearsome”.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson ''Op.cit''.45&lt;/ref&gt;  He mentioned [[David Hume]] in this respect who had used the three headings of “Pride and Humility”, “Love and Hatred” and “Will and the Direct Passions” in the second volume of his ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature|Treatise of Human Nature]]''&lt;ref&gt;Hume D. A ''Treatise of Human Nature'' (ed. Selby-Bigge L.A., Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;  and it will be useful to look at the second group of values in this order.

===Material Values===

[[William Frankena|Frankena’s]] list of values begins with a group that contains life, health and strength and in this he closely follows [[Nicolai Hartmann|Hartmann]].&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, p.88&lt;/ref&gt;  “Material goods” were discussed by Hartmann in the introductory section of his book,''The Realm of Ethical Values'' [1926] in relation to wealth and economics.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann ''Op.cit''.21&lt;/ref&gt;  Frankena mentions [[Plato]] who had referred to wealth, health and strength as “goods of the body”.&lt;ref&gt;Plato ''Op.cit''.16&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding wealth, Frankena, in a discussion of “money, cars and other material possessions”, suggested that its value might be either instrumental or contributory, the latter term being defined in terms of “things that are good because they contribute to a good life or are parts of it”.&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, pp.62,81&lt;/ref&gt;  Money for a miser becomes part of his happiness, just as clothes, house or land may be a part of happiness for somebody else. Jacobson introduced the value of being “pride-worthy” and he mentioned [[David Hume]] who had noted that people take pride in, such “external advantages as… country, family, children, gardens, houses, dogs and clothes”.&lt;ref&gt;Hume ''Op.cit''.63, p.545&lt;/ref&gt;  Elinor Mason mentioned the practical wisdom of [[Aristotle]] who saw wealth as a matter of prudence, and who advised people to value and “not to neglect” what belongs to them.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle ''Op.cit''.30, 1120b&lt;/ref&gt; 

Health on the other hand, in relation to the body and the mind, is usually thought of as an intrinsic value. [[William Frankena|Frankena]], for example, wrote that we desire health “for its own sake”,&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, pp.82,87&lt;/ref&gt;  and Zimmerman wrote that “Being healthy is just a good way to be”.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.2&lt;/ref&gt;  The value that we ascribe to life itself and the value of “just being” have been mentioned previously, but it was Hartmann who reintroduced the notion from earlier German philosophy that Being has a complementary category, namely that of [[Becoming (philosophy)|Becoming]].&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann ''Op.cit''.21; cf. Schopenhauer ''Op.cit''.23&lt;/ref&gt;  Everything is subject to change over time, and without human intervention, is subject to deterioration and decay. In relation to this, Mason referred to [[Immanuel Kant]] one of whose principal values lay in [[duty]], particularly, in this respect, duty to self, and looking after the “basic stuff” through physical exercise and maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;Kant I ''The Metaphysics of Morals'', 1797 (tr. Gregor M., Cambridge University Press, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;  Plato had also thought that the right way of living lay in “medicine, bathing and exercise”&lt;ref&gt;Plato ''Op.cit''.16&lt;/ref&gt;  but Kant added to this idea by saying that value also lay in self-improvement through the cultivation of any “natural talents and gifts of fortune” that a person might possess.&lt;ref&gt;Kant ''Op.cit''.73&lt;/ref&gt;  [[James Griffin (philosopher)|James Griffin]] in his book on ''[[Well-being|Well-Being]]'' [1986] similarly introduced the value of “accomplishment” and how, in Aristotle’s terminology, we might grow and “[[Flourishing|flourish]]” in other ways.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin J. ''Well-Being: Its Meaning, Measurement and Moral Importance'' (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1986) pp.35,57&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Communal Values===

To the classical triad of beauty, goodness and truth various philosophers in the twentieth century began to add values from another large family: that of, in [[William Frankena|Frankena's]] words, “[[love]], [[friendship]], mutual affection and cooperation”;&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, pp.42,88&lt;/ref&gt; [[G. E. Moore|G.E.Moore]] added “love” to the values of beauty, moral quality and knowledge;&lt;ref&gt;Moore ''Op.cit''.11, pp.122-123; cf. Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.9, p.189&lt;/ref&gt; and Jacobson added “friendship” to the values of beauty, pleasure and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson ''Op.cit''.45 “Consider a plausible list of intrinsic values: pleasure, beauty, friendship, knowledge…”&lt;/ref&gt;  Moore, in reflecting Christianity’s emphasis on the importance of [[Agape|love]], suggested that “… the love of love is by far the most valuable good we know… more complicated than beauty… more complicated than knowledge”.&lt;ref&gt;Moore ''Op.cit''.11, p.132&lt;/ref&gt;  Both Frankena and Zimmerman mentioned [[Plato]], who had outlined various kinds of [[love]] in the ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Plato ''Symposium'' 197&lt;/ref&gt;  and who had described ''sympatheia'' or coaffection , as “filling men with affection… kindness… friendship… forgiveness”.&lt;ref&gt;Plato ''Op.cit''.16, 605d&lt;/ref&gt;  For Plato, the soul was the seat of love and the affections, and its value lay in recognising the “community of feeling among mankind”.&lt;ref&gt;Plato ''Timaeus'' 192b; Plato ''Gorgias'' 481&lt;/ref&gt;  Jacobson referred to [[David Hume]] who similarly linked love with [[sympathy]], the  latter feeling arising from “the great resemblance among human creatures”.&lt;ref&gt;Hume ''Op.cit.''63, p.112&lt;/ref&gt; 

On a more practical level, [[Bernard Gert]] in his work on ''The Definition of Morality'' [2002] introduced the notion of “[[loyalty]]” as a factor in establishing a sense of [[community]] among family and kinship groups.&lt;ref&gt;Gert B. &amp; Gert J. ''The Definition of Morality'', 2002 (ed. Zalta E.N. ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding wider society, Gert mentioned [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] who distinguished between the values of not harming other people on the one hand and performing positive, charitable acts on the other.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Zimmerman also mentioned Kant and his view that the only thing that is good without qualification is goodwill or benevolence.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.2&lt;/ref&gt;  Kant had defined [[friendship]] as “the coming together of two persons through mutual love, each particating and sharing their lives in a sympathetic manner”.&lt;ref&gt;Kant ''Op.cit''.73, 6.450, 6.469&lt;/ref&gt;  He also introduced the concept of “[[respect]]” by which he meant keeping an appropriate distance from others within the community,&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''. 6.449&lt;/ref&gt;  and he talked of [[community]] itself in terms of “being able to communicate… to perfect social intercourse… and to cultivate a disposition of… reciprocity… agreeableness… courtesy… hospitality”.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.6.473&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Communication]] was introduced as a separate value by [[Ralph Barton Perry|Perry]];&lt;ref&gt;Perry ''Op.cit''.53, pp.13-14&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Nicolai Hartmann|Hartmann]], after working through the primary values, introduced a “second group” which included not only “brotherly love” but also “social intercourse”.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann ''Op.cit''.21&lt;/ref&gt;  Frankena introduced [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] who had stressed the value of communication in human relationships saying that “there are close parallels between the communication of words and that between lover and beloved”.&lt;ref&gt;Gilby T. ''St Thomas Aquinas: Theological Texts'' (Oxford University Press) pp.181ff&lt;/ref&gt;  Gert too realised that there was value in “interpersonal interaction” but queried how such a value could apply in the absence of other people, for example, on a desert island.&lt;ref&gt;Gert &amp; Gert ''Op.cit''.85&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William Frankena|Frankena]] answered the question by widening the scope of love to include love of, or communion with, God, animals, nature and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13 p.88&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spiritual Values===

Towards the end of his list, [[William Frankena|Frankena]] included the values of power and achievement, freedom, adventure and novelty.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding freedom, he introduced [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] who saw life as a continuous engagement with the realm of strife, a struggle against desire and the “[[Will (philosophy)|primal will]]”, where the only moments of freedom that a person may have lay in art, music and [[Spirituality|spiritual contemplation]].&lt;ref&gt;Beardsley ''Op.cit''.17, p.459; cf. Carrit E.F. ''The Theory of Beauty'' (Methuen &amp; Co, London, 1914) p.122&lt;/ref&gt;  Strength and freedom of the [[Will (philosophy)|will]] were values for Hartmann too,&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann ''Op.cit''.21, Sec.3&lt;/ref&gt;  and also for [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] who, as Zimmerman noted, saw such freedom lying in the absence of coercion either from external agencies of from internal “sensuous impulses”.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.2; cf.Kant I. ''Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysics of Morals'', 1785, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;  These latter included [[Emotion|emotions]] such as [[desire]], [[fear]], [[hope]] and [[anger]], whose value, or power, lay, according to Aristotle, in moving a person either towards or away from some perceived object.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle ''De Anima'' 408b; Similar feelings inform our attitudes, according to Brentano, which he termed either pro-attitudes or anti-attitudes accordingly, see Chisholm ''Op.cit.''51, p.22&lt;/ref&gt;  Griffin distinguished between desire itself and “informed desire”, where the value of the latter lay in stirring the mind, not involuntarily through emotion and natural inclination, but through the voluntary power of the will.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin ''Op.cit''.76; pp.26-27&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Attitude (psychology)|Attitudes]] can be controlled through strength of mind, courage and self-discipline, and “corrected”, according to [[Franz Brentano|Brentano]], through an informed choice about what is right, fitting or appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson ''Op.cit''.45&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[William Frankena|Frankena]] recorded that his list included “all the things that [[Nicolai Hartmann|Hartmann]] mentions”,&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, p.88&lt;/ref&gt;  but it is notable that Hartmann completed his list with what he called “spiritual goods” such as “love of the remote” and, in a [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzschian]] phrase, “radiant virtue”.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann ''Op.cit''.21, Sec.7&lt;/ref&gt;  Love of the remote referred to either love of the wilderness or love of God, but Michael Stocker in ''Plural and Conflicting Values'' [1990]&lt;ref&gt;Stocker M. ''Plural and Conflicting Values'' (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;  suggested that value lay more, as Plato had said, not in love but in the “[[contemplation]]” of God or of what is good: “He who proceeds aright”, said Plato, “should begin in youth to visit beautiful places… to contemplate the vast sea… until on that shore he grows and waxes strong”.&lt;ref&gt;Plato ''Symposium'' 210&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Jewish tradition it was not so much the sea that bestowed strength, but the hills,&lt;ref&gt;Psalms 121.1&lt;/ref&gt;  and Griffin referred to those who value mountains for the excitement or the [[sublimity]] that they might afford.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin ''Op.cit''.76, p.27&lt;/ref&gt;   Frankena referred to the values of adventure and novelty that [[Alfred North Whitehead|A.N.Whitehead]] had introduced,&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, p.92&lt;/ref&gt;  but it was [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] in the previous century who had written about the inspirational value of new things and of travel, not only for the sake of art or study, but for the value of the experience itself.&lt;ref&gt;Emerson R.W. ''Experience'' in ''Nature and Selected Essays'' (Penguin, Harmondsworth, 1982)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Nicolai Hartmann|Hartmann]] suggested that it might be a great work of art such as a cathedral or a piece of music that might be inspiring,&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann ''Op.cit''.21, p.57&lt;/ref&gt;  and he mentioned [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] who wrote regarding art: “What does all art do? Does it not select? Does it not highlight? By doing these art strengthens certain values… It is the great stimulus of life”.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche F. ''Twilight of the Idols'' (tr. Hollingdale R., Penguin, Harmondsworth, 1968) pp.81-82&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively it might be [[humour]] that lifts the spirits and Jacobson discusses the value that different kinds of humour, such as being funny or being amusing might merit.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson ''Op.cit.''45&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories of Value==

Various theories have been put forward in the West to try and define what a value “is” – as opposed to saying what kinds of value a thing may “have”.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.2&lt;/ref&gt;  There are generally held to be three kinds of theory at present that attempt to answer the question of what a value is and these have been borrowed from the field of [[Normative ethics|ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Mason ''Op.cit''.1; cf. Frankena ''Op.cit.''13, pp.14,62; cf. Schroeder ''Op.cit''.5&lt;/ref&gt;  Each group of theories tends to concentrate on different aspects of the subject so that if ethics can be defined as, say,  the principles governing the conduct of a person&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, p.6; cf. Gert &amp; Gert ''Op.cit''.85&lt;/ref&gt;  then the first group of theories ([[ontology]] and [[Deontological ethics|deontology]]) looks at the principles themselves, the second group of theories ([[teleology]] and [[consequentialism]]) looks at the aims and outcomes of conduct, and the third group of theories ([[virtue ethics]] and fitting-attitude theory) looks at the concept of the person, their character and attitudes.

===Ontology and Deontology===

[[Ontology]] (from the Greek ''Ontos'' meaning “being” or “that which is”)&lt;ref&gt;Liddell and Scott ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', 1940, pr.p. of ''ennai'' “to be”&lt;/ref&gt;  is that branch of metaphysics which deals with being, and, particularly in relation to value theory, with the “ontological categories” or plain [[Category of being|categories of being]].&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.9, p.52; cf. Moore Op.cit.11, pp.77ff&lt;/ref&gt;  Zimmerman mentions [[G. E. Moore|G.E.Moore]] who pointed out that before discussing what we ought to value we should consider the possibility that anything that exists might be of value to somebody: “If we recognise that anything whatever may be good… we start with a much more open mind”.&lt;ref&gt;Moore ''Op.cit''.11, pp.13,74; ''cf''. Perry ''Op.cit''.53, pp.115-116&lt;/ref&gt;  Zimmerman introduced the concept of “[[supervenience]]” through which it is held that any structuring of our values will reflect the structuring of the underlying [[Category of being|categories of being]] themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.2; ''cf''. Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.9, p.115&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] is mentioned by Zimmerman in this respect, and also [[Christine Korsgaard]] who, drawing on Kant’s distinction between [[Thing-in-itself|things-in-themselves]] and the [[Relation (history of concept)|relation between things]], draws a similar distinction between [[Instrumental and intrinsic value|intrinsic values]] (values in virtue of “non-relational properties”) and extrinsic values (values in virtue of “relational properties”).&lt;ref&gt;Ibid; cf. Korsgaard C. ''Two Distinctions in Goodness'' (in ''Philosophical Review'', 92, 169-95, 1983)&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding the former an impasse is reached when all that can be said of intrinsic values is, in Moore’s words, that goodness “just is”, or in Zimmerman’s words that pleasure “just is”.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.2; cf Moore ''Op.cit''.11, pp.6ff&lt;/ref&gt;  This has led to some, like [[Monroe Beardsley]], to say that only extrinsic values, in the final analysis, exist.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;  Different kinds of extrinsic value in this model derive from the different underlying categories of relation, the example given being those of beauty, utility and meaning, each of which is supervenient on one of Kant’s three [[Category (Kant)|categories of relation]], namely disjunction, causality and inherence respectively.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''; cf. ''Kant I. Critique of Pure Reason''  (tr. Smith N.K. Macmillan, London, 1968) pp.107,113&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Deontological ethics|Deontology]], on the other hand, (from the Greek ''Deon'' meaning “duty”)&lt;ref&gt;Liddell &amp; Scott ''Op.cit''.118&lt;/ref&gt;  is the branch of [[Value (ethics)|ethics]] that bases value on moral principles which in turn form a guide to knowing what "ought" to be done in various situations. The problem in philosophy of moving from an “is” to an “ought” (the “[[Is-ought problem]]") is said to have been introduced into philosophy by [[David Hume]]. Richmond Campbell, in discussing this, asks how one might move from a knowledge of what exists, i.e. from a whole range of possible values, to a knowledge of which, among these, one ought to value.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell R. ''Moral Epistemology'', 2003 (ed. Zalta E.N. ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;  Given that “a small number of core moral values are espoused universally” the answer would appear to lie in giving priority to those which do not “conflict”. [[William Frankena|Frankena]] suggested that these moral principles are derived from three main sources: the prevailing moral rules of a culture; divine revelation as found in the holy texts; and logical or metaphysical deduction.&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, pp.12ff&lt;/ref&gt;  Kant’s [[categorical imperative]] is given as an example of the latter, although Frankena pointed out that a distinction would need to be made between arguments of [[Necessity and sufficiency|logical necessity]], i.e. those which contain no contradictions, and arguments of [[Necessity and sufficiency|logical sufficiency]] which would be needed to account for the various kinds of value, whether “aesthetic, prudential or logical”.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''., pp.30-33&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teleology and Consequentialism===

Mark Schroeder in his article on ''Value Theory'' considers [[consequentialism]] to be “under the umbrella” of [[teleology]],&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder ''Op.cit''.5&lt;/ref&gt;  where the latter can be defined as that branch of [[metaphysics]] which deals with the final end or purpose of things (the Greek ''Telos'' meaning “the end or purpose of an action”).&lt;ref&gt;Liddell &amp; Scott ''Op.cit''.118&lt;/ref&gt;  According to this group of theories things are instrumentally valuable which help to achieve either specific or general ends, and underlying this, Schroeder tells us, is the relation of [[Causality|cause and effect]].&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder ''Op.cit''.5&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William Frankena|Frankena]] defined [[Instrumental and intrinsic value|instrumental value]] as that which is good or useful for some purpose and he referred to [[Aristotle]] who, besides defining different [[Four causes|kinds of cause]], defined the good as “that at which all things aim”.&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, p.86; ''cf''. Aristotle ''Op.cit''.30&lt;/ref&gt;  If for example the aim is to live a good life those things will be good or valuable which constitute the means for achieving such an end. However, what is good for a specific person and what is good for the world as a whole are two different things and are reflected, according to Schroeder, in the ideas of [[egoism]] and [[consequentialism]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder ''Op.cit''.5&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding the latter, Zimmerman writes that a value is good because of a perceived final end in which “all the consequences taken as a whole are good”.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.2&lt;/ref&gt; 

Regarding the end at which people aim, [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]], according to Elinor Mason, thought that the sole end was that of  “[[pleasure]]”, and that all other values such as [[beauty]], [[friendship]], [[knowledge]] etc could be measured in accordance with the quantity of pleasure which each might afford.&lt;ref&gt;Mason ''Op.cit''.1&lt;/ref&gt;  [[John Stuart Mill]] suggested that there were lower and higher pleasures and that these were fundamentally incommensurable. He went on to question, like [[Plato]], whether the values of pleasure or satisfaction were in fact the ends at which intelligent people should aim.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''; cf. Plato ''Op.cit''.16, p.505b&lt;/ref&gt;  Mason also refers to [[James Griffin (philosopher)|James Griffin]] who was of the opinion that “[[well-being]]” was a better name for such an end, and which he saw in terms of “[[flourishing]]” or a “maximisation of life” in all its aspects.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin ''Op.cit''.76, pp.34,57&lt;/ref&gt;  A “balancing of elements” is required whereby those activities which we value for well-being, such as work, rest, love, solitude, health, accomplishment etc. should be considered “in various combinations” in order to afford a “framework” or a “plan of life” for ourselves.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''., p.58; cf. Dewey ''Op.cit''.35, p.47 re “framework”&lt;/ref&gt;  This way of thinking was called by [[Elizabeth S. Anderson|Elizabeth Anderson]], in her article on [[John Dewey]], “objective list theory” as opposed to theories like Bentham’s based on pleasure or those of  Dewey based on “informed desire”.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson E. ''Dewey’s Moral Philosophy'', 2005 (ed. Zalta E.N. ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;  Dewey rejected the notion of a final end arguing instead that the “value of means and ends are reciprocally determined”.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey ''Op.cit''.35, pp.24,40ff&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Zimmerman, he challenged traditional metaphysical ideas with a more “pragmatic” approach saying that only through “calm, informed reflection” on the ways in which people “interact with the environment” and deal with the ensuing consequences can value be ascertained.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.2; cf. Dewey ''Op.cit''.35, p.30&lt;/ref&gt;
  
===Virtue Ethics and Fitting-Attitude Theory===

Mason in her article on ''[[Value pluralism|Value Pluralism]]'' introduces [[virtue ethics]] as a third way of thinking about the subject of value and describes it as being based on how a person should “be” rather than what a person should “do”.&lt;ref&gt;Mason ''Op.cit''.1&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William Frankena|Frankena]] had similarly introduced an “ethics of [[virtue]]” as a third approach (following [[Deontological ethics|deontology]] and [[consequentialism]]), suggesting that there were two kinds of things that we can value: either the things around us like knowledge or physical objects; or the things inside us like our [[Trait theory|disposition]], [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] and [[Emotion|emotions]].&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, p.62&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the latter were the virtues and these he defined as dispositions to act in certain ways.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''., pp.64,68&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding the virtues, we can either value them in their own right or we can ask whether they tell us something about the nature of value itself. Hursthouse and Pettigrew deal with the first of these options in their article on ''[[Virtue Ethics]]'', asking questions like “how many virtues are there” and “how do they relate to each other”.&lt;ref&gt;Hursthouse R. &amp; Pettigrove G. ''Virtue Ethics'', 2003 (ed. Zalta E.N. ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;  C.B.Miller, on the other hand, in his article on [[Moral character|moral character]] points to recent work which suggests that the [[Category of being|categories]] used to structure the virtues are the same as those that can be used to structure values. The six “core virtues” listed by Peterson and Seligman have been found to be useful, for example, in the structuring of values in their “[[Values in Action Inventory of Strengths|Values in Action]]” or VAI.&lt;ref&gt;Miller ''Op.cit''.55&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of the similarities between [[virtue theory]] and fitting-attitude theory is that they both approach the subject of value through an emphasis on the agent.&lt;ref&gt;Mason ''Op.cit''.1; cf. Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, p.64&lt;/ref&gt;  They are “agent-centred” rather than “act-centred” theories, but whereas virtues are defined purely as a disposition to act, fitting-attitude theory embraces the act as well within its field of consideration. [[Roderick Chisholm]] in his book, ''Brentano and Intrinsic Value'' [1986] suggested that value lies, for example, not just in [[virtue]] but in “individuals acting virtuously” or not just in [[pleasure]] but in “individuals experiencing pleasure”.&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm ''Op.cit''.51, p.17&lt;/ref&gt;  However, just as there is conceived to be a necessary interaction between the agent and the environment so there is, in other circumstances, a necessary engagement between the agent and an object. Jacobson in his article on ''Fitting-Attitude Theory'' suggests that there is a reciprocity between “facts about human nature” and “facts about the object”,&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson ''Op.cit''.45&lt;/ref&gt;  and that “to be valuable” requires either that one’s “feelings are adequate to the object”, or that “the object is “fitting” in respect of some particular attitude.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept of fittingness, or what might fit together, is extended to the relation between different values and, in particular, the possible conflicts between them, the examples given being between that of [[humour]] and [[Taste (sociology)|good taste]], or between what is considered funny and what is considered fair or just. Both Mason&lt;ref&gt;Mason ''Op.cit''.1&lt;/ref&gt;  and Zimmerman&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit.'' 2&lt;/ref&gt;  discuss the problem of [[Value pluralism|conflicting values]], as did [[Philippa Foot]] who, in the field of [[virtue ethics]], suggested that the answer to possible conflict lay in bringing the virtues, or values, into relation with one another saying “that even such concepts as love and justice can become dangerously distorted" if not tempered with a consideration of other fundamental values.&lt;ref&gt;Foot P. ''Virtues and Vices and Other Essays in Moral Philosophy'', 1978 (Clarendon press, Oxford, 2002) locs.125,225&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14019">'''Violent extremism''' refers to the [[belief]]s and actions of people who support or use ideologically motivated [[violence]] to achieve radical [[Ideology|ideological]], [[Religion|religious]] or [[Politics|political]] views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/countering-violent-extremism|title=Countering Violent Extremism {{!}} Homeland Security|website=www.dhs.gov|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Living Safe Together Home"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.livingsafetogether.gov.au/pages/home.aspx|title=Living Safe Together Home|website=www.livingsafetogether.gov.au|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violent [[Extremism|extremist]] views can be exhibited along a range of issues, including politics, religion and gender relations. No [[society]], [[religious community]] or [[World view|worldview]] is immune to violent extremism.&lt;ref name="Living Safe Together Home"/&gt; Though “[[radicalization]]” is a contested term to some, it has come to be used to define the process through which an individual or a group considers violence as a legitimate and a desirable means of action. Radical thought that does not condone the exercise of violence to further political goals may be seen as normal and acceptable, and be promoted by groups working within the boundaries of the law.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002446/244676e.pdf|title=A Teacher’s  Guide on the Prevention of Violent Extremism|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=UNESCO|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often used as a [[code name]] for [[Islamic terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/02/obama-violent-extremism-radical-islam/385700/|title=The Real Reason Obama Avoids the Phrase 'Radical Islam'|first=Peter|last=Beinart|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the American military domain, the term "violent extremist organizations" or VEO is now used. The [[Barack Obama|Obama]] administration defines VEO as groups of "individuals who support or commit ideologically motivated violence to further political goals".&lt;ref&gt;The White House, ''Strategic Implementation Plan for Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United States'' (Washington, D.C.: Office of the President, 2011), available at: https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/sipfinal.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These groups include both ideologically-motivated international terrorist organizations (ITO) and homegrown violent extremists (HVE).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raugh|first=David|date=June 2016|title=Is the Hybrid Threat a True Threat?|url=http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/jss/vol9/iss2/2|journal=Journal of Strategic Security|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=1–13|doi=10.5038/1944-0472.9.2.1507|issn=1944-0464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
There is no single profile or pathway for radicalization, or even speed at which it happens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davies|first=Lynn|title=Educating against Extremism: Towards a Critical Politicisation of Young People|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ830767|journal=International Review of Education|language=en|volume=55|pages=183–203|doi=10.1007/s11159-008-9126-8|issn=0020-8566}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nor does the level of education seem to be a reliable predictor of vulnerability to radicalization. It is however established that there are [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]], [[Psychology|psychological]] and institutional factors that lead to violent extremism. Specialists group these factors into three main categories, push factors, pull factors and contextual factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PBAAA929.pdf|title=USAID Summary of Factors Effecting Violent Extremism|last=|first=|date=|website=USAID|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://apo.org.au/resource/countering-violent-extremism-developing-evidence-base-policy-and-practice|title=Countering violent extremism: developing an evidence-base for policy and practice|last=Younis|first=Sara Zeiger, Anne Aly, Peter R.

=== Push factors ===
“Push Factors” drive individuals to violent extremism, such as: [[marginalization]], inequality, [[discrimination]], [[persecution]] or the perception thereof; limited access to quality and relevant education; the denial of rights and civil liberties; and other environmental, historical and [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] grievances.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Pull factors ===
“Pull Factors” nurture the appeal of violent extremism, for example: the existence of well-organized violent extremist groups with compelling discourses and effective programmes that are providing services, revenue and/or employment in exchange for membership. Groups can also lure new members by providing outlets for grievances and promise of adventure and freedom. Furthermore, these groups appear to offer spiritual comfort, “a place to belong” and a supportive social network.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Contextual factors ===
Contextual factors that provide a favourable terrain to the emergence of violent extremist groups, such as: fragile states, the lack of [[rule of law]], [[corruption]] and [[Crime|criminality]].

== Prevention of radicalisation and deradicalisation ==

=== Education ===
[[File:Key dimensions of preventing Preventing violent extremism.svg|thumb|Key dimensions of preventing violent extremism]]
The role of [[education]] in preventing violent extremism and de-radicalizing young people has only recently gained global acceptance. An important step in this direction was the launch, in December 2015, of the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary-General]]’s Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism which recognizes the importance of quality education to address the drivers of this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/sc/ctc/docs/2015/SCR%202178_2014_EN.pdf|title=Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism. Report of the Secretary-General|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=United Nations|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[United Nations Security Council]] also emphasized this point in its Resolutions 2178 and 2250, which notably highlights the need for “quality education for peace that equips youth with the ability to engage constructively in civic structures and inclusive political processes” and called on “ all relevant actors to consider instituting mechanisms to promote a culture of peace, tolerance, intercultural and interreligious dialogue that involve youth and discourage their participation in acts of violence, terrorism, xenophobia, and all forms of discrimination.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unoy.org/wp-content/uploads/SCR-2250.pdf|title=UN Security Council Resolution 2250, adopted in December 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=United Nations|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education has been identified as preventing radicalisation through:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Developing the [[communication]] and [[interpersonal skills]] they need to dialogue, face [[disagreement]] and learn peaceful approaches to change.
* Developing [[critical thinking]] to investigate claims, verify [[Rumor|rumours]] and question the legitimacy and appeal of extremist beliefs.
* Developing resilience to resist extremist narratives and acquire the social-emotional skills they need to overcome their doubts and engage constructively in society without having to resort to violence.
* Fostering critically informed citizens able to constructively engage in peaceful collective action.

[[UNESCO]] has emphasised [[Global citizenship education|Global Citizenship Education]] (GCED) as an emerging approach to education that focuses on developing learners’ knowledge, skills, values and attitudes in view of their active participation in the peaceful and sustainable development of their societies. GCED aims to instill respect for [[human rights]], [[social justice]], [[gender equality]] and [[environmental sustainability]], which are fundamental values that help raise the defences of peace against violent extremism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002329/232993e.pdf|title=Global  Citizenship Education – Topics and Learning Objectives|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=UNESCO|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002277/227729e.pdf|title=Global Citizenship Education - Preparing learners for the challenges of the twenty-first century|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=UNESCO|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Sabaoon Project, Pakistan ===
[[File:Sabaoons deradicalisation Preventing violent extremism.svg|thumb|Sabaoon’s deradicalisation and rehabilitation model]]
The Sabaoon Project, initiated by the [[Pakistan Army]] and run by the Social Welfare Academics and Training organization (SWAaT) since 2009, has been implemented to deradicalize and rehabilitate former militant youth who were involved in violent extremist activities and apprehended by the army in [[Swat District|Swat]] and the surrounding areas in Pakistan. Based on an individualized approach and intervention, the project follows a three-step model (see image).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002477/247764e.pdf|title=Preventing violent extremism through education: A guide for policy makers|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-3-100215-1|location=|pages=24, 36, 41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kenya’s initiatives to address radicalization of youth in educational institutions ===
To tackle the issue of violent extremism and radicalization in schools, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology of Kenya launched a new national strategy targeting youth in 2014, entitled Initiatives to Address Radicalization of the Youth in Educational Institutions in the Republic of Kenya. The Strategy adopted measures that service the students’ interests and well-being. For example, it includes efforts to create child-friendly school environments and encourages students to participate in “talent academies” to pursue an area of their own interest.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Strategy also includes the discontinuation of ranking schools based on academic performance. This was to lessen the overemphasis on examinations and to reduce student pressure, incorporating other indicators of student achievement, such as abilities in sport and artistic talent. The purpose is to reduce the stress of students’ lives at home and in school that may be vented through escape tactics, including joining outlawed groups. The Strategy also employs other effective means to prevent violent extremism, including the integration of Preventing of Violent Extremism through Education (PVE-E) in curricula and school programmes; adopting a multi- sectoral and multi-stakeholder approach; encouraging student participation through student governance processes and peer-to-peer education; and the involvement of media as a stakeholder.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Gender disparity ==
While it is being increasingly reported that women play an active role in violent extremist organizations and attacks as assailants and supporters, men are still more often the perpetrators of violent extremist acts and therefore the targets of recruitment campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;B.
