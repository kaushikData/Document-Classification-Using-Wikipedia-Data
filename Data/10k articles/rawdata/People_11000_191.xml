'''Al-Harith ibn Adnan''' ({{lang-ar|عك بن عدنان}}; perhaps the same as Akk) is the brother of [[Ma'ad ibn Adnan]], who is an ancestor of the [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]]. He is featured in ancient [[Arabic literature]].

==Parentage==
[[File:Adnanites.PNG|thumbnail|right|The Adnanite Arab family tree, created from "The Life of Mohammad" by [[Ibn Hisham]]]]
Some say that [[Ma'ad ibn Adnan]] had a brother called Al-Dith, and that he was actually Akk. However, others say that Akk was the son of Al-Dith, and thus a grandson of [[Adnan]]. Nevertheless, the majority agree that Akk and Al-Dith are the same person, the son of [[Adnan]]. &lt;ref name="tabari2"&gt;{{cite book |last=[[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]]|first=[[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Muhammad ibn Jarir]]|title=The History of al-Tabari Vol. 6: Muhammad at Mecca|page=36|year=1988|publisher=SUNY Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If Akk and Al-Dith are the same person, then his mother and the mother of [[Ma'ad ibn Adnan]] were the same.&lt;ref name="tabari2"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tribe==
Akk dwelt in the [[Qays and Yaman tribes|Yaman]] because he took a wife amongst the Asharites and lived with them, adopting their language. The Asharites were descended from [[Sabaeans|Saba']] ibn Yashjub ibn [[Yarab|Ya'rub]] ibn [[Qahtanites|Qahtan]]. &lt;ref name="Ishaq"&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Ibn Ishaq]]|first=[[Muhammad ibn Ishaq|Muhammad]]|title=The Life of Muhammad|page=4|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akk was the founder of a Southern Arabian tribe, the tribe of Akk. According to the following verse, the mother of Madhij (the founder of another Southern tribe that settled in [[Jordan]]) was from Akk:&lt;blockquote&gt;

Woe to the mother of Madhij from Akk!
(That is the mother of Madhij weeping) &lt;ref name="tabari17"&gt;{{cite book |last=[[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]]|first=[[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Muhammad ibn Jarir]]|title=The History of al-Tabari Vol. 17: The First Civil War|page=46|year=1996|publisher=SUNY Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some genealogists say that Akk departed for Samran, in the [[Yemen]], leaving his brother [[Ma'ad]]. This is because, when the people of [[Hadur]] killed Shu'ayb b. Dhi Mahdam al- Haduri, [[God]] sent [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] against them as a punishment. [[Jeremiah|Armiya]] and Barkhiya went away taking [[Ma'ad]] with them, and when the warfare had died down they took him back to [[Mecca]]. [[Ma'ad]] then found that his brothers and uncles who were descended from Adnan had joined the [[Qays and Yaman tribes|peoples of the Yemen]] and had intermarried with them; the Yemenites had been sympathetic to them because they were descendants of [[Jurhum]]. They quote the following verse as proof of this story:&lt;blockquote&gt;

We left our brothers, al-Dith and Akk &lt;br&gt;
on their way to Samran, and they departed quickly. &lt;br&gt;
They were of the [[Adnanites|Banu Adnan]], &lt;br&gt;
but they lost this descent irrevocably among themselves. &lt;ref name="tabari237"&gt;{{cite book |last=[[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]]|first=[[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Muhammad ibn Jarir]]|title=The History of al-Tabari Vol. 6: Muhammad at Mecca|page=37|year=1988|publisher=SUNY Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
Vollenweider was born in 1953 and is the son of Hans Vollenweider (1918–1993), an organist and composer, while his mother was a painter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Bio/Vollenweider-Hans.htm|title = Hans Vollenweider (Organ)|date = July 2010|accessdate = October 2, 2014|website = Bach Cantatas website|publisher = Aryeh Oron|last = Montgomery|first = Shaun}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JCQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT1&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title = Vollenweider Doesn't Harp on His Success|last = Sutherland|first = Sam|date = November 17, 1984|journal = Billboard Magazine|accessdate = October 2, 2014|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, he married Beata, a kindergarten teacher,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; with whom he has two sons (Jonathan and Sebastian) and a daughter, Noëmi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.morgenpost.de/printarchiv/wwbm/article294357/Dreiundzwanzig-Sonntagsfragen-an-Andreas-Vollenweider-Elektro-Harfenist.html|title = Dreiundzwanzig Sonntagsfragen an Andreas Vollenweider, Elektro-Harfenist|date = November 19, 2006|accessdate = October 2, 2014|website = Berliner Morgenpost|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.coopzeitung.ch/125630|title = Andreas Vollenweider: Aus der Reserve|date = August 11, 2011|accessdate = October 2, 2014|website = Coop Zeitung|publisher = |last = Hönle|first = Reinhold}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, Vollenweider discovered the harp and, finding its traditional versions too limited for his own musical ideas, developed his own style, tailoring the instrument according to his needs. He created the electro-acoustic harp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.zhdk.ch/?ca_avo090|title = ZhdK: Andreas Vollenweider|date = March 2010|accessdate = October 2, 2014|website = Zürcher Hochschule der Künste|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141006095544/http://www.zhdk.ch/?ca_avo090|archivedate = October 6, 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He formed the trio ''Poesie und Musik'' together with Rene Bardet (bass) and Orlando Valentini (guitar), recording interpretations of the poetry of [[François Villon]] and [[Heinrich Heine]], but left in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;[https://portal.dnb.de/opac.htm?method=simpleSearch&amp;query=134321251 ''Poesie und Musik''] in the catalog of the Deutschen National Bibliothek&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.library.umass.edu/hosted-projects/heine/symposium-talk/|title = Musical settings of Heinrich Heine's political poetry|date = December 12, 1999|accessdate = October 2, 2014|website = UMass Amherst Libraries|publisher = Goethe Institut in New York City|last = Shea|first = Peter W.|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120126105905/http://www.library.umass.edu/hosted-projects/heine/symposium-talk/|archivedate = January 26, 2012|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Vollenweider also wrote music for film, mainly nature documentaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=W-XEpPcqekMC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title = New Sounds|last = Schaefer|first = John|date = October 1985|journal = Spin Magazine|accessdate = October 2, 2014|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===

==== 1980s ====
In 1979 he released his solo debut, ''Eine Art Suite in XIII Teilen'' in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Discogs.com [http://www.discogs.com/Andreas-Vollenweider-Eine-Art-Suite-In-XIII-Teilen/release/2026596 entry], the album was re-released in 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently began forming his ensemble “Andreas Vollenweider and Friends”, which included Walter Keiser (drums), Pedro Haldemann (percussion), Bobby Reveron (percussion), and Jon Otis (percussion). This five-piece debuted on July 11, 1981 at the Montreux Jazz Festival.&lt;ref&gt;Montreux Jazz Live [http://www.montreuxjazzlive.com/concerts-database?title=Vollenweider&amp;field_concert_date_value%5Bvalue%5D%5Byear%5D=# listing]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; Vollenweider was discovered by the German record-producer and manager Vera Brandes, who oversaw the release of ''[[Behind the Gardens|Behind the Gardens - Behind the Wall - Under the Tree...]]''.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6iQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT27&amp;lpg=PT27&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title = Specialized Marketing Examined|last = Sutherland|first = Sam|date = August 10, 1985|journal = Billboard|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; through her VeraBra Records. The album was distributed through [[CBS Records International]] and reached 32 in the German album charts in March 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Detailed [http://www.chartsurfer.de/artist/andreas-vollenweider/behind-the-gardens-behind-the-wall-under-the-tree-album_fvvhu.html listing] from the German Album chart.&lt;/ref&gt; The follow-up ''[[Caverna Magica]]'' was recorded in the period May–November 1982 while Vollenweider and his band performed around Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Discogs.com [http://www.discogs.com/Andreas-Vollenweider-Caverna-Magica-Under-The-Tree-In-The-Cave/master/82223 listing] for the album.&lt;/ref&gt; Released in January 1983, the album managed to reach 11 in the German album chart.&lt;ref&gt;Detailed German chart [http://www.chartsurfer.de/artist/andreas-vollenweider/caverna-magica-under-the-tree-in-the-cave-album_phvg.html listing].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, he underlined his commitment to environmental issues with the EP "Pace Verde" in support for [[Greenpeace]], which was accompanied by a video that Vollenweider directed and produced himself.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In October of that year he was awarded a Dutch [[Edison Award]] in the ''Instrumental'' category for ''Caverna Magica''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The International Who's Who in Popular Music 2002|last = Gregory|first = Andy|publisher = Europa Publications|year = 2002|isbn = 9781857431612|location = London|pages = 252|url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gZIjT8PgJMEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, the album ''[[White Winds]]'' entered the American billboard chart.&lt;ref&gt;Billboard [http://www.billboard.com/artist/279085/andreas-vollenweider/chart chart-listing] for Andreas Vollenweider.&lt;/ref&gt; Released through [[CBS Masterworks]] in North America, his records remained on catalogue,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; clocking up to six-figure sales.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Vollenweider embarked on his first American tour in November of that year, making his debut at the [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theatre]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FCUEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title = Billboard Magazine|last = |first = |date = November 10, 1986|journal = Billboard Magazine|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = }}
&lt;/ref&gt; It was presented by [[Carly Simon]] who had come across his music a year earlier. She explained that "I knew I had discovered something that was going to change me in a wonderful way, I became so obsessed with his music that anyone who came to my house was introduced to it within the first 10 or 15 minutes".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Through CBS she got in contact with the artist and arranged for his American debut. As his instrumental tracks were generally deemed unsuitable for radio, he largely relied on word-of-mouth in gathering an international following.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Vollenweider spent much of 1985 on tour, promoting the ''White Winds'' album with his five-piece band.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/19/arts/weekender-guide.html|title = Weekender Guide-Friday Electric Harp Sounds|date = April 19, 1985|accessdate = |website = nytimes.com|publisher = New York Times|last = Bennetts|first = Leslie}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shows were described as a new age experience that combined the use of lights and dry ice while Vollenweider appeared as a "white-clad figure who's poised to drive the audience wild with a harp".&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20091442,00.html|title = This Twang Is Bound for Glory: Andreas Vollenweider, the Maestro of Mellow, Has Made the Harp Hip|date = August 5, 1985|accessdate = |website = People.com|publisher = People Magazine|last = Russell|first = Lisa}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, ''[[Down to the Moon|Down To The Moon]]'', which had been originally recorded and released in 1984, received a [[Grammy Award]]. This was followed by tours in Canada, the United States, thirteen European countries, Japan, and Australia. When he composed the music of, and recorded, the dynamic album ''Dancing With The Lion'' in 1988 and 1989, Vollenweider opened his project, for the first time in his career, to numerous guests from a wide range of musical genres. He directed and produced two award-winning videos, one of which was for the title selection; for both videos, he contributed to the storyline, the choreography, and set/costume designs. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==== 1990s ====
Vollenweider's double album ''The Trilogy'' (1990), consisted of a selection of the first three albums (''Behind The Gardens'', ''[[Caverna Magica]]'', and ''[[White Winds]]'') and previously unreleased material. In 1991, he followed up with ''[[Book of Roses]]'', which included symphonic orchestral elements for the first time. In 1992, he participated in a benefit show for Chernobyl's children on Moscow's [[Red Square]]. The same year, he won the World Music Award in Monaco. In 1993-94, he produced his first album including vocals. The 1993–94 album ''Eolian Minstrel'' featured contributions from American singers [[Carly Simon]] and [[Eliza Gilkyson]]. The release was followed by worldwide tours. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In 1994, he performed at the Pavarotti and Friends event in [[Modena]], Italy, where he played duets with operatic lyric tenor [[Luciano Pavarotti]] (a native of Modena) and Canadian rock balladeer [[Bryan Adams]]. After conducting tours and open-air shows in Europe and the United States, in 1995 he played in Latin America for the first time. 1995–97 saw Vollenweider playing a series of shows in remarkable locations: a tour of Polish castles, a show with Italian singer/songwriter [[Zucchero]] at the 2500 m high location (at -8° Celsius) of [[Brunico]] in the Southern Alps, and in a giant volcanic cave at [[Lanzarote]]'s Festival Musica Visual. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In 1998, Vollenweider began the recording of ''Kryptos,'' a work for symphonic orchestras and guest virtuosos from all over the world. He initiated a symphonic live project which he called ''Wolkenstein''. In 1999, he returned to free improvisation and intimate musical dialogues with his album ''COSMOPOLY'' He invited friends, including American vocal acrobat [[Bobby McFerrin]], Brazilian cult poet and singer [[Milton Nascimento]], South-African ethno-jazz pianist [[Abdullah Ibrahim]], the 74-year-old Armenian duduk legend [[Djivan Gasparyan]], Galician bag-pipe and whistle virtuoso [[Carlos Núñez Muñoz]], the American singer-songwriter [[Carly Simon]], and American blues-trombone master [[Ray Anderson (musician)|Ray Anderson]], from all over the globe to create “world music”.

==== 2000s ====
Throughout 2000, he traveled with the ''COSMOPOLY'' project in Europe.  Its changing configuration of musicians — almost daily — enabled Vollenweider to follow the open concept of the album. In New York City, he and his friends played two concerts for the United States release.  Carly Simon joined the group, as did [[Mindy Jostyn]], [[Carlos Núñez Muñoz|Carlos Núñez]], Djivan Gasparyan, [[XiaoJing Wang]] and [[Walter Keiser]].  Concerts in Brazil — with [[Milton Nascimento]] and composer/pianist [[Wagner Tiso]] — followed.  In 2001, Vollenweider performed in Bali (Indonesia) at the international conference "song of convergence" with Balinese musicians. He began writing the "symphonic novel" ''Tales of Kira Kutan'', which premiered at the Warsaw Film Music Festival 2001, with the orchestra [[Sinfonia Varsowia]] ([[Yehudi Menuhin]]), conducted by co-orchestrator [[André Bellmont]]. Returning to his native Switzerland, Vollenweider premiered ''Carte blanche'' at the AVO Festival in Basel, where his guests, in addition to a mini orchestra, included [[Abdullah Ibrahim]] and [[David Lindley (musician)|David Lindley]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In 2002, he performed at the Budapest Spring Festival in Hungary. Performances of the symphonies ''Tales of Kira Kutan'' and ''Wolkenstein'' at the Festival "Live at Sunset" in Zurich, with Sinfonia Varsovia, followed, as did a European summer tour, with the newly formed AVAF-mini orchestra, that included a performance at the "Big Chill Festival" in England and continued that fall. It was around this time that he collaborated with German film composer [[Hans Zimmer]], in Los Angeles, on the music score for the movie ''[[Tears of the Sun]]'' (starring [[Bruce Willis]] and [[Monica Bellucci]]). In 2003, he continued his work with Zimmer. A performance followed, with his mini orchestra, in [[Johannesburg]] and at the "North Sea Festival" in [[Cape Town]]. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In 2004 and 2005, AVAF continued to increase touring activities in Europe. At this time, Vollenweider's entire catalogue was re-mastered and re-released on new record labels worldwide (USA/Canada: www.kinkoumusic.com; international: www.edel.com). A compilation, ''The Best of "Magic Harp'', was released in the United States and Canada, and ''The Storyteller'' was released in Europe. A four-hour DVD was also produced. He played for the Dalai Lama, when the latter paid a visit in Zurich. In 2005, he released the album ''VOX''. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In the first three months of 2006, following extensive touring in Europe, Vollenweider conducted his first tour of the US in over ten years, touring from coast to coast. At that time, he also released his first DVD, ''The Magical Journeys of Andreas Vollenweider'', which contained almost four hours of live concerts, documentaries, interviews. During the summer of that year, he recorded a new album, titled ''Midnight Clear'', in which he again collaborated with Carly Simon. (See above for his previous collaborations with her.) The last three months of 2006 saw Vollenweider touring in Europe, in addition to his release of ''Midnight Clear'' on a worldwide basis and that of the DVD ''The Magical Journeys of Andreas Vollenweider'' in the rest of the world. 2007 saw Vollenweider draw his third nomination for a Grammy Award for the soundtrack album of the current DVD release ''The Magical Journeys of Andreas Vollenweider''. Concerts in Europe and the United States followed, as did, in September of that year, the release of the two-CD double album ''Andreas Vollenweider &amp; Friends - 25 Years Live'', which covered the period from 1982 to 2007. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In 2008, during his composition of the music for, and his recording of, the album ''A I R'', Vollenweider was a guest performer at the celebration concert for the 80th birthday of Armenian [[duduk]] legend [[Jivan Gasparyan]].

==== 2010s ====
In 2010, Vollenweider gave concerts in Eastern and Western Europe. In June, he undertook a special concert project, which he titled ''The Watercourse Way,'' at the Shanghai Centre in Shanghai, China, as part of [[Expo 2010]]. A "Dream Concert" of the extended AVAF followed in August, as did the "Dancing With The Lion Orchestra" concert on the shore of Lake Zurich; it featured a gathering of Vollenweider's musical friends from all corners of the world. In 2011, three decades after his first concert, he accepted the invitation of Montreux Jazz Festival founder Claude Nobs to perform an exclusive jubilee concert, on 7 July, at the 45th such Festival, titled "30 Years Andreas Vollenweider &amp; Friends". It featured special guests [[Richard Bona]] and [[Raul Midon]].

In 2012, he played at the farewell concert for Claude Nobs, who had died in January of that year.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} In the same year Vollenweider was granted the Swiss Music Award for "Outstanding Achievement Award" for his continuing life's work. On Christmas Eve, Swiss Television broadcasts the first major documentary devoted to Vollenweider, in which filmmaker Cristina Karrer shows impressing and touching sequences recorded in October 2010 in South Africa. In May 2012 Andreas Vollenweider lends his name to a campaign by ROKPA, a charity he has been working with for decades. Children who had once lived on the streets in Kathmandu, Nepal, visit eight Swiss cities to tell their moving stories using theatre, dance and music, with a changing roster of Swiss musical guests and an equally celebrated line-up of TV moderators.

== Style ==
His style has been described as weaving "elements of European classical and folk music, Third World vocal and percussive effects and natural sound effects into cyclical suites".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Vollenweider is perceived as one of the purveyors of the [[New-age music|New Age]] genre, although his earlier recordings appeared on the jazz Billboard chart. The composer found that "what I am doing is really a very old thing, a very 'old age' thing, because I'm doing what people have been doing for thousands of years'.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Vollenweider resides near [[Zurich]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Activism===
In the 1980s, Vollenweider was described as someone whose "politics run to the left, including support for [[Amnesty International]] and [[Greenpeace]]".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19860831&amp;id=Vw4iAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=aKcFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5312,5239891|title = Andreas Vollenweider gives harp new image.|last = Hunt|first = Charles|date = August 31, 1986|journal = Reading Eagle |accessdate = October 3, 2014|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is an outspoken [[Pacifism|pacifist]] and follower of the principles of non-violent conflict management of [[Mahatma Gandhi]].&lt;ref name="Andreas Vollenweider"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.vollenweider.com| website= vollenweider.com| title= Andreas Vollenweider website| date= | access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20441">'''Bibi Khānoom Astarābādi'''&lt;ref&gt;''Bibi'' (بی بی) means Matron, "a married woman especially one characterized by dignity, staid discreet behaviour, and plump motherly appearance" (''[[OED]]''), Venerable lady or Grandmother. ''Khatoon'' (خاتون) is a variant of the word ''Khanoom'' (خانوم), or ''Khanom'' (خانم). Any one of these three words (in particular the latter one) is often added to a woman's name in token of respect; it therefore need not be part of the official name of a woman. The official use of ''Khatoon'' is rare, if not obsolete, in the present-day Iran, and of the remaining two, ''Khanom'' is formal and ''Khanoom'' rather colloquial. The words ''Khatoon'', ''Khanoom'' and ''Khanom'', the feminine forms of the word ''Khan'', are of [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] origin.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Astarabadi'' (استرآبادی) refers to the people of ''Astarabad'' (استرآباد), the modern city of [[Gorgan]] and the capital of the [[Golestan Province]] of [[Iran]].&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-fa|بی بی خانم استرآبادی}})&amp;lrm; (1858/59–1921) was a notable [[Demography of Iran|Iranian]] writer, [[satirist]], and one of the pioneering figures in the women's movement of Iran.

Bibi Khatoon Astarabadi was born to the family of ''Mohammad Baqer Khan Astarabadi'', one of the notable men of Astarabad (the present-day [[Gorgan]]), and ''Khadijeh Khanom'' (خديجه خانم), known as&lt;ref&gt;''Bāji'' means both Female servant, and Sister. In the latter case it is a variant of the word ''Ābji'', Sister. The writer of these lines is not familiar with the etymology of these words, however it is disconcertingly plausible that at some point in history parents and/or brothers may have come to see their daughters and/or sisters respectively as female servants in the household. What is more likely, however, is that ''Bāji'' simply means ''Sister'' and that its meaning as ''Female servant'' may be attributable to the fact that through referring to a female servant as ''Bāji'' one has intended, and intends, to be familial and convey the implicit verbal assurance that she would not be subjected to sexual harassment by the male members of the family; it is rather common in Iran that one conveys a similar statement by addressing a member of the opposite sex as ''brother'' or ''sister'', as the case may be (when used inappropriately or in excess, such use may be viewed as patronising however).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mollah Bāji'' (ملاباجی), one of the companions of ''Shokuh ol-Saltaneh'' (شکوه السلطنه), wife to [[Nasser al-Din Shah Qajar]]. The title ''Mollah Bāji'' (see ''[[Mullah|Mollah]]'') is indicative that she must have been educated and in charge of more than the daily household chores of Shah's Court. Indeed, she has been in charge of the education of the children in the court of Nasser al-Din Shah.

At the age of 22, Bibi Khatoon married ''Musa Khan Vaziri'' who was a prominent official in the ''[[Persian Cossack Brigade]]''. They had seven children, of whom the most distinguished are ''[[Ali-Naqi Vaziri|Colonel Ali-Naqi Vaziri]]'' (musicologist, composer, a celebrated player of the [[Tar (lute)|tar]], and the founder of the Academy of Music of Iran as well of Iran's National Orchestra), and ''Hasan Vaziri'' (an artistic painter).&lt;ref&gt;''Bibi Khanom Astarabadi (Gorgani)'', A short biography of Bibi Khatoon Astarabadi (in Persian), containing some transcripted material from an interview by ''Deutsche Welle'' with Dr Mah-Laghā Mallah (دكتر مه لقا ملاح), maternal granddaughter of Bibi Khatoon Astarabadi ([http://www.shomaliha.com/zanan/bibi.html Shomaliha.com]).&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Mah-Laghā Mallah (دكتر مه لقا ملاح), founder and director of Iran's "Women's Society against Environmental Pollution"  (founded in 1992 to educate children and mothers, as well as state's officials, about dangers of environmental pollution)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Iran Initiative'', The Fellowship of Reconciliation (FOR) - For a World of Peace, Justice and Nonviolence, Report 6, May 2006 |url=http://www.forusa.org/programs/iran/may06-6.htm |publisher=Forusa.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711145614/https://www.forusa.org/programs/iran/may06-6.htm |archivedate=11 July 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the maternal granddaughter of Bibi Khatoon Astarabadi.&lt;ref&gt;For an interview, made in 2006 by ''Deutsche Welle'', with Dr Mah-Laghā Mallah, see External Links.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bibi Khatoon was one of the influential figures in the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution|Iranian constitutional revolution]] in the late 19th and the early 20th century. She founded the first school for girls (named ''The School for Girls'' &amp;mdash; دبستان دوشیزگان) in the modern history of Iran and wrote numerous articles in defence of the right of girls to receive universal education. Her articles appeared in such newspapers as ''Tamaddon'' (تمدن - Civilization), ''Habl al-Matin'' (حبل المتين - Firm Rope) and ''Majles'' (مجلس - Parliament). Bibi Khatoon is also known for her book ''Ma'ayeb al-Rejal'' (معايب الرجال - Failings of Men),&lt;ref&gt;The extant translation of the title ''Ma'ayeb al-Rejal'' (معايب الرجال) as ''Vices of Men'', or even ''The Vices of Men'', is incorrect when the contents of the book are disregarded. The word ''Ma'ayeb'' (معايب), or ''Oyoub'' (عیوب), is the plural of the Persian (in fact [[Arabic language|Arabic]]) word ''Eyb'' (عیب), which refers to a shortcoming or a failing, rather than a vice ''per se''. To clarify, according to ''OED'', ''Failing'' means "A defect of character; a weakness", whereby ''Failings'' is seen to be an apt choice for ''Ma'ayeb''. In contrast, according to the same dictionary, ''Vice'' means "Extreme moral corruption; depravity; evil; grossly immoral or degrading habits or conduct". The word ''Fesq'' (فسق) would be appropriately translated as ''Vice''. Only through taking the contents of the book into account, can one consider ''Vices'' as an appropriate translation of ''Ma'ayeb''. The books in section ''Further reading'' should be illuminating.&lt;/ref&gt; which was a critical response to the pamphlet ''Ta'deeb al-Nesvan'' (تاديب النسوان - Edification of Women)&lt;ref&gt;In general, ''Ta'deeb'' (تاديب) also means ''Disciplinary punishment'', reflecting the implicit assumption that the latter would lead to edification.&lt;/ref&gt; by an anonymous author. ''Ma'ayeb al-Rejal'' was published in 1895, eleven years before the inauguration of Iran's system of constitutional monarchy in 1906 by the decree of [[Mozzafar al-Din Shah|Mozaffar al-Din Shah Qajar]].&lt;ref&gt;''Bibi Khanom Astarabadi (Gorgani)'', ''ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt; This book is considered by some as the first declaration of women's rights in the recent history of Iran.

==''The School for Girls'' (دبستان دوشیزگان)==
Founded in 1907 at the residential home of Bibi Khatoon in [[Tehran]], it was attended both by young girls and their mothers as well as grandmothers, for some of the latter it may have been a unique opportunity for obtaining formal education for the first time in their lives. The school was equipped with such facilities as may be taken for granted from the present-day perspective (such as desks), however it should be borne in mind that this school provision was part of Bibi Khatoon's residential home and not part of a purpose-built educational facility.&lt;ref&gt;''The School for Girls'' (مدرسه دوشيزگان). A programme celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Constitutional Revolution of Iran with an interview with Dr Mah-Laghā Mallah (دكتر مه لقا ملاح), maternal granddaughter of Bibi Khatoon Astarabadi, 11 August 2006 ([http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2411784,00.html Deutsche Welle]). The date 1907, indicated above, is somewhat uncertain to the present writer; according to Dr Mah-Laghā Mallah, "This school was established before the [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution|Constitutional Revolution]] (انقلاب مشروط)", which took place between 1905 and 1911; the [[Majlis of Iran|First Majlis]] was elected in 1906, to be made defunct through the [[coup d'état]] of [[Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar|Mohammad-Ali Shah Qajar]] in June 1908.&lt;/ref&gt; This clearly testifies to Bibi Khatoon's wholehearted dedication to the cause of women's education in Iran.

''The School for Girls''

A new school, named ''The School for Girls'' [دبستان دوشیزگان], has been opened near the old gate of Mahmmadieh, the Hāji Mohammad-Hossein market. This school consists of a large courtyard and numerous rooms equipped with all necessary school outfits.

For the opening of this school five female teachers [معلمه] have been appointed, each  responsible for one subject, such as ''Nokhost-nameh''&lt;ref&gt;According to Ms Farnaz Seifi (private communication), ''Nokhost-nameh'' consisted of a series of books, written by Matavous Khan Mālekiāns, that were commonly used at elementary schools of the time in Iran. These books were further supplemented with manuals for teachers.&lt;/ref&gt; [نخست نامه], Writing/Calligraphy [مشق قلم], History of Iran [تاریخ ایران], Reading [قرائت], Cookery book [کتاب طباخی], Law [قانون], Religion [مذهب], Geography [جغرافیا], Science of Arithmetic [علم حساب]. Teaching will be adapted to the learning ability of each girl or woman.

In addition, a location has been set aside for teaching in manual arts, such as knitting [کاموا دوزی], gold embroidery [زری دوزی], silk embroidery [خامه دوزی], sewing [خیاطی], etc., and all these teachers are womenfolk [طایفه اناثیه] and with the exception of an aged porter [پیرمرد قاپوچی], no other man will be in the School.

Students between the ages of seven and twelve will be accepted. Elementary class [اطاق ابتدائی] is for fifteen ''[[Iranian qiran|qeran]]'' per month, practical class [اطاق عملی] for twenty-five ''qeran'' per month. Discount is offered to those in reduced circumstances [فقرأ]. For every two students [from the same family] one will be accepted free of charge. It is hoped that thousands of schools such as this one are to be inaugurated in our dear motherland [وطن عزیز ما].

([http://imp.lss.wisc.edu/~aoliai/historypage/thenewyearhaftsin.htm Department of Languages and Cultures of Asia, The University of Wisconsin, Madison, United States of America].) Briefly, there have been seven ''Emshās'pandān''s, namely, ''Ahurā Mazdā'' (or ''Ormazd'') and its great Holy Angles known as ''Bahman'', ''Ordi'behesht'', ''Shahri'var'', ''Es'fand'', ''Khor'dād'' and ''Amor'dād''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Translation from [[Persian language|Persian]] by --BF.&lt;/ref&gt;
(Published in the ''Majles'' daily newspaper of 28 March 1907).&lt;ref&gt;Ms Farnarz Seifi, private communication.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The subjects taught at this school consisted of, in alphabetic order, [[Arabic language]], [[Arithmetic]], [[Cookery]], [[Geography]], [[History]], [[Law]], [[Music]], [[Persian literature]], and [[Religion]], to name but some. It is relevant to point out that in 1936, almost thirty years after the establishment of ''The School for Girls'', 12 women were for the first time admitted to [[University of Tehran]], who entered all faculties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Massoume Price |title=History of Ancient Medicine in Mesopotamia and Iran |publisher=Iran Chamber Society |year= 2001 |url= http://www.iranchamber.com/history/articles/ancient_medicine_mesopotamia_iran.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the official data provided by Iran's ministry of higher education, at the turn of the present century some 70% of all students in higher education were women; according to the same data, however, by the same time only 20% of the [[PhD]] positions at academic institutions were occupied by women.&lt;ref&gt;These statements need to be verified, as the present writer is not in possession of the original reports containing these data and relies solely on secondary sources.&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical site of ''The School for Girls''  survived in its original form for some 22 years following the death of Bibi Khatoon in 1921; in 1943 this site was sold (for 25,000 [[Iranian toman|Tumans]]) by the extant members of Bibi Khatoon's direct family.&lt;ref&gt;''The School for Girls'' (مدرسه دوشيزگان), ''ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- [To be extended - for instance on the subject of the public protests against Bibi Khatoon's school and her sufferings at the hands of those objecting to this school; for instance, the school was originally closed only after one month of its initial opening.] --&gt;

==On ''Ta'deeb al-Nesvan'' (تاديب النسوان - Edification of Women)==
According to [[Ebrahim Nabavi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ebrahim Nabavi |title=Bibi Khanom and the Unknown Prince (بی بی خانم و شاهزاده گمنام) |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |language=Persian |date=26 July 2006 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/worldnews/story/2006/07/060722_mv-constitution-en-bibikhatun.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The present writer has consulted neither ''Ta'deeb al-Nesvan'' nor ''Ma'ayeb al-Rejal''. Some familiarity with this genre of the literature of the time suggests however that ''Ta'deeb al-Nesvan'' may not have been more than a prank by a member of Iran's aristocracy of the time.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ta'deeb al-Nesvan'', published in 1288 [[Hijri year|AH]] (1895), is a small booklet authored by one of the princes of the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] Court, "who must have feared his wife so greatly that he has not had the courage to put his name on it as its author" (in other words, the author of the book is an anonymous Prince). A short summary of the main recommendations in this book, aimed at the "edification" of women, is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Ebrahim Nabavi, ''ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;
#Woman is a being who similar to a child must be educated by a man.
#Salvation of woman is conditional upon her absolute obedience to her husband.
#Woman must never ask a favour from her husband; it is up to husband to deign to confer favours to his wife.
#The duty of woman at home is provision of conditions that are conducive to her husband's tranquility.
#The aim of matrimony consists of gratification of the husband's sexual desires.
#Woman must at all times be abashed, except in bed.
#Woman must not speak during meals.
#Woman must, like an ailing individual, walk slowly.
: Etc.

The Vices of Men (Ma'ayib al-Rijal) (1887),a pungent satire, is in fact an answer to an earlier work entitled The Education of Women (Ta'dib al-Niswan (translated into English by E. Powys Mathers in his Eastern Love, vol.iii, London, 1904). The anonymous writer of the latter seems to be a chauvinistic prince, and following the medieval tradition that was not accepted by Shia Muslim clerics.  Bibi Khanum's answers to such absurdities are scathingly indignant. She writes that "genius of the world and unique writer of our times" seems strangely bereft of his senses. "He should have first corrected his own vices and then given us advice. One who has no share of existence, how can he inspire life? ...He regards himself as 'Westernized' and 'civilized,' but in fact, he is not even 'half-civilized.'(سیویلیزه و نیم ویلیزه) Does he not know that Europeans treat their women like flowers, and women freely associate with men?"  The indication that the author was westernised clearly indicates, he must have been from the so-called western influenced intellectuals.  Strangely enough at the time women had very few rights in the west in comparison to Iran and only in some parts of the western world had been able to claim their rights to inheritance.

These two works were published by Hasan Javadi as "Two Qajar Essays on Men and Women: Ta'dib al-Nivan and Ma'ayib al-Rijal" in Washington in 1992.

==Response of Bibi Khatoon: ''Ma'ayeb al-Rejal'' (معايب الرجال - Failings of Men)==
According to Ebrahim Nabavi,&lt;ref&gt;Ebrahim Nabavi, ''ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ma'ayeb al-Rejal'' consists of two main parts, in one of which Bibi Khatoon responds directly to the contents of ''Ta'deeb al-Nesvan'', and in the other she describes the conditions prevailing in the men's social gatherings of her time. True to her usual style of writing, Bibi Khatoon's tone in this book is derisive. [To be extended at a later occasion.]

==Life==
Being a native, he grew up and was raised in [[Polangui, Albay|Polangui]], in the province of [[Albay]]. At the time he was implicated, he was already pursuing a career as a successful professional,&lt;ref name = "PINOYFOLKTALES"/&gt; and commercial&lt;ref name = "NAGA.GOV.PH"/&gt; photographer, thereby maintaining his photographic studio at [[Nueva Cáceres|Nueva Caceres]], now [[Naga City, Camarines Sur|Naga City]].

==Involvement in the Philippine Revolution==
The onset of Philippine revolution on the last part of 1896 raised concerns among the Spanish authorities of its possible outbreak in the Bicol region. Thus, those who were liberal-minded were bitterly persecuted on grounds of not just holding separatist ideologies but on advocating the overthrowing of Spain's authority in the Philippines.&lt;ref name = "PINOYFOLKTALES"/&gt; These persecutions involved businessmen and professionals, mostly adherents to Masonry and members of the clergy.&lt;ref name = "NAGA.GOV.PH"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "PINOYFOLKTALES"/&gt; Among the arrested was Vicente Lukban, head of Masonic chapter, ''Triangulo Bikol'', belonging to the Masonic lodge, ''La Luz Oriente'', which, upon interrogation, implicated Jacob as one of the active member and supporter of the [[Katipunan]].&lt;ref name = "PINOYFOLKTALES"/&gt;

==Arrest, trials and execution==
On September 19, 1896, he, along with many others accused with rebellion and sedition, he was arrested. Upon arrest, each of them were hung by their thumbs of fingers and beaten up, starved and insulted.&lt;ref name = "PINOYFOLKTALES"/&gt; Then they were sent and brought to Manila, for trial by the Provincial Junta of Camarines Sur headed by then Governor Julian Ocampo,&lt;ref name = "NAGA.GOV.PH"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "INQUIRER.NET"/&gt; on board steamer ''Isarog'' and imprisoned in ''Bilibid'' only to be tortured again. Even so, they were tortured and all, Jacob remained an exemplary as "the prisoner who suffered the most torture with great fortitude".&lt;ref name = "KAHIMYANG"/&gt; After they were sentenced on accusations against them, on January 4, 1897, 5 days after [[Jose Rizal|Jose Rizal’s]] execution, Jacob, along with 10 others were marched to the site and was executed with firing squad,&lt;ref name = "NAGA.GOV.PH"/&gt; as their families stood watch amongst the crowd. Then the Spanish authorities immediately ordered the families to bury them on that day to prevent  outpouring sympathizers.&lt;ref name = "INQUIRER.NET"/&gt;

==Commemoration==

'''Gertrude van der Oosten''' (or '''Gertrude of Delft''') was born in Voorburcht in the [[County of Holland]], whose location is unclear, and died at [[Delft]], 6 January 1358. She was a Dutch [[Beguine]] and was considered a [[mysticism|mystic]], who had received the [[Stigmata]].

==Life==

Gertrude was born of peasant parents, and entered into [[domestic service]] at Delft. Her surname of ''van Ooten'', or "of the East", came from her custom of singing a hymn which began: ''Het daghet in den Oosten'', i.e., "Daylight breaks in the East", which she is thought to have composed herself. 

After living a pious life for many years, Gertrude obtained admission into the [[beguinage]] in [[Delft]]. Here, though not a [[nun]], or bound by [[religious vows]], she profited by the ample opportunities for [[contemplation]] afforded by life in this community. She had great devotion to the mysteries of the [[Incarnation]], especially to the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] of Christ. She is believed to have received the [[Stigmata]]. She begged God that this grace might be withdrawn, and her prayer was granted to the degree that the blood ceased to flow, but the marks of the Stigmata remained. At the same time she displayed the gift of [[prophecy]].

Gertrude died on the [[feast day]] of the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] and was buried in the Church of St. Hippolytus in Delft, as that beguinage did not have its own church or cemetery. Her name has never been inscribed in the ''[[Roman Martyrology]]'', though she is commemorated in various others, and her [[cult (religious practice)#Roman Catholic ''cultus''|''cultus'']] is a purely local one.

'''St. Illtud''' (also spelled '''Illtyd''', '''Eltut''', and, in [[Latin]], '''Hildutus'''), also known as '''Illtud Farchog''' "Illtud the Knight", is venerated as the founder-[[abbot]] and teacher of the divinity school known as [[Cor Tewdws]], located in [[Llantwit Major|Llanilltud Fawr]] (Llantwit Major) in the [[Wales|Welsh]] county of [[Glamorgan]]. He founded the monastery and college in the 6th century, and the school is believed to be Britain’s earliest centre of learning.&lt;ref name="Galilee Chapel Project"&gt;{{cite web|last=Galilee Chapel Project|title=Home|url=http://www.illtudsgalileechapel.org.uk/|work=Galilee Chapel Project: St. Iltud's Church, Llantwit Major|accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At its height, it had over 1000 pupils and schooled many of the great saints of the age, including [[Saint David]] of Wales, [[Gildas]] the Historian, and [[Samson of Dol]].&lt;ref name=rudge&gt;Rudge, F.M. (1910). St. Illtyd. In The Catholic Encyclopedia. New York: Robert Appleton Company. Retrieved 1 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hagiography==
St. Illtud was popular among the very ancient Celts, but there are few dependable sources about his life story.&lt;ref name="Saints Alive"&gt;{{cite web|last=Father Robert F.|first=McNamara|title=St. Illtud|url=http://kateriirondequoit.org/index.cfm/resources/saints-alive/ignatius-ivo/st-illtud/|work=Saints Alive|publisher=St. Kateri Tekakwitha Parish|accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest mention of St. Illtud is in the ''Vita Sancti Sampsonis'', written in Dol, Brittany, about 600 AD. According to this account, Illtud was the disciple of Bishop [[Germanus of Auxerre]] in north-central France. According to the St. Sampson biography, Illtud was the most accomplished of all the Britons, and was well versed in the scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, as well as every type of philosophy, including geometry, rhetoric, grammar, and arithmetic.&lt;ref name="St. Illtud"/&gt; He was also "gifted with the power of foretelling future events". It appears that he was an educated Briton living shortly after Rome's departure from the West.&lt;ref name=bowen&gt;[http://wbo.llgc.org.uk/en/s-ILLT-UD0-0475.html Bowen, Emrys George. "Illtud", Welsh Biography Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a rather untrustworthy later Norman ''Life of St. Illtud'', c. 1140, Illtud was the son of a Breton prince and a cousin of [[King Arthur]].&lt;ref name="Life of St. Illtud"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wade-Evans|first=A. W.|title=The Life of St. Illtud|url=http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/illtud.html|work=Vitae Sanctorum Britanniae et Genealogiae|publisher=MaryJones.us|accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to this ''Life'', Illtud's parents intended him for service in the church and had him educated in literature for this purpose. However, he forsook his religious upbringing, choosing instead to pursue a military career. He took a wife named Trynihid, and became a soldier in western Britain (now Wales), in service first to King Arthur, and then to the King Poulentus. As a result of this, he is sometimes called St. Illtud the Knight. One afternoon, he took a hunting party onto the lands of [[Cadoc]]. The party sent a message to the abbot, demanding that the abbot feed them. The abbot deemed their demand to be very rude and improper, but graciously offered them a meal anyway. Before they could enjoy the meal, the ground opened up and swallowed the whole party as just punishment for their impiety. Only Illtud was spared, and he went to St. Cadog on his knees, begging forgiveness for his sinful act. The abbot told him to give up his selfish ways and go back to his religious upbringing.&lt;ref name="Life of St. Illtud" /&gt; Inspired, Illtud gave up his wife, and became a hermit in the [[Vale of Glamorgan]] (a matrimonial detail which, like many of his alleged miracles, may be regarded as fairly dubious).&lt;ref name="Saints Alive" /&gt;

What is certain is that Illtud helped pioneer the monastic life of Wales by founding a monastery in what is now Llantwit Major. This became the first major Welsh monastic school, and was a hub of [[Celtic Christianity]] in [[Sub-Roman Britain]].&lt;ref name="St. Illtud"&gt;{{cite web|title=St. Illtud|url=http://www.illtudsgalileechapel.org.uk/britains-earliest-centre-of-learning/saint-illtud/|work=Lent with the Celtic Saints|accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Illtud's own pupils are reckoned to have included seven sons of British princes and scholars such as Saint Patrick, [[Paul Aurelian]], [[Taliesin]], Gildas and Samson of Dol. Saint David is also believed to have spent some time there.&lt;ref name="Newell1887"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newell|first=Ebenezer Josiah|title=A popular history of the ancient British church: with special reference to the church in Wales|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LcnMEvzEEGUC|accessdate=22 January 2012|year=1887|publisher=Society for promoting Christian knowledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hall1861"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Samuel Carter|title=The book of south Wales, the Wye, and the coast|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c_4HAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA252|accessdate=22 January 2012|year=1861|pages=252–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Peter N.|title=The Sacred Places of Wales: A Modern Pilgrimage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PA-0mLsrmMwC&amp;pg=PA21|accessdate=22 January 2012|date=March 2001|publisher=Wales Books|isbn=978-0-7596-0785-9|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cult and Veneration==
St. Illtud's feast day and commemoration is celebrated on 6 November.,&lt;ref&gt;''Martyrologium Romanum'', 2004, Vatican Press (Typis Vaticanis), page 609.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liturgyoffice.org.uk/Calendar/National/Wales1.shtml National Calendar for Wales], accessed 6 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; but the great 'pardon of Ildut at Locildut in Brittany is held on the last Sunday of July. According to legend, Illtud was buried west of the town of [[Brecon]], in the church of Llanilltud (sometimes called Capel Illtud, which was demolished in the late 20th century), on a mountain known as [[Mynydd Illtud]]. Near this church, there is a megalithic monument called ''Bedd Gwyl Illtyd'', or the "Grave of St. Illtud's Eve." Until comparatively recently, Illtud was honoured by the practice of ‘watching’ (keeping vigil) at this stone before his festival.&lt;ref name="Galilee Chapel Project - St. Iltud"&gt;{{cite web|title=St. Iltud|url=http://www.illtudsgalileechapel.org.uk/britains-earliest-centre-of-learning/saint-illtud/|work=Galilee Chapel Project|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Life'' tells of Illtyd's bell being recovered from the armies of King [[Edgar the Peaceful]] and of Illtyd's protecting his people against the people of yr [[Hen Ogledd]] in the time of [[William the Conqueror]]. There is also a cross, probably of the ninth century, bearing the inscription: SAMSON POSUIT HANC CRUCEM PRO ANIMA EIUS ILITET SAMSON REGIS SAMUEL ERISAR – "Samson placed his Cross here for his soul, for the soul of Illtud, Samson, Rhain, Sawyl and Ebisar".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.illtudsgalileechapel.org.uk/britains-earliest-centre-of-learning/the-celtic-crosses/ Galilee Chapel Project. Retrieved 12 Oct 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no formal evidence for a cult of Illtyd surviving from before the 11th century. However, in Celtic countries it is the names of places that tell us most about the existence and veneration of the saints during the oldest times.&lt;ref name="St. Illtud" /&gt;  The town of [[Llantwit Major|Llanilltud Fawr]] (Llantwit Major in English) where Illtud's college is located is of course named for him (Welsh: ''llan'' church enclosure + ''Illtud'' + ''mawr'' great. Literally, Illtud's great church),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Samuel|title=A Topographical Dictionary of Wales|year=1833}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and was the chief centre of the cult of St Illtud. In [[Glamorgan]] many churches are dedicated to him, first and foremost [[St Illtyd's Church, Llantwit Major]], which stands on what is believed to have been the site of the monastery. Many other places are dedicated to him is because they belonged to the Llantwit monastery.&lt;ref name="illtudsgalileechapel.org.uk"&gt;Llantwit Major site; http://www.illtudsgalileechapel.org.uk/britains-earliest-centre-of-learning/saint-illtud/&lt;/ref&gt; Near to Llantwit itself are the villages of [[Llantrithyd]], [[Llantwit Fardre]], and [[Llantrisant]] and at Newcastle and Bridgend churches are dedicated to St Illtud. Brecknockshire north of Glamorgan and the Gower area were two more centres of his cult: the church at Llanhamlach east of Brecon is dedicated to him, and lies south of a Megalithic grave called Ty Illtud, which was a site of mediaeval pilgrimage, the inside walls of the grave bearing incised crosses. The grave is thought to have been a retreat of the saint, as was a similar megalithic monument Roc'h Ildut near Coadut (Coat Ildut/Coed Illtud/ Illtud's Wood) in Brittany, sadly demolished in the 19th century. Llantrisant's three saints were Illtud, Gwynno and Tyfodwg. In Merthyr Tudful there are holy wells of Gwynno and Illtud. West of Brecon, the church of Llanilltud is on a mountain known as [[Mynydd Illtud]]. Dedications in and around Gower include Ilston, formerly Llanilltud Gwyr, Oxwich, a holy well of S. Iltut in Llanrhidian, Llanilltud Fach, or Llantwit-juxta-Neath and Pen-bre, Carmarthenshire. A 13th century church on [[Caldey Island]], [[Pembrokeshire]], is dedicated to the saint. In north Wales there is a [[Llanelltyd]] near Dolgellau. There are no dedications to St Illtud in Cornwall but many in Brittany (approximately 24 if other place-names like Aberildut are included) though they are largely confined to the ancient dioceses of Leon, Treguier and Vannes, with small outliers in the region of Saint Malo, originally in the diocese of his pupil Samson.&lt;ref name="illtudsgalileechapel.org.uk"/&gt;

John Stowe's 1603 list of the bishops of London includes an "Iltuta"&lt;ref name=stowe&gt;{{cite book|last=Stowe|first=John|authorlink=John Stowe|title=The Annales of England|p=C3|url=https://archive.org/stream/annalsofenglandt00stow#page/n61/mode/2up/|date=1605|publisher=G. Bishop &amp; T. Adams|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is sometimes conflated with Illtud.&lt;ref name=pseudodennis&gt;Parker, John. [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/dionysius/works.iii.iv.i.html ''The Works of Dionysius the Areopagite, Now First Translated into English, From the Original Greek'', Appendix: "List of Bishops".] James Parker&amp;&amp;nbsp;Co. (London), 1897.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arthurian Connections==
According to the 12th century ''Life of St. Illtud'', Illtud's father was Bicanus, a minor Breton prince, and his mother was Rieingulid, a princess and daughter of [[Amlawdd Wledig|Anblaud]], king of Lesser Britannia (Brittany). This is probably meant to be Ewyas, an area on the Herefordshire-Monmouthshire border, which retains many memories of Arthur and Illtud's family. He was alleged to be the cousin of the legendary King Arthur, serving him as a young soldier.

One medieval Welsh document names Illtud, in his knightly days, as one of the triumvirate (the others were named Cadoc and Peredur) to whom King Arthur gave custody of the [[Holy Grail]]. On this basis, some scholars have tried to identify Knight Illtud with Sir [[Galahad]].&lt;ref name="Saints Alive" /&gt;

'''Ion Ghica''' ({{IPA-ro|iˈon ˈɡika|-|Ro-Ion Ghica.ogg}}; 12 August 1816 – 7 May 1897) was a [[Romania]]n revolutionary, mathematician, diplomat and politician, who was [[Prime Minister of Romania]] five times.&lt;ref&gt;Three times after 1862 and twice between 1859 and 1862, when the United Principalities of Moldova and Wallachia had two parallel governments albeit being one single vassal state.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a full [[list of members of the Romanian Academy|member of the Romanian Academy]] and its president many times (1876-1882, 1884-1887, 1890-1893 and 1894-1895). He was the older brother and associate of [[Pantazi Ghica]], a prolific writer and politician.

==Early life and Revolution==
[[Image:Ion Ghica - Foto01.jpg|thumb|130px|left]]

He was born in [[Bucharest]], [[Wallachia]], to the prominent [[Ghica family|Ghica]] [[boyar]] family, and was the nephew of both [[Grigore Alexandru Ghica]] (who was to become [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince]] of Wallachia in the 1840s and 1850s) and [[Ion Câmpineanu]], a ''[[Carbonari]]''-inspired [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]]. His father was Dimitrie (Tache) Ghica and his mother - Maria née Câmpineanu. 
Ion Ghica was educated in Bucharest and in Western Europe, studying engineering and mathematics in Mine School of Paris (France) from 1837 to 1840.

After finishing his studies in Paris, he left for [[Moldavia]] and was involved in the failed ''Frăția'' ("Brotherhood") conspiracy of 1848, which was intended to bring about the union of Wallachia and Moldavia under one native Romanian leader, [[Mihai Sturdza|Prince Mihai Sturdza]]. Ion Ghica became a professor on geology and mineralogy  and later professor on political economy &lt;ref&gt;Anastasie Iordache, ''Ion Ghica diplomatul şi omul politic''. Editura MAJADAHONDA, Bucureşti, 1995,  p. 25, {{ISBN|973-96726-2-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;at the [[Academia Mihăileană]] which was founded by the same Prince Sturdza in [[Iași]] (future [[University of Iași]]). He is considered the first great Roumanian economist.

He joined the [[1848 Wallachian Revolution|Wallachian revolutionary]] camp, and, in the name of the [[Provisional Government]] then established in Bucharest, went to [[Istanbul]] to approach the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Imperial]] government; he, [[Nicolae Bălcescu]], and General [[Gheorghe Magheru]] were instrumental in mediating negotiations between the [[Transylvania]]n Romanian leader [[Avram Iancu]] and the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas#Revolution in the Kingdom of Hungary|Revolutionary government]] of [[Lajos Kossuth]].

==In Samos and Romania==
[[Image:Alecsandri and Ghica in Istanbul, 1855.jpeg|thumb|130px|left|Ghica (seated) and [[Vasile Alecsandri|Alecsandri]], in [[Istanbul]] (1855)]]

While in Istanbul, he was appointed [[Prince of Samos]] (1854 - 1859), where he proved his leadership skills by extirpating local [[Pirate|piracy]] (most of which was aimed at transports supplying the [[Crimean War]]). After completing the task, Ghica was awarded the honorary title of ''Prince of Samos'' by [[Ottoman Dynasty|Sultan]] [[Abd-ul-Mejid I]] in 1856.

In 1859, after the [[United Principalities|union of Moldavia and Walachia]] had been effected, [[Prince Alexandru Ioan Cuza]] asked Ion Ghica to return. Later (1866), despite being trusted by Prince Cuza, Ghica took active part in the secret grouping that secured Cuza's overthrow. He was the first prime minister under Prince of Romania (afterwards [[King of Romania]]) [[Carol I of Romania|Carol of Hohenzollern]].

Ghica is also noted as one of the first major [[Liberalism in Romania|Liberal]] figures in the [[Kingdom of Romania]], and one of the leaders of the incipient [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|Liberal Party]]. His group's [[Radicalism (historical)|radicalism]], with its boyar leadership that had engineered the defunct Revolution, surfaced as [[republicanism]] whenever Carol approached the [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880-1918)|Conservatives]]; Ghica joined the anti-dynastic movement of 1870-1871 that had surfaced with the [[Republic of Ploiești]]. The matter of the Liberals' loyalty was ultimately settled 1876, with the exceptionally long Liberal Ministry of [[Ion Brătianu]]. In 1881, Ghica was appointed Romanian [[Diplomatic rank|Minister]] in London, an office he retained until 1889; he died in [[Ghergani]], [[Dâmbovița County]].

==Works==
Beside his political distinction, Ion Ghica earned a literary reputation by writing his ''Letters'', addressed to [[Vasile Alecsandri]], his lifelong friend. Conceived and written during his residency in London, the letters depict the ancestral stage of Romanian society, as it appeared to be fading away.

He was also the author of ''Amintiri din pribegie'' ("Recollections from Exile"), in 1848, and of ''Convorbiri Economice'' ("Conversations on Economy"), dealing with major economic issues.  He was the first to advocate the favoring of local initiatives over foreign investments in industry and commerce - to a certain extent, this took the form of [[protectionism]] (a characteristic of the Liberal Party throughout the coming period, and until [[World War II]]).

'''James Lee Massey''' (February 11, 1934 – June 16, 2013)&lt;ref name=obit&gt;[http://www.itsoc.org/news-events/recent-news/james-lee-massey-dies-at-79 Obituary at IEEE Information Theory Society]&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[information theorist]] and
cryptographer, Professor [[Emeritus]] of Digital Technology at [[ETH Zurich]]. His notable work includes the application of the [[Berlekamp–Massey algorithm]] to [[linear code]]s, the design of the [[block cipher]]s [[International Data Encryption Algorithm|IDEA]] (with [[Xuejia Lai]]) and [[SAFER]], and the [[Massey-Omura cryptosystem]] (with [[Jim K. Omura]]).

==Biography==
Massey was born in [[Wauseon, Ohio]]. As a child, after the death of his father in Ohio, he moved with his mother and brother to [[Mendota, Illinois]]. At age 14, his family moved to [[Ottawa, Illinois]]. After graduating from St. Bede Academy, he entered the [[University of Notre Dame]]. He received a [[B.S.]] in [[electrical engineering]] from Notre Dame in 1956 and was granted an [[National Science Foundation|NSF]] Fellowship. After three years of military service, he began graduate studies in 1959 at [[MIT]], where he concentrated on [[coding theory]] and was awarded a [[Ph.D.]] in 1962, with [[John Wozencraft]] as his advisor. He returned to Notre Dame, where he taught electrical engineering until 1977, publishing significant research in [[convolutional code]]s and [[frame synchronization]] techniques. After a brief period at [[UCLA]], Massey accepted a position at ETH Zurich in 1980. He remained there until his retirement in 1998.

Massey died of [[colon cancer]] on June 16, 2013 in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].&lt;ref name=obit /&gt;

==Biography==
Brown was born in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] in 1969 to David John Brown, Sr.&lt;ref name="mission"&gt;{{cite web |first=Robert Craig |last=Harman |url=http://www.mission.net/france/paris/news.php?nID=2566 |title=New Details in the Jason Derek Brown Case |publisher=France Paris Mission |date=April 23, 2005 |accessdate=August 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FBI"&gt;{{cite web |first=Lindsey |last=Collom |url=http://www.azcentral.com/specials/special14/articles/1028coldcase28.html |title=FBI looking for suspect in fatal heist |publisher=''The Arizona Republic'' |date=October 28, 2005 |accessdate=August 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Laguna Beach High School]].&lt;ref name="azcentral"&gt;{{cite web |first=Sarah |last=Muensch |url=http://www.azcentral.com/specials/special14/articles/1124coldcase1124.html |title=Slayer of armored-car guard still free |publisher=''The Arizona Republic'' |date=November 24, 2006 |accessdate=August 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown speaks fluent [[French language|French]] and has a [[master's degree]] in [[international business]]. Brown served a mission for [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] in [[Paris]] from 1988 to 1990.&lt;ref name="mission"/&gt; Between 1990 and 2004, he resided in several places in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], California, including  [[Dana Point, California|Dana Point]] and the [[Corona del Mar, Newport Beach, California|Corona del Mar]] neighborhood of [[Newport Beach, California|Newport Beach]].

Brown owned two businesses based in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], Toys Unlimited and On The Doorstep Advertising, both of which were operated out of his Utah home.&lt;ref name="suspect"&gt;{{cite web |first=Emily |last=Bittner |url=http://www.azcentral.com/community/ahwatukee/articles/1207armoredcar07.html |title=Murder suspect named in killing of armored car guard |publisher=''The Arizona Republic'' |date=December 7, 2004 |accessdate=August 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown had been employed as a toy salesman and [[golf equipment]] importer&lt;ref name="ambush"&gt;{{cite web |title=Suspect In Phoenix Death Hits Most Wanted List |url=http://ktar.com/?sid=668578&amp;nid=6 |publisher=[[KPHO-TV]] |date=December 10, 2007 |accessdate=May 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to support his luxurious lifestyle and expensive tastes, such as cars, motorbikes and boats.&lt;ref name="azcentral"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foxnews"&gt;{{cite web |first=Melissa |last=Underwood |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,329367,00.html |title=Wanted for the Murder of an Armored Car Guard: Jason Derek Brown |publisher=''Fox News'' |date=February 7, 2008 |accessdate=August 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown portrayed himself as a [[wealth]]y man, despite the fact he had [[Default (finance)|default]]ed on at least one large loan and was racking up tens of thousands of dollars of debt in 2004.&lt;ref name="foxnews"/&gt;

In November 2004, Brown took a firearms class. He bought a .45-caliber [[Glock pistol]] days before the class at Totally Awesome Guns &amp; Range in Salt Lake City. Brown passed a [[background check]], and as part of the class, was [[fingerprint]]ed and his prints were sent to state and federal authorities.&lt;ref name="suspect"/&gt; Brown's instructor, Clark Aposhian, described him as "an obnoxious student" who was inexperienced with firearms. Brown accidentally fired a round into a truck during a practice shooting. He paid approximately $1,300 in damages to the car owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/KNTV_20130805_050000_Dateline_NBC|title=Dateline NBC : KNTV : August 4, 2013 10:00pm-11:01pm PDT : Free Streaming : Internet Archive|work=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, Brown was living in an [[Ahwatukee, Phoenix, Arizona|Ahwatukee]], [[Arizona]] hotel near an [[AMC Theatres|AMC movie theater]].&lt;ref name="sighting"&gt;{{cite web |first=Lindsey |last=Collom |url=http://www.azcentral.com/community/ahwatukee/articles/1210ar-armored10Z14.html |title=Slaying suspect's been seen |publisher=''The Arizona Republic'' |date=December 10, 2004 |accessdate=August 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was captured on surveillance tape having a conversation with another man in the hotel lobby. The man is considered to be a possible accomplice or witness; however, his identity remains unknown.&lt;ref name="azcentral"/&gt;

==Robbery and murder==
On November 29, 2004, Robert Keith Palomares, a 24-year-old [[armored truck]] guard, was carrying the weekend deposits outside the AMC theater at 4915 E. Ray Road&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt; in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. At approximately 10 a.m., a hooded gunman ambushed and shot Palomares with a .45-caliber semiautomatic Glock. Five out of six bullets fired struck him in the head.&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foxnews"/&gt; Palomares was armed, but did not have time to defend himself.&lt;ref name="suspect"/&gt; The gunman took a bag of money containing $56,000 in cash, fled into a nearby alley and left on a bicycle.&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt; Palomares was transported to Good Samaritan Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.&lt;ref name="ambush"/&gt;

Witnesses initially described the shooter as a 25- to 30-year-old [[Hispanic]] man. Authorities recovered the bicycle and fingerprints, and instead subsequently linked the [[Caucasian race|caucasian]] Brown to the murder.&lt;ref name="murder"/&gt; He was soon considered a prime suspect in the case&lt;ref name="slaying"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&amp;p_multi=DSNB&amp;d_place=DSNB&amp;p_theme=newslibrary2&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=106DD82866B5DA23&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D |title=Suspect in slaying has Utah ties |publisher=''[[The Deseret News]]'' |date=December 8, 2004 |format=Fee required |accessdate=July 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[arrest warrant]] was issued on December 4 by [[Maricopa County]] Superior Court charging Brown with [[first degree murder]] and [[armed robbery]]. Brown was also charged with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution in a federal arrest warrant issued on December 6 by the [[United States District Court for the District of Arizona]].&lt;ref name="mostwanted"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/local/articles/1211mostwanted1211.html |title=Suspect in Phoenix murder now among FBI Most Wanted |publisher=''Associated Press'' |date=December 11, 2007 |accessdate=August 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigators have considered that a possible motive for Brown to commit these crimes could have been his desperate financial situation.&lt;ref name="foxnews"/&gt;

==Fugitive==
After Brown was identified as a suspect, he fled from Arizona to [[Henderson, Nevada|Henderson]], [[Nevada]].&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foxnews"/&gt; Brown traveled to [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] and swapped his [[BMW]] for a black [[Cadillac Escalade]] he had in storage. He traveled to Orange County, California, staying there with relatives until December 6, 2004, when [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents carrying out an arrest warrant missed him by two hours.&lt;ref name="foxnews"/&gt; Brown used his credit card at a gas station in [[South Orange County]], went to [[San Diego]] near the [[Mexican border]], and then traveled to [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]]. After this, FBI stated that Brown became a "ghost" and went completely [[off-the-grid]].

On January 16, 2005, authorities found Brown's Cadillac in a long-term parking lot at [[Portland International Airport]].&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt; While in Portland, Brown mailed a package containing clothes and golf equipment to his brother David John Brown II in San Diego.&lt;ref name="foxnews"/&gt; On April 20, 2005, David Brown was [[indictment|indicted]] for [[obstruction of justice]]. The indictment claimed he tampered with evidence when he cleaned out Jason's BMW in early December after driving it from a Las Vegas storage facility to California.&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foxnews"/&gt;

By 2005, the FBI had more than 200 leads in the case. The majority of leads were outside Arizona and dozens were outside the [[United States]], including possible sightings in Canada.&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt; Due to his "[[Surf culture|California surfer dude]]" appearance and his ability to blend into crowds, the FBI has had more leads on Brown than anyone else on the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives|Ten Most Wanted list]], with most of the leads unhelpful. Reporters have noted he bears a close resemblance to actor [[Sean Penn]], and one of Penn's [[body double]]s was once mistakenly arrested by authorities who thought he was Brown.&lt;ref name=Boyle&gt;{{cite news |title=FBI's Most Wanted fugitive 'could be hiding among Mormon community' after EIGHT.

On December 8, 2007, Brown was named by the FBI as the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives, 2000s|489th fugitive to be placed]] on their Ten Most Wanted list. The FBI is offering a reward of up to $200,000 for information leading to his capture (the reward was doubled on March 25, 2013).&lt;ref name="ambush"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FBI Phoenix, AZ Website"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/phoenix/press-releases/2013/fbi-announces-increased-reward-for-ten-most-wanted-fugitive-jason-derek-brown|title=FBI announces increased reward for ten most wanted fugitive Jason Derek Brown |publisher=Fbi.gov |accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent confirmed sighting was in August 2008, when an acquaintance of Brown recognized him while they were stopped at a [[traffic light]] near [[Hogle Zoo]] in Salt Lake City. Their mutual recognition prompted Brown to drive through the stoplight. The witness informed authorities of the sighting.&lt;ref name="seen"&gt;{{cite web |first=Ben |last=Winslow |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700259183/FBI-fugitive-may-be-living-high-life-in-SL.html |title=FBI fugitive may be living high life in S.L. |publisher=''Deseret News'' |date=September 16, 2008 |accessdate=August 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, Brown had longer hair and a deeper tan than in the 2004 photograph of his wanted poster.&lt;ref name="SLC"&gt;{{cite web |first=Lindsey |last=Collom |url=http://www.azcentral.com/community/ahwatukee/articles/2008/09/16/20080916arizfugitive.html |title=Ariz. fugitive reportedly seen in Salt Lake City |publisher=''The Arizona Republic'' |date=September 16, 2008 |accessdate=August 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Moses Browning''' (January 23, 1855&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pelley |first=Doug |url=http://www.dapcom.com/Temples/Headstones/browning.htm |title=Pictures of Headstones: John M.

Browning influenced nearly all categories of firearms design. He invented, or made significant improvements to, single-shot, [[lever-action]], and [[Pump-action|pump-action]] rifles and shotguns. Arguably, his most significant contributions were in the area of autoloading firearms. He developed the first reliable and compact [[semi-automatic pistol|autoloading pistol]]s by inventing the [[telescoping bolt]], then integrating the bolt and [[barrel shroud]] into what is known as the [[pistol slide]]. Browning's telescoping bolt design is now found on nearly every modern [[semi-automatic pistol]], as well as several modern [[Automatic firearm|fully automatic]] weapons. He also developed the first [[Gas operation|gas-operated]] firearm, the [[M1895 Colt–Browning machine gun|Colt–Browning Model 1895]] [[machine gun]]{{snd}} a system that surpassed mechanical [[recoil operation]] to become the standard for most high-power self-loading firearm designs worldwide. He also made significant contributions to [[automatic cannon]] development.

Browning's most successful designs include the [[M1911 pistol]], the [[Browning Hi Power]] pistol, the water-cooled [[M1917 Browning machine gun|M1917]], the air-cooled [[M1919 Browning machine gun|M1919]], and [[heavy machine gun|heavy]] [[M2 Browning machine gun|M2]] machine guns, the [[M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle|Browning Automatic Rifle]], and the [[Browning Auto-5]]{{snd}} the first [[semi-automatic shotgun]]. Some of these arms are still manufactured, often with only minor changes in detail and cosmetics to those assembled by Browning or his licensees. His guns are some of the most copied firearms in the world.

== Life and works ==
His father [[Jonathan Browning (inventor)|Jonathan Browning]], who was among the thousands of [[Mormon]] [[settler|pioneer]]s in the mass exodus from [[Nauvoo, Illinois]] to [[Utah]], established a [[gunsmith]] shop in Ogden in 1852. As was common in the Mormon community at that time, Jonathan Browning was a [[polygamy|polygamist]], having taken three wives. He fathered 19 children, including John Moses Browning with his wife Elizabeth Caroline Clark.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.browning.com/news/articles/honor-father-of-the-father-of-modern-firearms.html Browning.com] "In Honor of the Parents of "the Father of Modern Firearms." Retrieved September 5, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Moses worked in his father's Ogden shop from the age of seven, where he was taught basic engineering and manufacturing principles, and encouraged to experiment with new concepts. He developed his first rifle, a [[single-shot]] [[falling block action]] design, then, in 1878, in partnership with his younger brother, co-founded John Moses and Matthew Sandifer Browning Company, later renamed [[Browning Arms Company]], and began to produce this and other non-military firearms. 

Like his father, Browning was a Mormon, and served a two-year [[mission (LDS Church)]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] beginning on March 28, 1887.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Early Mormon Missionaries: John Moses Browning|url=https://history.lds.org/missionary/individual/john-moses-browning-1855?lang=eng}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He married Rachel Theresa Child (14 Sep 1860 – 30 Sep 1934) on April 10, 1879 at Ogden, Weber, Utah, and the couple had 10 children, two of whom died in infancy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.browning.com/news/articles/happy-father-s-day-john-moses-browning.html Browning] "Honoring 'The Father of the Browning Company.'", Browning.com.

=== Arms ===
Production examples of the [[Winchester Model 1885 Single Shot Rifle|Model 1885 Single Shot Rifle]] caught the attention of the [[Winchester Repeating Arms Company]], who dispatched a representative to evaluate the competition. Winchester bought the design for $8,000 and moved production to their [[Connecticut]] factory. From 1883, Browning worked in partnership with Winchester and designed a series of rifles and shotguns, most notably the lever action [[Winchester Model 1887/1901|Winchester Model 1887]] and the [[Winchester Model 1897|Model 1897]] pump shotgun, the falling-block single-shot [[Winchester Model 1885|Model 1885]], and the lever-action [[Winchester Model 1886|Model 1886]], [[Winchester Model 1892|Model 1892]], [[Winchester Model 1894|Model 1894]], [[Winchester Model 1895|Model 1895]] rifles as well as the [[long recoil]] operated semi-automatic [[Remington Model 8]] rifle, many of which are still in production today in some form; over six million Model 1894s had been produced as of 1983, more than any other sporting rifle in history.&lt;ref name=Wallack&gt;Wallack, LR. "Sixty Million Guns". 1983. In ''Gun Digest Treasury'', Harold A. Murtz, editor, DBI Books. 1994 p.190 {{ISBN|0873491564}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winchester manufactured several popular small arms designed by John M. Browning.  For decades in the late 19th Century-early 20th Century, Browning designs and Winchester firearms were synonymous and the collaboration was highly successful.  This came to an end when Browning proposed a new [[long recoil]] operated semi-automatic shotgun design, a prototype finished in 1898, to Winchester management, which ultimately became the Browning Auto-5 shotgun.  As was the custom of the time, Browning's earlier designs had been licensed exclusively to Winchester (and other manufacturers) for a single fee payment.  With this new product, Browning introduced in his negotiations a continuous royalty fee based upon unit sales, rather than a single front-end fee payment. If the new shotgun became highly successful, Browning stood to make substantially more fee income over the prior license fee arrangements.  Winchester management was displeased with the bold change in their relationship, and rejected Browning's offer.  Remington Arms was also approached, however the president of Remington died of a heart attack as Browning waited to offer them the gun. This forced Browning to look overseas to produce the shotgun. However; Remington would later produce a copy of the Auto-5 as the Model 11 which was used by the US Military and was also sold to the civilian market.

Having recently successfully negotiated firearm licenses with [[Fabrique Nationale de Herstal]] of Belgium (FN), Browning took the new shotgun design to FN; the offer was accepted and FN manufactured the new shotgun, honoring its inventor, as the Browning Auto-5.  The Browning Auto-5 was continuously manufactured as a highly popular shotgun throughout the 20th century.  In response, Winchester shifted reliance away from John Browning designs when it adopted a shotgun design of Thomas Crossley Johnson for the new Winchester Model 1911 SL, (Johnson had to work around Browning's patents of what became the Auto-5) and the new Model 1912 pump shotgun, which was based in small part upon design features of the earlier Browning-designed Winchester Model 1897 shotgun.  This shift marked the end of an era of Winchester-Browning collaboration.

=== Later work and life ===
[[File:JohnBrowning.jpeg|thumb|upright|Browning in his later years]]

John Browning was known as a dedicated and tireless innovator and experimenter who sought breakthrough consumer-oriented features and performance and reliability improvements in small arms designs.  He did not retire from his career in his later years, but dedicated his entire adult life{{snd}} literally to his last day{{snd}} to these pursuits.  On November 26, 1926, while working at the bench on a self-loading pistol design for [[Fabrique Nationale de Herstal]] (FN) in [[Liège (city)|Liège]], he died of heart failure in the design shop of his son [[Val A. Browning]]. Even the 9&amp;nbsp;mm semi-automatic pistol he was working on when he died had great design merit and was eventually completed in 1935, by Belgian designer [[Dieudonne Saive]]. Released as the Fabrique Nationale GP35, it was more popularly known as the successful [[Browning Hi-Power]] pistol, a favorite of sportsmen, gun collectors as well as many military and law enforcement agencies around the world.

The premium priced [[Browning Superposed]] shotgun, an over-under shotgun design, was his last completed firearm design and possibly his most elegant.  It was marketed originally with twin triggers; a single trigger modification was later completed by his son, Val Browning.  Commercially introduced in 1931 by FN, [[Browning Superposed]] shotguns, and their more affordable cousins, the [[Browning Citori]] made in Asia, continue to be manufactured into the 21st century, and come with varying grades of fine hand engraving and premium quality wood.

Throughout his life, Browning designed a vast array of military and civilian small arms for his own company, as well as for [[Winchester Repeating Arms Company|Winchester]], [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]], [[Remington Arms|Remington]], [[Savage Arms|Savage]], [[Stevens Arms|Stevens]], and [[Fabrique Nationale de Herstal]] of Belgium. Browning firearms have been made, both licensed and unlicensed, by hundreds of factories around the world.  [[Browning Arms Company]] was established in 1927, the year after Browning's death.  In 1977, FN Herstal acquired the company.

=== Legacy ===
The [[M1895 Colt–Browning machine gun|M1895 Machine Gun]] saw action in the Spanish–American War with the United States Marines.  The [[M1911 pistol|Colt M1911]], [[M1919 Browning machine gun|Browning 1917/19]], and the [[M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle|BAR]] saw action with US forces in [[World War I]], [[World War II]] and the [[Korean War]], with the M1911 going on to serve as the U.S.'s standard military [[side arm]] until 1985; a [[MEU(SOC) pistol|variant]] is still used by [[Marine Expeditionary Unit|special operations units of the United States Marine Corps]] and the design remains very popular amongst civilian shooters and some police departments. The [[Browning Hi-Power]] has a similarly lengthy period of service outside the United States, and remains the standard side arm of the Australian and Canadian armed forces. The [[M2 Browning machine gun]], the timeless .50 caliber "Ma Deuce", which was developed in 1918, entered service with the US Armed Forces in 1921, and remains in active service for nearly a century with armed forces across the world in a variety of roles.  The [[M4 cannon]], a 37mm [[autocannon]], was initially designed by Browning in 1921, and entered service in 1938; it was used both in aircraft and on the [[U.S. Navy]] [[PT boat]] during World War II.

Crane graduated from [[Northwestern University]] with a bachelor's degree in [[Asian studies]] in 1980. He then studied at the Arabic Language Unit of the [[American University in Cairo]] from 1980-82.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Crane worked as press secretary for [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]] [[William Louis Dickinson|Bill Dickinson]], ranking member on the [[United States House Committee on Armed Services|House Armed Services Committee]], from 1985-87. Dickinson advocated establishing an Office of the Inspector General in the [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]].&lt;ref name="Spiegel"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hertsgaard |first=Mark |author2=Felix Kasten |author3=Marcel Rosenbach |author4=Holger Stark |title=Blowing the Whistle: Former US Official Reveals Risks Faced by Internal Critics |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/ex-us-official-reveals-risks-faced-by-internal-govt-critics-a-1093360-2.html |work=Spiegel Online International |date=May 22, 2016}}, a translation of the German article in ''Der Spiegel'' No. 21/2016 (May 21, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; When that office was created in 1982, Crane became one of its first employees, helping to set up the [[hotline]]s for whistleblowers to report waste, fraud, or abuse. He had the text of the [[Whistleblower Protection Act]] of 1989 printed up as pamphlets for the personnel in the IG's office to refer to in carrying out their responsibilities.&lt;ref name="Spiegel"/&gt; Crane's work also included crafting committee press releases involving analysis of the [[National Defense Authorization Act]] and consequences for national defense policy.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In 1987, Crane became Legislative Director and Press Secretary for [[Silicon Valley]] Congressman [[Ernie Konnyu]], where he did supervisory work on formulating legislative policy agenda and communications thereof.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

By 1988, Crane moved to the Defense Department's Inspector General office as a Congressional Liaison. He represented the IG on congressional activities and legislation as well as in contacts on legislative and public affairs with the [[Office of the Secretary of Defense]]. In 1994 Crane was promoted to Director of the Office of Communication in the IG. He managed public affairs efforts including public statements and congressional testimonies regarding US activities in [[Southwest Asia]]. He was promoted to a high-level executive position, the Assistant Inspector General for Communications, in 2004. He administered change management and communication policy for Europe, Southwest Asia, and [[East Asia]]. He also performed strategic planning and was Principal Advisor to the IG. He was responsible for whistleblowing and transparency, including strategic (internal) and public affairs communications that included responses regarding the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information]] (FOIA) and [[Privacy Act of 1974|Privacy Act]]s. Crane reviewed legislation and advised on legislative changes. He was fired from his post as an assistant inspector general in February 2013, an action he claims came in response to his advocacy on behalf of whistleblowers who faced illegal reprisal from his superiors in the IG and from other areas of the [[Federal government of the United States#Executive branch|executive branch]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In October 2013, Crane joined the Government Accountability Project (GAP) as a consultant on legislative impact analysis. At GAP, he works with whistleblowers related to [[national security]] and on legislative, FOIA, and Privacy Act impacts.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Crane earned an Executive Master's in leadership from [[Georgetown University]] in 2015.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

After making his concerns about mistreatment of whistleblowers known to his superiors, Crane was removed from his position in 2013.&lt;ref name="Spiegel"/&gt; He was a recipient of the 2015 [[Joe A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7175">'''Juan Diego Bernardino''' (ca. 1456 – May 15, 1544) was one of two [[Aztec]] peasants alleged to have had visions of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]] as [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] in 1531.

== Life ==
Little is known of the life of Juan Bernardino. He lived in [[Tolpetlac]], some nine miles north of [[Tenochtitlán]] and brought up his nephew, Saint [[Juan Diego Cuauhtlatoatzin|Juan Diego]], after the latter's parents died. After the 1529 death of Juan Diego's wife, Maria Lucia, Juan Diego moved to be near his then-aged uncle in Tolpet.

== Vision of Our Lady ==
At the time of the [[Marian apparition|apparitions]] of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] to [[Juan Diego]] in December 1531, Juan Bernardino fell ill. According to most sources, he contracted ''[[cocolixtle]]'', a dreaded fever that normally led to death. On December 9, 1531, Juan Diego returned from his first two apparitions to find his uncle very ill. All that night and next day, Juan Diego tended to his uncle. Towards sunset, it became clear that Juan Bernardino was dying. Juan Diego set out at four the following morning, to bring back a [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] to hear his uncle's [[Confession (religion)|confession]] and administer the [[Anointing of the Sick|last rites]].

While he was gone, Juan Bernardino became too weak to drink the [[medicine]] that had been left by his bedside, and he felt he was about to die. Suddenly the room was filled with light and a beautiful radiant lady appeared to him. Our Lady appeared to Juan Bernardino and cured him. He immediately felt that his body had recovered from the fever, and getting up, fell to his knees before the apparition. She told him that she had met Juan Diego and sent him to the [[bishop]] with her sacred image imprinted on his [[Tilmàtli|tilma]]. It was at this apparition that she identified herself as 'The Ever Virgin, Holy Mary of Guadalupe' Some analysts believe that she actually said not ''de Guadalupe'' but ''te [[coatlaxopeuh]]'' which many scholars translate differently; "the one that originates from the cliffs", ''who crushes the stone serpent'', "the one that has dominion of the serpent", etc.

=== Apparition to Juan Bernardino === 
(This account of the apparition occurs in the middle of the Guadalupe narrative, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Diego#Guadalupe_narrative.) 

No sooner had Juan Diego demonstrated where the Lady of Heaven ordered her temple to be built than he begged to be excused. He wanted to go home to see his uncle Juan Bernardino, who had been very ill when Juan Diego left him and went to Tlatilolco to call a priest to confess and absolve him, the one whom the Lady of Heaven had told Juan Diego that she had already healed. But they would not let Juan Diego go alone, and instead accompanied him to his home. Arriving, they saw his uncle very happy and in no pain. He was astonished to see his nephew arrive accompanied and greatly honored, and he asked his nephew the reason why they did this and conferred honors upon him. His nephew answered that when he went to call the priest to confess and prepare his uncle, the Lady of Heaven appeared to him on Tepeyacac; she, telling him not to worry since his uncle was already in good health, consoled him much, and she sent him to Mexico, to see the Bishop, so that he might build her a house on Tepeyac. His uncle revealed that it was true that she healed him then and that he saw her the same way that she appeared to his nephew,, She told him that she was also sending him to Mexico to see the Bishop. Also then the Lady told him that when he went to see the Bishop, he should reveal what he saw and in what miraculous manner she had healed him and that he would properly name her, just as he needed to name her blessed image, the ever Virgin Holy Mary of Guadalupe.

Then they brought Juan Bernardino into the presence of the bishop, to come to inform and testify before him. The Bishop lodged both of them, him and his nephew, in his house for a few days, until the temple of Queen was built on Tepeyac, where Juan Diego had seen her. The Bishop moved into the main church the holy image of the beloved Lady of Heaven: he took it from the oratory of his palace where he was, for all people to see and admire her image.&lt;ref&gt; See the following website (in Spanish): https://www.ewtn.com/spanish/Maria/guadalupe.htm and the following website (in English and Nahuatl): http://pages.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/nahuatl/nican/nican7.html  &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Castro Dopacio"&gt;{{cite book|author=María Jesús Castro Dopacio|title=Emperatriz de las Américas: La Virgen de Guadalupe en la literatura chicana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d0vQv6YGsPsC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=%22t%C3%A9rmino+%22Guadalupe%22+da+pie+a+una+gran+controversia%22+etimolog%C3%ADa+%22Ana+Castillo%22+%22r%C3%ADo+de+amor,+r%C3%ADo+de+luz%22+%22r%C3%ADo+de+lobos%22+%22la+que+aplasta+la+cabeza+de+la+serpiente%22|accessdate=21 December 2015|date=28 November 2011|publisher=Universitat de València|language=es|isbn=978-84-370-7758-1|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kazakhs by federal subject 2010.svg|thumb|right|400 px|Distribution of Kazakhs in Russia, 2010]]
In [[Russia]], the [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] population lives in the regions bordering [[Kazakhstan]]. The 2010 Russian census recorded 647,732 Kazakhs living mostly in the [[Astrakhan Oblast]], [[Volgograd Oblast]], [[Samara Oblast]], [[Orenburg Oblast]], [[Chelyabinsk Oblast]], [[Kurgan Oblast]], [[Tyumen Oblast]], [[Omsk Oblast]], [[Novosibirsk Oblast]] and [[Altai Krai]] regions. During the 1920s significant numbers of Kazakh families were left outside the designated [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic]]; after the end of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991, they acquired Russian citizenship.

'''Lebanese Surinamese people''' are [[Suriname]]se citizens of [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] origin or descent.

== History ==
The first Lebanese, Nicolas Karkabé, arrived in Suriname around 1890 and settled there. He began as a peddler in the countryside but became a wealthy merchant in only a short time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/binn011sran01_01/binn011sran01_01_0010.php|title=Sranan. Cultuur in Suriname|work=dbnl.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next Lebanese, mostly [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronites]], arrived in the 1990s from [[French Guiana]]. Within [[Lebanon]] they originate from a specific region, [[Bsharri]], a small (agrarian based) village (Bazaoun). Within Suriname they entered the [[textile]] trade that they dominate at present. The modest migration to Suriname continues to this day and this small group of Lebanese expatriates now counts 500 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suriname.nu/150alg/libanezen01.html|title=Libanezen|work=Suriname.nu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Britain's Got Talent'' finalists (series 7)}}
{{BLP sources|date=June 2013}}
The [[Britain's Got Talent (series 7)|seventh series]] of '''''[[Britain's Got Talent]]''''' started on 13 April 2013 and ended on 8 June 2013. The finalists are given in the order in which they finished, thus Attraction won, Jack Carroll finished second and so on.

== Attraction ==
{{main|Attraction (shadow theatre group)}}
'''Attraction''' are a Hungarian shadow theatre group who won the competition beating joint favorite, Jack Carroll.

== Jack Carroll ==
{{main|Jack Carroll (comedian)}}
'''Jack Carroll''' is a comedian who suffers from [[Cerebral Palsy]].

== Richard &amp; Adam ==
{{main|Richard &amp; Adam}}
'''Richard and Adam Johnson''' are two opera singing brothers. Their act was disrupted in the final when one of their violinists when out and attacked the judges with eggs. They finished third place. In 2014, they returned for a combined performance with Attraction.

== Steve Hewlett ==
'''Steve Hewlett''', is a ventriloquist from [[Sussex]]. He and his wife Nina have a daughter,&lt;ref&gt;[http://roarglobal.com/clients/profile/steve-hewlett Steve Hewlett | ROAR Broadcasting&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122054653/http://roarglobal.com/clients/profile/steve-hewlett |date=22 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who was born in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/cromer_pier_show_s_vent_steve_hewlett_celebrates_birth_of_baby_after_summer_season_closes_1_1089858|title=Cromer pier show’s “vent” Steve Hewlett celebrates birth of baby after summer season closes|last=Batson|first=David|date=13 October 2011|work=[[Eastern Daily Press]]|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He auditioned with a puppet called 'Arthur Lager', depicted as an old man with grey hair. Hewlett's audition was aired in a montage on 18 May 2013. He made it through, and subsequently through to the semi-finals. He appeared again in the semi-final on 1 June with Arthur Lager, and a puppet designed to resemble Simon Cowell, one of the judges. The routine involved Arthur flirting with [[Amanda Holden]]. After his performance, people took to Twitter to voice their approval. He landed in the top three, and with eventual winners [[Attraction (shadow theatre group)|Attraction]] already through to the final, it was down to the judges to choose the second place in the final between Hewlett and [[Jordan O'Keefe]]. It was a split decision, so it was referred back to the public vote, revealing that with 15.1% of the vote, O'Keefe was through to the final, compared to Hewlett's 12%.

However, earlier in the week, it was revealed that the judges were going to choose a wildcard act out of the third-placed finishers to compete in the final. Hewlett was seen as the popular choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/06/08/bgts-steve-hewlett-impresses-twitter-as-hes-named-wildcard-act-3833635/|title=BGT's Steve Hewlett impresses Twitter as he's named wildcard act - Metro News|work=Metro|accessdate=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-reviews/ian-hyland-britains-talent-itll-1930077|title=Ian Hyland on Britain's Got Talent: It'll be travesty if Attraction don't win - Ian Hyland - Mirror Online|author=Ian Hyland|work=mirror|accessdate=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/britains-got-talent/britains-got-talent-2013-simon-cowell-teases-david-walliams-wildcard-choice-steve-hewlett-or-joseph-hall/|title=Britain's Got Talent 2014 ITV - Unreality TV|work=Unreality TV|accessdate=2 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029185251/http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/britains-got-talent/britains-got-talent-2013-simon-cowell-teases-david-walliams-wildcard-choice-steve-hewlett-or-joseph-hall/|archivedate=29 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was revealed on the night that Hewlett was indeed the wildcard. He performed again in the final with Arthur Lager (now wearing a Onesie), the puppet of [[Simon Cowell]] (wearing a swimsuit and life jacket),as well as a puppet of [[Sinitta]], along with a musical number in the shape of "[[We Go Together (song)|We Go Together]]" from ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'' at the end, involving the Simon and Sinitta puppets. Despite rave reviews from the judges, Hewlett finished in fourth, just narrowly missing out on the top three with 14.7% of the vote, compared to [[Richard &amp; Adam]]'s 15.4%.

Hewlett has previously headlined [[Cromer Pier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/what-s-on/cromer_pier_ventriloquist_steve_hewlett_misses_out_on_winning_britain_s_got_talent_1_2228571|title=Cromer Pier ventriloquist Steve Hewlett misses out on winning Britain’s Got Talent|author=Sophie Wyllie|work=Eastern Daily Press|accessdate=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was revealed the day after the final that Hewlett had been signed to entertainment agency ROAR Global.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/britains-got-talent/britains-got-talent-2013-jack-carroll-attraction-jordan-okeefe-steve-hewlett-francine-lewis-sign-with-new-agency/|title=Britain's Got Talent 2013: Jack Carroll, Attraction, Jordan O'Keefe, Steve Hewlett, Francine Lewis sign with new agency - Unreality TV|work=Unreality TV|accessdate=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jordan O'Keefe ==
'''Jordan O'Keefe''' (born 1994) is a singer-songwriter from [[Derry]], [[Northern Ireland]]. Before the show, he previously worked as an estate agent.

Upon auditioning for ''BGT'' (the audition was aired on 20 April 2013), he stated that he initially applied for a music course in college, but his father had it changed to business. He stated that he was 'raging' at the time, but that he had forgiven his father. He auditioned with a guitar-led version of [[Little Things (One Direction song)|Little Things]] by [[One Direction]], receiving rave reviews from the judges, receiving four yeses and being put through to the next round, and subsequently the live semi-finals.

He performed in the live semi-final on 1 June, performing "[[I Will Always Love You]]", again receiving rave reviews from the judges. He landed in the top three – with [[Attraction (shadow theatre group)|Attraction]] already through to the final (and who became eventual winners), the judges had to pick between O'Keefe and ventriloquist Steve Hewlett. It was a split decision, so was referred back to the public vote, and it was revealed that O'Keefe had the higher amount of votes and was automatically through to the final. Hewlett was chosen as the wildcard for the final a week later.

O'Keefe performed "[[Firework (song)|Firework]]" in the final on 8 June, and finished in sixth place with 3.7% of the vote.

It was revealed during his time in ''BGT'' that he was previously mates with [[Niall Horan]], a member of [[One Direction]] and that he was his inspiration to win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/06/05/britains-got-talent-finalist-jordan-okeefe-one-directions-niall-horan-is-my-inspiration-to-win-3829359/|title=Britain's Got Talent finalist Jordan O’Keefe: 1D's Niall Horan is my inspiration - Metro News|work=Metro|accessdate=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also mentioned that he had audition for X Factor the same year, and just narrowly missed out on being in One Direction. It was revealed the day after the final that O'Keefe, along with many of the other finalists, had been signed to the entertainment agency ROAR Global.

O'Keefe was the support act for [[Jonathan and Charlotte]] on their UK arena tour. Jordan is now in the progress of releasing his single. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/britain_got_talent/4976975/BGT-Gabz-to-release-Lighters.html|title=The Sun|work=thesun.co.uk|accessdate=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gabz ==
{{main|Gabz}}

==Arisxandra==
'''Arisxandra Libantino''' (born 2001) is a Philippines-born English singer from Nottingham of Filipino descent. She attends Trinity School. She moved to the UK at an early age.

In her audition in February (aired on 13 April), she performed 'One Night Only' and received a standing ovation from the judges, as well as a positive response. However, upon the broadcast of her audition during the launch episode of the series, many viewers were outraged at that the fact that she was singing a song about a [[one-night stand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/showbiz/392076/Outrage-as-11-year-old-schoolgirl-sings-about-a-one-night-stand-on-Britain-s-Got-Talent|title=Outrage as 11-year-old schoolgirl sings about a one night stand on Britain's Got Talent|last=McCormack|first=Kirsty|date=15 April 2013|work=[[Daily Express]]|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vivienne Pattison, director of [[Mediawatch UK]], said the show was "sexualising children" and that "We are sleepwalking into a situation where pornography is the norm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2309082/Britains-Got-Talent-viewers-backlash-lap-dancer-schoolgirl-11-singing-night-stands.html|title=Britain's Got Sleaze: BGT viewers' backlash over the lap-dancer and the schoolgirl of 11 singing about one-night stands|last=Cable|first=Simon|date=14 April 2013|work=[[Daily Mail]]|accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later however, she was shown being put through to the semi-finals. Her family stated that they were desperate for her to win to end their poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/bgt-child-singer-arisxandra-libantino-1912450|title=BGT child singer Arisxandra Libantino: Sensation's family desperate for her to win to end their poverty|author=Halina Watts|date=25 May 2013|work=mirror|accessdate=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the semi-final on 27 May, she performed 'I Have Nothing' and received rave reviews from the judges. She landed in the top three of the semi-final, and it was down to the judges to pick the second place for the final with [[Richard and Adam Johnson]] already through. Simon Cowell and Alesha Dixon opted for dance group Youth Creation, while David Walliams and Amanda Holden opted for Arisxandra. The judges' vote was a split decision so therefore Arisxandra was announced to have received more public votes and was sent through to the final.

She performed 'The Voice Within' in the final on 8 June. David Walliams said "You have an incredible, natural talent. I think the thing that children often miss is the emotion in a song but you caught it beautifully tonight." Alesha Dixon said "Such a massive song to take on and you did it with ease. The most impressive thing is your control. You rose to the occasion tonight." Amanda Holden said "You did yourself proud, you started off so whispery and quiet but when you went for it, you went for it. It was an electrifying performance." Simon Cowell finished with "You started off a little bit tentative and then you got yourself together. I genuinely, after this, don’t know what’s going to happen tonight." She finished in eighth place with 2.9% of the vote.

== Pre Skool ==
'''Pre Skool''' are a dance group from [[Neath]], [[Port Talbot]] in [[South Wales]], and essentially the younger version of Nu Sxool who reached the final the previous year. They finished in ninth place with 2.8% of the vote. They're aged 6–9. They are choreographed by Terry Michael, the man behind last year's Nu Sxool. 

Pre Skool have been involved in the [[Pixar]] film ''[[Planes (film)|Planes]]''. Both Pre Skool and Nu Sxool were invited to the premier of ''Planes'' in [[Leicester Square]]. Pre Skool and Nu Sxool were asked to make a dance routine to one of the songs from Disney Planes. The video is a great success.

Her parents moved to the UK from [[Eastern Cape]] South Africa over 10 years ago.&lt;ref name="iol"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/the-star/bgt-s-asanda-may-get-record-deal-1.1530071#.Ubr62ufrzu0|title=BGT’s Asanda may get record deal|author=Independent Newspapers Online|work=Independent Online|accessdate=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lucy A. Mallory''' ({{circa}} 1843 or 1856{{em dash}}September 4, 1920) was an American writer, publisher, editor, and spiritualist.{{sfn|Tolstoy|2018|p=411}} She was also a "[[Women's suffrage in the United States|suffragist]], [[vegetarian]], and devotee of [[metaphysical]] experiences". [[Leo Tolstoy]] was so influenced by Mallory's magazine, the monthly spiritualist,{{sfn|Bennion|1990|p=142}} ''The World's Advance Thought'',&lt;ref name="iapsop"&gt;{{cite web |last1=iapsop.com |first1=inquiries at |title=The World's Advance Thought and the Universal Republic (IAPSOP) |url=http://www.iapsop.com/archive/materials/worlds_advance_thought/ |website=www.iapsop.com |accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that he called her the "greatest woman in America".{{sfn|Prince|Schaffer|2017|p=34}}

Mallory was editor and publisher of ''The World's Advance Thought and the Universal Republic'' — two periodicals printed under one cover — published for more than thirty years.{{sfn|Armstrong|1919|p=68}}

==Early years==
Lucy A. Rose was born {{circa}} 1843&lt;ref name=ohs/&gt; in [[Michigan]]{{sfn|Ritter|Wakelyn|1989|p=417}} and grew up in [[Roseburg, Oregon]].{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=491}}{{efn|Willard (1893) states that Mallory was born in 1846 in Roseburg, Oregon. Anderson (2014) stated that Mallory was a native of [[Michigan]],{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=90}} which is corroborated by Charles F. Ritter and John Wakelyn in ''American Legislative Leaders, 1850-1910'' (1989). There is some dispute over her birth year; the [[Oregon Historical Society]] states she was born in 1843, while Prince &amp; Schaffer (2017) record her year of birth as 1856.{{sfn|Prince|Schaffer|2017|p=34}} The [[California Birth Index]] cites her age at the time of her death in 1920 as 64, which indicates she would have been born {{circa}} 1846.&lt;ref name=cfd&gt;"[https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QK91-15TT  California Death Index, 1905-1939]" (8 November 2017). Lucy A Mallory, 1920; citing 37255, Department of Health Services, Vital Statistics Department, Sacramento; FHL microfilm 1,686,046.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Her father, [[Aaron Rose (pioneer)|Aaron Rose]], settled in [[Oregon]] early in the 1840s, and the city of Roseburg was named for him. He was one of the first European settlers at a time when the country was an unbroken wilderness. Her mother, Minerva Kellogg Rose,{{sfn|Bennion|1990|p=142}} died in giving birth to Lucy. Mallory was reared among [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=491}}{{sfn|Logan|1912|p=874}}

==Career==
On June 24, 1860, she married [[Rufus Mallory]],{{sfn|Davis|1910|p=187}} who afterwards [[List of United States Representatives from Oregon|represented Oregon in Congress]], and who was later one of the most successful lawyers in the [[Pacific Northwest]], and was the senior member of the extensive law firm to which Senator [[Joseph N. Dolph]] belonged. She accompanied her husband to [[Washington, D.C.]], after which they returned to [[Salem, Oregon]].{{sfn|Prince|Schaffer|2017|p=34}}{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=491}}{{sfn|Logan|1912|p=874}}

In 1874, the [[History of racial discrimination in Oregon|old slavery prejudice was so strong in Oregon]] that some forty-five [[African American]] and [[mulatto]] children were prevented from attending the Salem public schools and kept from all chance of acquiring an education, as no Caucasian teachers would condescend to teach them. A public fund was set apart for them, but no one came forward to labor for it. Mallory volunteered to instruct the children, in the face of sneers and ridicule. Her course shamed the people into a sense of duty, and within three years, friction and opposition ended, and the children were admitted into the public schools and classes. Mallory, having no immediate use for the public money which she drew for her work, let it remain in the bank.{{sfn|Prince|Schaffer|2017|p=34}}{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=491}}{{sfn|Logan|1912|p=874}}

In 1886, she used the fund for the purchase of a printing plant, and soon after, started her monthly magazine, the ''World's Advanced Thought'', with Judge Horatio N. Maguire for assistant editor. After Maguire retired from editorial connection, on account of the pressure of other business affairs, he still contributed to its pages, while Mallory, who was always the proprietor, had full control. Her magazine circulated among advanced thinkers and workers. Tolstoy subscribed to it.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=491}}{{sfn|Logan|1912|p=874}}

Mallory established and maintained the first free reading room in Portland. For thirty years, it was open to all who would enter it. In it were many rare books of spiritualism and philosophy, as well as periodicals, not easily obtainable elsewhere. Mallory, with her All World Soul Communion hour, to be observed around the world, was the pioneer in the "going into the Silence" idea, collectively. Many [[New Thought]] groups have since practised this method of attaining unity of thought. In addition to her reading room and periodicals, Mallory kept parlors open for meetings held twice or three times a week. Often these were addressed by speakers of world reputation, but oftener, those with unusual ideas spoke there as the one place in the city where they could utter their thoughts in a friendly and hospitable atmosphere. Many tried their speaking powers here for the first time. [[Elizabeth Towne]], publisher of ''Nautilus Magazine'', [[Holyoke, Massachusetts]], was one of these.{{sfn|Armstrong|1919|p=68}} Prince &amp; Schaffer (2017) described Mallory as an "anarchist creative" with her cultural club, the Association of Artists and Authors.{{sfn|Prince|Schaffer|2017|p=34}} Mallory was always a [[vegetarian]].{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=491}}{{sfn|Logan|1912|p=874}}

Mallory was a Life Member of the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]].{{sfn|National American Woman Suffrage Association. Convention|1919|p=315}} In the early 1900s, the Oregon Vegetarian Society held meetings in the "Advance Thought" parlor at the [[Hotel Mallory]], the parlor being owned by Mallory.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=90}}

==Background==
Madeleine Pickens was born Madeleine Baker on March 5, 1947&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Madeleine-Pickens/6000000016066210079|title=Madeleine A.

Pickens [[Model (person)|modeled]] and worked as a [[flight attendant]] for [[Pan American Airlines]] in her twenties.  She moved to [[Marina Del Rey, California]] in 1969 and went into business for herself, providing cabin service crews for [[Business jet|corporate jets]] and special [[Charter airline|charter flights]].&lt;ref name=range1&gt;{{cite web|last=Finley |first = Tom |url=http://www.rangemagazine.com/features/winter-11/wi11-range-mustang.pdf|title=Special Report: MUSTANG Legends and Myths.

She met Allen Paulson, the founder of [[Gulfstream Aerospace]] in 1983,&lt;ref name=Hovdey /&gt; and married him in 1988.  In 1993 they bought the Del Mar Country Club in [[Rancho Santa Fe, California]], where she drew upon her background to design and build the golf course.&lt;ref name=delmar&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.delmarcountryclub.com/club/scripts/library/view_document.asp?NS=PUBLIC&amp;DN=HISTORY|title=Del Mar Country Club View Library Document: History|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon Paulson's death in 2000, she and his children from his previous marriages disputed over the estate until 2003, at which time she was awarded in the settlement, among other assets, stock in the Country Club.  In September 2015, the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] filed suit against beneficiaries of Paulson's estate, including Pickens, for unpaid estate taxes.&lt;ref name=wm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wealthmanagement.com/estate-planning/who-s-liable-unpaid-estate-taxes|title=Who's Liable for Unpaid Estate Taxes?|date=15 September 2016|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 10, 2018, a judge ruled Pickens was not liable for the taxes.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law360.com/articles/1081117/calif-court-oks-lien-on-assets-in-gulfstream-founder-s-trust&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, she married Texas oilman [[T. Boone Pickens]]. Not long after their marriage, the couple traveled to New Orleans to rescue pets stranded during the evacuation from [[Hurricane Katrina]] and flew them to California and Colorado on a chartered cargo jet.&lt;ref name=Pickens/&gt; They divorced early in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Sonia Smith, [http://www.texasmonthly.com/story/t-boone-and-madeleine-pickens’-super-sad-true-divorce-story "T.

In 2007, Pickens paid $35&amp;nbsp;million for a home on the beach in [[Del Mar, California|Del Mar]]; in 2010 she sued the city for ordering her to prune plants that were obstructing her neighbors' view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-del-mar-settles-billionaire-hedges-2010mar09-story.html|title=Del Mar settles with billionaire over hedges|first=Tanya|last=Mannes|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pickens has sponsored several events at the Del Mar Country Club benefiting military organizations.&lt;ref name=seals /&gt;&lt;ref name=delmar /&gt; In July 2016, Pickens, [[Jenny Craig (entrepreneur)|Jenny Craig]], and [[Doug Manchester]] co-chaired a fundraiser for [[Donald Trump]] at the Del Mar Country Club in Rancho Santa Fe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joshua Stewart|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/politics/sdut-trump-fundraiser-san-diego-2016jul13-story.html|title=Trump attends Rancho Santa Fe fundraiser|newspaper=San Diego Union-Tribune|date=July 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equine interests==

Pickens is said to be a lifelong equestrian.&lt;ref name=plutocrat&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SwGdfAVhmSUC|title=Wild Horses of the West|first=Ed|last=de Steiger|publisher=University of Arizona Press|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; She developed an interest in thoroughbred [[flat racing]] and with Allen Paulson, she owned several race horses, including [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame|U.S. Racing Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Cigar (horse)|Cigar]],&lt;ref&gt;Hovdey&lt;/ref&gt; which she traded to husband Allen for the filly, [[Eliza (horse)|Eliza]], the 1992 [[Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies]] winner and that year's [[Eclipse Award]] winner as [[American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html|title=Garden Roars This Time for a Four-Footed Hero: Cigar|first=Robin|last=Finn|date=3 November 1996|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Pickens' other horses included  [[Fraise]], who won the 1992 [[Breeders' Cup Turf]];&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/03/sports/othersports/03horses.html|title=Former Owner of Racehorses Now Works to Save Them|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1 May 2009|first=Jillian|last=Dunham}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Yokohama (horse)|Yokohama]] winner of the 1997 [[Prix Foy]] at [[Longchamp Racecourse]];{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} and  [[Rock Hard Ten]], winner of the 2005 [[Santa Anita Handicap]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equibase.com/profiles/Results.cfm?type=Horse&amp;refno=6143344&amp;registry=T|title=Equibase - Horse Racing - Horse Racing Entries - Horse Racing Results - Past Performances - Mobile - Statistics|first=|last=Equibase.com|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pickens and Jenny Craig owned [[Rock and Roll (horse)|Rock and Roll]] who won the 1998 [[Pennsylvania Derby]] and ran in the [[Kentucky Derby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equibase.com/profiles/Results.cfm?type=Horse&amp;refno=4005633&amp;registry=T&amp;rbt=TB|title=Equibase - Horse Racing - Horse Racing Entries - Horse Racing Results - Past Performances - Mobile - Statistics|first=|last=Equibase.com|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pickens also raced Miss Dominique, named for her daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Hovdey, op. cit. p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

After the settlement of Paulson's estate, Pickens no longer had [[Jockey#Racing colors|colors]] to race,&lt;ref name=range1/&gt; although she was still part owner of Rock Hard Ten and a few broodmares. She announced in June 2005 that, upon her marriage to T. Boone Pickens, her involvement with racing would be reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/169842/madeleine-paulson-to-wed-t-boone-pickens-scaling-back-on-horse-business|title=Madeleine Paulson to Wed T.

In recognition of their efforts, in 2007 Madeleine and Boone Pickens received the Equine Advocates' Safe Home Equine Protection Award.&lt;ref name=bloodhorse /&gt; 
 
In the summer of 2008, the [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM), was faced with a budget crisis in its free-roaming horse program due to the cost of maintaining 33,000 excess (unadopted) horses captured on public lands in holding facilities.  The agency was considering implementing the options that Congress had provided for in amendments to the [[Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971]], to either euthanize or sell the horses "without limitation" to any willing buyer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By Malinda OsbornePosted Oct. 15, 2008 |url=https://www.avma.org/News/JAVMANews/Pages/081101e.aspx |title=Wild horses could face euthanasia |publisher=Avma.org |date=2008-11-01 |accessdate=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since "any willing buyer" included those that would send the horses to [[Horse slaughter|slaughter]] in foreign countries,&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/WN/PersonOfWeek/story?id=6307278&amp;page=1|title=Oil Billionaire's Wife Drafts Horse Rescue Plan|first=A. B. C.|last=News|date=21 November 2008|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pickens established "The National Wild Horse Foundation," to create a sanctuary for excess horses.&lt;ref name=mm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mustangmonument.com/about-mustang-monument/madeleine-pickens/|title=Madeleine Pickens - Mustang Monument Eco-Resort|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 21, 2008, Pickens was named Person of the Week by [[ABC News]] due to her announcement that she would adopt and maintain, with private funds, all 33,000 horses at the sanctuary.&lt;ref name=abc /&gt; However, shortly thereafter she stated that the recession forced many of the donors she hoped would help her pay for the venture backed out, and she requested the BLM pay her a yearly stipend of $500 per horse to maintain the horses.  The BLM responded that it was not possible to enter into the contract she requested.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/06/AR2009030602211_2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In January, 2010, Pickens hired three helicopters to view and photograph a BLM horse gather, and at one point they flew across the flight path of other helicopters being used to herd animals, leading to the accusation she had interfered with the gather.&lt;ref name=range1/&gt;  A year later, a $500,000 float she sponsored for the [[Rose Parade|Tournament of Roses Parade]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-madeleine-pickens-rose-parade-float-message-hits-2011jan03-story.html|title=Madeleine Pickens' Rose Parade message hits home|first=Diane|last=Bell|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; depicted a Native American on a horse watching over several galloping horses. The day before the parade, the National Tribal Horse Coalition issued a news release objecting to the float for using "the symbolism of the North American Indians and horses to promote agendas in direct opposition to the tribes' position."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cowboycountrymagazine.com/2010/12/rose-bowl-parade-controversy/|title=Rose Bowl Parade Controversy - Canadian Cowboy Country Magazine|date=31 December 2010|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2010, Pickens purchased property in [[Elko County, Nevada|Elko County]] in northeast Nevada; the 14,000 acre Spruce Ranch in the remote [[Goshute Valley]] for $2,570,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elkodaily.com/news/local/horse-sanctuary-in-elko-county-pickens-buys-spruce-ranch/article_c624c450-d378-11df-b3ed-001cc4c002e0.html|title=Horse sanctuary in Elko County?

Initially the Warm Creek Ranch headquarters was slated to be used as the "base of operations" for the eco-sanctuary.&lt;ref name=blm&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.blm.gov/style/medialib/blm/nv/field_offices/elko_field_office/information/nepa/eiss/archives/nenvwh_ecosanctuary.Par.21472.File.dat/EcoSanctuaryScopingBrief.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321102508/https://www.blm.gov/style/medialib/blm/nv/field_offices/elko_field_office/information/nepa/eiss/archives/nenvwh_ecosanctuary.Par.21472.File.dat/EcoSanctuaryScopingBrief.pdf |archivedate=2017-03-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on September 11, 2012, Pickens made reference to plans for a luxury resort called the ''Mustang Monument: Wild Horse Eco-Resort''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rtfitchauthor.com/2012/09/12/madeleine-pickens-eco-resort/|title=Madeleine Pickens' Eco-RESORT?|date=12 September 2012|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pickens began converting the headquarters for the resort,&lt;ref name=range /&gt; and began renovating the old ranchhouse there to become a dining hall and kitchen.&lt;ref name=code /&gt;  On April 3, 2013, the Elko County Commission approved a liquor license for venture,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elkocountynv.net/4_3_4_13.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and Pickens spent a million dollars on "Safari Tents" or Tee Pees for the guests. The eco-resort was open for business in the summer of 2014 and, among other things, offered horseback rides on BLM-administered public lands&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunset.com/travel/wild-horses|title=The fight over America's wild horses|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/8bba616c-ed87-11e3-abf3-00144feabdc0|title=Financial Times|website=Financial Times|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and using a road crossing BLM administered lands to the Spruce Ranch to take guests to see the horses kept there.&lt;ref name=agweekly/&gt; Pickens states she was informed by the BLM in December of that year that she would need a permit to use the road and public lands for her commercial ventures and that she filed the application for the permit.  Pickens claims that in October 2015 the BLM told her the paperwork had been misplaced,&lt;ref name=open&gt;http://mustangmonument.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Mustang-Monument-Prevented-from-Opening-for-2016-Season-Feb-2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and her representative claims that the BLM requested trivial information to process the application.&lt;ref name=losing&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegasnow.com/news/i-team-madeleine-pickens-losing-battle-with-the-blm/542942332|title=I-Team: Madeleine Pickens' losing battle with the BLM|first=|last=LAKANA|date=2 September 2016|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Elko County officials determined that the food preparation facilities she planned did not meet the County health and safety codes, and required her to install a commercial kitchen.&lt;ref name=code&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegasnow.com/news/i-team-elko-countys-strict-building-codes-raise-questions|title=I-Team: Elko County's strict building codes raise questions|first=|last=LAKANA|date=5 September 2016|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By February, 2016 the BLM had not finished processing the permit application and the County's safety codes had not yet been met.  The County required Pickens to, in case of fire, to put sprinkler systems&lt;ref name=code /&gt; in the lavishly furnished teepees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mustangmonument.com/luxury-tipis/|title=Glamping Vacation Luxury Camping - Mustang Monument|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because the town of Wells had, in 2008, suffered a major earthquake,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/trending/silver-state/8-biggest-earthquakes-nevada-history|title=8 biggest earthquakes in Nevada history|first=STEPHANIE GRIMES|last=REVIEWJOURNAL.COM|date=31 March 2014|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; she was required to modify the walk-in cooler in the kitchen to be earthquake proof.&lt;ref name=code /&gt;  Pickens issued a press release on February 10, 2016, stating the resort would not open for 2016,&lt;ref name=open /&gt; but although the Mustang Monument website stated she hoped to open in 2017&lt;ref name=mm3&gt;{{cite web|title=Reservations|website=Mustang Monument Wild Horse eco-resort|url=http://mustangmonument.com/reservations/ |accessdate=February 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and having spent $25 million on the venture,&lt;ref name=open /&gt; she stated on September 1, 2016, she was "out of it" and would sell the Tee Pees.  [[George Knapp (journalist)|George Knapp]], an investigative reporter for a Las Vegas television station, reported that Pickens said that she had made a bad decision and she would not spend more money on the venture.&lt;ref name=code /&gt;  The webpage for Mustang Monument announced the facility was closed in 2016 and was not updated since.&lt;ref name=mm3 /&gt;

Pickens stated that her problems with acquiring the BLM permit are due to her being "a tall tree" that "catch(es) the wind."&lt;ref name=open /&gt; Pickens' representative suggested the real reasons for Elko County's safety requirements were due to local hostility to a wild horse sanctuary and because Pickens was from California, and Knapp, a [[Coast to Coast AM]] host that had Pickens' representative on as a guest in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coasttocoastam.com/shows/2012/03/18/ |title=Wild Horses/ UFO Detection - Shows |publisher=Coasttocoastam.com |date=2012-03-18 |accessdate=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; expanded upon that to imply that they were imposed because Pickens was "rich, blonde, female, and...from California."&lt;ref name=code/&gt;  Adding to the conflicts in 2016, a lawsuit against Saving America's Mustangs and the Del Mar Country Club was filed for an alleged racially motivated hostile work environment at the Country Club and Mustang Monument in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elkodaily.com/news/local/pickens-ranch-target-of-discrimination-lawsuit/article_636822f5-bf4f-5f54-b1f4-64b0de729aa0.html|title=Pickens ranch target of discrimination lawsuit|first=ADELLA HARDING Free Press|last=Correspondent|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of January 2017, that lawsuit was pending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elkodaily.com/news/local/pickens-discrimination-lawsuit-is-back-in-court/article_56adeed7-f6a0-5d2c-8623-58c07091eb67.html|title=Pickens discrimination lawsuit is back in court|first=ADELLA HARDING  Free Press|last=Correspondent|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Margaret Ekpo''' (July 27, 1914 – September 21, 2006) was a [[Nigerian]] [[women's rights]] activist and social mobilizer who was a pioneering female politician in the country's [[Nigerian First Republic|First Republic]] and a leading member of a class of traditional Nigerian women activists, many of whom rallied women beyond notions of ethnic solidarity.&lt;ref name=Falola&gt;Toyin Falola, Adebayo Oyebade. Africa World Press, 2002, p. 374. {{ISBN|0-86543-998-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; She played major roles as a grassroot and nationalist politician in the Eastern Nigerian city of [[Aba, Nigeria|Aba]], in the era of an hierarchical and male-dominated movement towards [[independence]], with her rise not the least helped by the socialization of women's role into that of helpmates or appendages to the careers of males.&lt;ref name=Dibua&gt;Jeremiah I. Dibua. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd, 2006, p. 68. {{ISBN|0-7546-4228-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Margaret Ekpo was born in Creek Town, [[Cross River State]], to the family of Okoroafor Obiasulor and Inyang Eyo Aniemewue. She reached standard six of the school leaving certificate in 1934. However, tragedy struck at home with the death of her father in 1934, her goals of further education in teachers training was as a result put on hold. She then started working as a pupil teacher in [[elementary schools]]. She married a doctor, John Udo Ekpo, in 1938. He was from the [[Ibibio people|Ibibio]] ethnic group who are predominant in [[Akwa Ibom State]], while she was of [[Igbo people|Igbo]] and [[Efik people|Efik]] heritage. She later moved with her husband to Aba.

In 1946, she had the opportunity to study abroad at what is now [[Dublin Institute of Technology]], [[Dublin]] [[Ireland]]. She earned a diploma in [[domestic science]] and on her return to Nigeria she established a Domestic Science and Sewing Institute in Aba.

==Political career==

===Early politics===
Margaret Ekpo's first direct participation in [[political]] ideas and association was in 1945. Her husband was indignant with the [[Colonialism|colonial]] administrators treatment of indigenous Nigerian doctors but as a [[civil servant]], he could not attend meetings to discuss the matter. Margaret Ekpo then attended meetings in place of her husband, the meetings were organized to discuss the discriminatory practices of the colonial administration in the city and to fight [[cultural]] and racial imbalance in administrative promotions. She later attended a political rally and was the only woman at the rally, which saw fiery speeches from [[Mbonu Ojike]], [[Nnamdi Azikiwe]] and [[Herbert Macaulay]]. By the end of the decade she had organized a Market Women Association in Aba to unionize market women in the city.&lt;ref name=Vanguard&gt;"S-South Presidency Long Overdue, But...", ''Vanguard'', Nigeria, 11 July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; She used the association to promote women solidarity as a platform to fight for the economic rights of women, economic protections and expansionary political rights of women.

===Activism===
Margaret Ekpo's awareness of growing movements for [[civil rights]] for women around the world prodded her into demanding the same for the women in her country and to fight the discriminatory and oppressive political and civil role colonialism played in the subjugation of women. She felt that women abroad including those in Britain, were already fighting for civil rights and had more voice in political and civil matters than their counterparts in Nigeria. She later joined the [[decolonization]]-leading [[National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons]] (NGNC), as a platform to represent a marginalized group. In the 1950s, she also teamed up with [[Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti]] to protest killings at an [[Enugu]] [[coal mine]]; the victims were leaders protesting colonial practices at the mine. In 1953, Ekpo was nominated by the NGNC to the regional House of Chiefs, and in 1954 she established the Aba Township Women's Association. As leader of the new market group, she was able to garner the trust of a large number of women in the township and turn it into a political pressure group. By 1955, women in Aba had outnumbered men voters in a citywide election.&lt;ref&gt;Etim and James, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

She won a seat to the Eastern Regional House of Assembly in 1961, a position that allowed her to fight for issues affecting women at the time. In particular, there were issues on the progress of women in economic and political matters, especially in the areas of transportation around major roads leading to markets and rural transportation in general.&lt;ref name="Etim and James"&gt;James S. Etim, Valentine Udoh James. ''The Feminization of Development Processes in Africa: Current and Future Perspectives'', Praeger Publishers, 1999, p. 108-110.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a military [[coup]] ended the First Republic, she took a less prominent approach to politics. In 2001, Calabar Airport was named after her.

'''Marten Douwes Teenstra''' (17 September 1795 Het Ruigezand, [[Groningen]] -  29 October 1864 [[Ulrum]]) was a Dutch writer and traveller in [[South Africa]] and the [[Dutch East Indies]]. The account of his stay at the Cape from 12 March to 7 July 1825, "''De vruchten mijner werkzaamheden''" (fruits of my labours), was a thorough description of his trip, rich in interesting detail of the personalities and places he came across, and thoughtful commentary on the social, political and economic life of the [[Cape colony]].

Despite this being his first published attempt at writing, the artless manner in which he set down his observations on language, habits and customs, modes of transport, farming practices and the appearance of the countryside, must rank this as one of the finest travelogues on the Cape.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/teen002vruc02_01/teen002vruc02_01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Besides trying the restorative waters of the Caledon baths, he visited [[Genadendal|Genadendal Mission]], [[Franschhoek]] and [[Stellenbosch]].

Teenstra belonged to a prosperous [[Friesland|Frisian]] farming family, and was the son of Douwe Martens Teenstra and Jantje Luies Dijkhuis. In 1819 his father bought him the 100ha farm "Arion" for the sum of 100 000 guilders. The collapsing agricultural market caused widespread financial losses, and led to his 1824 decision to temporarily abandon farming, his wife and his children, and to leave for [[Java]] aboard a swift frigate named "''Abel Tasman''".

Life aboard the ship was comfortable with excellent fare, often consisting of seven or eight dishes, wine, music and singing after supper, and the odd game of cards, checkers or chess. In the equatorial latitudes, though, the heat was oppressive, especially at night, when the mingled odours of cheese, ham and unwashed bodies from the hold, forced passengers to sleep on deck. Teenstra, together with 33 others who had not crossed the equator previously, were subjected to the ceremony of "[[Line-crossing ceremony|crossing the line]]".

After a voyage lasting sixty-one days via [[Madeira]], the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Trinidad]], their ship anchored in [[Table Bay]] on 11 March 1825. Teenstra was feeling decidedly unwell, a condition he put down to a freak squall's having drenched him while he was enjoying a bath. In this fragile state he spent a few weeks in the company of his landlady, Miss Truter and her family members, who by horse and buggy introduced him to [[Cape Town]] and the [[Cape Peninsula|Peninsula]].

His next letter was dated  1 May 1825 and was written from [[Caledon, Western Cape|Caledon]], a source of mineral-rich hot springs where he "took the waters" on the advice of his doctor, his ship having left for [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] while he underwent an enforced convalescence.

Teenstra returned to his family in 1826 and soon realised that agricultural prospects had not improved during his absence. Consequently he sold his farm and moved to [[Baflo]] with his family, from where he wrote most of his travel books. Again, he found himself in financial trouble and in 1828 moved to [[Surinam]], at that time one of the Dutch colonies. Here he became an agricultural advisor and was soon appointed as inspector of bridges, roads and waterworks. Over this period his wife and children were living in Ulrum in a house built by his mother-in-law.

Teenstra returned to the Netherlands in 1834, bought a house in Ulrum and settled in to write, producing children's, travel and history books, and establishing two magazines. He attended the [[Mennonite]] church and was a member of the [[Freemasons]].

'''Massimiliano Antonio''' "'''Max'''" '''Cavalera''' ({{IPA-pt|masimiliˈɐnu ɐ̃ˈtonju kɐvɐˈleɾɐ}}, born August 4, 1969) is a [[Brazil]]ian singer, guitarist, and songwriter who currently plays in [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands [[Soulfly]], [[Cavalera Conspiracy]], and [[Killer Be Killed]]. In 1984, he co-founded the acclaimed thrash metal band [[Sepultura]] with his brother [[Igor Cavalera]] and was the band's lead singer and rhythm guitarist until he left in 1996. Cavalera was also involved in a short-lived side project called [[Nailbomb]].

== Early life and career ==
Max Cavalera's father, Graziano Cavalera, was an employee of the Italian Consulate in [[Belo Horizonte]]. He died at 41 years of age; Cavalera was nine when his father died. Cavalera's family was in a state of financial crisis and family turbulence when he formed [[Sepultura]] with his younger brother [[Igor Cavalera|Igor]]. In the early 1990s, he relocated to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], Arizona. He did not begin to make spiritual music until after he quit Sepultura. His earlier lyrics for Soulfly were influenced by religion and [[spirituality]], though he is critical of religion. His later albums, starting with ''[[Dark Ages (album)|Dark Ages]]'', began to incorporate lyrical themes of violence, warfare, anger and hatred. His albums have all been dedicated to God, and he has often been depicted by the press as a man of religion, especially in the United States, something that Cavalera himself says he does not understand:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I do hate a lot of "religion", but people like [[Jesus|Christ]] – yeah they inspire me. I mean if you look at Christ, He was hanging around with the lowlifes, prostitutes and the losers you know, not going around with those [[upper class|high society]] motherfuckers you see trying to sell Jesus today!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicomh.com/interviews/soulfly-2_0306.htm |title=Soulfly : interview |publisher=Musicomh.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When asked in an interview whether he was a Christian and whether Soulfly was a Christian band, he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No. I mean, if I was a Christian I would wear all these different kinds of omens. Because Christian people are so close-minded. A priest would not accept that. So I don't like the concept of Christianity in terms of being so close-minded. It is the same with music. Sometimes I compare preachers to close-minded musicians or close-minded listeners, who only like one kind of music. Some preachers are the same. And they don't tolerate Hindus, Buddhists or whatever. Only them. It's bullshit. So Soulfly is not a Christian band at all. Very much opposite. But we are very spiritual. Spiritual has nothing to do with Christianity anyway. It has been here since the beginning of time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soulflyweb.com/interviews/interview0504.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409205813/http://www.soulflyweb.com/interviews/interview0504.html |date=April 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In another interview, he was asked about the [[Varg Vikernes]] church burnings. He quoted, "I support church burnings 100 percent, but why don't we just burn everything. Mosques, temples, all religious buildings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SOULFLY on church burnings|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JparJCZAw|website=Youtube|publisher=TV2 Norway (2009)|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he later claimed his views changed about the church burnings and called them "too violent". He has stated that he does believe in God, "But it might be different than the God the preacher preaches about."{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Of enduring influence to his music, is the untimely death of his stepson, Dana Wells, who was killed after the release of ''[[Roots (Sepultura album)|Roots]]'' in 1996. The songs "[[Bleed (Soulfly song)|Bleed]]", "First Commandment", "Pain", "[[Tree of Pain]]" and "Revengeance" are tributes to Wells, as well as [[Deftones]]' song "Headup", in which Cavalera featured and co-wrote. He reunited with his brother Igor, in their band [[Cavalera Conspiracy]], and wrote and performed on Soulfly's ''[[Conquer (album)|Conquer]]'', released in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fangoria.com/musick/musick-news/3872-exclusive-talking-music-a-horror-with-max-cavalera-of-soulfly.html Exclusive: Talking Music &amp; Horror with Max Cavalera of SOULFLY] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916060001/http://www.fangoria.com/musick/musick-news/3872-exclusive-talking-music-a-horror-with-max-cavalera-of-soulfly.html |date=September 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Conversation with the Cavalera Conspiracy and Soulfly Vocalist|url=http://heavymetal.about.com/od/interviews/a/maxcavalera.htm|work=About.com|publisher=heavymetal.about.com|accessdate=May 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Cavalera appears in ''[[Grand Theft Auto: The Lost and Damned]]'' as himself on radio station [[Grand Theft Auto IV soundtrack#LCHC – Liberty City Hardcore|LCHC]].

In 2013, Cavalera released his autobiography, titled ''My Bloody Roots''; his co-writer was the British author [[Joel McIver]] and the book's foreword was written by [[Dave Grohl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=166066 |title=MAX CAVALERA's Autobiography To Include Foreword By DAVE GROHL |publisher=BlabberMouth |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115044306/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=166066 |archivedate=November 15, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=May 2015}}
Cavalera has lived in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], since 1992 with his wife Gloria (b. 1953) and his five children, [[Zyon Cavalera|Zyon]] (b. January 19, 1993), Igor (b. July 2, 1995), Jason (b. December 1, 1986), Richie (b. August 25, 1985) and Roxanne (b. November 14, 1983). The three eldest, Gloria's children, were adopted by Cavalera, making Cavalera their legal father. Zyon, Igor and Richie have all collaborated with Cavalera in his various projects. Three of his sons are also active in music, with Richie fronting [[Incite (band)|Incite]] and Igor and Zyon performing in [[Lody Kong]]. Jason tours as Zyon's drum tech, amongst other various duties behind the scenes.  In 2012 and 2013, Zyon toured with Soulfly after [[David Kinkade]]'s retirement, and now he is a regular member as drummer. Igor briefly filled in as bassist for Soulfly in 2015 after [[Tony Campos]] left the band, and toured as keyboardist and co-vocalist during Soulfly's ''Point Blank'' Tour. Igor was born with [[type 1 diabetes]], and Max and Gloria set up the '''Iggy Fund''' in 1998 to help other families get necessary medicine for their children with juvenile diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://loudwire.com/max-cavalera-universal-healthcare-diabetes-fund/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mexicans''' ({{lang-es|mexicanos}}) are the people of the [[Mexico|United Mexican States]], a multiethnic country in [[North America]]. Mexicans can also be those who identify with the Mexican [[Cultural identity|cultural]] or [[Nationality|national identity]].

The [[Mexica]] founded Mexico-Tenochtitlan in 1325 as an ''[[altepetl]]'' ([[city-state]]) located on an island in [[Lake Texcoco]], in the [[Valley of Mexico]]. It became the capital of the expanding [[Aztec Triple Alliance|Mexica Empire]] in the 15th century,&lt;ref name="tenochtitlan capital"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tenochtitlán, la capital azteca |url=http://www.historiang.com/articulo.jsp?id=1606479 |publisher=''www.historiang.com'' |accessdate=8 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919203346/http://www.historiang.com/articulo.jsp?id=1606479 |archivedate=19 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; until [[Fall of Tenochtitlan|captured by the Spanish in 1521]]. At its peak, it was the largest [[city-state|city]] in the [[Pre-Columbian]] [[Americas]]. It subsequently became a ''[[Municipalities of Mexico|cabecera]]'' of the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]]. Today the ruins of Tenochtitlan are located in the central part of [[Mexico City]].

The modern nation of Mexico achieved independence from the [[Spanish Empire]]; this began the process of forging a national identity that fused the cultural traits of indigenous pre-Columbian origin with those of European, particularly Iberian, ancestry. This led to what has been termed "a peculiar form of multi-ethnic nationalism".&lt;ref name="autogenerated115"&gt;Wimmer, Andreas, 2002.

The most spoken language by Mexicans is [[Mexican Spanish]], but some may also speak languages from 68 different [[Languages of Mexico|indigenous linguistic groups]] and other languages brought to Mexico by recent immigration or learned by Mexican immigrants residing in other nations.

[[File:De la Conquista a 1930 (2011).jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[Mexican muralism|Mural]] by [[Diego Rivera]] at the [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]] depicting the history of Mexico from the Conquest to early 20th century]]
The Mexican people have varied origins and an identity that has evolved with the succession of conquests among Amerindian groups and later by Europeans. The area that is now modern-day Mexico has cradled many predecessor civilizations, going back as far as the [[Olmec]] which influenced the latter civilizations of [[Teotihuacan]] (200 B.C. to 700 A.D.) and the much debated [[Toltec]] people who flourished around the 10th and 12th centuries A.D., and ending with the last great indigenous civilization before the [[Spanish Conquest]], the [[Aztec]]s (13 March 1325 to 13 August 1521). The Nahuatl language was a common tongue in the region of modern Central Mexico during the Aztec Empire, but after the arrival of Europeans the common language of the region became Spanish.

After the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|conquest of the Aztec empire]], the Spanish re-administered the land and expanded their own empire beyond the former boundaries of the Aztec, adding more territory to the Mexican sphere of influence which remained under the Spanish Crown for 300 years. Cultural diffusion and intermixing among the Amerindian populations with the European created the modern Mexican identity which is a mixture of regional indigenous and European cultures that evolved into a national culture during the Spanish period. This new identity was defined as "''Mexican''" shortly after the [[Mexican War of Independence]] and was more invigorated and developed after the [[Mexican Revolution]] when the [[Constitution of Mexico|Constitution of 1917]] officially established Mexico as an indivisible pluricultural nation founded on its indigenous roots.

==Definitions==
&lt;!-- In this section there should be a detailed elaboration of the Mexican identity as Mexicans themselves see it. "Mexican" is not merely a nationality in the eyes of Mexicans, it is their ethnic identity. Authors like Octavio Paz, Jose vasconcelos, Juan Rulfo, Rosario Castellanos, should be looked up. In the proceeding sections is where race and ethnicity is tackled in more detail such as the racial composition of the Mexican majority as well as the regional cultures of different Mexican states and indigenous groups.--&gt;

''Mexicano'' (Mexican) is derived from the word ''[[Mexico]]'' itself. In the principal model to create [[demonym]]s in Spanish, the suffix ''-ano'' is added to the name of the place of origin.

It has been suggested that the name of the country is derived from [[Mextli]] or Mēxihtli, a secret name for the god of war and patron of the Mexicas, [[Huitzilopochtli]], in which case Mēxihco means "Place where Huitzilopochtli lives".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Aguilar-Moreno|first=Manuel|title=Handbook to Life in the Aztec World|year=2006|publisher=Facts of Life|isbn=0-8160-5673-0|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another hypothesis&lt;ref name=edomex/&gt; suggests that ''Mēxihco'' derives from the Nahuatl words for "Moon" (''Mētztli'') and navel (''xīctli''). This meaning ("Place at the Center of the Moon") might then refer to Tenochtitlan's position in the middle of [[Lake Texcoco]]. The system of interconnected lakes, of which Texcoco formed the center, had the form of a rabbit, which the Mesoamericans [[pareidolia|pareidolically]] associated with the [[moon rabbit|Moon]]. Still another hypothesis suggests that it is derived from Mēctli, the goddess of [[Agave americana|maguey]].&lt;ref name="edomex"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nombre del Estado de México|language=Spanish|publisher=Government of the State of Mexico|url=http://www.edomexico.gob.mx/identidad/civica/htm/NomMexico.htm|accessdate=3 October 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070427111842/http://www.edomexico.gob.mx/identidad/civica/htm/NomMexico.htm |archivedate = 27 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Mexicano'' as a word to describe the different peoples of the region of Mexico as a single group emerged in the 16th century. In that time the term did not apply to a nationality nor to the geographical limits of the modern Mexican Republic. The term was used for the first time in the first document printed in [[Barcelona]] in 1566 which documented the expedition which launched from the port in [[Acapulco]] to find the best route which would favor a return journey from the [[East Indies|Spanish East Indies]] to [[New Spain]]. The document stated: "''el venturoso descubrimiento que los Mexicanos han hecho''" (the venturous discovery that the Mexicans have made). That discovery led to the [[Manila galleon]] trade route and those "Mexicans" referred to [[Criollo people|Criollos]], [[Mestizos]] and [[Indigenous peoples in Mexico|Amerindians]] alluding to a plurality of persons who participated for a common end: the conquest of the Philippines in 1565. (Gómez M., et al. 56)

==Ethnic groups==
{{See also|Demographics of Mexico#Ethnography|label 1=Ethnography of Mexico}}

===Mestizo Mexicans===
{{main article|Mestizos in Mexico}}
[[File:General Porfirio Díaz.JPG|200px|thumbnail|left|President [[Porfirio Díaz]] was of Mestizo descent.]]
A large majority of Mexicans have been classified as "Mestizos", meaning in modern Mexican usage that they identify fully neither with any indigenous culture nor with a Spanish cultural heritage, but rather identify as having cultural traits incorporating elements from indigenous and Spanish traditions. By the deliberate efforts of post-revolutionary governments the "Mestizo identity" was constructed as the base of the modern Mexican national identity, through a process of cultural synthesis referred to as ''mestizaje'' {{IPA-es|mestiˈsahe|}}. Mexican politicians and reformers such as [[José Vasconcelos]] and [[Manuel Gamio]] were instrumental in building a Mexican national identity on the concept of mestizaje.&lt;ref name="Wade 1981:32"&gt;Wade (1981:32)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knight (1990:78–85)&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Mestizo identity promoted by the government is more of a cultural identity than a biological one it has achieved a strong influence in the country, with a good number of biologically [[white people]] identifying with it, leading to being considered Mestizos in Mexico's demographic investigations and censuses due the ethnic criteria having its base on cultural traits rather than biological ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/105/10503808.pdf |title=Composición Étnica de las Tres Áreas Culturales del Continente Americano al Comienzo del Siglo XXI |work=Academic investigation |publisher=university of the State of Mexico |year=2005 |accessdate=10 June 2014 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022220348/http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/105/10503808.pdf |archivedate=22 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar situation occurs regarding the distinctions between Indigenous peoples and Mestizos: while the term ''Mestizo'' is sometimes used in English with the meaning of a person with mixed indigenous and European blood, this usage does not conform to the Mexican social reality where a person of pure Indigenous genetic heritage would be considered Mestizo either by rejecting his indigenous culture or by not speaking an indigenous language,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bartolomé|first=Miguel Alberto|title=Pluralismo cultural y redefinicion del estado en México". in Coloquio sobre derechos indígenas|url=http://courses.cit.cornell.edu/iard4010/documents/Pluralismo_cultural_y_redefinicion_del_estado_en_Mexico.pdf|publisher=IOC|location=Oaxaca|page=2|year=1996|quote=En primer lugar cabe destacar que en México la pertenencia racial no es un indicador relevante ni suficiente para denotar una adscripción étnica específica.

[[File:Mestizo.jpg|thumb|250px|An 18th-century [[casta]] painting shows an indigenous woman with her Spanish husband and their Mestizo child.]]
Cultural policies in early post-revolutionary Mexico were paternalistic towards the indigenous people, with efforts designed to "help" indigenous peoples achieve the same level of progress as the rest of society, eventually assimilating indigenous peoples completely to Mestizo Mexican culture, working toward the goal of eventually solving the "Indian problem" by transforming indigenous communities into Mestizo communities.&lt;ref&gt;Bartolomé (1996:5)&lt;/ref&gt;

Given that the word Mestizo has different meanings in Mexico, estimates of the Mexican Mestizo population vary widely. According to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', which uses a biology-based approach, between one half and two thirds of the Mexican population is Mestizo.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mexico- Ethnic groups|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Mexico/Ethnic-groups|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A culture-based estimate gives the percentage of Mestizos as high as 90%.&lt;ref name="EL MESTIZAJE Y LAS CULTURAS REGIONALES"&gt;[http://www.nacionmulticultural.unam.mx/Portal/Izquierdo/BANCO/Mxmulticultural/Elmestizajeylasculturas-elmestizaje.html en el censo de 1930 el gobierno mexicano dejó de clasificar a la población del país en tres categorías raciales, blanco, mestizo e indígena, y adoptó una nueva clasificación étnica que distinguía a los hablantes de lenguas indígenas del resto de la población, es decir de los hablantes de español.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823015618/http://www.nacionmulticultural.unam.mx/Portal/Izquierdo/BANCO/Mxmulticultural/Elmestizajeylasculturas-elmestizaje.html |date=23 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paradoxically, the word Mestizo has long been dropped from popular Mexican vocabulary, with the word even having pejorative connotations,&lt;ref name="Bartolomé 1996:2" /&gt; which further complicates attempts to quantify Mestizos via self-identification.

While for most of its history the concept of Mestizo and Mestizaje has been lauded by Mexico's intellectual circles, in recent times the concept has been target of criticism, with its detractors claiming that it delegitimizes racist practices in Mexico under the idea of "(Racism) Not existing here (Mexico), as everybody is Mestizo" the Mestizo ideology thus, has cemented a terrain of resistance in regards to social, politic and academic mobility around the theme of race in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El archivo del estudio de racismo en Mexico|url=http://www.scielo.org.mx/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1405-92742016000200092&amp;lng=pt&amp;nrm=iso|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804041510/http://www.scielo.org.mx/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1405-92742016000200092&amp;lng=pt&amp;nrm=iso|archivedate=4 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the authors conclude that Mexico introducing a real racial classification and accepting itself as a multicultural country opposed to a monolithic Mestizo country would bring benefits to the Mexican society as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El mestizaje en Mexico|url=http://enp4.unam.mx/amc/libro_munioz_cota/libro/cap4/lec10_federiconavarreteelmestizaje.pdf

According to 20th and 21st century academics, large scale intermixing between the [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European immigrants]] and the native [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|Indigenous peoples]] would produce a Mestizo group which would become the overwhelming majority of Mexico's population by the time of [[Mexican War of Independence|Independence]].&lt;ref name="fnavarrete"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nacionmulticultural.unam.mx/Portal/Izquierdo/BANCO/Mxmulticultural/Elmestizajeylasculturas-elmestizaje.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130823015618/http://www.nacionmulticultural.unam.mx/Portal/Izquierdo/BANCO/Mxmulticultural/Elmestizajeylasculturas-elmestizaje.html |archivedate= 23 August 2013 |title=El mestizaje y las culturas |first=Federico |last=Navarrete |work=México Multicultural |publisher=[[UNAM]] |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Mixed race and cultures |accessdate=19 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However according to church registers from the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|colonial times]], the majority (73%) of Spanish men married with Spanish women.

Mexico's northern and western regions have the highest percentages of [[Ethnic groups of Europe|European]] population, with the majority of the people not having native admixture or being of predominantly European ancestry, resembling in aspect that of [[Spaniards|northern Spaniards]].&lt;ref name="UnitedStatesandMexico"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Howard F.

The northeast region, in which the indigenous population was eliminated by early European settlers, became the region with the highest proportion of whites during the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|Spanish colonial period]]. However, recent immigrants from southern Mexico have been changing, to some degree, its demographic trends.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elsiglodetorreon.com.mx/noticia/123878] {{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The White population of central Mexico, despite not being as numerous as in the north due to higher mixing, is ethnically more diverse, as there are large numbers of other European and Middle Eastern ethnic groups, aside from Spaniards. This also results in non-[[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] [[surname]]s (mostly French, German, Italian and Arab) being more common in central Mexico, especially in the country's [[Mexico City|capital]] and in the state of [[Jalisco]].

===Indigenous Mexicans===

[[File:Naucalpan Benito Juárez.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|[[Benito Juárez]] was the first President of Indigenous descent in Mexico]]
The 2003 [[Ley General de Derechos Lingüísticos de los Pueblos Indígenas|General Law of Linguistic Rights of the Indigenous Peoples]] recognizes 62 [[languages of Mexico|indigenous languages]] as "national languages" which have the same validity as Spanish in all territories in which they are spoken.&lt;ref name="diputados.gob.mx"&gt;[http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/257.pdf Ley General de Derechos Lingüísticos de los Pueblos Indígenas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611011220/http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/257.pdf |date=11 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The recognition of indigenous languages and the protection of indigenous cultures is granted not only to the ethnic groups indigenous to modern-day Mexican territory, but also to other North American indigenous groups that migrated to Mexico from the [[United States]]&lt;ref name="Kikapú"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdi.gob.mx/index.php?id_seccion=1398|title=Comisión Nacional para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indígenas – México|website=Cdi.gob.mx|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the nineteenth century and those who immigrated from [[Guatemala]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="cdi.gob.mx"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdi.gob.mx/index.php?id_seccion=1378 |title=Comisión Nacional para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indígenas – México |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926232909/http://cdi.gob.mx/index.php?id_seccion=1378 |archivedate=26 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The category of "indigena" (indigenous) in Mexico has been defined based on different criteria through history, this means that the percentage of the Mexican population defined as "indigenous" varies according to the definition applied. It can be defined narrowly according to linguistic criteria including only persons that speak an indigenous language, based on this criteria approximately 5.4% of the population is Indigenous.&lt;ref name="inegi1"/&gt; Nonetheless, activists for the rights of indigenous peoples have referred to the usage of this criteria for census purposes as "statistical genocide"&lt;ref&gt;Knight (1990:73-74)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bartolomé (1996:3-4)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other surveys made by the Mexican government do count as Indigenous all persons who speak an indigenous language and people who do not speak indigenous languages nor live in indigenous communities but self-identifies as Indigenous. According to this criteria, the [[National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples]] (Comisión Nacional para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indígenas, or CDI in Spanish) and the [[National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Mexico)|INEGI]] (Mexico's National Institute of Statistics and Geography), state that there are 15.7 million indigenous people in Mexico of many different ethnic groups,&lt;ref name=CDI1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdi.gob.mx/cedulas/sintesis_resultados_2005.pdf |title=Síntesis de Resultados |publisher=Comisión Nacional para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indígenas |year=2006 |accessdate=22 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which constitute 14.9% of the population in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Defined as persons who live in a household where an indigenous language is spoken by one of the adult family members, and or people who self identified as indigenous ("Criteria del hogar: De esta manera, se establece, que los hogares indígenas son aquellos en donde el jefe y/o el cónyuge y/o padre o madre del jefe y/o suegro o suegra del jefe hablan una lengua indígena y también aquellos que declararon pertenecer a un grupo indígena."[http://www.cdi.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=272&amp;Itemid=58])AND persons who speak an indigenous language but who do not live in such a household (Por lo antes mencionado, la Comisión Nacional Para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indígenas de México (CDI) considera población indígena (PI) a todas las personas que forman parte de un hogar indígena, donde el jefe(a) del hogar, su cónyuge y/o alguno de los ascendientes (madre o padre, madrastra o padrastro, abuelo(a), bisabuelo(a), tatarabuelo(a), suegro(a)) declaro ser hablante de lengua indígena.

According to the latest intercensal survey carried out by the Mexican government on 2015, Indigenous people make up 21.5% of Mexico's population. In this occasion, people who self-identified as "Indigenous" and people who self-identified as "partially Indigenous" were classified in the "Indigenous" category altogether.&lt;ref name="Encuesta Intercensal 2015"/&gt;

The absolute indigenous population is growing, but at a slower rate than the rest of the population so that the percentage of indigenous peoples is nonetheless falling.&lt;ref name="inegi1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/rutinas/ept.asp?t=mlen01&amp;c=3325 |title=Indicadores seleccionados sobre la población hablante de lengua indígena, 1950 a 2005 |publisher=Inegi.gob.mx |accessdate=10 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118010024/http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/rutinas/ept.asp?t=mlen01&amp;c=3325 |archivedate=18 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2011/03/30/inegi-cada-vez-mas-mexicanos-hablan-una-lengua-indigena |title=INEGI: Cada vez más mexicanos hablan una lengua indígena – Nacional – CNNMéxico.com |publisher=Mexico.cnn.com |date=30 March 2011 |accessdate=10 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111206133901/http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2011/03/30/inegi-cada-vez-mas-mexicanos-hablan-una-lengua-indigena |archivedate=6 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdi.gob.mx/index2.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_view&amp;gid=62&amp;Itemid=24|title=Comisión Nacional para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indígenas – México|website=Cdi.gob.mx|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the indigenous population is concentrated in the central-southern and south-eastern states, with the majority of the indigenous population living in rural areas.

{{main article|Arab Mexicans}}
{{refimprove section|date=May 2018}}
[[File:Carlos Slim Helú.jpg|thumbnail|175px|left|[[Carlos Slim]] is of [[Lebanese Mexican|Lebanese descent]].]]
An Arab Mexican is a [[Mexico|Mexican]] citizen of [[Arabic]]-speaking origin who can be of various ancestral origins. The vast majority of Mexico's 1.1 million Arabs are from either [[Lebanon|Lebanese]], [[Syria]]n, [[Iraq]]i, or [[Palestine (region)|Palestinian]] background.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Page needed|date=July 2010}}{{cite web|url=http://confines.mty.itesm.mx/articulos2/GarciaRE.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=17 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327124211/https://confines.mty.itesm.mx/articulos2/GarciaRE.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interethnic marriage in the Arab community, regardless of religious affiliation, is very high; most community members have only one parent who has Arab ethnicity. As a result of this, the Arab community in Mexico shows marked [[language shift]] away from Arabic. Only a few speak any Arabic, and such knowledge is often limited to a few basic words. Instead the majority, especially those of younger generations, speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as a first language. Today, the most common Arabic [[surnames]] in Mexico include Nader, Hayek, Ali, Haddad, Nasser, Malik, Abed, Mansoor, Harb and Elias.

Arab immigration to Mexico started in the 19th and early 20th centuries.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Roughly 100,000 Arabic-speakers settled in Mexico during this time period. They came mostly from [[Lebanon]], Syria, [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and [[Iraq]] and settled in significant numbers in [[Nayarit]], [[Puebla]], [[Mexico City]] and the Northern part of the country (mainly in the states of [[Baja California]], [[Tamaulipas]], [[Nuevo Leon]], [[Sinaloa]], Chihuahua, [[Coahuila]], and [[Durango]], as well as the city of [[Tampico]] and [[Guadalajara]]. The term "Arab Mexican" may include ethnic groups that do not in fact identify as Arab.

During the Israel-Lebanon war in 1948 and during the Six-Day War, thousands of Lebanese left Lebanon and went to Mexico. They first arrived in Veracruz. Although Arabs made up less than 5% of the total immigrant population in Mexico during the 1930s, they constituted half of the immigrant economic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://confines.mty.itesm.mx/articulos2/GarciaRE.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=17 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327124211/https://confines.mty.itesm.mx/articulos2/GarciaRE.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immigration of Arabs in Mexico has influenced Mexican culture, in particular food, where they have introduced [[Kibbeh]], [[Tabbouleh]] and even created recipes such as ''[[Tacos Árabes]]''. By 1765,{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} [[Phoenix dactylifera|Dates]], which originated from the Middle East, were introduced into Mexico by the Spaniards. The fusion between Arab and Mexican food has highly influenced the [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatecan]] cuisine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discoverymexico.com/Culture/Arab-Influence-in-Yucatecan-Cuisine/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316235742/http://www.discoverymexico.com/Culture/Arab-Influence-in-Yucatecan-Cuisine/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=16 March 2008|title=Arab Influence in Yucatecan Cuisine – Mexico Culture – Arab Influence in Yucatecan Cuisine, Culture|date=16 March 2008|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another concentration of Arab-Mexicans is in [[Baja California]] facing the U.S.-Mexican border, esp. in cities of [[Mexicali, Baja California|Mexicali]] in the [[Imperial Valley (California)|Imperial Valley]] U.S./Mexico, and [[Tijuana, Baja California|Tijuana]] across from [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] with a large [[Arab American]] community (about 280,000), some of whose families have relatives in Mexico. 45% of Arab Mexicans are of [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] descent.

The majority of Arab-Mexicans are Christians who belong to the [[Maronite Church]], [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox Churches|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Rite Catholic Churches]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-536840/Marin-Guzman-Roberto-and-Zidane.html|title=Find Local Contractors - Home Remodeling Contractors on Ecnext|website=goliath.ecnext.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A scant number are [[Muslims]] and [[Jews]] of Middle Eastern origins.

===Afro-Mexicans===
{{main article|Afro-Mexicans}}
[[File:PuntaMaldonado18.JPG|thumbnail|225px|right|Afromestiza girls in Punta Maldonado, [[Cuajinicuilapa]], [[Guerrero]]]]
Afro-Mexicans are an ethnic group that predominate in certain areas of Mexico. Such as the [[Costa Chica of Oaxaca]] and the [[Costa Chica of Guerrero]], Veracruz (e.g. [[Yanga, Veracruz|Yanga]]) and in some towns in northern Mexico. The existence of blacks in Mexico is unknown, denied or diminished in both Mexico and abroad for a number of reasons: their small numbers, heavy intermarriage with other ethnic groups and Mexico's tradition of defining itself as a "mestizaje" or mixing of European and indigenous. Mexico did have an active slave trade since the early Spanish period but from the beginning, intermarriage and mixed race offspring created an elaborate caste system. This system broke down in the very late Spanish period and after Independence the legal notion of race was eliminated. The creation of a national Mexican identity, especially after the Mexican Revolution, emphasized Mexico's indigenous and European past actively or passively eliminating its African one from popular consciousness.

The majority of Mexico's native Afro-descendants are ''Afromestizos'', i.e. "mixed-race". Individuals with significantly high amounts of African ancestry make up a very low percentage of the total Mexican population, the majority being recent black immigrants from Africa, the Caribbean and elsewhere in the Americas. According to the Intercensal survey carried out by the Mexican government, Afro-Mexicans make up 1.2% of Mexico's population, the Afro-Mexican category in the Intercensal survey includes people who self-identified solely as African and people who self-identified as partially African. The survey also states that 64.9% (896,829) of Afro-Mexicans also identified as indigenous, with 9.3% being speakers of [[Languages of Mexico|indigenous languages]].&lt;ref name="Encuesta Intercensal 2015"/&gt;

===Asian Mexicans===
{{main article|Asian Mexicans}}
[[File:Comunidad japonesa de Monterrey.jpg|thumbnail|[[Japanese Mexican]] youths in [[Monterrey]]]]
Asian Mexicans make up less than 1% of the total population of modern [[Mexico]], nonetheless they are a notable minority. Due to the historical and contemporary perception in Mexican society of what constitutes Asian culture (associated with the [[Far East]] rather than the [[Near East]]), Asian Mexicans are of [[East Asian|East]], [[South Asian|South]] and [[Southeast Asian]] descent and Mexicans of [[West Asian]] descent are not considered to be part of the group.

Asian immigration began with the arrival of [[Filipinos]] to Mexico during the Spanish period. For two and a half centuries, between 1565 and 1815, many Filipinos and Mexicans sailed to and from Mexico and the Philippines as sailors, crews, slaves, prisoners, adventurers and soldiers in the [[Manila-Acapulco Galleon]] assisting [[Spain]] in its trade between Asia and the Americas. Also on these voyages, thousands of Asian individuals (mostly males) were brought to Mexico as slaves and were called "Chino",&lt;ref name="Seijas"&gt;{{cite book|author= Tatiana Seijas| title=Asian Slaves in Colonial Mexico: From Chinos to Indian |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YCWjAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PR6&amp;focus=viewport&amp;dq=Asians+in+Mexico&amp;output=html_text | date= 2014|publisher= Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107063129 | page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; which meant Chinese.

She arrived in [[New Spain]] and eventually she gave rise to the "[[China Poblana]]".

These early individuals are not very apparent in modern Mexico for two main reasons: the widespread ''[[mestizaje]]'' of Mexico during the Spanish period and the common practice of ''Chino'' slaves to "[[Passing (racial identity)|pass]]" as ''Indios'' (the indigenous people of Mexico) in order to attain freedom. As had occurred with a large portion of Mexico's black population, over generations the Asian populace was absorbed into the general [[Mestizo]] population. Facilitating this [[miscegenation]] was the assimilation of Asians into the indigenous population. The indigenous people were legally protected from [[chattel slavery]], and by being recognized as part of this group, Asian slaves could claim they were wrongly enslaved.

Asians, predominantly Chinese, became Mexico's fastest-growing immigrant group from the 1880s to the 1920s, exploding from about 1,500 in 1895 to more than 20,000 in 1910.&lt;ref name="Buchenau"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Buchenau |first1=Jürgen |date=Spring 2001 |title= Small Numbers, Great Impact: Mexico and Its Immigrants, 1821-1973 |url=http://www.u.arizona.edu/~rgolden/MexicoImmigration.pdf |journal=Journal of American Ethnic History |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=35 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Today===
Ethnic relations in modern Mexico have grown out of the historical context of the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico|arrival of Europeans]], the subsequent Spanish period of cultural and genetic miscegenation within the frame work of the [[castas]] system, the revolutionary periods focus on incorporating all ethnic and racial group into a common Mexican national identity and the indigenous revival of the late 20th century. The resulting picture has been called "a peculiar form of multi-ethnic nationalism".&lt;ref name="autogenerated115"/&gt;

Very generally speaking ethnic relations can be arranged on an axis between the two extremes of European and Amerindian cultural heritage, this is a remnant of the Spanish caste system which categorized individuals according to their perceived level of biological mixture between the two groups. Additionally the presence of considerable portions of the population with partly African and Asian heritage further complicates the situation.&lt;ref name="Frudakis2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Frudakis |first=Tony Nick|title=Molecular photofitting: predicting ancestry and phenotype using DNA|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9vXeydpj7VkC&amp;pg=PA348|year=2008|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-12-088492-6|page=348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though it still arranges persons along the line between indigenous and European, in practice the classificatory system is no longer biologically based, but rather mixes socio-cultural traits with phenotypical traits, and classification is largely fluid, allowing individuals to move between categories and define their ethnic and racial identities situationally.&lt;ref&gt;Bartolomé (1996:2)"'' fundadores de una "nación mexicana".''"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knight (1990:74)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Official censuses===
Historically, population studies and censuses have never been up to the standards that a population as diverse and numerous such as Mexico's require. The first racial census was made in 1793, being also Mexico's (then known as [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spain]]) first ever nationwide population census. Of it, only part of the original datasets survive. Thus most of what is known of it comes from essays made by researchers who used the census' findings as reference for their own works. More than a century would pass until the Mexican government conducted a new racial census in 1921 (some sources assert that the census of 1895 included a comprehensive racial classification,&lt;ref name="fnavarrete"/&gt; however according to the historic archives of [[National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Mexico)|Mexico's National Institute of Statistics]] that was not the case).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beta.inegi.org.mx/proyectos/ccpv/1895 "censo General de la Republica Mexicana 1895"], "[[INEGI]]", Mexico, Retrieved on 24 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; While the 1921 census was the last time the Mexican government conducted a census that included a comprehensive racial classification, in recent time it has conducted nationwide surveys to quantify most of the ethnic groups who inhabit the country as well as the social dynamics and inequalities between them.

====1793 census====
[[File:Mapa del Virreinato de la Nueva España (1819).svg|thumb|300px|New Spain in 1819 with the boundaries established at the [[Adams-Onís Treaty]]]]
Also known as the "Revillagigedo census" due to its creation being ordered by the Count of the same name, this census was Mexico's (then known as the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]]) first ever nationwide population census. Most of its original datasets have reportedly been lost, thus most of what is now known about it comes from essays and field investigations made by academics who had access to the census data and used it as reference for their works such as Prussian geographer [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. Each author gives different estimations for each racial group in the country although they don't vary much, with Europeans ranging from 18% to 22% of New Spain's population, Mestizos ranging from 21% to 25%, Indians ranging from 51% to 61% and Africans being between 6,000 and 10,000, The estimations given for the total population range from 3,799,561 to 6,122,354. It is concluded then, that across nearly three centuries of colonization, the population growth trends of whites and mestizos were even, while the total percentage of the indigenous population decreased at a rate of 13%-17% per century. The authors assert that rather than whites and mestizos having higher birthrates, the reason for the indigenous population's numbers decreasing lies on them suffering of higher mortality rates, due living in remote locations rather than on cities and towns founded by the Spanish colonists or being at war with them. It is also for these reasons that the number of Indigenous Mexicans presents the greater variation range between publications, as in cases their numbers in a given location were estimated rather than counted, leading to possible overestimations in some provinces and possible underestimations in others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aleph.org.mx/jspui/bitstream/56789/29809/1/17-067-1968-0327.pdf "Consideraciones sobre la población de la Nueva España (1793-1810)"], ''El Colegio de Mexico'', Mexico, Retrieved on 24 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

~&lt;small&gt;Europeans are included within the Mestizo category.&lt;/small&gt;

Regardless of the possible imprecisions related to the counting of Indigenous peoples living outside the colonized areas, the effort that New Spain's authorities put on considering them as subjects is worth mentioning, as censuses made by other colonial or post-colonial countries did not consider American Indians to be citizens/subjects, as example the censuses made by the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]] would only count the inhabitants of the colonized settlements.&lt;ref name=scarecrow&gt;''Historical Dictionary of Argentina''. London: Scarecrow Press, 1978. pp.&amp;nbsp;239–40.&lt;/ref&gt; Other example would be the censuses made by the [[United States]], that did not include Indigenous peoples living among the general population until 1860, and indigenous peoples as a whole until 1900.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/research/census/native-americans/1790-1930.html "American Indians in the Federal Decennial Census"], Retrieved on 25 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

====1921 census====
Made right after the consumation of the Mexican revolution, the social context on which this census was made makes it particularly unique, as the government of the time was in the process of rebuilding the country and was looking forward to unite all Mexicans under a single national identity. The 1921 census' final results in regards to race, which assert that 59.3% of the Mexican population self-identified as Mestizo, 29.1% as Indigenous and only 9.8% as White were then essential to cement the "mestizaje" ideology (that asserts that the Mexican population as a whole is product of the admixture of all races) which shaped Mexican identity and culture through the 20th century and remain prominent nowadays, with extraofficial international publications such as ''[[The World Factbook]]'' and [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] using them as a reference to estimate Mexico's racial composition up to this day.&lt;ref name=CIA-Factbook&gt;{{cite web|title=North America: Mexico|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mx.html|work=The World Factbook|accessdate=11 April 2014|author=Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)|location=Ethnic groups:|quote=mestizo (Amerindian-Spanish) 60%, Amerindian or predominantly Amerindian 30%, white 9%, other 1%}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless in recent times the census' results have been subjected to scrutiny by historians, academics and social activists alike, who assert that such drastic alterations on demographic trends with respect to the 1793 census are not possible and cite, among other statistics, the relatively low frequency of marriages between people of different continental ancestries in colonial and early independent Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://istmo.mx/index.php/2016/07/04/el-mestizaje-es-un-mito-la-identidad-cultural-si-importa/ "El mestizaje es un mito, la identidad cultural sí importa"] ''Istmo'', Mexico, Retrieved on 25 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It is claimed that the "mestizaje" process sponsored by the state was more "cultural than biological" which resulted on the numbers of the Mestizo Mexican group being inflated at the expense of the identity of other races.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dimensionantropologica.inah.gob.mx/?p=7401 "Más desindianización que mestizaje.

When the 1921 census' results are compared with the results of Mexico's recent censuses&lt;ref name="Encuesta Intercensal 2015"/&gt; as well as with modern genetic research,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investigacionyciencia.es/revistas/investigacion-y-ciencia/matemticas-del-planeta-tierra-585/el-impacto-del-mestizaje-en-mxico-11442 "El impacto del mestizaje en México"], "Investigación y Ciencia", Spain, October 2013. Retrieved on 1 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; high consistence is found in regards to the distribution of Indigenous Mexicans across the country, with states located in south and south-eastern Mexico having both, the highest percentages of population that self-identifies as Indigenous and the highest percentages of Amerindian genetic ancestry. However this is not the case when it comes to European Mexicans, as there are instances on which states that have been shown to have a considerably high European ancestry per scientific research are reported to have very small white populations in the 1921 census, with the most extreme case being that of the state of Durango, where the aforementioned census asserts that only 0.01% of the state's population (33 persons) self-identified as "white" while modern scientific research shows that the population of Durango has similar genetic frequences to those found on [[Ethnic groups of Europe|European peoples]] (with the state's Indigenous population showing almost no foreign admixture either).&lt;ref name="Wiley"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/0091270006287586 | volume=46 | title=CYP2D6Genotype and Phenotype in Amerindians of Tepehuano Origin and Mestizos of Durango, Mexico | year=2006 | journal=The Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | pages=527–536 | last1 = Sosa-Macías | first1 = Martha}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various authors theorize that the reason for these inconsistencies may lie in the Mestizo identity promoted by the Mexican government, which reportedly led to people who are not biologically Mestizos to identify as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/105/10503808.pdf |title=Composición Étnica de las Tres Áreas Culturales del Continente Americano al Comienzo del Siglo XXI |work=Academic investigation |publisher=university of the State of Mexico |year=2005 |accessdate=10 June 2014 |language=Spanish |page=196 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022220348/http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/105/10503808.pdf |archivedate=22 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nacionmulticultural.unam.mx/Portal/Izquierdo/BANCO/Mxmulticultural/Elmestizajeylasculturas-elmestizaje.html El mestizaje y las culturas regionales] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823015618/http://www.nacionmulticultural.unam.mx/Portal/Izquierdo/BANCO/Mxmulticultural/Elmestizajeylasculturas-elmestizaje.html |date=23 August 2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Present day====
The following table is a compilation of (when possible) official nationwide surveys conducted by the Mexican government who have attempted to quantify different Mexican ethnic groups. Given that for the most part each ethnic group was estimated by different surveys, with different methodologies and years apart rather than on a single comprehensive racial census, some groups could overlap with others and be overestimated or underestimated.

Of all the ethnic groups that have been surveyed Mestizos are notably absent, which is likely due to the label's fluid and subjective definition, which complicates its precise quantification. However, it can be safely assumed that Mestizos make up at least the remaining 30% unassessed percentage of Mexico's population with possibilities of increasing if the methodologies of the extant surveys are considered. As example the 2015 intercensal survey considered as Indigenous Mexicans and Afro-Mexicans altogether individuals who self-identified as "part Indigenous" or "part African" thus, said people technically would be Mestizos. Similarly, White Mexicans were quantified based on physical traits/appearance, thus technically a Mestizo with a percentage of Indigenous ancestry that was low enough to not affect his/her primarily European phenotype was considered to be white. Finally, the remaining ethnicities, for being of a rather low number or being faiths have more permissive classification criteria, therefore a Mestizo could claim to belong to one of them by practicing the faith, or by having an ancestor who belonged to said ethnicities.

Nonetheless, contemporary sociologists and historians agree that, given that the concept of "race" has a psychological foundation rather than a biological one and to society's eyes a Mestizo with a high percentage of European ancestry is considered "white" and a Mestizo with a high percentage of Indigenous ancestry is considered "Indian", a person that identifies with a given ethnic group should be allowed to, even if biologically he doesn't completely belong to that group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El mestizaje en Mexico|url=http://enp4.unam.mx/amc/libro_munioz_cota/libro/cap4/lec10_federiconavarreteelmestizaje.pdf|format=PDF|website=Enp4.unam.mx|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetic studies===
[[File:Genetic variation of mestizo populations in Latin America.PNG|thumb|250px|The Mexican mestizo population is the most diverse of all the mestizo groups of Hispanic America, with its mestizos being either largely European or Amerindian rather than having a uniform admixture.&lt;ref name="Plos genetics"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1000037|title=Geographic Patterns of Genome Admixture in Latin American Mestizos|journal=PLOS Genetics |date=21 March 2008 |accessdate=9 September 2013|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000037|pmid=18369456|volume=4|pmc=2265669|pages=e1000037 | last1 = Wang | first1 = S | last2 = Ray | first2 = N | last3 = Rojas | first3 = W | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Genetic studies in Mexico can be divided on three groups: studies made on self-identified Mestizos, studies made on Indigenous peoples and studies made on the general Mexican population, studies that focus on Eurodescendant Mexicans or Afro-Mexicans have not been made. Mexicans who self-identify as Mestizos are primarily of [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] and [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|Native American]] ancestry. The third largest component is African, a legacy of the slavery in [[New Spain]] (which saw the importation of some 100,000&lt;ref name="ImmigrationandMigration"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rayna Bailey|title=Immigration and Migration|url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=pVcDEfNxEvAC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=20,000+african+slaves+in+mexico&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=B7nhkAUuGR&amp;sig=lzioUH0PcXpeVziI05JASzjP0xU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwib3-2k-JvUAhWCJiYKHTXSBVMQ6AEIKzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=20%2C000%20african%20slaves%20in%20mexico&amp;f=false|accessdate=June 1, 2017|date=2010|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9780816071067|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 200,000&lt;ref name=INMEGEN /&gt; black slaves). However, geneticists theorize that in regions of Mexico that did not have any presence of slaves, traces of African ancestry might have come from Spanish colonists and not African slaves themselves, as said ancestry is of North African and Near East origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Genoma destapa diferencias de mexicanos|url=http://www.cnnexpansion.com/actualidad/2009/06/04/genoma-destapa-diferencias-de-mexicanos}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the region, some may have small traces of Asian admixture due the thousands of Filipinos and ''Chinos'' (Asian slaves of diverse origin, not just Chinese) that arrived on the ''[[Nao de China]]''. More recent Asian immigration (specifically Chinese) may help explain the comparatively high Asian contribution in Northwest Mexico (i.e., Sonora).&lt;ref name=INMEGEN /&gt;

According to numerous studies, on average, the largest genetic component of Mexicans who self-identify as being Mestizos is indigenous; although the difference in incidence between the indigenous and european composites is relatively small, both representing well over 40% of the genetic composition of mestizos.&lt;ref name=INMEGEN /&gt; In studies made on the general Mexican population (this is, studies where there is no other kind of self-identification than that of being "Mexican") the European ancestral genetic component tends to overtake the indigenous composite. Said increase is the most pronounced on research done on chromosomal maternal ancestry, as while in studies made on self identified Mestizos the European maternal ancestry is as low as only 5%,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Large scale mitochondrial sequencing in Mexican Americans suggests a reappraisal of Native American origins|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/293 |date=7 October 2011|website=Biomedcentral.com|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; on studies done on the general Mexican population the European maternal ancestry increases more than 40 points, with it being 46%,&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=1867092 | pmid=17503322 | doi=10.1086/518313 | volume=80 | title=A genomewide admixture map for Latino populations | year=2007 | journal=Am.

Genetic studies made on indigenous Mexicans reveal a predominant indigenous ancestry but with higher than expected variations on European and African ancestral components. Extant research suggests that geographic location plays a more significative role on determining the genetic makeup of the average Indigenous person than cultural traits do, an example of this is the indigenous population of [[Tlapa de Comonfort|Tlapa]] in the state of [[Guerrero]] that despite for the most part speaking Spanish and having the same cultural customs non-indigenous Mexicans have, shows an indigenous ancestry of 95%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v36/n11s/full/ng1440.html|title=Implications of correlations between skin color and genetic ancestry for biomedical research|first1=E.

===Phenotypical research===
Albeit not as numerous or with a history as long as genetic research in the country, studies regarding the presence of different phenotypical traits (hair color, hair shape, eye color etc.) in Mexicans have been made. Those studies have recently gained the attention of Mexico's government which has begun conducting its own nationwide investigations, with the aim of document dynamics and inequalities on interactions between Mexicans of different ethnicities/races as well as to have a more concise idea of the ethnic composition of the country (a field that has been long neglected at an institutional level in Mexico). The results of these studies effectively refute misconceptions regarding Mexico's population, showing that Mexico is an exceptionally diverse country, where any color or type of trait can be found with ease in any region.

Some studies, such as the one published by the [[American Sociological Association]] refute misconceptions that are very prevalent even among Mexicans themselves, as it found the differences in the frequencies of phenotypical traits such as [[Blond|blond hair]] between the population of the Northern regions of Mexico (where this trait has a frequency of 22.3% - 23.9%) and the population of the Central regions of Mexico (with a frequency of 18.9% to 21.3%) are not as pronounced as are commonly thought to be. Per the methodology of the study, the presence of blond hair was required for a Mexican to be classified as white as "unlike skin color, blond hair does not darken with sun exposure"&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0003122410378232 "Stratification by Skin Color in Contemporary Mexico"], ''SAGE Journals'', Retrieved on 27 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; With a similar methodology, other study, made by the [[Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana|Metropolitan Autonomous University of Mexico ]] calculated the frequency of blond hair at 23%, Mexicans with red [[Red Hair|red-hair]] were classified as "other".&lt;ref name="scielo.org.mx"&gt;[http://www.scielo.org.mx/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0036-36342011000200005 "Racismo y salud mental en estudiantes universitarios en la Ciudad de México"], ''Scielo'', Cuernavaca, April–March 2011.

As the progression from the darker tones to the lightest ones is not as uniform in the palette used by the INEGI (some tones are practically the same while there are marked differences between others) as it is in the CONAPRED's palette, two color categories ended up containing nearly 70% of surveyed Mexicans whereas there were color categories that had less than 1% of Mexicans each. Even though Mexico's government has downplayed the racial connotations of said studies by opting for using the term "light-skinned Mexican" to refer to the segment of Mexico's population who possess European physical traits/appearance and "dark-skinned Mexican" to refer the segment of Mexico's population who does not, the publication of said studies hasn't been free of controversy, specially in the case of the study published in 2017 as besides skin color it also accounted for different socioeconomic factors such as educational achievements and occupational profiles, with media outlets bringing to Mexico's mainstream opinion circles concepts such as systemic racism, white privilege, and colonialism.&lt;ref name=huffpost&gt;[https://www.huffingtonpost.com.mx/2017/06/26/por-estas-razones-el-color-de-piel-de-los-mexicanos-determina-su_a_23001217/ "Por estas razones el color de piel determina las oportunidades de los mexicanos"], ''Huffington post'', 26 July 2017, Retrieved on 30 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Universal&gt;[http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/articulo/nacion/sociedad/2017/06/16/presenta-inegi-estudio-que-relaciona-color-de-piel-con "Presenta INEGI estudio que relaciona color de piel con oportunidades"], ''El Universal'', l6 June 2017, Retrieved on 30 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless it is agreed that to acknowledge that Mexico is a diverse country constitutes a steep in the right direction to fight social inequalities.

In 2018, the new edition of the ENADIS was published, this time being a joint effort by the CONAPRED and the INEGI with collaboration of the [[UNAM]], the [[CONACyT]] and the [[CNDH]].&lt;ref name=ENADIS2017-1&gt;[http://www.cndh.org.mx/sites/all/doc/OtrosDocumentos/Doc_2018_061.pdf "Encuesta Nacional sobre Discriminación 2017"], ''CNDH'', 6 August 2018, Retrieved on 10 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Like it's 2010 antecesor, it surveyed Mexican citizens about topics related to discrimination and collected data related to phenotype and ethnic self-identification. It concluded that Mexico is still a fairly conservative country regarding minority groups such as religious minorities, ethnic minorities, foreigners, members of the LGBT collective etc. albeit there's pronounced regional differences, with states in the south-center regions of Mexico having in general notoriously higher discrimination rates towards the aforementioned social groups than the ones states in the western-north regions have.&lt;ref name=ENADIS2017-1/&gt; For the collecting of data related to skin color the palette used was again the PERLA one. This time 11% of Mexicans were reported to have "dark skin tones (A-E)"  59% to have "medium skin tones (F-G)" and 29% to have "ligh skin tones (H-K)".&lt;ref name=ENADIS2017-1/&gt; The reason for the huge difference regarding the reported percentages of Mexicans with light skin (around 18% lower) and medium skin (around 16% higher) in the relation to previous nationwide surveys lies in the fact that the ENADIS 2017 prioritized the surveying of Mexicans from "vulnerable groups" which among other measures meant that states with known high numbers of people from said groups surveyed more people.&lt;ref name=ENADIS2017-2&gt;[http://www.beta.inegi.org.mx/contenidos/proyectos/enchogares/especiales/enadis/2017/doc/enadis2017_diseno_muestral.pdf "Encuesta Nacional sobre Discriminación 2017.

[[Mexican Spanish]] is distinct in dialect, tone and syntax to the [[Peninsular Spanish]] spoken in Spain. It contains a large amount of loan words from indigenous languages, mostly from the [[Nahuatl]] language such as: "chocolate", "tomate", "mezquite", "chile", and "coyote".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.todaytranslations.com/language-history/spanish-language-history |title=Spanish Language History and Main Spanish-Speaking Countries |publisher=Todaytranslations.com |accessdate=26 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080817154430/http://www.todaytranslations.com/language-history/spanish-language-history/ |archivedate=17 August 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexican culture reflects the complexity of the [[History of Mexico|country's history]] through the blending of indigenous cultures and the [[culture of Spain]], imparted during Spain's 300-year colonization of Mexico. Exogenous cultural elements mainly from the United States have been incorporated into Mexican culture.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The Porfirian era (''el [[Porfirio Díaz|Porfiriato]]''), in the last quarter of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th century, was marked by economic progress and peace. After four decades of civil unrest and war, Mexico saw the development of philosophy and the arts, promoted by President Díaz himself. Since that time, as accentuated during the [[Mexican Revolution]], cultural identity has had its foundation in the ''mestizaje'', of which the indigenous (i.e. Amerindian) element is the core. In light of the various ethnicities that formed the Mexican people, [[José Vasconcelos]] in his publication ''La Raza Cósmica'' (The Cosmic Race) (1925) defined Mexico to be the melting pot of all races (thus extending the definition of the ''mestizo'') not only biologically but culturally as well.&lt;ref name="vasconcelos160"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Vasconcelos|first=José|others=Didier T. Jaén (trans.)|title=La Raza Cósmica (The Cosmic Race)|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|year=1997|isbn=0-8018-5655-8|page=160 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This exalting of ''mestizaje'' was a revolutionary idea that sharply contrasted with the idea of a superior pure race prevalent in Europe at the time.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

===Literature===
{{Main article|Mexican literature|Mesoamerican literature}}
The literature of Mexico has its antecedents in the literatures of the indigenous settlements of Mesoamerica. The most well known prehispanic poet is [[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Nezahualcoyotl]]. Modern Mexican literature was influenced by the concepts of the Spanish colonialization of [[Mesoamerica]]. Outstanding writers and poets from the Spanish period include [[Juan Ruiz de Alarcón]] and [[Juana Inés de la Cruz]].

In light of the various ethnicities that formed the Mexican people, [[José Vasconcelos]] in his publication [[La Raza Cósmica]] (The Cosmic Race) (1925) defined Mexico to be the melting pot of all races, biologically as well as culturally.&lt;ref name="vasconcelos160"/&gt;

Other writers include [[Alfonso Reyes]], [[José Joaquín Fernández de Lizardi]], [[Ignacio Manuel Altamirano]], [[Carlos Fuentes]], [[Octavio Paz]] (Nobel Laureate), [[Renato Leduc]], [[Carlos Monsiváis]], [[Elena Poniatowska]], [[Mariano Azuela]] ("Los de abajo") and [[Juan Rulfo]] ("Pedro Páramo"). [[Bruno Traven]] wrote "Canasta de cuentos mexicanos", "El tesoro de la Sierra Madre."

The [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] was officially established in 1910,&lt;ref&gt;Coerver, Pasztor &amp; Buffington (2004), p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; and the university become one of the most important institutes of higher learning in Mexico.&lt;ref name="page285"&gt;Summerfield, Devine &amp; Levi (1998), p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; UNAM provides world class education in science, medicine, and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Summerfield, Devine &amp; Levi (1998), p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; Many scientific institutes and new institutes of higher learning, such as [[National Polytechnic Institute]] (founded in 1936),&lt;ref&gt;Forest &amp; Altbach (2006), p. 882&lt;/ref&gt; were established during the first half of the 20th century. Most of the new research institutes were created within UNAM. Twelve institutes were integrated into UNAM from 1929 to 1973.&lt;ref name="page18"&gt;Fortes &amp; Lomnitz (1990), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, the [[Mexican Academy of Sciences]] was created to coordinate scientific efforts between academics.

In 1995 the Mexican chemist [[Mario J. Molina]] shared the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] with [[Paul J. Crutzen]] and [[F. Sherwood Rowland]] for their work in atmospheric chemistry, particularly concerning the formation and decomposition of ozone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1995/index.html |title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1995 |accessdate=2 January 2009 |work=Nobelprize.org |publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molina, an alumnus of UNAM, became the first Mexican citizen to win the Nobel Prize in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/1995/molina-1018.html |title=Molina wins Nobel Prize for ozone work |accessdate=2 January 2009 |author=Thomson, Elizabeth A. |date=18 October 1995 |publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the largest scientific project being developed in Mexico was the construction of the [[Large Millimeter Telescope]] (Gran Telescopio Milimétrico, GMT), the world's largest and most sensitive single-aperture telescope in its frequency range.&lt;ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2011}}Unravelling unidentified γ-ray sources with the large millimeter telescope, Alberto Carramiñana and the LMT-GTM collaboration, in ''The Multi-Messenger Approach to High-Energy Gamma-Ray Sources'', Josep M.

{{See also|List of Mexican composers of classical music}}

Mexican society enjoys a vast array of music genres, showing the diversity of Mexican culture. Traditional music includes [[Mariachi]], [[banda music|Banda]], [[Norteño (music)|Norteño]], [[Ranchera]] and [[Corrido]]s; on an everyday basis most Mexicans listen to contemporary music such as [[Mexican pop music|pop]], rock, etc. in both English and Spanish. Mexico has the largest media industry in Hispanic America, producing Mexican artists who are famous in Central and South America and parts of Europe, especially Spain.

Some well-known Mexican singers are [[Thalía]], [[Luis Miguel]], [[Alejandro Fernández]], [[Julieta Venegas]] and [[Paulina Rubio]]. Mexican singers of traditional music are [[Lila Downs]], [[Susana Harp]], [[Jaramar]], [[GEO Meneses]] and [[Alejandra Robles]]. Popular groups are [[Café Tacuba]], [[Molotov (band)|Molotov]] and [[Maná]], among others. Since the early years of the 2000s (decade), [[Mexican rock]] has seen widespread growth both domestically and internationally.

===Cinema===
{{Main article|Cinema of Mexico}}

[[Cinema of Mexico|Mexican films]] from the [[Golden Age of Mexican cinema|Golden Age]] in the 1940s and 1950s are the greatest examples of Hispanic American cinema, with a huge industry comparable to the Hollywood of those years. Mexican films were exported and exhibited in all of Hispanic America and Europe. ''[[Maria Candelaria]]'' (1944) by [[Emilio Fernández]], was one of the first films awarded a [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 1946, the first time the event was held after World War II. The famous Spanish-born director [[Luis Buñuel]] realized in Mexico, between 1947 and 1965 some of his master pieces like ''[[Los Olvidados]]'' (1949), ''[[Viridiana]]'' (1961) and ''[[El angel exterminador]]'' (1963). Famous actors and actresses from this period include [[María Félix]], [[Pedro Infante]], [[Dolores del Río]], [[Jorge Negrete]] and the comedian [[Cantinflas]].

More recently, films such as ''[[Like Water for Chocolate (film)|Como agua para chocolate]]'' (1992), ''[[Cronos (film)|Cronos]]'' (1993), ''[[Y tu mamá también]]'' (2001), and ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]'' (2006) have been successful in creating universal stories about contemporary subjects, and were internationally recognised, as in the prestigious Cannes Film Festival. Mexican directors [[Alejandro González Iñárritu]] (''[[Amores perros]]'', ''[[Babel (film)|Babel]]'', ''[[Birdman (film)|Birdman]]''), [[Alfonso Cuarón]] (''[[Children of Men]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', ''[[Gravity (film)|Gravity]]''), [[Guillermo del Toro]] (''[[Pacific Rim (film)|Pacific Rim]]''), [[Carlos Carrera]] (''[[El crimen del Padre Amaro|The Crime of Father Amaro]]''), and screenwriter [[Guillermo Arriaga]] are some of the most known present-day film makers.

===Visual arts===

Post-revolutionary art in Mexico had its expression in the works of renowned artists such as [[Frida Kahlo]], [[Diego Rivera]], [[José Clemente Orozco]], [[Rufino Tamayo]], [[Federico Cantú Garza]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]] and [[Juan O'Gorman]]. Diego Rivera, the most well-known figure of Mexican muralism, painted the [[Man at the Crossroads]] at the [[Rockefeller Center]] in New York City, a huge mural that was destroyed the next year because of the inclusion of a portrait of Russian communist leader [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rockefeller Controversy|publisher=Diego Rivera Prints|url=http://www.diego-rivera.org/rockefellercontroversy.html|accessdate=2 October 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011103154/http://www.diego-rivera.org/rockefellercontroversy.html|archivedate=11 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Rivera's murals are displayed at the Mexican [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]] and the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes|Palace of Fine Arts]].

Mexico has no official [[religion]], and the [[Constitution of 1917]] imposed limitations on the church and sometimes codified state intrusion into church matters. The government does not provide financial contributions to the church, nor does the church participate in public education. However, [[Christmas]] is a national holiday and every year during [[Easter]] and Christmas all schools in Mexico, public and private, send their students on vacation.

In 1992, Mexico lifted almost all restrictions on the religions, including granting all religious groups legal status, conceding them limited property, and lifting restrictions on the number of priests in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mexico|work=International Religious Report|year=2003|publisher=U.S. Department of State|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2003/24499.htm|accessdate=4 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until recently, priests did not have the right to vote, and even now they cannot be elected to public office.

The [[Catholic Church]] is the dominant religion in Mexico, with about 82.7% of the population as of 2010. In recent decades the number of Catholics has been declining, due to the growth of other [[Christianity|Christian]] denominations (especially various [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches and [[Mormonism]]), which now constitute 9.7% of the population, and non-Christian religions. Despite this, conversion to non-Catholic denominations has been considerably slower than in [[Religion in Guatemala|Guatemala]], [[Religion in Honduras|Honduras]], and [[Religion in El Salvador|El Salvador]]. Movements of return and revival of the indigenous [[Mesoamerican religion]]s (''[[Mexicayotl]]'', ''[[Toltecayotl]]'') have also appeared in recent decades.&lt;ref&gt;Yolotl González Torres.

In 2003 they were indicted for [[child abuse]] for, among other things, keeping the children in cage-like enclosures. The Gravelles claimed the cages were made to protect the children from each other. 

Their trial motivated legislators in Ohio to pass laws to prevent people from adopting so many children without a great deal of oversight by the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cleveland.com/gravelle/plaindealer/index.ssf?/gravelle/more/gravelle062206.html ''Taft OKs changes in adoption process'', by Barb Galbincea, [[The Plain Dealer]], 06/22/06]&lt;/ref&gt; They used parenting methods similar to those used in [[attachment therapy]], which involves very strict control of children using isolation, food deprivation, and other disciplinary measures that are widely considered to be unreasonably harsh, or even inhumane. The trial gained international attention and brought many inadequacies of the adoption services systems in Ohio to the fore.

In 2005 the Gravelles were sentenced to two years in prison for their crimes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,179491,00.html ''Judge: Caged Children Were Abused'', [[Associated Press|AP]] story on foxnews.com, 12/22/05]&lt;/ref&gt; According to newspaper reports, their therapist, Elaine Thompson, a social worker practicing as an attachment therapist, advised the Gravelles on parenting techniques. Thompson, according to these reports, had undertaken counselling or therapy, including holding therapy, with some of the Gravelle children. Elaine Thompson was indicted along with the Gravelles, but pleaded guilty to [[misdemeanor]]s in a [[plea bargain]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cleveland.com/gravelle/plaindealer/index.ssf?/gravelle/more/1172059103274560.html ''Judge rejects new trial in ‘cages’ case'', by Mark Puente, [[The Plain Dealer]], 1/30/07]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gravelles served their two-year sentences from April 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gravelles report to prison |url=http://www.morningjournal.com/articles/2009/04/06/news/erie_huron/doc49da356401613669479866.txt |work=The Morning Journal |date=2009-04-06 |quote=The Huron County Common Pleas Court ordered the couple last week to report no later than 9 a.m. to begin serving their two-year prison sentences. }}&lt;/ref&gt; to March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |format= |coauthors= |title=Michael Gravelle Is Out of Prison |url=http://www.wtam.com/cc-common/news/sections/newsarticle.html?article=8320098 |work= |publisher=[[WTAM|WTAM-AM]] |date=2011-03-21 |accessdate=2011-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Alexander Kellie''' (24 March 1947 – 18 January 2017)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://louderthanwar.com/mike-kellie-ones-spooky-tooth-drummer-rip|title=Mike Kellie (The Only Ones, Spooky Tooth drummer) RIP - Louder Than War|date=19 January 2017|work=louderthanwar.com|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an English musician, composer and record producer.

In a career that spanned more than 50 years, Kellie was a member of the [[Rock music|rock]] bands [[The V.I.P.s (band)|the V.I.P.s]], [[Spooky Tooth]] and [[the Only Ones]]. He was also a prolific [[session musician]] and worked with [[the Who]] on the film soundtrack of [[Tommy (soundtrack)|''Tommy'']], [[Joe Cocker]], [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]], [[George Harrison]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[Peter Frampton]], the [[Bee Gees]]'s [[Maurice Gibb]], [[Gary Wright]], [[Johnny Thunders]], [[Luther Grosvenor]], [[Neil Innes]], [[Steve Gibbons (musician)|Steve Gibbons]], [[Chris Jagger]], [[Nanette Workman]], [[Sean Tyla]], [[Jim Capaldi]], [[Pat Travers]] and [[Andy Fraser]].

In 2014, Kellie released his debut solo album ''Music from The Hidden'', while still a member of the Only Ones. He died on 18 January 2017 following a short illness.

==Early career==
{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}
Michael Alexander Kellie was born on 24 March 1947, in [[Birmingham]], England, into a non-musical family. As a child, he showed an early interest in rhythm, practising on a coal shuttle with hearth brushes to simulate a [[snare drum]]. In his teen years, he joined St. Michaels Youth Club band as a drummer. He later played at "The Track" at Tudor Grange Sports Centre in [[Solihull]]. On the basis of this work, he was invited by Brian "Monk" Ffinch to play with Wayne and the Beachcombers in Birmingham, which started his career as a professional musician.&lt;ref name=Mike&gt;{{citation|url=http://hostedatklick.com/feature/1600/Exclusive+interview+with+Mike+Kellie.htm|title=Exclusive interview with Mike Kellie|publisher=The Village Times|date=10 June 2013|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, Kellie played in Birmingham in a band called the Locomotive with [[Chris Wood (rock musician)|Chris Wood]] of [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]], and later with [[The V.I.P.s (band)|the V.I.P.'s]] (later Art) in [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]].

Manager [[Chris Blackwell]] found a singer and organist from the New York Times band named [[Gary Wright]], added him to the line-up of Art and launched the band Spooky Tooth with Kellie, [[Greg Ridley]], Jimmy Henshaw, [[Keith Emerson]], [[Luther Grosvenor]] and [[Mike Harrison (musician)|Mike Harrison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/1278548-VIPs-The-2|title=V.I.P.'s, The|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the initial decline of Spooky Tooth, Kellie joined [[Johnny Hallyday]]'s band for a summer tour of France in 1974, before forming [[The Only Ones]] in 1976 with [[Peter Perrett]], [[Alan Mair]] and [[John Perry (musician)|John Perry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://thebeaverdialogues.blogspot.com/2007/05/only-ones.html|title=The Only Ones|author=Perry, Kevin|date=1 May 2007|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Only Ones, possibly best known for the single "[[Another Girl, Another Planet]]", recorded three albums for [[Columbia Records|CBS]], although over time, their catalogue has contained many compilations and other releases, which now outnumber their [[studio album]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In February 1978, [[Johnny Thunders]] moved to [[London]] with his family, and began playing with a loose revue dubbed the Living Dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://punkmusiccatalogue.wordpress.com/living-dead|title=Living Dead|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kellie became part of this floating line-up (that also included Perrett along with various [[Sex Pistols]] including [[Steve Jones (musician)|Steve Jones]] and [[Paul Cook]]) and recorded Thunders’ ''[[So Alone (album)|So Alone]]'' album together with his signature song "[[You Can't Put Your Arms Around a Memory]]".

Following the Only Ones' farewell in 1981 at London's Lyceum, Kellie moved to the countryside north of [[Toronto]], Canada, where he spent four years away from performing.&lt;ref name=Mike /&gt; He used this time to learn the piano and write songs.

==Break from music and later career==
{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}
Returning to Britain in 1985, Kellie spent several years hill farming in [[North Wales]] and [[Scotland]] where he became a shepherd. In 1999 Kellie reunited with Mike Harrison, Luther Grosvenor and Greg Ridley under the Spooky Tooth moniker. Together they released the ''[[Cross Purpose]]'' album.

In 2004, Kellie reunited with Mike Harrison and Gary Wright to play dates in Germany as a new incarnation of Spooky Tooth. The band later released the DVD ''Nomad Poets'' with live performances from [[Worpswede]] and [[Hamburg]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.spookytooth.sk/nomad_poets.html|title=Nomad Poets|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the Only Ones reformed, touring the UK, Europe and Japan&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |work=Uncut|title=Peter Perrett’s Only Ones Set For Reunion Tour|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/news/peter-perrett-s-only-ones-set-for-reunion-tour-62969#2p06g2igmE5DgAJY.99|date=4 November 2011|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as performing on BBC TV's ''[[Later... with Jools Holland]]''.

In 2010, with the Only Ones undergoing another sabbatical, Kellie began recording his own collection of music which become his first solo album. Entitled ''Music from The Hidden'', the album was produced by Kellie who also played drums, organ, bass and acoustic guitars, percussion and sang lead vocals. There are also contributions from Gordon Jackson (acoustic guitar), Finley Barker and Tony Kelsey (guitars), [[Steve Winwood]] (organ, mandolin and bass), Bill Hunt, Levi French and Tony Ariss (pianos), Rob Harrison (bass) [[Steve Gibbons (musician)|Steve Gibbons]] (backing vocals) and Greg Platt Lake (guitar and vocals).&lt;ref name=Mike/&gt;

Kellie was prominent among the musicians featured on the six-CD ''Jess Roden Anthology'',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.hiddenmasters.net/uncut-magazine-reviews-jess-rodens-anthology/|work=Uncut|title=Uncut magazine reviews Jess Roden’s Anthology|accessdate=25 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207083735/http://www.hiddenmasters.net/uncut-magazine-reviews-jess-rodens-anthology/|archivedate=7 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; presented by Hidden Masters.

He contributed to the 2011 sessions for the Distractions re-union album, ''The End of the Pier'',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://recordcollectormag.com/reviews/the-end-of-the-pier|work=Record Collector|title=Distractions: End of the Pier|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was released on Occultation Records in 2012.

'''Myron John Wolf Child''' (February 6, 1983 &amp;ndash; February 27, 2007) was a youth activist, public speaker and politician from the [[Kainai Nation]] in southern [[Alberta]], [[Canada]]. His surname was sometimes reported as Wolfchild or WolfChild.

==Background==
Born in [[Cardston, Alberta]], Wolf Child identified himself as a victim of [[child abuse]] and neglect, who overcame this past to deliver a message to fellow youth. He helped establish youth groups including the Flying Eagles Youth Council, the Kainai Youth Council, the Peigan Youth Task Force, the Junior Foundation and the First Nations Liaison Project. He was founder and president of the Reclaiming Hope Foundation, and CEO of Reclaiming Hope, Inc. He was National Aboriginal Coordinator for the Students Commission of Canada, research assistant with Alberta Children's Services and with the University of Lethbridge, and a project coordinator with Kainai Children's Services. He received an Alberta Great Kids Award in 2002, and an honourable mention in 2003 for an Aboriginal Youth Achievement Award in the [[Indspire Awards|National Aboriginal Achievement Awards]], now the Indspire Awards.

By 2006, Wolf Child was a third-year native studies and [[political science]] student at the [[University of Lethbridge]], where he was elected an Arts and Sciences representative to the [[University of Lethbridge Students' Union]] in March 2006.

In proceedings of the [[Senate of Canada]] Standing Committee on Aboriginal Peoples on 21 February 2001, Senator [[Landon Pearson]] cited Wolf Child's work as a youth member of the Canadian delegation to a preliminary meeting working towards the United Nations Special Session on Children. "He was splendid. People were blown away by his capacity to speak and to present himself and to connect with other young people. We are thrilled that we have been able to give him this opportunity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/37/1/parlbus/commbus/senate/com-e/abor-e/01ev-e.htm?Language=E&amp;Parl=37&amp;Ses=1&amp;comm_id=1 |title=Aboriginal, Issue 1, Evidence |date=2001-02-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629141158/http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/SEN/Committee/371/abor/01ev-e.htm?comm_id=1&amp;Language=E&amp;Parl=37&amp;Ses=1 |archivedate=2011-06-29 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The text records his surname as WolfChild.)

==Aboriginal Peoples Party founder and independent==
In 2005, Wolf Child founded the [[Aboriginal Peoples Party of Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Young candidate prepared to tackle hurdles|work=Lethbridge Herald|date=2005-12-10|last=Shurtz|first=Delon}}&lt;/ref&gt; which since appears to have merged with the [[First Peoples National Party of Canada]].

Wolf Child ran in the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal election]] as an [[independent (politician)|independent]] candidate in the electoral district of [[Macleod (electoral district)|Macleod]] in Alberta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Macleod riding fields aboriginal independent| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/macleod-riding-fields-aboriginal-independent-1.550764 | publisher=CBC News|date=2005-12-22 |accessdate=2014-06-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140607184702/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/macleod-riding-fields-aboriginal-independent-1.550764 |archivedate=2014-06-07 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first election after the Parliament of Canada had legalized [[same-sex marriage in Canada|same-sex marriage]] across the country, he identified his support for "the traditional definition of marriage" as a priority. He also condemned [[abortion in Canada|abortion]]. "I don’t think the courts should have the final say in these decisions, it’s undemocratic," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.westernwheel.com/060118/news-electionwolfchild.htm | title= Accountability key for Wolf Child|accessdate=2007-02-06|publisher=Western Wheel|date=2006-01-18|last=Nadon|first=Laurel |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061114051544/http://www.westernwheel.com/060118/news-electionwolfchild.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other priorities he identified included supporting farmers, veterans, and single mothers. He said he supported child care, opposed tax increases and supported public spending control. He also supported a "patient's bill of rights" for health care users, and proposed a national [[aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] peace keepers' group to confront violence in native communities.

He received 1,055 votes, 2.12% of ballots cast. In a celebratory message to his website, he congratulated the winner, [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] [[Ted Menzies]], and their fellow candidates, and called his campaign a victory rather than a loss. "I will be there next time, but it won’t be as an independent," he wrote. "To tell you the truth, I was hoping to get at least 1,000 votes and I did."

==Post-election comments==
Wolf Child posted a farewell to [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] leader [[Paul Martin]] on his loss in that election. He wrote that he had supported Martin up to and through the [[Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, 2003|2003 leadership race]], but that Martin had alienated faithful Liberals like [[Herb Dhaliwal]], [[Allan Rock]], [[John Manley (politician)|John Manley]], [[Sheila Copps]], "and even poor little [Don] [[Don Boudria|Boudria]]." "[D]on't push people around as you'll need them later on," he warned Martin. He ended the message more cheerfully: "Vive le Canada. Stay Cool and Have an awesome time."

Writing as acting leader of the APPC, he congratulated Conservative [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] on his appointment of [[Jim Prentice]] as [[Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (Canada)|Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development]], appreciating that Prentice had committed to the [[Kelowna Accord|Kelowna Agreement]] and to the [[Canadian residential school system|residential school]] compensation package.

==Liberal leadership aspirant==
Wolf Child's prospective candidacy in the [[Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, 2006|2006 Liberal Party of Canada leadership race]] was reported by the ''[[Lethbridge Herald]]'' on 15 February 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Big leadership aspirations|publisher=Lethbridge Herald|date=2006-02-15|last=Schurtz|first=Delon}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I'd like to see the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] rejuvenated," he said. "I hope I can inspire and bring faith to Canadians to vote Liberal again."

In a 2 March 2006 comment to a post on his candidacy on the blog ''Our Thoughts'', a poster identifying themselves as Wolf Child (including using his email address and website URL) wrote that "[due] to personal commitments and my education, I am hereby dropping my name from the list."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  |archivedate = 2008-05-14
  |deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ''Lethbridge Herald'' article dated 1 April 2006, he again expressed his interest in running, saying that he expected to know whether he could raise the $50,000 and the signatures required to register within 45 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Raising $50,000 for leadership the real challenge|publisher=Lethbridge Herald|date=2006-04-01|last=Schurtz|first=Delon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He told the ''Herald'' he hoped to win support, especially from aboriginal organizations, and to make [[First Nations]] issues prominent in his campaign, but to speak to all Canadians as well. “I’m a people’s candidate," he said, "I want to address a lot of the social issues we have.”

Under the username nextprimeminister, a poster identifying themselves as Wolf Child posted to [[Ashley MacIsaac]]'s Internet forum, congratulating MacIsaac on his reported candidacy in the same leadership race, and inviting MacIsaac to an official summit. Although opposed to same sex marriage, Wolf Child congratulated MacIsaac on his engagement to marry a man, and in another message wrote of his increased knowledge of and respect for the roles of [[Two-Spirit|two-spirited]] individuals in native spirituality and history, in spite of his often-repeated hatred of same-sex marriage.

==Other activities==
Towards the end of his life, Wolf Child's projects included Chairmanship of Reclaiming Hope Inc. and its sister foundation The Reclaiming Hope Foundation. He was also the president of the Kainai Youth Government, Southern Alberta Representative for the Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Youth Advisory Committee, and Director-General of the Aboriginal Peace Keeper's Forces of Canada and Goodwill Representative for the National Aboriginal Youth Suicide Prevention Program, and was named Co-Chairperson of the Aboriginal Project for Suicide Prevention alongside prominent Aboriginal leaders.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Criminal charges==

The ''Lethbridge Herald'' reported in August 2006 that [[Lethbridge Police Service|regional police]] had charged Wolf Child with two counts of [[sexual assault]], stemming from the claim that he performed oral sex on a man and fondled the genitals of another at a house party in April 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | &lt;!-- url=http://www.lethbridgeherald.com/article_3763.php --&gt; | title=Political hopeful faces sex charges|publisher=Lethbridge Herald|date=2006-08-15|last=Harding|first=Kristen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guilty"&gt;{{cite news | &lt;!-- url=http://www.lethbridgeherald.com/article_5819.php --&gt; | title=Political hopeful pleads guilty to sex assault|publisher=Lethbridge Herald|date=2007-02-06|last=Harding|first=Kristen|page=A3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolf Child entered a not guilty plea in court 23 October 2006. Wolf Child plead guilty to the charges during the start of his trial on 5 February 2007.&lt;ref name="guilty" /&gt; A sentencing hearing was scheduled for 27 March.

==Death==
After a long struggle, Myron Wolf Child committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.tgmag.ca/focus3/Kainai.pdf | title= The Kainai Story | publisher= The Students Commission | date= 2010 | accessdate= 2015-07-13 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131126054545/http://www.tgmag.ca/focus3/kainai.pdf | archivedate= 26 November 2013 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Lethbridge Herald'' ran an obituary which stated he died on 27 February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.lethbridgeherald.com/article_6128.php | title=Myron Wolf Child obituary|publisher=Lethbridge Herald|date=2007-03-03|accessdate=2007-03-03|page=D1 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928064847/http://www.lethbridgeherald.com/article_6128.php |archivedate = September 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nathaniel Lucas''' (1764&amp;ndash;1818) was a [[convict]] transported to [[Australia]] on the [[First Fleet]]. His occupation was listed as [[carpentry|carpenter]].

==Life==
Lucas was born in [[Leatherhead]], [[Surrey]], [[England]], to parents John Lucas &amp; Mary Bradford in 1764.&lt;ref name=Lee_Genealogy&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.leehistory.net/genealogy/getperson.php?personID=I00390&amp;tree=lee |title=Lee Genealogy Pages |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080727123622/http://www.leehistory.net/genealogy/getperson.php?personID=I00390&amp;tree=lee |archivedate=27 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas was tried at the [[Old Bailey]], [[London]] on 7 July 1784 for feloniously stealing clothing with a value of 40 [[shillings]]. Lucas was sentenced to [[penal transportation|transportation]] for seven years and left [[England]] on the [[Scarborough (1782 ship)|''Scarborough'']] in May 1787.

==Norfolk Island==
After the First Fleet arrived at Port Jackson in January 1788, [[Arthur Phillip|Phillip]] ordered [[Lieutenant]] [[Philip Gidley King]] to lead a party of fifteen convicts (9 men and 6 women) and seven free men to take control of [[Norfolk Island]] and prepare for its commercial development. Lucas was aboard the [[HMS Supply (1759)|HMS Supply]], which arrived at Norfolk on 6 March 1788.&lt;ref name=ADB&gt;{{Cite AuDB | id2=lucas-nathaniel-2380 &lt;!-- A020123b --&gt; | last=Herman | first=Morton | title=Lucas Nathaniel (1764 - 1818) | volume=2 | year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On board the ''Supply'' Nathaniel met Olivia Gascoigne (''b. 1763 - d. 12 Jun 1830'') whom he married on 5 November 1791, on Norfolk Island. Nathaniel and Olivia had thirteen children, although twins (Sarah and Mary) were killed at the age of two years when a large Norfolk Island Pine fell on the Lucas house.&lt;ref name=Lee_Genealogy/&gt;

In 1791 he received a grant of fifteen acres (6 ha) and in 1793 purchased another sixty acres (24 ha) from Charles Heritage, a former marine. Lucas took up farming and in August 1802 sold [[wheat]], [[maize]] and [[pork]] worth £450 to the government stores on the island.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;

On 22 May, 1802, Lucas was appointed Master Carpenter at Norfolk Island.&lt;ref name=CSI&gt;{{Cite web | website=State Records of New South Wales | series=Colonial Secretary Index, 1788-1825 | url=http://www.records.nsw.gov.au/indexes/colsec/l/F34c_lo-ly-11.htm#P4654_170703 | title=LUCAS, Nathaniel.

==New South Wales==
In April 1805, Lucas returned with his family to [[Sydney]] in the [[HMS Investigator (1801)|Investigator]]. The ship carried materials for a government windmill which Lucas was to erect in Sydney, and he was allowed to carry materials for another windmill for himself.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt; Nathaniel also brought several pairs of capital mill stones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article626674 |title=SYDNEY. |newspaper=[[Sydney Gazette|The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser]] |volume=III |issue=107 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=17 March 1805 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser. Dated 23 June 1805.'''&lt;br/&gt;
An excellent Post Mill, the first that has been erected in the settlement is now completed by Mr Nathaniel Lucas, behind Back Row East. It was undertaken and finished within the space of six weeks; has been for several weeks at work, is capable of grinding, with a sufficiency of wind, upwards of six bushels per hour, which was last week accomplished for 12 hours successively.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article626831 |title=SYDNEY |newspaper=[[Sydney Gazette|The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser]] |volume=III |issue=121 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=23 June 1805 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1808, Nathaniel was appointed superintendent of carpenters in Sydney&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt; and held this position until his retirement in December 1814.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article629029 |title=Classified Advertising |newspaper=[[Sydney Gazette|The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser]] |volume=TWELFTH |issue=578 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=31 December 1814 |page=1 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

3 Jan 1810 Nathaniel was noted to be on the list of persons holding civil and military employment at Sydney and settlements adjacent, as Superintendent of Carpenters.&lt;ref name=CSI/&gt;

From 1810 until his death, Nathaniel appears on numerous [[Chief Secretary (British Empire)|Colonial Secretary's]] documents. The majority of these documents refer to Nathaniel surveying land or property and constructing or repairing various structures.&lt;ref name=CSI/&gt;

1812, saw the completion of a Post Windmill behind the [[Dawes Point Battery|Battery at Dawes Point]]. The price of grinding wheat into flour was fifteen pence per bushel, if brought and taken away by the owners of the wheat, or eighteen pence per bushel if brought and taken away by the owners of the Mill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article628574 |title=Classified Advertising |newspaper=[[Sydney Gazette|The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser]] |volume=TENTH |issue=465 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=21 November 1812 |page=1 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the construction of the [[St Luke's Anglican Church, Liverpool|St Luke's Church]] {{NSWcity|Liverpool}} in 1818, which was designed by [[Francis Greenway]], Greenway alleged that Lucas was much addicted to the bottle and that he was using very poor stone at the church.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;

==Death==
After some days of being noticed absent, his body was discovered on the bank of a local river. It was determined he had been there about six days.&lt;ref name=death /&gt;

February 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Gaga, interested in the concept of [[Reincarnation|rebirth]], sent Formichetti a picture of a [[human embryo]], and he was first inspired to create, as he told her, "egg [shaped] shoes—like you were born that way, with eggs as feet."&lt;ref name=LordGaga/&gt; She took the idea further, resulting in the egg or "vessel" (designed by Chalayan) in which she was carried down the red carpet and later onto the stage, hatching out in a yolk-coloured latex outfit to perform her new single "Born This Way".&lt;ref name=LordGaga/&gt; She was wearing, as he [[Twitter|tweeted]], "Mugler by Nicola Formichetti."&lt;ref name=Grammys2011CBS/&gt; A "Born This Way"-associated shoot called "Alien Excess" done in January by photographer [[Mariano Vivanco]] for the Spring 2011 (March) issue of ''i-D'' features Gaga in a latex coat from the new Mugler menswear collection, with Formichetti responsible for the styling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.i-donline.com/i-spy/exhibitionist-issue-lady-gaga Alien Excess] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110326185614/http://www.i-donline.com/i-spy/exhibitionist-issue-lady-gaga |date=2011-03-26 }}, in ''[[i-D]]'', Issue 312 – Spring 2011.

====2012====
On October 23, 2012 in a ''[[The Huffington Post|Huffington Post]]'' [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joseph-sutton/lope-navo-fashion-photographer_b_1998328.html interview], Formichetti was mentioned by fashion photographer [[Lope Navo]]: "I bumped into then-stylist Nicola Formicetti in B Bar in NYC randomly and he told me he saw the first cover I shot in Milan for ''Rodeo'' magazine of Seijo Imazaki. He said he loved it and we have been in touch ever since. He gave me so much advice about my work." &lt;ref name=HuffPostInterview&gt;{{cite web|title=Lope Navo Huffington Post Interview|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joseph-sutton/lope-navo-fashion-photographer_b_1998328.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mugler===
After months of rumours, in September 2010 Formichetti was announced as the new creative director for the Parisian fashion house founded by the celebrated designer [[Thierry Mugler]] (who has largely retired from the business), which he has renamed Mugler. He has said that it was in fact Lady Gaga who persuaded him to go for the job, when they were looking through pieces from the Mugler archive when shooting the video for "Telephone".&lt;ref name=Horyn032311&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/24/fashion/24NICOLA.html At Mugler, Genius and Its Limits], [[Cathy Horyn]] (''[[The New York Times]]''). March 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; At Mugler Formichetti oversees designers Sébastien Peigné for womenswear and [[Romain Kremer]] for menswear.&lt;ref name=Vogue091310&gt;[http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/daily/100913-nicola-formichetti-for-thierry-mugl.aspx Formichetti For Mugler], Ella Alexander (''[[Vogue (British magazine)|Vogue]]''). September 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Joël Palix, director general of the company, said "We were looking for a young talent who could really bring energy to the brand ... Nicola is a multicultural, techno-savvy expert involved in fashion, communication, image and entertainment. He and the appointed talented designers will represent a new direction for French fashion. Nicola Formichetti leaves MUGLER on April 2, 2013. "&lt;ref name=Vogue091310/&gt;
For the occasion, he also asked the k-pop artist [[G-Dragon]] to compose a theme for the fashion runway, entitled "I am Mugler".

====Menswear====
The menswear, a collaboration with Romain Kremer, of Formichetti's debut (Fall/Winter) collection "Anatomy of Change" premiered during the Men's [[Paris fashion week]] on 19 January 2011.&lt;ref name=VMAN&gt;[http://www.vman.com/blog/mugler-by-nicola-formichetti/ Mugler by Nicola Formichetti], [[Derek Blasberg]] (''[[VMAN]]'').

January 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This was accompanied by a video shot by [[Mariano Vivanco]], featuring Formichetti's new muse, the full-body tattooed Canadian model [[Rick Genest]],&lt;ref name=SHOWmuglermens&gt;[http://showstudio.com/collection/mugler_paris_menswear_a_w_11 Mugler @ Paris Menswear A/W 11], Alex Fury ([[SHOWstudio.com]]). January 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and by a remix by Lady Gaga, as musical director for the menswear project,&lt;ref name=LATimesMens&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/alltherage/2011/01/paris-fashion-week-thierry-mugler-aw-2011-menswear.html Paris Fashion Week: Mugler menswear is reborn, and Lady Gaga is the midwife], Adam Tschorn (''[[Los Angeles Times]]'').

January 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The clothes, worn by Rico Genest and other models on the runway, recall those by Mugler himself from earlier decades, in such ways as the use of the colours navy blue and bright orange,&lt;ref name=LATimesMens/&gt; or "hyper-modern"-style jackets lacking [[jacket lapel|lapels]].&lt;ref name=SHOWmuglermens/&gt; The collection also features some not-so-conventional latex pieces such as biker jackets, gloves, and even latex trousers.&lt;ref name=SHOWmuglermens/&gt;&lt;ref name=LATimesMens/&gt; On the overall vision, [[Cathy Horyn]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' describes Formichetti creating a "mechanical man" in the tradition of Mugler's fantastical woman,&lt;ref name=HorynMuglerMan&gt;[http://runway.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/19/rethinking-the-mugler-man/ Rethinking the Mugler Man], [[Cathy Horyn]], (''[[The New York Times]]''). January 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; yet Adam Tschorn of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' found plenty of the pieces surprisingly wearable.&lt;ref name=LATimesMens/&gt; Formichetti himself says on the collection "I want to say something that has the past and the future, but what is really important to me is the present."&lt;ref name=VMAN/&gt; Returning to Rico Genest, it was his discovery by Formichetti and then Gaga's urging which actually resulted in the menswear show, something not originally planned.&lt;ref name=HintMag032011&gt;[http://www.hintmag.com/post/the-true-story-of-how-nicola-formichetti-got-rick-genest-the-guy-with-a-scalp-tattoo-to-model-in-mugler--march-20-2011 The Incredible But True Story of How Nicola Formichetti Got Rick Genest to Model in Mugler], Interview by Lee Carter (''Hint Fashion Magazine''). March 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Genest's discovery also influenced the collection itself.&lt;ref name=HintMag032011/&gt; The show was streamed live from Paris on the Internet.

Genest can be seen styled in Mugler by Formichetti and shot by Mariano Vivanco in the sixth volume of ''Vogue Hommes Japan'', the editorial being titled "Hard To Be Passive".&lt;ref&gt;"Hard To Be Passive", ''[http://hommes.vogue.co.jp/vol06/ Vogue Hommes Japan VOL. 6] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120708220822/http://hommes.vogue.co.jp/vol06/ |date=2012-07-08 }}'', Photography by [[Mariano Vivanco]] and fashion by Nicola Formichetti. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gradientmagazine.com/fashion/vogue-hommes-japan-6-rick-genest-modeling-a-mugler-special-for-formichetti-with-photos-by-mariano-vivanco/ Vogue Hommes Japan #6 – Rick Genest Modeling a Mugler Special for Formichetti with photos by Mariano Vivanco], ''Gradient Magazine''. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Spring/Summer 2011 issue of ''[[GQ Style]]'' (UK) Formichetti is interviewed on the future of the brand, with Genest (also interviewed) shot in Mugler by Karim Sadli for the editorial.&lt;ref name=GQStyleSS11&gt;[http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/style/articles/2011-03/16/gq-style-nicola-formichetti-styles-rick-genest- GQ Style presents Nicola Formichetti] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319111253/http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/style/articles/2011-03/16/gq-style-nicola-formichetti-styles-rick-genest- |date=2011-03-19 }}, Andy Morris (''[[GQ Style]]''). March 15, 2011. Interview (inaccessible) by Sarah Hay.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Womenswear====
On March 2 the womenswear, a collaboration with Sébastien Peigné, premiered. Lady Gaga was again musical director, previewing the track "Government Hooker" from her upcoming album as well as including the already released title track "Born This Way" in the soundtrack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1659071/lady-gaga-government-hooker-mugler.jhtml Lady Gaga's 'Government Hooker' Makes Fashion-Show Debut], Jocelyn Vena ([[MTV]]). March 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; But this time she actually performed on the runway in person for Formichetti's show, modelling pieces from his collection, called "Anatomy of Change Femme—Mode Sans Frontiers."&lt;ref name=FashionistaWomens&gt;[http://fashionista.com/2011/03/mugler-fall-2011-lady-gaga-bought-the-whole-collection/ Mugler Fall 2011: Lady Gaga Bought the Whole Collection], Leah Chernikoff (Fashionista.com). March 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, Rick Genest from the menswear collection made a reappearance on the runway among the models.&lt;ref name=CutOdell&gt;[http://nymag.com/daily/fashion/2011/03/mugler_highlights_gaga_the_pig.html Mugler Highlights: Gaga, Gaga's Pigtails, Precarious Footwear, and More Gaga], Amy Odell (''The Cut'' / ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''). March 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction of critics to the clothes was generally similar to their reaction to the menswear two months previously. Formichetti offers a silhouette in the Mugler tradition,&lt;ref name=SHOWMugler0303&gt;[http://showstudio.com/collection/mugler_paris_womenswear_a_w_11 Mugler @ Paris Womenswear A/W 11], Alex Fury ([[SHOWstudio.com]]).

March 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and with sculptured shoulders (for the appropriate pieces),&lt;ref name=Nightclub&gt;[http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/03/paris-report-runway-as-nightclub-at-mugler-and-pugh/ Paris Report | Runway as Nightclub at Mugler and Pugh], Jacob Brown (''[[The New York Times]]''). March 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Alex Fury of [[SHOWstudio.com]] describing them as "architectonic".&lt;ref name=SHOWMugler0303/&gt; For the show Formichetti employed [http://www.reinvollenga.com/ Rein Vollenga] to contribute sculptural elements to the silhouette, Atsuko Kudo skin-like items of torn-up latex,&lt;ref name=SHOWMugler0303/&gt; and Franc Fernandez for Gaga's two hats. She herself gave input for the collection, associated with her ''Born This Way'' projects and performances, but is not financially involved with Formichetti's MUGLER.&lt;ref name=Horyn032311/&gt; As he says, "It's just friends helping each other... I think when you start talking about money, it stops the whole creative process for me."&lt;ref name=Horyn032311/&gt;

Although there was worry it might, Gaga's appearance did not prevent Formichetti's audience from noticing the clothes,&lt;ref name=Grazia0303&gt;[http://www.graziadaily.co.uk/fashion/archive/2011/03/03/lady-gaga-modelling-at-the-mugler-show.htm Lady Gaga modelling at the Mugler show], Naomi Attwood (''[[Grazia]]''). March 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; variously described as "shiny and sexy",&lt;ref name=Nightclub/&gt; and "taut and futuristic",&lt;ref name=Guardian0303&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/mar/02/galliano-paris-fashion-week Paris fashion week turns to Lady Gaga – and a quiet Belgian], Imogen Fox (''[[The Guardian]]'').

March 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He chose to go mainly with the colours black, white, electric/royal blue, and beige.&lt;ref name=HorynMugler0302/&gt;&lt;ref name=InterviewMag030311&gt;[http://www.interviewmagazine.com/blogs/fashion/2011-03-03/paris-fall-2011-mugler-gaga-carven-gareth-pugh/ Lady Gaga Loves Mugler, Carven's Library Cocktails, and Pugh in the Flesh], Rebecca Voight (''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'').

March 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[nave]] and its flanking aisles, through which the models, Genest and finally Gaga strutted. While it was found by critics among Formichetti's audience who were physically present at the show that both the architecture and lighting made it difficult to properly see the collection,&lt;ref name=SHOWMugler0303/&gt;&lt;ref name=HorynMugler0302/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/alltherage/2011/03/paris-fashion-week-at-mugler-lady-gaga-steals-the-show.html Paris Fashion Week: At Mugler, Lady Gaga steals the show], Booth More (''[[Los Angeles Times]]''). March 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; the performance was as much or more for the millions around the world watching it streamed live on the Internet, like the menswear collection, but this time on the brand's [[Facebook]] page,&lt;ref name=MuglerFacebook&gt;[http://www.facebook.com/ThierryMugler facebook.com/ThierryMugler]&lt;/ref&gt; and featuring 45 minutes live behind-the-scenes preshow.&lt;ref name=WWDInterviewApril2011&gt;[http://www.wwd.com/media-news/muglers-digital-world-3573118/ Mugler's Digital World], Interview by Rachel Strugatz (''[[Women's Wear Daily]]''). April 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact he believes the future of the brand is a digital one, Formichetti saying "I design digitally, I communicate digitally, and I live digitally, and I wanted to incorporate that into the brand."&lt;ref name=WWDInterviewApril2011/&gt; For him Gaga's performance fits in the "new Mugler world", a "fantasy world" fusion of high fashion and pop with an existence both real and digital.&lt;ref name=WWDInterviewApril2011/&gt; The performance continued with her wearing a [[leopard print]] see-through [[catsuit]] from his collection out on a Paris street and into the celebrated restaurant [[Maxim's Paris|Maxim's]] for the afterparty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1362479/Lady-Gaga-leopard-print-catsuit-Paris-restaurant-Maxims.html What dress code?

===Nicopanda===
Nicola, along with his brother Andrea Formichetti, created the Nicopanda line based on the panda cartoon that looks like Nicola. The story behind the name, accordingly to Nicola, "my friends used to call me Nico Panda because I’m half Asian, I had this long beard back then; and was a little chubby, so I looked like a bear—an Asian bear. So people started calling me Nico Panda" &lt;ref&gt;[http://elleiconlee.com/2012/05/01/interview-with-the-pandaman-nicola-formichetti-in-his-hong-kong-pop-up-store-about-nicopanda-lady-gaga-social-media-专访lady-gaga造型师，时/], "Interview with Nicola Formichetti in Hong Kong". May 1, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nicola's New York====
The nicopanda line was first introduced in September 2011 at Nicola's pop up shop in New York's Tribeca district. Along with the Gage/Clemenceau Architects, the space at 50 walker street was transformed into a mirrored prism that housed vintage Versace, MUGLER, Uniqlo, Nicopanda products like the zombiepanda rings, iPhone and iPad skins in collaboration with Gizmobies, and looks by the Haus of Gaga. Nicola worried that people wouldn't show up to the store,
{{quote|Formichetti is worried, albeit irrationally, that no one will show up to shop. 'I hope people come,' he says. 'Tell your friends.'As encouragement, he’ll be helping out on the floor for the two weeks the pop-up is in operation and has made sure to include affordable trinkets among the mix of higher priced vintage floral Versace and fall pieces from Thierry Mugler.}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vogue.com/vogue-daily/article/thierry-mugler-pop-up-shop/#1 Vogue Nicola's Pop Up Shop], "Nicola Formichetti's Pop-Up Shop".&lt;/ref&gt;
While the pop-up was happening, Nicola made a competition for his fans on Twitter, where the winners were invited to the pop-up for a breakfast with Nicola and a preview of the new Uniqlo line he worked on, the Innovation Project. Fans drove from Ohio and flew in from Phoenix for this chance.

==== Nicopanda Lane Crawford ====
In May 2012, Nicola opened Nicopanda pop up stores at Lane Crawford in Beijing and Hong Kong.

====Nicopanda Tokyo====
After opening up pop-up stores in Hong Kong and Beijing, Nicola opened up more pop-ups in Tokyo in June 2012. There were pop-ups in LHP in the Harajuku district, in Opening Ceremony in the SHibuya district, and also a pop-up shop and gallery at the Isetan Shinjuku department store.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tokyofashion.com/nicopanda-popup-shop-tokyo-hirari-ikeda-nicola-formichetti/ NICOPANDA Popup Gallery Isetan], "NICOPANDA Popup Tokyo".&lt;/ref&gt; It was in this pop-up gallery that the Amebapanda chetti design was first presented, along with the Nicopanda X Hello Kitty collaboration.

===Villa Effe===
In August 2012, Nicola and his brother Andrea opened up a "super complex" in Nicola's hometown of [[Numazu]], Shizuoka, Japan. Villa Effe holds a wedding hall, a restaurant, a beauty salon and a shopping hall that includes displays of Haus of Gaga looks and the Nicopanda line.

===''Vogue Hommes Japan''===
Formichetti was fashion editor for ''[[Men's Vogue|Vogue Hommes Japan]]'' from its inception until fall 2012, when the magazine was folded and repackaged into ''[[GQ|GQ Style]]''.

===Uniqlo===
As of January 2013, Formichetti remains as fashion director for [[Uniqlo]].

===MAC===
In addition to his collaboration with Lady Gaga for the [[Make-up Art Cosmetics|MAC]] Viva Glam campaign, Formichetti has styled [[Irina Lăzăreanu]], shot by Miles Aldridge and co-styled by Dillon Turman, for MAC's ''Quite Cute'' collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vainstyle.com/?p=19305 MAC's Quite Cute Collection], ''Vain Style''. April 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy and influence==
In the fifth volume of ''[[Men's Vogue|Vogue Hommes Japan]]'', Lady Gaga had the following to say about what she and Formichetti desire for the future of fashion:&lt;ref name=GagaVogueHommesJapanFurniss2010&gt;"At Work With Lady Gaga", ''[http://hommes.vogue.co.jp/vol05/ Vogue Hommes Japan VOL. 5] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20101029143845/http%3A//hommes.vogue.co.jp/vol05/ |date=2010-10-29 }}'', Interview by Jo-Ann Furniss. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Nicola and I always joke around saying we want to make these tee shirts that say "fuck fashion" on them because we love fashion so much but in another way we want to explode it, ruin it and recreate it, then ruin it again and recreate it because I don't want any status attached to fashion. I don't want any pretence attached to it because I want it to be something that my fans, and Nicola wants it to be something for his fans, something that everyone could have. Beautiful, tangible and something from the inside.}}
[[File:NicolaFormichettispopupshop01.jpg|thumb|Inside Formichetti's pop-up shop, [[Tribeca]], NYC, September 16, 2011]]
Formichetti has repeatedly declared he is "not an elitist" in fashion, instead wanting to share what he does with everyone,&lt;ref name=ViceMag/&gt;&lt;ref name=GQStyleSS11/&gt;&lt;ref name=WWDInterviewApril2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=NewsweekArmani020611&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/2011/02/06/armani-goes-gaga.html Armani Goes Gaga], [[Robin Givhan]] (''[[Newsweek]]'').

{{quote|With the best styling in the world, a shit image is still shit. I love being in control of the whole thing—the design, the styling, the photography, and then getting it into a magazine and the marketing and trend forecasting.}}

His influence is varied. Before his Mugler collections premiered he was ranked the most influential stylist in the world (even if he dislikes the term), in no small part because of the enormous volume of his fashion magazine work, including making ''Vogue Hommes Japan'' "the most powerful Japanese-language publication in the global fashion industry", and because of his consulting for a number of fashion houses and other brands.&lt;ref name=BoF50/&gt; It is with and through Lady Gaga as her fashion director, however, that Formichetti's influence on culture is greatest.&lt;ref name=BoF50/&gt; Previously the role and influence of stylists was more limited, and while others have become designers, he is the first to take control of a major fashion house, interpreted as the most prominent example of a stylist becoming a [[power broker (term)|power broker]] within the industry.&lt;ref name=Guardian011511&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/jan/15/fashion-stylists-milan-fashion-week Fashion stylist to the fore as menswear shows begin in Milan], Imogen Fox (''[[The Guardian]]''). January 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Formichetti's eclectic selection for the [[avant-garde]] Gaga of pieces from designers ranging vastly from the great, such as [[Giorgio Armani]], to the obscure, has influenced what has been described as a "cultural phenomenon" of imitation, extending even into "provincial backwaters".&lt;ref name=BoF50/&gt;

He frequently meets and is hopeful for many younger talents who are interested in fashion today.&lt;ref name=WWDInterviewApril2011/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12733">'''I Nyoman Masriadi''' (born 1973) is a painter and a leading artist of the post-Suharto era in Indonesia. His works have gained a collectors base which includes prominent collectors in and around the region.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=al0KnMb3Vgu4&amp;refer=muse Indonesia Artist Masriadi Slays Ogres, Cuts Batman Down to Size, August 2008, Bloomberg, Retrieved January 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Masriadi was born 1973, in [[Gianyar]], [[Bali]]. Masriadi received his training in art at the [[Indonesian Institute of the Arts, Yogyakarta]] (ISI).

===Work===
In Bali, where he was born, there were two traditions of painting - a sacred one and one of words for a Western audience - but his relationship to these is indirect. Masriadi received his training in art at the Institute Seni Indonesia (ISI) Yogyakarta. From the time he was an art student, he had already been recognized by peers as one of the very first contemporary Balinese artists who eased himself away from an encompassing concern with Balinese life, culture and traditions in his works. He is reputed to have stood in front of the canvas on a cardboard box to restrict himself from any distractions and fidgety behavior; to learn the skill of painting.

The visual imagery and narratives in his paintings are derived from keen and intelligent observations of social life and behavioural traits. His visual vocabulary is striking, continuously refreshing and contemporaneously relevant. Early works show him sparring with Western modernism in the guise of cubism but meshing it with caricature, the language of street advertising and graffiti. The way he has overdrawn his finished paintings with a marker can best be seen as a means of inscribing himself in or against that tradition.

"Masriadi: Black Is My Last Weapon" was the artist's maiden solo show at the Singapore Art Museum which was co organised by [[Gajah Gallery]] in 2008. The exhibit spanned Masriadi's 10-year career and explored the evolution of his signature black-skinned figures, a motif now widely copied by other Indonesian painters.

Masriadi's works are marked by consistent high quality — thoughtful in the messages that transmit from scenes and figures in his pictorial world, and painstakingly detailed in execution and finish. These qualities have led him to receive positive reception from the art collecting world at large. He is Southeast Asia's most well-received contemporary artist at auctions;{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} the appreciation of his works is a testimony to his forte and talent as a painter as well as a barometer of the ascendency of Southeast Asian contemporary art.

===Awards &amp; accolades===
He was awarded the prize for Best Painting at the Dies Natalis ISI Yogyakarta in 1997. He has participated in group exhibitions in [[Australia]] and the [[Netherlands]], and in [[Indonesia]]: In Bali,Singapore,Jakarta, Mungkid (Mageland), Solo, Surabaya and Yogyakarta.&lt;ref&gt;Singapore Art Museum, 'Black is my Last Weapon exhibition Catalogue, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Masriadi is one of Southeast Asia's most well-received contemporary artists at auction.&lt;ref&gt;* https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;refer=home&amp;sid=a2DQSqwt2YIo, Masriadi Breaks Post-Lehman Stupor at Hong Kong Art Auction, October 2008, Bloomberg, Retrieved January 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable works==

===The Man From Bantul (The Final Round)===

Sotheby's (Hong Kong): Final Price HK$7,82 million, or US$1,000,725.
The sale of this work, a triptych conveying the resolve of the human spirit, marked a record for a contemporary Southeast Asian art piece at auction. It sold for about five times its estimated price.&lt;ref&gt;http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/BID/404267219x0x238915/ee256844-9a9a-4929-9649-c6dca80b44ed/238915.pdf, Source: (Singapore), Press Release, April 2008, Retrieved January 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a3F0hIuhlGYw Indonesia's Masriadi Leads Singapore Art Rebound as Prices Soar, October 2009, Bloomberg, Retrieved January 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attack from Website===
This painstakingly rendered commentary on the art world and art practices of the 21st century sold for US$935,844 at Christie's Hong Kong as a lot in their Asian 20th Century and Contemporary Art (Evening Sale) on May 25, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/i-nyoman-masriadi-masriadi-presents-attack-5689663-details.aspx?pos=41&amp;intObjectID=5689663&amp;sid=&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fatman===

At Christie's first auction in Shanghai, Masriadi's mixed-media piece ''Fatman,'' was sold for US$757,547, the highest price ever paid for a similar sized work of the artist.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.luxury-insider.com/luxury-news/2013/10/christies-inaugural-shanghai-auction-sets-records&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jago Kandang (Home Champion)===

Sotheby's (Singapore): Final Price US$370,668.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Placed into the social and political context of Masriadi's home country of Indonesia, it however simultaneously conveys a deeper story as he captures both the spirit and psyche of today's society. The emotions that are demonstrated by the football fans in the background–on the far right, anger; elsewhere, cheering supporters waving the national flag and banners carrying the words "Indonesia"–are indicative of Masriadi's cultural sensitivity and sharp humour.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'Jago Kandang' is ranked No.1 in Sotheby's Top Ten Contemporary Southeast Asian Paintings according to C-Arts Asian Contemporary Arts and Culture Magazine, Vol.03 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/BID/269917403x0x166346/b5ae540e-838f-4fae-8f58-72e41e8f4c0f/166346.pdf|Sotheby's (Singapore), Press Release, April 2008, Retrieved January 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jangan Tanya Saya Tanya Presiden (Don't Ask Me, Ask The President)===

&lt;blockquote&gt;One painting by Indonesian artist Nyoman Masriadi was expected to sell for up to $25,000 (in 2007). In the end, a Southeast Asian collector paid SGD$360,000 (HK$1,854,000) for it, setting a world record price for a Masriadi painting.&lt;ref&gt;http://asia.news.yahoo.com/070917/5/singapore300241.html|Channel News Asia, Monday September 17, 2007, Retrieved January 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite Masriadi's contribution to and influence on Indonesian art there has not been, until this book, much written discussion of his work. This is long overdue. Nyoman Masriadi- Reconfiguring the Body brings a much needed intellectual discourse to Masriadi's work. That it has come together with such clarity and depth of expression can be attributed to two years of hard work by the author-editor, T.K.Sabapathy. His efforts to access first hand photos, articles and various bits of information have resulted in a thorough consideration of the evolution of Masriadi's art practice. Goenawan Mohamad uncovers the local complexities and richness of contemporary Indonesian society and experience. No writer is better able to lend such elegance to that most difficult of tasks - unlocking the culture, language and voice of artists in Indonesia.

===Masriadi: Black Is My Last Weapon===

[[Singapore Art Museum]] presented Masriadi: Black is My Last Weapon in collaboration with [[Gajah Gallery]] which featured over 30 works completed in the past decade. It was published on the occasion of the Masriadi: Black is My Last Weapon exhibition from 22 August to 9 November 2008. Presented by curators Seng Yu Jin and Wang Zineng in four thematic sections, with each theme serving as a weapon, in the sense of an apparatus for engagement, to the interior world of the artist.

===Group exhibition postcard set===

A set of 15 postcards were designed as a commemorative piece for Gajah Gallery's 15th year anniversary celebration. The set is a compilation of work by Ahmad Zakii Anwar, J. Ariadhitya Pramuhendra, Jumaldi Alfi, M.

'''Oski''' or '''Oski the Bear''' (named after the [[Oski Yell]]) is the official [[mascot]] of the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Oski’s name, design and character were developed by William “Rocky” Rockwell, who was the first student to play the role, and former Daily Cal editor Warrington Colescott. Oski made his debut during the September 27, 1941 football season-opener against [[Saint Mary's College of California|St. Mary's College]] and has been the university’s official mascot ever since.&lt;ref name=UCB2016&gt;{{cite news |title=Birthday Bear: Iconic Oski turns 75 |first=Gretchen |last=Kell |date=September 26, 2016 |work=UC Berkeley|url=http://news.berkeley.edu/2016/09/26/birthday-bear-iconic-oski-turns-75/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until 1941, live bears were used as mascots. After 1946,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Berkeley: Traditions |year= 1966 |website= University of California History |url= http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/uchistory/general_history/campuses/ucb/traditions.html |accessdate= 2015-12-01 |quote= After 1946, Oski was the charge of a special committee. This group of men between 5'2" and 5'4" in height and possessed of considerable gymnastic ability, determined Oski's schedule, planned his stunts, and took turns assuming his character.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the bear's activities have been overseen by the Oski Committee, which also appoints a new Oski whenever a replacement is required. Oski's identity is protected by the Committee and wearers of the suit generally do not disclose their having worn the suit. There may be multiple members of the Committee who wear the suit depending on their schedules.

==Oski as presented in Cal fight songs==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2016}}
Oski is mentioned by name in several California fight songs.  In the songs, the name "Oski" is used interchangeably with the title "Golden Bear".  Several of the songs give an impression of Oski being a powerful guardian-being dwelling in the heavens, as well as sallying forth from a lair on Earth.  Oski is identified as the astronomical constellation [[Ursa Major]] (the Great Bear). Although Oski has his benign side ("patient" and "silent"), he is more often presented as growling, fighting, rumbling, grumbling, thundering, and shaking the ground. He is described as sturdy and mighty. It is said of Oski that he "wears a [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Paderewski]] hair", referring to Oski's shaggy hair.

Oski is described as "Our [[totem]]", and Cal's teams (or perhaps Cal students in general) are described as sons of the Golden Bear. In one song, Oski is referred to as "He" with a capital "H", as one refers to the [[Deity]]. One song appears to attribute to Oski the ability to fly through the air.

These characteristics are seen in the following lyrics of Cal fight songs:

[[Fight for California]] --
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Our sturdy Golden Bear
Is watching from the skies;
Looks down upon our colors fair,
And guards us from his lair.&lt;ref name="berkeley.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://calband.berkeley.edu/media/cal-songs/|title=Cal Songs ~ University of California Marching Band|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Big C (fight song)|Big "C"]] --
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Golden Bear is ever watching;
Day by day he prowls&lt;ref name="berkeley.edu"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[The Stanford Jonah]] --
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When our Oski rips through the air.
Like our friend Mister [[Jonah]], Stanford's team will be found,
In the [[stomach|tummy]] of the Golden Bear.&lt;ref name="berkeley.edu"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cal Band March --
&lt;blockquote&gt;
And when the game's done,
California's Golden Bear has carried the day.&lt;ref name="berkeley.edu"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

California, We're For You --
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All our rival's hopes are doomed to die,
When our Golden Bear looks down on high;
Hear our Oski's mighty thunder,

...

Brawn and brain are all in vain
Unless our spirit's there
In ev'ry son of the Golden Bear.

...

Let the echoes ring our Oski&lt;ref name="berkeley.edu"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Golden Bear --
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Oh, have you seen the heavens blue, heavens blue,
When just sev'n stars are shining through, shining through
Right overhead a jovial crew?
They're joining hands to make the Bear

...

And oh, that Bear's a glorious sight, glorious sight,
A-circling 'round the pole all night, pole all night;
And once you've seen him, you're all right,
You've seen our California Bear.

...

He has a very patient air, patient air,
He wears a Paderewski hair, 'rewski hair,
He's the center rush of the heavens I swear,
Our silent, sturdy Golden Bear.

...

A Californian through and through,
Our totem, He, the Golden Bear.&lt;ref name="berkeley.edu"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Make Way for the Bear --
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Rumbling, grumbling, loud upon the air,
Sounds the growling of the mighty Bear.
Californians gather 'round his Lair,
And march to Victory.

...

Marching along for California
We stride beside the fighting Bear.&lt;ref name="berkeley.edu"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

California Marching Song --
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Californians fight with the sturdy might
of the growling Golden Bear.
Our Oski sounds and shakes the ground
As vict'ry fills the air.&lt;ref name="berkeley.edu"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16349">'''Phokas''' or '''Phocas''' ({{lang-el|Φωκᾶς}}), feminine form '''Phokaina''' (Greek: Φώκαινα), was the name of a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] aristocratic clan from [[Cappadocia]], which in the 9th and 10th centuries provided a series of high-ranking generals and an [[Byzantine emperor|emperor]], [[Nikephoros II Phokas]] (r. 963–969). Its members and their clients monopolized the high command positions of the [[Byzantine army]] for much of the 10th century and led the successful Byzantine offensive against the [[Arabs]] in the East. As one of the leading families of the [[Anatolia]]n military aristocracy, the Phokades were also involved in a series of rebellions that laid claim to power and challenged the emperors at [[Constantinople]]. Their power was eventually broken by [[Basil II]] (r. 976–1025), and the family declined in importance after the 11th century.

==History==

===Origin and early members===
According to [[Michael Attaleiates]], the family descended from the ancient Roman ''[[gens Fabia]]'', while [[Ali ibn al-Athir]] ascribed them an [[Arab]] origin from [[Tarsos]]. Whatever their origins, the Phokades appear to have settled in Cappadocia, where their estates were concentrated and which is clearly attested as their power base and the center of their activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kazhdan|1991|pp=1665–1666}}; {{harvnb|Cheynet|1990|pp=213–214}}; {{harvnb|Krsmanović|2003|loc=[http://www.ehw.gr/asiaminor/forms/fLemmaBodyExtended.aspx?lemmaid=6634&amp;boithimata_State=&amp;kefalaia_State=#chapter_2 Chapter 1]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Whittow339"&gt;{{harvnb|Whittow|1996|p=339}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Various authors have speculated on an [[Armenians|Armenian]] or [[Georgians|Georgian]] origin,&lt;ref name="Whittow339"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cheynet|1990|p=324}}.&lt;/ref&gt; partly to account for the frequent presence of the name "Bardas" among the family members, but none of these hypotheses can be conclusively proven.&lt;ref name="ODB"&gt;{{harvnb|Kazhdan|1991|p=1666}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krsmanović|2003|loc=[http://www.ehw.gr/asiaminor/forms/fLemmaBodyExtended.aspx?lemmaid=6634&amp;boithimata_State=&amp;kefalaia_State=#noteendNote_2 Note 2]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Blinding of Leo Phokas.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The blinding of Leo Phokas.]]
The first attested member of the family was a soldier, probably of humble origin, who was appointed ''[[tourmarches]]'' in 872. His son, [[Nikephoros Phokas the Elder]], became a distinguished general, scoring several victories against the Arabs, especially in [[southern Italy]], and reaching the position of [[Domestic of the Schools]].&lt;ref name="Whittow339"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ODB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Treadgold|1997|pp=460, 462}}; {{harvnb|Krsmanović|2003|loc=[http://www.ehw.gr/asiaminor/forms/fLemmaBodyExtended.aspx?lemmaid=6634&amp;boithimata_State=&amp;kefalaia_State=#chapter_1 Chapter 2]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His son, [[Leo Phokas the Elder]], was also Domestic of the Schools, but was defeated by the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] tsar [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Symeon]] (r. 893–927), and later unsuccessfully opposed the rise of [[Romanos Lekapenos]] to the throne in 919, being captured and [[political mutilation in Byzantine culture|blinded]]. His brother, [[Bardas Phokas the Elder]], already active as a general, fell in disgrace for a time, but by the time of Lekapenos's fall in 944, he was a ''[[patrikios]]'' and a high-ranking general.&lt;ref name="ODB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Treadgold|1997|pp=474–476}}; {{harvnb|Krsmanović|2003|loc=[http://www.ehw.gr/asiaminor/forms/fLemmaBodyExtended.aspx?lemmaid=6634&amp;boithimata_State=&amp;kefalaia_State=#chapter_3 Chapter 3]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apex of power and fall===
After the fall of the Lekapenoi clan, [[Constantine VII]] appointed Bardas as Domestic of the Schools, while his sons [[Nikephoros II Phokas|Nikephoros]], [[Leo Phokas the Younger|Leo]], and [[Constantine Phokas|Constantine]] were placed as ''[[strategos|strategoi]]'' of the [[Theme (Byzantine district)|themes]] of [[Anatolikon]], [[Cappadocia (theme)|Cappadocia]], and [[Seleukeia (theme)|Seleukeia]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whittow|1996|p=347}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chapter 5"&gt;{{harvnb|Krsmanović|2003|loc=[http://www.ehw.gr/asiaminor/forms/fLemmaBodyExtended.aspx?lemmaid=6634&amp;boithimata_State=&amp;kefalaia_State=#chapter_5 Chapter 5]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These appointments heralded a period of over twenty years when the Phokades and their clients monopolized the Byzantine army's leadership. During this period, the Phokas clan was closely allied with the [[Maleinoi]], a rich and powerful family from [[Charsianon]], through the marriage of Bardas to a Maleinos lady. Other families that were closely aligned with and often related to them through marriage were the [[Adralestos|Adralestoi]], [[Skleros|Skleroi]], [[Kourkouas|Kourkouai]], [[Theodoulos Parsakoutenos|Parsakoutenoi]], [[Balantes (Byzantine family)|Balantai]], and [[Botaneiates|Botaneiatai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cheynet|1990|p=268}}; {{harvnb|Krsmanović|2003|loc=[http://www.ehw.gr/asiaminor/forms/fLemmaBodyExtended.aspx?lemmaid=6634&amp;boithimata_State=&amp;kefalaia_State=#chapter_4 Chapters 4] and [http://www.ehw.gr/asiaminor/forms/fLemmaBodyExtended.aspx?lemmaid=6634&amp;boithimata_State=&amp;kefalaia_State=#chapter_5 5]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Entrance of the emperor Nikephoros Phocas (963-969) into Constantinople in 963 from the Chronicle of John Skylitzes.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Entry of Nikephoros Phokas (r. 963-969) into Constantinople as emperor, from the ''[[Madrid Skylitzes]]''.]]

Bardas himself, already in his mid-sixties when named commander-in-chief, proved a mediocre general, suffering a string of defeats at the hands of the [[Hamdanid]] emir [[Sayf al-Dawla]]. [[Battle of Marash (953)|One of them]], in 953, even left his son Constantine captive in the Hamdanid's hands. Finally, in 955, Bardas was replaced by his son Nikephoros. With the aid of Leo, who had already established himself through victories of his own, and his nephew [[John Tzimiskes]], Nikephoros achieved a series of successes, recovering [[Crete]] and [[Cyprus]] and repeatedly defeating Sayf al-Dawla's forces.&lt;ref name="Chapter 5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Treadgold|1997|pp=486, 489–497}}; {{harvnb|Whittow|1996|pp=322–323, 325–326}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With the sudden death of [[Romanos II]] in 963, the popular and powerful Nikephoros seized the throne, becoming senior emperor and guardian over the young sons of Romanos, [[Basil II]], and [[Constantine VIII]]. His father Bardas was named ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'', and his brother Leo became ''[[kouropalates]]'' and ''[[logothetes tou dromou]]''. As emperor, Nikephoros continued his campaigns in the East, conquering [[Cilicia]] and northwestern [[Syria]].&lt;ref name="ODB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Treadgold|1997|pp=498–505}}; {{harvnb|Whittow|1996|pp=326–327, 348–349}}; {{harvnb|Krsmanović|2003|loc=[http://www.ehw.gr/asiaminor/forms/fLemmaBodyExtended.aspx?lemmaid=6634&amp;boithimata_State=&amp;kefalaia_State=#chapter_6 Chapter 6]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nikephoros's regime, however, quickly became unpopular, both due to his focus on military affairs to the detriment of the economy and for his religious policies. In December 969, he was murdered by a group of disaffected generals led by his nephew and one-time protégé John Tzimiskes, with the connivance of Empress [[Theophano (10th century)|Theophano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whittow|1996|pp=349–354}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Phokades were dismissed from their posts and titles and exiled by the new regime. [[Bardas Phokas the Younger]], the younger son of the ''kouropalates'' Leo and former ''[[dux|doux]]'' of [[Chaldia]], escaped and rose up in revolt in 970, but was defeated, [[tonsure]]d, and exiled to [[Chios]], while in 971 Leo and his eldest son the ''[[patrikios]]'' Nikephoros were [[political mutilation in Byzantine culture|blinded]] and their property confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Treadgold|1997|pp=507–508}}; {{harvnb|Whittow|1996|pp=354–355}}; {{harvnb|Krsmanović|2003|loc=[http://www.ehw.gr/asiaminor/forms/fLemmaBodyExtended.aspx?lemmaid=6634&amp;boithimata_State=&amp;kefalaia_State=#chapter_8 Chapter 7.1]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One member of the family had a different fate: Leo's daughter Sophia Phokaina had married Constantine Skleros, the brother of [[Bardas Skleros]]. Constantine was Tzimiskes's brother-in-law from his first marriage and a close ally of the new emperor. Their daughter, [[Theophanu|Theophano]], was married in 972 to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto II]] (r. 973–983).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davids|2002|pp=79–81}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clash between the armies of Bardas Skleros and Bardas Phokas.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Battle between the armies of Bardas Skleros and Bardas Phokas, from the ''Madrid Skylitzes''.]]

In 978, Bardas was recalled by Basil II to lead the imperial forces against the rebellion of Bardas Skleros. Named ''[[magistros]]'' and Domestic of the East, he managed to defeat Skleros. Bardas himself rebelled in 987, with the support of many of the major aristocratic families, in an uprising that lasted until his death in 989 at the Battle of Abydos. Skleros, who had returned from his Arab exile and had been captured by Bardas Phokas, tried to assume the leadership of the revolt, allying himself with Bardas's sons Leo and Nikephoros, but soon submitted to the emperor. Leo tried to hold out in [[Antioch]] but was surrendered to the emperor by the city's inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Treadgold|1997|pp=514–519}}; {{harvnb|Whittow|1996|pp=363–373}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EHW7.2"&gt;{{harvnb|Krsmanović|2003|loc=[http://www.ehw.gr/asiaminor/forms/fLemmaBodyExtended.aspx?lemmaid=6634&amp;boithimata_State=&amp;kefalaia_State=#chapter_9 Chapter 7.2]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later members of the family===
After facing down the rebellions of the large aristocratic families, Basil II undertook a series of measures to curb their power, wealth, and influence. The Phokades in particular were kept away from military posts and suffered the confiscation of their extensive estates. Basil's edict of 996, directed against the often illegal accumulation of vast estates by the Anatolian magnates, specifically names the Phokades and the closely allied Maleinoi as targets of the emperor's legislation.&lt;ref name="EHW7.2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Treadgold|1997|p=545}}; {{harvnb|Whittow|1996|pp=375–379}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Phokades, however, retained a measure of influence in their native Cappadocia: there, in 1022, Bardas Phokas's son [[Nikephoros Phokas Barytrachelos|Nikephoros]], surnamed ''Barytrachelos'' (Βαρυτράχηλος, "wry-neck"), in alliance with [[Nikephoros Xiphias]], was proclaimed emperor. He was soon murdered by Xiphias and the Phokas supporters deserted the revolt, which quickly broke apart.&lt;ref name="EHW7.2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Treadgold|1997|p=530}}; {{harvnb|Whittow|1996|p=379}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The last mention of a direct descendant of the Phokas family comes in 1026, when the ''patrikios'' Bardas, the grandson of the ''magistros'' Bardas, was accused of plotting against Emperor [[Constantine VIII]] (r. 1025–1028) and blinded.&lt;ref name="ODB"/&gt;{{sfn|Cheynet|1990|pp=39, 333}}&lt;ref name="EHW8"&gt;{{harvnb|Krsmanović|2003|loc=[http://www.ehw.gr/asiaminor/forms/fLemmaBodyExtended.aspx?lemmaid=6634&amp;boithimata_State=&amp;kefalaia_State=#chapter_10 Chapter 8]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

These events signalled the end of the direct line of the great 10th-century generals, which almost certainly died out by the mid-11th century. Nevertheless, the prestige attached to the family name remained considerable for a time after their end: the historian [[Michael Attaleiates]] praised [[Nikephoros III Botaneiates]] (r. 1078–1081) for being related to the Phokades, "whose glory stretches over all the land and the sea".&lt;ref name="EHW8"/&gt; The Phokas name is rarely mentioned thereafter, until it experienced a revival during the 13th century in the [[Empire of Nicaea]]: Theodotos Phokas, the uncle of [[Theodore I Laskaris]] (r. 1205–1222), became ''[[megas doux]]'', a certain Michael Phokas was ''[[stratopedarches]]'' in 1234, and another family member was [[metropolitan bishop]] of [[Alaşehir|Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name="ODB"/&gt;

'''Said-Emin Umarovich Dimayev''' ({{lang-ce|'''Саид-Эмин Умарович Димаев'''}}) (August 24, 1939 – March 28, 2005) was a [[Soviet people|Soviet]] composer.  His father [[Umar Dimayev]] was a legendary [[accordionist]] and [[folk musician]], and his brothers [[Ali Dimayev|Ali]] and [[Valid Dimayev|Valid]] are professional [[Chechen people|Chechen]] musicians.

Said was born in 1939 in the [[Chechen Autonomous Oblast]] of the [[Soviet Union]].  When Said was four years, he was deported along with his entire family to [[Kazakhstan]] as a result of the [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|forced deportations]] of the [[Chechen people|Chechens]] and [[Ingush people|Ingush]] to Central Asia on February 23, 1944.  After returning to [[Chechnya]] he studied at the [[Grozny Music College]], graduating in 1963.[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928120745/http://www.amina.com/article/edu.html]

Said then joined the music department of [[Gnessin State Musical College]], a prominent [[College or university school of music|conservatory]] in Moscow, and would move into the [[Musical composition|composition]] department of the institution.  After graduation, he returned to [[Grozny]] to serve as a music professor.[https://web.archive.org/web/20070607222214/http://www.chechen.org/modules.php?name=Known]

From 1970 Said worked as an artistic director of the Chechen-Ingush State Philharmonic Society, and in this position he helped create national [[folklore]] and entertainment [[musical ensemble|ensembles]].  He also served as the chief conductor of the folklore instruments orchestra on Chechen-Ingush television.

Said composed in various genres, including [[chamber music]], [[film music]], [[overtures]], and variations on folk melodies, and served as a member of the [[Union of Composers of Russian Federation]].  His compositions were played by orchestras in Moscow, [[Vladikavkaz]], [[Grozny]], and [[Tbilisi]].[http://www.chechnyafree.ru/index.php?lng=eng&amp;section=fculteng&amp;row=25]

In 2001 a collection of over one hundred melodies composed by Said Dimayev was released in Moscow, alongside his "Moscow's Autumn" suite.  He also authored the "Time to Act" [[oratio]].[http://www.chechnyafree.ru/index.php?lng=eng&amp;section=fculteng&amp;row=25]

Said died on March 28, 2005.

'''Samoans'''  or '''Samoan people''' ({{lang-sm|tagata Sāmoa}}), are a [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] ethnic group native to the [[Samoan Islands]], an archipelago in [[Polynesia]], who speak the [[Samoan language]]. The group's home islands are politically and geographically divided between the [[Samoa|Independent State of Samoa]] and [[American Samoa]], an [[unincorporated territory]] of the [[United States of America]]. Though divided by political powers, the culture and language remains one and the same.

Samoans were renown through the Pacific for their seafaring culture and thus was named the Navigator Islands by the first European visitors upon witnessing first hand the Samoan people's seafaring skills.

The Samoan people and culture form a vital link and stepping stone in the formation and spread of the Polynesian culture, language and religion throughout Eastern Polynesia.

A Polynesian culture of trade, religion, war, colonialism are important identifying markers within the Polynesian culture that almost certainly formed its roots within the Samoan culture. Samoa's colonial history with the kingdom of Tonga, Fiji and French Polynesia forming the impases for what is the modern Polynesian cultural marker points.

==Social Organization==
===The Matai===
[[File:High Chief and family, Samoa, ca 1914.jpg|thumb|Samoan chief and family, ca 1914]]
''Matai'', otherwise known as the head of the family and extended family, is a very important figure in the Samoan culture. There are many aspects that go into fully understanding the term ''Matai'', such as how one is elected and what their role is.

The election of a ''Matai'' is a lengthy process that can last up to several weeks and is often a highly competitive race. In this race different branches from each family put forth a male candidate, accompanied by reasons why he would be a good candidate. These reasons range from the candidate’s wisdom to wealth, including highly praised values such as negotiating, ritual knowledge, politics and economics. However, if the son of a ''matai'' meets these requirements, he is typically given a major edge in the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Culture sketches : case studies in anthropology |last=Peters-Golden |first=Holly |date=2012 |publisher=The McGraw-Hill |isbn=9780078117022 |edition=6th |location=Dubuque, Iowa |page=218 |oclc=716069710}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another advantage the son of a ''matai'' or any man in the ''matai’s'' household is given is being able to observe and help the ''matai'' starting from a young age. Most men considered for the ''Matai'' position are at least 40 years old, meaning many young candidates don’t even stand a chance. One strategy that can be used by any males aspiring to become a ''matai'' is to choose to live in a household that has no other males, or to move to his wife’s household if there are no males in her family's household either.&lt;ref name="Culture Sketches 219"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Culture sketches : case studies in anthropology |last=Peters-Golden |first=Holly |date=2012 |publisher=The McGraw-Hill |isbn=9780078117022 |edition=6th |location=Dubuque, Iowa |page=219 |oclc=716069710}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The election of a ''matai'' is under the guidance of another ''matai'' who is related to the family, allowing for a fair election. Once a new ''matai'' is chosen, a feast is thrown for the family, followed by a bigger feast for the whole village at a later date. At the larger feast, the ''matai'' is expected to give a traditional inaugural speech, displaying his abilities to speak publicly, his wisdom and retelling of Samoan myths. Throughout this speech he is watched by village council, as well as all the other ''matai’s'' in the village. Once the ''matai'' has proved himself to the other ''matai’s'' by giving the traditional address, he is called on to serve the community as a whole. The newly elected ''matai'' is expected to host a village wide feast where he is tasked with providing food for the meal, as well as getting the other ''matais'' gifts.&lt;ref name="Culture Sketches 219" /&gt;

Once this task is completed the newly elected ''matai'' is officially considered the ''matai'' of his household and will hold the position for the rest of his life, should he lead correctly. In certain cases where a ''matai'' is deemed cruel or ineffective, the title is stripped and a new ''matai'' is elected. However, a more often occurrence is the current ''matai'' becoming elderly or ill and requesting that a new ''matai'' be elected in order for there to be a more stable and effective leadership in place.&lt;ref name="Culture Sketches 219" /&gt;

The role of a ''matai'' is a very large and important one. He is expected to provide leadership in all aspects of family life. He encourages warm family relations, offers advice, directs religious participation, and oversees disputes. As well as watching over the family land and representing the family in village affairs. Overall, a ''matai'' must have different demeanor than everyone else, especially other males in the family. ''Matai's'' are also in charge of economic situations. For example, a ''matai'' must manage the amount of food his family brings in and must stores one away for when times are hard. The ''matai’s'' job as a leader is one that is very important in Samoan culture and helps the overall structure stay in place.&lt;ref name="Culture Sketches 219" /&gt;

=== The Aumaga ===
[[File:Portrait of a Samoan man carrying two containers over his shoulder (AM 86644-1).jpg|thumb|Samoan man carrying two containers over his shoulder]]
While chiefs, talking chiefs and ''matais'' all have a title, there are men in the village that are untitled. These men are placed in a group titled the ''aumaga''. These men are the labor core of the community as they perform most the hard labor. The ''aumaga'' are tasked with building houses, repairing roads, planting and harvesting the garden, fishing and cutting coconut meat and selling it. The ''aumaga'' also have ceremonial responsibilities, such as helping the chief in ritual cooking and serving the food at ceremonies. They also serve as informal keepers of peace, interacting with each other as a large group of friends. They often play cards, cricket or gather for dances and parties with each other. The ''Aumaga'' are under control of a relative of the chief, called the ''manaia'', who helps organize the ''aumaga'' and plan their activities . Despite not always being the true son of the chief, the ''manaia'' is still referred to as son by the chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Culture sketches : case studies in anthropology |last=Peters-Golden |first=Holly |date=2012 |publisher=The McGraw-Hill |isbn=9780078117022 |edition=6th |location=Dubuque, Iowa |page=221 |oclc=716069710}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aiga ===
[[File:StateLibQld 1 245736 Hanamenn Hunt and family, one of the Samoan families living in Queensland.jpg|thumb|Samoan family in 2003]]
The main leader of each individual household is named the Aiga of the family. One person, predominately a male figure, is elected to become the Aiga of his extended family. Elections take place after the former Aiga has died or is no longer to fulfill his duties, either for ethical reasonings or old age.Elections are a long and strenuous process for members of the extended family. For one portion of the family is going up against the other portion, leading to tensions within the whole family. Each Aiga is the owner of their family's land. On that piece of land, extended families live, grow crops, cook and do other household chores. Also on that piece of land is where another elected member resides, the Matai. Due to the large amount of households within a single village, there are a large amount of Aiga. So much so that some are able to trace back their Aiga timeline over a dozen different Aiga. The reasoning for the large amount of Aigas is that the title could be claimed through blood ties, marriage, and adoption.&lt;ref name="culture sketches"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Culture sketches : case studies in anthropology |last=Peters-Golden |first=Holly |date=2012 |publisher=The McGraw-Hill |isbn=9780078117022 |edition=6th |location=Dubuque, Iowa |pages=217, 218 |oclc=716069710}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Samoan Natives (Tagata Māo‘i) have long claimed to be the indigenous people of their islands — holding firm to the belief that Samoans were birthed from a tear in the Heavens (Lagi, Lani) [[special creation]] in Samoa — it has been theorized by many linguists and anthropologists, based on linguistic commonalities as well as archaeological findings, that migrants from [[Southeast Asia]] arrived in the Samoan Islands approximately 3500 years ago, settling in what has come to be known as [[Polynesia]] further to the east.

It is possible, as the natives suggest, that the Samoan Islands were settled some time before 1000 BC and that the original settlement predates the arrival of those to whom the pottery was culturally relevant. It is also generally a wide spread Cultural belief throughout Samoa that the Island's were the central base point for the beginning of the great voyages, the Polynesian expansion to the East and South.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=OZouDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT235&amp;dq=Polynesian+Expansion+Samoa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwis_sTs19LYAhVFqJQKHTqUBpsQ6AEIRjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Polynesian%20Expansion%20Samoa&amp;f=false|title=Waipi’O Valley: A Polynesian Journey from Eden to Eden|last=Gross|first=Jeffrey L.|date=2017-02-15|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=9781524539054|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These stories and Legends are recorded in print by European historians, Anthropologists, Archaeologists and still spoken of in contemporary times by Samoan High Chiefs in their great speeches and decrees during Kava ceremonies and Chiefly/ Royal ceremonies.

The voyages still spoken of in ancient Polynesian Chieftain Oratory poetics (lauga) are called 'Taeao'; a recalling of past histories and contacts within the Polynesian archipelago by Samoan Oral High Chiefs. These 'Taeaos' include oral and written accounts of familial tribal/klan contacts with the neighboring islands of;

1) Tokelau (New Zealand)

2) Tuamotu (French Polynesia)

3) Huahine (French Polynesia)

4) Tahiti (French Polynesia)

5) Ha'apai (Tonga)

6) Vava'u (Tonga)

7) Rarotonga (Cook Islands)

8) Pukapuka (Cook Islands)

9) Tuvalu

10) Havai'i (Hawaii)

11) Futuna (France)

12) Uvea (France)

13) Rotuma (Fiji)

14) Viti-Levu (Fiji)

Early contact with Europeans was established in the 18th century. Christianity was formally introduced with the arrival of [[London Missionary Society|L.M.S.]] Christian missionaries in August 1830.

During the early 20th century the [[Samoan Islands]] were partitioned by Germany, Great Britain and the USA. Tutuila and Aunu'u islands were claimed by the USA and later joined by the Kingdom of Manu'a (1904) to become the current Territory of [[American Samoa]]. The western islands became German Samoa. In 1914, New Zealand forces captured the islands from Germany, thus becoming Western Samoa. Western Samoa regained its independence on January 1, 1962. In 1997 it formally changed its name to Samoa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://samoa.usembassy.gov/samoan_history.html |title=Samoan History |publisher=Embassy of the United States |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820074537/http://samoa.usembassy.gov/samoan_history.html |archive-date=2008-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marriage and family ==
=== Marriage ===
[[File:Samoan girl, wearing an elaborate Lavalava, draped in a Siapo (barkcloth).jpg|thumb|Samoan girl wearing an elaborate Lavalava]]
Marriage ceremonies are considered important within the Samoan culture. Marriage involves the transfer of property of the female property, the toga, to the male property the oloa. It is a village event, with two ceremonies and a feast at the conclusion. In the first ceremony, the bride and groom march through the village to a district judge. The judge then conducts a civil ceremony. Concluding that official ceremony, the newlyweds next gather in a church where a religious ceremony is performed by a member of the church. At a feast, families provide food from all over the village. After the conclusion of the wedding, the newlyweds choose which side of the family they would like to live with. After moving in with a particular family, they are expected to do work around the land and the house to help provide for their family.

When families have children, they too are expected to help with duties and chores around the land. However, they are not expected to do much until ages three or four. The young girls take care of other children and housework, while the boys help with cultivation, animals and water gathering. By the time the children reach the age of seven or eight, they are supposed to know and are acclimated to the life and chores of the Samoan culture. This includes being adept in "agriculture, fishing, cooking, and child care"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; to go along with a multitude of other chores that their elders have directed them to do in past. As the Samoan people age the most tasks they are given and the most responsibilities they hold, until they can take over fully for the aging members of their extended family.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Culture sketches : case studies in anthropology |last=Peters-Golden |first=Holly |date=2012 |publisher=The McGraw-Hill |isbn=9780078117022 |edition=6th |location=Dubuque, Iowa |oclc=716069710}}{{Page needed|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Funerals ===
[[File:Tamasese funeral - Samoa 1930 - to the right is Faumuina chief with single stripe - AJ Tattersall.jpg|thumb|Funeral procession of Mau leader, Tamasese Lealofi II in Samoa in 1930.]]
When a member of extended family dies, the funeral preparations start almost immediately.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Choirs are directed to the mourner's land. The deceased body is bathed and dressed in white. They are placed on woven mats before the funeral less than 24-hours later.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Culture sketches : case studies in anthropology |last=Peters-Golden |first=Holly |date=2012 |publisher=The McGraw-Hill |isbn=9780078117022 |edition=6th |location=Dubuque, Iowa |oclc=716069710}}{{Page needed|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During those 24-hours, at least one family member has to stay with the deceased. A feast concludes the event, with food being served to mourners and people who helped with the burial.  Other family members take over the responsibilities of the deceased while still serving their own personal chores around the land.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Culture sketches : case studies in anthropology |last=Peters-Golden |first=Holly |date=2012 |publisher=The McGraw-Hill |isbn=9780078117022 |edition=6th |location=Dubuque, Iowa |oclc=716069710}}{{Page needed|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Land ==
The elected Matai of the community is the controller of every portion of a village land. The village Matai says what cultivators will do with land and "hold sway over allocation of plots and the ways in which those plots are used."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Culture sketches : case studies in anthropology |last=Peters-Golden |first=Holly |date=2012 |publisher=The McGraw-Hill |isbn=9780078117022 |edition=6th |location=Dubuque, Iowa |oclc=716069710}}{{Page needed|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only aspect the Matai does not control is who the land will go to after his death. This is to avoid it being controlled by one family for a long period of time. There are four categories that land is divided: Village House Lots, Underbrush, Family Reserve and Village Land.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== House village lots ===
[[File:Samoan house (LOC) (15556551485).jpg|thumb|A Samoan house under construction in the early portions of the 1900s. Samoan houses consist of three separate quarters, including the main sleeping quarters, a guest house, and latrines.]]
Village house lots is where individual houses or huts of single person or family lives. These houses are built in clusters. The clusters include multiple different aspects, but all look the same. Each house includes a main sleeping house, a guest house and a latrine.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Yards with trees and gardens make up the house village lot, with some lots containing the entirety of the extended family.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Underbrush ===
The underbrush covers the entirety of the land. These plots of land are recognizable to all villagers and are separated by boundaries. Boundaries are usually made up from a variety of rocks, streams, trees and plants. It is very easy to distinguish the different properties owned by separate families.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Family reserve ===
Family reserve sections are where crops are cultivated. The biggest amount of crops grown within the Samoan culture is taro leaves and yams.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These plots are available to be shared with other villages and other families. However, they would be no longer classified as a family reserve but regarded as owning the crops but not the land.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The family reserve is not cultivated as much as other sources of property. This is due to the fact that crops grown here are able to grow quickly and easily without many interruptions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Village land ===
Village land is the least cultivated and most shared portion of land in Samoan villages. To be able to plant here requires permission from the village council. This is because "the land is community property and not family owned".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Village land is the biggest aspect of any figure of land and is where hunting for food, such as wild pig and birds are allowed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Fishing is also an aspect that is allowed within village land.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Tattooing===
{{Main|Pe'a|Malu}}
[[File:Samoan Malu.jpg|thumb|Samoan Malu]]
[[File:Samoan Tattoo - front detail.jpg|thumb|Samoan Pe'a - front detail]]
Traditional Samoan tattoo (tatau), [[pe'a]] (male tatau), [[malu]] (female tatau), demonstrate the strong ties many Samoans feel for their culture. Samoans have practiced the art of tattooing men and women for over 2,000 years. To this day, a man's tattoo extensively covers from mid-back, down the sides and flanks, to the knees. A woman's tattoo is not as extensive or heavy. The geometric patterns are based on ancient designs that often denote rank and status. The va'a (canoe), for example, stretches across a man's mid-back.

In Samoa's cultural past most males were tattooed between the ages of 14–18, when it was determined they had stopped growing, so the designs would not stretch and suffer in beauty. Today, there has been a strong revival of traditional tattooing in the past generation, not only in Samoa but throughout Polynesia, often as a symbol of cultural identity.

Tatau, the Samoan word for tattoo has a number of meanings including ''correct'' or ''rightness''. It also signifies the correct quadrangular figures in reference to the fact that Samoan tattoo designs do not include circular lines, although other Polynesian tattoo motifs do. Early Englishmen mispronounced the word tatau and borrowed it into popular usage as tattoo.

Traditional tattooing is a painful process. The Samoan tattoo master dips his cutting tools into black ink made from the soot of burnt candlenut shells and then punctures designs into the skin. The cutting tool consists of a short piece of [[bamboo]] or light wood with a piece of [[tortoiseshell material|tortoiseshell]] bound at right angles at one end. A little bone comb is bound to the lower broad end of the tortoiseshell. The larger the comb, the greater the area on the skin is covered with fewer strokes. The master uses a small mallet to repeatedly tap a short-handled instrument. The process takes days and is sometimes partially accomplished over longer periods, with recuperation in between.

Tattoo designs have changed to include freehand symbols such as the kava bowl representing hospitality; the characterization of the Samoan house or fale signifying kinship; emblems of nature — shells, fish, birds, waves, centipedes; and the traditional geometric lines and angles of different lengths and sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.polynesia.com/samoa/samoan-tattoos.html |title=Samoan Tattoos |work=Polynesian Cultural Center |access-date=2011-08-22 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806150336/http://www.polynesia.com/samoa/samoan-tattoos.html |archive-date=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Samoa}}
[[File:USMC-100414-M-4787A-004.jpg|thumb|Samoa Police Band]]
Modern pop and rock have a large audience in Samoa, as do several native bands; these bands have abandoned most elements of Samoan traditional music, though there are folky performers. Recently, the population has seen a resurgence of old Samoan songs, remixed in the style of [[reggae]] but with some traditional elements, such as the use of the pate and old chord structure.

Initially in Samoan music,
&lt;blockquote&gt;"there were just two instruments in use; the pate, a hollowed out log drum that comes in various sizes, and the [[Music of Samoa|fala]], a rolled up mat beaten with sticks. In addition to this was the human voice. This limited range of instrumentation had no effect on the importance of music in Samoan life. Because there was no written language many stories and legends were propagated through song and the complex rhythms from the pate are essential in the performance of many Samoan dances. In fact in many dances, the dancers themselves add to the rhythm by clapping their hands, and dependent upon the way in which the hand is held produce a range of different sounds. Two instruments were developed that are now synonymous with Samoan music, the selo and the [[ukulele]]. The selo is a stringed instrument made from a broomstick, or similar object, attached to a large box, bucket or other object that acts as a sounding board. A single length of string joins the top of the stick to the box, which is plucked to produce a sound similar to that of a bass. The ukele is a small guitar-like instrument but with only four strings. It can be found in two forms, one which is like a miniaturised guitar, the other where the body is made from half a [[coconut]] shell."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Music |url=http://www.samoa.co.uk/music.html |website=Samoa.co.uk |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000307143902/http://www.samoa.co.uk/music.html |archivedate=March 7, 2000|deadurl=yes |accessdate=January 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Western [[string instrument]]s such as guitars are widely available across the Pacific Islands, with many bands performing and recording acoustic and amplified music in Samoa since the 1970s. Younger generations continue to perform in [[string band]]s as well as gravitate toward genres such as [[reggae]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[rhythm and blues]], [[Gospel music|gospel]] and [[Soul music|soul]].

===Dance===
{{Main|Samoan dance}}
[[File:Samoans on Harmony Day.jpg|thumb|Samoans on Harmony Day]]
The [[Fire knife]] dance or ''Siva Afi'' is the most popular Samoan dance among tourists in Samoa. The [[Fa'ataupati]] or slap dance, performed by males, consists of fierce slapping of the body in rhythmic motion to drum beats. Other Samoan dances include the [[Maulu'ulu]], which is an all-female dance that is more elegant. The [[Sasa (dance)|Sasa]] is a dance that can be performed by both males and females in a seated position or standing. The [[Siva Tau]] is a war dance performed by Samoan sporting teams before each match. [[Taualuga]] is a dance for the chief's son or daughter. When a girl does taualuga she is called a taupou, when a boy does a tauluga he is called a manaia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.samoa.co.uk/dance.html |title=Dance |website=Samoa.co.uk |access-date=May 4, 2004 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040427071406/http://www.samoa.co.uk/dance.html |archive-date=2004-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tommy Furey'', known as Tommy Tom Furey (1898-1979) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[Volunteer (Irish republican)|Volunteer]].

Tommy Tom Furey was a native of Oranbeg, Oranmore, and was a founding member of the [[Oranmore]] [[Irish volunteers]], established in 1914. Too young to carry a gun, he became a dispatch rider.

On the Tuesday after [[Easter Sunday]] 1916, the Oranmore Company assembled at 10.00 a.m. under the command of Captain [[Joe Howley]]. Furey participated in the following attack on the local R.I.C. station, which failed. They retreated to [[Clairinbridge]] where they were joined by the Clarinbridge and Maree companies, following which the three companies march back to Oranmore, and decided to march to [[Athenry]] to join up with the local company under command of [[Larry Lardner]]. This followed on information that a detachment of the British army led by Captain Morcombe were on the way from [[Galway]].

Captain Morcombe and his force reached the centre of Oranmore just as the last of the volunteers were leaving and a brief battle ensued. Furey remained with the volunteers over the next ten days, and participated in the seizing of Moyode Castle, Athenry. With the failure of the rebellion in Dublin the Galway companies disbanded, Furey and his brother Patsy returning home. They, along with almost all of the Oranmore company, were arrested, though their brother Johnny escaped to [[Connemara]]. Transferred to [[Arbour Hill]], Dublin, the Furey brothers were two of fourteen men from Oranmore - including their cousin, Tom Furey of Bushfield - court martialed and sentenced to five years [[penal]] servitude. They were shipped to [[United Kingdom|Britain]], serving time in [[Dartmoor]] prison.

Furey met [[Éamon de Valera]], also imprisoned at Dartmoor, and participated in a protest against wearing prison clothes. This resulted in Furey being chained to [[Thomas Ashe]], [[Eoin McNeill]], Tommy Hunter, J.J. Walsh, and Bill Cosgrave for the duration of their day-long transfer to [[Lewes Prison]], [[Brighton]]. In Lewes, Furey against participated in agitation, this time to be accorded Prisoner of War status, which resulted in being chained in gangs of seven and a diet of bread and water.

On 15 June 1917, all prisoners were released and given five shillings to return to [[Ireland]]. He had served time in a total of eight prisons.

On being asked by his granddaughter, Brenda Furey, why he never tried to escape, he stated ''"Your couldn't, there would be police with ammunition, continually walking around the wall, and even if we did where would we go because we didn't even know the country."''

Upon his return, he and other prisoners posed for a group photograph. In later life he was a valued source for local historians on the background and events of the Easter Rebellion in Galway, the only other one in the country outside of Dublin.

When Flores was twelve years old, he began work with illustrator Michelle Ciappa to prepare his children's book, "''The Spider Who Never Gave Up'''', for publishing.

'''Vladimir "Vlatko" Velebit''', [[PhD]] (1907&amp;ndash;2004) was a Yugoslav [[communist]] who joined the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisans]] in 1941, reaching the rank of Major-General. A lawyer by profession, after the war he became a diplomat and [[historian]].

Among his notable post-[[World War II]] appointments were the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] Ambassador to [[Rome]] as well as the [[Court of St. James's]] and [[World Bank]]. Additionally, he was Yugoslav Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade, and [[UNECE]] Executive Secretary from 1960 to 1967.

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Zadar]], [[Austria-Hungary]] to Serbian-Austrian father Ljubomir Velebit and Slovenian-Croatian mother Olga Šeme, Vladimir's family had a long military tradition. His father Ljubomir was an officer in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], fighting on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Russian front]] during [[World War I]] and later becoming brigadier-general in the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]], while Vladimir's paternal grandfather Dušan Velebit was a general in the Austrian Army who married Elisabeth Marno von Eichenhorst, daughter of another Austrian general Adolf Marno von Eichenhorst. Even Vladimir's great grandfather Ilija Velebit was an officer in the Austrian army.

His male ancestors were Serbs originating from the village of [[Gornja Pastuša]] near [[Petrinja]] in the [[Banija]] region that was part of the Austrian-created [[Military Frontier]]. They were recruited into the Austrian army, eventually achieving high ranks.

Velebit began his formal education in [[Timișoara]] in [[German language]]. His family left the city just after the outbreak of World War I and went to [[Trieste]] while his father was off in Russia fighting for the Austro-Hungarians. Young Vladimir was soon moved again, this time to [[Vienna]] where he got enrolled in private school that held classes in [[French language]]. Following the end of the war in 1918 and final break-up of [[Austria-Hungary]], the family moved to [[Zagreb]] that was now part of newly created [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]. At this point, 11-year-old Vladimir spoke very little [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] and had to study hard in order to be able to communicate in school. Due to his father's (who was now in the Royal Yugoslav Army) job, the family then moved to [[Čakovec]] and later to [[Varaždin]], which is where Vladimir graduated high school in 1925.

He started studies at the [[University of Zagreb]]'s Faculty of Law and then went to Paris for [[Academic specialization|specialization]], before returning to Zagreb to graduate in 1931. He earned his PhD two years later in 1933 from the same university.

==Legal career and communist activities on the side==
After passing the lawyer's and judge's exams, Velebit began working as legal assistant at the District Court in [[Niš]]. Accused of having leftist political leanings during his student days he got transferred to [[Leskovac]]. Once there he hooked up with [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia|Communist Party]] (KPJ) members (a political party that was at the time an underground organization because of the ban on its activities in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]) and took part in starting the newspaper ''Leskovačke nedeljne novine'' that wasn't openly communist, but supported political opposition to the ruling coalition and by proxy to King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander I Karađorđević]]. Because of this Velebit got transferred again, this time to [[Priština]] where he was a judge in the County Court. The continual career demotion didn't deter Velebit from continuing with leftist activity; in Priština he started a readers' group that met clandestinely in his room to read Marxist literature and discuss politics. When authorities caught wind of this, the county sheriff ordered his room to be searched, but nothing incriminating was found. Velebit then became the chief of County Court in [[Kičevo]], and later got transferred to [[Šid]] where he established contact with more KPJ members among whom was [[Herta Haas]] (at the time a student at Economics High School in Zagreb, later to become [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s wife).

By 1937 Velebit had enough of being a judge, and moved to Zagreb where he established a law practice. Already deeply involved with the communists, in parallel with his legal practice he became a courier for the underground movement. Due to the nature of his job and a considerable network of professional connections, he was perfectly suitable for carrying messages to foreign countries. On one of those trips to [[Istanbul]] in 1939, 32-year-old Velebit met 47-year-old Josip Broz Tito who was KPJ's general secretary at the time. Being impressed with Velebit's guile, skills, and intelligence, Tito immediately offered him membership in the party. After becoming a full-fledged member Velebit began working as assistant to [[Josip Kopinič]], [[Comintern]]'s agent in Zagreb. In 1940 Velebit obtained and set up a radio station used to establish daily contact with [[Moscow]] - the station was never discovered and was functional throughout the war.

==World War II==
Following [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|April 1941 Nazi invasion and dismemberment of the Yugoslav Kingdom]], Velebit stayed in Zagreb that became capital of the newly created Nazi client, [[Ustaše]]-run puppet state entity [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH). He operated as an underground collaborator of the KPJ-established [[People's Liberation Front (Yugoslavia)|People's Liberation Front]]. While working underground he used the alias name Vladimir Petrović, although due to being a well known and respected lawyer before the war he experienced no trouble with NDH authorities.

During March 1942 Velebit left Zagreb and joined the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] who mounted a guerrilla resistance to the Nazis and domestic collabrationists. Right away Tito included him in the army's Supreme Command where he mostly worked on establishing some sort of military court authority. Due to his education and knowledge of foreign languages, along with [[Koča Popović]] and [[Milovan Đilas]], Velebit was part of the Partisan delegation in [[Gornji Vakuf]] and Zagreb at the controversial March 1943 [[German-Partisan negotiations]] while the [[Battle of Neretva]] raged several hundred kilometers to the south. Velebit and Đilas conducted the negotiations under pseudonyms Vladimir Petrović and Miloš Marković, respectively, while Koča Popović gave his real name.

In June 1943, Velebit became the point of contact for foreign military missions in their dealings with the Partisans. Following the death of [[Ivo Lola Ribar]] (member of Supreme Command and the chief of Partisan first military mission) on 27 November 1943, Velebit took over his duties. Following the [[Teheran Conference]] where the Allies agreed on backing the Partisan resistance exclusively over the [[Chetniks|Chetnik]] one, Velebit was sent to the [[Near East]] with lieutenant-colonel [[Miloje Milojević]] for negotiations over the details and scope of the support. After establishing first contact with the Allies in [[Cairo]], he was on his way to [[London]] for further negotiations. Once there, Velebit had meetings with British envoys [[Sir Fitzroy Maclean, 1st Baronet|Fitzroy Maclean]] and [[William Deakin]] over the formal recognition of the People's Liberation Front as a new state entity. In May 1944 Velebit met with [[Winston Churchill]] and was also present in [[Caserta]] near [[Naples]] during Churchill's meeting with Tito on 12 August 1944.

==Post-war diplomatic career==
Right after the end of World War II Velebit continued his diplomatic activity.

In the [[Democratic Federal Yugoslavia]]'s provisionary government that got formed on the basis of British-brokered [[Treaty of Vis]] and later the [[Belgrade Agreement]], he was the deputy to the Foreign Affairs Minister. He then became one of the chief members of the secret Yugoslav diplomatic mission to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], negotiating the terms and scope of the American help to Yugoslavia. After returning home to the country that was in the meantime re-constituted as a [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] communist state called [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]], he became deputy to Foreign Affairs Minister [[Stanoje Simić]]. In that role, Velebit negotiated with the Allies during the [[Free Territory of Trieste|Trieste Crisis]].

In March 1948, after Soviet accusation that he was a British spy, Velebit was forced into resigning his post at the Yugoslav Foreign Affairs Ministry and got moved to the Tourist and Service Industry Committee. During the 1948 [[Cominform]] resolution and the fallout of subsequent Tito-Stalin split, Velebit was on more than one occasion cited by the Soviets as a spy who works for the British.

In 1951, Velebit became Yugoslav ambassador to [[Italy]], while a year later he got the same job in the [[United Kingdom]]. During March 1953, he prepared Tito's first official state visit to a Western country. Tito thus became the first communist leader to visit the UK.

In 1960, on invitation from the [[United Nations]] general-secretary [[Dag Hammarskjöld]], Velebit became executive secretary at the UN European Economic Commission ([[UNECE]]) in [[Geneva]]. He performed this job up until his retirement in 1967. Known in Western circles as a skilled diplomat, his last assignment was as an emissary of the [[Carnegie Foundation (Netherlands)|Carnegie Foundation]] in the Isreli-Palestinian conflict.

In the early 1990s during the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav breakup]] and the beginning stages of the [[Yugoslav Wars]], Velebit moved from London to Zagreb due to nationalist threats. Once back he divided his time between Zagreb and [[Mali Lošinj]].

In 1992 Velebit was a contributor for the [[Radio Television of Serbia]] documentary series entitled [[Yugoslavia in War 1941-1945]].

During retirement he wrote two books 1983's ''Sećanja'' (Memories) and 2002's ''Tajne i zamke Drugog svetskog rata'' (World War II's Secrets and Traps).

He died on 29 August 2004 at the Rebro clinical center in Zagreb. He was buried at the city's Mirogoj Cemetery on 3 September 2004.

Vladimir Velebit is mentioned in the 2009 book ''A Rat Hole to be Watched'' by American historian Coleman Armstrong Mehta as the point of contact between [[Frank Wisner]] (head of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s [[Directorate of Plans]]) and Yugoslav communist government during the early 1950s. Wisner apparently contacted Velebit because he was known to be the leading proponent of the idea that Yugoslav state should be oriented towards the [[Western world|West]]. According to Mehta's book that's based upon recently declassified American intelligence documents, the Wisner-Velebit contact, which occurred in the wake of [[Tito-Stalin split]], eventually resulted in intelligence cooperation agreement between the [[United States]] and [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]]. The agreement enabled the Americans to get their hands on recently developed and deployed [[MiG-15]] Soviet fighter plane, which was delivered to them by the [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s Yugoslav government in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Drustvo/218831/Tito-prodao-Amerikancima-tajne-ruskog-aviona Tito prodao Amerikancima tajne ruskog aviona]; ''Blic'', 21 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal==
Velebit married Vera Becić, a woman of Croatian ethnicity, the daughter of Croatian painter [[Vladimir Becić]]. They had two sons: Vladimir Jr. and Dušan.

'''Zeno of Citium''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|iː|n|oʊ}}; {{lang-el|[[wikt:Ζήνων|Ζήνων]] ὁ Κιτιεύς}}, ''Zēnōn ho Kitieus''; c. 334 – c. 262 BC) was a  [[Hellenistic]] thinker, of [[Phoenicia]]n descent, &lt;ref&gt;[[Edwyn Bevan]],''[https://books.google.com/books?id=M8R1OzqNS20C&amp;pg=PA15 Stoics and Sceptics]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/656527/Zeno-Of-Citium |title=Zeno of Citium |encyclopedia=Britannica Encyclopaedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Kition|Citium]] ({{lang|el|Κίτιον}}, ''Kition''), [[Cyprus]]. Zeno was the founder of the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] school of philosophy, which he taught in [[Athens]] from about 300 BC. Based on the moral ideas of the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]], Stoicism laid great emphasis on [[good and evil|goodness]] and [[calmness|peace of mind]] gained from living a life of [[Virtue]] in accordance with [[Nature]]. It proved very popular, and flourished as one of the [[Hellenistic philosophy|major schools of philosophy]] from the [[Hellenistic period]] through to the [[Roman era]].

==Life==
Zeno was born c. 334 BC,{{efn|name="dates"}} in [[Kition|Citium]] in [[Cyprus]]. Most of the details known about his life come from the biography and anecdotes preserved by [[Diogenes Laërtius]] in his ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]''. Diogenes reports that Zeno's interest in philosophy began when "he consulted the oracle to know what he should do to attain the best life, and that the god's response was that he should take on the complexion of the dead. Whereupon, perceiving what this meant, he studied ancient authors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0258:book=7:chapter=1|title=Diogenes Laertius, Lives of Eminent Philosophers, BOOK VII, Chapter 1. ZENO (333-261 B.C.)|author=|date=|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zeno became a wealthy merchant. On a voyage from Phoenicia to Peiraeus he survived a shipwreck, after which he went to Athens and visited a bookseller. There he encountered [[Xenophon]]'s &lt;i&gt;[[Memorabilia (Xenophon)|Memorabilia]]&lt;/i&gt;. He was so pleased with the book's portrayal of [[Socrates]] that he asked the bookseller where men like Socrates were to be found. Just then, [[Crates of Thebes]], the most famous [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] living at that time in [[Greece]] happened to be walking by, and the bookseller pointed to him.{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 2–3}}

Zeno is described as a haggard, dark-skinned person,{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 1}} living a spare, [[ascetic]] life{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 26–27}} despite his wealth. This coincides with the influences of Cynic teaching, and was, at least in part, continued in his Stoic philosophy. From the day Zeno became Crates’ pupil, he showed a strong bent for philosophy, though with too much native modesty to assimilate Cynic shamelessness. Hence Crates, desirous of curing this defect in him, gave him a potful of lentil-soup to carry through the Ceramicus; and when he saw that Zeno was ashamed and tried to keep it out of sight, Crates broke the pot with a blow of his staff. As Zeno began to run off in embarrassment with the lentil-soup flowing down his legs, Crates chided, "Why run away, my little Phoenician? Nothing terrible has befallen you."{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 3}}

Apart from Crates, Zeno studied under the philosophers of the [[Megarian school]], including [[Stilpo]],{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 2, 24}} and the [[dialectic]]ians [[Diodorus Cronus]],{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 16, 25}} and [[Philo the Dialectician|Philo]].{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 16}} He is also said to have studied [[Platonist]] philosophy under the direction of [[Xenocrates]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 2}}; but note that Xenocrates died 314/13 BC&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Polemon (scholarch)|Polemo]].{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 2, 25}}

Zeno began teaching in the [[Stoa|colonnade]] in the [[Ancient Agora of Athens|Agora of Athens]] known as the [[Stoa Poikile]] (Greek Στοὰ Ποικίλη) in 301 BC. His disciples were initially called Zenonians, but eventually they came to be known as Stoics, a name previously applied to poets who congregated in the Stoa Poikile.

Among the admirers of Zeno was king [[Antigonus II Gonatas]] of [[Macedon]]ia,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 6–9, 13–15, 36}}; Epictetus, ''Discourses'', ii. 13. 14–15; Simplicius, ''in Epictetus Enchiridion'', 51; Aelian, ''Varia Historia'', ix. 26&lt;/ref&gt; who, whenever he came to Athens, would visit Zeno. Zeno is said to have declined an invitation to visit Antigonus in Macedonia, although their supposed correspondence preserved by Laërtius{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 6–9}} is undoubtedly the invention of a later writer.&lt;ref name="brunt"&gt;{{cite book|first=P. A.|last=Brunt|chapter=The Political Attitudes of the Old Stoa|page=87|title=Studies in Stoicism|publisher =Oxford University Press|editor1-first=Miriam|editor1-last=Griffin|editor2-first=Alison|editor2-last=Samuels|year=2013|isbn=9780199695850}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zeno instead sent his friend and disciple [[Persaeus]],{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 6–9}} who had lived with Zeno in his house.{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 13, comp. 36}} Among Zeno's other pupils there were [[Aristo of Chios]], [[Sphaerus]], and [[Cleanthes]] who succeeded Zeno as the head (''[[scholarch]]'') of the Stoic school in Athens.{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 37}}

Zeno is said to have declined Athenian citizenship when it was offered to him, fearing that he would appear unfaithful to his native land,&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''de Stoicor. repugn'', p. 1034; comp. {{harvnb|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; where he was highly esteemed, and where he contributed to the restoration of its baths, after which his name was inscribed upon a pillar there as "Zeno the philosopher".{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 6}} We are also told that Zeno was of an earnest, gloomy disposition;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 16, comp. 26}}; Sidonius Apollinaris, ''Epistles'', ix. 9&lt;/ref&gt; that he preferred the company of the few to the many;{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 14}} that he was fond of burying himself in investigations;{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 15}} and that he disliked verbose and elaborate speeches.{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 18, 22}} Diogenes Laërtius has preserved many clever and witty remarks by Zeno,{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 18–25}} although these anecdotes are generally considered unreliable.&lt;ref name="brunt"/&gt;

Zeno died around 262 BC.{{Ref label|A|a|none}} Laërtius reports about his death: 
:As he was leaving the school he tripped and fell, breaking his toe. Striking the ground with his fist, he [[last words|quoted]] the line from the ''[[Niobe]]'':
::"I come, I come, why dost thou call for me?"
:and died on the spot through holding his breath.{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 28}}

During his lifetime, Zeno received appreciation for his philosophical and [[pedagogical]] teachings. Among other things, Zeno was honored with the golden crown,{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 6, 11}} and a tomb was built in honor of his moral influence on the youth of his era.{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 10–12}}

The crater [[Zeno (crater)|Zeno]] on the [[Moon]] is named in his honour.

==Philosophy==
[[File:Zenon Kitiefs.JPG|thumb|Modern bust of Zeno in Athens]]
Following the ideas of the [[Platonic Academy|Academics]], Zeno divided [[philosophy]] into three parts: [[Logic]] (a very wide subject including [[rhetoric]], [[grammar]], and the theories of [[perception]] and [[thought]]); [[Physics]] (not just [[science]], but the [[divinity|divine]] nature of the universe as well); and [[Ethics]], the end goal of which was to achieve happiness through the right way of living according to Nature. Because Zeno's ideas were later expanded upon by [[Chrysippus]] and other Stoics it can be difficult to determine precisely what he thought. But his general views can be outlined as follows:

===Logic===
In his treatment of Logic, Zeno was influenced by [[Stilpo]] and the other [[Megarian school of philosophy|Megarians]]. Zeno urged the need to lay down a basis for Logic because the wise person must know how to avoid deception.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Academica'', ii. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cicero]] accused Zeno of being inferior to his philosophical predecessors in his treatment of Logic,&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''de Finibus'', iv. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and it seems true that a more exact treatment of the subject was laid down by his successors, including [[Chrysippus]].&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, ''adv. Math.'' vii. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; Zeno divided true conceptions into the comprehensible and the incomprehensible,&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Academica'', ii. 6, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; permitting for free-will the power of assent (''sinkatathesis''/συνκατάθεσις) in distinguishing between sense impressions.&lt;ref name="cicero1"&gt;Cicero, ''Academica'', i. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Zeno said that there were four stages in the process leading to true [[knowledge]], which he illustrated with the example of the flat, extended hand, and the gradual closing of the fist:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Zeno stretched out his fingers, and showed the palm of his hand, – "Perception," – he said, – "is a thing like this."-  
Then, when he had closed his fingers a little, – "Assent is like this." – Afterwards, when he had completely closed his hand, and showed his fist, that, he said, was Comprehension. From which simile he also gave that state a new name, calling it ''[[katalepsis]]'' (κατάληψις). But when he brought his left hand against his right, and with it took a firm and tight hold of his fist: – "Knowledge" – he said, was of that character; and that was what none but a wise person possessed.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Academica'', 2.145 [47]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Physics===
The [[Universe]], in Zeno's view, is [[God]]:{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 148}} a divine reasoning entity, where all the parts belong to the whole.&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, ''adv. Math.'' ix. 104, 101; Cicero, ''de Natura Deorum'', ii. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Into this [[pantheistic]] system he incorporated the physics of [[Heraclitus]]; the Universe contains a divine artisan-fire, which foresees everything,&lt;ref name="cicero2"&gt;Cicero, ''de Natura Deorum'', ii. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; and extending throughout the Universe, must produce everything:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Zeno, then, defines nature by saying that it is artistically working fire, which advances by fixed methods to creation. For he maintains that it is the main function of art to create and produce, and that what the hand accomplishes in the productions of the arts we employ, is accomplished much more artistically by nature, that is, as I said, by artistically working fire, which is the master of the other arts.&lt;ref name="cicero2"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This divine fire,&lt;ref name="cicero1"/&gt; or aether,&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Academica'', ii. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; is the basis for all activity in the Universe,&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''de Natura Deorum'', ii. 9, iii. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; operating on otherwise passive matter, which neither increases nor diminishes itself.{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 150}} The primary substance in the Universe comes from fire, passes through the stage of air, and then becomes water: the thicker portion becoming earth, and the thinner portion becoming air again, and then rarefying back into fire.{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 142, comp. 136}} Individual [[souls]] are part of the same fire as the world-soul of the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Tusculanae Quaestiones'', i. 9, ''de Natura Deorum'', iii. 14; {{harvnb|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 156}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Heraclitus, Zeno adopted the view that the Universe underwent regular cycles of formation and destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Stobaeus, ''Ecl. Phys.'' i.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nature of the Universe is such that it accomplishes what is right and prevents the opposite,&lt;ref name="cicero3"&gt;Cicero, ''de Natura Deorum'', i. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; and is identified with unconditional [[Destiny|Fate]],{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 88, 148, etc., 156}} while allowing it the free-will attributed to it.&lt;ref name="cicero2"/&gt;

===Ethics===
[[File:Zeno of Citium Nuremberg Chronicle.jpg|right|thumb|Zeno, portrayed as a medieval scholar in the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'']]
Like the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]], Zeno recognised a single, sole and simple good,&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Academica'', i. 10. 35-36 : "Zeno igitur nullo modo is erat qui ut Theophrastus nervos virtutis inciderit, sed contra qui omnia quae ad beatam vitam pertinerent in una virtute poneret nec quicquam aliud numeraret hi bonis idque appellaret honestum quod esset simplex quoddam et solum et unum bonum."&lt;/ref&gt; which is the only goal to strive for.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''de Finibus'', iii. 6. 8; comp. {{harvnb|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 100, etc}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "Happiness is a good flow of life," said Zeno,&lt;ref&gt;Stobaeus, 2.77.&lt;/ref&gt; and this can only be achieved through the use of right Reason coinciding with the Universal Reason (''[[Logos]]''), which governs everything. A bad feeling (''pathos'') "is a disturbance of the mind repugnant to Reason, and against Nature."&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Tusculanae Quaestiones'', iv. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; This consistency of soul, out of which morally good actions spring, is [[Virtue]],&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Tusculanae Quaestiones'', iv. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; true good can only consist in Virtue.{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 102, 127}}

Zeno deviated from the Cynics in saying that things that are morally indifferent could nevertheless have value. Things have a relative value in proportion to how they aid the natural instinct for self-preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 85}}; Cicero, ''de Finibus'', iii. 5, 15, iv. 10, v. 9, ''Academica'', i. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; That which is to be preferred is a "fitting action" (''[[kathekon|kathêkon]]''/καθῆκον), a designation Zeno first introduced.  Self-preservation, and the things that contribute towards it, has only a conditional value; it does not aid happiness, which depends only on moral actions.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''de Finibus'', iii. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as Virtue can only exist within the dominion of Reason, so [[evil|Vice]] can only exist with the rejection of Reason. Virtue is absolutely opposed to Vice,&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Tusculanae Quaestiones'', iv. 13, ''Academica'', i. 10, ''de Finibus'', iii. 21, iv. 9, ''Parad.'' iii. 1; {{harvnb|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 127}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the two cannot exist in the same thing together, and cannot be increased or decreased;&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''de Finibus'', iii. 14, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; no one moral action is more virtuous than another.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''de Finibus'', iii. 14; Sextus Empiricus, ''adv. Math.'' vii. 422.&lt;/ref&gt; All actions are either good or bad, since impulses and desires rest upon free consent,&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Tusculanae Quaestiones'', iv. 9, ''Academica'', i. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; and hence even passive mental states or emotions that are not guided by reason are immoral,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 110}}; Cicero, ''Tusculanae Quaestiones'', iv. 6. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; and produce immoral actions.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''de Finibus'', iv. 38; Plutarch, ''de Virt. mor.''&lt;/ref&gt; Zeno distinguished four negative [[emotions]]: desire, fear, pleasure and pain (''epithumia, phobos, hêdonê, lupê'' / ἐπιθυμία, φόβος, ἡδονή, λύπη),&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Tusculanae Quaestiones'', iv. 6; {{harvnb|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 110}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and he was probably responsible for distinguishing the three corresponding positive emotions: will, caution, and joy (''boulêsis, eulabeia, chara'' / βούλησις, εὐλάβεια, χαρά), with no corresponding rational equivalent for pain. All errors must be rooted out, not merely set aside,&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Tusculanae Quaestiones'', iv. 18, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced with right reason.

==Works==
None of Zeno's writings have survived except as fragmentary quotations preserved by later writers. However, the titles of many of Zeno's writings are known and are as follows:{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 4}}
*Ethical writings:
**Πολιτεία – ''[[The Republic (Zeno)|Republic]]''
**Περὶ τοῦ κατὰ φύσιν βίου – ''On Life according to Nature''
**Περὶ ὁρμῆς ἢ Περὶ ἀνθρώπου φύσεως – ''On Impulse, or on the Nature of Humans''
**Περὶ παθῶν – ''On Passions''
**Περὶ τοῦ καθήκοντος – ''On Duty''
**Περὶ νόμου – ''On Law''
**Περὶ τῆς Ἑλληνικῆς παιδείας – ''On Greek Education''
*Physical writings:
**Περὶ ὄψεως – ''On Sight''
**Περὶ τοῦ ὅλου – ''On the Universe''
**Περὶ σημείων – ''On Signs''
**Πυθαγορικά – ''Pythagorean Doctrines''
*Logical writings:
**Καθολικά – ''General Things''
**Περὶ λέξεων
**Προβλημάτων Ὁμηρικῶν εʹ – ''Homeric Problems''
**Περὶ ποιητικῆς ἀκροάσεως – ''On Poetical Readings''
*Other works:
**Τέχνη
**Λύσεις – ''Solutions''
**Ἔλεγχοι βʹ
**Ἄπομνημονεύματα Κράτητος ἠθικά
**Περὶ οὐσίας – ''On Being''
**Περὶ φύσεως – ''On Nature''
**Περὶ λόγου – ''On the Logos''
**Εἰς Ἡσιόδου θεογονίαν
**Διατριβαί – ''Discourses''
**Χρεῖαι

The most famous of these works was [[The Republic (Zeno)|Zeno's ''Republic'']], a work written in conscious imitation of (or opposition to) [[Plato]]. Although it has not survived, more is known about it than any of his other works. It outlined Zeno's vision of the ideal Stoic society built on egalitarian principles.

==Notes==
{{notelist|refs=
{{efn|name="dates"|1=The dates for Zeno's life are controversial. According to [[Apollodorus of Athens|Apollodorus]], as quoted by [[Philodemus]], Zeno died in Arrheneides' [[Archon of Athens|archonship]] (262/1 BC). According to [[Persaeus]] ([[Diogenes Laërtius]] vii. 28), Zeno lived for 72 years. His date of birth is thus 334/3 BC. A plausible chronology for his life is as follows: He was born 334/3 BC, and came to Athens in 312/11 BC at the age of 22 {{harv|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 28}}. He studied philosophy for about 10 years {{harv|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 2}}; opened his own school during Clearchus' archonship in 301/0 BC (Philodemus, ''On the Stoics'', col. 4); and was the head of the school for 39 years and 3 months (Philodemus, ''On the Stoics'', col. 4), and died 262/1 BC.
