The 100,000 capacity '''Algarve International Circuit''' ({{lang-pt|Autódromo Internacional do Algarve}}), commonly referred to as '''Portimao Circuit''', is a {{convert|4.692|km|mi|abbr=on}} race circuit located in [[Portimão]], [[Portugal]]. With a total cost of €195 million (approximately $250 million), the project includes a karting track, technology park, five-star hotel, sports complex and apartments.&lt;ref name="circuit"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldsbk.com/pubb_EN/news_ext.php?id=20 |title=Algarve International circuit launched |publisher=worldsbk.com |accessdate=2008-02-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411222355/http://www.worldsbk.com/pubb_EN/news_ext.php?id=20 |archivedate=2008-04-11 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction was finished in October 2008 and the circuit was homologated by both the [[Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme|FIM]] on 11 October 2008 and the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] two days later.&lt;ref name="Automotor"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.automotor.xl.pt/?s=15&amp;n=20844&amp;nivel=3|title=FIA homologa Autódromo do Algarve |accessdate=2008-10-24 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

The circuit was designed by  Ricardo Pina, Arquitectos. In October 2010 the teams agreed to add the Portimao Circuit to the Formula One testing roster along with Bahrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/87422 |title=Portimao set to join F1 testing roster| work=Autosport | date=2010-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, the company that manages the circuit, Parkalgar Serviços, was taken over by Portugal Capital Ventures, which is a Portuguese state-owned [[venture capitalist]], effectively placing the circuit under state management. The sale was forced by the debts accumulated by Parkalgar Serviços, believed to be approximately 160 million Euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sulinformacao.pt/2013/09/autodromo-do-algarve-passa-para-as-maos-do-estado-portugues|title=Autódromo do Algarve passa para as mãos do Estado Português| work=Sul Informação | date=2013-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 4, 2009 [[Max Mosley]] stated that based on the quality of the circuit it could integrate the [[Formula One]] championship under the guise of the [[Portuguese Grand Prix]], as long as a commercial agreement with the [[Formula One Management]] is achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Fórmula 1: Max Mosley diz que Autódromo do Algarve pode integrar calendário |publisher=expresso.pt |url=http://aeiou.expresso.pt/formula-1-max-mosley-diz-que-autodromo-do-algarve-pode-integrar-calendario-apos-haver-acordo-com-gestora-comercial=f507199 |date=2009-04-04 |accessdate=2009-04-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414193411/http://aeiou.expresso.pt/formula-1-max-mosley-diz-que-autodromo-do-algarve-pode-integrar-calendario-apos-haver-acordo-com-gestora-comercial%3Df507199 |archivedate=14 April 2009 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circuit resembles old [[Nürburgring]] and [[Spa-Francorchamps]], mainly because of its constantly undulating nature.  [[A1 Team Portugal]]'s driver [[Filipe Albuquerque]] observed that there are big downhill slopes and right-hand turns after the main straight. He also commented that the track is good for overtaking because the circuit width. [[A1 Team New Zealand]]'s driver [[Earl Bamber]] observed that there are many special turns with personality. He commented that the new circuit is a little bit dangerous like the old school circuits with a roller coaster ride. [[A1 Team France]]'s driver [[Nicolas Prost]] commented that the asphalt is new and the circuit has little grip.

It has been confirmed that one of the corners of the circuit was named after former World Supersport rider [[Craig Jones (motorcycle racer)|Craig Jones]] who was killed in a motorcycle crash at [[Brands Hatch]] in 2008.

==Craig Jones memorial==
On 2009, October 22, a tribute ceremony occurred, with the exhibition of a provisional statue, created by the Portuguese sculptress [[Paula Hespanha]], representing [[Craig Jones (motorcycle racer)|Craig Jones]] on his motorbike after passing the finishing line. This statue will be the main part of a [[monument]], already partially built, which also includes the architectural arrangement of the main access roundabout to the racetrack, created by Paula Hespanha and Portuguese architect Manuel Pedro Ferreira Chaves.
This monument is a [[landscape]] [[sculpture]], representing the main straight of a racing circuit, which extends up to the car park of the main grandstand. This large-scale artistic intervention serves to frame the statue but will also be useful as an access that will allow pedestrian approach to the statue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hardmusica.pt/noticia_detalhe.php?cd_noticia=3352 |title=Paula Hespanha expõe estátua de Craig Jones|date=October 2009 |accessdate=2011-01-12 |work=Hardmusica}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The owner of Autódromo Internacional do Algarve and Parkalgar racing team, Paulo Pinheiro, declared: "it is a very special thanks to Craig Jones who will be forever immortalized in our memories. This tribute will keep alive the admiration and respect for the work of Craig in the motorcycling world ".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barlavento.pt/index.php/noticia?id=37152 |title=Motociclismo: Autódromo do Algarve inaugura estátua em memória do piloto Craig Jones |date=2009-10-23 |accessdate=2011-01-12 |work=agência lusa |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317061150/http://www.barlavento.pt/index.php/noticia?id=37152 |archivedate=2012-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "This monument will ensure that Craig Jones will never be forgotten."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.algarveresident.com/story.asp?ID=34597 |title=Craig Jones remembered with statue honor |date=2009-10-30 |accessdate=2011-01-12 |work=Eloise Walton |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408225145/http://www.algarveresident.com/story.asp?ID=34597 |archivedate=2011-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Australian Institute of Sport]] (AIS)''' competed in the [[Women's National Basketball League]] ([[Women's National Basketball League|WNBL]]) as a team of the AIS Athletes. They won the WNBL Championship just once, in the [[1998–99 WNBL season]], led by a young [[Lauren Jackson]]. The team continued to compete in the WNBL through the [[2011–12 WNBL season|2011–12 season]], but withdrew at the end of that season. AIS were largely uncompetitive in their last years in the WNBL, winning only 29 matches and losing 188 in their final ten WNBL seasons, including a two-season record of 1—41 in [[2005–06 WNBL season|2005–06]] and [[2006–07 WNBL season|2006–07]]. The withdrawal was coordinated with [[Basketball Australia]], which sought to address the flagging depth in its female junior ranks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jon Tuxworth |url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/sport/basketball/ais-set-to-exit-wnbl-20120423-1xhpj.html |title=AIS set to exit WNBL |publisher=Canberratimes.com.au |date=2012-04-24 |accessdate=2012-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Be Military Fit''', or BMF, is a private company which runs outdoor group fitness classes in 140 public parks and outdoor spaces across the [[United Kingdom]]. The classes are led by former or serving members of the [[British Armed Forces]] with recognised fitness training qualifications. 

BMF was founded in 1999 as '''British Military Fitness''' and pioneered the concept of group classes for [[outdoor fitness]] in the United Kingdom. In September 2018 it was purchased by NM Capital and [[Bear Grylls]] Ventures and re-branded as Be Military Fit. It is the largest outdoor fitness company in Europe.

==History==
British Military Fitness (BMF) was founded in 1999 by retired Major Robin Cope ([[Royal Anglian Regiment|Anglians]]), Corporal Harry Sowerby ([[Royal Green Jackets|4RGJ]]) and Corporal William Skinner ([[10th Parachute Battalion (United Kingdom)|10 Para]]). The idea was born on the film set of [[Saving Private Ryan]] in October 1998. Robin Cope suggested the idea of training civilians in parks. He thought that an added emphasis should be made on providing motivation which was lacking in the majority of those who work out in gyms. Harry Sowerby had just completed his Reservist Army [[Physical training instructor|Physical Training Instructors]] course (PTI) and along with Will Skinner agreed to join with Robin in this new venture. Each invested £1000, so with a total of £3000 BMF was launched. £1000 was spent on some second hand computers, some money was spent on class equipment like mats and numbered bibs and £1000 was spent on one [[London Evening Standard|Evening Standard]] advert. The first-ever BMF class was held in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] in April or June 1999 (sources vary) and attracted three or ten clients (sources vary). By the end of the year, there were 200 members.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://startups.co.uk/british-military-fitness-robin-cope/|title=British Military Fitness: Robin Cope|last=|first=|date=24 August 2011|work=Startups|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.coachmag.co.uk/fitness/5774/british-military-fitness-co-founder-harry-sowerby|title=British Military Fitness Co-Founder Harry Sowerby|date=20 September 2016|work=Coach|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/how-do-you-score-7281424.html|title=How do you score?|last=|first=|date=5 May 2004|work=Evening Standard|access-date=2018-10-03|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.easyresettlement.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/ER_Magazine_Autumn_2013SP.pdf|title=Fit For Role - Careers in Health and Fitness|last=|first=|date=Autumn 2013|website=Easy Resettlement|pages=14-15|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bemilitaryfit.com/blog/how-bmf-started|title=How British Military Fitness Began|last=Hatcher|first=Bonnie|access-date=2018-10-07|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2000s, the company expanded rapidly across the United Kingdom and pioneered the growth in the market for outdoor fitness group classes. It launched in South Africa in 2008. The company innovated training and partnerships in the industry and expanded into events and fitness holidays.

The first ten minutes of a class are spent warming up, before fifty minutes of intense fitness exercises, which can vary from [[circuit training]], relays, [[sprint (running)|sprint]]s, military activities and team games. The class is punctuated by a quick water break at the midpoint and ends with a five-minute cool-down and stretching session.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Unlike the controlled environment of a gym, lessons vary from class to class with instructors making full use of the surrounding features of the park. Alongside the military fitness classes, BMF also offers [[running club]]s in certain locations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Beverley Ground''' was a [[cricket]] ground in [[Canterbury]] in [[Kent]]. It was in use in the mid-19th century, with recorded matches taking place between 1839 and 1846. It was the home ground of Beverley Cricket Club and was where the first [[Kent County Cricket Club]] was formed in August 1842 during [[Canterbury Cricket Week]] which was held at the ground until 1846.

The ground was on the Sturry Road in east Canterbury. The name may also refer to the club's previous ground at St Stephen's in west Canterbury. A total of 15 [[first-class cricket]] matches were held on the ground.

==Establishment and cricket history==
[[File:Kentvengland1842poster.jpg|thumb|Poster for the 1842 match against an England XI]]
Some of the earliest references to cricket are found in Kent and [[Kent county cricket teams|teams from the county]] dominated the game between 1830 and 1850. The Beverley Cricket Club was formed in 1835 at the [[Canterbury]] estate of brothers John and [[William Baker (cricketer, born 1823)|William Baker]].&lt;ref name=birley80&gt;[[Derek Birley|Birley D]] (1999) ''A Social History of Cricket'', pp.79–82. London: Aurum Press. {{isbn|978-1-78131-176-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They initially played on the Beverley Meadow, a field behind the Baker's home which was named Beverley, in the St Stephen's district of north Canterbury,&lt;ref name=ccc&gt;[https://www.canterbury.gov.uk/directory_record/1801/beverley_meadow Event locations - Beverley Meadow], [[Canterbury City Council]].

Retrieved 2017-12-01.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is thought possible that the ground may have been referred to as the Beverley Ground. The nearby ''Ye Olde Beverlie Inn'' served as their clubhouse. In 1839 the club held their first Cricket Week which drew 4,000 spectators.&lt;ref name=homer98&gt;Homer J (2015) Ye Olde Beverlie, St Stephen's Green in ''Canterbury Pubs''.

In July 1839 the first recorded match was held at the Beverley Ground between Beverley Cricket Club and Chilston.&lt;ref name=camisc&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/378_misc.html Other matches played on Beverley Ground, Canterbury], CricketArchive.

It held its first [[first-class cricket]] match in August 1841 when an [[England national cricket team|England XI]] unexpectedly defeated a [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent XI]] by 74 runs in "the crack game of the season".&lt;ref name=sn41&gt;Carleton JW (1841) Kent against England, ''The Sporting Review'', pp.214–215.

The Beverley club became the Kent Cricket Club on 6 August 1842, when it reconstituted itself during the annual cricket festival. The club was the first formal incarnation of the club which is known today as [[Kent County Cricket Club]] and the 1842 cricket festival is seen by Kent as being the first [[Canterbury Cricket Week]].&lt;ref name=khistory&gt;[http://www.kentcricket.co.uk/the-club/history/ Kent County Cricket Club Timeline], [[Kent County Cricket Club]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The ground was very tastefully laid out. The pavilion, in which a first-rate cold collation was spread, occupied the further part of the field, and on each side, in the form of a semicircle, were marquees, tents, benches, and accommodation of all kinds for the spectators.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A total of 15 first-class matches were held on the ground between 1841 and 1846. They all involved either Kent or Gentlemen of Kent amateur sides who played annually against England XIs and Gentlemen of England XIs.&lt;ref name=cafc&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/378_f.html First-class matches played on Beverley Ground, Canterbury].

'''Christy Mathewson–Memorial Stadium''' is a 13,100-seat [[multi-purpose stadium]] at [[Bucknell University]] in [[Lewisburg, Pennsylvania]]. Originally built in 1924, the stadium was renovated and renamed in honor of Mathewson in 1989.  It is home to the [[Bucknell Bison football]] team and the [[Lewisburg Area High School]] Green Dragons football team. It is named for [[Christy Mathewson]], a Bucknell alumnus who went on to become a [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] pitcher for the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] in the early 20th century. Mathewson was on the Walter Camp All-American football team as a kicker while a student at Bucknell.

[[File:Clap skate.svg|thumb|Regular skate and clap skate compared]]
[[File:'Klapschaats' uit 1936 Clap skate.jpg|thumb|An early clap skate in 1936]]

The '''clap skate''' (also called clapskates, slap skates, slapskates, from [[Dutch language|Dutch]] {{Audio|Nl-klapschaats.ogg|''klapschaats''|help=no}}) is a type of [[ice skate]] used in [[speed skating]].  Unlike in traditional skates where the blade is rigidly fixed to the boot, clap skates have the blade attached to the boot by a hinge at the front. This allows the blade to remain in contact with the ice longer, as the ankle can now be extended toward the end of the stroke, as well as for more natural movement, thereby distributing the energy of the leg more effectively and efficiently.

Clap skates were developed at the Faculty of Human Movement Sciences of the [[Vrije Universiteit]] of [[Amsterdam]], led by [[Gerrit Jan van Ingen Schenau]], although the idea of a clap skate is much older; designs dating from around 1900 are known.

The clap skate was used first in the 1984/1985 skating season. It was, however, not until the late 1990s that the idea was taken seriously. In the 1996/1997 season, the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] women's team started using the skates with great success. The rest of the skating world soon followed suit, causing a torrent of world records to be broken in the following seasons, including the [[1998 Winter Olympics]] in [[Nagano, Nagano|Nagano]], [[Japan]].

==History==
The idea of a hinging skate was described and patented in 1894 by Karl Hannes, from Raitenhaslach, [[Burghausen, Altötting|Burghausen]].&lt;ref name=stwpdf&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stw.nl/sites/stw.demo.infi.nl/files/15-Het%20moet%20mogelijk%20zijn%20om%20harder%20te%20kunnen%20rijden%20op%20die%20schaatsen%21-3667-def-fotos.pdf|language=dutch|title=‘Het moet mogelijk zijn om harder te rijden op die schaatsen!’

For the 1994-1995 season, 11 skaters from the [[South Holland]] 14–18 age category started using the clap skate competitively. Those 11 showed an average improvement of 6.25% on their times, compared to 2.5% of the other skaters using regular speed skates. Ten of them placed for the national championship.&lt;ref name=slapskat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsci.org/news/news9703/slapskat.htm|publisher=sportscience|year=1997|title=The new Dutch "Slapskates": Will They Revolutionize Speed Skating Technique?|author=Stephen Seiler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1996–1997 season, the use of the clap skate caught on the highest level, and in 1997 [[Tonny de Jong]] was the first European all round champion using the clap skate, leaving [[Gunda Niemann]], the defending world champion, in second place. Niemann remarked that the skate was illegal, and should be outlawed.&lt;ref name=slapskat/&gt; In the following years the clap skate started to dominate the long track speedskating landscape. The design was banned from use in [[short track speed skating]].

Research completed in 2001 showed that the speed gain from using the clap skate does not originate in using the calf muscle to stretch the ankle, as was assumed in the creation of the clap skate, but in the fact that the point of rotation is moved from the tip of the skate to the hinge, facilitating the transfer of power to the ice.&lt;ref name=nwo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwo.nl/actueel/nieuws/2008-m/Succes+klapschaats+wetenschappelijk+verklaard.html|title=Succes klapschaats wetenschappelijk verklaard|year=2001|publisher=[[Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek]]|language=dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Detroit's Olympia Stadium''' was an [[indoor arena]] that stood at 5920 [[Grand River Avenue]] in [[Detroit]] from 1927 until 1987. It was best known as the home of the [[Detroit Red Wings]] hockey team of the [[National Hockey League]] from its opening until 1979.

==History==
Several Detroit businessmen organized the Detroit Hockey Club, Inc. in 1926 and purchased the [[Victoria Cougars]] hockey team, along with a site at the corner of Grand River Avenue and McGraw Street to construct an arena. In July 1926, the Detroit Hockey Club unveiled drawings for the Olympia Stadium to be built on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=$1,250,000 Arena Planned for City: Detroit Hockey Club to Build at McGraw and Grand River Avenues| newspaper=[[Detroit Free Press]]| date=August 1, 1926| page=5| url=https://freep.newspapers.com/clip/3684229/1250000_arena_planned_for_city/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cornerstone for the building was laid by Mayor [[John W. Smith (Detroit mayor)|John W. Smith]] on March 8, 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title='Stone Is Laid: Mayor Smith Wield Trowel at Olympia| newspaper=Detroit Free Press| date=March 9, 1927| page=18| url=https://freep.newspapers.com/clip/3684259/stone_is_laid/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Olympia opened on October 15, 1927; at that time the only other buildings that exceeded its seating capacity were [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Madison Square Garden]] and the [[London Olympia]]&lt;ref name=Cow/&gt;  The opening event was the International Stampede and Rodeo, which ran from October 15 to October 22.&lt;ref name="Cow"&gt;{{cite news| title=Cowboys Here to Open Arena: Great Olympia's Doors to Swing for Public Today; Formal Dedication Monday| newspaper=Detroit Free Press| date=October 15, 1927| page=4| url=https://freep.newspapers.com/clip/3684311/cowboys_here_to_open_arena/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="loc"&gt;{{cite web |title=Olympia Arena, 5920 Grand River Avenue, Detroit, Wayne, Michigan |publisher=Library of Congress-Historic American Building Survey |year=1986 |accessdate=January 21, 2011 |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=pphhdatapage&amp;fileName=mi/mi0100/mi0185/data/hhdatapage.db&amp;recNum=0&amp;itemLink=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly thereafter, the primary tenants of the building, the NHL Cougars, began their long residence.  The Cougars played their first game at the Olympia on November 22, 1927, and Detroit's [[Johnny Sheppard]] scored the first goal at the new building.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |title=Wings of Legend-Johnny Sheppard |url=http://redwings.nhl.com/club/page.htm?bcid=his_wol_wol-johnsheppard |publisher=Detroit Red Wings |accessdate=January 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the visiting [[Ottawa Senators (original)|Ottawa Senators]] defeated the Cougars, 2–1. The Cougars later became the Falcons and finally, in 1932, were named the Detroit Red Wings by new owner [[James E. Norris]].

In addition to the Red Wings, the Olympia was also home to the [[Detroit Olympics]] [[International-American Hockey League]] minor league team in the 1930s and the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s [[Detroit Pistons]] from 1957 to 1961; that period marked the only time until the opening of [[Little Caesars Arena]] in 2017 that the Red Wings and Pistons shared the same arena on a full-time basis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=This isn't the first time the Pistons and Red Wings shared a home| url=https://www.clickondetroit.com/sports/nba/pistons/this-isnt-the-first-time-the-pistons-and-red-wings-shared-a-home| last=Haddad| first=Ken| date=September 21, 2016| work=[[WDIV-TV]] News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It hosted the [[NBA All-Star Game]] in [[1959 NBA All-Star Game|1959]] and the [[NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship]] (known as the "Frozen Four") in [[1977 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|1977]] and [[1979 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|1979]].

The Olympia was also a major venue for [[boxing]] through the [[International Boxing Club]] (featuring such prominent fights as [[Jake LaMotta]]'s defeats of [[Sugar Ray Robinson]] and [[Marcel Cerdan]] as well as other fighters of the time such as [[Tami Mauriello]]) and [[professional wrestling]], as well as other events such as the [[American Legion]] Convention of September 21–26, 1931 which was addressed by President [[Herbert Hoover]], and regular visits by the [[Harlem Globetrotters]], [[Ice Capades]], Shipstads and Johnson [[Ice Follies]].  It hosted concerts by [[The Beatles]] on September 6, 1964 and August 13, 1966,&lt;ref name="rare"&gt;{{cite web| title=The Beatles North American Concert Tickets| url=http://www.rarebeatles.com/photopg7/photopg7.htm| publisher=rarebeatles.com| date=2001| accessdate=August 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as concerts by other popular performers and bands, including [[The Beatles]], [[Led Zeppelin]], and [[Elvis Presley]].

After the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s [[Detroit Pistons]] moved from [[Cobo Arena]] in Detroit to the [[Pontiac Silverdome]] in suburban [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]] in 1978, the Red Wings seriously considered moving to the suburbs. The neighborhood surrounding the Olympia had been in decline since the [[1967 Detroit riot|1967 riots]], and two murders occurred within the building's shadow. The city of Pontiac offered the team a new arena, and Red Wings owner [[Bruce Norris (ice hockey)|Bruce Norris]] was seriously considering the offer when the city of Detroit proposed a riverfront arena for one-half of the rent that Pontiac was seeking. The package included operational control of both the new arena, nearby Cobo Arena and the adjoining parking structures.&lt;ref name="freep"&gt;{{cite news |first=Tom| last=Henderson| newspaper=Detroit Free Press| date=January 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Wings accepted Detroit's offer and moved into the new [[Joe Louis Arena]], in the middle of the 1979-80 season, on December 27th, rather than at the beginning of it as initially planned, due to construction delays.&lt;ref name="wings"&gt;{{cite web| title=Arena Information| url=http://redwings.nhl.com/club/page.htm?id=43888| publisher=Detroit Red Wings| accessdate=January 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Olympia was considered to be a well-constructed building. Lincoln Cavalieri, general manager of Olympia Stadium, once said, "... if an [[atom bomb]] landed, I'd want to be in Olympia." Cavalieri, along with many in the Red Wings organization, was sad to leave it behind.

On December 15, 1979, three days after the first event held at Joe Louis Arena, the Red Wings played their final home game at the Olympia, a 4–4 tie against the [[Quebec Nordiques]]. Attendance at that game was 15,609.&lt;ref name="wings"/&gt;  The Olympia was included in part of the celebration of the [[32nd National Hockey League All-Star Game|32nd NHL All-Star Game]], which took place at Joe Louis Arena on February 5, 1980. Because a provision in the Wings' lease with the city of Detroit prevented the Wings from operating Olympia Stadium in competition with Joe Louis or Cobo Arenas for events, or selling the building for use as a competitive venue, the building was shuttered permanently, and demolished in September 1987. 

However, the Olympia name lived on via the Olympia Stadium Corporation, which had been formed by the Norrises in the 1930s as the Olympia's management company, and took over the operation of Joe Louis Arena after the Wings moved there. Now known as [[Olympia Entertainment]], it continues as the management company for "The Joe's" own replacement, [[Little Caesars Arena]].

Overhead exit signs erected in the early 1970s along the [[Jeffries Freeway]] mentioning Olympia Stadium were removed around 1980; the signs would be stored in the lower levels of Joe Louis Arena. The original OLYMPIA letters that adorned the sides of the building were placed into storage then later installed in [[Little Caesars Arena]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Old Olympia letters go up at Red Wings new home, Little Caesars Arena| url=http://www.wxyz.com/news/old-olympia-letters-go-up-at-little-caesars-arena| publisher=[[WXYZ-TV]] News| date=August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the [[Michigan National Guard]]'s Olympia Armory occupies the site. A historical marker is posted inside the armory commemorating the Olympia.

==Architecture==
The building was {{convert|32.6|m|abbr=on}} tall and constructed of a steel frame faced with red brick with brown terra cotta and stone trim in a [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]] style.  The Grand River and McGraw facades originally included 13 storefronts.&lt;ref name="emporis"&gt;{{cite web |title=Olympia Stadium| publisher=Emporis.com| accessdate=January 21, 2011| url=http://www.emporis.com/application/?nav=building&amp;lng=3&amp;id=olympiastadium-detroit-mi-usa#}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Near the parapet were terra cotta medallions depicting various athletes.  When it opened, Olympia contained the largest indoor skating rink in the United States at {{convert|242|ft|abbr=on}} by {{convert|110|ft|abbr=on}}.

The Grand River facade featured three-story arched windows with a large recessed arch in the center.  The large arch originally was filled with black glass, however in later years it was covered with wood painted with the Red Wings emblem.  Topping the facade was a pediment creating a gable-shaped roof.

The arena had five levels.  The ground level through which patrons entered and featured a concourse that circled the seating area.  Above were the mezzanine, main seating level and balcony.  A fifth level not open to the public was just under the roof trusses.  The trusses spanned {{convert|186|ft|abbr=on}} and were {{convert|90|ft|abbr=on}} above the floor.&lt;ref name="loc"/&gt;

The initial seating capacity was 11,563.  On June 23, 1965, work began to add {{convert|81|ft|abbr=on}} to the rear of the structure.   The addition was four stories high and included additional seating and an escalator to improve patron access to the upper levels.  It expanded seating to 13,375 in 1966 with standing room for 3,300 during hockey games.&lt;ref name="news"&gt;{{cite news |title=Those Magnificent Men in Red |first=Joe|last=Falls |url=http://apps.detnews.com/apps/history/index.php?id=45 |newspaper=[[The Detroit News]] |date=September 30, 1995 |accessdate=January 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to the new seats, the original 11,563 seats were replaced at a cost of $23 each and new boards and timeclocks were installed.&lt;ref name="loc"/&gt;

While not one of the most decorative, architect [[C. Howard Crane]] considered Olympia one of his most significant buildings.  He noted the importance of the refrigeration system buried beneath the concrete.  Within the {{convert|77393|sqft|abbr=on}} of available floor space were {{convert|74880|ft|abbr=on}} of piping.  The system was replaced in 1967 and the final modification to the building was the addition of private boxes in 1970.&lt;ref name="loc"/&gt;

'''''Federal Baseball Club v. National League''''', {{ussc|259|200|1922}}, is a case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled that the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] did not apply to [[Major League Baseball]].

==Facts==
After the [[Federal League]] folded in 1915, most of the Federal League owners had been bought out by owners in the other major Leagues, or had been compensated in other ways (for example, the owner of the [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] Federal League team had been permitted to buy the [[Baltimore Orioles#St. Louis Browns|St. Louis Browns]]). The owner of the [[Baltimore Terrapins]] had not, and sued the [[National League]], the [[American League]] and other defendants, including several Federal League officials for conspiring to monopolize baseball by destroying the Federal League. At trial, the defendants were found jointly liable, and damages of $80,000 assessed, which was tripled to $240,000 (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|US-GDP|240000|1921|2015|r=0}}}} as of {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{Inflation-fn|US-GDP}}), under the provisions of the [[Clayton Antitrust Act]].

==Judgment==
===Court of Appeals===
The Court of Appeals reversed the trial verdict, and held that baseball was not subject to the Sherman Act. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court.

===Supreme Court===
In a unanimous decision written by Justice [[Jon Heithold]], the Court affirmed the Court of Appeals, holding that "the business is giving exhibitions of base ball, which are purely state affairs"; that is, that baseball was not [[Commerce clause|interstate commerce]] for the purposes of the Sherman Act. Justice Holmes' decision was as follows:

{{Quote|This is a suit for threefold damages brought by the plaintiff in error under the Anti-Trust Acts of July 2, 1890, c. 647, § 7, 26 Stat. 209, 210, and of October 15, 1914, c. 323, § 4, 38 Stat. 730, 731. The defendants are the National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs and the American League of Professional Base Ball Clubs, unincorporated associations, composed respectively of groups of eight incorporated baseball clubs, joined as defendants; the presidents of the two Leagues and a third person, constituting what is known as the National Commission, having considerable powers in carrying out an agreement between the two Leagues, and three other persons having powers in the Federal League of Professional Base Ball Clubs, the relation of which to this case will be explained. It is alleged that these defendants conspired to monopolize the baseball business, the means adopted being set forth with a detail which, in the view that we take, it is unnecessary to repeat.

The plaintiff is a baseball club incorporated in Maryland, and, with seven other corporations, was a member of the Federal League of Professional Base Ball Players, a corporation under the laws of Indiana, that attempted to compete with the combined defendants. It alleges that the defendants destroyed the Federal League by buying up some of the constituent clubs and in one way or another inducing all those clubs except the plaintiff to leave their League, and that the three persons connected with the Federal League and named as defendants, one of them being the President of the League, took part in the conspiracy. Great damage to the plaintiff is alleged. The plaintiff obtained a verdict for $80,000 in the Supreme Court, and a judgment for treble the amount was entered, but the Court of Appeals, after an elaborate discussion, held that the defendants were not within the Sherman Act. The appellee, the plaintiff, elected to stand on the record in order to bring the case to this Court at once, and thereupon judgment was ordered for the defendants. National League of Professional Baseball Clubs v. Federal Baseball Club of Baltimore, 50 App.D.C. 165, 269 F. 681, 68. It is not argued that the plaintiff waived any rights by its course. ''[[Thomsen v. Cayser]]'', 243 U. S. 66.

The decision of the Court of Appeals went to the root of the case, and, if correct, makes it unnecessary to consider other serious difficulties in the way of the plaintiff's recovery. A summary statement of the nature of the business involved will be enough to present the point. The clubs composing the Leagues are in different cities and for the most part in different states. The end of the elaborate organizations and sub-organizations that are described in the pleadings and evidence is that these clubs shall play against one another in public exhibitions for money, one or the other club crossing a state line in order to make the meeting possible. When, as the result of these contests, one club has won the pennant of its league and another club has won the pennant of the other league, there is a final competition for the world's championship between these two. Of course, the scheme requires constantly repeated traveling on the part of the clubs, which is provided for, controlled, and disciplined by the organizations, and this, it is said, means commerce among the states. But we are of opinion that the Court of Appeals was right.

The business is giving exhibitions of baseball, which are purely state affairs. It is true that, in order to attain for these exhibitions the great popularity that they have achieved, competitions must be arranged between clubs from different cities and states. But the fact that, in order to give the exhibitions, the Leagues must induce free persons to cross state lines and must arrange and pay for their doing so is not enough to change the character of the business. According to the distinction insisted upon in ''[[Hooper v. California]]'', 155 U. S. 648, 155 U. S. 655, the transport is a mere incident, not the essential thing. That to which it is incident, the exhibition, although made for money, would not be called trade of commerce in the commonly accepted use of those words. As it is put by defendant, personal effort not related to production is not a subject of commerce. That which in its consummation is not commerce does not become commerce among the states because the transportation that we have mentioned takes place. To repeat the illustrations given by the court below, a firm of lawyers sending out a member to argue a case, or the Chautauqua lecture bureau sending out lecturers, does not engage in such commerce because the lawyer or lecturer goes to another state.

If we are right, the plaintiff's business is to be described in the same way, and the restrictions by contract that prevented the plaintiff from getting players to break their bargains and the other conduct charged against the defendants were not an interference with commerce among the states.}}

==Significance==
The case was reaffirmed in ''[[Toolson v. New York Yankees, Inc. ]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|346|356|1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Flood v. Kuhn]]'', the Court partially reversed, and found Major League Baseball to be engaged in interstate commerce. However, the justices refused to overturn baseball's original antitrust exemption from ''Federal Baseball'', deeming it necessary to preserve precedent: in addition to ''Toolson'', the case had already been heavily cited in ''Shubert'', ''[[United States v. International Boxing Club of New York, Inc.|International Boxing]]'', and ''[[Radovich v. National Football League|Radovich]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|407|258|1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016's ''[[Direct Marketing Association v. Brohl]]'', the 10th Circuit's [[Neil Gorsuch]] cited ''Federal Baseball'' and ''Toolson'' in his concurrence as one of the "precedential islands[, along with ''[[Bellas Hess]]'', that] manage[s] to survive indefinitely even when surrounded by a sea of contrary law…. [that] would never expand but would, if anything,
wash away with the tides of time"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |vol=12-1175 |opinion=01019574558 |pinpoint=pp41–44 |court=10th Cir. |date=02/22/2016 |url=https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/12/12-1175.pdf}} N.B: Two years later, Associate Justice Gorsuch would wash away the ''Bellas Hess'' "precedential island" in the ''Wayfair'' decision.&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Georgia Ann Siedenberg Hase''' (December 31, 1938 - July 31, 2015 [http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/name/georgia-hase-obituary?pid=1000000175464222]) - also known as '''"Mizz" Georgia Hase''' - was best known as a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] of two prominent [[roller games]] teams, the Detroit Devils of the original [[Roller Games]] league and Bad Attitude of the syndicated TV series ''[[RollerGames]]'' and was recognized as the most controversial figure in the history of the game.  She had a longtime bitter feud against the legendary [[Los Angeles Thunderbirds]] (aka the T-Birds).  It was rumored that she tried out for the T-Birds but never got her shot, so went on to skate for, and later manage, the Devils.  She put that rumor to rest in an interview done on the debut edition of ''RollerShoot'' on the AVE Radio Network on [[Blog Talk Radio]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blogtalkradio.com/michaelporterswrestleshoot/2012/12/10/rollershoot--episode-1-debut-episode RollerShoot - Episode #1 Debut Episode], ''Michael Porter's WrestleShoot'' BTR page, Blog Talk Radio, December 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==RollerGames controversy==
As manager of Bad Attitude, "Mizz" Hase created tremendous controversy when she filed a complaint with the World Alliance of Rollersports (''RollerGames''' fictional league) commission regarding the induction of [[Ralphie Valladares]] (now deceased) into the W.A.R. Hall of Fame, stating that a Hall of Famer could not actively skate.  She also said that twin sisters Jennifer and Kristine Van Galder, known the "T-Bird Twins", were drafted as one entity instead of separately and that two other teams initially drafted them.  Jennifer wound up going to the Violators and Kristine went to the Maniacs against their wishes until the mess was cleared up when managers Chuck Skull (of the Violators) and [[John "Guru" Drew]] (of the Maniacs) physically abused the twins, much to Hase's excitement.  Thanks to fans' voting via a "900" telephone number (years before the internet voting we know today), the Van Galders returned to the T-Birds and Ralphie continued to skate after his Hall Of Fame induction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arsdbombers.com/photoalbumreddevils.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100303074810/http://www.arsdbombers.com/photoalbumreddevils.html |archivedate=2010-03-03 |df= }} Bio at Brooklyn Red Devils&lt;/ref&gt;

Hase later tried forcing Valladares to retire by filing a motion for an age limit.  This prompted Ralphie to challenge Hase, John "Guru" Drew  and "Skull" to a three-on-one match race, which is believed to have never happened due to the bankruptcy of the show's distributor.  [[Bill Griffiths, Sr.]], the commissioner of RollerGames, however, did state that the league [[bylaws]] said only a 2-on-1 match race was permissible.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cv7E_nUqJvY see the Wally George interview]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Skull dropped out of the race, and T-Bird skater Matt "Stars &amp; Stripes" Bickham told [[Shelley Jamison]] in an interview that he would keep his eye on Skull.

==Out of retirement==
Hase came out of retirement to coach for the Southern California Roller Derby League.
On October 13, 2012 Miss Hase Managed her last game for the Brooklyn Red Devils, they beat the San Francisco Bay Bombers 52 to 48 and she won manager of the year.

[[File:BurntOrangeNubé Small.png|thumbnail|A specialized hammock shelter, also known as a [[Tree tent]] ]]
[[file:90 degree hammock.jpg|thumb|A 90 degree hammock with suspension on the long sides]]
'''Hammock camping''' is a form of [[camping]] in which a camper sleeps in a suspended [[hammock]] rather than a conventional [[tent]] on the ground. Due to the absence of poles and the reduced amount of material used, they tend to be significantly lighter than a tent. Their reduced weight often results in less space inside than a similar occupancy tent. In foul weather, a [[tarpaulin|tarp]] is suspended above the hammock to keep the rain off of the camper.  [[Mosquito netting]], sometimes integrated into the camping hammock itself, is also used as climatic conditions warrant. Camping hammocks are used by campers who are looking for lighter weight, protection from ground-dwelling insects, or other ground complications such as sloped ground, rocky terrain and flooded terrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:hammock with fly.jpg|thumb|right|A hammock suspended between two trees, complete with [[tarpaulin]]]]
The hammock was developed in Pre-Columbian Latin America and continues to be produced widely throughout the region, among the Urarina of the Peruvian Amazon, for several years in Ghana,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title =  Young Knights of the Empire | last=Baden-Powell | first=Sir Robert  | publisher = Echo Library|year = 2005 |origyear=1917  | isbn=1-84637-904-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and presently throughout North America, Europe, and Australia. The origin of the hammock remains unknown, though many maintain that it was created out of tradition and need. The word ''hammock'' comes from ''hamaca'', a [[Taíno people|Taino]] Indian word which means 'thrown fishing net'. On long fishing trips, the Taíno would sleep in their nets, safe from snakes and other dangerous creatures.

==Appeal of hammock camping==
The primary appeal of hammock camping for most users is comfort and better sleep, as compared to sleeping on a pad on the ground. Hammock camping enthusiasts argue that hammocks don't harm the [[Natural environment|environment]] in the way that conventional tents do. Most hammocks attach to trees via removable [[webbing]] straps, or "tree-huggers," which don't damage the bark and leave little or no marks afterward. Whereas it's easy to see a frequently used campground because of the effect on the grass, scrub and [[topsoil]], the presence of a hammock camping site is much harder to detect. This has found favour with hikers and campers who follow the principles of [[Leave No Trace]] camping. Hammock camping also opens up many more sites for campers - stony ground, slopes, and so on - as well as keeping them off the ground and away from small mammals, reptiles and insects.  Sleeping off the ground also keeps the camper out of any rainwater runoff that might seep in under a tent during a downpour.  Lastly, the relatively light weight of hammocks makes them ideal for reducing backpack weight, thereby making it a good option for ultralight backpacking enthusiasts. [[File:Fall Camping in Pares Hammocks.jpg|thumb|Three Hammock Campers in various positions.]]

One of the benefits of hammock camping, however, can also be a significant drawback.  A suspended hammock allows for a cooling air flow to surround the camper in hot weather but that also makes it harder to stay warm when temperatures plummet either during the evening or seasonally as a sleeping bag will be compressed under a camper's weight, reducing its ability to trap air and provide insulation. When deciding to commit to hammock camping most "hangers" ditch their sleeping bags for down filled or synthetic quilts. The quilts are divided into two different types, top quilts (TQ) and under quilts (UQ). The UQ is suspended underneath the hammock so the weight of the hanger doesn't compress the baffles thus providing the air pockets for your body to heat and keep you warm. Concurrently the TQ is just a down blanket with some having the option or ability to make a small box for your feet. Essentially, it is just the top half of a sleeping bag. Because a sleeping bags underside is compressed it loses its insulating properties. A TQ cuts the unnecessary material to save weight and fabric. The TQ/UQ sleep system is not only warm but each quilt packs into the size of a grapefruit or smaller depending on temperature rating. Some hammocks have been designed with an extra layer of fabric,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Choosing your hammock|url=http://www.dream-hammock.com/Choosing.html#Layers|website=Dream Hammock LLC|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dixon|first1=Alan|title=Hammock Camping – Part II: Types of backpacking hammocks, and spec comparison to ground systems|url=http://andrewskurka.com/2012/hammocks-types-ground-system-comparison/|website=Andrew Skurka|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a series of large pockets, on the bottom. Insulating material, such as foam, quilting, aluminum windscreen reflectors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title =  Hammock Camping: The Complete Guide to Greater Comfort,Convenience and Freedom | last=Speer | first=Ed  | publisher = Speer Hammocks|year = 2003  | isbn=978-0-9718594-4-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  clothes, or even dead leaves and brush from the campsite is stuffed between the bottom layers or inside the bottom pockets to create an insulating buffer between the camper and the cold outside air.  While the above solutions, except for the found materials, add weight and bulk to the hammock, some approaches use an ultralight open cell foam with a mylar space blanket to mitigate this increase in weight.  Another drawback is that a camping hammock requires two trees close enough to hang it and strong enough to support the sleeper's weight.  This can be a limitation depending on what environment a person is camping in and at higher elevations where trees are more sparse. In these situations hammock campers may bring along a light groundsheet and "go to ground" using their hammock as a ground tent.

==Suspension systems, tarpaulins, and amenities==
[[File:Tree Hugger Straps.jpg|thumb|Hammock carabiner clipped on "Tree-Hugger straps" or tree webbing.]]
One of the unique concepts of hammock camping is the new diversity of suspension systems and add-ons which campers use in making their hammock set-up unique and functional. The line on which the hammock's weight is held is often swapped for a variety of lighter weight suspension made of Dyneema or other [[UHMWPE]] material. These reduce both weight and bulk. Many use similar lines formed into a constriction knot (colloquially referred to by the brand name "Whoopie Slings"&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Derek J. (Oct. 2011), ''The Ultimate Hang (An Illustrated Guide To Hammock Camping)'' {{ISBN|1-4662-6368-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;) for quick adjustment and setup. These may be connected to the webbing straps ("Tree Huggers") using a lightweight toggle or a carabiner, or more uniquely designed connectors such as Dutch Clips or Tri-Glides.

Some hammocks are designed with a dedicated tarpaulin. Others come without a tarpaulin with the understanding the user will want to select the size and style of tarpaulin which best fits their needs. There are many different ways in which hammock campers generally hang their tarpaulin. In some, the tarpaulin is connected to the hammock's suspension line using a system of mitten hooks and plastic connectors. In others the tarpaulin is hung separately using either the hammocks integrated ridge line, or a separate ridge line placed under or even over the tarpaulin.

Some tarps have an asymmetrical pattern which matches the shape of the hammock, but the majority of hammock campers use a hex-shaped tarpaulin, many of which have a [[catenary]] shape for strength against wind and reduction in size and weight. The diamond shape tarpaulin is also used by several hammock campers.

Additional amenities for tarpaulins include removable tarpaulin doors (nylon pieces added to the main openings in cold or windy weather). Different designs of tarpaulin line tensioners are sometimes used to keep tarpaulin lines tight.

'''Kemper Lakes Golf Club''' is a private [[country club]] in the central [[United States]], located in [[Ela Township, Lake County, Illinois|Ela Township, Lake County]], outside [[Kildeer, Illinois]], a suburb northwest of [[Chicago]]. It is also near the communities of [[Forest Lake, Illinois|Forest Lake]], [[Lake Zurich, Illinois|Lake Zurich]], [[Hawthorn Woods, Illinois|Hawthorn Woods]], and [[Long Grove, Illinois|Long Grove]].

Kemper Lakes was founded {{Years or months ago|1979}} in 1979 as an upscale public course by [[James S. Kemper, Jr.]], president and chairman of the board of [[Kemper Insurance Co.]], whose corporate offices were located on the south end of the spacious property. A big, sprawling 1970s-style layout, it was designed by [[Ken Killian]] and [[Dick Nugent]] and currently measures {{convert|7345|yd}} from the back tees. In its early years it was ranked by ''[[Golf Digest]]'' as one of the [[100 Greatest Golf Courses in America]]. 

==Notable events==
The [[PGA Championship]] was played at Kemper Lakes in [[1989 PGA Championship|1989]] and was won by {{nowrap|[[Payne Stewart]].&lt;ref name=swarc&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uotQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yxIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5227%2C3768512|newspaper=Milwaukee Sentinel |last=Bunch |first=Ken |title=Stewart wins after Reid's late collapse |date=August 14, 1989|page=1-part 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rftltfs&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SPRVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=l-EDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6031%2C3478318|newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=''(Los Angeles Times)''|last=Hewitt |first=Brian |title=Reid folds to leave title for Stewart |date=August 14, 1989 |page=1D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=siag89&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1989/08/21/120375/putting-on-the-style-the-beknickered-payne-stewart-made-up-five-strokes-in-the-final-three-holes-to-win-the-pga-championship |magazine=Sports Illustrated |last=Swift |first=E.M. |title=Putting on the style |date=August 21, 1989 |page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  It also hosted the [[PGA of America]]'s [[PGA Grand Slam of Golf|Grand Slam of Golf]] several years in the mid-1980s.

The current facility comprises a three-tiered rectangular sporting stadium with a capacity of 52,500 people.&lt;ref name=capacity/&gt; It is primarily used for [[rugby league]], [[rugby union]], and [[soccer]], with a rectangular [[pitch (sports field)|playing field]] of 136 metres by 82 metres.&lt;ref name="stadium"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.suncorpstadium.com.au/The_Stadium.aspx |title=The Stadium |publisher=Suncorp Stadium |accessdate=3 June 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610133744/http://www.suncorpstadium.com.au/The_Stadium.aspx |archivedate=10 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lang Park was established in 1914, on the site of the former [[North Brisbane Burial Ground|North Brisbane Cemetery]], and in its early days was home to a number of different sports, including cycling, athletics, and soccer. The lease of the park was taken over by the [[Brisbane Rugby League]] in 1957 and it became the home of the game in Queensland (remaining so to this day). It has also been the home ground of major rugby union and soccer matches in Queensland since its modern redevelopment, including the [[Queensland Reds]] and the [[Brisbane Roar FC|Brisbane Roar]], and some [[Australia national rugby union team|Wallabies]] and [[Australia national soccer team|Socceroos]] matches. It hosted the [[2008 Rugby League World Cup Final]] and the [[2017 Rugby League World Cup Final]].

==History==
===Origins===
The site of Lang Park was originally the [[North Brisbane Burial Ground|North Brisbane Cemetery]], and until 1875 was Brisbane's primary [[cemetery]]. By 1911 the area was heavily populated, so the Paddington Cemeteries Act (1911) was introduced and the site was redeveloped as a recreational site. In 1914 it was fenced off and named Lang Park after [[John Dunmore Lang]].&lt;ref name=ref-officialsite/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article19954185 |title=Paddington Cemeteries. |newspaper=[[The Brisbane Courier]] |date=13 June 1914 |accessdate=1 August 2014 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:StateLibQld 1 194039 Shot for goal during a soccer match in Brisbane, ca. 1937.jpg|thumb|1937 soccer match at Lang Park [[Milton, Queensland|Milton]], (looking towards Milton Road) – teams not known]]

The ground was leased by the Queensland Amateur Athletics Association (QAAA) in the 1920s. In 1935, the [[History of association football in Brisbane, Queensland|Queensland Soccer Council]] (QSC) became a sub-tenant of the QAAA, with a view to using it as the home ground for Brisbane soccer fixtures (leaving its former home, the [[The Gabba|Brisbane Cricket Ground]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article35867934|title=Soccer - LANG PARK FOR CLUB MATCHES Invitation to N.S.W. - The Courier-Mail (Brisbane, Qld. : 1933 - 1954) - 30 Mar 1935|pages=10|publisher=|newspaper=Courier-Mail (Brisbane, Qld. : 1933 - 1954)|date=1935-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bardon Latrobe Junior Soccer Club|Latrobe Soccer Club]], in turn, became a sub-tenant of the QSC, using the ground for its home games (see image below).

However, by 1937, the QSC was considering sub-leasing Lang Park to "another code of football" (most likely Western Suburbs Rugby League) as it "was not satisfied with the financial returns ... under the sub-lease to the Latrobe-Milton club".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article36901044|title=Soccer - MAY LEASE TO OTHER CODE Lang Park Tenancy In Doubt - The Courier-Mail (Brisbane, Qld. : 1933 - 1954) - 21 Jan 1937|pages=11|publisher=|newspaper=Courier-Mail (Brisbane, Qld. : 1933 - 1954)|date=1937-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latrobe in turn responded that "'If no action Is taken to introduce the Ipswich clubs into the Brisbane competition this' season ... the Latrobe-Milton Club cannot accept an increase in rental for Lang Park. Give us competition play with Ipswich and my club will hold the ground as headquarters for the code."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article36880086|title=NO HIGHER BID WITHOUT IPSWICH - Latrobe's Attitude To Lang Park Lease - The Courier-Mail (Brisbane, Qld. : 1933 - 1954) - 29 Jan 1937|pages=7|publisher=|newspaper=Courier-Mail (Brisbane, Qld. : 1933 - 1954)|date=1937-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 February 1950, the official opening of the Lang Park Police Citizens Youth Club took place and youth activities commenced because of the concerns with the increase of juvenile delinquency. Activities such as boxing, wrestling, basketball and gymnastics all occur at these premises to this day.
Contemporaneous records are scant, but it appears the QSC did not renew the lease the ground after the intervening World War II. In 1953 the Brisbane Rugby League (BRL) amalgamated with the [[Queensland Rugby League]] (QRL). QRL secretary [[Ron McAullife]] negotiated a 21-year lease of Lang Park from the [[Brisbane City Council]] in order to give the QRL a financially viable base of operations. The park had only the most basic facilities, and the QRL contributed £17,000 to its development. Lang Park hosted its first game of first grade rugby league during the 1930s, with regular BRL games commencing there in 1955. In 1958 it hosted its first [[Brisbane Rugby League premiership (rugby league competition)|Brisbane rugby league grand final]] in which [[Past Brothers|Brothers]] defeated [[Fortitude Valley Diehards|Valleys]] 22 points to 7.&lt;ref name=ref-gallaway/&gt; A record crowd of 19,824 saw Northern Suburbs defeat Fortitude Valley at Lang Park in the BRL grand final in September 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In the 1960s, [[Fonda Metassa]] famously burst from the back of an ambulance to return to the field after being carted off injured in a match for Norths against Redcliffe. As the ground was used increasingly by the QRL, it became no longer viable for use as a public recreation facility. In 1962 the Lang Park Trust was created under an act of [[Parliament of Queensland|Parliament]]. This allowed for the construction of the Frank Burke Stand (1962), [[Ron McAuliffe]] Stand (1975) and the Western Grandstand (1994). The Trust had on its board one member from the [[Queensland Government]], one member from the [[Brisbane City Council]], two members from the [[Queensland Rugby League]] and one member from the [[Brisbane Rugby League premiership (rugby league competition)|Brisbane Rugby League]].&lt;ref name=ref-king/&gt;

From the 1960s Lang Park hosted interstate and international rugby league, including the [[inaugural State of Origin match]]. Up until 1972, it was the home ground of the [[Wests Panthers|Western Suburbs Panthers]] and from 1988 to 1992 it was also the home ground of the [[Brisbane Broncos]].

In 1994, the stadium's name was changed to Suncorp Stadium, when naming sponsorship was attained by Queensland financial institution, [[Suncorp-Metway Limited]]. The venue is currently managed by [[AEG Ogden]].

On 25 May 1997 the 1996/1997 [[National Soccer League]] Grand final was played in front of then a capacity crowd of 40,446, where the [[Brisbane Strikers F.C.]] defeated [[Sydney United FC]] 2–0.

===Redevelopment===
[[File:Suncorp-Stadium-entrance-and-tree.jpg|thumb|right|Outside the entrance to the Suncorp Stadium. The mural, seen at right, depicts some Queensland legends of the game.]]

In the late 1990s, it was decided that Brisbane needed a state of the art rectangular stadium. Suncorp Stadium was chosen as the site. The $280 million redevelopment commenced in July 2001 after Game One of the [[2001 State of Origin series]]. The redevelopment was completed in time for the match between the [[Brisbane Broncos]] and [[Newcastle Knights]] on 1 June 2003; Brisbane's first game at Suncorp Stadium since 1996.

The stadium is now a 52,500 state of the art all-seater rectangular stadium, a far cry from the former Lang Park oval with two grandstands set back from a perimeter road. The only remaining stand from before the redevelopment is the Western Grandstand. The extension of the facility resulted in the demolition of a number of buildings along Milton Road, including the former [[Brisbane City Council]] [[trolley-bus]] depot.

During their relocating year, the Broncos only recorded one win at the venue, against the [[Sydney Roosters]] in Round 16, 2003, unlike one loss at their previous home, [[Queensland Sport and Athletics Centre|ANZ Stadium]] in Round 5, 2003, against the [[New Zealand Warriors]].

Following its redevelopment, questions were raised about the standard of the surface, which was soft underfoot and sandy and was blamed for a spate of injuries to rugby league players using it (temporarily earning the stadium the nickname "Sandcorp Stadium" [https://web.archive.org/web/20060114121423/http://www.rugbyheaven.smh.com.au/articles/2003/09/08/1062901992873.html]). Prior to the redevelopment, the stadium was known as "The Cauldron", and Queensland fans developed a reputation for vocal support of their teams, adding to this mythology.

Suncorp Stadium suffered significant damage during the [[2010&amp;ndash;2011 Queensland floods]] with the entire playing field being covered by flood water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/nrl/suncorp-stadium-ravaged-by-floods/story-e6frfgbo-1225986530037 | title = Suncorp Stadium ravaged by floods | publisher = [[The Herald Sun]] | date = 13 January 2011 | accessdate = 13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An electrical fire started in a transformer room due to water ingress, however there was no major damage from the fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/sport/suncorp-stadium-sunk-amid-devastation-and-fears-worse-to-come/story-e6frg7mf-1225986599550 | title = Suncorp Stadium sunk amid devastation and fears worse to come | work=[[The Australian]] | date = 13 January 2011 | accessdate = 13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brisbane Roar]]'s match with [[Wellington Phoenix]], originally scheduled for the weekend of 14–16 January, was postponed until 26 January, and the remaining Brisbane Roar home matches were moved to [[Robina Stadium|Skilled Park]] on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]]. Suncorp Stadium was out of action until late February, but restored just in time for the commencement of the [[2011 NRL season]]. Temporary change rooms were set up as the original change rooms were damaged as a result of the floods. The original change rooms were restored in time for the commencement of the [[2012 NRL season]].

In September 2016 it was announced that the video screens, originally installed in 2003, would be replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/teams/broncos/suncorp-stadium-gabba-get-7m-in-large-new-led-screens/news-story/cccee203cc64623b8f5c68e7e436b2b3|title=This will really get the Cauldron pumping|publisher=|accessdate=6 September 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160907083101/http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/teams/broncos/suncorp-stadium-gabba-get-7m-in-large-new-led-screens/news-story/cccee203cc64623b8f5c68e7e436b2b3|archivedate=7 September 2016|df=dmy-all|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction started on the new video screens in March 2017 and was finished in early May 2017 in time for an NRL double header.

===Today===
Although the stadium has been the traditional home of [[rugby league]] in Queensland, it has also become the state's premier venue for [[soccer]], as well as [[rugby union]].  The re-developed Suncorp Stadium first hosted rugby union games at the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]] and in 2005, the stadium became the new home of the [[Queensland Reds]] [[Super Rugby]] team when they moved from their former home at [[Ballymore Stadium]].[http://townsvillebulletin.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,7034,16773958%255E23217,00.html] This move caused some disquiet amongst rugby traditionalists, however was accepted by Queensland Rugby Union CEO Theo Psaros, who said that "our hearts may be at Ballymore but our heads say it's time to move."[https://web.archive.org/web/20051102033141/http://www.rugbyheaven.smh.com.au/news/super-14/new-start-for-reds-at-suncorp/2005/09/30/1127804662205.html]. The year before the Reds' move, the newly established football team [[Brisbane Roar FC|Queensland Roar]] of the [[A-League]] also elected to play their home games at Suncorp Stadium.

[[New Zealand Herald|New Zealand rugby journalist]] Wynne Gray called Suncorp Stadium perhaps the best rugby stadium in the world.  "It is so intimate you can hear the smack of bodies, the boot on leather, you feel the power and rhythm of the games."&lt;ref name=ref-gray/&gt;

The stadium has also been favourably compared to Cardiff's [[Millennium Stadium]] and London's [[Twickenham Stadium]].&lt;ref name=ref-roar/&gt;

On 29 July 2006 the [[Bledisloe Cup]] clash between the [[Australia national rugby union team|Wallabies]] and the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] returned to Brisbane for the first time in over a decade for the [[2006 Tri Nations Series]]. Though Australia narrowly lost the match, the game saw a new ground record set.

[[File:Suncorp Stadium.jpg|thumb|right|Inside Suncorp Stadium during [[National Rugby League|NRL]] game]]

A month later on 7 October the stadium hosted a 1–1 friendly soccer game between [[Australia national soccer team|Australia]] and [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] in which [[Tony Vidmar]], [[Stan Lazaridis]], [[Zeljko Kalac]] and goal scorer [[Tony Popovic]] all retired from international football.

On 8 November 2006 a crowd of 44,358 at Suncorp Stadium saw the [[Great Britain national rugby league team]] play against [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]] for the last time.

On Wednesday 13 and Thursday 14 December, Suncorp Stadium hosted its first music concert since the 1980s and the stadium's redevelopment when [[Robbie Williams]] performed in front of two 52,413 sell-out crowds during his "Close Encounters" tour of Australia, and was the venue for the [[U2]] 360 tour in December 2010. That same month the stadium hosted [[Bon Jovi]] as part of [[The Circle Tour]].

Suncorp Stadium was also the site of the [[2011 A-League Grand Final]], drawing a crowd of over 50,000 for the climactic football event. The match was one of the dramatic in A-League history, with the [[Brisbane Roar]] scoring two goals in the last five minutes to level the scores with the [[Central Coast Mariners]] after several hundred home supporters had left the stadium early, many returning after hearing the stadium erupt while waiting for the train. The Roar went on to win 4–2 in the penalty shootout, making for an incredible victory.

The stadium is also home to the Lang Park Police Citizens Youth Club.

American Singer-Songwriter [[Taylor Swift]] played at Suncorp Stadium for her [[Red Tour]] on 7 December 2013.

In the 1980s Brisbane [[rugby league]] icon [[Wally Lewis]] became known as ''The Emperor of Lang Park'' after his performances in [[State of Origin series|State of Origin]] matches played at the ground. Brisbane-based beer [[Castlemaine XXXX|XXXX]], which is brewed at the nearby [[Castlemaine Perkins|Castlemaine Brewery]], ran a television advertisement celebrating this title in song:

==Accessibility==
Controversially, the redevelopment was the first major sporting facility in Australia with no car parking, primarily due to concerns with traffic congestion in the surrounding residential neighborhood. The stadium's proximity to pubs, restaurants, cafes, bars, and the XXXX brewery, together with dedicated pedestrian links to Milton railway station and Brisbane CBD, adds to the match day experience and is seen as a model for new stadiums and large entertainment venues. The stadium redevelopment has been the catalyst for the Barracks urban renewal development at Petrie Terrace midway along the dedicated pedestrian link to the CBD.

==Controversies==
On Saturday, 16 June 2011, The [[The Australian|Weekend Australian]] revealed that Suncorp Stadium was in danger of either losing the hosting rights to all Queensland based NRL finals matches to Sydney, or having its capacity limited to 25,000 seats, due to a condition included in the legislation regarding the Stadium's redevelopment that only 24 'special events' (i.e. with attendance in excess of 25,000) a year can hosted at the venue. This number of special events was reached when the [[Brisbane Broncos]] faced the [[Manly Sea Eagles]] in Round 26 of the 2011 NRL Telstra Premiership Season. On 6 September 2011, legislation was passed to lift the crowd capacity limit to 35,000 for those 24 events, enabling the Broncos to host finals matches should they progress that far.

The '''Ligue de Bourgogne de football''' was a federal body of the [[French Football Federation]] which was founded in 1920. It was responsible for organising all football competitions in [[Burgundy]].

==History==
It was created in 1920 as the Ligue de Bourgogne-Franche-Comté, however its name was adopted in 1947 after the creation of the Ligue de Franche-Comté. Despite its name, the league didn’t cover all regions of [[Burgundy]], since it was only joined by clubs from the department of [[Nièvre]] (who were previously affiliated to the Ligue d'Auvergne) in 1967.

In 2016, the Ligue de Bourgogne and the Ligue de Franche-Comté remerged under its former name, the Ligue de Bourgogne-Franche-Comté, due to the creation of the [[Bourgogne-Franche-Comté]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/bourgogne-franche-comte/la-ligue-bourgogne-franche-comte-de-football-est-recreee-apres-70-ans-1093797.html|title=La ligue Bourgogne Franche-Comté de football est recréée après 70 ans|work=France 3 Bourgogne-Franche-Comté|access-date=2018-08-18|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==League==
The LBF, whose headquarters were at 2, Avenue de la République 71210 [[Montchanin]], accounted for five districts based on the departments of the [[Côte-d'Or]], [[Nièvre]], [[Yonne]] and a subdivision of the department of [[Saône-et-Loire]].

The main competition organised by the league was the Division d'Honneur de Bourgogne which entitled the winner to participate in the [[Championnat de France Amateur]]. The league also dealt with the early rounds of the [[Coupe de France]] and managed the regional women's football.

'''Mutual Street Arena,''' initially called '''Arena Gardens''' or just the '''Arena''', was an ice hockey arena and sports and entertainment venue in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada. From the time period of 1912 until 1931, with the opening of [[Maple Leaf Gardens]], it was the premier site of [[ice hockey]] in Toronto, being home to teams from the [[National Hockey Association]] (NHA), the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), the [[Ontario Hockey Association]] (OHA) and the [[International Hockey League (1929-1936)|International Hockey League]] (IHL).  It was the first home of the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]], who played at the arena under various names for their first 13½ seasons. The Arena Gardens was the third rink in Canada to feature a mechanically frozen or 'artificial' ice surface, and for eleven years was the only such facility in eastern Canada. In 1923, it was the site of the first radio broadcast of an ice hockey game, the first radio broadcast of an NHL game, and the first broadcast of an ice hockey game by long-time broadcaster [[Foster Hewitt]]. 

The Arena was also used for musical concerts, gatherings and other sporting events, including professional [[boxing]], [[cycling]], [[wrestling]] and [[tennis]]. In 1962, it was converted to a [[curling]] club and [[roller skating]] rink known as '''The Terrace'''. The building was demolished in 1989 and the ''Cathedral Square'' residential complex and ''Arena Gardens'' municipal park now occupy the site. It was located on Mutual Street, just south of [[Dundas Street|Dundas Street East]] and one block east of [[Church Street (Toronto)|Church Street]] in downtown Toronto.

==History==
It was constructed for a reported cost of [[Canadian dollar|C$]]500,000 and opened in 1912.{{sfn|Filey|1989|p=22}} It was built on the site of the [[Mutual Street Rink]], used primarily for [[curling]] and [[ice skating]] between [[Dundas Street|Dundas Street East]] and Shuter Street. At the time, it was billed as the largest indoor arena in Canada and held about 7,500 for hockey. The rink was owned by the Toronto Arena Company, organized September 19, 1911 with [[Henry Pellatt|Sir Henry Pellatt]] as president, [[Lol Solman]] as managing director, and directors [[Aemilius Jarvis]], Joseph Kilgour, T.W. Horn, R.A. Smith, and Col. Carlson. There were two other directors from Montreal. W. J. Bellingham was the initial manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto World |date=December 10, 1912 |title=Arena in Full Swing; Perfect Sheet of Ice |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arena opened with a performance by Nathan Franko's Orchestra on October 7, 1912, supporting a recital by Alice Neville, soprano of the [[Metropolitan Opera]], tenor Orville Harold and a company of opera singers from the [[Boston Opera Company]] organized by Neville. It was the first of a series called the ''Toronto Music Festival.''&lt;ref name="world-opening"&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto World |date=October 7, 1912 |title=No Confusion Over Arena Tickets |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=hqOjcs7Dif8C&amp;dat=19121007&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en |accessdate=August 10, 2011 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entrances to the various blue and red seating sections were indicated by corresponding blue and red lights on the outside of the building.&lt;ref name="world-opening"/&gt; It was followed the next day by a recital by [[Johanna Gadski]] with Franko's orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto World |date=October 9, 1912 |page=1 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=g3UDAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=uikDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1353%2C2906224 |title=Seven Thousand People Heard Gadski at Arena|accessdate=August 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival continued all week, concluding on October 12 with a variety show headlined by [[Marie Dressler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto World |date=October 12, 1912 |page=8 |title=Marie Dressler Will Appear Tonight |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hnUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=uikDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2766%2C3392560 |accessdate=August 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Arena Gardens was initially home to two new teams in the [[National Hockey Association]] (NHA): the [[Toronto Blueshirts|Toronto Hockey Club]] and the [[Toronto Tecumsehs|Tecumseh Hockey Club]]. Delays in construction meant that the teams could not play in the 1911-12 season, as was originally scheduled. The {{Convert|12|miles}} of piping for the artificial ice was installed improperly and had to be reinstalled in December 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto World |date=December 3, 1912 |title=Rowing Club are to join junior hockey ranks |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto World |date=December 8, 1912 |title=Arena to be ready Monday |page=Sports p. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto World |date=December 9, 1912 |title=Arena Opens Today |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first professional ice hockey game in the building was on December 21, 1912, an exhibition between the [[Montreal Canadiens]] and [[Montreal Wanderers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto World |date=December 23, 1912 |title=Montreal Pros Show Class |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sprague Cleghorn]] was suspended for four weeks and fined $65 by the NHA for assaulting the Canadiens' [[Newsy Lalonde]] in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto World |date=December 23, 1912 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;The first official game was on December 25, 1912, a game between the Canadiens and the Torontos.{{sfn|Filey|1989|p=23}} Upon the suspension of the NHA in 1917, the professional franchise of the new [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) for Toronto was operated by the Toronto Arena itself. The franchise was operated by the Arena for two years before being sold to become the [[Toronto St. Patricks]]. The St. Pats became the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] in 1927, and played at Arena Gardens until the completion of [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] in 1931. Until 1923, the Arena was the only facility east of [[Manitoba]] with artificial ice-making capability. With this in mind, the St. Pats often let other teams use the Arena as a neutral site during the early and late months of the season, when it was usually too warm for proper ice.{{sfn|Hunter|1997}}

The year 1922 saw the first professional wrestling bout at the Arena, a bout between former world champion [[Stanislaus Zbyszko]] and Canadian champion George Walker. Professional wrestling would continue at the Arena until 1938. Promoter Ivan Mickailof began promoting weekly shows in 1929. Some of the names that Mickailof presented at the Arena included [[Strangler Lewis]] and [[Toots Mondt]], as well as reigning world champions [[Gus Sonnenberg]], [[Ed Don George]], [[Henri Deglane]], [[Jim Londos]], Ali Baba, Vic Christie, [[Everett Marshall]] and Billy Weidner, who all defended their titles at the Arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.garywill.com/toronto/arenagardens.htm |title=Arena Gardens: Toronto's original wrestling palace (1922-1938) |publisher=garywill.com |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 8, 1923, the first radio broadcast of an ice hockey game was made from the Arena by the [[Toronto Daily Star]]'s  [[CFCA (AM)|CFCA]] radio station. [[Norman Albert]] did the [[play-by-play]] of the third period of a game between North Toronto and [[Midland, Ontario|Midland]], won by North Toronto 16–4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto Star |date=February 9, 1923 |page=12 |author=Albert, Norman |title=Conacher Scored Six for North Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that season, [[Foster Hewitt]] made his first radio broadcasts from the Arena, also on CFCA. A game on February 14, 1923 featured the [[Toronto St. Pats]] and the [[Ottawa Senators (original)|Ottawa Senators]], and is the first [[National Hockey League|NHL]] game to be broadcast on radio.{{sfn|Kitchen|2008|p=246}} The [[Stanley Cup]] Final was played at Arena Gardens four times: [[1914 Stanley Cup Finals|1914]], [[1918 Stanley Cup Finals|1918]], [[1920 Stanley Cup Finals|1920]] and [[1922 Stanley Cup Finals|1922]]. Arena Gardens also hosted the [[Memorial Cup]] finals nine times from 1919 to 1931. The Gardens also hosted the [[Allan Cup]] final series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Montreal Gazette |date=March 29, 1930 |page=20 |title=M.A.A.A Confident on Eve of Second Allan Cup Match |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=znAtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=M4wFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=arena-gardens&amp;pg=6524%2C4967335 |accessdate=August 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1931 game between the [[Montreal Canadiens]] and the Maple Leafs was filmed by the [[National Film Board of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hockeythenandnow.blogspot.com/2011/04/game-film-circa-1931.html |title=Game Film : Circa 1931 |last=Amodeo |first=Jim |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:United Church of Canada inauguration 1925.jpg|thumb|right|Photograph of United Church inaugural service]]
The building was also used for mass assemblies. An assembly was held for [[Sir Wilfrid Laurier]] in 1913 by the [[Liberal Party of Canada]]. On June 10, 1925, this building was used as the venue for the inaugural service of the [[United Church of Canada]], which united four existing denominations: the [[Presbyterian Church in Canada|Presbyterian]]s, the [[Methodist Church]] of Canada, the [[Congregational church|Congregational Union of Canada]], and the Association of Local Union Churches. On October 9, 1936, it was the site of a mass assembly by the [[Communist Party of Canada]].

After the Maple Leafs left in 1931, the building no longer was a venue for professional ice hockey, but remained opened as a venue for sports and entertainment. Some of the other sports included bicycle racing, professional boxing and tennis.{{sfn|Filey|1989|p=23}} By 1934, revenues did not keep up with interest on bonds on the property, property taxes and the expenses of operating the arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Financial Post of Canada |date=July 28, 1934 |page=16 |title=Summon Meeting of Arena Creditors |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sV4_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=M1MMAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=arena-gardens&amp;pg=4381%2C574007 |accessdate=August 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bondholders made it known that the building was for sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Financial Post of Canada |date=September 1, 1934 |page=8 |title=Will Consider Sale of Toronto Arena |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tl4_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=M1MMAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=arena-gardens&amp;pg=4239%2C1291291 |accessdate=August 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1937, with $200,000 of bonds in default, and  the Arena in default of 1933 and 1934 taxes of nearly $16,000, and a similar amount estimated for 1936 and 1937, the Arena was listed for sale by the City of Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Financial Post of Canada |title=Tax Sale Threatens Toronto Arena Gardens |page=5 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NGc_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=u1MMAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=arena-gardens&amp;pg=4579%2C194385 |accessdate=August 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, the Arena was leased to Edward "Ted" Dickson who turned it into a recreation facility offering ice skating in winter and [[roller skating]] in summer. The name was changed that year to the Mutual Street Arena.{{sfn|Filey|1989|p=23}} The [[Glenn Miller]] big band played at the Arena in January 1942, Miller's only appearance in Toronto. [[Frank Sinatra]] made his first appearance in Toronto here in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Let's dance: a celebration of Ontario's dance halls and summer dance pavilions |last=Young |first=Peter |page=23 |year=2002 |isbn=1-896219-02-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roller hockey]] was introduced to the Arena in the late 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Billboard |date=March 6, 1948 |page=80 |title=Toronto's Hell on Wheels Paying Off at Box Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's first boat show was held in 1954. The ''Melody Fair'' theatre-in-the-round operated at the Arena in 1954.{{sfn|Filey|1989|p=23}}

Dickson bought the building in 1945 and it remained in the family for the next 43 years. The arena was renovated for $3 million in 1962, adding eighteen [[curling]] sheets, year-round roller skating, a parking garage and a new facade.{{sfn|Filey|1989|p=23}} The Arena was renamed '''The Terrace''', a name it kept until it was sold in 1988. It closed its doors on April 30, 1989 and was demolished a few months later. The site was converted into a residential development with some of the site reserved for a city park. The Terrace name was retained for one of the residential buildings. In May 2011, the name of the city park on the site was changed from ''Cathedral Square Park'' to ''Arena Gardens''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2011/te/bgrd/backgroundfile-37996.pdf |title=Proposed renaming of Cathedral Square Park to "Arena Gardens" |author=Brenda Patterson, General Manager, Parks, Forestry and Recreation |date=May 4, 2011 |work=Staff Report |publisher=City of Toronto  |accessdate=August 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5766">{{New Zealand NBL Awards}}
The '''National Basketball League Kiwi MVP''' is an annual [[National Basketball League (New Zealand)|National Basketball League]] (NBL) award given since the [[1984 New Zealand NBL season]] to the best performing New Zealand player(s) of the regular season. With no MVP award given for the league's first two seasons, in 1984, the league named its first MVP in New Zealander John "Dutchie" Rademakers. The award then went on a six-year hiatus before being brought back in [[1991 New Zealand NBL season|1991]]. However, the league did not recognise imports, with only New Zealanders being able to win MVP honours. That was until [[2003 New Zealand NBL season|2003]] when a [[New Zealand NBL Most Valuable Player Award|league-wide MVP award]] was introduced alongside the Kiwi MVP to allow imports the opportunity to win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2015 Bartercard NBL Handbook|work=Basketball.org.nz|url=http://www.basketball.org.nz/Portals/26/2015%20Bartercard%20National%20Basketball%20League%20Handbook.pdf|accessdate=3 November 2015|page=28–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9393">'''Parahawking''' is an activity that combines [[paragliding]] with [[falconry]]. Birds of prey are trained to fly with paragliders, guiding them to [[thermals]].

Parahawking was developed by British falconer Scott Mason in 2001. Mason began a round-the-world trip in [[Pokhara]], [[Nepal]], where many [[birds of prey]] – such as the [[griffon vulture]], [[steppe eagle]] and [[black kite]] – can be found. While taking a tandem paragliding flight with British paraglider Adam Hill, he had the opportunity to see [[Bird of prey|raptors]] in flight, and realised that he could combine the sports of paragliding and falconry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author=Charlotte Rixon | url=http://community.lovenature.com/interviews/meet-the-man-who-invented-parahawking-and-whos-still-fighting-for-nepals-vultures-15-years-later | title=Meet the man who invented parahawking and who’s still fighting for Nepal’s vultures—15 years later | publisher=lovenature.com | accessdate=7 March 2017 | date=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team started by training two black kites, but have since added two [[Egyptian vulture]]s, Kevin and Bob, to the team. Only rescued birds are used – none of the birds have been taken from the wild.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Mason and Hill documented their endeavours, with help from colleague Graham Saunders-Griffiths, in a film entitled ''Parahawking''. In addition to being named Best Debut Film at the 2003 Festival International du Film de Vol libre in [[Saint-Hilaire, Isère|St-Hilaire]], France (held as part of the [[Coupe Icare]]), and winning top prize in the 'Air' category at the 5th [http://www.horyamesto.sk Hory a Mesto] international festival of mountain films in [[Slovakia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spectator.sk/articles/view/15997/9/ 'German film climbs to the festival's top'], 3 May 2004&lt;/ref&gt; ''Parahawking'' was a finalist in the category of 'Best Film on Mountain Sports' at the 2003 [[Banff Mountain Film Festival]], and competed for the title of 'Best Documentary' at the 2004 [[Cervino International Film Festival]].

Already in 2010 the Nepalese government announced that the Himalayan Raptor Rescue Centre in Pokhara is to be closed following allegations that it was illegally holding endangered birds and that the parahawking amounted to cruelty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author=Andrew Drummond | url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/birdman-of-dagenhams-vulture-rescue-centre-in-himalayas-is-grounded-6732306.html | title=Birdman of Dagenham's vulture rescue centre in Himalayas is grounded | publisher=EveningStandard | date=17 February 2010 | accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.xcmag.com/2010/02/parahawking-in-nepal-under-threat/ | title=Parahawking in Nepal under threat | publisher=CrossCountry| date=18 February 2010 | accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these allegations parahawking stayed operational in Pokhara until 2017. 

In February 2017 Mason announced that parahawking has been shut down:
:''Thank you so much for all your concern and support, I know many are still wondering what is going on, it's still a very sensitive time so I really can't go into too much detail just yet. However I can announce that at present there will be no more Parahawking in Nepal, our project has been closed down and our birds, including our beloved Kevin and Bob have been confiscated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I appreciate that this is upsetting for many of you who have followed and supported us for MANY years. We are devastated, It's a difficult time for us all but we are working through it as a family and supported by many friends near and far.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just to reassure you, Kevin, Bob, Sapana, Goggles and Brad are safe and well and we are working hard to ensure they are well cared for, this situation is on going but our priority is their welfare at this time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thank you all for believing in us and supporting us in our efforts to bring about awareness and support vulture conservation in Nepal. We have not given up, this chapter may be closed for now but there may be something exciting just around the corner. Watch this space!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scott''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author=Scott Hjertas Mason | url=https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FParahawking%2Fposts%2F10158130667915109%3A0&amp;width=500 | title=Parahawking shut down | date=13 February 2017 | accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 February 2017 Mason announced on his Facebook page that the last ever parahawking flight in Nepal was performed with the vulture Bob and the passenger Paula Graham.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author=Scott Hjertas Mason | url=https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fscottmason2312%2Fposts%2F10154076528091923&amp;width=500 | title=Our last ever Parahawking flight in Nepal | date=15 February 2017 | accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The government of Nepal confiscated all birds. One of which was a [[booted eagle]] called Barry that had been given to the Parahawking Project for care by the British Embassy in Kathmandu after being mauled by a dog and had extensive feather damage. Barry was taken in by Kathmandu Central Zoo who insisted he was a black kite and eventually released him to a nearby forest despite not being able to fly at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author=Scott Hjertas Mason | url=https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FParahawking%2Fposts%2F10158228785325109&amp;width=500 | title=RIP Barry | date=6 March 2017 | accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Parr and Wisden's Ground''' was a [[cricket]] ground in [[Leamington Spa]], [[Warwickshire]].  The ground was named after the famous duo of [[George Parr (cricketer)|George Parr]] and [[John Wisden]], who were the proprietors of the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leamingtoncricket.co.uk/history/default.aspx A Club be Formed, A Brief History by Mark L Ryan]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded match on the ground was in 1848, when Leamington played an [[All-England Eleven]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/567_misc.html Other matches played on Parr and Wisden's Ground]&lt;/ref&gt;  The ground hosted 2 [[first-class cricket|first-class]] matches, the first of which came in 1849 and was between the [[North of England cricket team|North]] and the [[South of England cricket team|South]].  The second and final first-class match held at the ground came the following year in a repeat of the previous years fixture,&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/567_f.html First-Class Matches played on Parr and Wisden's Ground]&lt;/ref&gt; with Parr and Wisden themselves playing in the North team.  The final recorded match held on the ground came in 1862 and saw the [[Free Foresters Cricket Club|Free Foresters]] play an All-England Eleven.

As well as being a venue for cricket, the ground was also a notable [[archery]] venue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rlsas.com/comps/hosted/lmc/lmc-1851.php Royal Leamington Spa Archery Society]&lt;/ref&gt;  Today the ground has mostly been built on, though part of it makes up [[Victoria Park, Leamington Spa|Victoria Park]].

The '''Philip H. Iselin Stakes''' is an [[United States|American]] [[Thoroughbred horse race]] held annually at [[Monmouth Park Racetrack]] in [[Oceanport, New Jersey]]. Open to horses three years of age and older, the race was first run in 1884. In 1891, New Jersey state legislators began a move to ban [[parimutuel betting]] and the race had to be moved to the [[Jerome Park Racetrack]] and the [[Morris Park Racetrack]] in [[The Bronx]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. With a legislated permanent ban, after the 1893 running, the Monmouth Park Racetrack was shut down and the property sold. In 1946, Thoroughbred racing returned to a new Monmouth Park facility, spurred on by the burgeoning American economy after the end of [[World War II]].

From inception until 1966 the race was known as the Monmouth Handicap; then from 1967 through 1980 it was run as the Amory L. Haskell Handicap. In 1981 it reverted to the Monmouth Handicap name, then in 1986, it was given its present name to honor [[Philip H. Iselin]], a founding shareholder and director of the Monmounth Park Racetrack who would serve as its president and chairman of the [[board of directors]].

Created in the 19th century, when most Thoroughbred horse races were run at much longer distances than they are today, the early Monmouth Handicaps were raced over a distance of {{frac|1|1|2}} miles. Upon its revival in 1946 at the new Monmouth Park, the distance was set at {{frac|1|1|4}} miles. From 1979 through 1995 it was run at {{frac|1|1|8}} miles and in 1996 and 1997 at {{frac|1|1|16}} miles when [[Formal Gold]] won the 1997 edition in track record time. In 1998, the race reverted to its present {{frac|1|1|8}} mile format.

The '''Philip Iselin Stakes (G3)''' is the second leg of the '''Mid Atlantic Thoroughbred Championships''' Long Dirt Division or '''MATCh Races.'''  MATCh is a series of five races in five separate thoroughbred divisions run throughout four Mid-Atlantic States including; [[Pimlico Race Course]] and [[Laurel Park Racecourse]] in Maryland; [[Delaware Park Racetrack]] in Deleware; [[Parx Casino and Racing|Parx]], [[Philadelphia Park]] and [[Presque Isle Downs]] in Pennsylvania and [[Monmouth Park]] in New Jersey.

==Records==

'''The Ashes''' is a [[Test cricket]] series played between [[England cricket team|England]] and [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]]. The Ashes are regarded as being held by the team that most recently won the Test series. If the test series is drawn, the team that currently holds the Ashes retains the trophy. The term originated in a satirical obituary published in a British newspaper, ''[[The Sporting Times]]'', immediately after Australia's [[History of Test cricket from 1877 to 1883#Australia win in England 1882|1882 victory]] at [[The Oval]], its first Test win on English soil. The obituary stated that English cricket had died, and "the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Wendy Lewis | author-link=Wendy Lewis | author2=Simon Balderstone | author3=John Bowan | last-author-amp=yes | title=Events That Shaped Australia | page=75 | publisher=New Holland | year=2006 | isbn=978-1-74110-492-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mythical ashes immediately became associated with the [[History of Test cricket from 1877 to 1883#Bligh reclaims the Ashes 1882/3|1882–83 series played in Australia]], before which the English captain [[Ivo Bligh, 8th Earl of Darnley|Ivo Bligh]] had vowed to "regain those ashes". The English media therefore dubbed the tour ''the quest to regain the Ashes''.

After England had won two of the three Tests on the tour, a small urn was presented to Bligh by a group of [[Melbourne]] women including [[Florence Bligh, Countess of Darnley|Florence Morphy]], whom Bligh married within a year.&lt;ref name=events&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article63185850 Summary of Events] ''[[The Illustrated Australian News]]'', 20 February 1884, (foot of column 2) at [[National Library of Australia#Trove|Trove]]&lt;/ref&gt; The contents of the urn are reputed to be the ashes of a wooden [[bail (cricket)|bail]], and were humorously described as "the ashes of Australian cricket".&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article12673335 Cricket] ''[[The Mercury (Hobart)|Hobart Mercury]]'', 4 June 1908, p.8, at [[National Library of Australia#Trove|Trove]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear whether that "tiny silver urn" is the same as the small terracotta urn given to the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] by Bligh's widow after his death in 1927.

[[The Ashes urn|The urn]] has never been the official trophy of the Ashes series, having been a personal gift to Bligh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ashes History|url=http://www.lords.org/history/mcc-history/the-ashes |publisher=Lords}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[replica]]s of the urn are often held aloft by victorious teams as a symbol of their victory in an Ashes series. Since the [[English cricket team in Australia in 1998–99|1998–99 Ashes series]], a [[Waterford Crystal]] representation of the Ashes urn (called the Ashes Trophy) has been presented to the winners of an Ashes series as the official trophy of that series. Irrespective of which side holds the tournament, the urn remains in the MCC Museum at [[Lord's]]; it has however been taken to Australia to be put on touring display on two occasions: as part of the [[Australian Bicentenary]] celebrations in 1988, and to accompany the [[English cricket team in Australia in 2006–07|Ashes series in 2006–07]].

An Ashes series is traditionally of five Tests, hosted in turn by England and Australia at least once every two years. There have been 70 Ashes series: Australia have{{Clarification|why this particular style|date=August 2018}} won 33, England 32 and five series have been drawn.

==1882 origins==
{{main article|Australian cricket team in England in 1882}}
[[File:Ranji 1897 page 143 F. R. Spofforth, the demon bowler.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Fred Spofforth]], "The Demon Bowler", was instrumental in Australia's 1882 victory over England with 14 wickets for 90.]]
The first [[Test cricket|Test match]] between England and Australia was played in [[Melbourne]], Australia, [[English cricket team in Australia and New Zealand in 1876–77|in 1877]], though the Ashes legend started later, after the ninth Test, played in 1882. On their [[Australian cricket team in England and the United States in 1882|tour of England]] that year the Australians played just one Test, at [[the Oval]] in London. It was a low-scoring affair on a difficult [[Cricket pitch|wicket]].&lt;ref&gt;Fred Spofforth, however, contended that, the fourth innings aside, it played perfectly well.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia made a mere 63 runs in its first [[innings]], and England, led by [[A. N. Hornby]], took a 38-run lead with a total of 101. In its second innings, Australia, boosted by a spectacular 55 runs off 60 deliveries from [[Hugh Massie]], managed 122, which left England only 85 runs to win. The Australians were greatly demoralised by the manner of their second-innings collapse, but fast bowler [[Fred Spofforth]], spurred on by the [[gamesmanship]] of his opponents, in particular [[W. G. Grace]], refused to give in. "This thing can be done," he declared. Spofforth went on to devastate the English batting, taking his final four wickets for only two runs to leave England just eight runs short of victory.

When [[Ted Peate]], England's last batsman, came to the crease, his side needed just ten runs to win, but Peate managed only two before he was bowled by [[Harry Boyle (cricketer)|Harry Boyle]]. An astonished Oval crowd fell silent, struggling to believe that England could possibly have lost to a colony on home soil. When it finally sank in, the crowd swarmed onto the field, cheering loudly and chairing Boyle and Spofforth to the pavilion.

When Peate returned to the pavilion he was reprimanded by his captain for not allowing his partner, [[Charles Studd]] (one of the best batsman in England, having already hit two centuries that season against the colonists), to get the runs. Peate humorously replied, "I had no confidence in Mr Studd, sir, so thought I had better do my best."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The momentous defeat was widely recorded in the British press, which praised the Australians for their plentiful "pluck" and berated the Englishmen for their lack thereof. A celebrated poem appeared in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' on Saturday, 9 September. The first verse, quoted most frequently, reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
Well done, [[wikt:cornstalk|Cornstalks]]! Whipt us
Fair and square,
Was it luck that tript us?
Was it scare?
Kangaroo Land's 'Demon', or our own
Want of 'devil', coolness, nerve, backbone?
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 31 August, in the [[C. W. Alcock|Charles Alcock]]-edited magazine ''Cricket: A Weekly Record of The Game'', there appeared a mock obituary:

:''SACRED TO THE MEMORY''
:''OF''
:''ENGLAND'S SUPREMACY IN THE''
:''CRICKET-FIELD''
:''WHICH EXPIRED''
:''ON THE 29TH DAY OF AUGUST, AT THE OVAL''
:''"ITS END WAS PEATE"''

[[File:DeathofEnglishCricket.jpg|thumb|The death notice that appeared in ''[[The Sporting Times]]'']]
On 2 September a more celebrated mock obituary, written by [[Reginald Shirley Brooks]], appeared in ''[[The Sporting Times]]''. It read:

:''In Affectionate Remembrance''
:''of''
:''ENGLISH CRICKET,''
:''which died at the Oval''
:''on''
:''29 August 1882,''
:''Deeply lamented by a large circle of sorrowing''
:''friends and acquaintances''

:''R.I.P.''

:''N.B.—The body will be cremated and the''
:''ashes taken to Australia.''

[[Ivo Bligh, 8th Earl of Darnley|Ivo Bligh]] promised that on [[English cricket team in Australia in 1882–83|1882–83 tour of Australia]], he would, as England's captain, "recover those Ashes". He spoke of them several times over the course of the tour, and the Australian media quickly caught on. The three-match series resulted in a two-one win to England, notwithstanding a fourth match, won by the Australians, whose status remains a matter of ardent dispute.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

In the 20 years following Bligh's campaign the term "the Ashes" largely disappeared from public use. There is no indication that this was the accepted name for the series, at least not in England. The term became popular again in Australia first, when [[George Giffen]], in his memoirs (''With Bat and Ball'', 1899), used the term as if it were well known.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, A., ''Cricket Captains of England'', p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The true and global revitalisation of interest in the concept dates from 1903, when [[Plum Warner|Pelham Warner]] took a team to Australia with the promise that he would regain "the ashes". As had been the case on Bligh's tour 20 years before, the Australian media latched fervently onto the term and, this time, it stuck. Having fulfilled his promise, Warner published a book entitled ''How We Recovered the Ashes''. Although the origins of the term are not referred to in the text, the title served (along with the general hype created in Australia) to revive public interest in the legend. The first mention of "the Ashes" in [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] occurs in 1905, while ''Wisden'''s first account of the legend is in the 1922 edition.

==Urn==
{{Main article|The Ashes urn}}
[[File:Ashes Urn 1921.jpg|right|thumb|The earliest published photo of [[the Ashes urn]], from ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', 1921]]
[[File:Rupertswood mansion side angle shot.jpg|thumb|[[Rupertswood]] outside Melbourne, where the urn was presented to Bligh]]
As it took many years for the name "the Ashes" to be given to ongoing series between England and Australia, there was no concept of there being a representation of the ashes being presented to the winners. As late as 1925 the following verse appeared in ''The Cricketers Annual'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
So here's to Chapman, Hendren and Hobbs,
Gilligan, Woolley and Hearne
May they bring back to the Motherland,
The ashes which have no urn!
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nevertheless, several attempts had been made to embody the Ashes in a physical memorial. Examples include one presented to Warner in 1904, another to Australian captain M. A. Noble in 1909, and another to Australian captain W. M. Woodfull in 1934.

The oldest, and the one to enjoy enduring fame, was the one presented to Bligh, later Lord Darnley, during the 1882–83 tour. The precise nature of the origin of [[The Ashes urn|this urn]] is matter of dispute. Based on a statement by Darnley in 1894, it was believed that a group of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] ladies, including Darnley's later wife [[Florence Bligh, Countess of Darnley|Florence Morphy]], made the presentation after the victory in the Third Test in 1883. More recent researchers, in particular Ronald Willis&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=Ronald | last=Willis | title=Cricket's Biggest Mystery: The Ashes | isbn=0-7270-1768-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Joy Munns&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=Joy | last=Munns | title=Beyond Reasonable Doubt: The birthplace of the Ashes | isbn=0-646-22153-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; have studied the tour in detail and concluded that the presentation was made after a private cricket match played over Christmas 1882 when the English team were guests of [[Sir William John Clarke|Sir William Clarke]], at his property "[[Rupertswood]]", in [[Sunbury, Victoria]]. This was before the matches had started. The prime evidence for this theory was provided by a descendant of Clarke.

In August 1926 Ivo Bligh (now Lord Darnley) displayed the Ashes urn at the ''[[Morning Post]]'' Decorative Art Exhibition held in the Central Hall, Westminster. He made the following statement about how he was given the urn:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article58247421?searchTerm=darnley%20cricket%20ashes&amp;searchLimits= |title=Sunday Times (Perth) 15 August 1926 page 9S. Online Reference |publisher=Trove.nla.gov.au |date=15 August 1926 |accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|When in the autumn the English Eleven went to Australia it was said that they had come to Australia to "fetch" the ashes. England won two out of the three matches played against Murdoch's Australian Eleven, and after the third match some Melbourne ladies put some ashes into a small urn and gave them to me as captain of the English Eleven.}}

A more detailed account of how the Ashes were given to Ivo Bligh was outlined by his wife, the Countess of Darnley, in 1930 during a speech at a cricket luncheon. Her speech was reported by the London Times as follows:&lt;ref&gt;The Times (London), 27 June 1930. page 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In 1882, she said, it was first spoken of when the Sporting Times, after the Australians had thoroughly beaten the English at the Oval, wrote an obituary in affectionate memory of English cricket "whose demise was deeply lamented and the body would be cremated and taken to Australia". Her husband, then Ivo Bligh, took a team to Australia in the following year. Punch had a poem containing the words "When Ivo comes back with the urn" and when Ivo Bligh wiped out the defeat Lady Clarke, wife of Sir W. J. Clarke, who entertained the English so lavishly, found a little wooden urn, burnt a bail, put the ashes in the urn, and wrapping it in a red velvet bag, put it into her husband's (Ivo Bligh's) hands. He had always regarded it as a great treasure.}}

There is another statement which is not totally clear made by Lord Darnley in 1921 about the timing of the presentation of the urn. He was interviewed in his home at Cobham Hall by Montague Grover and the report of this interview was as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article66512851?searchTerm=%22cobham%20hall%22%20urn&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=192 |title=Geraldton Guardian 15 February 1921, page 1. Online reference |publisher=Trove.nla.gov.au |date=15 February 1921 |accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|This urn was presented to Lord Darnley by some ladies of Melbourne after the final defeat of his team, and before he returned with the members to England.}}

He made a similar statement in 1926. The report of this statement in the Brisbane Courier was as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article21053463?searchTerm=darnley%20ashes%20urn&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=192|title=Brisbane Courier, 9 June 1926, page 7. Online reference |publisher=Trove.nla.gov.au |date=9 June 1926 |accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The proudest possession of Lord Darnley is an earthenware urn containing the ashes which were presented to him by Melbourne residents when he captained the Englishmen in 1882. Though the team did not win, the urn containing the ashes was sent to him just before leaving Melbourne.}}

The contents of the urn are also problematic; they were variously reported to be the remains of a stump, bail or the outer casing of a ball, but in 1998 Darnley's 82-year-old daughter-in-law said they were the remains of her mother-in-law's veil, casting a further layer of doubt on the matter. However, during the tour of Australia in 2006/7, the MCC official accompanying the urn said the veil legend had been discounted, and it was now "95% certain" that the urn contains the ashes of a cricket bail. Speaking on Channel Nine TV on 25 November 2006, he said x-rays of the urn had shown the pedestal and handles were cracked, and repair work had to be carried out. The urn is made of [[terracotta]] and is about {{convert|6|in|mm}} tall and may originally have been a perfume jar.

[[File:Ashes song.jpg|thumb|The full version of the song from the ''[[Melbourne Punch]]'', the fourth verse of which is pasted onto the urn]]
A label containing a six-line verse is pasted on the urn. This is the fourth verse of a song-lyric published in the ''[[Melbourne Punch]]'' on 1 February 1883:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
When [[Ivo Bligh, 8th Earl of Darnley|Ivo]] goes back with the urn, the urn;
[[Studd brothers|Studds]], [[A G Steel|Steel]], [[Walter Read|Read]] and [[Edward Tylecote|Tylecote]] return, return;
The [[wikt:make the welkin ring|welkin]] will ring loud,
The great crowd will feel proud,
Seeing [[Dick Barlow|Barlow]] and [[Billy Bates|Bates]] with the urn, the urn;
And the rest coming home with the urn.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In February 1883, just before the disputed Fourth Test, a velvet bag made by Mrs Ann Fletcher, the daughter of Joseph Hines Clarke and Marion Wright, both of [[Dublin]], was given to Bligh to contain the urn.

During Darnley's lifetime there was little public knowledge of the urn, and no record of a published photograph exists before 1921.  ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'' published this photo in January 1921 (shown above).

When Darnley died in 1927 his widow presented the urn to the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] and that was the key event in establishing the urn as the physical embodiment of the legendary ashes. MCC first displayed the urn in the Long Room at [[Lord's]] and since 1953 in the MCC Cricket Museum at the ground. MCC's wish for it to be seen by as wide a range of cricket enthusiasts as possible has led to its being mistaken for an official trophy.

It is in fact a private memento, and for this reason it is never awarded to either England or Australia, but is kept permanently in the MCC Cricket Museum where it can be seen together with the specially made red and gold velvet bag and the scorecard of the 1882 match.

Because the urn itself is so delicate, it has been allowed to travel to Australia only twice. The first occasion was in 1988 for a museum tour as part of the [[Australian Bicentenary]] celebrations; the second was for the 2006/7 Ashes series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/6052544.stm | title=Ashes urn heads to Australia |publisher=BBC Sport  | date=15 October 2006 | accessdate=8 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The urn arrived on 17 October 2006, going on display at the [[Museum of Sydney]]. It then toured to other states, with the final appearance at the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery on 21 January 2007.

In the 1990s, given Australia's long dominance of the Ashes and the popular acceptance of the Darnley urn as "the Ashes", the idea was mooted that the victorious team should be awarded the urn as a trophy and allowed to retain it until the next series. As its condition is fragile and it is a prized exhibit at the MCC Cricket Museum, the MCC would not agree. Furthermore, in 2002, Bligh's great-great-grandson Lord Clifton, the heir-apparent to the [[Earl of Darnley|Earldom of Darnley]], argued that the Ashes urn should not be returned to Australia because it belonged to his family and was given to the MCC only for safe keeping.

As a compromise, the MCC commissioned a trophy in the form of a larger replica of the urn in [[Waterford Crystal]], to award to the winning team of each series from 1998–99. This is known as the Ashes Trophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lords.org/news/our-blogs/the-cricket-history-blog/what-is-the-ashes-trophy/ "What is the Ashes Trophy?"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130910205923/http://www.lords.org/news/our-blogs/the-cricket-history-blog/what-is-the-ashes-trophy |date=10 September 2013 }}, Lord's website. Retrieved 1 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This did little to diminish the status of the Darnley urn as the most important icon in cricket, the symbol of this old and keenly fought contest.

===Quest to "recover those ashes"===
{{See also|History of Test cricket (to 1883)#The Ashes legend|l1=History of Test cricket (to 1883): The Ashes legend}}
[[File:Ivo Bligh Vanity Fair 7 April 1904.jpg|thumb|upright|The Honourable Ivo Bligh]]
Later in 1882, following the famous Australian victory at The Oval, [[Ivo Bligh, 8th Earl of Darnley|Bligh]] led an England team to Australia, as he said, to "recover those ashes". Publicity surrounding the series was intense, and it was at some time during this series that the Ashes urn was crafted. Australia won the First Test by [[Result (cricket)|nine wickets]], but in the next two England were victorious. At the end of the Third Test, England were generally considered to have "won back the Ashes" 2–1. A fourth match was played, against a "United Australian XI", which was arguably stronger than the Australian sides that had competed in the previous three matches; this game, however, is not generally considered part of the 1882–83 series. It "is" counted as a Test, but as a standalone. This match ended in a victory for Australia.

===1884 to 1896===
After Bligh's victory, there was an extended period of English dominance. The tours generally had fewer Tests in the 1880s and 1890s than people have grown accustomed to in more recent years, the first five-Test series taking place only in 1894–95. England lost only four Ashes Tests in the 1880s out of 23 played, and they won all the seven series contested.

There was more chopping and changing in the teams, given that there was no official board of selectors for each country (in 1887–88, two separate English teams were on tour in Australia) and popularity with the fans varied. The 1890s games were more closely fought, Australia taking its first series win since 1882 with a 2–1 victory in 1891–92. But England dominated, winning the next three series to 1896 despite continuing player disputes.

The [[English cricket team in Australia in 1894-95|1894–95]] series began in sensational fashion when England won the First Test at Sydney by just 10 runs having followed on. Australia had scored a massive 586 ([[Syd Gregory]] 201, [[George Giffen]] 161) and then dismissed England for 325. But England responded with 437 and then dramatically dismissed Australia for 166 with [[Bobby Peel]] taking 6 for 67. At the close of the second last day's play, Australia were 113–2, needing only 64 more runs. But heavy rain fell overnight and next morning the two slow left-arm bowlers, Peel and [[Johnny Briggs (cricketer)|Johnny Briggs]], were all but unplayable. England went on to win the series 3–2 after it had been all square before the Final Test, which England won by 6 wickets. The English heroes were Peel, with 27 wickets in the series at an average of 26.70, and [[Tom Richardson (cricketer)|Tom Richardson]], with 32 at 26.53.

In 1896 England under the captaincy of [[W. G. Grace]] won the series 2–1, and this marked the end of England's longest period of Ashes dominance.

===1897 to 1902===
Australia resoundingly won the 1897–98 series by 4–1 under the captaincy of [[Harry Trott]]. His successor [[Joe Darling]] won the next three series in 1899, 1901–02 and the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1902|classic 1902 series]], which became one of the most famous in the history of Test cricket.

Five matches were played in 1902 but the first two were drawn after being hit by bad weather. In the First Test (the first played at [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground|Edgbaston]]), after scoring 376 England bowled out Australia for 36 ([[Wilfred Rhodes]] 7/17) and reduced them to 46–2 when they followed on. Australia won the Third and Fourth Tests at [[Bramall Lane]] and [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]] respectively. At Old Trafford, Australia won by just 3 runs after [[Victor Trumper]] had scored 104 on a "bad wicket", reaching his hundred before lunch on the first day. England won the last Test at [[The Oval]] by one wicket. Chasing 263 to win, it slumped to 48–5 before [[Gilbert Jessop|Jessop's]] 104 gave them a chance. He reached his hundred in just 75 minutes. The last-wicket pair of [[George Herbert Hirst|George Hirst]] and Rhodes were required to score 15 runs for victory. When Rhodes joined him, Hirst reportedly said: "We'll get them in singles, Wilfred." In fact, they scored thirteen singles and a two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/152487.html|title=Wisden - The glorious uncertainty|author=|date=|website=espncricinfo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The period of Darling's captaincy saw the emergence of outstanding Australian players such as Trumper, [[Warwick Armstrong]], [[James Kelly (cricketer)|James Kelly]], [[Monty Noble]], [[Clem Hill]], [[Hugh Trumble]] and [[Ernie Jones (Australian sportsman)|Ernie Jones]].

===Reviving the legend===
After what the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] saw as the problems of the earlier professional and amateur series they decided to take control of organising tours themselves, and this led to the first MCC tour of Australia in 1903–04. England won it against the odds, and [[Plum Warner]], the England captain, wrote up his version of the tour in his book ''How We Recovered The Ashes''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plum Warner]], ''How We Recovered The Ashes'', Longman, 1905&lt;/ref&gt; The title of this book revived the Ashes legend and it was after this that England v Australia series were customarily referred to as "The Ashes".

===1905 to 1912===
England and Australia were evenly matched until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. Five more series took place between 1905 and 1912. In 1905 England's captain [[Stanley Jackson]] not only won the series 2–0, but also won the toss in all five matches and headed both the batting and the bowling averages. Monty Noble led Australia to victory in both 1907–08 and 1909. Then England won in 1911–12 by four matches to one. [[Jack Hobbs]] establishing himself as England's first-choice opening batsman with three centuries, while [[Frank Foster (cricketer)|Frank Foster]] (32 wickets at 21.62) and [[Sydney Barnes]] (34 wickets at 22.88) formed a formidable bowling partnership.

England retained the Ashes when it won the [[1912 Triangular Tournament]], which also featured [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]]. The Australian touring party had been severely weakened by a [[Big Six cricket dispute of 1912|dispute]] between the board and players that caused [[Clem Hill]], [[Victor Trumper]], Warwick Armstrong, [[Tibby Cotter]], [[Sammy Carter]] and [[Vernon Ransford]] to be omitted.&lt;ref&gt;Harte, pp. 251–256.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1920 to 1933===
After the war, Australia took firm control of both the Ashes and world cricket. For the first time, the tactic of using two express bowlers in tandem paid off as [[Jack Gregory (cricketer)|Jack Gregory]] and [[Ted McDonald]] crippled the English batting on a regular basis. Australia recorded overwhelming victories both in England and on home soil. It won the first eight matches in succession including a 5–0 [[whitewash (sport)|whitewash]] in [[English cricket team in Australia in 1920-21|1920–1921]] at the hands of Warwick Armstrong's team.

The ruthless and belligerent Armstrong led his team back to England in 1921 where his men lost only two games late in the tour to narrowly miss out of being the first team to complete a tour of England without defeat.

England won only one Test out of 15 from the end of the war until 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Harte, pp. 274–276.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=auslist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/guru?sdb=team;team=AUS;class=testteam;filter=basic;opposition=0;notopposition=0;decade=0;homeaway=0;continent=0;country=0;notcountry=0;groundid=0;season=0;startdefault=1877-03-15;start=1877-03-15;enddefault=2007-11-20;end=2007-11-20;tourneyid=0;finals=0;daynight=0;toss=0;scheduledovers=0;scheduleddays=0;innings=0;followon=0;result=0;seriesresult=0;captainid=0;recent=;viewtype=resultlist;runslow=;runshigh=;wicketslow=;wicketshigh=;ballslow=;ballshigh=;overslow=;overshigh=;bpo=0;batevent=;conclow=;conchigh=;takenlow=;takenhigh=;ballsbowledlow=;ballsbowledhigh=;oversbowledlow=;oversbowledhigh=;bpobowled=0;bowlevent=;submit=1;.cgifields=viewtype |title=Statsguru – Australia – Tests – Results list |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=21 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a rain-hit series in 1926, England managed to eke out a 1–0 victory with a win in the final Test at The Oval. Because the series was at stake, the match was to be "timeless", i.e., played to a finish. Australia had a narrow first innings lead of 22. Jack Hobbs and [[Herbert Sutcliffe]] took the score to 49–0 at the end of the second day, a lead of 27. Heavy rain fell overnight, and next day the pitch soon developed into a traditional sticky wicket. England seemed doomed to be bowled out cheaply and to lose the match. In spite of the very difficult batting conditions, however, Hobbs and Sutcliffe took their partnership to 172 before Hobbs was out for exactly 100. Sutcliffe went on to make 161 and England won the game comfortably.&lt;ref&gt;Harte, pp. 298–301.&lt;/ref&gt; Australian captain [[Herbie Collins]] was stripped of all captaincy positions down to club level, and some accused him of throwing the match.

Australia's ageing post-war team broke up after 1926, with Collins, [[Charlie Macartney]] and [[Warren Bardsley]] all departing, and Gregory breaking down at the start of the 1928–29 series.

Despite the debut of [[Donald Bradman]], the inexperienced Australians, led by [[Jack Ryder (cricketer)|Jack Ryder]], were heavily defeated, losing 4–1.&lt;ref&gt;Harte, pp. 312–316.&lt;/ref&gt; England had a very strong batting side, with [[Wally Hammond]] contributing 905 runs at an average of 113.12, and Hobbs, Sutcliffe and [[Patsy Hendren]] all scoring heavily; the bowling was more than adequate, without being outstanding.

In 1930, [[Bill Woodfull]] led an extremely inexperienced team to England.

Bradman fulfilled his promise in the 1930 series when he scored 974 runs at 139.14, which remains a world record Test series aggregate. A modest Bradman can be heard in a 1930 recording saying "I have always endeavoured to do my best for the side, and the few centuries that have come my way have been achieved in the hope of winning matches. My one idea when going into bat was to make runs for Australia."&lt;ref name="Don Bradman on australianscreen online"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aso.gov.au/titles/spoken-word/1930-australian-xi-ashes/|title=Don Bradman in 'The 1930 Australian XI: Winners of the Ashes' on australianscreen online|accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Headingley Cricket Ground|Headingley]] Test, he made 334, reaching 309* at the end of the first day, including a century before lunch. Bradman himself thought that his 254 in the preceding match, at [[Lord's]], was a better innings. England managed to stay in contention until the deciding final Test at The Oval, but yet another double hundred by Bradman, and 7/92 by [[Percy Hornibrook]] in England's second innings, enabled Australia to win by an innings and take the series 2–1. [[Clarrie Grimmett]]'s 29 wickets at 31.89 for Australia in this high-scoring series were also important.

Australia had one of the strongest batting line-ups ever in the early 1930s, with Bradman, [[Archie Jackson]], [[Stan McCabe]], [[Bill Woodfull]] and [[Bill Ponsford]]. It was the prospect of bowling at this line-up that caused England's 1932–33 captain [[Douglas Jardine]] to adopt the tactic of fast [[leg theory]], better known as [[Bodyline]].

[[File:4th Test Woodfull.jpg|right|thumb|[[Bill Woodfull]] evades a ball from [[Harold Larwood]] with [[Bodyline]] field settings.]]

Jardine instructed his [[fast bowling|fast bowlers]], most notably [[Harold Larwood]] and [[Bill Voce]], to bowl at the bodies of the Australian batsmen, with the goal of forcing them to defend their bodies with their bats, thus providing easy catches to a stacked [[leg side|leg-side]] field. Jardine insisted that the tactic was legitimate and called it "leg theory" but it was widely disparaged by its opponents, who dubbed it "Bodyline" (from "on the line of the body"). Although England decisively won the Ashes 4–1, Bodyline caused such a furore in Australia that diplomats had to intervene to prevent serious harm to Anglo-Australian relations, and the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] eventually changed the [[Laws of cricket]] to curtail the number of leg side fielders.

Jardine's comment was: "I've not travelled 6,000 miles to make friends. I'm here to win the Ashes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/more_sport/article2387560.ece | location=London | work=The Times | title=Top 50 British achievements | first=Patrick | last=Kidd | date=4 September 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821160249/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/more_sport/article2387560.ece | archivedate=21 August 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the Australians wanted to use Bodyline in retaliation, but Woodfull flatly refused. He famously told England manager [[Pelham Warner]], "There are two teams out there. One is playing cricket; the other is making no attempt to do so" after the latter had come into the Australian rooms to express sympathy for a Larwood bouncer had struck the Australian skipper in the heart and felled him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = Cashman| author2 = Franks| author3 = Maxwell| author4 = Sainsbury| author5 = Stoddart| author6 = Weaver| author7 = Webster | date = 1997 | title = The A-Z of Australian cricketers|pages = 322–323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1934 to 1953===
On the batting-friendly [[cricket pitch|wickets]] that prevailed in the late 1930s, most Tests up to the Second World War still gave results. It should be borne in mind that Tests in Australia prior to the war were all played to a finish. Many batting records were set in this period.

The 1934 Ashes series began with the notable absence of Larwood, Voce and Jardine. The MCC had made it clear, in light of the revelations of the bodyline series, that these players would not face Australia. The MCC, although it had earlier condoned and encouraged {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} bodyline tactics in the 1932–33 series, laid the blame on Larwood when relations turned sour. Larwood was forced by the MCC to either apologise or be removed from the Test side. He went for the latter.

Australia recovered the Ashes in 1934 and held them until 1953, though no Test cricket was played during the Second World War.

As in 1930, the 1934 series was decided in the final Test at The Oval. Australia, batting first, posted a massive 701 in the first innings. Bradman (244) and Ponsford (266) were in record-breaking form with a partnership of 451 for the second wicket. England eventually faced a massive 707-run target for victory and failed, Australia winning the series 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;Harte, pp. 356–357.&lt;/ref&gt; This made Woodfull the only captain to regain the Ashes and he retired upon his return to Australia.

In 1936–37 Bradman succeeded Woodfull as Australian captain. He started badly, losing the first two Tests heavily after Australia were caught on [[sticky wicket]]s. However, the Australians fought back and Bradman won his first series in charge 3–2.

The 1938 series was a high-scoring affair with two high-scoring draws, resulting in a 1–1 result, Australia retaining the Ashes. After the first two matches ended in stalemate and the Third Test at Old Trafford never started due to rain. Australia then scraped home by five wickets inside three days in a low-scoring match at Headingley to retain the urn. In the timeless Fifth Test at The Oval, the highlight was [[Len Hutton]]'s then world-record score of 364 as England made 903-7 declared. Bradman and [[Jack Fingleton]] injured themselves during Hutton's marathon effort, and with only nine men, Australia fell to defeat by an innings and 579 runs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/england/6109836.stm Classic Ashes clashes - 1938, The Oval] at [[BBC Sport]], 5 November 2006. Accessed 4 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; the heaviest in Test history.

The Ashes resumed after the war when England toured in 1946–47 and, as in 1920–21, found that Australia had made the better post-war recovery. Still captained by Bradman and now featuring the potent new-ball partnership of [[Ray Lindwall]] and [[Keith Miller]], Australia was convincing 3–0 winners.

Aged 38 and having been unwell during the war, Bradman had been reluctant to play. He batted unconvincingly and reached 28 when he hit a ball to [[Jack Ikin]]; England believed it was a catch, but Bradman stood his ground, believing it to be a bump ball. The umpire ruled in the Australian captain's favour and he appeared to regain his fluency of yesteryear, scoring 187. Australia promptly seized the initiative, won the First Test convincingly and inaugurated a dominant post-war era. The controversy over the Ikin catch was one of the biggest disputes of the era.

In 1948 Australia set new standards, completely outplaying its hosts to win 4–0 with one draw. This [[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|Australian team]], led by Bradman, who turned 40 during his final tour of England, has gone down in history as ''The Invincibles''. Playing 34 matches on tour—three of which were not first-class—and including the five Tests, they remained unbeaten, winning 27 and drawing 7.

Bradman's men were greeted by packed crowds across the country, and records for Test attendances in England were set in the [[Second Test, 1948 Ashes series|Second]] and [[Fourth Test, 1948 Ashes series|Fourth Tests]] at Lord's and Headingley respectively. Before a record attendance of spectators at Headingley, Australia set a world record by chasing down 404 on the last day for a seven-wicket victory.

The 1948 series ended with one of the most poignant moments in cricket history, as Bradman played his final innings for Australia in the [[Fifth Test, 1948 Ashes series|Fifth Test]] at The Oval, needing to score only four runs to end with a career [[batting average (cricket)|batting average]] of exactly 100. However, Bradman made a second-ball duck, bowled by an [[Eric Hollies]] googly&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/8036237.stm 1948 - Bradman's final innings duck] at [[BBC Sport]], 27 May 2009. Accessed 4 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; that sent him into retirement with a career average of 99.94.

Bradman was succeeded as Australian captain by [[Lindsay Hassett]], who led the team to a 4–1 series victory in 1950–51. The series was not as one-sided as the number of wins suggest, with several tight matches.

The tide finally turned in 1953 when England won the final Test at The Oval to take the series 1–0, having narrowly avoided defeat in the preceding Test at Headingley. This was the beginning of one of the greatest periods in English cricket history with players such as captain Len Hutton, batsmen [[Denis Compton]], [[Peter May (cricketer)|Peter May]], [[Tom Graveney]], [[Colin Cowdrey]], bowlers [[Fred Trueman]], [[Brian Statham]], [[Alec Bedser]], [[Jim Laker]], [[Tony Lock]], wicket-keeper [[Godfrey Evans]] and all-rounder [[Trevor Bailey]].

===1954 to 1971===
[[File:Peter May.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Peter May (cricketer)|Peter May]] driving [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]] on his way to a century at Sydney.]]
In [[English cricket team in Australia in 1954-55|1954–55]], Australia's batsmen had no answer to the pace of [[Frank Tyson]] and Statham. After winning the First Test by an innings after being controversially sent in by Hutton, Australia lost its way and England took a hat-trick of victories to win the series 3–1.&lt;ref&gt;Harte, pp. 435–437.&lt;/ref&gt;

A dramatic series in 1956 saw a record that will probably never be beaten: off-spinner [[Jim Laker]]'s monumental effort at [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]] when he bowled 68 of 191 overs to take 19 out of 20 possible Australian wickets in the Fourth Test.&lt;ref&gt;Harte, pp. 444–446.&lt;/ref&gt; It was Australia's second consecutive innings defeat in a wet summer, and the hosts were in strong positions in the two drawn Tests, in which half the playing time was washed out. Bradman rated the team that won the series 2–1 as England's best ever.

England's dominance was not to last. Australia won 4–0 in 1958–59, having found a high-quality spinner of their own in new skipper [[Richie Benaud]], who took 31 wickets in the five-Test series, and paceman [[Alan Keith Davidson|Alan Davidson]], who took 24 wickets at 19.00. The series was overshadowed by the furore over various Australian bowlers, most notably [[Ian Meckiff]], whom the English management and media accused of [[throwing (cricket)|illegally throwing]] Australia to victory.

Australia consolidated its status as the leading team in world cricket with a hard-fought 2–1 away series. After narrowly winning the Second Test at Lord's, dubbed "The Battle of the Ridge" because of a protrusion on the pitch that caused erratic bounce, Australia mounted a comeback on the final day of the Fourth Test at Old Trafford and sealed the series after a heavy collapse during the English runchase.

The tempo of the play changed over the next four series in the 1960s, held in 1962–63, 1964, 1965–66 and 1968. The powerful array of bowlers that both countries boasted in the preceding decade moved into retirement, and their replacements were of lesser quality, making it more difficult to force a result. England failed to win any series during the 1960s, a period dominated by draws as teams found it more prudent to save face than risk losing. Of the 20 Tests played during the four series, Australia won four and England three. As they held the Ashes, Australia's captains [[Bob Simpson (cricketer)|Bob Simpson]] and [[Bill Lawry]] were happy to adopt safety-first tactics and their strategy of sedate batting saw many draws. During this period, spectator attendances dropped and media condemnation increased, but Simpson and Lawry flatly disregarded the public dissatisfaction.

It was in the 1960s that the bipolar dominance of England and Australia in world cricket was seriously challenged for the first time. West Indies defeated England twice in the mid-1960s and South Africa, in two series before they were banned for [[apartheid]], completely outplayed Australia 3–1 and 4–0. Australia had lost 2–1 during a tour of the West Indies in 1964–65, the first time it had lost a series to any team other than England.

In 1970–71, [[Ray Illingworth]] led England to a 2–0 win in Australia, mainly due to [[John Snow (cricketer)|John Snow]]'s fast bowling, and the prolific batting of [[Geoffrey Boycott]] and [[John Edrich]]. It was not until the last session of what was the 7th Test (one match having been abandoned without a ball bowled) that England's success was secured. Lawry was sacked after the Sixth Test after the selectors finally lost patience with Australia's lack of success and dour strategy. Lawry was not informed of the decision privately and heard his fate over the radio.&lt;ref&gt;Harte, pp. 526–530.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1972 to 1987===
The 1972 series finished 2–2, with England under Illingworth retaining the Ashes.&lt;ref&gt;Harte, pp. 538–540.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1974–75 series, with the England team breaking up and their best batsman Geoff Boycott refusing to play, Australian pace bowlers [[Jeff Thomson]] and [[Dennis Lillee]] wreaked havoc. A 4–1 result was a fair reflection as England were left shell shocked.&lt;ref&gt;Harte, pp. 557–559.&lt;/ref&gt; England then lost the 1975 series 0–1, but at least restored some pride under new captain [[Tony Greig]].&lt;ref&gt;Harte, pp. 561–563.&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia won the 1977 Centenary Test&lt;ref&gt;Harte, pp. 580–581.&lt;/ref&gt; which was not an Ashes contest, but then a storm broke as [[Kerry Packer]] announced his intention to form [[World Series Cricket]].&lt;ref&gt;Harte, pp. 579–590&lt;/ref&gt; WSC affected all Test-playing nations but it weakened Australia especially as the bulk of its players had signed up with Packer; the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) would not select WSC-contracted players and an almost completely new Test team had to be formed. WSC came after an era during which the duopoly of Australian and English dominance dissipated; the Ashes had long been seen as a cricket world championship but the rise of the West Indies in the late 1970s challenged that view. The West Indies would go on to record resounding Test series wins over Australia and England and dominated world cricket until the 1990s.

With Greig having joined WSC, England appointed [[Mike Brearley]] as its captain and he enjoyed great success against Australia. Largely assisted by the return of Boycott, Brearley's men won the 1977 series 3–0 and then completed an overwhelming 5–1 series win against an Australian side missing its WSC players in 1978–79. [[Allan Border]] made his Test debut for Australia in 1978–79.

Brearley retired from Test cricket in 1979 and was succeeded by [[Ian Botham]], who started the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1981|1981 series]] as England captain, by which time the WSC split had ended. After Australia took a 1–0 lead in the first two Tests, Botham was forced to resign or was sacked (depending on the source). Brearley surprisingly agreed to be reappointed before the Third Test at Headingley. This was a remarkable match in which Australia looked certain to take a 2–0 series lead after it had forced England to follow-on 227 runs behind. England, despite being 135 for 7, produced a second innings total of 356, Botham scoring 149*. Chasing just 130, Australia were sensationally dismissed for 111, [[Bob Willis]] taking 8–43. It was the first time since 1894–95 that a team following on had won a Test match. Under Brearley's leadership, England went on to win the next two matches before a drawn final match at The Oval.&lt;ref&gt;Harte, pp. 627–628.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982–83 Australia had [[Greg Chappell]] back from WSC as captain, while the England team was weakened by the enforced omission of their [[South African rebel tours|South African tour rebels]], particularly [[Graham Gooch]] and [[John Emburey]]. Australia went 2–0 up after three Tests, but England won the Fourth Test by 3 runs (after a 70-run last wicket stand) to set up the final decider, which was drawn.&lt;ref&gt;Harte, pp. 636–637.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 [[David Gower]]'s England team was strengthened by the return of Gooch and Emburey as well as the emergence at international level of [[Tim Robinson (cricketer)|Tim Robinson]] and [[Mike Gatting]]. Australia, now captained by [[Allan Border]], had itself been weakened by a rebel South African tour, the loss of [[Terry Alderman]] being a particular factor. England won 3–1.

Despite suffering heavy defeats against the West Indies during the 1980s, England continued to do well in the Ashes. Mike Gatting was the captain in 1986–87 but his team started badly and attracted some criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/columns/content/story/268042.html | title=Can't bat, can't bowl, can't field | publisher=[[Cricinfo]] | last=Miller | first=Andrew |author2=Martin Williamson  | date=16 November 2006 | accessdate=8 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then [[Chris Broad]] scored three hundreds in successive Tests and bowling successes from [[Graham Dilley]] and [[Gladstone Small]] meant England won the series 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;Harte, pp. 662–664.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1989 to 2003===
[[File:MCG99.jpg|right|thumb|[[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] Boxing Day Test 1998]]
The Australian team of 1989 was comparable to the great Australian teams of the past, and resoundingly defeated England 4–0.&lt;ref&gt;Harte, pp. 679–682.&lt;/ref&gt; Well led by [[Allan Border]], the team included the young cricketers [[Mark Taylor (cricketer)|Mark Taylor]], [[Merv Hughes]], [[David Boon]], [[Ian Healy]] and [[Steve Waugh]], who were all to prove long-serving and successful Ashes competitors. England, now led once again by [[David Gower]], suffered from injuries and poor form. During the Fourth Test news broke that prominent England players had agreed to take part in a "rebel tour" of South Africa the following winter; three of them ([[Tim Robinson (cricketer)|Tim Robinson]], [[Neil Foster]] and [[John Emburey]]) were playing in the match, and were subsequently dropped from the England side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-www.cricinfo.com/wisdencricketer/content/story/139086.html|title=Rebels take a step too far (English rebel tour to South Africa, 1989)|first=Nick|last=Hoult|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|date=July 2004|accessdate=22 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia reached a cricketing peak in the 1990s and early 2000s, coupled with a general decline in England's fortunes. After re-establishing its credibility in 1989, Australia underlined its superiority with victories in the 1990–91, 1993, 1994–95, 1997, 1998–99, 2001 and 2002–03 series, all by convincing margins.

Great Australian players in the early years included batsmen Border, Boon, Taylor and Steve Waugh. The captaincy passed from Border to Taylor in the mid-1990s and then to Steve Waugh before the 2001 series. In the latter part of the 1990s Waugh himself, along with his twin brother [[Mark Waugh|Mark]], scored heavily for Australia and fast bowlers [[Glenn McGrath]] and [[Jason Gillespie]] made a serious impact, especially the former. The wicketkeeper-batsman position was held by [[Ian Healy]] for most of the 1990s and by [[Adam Gilchrist]] from 2001 to 2006–07. In the 2000s, batsmen [[Justin Langer]], [[Damien Martyn]] and [[Matthew Hayden]] became noted players for Australia. But the most dominant Australian player was leg-spinner [[Shane Warne]], whose first delivery in Ashes cricket in 1993, to dismiss Mike Gatting, became known as the [[Ball of the Century]].

Australia's record between 1989 and 2005 had a significant impact on the statistics between the two sides. Before the 1989 series began, the win-loss ratio was almost even, with 87 test wins for Australia to England's 86, 74 tests having been drawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;opposition=1;orderby=won;spanmax2=1+Apr+1989;spanval2=span;team=2;template=results;trophy=1;type=team |title=Team records &amp;#124; Test matches &amp;#124; Cricinfo Statsguru &amp;#124; ESPN Cricinfo |publisher=Stats.cricinfo.com |accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 2005 series Australia's test wins had increased to 115 whereas England's had increased to only 93 (with 82 draws).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;opposition=1;orderby=won;spanmax2=1+Apr+2005;spanval2=span;team=2;template=results;trophy=1;type=team |title=Team records &amp;#124; Test matches &amp;#124; Cricinfo Statsguru &amp;#124; ESPN Cricinfo |publisher=Stats.cricinfo.com |accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the period between 1989 and the beginning of the 2005 series, the two sides had played 43 times; Australia winning 28 times, England 7 times, with 8 draws. Only a single England victory had come in a match in which the Ashes were still at stake, namely the First Test of the 1997 series. All others were consolation victories when the Ashes had been secured by Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/guru?sdb=team;team=AUS;class=testteam;filter=basic;opposition=ENG;notopposition=0;decade=0;homeaway=0;continent=0;country=0;notcountry=0;groundid=0;season=0;startdefault=1877-03-15;start=1877-03-15;enddefault=2005-03-29;end=2005-03-29;tourneyid=0;finals=0;daynight=0;toss=0;scheduledovers=0;scheduleddays=0;innings=0;followon=0;result=0;seriesresult=0;captainid=0;recent=;viewtype=series;runslow=;runshigh=;wicketslow=;wicketshigh=;ballslow=;ballshigh=;overslow=;overshigh=;bpo=0;batevent=;conclow=;conchigh=;takenlow=;takenhigh=;ballsbowledlow=;ballsbowledhigh=;oversbowledlow=;oversbowledhigh=;bpobowled=0;bowlevent=;submit=1;.cgifields=viewtype |title=Cricinfo – Statsguru – Australia – Tests – Series record |publisher=Stats.cricinfo.com |date=17 June 2008 |accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005 to 2016===
[[File:Trent Bridge, Flintoff century, 26 Aug 2005.jpg|left|thumb|[[Andrew Flintoff|Flintoff]] reaches 100 at [[Trent Bridge]].]]
England was undefeated in Test matches through the 2004 calendar year. This elevated them to second in the [[ICC Test Championship]]. Hopes that the [[2005 Ashes series]] would be closely fought proved well-founded, the series remaining undecided as the closing session of the final Test began. Experienced journalists including Richie Benaud rated the series as the most exciting in living memory. It has been compared with the great series of the distant past, such as 1894–95 and 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sport.y2u.co.uk/Cricket/Cricket_The_Ashes.htm|title=THE ASHES, a battle of wills between English and Australian Cricket|website=sport.y2u.co.uk|access-date=2017-01-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104233724/http://sport.y2u.co.uk/Cricket/Cricket_The_Ashes.htm|archive-date=4 January 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The First Test at [[Lord's]] was convincingly won by Australia, but in the remaining four matches the teams were evenly matched and England fought back to win the Second Test by 2 runs, the smallest winning margin in Ashes history, and the second-smallest in all Tests. The rain-affected Third Test ended with the last two Australian batsmen holding out for a draw; and England won the Fourth Test by three wickets after forcing Australia to [[follow-on]] for the first time in 191 Tests being a period of 17 years. A draw in the final Test gave England victory in an Ashes series for the first time in 18 years and their first Ashes victory at home since 1985.

Australia regained the Ashes on its home turf in the [[2006-07 Ashes series|2006–07 series]] with a convincing 5–0 victory, only the second time an Ashes series has been won by that margin. [[Glenn McGrath]], [[Shane Warne]] and [[Justin Langer]] retired from Test cricket after that series, while [[Damien Martyn]] retired during the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/australia/content/player/6513.html|title=Damien Martyn|publisher=cricinfo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ashes 2010-11 Sydney Test final wicket.jpg|thumb|right|[[Chris Tremlett]] bowls [[Michael Beer (cricketer)|Michael Beer]] to complete England's 3–1 Ashes victory on 7 January 2011]]

The [[2009 Ashes series|2009 series]] began with a tense draw in the First Test at [[SWALEC Stadium]] in [[Cardiff]], with England's last-wicket batsmen [[James Anderson (cricketer)|James Anderson]] and [[Monty Panesar]] surviving 69 balls. England then achieved its first Ashes win at Lord's since 1934 to go 1–0 up. After a rain-affected draw at Edgbaston, the fourth match at Headingley was convincingly won by Australia by an innings and 80 runs to level the series. Finally, England won the Fifth Test at [[The Oval]] by a margin of 197 runs to regain the Ashes. [[Andrew Flintoff]] retired from Test cricket soon afterwards.

The [[2010–11 Ashes series|2010–11 series]] was played in Australia. The First Test at Brisbane ended in a draw, but England won the Second Test, at Adelaide, by an innings and 71 runs. Australia came back with a victory at Perth in the Third Test. In the Fourth Test at Melbourne Cricket Ground, England batting second scored 513 to defeat Australia (98 and 258) by an innings and 157 runs. This gave England an unbeatable 2–1 lead in the series and so it retained the Ashes. England went on to win the series 3–1, beating Australia by an innings and 83 runs at Sydney in the Fifth Test. Australia, captained by Michael Clarke, batted first on a cloudy day after winning the toss and were bowled out for 280. England made 644, their highest innings total since 1938. England then bowled Australia out again for 281. England's series victory was its first on Australian soil for 24 years. The 2010–11 Ashes series was the only one in which a team had won three Tests by innings margins and it was the first time England had scored 500 or more four times in a single series.

Australia's build-up to the [[2013 Ashes series]] was far from ideal. [[Darren Lehmann]] took over as coach from [[Mickey Arthur]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-06-24/lehmann-named-australian-coach/4777030 Ashes 2013: Darren Lehmann replaces Mickey Arthur as Australia coach; Clarke steps down as selector] at [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]], 24 June 2013. Retrieved 24 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; following a string of poor results. A batting line-up weakened by the previous year's retirements of former captain [[Ricky Ponting]] and [[Mike Hussey]], was also shorn of opener [[David Warner (cricketer)|David Warner]], who was suspended for the start of the series following an off-field incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ashes 2013: David Warner set for southern Africa match practice |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/23261135 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=10 July 2013 |accessdate=11 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tourists put those issues behind them to bowl England out for 215 after losing the toss in the First Test at Trent Bridge. In the face of high-class swing bowling from [[James Anderson (cricketer)|James Anderson]], who ended with 10 wickets in the match, Australia collapsed to 117–9. However, debutant 19-year-old [[Ashton Agar]] made a world-record 98 for a number 11 and [[Phillip Hughes|Phil Hughes]] an unbeaten 81 to secure an unlikely lead of 65. England's second-innings total of 375 set Australia a target of 311, against which it fell short by only 14 runs in a tense finish. In the Second Test, England beat Australia by 347 runs in a very one-sided contest. In the Third Test, held at a newly refurbished Old Trafford, Australia won the toss and elected to bat first. It amassed a commanding score of 527–7, led by captain Michael Clarke's 187. The pressure was then on the home side to avoid the follow-on. England scored 368 with a century for Kevin Pietersen. Australia's second innings score was 172–7 at the end of Day 4, characterised by batting order changes to achieve a fast run rate to allow enough time to bowl England out amid inclement weather forecasts. Australia declared overnight to post England a target of 332 to win. Contrary to expectations, play resumed with only a minor delay on Day 5, and with captain Alastair Cook being bowled out for 0 (his first duck in 26 innings as captain), Australia looked to be in with a significant chance of a win, keeping its series hopes alive. By lunch England were 37–3, but on resumption of play only 3 balls were bowled before rain stopped play. This rain persisted and, at 16:40, the captains shook hands and the match was declared a draw. With England 2–0 up with two Tests to play, England retained the Ashes on 5 August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sheringham |first=Sam |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/23579840 |title=Ashes 2013: England retain Ashes as rain forces Old Trafford draw |work=BBC Sport |date=5 August 2013 |accessdate=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Fourth Test, England won the toss and batted first, putting on 238 runs, Australia took a narrow lead scoring 270 in its first innings. In the second innings England scored 330, Ian Bell top-scoring with 113. Needing only 298 runs to win Australia was in a strong position at 138/2, only 160 short with eight wickets in hand. Following a rain delay, Australia crashed to a 74-run defeat, losing all eight wickets for only 86 runs. England had taken 9 wickets in the final session of the fourth day. Stuart Broad was England's top wicket-taker in the match with 11 wickets. England held a 3–0 lead going into the final Fifth Test at The Oval.

The final Test was drawn. On the fourth day no play was possible due to rain, but on the final day after an aggressive Australian declaration, England came close to achieving its first 4–0 victory in an Ashes series. Play was abandoned, owing to bad light, denying a thrilling finish to the large crowd of spectators. There was media criticism of the new ICC rules requiring umpires to stop play when failing light was measured at a specified level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/23836394 |title=Ashes 2013: Ashes 2013: England win series 3–0 after bad light ends Oval Test |work=BBC Sport |date=25 August 2013 |accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Australia won the Ashes 5-0.jpg|thumb|240px|Celebrations at the SCG after Australia won the Ashes 5-0 in 2014]]
In the second of two Ashes series held in 2013 (the series ended in 2014), this time hosted by Australia, the home team won the series five test matches to nil. This was the third time Australia has completed a clean sweep (or "whitewash") in Ashes history, a feat never matched by England. All six Australian specialist batsmen scored more runs than any Englishman with 10 centuries among them, with only debutant Ben Stokes scoring a century for England. Mitchell Johnson took 37 English wickets at 13.97 and Ryan Harris 22 wickets at 19.31 in the 5-Test series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/708507.html;type=series|title=The best series for fast bowlers|work=Cricinfo|date=10 January 2014|accessdate=3 September 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151109234522/http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/708507.html|archivedate=9 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only Stuart Broad and all-rounder Stokes bowled effectively for England, with their spinner Graeme Swann retiring due to a chronic elbow injury after the decisive Third Test.

Australia came into the next Ashes series in England as favourites to retain the Ashes. Although England won the first Test in Cardiff, Australia won comfortably in the second Test at Lords. In the next two Tests, the Australian batsmen struggled, being bowled out for 136 in the first innings at [[Edgbaston]] , with England proceeding to win by eight wickets. This was followed by Australia being bowled out for 60 as [[Stuart Broad]] took fastest five wickets{{clarify|date=May 2017}} and finished the spell with 8 for 15 in the first innings at Trent Bridge, the quickest - in terms of balls faced - a team has been bowled out in the first innings of a Test match. With victory by an innings and 78 runs on the morning of the third day of the Fourth Test, England regained the Ashes.

===2017 to present===
During the buildup, the [[2017–18 Ashes series]] was regarded as a turning point for both sides. Australia were criticised for being too reliant on captain Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner, while England was said to have a shoddy middle to lower order.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cricbuzz.com/amp/cricket-news/97160/australia-cricket-team-over-reliant-on-steve-smith-david-warner-feels-michael-slater{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Off the field, England all-rounder Ben Stokes was ruled out of the side indefinitely due to a police investigation.

England won the toss in the first test match in Brisbane and elected to bat. Despite losing Alistair Cook early they thrived on the unusually slow pitch and were well placed before Patrick Cummins removed opener Mark Stoneman and Nathan Lyon abruptly ended James Vince's innings with a brilliant run out. England eventually went on to make 302. Australia, however, started terribly, with debutant Bancroft, Khawaja, Warner and Handscomb all falling early. A partnership between Steve Smith and Shaun Marsh ensured Australia wouldn't be blown away, before Smith then paired with Patrick Cummins to see Australia pass England's score. Facing a first-innings deficit, England again lost Alistair Cook early, but Joe Root was able to steady the ship. After he was removed by Josh Hazlewood, little resistance was provided, and the Aussies only required 170 to win from tea on day four. Openers Warner and Bancroft easily saw Australia through to a 10 wicket win over the next two sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/42132855|title=Ashes: Australia beat England by 10 wickets in first Test|author=|date=27 November 2017|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Australia won the second Test at Adelaide by 120 runs, which was the first ever day-night Ashes test match. Australia regained The Ashes with an innings and 41 run win in the third Test at Perth, the final Ashes Test at the WACA Ground.&lt;ref name="reclaim"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cricket.com.au/news/match-report/day-five-australia-england-third-magellan-ashes-test-video-highlights-live-scores-stream-waca/2017-12-18 | title=Ruthless Australia regain the Ashes |work=Cricket Australia |accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A team must win a series to gain the right to hold the Ashes. A drawn series results in the previous holders retaining the Ashes. Ashes series have generally been played over five Test matches, although there have been four-match series (1938; 1975) and six-match series (1970–71; 1974–75; 1978–79; 1981; 1985; 1989; 1993 and 1997). Australians have made 264 [[century (cricket)|centuries]] in Ashes Tests, of which 23 have been scores over 200, while Englishmen have scored 212 centuries, of which 10 have been over 200. Australians have taken 10 [[dismissal (cricket)|wickets]] in a match on 41 occasions, Englishmen 38 times.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Match venues==
The series alternates between the United Kingdom and Australia, and within each country each of the usually five matches is held at different grounds.

In [[Australia]], the grounds currently used are [[the Gabba]] in Brisbane (first staged an England–Australia Test in the 1932–33 season), [[Adelaide Oval]] (1884–85), the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (MCG) (1876–77), and the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] (SCG) (1881–82). A single Test was held at the [[Brisbane Exhibition Ground]] in 1928–29. Traditionally, Melbourne hosts the [[Boxing Day Test]] and Sydney hosts the New Year Test. Additionally [[WACA Ground|the WACA]] in Perth (1970–71) hosted its [[2017–18 Ashes series#3rd Test|final Ashes Test]] in 2017–18 and is due to be replaced by [[Perth Stadium]] for the [[2021–22 Ashes series|2021–22 series]]. 

Cricket Australia proposed that the 2010–11 series consist of six Tests, with the additional game to be played at [[Bellerive Oval]] in Hobart. The England and Wales Cricket Board declined and the series was played over five Tests.

In [[England]] and [[Wales]], the grounds used are: [[County Ground, Old Trafford|Old Trafford]] in Manchester (1884), [[The Oval]] in [[Kennington]], [[South London]] (1884); [[Lord's]] in [[St John's Wood]], [[North London]] (1884); [[Trent Bridge]] at [[West Bridgford]], Nottinghamshire (1899), [[Headingley Cricket Ground|Headingley]] in [[Leeds]] (1899); [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground|Edgbaston]] in [[Birmingham]] (1902); [[SWALEC Stadium|Sophia Gardens]] in [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]] (2009); and the [[Riverside Ground]] in [[Chester-le-Street]], County Durham (2013). One Test was also held at [[Bramall Lane]] in [[Sheffield]] in 1902. Traditionally the final Test of the series is played at the Oval. Sophia Gardens and the Riverside were excluded as Test grounds between the years of 2020 and 2024 and therefore will not host an Ashes Test until at least 2027. Trent Bridge is also not due to host an Ashes Test in 2019 or 2023.

The popularity and reputation of the cricket series has led to other sports or games, and/or their followers, using the name "Ashes" for contests between England and Australia. The best-known and longest-running of these events is the [[rugby league]] rivalry between [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]] and [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]] (see [[The Ashes (rugby league)|rugby league "Ashes"]]). Use of the name "Ashes" was suggested by the Australian team when rugby league matches between the two countries commenced in 1908. Other examples included the television game shows ''[[Gladiators (TV series)|Gladiators]]'' and ''[[Sale of the Century (Australian game show)|Sale of the Century]]'', both of which broadcast special editions containing contestants from the Australian and English versions of the shows competing against each other.

The term became further genericised in Australia in the first half of the twentieth century, and was used to describe many sports rivalries or competitions outside the context of Australia vs England. The [[Australian rules football]] [[Interstate matches in Australian rules football|interstate carnival]], and the small silver casket which served as its trophy, were symbolically known as "the Ashes" of Australian football,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Daily Herald|publication-place=Adelaide, SA|title=Carnival champions – presentation of the Ashes|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was spoken of as such until at least the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Barrier Daily Truth|publication-place=Broken Hill, NSW|page=6|title=Victoria's football ashes|date=11 August 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soccer rivalry between Australia and New Zealand was described as "the soccer ashes of Australasia" until as late as the 1950s;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Sporting Globe|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|title=Kiwis to win the Ashes|author=J. O. Wishaw|page=7|date=25 August 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; ashes from cigars smoked by the two countries' captains were put into a casket in 1923 to make the trophy literal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Referee|publication-place=Sydney, NSW|page=16|title=The soccer ashes of Australasia|date=16 April 1924}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interstate [[rugby league]] [[State of Origin series#Interstate Rugby League prior to 1980|rivalry between Queensland and New South Wales]] was known for a time as Australia's rugby league ashes, and [[lawn bowls|bowls]] competitions between the two states also regularly used the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Brisbane Courier|publication-place=Brisbane, QLD|title=Bowls – N.S.W. "Knuts" retain the "Ashes"|page=3|date=14 July 1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even some local rivalries, such as southern Western Australia's annual Great Southern Football Carnival, were locally described as "the ashes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Great Southern Herald|publication-place=Katanning, WA|page=3|date=21 September 1935|title=Great Southern Football Carnival}}&lt;/ref&gt; This genericised usage is no longer common, and "the Ashes" would today be assumed only to apply to a contest between Australia and England.

The Ashes featured in the film ''[[The Final Test]]'', released in 1953, based on a television play by [[Terence Rattigan]]. It stars [[Jack Warner (actor)|Jack Warner]] as an England cricketer playing the last Test of his career, which is the last of an Ashes series; the film includes cameo appearances of English captain [[Len Hutton]] and other players&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0045769/|title=The Final Test (1953)|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=13 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were part of England's 1953 triumph.

[[Douglas Adams]]'s 1982 science fiction comedy novel ''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]'' – the third part of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' series – features the urn containing the Ashes as a significant element of its plot. The urn is stolen by alien robots, as the burnt stump inside is part of a key needed to unlock the "Wikkit Gate" and release an imprisoned world called Krikkit.

''[[Bodyline (miniseries)|Bodyline]]'', a fictionalised television [[miniseries]] based on the "[[Bodyline]]" Ashes series of 1932–33, was screened in Australia in 1984. The cast included [[Gary Sweet]] as [[Donald Bradman]] and [[Hugo Weaving]] as England captain [[Douglas Jardine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frith|first1=David|title=Bodyline Autopsy: The full story of the most sensational Test cricket series: Australia v England 1932-33|publisher=Aurum Press|isbn=9781781311936|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=ijnLAgAAQBAJ|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CSKA ''' ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]: ''ЦСКА'') was a Bulgarian [[sports society]] from [[Sofia]], Bulgaria. '''CSKA''' stands for '''Central Sports Club of the Army''' ({{lang-bg|Централен Спортен Клуб на Армията}}). It was founded on 5 May 1948 as '''Septemvri pri CDV''', after the unification of the two sports clubs from the city, '''Chavdar''' and '''Septemvri'''. Since then, the club changed its name several times before settling on '''CSKA''' in 1989. 

The club is historically known as the [[Bulgarian Army]] sports club. Currently the sports club's departments are autonomous and are separated as of 1992. Therefore, the only connection of the departments to the Army are the historical traditions and the [[Bulgarian Army Stadium]]. Nevertheless, in the moment all of the clubs who have a connection to the sports society are incorporated into one joint society called '''United Sports Clubs CSKA''', which is currently а successor of the previous disbanded organization.

'''USF Baseball Stadium''' is a [[baseball]] [[Baseball field|venue]] located in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[Florida]], United States. It is home to the [[University of South Florida]] [[South Florida Bulls|Bulls]] [[college baseball]] team of the [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] [[American Athletic Conference]] (The American).&lt;ref name="2010mg" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gousfbulls.com/fls/7700/Interactive_Guides/BSB/future_stadium.html |title=2010 USF Baseball, Slide 2 |work=gousfbulls.com |accessdate=March 20, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xKXXl4To |archivedate=2011-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The facility has a capacity of 3,211 spectators.&lt;ref name="viewnew" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.usf.edu/article/templates/?a=3217&amp;z=127 |title=View the New Baseball Complex |date=March 14, 2011 |work=usf.edu |accessdate=March 20, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xKXPkdYj |archivedate=2011-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It replaced [[Red McEwen Field]] as the home of USF baseball.&lt;ref name="moments" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.tbo.com/content/2010/may/13/130500/sp-the-red-at-usf-had-its-moments/sports-colleges-bulls/ |title="The Red" Had Its Moments for USF Baseball |author=Scott Carter |date=May 13, 2010 |work=The Tampa Tribune |accessdate=March 20, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xKWpOfU5 |archivedate=2011-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Features of the ballpark include a 1,500-seat seating area with canopy, in-ground [[dugout (baseball)|dugout]]s, fan pavilions, [[batting cage]]s, and a [[press box]].&lt;ref name="viewnew" /&gt;

== History ==
After the demolition of Red McEwen Field following the 2010 season, construction of a new facility on the same location began. The alignment of the new field was changed from McEwen's to accommodate a concourse shared with the newly constructed neighboring softball field.&lt;ref name="alignment" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collegebaseballdaily.com/2009/12/04/south-florida-set-for-new-stadium/ |title=South Florida Set for New Stadium |author=Brian Foley |date=December 4, 2009 |work=College Baseball Daily |accessdate=March 20, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xKVZR7oi |archivedate=2011-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction was completed over the 2010-2011 offseason, with the stadium hosting its first game on February 25, 2011. In it, the Bulls lost to [[Elon Phoenix baseball|Elon]] 4-3 in extra innings. 3,126 spectators attended, a USF baseball record.&lt;ref name="firstgame" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gousfbulls.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=36642&amp;SPID=2917&amp;DB_OEM_ID=7700&amp;ATCLID=205104021 |title=Bulls Fall in Extras, 4-3, to Elon |author=USF Sports information |date=February 25, 2011 |work=gousfbulls.com |accessdate=March 20, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xKY9mf6g |archivedate=2011-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 11, 2011, a formal ceremony announcing the facility's opening was held.&lt;ref name="viewnew" /&gt;

In 2011, the Bulls ranked 29th in [[List of NCAA Division I baseball programs|Division I]] [[college baseball]] in attendance, averaging 1,537 per home game.&lt;ref name="11att"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.collegebaseballdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/National-Attendance-Report-FINAL.pdf|title= 2011 Division I Baseball Attendance|author= Tami Cutler|date= |accessdate=December 20, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/644cLUIuP|archivedate=2011-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Praise==
In 2012, college baseball writer Eric Sorenson ranked the stadium as the fifth most underrated venue in Division I baseball.&lt;ref name="stad ranks"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sorenson|first=Eric|title=Distiller's Dozen - The "Hey, Nice Stadium" Edition|url=http://blogs.eastonbaseball.com/collegebaseballtoday/2012/10/05/distillers-dozen-the-hey-nice-stadium-edition/|work=CollegeBaseballToday.com|accessdate=14 December 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CvAQAGQX|archivedate=14 December 2012|date=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
