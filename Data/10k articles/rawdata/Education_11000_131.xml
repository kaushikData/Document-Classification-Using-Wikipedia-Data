The '''Aarhus University School of Business and Social Sciences''' (in short '''Aarhus BSS'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Name logo and design |url=http://studerende.au.dk/en/studies/subject-portals/students-business-and-social-sciences/name-logo-and-design/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20150417100231/http://studerende.au.dk/en/studies/subject-portals/students-business-and-social-sciences/name-logo-and-design/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 April 2015 |publisher=Aarhus University |accessdate=17 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is one of four faculties of [[Aarhus University]] in [[Denmark]]. The school consists of seven departments:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bss.au.dk/profile/departments/ |title=Departments |publisher=Bss.au.dk |date=2013-02-15 |accessdate=2013-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130320191257/http://bss.au.dk/profile/departments/ |archivedate=2013-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Economics and Business Economics, [[Management]], Political Science, Law, Business Communication, Psychology and Behavioural Sciences and [[Department of Business Development and Technology]] (located in the city of [[Herning]]). The main campus is located in [[Aarhus]]. 

Aarhus BSS is a merger from 2007 and teaches programmes at Bachelor’s, Master and PhD level along with the MBA ([[Master of Business Administration]]), EMBA (Executive MBA) programmes and Summer University and Winter school courses. In 2010 Dale T. Mortensen, a Niels Bohr Visiting Professor at Aarhus University, received the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences together with his colleagues Peter Diamond and Christopher Pissarides.

==History==
{{main|Aarhus University}}The history of the Aarhus BSS is both old and new. On 1 January 2007, Aarhus School of Business (ASB or in Danish: ''Handelshøjskolen)'' merged with Aarhus University to become part of Aarhus University and in 2011 the Aarhus School of Business and Faculty of Social Sciences at Aarhus University were merged under the name of Aarhus University, School of Business and Social Sciences. Aarhus School of Business  was founded in 1939, and the Faculty of Social Sciences, consisting of several departments and faculties established between 1936 and 1969.

Aarhus School of Business's predecessor, The Jutland Business School (Den Jyske Handelshøjskole, DJH), has a somewhat more extensive history. Already in the late 1800s, DJH provided business programmes to young people from Jutland who wished to follow studies within business, economics and trade. Only when Aarhus School of Business was founded in 1939 did it become the academic institution that it was known as today.[https://web.archive.org/web/20150402235749/http://bss.au.dk/profile/historie/history-of-aarhus-school-of-business/]

Aarhus School of Business has continually grown since its founding. In 1968 Aarhus School of Business moved from the original location downtown Aarhus to the yellow and red brick buildings which since then have provided the setting for the outstanding research and teaching that Aarhus School of Business stood for.

After the 2011 merger the school now has around 16,000 students, 737 academic staff, including 223 PhD students,&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; making it one of the largest business schools in Europe.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Student life at BSS.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Student life.]] --&gt;

==Campus and student life==
[[File:Aarhus Business School.jpg|thumb|Students at work on Arhus BSS main campus.]]
The campus of the School of Business and Social Sciences has its main base around the University Park, the Nobel Park and campus Fuglesangs Allé, all located in the centre of Aarhus. In 2006, the Institute of Business and Technology in Herning (now AU Herning) was merged with Aarhus University, adding Birk Centerpark in Herning to the campus sites of School of Business and Social Sciences.

Because of its large number of students, Aarhus is regarded as a [[college town|university town]].

The campus in Aarhus and Herning offers a number of facilities, including Aarhus University Sport (AUS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aus.dk/ |title=Aarhus Universitets-Sport - Train Hard – Study Hard! |publisher=Aus.dk |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; which hosts more than 16 different sports activities and Denmark’s biggest Sports Day and Friday Bar, libraries on all campus sites, student organisations like Studenterlauget and the Student Council, and cafeterias and cafes like Dale’s café, Aarhus Student House and Klubben.

Accommodation at the university is possible in the University Park Dormitories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://koll.au.dk/en/ |title=Campus Housing at Aarhus University |publisher=Koll.au.dk |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3532">'''Alice Mary Bush''' (7 August 1914 &amp;ndash; 12 February 1974) was a pioneering New Zealand female [[physician]], [[pediatrician]] and [[activist]] for family planning services and [[abortion]] access.

==Medical career==
Born in 1914, Alice Stanton entered the [[Otago Medical School]] at the [[University of Otago|University of Otago, Dunedin]], in 1933, and completed her [[Bachelor of Medicine|MB]] and ChB in 1937. In 1938, she was appointed a Resident at the [[Auckland]] Hospital, and became visiting doctor at Auckland's Truby King Karitane Hospital and Mothercraft Care facility in the same year.&lt;ref name="DNZB Bush"&gt;{{DNZB|Bryder|Linda|5b55|Alice Mary Bush|9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the forties, Alice also became involved in medical politics. She co-authored a document that recommended ''A National Health Service'' (1943) for New Zealand, after she married William Bush in 1940. Alice also served as Secretary (1945-6) and President (1948, 1953) of the Auckland branch of the New Zealand Medical Women's Association. She joined the Royal Australasian College of Physicians (1946) and later became a fellow of the same organisation- the first women to do so (1955). In 1947, she spent some time in [[London]], where she served as a doctor at the Hospital For Sick Children in that city, before returning to New Zealand with her husband, where she helped to establish the Pediatric Society of New Zealand in that same year.

==Family planning and abortion activism==
In the late forties, Alice Bush also became involved with the New Zealand Family Planning Association, helping to provide respectability to an organisation that still proved controversial, given its role in publicising and distributing contraception. She served on its board (1947) and chaired its medical advisory committee (1960), before serving as liaison with the [[New Zealand Medical Association]] and clearing the way for clinic work with doctors before New Zealand approved use and distribution of the contraceptive pill (1961). Her role is chronicled in Helen Smythe's recent history of the Family Planning Association,Alice Bush's biographer, Faye Hercock, also noted that she was concerned about the rise in backstreet abortions and displayed considerable impatience with the conservatism of her male colleagues in her later years when it came to access to safe, legal and affordable [[abortion in New Zealand]]. Over time, Alice gradually radicalised her position and became one of the founders of the [[Abortion Law Reform Association of New Zealand]]. At the time she died, in 1974, the private Auckland Medical Aid Centre had just opened, providing a free-standing dedicated abortion clinic for the first time in New Zealand.

''Alma Doepel'' was built in 1903 in [[Bellingen, New South Wales|Bellingen]], [[NSW]], by Frederick Doepel and named after his youngest daughter Alma. Until 1915 she operated between Sydney and the northern rivers district of New South Wales. In late 1915 she was sold to Tasmanian owners and commenced operation in Tasmania, mainly carrying timber and goods between Hobart and Melbourne. She was fitted with an auxiliary engine in 1916, and again in 1936. In a 1937 refit her rig was simplified from having square topsails on the foremast to having a fore-and-after rig. In 1943 she was requisitioned by the army, refitted and renamed AK82, and used as an army supply vessel running from Townsville and Darwin to Papua New Guinea. After the war she was reverted to merchant vessel configuration, resuming operation in Tasmania in 1946. From 1961 to 1975 she was stripped of her rigging and used to carry limestone, before being sold, for the scrap value of her engines, to the Melbourne company Sail &amp; Adventure in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=McDonell, R.

==Restoration==
From 1976 to 1987, ''Alma Doepel'' was comprehensively restored and returned to full sail in magnificent style to lead the Parade of Sail in [[Sydney Harbour]] in January 1988. She was then used as a [[sail training]] ship, based in [[Melbourne]], until 1999 when the need for work on the hull and lack of funds put a stop to this activity. In April 2001, ''Alma Doepel'' was taken to [[Port Macquarie]] where she was berthed at Lady Nelson Wharf and open to the public as a static exhibit. In January 2009 the ''Alma Doepel'' returned to Melbourne. She is berthed at No 2 [[Victoria Dock (Melbourne)]]  undergoing an extensive refit to return her to survey so she can recommence sail training.

In [[Greek mythology]], the '''Amazons''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀμαζόνες}}, ''{{transl|grc|Amazónes}}'', singular {{lang|grc|Ἀμαζών}}, ''{{transl|grc|Amazōn}}'') were a tribe of women warriors related to [[Scythians]] and [[Sarmatians]]. [[Apollonius Rhodius]], at [[Argonautica]], mentions that Amazons were the daughters of [[Ares]] and [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]] (a nymph of the Akmonian Wood). They were brutal and aggressive, and their main concern in life was war.&lt;ref name="theoi.com"&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/AresFamily.html Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautica, Book 2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2"&gt;[http://sacred-texts.com/cla/argo/argo23.htm ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herodotus]] and [[Strabo]] place them on the banks of the [[Thermodon]],&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hh/hh4110.htm Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/rca/rca02.htm THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND]&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Diodorus]] giving the account of Dionysius of Mitylene, who, on his part, drew on Thymoetas, states that before the Amazons of the Thermodon there were, much earlier in time, the Amazons of Libya.&lt;ref name="penelope.uchicago.edu"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3D*.html The Library of History of Diodorus Siculus, Book III, 52]&lt;/ref&gt; These Amazons started from [[Ancient Libya|Libya]], passed through Egypt and Syria, and stopped at the [[Caïcus]] in [[Aeolis]], near which they founded several cities. Later, he says, they established [[Mytilene]] a little way beyond the Caïcus.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; [[Aeschylus]], in [[Prometheus Bound]], places the original home of the Amazons in the country about [[Lake Maeotis]] and they later moved to [[Themiscyra (Pontus)|Themiscyra]] on the Thermodon.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND"&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Text/AeschylusPrometheus.html AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homer]] tells that the Amazons were sought and found somewhere near [[Lycia]].&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt;

Notable queens of the Amazons are [[Penthesilea]], who participated in the [[Trojan War]], and her sister [[Hippolyta]], whose magical girdle, given to her by her father [[Ares]], was the object of one of the [[labours of Heracles]]. [[Diodorus]] mentions that the Amazons traveled from Libya under Queen [[Myrina (mythology)|Myrina]].&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; Amazon warriors were often depicted in battle with Greek warriors in [[amazonomachy|amazonomachies]] in classical art.

Archaeological discoveries of burial sites with female warriors on the Eurasian steppes suggest that the [[Scythian]] women may have inspired the myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simon|first1=Worrall|title=Amazon Warriors Did Indeed Fight and Die Like Men|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/10/141029-amazons-scythians-hunger-games-herodotus-ice-princess-tattoo-cannabis/|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foreman|first1=Amanda|title=The Amazon Women: Is There Any Truth Behind the Myth?|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/amazon-women-there-any-truth-behind-myth-180950188/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[early modern period]], their name has become a term for female warriors in general. Amazons were said to have founded the cities and temples of Smyrna, Sinope, Cyme, Gryne, Ephesus, Pitania, Magnesia, Clete, Pygela, Latoreria and Amastris; according to legend, the Amazons also invented the [[cavalry]].&lt;ref name="Wonder Woman"&gt;{{Cite book| last1=Steinem | first1=Gloria| last2=Chesler| first2=Phyllis | last3=Feitler | first3=Bea | title= Wonder Woman | publisher= Hole, Rinehart and Winston and Warner Books | date=1972 | isbn = 0-03-005376-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Palaephatus]], who was trying to rationalize the Greek myths in his work ''On Unbelievable Tales'' or ''On Incredible Tales'' ({{lang-grc|Περὶ ἀπίστων ἱστοριῶν}}), stated that the Amazons most probably were men mistaken for women by their enemies because they wore clothing which reached their feet, tied up their hair in headbands and shaved their beards, and also, since they did not exist during his time, most probably they did nοt exist in the past either.&lt;ref&gt;Palaephatus On Unbelievable Tales&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=t4EfiGQwgh4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false On Unbelievable Tales, p. 64]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=a-NmaO-kM2UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Classical Mythology: A Guide to the Mythical World of the Greeks and Romans, p. 9]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The origin of the word is uncertain. It may be derived from an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[ethnonym]] ''*ha-mazan-'' "warriors", a word attested indirectly through a derivation, a denominal verb in [[Hesychius of Alexandria]]'s gloss {{lang|grc|"ἁμαζακάραν· πολεμεῖν. Πέρσαι"}} ("''{{transl|grc|hamazakaran}}'': 'to make war' in Persian"), where it appears together with the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] root ''*kar-'' "make" (from which [[Sanskrit]] ''[[karma]]'' is also derived).&lt;ref&gt;Lagercrantz, ''Xenia Lidéniana'' (1912), 270ff., cited after [[Hjalmar Frisk]], ''Greek Etymological Dictionary'' (1960–1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

It may also be derived from ''{{PIE|*ṇ-mṇ-gw-jon-es}}'' "manless, without husbands" ([[privative a|''a-'' privative]] and a derivation of ''[[Man (word)|*man-]]'' also found in Slavic ''muzh'') has been proposed, an explanation deemed "unlikely" by [[Hjalmar Frisk]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsohn, [[Kuhns Zeitschrift|KZ]] 54, 278ff., cited after [[Hjalmar Frisk]] (1960–1970).&lt;/ref&gt; 19th-century scholarship also connected the term to the ethnonym [[Amazigh]].&lt;ref&gt;Guy Cadogan Rothery, ''The Amazons'' (1910), [http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/ama/ama08.htm ch. 7]: "There have been some authors who trace the word Amazon from this term."&lt;/ref&gt; A further explanation proposes Iranian *''ama-janah'' "virility-killing" as source.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hinge|2005|pp=94–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Classical Greeks, ''amazon'' was given a [[False etymology|folk etymology]] as originating from ''{{transl|grc|a-}}'' ({{lang|grc|ἀ-}}) and ''{{transl|grc|mazos}}'' ({{lang|grc|μαζός}}), "without [[breast]]", connected with an [[etiology|etiological]] tradition once claimed by [[Justin (historian)|Marcus Justinus]] who alleged that Amazons had their right [[mastectomy|breast cut off]] or [[breast ironing|burnt out]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Justin (historian)|Justinus']] "Historiae Phillippicae ex Trogo Pompeio", Liber II, 4: "Virgines (...) armis, equis, venationibus exercebant, inustis infantum dexterioribus mammis, ne sagittarum iactus impediantur; unde dictae Amazones." "They exercised the virgins on weapon-wielding, horse-riding and hunting, and burned the children's right breasts, so that arrow-throwing wouldn't be impeded; and for such reason, they were called Amazons."&lt;/ref&gt; There is no indication of such a practice in ancient works of art,&lt;ref name=Mayor&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-amazons-lives--legends-of-warrior-women-across-the-ancient-world-by-adrienne-mayor-book-review-9799090.html|title=The Amazons: Lives &amp; Legends of Warrior Women Across the Ancient World by Adrienne Mayor, book review|last=Haynes|first=Natalie|date=16 October 2014|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the Amazons are always represented with both breasts, although one is frequently covered.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Amazons|volume=1|pages=790–791}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mayor"/&gt; Adrienne Mayor suggests the origin of this myth was due to the word's etymology.&lt;ref name=Mayor/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Adrienne Mayor, Start the Week, Radio Four|date= 6 April 2015|time= 21:30 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05plghp|publisher=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greeks also used some [[epithet|descriptive phrases]] for them. Herodotus used the ''Androktones'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀνδροκτόνες}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀνδροκτόνα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Androktona}}'') ("killers of men")&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt; and ''Androleteirai'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀνδρολέτειραι}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀνδρολέτειρα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Androleteira}}'') ("destroyers of men, murderesses"),&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; in the [[Iliad]] they are also called ''Antianeirai'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀντιάνειραι}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀντιάνειρα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Antianeira}}'') ("against men") and Aeschylus, in his work ''Prometheus Bound'', used ''styganor'' ({{lang|grc|στυγάνωρ}}) ("those who loathe all men").&lt;ref name="AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND"/&gt;&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0009%3Acard%3D696 Aeschylus, Prometheus Bound]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Amazon Anıtı (2).jpg|thumb|upleft|Amazons monument in [[Samsun]], [[Turkey]].]]

[[Herodotus]] and [[Strabo]] placed them on the banks of the [[Thermodon]] and [[Themiscyra (Pontus)|Themiscyra]].&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt;&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; Herodotus also mentions that some Amazons lived at Scythia because after the Greeks defeated the Amazons in battle, they sailed away carrying in three ships as many Amazons as they had been able to take alive, but out at sea the Amazons attacked the crews and killed them, then these Amazons landed at Scythian lands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D4%3Achapter%3D110%3Asection%3D1 Herodotus Histories]&lt;/ref&gt; Strabo writes that the original home of the Amazons was in Themiscyra and the plains about Thermodon and the mountains that lie above them, but were later driven out of these places, and during his time they were said to live in the mountains above [[Caucasian Albania]] (not to be confused with the modern [[Albania]]), but he also states that some others, among them [[Metrodorus of Scepsis]] and [[Hypsicrates]], say that after Themiscyra, the Amazons traveled and lived on the borders of the Gargarians, in the northerly foothills of those parts of the [[Caucasian Mountains]] which are called Ceraunian.&lt;ref name="uchicago1"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/11E*.html STRABO, GEOGRAPHY, Book XI, Chapter 5] {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diodorus]] giving the account of Dionysius of Mitylene, who, on his part, drew on Thymoetas states that before the Amazons of the Thermodon there were, much earlier in time, the Amazons of Libya.&lt;ref name="penelope.uchicago.edu"/&gt; These Amazons started from [[Ancient Libya|Libya]] passed through Egypt and Syria, and stopped at the [[Caïcus]] in [[Aeolis]], near which they founded several cities. Later, he says, they established [[Mitylene]] a little way beyond the Caïcus.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; [[Aeschylus]], in ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'', places the original home of the Amazons in the country about [[Lake Maeotis]] and they later moved to [[Themiscyra (Pontus)|Themiscyra]] on the Thermodon.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND"/&gt; According to [[Pseudo-Plutarch]], the Amazons lived in and about the Tanais ({{lang-grc-gre|Τάναϊς}}) river (modern [[Don River (Russia)|Don river]]), formerly called the Amazonian or Amazon ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀμαζόνιος}}) river, because the Amazons bathed themselves therein.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0400%3Achapter%3D14 Pseudo-Plutarch-XIV, TANAIS]&lt;/ref&gt; The Amazons later moved to [[Themiscyra (mythology)|Themiscyra]] (speculated to be modern [[Terme]], though no ruins exist) on the River [[Thermodon]] (the Terme river in northern Turkey).
[[Plutarch]] mentions that the campaign(s) of [[Heracles]] and [[Theseus]] against the Amazons was at [[Euxine Sea]] (modern Black Sea).&lt;ref name="uchicago2"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/theseus*.html Plutarch, The Parallel Lives, The Life of Theseus]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homer]] tells that the Amazons were sought and found somewhere near [[Lycia]].&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt;

The Amazons were supposed to have founded many towns, amongst them [[Smyrna]], [[Ephesus]], [[Cyme (Aeolis)|Cyme]], [[Myrina (Aeolis)|Myrina]], [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]], [[Paphos]], [[Mitylene]].&lt;ref name="uchicago1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; At [[Patmos]] there was a place called Amazonium.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stadiasm.

[[Apollonius Rhodius]], at [[Argonautica]], mentions that at Thermodon the Amazons were not gathered together in one city, but scattered over the land, parted into three tribes. In one part dwelt the Themiscyreians ({{lang|grc|Θεμισκύρειαι}}), in another the Lycastians ({{lang|grc|Λυκάστιαι}}), and in another the Chadesians ({{lang|grc|Χαδήσιαι}}).&lt;ref name="ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2, 994-1001"&gt;[http://sacred-texts.com/cla/argo/argo23.htm ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2, 994-1001]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other names==

Greeks also used other [[epithet|descriptive phrases]] for them. Herodotus used the ''Androktones'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀνδροκτόνες}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀνδροκτόνα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Androktonα}}'') ("killers/slayers of men")&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt; and ''Androleteirai'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀνδρολέτειραι}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀνδρολέτειρα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Androleteira}}'') ("destroyers of men, murderesses"),&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; in the [[Iliad]] they are also called ''Antianeirai'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀντιάνειραι}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀντιάνειρα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Antianeira}}'') ("equivalent to men") and Aeschylus used the ''Styganor'' ({{lang|grc|Στυγάνωρ}}) ("those who loathe all men")&lt;ref name="AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND"/&gt;&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"/&gt; in his work [[Prometheus Bound]].

[[Herodotus]] stated that in the Scythian language they were called ''Oiorpata'', ''oior'' meaning "man", and ''pata'' meaning "to slay".&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt;

==Mythology==
In some versions of the myth, no men were permitted to have sexual encounters or reside in Amazon country; but once a year, in order to prevent their race from dying out, they visited the [[Gargareans]], a neighbouring tribe.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

[[Strabo]], giving credits to [[Metrodorus of Scepsis]] and [[Hypsicrates]], mentions that at his time the Amazons were believed to live on the borders of the [[Gargareans]]. There were two special months in the spring in which they would go up into the neighboring mountain which separates them and the Gargareans. The Gargareans also, in accordance with an ancient custom, would go there to offer sacrifice with the Amazons and also to have intercourse with them for the sake of begetting children. They did this in secrecy and darkness, any Gargareans at random with any Amazon, and after making them pregnant they would send them away. Any females that were born are retained by the Amazons themselves, but the males would be taken to the Gargareans to be brought up; and each Gargarean to whom a child is brought would adopt the child as his own, regarding the child as his son because of his uncertainty.&lt;ref name="uchicago1"/&gt; He also stated that the Gargareans went up from Themiscyra into this region with the Amazons, then, in company with some Thracians and Euboeans who had wandered thus far, waged war against them. They later ended the war against the Amazons and made a compact that they should have dealings with one another only in the matter of children, and that each people should live independent of the other.&lt;ref name="uchicago1"/&gt;
In addition, he states that the right breasts of all Amazons are seared when they are infants, so that they can easily use their right arm for every needed purpose, and especially that of throwing the javelin and use the bow.&lt;ref name="uchicago1"/&gt;
[[File:Otto van Veen - Amazons and Scythians.jpg|thumb|left|320px|''Amazons and Scythians'' by [[Otto van Veen]]]]

Herodotus mentions that when Greeks defeated the Amazons at war, they sailed away carrying in three ships as many Amazons as they had been able to take alive, but out at sea the Amazons attacked the crews and killed them. But the Amazons knew nothing about ships so they were driven about by waves and winds and they were disembarked at the land of the Scythians, there they met first with a troop of horses feeding, they seized them and mounted upon these they plundered the property of the Scythians. The Scythians were not able to understand them because they did not know either their speech or their dress or the race to which they belonged, and they thought that they were men. Scythians fought a battle against them, and after the battle the Scythians got possession of the bodies of the dead, and thus they discovered that they were women. After the battle Scythians sent young men and told them to encamp near the Amazons and to do whatsoever they should do. If the women should come after them, they were not to fight but to retire before them, and when the women stopped, they were to approach near and encamp. This plan was adopted by the Scythians because they desired to have children born from them. When the Amazons perceived that they had not come to do them any harm, they let them alone; and the two camps approached nearer to one another every day: and the young men, like the Amazons, had nothing except their arms and their horses and got their living, as the Amazons did, by hunting and by taking booty. One day a Scythian and an Amazon came close. They could not speak to each other because they were speaking different languages but the Amazon made signs to him with her hand to come. Later the young Scythians and the Amazons joined their camps and lived together, each man having for his wife her with whom he had had dealings at first. The men were not able to learn the language of the Amazons, but the women learned Scythian.&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt;

The King [[Iobates]] sent [[Bellerophon]] against Amazons, hoping that they would kill him, but Bellerophon killed them all.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' vi. 186, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholiast]] ''On [[Lycophron]]'' 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162%3Abook%3DO.%3Apoem%3D13 Pindar, Olympian 13:89]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amazons appear in [[Greek art]] of the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]] and in connection with several Greek legends. The tomb of [[Myrine]] is mentioned in the ''Iliad''; later interpretation made of her an Amazon: according to [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' Book ii.45-46; book iii.52-55&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Diodorus, the Amazons under the rule of Queen Myrina, invaded the lands of the [[Atlantis|Atlantians]]. Amazons defeated the army of the Atlantian city of Cerne, treated the captives savagely, killed all the men, led into slavery the children and women, and razed the city. When the terrible fate of the inhabitants of Cerne became known among the other Atlantians, they were struck with terror, surrendered their cities on terms of capitulation and announced that they would do whatever should be commanded them. Queen Myrina bearing herself honourably towards the Atlantians, established friendship with them and founded a city to bear her name in place of the city of Cerne which had been razed; and in it she settled both the captives and any native who so desired. Atlantians presented her with magnificent presents and by public decree voted to her notable honours, and she in return accepted their courtesy and in addition promised that she would show kindness to their nation. Diodorus also mentions that the Amazons of Queen Myrina used the skins of gigantic snakes, from Libya, to protect themselves at battle. Later Queen Myrine led her Amazons to victory against the [[Gorgons]]. After the battle against the Gorgons, Myrina accorded a funeral to her fallen comrades on three pyres and raised up three great heaps of earth as tombs, which are called "Amazon Mounds" ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀμαζόνων σωρούς}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3D*.html The Library of History of Diodorus Siculus, Book III, 54]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the [[Labours of Hercules|tasks imposed upon Hercules]] by [[Eurystheus]] was to obtain possession of the [[girdle]] of the Amazonian queen [[Hippolyta]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pseudo-Apollodorus]], ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' ii. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' iv. 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] xi. 244&lt;/ref&gt; He was accompanied by his friend [[Theseus]], who carried off the princess [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]], sister of Hippolyta, an incident which led to a retaliatory invasion of [[Attica]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' i. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Theseus'' 26-28&lt;/ref&gt; in which Antiope perished fighting by the side of Theseus.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; In some versions, however, Theseus marries Hippolyta and in others, he marries Antiope and she does not die; by this marriage with the Amazon Theseus had a son [[Hippolytus (son of Theseus)|Hippolytus]]. 
In another version of this myth, Theseus made this voyage on his own account, after the time of Heracles.&lt;ref name="uchicago2"/&gt;
The battle between the Athenians and Amazons is often commemorated in an entire genre of art, [[amazonomachy]], in marble [[bas-relief]]s such as from the [[Parthenon]] or the sculptures of the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]].
[[File:Johann Georg Platzer - Thalestris im Lager Alexander des Großen.jpg|left|thumb|300px|''[[Thalestris]], Queen of the Amazons, visits [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'' by [[Johann Georg Platzer]]]]

[[Plutarch]], in his work [[Parallel Lives]]-The Life of Theseus, mentions that Bion said that the Amazons, were naturally friendly to men, and did not fly from Theseus when he touched upon their coasts.&lt;ref name="uchicago2"/&gt;

Amazons attacked the [[Phrygia]]ns, who were assisted by [[Priam]], then a young man.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' iii. 189&lt;/ref&gt; In his later years, however, towards the end of the [[Trojan War]], his old opponents took his side against the Greeks under their queen [[Penthesilea]] "of [[Thrace|Thracian]] birth", who was slain by [[Achilles]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the ''[[Aethiopis]]'', a continuation of the ''Iliad''. The epic, by [[Arctinus of Miletus]], is lost: only references to it survive.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] i. 699&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Justin (historian)|Justin]] ii.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' i. 490&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' v. 11. § 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Philostratus]] ''Her.'' xix. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The god [[Dionysus]] and his entourage fought the amazons at [[Ephesus]], the Amazons fled to [[Samos]], but Dionysus pursued them and at Samos he killed a great number of them on a spot which was, from that occurrence, called Panaema ({{lang|grc|Πάναιμα}}), which means blood-soaked field.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rboWBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Amazons: Lives and Legends of Warrior Women across the Ancient World]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0216%3Asection%3D56 Plutarch, Quaestiones Graecae, Question 56]&lt;/ref&gt; In another myth Dionysus united with the Amazons to fight against [[Cronus]] and the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3E*.html DIODORUS SICULUS LIBRARY OF HISTORY, Book III, 74]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amazons are also said to have undertaken an expedition against the [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|island of Leuke]], at the mouth of the [[Danube]], where the ashes of Achilles had been deposited by [[Thetis]]. The ghost of the dead hero appeared and so terrified the horses, that they threw and trampled upon the invaders, who were forced to retire. [[Pompey]] is said to have found them in the army of [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

They are heard of in the time of Alexander, when some of the king's biographers make mention of Amazon Queen [[Thalestris]] visiting him and becoming a mother by him (the story is known from the ''[[Alexander Romance]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Greek [[Alexander Romance]], [http://www.attalus.org/translate/alexander3c.html#25 3.25-26]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, several other biographers of Alexander dispute the claim, including the highly regarded [[secondary source]], [[Plutarch]]. In his writing he makes mention of a moment when Alexander's secondary naval commander, [[Onesicritus]], was reading the Amazon passage of his Alexander history to King [[Lysimachus]] of [[Thrace]] who was on the original expedition: the king smiled at him and said "And where was I, then?"&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Alexander'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Alexander*/6-7.html#46 Chapter 46]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman writer [[Virgil]]'s characterization of the [[Volsci]]an warrior maiden [[Camilla (mythology)|Camilla]] in the ''[[Aeneid]]'' borrows heavily from the myth of the Amazons.

[[Jordanes]]' ''[[Getica]]'' ({{circa|560}}), purporting to give the earliest history of the [[Goths]], relates that the Goths' ancestors, descendants of [[Magog (Bible)|Magog]], originally dwelt within Scythia, on the [[Sea of Azov]] between the [[Dnieper]] and [[Don River (Russia)|Don Rivers]]. After a few centuries, following an incident where the Goths' women successfully fended off a raid by a neighboring tribe, while the menfolk were off campaigning against Pharaoh [[Vesosis]], the women formed their own army under [[Marpesia]] and crossed the Don, invading Asia. Her sister [[Lampedo]] remained in Europe to guard the homeland. They procreated with men once a year. These Amazons conquered Armenia, Syria, and all of Asia Minor, even reaching [[Ionia]] and [[Aeolis|Aeolia]], holding this vast territory for 100 years. Jordanes also mentions that they fought with Hercules, and in the Trojan War, and that a smaller contingent of them endured in the Caucasus Mountains until the time of Alexander. He mentions by name the Queens Menalippe, Hippolyta, and Penthesilea.

In the Grottaferrata Version of ''[[Digenes Akritas]]'', the twelfth century medieval epic of Basil, the Greek-Syrian knight of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] frontier, the hero battles with and kills the female warrior Maximo.

* She was descended from some Amazons.
* Taken by Alexander from the Brahmans.&lt;ref&gt;''Digenis Akritas: the Two-Blood Border Lord'', translated by Denison B. Hull, 1972, Ohio University Press, G-vi, 385-387, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several (conflicting) lists of names of Amazons.
* [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]], ''[[Posthomerica]]'' I&lt;/ref&gt; lists the attendant warriors of Penthesilea: "Clonie was there, Polemusa, Derinoe, Evandre, and [[Antandre]], and [[Bremusa]], [[Hippothoe]], dark-eyed Harmothoe, [[Alcibie]], Derimacheia, Antibrote, and Thermodosa glorying with the spear."
* [[Diodorus Siculus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' IV. 16&lt;/ref&gt; lists twelve Amazons who challenged Heracles to single combat during his quest for Hippolyta's girdle and died against him one by one: [[Aella (Amazon)|Aella]], Philippis, Prothoe, Eriboea, [[Celaeno]], Eurybia, [[Phoebe (mythological characters)|Phoebe]], Deianeira, [[Asteria (mythology)|Asteria]], Marpe, Tecmessa, Alcippe. After Alcippe's death, a group attack followed. Diodorus also mentions [[Myrina (mythology)|Myrina]] as a queen of the Amazons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3D*.html The Library of History of Diodorus Siculus, Book III]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another list of Amazons' names is found in [[Hyginus]]' ''Fabulae''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 163&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Hippolyta]], [[Otrera]], [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]] and [[Penthesilea]], it attests the following names: Ocyale, Dioxippe, Iphinome, Xanthe, [[Hippothoe]], Laomache, [[Glauce]], [[Agave (mythology)|Agave]], Theseis, Clymene, Polydora.
* Yet another different set of names is found in [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus|Valerius Flaccus]]' ''Argonautica'':&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Valerius Flaccus|Valerius Flaccus]], ''[http://www.theoi.com/Text/ValeriusFlaccus1.html Argonautica]'', 6. 370-377&lt;/ref&gt; he mentions Euryale, Harpe, Lyce, Menippe and Thoe. Of these Lyce also appears in a fragment preserved in the ''[[Latin Anthology]]'' where she is said to have killed the hero Clonus of [[Moesia]], son of Doryclus, with her javelin.&lt;ref name="Latin Anthology" /&gt;
* [[John Tzetzes]] in ''Posthomerica''&lt;ref&gt;[[Tzetzes]], ''Posthomerica'', 176-183&lt;/ref&gt; enumerates the Amazons who fell at [[Troy]]: Hippothoe, Antianeira, Toxophone, Toxoanassa, Gortyessa, Iodoce, Pharetre, Andro, Ioxeia, Oïstrophe, Androdaïxa, Aspidocharme, Enchesimargos, Cnemis, Thorece, Chalcaor, Eurylophe, Hecate, Anchimache, Andromache the queen. Concerning Antianeira and Andromache, see below; for almost all the other names on the list, this is a unique attestation.
* [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] provides an alternate list of the Amazons who fell against Heracles, describing them as "the most prominent" of their people: Tralla, Isocrateia, Thiba, Palla, Coea (Koia), Coenia (Koinia).&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]], s. v. ''Thibaïs''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eustathius of Thessalonica|Eustathius]] gives the same list minus the last two names.&lt;ref&gt;Eustathius on [[Dionysius Periegetes]], 828&lt;/ref&gt; Both Stephanus and Eustathius write of these Amazons in connection with the placename Thibais, which they report to have been derived from Thiba's name.

Other names of Amazons from various sources include:

* [[Aegea]], queen of the Amazons who was thought by some to have been the [[eponym]] of the [[Aegean Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sextus Pompeius Festus]], s. v. ''Aegeum Mare''&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ainia, presumably accompanied [[Penthesilea]] to the [[Trojan War]], killed by [[Achilles]]; known only from an Attic terracotta relief fragment.&lt;ref&gt;New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art 42.11.33, c. 600. ''LIMC'', "Achilleus" no. 720*.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ainippe, an Amazon who confronted [[Telamon]] in the battle against Heracles' troops.&lt;ref name="Perseus Digital Library - Description of the Tyrrhenian amphora" /&gt;
* Alce, who was said to have killed the young Oebalus of [[Arcadia]], son of Ida (otherwise unknown), with her spear during the Parthian War.&lt;ref name="Latin Anthology"&gt;''[[Latin Anthology]]'', 392 (''Traiani Imperatoris e Bello Parthico versus decori''), ed. Riese&lt;/ref&gt;
* Amastris, who was believed to be the [[eponym]] of the city previously known as Kromna,&lt;ref&gt;[[Demosthenes]] in [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] s. v. Amastris&lt;/ref&gt; although the city was actually named after the historical [[Amastrine|Amastris]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], ''Geography'', 12. 3. 11&lt;/ref&gt;
* Anaea, an Amazon whose tomb was shown at the island of [[Samos]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]] s. v. Anaia&lt;/ref&gt;
* Andromache, an Amazon who fought Heracles and was defeated; only known from vase paintings.&lt;ref name="Perseus Digital Library - Description of the Tyrrhenian amphora"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?name=Boston%2098.916&amp;object=Vase |title=Perseus Digital Library - Description of the Tyrrhenian amphora |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date=1990-01-24 |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/image?img=Perseus:image:1990.24.0349|title=Perseus:image:1990.24.0349|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not to be confused with [[Andromache]], wife of [[Hector]].

* Clete, one of the twelve followers of Penthesilea. After Penthesilea's death she, in accord with the former's will, sailed off and eventually landed in Italy, founding the city of [[Clete]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tzetzes]] on [[Lycophron]], 995&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cyme, who gave her name to the city of [[Cyme (Aeolis)]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]], s. v. Kyme&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Diodorus Siculus, ''Library of History'', 3. 55" /&gt;

''Kynna''. Stephanus does not write out the Amazon's name, simply stating that the town Cynna could have been named "after one of the Amazons".&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ephesos, a [[Lydia]]n Amazon, after whom the city of [[Ephesus]] was thought to have been named; she was also said to have been the first to honor [[Artemis]] and to have surnamed the goddess ''Ephesia''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Etymologicum Magnum]]'' 402. 8, under ''Ephesos''&lt;/ref&gt; Her daughter Amazo was thought of as the eponym of the Amazons.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]], s. v.

===Hero cults===
According to ancient sources ([[Plutarch]], [[Theseus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:BiDerPMT15YJ:classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/theseus.html+Amazon+statues+in+Scotussa&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=4 |title=The Internet Classics Archive &amp;#124; Theseus by Plutarch |publisher=Google.com |date=2010-09-02 |accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]), Amazon tombs could be found frequently throughout what was once known as the ancient Greek world. Some are found in [[Megara]], [[Athens]], [[Chaeronea]], [[Chalcis]], [[Thessaly]] at [[Skotousa]], in [[Cynoscephalae (Thessaly)|Cynoscephalae]], and statues of Amazons are all over Greece. [[Stephanus of Byzantium]], quoting [[Ephorus]], mention that the tomb of the amazon Anaea ({{lang|grc|Ἀναία}}) was at the city of [[Söke|Anaea]] ({{lang|grc|Ἄναια}}), which also has this name after the amazon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Mary Bennett| first = Florence | title = Religious Cults Associated With the Amazons| url = http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/rca/rca02.htm| publisher = Forgotten Books |date= December 2007 | isbn = 978-1605063867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At both Chalcis and Athens, [[Plutarch]] tells us that there was an Amazoneum or shrine of Amazons that implied the presence of both tombs and cult. At the entrance of Athens there was a monument to the Amazon [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D2 Pausanias, Description of Greece]&lt;/ref&gt; On the day before the Thesea at Athens there were annual sacrifices to the Amazons. In historical times Greek maidens of [[Ephesus]] performed an annual circular dance with weapons and shields that had been established by [[Hippolyta]] and her Amazons. They had initially set up wooden statues of [[Artemis]], a ''bretas'' ([[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ({{floruit|{{circa|AD 160}}}}): ''Description of Greece'', Book I: Attica).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/pausanias-bk1.html |title=Ancient History Sourcebook: Pausanias: Description of Greece, Book I: Attica |publisher=Fordham.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In art===
[[File:Gladiatrix relief.jpg|thumb|left|Two [[female gladiator]]s with their names ''Amazonia and Achillea''.]]

In works of art, battles between Amazons and Greeks are placed on the same level as – and often associated with – battles of Greeks and [[centaur]]s. The belief in their existence, however, having been once accepted and introduced into the national poetry and art, it became necessary to surround them as far as possible with the appearance of natural beings. Amazons were therefore depicted in the manner of Scythian or Sarmatian horsemen. Their occupation was hunting and war; their arms the bow, spear, axe, a half shield, nearly in the shape of a crescent, called ''pelta'', and in early art a helmet. The model in the Greek mind had apparently been the goddess [[Athena]]. In later art they approach the model of Artemis, wearing a thin dress, girt high for speed; while on the later painted vases their dress is often peculiarly [[Iran|Persian]] – that is, close-fitting trousers and a high cap called the ''kidaris''. They were usually on horseback but sometimes on foot.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;
This depiction of Amazons demonstrates just how closely, in the Greek mind, the Amazons were linked to the Scythians. Their manner of dress has been noted to bear a striking similarity to the traditional dress of nomadic peoples from the Crimea to Mongolia.&lt;ref name="amaz"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/previous_seasons/case_amazon/clues.html |title=SECRETS OF THE DEAD . Amazon Warrior Women. Clues and Evidence |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amazons were described by Herodotus as wearing trousers and having tall stiff caps.{{cn|date=March 2018}} The double-sided axe was the most emblematic of their weapons.&lt;ref name="Wonder Woman"/&gt; Amazons can also be identified in vase paintings by the fact that they are wearing one earring. The battle between Theseus and the Amazons ([[Amazonomachy]]) is a favourite subject on the friezes of temples (e.g. the reliefs from the frieze of the [[Temple of Apollo at Bassae]], now in the [[British Museum]]), vases and sarcophagus reliefs; at [[Athens]] it was represented on the shield of the statue of [[Athena Parthenos]], on wall-paintings in the [[Theseum]] and in the ''[[Stoa Poikile]]''.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; There were also three standard [[Amazon statue types]].

Later in the [[The Renaissance|Renaissance]], as Amazon myth evolved, artists started to depict warrior women in a new light. [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] was often thought of as an Amazon-like warrior during her reign and was sometimes depicted as such.&lt;!-- really? Examples? --&gt; Though, as explained in ''Divinia Viagro'' by Winfried Schleiner, Celeste T. Wright "has given a detailed account of the bad press Amazons had in the Renaissance (with respect to their unwomanly conduct and Scythian cruelty). She notes that she has not found any Elizabethans comparing the queen directly to an Amazon, and suggests that they might have hesitated to do so because of the association of Amazons with enfranchisement of women, which was considered contemptible."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = "Divina Virago": Queen Elizabeth as an Amazon|jstor = 4173965|journal = Studies in Philology|date = 1978-04-01|pages = 163–180|volume = 75|issue = 2|first = Winfried|last = Schleiner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Paul Rubens]] and [[Jan Brueghel the Elder|Jan Brueghel]] depicted the Battle of the Amazons around 1598, showing many attributes of Renaissance-styled paintings. Amazons also appear in the [[Rococo]] period in another painting titled ''Battle of the Amazons'' by [[Johann Georg Platzer]]. As a part of the Romantic period revival, German artist [[Anselm Feuerbach]] painted the Amazons as well. His paintings “engendered all the aspirations of the Romantics: their desire to transcend the boundaries of the ego and of the known world; their interest in the occult in nature and in the soul; their search for a national identity, and the ensuing search for the mythic origins of the Germanic nation; finally, their wish to escape the harsh realities of the present through immersion in an idealized past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = German masters of the nineteenth century : paintings and drawings from the Federal Republic of Germany / The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York :: Metropolitan Museum of Art Publications|url = http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/71300|website = libmma.contentdm.oclc.org|accessdate = 2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;”

==In historiography==
[[File:S03 06 01 020 image 2552.jpg|thumbnail|Amazon in combat, infl. Polyclitus, Rome. Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection]]
[[Herodotus]] reported that the Sarmatians were descendants of Amazons and Scythians, and that their wives observed their ancient maternal customs, "frequently hunting on horseback with their husbands; in war taking the field; and wearing the very same dress as the men". Moreover, said Herodotus, "No girl shall wed till she has killed a man in battle". In the story related by Herodotus, a group of Amazons was blown across the [[Sea of Azov|Maeotian Lake]] (the [[Sea of Azov]]) into [[Scythia]] near the cliff region (today's southeastern [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]]). After learning the Scythian language, they agreed to marry Scythian men, on the condition that they not be required to follow the customs of Scythian women. According to Herodotus, this band moved toward the northeast, settling beyond the [[Don River (Russia)|Tanais]] ([[Don River (Russia)|Don]]) river, and became the ancestors of the [[Sarmatians|Sauromatians]]. According to Herodotus, the [[Sarmatians]] fought with the Scythians against [[Darius the Great]] in the 5th century BC.

Hippocrates describes them as: "They have no right breasts...for while they are yet babies their mothers make red-hot a bronze instrument constructed for this very purpose and apply it to the right breast and cauterize it, so that its growth is arrested, and all its strength and bulk are diverted to the right shoulder and right arm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekFeb2011&amp;query=Hipp.%20Aer.%2017&amp;getid=2|title=Perseus Under Philologic: Hipp. Aer. 17|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amazons came to play a role in [[Roman historiography]]. Caesar reminded the Senate of the conquest of large parts of Asia by [[Semiramis]] and the Amazons. Successful Amazon raids against Lycia and Cilicia contrasted with effective resistance by Lydian cavalry against the invaders ([[Strabo]] 5.504; Nicholas Damascenus). [[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus]] pays particularly detailed attention to the Amazons. The story of the Amazons as deriving from a Cappadocian colony of two Scythian princes Ylinos and Scolopetos is due to him. [[Pliny the Elder]] records some surprising facts pointing to the valley of the [[Terme River]] as possibly being their home: a mountain named for them (the modern Mason Dagi), as well as a settlement Amazonium; Herodotus (VI.86) first mentions their capital [[Themiscyra (Pontus)|Themiscyra]], which Pliny locates near the Terme.&lt;ref&gt;[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]] VI.3.10&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philostratus]] places the Amazons in the [[Taurus Mountains]]. [[Ammianus Marcellinus|Ammianus]] places them east of [[Tanais]], as neighbouring the [[Alans]]. [[Procopius]] places them in the Caucasus. [[Diodorus Siculus]] (''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' III, chapter 52) mentioned that besides [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] Amazons existed much older race (at that time entirely disappeared) of Amazons from western [[Ancient Libya|Libya]], and retells their mythological story which includes [[Atlantis]] and Greek mythology.

Although Strabo shows skepticism as to their historicity, the Amazons in general continue to be taken as historical throughout Late Antiquity. Several Church Fathers speak of the Amazons as of a real people. [[Gaius Julius Solinus|Solinus]] embraces the account of Pliny. Under [[Aurelianus]], captured [[Goths|Gothic]] women were identified as Amazons ([[Claudian]]us). The account of [[Justin (historian)|Justinus]] was influential, and was used as a source by [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]] who continued to be read during the European Middle Ages. Medieval authors thus continue the tradition of locating the Amazons in the North, [[Adam of Bremen]] placing them at the [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Paulus Diaconus]] in the heart of Germania.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. A. Ukert]], ''Die Amazonen'', Abhandlungen der philosophisch-philologischen Classe der Königlich Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften (1849), 63..&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval and Renaissance literature==
[[File:Dahomey amazon1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dahomey Amazons]] were so named by Western observers due to their similarity to the mythical Amazons]]

Amazons continued to be discussed by authors of the European Renaissance, and with the [[Age of Exploration]], they were located in ever more remote areas. In 1542, [[Francisco de Orellana]] reached the [[Amazon River]] (''Amazonas'' in Spanish), naming it after a tribe of warlike women he claimed to have encountered and fought on the [[Nhamundá River]], a tributary of the Amazon.&lt;ref&gt;It has been suggested that what Orellana actually engaged was an especially warlike tribe of Native Americans whose warrior men had long hair and thus appeared to him as women. See Theobaldo Miranda Santos, ''Lendas e mitos do Brasil'' ("Brazil's legends and myths"), Companhia Editora Nacional, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards the whole basin and region of the Amazon (''Amazônia'' in Portuguese, ''Amazonía'' in Spanish) were named after the river. Amazons also figure in the accounts of both [[Christopher Columbus]] and [[Walter Raleigh]].&lt;ref&gt;Ukert (1849), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Famous medieval traveller [[John Mandeville]] mentions them in his book:

{{quote|Beside the land of Chaldea is the land of Amazonia, that is the land of Feminye. And in that realm is all woman and no man; not as some may say, that men may not live there, but for because that the women will not suffer no men amongst them to be their sovereigns.&lt;ref&gt;''The Travels of Sir John Mandeville'', Dover publications, Mineola, New York, 2006, cap. XVII, p. 103-104&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Medieval and Renaissance authors credit the Amazons with the invention of the [[Corded Ware culture|battle-axe]]. This is probably related to the ''[[sagaris]]'', an axe-like weapon associated with both Amazons and Scythian tribes by Greek authors (see also [[Thracian tomb of Aleksandrovo kurgan]]). [[Paulus Hector Mair]] expresses astonishment that such a "manly weapon" should have been invented by a "tribe of women", but he accepts the attribution out of respect for his authority, [[Johannes Aventinus]].

[[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' contains a country of warrior women, ruled by Queen Orontea; the epic describes an origin much like that in Greek myth, in that the women, abandoned by a band of warriors and unfaithful lovers, rallied together to form a nation from which men were severely reduced, to prevent them from regaining power. The Amazons and Queen Hippolyta are also referenced in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'' in "[[The Knight's Tale]]".

==Historical background==
[[Classics|Classicist]] Peter Walcot wrote, "Wherever the Amazons are located by the Greeks, whether it is somewhere along the Black Sea in the distant north-east, or in Libya in the furthest south, it is always beyond the confines of [[Civilization|the civilized world]]. The Amazons exist outside the range of normal human experience."&lt;ref&gt;P. Walcot, "Greek Attitudes towards Women: The Mythological Evidence" ''Greece &amp; Rome''2nd Series 31.1 (April 1984, pp. 37-47) p 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, there are various proposals for a historical nucleus of the Amazons of Greek historiography, the most obvious candidates being historical [[Scythia]] and [[Sarmatia]] in line with the account by [[Herodotus]], but some authors prefer a comparison to cultures of Asia Minor or even [[Minoan Crete]].

==Archaeology==
===Scythians and Sarmatians===
Speculation that the idea of Amazons contains a core of reality is based on archaeological findings from burials, pointing to the possibility that some Sarmatian women may have participated in battle. These findings have led scholars to suggest that the Amazonian legend in [[Greek mythology]] may have been "inspired by real warrior women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoa.org/diotima/essays/wilde.shtml |title=Lyn Webster Wilde, "Did the Amazons really exist?" '&amp;#39;Diotima'&amp;#39; |publisher=Stoa.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of high-ranking warrior women comes from [[kurgan]]s in southern Ukraine and Russia.
David Anthony notes, "About 20% of [[Scythians|Scythian]]-[[Sarmatian]] 'warrior graves' on the lower [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] and lower [[Volga river|Volga]] contained women dressed for battle similar to how men dress, a phenomenon that probably inspired the Greek tales about the Amazons."&lt;ref name="anthonyd"&gt;{{cite book| last = Anthony| first = David W.| title = The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World| url = https://books.google.com/?id=mTxQmQEACAAJ| year = 2007| publisher = Princeton University Press| isbn = 0-691-05887-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amazone Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2342.jpg|thumb|Mounted Amazon in [[Scythia]]n costume, on an [[Attica|Attic]] red-figure vase, {{circa}}420 BC]]
Up to 25% of military burials were of armed Sarmatian women usually including bows.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoa.org/diotima/essays/wilde.shtml |title=Diotima |publisher=Stoa.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian archaeologist Vera Kovalevskaya points out that when Scythian men were away fighting or hunting, nomadic women would have to be able to defend themselves, their animals and pasture-grounds competently. During the time that the Scythians advanced into Asia and achieved near-[[hegemony]] in the Near East, there was a period of twenty-eight years when the men would have been away on campaigns for long periods. During this time the women would not only have had to defend themselves, but to reproduce, and this could well be the origin of the idea that Amazons mated once a year with their neighbours, if Herodotus actually based his accounts on fact.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

Before modern archaeology uncovered some of the Scythian burials of warrior-maidens entombed under [[kurgan]]s in the region of [[Altai Mountains]] and Sarmatia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeology.org/9701/abstracts/sarmatians.html "Warrior Women of Eurasia"], Archaeology Magazine (Abstract) Volume 50 Number 1, January/February 1997 Retrieved 7/10/08.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;In a recent excavation of [[Sarmatian]] sites by Dr. Jeannine Davis-Kimball,{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} a tomb was found wherein female warriors were buried.&lt;/ref&gt; giving concrete form at last to the Greek tales, the origin of the Amazon story had been the subject of speculation among classics scholars. In the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']] speculation ranged along the following lines:

{{quote|While some regard the Amazons as a purely mythical people, others assume an historical foundation for them. The deities worshipped by them were [[Ares]] (who is consistently assigned to them as a god of war, and as a god of [[Thrace|Thracian]] and generally northern origin) and [[Artemis]], not the usual Greek goddess of that name, but an Asiatic deity in some respects her equivalent. It is conjectured that the Amazons were originally the temple-servants and priestesses (''hierodulae'') of this goddess; and that the removal of the breast corresponded with the self-mutilation of the god [[Attis]] and the [[galli]], Roman priests of [[Cybele|Rhea Cybele]]. Another theory is that, as the knowledge of geography extended, travellers brought back reports of tribes ruled entirely by women, who carried out the duties which elsewhere were regarded as peculiar to man, in whom alone the rights of nobility and inheritance were vested, and who had the supreme control of affairs. Hence arose the belief in the Amazons as a nation of female warriors, organized and governed entirely by women. According to J. Viirtheim (''De Ajacis'' origine, 1907), the Amazons were of Greek origin [...] It has been suggested that the fact of the conquest of the Amazons being assigned to the two famous heroes of Greek mythology, Heracles and Theseus [...] shows that they were mythical illustrations of the dangers which beset the Greeks on the coasts of Asia Minor; rather perhaps, it may be intended to represent the conflict between the Greek culture of the colonies on the [[Black Sea|Euxine]] and the barbarism of the native inhabitants.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;}}

===Minoan Crete===
[[File:Departure of the Amazons MET DP318355.jpg|thumb|''Departure of the Amazons'', by [[Claude Deruet]], 1620]]

When [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] archeology was still in its infancy, nevertheless, a theory raised in an essay regarding the Amazons contributed by [[Lewis Richard Farnell]] and [[John Myres]] to [[Robert Ranulph Marett]]'s ''Anthropology and the Classics'' (1908),&lt;ref&gt;L.R. Farnell and J.L. Myres, "Herodotus and anthropology" in [[Robert Ranulph Marett|Robert R. Marett]] ''Anthropology and the Classics'' 1908, pp. 138ff.&lt;/ref&gt; placed their possible origins in Minoan civilization, drawing attention to overlooked similarities between the two cultures. According to Myres,&lt;ref&gt;(pp.&amp;nbsp;153 ff)&lt;/ref&gt; the tradition interpreted in the light of evidence furnished by supposed Amazon cults seems to have been very similar and may have even originated in Minoan culture. &lt;!--The following is a "hard sell" for an outdated idea: "The theory that the Amazons originally represented Minoan Crete's women has a strong case based on what [[archeologists]] and historians have been discovering about Minoan culture. Out of all the ancient civilizations which are so far known to archaeologists and historians the Minoans seem to fit most of the aspects that classical Greeks and later scholars have come to associate with the Amazonian culture."--&gt;

==Modern legacy==

[[Francisco de Orellana]] gave the [[Amazon river]] its name after reporting pitched battles with tribes of female warriors, whom he likened to the Amazons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/place/Amazon-River Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Samsun]] in modern-day [[Turkey]] features a recently constructed "Amazon Village" museum, created to bring attention to the legacy of the Amazons and to generate both academic interest and popular tourism.&lt;ref name="todayszaman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?load=detay&amp;link=212625 |title=Village of Amazons to be recreated in Samsun park - Today's Zaman, your gateway to Turkish daily news |publisher=Todayszaman.com |date=2010-06-10 |accessdate=2014-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201214800/http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?load=detay&amp;link=212625 |archivedate=2014-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A festival is also held every year in the [[Terme]] district of [[Samsun Province]] to celebrate the Amazons.&lt;ref name="todayszaman" /&gt;

In Greece, female [[equestrians]] are also called "Amazons" ({{lang-el|Αμαζόνες}}).

Amazons became an important subject of the fine arts around 1900, especially in the work of the Munich painter and sculptor [[Franz Stuck]] (1863-1928). 

In Nazi-Germany open air events called "Nacht der Amazonen" ([[Night of the Amazons]]) were performed at [[Nymphenburg Palace]] in [[Munich]] between 1936 and 1939. These revues with bare-breasted girls presented an allegedly emancipated female role as part of the „new race“ intended to be realized by racial fanatics.

*In [[Ukraine]] Katerina Tarnovska leads a group called the Asgarda which claims to be a new tribe of Amazons.&lt;ref name="pri.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pri.org/stories/politics-society/social-justice/ukraine%E2%80%99s-asgarda-martial-arts-program-recasts-amazon-warrior-women-13825.html |title=Ukraine’s Asgarda martial arts program recasts Amazon warrior women &amp;#124; Public Radio International |publisher=Pri.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarnovska believes that the Amazons are the direct ancestors of Ukrainian women, and she has created an all-female martial art for her group, based on another form of fighting called [[Combat Hopak]], but with a special emphasis on self-defense.&lt;ref name="pri.org"/&gt;

The '''International Joint Conference on Biomedical Engineering Systems and Technologies''' -  '''BIOSTEC''' -  is an international joint conference composed of five co-located conferences each specialized in a different knowledge area:

* Biomedical Electronics and Devices – [http://www.biodevices.biostec.org/ BIODEVICES]
* Bioimaging – [http://www.bioimaging.biostec.org/ BIOIMAGING]
* Bioinformatics Models, Methods and Algorithms – [http://www.bioinformatics.biostec.org/ BIOINFORMATICS]
* Bio-inspired Systems and Signal Processing – [http://www.biosignals.biostec.org/ BIOSIGNALS]
* Health Informatics – [http://www.healthinf.biostec.org/ HEALTHINF]

This joint conference is held annually and it seems to be interested in the dissemination of the novelties in the topics covered by its sub-conferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diaz Lantada|first1=Andres|title=Handbook on Advanced Design and Manufacturing Technologies for Biomedical Devices|date=Jul 8, 2014|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn= 9781461467892|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3D4fBfOLHXYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BIOSTEC had its first edition in 2008 counting with the participation of some keynote speakers like [[Kevin Warwick]]. Since then, several names have been invited to deliver keynotes to the BIOSTEC attendees.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biostec.org/PreviousInvitedSpeakers.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Among them: David Rose ([[MIT Media Lab]], United States), [[Bradley Nelson]], ([[ETH Zurich]], Switzerland), [[Edward H. Shortliffe]], ([[Arizona State University]], United States), José C. Príncipe ([[University of Florida]], United States), Alberto Cliquet Jr ([[University of São Paulo]] &amp; [[University of Campinas]], Brazil), Tanja Schultz ([[University of Bremen]], Germany) e [[Vimla L. Patel]], ([[Arizona State University]], United States).

Besides the presentation of invited talks, the BIOSTEC conferences are composed by different kind of sessions like [[poster session]]s, technical sessions, [[tutorials]], [[special session]]s, [[workshops]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Workshop on Mobilizing Health Information to Support Healthcare-related Knowledge Work: 1st MobiHealthInf 2009 Porto 16th January|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HAsdMwEACAAJ&amp;dq=BIOSTEC&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjrgrLZ-7bPAhWBkRQKHa-qBf04ChDoAQgfMAE|publisher=INSTICC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Karjalainen|first1=Pasi|title=Bio-inspired Human-machine Interfaces and Healthcare Applications: Proceedings of the 1st International Workshop on Bio-Inspired Human-Machine Interfaces and Healthcare Applications, B-Interface 2010|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wBujmwEACAAJ&amp;dq=BIOSTEC&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjrgrLZ-7bPAhWBkRQKHa-qBf04ChDoAQgiMAI|publisher=INSTICC Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; doctoral consortiums, panels and industrial tracks.

== Faculty ==
Since its establishment over 50 years ago, more than 30,000 Chinese and a number of foreign students have graduated from Beijing Forestry University. Of that number, 11 have attained the position of [[academician]]. The university faculty consists of 956 full-time teachers, including five academicians and 496 full and associate professors. While upholding traditional disciplines, the university has also established a large number of new disciplines to meet society's needs. The university consists of 15 schools; the [[graduate school]], [[biological science]] and technology, [[landscape architecture]], [[forestry]], [[environmental science]] and engineering, [[soil and water conservation]], industry, [[information science]], [[material science and technology]], [[science]], [[Conservation movement|conservation]], economic management, [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]], [[foreign languages]], [[vocational training]] and [[continuing education]].

The university features a computer center, a computer network center, an educational center, an audio-visual teaching center, a biological center, a micro-technology center, a forest-organism center and a tree farm for teaching and research (the Jiu Feng National Forest Park). Attached to the university are the Foreign-Language Training Center of the State Forestry Administration, the Research Center of Soil Control Technology of Loess Plateau in China and the Training Center of Desertification Control of China. BFU is a well-equipped institution, featuring the Central Building of Teaching, a gymnasium, laboratories, and a high-speed campus network. A computerized checking system exists for library books, and also in the library building is the Imported Teaching Materials Center for forestry universities and colleges nationwide. Construction of a high-rise student apartment building and a new classroom building was completed in 2001.

In recent years, nearly 200 discoveries in scientific research received awards from national, provincial and ministerial authorities, and more than 20 achievements of teaching were rewarded by the national and municipal governments. BFU is engaged in international academic exchanges and cooperation with more than 150 universities and research institutions in over 20 countries, providing opportunities for contacts between China and the outside world in the fields of forestry and environmental studies.

BFU provides an atmosphere for teaching and learning, combining the acquisition of professional knowledge with an improvement of all-round abilities (with an emphasis on forging a rigorous, creative academic style). Systems of optional courses, subsidiary courses, course exemption, and bachelor-to-master continuing education have been established so students may develop according to their own interests and desires. The university also offers extracurricular activities to enrich campus life; these are organized by student societies and associations in fields including science and technology, art, sports, environmental protection, and politics. Some groups have become influential, including the Society of Scientific Exploration and Wilderness Survival and the Association of Beijing College Volunteers for Environmental Protection. The former received the Prize of the Earth, the top prize from the National Bureau of Environmental Protection. In recent years, BFU students of BFU won four consecutive prizes at the College Students' Landscape Gardening Architecture Design Competitions (sponsored by UNESCO and the International Association of Landscape Gardening Architects), the Golden Prize in International College Students' Architecture Design and prizes in garden-design competitions. Achievements were also earned in domestic competitions for scientific inventions, mathematics, and art.

In order to separate food from emotion, clients eat the same healthy meals every day for two weeks at a time, consisting of breakfast followed by small meals every two-to-three hours.&lt;ref name="nsaidi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="khackett"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mensfitness.com/training/trainer-spotlight-charles-dangelo “Trainer Spotlight: Charles D’Angelo,”] ''[[Men’s Fitness]]''.

==Plot==
{{plot|date=August 2016}}
Students at [[Steinmetz High School]] are less than enthusiastic about anything in the classroom, except for Jolie Fitch, a junior who enjoys Dr. Jerry Plecki's English class and is involved heavily in all discussions, especially on his favorite book ''Paradise Lost''. Dr. Plecki is offered the position of Academic Decathlon coach, a job all the other teachers consider to be a waste of time for them as well as the students. Dr. Plecki holds an open call for the students after class, but no one arrives to participate. He is about to leave for the day when Jolie comes in and convinces him that he needs to look for the smarter students and recruit them. He succeeds in recruiting seven students (Darius, Matt, Paul, Dominik, Irwin, Agnieska, and Jolie). They spend the next few months studying hard for the regional competition. 

At regionals, the team faces their biggest competitor in [[Whitney Young Magnet High School]], who have consistently won the regional and state competitions for almost a decade. As expected, Whitney Young is victorious and Steinmetz places 5th overall, but still high enough to qualify for the state competition. Overwhelmed by the thought of facing Whitney Young in the next round, the students begin to feel that the whole decathlon is a waste of their time. However, an opportunity arises when Matt's friend steals a copy of the test for the state finals and gives it to him. Irwin then brings it to Dr. Plecki, who feels that using the test is the team's best chance to defeat Whitney Young at state. 

After some persuasion, all seven members agree to dismiss their conflicting feelings about cheating and begin copying the answers on various items (calculators, shoes, a piece of gum, etc.). Dr. Plecki then tells Irwin privately that because he had the lowest scores in the group, he will be out of the state competition; however, he will be guaranteed a spot in nationals. Though Irwin is upset by the news, he agrees to go along with it.

At the state finals, a much more confident Steinmetz meets Whitney Young again. The team successfully gets through the exams with the answers they secretly wrote down and with Jolie coaching them in the Super Quiz. At the end of the day, Steinmetz wins the state finals with an overall score of 49,000, raising the ire and suspicions of Whitney Young who resolve to investigate.

As Steinmetz celebrates their victory, a spiteful Irwin writes an essay, detailing how he feels betrayed by Dr. Plecki and how they received an advance copy of the test. Suspicions heighten when the essay is turned in to the principal, who questions Irwin about the truth of his writing. The Illinois Academic Decathlon board arrives at the school with news that the team will need to take a re-test to validate their scores, noting that their state score was nearly 10,000 points higher than their regional score. If they refuse, they will lose their championship. Feeling betrayed by Irwin and angered by the board's ultimatum, they refuse to cooperate and plan to seek an injunction to halt the state from re-testing them.

As the media siege becomes more and more brutal, Angela Lam, a student on the Academic Decathlon team from the year before, talks to the press about how she was given the answers to the Super Quiz in the state competition by Dr. Plecki. She encourages the current team members to come clean if they cheated. Dr. Plecki is immediately suspended from his teaching duties and the team members are taken to the Board of Education headquarters where they are interrogated individually. Despite being pressured, they refuse to come clean and insist they did not cheat. However, Dominik ultimately breaks and confesses after a heart-to-heart talk with one of the investigators.

As a result, the state title is stripped from Steinmetz and awarded to Whitney Young. Dr. Plecki is fired from Steinmetz High School, and the team members are harassed by the other students for ruining their reputation. Dr. Plecki decides to leave Chicago in hopes the media will disperse and leave the team members alone. Before he leaves, he meets with his team one last time by Lake Michigan in downtown Chicago. The students present him with a gift: John Milton's book ''Paradise Lost'' signed by the team and the gold medal in Language and Literature that they didn't return to the board. With the team disbanded and Dr. Plecki gone, Jolie feels that she's lost a mentor that actually cared about her academic possibilities and her team that supported each other. In the end, Jolie gets accepted into college as the admissions board believed that her experience on the Academic Decathlon team allowed her to build character, and recognizes the merit of her achievements without cheating.

In the epilogue, it is stated that Dominik, Agneiska, and Paul went off to college, Matt worked in a warehouse, Darius' whereabouts are unknown, Irwin went to college to become a journalist, and Dr. Plecki started a business.

As a result of the 1995 cheating scandal, Steinmetz High School was banned from fielding an Academic Decathlon team for ten years. They returned to the competition in 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2531">A '''community project''' is a term applied to any [[community]]-based project. This covers a wide variety of different areas within a community or a group of [[Social network|network]]ing entities. Projects can cover almost anything, including the most obvious section of concern to any community, the [[welfare]] element. Welfare community projects would for example be, a locally run and locally funded orphanage; a Christmas dinner kitchen for the homeless. Another important sector of importance to the community would be [[charity (practice)|charity]]. Charitable projects in the community can include, but are not limited to, [[ecological]] charities concerned with either the maintenance of [[Urban open space|green spaces]], or in some cases, the prevention of the reduction/removal of green spaces. An old [[clothes collection]] service would also be a community-based charity project. One important subdivision of community projects, and at times overlooked, is those of an economic nature such as [[LETS]]. The highlight of economic community projects is what is known as [[Transition Towns]]. Most economic community projects are designed at creating some sort of economic [[autonomy]].

It begins when a small collection of motivated individuals within a community come together with a shared concern: ''how can our community respond to the challenges, and opportunities, of [[peak oil]] and [[climate change]]?''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.transitiontowns.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope and size==
All community projects are different in some way; the size and scope of these projects is determined firstly by the community they cater to.

According to the definition of a community,&lt;ref&gt;{{wiktionary-inline|community}}&lt;/ref&gt; a community could be the entire [[human race]] or parts of it anywhere on the planet. However, because of phenomena like [[distance decay]] or [[demographic]] factors such as age group, gender and income that determine [[social identity]] of [[social group|groups]], the extent of community-based projects is usually much more limited.

==Including the input and opinions of the people that will be directly affected, will result in a better outcome and support from the community. This is a positive way to change prevailing relationships in a system.==

'''Edsger Wybe Dijkstra''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|aɪ|k|s|t|r|ə}}; {{IPA-nl|ˈɛtsxər ˈʋibə ˈdɛikstra|lang|Dijkstra.ogg|lang}}; 11 May 1930 – 6 August 2002) was a Dutch [[systems scientist]], [[computer programmer|programmer]], [[software engineer]], science [[essayist]],&lt;ref&gt;Istrail, Sorin (2008). ''[https://www.brown.edu/Research/Istrail_Lab/media/conduit_v17n2.pdf Storytelling About Lighthouses: Criticizing Professor Dijkstra Considered Harmless]''. (''Conduit'', Brown University Department of Computer Science Alumni Magazine, Vol. 17, No. 2, 2008). As [[Brown University]]'s Sorin Istrail (2008) notes, "A prolific writer, he [Dijkstra] authored more than 1,300 papers, many written by hand in his precise and elegant script. They were essays and parables; fairy tales and warnings; comprehensive explanation and pedagogical pretext. Most were about mathematics and computer science; others were trip reports that are more revealing about their author than about the people and places visited. This “Dijkstranian style” of writing flourished on the frontier between technical computing science and the philosophy substantiating its distinguished development. It was his habit to copy each paper and circulate it to a small group of colleagues who would copy and forward the papers to another limited group of scientists. (...) I read them with joy and excitement and my love for mathematics and computer science has been influenced in no small measure by his works."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[List of pioneers in computer science|early pioneer in computing science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hoare, Tony|authorlink=Tony Hoare|date=March 2003|title=Obituary: Edsger Wybe Dijkstra|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/article/56/3/10.1063/1.1570789|journal=Physics Today|volume=56|issue=3|pages=96–98|doi=10.1063/1.1570789|bibcode=2003PhT....56c..96H}}&lt;/ref&gt; A theoretical physicist by training, he worked as a [[programmer]] at the [[Mathematisch Centrum]] (Amsterdam) from 1952 to 1962. A university professor for much of his life, Dijkstra held the Schlumberger Centennial Chair in Computer Sciences at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] from 1984 until his retirement in 1999. He was a professor of mathematics at the [[Eindhoven University of Technology]] (1962–1984) and a research fellow at the [[Burroughs Corporation]] (1973–1984).

One of the most influential figures of computing science's founding generation, Dijkstra helped shape the new discipline from both an engineering and a [[theoretical computer science|theoretical perspective]].&lt;ref name="Dijkstra_bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.utexas.edu/faculty/council/2002-2003/memorials/Dijkstra/dijkstra.html |author1=Faulkner, Larry R. |author2=Durbin, John R. |title=In Memoriam: Edsger Wybe Dijkstra |publisher=The University of Texas at Austin |date=19 August 2013 |accessdate=20 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gerard |last=O'Regan |title=Giants of Computing: A Compendium of Select, Pivotal Pioneers |publisher=Springer |location= |year=2013 |isbn= |pages=91–92 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His fundamental contributions cover diverse areas of computing science, including [[compiler construction]], operating systems, [[distributed system]]s, sequential and concurrent programming, programming paradigm and methodology, [[programming language research]], program design, program development, program verification, software engineering principles, graph algorithms, and philosophical foundations of computer programming and computer science. Many of his papers are the source of new research areas. Several concepts and problems that are now standard in computer science were first identified by Dijkstra or bear names coined by him.&lt;ref name="Apt, Krzysztof R. 2002"&gt;{{harvnb|Apt|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Gries |authorlink=David Gries |title=Programming Methodology: A Collection of Articles by Members of IFIP WG2.3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JdziBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7 |date=1978 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4612-6315-9 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a foremost opponent of the mechanizing view of computing science, he refuted the use of the concepts of 'computer science' and 'software engineering' as umbrella terms for [[academic disciplines]].

Until the mid-1960s [[computer programming]] was considered more an art (or a craft) than a scientific discipline. In [[Harlan Mills]]'s words (1986), "programming [before the 1970s] was regarded as a private, puzzle-solving activity of writing computer instructions to work as a program". In the late 1960s, computer programming was in a [[software crisis|state of crisis]]. Dijkstra was one of a small group of academics and industrial programmers who advocated a new programming style to improve the quality of [[computer program|programs]]. Dijkstra, who had a background in mathematics and physics, was one of the driving forces behind the acceptance of computer programming as a scientific discipline.&lt;ref name="DijkstraNYT"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/10/obituaries/10DIJK.html |last=Markoff |first=John |title=Edsger Dijkstra: Physicist Who Shaped Computer Era |newspaper=New York Times |date=10 August 2002 |accessdate=10 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/aug/19/guardianobituaries.obituaries1 |author=Schofield, Jack |title=Edsger Dijkstra: Pioneering computer programmer who made his subject intellectually respectable |publisher=The Guardian |date=19 August 2002 |accessdate=19 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He coined the phrase "[[structured programming]]" and during the 1970s this became the new programming orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Knuth | first1 = Donald | authorlink = Donald Knuth | year = 1974 | title = Structured Programming with Go To Statements | url = | journal = Computing Surveys | volume = 6 | issue = 4| pages = 261–301 | doi = 10.1145/356635.356640 |quote=As Donald Knuth remarked, "A revolution is taking place in the way we write programs and teach programming, because we are beginning to understand the associated mental processes more deeply.

The academic study of [[concurrent computing]] started in the 1960s, with Dijkstra (1965) credited with being the first paper in this field, identifying and solving the [[mutual exclusion]] problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.podc.org/influential/2002.html | title=PODC Influential Paper Award: 2002 | work=ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing | accessdate=2009-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/6/187316-turing-lecture-the-computer-science-of-concurrency/fulltext |author=[[Leslie Lamport|Lamport, Leslie]] |title=Turing Lecture: The Computer Science of Concurrency: The Early Years (Communications of the ACM, Vol. 58 No. 6, June 2015) |publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] |quote=As Leslie Lamport (2015) notes, "While [[concurrent program]] execution had been considered for years, the computer science of concurrency began with Edsger Dijkstra's seminal 1965 paper that introduced the mutual exclusion problem.

The ensuing decades have seen a huge growth of interest in concurrency—particularly in distributed systems.

His foundational work on [[concurrency (computer science)|concurrency]], [[Semaphore (programming)|semaphores]], mutual exclusion, [[deadlock]] (deadly embrace), finding [[Shortest path problem|shortest paths in graphs]], [[fault-tolerance]], [[self-stabilization]], among many other contributions comprises many of the pillars upon which the field of distributed computing is built. Shortly before his death in 2002, he received the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] [[PODC Influential-Paper Award]] in distributed computing for his work on self-stabilization of program computation. This annual award was renamed the [[Dijkstra Prize]] (Edsger W.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Edsger W. Dijkstra was born in [[Rotterdam]].  His father was a chemist who was president of the Dutch Chemical Society; he taught chemistry at a secondary school and was later its superintendent.  His mother was a mathematician, but never had a formal job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digidome.nl/edsger_wybe_dijkstra.htm |title=Edsger Wybe Dijkstra |website=Stichting Digidome|date=3 September 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041206193322/http://www.digidome.nl/edsger_wybe_dijkstra.htm |archivedate=6 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Dijkstra.html| title=Dijkstra biography | last1=O'Connor |first1=J J |last2=Robertson |first2=E F |website=The MacTutor History of Mathematics, School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St Andrews, Scotland |date=July 2008 |accessdate=18 January 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011055811/http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Dijkstra.html |archivedate=11 October 2013 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dijkstra had considered a career in law and had hoped to represent the Netherlands in the [[United Nations]]. However, after graduating from school in 1948, at his parents' suggestion he studied mathematics and physics and then [[theoretical physics]] at the [[University of Leiden]].&lt;ref name="Dijkstra_bio"/&gt;

In the early 1950s, [[electronic computers]] were a novelty. Dijkstra stumbled on his career quite by accident, and through his supervisor, Professor A. Haantjes, he met [[Adriaan van Wijngaarden]], the director of the Computation Department at the [[Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica|Mathematical Center in Amsterdam]], who offered Dijkstra a job; he officially became the Netherlands' first "programmer" in March 1952.&lt;ref name="Dijkstra_bio"/&gt;

For some time Dijkstra remained committed to physics, working on it in [[Leiden]] three days out of each week. With increasing exposure to computing, however, his focus began to shift. As he recalled:&lt;ref name="ewd340"&gt;[http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD340.html E. W. Dijkstra Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|After having programmed for some three years, I had a discussion with [[Adriaan van Wijngaarden|A. van Wijngaarden]], who was then my boss at the [[Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica|Mathematical Center in Amsterdam]], a discussion for which I shall remain grateful to him as long as I live. The point was that I was supposed to study theoretical physics at the University of Leiden simultaneously, and as I found the two activities harder and harder to combine, I had to make up my mind, either to stop programming and become a real, respectable [[theoretical physicist]], or to carry my study of physics to a formal completion only, with a minimum of effort, and to become....., yes what? A [[programmer]]? But was that a respectable profession? For after all, what was [[Computer programming|programming]]? Where was the sound body of knowledge that could support it as an intellectually respectable discipline? I remember quite vividly how I envied my hardware colleagues, who, when asked about their professional competence, could at least point out that they knew everything about vacuum tubes, amplifiers and the rest, whereas I felt that, when faced with that question, I would stand empty-handed. Full of misgivings I knocked on Van Wijngaarden's office door, asking him whether I could "speak to him for a moment"; when I left his office a number of hours later, I was another person. For after having listened to my problems patiently, he agreed that up till that moment there was not much of a programming discipline, but then he went on to explain quietly that automatic computers were here to stay, that we were just at the beginning and could not I be one of the persons called to make programming a respectable discipline in the years to come? This was a turning point in my life and I completed my study of physics formally as quickly as I could.|Edsger Dijkstra|The Humble Programmer (EWD340)|[[Communications of the ACM]]}}

When Dijkstra married Maria (Ria) C. Debets in 1957, he was required as a part of the marriage rites to state his profession. He stated that he was a programmer, which was unacceptable to the authorities, there being no such profession at that time in The Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD340.html E. W. Dijkstra Archive].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i-programmer.info/history/people/144-dijkstra.html |author=James, Mike |title=Edsger Dijkstra — The Poetry of Programming |publisher=i-programmer.info |date=1 May 2013 |accessdate=12 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1959 he received his PhD from the [[University of Amsterdam]] for a thesis entitled 'Communication with an Automatic Computer', devoted to a description of the assembly language designed for the first commercial computer developed in the Netherlands, the X1. His thesis supervisor was Van Wijngaarden.&lt;ref name="Apt, Krzysztof R. 2002"/&gt;

===Mathematisch Centrum, Amsterdam===

From 1952 until 1962 Dijkstra worked at the [[Mathematisch Centrum]] in Amsterdam,&lt;ref name="Apt, Krzysztof R. 2002"/&gt; where he worked closely with [[Bram Jan Loopstra]] and [[Carel S. Scholten]], who had been hired to build a computer. Their mode of interaction was disciplined: They would first decide upon the interface between the hardware and the software, by writing a programming manual. Then the hardware designers would have to be faithful to their part of the contract, while Dijkstra, the programmer, would write software for the nonexistent machine. Two of the lessons he learned from this experience were the importance of clear documentation, and that program debugging can be largely avoided through careful design.&lt;ref name="Dijkstra_bio"/&gt;
Dijkstra formulated and solved the [[shortest path problem]] for a demonstration at the official inauguration of the ARMAC computer in 1956, but—because of the absence of journals dedicated to automatic computing—did not publish the result until 1959.

At the Mathematical Center, Dijkstra and his colleague {{Interlanguage link multi|Jaap Zonneveld|nl}} developed a [[compiler]] for the programming language [[ALGOL 60]]; it had a profound influence on his later thinking on programming as a scientific activity. He and Zonneveld had completed the implementation of the first [[ALGOL 60]] [[compiler]] by August 1960, more than a year before a compiler was produced by another group.&lt;ref name="Dijkstra_bio"/&gt;

===Eindhoven University of Technology===
[[File:TU Eindhoven.jpg|thumb|180px|The [[Eindhoven University of Technology]], located in [[Eindhoven]] in the south of the Netherlands, where Dijkstra was a professor of mathematics from 1962 to 1984.]]
In 1962 Dijkstra moved to [[Eindhoven]], and later to [[Nuenen]], in the south of the Netherlands, where he became a professor in the Mathematics Department at the [[Eindhoven University of Technology]].&lt;ref name="Apt, Krzysztof R. 2002"/&gt; The university did not have a separate computer science department and the culture of the mathematics department did not particularly suit him. Dijkstra tried to build a group of computer scientists who could collaborate on solving problems. This was an unusual model of research for the Mathematics Department.&lt;ref name="Dijkstra_bio"/&gt; In the late 1960s he built the [[THE multiprogramming system|THE operating system]] (named for the university, then known as [[Technische Hogeschool Eindhoven]]), which has influenced the designs of subsequent [[operating systems]] through its use of software based paged virtual memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Operating System Concepts|last=Silberschatz, Abraham; Peterson, James L.|first=|publisher=|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burroughs Corporation===
Dijkstra joined [[Burroughs Corporation]], a company known at that time for the production of computers based on an innovative hardware architecture, as its Research Fellow in August 1973. His duties consisted of visiting some of the company's research centers a few times a year and carrying on his own research, which he did in the smallest Burroughs research facility, namely, his study on the second floor of his house in Nuenen. In fact, Dijkstra was the only research fellow of Burroughs Corporation and worked for it from home, occasionally travelling to its branches in the United States. As a result, he reduced his appointment at the university to one day a week. That day, Tuesday, soon became known as the day of the famous 'Tuesday Afternoon Club', a seminar during which he discussed with his colleagues scientific articles, looking at all aspects – notation, organisation, presentation, language, content, etc. Shortly after he moved in 1984 to the [[University of Texas at Austin]] (USA), a new 'branch' of the Tuesday Afternoon Club emerged in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].&lt;ref name="Apt, Krzysztof R. 2002"/&gt;

The Burroughs years saw him at his most prolific in output of research articles. He wrote nearly 500 documents in the EWD series (described below), most of them technical reports, for private circulation within a select group.&lt;ref name="Dijkstra_bio"/&gt;

===The University of Texas at Austin===
[[File:Main Building at The University of Texas at Austin.jpg|thumb|180px|The [[University of Texas at Austin]], where Dijkstra held the Schlumberger Centennial Chair in Computer Sciences from 1984 until 1999.]]
Dijkstra accepted the Schlumberger Centennial Chair in the Computer Science Department at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in 1984.

===Last years===
Dijkstra worked in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] until his retirement  in November 1999. To mark the occasion and to celebrate his forty-plus years of seminal contributions to [[computing science]], the Department of Computer Sciences organized a symposium, which took place on his 70th birthday in May 2000.&lt;ref name="Dijkstra_bio"/&gt;

Dijkstra and his wife returned from Austin to his original house in [[Nuenen]] (Netherlands) where he found that he had only months to live. He said that he wanted to retire in Austin, [[Texas]], but to die in the Netherlands. Dijkstra died on 6 August 2002 after a long struggle with cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1001-949023.html | title=Computer science pioneer Dijkstra dies | accessdate=22 December 2010 | author=Goodwins, Rupert | date=8 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his wife Maria (Ria) Debets were survived by their three children: Marcus, Femke and the computer scientist Rutger M. Dijkstra.

== Scientific contributions and impacts ==
{{Programming paradigms}}
As an early theoretical [[List of pioneers in computer science|pioneer]] in many research areas of computing science, Dijkstra helped shape the [[List of pioneers in computer science|new discipline]] from both an engineering and an [[theoretical computer science|academic perspective]]. Many of his papers are the source of new research areas. Many concepts that are now standard in computer science were first identified by Dijkstra and/or bear names coined by him. Several important problems were also first formulated and solved by him. A 1994 survey of over a thousand professors of computer science was conducted to obtain a list of 38 most influential scholarly papers in the field, and Dijkstra is the author of five papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laplante|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Peter Chen |first=Peter P. |last=Chen |title=From Goto-less to Structured Programming: The Legacy of Edsger W. Dijkstra |journal=IEEE Software |volume=19 |issue=5 |pages=21 |year=2002 |doi=10.1109/MS.2002.1032847 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1032847/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Phillip A. |last=Laplante |title=Great Papers in Computer Science: A Retrospective |journal=Journal of Scientific and Practical Computing |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=31–35 |date=December 2008 |format=PDF |url=http://www.spclab.com/publisher/journals/Vol2No1/NR1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his forty-plus years as a computing scientist, which included positions in both academia and industry, Dijkstra made numerous seminal contributions to many areas of computing science, including compiler construction, operating systems, concurrent programming (concurrent computing), distributed programming (distributed computing), programming paradigm and methodology, programming language research, program design, program development, program verification, software engineering principles, algorithm design, and philosophical foundations of computer programming and computer science. In addition, Dijkstra was intensely interested in teaching computer science, and in the relationships between academic computing science and the software industry.

===Algorithmic work===
[[File:Dijkstra Animation.gif|Dijkstra's algorithm runtime|thumb |Dijkstra's algorithm. It picks the unvisited vertex with the lowest-distance, calculates the distance through it to each unvisited neighbor, and updates the neighbor's distance if smaller. Mark visited (set to red) when done with neighbors.]]

Dijkstra's algorithmic work (especially [[graph algorithms]], [[concurrent algorithm]]s, and [[distributed algorithms]]) plays an important role in many areas of computing science. According to [[Leslie Lamport]] (2002), Dijkstra "started the field of concurrent and [[distributed algorithms]] with his 1965 CACM paper "Solution of a Problem in Concurrent Programming Control", in which he first stated and solved the mutual exclusion problem." As Lamport explains, "that paper is probably why [[PODC]] exists (...). It remains to this day the most influential paper in the field. That it did not win a [[PODC Influential-Paper Award|PODC Influential Paper Award]] reflects an artificial separation between concurrent and distributed algorithms–a separation that has never existed in Dijkstra's work."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.podc.org/influential/2002-influential-paper/ 2002 PODC Influential Paper Award (ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing)].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959 Dijkstra published in a 3-page article 'A note on two problems in connexion with graphs' the [[algorithm]] to find the shortest path in a graph between any two given nodes, now called [[Dijkstra's algorithm]]. Its impact over the next 40 years is summarised from the article of [[Mikkel Thorup]], 'Undirected Single Source Shortest Paths with Positive Integer Weights in Linear Time' (1999): "Since 1959, all theoretical developments in SSSP [Single-Source Shortest Paths] for general directed and undirected graphs have been based on Dijkstra's algorithm." Dijkstra's algorithm is used in SPF, [[Shortest Path First]], which is used in the routing protocols [[Open Shortest Path First|OSPF]] and [[IS-IS]]. Various modifications to Dijkstra's algorithm have been proposed by many authors using [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristics]] to reduce the run time of [[shortest path search]]. One of the most used heuristic algorithms is the [[A* search algorithm]] (first described by [[Peter E. Hart|Peter Hart]], [[Nils John Nilsson|Nils Nilsson]] and [[Bertram Raphael]] of [[SRI International|Stanford Research Institute]] in 1968),&lt;ref name="nilsson"&gt;{{cite journal

 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; the main goal is to reduce the run time by reducing the search space. Dijkstra thought about the [[shortest path problem]] when working at the [[Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica|Mathematical Center in Amsterdam]] in 1956 as a [[computer programmer|programmer]] to demonstrate capabilities of a new [[computer]] called [[ARMAC]]. His objective was to choose both a problem as well as an answer (that would be produced by computer) that non-computing people could understand. He designed the [[Dijkstra's algorithm|shortest path algorithm]] in about 20 minutes without aid of paper and pen and later implemented it for ARMAC for a slightly simplified transportation map of 64 cities in the Netherlands (so that 6 bits would suffice to represent the city in the algorithm).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Dijkstra.html Dijkstra biography]&lt;/ref&gt; As he recalled, in an interview published in 2001:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frana | first1 = Philip L | year = 2001 | title = An Interview with Edsger W.

{{quote|What is the shortest way to travel from Rotterdam to [[Groningen]], in general: from given city to given city. [[Shortest path problem|It is the algorithm for the shortest path]], which I designed in about twenty minutes. One morning I was shopping in Amsterdam with my young fiancée, and tired, we sat down on the café terrace to drink a cup of coffee and I was just thinking about whether I could do this, and I then designed the algorithm for the shortest path. As I said, it was a twenty-minute invention. In fact, it was published in ’59, three years late. The publication is still readable, it is, in fact, quite nice. One of the reasons that it is so nice was that I designed it without pencil and paper. I learned later that one of the advantages of designing without pencil and paper is that you are almost forced to avoid all avoidable complexities. Eventually that algorithm became, to my great amazement, one of the cornerstones of my fame.|Edsger Dijkstra, in an interview with Philip L. Frana, Communications of the ACM 53 (8), 2001.}}

A year later, he came across another problem from hardware engineers working on the institute's next computer: minimize the amount of wire needed to connect the pins on the back panel of the machine. As a solution, he re-discovered the algorithm known as [[Prim's algorithm|Prim's]] [[Minimum spanning tree|minimal spanning tree algorithm]]. The [[Prim's algorithm]] was originally developed in 1930 by [[Czech people|Czech]] mathematician [[Vojtěch Jarník]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961 Dijkstra first described the [[shunting-yard algorithm]], a method for parsing mathematical expressions specified in [[infix notation]], in the [[Mathematisch Centrum]] report.&lt;ref&gt;[https://repository.cwi.nl/noauth/search/fullrecord.php?publnr=9251 MR 34/61]&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used to produce output in [[Reverse Polish notation]] (RPN) or as an [[abstract syntax tree]] (AST). The [[algorithm]] was named the "shunting yard" algorithm because its operation resembles that of a [[classification yard|railroad shunting yard]]. The shunting-yard algorithm is commonly used to implement [[operator-precedence parser]]s.

In 1962 or 1963 Dijkstra proposed the [[semaphore (programming)|semaphore]] mechanism for [[mutual exclusion]] algorithm for n processes (a generalization of [[Dekker's algorithm]]), which was probably the first published [[concurrent algorithm]] and which introduced a new area of algorithmic research. He also identified the [[deadlock]] problem and proposed the [[banker's algorithm]] that [[Deadlock prevention algorithms|prevents deadlock]].

In 1974 Dijkstra presented three [[self-stabilization|self-stabilizing]] algorithms for [[mutual exclusion]] on a ring. Dijkstra's work is considered to be the first to introduce and demonstrate the [[self-stabilization]] concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dolev|2000|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1970s Dijkstra (together with other authors) introduced two useful abstractions (mutator and collector) to the study of [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]]. The mutator abstracts the process that performs the computation, including allocation of a new storage cell. The collector is the process that automatically reclaims garbage. Furthermore, this paper gives a formalization of "[[Tracing garbage collection#Tri-color marking|tri-color marking]]" that is basic to incremental garbage collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cs-exhibitions.uni-klu.ac.at/index.php?id=4&amp;uid=15 |title=People Behind Informatics: Dijkstra-Breakthroughs, Glossary (Garbage Collection) |publisher=[[University of Klagenfurt]] |accessdate=12 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://blog.golang.org/go15gc |author=Hudson, Richard |title=Go GC: Prioritizing low latency and simplicity |publisher= The Go Programming Language Blog|date=31 August 2015 |accessdate=21 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s Dijkstra and [[Carel S. Scholten]] proposed the [[Dijkstra–Scholten algorithm]] for detecting termination in [[distributed systems]].

In 1981 Dijkstra developed [[smoothsort]], a [[comparison sort|comparison-based]] [[sorting algorithm]] and a variation of [[heapsort]].

===Compiler construction and programming language research===
[[File:Detail of a 1Kb ferrite core RAM-module of an 1960s Electrologica X1 computer.jpg|thumb|180px|By August 1960, Dijkstra and his colleague Zonneveld had completed the [[ALGOL 60#ALGOL 60 implementations timeline|implementation of the first ALGOL 60 compiler]] for the [[Electrologica X1]] computer.]]
Dijkstra was known to be a fan of [[ALGOL|ALGOL 60]], and worked on the team that implemented the first [[compiler]] for that language. He was closely involved in the ALGOL 60 development, realisation and popularisation. As discussed by [[Peter Naur]] in the article 'The European side of the last phase of the development of ALGOL 60', in the ''Proceedings of the First ACM SIGPLAN Conference on History of Programming Languages'', January 1978, Dijkstra took part in the period 1958–1959 in a number of meetings that culminated in the publication of the report defining the ALGOL 60 language. Dijkstra's name does not appear in the list of 13 authors of the final report. Apparently, he eventually left the committee because he could not agree with the majority opinions. Still, while at the Mathematisch Centrum (Amsterdam), he wrote jointly with [[Jaap Zonneveld]] the [[ALGOL 60#ALGOL 60 implementations timeline|first ALGOL 60 compiler]]. Dijkstra and Zonneveld, who collaborated on the compiler, agreed not to shave until the project was completed; while Zonneveld shaved shortly thereafter, Dijkstra kept his beard for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://vanemden.wordpress.com/2008/05/06/i-remember-edsger-dijkstra-1930-2002/ | title=I remember Edsger Dijkstra (1930–2002) | accessdate=22 December 2010 | author=van Emden, Maarten | date=6 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ALGOL]] was the result of a collaboration of American and European committees. [[ALGOL 60]] (short for ALGOrithmic Language 1960) is a member of the ALGOL family of computer programming languages. It followed on from [[ALGOL 58]] and inspired many languages that followed it. It gave rise to many other programming languages, including [[BCPL]], [[B (programming language)|B]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], [[Simula]] and [[C (programming language)|C]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=C.A.R. |last=Hoare |title=Hints on Programming Language Design |date=December 1973 |url=http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~bchandra/courses/papers/Hoare_Hints.pdf |format=PDF |page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algol 60 was a sophisticatedly designed [[computer language]] and it provided a large number of hitherto unknown [[Programming language implementation|implementation]] challenges. As [[Bjarne Stroustrup]] notes, "one problem with Algol60 was that no one knew how to implement it."&lt;ref&gt;[[Bjarne Stroustrup|Stroustrup, Bjarne]] (2014). ''Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++'', 2nd Edition. (Addison-Wesley Professional), p. 827&lt;/ref&gt; A major new challenge in [[ALGOL 60#ALGOL 60 implementations timeline|Algol 60 implementation]] was the run-time allocation and management of data. In 1960 Dijkstra and Zonneveld showed how recursive procedures could be executed using a run-time stack of activation records, and how to efficiently access identifiers from statically enclosing scopes using the so-called 'display'.&lt;ref&gt;Gram, Christian; Rasmussen, Per; Østergaard, Søren Duus (eds.)

}}&lt;/ref&gt; employing a novel method to do so. Dijkstra's short book ''Primer of Algol 60 Programming'', originally published in 1962, was the standard reference for the language for several years.

===Programming paradigm and methodology===
[[Computer programming]] in the 1950s to 1960s was not recognized as an [[Discipline (academia)|academic discipline]] and unlike mature sciences there were no theoretical concepts or coding systems. Programming as a professional activity was poorly understood in those years.

In the late 1960s computer programming was in state of crisis. [[Software crisis]] is a term used in the early days of [[computing science]] for the difficulty of writing useful and efficient [[computer programs]] in the required time. The software crisis was due to the rapid increases in computer power and the complexity of the problems that could be tackled. With the increase in the complexity of the [[software]], many software problems arose because existing methods were neither sufficient nor up to the mark. The term "software crisis" was coined by some attendees at the first [[NATO Software Engineering Conferences|NATO Software Engineering Conference]] in 1968 at [[Garmisch]], Germany.&lt;ref name="Haigh, Thomas 2010"&gt;Haigh, Thomas (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nato"&gt;[http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/brian.randell/NATO/NATOReports/index.html Report about the NATO Software Engineering Conference dealing with the software crisis]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nato2"&gt;[http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/brian.randell/NATO/nato1968.PDF "Report on a conference sponsored by the NATO SCIENCE COMMITTEE Garmisch, Germany, 7th to 11th October 1968"]&lt;/ref&gt; His 1972 ACM Turing Award Lecture makes reference to this same problem: "The major cause of the software crisis is that the machines have become several orders of magnitude more powerful! To put it quite bluntly: as long as there were no machines, programming was no problem at all; when we had a few weak computers, programming became a mild problem, and now we have gigantic computers, programming has become an equally gigantic problem."&lt;ref name="ewd340"/&gt;

While Dijkstra had programmed extensively in machine code in the 1950s, he came to the conclusion that in high-level languages frequent use of the [[GOTO]] statement was usually symptomatic of poor structure. In 1968 he wrote a private paper "A Case against the GO TO Statement",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EWD|215|A Case against the GO TO Statement}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was then published as a letter in CACM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dijkstra |first=E. W. |title=Letters to the editor: go to statement considered harmful |journal=Comm. ACM |volume=11 |issue=3 |date=March 1968 |pages=147–8 |doi=10.1145/362929.362947 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Editor [[Niklaus Wirth]] gave this letter the heading "[[Go To Statement Considered Harmful]]", which introduced the phrase "[[considered harmful]]" into computing.

Dijkstra argued that the programming statement GOTO, found in many high-level programming languages, is a major source of errors, and should therefore be eliminated. This letter caused a huge debate in the programming community. Some went to the length of equating good programming with the elimination of [[GO TO]]. Dijkstra refused to mention the debate, or even the GO TO statement, in his article "Notes on Structured Programming". The debate has long since died down; programming languages provide alternatives to the GO TO, few programmers today use it liberally, and most never use it at all.&lt;ref name="Dijkstra_bio"/&gt;

Dijkstra's thesis was that departures from linear control flow were clearer if allowed only in disciplined higher-level structures such as the [[Conditional (computer programming)|if-then-else]] statement and the [[while loop]]. This methodology was developed into [[structured programming|structured programming movement]], the title of his 1972 book, coauthored with [[C.A.R. Hoare]] and [[Ole-Johan Dahl]]. Considered by many as the first significant movement in history of computer programming, structured programming became the new programming orthodoxy during the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Knuth|Knuth, Donald]] (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Harlan Mills|Mills, Harlan D.]] (1986). ''Structured Programming: Retrospect and Prospect''. (IEEE Software 3(6): 58-66, November 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, Edwin D. (2004). ''Concise Encyclopedia of Computer Science''. (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.), p. 734.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bertrand Meyer]] remarked that, "The revolution in views of programming started by Dijkstra's iconoclasm led to a movement known as structured programming, which advocated a systematic, rational approach to program construction. Structured programming is the basis for all that has been done since in [[programming methodology]], including [[object-oriented programming]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Meyer|Meyer, Bertrand]] (2009). ''Touch of Class: Learning to Program Well with Objects and Contracts''. (Springer), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Structured programming]] is often regarded as "goto-less programming". But as Bertrand Meyer notes, "As the first book on the topic [''Structured Programming'' by Dijkstra, Dahl, and Hoare] shows, structured programming is about much more than control structures and the [[goto]]. Its principal message is that programming should be considered a scientific discipline based on mathematical rigor."&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Meyer|Meyer, Bertrand]] (2009), p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; [[:Category:Structured programming languages|As a programming paradigm]], structured programming – especially in the 1970s and 1980s – significantly influenced the birth of many modern [[programming languages]] such as [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]],&lt;ref&gt;Ryder, Barbara G.; Soffa, Mary Lou; Burnett, Margaret (2005). ''Impact of Software Engineering Research on Modern Programming Languages''. ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology, Vol. 14, No. 4, October 2005, p. 431-477. [[Niklaus Wirth]] notes: "Of great influence to [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] was [[Structured Programming]], put forth by E. W. Dijkstra. This method of proceeding in a design would obliviously be greatly encouraged by the use of a [[:Category:Structured programming languages|Structured Language]], a language with a set of constructs that could freely be combined and nested. The textual structure of a program should directly reflect its flow of control."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Niklaus Wirth|Wirth, Niklaus]] (2008). ''A Brief History of Software Engineering''. IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, vol.30, no. 3, July–September 2008, p. 32-39. Niklaus Wirth notes: "In 1965 Dijkstra wrote his famous ''Notes on Structured Programming'' and declared programming as a discipline in contrast to a craft. Also in 1965 [[Tony Hoare|Hoare]] published an important paper about data structuring. These ideas had a profound influence on new programming language, in particular [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]. Languages are the vehicles in which these ideas were to be expressed. [[Structured programming]] became supported by a [[:Category:Structured programming languages|structured programming language]]."&lt;/ref&gt; [[C (programming language)|C]], [[Modula-2]], and [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]].&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, Edwin D. (2004). ''Concise Encyclopedia of Computer Science''. (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.), p. 734. "The first significant SP [Structured Programming] language was [[Algol 60]] (q.v.). Subsequently developed SP languages in current use are [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[C (programming language)|C]] (q.v.), [[C++]] (q.v.), [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] (q.v.)."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fortran 77]] version which incorporates the concepts of structured programming, was released in 1978. The [[C++]] language was a considerably extended and enhanced version of the popular [[:Category:Structured programming languages|structured programming language]] [[C (programming language)|C]] (see also: [[list of C-based programming languages]]). Since C++ was developed from a more traditional [[:Category:Structured programming languages|structured language]], it is a '[[Multi-paradigm programming language|hybrid language]]', rather than a pure [[object-oriented programming]] language.&lt;ref&gt;Graba, Jan (1998). ''Up and Running with C++''. (Springer), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In his article ''Structured Programming: Retrospect and Prospect'' (1986), [[Harlan Mills]] writes, "Edsger W. Dijkstra's 1969 ''Structured Programming'' article precipitated a decade of intense focus on programming techniques that has fundamentally altered human expectations and achievements in [[software development]]. Before this decade of intense focus, programming was regarded as a private, puzzle-solving activity of writing computer instructions to work as a program. After this decade, programming could be regarded as a public, mathematics-based activity of restructuring specifications into programs. Before, the challenge was in getting programs to run at all, and then in getting them further debugged to do the right things. After, programs could be expected to both run and do the right things with little or no debugging. Before, it was common wisdom that no sizable program could be error-free. After, many sizable programs have run a year or more with no errors detected. These expectations and achievements are not universal because of the inertia of industrial practices. But they are well-enough established to herald fundamental change in software development."

The book ''Concise Encyclopedia of Computer Science'' (2004), edited by Edwin D. Reilly, notes that "the major contributions of structured programming have been twofold—the elevation of programming technique to something less of an art and more of a science, and the demonstration that carefully structured programs can be creative works of sufficient literary merit to deserve being read by humans and not just by computer."&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, Edwin D. (2004), John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd., p. 734&lt;/ref&gt;

===Program design and development (software engineering research)===
Dijkstra's ideas about [[programming methodology]] (especially the structured programming movement) helped lay the foundations for the birth and development of the professional discipline of [[software engineering]] (in particular the software design and development), enabling programmers to organize and manage increasingly complex software projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Broy|Denert|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, Harry (Facts on File, Inc., 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s Dijkstra discussed the concept of program families. And in the mid 1970s [[David Parnas]] and others clarified the idea and showed how to apply it in software engineering principles.

The rise of the [[structured programming|structured programming movement]] led to many other [[structured analysis|''structured'' approaches]] applied to [[software design]]. The techniques of [[structured analysis]] and [[structured design]] are outgrowths of [[structured programming]] concepts and techniques, and of the early ideas about modular design. Principles of modularity were strengthened by [[Larry Constantine]]'s concepts of [[Coupling (computer programming)|coupling]] (to be minimized between modules) and [[Cohesion (computer science)|cohesion]] (to be maximized within modules), by [[David Parnas]]'s techniques of [[information hiding]], and by [[abstract data types]].&lt;ref&gt;Selby, Richard W. (2007). ''Software Engineering: Barry W. Boehm's Lifetime Contributions to Software Development, Management, and Research''. (IEEE Computer Society), pp. 701–702&lt;/ref&gt; A number of tools and methods employing [[structured analysis|structured concepts]] were developed, such as [[Structured Design]], [[Jackson Structured Programming|Jackson's Structured Programming]], [[Douglas T. Ross|Ross]]' [[Structured Analysis and Design Technique]] (SADT), [[Edward Yourdon#Yourdon Structured Method|Yourdon's Structured Method]], [[Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method]] (SSADM), and James Martin's [[information technology engineering]]. The field of [[software metrics]] is often considered as a direct influence of the structured programming movement on [[software engineering]] in the 1970s.

[[Separation of concerns]] (SoC), one of the basic principles in [[software engineering]], is a design principle for separating a [[computer program]] into distinct sections, such that each section addresses a separate [[concern (computer science)|concern]]. The term ''[[separation of concerns]]'' was coined by Dijkstra in his 1974 paper "On the role of scientific thought".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

===Operating system research===
In the 1960s Dijkstra and his colleagues in [[Eindhoven]] designed and implemented [[THE multiprogramming system|THE]] (standing for '[[Technische Hogeschool Eindhoven]]') [[operating system]], which was organised into clearly identified [[Abstraction layer|layers]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Kyle; Craig, Gary; Hester, Greg (2003). ''Enterprise Java Programming with IBM WebSphere'', 2nd Edition (IBM Press), p. 5. As Kyle Brown, Greg Hester, et al. (2003) notes, "Most experienced IT professionals will agree that developing and adhering to a standard architecture is key to the success of large-scale software development. Computer pioneer Edsger Dijkstra validated this notion when he developed THE operating system in 1968. Since then, layered architectures have proved their viability in technological domains, such as hardware and networking. Layering has proved itself in the operating system domain; however, the same benefits are available when applied to e-commerce or to thin client–oriented applications. Layered architectures have become essential in supporting the iterative development process by promoting reusability, scalability, and maintainability."&lt;/ref&gt; His 1968 article on this subject provided the foundation for subsequent designs of the operating systems. The IEEE Computer Society's [[David Alan Grier (writer)|David Alan Grier]] writes, "We generally trace the idea of building computer systems in layers back to a 1967 paper that the Dutch computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra gave to a joint IEEE Computer Society/ACM conference. Prior to this paper, engineers had struggled with the problem of how to organize software. If you look at early examples of programs, and you can find many in the electronic library of the Computer Society, you will find that most code of that era is complicated, difficult to read, hard to modify, and challenging to reuse. In his 1967 paper, Dijkstra described how software could be constructed in layers and gave an example of a simple operating system that used five layers. He admitted that this system might not be a realistic test of his ideas but he argued that the "larger the project, the more essential the structuring!" The idea of using layers to control complexity has become a mainstay of software architecture. We see it in many forms and apply it to many problems. We see it in the hierarchy of classes in object-oriented programming and in the structure of [[Service-Oriented Architecture]] (SOA). SOA is a relatively recent application of layering in computer science. It was articulated in 2007 as a means of controlling complexity in business systems, especially distributed systems that make substantial use of the Internet. Like Dijkstra's plan for system development, its layering system is called the SOA Solution Stack or S3. The S3's nine layers are: 1) operational systems, 2) service components, 3) services, 4) business processes, 5) consumer actions, 6) system integration, 7) quality control and assurance, 8) information architecture, and 9) system governance and policies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.computer.org/web/closer-than-you-might-think/layers-upon-layers |author=Grier, David Alan |title=Closer Than You Might Think: Layers upon Layers |publisher=IEEE Computer Society |accessdate=12 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dijkstra organized the design of the system in layers in order to reduce the overall complexity of the software. Though the term 'architecture' had not yet been used to describe [[software design]], this was certainly considered the first glimpse of [[software architecture]].&lt;ref name=Albin03/&gt; It introduced a number of design principles which have become part of the working vocabulary of every professional programmer: levels of abstraction, programming in layers, the semaphore, and [[cooperating sequential processes]]. His original paper on the THE operating system was reprinted in the 25th Anniversary issue of Communications of the ACM, in January 1983. By way of introduction, the Editor-in-Chief says, "This project initiated a long line of research in multilevel systems architecture — a line that continues to the present day because hierarchical modularity is a powerful approach to organizing large systems."&lt;ref name="Dijkstra_bio"/&gt;

===Concurrent computing and programming===
[[File:Rail-semaphore-signal-Dave-F.jpg|thumb|180px|A [[Semaphore (programming)|semaphore]] ({{lang-nl|seinpaal}}, the term used in Dijkstra's original description&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EWD|74|Over seinpalen}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In the early 1960s Dijkstra proposed the first synchronisation mechanism for concurrent processes, the [[Semaphore (programming)|semaphore]] with its two operations, P and V.]]
In a one-page paper from 1965 Dijkstra introduced the '[[mutual exclusion]] problem' for n processes and discussed a solution to it. It was probably the first published [[concurrent algorithm]].&lt;ref name="Lamport (2015)"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/6/187316-turing-lecture-the-computer-science-of-concurrency/fulltext |authorlink=Leslie Lamport |last=Lamport |first=Leslie |title=Turing Lecture: The Computer Science of Concurrency: The Early Years |journal=Comm. ACM |volume=58 |issue=6 |date=June 2015 |doi=10.1145/2771951 |pages=71–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Apt, Krzysztof R. 2002"/&gt; The notion, standard by now, of a '[[critical section]]' was also introduced in this paper. [[Per Brinch Hansen]], a pioneer in the field of [[concurrent computing]], considers Dijkstra's ''Cooperating Sequential Processes'' (1965) to be the [[List of important publications in concurrent, parallel, and distributed computing|first classic paper]] in concurrent programming. As Brinch Hansen notes, 'Dijkstra lays the conceptual foundation for abstract concurrent programming' with that paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brinch Hansen|2002|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mutual exclusion example with linked list.png|thumb|180px|A simple example of two processes modifying a linked list at the same time causing a conflict. The requirement of [[mutual exclusion]] was first identified and solved by Dijkstra in his seminal 1965 paper titled ''Solution of a problem in concurrent programming control'', and is credited as the first topic in the study of [[concurrent algorithm]]s.]]
In 1968 Dijkstra published his seminal paper '[[Cooperating sequential processes]]', a 70-page essay that originated the field of [[concurrent programming]]. He discussed in it the notion of [[mutual exclusion]] ([[mutex]]) and the criteria a satisfactory solution should satisfy. He also redressed the historical perspective left out of his 1965 paper by including the [[Dekker's algorithm|first known correct solution to the mutual exclusion problem]], for two processes, due to [[Theodorus Dekker]]. Dijkstra subsequently generalized [[Dekker's algorithm|Dekker's solution]] to n processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Anderson |first=J.H. |last2=Kim, |first2=Y.-J.; |last3=Herman |first3=T. |title=Shared-Memory Mutual Exclusion: Major Research Trends Since 1986 |journal=Distributed Computing |volume=16 |issue=2-3 |pages=75–110 |year=2003 |doi= 10.1007/s00446-003-0088-6|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=K. |last=Alagarsamy |title=Some Myths About Famous Mutual Exclusion Algorithms |journal=ACM SIGACT News |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=94–103 |year=2003 |doi=10.1145/945526.945527 |url=http://cs2.unomaha.edu/~stanw/papers/p94-alagarsamy.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, he proposed the first [[Synchronization (computer science)|synchronisation mechanism]] for concurrent processes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michel |last=Raynal |title=Concurrent Programming: Algorithms, Principles, and Foundations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0a1AAAAAQBAJ  |date=2012 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-642-32027-9 |pages=vi}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Semaphore (programming)|semaphore]] with its two operations, P and V. He also identified the '[[deadlock]] problem' (called there 'the problem of the [[deadly embrace]]')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i-programmer.info/history/people/144-dijkstra.html?start=1 |author=James, Mike |title=Edsger Dijkstra - The Poetry of Programming |publisher=i-programmer.info |date=1 May 2013 |accessdate=12 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and proposed an elegant '[[Banker's algorithm]]' that [[Deadlock prevention algorithms|prevents deadlock]]. The deadlock detection and prevention became perennial research problems in the field of concurrent programming.

[[File:An illustration of the dining philosophers problem.png|thumb|180px|Illustration of the dining philosophers problem]]
The [[dining philosophers problem]] is an example problem often used in [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrent]] algorithm design to illustrate [[Synchronization (computer science)|synchronization]] issues and techniques for resolving them. It was originally formulated in 1965 by Dijkstra as a student exam exercise, presented in terms of computers [[resource contention|competing for access]] to [[tape drive]] peripherals. Soon after, [[Tony Hoare]] gave the problem its present formulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usingcsp.com/cspbook.pdf|title=Communicating Sequential Processes|last=Hoare|first=C. A. R.|publisher=Prentice Hall International|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sleeping barber problem]] is also attributed to Dijkstra.

In his book ''Concurrent Programming: Algorithms, Principles, and Foundations''&lt;ref&gt;Raynal, Michel. (Springer), {{ISBN|978-3-642-32027-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michel Raynal writes, "Since the early work of E.W. Dijkstra (1965), who introduced the mutual exclusion problem, the concept of a process, the semaphore object, the notion of a [[weakest precondition]], and [[guarded commands]] (among many other contributions), [[Synchronization (computer science)|synchronization]] is no longer a catalog of tricks but a domain of computing science with its own concepts, mechanisms, and techniques whose results can be applied in many domains. This means that process synchronization has to be a major topic of any computer science curriculum."

John W. McCormick et al. (2011) notes, "The notion of the [[concurrent program]] as a means for writing [[parallel program]]s without regard for the underlying hardware was first introduced by Edsger Dijkstra (1968). [[Moti Ben-Ari]] (1982) elegantly summed up Dijkstra's idea in three sentences: ‘Concurrent programming is the name given to programming notation and techniques for expressing potential parallelism and solving the resulting synchronization and communication problems. Implementation of parallelism is a topic in computer systems (hardware and software) that is essentially independent of concurrent programming. Concurrent programming is important because it provides an abstract setting in which to study parallelism without getting bogged down in the implementation details.’"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McCormick |first=John W. |last2=Singhoff |first2=Frank |last3=Hugues |first3=Jérôme |title=Building Parallel, Embedded, and Real-Time Applications with Ada |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |year=2011 |isbn= |pages=5 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distributed computing===
Dijkstra was one of the very early pioneers of the research on principles of [[distributed computing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.podc.org/dijkstra Edsger W. Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing (ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing)]. The citation for the prize reads: "The [[Edsger W. Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing]] is named for Edsger Wybe Dijkstra (1930–2002), a pioneer in the area of distributed computing. His foundational work on concurrency primitives (such as the semaphore), concurrency problems (such as mutual exclusion and deadlock), reasoning about concurrent systems, and self-stabilization comprises one of the most important supports upon which the field of distributed computing is built. No other individual has had a larger influence on research in principles of distributed computing."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eatcs.org/index.php/dijkstra-prize Edsger W. Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing (EATCS International Symposium on Distributed Computing)]&lt;/ref&gt; As the citation for the [[Dijkstra Prize]] recognizes, "no other individual has had a larger influence on research in principles of distributed computing." Some of his papers are even considered to be those that established the field. Dijkstra's 1965 paper, ''Solution of a Problem in Concurrent Programming Control'' was the first to present the correct solution to the [[mutual exclusion]] problem. [[Leslie Lamport]] writes that this work "is probably why [[PODC]] exists" and it "started the field of concurrent and [[distributed algorithms]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.podc.org/influential/2002-influential-paper/ 2002 PODC Influential Paper Award (ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, his paper "Self-stabilizing Systems in Spite of Distributed Control" (1974) started the sub-field of [[self-stabilization]]. It is also considered as the first scientific examination of [[fault-tolerant systems]].&lt;ref name="Lamport (2015)"/&gt; Dijkstra's paper was not widely noticed until Leslie Lamport's invited talk at the ACM [[Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing]] ([[PODC]]) in 1983. In his report on Dijkstra's work on [[self-stabilization|self-stabilizing]] [[distributed systems]], Lamport regard it to be 'a milestone in work on [[fault tolerance]]' and 'a very fertile field for research'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dolev|2000|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formal specification and verification===

From the 1970s, Dijkstra's chief interest was [[formal verification]]. In 1976 Dijkstra published a seminal book, ''A Discipline of Programming'', which put forward his method of systematic development of programs together with their correctness proofs. In his exposition he used his '[[Guarded Command Language]]'. The language, with its reliance on non-determinism, the adopted [[weakest precondition]] [[Predicate transformer semantics|semantics]] and the proposed development method has had a considerable impact on the field to this day. The [[refinement calculus]], originally proposed by [[Ralph-Johan Back]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ralph-Johan |last=Back |first2=Joakim |last2=Wright |title=Refinement Calculus: A Systematic Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cAEMCAAAQBAJ |origyear=1978 |year=2012 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4612-1674-2 |series=Texts in Computer Science |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and developed by [[Carroll Morgan (computer scientist)|Carroll Morgan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Carroll |editor-last=Morgan |editor2-first=Trevor |editor2-last=Vickers |title=On the Refinement Calculus |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_FPSBwAAQBAJ |date=2012 |origyear=1992 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4471-3273-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an extension of Dijkstra's [[weakest precondition calculus]], where program statements are modeled as [[Predicate transformer semantics|predicate transformers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Back|Wright|1978|page=v}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, to add further support to this approach to programming, he published jointly with Wim Feijen an introductory textbook for first-year students of computer science. The book, first published in Dutch, was entitled ''Een methode van programmeren''. The English edition appeared in 1988 as ''A Method of Programming''.

===On the nature of computer science and computer programming===
Many of his opinions on computer science and programming have become widespread. For example, the programming phrase "two or more, use a for" (a rule of thumb when to use a loop) is sometimes attributed to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Recursion in Grammar and Performance|url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-05086-7_8|publisher = Springer International Publishing|date = 2014-01-01|isbn = 978-3-319-05085-0|pages = 159–177|series = Studies in Theoretical Psycholinguistics|doi = 10.1007/978-3-319-05086-7_8|language = en|first = Edward P.|last = Stabler|editor-first = Tom|editor-last = Roeper|editor-first2 = Margaret|editor-last2 = Speas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the first to make the claim that programming is so inherently complex that, in order to manage it successfully, programmers need to harness every trick and abstraction possible.

Dijkstra was one of the most famous opponents of the engineering view of computing science. Like [[Peter Naur]] and [[Kristen Nygaard]], Dijkstra disliked the very term 'computer science'. [[Computer science]], as Dijkstra pointed out, deserves a better name. He suggests it can be called 'computing science'. Instead of the computer, or computing technology, Dijkstra wanted to emphasize the abstract mechanisms that computing science uses to master complexity. When expressing the abstract nature of [[computing science]], he wrote,

{{quote|A confusion of even longer standing came from the fact that the unprepared included the electronic engineers that were supposed to design, build and maintain the machines. The job was actually beyond the [[electronic technology]] of the day, and, as a result, the question of how to get and keep the physical equipment more or less in working condition became in the early days the all-overriding concern. As a result, the topic became – primarily in the USA – prematurely known as ‘[[computer science]]’ – which, actually, is like referring to [[surgery]] as ‘knife science’ – and it was firmly implanted in people's minds that [[computing science]] is about machines and their peripheral equipment. Quod non [Latin: "Which is not true"]. We now know that electronic technology has no more to contribute to [[computing]] than the physical equipment. We now know that [[programmable computer]] is no more and no less than an extremely handy device for realizing any conceivable mechanism without changing a single wire, and that the core challenge for computing science is hence a conceptual one, viz., what (abstract) mechanisms we can conceive without getting lost in the complexities of our own making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EWD|924|On a cultural gap}}{{cite journal|last=Dijkstra|first=E.W.|title=On a cultural gap|journal=The Mathematical Intelligencer|year=1986|volume=8|issue=1|pages=48–52|url=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD09xx/EWD924.html|doi=10.1007/bf03023921}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''The Humble Programmer'' (1972), Dijkstra wrote: "We must not forget that it is not our [computing scientists'] business to make programs, it is our business to design classes of computations that will display a desired behaviour."

Dijkstra also opposed the inclusion of [[software engineering]] under the umbrella of academic computer science. He wrote that, "As economics is known as "The Miserable Science", software engineering should be known as "The Doomed Discipline", doomed because it cannot even approach its goal since its goal is self-contradictory." And "software engineering has accepted as its charter "How to program if you cannot."."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EWD|1036|On the cruelty of really teaching computer science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality and working style==
[[File:Edsger Dijkstra 1994.jpg|thumb|left|Dijkstra at the blackboard during a conference at [[ETH Zurich]] in 1994]]
{{Cquote|(...) You can hardly blame [[M.I.T.]] for not taking notice of an obscure computer scientist in a small town in the Netherlands.|200px||Dijkstra used to describe himself, in [[Nuenen]] in the mid-1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Shasha, Dennis; Lazere, Cathy: ''Out of Their Minds: The Lives and Discoveries of 15 Great Computer Scientists''. (New York, NY: Springer, 1998, {{ISBN|978-0-387-98269-4}}), p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DijkstraNYT"/&gt;}}
In the world of computing science, Dijkstra is well known as a "character". In the preface of his book ''A Discipline of Programming'' (1976) he stated the following: "For the absence of a bibliography I offer neither explanation nor apology." In fact, most of his articles and books have no references at all.&lt;ref name="Apt, Krzysztof R. 2002"/&gt; This approach to references was deplored by some researchers. But Dijkstra chose this way of working to preserve his self-reliance.

As a university professor for much of his life, Dijkstra saw teaching not just as a required activity but as a serious research endeavor.&lt;ref name="Dijkstra_bio"/&gt; His approach to teaching was unconventional.&lt;ref&gt;Irfan Hyder, Syed (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; His lecturing style has been described as idiosyncratic. When lecturing, the long pauses between sentences have often been attributed to the fact that English is not Dijkstra's first language. However the pauses also served as a way for him to think on his feet and he was regarded as a quick and deep thinker while engaged in the act of lecturing. His courses for students in Austin had little to do with computer science but they dealt with the presentation of mathematical proofs.&lt;ref name="Apt, Krzysztof R. 2002"/&gt; At the beginning of each [[semester]] he would take a photo of each of the students, in order to memorize their names. He never followed a [[textbook]], with the possible exception of his own while it was under preparation. When lecturing, he would write proofs in chalk on a blackboard rather than using overhead foils. He invited the students to suggest ideas, which he then explored, or refused to explore because they violated some of his tenets. He assigned challenging homework problems, and would study his students' solutions thoroughly. He conducted his final examinations orally, over a whole week. Each student was examined in Dijkstra's office or home, and an exam lasted several hours.&lt;ref name="Dijkstra_bio"/&gt;

He was also highly original in his way of assessing people's capacity for a job. When [[Vladimir Lifschitz]] came to Austin in 1990 for a job interview, Dijkstra gave him a puzzle. Vladimir solved it and has been working in Austin since then.&lt;ref name="Apt, Krzysztof R. 2002"/&gt;

Despite having invented much of the technology of software, Dijkstra eschewed the use of computers in his own work for many decades. Even after he succumbed to his UT colleagues' encouragement and acquired a [[Macintosh]] [[computer]], he used it only for [[e-mail]] and for browsing the [[World Wide Web]].&lt;ref name="UTx"&gt;{{Citation | publisher = University of Texas | format = memorial | url = http://www.utexas.edu/faculty/council/2002-2003/memorials/Dijkstra/dijkstra.html | title = In Memoriam Edsger Wybe Dijkstra}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dijkstra never wrote his articles using a computer. He preferred to rely on his [[typewriter]] and later on his [[Montblanc (company)|Montblanc]] pen.&lt;ref name="Apt, Krzysztof R. 2002"/&gt; Dijkstra's favorite writing instrument was the Montblanc Meisterstück [[fountain pen]]. He repeatedly tried other pens, but none ever displaced the Montblanc.

He had no use for [[word processors]], believing that one should be able to write a letter or article without rough drafts, rewriting, or any significant editing. He would work it all out in his head before putting [[pen]] to paper, and once mentioned that when he was a physics student he would solve his homework problems in his head while walking the streets of [[Leiden]].&lt;ref name="Dijkstra_bio"/&gt;
Most of Dijkstra's publications were written by him alone. He never had a secretary and took care of all his correspondence alone.&lt;ref name="Apt, Krzysztof R. 2002"/&gt; When colleagues prepared a [[Festschrift]] for his sixtieth birthday, published by [[Springer-Verlag]], he took the trouble to thank each of the 61 contributors separately, in a hand-written letter.&lt;ref name="Apt, Krzysztof R. 2002"/&gt;

Throughout Dijkstra's career, his work was characterized by elegance and economy.&lt;ref name="Apt, Krzysztof R. 2002"/&gt; A prolific writer (especially as an essayist), Dijkstra authored more than 1,300 papers, many written by hand in his precise script. They were essays and parables; fairy tales and warnings; comprehensive explanation and pedagogical pretext. Most were about mathematics and computer science; others were trip reports that are more revealing about their author than about the people and places visited. It was his habit to copy each paper and circulate it to a small group of colleagues who would copy and forward the papers to another limited group of scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Istrail, Sorin (Brown Univesirty Department of Computer Science Alumni Magazine, Vol 17.2, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; His love affair with [[simplicity]] came at an early age and under his mother's guidance. He once said he had asked his mother whether trigonometry was a difficult topic. She replied that he must learn all the formulas and that furthermore if he required more than five lines to prove something, he was on the wrong track.&lt;ref name="Denken_als_Discpline"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dijkstra|first1=Edsger|title=Denken als Discipline|url=http://www.vpro.nl/speel.POMS_VPRO_212868.html|website=VPRO|publisher=Noorderlicht|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dijkstra was famous for his wit, eloquence, and way with words, such as in his remark, "The question of whether Machines Can Think (…) is about as relevant as the question of whether Submarines Can Swim."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EWD|898|The threats to computing science}}&lt;/ref&gt;; his advice to a promising researcher, who asked how to select a topic for research, "Do only what only you can do".&lt;ref name="Dijkstra_bio"/&gt; Dijkstra was also known for his vocal criticism. As an outspoken and critical visionary, he strongly opposed the teaching of [[BASIC]].&lt;ref name="EWD498"&gt;{{Cite EWD|498|How do we tell truths that might hurt?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many of his more humorous essays, Dijkstra described a fictional company of which he served as chairman. The company was called Mathematics, Inc., a company that he imagined having [[commercialized]] the production of mathematical [[theorems]] in the same way that software companies had commercialized the production of computer programs.  He invented a number of activities and challenges of Mathematics Inc. and documented them in several papers in the EWD series. The imaginary company had produced a proof of the [[Riemann Hypothesis]] but then had great difficulties collecting [[royalties]] from mathematicians who had proved results assuming the Riemann Hypothesis. The proof itself was a [[trade secret]].&lt;ref name="Cite EWD|475"&gt;{{Cite EWD|475}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the company's proofs were rushed out the door and then much of the company's effort had to be spent on [[Software maintenance|maintenance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EWD|539}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more successful effort was the Standard Proof for [[Pythagoras' Theorem]], that replaced the more than 100 incompatible existing proofs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EWD |427}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dijkstra described Mathematics Inc. as "the most exciting and most miserable business ever conceived".&lt;ref name="Cite EWD|475"/&gt; EWD 443 (1974) describes his fictional company as having over 75 percent of the world's market share.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EWD|443}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dijkstra | first = Edsger W | title = Selected Writings on Computing: A Personal Perspective | publisher = Springer-Verlag | location = Berlin | year = 1982 | isbn = 978-0-387-90652-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==EWD manuscripts==
Dijkstra was well known for his habit of carefully composing manuscripts with his [[fountain pen]]. The manuscripts are called EWDs, since Dijkstra numbered them with ''EWD'', his initials, as a prefix. According to Dijkstra himself, the EWDs started when he moved from the Mathematical Centre in [[Amsterdam]] to the Eindhoven University of Technology (then Technische Hogeschool Eindhoven). After going to [[Eindhoven]], Dijkstra experienced a [[writer's block]] for more than a year. Dijkstra distributed photocopies of a new EWD among his colleagues. Many recipients photocopied and forwarded their copies, so the EWDs spread throughout the international computer science community. The topics were computer science and mathematics, and included trip reports, letters, and speeches. These short articles span a period of 40 years. Almost all EWDs appearing after 1972 were hand-written. They are rarely longer than 15 pages and are consecutively numbered. The last one, No. 1318, is from 14 April 2002. Within computer science they are known as the EWD reports, or, simply the EWDs. More than 1300 EWDs have been scanned, with a growing number transcribed to facilitate search, and are available online at the Dijkstra archive of the University of Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = University of Texas | url = http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ | title = Online EWD archive}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Dijkstra's self-confidence went together with a remarkably modest [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]], to the point of being [[:wikt:spartan|spartan]].&lt;ref name="Apt, Krzysztof R. 2002"/&gt; His and his wife's house in [[Nuenen]] was simple, small and unassuming. He did not own a TV, a VCR or a mobile telephone, and did not go to the movies.&lt;ref name="Apt, Krzysztof R. 2002"/&gt; In contrast, he played the piano well and, while in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], liked to go to [[concert]]s. An enthusiastic listener of [[classical music]], Dijkstra's favorite composer was [[Mozart]].&lt;ref name="Dijkstra_bio"/&gt;

==Death==

Dijkstra died on 6 August 2002. According to officials at the University of Texas, the cause of death was cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/10/us/edsger-dijkstra-72-physicist-who-shaped-computer-era.html |title=Edsger Dijkstra, 72, Physicist Who Shaped Computer Era |last=Markoff |first=John |date=10 August 2002 |website=www.nytimes.com |publisher=New York Times |access-date=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence and recognition==

{{Rquote|right|
The difference between a computer programmer and a computer scientist is a job-title thing. Edsger Dijkstra wants proudly to be called a "computer programmer," although he hasn't touched a computer now for some years. (...) His great strength is that he is uncompromising. It would make him physically ill to think of programming in C++.
|[[Donald Knuth]] (1996), an interview with Donald Knuth by Jack Woehr of ''[[Dr. Dobb's Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.drdobbs.com/an-interview-with-donald-knuth/184409858 |author=Woehr, Jack |title=An interview with Donald Knuth |publisher= Dr. Dobb's Journal |date=1 April 1996 |accessdate=12 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In 1972 the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) acknowledged Dijkstra's seminal contributions to the field by awarding him the distinguished Turing Award. The citation for the award reads:&lt;ref name="DijkstraACMtribute"&gt;[http://awards.acm.org/award_winners/dijkstra_1053701.cfm Edsger W. Dijkstra - Award Winner - ACM Awards] (Extract from the Turing award Citation ready by M. Doug McIlroy, chairman of the ACM Turing Award Committee, at the presentation of his lecture on 14 August 1972, at the ACM Annual Conference in Boston.)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote | text=Edsger Dijkstra was a principal contributor in the late 1950's to the development of the [[ALGOL]], a high level programming language which has become a model of clarity and mathematical rigor. He is one of the principal exponents of the science and art of [[programming languages]] in general, and has greatly contributed to our understanding of their structure, representation, and implementation. His fifteen years of publications extend from theoretical articles on [[graph theory]] to basic manuals, expository texts, and philosophical contemplations in the field of programming languages.}}

The introduction given at the awards ceremony is a tribute to Dijkstra:&lt;ref name="DijkstraACMtribute"/&gt;
{{quote | text=The working vocabulary of programmers everywhere is studded with words originated or forcefully promulgated by E.W. Dijkstra – display, [[deadly embrace]], semaphore, go-to-less programming, [[structured programming]]. But his influence on programming is more pervasive than any glossary can possibly indicate. The precious gift that this Turing Award acknowledges is Dijkstra's style: his approach to programming as a high, intellectual challenge; his eloquent insistence and practical demonstration that programs should be composed correctly, not just debugged into [[Correctness (computer science)|correctness]]; and his illuminating perception of problems at the foundations of [[Software design|program design]]. (…) We have come to value good programs in much the same way as we value good literature. And at the center of this movement, creating and reflecting patterns no less beautiful than useful, stands E.W. Dijkstra.}}

In the words of Sir [[Tony Hoare]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society#Fellow|FRS]], delivered by him at Dijkstra's funeral:&lt;ref name="Dijkstra_bio"/&gt;
{{quote | text=Edsger is widely recognized as a man who has thought deeply about many deep questions; and among the deepest questions is that of traditional moral philosophy: How is it that a person should live their life? Edsger found his answer to this question early in his life: He decided he would live as an academic scientist, conducting research into a new branch of science, the science of computing. He would lay the foundations that would establish computing as a rigorous scientific discipline; and in his research and in his teaching and in his writing, he would pursue perfection to the exclusion of all other concerns. From these commitments he never deviated, and that is how he has made to his chosen subject of study the greatest contribution that any one person could make in any one lifetime.}}

Former [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] President [[Peter J. Denning]] wrote about Dijkstra:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Peter J. |last=Denning |title=The Field of Programmers Myth |journal=Comm.

{{quote | text=Edsger Dijkstra, one of the giants of our field and a passionate believer in the mathematical view of programs and programming (...) Over the previous quarter-century, he had formulated many of the great intellectual challenges of the field as programming—the goto statement, structured programming, concurrent processes, semaphores, deadlocks, recursive programming in Algol, and deriving correct programs.}}

The award was first approved in 1969 and the first election was made in 1971 to Dijkstra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roll of Distinguished Fellows |url=http://www.bcs.org/content/conWebDoc/1650 |publisher=[[British Computer Society]] |accessdate=2014-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304025814/http://www.bcs.org/content/conWebDoc/1650 |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the occasion of Dijkstra's 60th birthday in 1990, The Department of Computer Science (UTCS) at the University of Texas at Austin organized a two-day seminar in his honor. Speakers came from all over the United States and Europe, and a group of computer scientists contributed research articles which were edited into a book.&lt;ref name="Dijkstra_bio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Feijen|Gries|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the C&amp;C Foundation of Japan recognized Dijkstra "for his pioneering contributions to the establishment of the scientific basis for computer software through creative research in basic software theory, algorithm theory, structured programming, and semaphores." Dijkstra was alive to receive notice of the award, but it was accepted by his family in an award ceremony after his death.

Shortly before his death in 2002, Dijkstra received the ACM [[PODC Influential-Paper Award]] in [[distributed computing]] for his work on self-stabilization of program computation. This annual award was renamed the [[Dijkstra Prize]] ([[Edsger W. Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing]]) the following year, in his honor.

The Dijkstra Award for Outstanding Academic Achievement in Computer Science ([[Loyola University Chicago]], Department of Computer Science) is named for Edsger W. Dijkstra. Beginning in 2005, this award recognizes the top academic performance by a graduating computer science major. Selection is based on GPA in all major courses and election by department faculty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luc.edu/cs/academics/awards/ Awards: Loyola University Chicago]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Computer Science (UTCS) at the University of Texas at Austin hosted the inaugural Edsger W. Dijkstra Memorial Lecture on 12 October 2010. [[Tony Hoare]], Emeritus Professor at Oxford and Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research, was the speaker for the event. This lecture series was made possible by a generous grant from Schlumberger to honor the memory of Dijkstra.

'''Gongo Primary School''' is a [[Kenya]]n [[co-educational]] day [[primary school]] located in the Central Gem ward of [[Siaya County]], [[Nyanza Province]].

==Operations==
Approximately 625 pupils are enrolled. The student teacher ratio of 48:1 and this means there is 56:8 pupils per classroom in 11 classrooms.

The school is relatively competitive with most of the pupils attaining the average [[Kenya Certificate of Primary Education]] (KCPE) examination points required to join secondary education institutions.

The school recently gave rise to the [[Gongo Warom Secondary School]] to cater for the consequent imbalance between the numbers qualifying for secondary schools and the limited Form 1 places available within the surrounding secondary schools.

'''Henk Buck''' (born [[Dordrecht (Netherlands)|Dordrecht]], 1930) is an [[organic chemistry|organic chemist]]. He studied at the [[University of Leiden]] where he received his [[PhD]] in 1959. He got a [[lector]]ship at the University in Theoretical Organic Chemistry in 1964. For his research he received the Golden Medal of the [[Royal Netherlands Chemical Society]] in 1967. In 1970 he was appointed as professor of Physical Organic Chemistry and Organic Chemistry at the [[Eindhoven University of Technology|University of Technology in Eindhoven]]. Because there was no Chair for Theoretical Chemistry and Biochemistry he gave lectures in organic chemistry, physical organic chemistry, theoretical organic chemistry, biochemistry and biotechnology. From 1988-1991 he was Dean of the Chemical Faculty. For his scientific contributions he became a member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.knaw.nl/nl/leden/leden/3960 |title=H.M. Buck |language=Dutch |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his scientific career he published more than 300 scientific papers spread over a large area of the chemical field. Under his supervision 43 chemical engineers obtained their PhD. The end of his career came prematurely because of a publication in Science in 1990 that had to be retracted because of flawed research.

==Research==
His research in Leiden and later in Eindhoven was focused on [[organic chemistry]] as the homogeneous catalysis of the [[oxidation]] of [[hydrocarbons]] with stable [[carbenium ion]]s as the pentamethylbenzyl cation &lt;ref&gt;Van Pelt, P. et al. (1976) "Proton acid catalyzed hydride transfer from alkanes to methylated benzyl cations. Part III: Solvated alkanes as Hydrogen-donating intermediates", ''Journal of the American Chemical Society,''Vol. 98, pp. 5864-5870&lt;/ref&gt; and the chiral induction with the redox couple [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NADH-NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] in the nearly 100% stereospecific hydride transfer to [[ketone]]s and [[imine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Vekemans, J.A.J.M. et al. (1991) "NADH model mediated reduction of C=N substrates: enantio-selective synthesis of D-and L-phenylglycinates",''Thetrahedron: A symmetry'', Vol.2, pp.&amp;nbsp;949–952&lt;/ref&gt; The latter process is controlled by the out-of-plane orientation of the carboxamide group.&lt;ref&gt;Donkersloot, M.C.A. et al.(1981) "The hydride-donation reaction of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. 2.MINDO/3 and STO-3G calculations on the role of the CONH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;group in enzymatic reactions", ''Journal of the American Chemical Society'', Vol. 103, pp. 6554-6558&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of physical chemistry his work was directed on [[Electron paramagnetic resonance|electron spin resonance]] measurements of phosphoranyl radicals with phosphorus in different geometries as the tetrahedral and the trigonal bipyramidal configuration with the unpaired electron in an equatorial or axial orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Aagaard, O.M. et al. (1990) "Intermolecular effects on the radiogenic formation of electron-capture phosphorus-centered Journalradicals A single-crystal ESR study of diastereoisomeric precursors", ''Journal of the American Chemical Society'', Vol. 112, pp. 938-944&lt;/ref&gt; His contribution to the theoretical organic chemistry was based on [[Ab initio]] calculations of the radiationless transition of [[formaldehyde]]&lt;ref&gt;Van Dijk, J.M.F. et al. (1978) "''Ab initio'' CI calculation of the radiationless transition of the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''n''pi)state of formaldehyde", ''Journal of the Chemical Physics'', Vol. 69, pp. 2462-2473&lt;/ref&gt; and ab initio calculations of single vibronic level [[fluorescence]] emission spectra and absolute radiative lifetimes of formaldehyde.&lt;ref&gt;Van Dijk, J.M.F. et al. (1978) "''Ab initio'' CI calculation of single vibronic level fluorescence emission spectra and absolute radiative lifetimes of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO(&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)",'' Journal of the Chemical Physics'', Vol. 70, pp. 2854-2858&lt;/ref&gt; Further he investigated deviations of the Woodward-Hoffmann rules as the photochemical [1,3]-OH shift in 2-propen-1-ol.&lt;ref&gt;Dormans, G.J.M. et al. (1984) "A quantum chemical study on the mechanism of a photochemical {1,3]-OH shift in 2-propen-1-ol", ''Journal of the American Chemical Society'', Vol. 106, pp. 1213-1216&lt;/ref&gt; Here the stereochemical outcome is determined by relaxation of the excited double bond. A thermal study of the cis-[1,5]-H shifts in 1,3-pentadiene showed the effect of vibrationally assisted [[Quantum tunneling|tunneling]] in this geometric orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Dormans, G.J.M. et al. (1984) " Mechanism of the thermal [1,5]-H shift in ''cis'' 1,3-pentadiene. Kinetic isotope effect and vibrationally assisted tunneling", ''Journal of the American Chemical Society'', Vol. 106, pp. 3253-3258&lt;/ref&gt;

A special topic in his research was [[organophosphorus chemistry]]. An important aspect of this project was based on the possibility of [[phosphorus]] (IV) to accommodate a fifth [[ligand]] under formation of a [[trigonal bipyramid]] which shows a number of unique properties. The significance of this geometrical change has been demonstrated in the conformational transmission in DNA for the B-Z transition with alternating CpG units under selective phosphate shielding.&lt;ref&gt;Van Lier, J.J.C. et al. (1983) ''B''-''Z'' transition in methylated DNA. A quantum-chemical study", ''European Journal of Biochemistry'', Vol. 132, pp. 55-62&lt;/ref&gt; This change in geometry of phosphorus was also applicable on the biochemical dynamics of cAMP.&lt;ref&gt;Broeders, N.L.H. et al. (1990)"A 400- and 600- MHz &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR conformational study on nucleoside cyclic 3',5'P&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;-TBP systems. Conformational transmission induces diequatorial orientation of the 3',5'-dioxaphosphorinane ring in a nonchair conformation", ''Journal of the American Chemical Society'', Vol. 106, pp. 7475-7482&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the importance of shielding, the OCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; group was introduced as substitute for O&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; in the study of intermediates for conformational transmission. This also resulted in the [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]] of phosphate-methylated DNAs and RNAs. Methylphosphotriester DNAs were synthesized with 2-12 bases. Neutralization of the charge of the phosphate linkages by (specific) methylation resulted in methylphosphotriester DNAs with very exclusive (bio)chemical properties.&lt;ref name="patent no 0358657"&gt;European Patent entitled Poly(deoxyribonucleotides), pharmaceutical compositions, use and preparation of the poly(deoxyribonucleotides) München 09-06-1993, Patent NO. [http://www.wipo.int/pctdb/en/wo.jsp?IA=WO1988007542&amp;DISPLAY=STATUS 0358657]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of chirality at phosphorus appeared of importance for intra- and intermolecular dynamics. These modified DNAs mimicked the behavior of natural DNA in the absence of stabilizing factors as salts, proteins, and medium factors. In fact a high site-specific hybridization affinity was obtained with complementary natural DNA. In dependence of the bases, ''parallel'' DNA could be synthesized for pyrimidine bases in which the chirality of phosphorus was decisive.&lt;ref&gt;Koole, L.H. et al. (1987) "A parallel right-handed duplex of the hexamer d(T&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;T) with phosphate triester linkages",''Journal of the American Chemical Society'', Vol. 109, pp. 3916-3921&lt;/ref&gt; Phosphate methylation also gave the possibility to synthesize a self-complementary left-handed Z-DNA mini duplex.

After a publication in Science about the inhibition of [[HIV-1]] replication had to be retracted, because it was based on flawed research, he accepted early retirement in 1990.&lt;ref name="Science Publication"&gt;Buck, H.M. e.a. (1990) "Phosphate-Methylated DNA Aimed at HIV-1 RNA Loops and Integrated DNA Inhibits Viral Infectivity", [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/sci;248/4952/208?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;andorexacttitle=or&amp;titleabstract=hiv&amp;andorexacttitleabs=or&amp;fulltext=buck&amp;andorexactfulltext=or&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;sortspec=relevance&amp;fdate=7/1/1880&amp;tdate=4/30/2008&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT,HWELTR ''Science'', 13 April 1990: Vol. 248. no. 4952, pp. 208 - 212.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Science Retraction"&gt;Moody, H.M. e.a. (1990) "Inhibition of HIV-1 Infectivity by Phosphate-Methylated DNA: Retraction", [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/250/4977/125 ''Science'', Vol. 250, pp. 125-126.]&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[#The Buck-Goudsmit controversy|The Buck-Goudsmit controversy]])

At home without any academic support he wrote several articles based on quantum chemical calculations focused on the dynamics of organic reactions, [[electron spin resonance]] of organophosphorus radicals and the hybridization affinity of methylphosphotriester DNA and RNA. The latter subject is published as review articles in [[Nucleosides, Nucleotides &amp; Nucleic Acids]]. In these reviews he gives also a description and explanation of the chemical and corresponding biochemical results of the methylphosphotriester DNA, RNA and related systems. This contribution that is mainly based on the work at Eindhoven also consists of new insights in solid-phase synthesis, B-Z transition, and methyl transfer reactions connected with replicational and transcriptional silencing. Special attention is given to the effect of phosphate shielding on duplex stability. Models based on [[molecular mechanics]] calculations and recent density functional ab initio calculations support the impact of phosphate shielding at the various levels of stability of the DNA duplex.

===The Buck-Goudsmit controversy===
In the mid-80s Henk Buck focused his research on the use of [[Antisense therapy|antisense]] DNA as an inhibitor of virus replication. [[Paul C. Zamecnik]] is generally regarded as the founder of this technique,&lt;ref&gt;Zamecnik P.C. e.a. (1978) "Inhibition of Rous sarcoma virus replication and cell transformation by a specific oligodeoxynucleotide." [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid=75545 ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'' January;75(1)pp. 280-4]&lt;/ref&gt; but already in 1971 [[Paul S. Miller]] created short phosphate methylated DNA-fragments, and considered the possibility of using this as a means of influencing DNA-replication.&lt;ref&gt;Miller P.S. e.a (1971) "Syntheses and properties of adenine and thymine nucleoside alkyl phosphotriesters, the neutral analogs of dinucleoside monophosphates." [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5122782 ''Journal of the American Chemical Society.'' Vol 93, pp. 6657-65]&lt;/ref&gt; Bucks research group focused on the use of this phosphate methylated DNA, in particular because of its neutral electrical properties. In several publications the selectivity and duplex forming were reported.
    
The strong growth of [[HIV]]-infections in those days, commercial interests and patent rights&lt;ref name="patent no 0358657"/&gt; led to the decision to cooperate with the virologist [[Jaap Goudsmit]] of the [[Academic Medical Center]] of [[Amsterdam University]]. Jaap Goudsmit required longer DNA-strands, though, than the ones Buck was testing so far, so a new synthesis route was developed. Jaap Goudsmit tested the new strands on samples of HIV and reported the inhibition of the virus replication.

The results were published in [[Science (journal)|Science]] on April 13, 1990.&lt;ref name="Science Publication"/&gt;

On the eve of the publication, the University of Eindhoven made the news public. It resulted in excited media attention in the Netherlands, and under the pressure Buck publicly stated that he assumed that AIDS would be of the past in a couple of years, although it was agreed not to make such claims. Afterwards he explained, he deliberately had said this to raise more funds for his research, although much later he defended himself by saying that he was provoked by the reporter.
 
Doubts raised immediately after the article appeared in Science. The next day, the [[Leiden University]] professor Van Boom, expert in the field of DNA synthesis, said in a leading Dutch newspaper, that pure phosphate methylated DNA is very difficult to produce, and easily contaminated. Six days after the publication internal criticism came to the surface. Buck colleague, professor Van Boeckel, also an expert in this field, had already criticized Bucks research a year before, and resigned because his warnings were not taken seriously. Van Boeckel had also been working on synthesis of phosphate methylated DNA, and knew how difficult it was to make such DNA-strands. A year before Bucks downfall, he came to the conclusion that Bucks longer strands could not be pure, because Van Boeckels research-assistant Kuijpers noticed that even a short phosphate methylated DNA wasn't stable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=332142&amp;blobtype=pdf Kuijpers, W.H.A. e.a. (1990) "Synthesis of well-defined phosphate-methylated DNA fragments: the application of potassium carbonate in methanol as deprotecting agent", ''Nucleic Acids Research'', Vol. 18, pp. 5197-5205]&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1989 he invited one of Bucks research assistants to test their material on [[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]] equipment in the lab of [[Organon International|Organon]], a Dutch pharmaceutical company. The measurement showed that the test material was not at all pure, but Buck refused to accept this fact. When Van Boeckel showed Buck a draft of the publication of his own research at the end of 1989, it resulted in a confrontation in which the University chose Bucks side. Van Boeckel and Kuijpers were ordered to stop their research, because "it was too expensive and not productive".&lt;ref&gt;Hagendijk (1993) p.401&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The doubts and criticism following the publication in Science led to a heated public debate in several Dutch newspapers and science magazines, and the University eventually acknowledged that the purity of the phosphate methylated DNA was still to be investigated. A committee was formed to investigate the proceedings and their conclusion (30 August 1990) was, that no phosphate methylated DNA could be traced. Also the committee reproached Buck for not paying attention to criticism from within his faculty. As a result Buck was dismissed as dean of the faculty. Goudsmit was requested to test the antisense material once again, but his enthusiasm had cooled, and Buck could not produce the pure phosphate methylated DNA in time.
 
The publication in Science therefore had to be retracted.&lt;ref name="Science Retraction"/&gt;

A second investigating committee reported at the end of the year that the presentation of the results in Science bordered on fraud. The report also said that Bucks behaviour in his group was impermissibly harsh at times. The committee concluded that it disqualified him as a research leader. As a result, Buck accepted early retirement.

Although Jaap Goudsmit generally was regarded as a victim in the affair, half a year later a journalist of a leading newspaper questioned his role in the débâcle. Goudsmit had reported the inhibition of HIV-replication, which was questionable, given the fact that the phosphate methylated DNA was not pure enough. Therefore a third committee investigated the work of Goudsmit and his group as well. The committee concluded that Goudsmit had not checked the quality of Bucks material. Also they saw shortcomings in the interpretation and presentation of the results. The committee concluded that Goudsmits research had been scientifically inadequate. Goudsmit did not go in appeal and could continue his work.

Henk Buck never accepted the outcome of this controversy. Up to this day he persists in his opinion that he could produce sufficiently pure phosphate methylated DNA. In several interviews he said that he feels that he has been pilloried for making a sincere mistake. He published two articles in the scientific magazine ''Nucleosides, Nucleotides and Nucleic Acids'' &lt;ref&gt;Buck, H.M. (2004) "The Chemical and Biochemical Properties of Methylphosphotriester DNA", [http://www.informaworld.com/openurl?genre=article&amp;issn=1525-7770&amp;volume=23&amp;issue=12&amp;spage=1833 ''Nucleosides, Nucleotides and Nucleic Acids'', Vol. 23, pp. 1833 - 1847.]&lt;br&gt;
Buck, H.M. (2007) "The Chemical and Biochemical Properties of Methylphosphotriester DNA and RNA in Comparison with their Corresponding Methylphosphonates. A Dynamic Model Description", [http://www.informaworld.com/openurl?genre=article&amp;issn=1525-7770&amp;volume=26&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=205 ''Nucleosides, Nucleotides and Nucleic Acids'', Vol. 26, pp. 205-222.]&lt;/ref&gt; in which he tries to retrace what happened, and he goes as far as to claim that the investigating committees were wrong.
    
To this day, however, nobody produced pure phosphate methylated DNA strands in the quality Goudsmit required. All the efforts from Miller, Van Boeckel and Buck resulted in short instable fragments.  Recent researches in this field are based on methyl phosphonate or phosphorothioate DNA. At present (2008) only one antisense medication exists, based on phosphorothioate [[oligonucleotide]]: [[Fomivirsen]].

'''Horacio''' "'''Atio'''" '''Castillo III''' (May 26, 1995&amp;nbsp;– September 17, 2017) was a 22-year-old [[Filipinos|Filipino]] student leader who was killed in a [[hazing|hazing incident]] performed by the Aegis Juris Fraternity, a law school fraternity affiliated with the oldest law school in Southeast Asia, the [[University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Civil Law]]. 

The brutality of his death and the fact that the supposed perpetrators are affluent law students and lawyers affiliated with the prestigious Catholic [[University of Santo Tomas]] drew attention of the media to the case. Castillo was also a descendant of Philippine national hero and [[University of Santo Tomas]] alumnus [[Jose Rizal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2017/12/30/Horacio-Atio-Castillo-hazing-death-Rizay-Day-Duterte.html|title=Justice for Atio will soon be served, Duterte tells Rizal descendants|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castillo was also a descendant of the Philippine General [[Miguel Malvar]].

==Personal life==
Castillo figured in a fire in [[Paco, Manila]] 2005 where their whole family was rescued. Castillo finished his secondary education at [[Colegio San Agustin - Makati]], and attended the [[University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Arts and Letters|UST Faculty of Arts and Letters]]. He attained his bachelor degree in [[Political Science]] in 2017, and was admitted to [[University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Civil Law|UST Law]] right after graduation. During his undergraduate years, he was a member of the Students' Democratic Party and The Political Science Forum.

'''Independent Public Schools''' (IPS) refers to an education reform first introduced in [[Western Australia]] in 2009 by the [[Department of Education (Western Australia)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gobby|first=Brad|title=Enacting the Independent Public Schools program in Western Australia|journal=Issues in Educational Research|volume=23|issue=1|pages=19–34|url=http://www.iier.org.au/iier23/gobby.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; An independent public school is a [[Private school|state/public school]] that, while a part of the state education system, has been granted a higher degree of decision-making authority than a regular, non-independent state school.

The term, Independent Public School, has been increasingly used by other state governments in Australia, such as [[Queensland]], to label similar reforms to the governance of their state schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Education Queensland|title=Independent Public Schools|url=http://education.qld.gov.au/schools/independent-public-schools/|publisher=Queensland Government|accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal Australian governments also use the term Independent Public Schools. In February 2014 the [[Minister for Education and Training|Federal Education Minister]], [[Christopher Pyne]], announced a $70 million Independent Public Schools Initiative to support 1500 state schools across Australia to become more [[autonomous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Griffiths|first=Emma|title=Christopher Pyne announces $70 million fund to help public schools go it alone|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-02-03/pyne-plan-for-independent-schools-under-fire/5234536|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Western Australia'''

The Independent Public Schools (IPS) initiative was launched in Western Australia in 2009 by then Education Minister [[Liz Constable|Dr Elizabeth Constable]] and the [[State Premier]] [[Colin Barnett]]. The Independent Public Schools initiative in Western Australia is an opt-in program, meaning schools choose to become an independent public school. In 2009, primary and secondary state schools were invited for the first time to express an interest in becoming an IP school through an application process administered by the Western Australian Department of Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Western Australian Department of Education|title=Overview of the independent public schools initiative|url=http://www.det.wa.edu.au/independentpublicschools/detcms/navigation/information-for-staff/overview-of-the-independent-public-schools-initiative/|accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applying schools need to demonstrate their readiness for increased autonomy and accountability through demonstrating the principal and school administration have prudent and effective financial and [[staff management]] ability. Schools should also demonstrate that there is a benefit to the school of becoming an IP school, and that the school staff and local community support the application. Applications are assessed by an independent panel. In its first round, 34 schools were admitted into the program. These schools began operating as IP schools in 2010. Since 2010, the following number of schools have been admitted into the program: 64 in 2011, 73 in 2012, and 84 in 2013. A further nine new schools opened as Independent Public Schools in 2014. Over half of all public schools have sought to become Independent Public Schools since the initiative began in 2010.

'''''Key Features of IPS in Western Australia'''''

Schools granted IPS status choose to opt into a number of 'flexibilities' or 'authorities'. These include:

* the authority to recruit and appoint staff, including teachers, new graduates and support staff, thereby circumventing the central placement process administered by the Department;
* the authority to determine a school's staffing profile and to create new job descriptions and positions;
* the authority to manage staff leave decisions and staff relief costs;
* the authority to determine a school's professional development priority and program;
* not being obliged to employ from the central recruitment pool, including redeployed staff;
* the authority to manage a one-line budget;
* the authority to award contracts and dispose of assets with values up to $150,000;
* the authority to manage school utilities and facilities (including electricity, gas, water and waste) and to retain savings;
* authority to determine curriculum to suit student needs.

Independent Public Schools are also awarded a recurring payment of between $25,000 - $50,000 for administrative support, and $20,000-$40,000 one-off payments for transition costs.

Independent Public Schools and their principals must:

* create and convene a School Board to oversee the principal's management of the school;
* create a business plan to guide the school for three years;
* produce an annual school report and annual self-assessment;
* be performance managed directly by the Department of Education Director-General. Principals are held accountable through a Delivery and Performance Agreement signed by the Principal, Chair of the School Board and Director-General. The Delivery and Performance Agreement identifies the resources and support the school will receive, programs the school will deliver, student achievement and how it will be monitored, and performance and accountability of the school;
* be subject to financial audits;
* determine and report on the satisfaction levels of students, staff and parents;
* respect the existing industrial platform of the Department of Education which determines staff salaries, wages and conditions;
* comply with relevant legislation, including ''School Education Act 1999'', ''School Education Regulations 2000'', and ''Public Sector Management Act 1994'', and other Government and Department policies and external agreements; 
* comply with the mandated curriculum, as set out by the  ''School Curriculum and Authority Act 1997''.

Independent Public Schools, its principal and board cannot:

* deny the enrollment of students who are eligible to attend their local school (a student who resides in the local area), although the school can enroll students from outside of the local area;
* charge an enrollment fee for students to attend (outside of fees applicable to all public schools);
* exclude students without following the requirements of the ''School Education Act 1999'';
* appoint or dismiss the principal.

'''Research and Criticism'''

The Independent Public Schools initiative has been justified on the grounds that system decentralisation and principal autonomy improves the educational outcomes of students. A review of the Western Australian IPS initiative commissioned by the Department of Education (WA) was undertaken in 2013. This review found that principals welcomed the flexibilities offered by the program. There was no evidence of any change to attendance, suspension or academic achievement. The review noted that it was too early for the initiative to demonstrate an effect on student outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Centre for Program Evaluation|title=Evaluation of the Independent Public Schools Initiative|year=2013|publisher=Department of Education, Western Australia|location=Perth|url=http://www.det.wa.edu.au/independentpublicschools/detcms/independent-public-schools/evaluation-of-the-independent-public-schools-initiative.en?oid=MultiPartArticle-id-14532132}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in Victoria, Australia, following self-managing reforms in that state found no direct cause and effect between the decentralisation of decision-making in planning and resource allocation, and improved learning outcomes of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Caldwell|first=Brian|title=Beyond the self-managing school|year=1998|publisher=Falmer Press|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent review of the literature into the effects of school autonomy concludes there is no causal link between autonomy and improved student learning outcomes, however local decision-making can improve learning outcomes in particular circumstances, such as where there are strong accountability mechanisms and a focus on improving the quality of teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Caldwell|first=Brian|title=Review of related literature for the evaluation of empowering local schools|year=2012|publisher=Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations|location=Canberra}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The OECD has attempted to map the types and levels of autonomy across education systems, and to measure the impact of school autonomy on student performance. A comparison of the 2003 PISA results by the OECD concludes that different facets of school autonomy and accountability are associated with the level of student achievement - students perform better on average in schools with the authority to hire staff, but perform worse in schools with authority over formulating budgets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wobmann|first=L|title=School accountability, autonomy, choice and the level of student achievement: International evidence from PISA 2003. OECD Education Working Papers|year=2007|publisher=OECD Publishing|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comparison of the 2006 PISA results concludes that 'school level autonomy in relation to staffing, educational content and budgeting do not show a significant association with school performance. However, a system-level composition effect appears with regard to school autonomy in educational content as well as budgeting. Students in educational systems giving more autonomy to schools to choose textbooks, to determine course content, and to decide which courses to offer, tend to perform better regardless of whether the schools which individual students attend have higher degrees of autonomy or not'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=OECD|title=PISA 2006 Science Competencies for Tomorrow’s World|year=2007|publisher=OECD|location=Paris|page=252|url=http://www.oecd.org/fr/education/scolaire/programmeinternationalpourlesuividesacquisdeselevespisa/pisa2006results.htm#Vol_1_and_2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comparison of the 2012 PISA results concludes that school systems where schools have more autonomy over curricula and assessments tend to perform better overall, however the relationship between school autonomy and performance within countries is more complex, with factors such as accountability arrangements and teacher-principal collaboration in school management impacting on performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=OECD|title=PISA 2012 Results: What makes schools  successful?  Resources, Policies and Practices Volume 4|year=2012|publisher=OECD Publishing|location=Paris|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9786264201156-en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Scholarly concern is registered about the effects of self-management and the deregulation of school choice that has accompanied it. These effects include: increased administrative burden on principals;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gobby|first=Brad|title=Enacting the Independent Public Schools program in Western Australia|journal=Issues in Educational Research|year=2013|volume=23|issue=1|pages=19–34|url=http://www.iier.org.au/iier23/gobby.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitty|first=Geoff|title=Devolution and choice in education: The school, the state and the market|year=1998|publisher=Open University Press|location=Buckingham}}&lt;/ref&gt; levels of resourcing required to effectively self-govern;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gobby|first=Brad|title=Enacting the Independent Public Schools program in Western Australia|journal=Issues in Educational Research|year=2013|volume=23|issue=1|pages=19–34|url=http://www.iier.org.au/iier23/gobby.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the intensification of 'the gaps between schools serving the rich and those serving the poor, gaps marked by growing differences in school size, student intake, resources and achievement'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lamb|first=Stephen|title=School reform and inequality in urban Australia: A case study of residualising the poor. In International studies in inequality, theory and policy: Volume 3 education theory and public policy|year=2007|publisher=Springer|location=Netherlands|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other research explicitly situates IPS in its political and policy context. IPS has been criticised as a New Public Management reform not directed at improving the educational outcomes of students, but at reforming the public sector, particularly through introducing managerialist and market values, practices and mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fitzgerald|first=Scott|title=Putting the public first? An examination of the implications of the 2009 EAC report. Part two: Independent public schools|year=2011|publisher=Curtin Graduate School of Business|location=Perth}}&lt;/ref&gt; IPS is also understood as a regulatory regime aligned with neoliberal modalities of governing. Using a Foucauldian theoretical approach to the IPS initiative, the rationalities, techniques and practices of IPS have been understood as transforming the identities of principals around the neoliberal norms of entrepreneurship, self-reliance and self-responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gobby|first=Brad|title=Principal self-government and subjectification: the exercise of principal autonomy in the Western Australian Independent Public Schools programme|journal=Critical Studies in Education|year=2013|volume=54|issue=3|pages=273–285|doi=10.1080/17508487.2013.832338|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17508487.2013.832338#.Uu9MLmSSw4Q|accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intellectual inbreeding''' or '''academic inbreeding''' is the practice in [[academia]] of a university's hiring its own graduates to be [[professor]]s.  It is generally viewed as [[Parochialism|insular]] and unhealthy for academia;&lt;ref name="shih"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nus.edu.sg/vco/speeches/2003/soua3.htm |title= State of the University Address |author= Shih Choon Fong |publisher=[[National University of Singapore]] |accessdate=25 December 2008 |date=27 October 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20031227013918/http://www.nus.edu.sg/vco/speeches/2003/soua3.htm |archivedate= December 27, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is thought to reduce the possibility of new ideas coming in from outside sources, just as genetic [[inbreeding]] reduces the possibility of new genes entering into a [[population]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kornguth | first=ML |author2=Miller MH | title=Academic inbreeding in nursing: intentional or inevitable? | journal=Journal of Nursing Education | year=1985 | volume=24 | issue=1 | pages=21&amp;ndash;24 | pmid=2981989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Commission on Graduate Education in Economics]] (COGEE), they recognize it as "a trend for emulation rather than diversification."  Academic inbreeding has also been cited as a major problem in the major universities of the [[People's Republic of China]]&amp;mdash;such as [[Peking University]] and [[Tsinghua University]], which have adopted measures in recent years specifically to combat the practice&lt;ref name="shih"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200307/11/eng20030711_120008.shtml |title=Beijing University: an Ivory Tower in Change |accessdate=25 December 2008 |date=11 July 2003 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040920002337/http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200307/11/eng20030711_120008.shtml |archivedate=20 September 2004 |df= }} ()&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;and [[South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/282/5397/2165c | title=Academic Inbreeding Attacked | accessdate=25 December 2008 | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | date=18 December 1998 | volume=282 | issue=5397 |page=2165 | doi=10.1126/science.282.5397.2165c}}&lt;/ref&gt; A relevant study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Horta |first=Hugo |last2= Yudkevich |first2=Maria |date= Dec 2016 |title=The role of academic inbreeding in developing higher education systems: Challenges and possible solutions |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2015.06.039 |journal= Technological Forecasting and Social Change |volume=113 |pages= 363–372 |doi= 10.1016/j.techfore.2015.06.039 |issn= 0040-1625}}&lt;/ref&gt; also exists that analyzes the issue by considering Russia and Portugal as examples.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12715">The '''International Astronomy Olympiad''' ('''IAO''') is an internationally recognized annual [[astronomy]] scientific-educating event for high school students (14–18 years old), which includes an intellectual competition between these students. It is one of the [[International Science Olympiad]]s.

The [[Eurasian Astronomical Society]] founded the IAO in 1996.

==Competing rounds==
The competing part of IAO consists of three rounds: a theoretical, an observational, and a practical. Problems of the theoretical round involve classical problems in branches of astronomy, astrophysics, space and planetary physics, and maybe hypothetical situations. The observational round involves recognizing stars, constellations, estimating star magnitude and angular distance, working with telescopes or other observational technique. The practical round consists of problems based on data results of observations, solutions propose analysis of these data. The chairman is Michael Gavrilov.

==Aim==
The style of the problems of IAO is aimed at developing imagination, creativity and independent thinking. They stimulate the students to recognize the problem independently, to choose a model, to make necessary suppositions, estimations, to conduct multiway calculations or logic operations. The rounds are not tests of speed or memory or knowledge of formal facts and data, and all basic data and formal facts are provided to the students. The ways of solutions are of the first priority in evaluations of the participants' solutions, while the correct formal final answer (formula or numerical value) does not play the determining role in the evaluation. Participants should have a possibility to exhibit the analytical capacities, and not just to do all procedures by hard rules. Also the jury board does not demand from participants to follow the way of solution that is written by the author or composer of the problem.

The International Astronomy Olympiad is carried out in the spirit of friendship and tolerance, where the competition is a stimulus for showing the participants' capabilities but contacts, exchange of ideas and collaboration between students, teachers and scientists from various countries have a primary importance. The competition at the IAO is not the only part of the programme.

==Participants==
The students for IAO are selected during National Olympiads and Camps of the participating states.

Traditionally the teams of [[Armenia]], [[Brazil]], [[Bulgaria]], [[China]], [[Estonia]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Italy]], [[Korea]], [[Lithuania]], [[Moscow metropolitan area|Moscow Land]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Sweden]], [[Serbia]], and [[Thailand]] take part in the IAO. [[Bangladesh]], [[Crimea]], [[Iran]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]] take part not regularly. [[Croatia]], [[Czech Astronomical Olympiad|Czech Republic]] and [[Kazakhstan]] joined the competition at last years. A few countries plan to join IAO in the nearest future.

[[Moscow metropolitan area|Moscow Land]] and [[Crimea]] send teams apart from [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]]. As organizers of the oldest open astronomical olympiads and competitions (since the 1940s), and due to their historical service in the formation and development of IAO they are considered at IAO as independent states with all rights and duties.

'''J. Donald Monan''', [[Society of Jesus|SJ]] (December 31, 1924 – March 18, 2017) was the Chancellor of [[Boston College]] from 1996 to 2017 and its 24th President from 1972 to 1996—the longest such tenure in the University's history. A native of [[Blasdell, New York]], he joined the [[Society of Jesus]] in 1942. Monan earned a bachelor's degree, a licentiate of philosophy, and a [[Licentiate of Sacred Theology]] at [[Woodstock College]]. He then studied at the [[Université catholique de Louvain]] in Belgium, where he earned a [[Ph.D.]] in philosophy. He was ordained a priest in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Boston College: From the Beginnings to 1990|date=1990|publisher=University Press of Boston College|location=Boston|isbn=0962593400|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to becoming President of Boston College, Monan served as Acting President, Vice President, Academic Dean, Chairman of the Philosophy Department, Professor and Instructor at [[Le Moyne College]].

==Boston College ==

When Monan took over as President, BC was approximately $30 million in debt and its endowment totaled just under $6 million. By the time he retired, the University's endowment had risen to over $500 million and the campus had greatly expanded to include such new buildings as O’Neill Library, Merkert Chemistry Center and Conte Forum.

Monan has served as Chancellor of the University since retiring as President. Monan's memberships include the [[National Leadership Roundtable on Church Management]], the Jesuit Philosophical Association,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sjnen.org/jesuit-jubilee-2012-biographies "2012 Jesuit Jubilarians"]&lt;/ref&gt; New England Province of Jesuits. the [[Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy]], and the [[Massachusetts Historical Society]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14008">'''Lean Higher Education''' (LHE) refers to the adaptation of [[lean thinking]] to higher education, typically with the goal of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of operations. Lean, originally developed at the [[Toyota Motor Corporation]], is a management philosophy that emphasizes "respect for people" and "continuous improvement" as core tenets. Lean encourages employees at all organizational levels to re-imagine services from a customer's point of view, removing process steps that do not add value and emphasizing steps that add the most value. While the concept of "customers" and "products" is controversial in higher education settings, there are certainly diverse stakeholders who are interested in the success of colleges and universities, the most common of which are students, faculty, administrators, potential employers and various levels of government.

Lean in higher education has been applied both to administrative and academic services. Balzer&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lean-Higher-Education-William-Balzer/dp/1439814651] ''Lean Higher Education: Increasing the Value and Performance of University Processes''&lt;/ref&gt; (2010) described such initiatives within university settings, including the critical factors for success and ways to measure progress. He noted that LHE can be effective to  respond to higher education's heightened expectations, reducing expenses in an era of rising costs, meeting demands of public accountability, and leveraging institutional resources to fulfill the educational, scholarship, and outreach missions of higher education. A comprehensive literature review examining Lean's impact on higher education has been published.&lt;ref&gt;Balzer, W.K., Francis, D., Krehbiel, T. &amp; Shea, N. (2016). A review and perspective on Lean in higher education. Quality Assurance in Education. 24(4). http://hdl.handle.net/2374.MIA/5995&lt;/ref&gt; The authors reported that Lean has a significant and measurable impact when used to improve academic and administrative operations. Such improvements are effective at the department/unit level or throughout an entire institution. However, the authors noted that implementing Lean is a serious undertaking that is most impactful if it involves long-term, strategic planning.

Though the application of Lean management in higher education is more prevalent in administrative processes (e.g., admissions, registration, HR, and procurement) it also has been applied to academic processes (e.g., course design and teaching,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=839748&amp;show=abstract M.L. "Bob" Emiliani (2004) "Improving Business School Courses by Applying Lean Principles and Practices,"]&lt;/ref&gt; improving degree programs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=1464406&amp;show=abstract M.L. "Bob" Emiliani (2005) "Using Kaizen to Improve Graduate Business School Degree Programs,"]&lt;/ref&gt; student feedback,&lt;ref&gt;[http://staff.napier.ac.uk/services/PI/sustainable-futures/Documents/RIEStudent%20Feedback_Briefing_050110_01.pdf Edinburgh Napier University "SUSTAINABLE FUTURES BRIEFING: RAPID IMPROVEMENT EVENT (RIE) – Student Feedback (Business School)"]&lt;/ref&gt; and handling of assignments) in an increasing number of cases.

Pioneering academic institutions who have implemented Lean include: [[Cardiff University]] (Wales), [http://www.napier.ac.uk/about/management/sustainable-futures/Pages/Sustainable-Futures.aspx Edinburgh Napier University] (Scotland), [http://www.mtu.edu/improvement/ Michigan Technological University] (USA), [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] (USA), [http://www.abdn.ac.uk/staffnet/governance/business-improvement-1228.php University of Aberdeen] (Scotland), [[University of Central Oklahoma]] (USA), [http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/lean/ University of St. Andrews] (Scotland), [[Winona State University]] (USA) and others. A group of universities in the U.K. have formed LeanHEHub [http://www.leanhehub.ac.uk/]. In Scotland, the [https://www.linkedin.com/groups/Scottish-Higher-Education-Improvement-Network-4913702/about Scottish Higher Education Improvement Network] (SHEIN)  is a collaborative network of HE professionals working within the area of continuous improvement. SHEIN exists to encourage the sharing of resources and best practice, online and face-to-face.

==Lean Principles==

Of great importance in the application of Lean management in any organization is the recognition and daily practice of the Lean principles: "Continuous Improvement" and "Respect for People." The "Respect for People" principle is challenging for management to implement, because most managers have risen to their level of responsibility based on their superior "fire-fighting" skills. With Lean, managers are coaches who guide their employees through a problem solving process. The employee learns how to ask themselves the questions that enable them to solve problems on their own, with the same or better quality that the manager would have achieved. Problems occur when managers cannot relinquish control, resulting in zero-sum (win-lose) outcomes for people and inferior results. In other words, one party gains at another party's expense, and the losers are much less willing to participate in continuous improvement. This outcome impedes teamwork and information flows, and discourages daily efforts by administration, faculty, and staff to improve processes. In order to function properly, Lean management must be understood and practiced in a plus-sum (win-win) manner. The "Respect for People" principle is required in order to sustain continuous improvement [http://leanprofessor.com/blog/2013/12/19/lean-must-do-no-harm/].

==Lean Practices==

The origins of Lean practices date from late 19th- and early 20th-century industrial engineering. Lean practices have evolved over the decades since then to become much easier for non-specialists to understand and use. It is now common for people with backgrounds and interests far from industrial engineering to become highly competent Lean management practitioners. Therefore, the Lean management system has the benefit that everyone in an organization can apply the practices without the need for specialists.

Seminal work in the application of Lean to academic processes was done by Prof. M.L. "Bob" Emiliani&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccsu.edu/page.cfm?p=6554&amp;viewdirid=151778&amp; Prof. M.L. "Bob" Emiliani's faculty home page] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140413184757/http://www.ccsu.edu/page.cfm?p=6554&amp;viewdirid=151778&amp; |date=2014-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when he was at Rensselaer Polytechnic University in the early 2000s and is described in two papers: M.L. "Bob" Emiliani (2004) "Improving Business School Courses by Applying Lean Principles and Practices,"&lt;ref&gt;M.L. "Bob" Emiliani (2004) "Improving Business School Courses by Applying Lean Principles and Practices" [http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=839748&amp;show=abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; and M.L. "Bob" Emiliani (2005) "Using Kaizen to Improve Graduate Business School Degree Programs,".&lt;ref&gt;M.L. "Bob" Emiliani (2005) "Using Kaizen to Improve Graduate Business School Degree Programs" [http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=1464406&amp;show=abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; The former paper describes what individual faculty can do to improve their courses and delivery using Lean principles and practices. The latter paper describes what teams of faculty, staff, administrators, students, alumni, and employers can do to improve their courses using [[kaizen]] (literal translation: "change for the better"). Prof. Emiliani also produced a Kaizen Team Leader's Manual for improving academic courses and programs based on his work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leanprofessor.com/blog/resources/ Bob Emiliani, "Improving Higher Education" (2009), unpublished work]&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of Lean practices in academic processes are described in two papers written by Prof. Emiliani cited above (Refs. 2,3), and in the book ''Lean Higher Education: Increasing the Value and Performance of University Processes''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lean-Higher-Education-William-Balzer/dp/1439814651] ''Lean Higher Education: Increasing the Value and Performance of University Processes''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences Between Lean in Higher Education and Lean in Other Sectors==

Lean in HE follows the same principles and practices of [[Lean management]] as applied in service, manufacturing, or government sectors. Lean management readily takes into account the unique governance structures of higher education institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://asq.org/edu/2009/06/baldrige-national-quality-program/how-to-launch-lean-in-a-university.pdf Alisa Salewski (2009) "How to Launch Lean in a University", ASQ]&lt;/ref&gt; Lean management is responsive to the needs of multiple stakeholders in a non-zero-sum fashion and is therefore well-suited for the governance and ongoing improvement of HEIs.

The business of teaching in, or the back office administration of, Higher Education Institutions (HEI's) is similar to Lean management practiced in other service sectors because teaching and administration consist of repeatable transactional processes, in whole or part. Guidance for Lean implementation in HE administration, and, to a lesser extent in teaching, is presented in the book ''Lean Higher Education, Increasing the Value and Performance of University Processes''.&lt;ref&gt;William K. Balzer (2010) ''Lean Higher Education, Increasing the Value and Performance of University Processes'', Productivity Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact of Lean in Higher Education==

The impact of Lean in HE (namely in academic activities), have been studied and found to be potentially beneficial. The benefits include lead-time reduction, increase in throughput, lower cost, increased student satisfaction scores, etc. Reports analyzing Lean in higher education indicate that Lean principles are being successfully applied.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://standrewslean.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/83/2016/10/Tobias-Langer-Dissertation.pdf Tobias Langer(2011) "The Application of Lean thinking for Improving Processes in Higher Education Institutions; Evidence from three UK case studies", Queens University Belfast]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Y.R. Parasmal, (2009) "Application of Lean Thinking in Higher Education", Strategum Consulting, India [http://www.strategum.in/component/option,com_ionfiles/fileid,13/func,download/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zoe Radnor &amp; Giovanni Bucci (2011) "Analysis of Lean Implementation in UK Business Schools and Universities", Association of Business Schools [http://www.wbs.ac.uk/downloads/news/2011/03/abs-lean-report-exec-summary-march-2011-13008.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Various HE stakeholders will likely perceive their organization to be substantially different or possess unique characteristics compared to other service organizations or businesses using Lean management. These reports, as well as a wide range of empirical results, show such perceptions to be erroneous.

==Criticisms of Lean Management==

The principal criticisms of Lean management are well known, relatively few in number, and have been constant over time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leanprofessor.com/2014/03/05/six-criticisms-lean/ Emiliani (2014) "Same Six Criticisms of Lean"]&lt;/ref&gt; Workers may view Lean management as undesirable if it is incorrectly implemented, because it could make them work harder, they might have less time to spend with customers, and, ultimately, they could lose their jobs. These criticisms, which will surely be voiced by faculty and staff in HE, are predictable &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leanprofessor.com/2013/12/19/lean-must-do-no-harm/ Emiliani (2013) "Lean Must Do No Harm"]&lt;/ref&gt; and the result of zero-sum (win-lose) application of Lean management by senior managers.

Supporters of Lean might assert that Lean management can be conducted in a non-zero-sum (win-win) manner—the criticism is simply a result of misapplication of the central concepts.

[[File:Elementary school teaches more than ABCs DVIDS218937.jpg|thumb|Learning environments are educational approaches, cultures, and physical settings for all types of learners and activities]]
Learning environment can refer to an educational approach, cultural context, or physical setting in which teaching and learning occur. The term is commonly used as a more definitive alternative to "[[classroom]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://edglossary.org/learning-environment/ Eglossary, definition].  Retrieved 2016-04-05&lt;/ref&gt; but it typically refers to the context of educational philosophy or knowledge experienced by the student and may also encompass a variety of learning cultures—its presiding ethos and characteristics, how individuals interact, governing structures, and philosophy. In a societal sense, learning environment may refer to the culture of the population it serves and of their location.  Learning environments are highly diverse in use, learning styles, organization, and educational institution.  The culture and context of a place or organization includes such factors as a way of thinking, behaving, or working, also known as [[organizational culture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/culture Mirriam-Webster dictionary].  Retrieved 2016-03-20&lt;/ref&gt;   For a learning environment such as an educational institution, it also includes such factors as operational characteristics of the instructors, instructional group, or institution; the philosophy or knowledge experienced by the student and may also encompass a variety of learning cultures—its presiding ethos and characteristics, how individuals interact, governing structures, and philosophy. In a soearning styles and pedagogies used; and the societal culture of where the learning is occurring.

==History==
The Japanese word for school, gakuen, means "learning garden" or "garden of learning".&lt;ref&gt;[https://misterhilton.wordpress.com/2013/07/07/tanabata-the-star-festival/ Tanabata the star festival, 2013].  Retrieved 2016-04-06&lt;/ref&gt;  The word ''school'' derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|σχολή}} '' ({{lang|grc-Latn|scholē}}''), originally meaning "[[leisure]]" and also "that in which leisure is employed", but later "a group to whom lectures were given, school".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=school Online Etymology Dictionary]. Retrieved 2016-04-06&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%23101960 H.G. Liddell &amp; R. Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon].

[[Direct instruction]] is perhaps civilization's oldest method of formal, structured education and continues to be a dominant form throughout the world.  In its essence it involves the transfer of information from one who is possesses more knowledge to one who has less knowledge, either in general or in relation to a particular subject or idea.  The [[Socratic method]] was developed over two millennia ago in response to direct instruction in the [[scholae]] of [[Ancient Greece]].  Its [[dialectic]], questioning form continues to be an important form of learning in western [[law school|schools of law]].  [[Hands-on learning]], a form of [[Active learning|active]] and [[experiential learning|experiential]] learning, predates language and the ability to convey knowledge by means other than demonstration, has been shown to be one of the more effective means of learning and over the past two decades has been given an increasingly important role in education.

==Operational characteristics==
The operation of the educational facility can have a determining role of the nature of the learning environment.  Characteristics that can determine the nature of the learning environment include:

* '''Organization type:'''  [[State school|state or public school]], [[independent school]], [[parochial school]]; 
* '''Structure:'''  rigidly structured ([[military school]]s) to less structured ([[Sudbury school]], [[Free school movement]], [[Democratic education]], [[Anarchistic free school]], [[Modern School (United States)|Modern Schools or Ferrer Schools]];
* '''Non-institutional:''' [[homeschooling]], [[unschooling]];
* '''Schedule:'''   the length and timing of the [[academic year]] (e.g. [[Year-round school in the United States|year-round schooling]]), class and activity schedules, length of the [[period (school)|class period]], [[block scheduling]];  
* '''Staffing:'''  the number of teachers, [[student-teacher ratio]], single-teacher per room or [[co-teaching]];
* '''Attendance:''' compulsory student until a certain age or standard is achieved;
* '''Teacher certification:'''  varying degrees of professional qualifications;
* '''Assessment:'''  testing and standards provided by government directly or indirectly;
* '''Partnerships and mentoring''':  relationships between the learning environments and outside entities or individuals in general study or chosen fields;
* '''Organizational model:''' departmental, integrated, academy, small school.
* '''[[Curriculum]]:'''  the subjects comprising a course of study.

==Societal culture==
"[[Culture]]" is generally defined as the beliefs, customs, arts, traditions and values of a society, group, place, or time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/culture Mirriam-Webster dictionary].  Retrieved 2016-03-20&lt;/ref&gt;  This may include a school, community, a nation, or a state.  Culture affects the behavior of educators, students, staff, and community.  It often determines curriculum content.  A community's socioeconomic status directly influences its ability to support a learning institution; its ability to attract high caliber educators with appealing salaries; a safe, secure, and comfortable secure facility; and provide even basic needs for students, such as adequate nutrition, health care, adequate rest, and support at home for homework and obtaining adequate rest,

==Pedagogy and learning style==
{{Main|Learning style}}
Several of the key trends in educational models throughout the 20th and early 21st century include progressive education, constructivist education, and 21st century skills-based education.  These can be provided in comprehensive or specialized schools in a variety of [[school organizational models|organizational models]], including departmental, integrative, [[Project-based learning|project-based]], academy, [[Small learning community|small learning communities]], and school-within-a-school.  Each of these can also be paired, at least in part, with [[design-based learning|design-based]], [[virtual school]], [[flipped classroom]], and [[blended learning]] models.

===Passive learning===
{{Main|Passive learning|Direct instruction|Factory model school}}
Passive learning, a key feature of [[direct instruction]], has at its core the dissemination of nearly all information and knowledge from a single source, the teacher with a textbook providing lessons in lecture-style format.  This model has also become known as the "sage on the stage".  A high degree of learning was by [[rote learning|rote]] memorization.  When public education began to proliferate in Europe and North America from the early 19th century, a direct-instruction model became the standard and has continued into the 21st century. Education at the time was designed to provide workers for the emerging factory-based, industrial societies, and this educational model and organization of schools became known as the "[[factory model school]]", with curriculum, teaching style, and assessment heavily standardized and centered around the needs and efficiencies of classroom and teacher management.

===Active learning===
{{Main|Active learning|Progressive education|Constructivism (philosophy of education)}} 
''Active learning'' is a model of instruction that focuses the responsibility of learning on learners, not on teacher-led instruction, a model also termed [[student-centered]]. It is based on the premise that in order to learn, students must do more than just listen: they must read, write, discuss, or be engaged in solving problems. It relates to three learning domains referred to as knowledge, skills and attitudes (KSA) (Bloom, 1956), whereby students must engage in such higher-order thinking tasks as analysis, synthesis, and evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;Renkl, A., Atkinson, R. K., Maier, U. H., &amp; Staley, R. (2002). ''From example study to problem solving: Smooth transitions help learning.'' Journal of Experimental Education, 70 (4), 293–315.&lt;/ref&gt;  Active learning engages students in two aspects – doing things and thinking about the things they are doing (Bonwell and Eison, 1991).  (See [[Bloom's taxonomy]]).

====Differentiated learning==== 
Differentiated learning has developed from an awareness of the effectiveness of different learning styles which have emerged from late 20th/early 21st century neurological research and studies of the different learning styles.  As the impacts of the factory model school's design on learning became more apparent, together with the emerging need for different skills in the late 20th century, so too did the need for different educational styles and different configurations of the physical learning environments.  ''Direct instruction'' is now expanding to include students conducting independent or guided research with multiple sources of information, greater in-class discussion, group collaboration, experiential (hands-on, project-based, etc.), and other forms of active learning.  Direct instruction's "sage on the stage" role for teachers approach is being augmented or replaced by a "guide by the side" approach.
In instruction based on differentiation, the classroom teacher alters the delivery and content of instruction for students based on each student's learning profile, readiness level, and interests &lt;ref&gt; Powell, S.R. &amp; Driver, M.K. "Working with exceptional students: An introduction to special education". San Diego, CA: Bridgepoint Education, Inc., 2013, Section 2.2 &lt;/ref&gt;

====Progressive education====
Progressive education is a [[pedagogical]] movement using many tenets of active learning that began in the late 19th century and has continued in various forms to the present. The term ''progressive'' was engaged to distinguish this education from the traditional Euro-American [[curricula]] of the 19th century, which was rooted in classical preparation for the [[university]] and strongly differentiated by [[social class]]. Progressive education is rooted in present [[experience]].   Many progressive education programs include qualities such as learning by doing (hands-on projects, [[experiential learning]], integrated curriculum, integration of [[entrepreneurship]], [[problem solving]], [[critical thinking]], group work, social skills development, goals of understanding and action instead of rote knowledge, collaborative and [[cooperative learning]] projects, education for [[social responsibility]] and [[democracy]], personalized education, integration of community service, subject content selection based on what future skills will be needed, de-emphasis on textbooks, [[lifelong learning]], and assessment by evaluation of students' projects and productions.

====Constructivist education====
Constructivist education is a movement includes [[active learning]], [[discovery learning]], and [[knowledge building]], and all versions promote a student's free exploration within a given framework or structure. The teacher acts as a facilitator who encourages students to discover principles for themselves and to construct knowledge by working answering open-ended questions and solving real-world problems. [[Montessori education]] is an example of a constructivist learning approach.

===21st century learning===
{{Main|Personalized learning|21st century skills|Blended learning}}  
A 21st century learning environment is a learning program, strategy, and specific content.  All are [[student-centered|learner-centered]] and supported by or include the use of modern digital technologies. Many incorporate key components of active learning.

[[Blended learning]] is a learning program in which a student learns at least in part through delivery of content and instruction via digital and online media with greater student control over time, place, path, or pace than with traditional learning.

[[Personalized learning]] is an educational strategy that offers pedagogy, curriculum, and learning environments to meet the individual student's needs, learning preferences, and specific interests. It also encompasses [[differentiated instruction]] that supports student progress based on mastery of specific subjects or skills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dreambox.com/personalized-learning ''Personalized learning'', Dreambox].  Retrieved 2016-04-06&lt;/ref&gt;

[[21st century skills]] are a series of higher-order skills, abilities, and learning dispositions that have been identified as being required content and outcomes for success in 21st century society and workplaces by educators, business leaders, academics, and governmental agencies.  These skills include core subjects ([[The three Rs]]), 21st century content, collaboration, communication, creativity, critical thinking, [[information and communication technologies]] (ICT) literacy, life skills, and 21st century assessments.

[[Digital literacy]] is becoming critical to successful learning, for mobile and personal technology is transforming learning environments and workplaces alike.  It allows learning—including research, collaboration, creating, writing, production, and presentation—to occur almost anywhere.  Its robust tools support creativity of thought—through collaboration, generation, and production that does not require manual dexterity.  It fosters personalization of learning spaces by teachers and students, which both supports the learning activity directly as well as indirectly through providing a greater feeling of ownership and relevancy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://thejournal.com/articles/2015/08/25/3-ways-mobile-technology-is-transforming-learning-spaces.aspx 3 Ways Mobile Technology Is Transforming Learning Spaces, Dennis Pierce, The Journal, August 25, 2015].  Retrieved 2016-04-07&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizational models==
{{Main|School organizational models}}
Learning environments are frequently organized into six pedagogical and physical models:
* Departmental model
* Integrative model
* Project based learning model
* Academy model
* Small learning communities model
* School-within-a-school model

The [[Linux Professional Institute]] (LPI) currently offers three different certification programs. The core certification program [[#LPIC Program|LPIC (short for Linux Professional Institute Certification)]] contains three different levels addressing distinct aspects of Linux system administration. LPI also offers an introductory Linux certificate called [[#Linux Essentials |Linux Essentials]], as well as a certification testing DevOps tools, called [[#LPI Open Technology Program |Linux Professional Institute DevOps Tools Engineer]].

== Relevance and Updates of the Certifications ==

=== Exam Format ===

[http://www.lpi.org/value-of-certification/our-certification-development-standards LPI exams] are delivered onsite at Linux and open source events, or through the network of the test centres such as Pearson VUE. The exams are made up of multiple choice questions with a single response, multiple choice question with multiple responses, and fill in the blank questions. Linux Essentials is a 60-minute exam with 40 questions, while all other exams are 90 minutes with 60 questions. LPI offers exams in the following languages: English, German, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese (Brazilian), Spanish (Modern), Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional) and Japanese, although not all exams are available in all languages.

=== Exam Objectives ===

The wider community of Linux professionals plays an important part in the objective development process for [http://www.lpi.org/value-of-certification/our-certification-development-standards LPI exams]. Once the LPI staff has developed a structure and description for a certification, community input is collected through a Job Task Analysis. The purpose of the JTA is to poll a large group of Linux professionals about the tasks a candidate would be expected to complete in a certain field. The responses are compiled and have significant influence on the shape the exam objectives.

=== Relevance and Certification Updates ===

As part of the certification maintenance and quality assurance, LPI does the review and revision of the objectives for each certification every three years. The exam items are written and screened by writers and supervisors, respectively. To assure the exam items are accurate and relevant, they are put through a technical review by a group of Linux experts. The following are the current version numbers for each of LPI’s certifications. The version numbers reflect which certifications have been around for the longest, and thus have required more updates over time.

=== Certification Validity ===

LPI is frequently updating its exams to keep pace with the ever-changing open source environment. For this reason, the validity of a LPI certification is 5 years. For example, if it has been over 5 years since candidate passed the LPIC-1, candidate would need to pass it again before receiving a potential LPIC-2 certification. Certifications can be renewed by certifying at a higher level (e.g. acquiring the LPIC-2 certification will renew your LPIC-1 for an additional 5 years). Acquiring an LPIC-3 certification will renew the LPIC-1 and LPIC-2, but not other LPIC-3 certifications. The exception is the Linux Essentials certificate, which has lifetime validity. 

== Essentials Program ==

The Essentials Program was created for candidates who are starting a career in open source or who wish to test their level of Linux knowledge. The knowledge base acquired through the Linux Essentials program can serve as a stepping stone to the more advanced LPIC Professional Certification track for Linux System Administrators.

=== Linux Essentials ===

Linux Essentials is an entry level certification that was introduced in 2012. This certification requires only one exam. It tests the candidate’s ability to use a basic command line editor and demonstrate an understanding of processes, programs and components of the Linux operating system. The Linux Essentials certification is not part of the LPIC and Open Technology certification program.

== LPIC Program ==

The current LPIC certification program consists of the LPIC-1 Certified Linux Administrator, LPIC-2 Certified Linux Engineer, and LPIC-3 Linux Enterprise Professional certifications.

LPIC-1 and LPIC-2 are one track certifications focusing on '''Linux System Administration'''. LPIC-3 level of certifications has several specialities; LPIC-3 300: Linux Enterprise Professional Mixed Environment, LPIC-3 303: Linux Enterprise Professional Security, and LPIC-3 304: Linux Enterprise Professional Virtualization and High Availability.

LPIC-1 and LPIC-2 certifications each require passing two exams, while each LPIC-3 level of certification requires passing a single exam.

Each exam has a series of topics which make up the exam objectives. Each objective has an associated weight that corresponds to the frequency of exam questions from that objective.

=== LPIC-1 ===

LPIC-1 Certified Linux Administrator was first published on 11 January 2000 and was originally called Linux Server Professional (LPIC-1).&lt;ref name="LPI"&gt;[https://www.lpi.org/certification/get-certified-lpi/lpic-1-linux-server-professional/ LPIC-1: Linux System Administrator Certification]&lt;/ref&gt; The certification was revised in 2005, 2012, 2015 and 2018.&lt;ref name="LPI"/&gt;

To be awarded the LPIC-1 certification the candidate must successfully pass two exams, 101 and 102. These can be taken in any order.

LPIC-1 certified professionals have the ability to perform maintenance tasks with the command line, install and configure a computer running Linux and be able to configure basic networking.

Previously the 101 exam was split into two alternative exams, one including questions on the [[RPM Package Manager]], and the other on [[Deb (file format)]]. After the update in 2005 these have been merged into a single exam, and candidates are expected to know about both topics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5801">'''Master of Science in Management''', abbreviated '''MSc''', '''MScM''', '''MIM''' or '''MSM''', is a [[Master of Science]] [[academic degree]]. In terms of content, it is similar to the [[MBA]] degree as it contains general management courses.

According to a [[Financial Times]] ranking, the [[University of St. Gallen]] in Switzerland, [[HEC Paris]] in France offer the best Master in Management programmes in the world in 2016 and 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rankings.ft.com/businessschoolrankings/masters-in-management-2017|title=Business school rankings from the Financial Times - FT.com|website=rankings.ft.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subjects==
Graduates holding an MSc in Management have commonly studied the following subjects:
* [[Business Ethics]]
* Corporate and Business Strategy
* [[Economics]]
* [[Engineering management]]
* [[Entrepreneurship]]
* [[Finance]]
* [[Financial Management]] and [[managerial accounting]]
* [[Human Resources Management]] and [[Organizational Behavior]]
* [[Management Information Systems]]
* Management Theory
* [[Marketing]] or [[Marketing Management]]
* [[Operations Management]] and [[Supply Chain Management]]
* [[Protected Area]] Management
* Personal student [[dissertation]] ([[thesis]])
In [[Canada]], a highly specialized MSc in Management is also quite common (ex: MSc in Management in Finance and Accounting). These degrees are meant to provide students with a highly specialized set of skills for industry or for further academic study.

==Comparison to MBA==
As is the case with the MBA degree, as the number of school granting MSc in Management degrees has grown, so has the diversity of characteristics defining these programs. In most cases, the MSc in Management is an academic degree with no or some requirements for previous job experience, while the MBA is also a professional degree for persons with minimum 2–3 years job experience or 2nd class lower division honorers. However, there are also schools where the MSM degree is granted only to managers with extensive (typically 10 years or more) of work and managerial experience. Whereas MBA programs are open to people from all academic disciplines, about one third of the MSc in Management programs worldwide require a first degree in business or economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Thomas Graf |url=http://www.mim-compass.com/content/download/4362/193346/version/9/file/Global_MIM_Study_2012_Report.pdf/ |title=Global MIM Survey 2012|publisher=Master in Management Compass |date= |accessdate=2012-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some claim the MSc degree is more theory-oriented, and some programs do focus on specific skill set development for managers, while the MBA degree can be more practice-oriented and financially focused. In some schools, the MSc in Management degree studies the academic discipline of [[Management]], while the MBA degree studies the academic discipline of [[Business Administration]].  Thus, some MSc degree programs focus on research in a specialized area, while the MBA degree would place more emphasis on strategy. According to one school, "While the MBA program focuses on the practical application of management theory, the M.Sc. in Management will provide for an advanced-level conceptual foundation in a student’s chosen field, and allow for the pursuit of highly focused research through a master’s level thesis."&lt;ref name="Brock"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bus.brocku.ca/msc/ |title=Master of Science in Management &amp;#124; Brock University |publisher=Bus.brocku.ca |date=2009-10-08 |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both degrees contain strong professional focus and are both very well suited for professionals wishing to improve positions in their respective industries. Most MSc in Management programs contain very directed content geared towards development of a particular set of leadership skills for the mid-career professional looking to improve their credentials. A typical degree MSc in Management can be completed in less than 2 years in an online accelerated program.&lt;ref name="MSUOnline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michiganstateuniversityonline.com/programs/masters-degree/ms-management-strategy-leadership/ |title=Master of Science in Management, Strategy and Leadership |publisher=MSUOnline.com |date=2014-10-23 |accessdate=2014-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, some can be "completed 100% online in as few as 12 months."&lt;ref name="SBU Online"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://online.sbu.edu/programs/master/msl |title=M.A. Strategic Leadership |publisher=online.sbu.edu |date=2016-09-01 |accessdate=2016-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Persons admitted to the degree of MSc in Management are entitled to add the designation ''MSc'' or MSM after their names (e.g. Domeng Gomez MSc), while those holding an MBA can add the designation ''MBA'' (e.g. Domeng Gomez MBA). 
While the MBA degree was started in the [[United States]], the MSc in Management degree is of [[Europe]]an origin. There seems to be a tendency that the demand for MBA is saturated whereas the demand for Masters in Management is increasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCormack |first=Steve |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/special-attention-the-rising-demand-for-masters-in-management-courses-2142804.html |title=Special attention: The rising demand for Masters in management courses - Higher - Education |publisher=The Independent |date=2010-11-25 |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15184">'''Neutral buoyancy simulation''' with astronauts immersed in a [[neutral buoyancy pool]], in pressure suits, can help to prepare astronauts for the difficult task of working while outside a spacecraft in an apparently weightless environment.

==History==
{{For|a list of neutral buoyancy facilities|Neutral buoyancy pool}}
[[Extra-vehicular activity]] (EVA), working outside the space vehicle, was one of the goals of the [[Project Gemini|Gemini Program]] during the 1960s. The [[astronaut]]s were trained in the “zero gravity” condition by flying a [[parabolic trajectory]] in an [[Reduced gravity aircraft|aircraft]] that caused reduced gravity for thirty second intervals.

===Pioneers without sufficient training===
The Russian [[Astronaut|cosmonaut]] [[Alexey Leonov]] was the first to egress his vehicle while travelling in orbit above the earth. Shortly after, [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]], [[Gemini 4|Gemini IV]], was the first American astronaut to egress a vehicle while in space. These were demonstrations of a capability to get out of and back into the vehicle but included no EVA tasks. The next three flights to demonstrate an EVA capability were [[Gemini 9A|Gemini IX-A]], [[Gemini 10|X]], and [[Gemini 11|XI]]. Each of these flights exposed problems with performance of EVA tasks. Working in pressure suits while in the constant weightlessness of orbital spaceflight was more complex and difficult than had been anticipated. [[NASA]] determined that training for EVA tasks required further development.&lt;ref&gt;Barton C. Hacker and James M. Grimwood, [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4203/cover.htm ''On The Shoulders of Titans: A History of Project Gemini'']. NASA Special Publication-4203 1977 (p. 356 of original hardback publication).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins of neutral buoyancy training===
In July 1966 the [[Project Gemini|Gemini Program]] joined in a [[NASA]] [[Langley Research Center]] contract to include an evaluation of Gemini EVA tasks.&lt;ref name="NAS1-4059"&gt;Otto F. Trout, Jr., Harry L. Loats, Jr., and G. Samuel Mattingly [http://crgis.ndc.nasa.gov/crgis/images/0/02/TND-3054.pdf "NASA Contract NAS1-4059 with supplemental agreements"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025200639/http://crgis.ndc.nasa.gov/crgis/images/0/02/TND-3054.pdf |date=2011-10-25 }}, January 1966&lt;/ref&gt; The contractor, Environmental Research Associates of [[Randallstown, Maryland|Randallstown, MD]] had already begun developing a neutral buoyancy simulation capability in 1964.  This capability for pressure suited subjects was initially developed in 1964 by utilizing an indoor swimming pool at a private school ([[McDonogh School]] near [[Baltimore]]).&lt;ref name="Trout"&gt;Otto F. Trout, Jr., Harry L. Loats, Jr., and G. Samuel Mattingly [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-GWLIgjGgg&amp;lr=1 "Water Immersion Technique of a Pressure-Suited Subject Under Balanced Gravity Conditions"], 1964&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, these early underwater simulations were simply designed to test the ability of subjects to move about mock-up airlocks and weights were not attached to the subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Neufeld and John B. Charles, "Practicing for space underwater: inventing neutral buoyancy training, 1963-1968." ''ScienceDirect'' 39, no. 3-4 (2015): 149-150.&lt;/ref&gt; Quickly, Environmental Research Associates' submerged testing evolved into proper neutral buoyancy simulation, featuring weighted subjects and numerous safety divers on hand during given sessions.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Neufeld and John B. Charles, "Practicing for space underwater: inventing neutral buoyancy training, 1963-1968." ''ScienceDirect'' 39, no. 3-4 (2015): 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First evaluation by astronauts===
[[Scott Carpenter]] was the first astronaut to evaluate the contractor's operation, in a "[[wet workshop]]" simulation. The task was to remove bolts while in a submerged simulated [[airlock]]. The bolt removal task was designed to create access to a spent [[S-IVB]] dome. Carpenter's evaluation of the simulation was favorable and NASA quickly provided [[mockup]]s of Gemini vehicles and [[Space rendezvous|docking]] components to facilitate further development of EVA capabilities via neutral buoyancy training. Astronaut [[Eugene Cernan|Gene Cernan]] first visited the [[McDonogh School]] indoor pool facility for post-mission evaluation of problems that he encountered during his [[Gemini 9A|Gemini IX-A]]  EVA. NASA then modified the contract to include pre-mission training of [[Gemini 12|Gemini XII]] astronaut, [[Buzz Aldrin]]. Astronaut Cernan also participated in this pre-mission training, as he was in a backup role to Aldrin as pilot of [[Gemini 12|Gemini XII]].
===Gemini XII EVA training===
Aldrin trained for the original Gemini XII EVA version which was then revised to eliminate the task of using a [[manned maneuvering unit]]. Aldrin returned to the [[McDonogh School|McDonogh]] facility and trained for the final version of his EVA.  NASA considered the flight EVA to be a total success, and Aldrin again returned to McDonogh to perform a post-mission evaluation of the EVA.  The post-mission evaluation verified the value of using neutral buoyancy simulation training before attempting all of the EVA tasks while wearing a pressure suit and working in the hostile environment of space. Aldrin himself recognized some minor flaws of neutral buoyancy training, but described the method to have a "considerable advantage" over [[Reduced-gravity aircraft|Keplerian trajectory aircraft]].&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Machel, [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19680006422&amp;hterms=summary+gemini+extravehicular+activity&amp;qs=N%3D0%26Ntk%3DAll%26Ntx%3Dmode%2Bmatchallany%26Ntt%3Dsummary%2Bof%2Bgemini%2Bextravehicular%2Bactivity Summary of Gemini Extravehicular Activity].''NASA Office of Technological Utilization'', 1967: 7-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beyond Gemini===
After the successful EVAs in the Gemini XII mission, NASA constructed tanks for neutral buoyancy simulation: The Water Immersion Facility at the [[Manned Spacecraft Center]] and the [[Neutral Buoyancy Simulator]] at [[Marshall Space Flight Center]]. Following use of those facilities during the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] and [[Skylab]] programs, NASA eventually constructed the Weightless Environment Training Facility at the Manned Spacecraft Center in [[Houston]] and later the [[Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory]], where [[Space Shuttle|Shuttle]] and [[International Space Station|Space Station]] astronauts are trained in neutral buoyancy. Astronauts and cosmonauts also train at the [[Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center]] near [[Moscow]].  These accomplishments were summarized in a feature article published by the [[The Baltimore Sun|Baltimore Sun]] newspaper in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Frank D. Roylance [http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2009-07-19/news/0907170172_1_mcdonogh-school-astronauts-aldrin "Historic Mark"], The Baltimore Sun July 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2011, the [http://www.geminixlv.com/ Gemini XLV Symposium] included a review of these accomplishments by G. Samuel Mattingly and featured remarks by astronauts [[Richard F. Gordon, Jr.|Richard Gordon]], [[Thomas David Jones|Tom Jones]], and [[Buzz Aldrin]].

===Rescuing Skylab===
During the [[Skylab 2]] mission, astronauts [[Pete Conrad|Conrad]] and [[Joseph P. Kerwin|Kerwin]] successfully opened a solar panel that had not automatically deployed after launch.  To perform this task, the astronauts trained underwater in the [[Neutral Buoyancy Simulator]] at the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]].  However, due to differences between the design of the mock-up used for training and what they found at Skylab, the astronauts used makeshift tools and redesigned how they would accomplish the task while they were in outer space.&lt;ref&gt;David J. Shayler, [[British Interplanetary Society|FBIS]], ''Walking in Space'', 2004, p. 213, Praxis Publishing Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==


[[File:Aldrin Gemini XII 5.jpg|thumb|A comparison of the same task during astronaut Aldrin's [[Gemini XII]] EVA]]

===Need for simulation===
Astronauts rehearse [[extra-vehicular activity]] tasks in underwater neutral buoyancy before attempting those tasks in space to gain an understanding that they cannot use their weight to provide a [[force]] and that they may move or reposition themselves if they provide a [[Ground propulsion|propulsive]] force in any [[Euclidean vector|vector]], either planned or inadvertent. Articles describing neutral buoyancy simulation generally point out that the astronaut's spacesuit is made neutrally buoyant but that the astronaut still feels [[Gravitation|gravity]] inside the spacesuit so the fit of the suit is very important, and that moving around in water, a [[Viscosity|viscous]] fluid, creates drag that is not present in EVA.&lt;ref&gt;G. Samuel Mattingly, with John B. Charles, [http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2231/1''"A personal history of underwater neutral buoyancy simulation"'']. The Space Review, February 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Normal gravity experience===
The main purpose for an astronaut to egress the vehicle and go EVA is often to provide a force to push, pull, crank, squeeze or transport an object. While living in normal earth gravity people don’t generally recognize the use of their weight to provide a force. The simple task of opening or closing a door, for example, is complicated when an individual is standing on a slick sheet of ice, so the individual's weight does not provide a [[friction]]al coupling to the ground.  The application of force is an action requiring a reaction and if the individual's feet are slipping, the force application is limited or non-existent. The individual feels gravity standing on the ice but they can’t use their weight to provide traction and they can’t shift their weight to provide [[force]] in a horizontal [[Euclidean vector|vector]] so they can’t force the door. Giving the door a shove and sliding back is using mass inertia and not using the individual's weight. Mass [[inertia]] can also be used during EVA, but doing so in a pressure suit can produce unintended results.

===Comparison===
As stated above (in ''Need for simulation''), the astronaut feels gravity inside the pressurized suit while immersed in water. However the astronaut-spacesuit combination, when properly balanced in neutral buoyancy as when in EVA, is weightless so the astronaut is, similar to standing on ice, unable to use weight to provide a force in any vector. The vector of any force is similar, if not exactly the same in EVA and in neutral buoyancy. The magnitude of the force, if static, is very similar and if dynamic is still similar although the force and vector used in moving large objects must be carefully studied and planned to make the simulation realistic. It is the inability to use weight in any [[Euclidean vector|vector]] in EVA coupled with the encumbrance of the pressure suit that makes task performance difficult.

===Drag===
[[Drag (physics)|Drag]] is the other major concern identified in articles on neutral buoyancy simulation. Any motion in the water is subject to drag and requires a little more time (seconds) and a little more force (ounces) to compensate for drag compared to the same motion in EVA. Early in the history of neutral buoyancy simulation there was consideration of providing the immersed astronaut with small motors to compensate for water drag, but this was soon dismissed as an unnecessary complication. Only a small percentage of time is spent in translating to a new location, usually at low [[velocity]], generally less than 6 inches per second. Even such low velocities are subject to drag but it becomes difficult to measure amid the minor currents in the water caused by other astronauts, divers and the water circulation system that add to or subtract from drag.

===Task performance===
In EVA, most work is done slowly, carefully and methodically not because of the neutral buoyancy training but because that is how a task must be performed by a pressurized astronaut in weightlessness. It takes more force to accelerate a mass to a higher velocity, and then to slow the mass back down, than to move it slowly to its destination. It is also easier to control its movement if it is moving slowly. Thus, the drag of water on movement in neutral buoyancy simply necessitates a slowness of movement that is also appropriate to spaceflight.

===Visual differences===
There are other less obvious but important features that must be considered in underwater EVA training, such as the visual differences due to [[refraction]] at the air-water interface at the helmet's visor and position or attitude in the suit relative to the task. The personnel at the [[Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory]] in [[Houston]] plan and evaluate their simulations meticulously. Experienced EVA astronauts observing a simulation can advise as to how realistic is the task performance and recommend modifications.

===Usefulness to EVA astronauts===
Learning and rehearsing an EVA task in neutral buoyancy gives an astronaut or EVA specialist confidence that the planned task may be accomplished. The timeline developed for task performance is similar to the time required in EVA. In general, it is considered that a task performed and practiced in neutral buoyancy simulation can also be performed in EVA. Neutral buoyancy, properly planned and conducted, works because it is a realistic simulation of the physical requirements of performing a task in EVA.

===Comparison with reduced gravity aircraft===
The other major method used to simulate [[microgravity]] is flight in a [[reduced gravity aircraft]] (a so-called "vomit comet"), an aircraft which performs a number of parabolic climbs and descents to give its occupants the sensation of zero gravity.&lt;ref name="pmid16909881"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Rafiq A, Hummel R, Lavrentyev V, Derry W, Williams D, Merrell RC |title=Microgravity effects on fine motor skills: tying surgical knots during parabolic flight|journal=Aviat Space Environ Med|volume=77|issue=8|pages=852–6|date=August 2006|pmid=16909881|doi=|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asma/asem/2006/00000077/00000008/art00011|accessdate=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reduced-gravity aircraft training avoids neutral-buoyancy training's drag problem (trainees are surrounded by air rather than water), but instead faces a severe time limitation: periods of sustained weightlessness are limited to around 25 seconds, interspersed with periods of acceleration of around 2 [[g-force|''g'']] as the aircraft pulls out of its dive and readies for the next run.&lt;ref name="pmid15806734"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pletser V|title=Short duration microgravity experiments in physical and life sciences during parabolic flights: the first 30 ESA campaigns|journal=Acta Astronautica|volume=55|issue=10|pages=829–54|date=November 2004|pmid=15806734|doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2004.04.006|url=|accessdate=|bibcode=2004AcAau..55..829P}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is unsuitable for practicing EVAs, which usually last several hours.

The '''Northwest Accreditation Commission''' ('''NWAC'''), formerly named the '''Northwest Association of Accredited Schools''', is a non-governmental organization that provides [[Educational accreditation|accreditation]] to educational institutions in the [[Northwestern United States]]. The Commission accredits [[K-12]], [[elementary school|elementary]], [[middle school|middle]], and [[high school]]s; those offering [[distance education]]; non-[[academic degree|degree]]-granting [[Tertiary education|postsecondary]] institutions; and special purpose, supplementary education, travel education, and trans-regional schools in seven [[U.S. state|state]]s in the northwestern United States. Formerly an independent entity based in [[Boise, Idaho]], it is now a division of [[AdvancED]].

The commission operates in seven states: [[Alaska]], [[Idaho]], [[Montana]], [[Nevada]], [[Oregon]], [[Utah]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. The [[Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities]], which also serves this geographic territory, operates as the postsecondary equivalent of the NWAC.

==History==
The organization traces its history to 1917 when the Northwest Association of Secondary and Higher Schools was formed. In 1974 the association changed its name to the Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges. In 2000 it became the Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges and Universities, which disbanded and split into two separate organizations in 2004, with the Northwest Association of Accredited Schools handling the accreditation of schools and the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities handling the accreditation of institutions of higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boisestate.edu/naas/history.shtml |title=History of the Northwest Association of Accredited Schools |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070422115150/http://www.boisestate.edu/naas/history.shtml |archivedate=April 22, 2007}} and [http://www.nwccu.org/About/History/NWCCU%20History.htm Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities History], accessed February 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 the organization's practice of accrediting schools outside its primary service region attracted controversy after it accredited [[Academy at Ivy Ridge|a school]] in [[New York (state)|New York]] that was found to be issuing [[high school diploma]]s without the necessary state authorizations that were supposed to be prerequisites for accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.deseretnews.com/article/600129539/Boise-accreditation-firm-questioned.html Boise Accreditation Firm Questioned] by Ami Joi Bryson, ''Deseret Morning News'', April 27, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Northwest Association officials explained that it had accredited schools located outside its primary service region because they were operated by [[World Wide Association of Specialty Programs and Schools|an organization]] based in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Garifo, [http://www.nospank.net/n-o33r.htm Ivy Ridge accreditation suspended in state probe], ''Watertown Daily Times'', April 15, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012 the Northwest Accreditation Commission became a division of [[AdvancED]], which was formed by the [[North Central Association]] Commission on Accreditation and School Improvement and the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] Council on Accreditation and School Improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.advanc-ed.org/about-us/10-year-anniversary|title=10-Year Anniversary {{!}} AdvancED|last=|first=|date=|website=www.advanc-ed.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded in 1909 as part of the [[Portland Art Museum]], the school was originally known as the '''Museum Art School''' with Anna Belle Crocker serving as the head of the school.&lt;ref name=centennial&gt;{{cite web|title=Centennial|url=http://pnca.edu/about/centennial/c/overview|work=About|publisher=PNCA|accessdate=May 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Pietro Belluschi]] designed home of the museum opened in 1932, the school moved into the upper floors of the building.&lt;ref name=rises&gt;{{cite news|last=Redden|first=Jim|title=Arts campus rises from creative thinking|url=http://www.pamplinmedia.com/pt/9-news/160868-arts-campus-rises-from-creative-thinking|accessdate=February 5, 2014|newspaper=Portland Tribune|date=September 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, the school changed its name to Pacific Northwest College of Art in order to reflect its independence from the museum.&lt;ref name=rises/&gt; The independence was solidified in April 1994 when the college formally split from the art museum and was incorporated as a legal entity distinct from the museum.&lt;ref name=rises/&gt;

In 1998, the college moved to its former campus in Portland's [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]].&lt;ref name=rises/&gt; PNCA hired [[Tom Manley (college president)|Thomas Manley]] in 2003 as president of the institution, replacing Sally Lawrence.&lt;ref name="Culverwell PBJ"&gt;{{cite news|last=Culverwell|first=Wendy|title=Manley leading PNCA's Old Town charge|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/blog/2012/05/specialty-schools-refashioning-old.html?page=all|accessdate=May 3, 2012|newspaper=Portland Business Journal|date=May 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manley proposed a plan to the school's board in 2004 to expand the college and move towards Portland's [[North Park Blocks]].&lt;ref name=rises/&gt; This plan received a boost in 2007 when [[Hallie Ford]] donated $15 million to the school.&lt;ref name=rises/&gt;

The school purchased the building housing the college in 2008, and also that year was given the [[511 Federal Building]] by the federal government as part of a surplus building program.&lt;ref name="Culverwell PBJ"/&gt; In 2009, the then independent Museum of Contemporary Craft moved into the DeSoto Building, which drained the museum's finances.&lt;ref name=rises/&gt; This led to PNCA loaning the museum money, and to a partnership and possible merger.&lt;ref name=rises/&gt;

In 2012, the school announced they would centralize their programs in Portland's Old Town at the 511 Federal Building.&lt;ref name="Culverwell PBJ"/&gt; PNCA opened their first [[residence hall]] in August 2013 at a cost of $7.3 million, called ArtHouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hottman|first=Sara|title=Pacific Northwest College of Art's new student housing designed with visual artists in mind|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2013/08/pacific_northwest_college_of_a_3.html|accessdate=August 31, 2013|newspaper=The Oregonian|location=Portland, Oregon|date=August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of its move to the Old Town area, the college sold its main building in the Pearl District in 2013 for $11.75 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Njus|first=Elliot|title=Pacific Northwest College of Art building sold to Security Properties of Seattle|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/front-porch/index.ssf/2013/10/pacific_northwest_college_of_a_1.html#incart_river_default|accessdate=October 2, 2013|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school secured $20 million in loans from the [[Portland Development Commission]] in November 2013 to fund the renovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Njus|first=Elliot|title=Portland Development Commission approves $20 million loan package for Pacific Northwest College of Art headquarters|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/front-porch/index.ssf/2013/11/portland_development_commissio_1.html#incart_river_default|accessdate=November 14, 2013|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=November 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renovations were completed in January 2015, with classes starting at the new campus in February 2015.&lt;ref name="PBJ new campus"&gt;{{cite news|last=Culverwell|first=Wendy|title=PNCA passes $11M fundraising mark as construction begins on its new campus|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/blog/real-estate-daily/2014/02/pnca-passes-11m-fundraising-mark-as.html|accessdate=February 11, 2014|newspaper=Portland Business Journal|date=February 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=open&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stevens|first1=Suzanne|title=PNCA students settle into gleaming new North Park Blocks Campus|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/blog/real-estate-daily/2015/02/pnca-students-settle-into-gleaming-new-north-park.html|accessdate=3 February 2015|work=Portland Business Journal|date=February 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9027">A '''Practice Enterprise''' (also known as a Practice Firm&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; or Virtual Enterprise&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is a practice company that runs like a real business silhouetting a real enterprise's business procedures, products and services. A Practice Enterprise resembles a real company in its form, organization and function. Each Practice Enterprise trades with other Practice Enterprises, following standard commercial business procedures in the Practice Enterprise worldwide economic environment. It offers a ‘learning-by-doing’ training programme with the aim to better prepare young people for their future careers and to increase their entrepreneurship potential through running their own Practice Enterprise.

==History==
The origins of the Practice Enterprise concept run back to the late 19th Century. Letter exchange clubs were formed in Europe as a way of training commercial communication. The letter exchange clubs became more and more popular and turned into the first practice bureaus around 1920 and were used in a number of countries across Europe.

The first structure to the practice bureaus was the “German Practice Economy” in 1934 and in 1948, the first central office for Practice Enterprises was established by the [[Trade unions in Germany|German Trade Unions]]. Thereby, a real practice firm market was formed which offered for example a database to connect, bank services resembling real bank systems, mail exchanges and trades with other countries, such as Austria, Sweden and Switzerland. In the 1960s, the first central office organising the services provided to the network was formed in the city of Heidelberg in Germany and the first fair for Practice Firms was held in a gymnastic hall in Northern Germany in 1964.

In 1993, a European project was funded by the [[European Social Fund]] and the German Federal State of [[North Rhine-Westphalia|North-Rhine Westphalia]] to connect the different networks around the world to an international association. The European project established the non-profit association EUROPEN which at that time was a department of the Bfz-Essen e.V. in Germany. As the association grew internationally and became an independent entity in 1997, it adjusted its name in 2005 to EUROPEN-PEN International emphasizing the members from across the world.

== Concept, Methodology and Skills ==
The Practice Enterprise concept is applied in different educational systems: from schools, colleges, universities, vocational training institutions&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, companies and further training centres worldwide. The primary target group is students from secondary schools and universities. Adults can also participate in the training programme, either as employees, jobseekers, and people with disabilities or women returning to work.

This applied way of learning, the ‘learning-by-doing’&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; methodology, allows people with all kinds of backgrounds to learn and improve their skills in a Practice Enterprise. Trainees get to know the real-life international business experience and learn and improve important skills such as language and communication skills, intercultural competences and various soft skills which are helpful in finding one’s own path and increase the employability.

Trainees learn many different [[entrepreneurship]] skills&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; such as Administration skills, Accountancy, Computer-based skills ([[Information and communications technology|ICT]]), Human resources management, Marketing and Sales, Purchasing, Business planning, International trade, and Time management. In addition, they also develop the necessary competences to become a better employee or entrepreneur, such as teamwork, problem solving, taking responsibility and developing self-initiative. Because of the international nature of the programme, trainees also learn about intercultural differences when doing business and additionally they have the opportunity to increase their language skills. The skills and competences gained in a Practice Enterprise can easily be transferred and adjusted to other markets, countries and potential work fields.

=== Training Environment and Activities ===
Generally a Practice Enterprise has the same key players and benefits wherever it is located. The trainees are the employees of the Practice Enterprise and run the business themselves whereas the teacher or trainer takes on the role of a mentor or coach.

The setting of a Practice Enterprise provides a way for trainees to learn practically through the ‘[[learning-by-doing]]’ methodology and also to get into the entrepreneurial mindset. The Practice Enterprise programme is designed in such a way that trainees take the responsibility for operating a virtual company and for the sale of products (for example pharmaceuticals, books, food, machinery) and services (for example, shipping, warehousing, events, travel, catering services) and for the revenues and expenditures of their company. Each company engages in business activities, both nationally and internationally with other companies within the Practice Enterprise network (for example, between Brazil and Spain), by following standard commercial business procedures and frameworks.

Each company carries out market research, places advertisements, buys raw materials and stock, plans logistics, manufactures simulated goods, sells simulated goods or services and pays wages, taxes, benefits, etc. The actual transfer of goods and money happens virtually but the following transactions take place for real: orders are made, invoices issued and financial records maintained, including information about creditors, debtors, stock holders, etc.

All trainers involved in the Practice Enterprise programme are trained on workplace facilitation. Trainers receive guidelines and practical handbooks to run the programme and to assess the trainees based on the same set of criteria. Trainers in a Practice Enterprise take on the role of a coach or mentor for trainees, instead of the traditional teacher role.

Most Practice Enterprises have a mentor company that comes from the real business world. A business mentor gives advice and ideas to the trainers and trainees about how a business is run and can advise on the sale of products and services within the virtual business. In some cases, business mentors are involved in the selection and recruitment of staff (e.g. students within the school or university).

There are standard requirements regarding equipment and IT (hardware and software) that need to be met for running the programme. To make the experience as realistic as possible, each classroom is divided into different sections that represent the different departments of a business such as reception, purchasing, human resources, operations and marketing.

Fairs for Practice Enterprises exist nationally as well as internationally and provide a good base to experience and test skills in another setting than the classroom or office. Through the participation in Practice Enterprise Trade Fairs, trainees get to represent their business to other national and international Practice Enterprises in person and also learn the preparation of a fair and booth, the professional representation in front of competitors and the follow-up after trades on the fair ground. During these fairs, a lot of competitions take place, varying from ‘Best Booth’ to other business challenges like elevator pitches and case studies.

A '''reprint''' is a re-[[publication]] of material that has already been previously published. The term ''reprint'' is used with slightly different meanings in several fields.

==Academic publishing==
{{main|Offprint}}
In [[academic publishing]], [[offprint|offprints]], sometimes also known as reprints, are bulk reproductions of individual articles previously published in [[academic journal]]s.&lt;ref name=cart&gt;Carter, John, and Nicolas Barker. (2004) ''ABC for Book Collectors''. 8th edition. New Castle, DE: Oak Knoll. p. 153. {{ISBN|0712348220}}&lt;/ref&gt; Offprints from scientific, technical, and medical (STM) journals are used by researchers in some fields to generate awareness among audiences who don't subscribe to the journal e.g. physicians, consumers, investors etc. They are usually ordered directly from the publisher of the journal. However, some third-party service providers also exist, serving as an intermediary that provides a single source of offprints from multiple publishers.

==Book publishing==
In [[book publishing]], if a reprint has been revised from an earlier version, it is usually referred to as a new [[edition (book)|edition]] rather than a reprint.

==Collectible card games==
In [[collectible card game]]s, a reprint is a [[:wikt:card|card]] published in an earlier card set which is published again in a new card set. Often, the art on the card may be changed, or the text updated to reflect new [[errata]].

==Comic books==
Publishers will reprint classic [[comic book]]s from years or even decades ago, often restoring the art with newer techniques. The reprints may be standalone comic books, compilation trade paperbacks, or back-ups in other comic books.

Comic books which sell out may be given a second (or more) printing in order to bring more copies to the distributor.

The '''Sigurd Olson Environmental Institute''' is an outreach arm of [[Northland College (Wisconsin)|Northland College]] in [[Ashland, Wisconsin]]. A 1971 [[Environmentalism|environmental]] conference at Northland with [[Sigurd Olson]] as a speaker was the origin of the institute. [[Robert Matteson]] was the founder of the Institute. The Institute opened in Spring, 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://upress.umn.edu/Olson/chronology.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617213532/http://upress.umn.edu/Olson/chronology.html |archivedate=2010-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Loonwatch==
LoonWatch, a program of the Sigurd Olson Environmental Institute, protects common loons and their aquatic habitats through education, monitoring, and research. Though their primary focus is Wisconsin, their education and research activities extend to Upper Great Lakes region, such as Michigan and Minnesota. The Watch also lends support to North American conservation efforts by working with loon conservation organizations across the United States and Canada. LoonWatch, its Advisory Council, and volunteers are all working toward common goals of loon conservation and protection.

==Sigurd F. Olson Nature Writing Award==
In 1974, inspirational conservationist and writer Sigurd F. Olson won the John Burroughs Medal for his book, Wilderness Days.
Since 1992, and in the spirit of celebrating Sigurd’s literary legacy, the Sigurd Olson Environmental Institute (SOEI) at Northland College has recognized remarkable environmental adult literature that captures the spirit of the human relationship with the natural world, and promotes the values that preserve or restore the land for future generations. 

Since 2004, the SOEI has recognized a children's book of literacy nature writing—nonfiction or fiction—that captures the spirit of the human relationship with nature, and promotes the awareness, preservation, appreciation, or restoration of the natural world for future generations.

==Land and Water Stewardship==
The Sigurd Olson Environmental Institute has a long history of combining programs, workshops, and outreach activities to assist with environmental protection and restoration in the Lake Superior region. Working collaboratively with private landowners, businesses, public agencies and tribal governments Northland College faculty, staff and students utilize a unique interdisciplinary approach to assessment, monitoring and planning. This collaborative approach provides services to the community and hands on engagement for our students. Current projects cover a spectrum that includes environmental monitoring, outreach education, community-based research, planning, and restoration. Specific examples:
'''Monitoring'''
Wisconsin Department of Transportation: Roy Johnson West Wetland Mitigation Bank, Wal-Mart  Supercenter stormwater basin, John F. Kennedy Memorial Airport Wildlife Hazard Assessment
Wisconsin Department of Transportation: Beartrap Creek Wetland Mitigation Bank groundwater.
'''Outreach Education'''
Brickyard Creek Learning Walks, Citizen Based monitoring, Tree Campus USA, Ecological Restoration
'''Community Based Research'''
Watershed Management: Bay City Creek, Brickyard Creek, Geospatial Interpretation, Multimedia Learning, Green Infrastructure
'''Planning and Restoration'''
Bony Lake shoreline restoration, Beartrap Creek Wetland Mitigation bank, Private Land Stewardship, Fish Creek Watershed Project.

==Lake Superior Binational Forum==
The [[Lake Superior Binational Forum]] is a model partnership of 24 volunteer members from various sectors including small businesses, environmental organizations, industry, Native Americans, First Nations and academia. Its purpose is to provide input and analysis to the governments about critical issues relating to Lake Superior such as discharge of toxic substances, pollution prevention and restoration efforts. The members are also responsible for developing creative new strategies for eliminating pollutants and contributing toward the foundation of a sustainable economy.

==Apostle Island School==

Apostle Island School is an environmental education program aimed at providing regional youth with an outdoor experience to increase students’ awareness of both the regional history and the wide array of local resources of the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore and Lake Superior.

Island School runs each May and is held on various islands in the Apostle Islands archipelago. Sigurd Olson Environmental Institute started developing this unique learning experience in 1985 in cooperation with the Northland College Outdoor Education Department and the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. For 19 years, the program curriculum and instruction has been led by outdoor education students at Northland College as part of their senior capstone. The Apostle Island School program works in collaboration with the Northland College Outdoor Education Department, the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, and the Apostle Island Cruise Service.

The Apostle Island School hosts two different outdoor-educational experiences.
'''Day Trips''':Available for both fifth and sixth-grade students, the day is spent on Madeline Island in search of the island's history, natural ecosystems, geological formation, and growth/development of the historic town of La Pointe. The day includes a ferry ride, visitation of the Madeline Island Historical Museum or Big Bay State Park, Grant's Point Beach, a tour of La Pointe, and memories that will last a lifetime.
'''Residential trips''':Available to sixth-grade students, the two-and-a-half-day excursion begins by boarding an Apostle Islands Cruise Service boat in Bayfield, bound for Stockton Island, home of base camp for the next two nights. During the course of the trip, students will work on developing cooperative skills, participate in group cooking, explore Lake Superior, discover the natural history of the region, learn about the geological formation of the region, and participate in a multitude of fun-filled games.

In ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', Charles Ardai called ''Smart Games Puzzle Challenge 2'' "brain food of a very high order, caviar for the cranium." He summarized it as "the best bunch of brain-busters ever."&lt;ref name=cgw /&gt; Cindy Yans of ''[[Computer Games Magazine|Computer Games Strategy Plus]]'' wrote, "This is simply the most comprehensive puzzle game around. Hands down."&lt;ref name=cgm /&gt;

Writing for ''[[PC Gamer US]]'', Lisa H. Renninger called it "one of the best puzzle collections we’ve seen in a long time", and a vast improvement over its predecessor. She highlighted its "terrific gameplay" and "great puzzle variety".&lt;ref name=pcgamerus /&gt;

The editors of ''Computer Gaming World'' named ''Smart Games Puzzle Challenge 2'' the best puzzle game of 1997, and wrote, "Once again, Smart Games goes for substance rather than flash.

In ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', Charles Ardai wrote of ''Puzzle Challenge 3'', "Almost three years after they set the puzzle game standard, the folks at Smart Games are still the only ones doing it right." Although he felt that the designers had been forced to rely on "sometimes esoteric" puzzles, since their earlier titles included most of the accessible ones, he argued that "no puzzle lover will leave disappointed." Ardai concluded, "Unlike most series, which tend to start running out of steam by their third installment, ''Smart Games' Puzzle Challenge'' still has all of its original spirit and most of its creative spark."&lt;ref name=cgw2 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10865">The series of '''Speaker's Lectures''' were initiated by [[John Bercow]], the [[Speaker of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom]], from 2011. To mark the centenary of the [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949|Parliament Act 1911]], Bercow commissioned a series of 11 lectures throughout 2011 covering some of the main political figures of the century. Each lecture was given to an invited audience in Speaker's House and was recorded for broadcast on [[BBC Parliament]]. In 2012 Bercow instituted a new 11 lecture series on the subject of the 'Great Offices of State' (those of [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Home Secretary]] and [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]]). In 2013 the lectures were on the subject of 'Parliaments and Parliamentarians', given by leading Parliamentarians who have experience of other legislatures. The 2014 series concentrated on 'Parliamentarians on Public Policy'. In 2015 and 2016, Bercow instituted the theme of 'Parliamentarians on Parliamentarians', based on prominent Parliamentarians throughout history. The 2017 series focused on 'The Future of...' various political topics, such as the Press, Armed Forces, or Brexit.

[[File:Congres Team 10 in Otterlo - Team 10 Meeting in Otterlo.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Otterlo]] Meeting 1959 (also CIAM '59), organized by Team 10, 43 participants. Meeting place: [[Kröller-Müller Museum]], located in the [[Hoge Veluwe National Park]]. Dissolution of the organization CIAM.]]
'''Team 10''' — just as often referred to as '''Team X''' or '''Team Ten''' — was a group of architects and other invited participants who assembled starting in July 1953 at the 9th Congress of the [[Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne|International Congresses of Modern Architecture (CIAM)]] and created a schism within CIAM by challenging its doctrinaire approach to [[urbanism]].

==Membership==
The group's first formal meeting under the name of Team 10 took place in [[Bagnols-sur-Cèze]] in 1960. The last, with only four members present, was in Lisbon in 1981.

Team 10's core group consists of [[Pancho Guedes]], Rolf Gutmann, [[Geir Grung (architect)|Geir Grung]], Oskar Hansen,&lt;ref&gt;Stanek, L. ed., Team 10 East. Revisionist Architecture in Real Existing Modernism (Warsaw: Museum of Modern Art/ Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reima Pietilä]], Charles Polonyi, Brian Richards, [[Jerzy Soltan]], [[Oswald Mathias Ungers]], [[John Voelcker]], and Stefan Wewerka.

They referred to themselves as "a small family group of architects who have sought each other out because each has found the help of the others necessary to the development and understanding of their own individual work."&lt;ref name="alison"&gt;Smithson, Alison [ed] ''Team 10 Primer'', [[MIT Press|The MIT Press]], (1968), {{ISBN|0-289-79556-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Team 10's theoretical framework, disseminated primarily through teaching and publications, had a profound influence on the development of architectural thought in the second half of the 20th century, primarily in Europe.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Two different movements emerged from Team 10: the [[New Brutalism]] of the English members (Alison and Peter Smithson) and the [[Structuralism (architecture)|Structuralism]] of the Dutch members (Aldo van Eyck and Jacob Bakema).

==History==
Team 10's core group started meeting within the context of CIAM, the international platform for modern architects founded in 1928.&lt;ref name="Team10online Intro"&gt;http://www.team10online.org [http://www.team10online.org/team10/introduction.html ''Introduction - The Team 10 story''] by Max Risselada &amp; Dirk van den Heuvel.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5486">The '''Theoretical Advanced Study Institute''' or '''TASI''' is a four-week summer school in [[high-energy physics]] or [[astrophysics]] held yearly at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]].  The school is meant primarily for advanced graduate students and consists of a series of pedagogical lectures on selected topics given by active researchers in the field.  TASI is the most common summer school attended by high-energy physics graduate students in the United States.

Writeups of the TASI lectures are traditionally collected into a published volume each year, creating a valuable resource for students hoping to learn about current research topics in an accessible way. The writeups are typically also posted by the lecturers on [[arXiv.org]], providing freely-accessible web-based sources on various physics topics.  Since 2007, TASI has also posted video recordings of the lectures online.

'''UNESCO Chair of Telemedicine''' (UNES_CT) is a portion of [[UNESCO]] that was founded in 1999. It undertakes international activities related to the promotion of the information society and fights against [[technology transfer]] problems having the role of an “intermediate body”. The Chair is the first UNESCO Telemedicine Chair, and his activity is related with development and diffusion of [[Telemedicine]] and Information Society in Health Care in developing areas and undeveloped countries particularly [[South America|South-America]] and [[Africa]].

==Activities==
The expertise of the UNESCO chair of Telemedicine as a University Institution is based in the previous CATAI’s expertise founded in 1994 in the field of Information Society/[[Telemedicine]] with which is collaborating closely and from which received part of the sponsorship.

Activities include: training and teaching aspects, to gain a minimal structured knowledge in [[Medical Informatics]], have established the “Telemedicine Body of Knowledge” covering sociology, economics, technology transfer, technology and organizational issues, standardization, security and liability aspects in co-operation with the Universities of Queens-UK, Aveiro-PT, Belfast-IRL, Genova-IT, Innsbruck-AU, Udine-IT, Berlin-D, Athens-GR. CATAI published the first text-book of Telemedicine in English, complemented with a CD multimedia material particularly designed for developing countries, worldwide known by Winter and Summer Courses of Telemedicine training following the “Telemedicine Body of Knowledge". At the present moment the book is translated into 6 languages (SP, E, IT, GR, FR, D) and is published in Spanish (PanAmerican Editorial) with title : “Telemedicine” 2001.  Is participating in all editions of the European Telemedicine Glossary edited by the EC-DG Information Society. In the 4th Ed-2002 is the author of the Electronic Clinical Record.

==History==
CATAI developed the Videophone network in the [[Canary Islands]] in 1991 for distant support. At the present it includes the best practice implementation pilots in phone medicine (oncology -particularly home-care- and psychiatry -particularly childhood psychiatry), Tele-ECG and Tele-ultrasounds -particularly obstetrics and gynaecology.

First in the world (1991) to carry out distant DNA quantitation, it was applied to image analysis prognostic factors in breast cancer. Objective image analysis and prognostic factors have been incorporated into the regional breast cancer registry of 3000 patients (see above);

CATAI was the promoter of the Centre of Excellence in Telemedicine, sponsored by Science Park DG-XIII, with enrolment of 3 continents: Europe, Africa and America to concentrate best practice examples as well as top experts to implement real world applications and development of hardware-software systems ready to be used. These activities link mainly technological firms of the UK and Germany.

The UNESCO chair was leader of two [[European Union|EU]] projects (Leonardo-DG XXII ; Science Park-DGXIII) and participating in other two (DGXIII- Teleultrasound for developing countries; Leonardo-DGXXII Teaching Medical informatics). Leader in Canary Islands and in the main land - [[Barcelona]]- of a project on Telephonic Medicine. Partner in 5 EU projects ( Smart-USB; KOD or knowledge on demand, ASKLEPIOS, CHS or Citizen Home Services, CATAI-CTC)

UNESCO Chair of Telemedicine was involved in developing countries health support through the Midjan group-ITU-D working group of Telemedicine, TeleInViVo ultrasound devices with pilots in Katastan, Mali and Uganda. Additionally, the UNESCO chair was promoted the network of Telemedicine together with Argentina, Venezuela, Peru, and participated in ITU-Developing Word Congress in Malta 1997, and Georgia Telemedicine meeting in 1999. Is currently actively working with South-America ( Venezuela, Argentina, Cuba, Chile, Peru) and Africa (Uganda, Kenya)

==History==
[[File:At the Chittagong University - CO 1069-511-38 (7831812362).jpg|thumb|Chittagong University in 1970.]]

From the beginning of the 20th century the enlightened section of local people was pressing to set up a university in Chittagong. Necessary grants for the construction of Chittagong University were allocated on 9 March 1964 in the meeting of National Economic Council. 

Professor of History, University of Rajshahi and Ex-Curator of Varendra Research Museum Dr Azizur Rahman Mallick was made the Project Director of Chittagong University on 3 December 1965. He set up the project office of the university at a building 'Kahkashan' on road no 3, Nasirabad Housing Society, Chittagong. All the officers and staffs of the university wing, Department of Education were transferred to the Chittagong University Project office through a gazette notification issued on 14 December 1965. A master plan of the university was prepared through 'Bastukala', an organisation led by Architect Mazharul Islam. Initially a two-storeyed administrative building, departmental offices, classrooms and a library building were built. Student hostels and a teachers' dormitory were also constructed in the first phase.

Dr. Azizur Rahman Mallick was appointed as the first Vice Chancellor of Chittagong University through the Chittagong University Ordinance promulgated on 25 September 1966. The classes of M A (preliminary) of Bangla, English, History and Economics departments under the Faculty of Arts began first from 18 November 1966 with only 200 students and seven teachers. Dr. Abdul Karim joined as the Reader and head of the Department of History while Mohammad Ali and Dr. Shafiul Alam were appointed as Reader and Head of the Departments of English and Economics respectively. Abul Kalam Manzor Morshed joined as a Senior Lecturer in Bangla. Professor Syed Ali Ahsan was the first full professor of Chittagong University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=University_of_Chittagong|title=University of Chittagong - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current Vice-Chancellor, Professor Dr. Iftekhar Uddin Chowdhury  ==
Dr. Iftekhar told , “Our main target is to explore the modern education and research, ensuring information and technology-based study and according to the light of digital thinking of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina”. “University is a family. So, we need cooperation of all the members to run the institution fairly”, he added. 

Earlier on June 2, 2015 President of the country M Abdul Hamid, also chancellor of the CU, had appointed Dr. Iftekhar Uddin as the 17th VC of the university. He thanked President Abdul Hamid, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Education Minister Nurul Islam Nahid. Born on July 1, 1955, at North Kattoli of the port city, Dr. Iftekhar achieved PhD in Sociology from University of Tsukuba in Japan in March 1988. The new VC completed his masters and bachelor degrees from Sociology Department in Chittagong University in 1981 and 1976 respectively. 

He also got Bachelor of Law (LL.B.) from the same university in 1978. Dr Iftekhar was a pro-VC from May 30, 2013 to June, 2015. He served as the chairman of Sociology Department, president of Chittagong University Teachers’ Association (CUTA), and a secretary general of Bangladesh University Teachers’ Federation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.banglanews24.com/education/article/41486/CU-VC-Dr-Iftekhar-takes-charge|title=CU VC Dr Iftekhar takes charge|last=http://www.banglanews24.com|website=www.banglanews24.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{tone|date=September 2014}}
'''Woodcraft''' is a recreational/educational program devised by [[Ernest Thompson Seton]] in 1902, for young people based on camping, outdoor skills and [[woodcraft]]s. Thompson Seton's Woodcraft ideas were incorporated into the early [[Scouting|Scout movement]], but also in many other organisations in many countries.

In the United Kingdom, Quaker Ernest Westlake founded the [[Order of Woodcraft Chivalry]] in 1916. The OWC is the main, family-oriented group that holds activities and camps throughout the year in several Lodges. [[John Hargrave]] broke away from the OWC to found the [[Kibbo Kift|Kindred of the Kibbo Kift]]. Another of the active, surviving UK organisations is the [[Woodcraft Folk]], a socialist group originally affiliated with the Co-Operative movement that broke away from Kibbo Kift in the 1920s. They hold weekly meetings similar to Scouts. Another breakaway from the OWC,  Forest Schools, revived after World War II to form Forest School Camps taking urban children into country areas in the UK.

Formally established in Los Angeles in 1922, the largest and most active [[Woodcraft]] organization is Los Angeles' [[Woodcraft Rangers]], which has a history of providing programs for children in the under-served areas of greater Los Angeles. Currently, Woodcraft Rangers reaches out to over 18,000 at-risk young people annually through enriching after-school and camping programs. The organization’s programs are responsive to social trends and designed to help children mature into healthy, productive adults through positive experiences and age-appropriate challenges. Over the decades Woodcraft Rangers has modified Seton’s original emphasis on outdoor life to incorporate activities that meet the needs of an increasingly urban population, but the goal of changing behavior and encouraging positive outcomes through interaction and education remains central to what they do today. By providing structured activities, a safe environment, and adult guidance after school, Woodcraft Rangers offers a positive alternative to the boredom and negative peer pressures that can lead to [[juvenile delinquency]]. As it has since Seton's time, the agency’s [[American Camp Association]] accredited [[summer camp]] programs at [[Blue Sky Meadow]] focus on outdoor living skills and nature activities. Campers are encouraged to explore and test their strengths and build character in a safe and supportive environment.  After participating in nature hikes, archery, scavenger hunts, map &amp; compass adventures, arts &amp; crafts, survival skills games and star-gazing, campers return home with a better understanding of the outdoor world and greater confidence in their abilities. Summer camp also provides an opportunity for kids to just be kids – to have fun while forging lifelong friendships, developing important skills and discovering new interests.

Many groups were founded elsewhere in Europe in the inter-war years. Typical was the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] Woodcraft League, founded in the 1920s by [[Milos Seifert]]; it grew in its early years but was suppressed for half a century, first by the [[Nazism|Nazis]] and then by the [[Communism|Communists]]. It survived by guile and misdirection, emerging with the fall of Communism, a small but dedicated organisation with members of all ages.

A '''World Heritage site''' is a landmark or area which is selected by the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] ([[UNESCO]]) as having cultural,&lt;ref&gt;Ann Marie Sullivan, Cultural Heritage &amp; New Media: A Future for the Past, 15 J. Marshall Rev. Intell. Prop. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&amp;context=ripl&lt;/ref&gt; historical, scientific or other form of significance, and is legally protected by international treaties. The sites are judged important to the collective interests of humanity.

To be selected, a World Heritage site must be an already classified landmark, unique in some respect as a geographically and historically identifiable place having special cultural or physical significance (such as an ancient ruin or  historical structure, building, city, complex, desert, forest, island, lake, monument, mountain, or [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cobi.12976/full wilderness area]).

The sites are intended for practical conservation for posterity, which otherwise would be subject to risk from human or animal trespassing, unmonitored/uncontrolled/unrestricted access, or threat from local administrative negligence. Sites are demarcated by UNESCO as protected zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Heritage|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/about/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630023048/http://whc.unesco.org/en/about/|archivedate=30 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lists of World Heritage Sites|The list]] is maintained by the international World Heritage Program administered by the UNESCO [[World Heritage Committee]], composed of 21 states parties which are elected by their General Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/comittee/|title=The World Heritage Committee|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Site|accessdate=14 October 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061109181158/http://whc.unesco.org/en/comittee/|archivedate=9 November 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme catalogues, names, and conserves sites of outstanding [[cultural heritage|cultural]] or [[natural heritage|natural]] importance to the common culture and heritage of [[World population|humanity]]. Under certain conditions, listed sites can obtain funds from the World Heritage Fund. The program began with the ''Convention Concerning the Protection of the World's Cultural and Natural Heritage'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/archive/convention-en.pdf Convention Concerning the Protection of World's Cultural and Natural Heritage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704214349/http://whc.unesco.org/archive/convention-en.pdf |date=4 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was adopted by the General Conference of [[UNESCO]] on 16 November 1972. Since then, 193 state parties have ratified the convention, making it one of the most widely recognized international agreements and the world's most popular cultural program.

As of July 2018, a total of 1,092 World Heritage sites (845 cultural, 209 natural, and 38 mixed properties) exist across [[Table of World Heritage Sites by country|167 countries]]. [[List of World Heritage Sites in Italy|Italy]], with 54 sites, has the most of any country, followed by [[List of World Heritage Sites in China|China]] (53), [[List of World Heritage Sites in Spain|Spain]] (47), [[List of World Heritage Sites in France|France]] (44), [[List of World Heritage Sites in Germany|Germany]] (44), [[List of World Heritage Sites in India|India]] (37), and [[List of World Heritage Sites in Mexico|Mexico]] (35).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https:/whc.unesco.org/en/list|title=UNESCO World Heritage Centre - World Heritage List|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, the government of [[Egypt]] decided to build the new [[Aswan Dam|Aswan High Dam]], whose resulting future reservoir would eventually [[Flood|inundate]] a large stretch of the [[Nile]] valley containing cultural treasures of [[ancient Egypt]] and ancient [[Nubia]]. In 1959, the governments of Egypt and [[Sudan]] requested UNESCO to assist their countries to protect and rescue the endangered monuments and sites. In 1960, the Director-General of UNESCO launched an appeal to the member states for an International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/172/ Monuments of Nubia-International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429024818/http://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/172 |date=29 April 2009 }} World Heritage Convention, UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt; This appeal resulted in the excavation and recording of hundreds of sites, the recovery of thousands of objects, as well as the salvage and relocation to higher ground of a number of important temples, the most famous of which are the temple complexes of [[Abu Simbel temples|Abu Simbel]] and [[Philae]]. The campaign, which ended in 1980, was considered a success. As tokens of its gratitude to countries which especially contributed to the campaign's success, Egypt donated four temples: the [[Temple of Dendur]] was moved to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City, the [[Temple of Debod]] was moved to the [[Parque del Oeste]] in Madrid, the [[Temple of Taffeh]] was moved to the [[Rijksmuseum van Oudheden]] in the Netherlands, and the [[Temple of Ellesyia]] to [[Museo Egizio]] in Turin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/173/ The Rescue of Nubian Monuments and Sites] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227222650/http://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/173/ |date=27 February 2015 }}, UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt;

The project cost $80&amp;nbsp;million, about $40&amp;nbsp;million of which was collected from 50 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://whc.unesco.org/en/convention/ The World Heritage Convention], UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt; The project's success led to other safeguarding campaigns: saving [[Venice]] and its [[Venetian Lagoon|lagoon]] in Italy, the ruins of [[Mohenjo-daro]] in Pakistan, and the [[Borobodur]] Temple Compounds in Indonesia. UNESCO then initiated, with the [[International Council on Monuments and Sites]], a draft convention to protect the common cultural heritage of humanity. {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Convention and background===
The United States initiated the idea of cultural conservation with nature conservation. The [[White House]] conference in 1965 called for a "World Heritage Trust" to preserve "the world's superb natural and scenic areas and historic sites for the present and the future of the entire world citizenry". The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] developed similar proposals in 1968, and they were presented in 1972 to the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] in [[Stockholm]]. Under the World Heritage Committee, signatory countries are required to produce and submit periodic [[data reporting]] providing the World Heritage Committee with an overview of each participating nation's implementation of the World Heritage Convention and a "snapshot" of current conditions at World Heritage properties.

A single text was agreed on by all parties, and the "Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage" was adopted by the General Conference of UNESCO on 16 November 1972.

The Convention came into force on 17 December 1975. As of May 2017, it has been ratified by 193 states parties,&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|title=States Parties – UNESCO World Heritage Centre|website=whc.unesco.org|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; including 189 [[UN member states]] plus the [[Cook Islands]], the [[Holy See]], [[Niue]], and the [[State of Palestine]]. Only four UN member states have not ratified the Convention: Liechtenstein, Nauru, Somalia and Tuvalu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/eri/la/convention.asp?KO=13055&amp;language=E Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage: Treaty status] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719235637/http://www.unesco.org/eri/la/convention.asp?KO=13055&amp;language=E |date=19 July 2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nominating process&lt;!--This section is linkedd from Citadel of Arbil--&gt;==

A country must first list its significant cultural and natural sites; the result is called the Tentative List. A country may not nominate sites that have not been first included on the Tentative List. Next, it can place sites selected from that list into a Nomination File.

The Nomination File is evaluated by the [[International Council on Monuments and Sites]] and the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|World Conservation Union]]. These bodies then make their recommendations to the World Heritage Committee. The Committee meets once per year to determine whether or not to inscribe each nominated property on the World Heritage List and sometimes defers or refers the decision to request more information from the country which nominated the site. There are ten selection criteria – a site must meet at least one of them to be included on the list.&lt;ref name="WHS Guidelines"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/guidelines/ | title=The Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention | publisher=UNESCO | accessdate=10 July 2017 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714073431/http://whc.unesco.org/en/guidelines/ | archivedate=14 July 2017 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection criteria==
Up to 2004, there were six criteria for cultural heritage and four criteria for natural heritage. In 2005, this was modified so that there is now only one set of ten criteria. Nominated sites must be of "outstanding universal value" and meet at least one of the ten criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria/|title=Criteria for Selection|publisher=World Heritage|accessdate=14 October 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160612152223/http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria/|archivedate=12 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These criteria have been modified or/amended several times since their creation.

===Cultural criteria===
[[File:Taj Mahal 2012.jpg|thumb|Site#252: [[Taj Mahal]], an example of a cultural heritage site.|alt=Site#252: The Taj Mahal, an example of a world heritage site.]]
&lt;ol type="i" start="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"represents a masterpiece of human creative genius and cultural significance"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"exhibits an important interchange of human values, over a span of time, or within a cultural area of the world, on developments in architecture or technology, monumental arts, town-planning, or landscape design"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"to bear a unique or at least exceptional testimony to a cultural tradition or to a civilization which is living or which has disappeared"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"is an outstanding example of a type of building, architectural, or technological ensemble or landscape which illustrates a significant stage in human history"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"is an outstanding example of a traditional  human settlement, land-use, or sea-use which is representative of a culture, or human interaction with the environment especially when it has become vulnerable under the impact of irreversible change"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"is directly or tangibly associated with events or living traditions, with ideas, or with beliefs, with artistic and literary works of outstanding universal significance"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNESCO World Heritage, The Criteria for Selection|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160612152223/http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria/|archivedate=12 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

===Natural criteria===
[[File:Zerbras drinking.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|Site#156: [[Serengeti National Park]], an example of a natural heritage site.]]
[[File:80 - Machu Picchu - Juin 2009 - edit.2.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|Site#274: [[Machu Picchu|Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu]], an example of a mixed heritage site.]]
&lt;ol type="i" start="7"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"contains superlative natural phenomena or areas of exceptional natural beauty and aesthetic importance"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"is an outstanding example representing major stages of Earth's history, including the record of life, significant on-going geological processes in the development of landforms, or significant geomorphic or physiographic features"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"is an outstanding example representing significant on-going ecological and biological processes in the evolution and development of terrestrial, fresh water, coastal and marine ecosystems, and communities of plants and animals"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"contains the most important and significant natural habitats for in-situ conservation of biological diversity, including those containing threatened species of outstanding universal value from the point of view of science or conservation"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

===Legal status of designated sites===
UNESCO designation as a World Heritage site provides ''[[prima facie]]'' evidence that such culturally sensitive sites are legally protected pursuant to the Law of War, under the [[Geneva Convention]], its articles, protocols and customs, together with other treaties including the [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]] and international law.

Thus, the Geneva Convention treaty promulgates:

"Article 53. PROTECTION OF CULTURAL OBJECTS AND OF PLACES OF WORSHIP. Without prejudice to the provisions of the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict of 14 May 1954,' and of other relevant international instruments, it is prohibited:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=UN General Assembly |authorlink=United Nations General Assembly |date=1979 |origyear=8 June 1977 |title=UN Treaty No. 17512 |series=Treaty Series |url=http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%201125/volume-1125-I-17512-English.pdf |format=PDF |work='Volume 1125-1' UN |page=27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309204240/http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%201125/volume-1125-I-17512-English.pdf |archivedate=9 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
:(a) To commit any acts of hostility directed against the historic monuments, works of art or places of worship which constitute the cultural or spiritual heritage of peoples;
:(b) To use such objects in support of the military effort;
:(c) To make such objects the object of reprisals."

==Extensions and other modifications==
A country may request to extend or reduce the boundaries, modify the official name, or change the selection criteria of one of its already listed sites. Any proposal for a significant boundary change or modify the site's selection criteria must be submitted as if it were a new nomination, including first placing it on the Tentative List and then onto the Nomination File.&lt;ref name="WHS Guidelines"/&gt;

A request for a minor boundary change, one that does not have a significantly impact on the extent of the property or affect its "outstanding universal value", is also evaluated by the advisory bodies before being sent to the Committee. Such proposals can be rejected by either the advisory bodies or the Committee if they judge it to be a significant change instead of a minor one.&lt;ref name="WHS Guidelines"/&gt;

Proposals to change the site's official name is sent directly to the Committee.&lt;ref name="WHS Guidelines"/&gt;

==Endangered sites==
{{main|List of World Heritage in Danger|Former UNESCO World Heritage sites}}

A site may be added to the [[List of World Heritage in Danger]] if there are conditions that threaten the characteristics for which the landmark or area was inscribed on the World Heritage List. Such problems may involve armed conflict and war, natural disasters, pollution, poaching, or uncontrolled urbanization or human development. This danger list is intended to increase international awareness of the threats and to encourage counteractive measures. Threats to a site can be either proven imminent threats or potential dangers that could have adverse effects on a site.&lt;ref name="UNESCO-WHinDanger"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/158/|title=List of World Heritage in Danger|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=10 July 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321040701/http://whc.unesco.org/en/158/|archivedate=21 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state of conservation for each site on the danger list is reviewed on a yearly basis, after which the committee may request additional measures, delete the property from the list if the threats have ceased or consider deletion from both the List of World Heritage in Danger and the World Heritage List.&lt;ref name="WHS Guidelines"/&gt;

Only two sites have ever been [[Former UNESCO World Heritage sites|delisted]]: the [[Arabian Oryx Sanctuary]] in Oman and the [[Dresden Elbe Valley]] in Germany. The Arabian Oryx Sanctuary was directly delisted in 2007, instead of first being put on the danger list, after the Omani government decided to reduce the protected area's size by 90 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/362|title=Oman's Arabian Oryx Sanctuary: first site ever to be deleted from UNESCO's World Heritage List|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=10 July 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118001455/http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/362|archivedate=18 January 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dresden Elbe Valley was first placed on the danger list in 2006 when the World Heritage Committee decided that plans to construct the [[Waldschlösschen Bridge]] would significantly alter the valley's landscape. In response, the Dresden City Council attempted to stop the bridge's construction, but after several court decisions allowed the building of the bridge to proceed, the valley was removed from the World Heritage List in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/522|title=Dresden is deleted from UNESCO’s World Heritage List|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=10 July 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707003437/http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/522/|archivedate=7 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first global assessment to quantitatively measure [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320716310138 threats to Natural World Heritage sites] found that 63 percent of sites have been damaged by increasing [https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12558 human pressures] including encroaching roads, agriculture infrastructure and settlements over the last two decades. These activities endanger Natural World Heritage sites and could compromise their unique values. Of the Natural World Heritage sites that contain forest, 91 percent of those experienced some loss since the year 2000. Many Natural World Heritage sites are more threatened than previously thought and require immediate conservation action.

There are 1092 World Heritage sites located in 167 states. Of these, 845 are cultural, 209 are natural and 38 are mixed properties. The World Heritage Committee has divided the world into five geographic zones which it calls regions: Africa, Arab states, Asia and the Pacific, Europe and North America, and Latin America and the Caribbean.

Russia and the [[Caucasus]] states are classified as European, while Mexico and the Caribbean are classified as belonging to the Latin America &amp; Caribbean zone, despite their location in North America. The UNESCO geographic zones also give greater emphasis on administrative, rather than geographic associations. Hence, [[Gough Island]], located in the South Atlantic, is part of the Europe &amp; North America region because the government of the United Kingdom nominated the site.

The table below includes a breakdown of the sites according to these zones and their classification:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/stat|title=World Heritage List Statistics|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|work=unesco.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514002820/http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/stat|archivedate=14 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&amp;l=en&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;mode=table&amp;order=region|title=UNESCO World Heritage Centre - World Heritage List|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|work=unesco.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027174218/http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&amp;l=en&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;mode=table&amp;order=region|archivedate=27 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
Despite the successes of World Heritage listing in promoting conservation, the UNESCO administered project has attracted criticism from some for perceived under-representation of heritage sites outside Europe, disputed decisions on site selection and adverse impact of mass tourism on sites unable to manage rapid growth in visitor numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barron|first1=Laignee|title='Unesco-cide': does world heritage status do cities more harm than good?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/aug/30/unescocide-world-heritage-status-hurt-help-tourism|accessdate=3 September 2017|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vallely|first1=Paul|title=The Big Question: What is a World Heritage Site, and does the accolade make a difference?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/the-big-question-what-is-a-world-heritage-site-and-does-the-accolade-make-a-difference-997955.html|work=The Independent|date=7 November 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027192333/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/the-big-question-what-is-a-world-heritage-site-and-does-the-accolade-make-a-difference-997955.html|archivedate=27 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sizable [[Lobbying|lobbying industry]] has grown around the awards because World Heritage listing has the potential to significantly increase tourism revenue from sites selected. Site listing bids are often lengthy and costly, putting poorer countries at a disadvantage. Eritrea's efforts to promote [[Asmara]] are one example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Modernist masterpieces in unlikely Asmara|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2016/07/architecture-eritrea?zid=317|work=The Economist|date=20 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170715102559/https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2016/07/architecture-eritrea?zid=317|archivedate=15 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the Australian government was reported to have successfully lobbied for [[Great Barrier Reef]] conservation efforts to be removed from a UNESCO report titled 'World Heritage and Tourism in a Changing Climate'. The Australian government's actions were in response to their concern about the negative impact that an 'at risk' label could have on tourism revenue at a previously designated UNESCO World Heritage site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Slezak|first1=Michael|title=Australia scrubbed from UN climate change report after government intervention|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/27/australia-scrubbed-from-un-climate-change-report-after-government-intervention|work=The Guardian|date=26 May 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027130133/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/27/australia-scrubbed-from-un-climate-change-report-after-government-intervention|archivedate=27 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hasham|first1=Nicole|title=Government spent at least $400,000 lobbying against Great Barrier Reef 'danger' listing|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/government-spent-at-least-400000-lobbying-against-great-barrier-reef-danger-listing-20150914-gjlwr2.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=17 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228235450/http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/government-spent-at-least-400000-lobbying-against-great-barrier-reef-danger-listing-20150914-gjlwr2.html|archivedate=28 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of listed World Heritage locations such as [[George Town, Penang]], and [[Casco Viejo, Panama]], have struggled to strike the balance between the economic benefits of catering to greatly increased visitor numbers and preserving the original culture and local communities that drew the recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maurel|first1=Cholé|title=The unintended consequences of UNESCO world heritage listing|url=https://theconversation.com/the-unintended-consequences-of-unesco-world-heritage-listing-71047|accessdate=4 September 2017|publisher=The Conversation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The World Knowledge Forum''' (WKF, 세계지식포럼) is a non-profit entity, which aims to promote balanced global growth and prosperity through knowledge-sharing. The World Knowledge Forum "brings together global leaders to address the importance of knowledge in meeting the challenges and opportunities of a rapidly changing world".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wkforum.org/WKF/2017/eng/worldforum/introduction.php|title=:: WKF2017 ::|website=www.wkforum.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Knowledge Forum was conceived as part of the Vision Korea Project, a campaign launched by Maeil Business Newspaper in 1997, to "propose new visions for development to Korea and to the global community". The first World Knowledge Forum, entitled ‘Shaping the New Millennium with Knowledge,’ took place in 2000, shortly after the Asian financial crisis.

Partnering with [[The Nikkei|Nikkei]] and [[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]] the Forum has now grown to encompass 1,053 sessions featuring over 4,028 speakers in total from all around the worlds.

In the 19th WKF, the speakers, Janet Yellen,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/12/yellen-says-fed-is-being-thoroughly-sensible-and-not-crazy-like-trump-says.html|title=Yellen says Fed is being 'thoroughly sensible' and not crazy, as Trump says|last=Sheetz|first=Michael|date=2018-10-12|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2014-2018); Kersti Kaljulaid, President of Estonia;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?year=2018&amp;no=629907|title=Maekyung Group’s 19th World Knowledge Forum kicks off in Seoul - Pulse by Maeil Business News Korea|website=pulsenews.co.kr|language=ko|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arancha Gonzalez, Executive Director of International Trade Center (ITC); H.

== History ==
[[File:World Knowledge Forum 20181012.jpg|left|thumb|Delivery Robot session at the 19th forum|alt=|270x270px]]
The World Knowledge Forum (WKF) was founded in October 2000 by Chang Dae-Whan, a Chairman of Maekyung Media Group. Immediately after the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, the Vision Korea Project was launched to formulate ways to move Korea forward. Then in the following year, in 1998, the World Knowledge Forum Secretariat was established with Chairman Chang Dae-Whan presiding over the Forum’s Executive Committee. After two years of preparation, the first World Knowledge Forum was held with the ambition to transform Korea into a knowledge driven nation. Under the theme, “Shaping the New Millennium with Knowledge”, the first forum composed of 32 sessions led by over 90 speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/lifestyle/30354850|title=Seoul to host World Knowledge Forum next month  - The Nation|work=The Nation|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following year, in 2001, the WKF formed media partnerships with prominent media outlets such as Financial Times, Bloomberg, and CNBC that helped the WKF gain its reputation globally. In the same year, the World Knowledge Corps was created.

Since 2010, top MBA courses were incorporated as sessions at WKF. New York University Stern School of Business first joined the WKF to hold an MBA session on finance. Then in 2013, HEC Paris and CEIBS newly joined to host their special MBA sessions. Currently, 6 world’s leading business schools are holding MBA sessions at the WKF.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?year=2014&amp;no=1169491|title=WKF to offer prestigious MBA sessions - Pulse by Maeil Business News Korea|website=pulsenews.co.kr|language=ko|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The schools include INSEAD, IE Business School, NYU Stern, HEC Paris, Tsinghua SEM, and Guanghua School of Management.

Every year, the World Knowledge Forum gathers more than 4,000 business and opinion leaders around the world ranging from environmental and international organizations to world's biggest corporations and institutions. These leaders discuss about the current issues and put forth their insights to find possible solutions for the future. The main aim is to highlight the importance of knowledge sharing towards a balanced prosperity of the global economy. With the new venue at the Seoul Shilla Hotel in 2014, the official season two of the Knowledge Forum began.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?year=2014&amp;no=1063031|title=WKF 2014 to present global leaders’ insight into ‘Invigorating the Global Economy’ - Pulse by Maeil Business News Korea|website=pulsenews.co.kr|language=ko|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 2015, another venue, Jangchung Arena was newly added.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/lifestyle/30354850|title=Seoul to host World Knowledge Forum next month  - The Nation|work=The Nation|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Themes ==
