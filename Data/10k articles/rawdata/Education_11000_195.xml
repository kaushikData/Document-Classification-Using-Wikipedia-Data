'''Albert Paley''' (born 1944) is an American modernist metal [[sculptor]]. Initially starting out as a jeweler, Paley has become one of the most distinguished and influential metalsmiths in the world.&lt;ref name = Corcoran&gt;{{cite book | title = American Metal: The Art of Albert Paley | year = 2014 | publisher = Corcoran Gallery of Art | isbn = 978-0-88675-084-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within each of his works, three foundational elements stay true: the natural environment, the built environment, and the human presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ratcliff | first = Carter | title = Albert Paley in the 21st Century | year = 2010 | publisher = Memorial Art Gallery of the University of Rochester | isbn = 978-0-615-35392-0 | pages = 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paley is the first metal sculptor to have received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the [[American Institute of Architects]].&lt;ref name = aia&gt;{{cite web|title=Lecture by Albert Paley|url=http://aiamiami.org/events/lecture-by-albert-paley/|website=AIA Miami|publisher=AIA Miami|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Albert Paley|url=http://www.craftinamerica.org/artists/albert-paley/|website=Craft in America|publisher=Craft in America|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He currently lives and works in [[Rochester, New York]] with his wife, Frances.

==Early life and education==
He was born in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] during [[World War II]]. While his father fought in the [[Burma Campaign]], Albert and his mother lived with his maternal grandparents.&lt;ref name = Lucie-Smith&gt;{{cite book | last = Lucie-Smith | first = Edward | title = The Art of Albert Paley: Iron &amp; Bronze &amp; Steel | year = 1996 | publisher = Harry N. Abrams, Incorporated | isbn = 0-8109-3748-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Paley’s free-time in his young years became occupied by model-kits and the outdoors. At around age 8, Paley joined the [[Boy Scouts of America]], and even became a face for a billboard for the Boy Scouts. At 16, he dropped out of school with no intention of going to college — he planned to work jobs and support his mother after his father developed [[arthritis]].

It wasn’t until a girlfriend took him to the [[Tyler School of Art]] that Paley found a blossoming passion for the arts.&lt;ref name = Gilbert&gt;{{cite book | last = Gilbert | first = Lela | title = Reconfiguration | year = 2008 | publisher = Pinatubo Press | isbn = 978-0-9742683-2-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; After excelling in a first semester at Tyler, Albert was accepted into the selective honors program where he had a free selection of classes. During his second year at Tyler, Paley became interested in jewelry-making. He became a studio assistant in the school’s metal-shop under the supervision of [[Stanley Lechtzin]], who was a strong influence for Paley.&lt;ref name = Lucie-Smith/&gt;

Paley earned his [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] in sculpting with a minor in [[metalsmithing]] in 1966. After receiving his BFA, Paley was torn between sculpting and metalwork for a master's degree, but eventually settled and earned his [[Master of Fine Arts]] in [[goldsmithing]]. Paley taught full-time while a graduate student, and had stopped experimenting in sculpture, focusing all his time and energy into jewelry work. He received both diplomas from the [[Tyler School of Art]], a part of [[Temple University]], in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name = Lucie-Smith/&gt; He moved to [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1969 to teach at the [[Rochester Institute of Technology]], where he now holds an endowed chair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Albert Paley|url=https://artoncampus.rit.edu/artist/112/|website=RIT Libraries Presents art on Campus|publisher=RIT Libraries, Rochester Institute of Technology|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He taught [[goldsmithing]] until 1972, when he decided to focus solely on his own work.

==Career==

=== Jewelry ===
After receiving his MFA from the Tyler School of Art, Paley worked with metal as a jewelry designer. He became well known for his style and scale. His jewelry was often big and unique, described by Paley himself for “a certain kind of personality that could carry it...for a strong woman rather than someone who was repressed”.&lt;ref name = Lucie-Smith/&gt;&lt;ref name = Sculpadorn&gt;{{cite book |title= Albert Paley: Sculptural Adornment | year= 1991 |publisher= National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution |isbn= 0-295-97152-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his movement toward forging iron and away from jewelry in the 70's, Paley still continued to make jewelry during the beginning of his career in metalworking. Much of his jewelry was made for private commissions, keeping the pieces solely between him and his clients. He eventually stopped making jewelry completely, collecting any pieces in the possession of galleries, and selling all his tools. Since 1965, Paley's jewelry and metal work have been in over one hundred and fifty national and international exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Metalwork of Albert Paley | year = 1980 | publisher = John Michael Kohler Arts Center of the Sheboygan Arts Foundation, Inc. | isbn = 0-932718-06-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Albert_Paley_Renwick_Portal_Gates_for_the_Renwick_Gallery_1994.tif|thumb|right|''Portal Gates'', gate commission for the Renwick Gallery by Albert Paley, 1974, [[Renwick Gallery]]]]

=== Gates &amp; Functional Objects ===
During his last year in the Philadelphia area, Paley began experimenting with metal again, specifically forging iron. He and Lechtzin pulled together a small workshop for forging in the garage of Lechtzin’s home, and spent the summer of 1969 reading about forging and learning how to work with different tools.&lt;ref name = Lucie-Smith/&gt; 
Paley’s big breakthrough was in 1973, when he was awarded a commission from the [[Smithsonian]] to design the portal gates for the [[Renwick Gallery]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] &lt;ref name="npr"&gt;Susan Stamberg (July 22, 2014). [https://www.npr.org/2014/07/22/333596118/with-swirls-of-steel-these-sculptures-mark-the-passage-of-people-and-time With Swirls Of Steel, These Sculptures Mark The Passage Of People And Time] ''[[NPR]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to build the gates, Paley found a space to rent and filled it with machinery. He hired a past student, Richard Palmer, as a full-time assistant, and they spent a year creating the famous [http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=19204 Portal Gates] for the Renwick.
After the Portal Gates, Paley’s career in [[metalworking]] took off, with a focus in functional design: tables, lamps, and other usable forms of sculpture. Paley had created an array of decorative objects before the Renwick Gates, using his garage-shop. But after the gates were finished for the Renwick, Paley was left with a much larger work-space, in addition to a full-time assistant, supplies, and machinery. Paley already had another museum commission from the [[Hunter Museum of American Art]] in [[Tennessee]] for an 85-foot long ornamental [http://emuseum.huntermuseum.org/eMuseum/view/objects/asitem/26/78/people-asc?t:state:flow=f1239fdc-9b40-443b-92a9-57605b1bd05a fence].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Hasden |first = Wes |title = Hunter Museum gets Wrought Iron Fence Sculpture |newspaper = The Chattanooga Times |date= August 29, 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Paley has done many private commissions for driveway, garden, and fence gates in addition to his numerous public commissions. Some of his gates to note are the Portal Gates for the [[New York State Senate]] Chamber of the State Capitol (1980); the Victoria and Albert Gates for the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]][http://www.vam.ac.uk/](1982); and the Animals Always Gateway Sculpture for the [[St. Louis Zoo]] (2006), currently the largest sculpture at any zoo in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Animals Always Sculpture |url= https://www.stlzoo.org/about/featurednews/animalsalwayssculpture/ |website= Saint Louis Zoo |publisher= Saint Louis Zoo |accessdate= 7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= portals&gt;{{cite book| last = Rowe |first= M. Jessica |title= Albert Paley: Portals &amp; Gates |year= 2007 |publisher= University Museums, Iowa State University |isbn= 978-0-9798111-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Large-Scale Sculpture ===
Paley’s first major public sculpture was his Sculpture for the [[Strong Museum]] in 1982. It was his first piece that showed a transition from smaller-scale work to his monumental sizes. Paley did several other large-scale sculptures in the 80’s which share similarities in their simplicity of form with basic elements. Over time, his sculptures have moved away from simple forms, increasing in both complexity and color. In the summer of 2013, Paley was the featured artist on [[Park Avenue]].&lt;ref name = parkave&gt;{{cite book| last= Sims |first= Patterson |title= Albert Paley on Park Avenue |year= 2013 |publisher= Silvana Editoriale, Italy |isbn= 8836627196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirteen sculptures were installed for exhibition between 52nd and 67th Streets in [[New York City]]. This collection of sculptures was one of Paley’s larger projects for one exhibition.&lt;ref name= artdaily&gt;{{cite web |title= Summer Exhibition on Park Avenue Features 13 New Steel Sculptures by Albert Paley |url= http://artdaily.com/news/63569/Summer-exhibition-on-Park-Avenue-features-13-new-steel-sculptures-by-Albert-Paley |website= Art Daily |publisher= Art Daily |accessdate= 7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Craft in America]] featured Paley as the [http://interactive.wxxi.org/paleynyc final Forge artist in Season 5], aired on [[PBS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Paley on Park Avenue: New York City |url= http://interactive.wxxi.org/paleynyc |website= WXXI |publisher= WXXI Public Broadcasting Council |accessdate= 7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paley's career move from Goldsmith to Metal Sculptor is well explained in an interesting interview by Cathleen McCarthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thejewelryloupe.com/albert-paley-bodily-ornamentation/ |title=Albert Paley: Bodily Ornamentation |last=McCarthy |first=Cathleen|date=2010-07-22|website=The Jewelry Loupe|accessdate=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Glass &amp; Steel ===
In 1998, Paley was invited to the [[Pilchuck Glass School]][http://www.pilchuck.com/] for a summer residency. While there, Paley created a mass of glass elements that would be used in later sculptures in [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]]. Paley did another glass residency in 2014 with the [[Corning Museum of Glass]][http://www.cmog.org/] located in [[Corning, New York]]. He worked there for a year, where he practiced furnace-working and cast Corning Code 7056, a specific type of [[glass]] that can form bonds with a metal alloy called [[Kovar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last= Hopman |first= Rebecca |year= 2015 |title= A New Endeavor: The Corning Museum of Glass/Corning Incorporated Specialty Glass Residency |url= http://rebeccahopman.com/index/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/GAS-Sum15.pdf |magazine= GASNEWS |publisher= Corning Museum of Glass |volume= 26 |issue= 2 |pages= 12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paley chose this specific glass blend because of its similar properties to that of Kovar, which allowed him to create pieces that fused the glass and metal with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Biography: Albert Paley |url= http://www.cmog.org/bio/albert-paley |website= Corning Museum of Glass |publisher= Corning Museum of Glass |accessdate= 7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last= Borgna | first= Stephen |title= Artist Q&amp;A: Albert Paley mixes metal, glass |url= http://www.the-leader.com/news/20160327/artist-qa-albert-paley-mixes-metal-glass |website= The Leader |publisher= The Leader |accessdate= 7 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first exhibition to focus on Paley’s combining of glass and steel, ''Complementary Contrasts: The Glass and Steel Sculptures of Albert Paley'' at Museum of Glass will take place during the 2017 - 2018 season, and will display a collection of pieces spanning Paley's work with glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title= Complementary Contrasts: The Glass and Steel Sculptures of Albert Paley |url= http://museumofglass.org/document.doc?id=405 |publisher= Museum of Glass, Tacoma, WA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3239">'''Andonios Liveralis''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Αντώνιος Λιβεράλης or Λιμπεράλης, Italian: ''Antonio Liberali''; 1814 in [[Corfu]] &amp;ndash; 1842 in Corfu) was a [[Greece|Greek]] conductor and composer of the early [[Ionian School (music)|Ionian school]]. He was the son of Italian conductor Domenico Liveralis and one of [[Nikolaos Mantzaros]]' favorite students.&lt;ref name=Miroshnikov&gt;{{cite book|last=Aleksei Miroshnikov|first=Natalia Miroshnikov|title=Light Under a Bushel, Piano works by greek composers 1847-1908|year=1999|publisher=Crete University Press|isbn=960-524-069-6|pages=7|url=http://www.greekfolkways.org/catalog/booklets/CUP11.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later continued his studies at the [[Music conservatories of Naples#Conservatorio di San Pietro a Majella|Conservatory of San Pietro a Majella]] in [[Naples]].&lt;ref name="Conferenza musicale mediterranea"&gt;{{cite book|last=Conferenza musicale mediterranea|title=MEMUS: mediterraneo musica : studi i documenti della Conferenza musicale mediterranea|year=1995|publisher=Regione Sicialiana|location=Palermo|pages=76|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=AIAaUO6xFc3MsgaLmoDgBA&amp;hl=cs&amp;id=0ulLAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=antonios+liveralis+San+Pietro+a+Majella&amp;q=liveralis|language=it|OCLC=44798758}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he returned to Corfu he was joyfully received into the circle of national composers, where he was considered a musician of great talent. He then began working as assistant to his teacher Mantzaros, who left him very little time for his own compositions. He was among the first teachers of his younger brother Iosif and served as vice director of music to the [[Philharmonic Society of Corfu]].&lt;ref name=Miroshnikov/&gt;

Liveralis' compositions are largely limited to minor forms. He wrote a series of fixed funeral marches, which were later published in two volumes. The march ''O Kambouris'' (Ο Καμπούρης, 'The Hunchback') achieved great popularity in Corfu. He also devoted himself to composing piano music and to the creation of a rich song repertoire. His one-act opera is the only sure finished work for the stage by the composer. He was born a Catholic, but was converted to [[Greek Orthodox]] faith and adopted the patriotic name of Eleftheriadis (Greek: Ελευθεριάδης). After his untimely death, he was buried in a magnificent funeral to which the orchestra of the [[Philharmonic Society of Corfu]] played.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9681">The '''Charles B. Rangel International Affairs Fellowship Program''' is a [[Scholarship|fellowship]] program that provides funding for [[graduate student]]s as they prepare academically and professionally to enter the [[United States Foreign Service]].

==History==
Launched to help promote greater diversity in the U.S. Foreign Service, the Rangel Fellowship Program was announced in 2002 by [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Colin Powell]], Congressman [[Charles B. Rangel]], and the President of [[Howard University]], [[H. Patrick Swygert]].&lt;ref name="About Us"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.rangelprogram.org/index.cfm?session.areaid=2&amp;contentid=701&amp;typeid=CBRIAP92223|publisher=[[Howard University]]|accessdate=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years of the program, the [[U.S. Congress]] provided an appropriation for the program, and its early operations were supported by the Department of State and contributions by the [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation]] and the [[Una Chapman Cox Foundation]].&lt;ref name="About Us"/&gt;

==Program components==
The program is managed by the [[Ralph J. Bunche International Affairs Center]] at Howard University and is funded by a grant from the [[U.S. Department of State]].

The Rangel Program offers thirty graduate fellowships annually to outstanding seniors and college graduates who want to join the U.S. Foreign Service.&lt;ref name="About Us"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Program"&gt;{{cite web|title=Graduate Fellowship Program - Program Elements|url=http://www.rangelprogram.org/index.cfm?areaid=2&amp;contentid=673&amp;mcontent=y&amp;typeid=CBRIAP92223|publisher=[[Howard University]]|accessdate=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fellowships help finance two-year graduate programs and provide two paid summer internship opportunities, one on [[Capitol Hill]] and the second at a [[List of diplomatic missions of the United States|U.S. embassy]].&lt;ref name="Program"/&gt;

Like the [[Thomas R. Pickering Fellowship|Thomas R. Pickering Fellowship Program]], the Rangel Fellowship Program guarantees a five-year contract in the Foreign Service to successful Fellows.&lt;ref name="Program"/&gt; Rangel Fellows also receive mentoring from [[Foreign Service Officers]] throughout the duration of the program.&lt;ref name="Program"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3191">'''Dave Godfrey''' (August 9, 1938 – June 21, 2015) was a Canadian writer and [[publisher]]. His novel ''The New Ancestors'' won the [[Governor General's Award for English language fiction]] in 1970.&lt;ref name=canenc&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/dave-godfrey "Dave Godfrey"]. ''[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]''. Published April 2, 2008; last edited December 15, 2013. Retrieved 2015-07-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Winnipeg]], Manitoba,&lt;ref name=canenc/&gt; Godfrey was educated at Trinity College at the [[University of Toronto]], [[Iowa State University]], and [[Stanford University]]. He taught in [[Ghana]] for several years including [[Adisadel College]], [[Cape Coast]] from 1963-65 where he was the English and music instructor. He was the founder of the Adisadel Jazz Club, which led to the creation of similar jazz and student pop groups in several Ghanaian secondary schools. He continued his teaching at the University of Toronto and the [[University of Victoria]].&lt;ref name=canenc/&gt;

Starting in the late 1970s, he became interested in the cultural side of computer technology, and argued that decentralized data and computer communication were extremely important for art and literature. In 1979 he edited a book on the subject with [[Douglas Parkhill]], ''Gutenberg two'', on the social and political meaning of computer technology, and he wrote ''The [[Telidon]] Book'' with Ernest Chang, about electronic publishing and video text, and founded a software development company called Softwords, working in that field.&lt;ref name=canenc/&gt; He also worked on [[computer aided learning]].

Godfrey was one of the founders of the [[House of Anansi]] and [[The New Press]] and was editor of [[Press Porcépic]].&lt;ref name=canenc/&gt; He later ran a 60-acre [[vineyard]] and farm in the [[Cowichan Valley]] of [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref name=qq/&gt; He died of cancer on June 21, 2015, at the age of 76.&lt;ref name=qq&gt;[http://www.quillandquire.com/authors/2015/06/24/dave-godfrey-governor-generals-literary-award-winner-and-co-founder-of-house-of-anansi-press-dies "Dave Godfrey, Governor General’s Literary Award winner and co-founder of House of Anansi Press, dies"].

The term [[dyslexia]] comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words 'dys' meaning 'impaired', and 'lexis' meaning 'word' and is used to describe disorders of language concerning reading and [[spelling]].

Numerous models and hypotheses have been proposed in attempt to explain the broad range of symptoms experienced by deep dyslexics, but a definite consensus has yet to be reached. The proposed models and hypotheses have helped in treatment of some suffering patients, but only with certain specific symptoms. Additionally, the recovery seen is not experienced equally in all patients.

Deep dyslexia is usually classified as an ''acquired reading disorder'', as opposed to a ''developmental dyslexia'', in previously literate adults as a consequence of a [[brain injury]].&lt;ref name= "Colangelo"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Colangelo|first=Annette|author2=Buchanan, Lori|title=Localizing damage in the functional architecture: The distinction between implicit and explicit processing in deep dyslexia|journal=Journal of Neurolinguistics|year=2007|volume=20|issue=2|pages=111–144|doi=10.1016/j.jneuroling.2006.08.001}}&lt;!--|accessdate=17 March 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Colangelokaren"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Colangelo|first=Annette|author2=Buchanan, Lori|title=Implicit and explicit processing in deep dyslexia: Semantic blocking as a test for failure of inhibition in the phonological output lexicon|journal=Brain and Language|year=2006|volume=99|issue=3|pages=258–271|doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2005.07.048}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Temple"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Temple|first=CM|title=Developmental and acquired dyslexias.|journal=Cortex|year=2006|volume=42|issue=6|pages=898–910|pmid=17131596|doi=10.1016/S0010-9452(08)70434-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Coslett"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coslett|first=HB|title=Acquired dyslexia.|journal=Seminars in neurology|year=2000|volume=20|issue=4|pages=419–26|pmid=11149697|doi=10.1055/s-2000-13174}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, recently, developmental deep dyslexia has also been reported in children with [[Williams syndrome]].&lt;ref name= "Temple" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnston|first=RS|title=Developmental deep dyslexia?|journal=Cortex|year=1983|volume=19|issue=1|pages=133–9|pmid=6851588|doi=10.1016/s0010-9452(83)80057-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deep dyslexia is considered to be a "[[central dyslexia]]" as compared to a "[[peripheral dyslexia]]". Peripheral dyslexics have difficulty matching the visual characteristics of letters that comprise a word to a stored memory of this word from prior encounters.&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt; Central dyslexics are unable to properly match the visual word to the word's meaning.&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt; They may also be incapable of speaking, or [[Phonation|phonating]], the sequence of written letters that they see into the word these letters represent.&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt; Deep dyslexia differs from other forms of central dyslexia ([[phonological dyslexia]] and [[surface dyslexia]]) in that deep dyslexics have many more symptoms and these symptoms are generally more severe.&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Rapcsak"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rapcsak|first=Steven Z.|author2=Beeson, Pélagie M. |author3=Henry, Maya L. |author4=Leyden, Anne |author5=Kim, Esther |author6=Rising, Kindle |author7=Andersen, Sarah |author8= Cho, HyeSuk |title=Phonological dyslexia and dysgraphia: Cognitive mechanisms and neural substrates|journal=Cortex|year=2009|volume=45|issue=5|pages=575–591|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2008.04.006 |pmid=18625494 |pmc=2689874}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Orden"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Orden|first=G|title=What do double dissociations prove?|journal=Cognitive Science|year=2001|volume=25|issue=1|pages=111–172|doi=10.1016/S0364-0213(00)00036-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the "continuum" hypothesis, deep dyslexia is a more severe form of phonological dyslexia.&lt;ref name= "Rapcsak" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Orden" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Lambon"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lambon Ralph|first=Matthew A.|author2=Graham, Naida L.|title=Acquired phonological and deep dyslexia|journal=Neurocase|year=2000|volume=6|issue=2|pages=141–178|doi=10.1080/13554790008402767}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==

Deep dyslexia is mainly characterized by the occurrence of [[Semantics|semantic]] reading errors or semantic [[paralexias]] (transposition of letters or words) when reading aloud (e.g. the written word "view" is read aloud as "scene", the word "bird" is read as "canary").&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Plaut"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plaut|first=David C.|author2=Shallice, Tim|title=Deep dyslexia: A case study of connectionist neuropsychology|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychology|year=1993|volume=10|issue=5|pages=377–500|doi=10.1080/02643299308253469}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Weekes"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weekes|first=Brendan|author2=Coltheart, Max |author3=Gordon, Evian |title=Deep dyslexia and right hemisphere reading-a regional cerebral blood flow study|journal=Aphasiology|year=1997|volume=11|issue=12|pages=1139–1158|doi=10.1080/02687039708249437}}&lt;/ref&gt; These semantic errors are the major distinguishing feature of deep dyslexia in comparison to other central dyslexias.&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt; There are many other symptoms of deep dyslexia, including visual errors (e.g. the written word "thing" is read aloud as "think", the word "skate" is read as "scale") and derivational errors (e.g. the written word "alcohol" is read aloud as "alcoholic", the word "governor" is read as "government"), and poor reading of [[function word]]s.&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Plaut" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Weekes" /&gt; Additionally, deep dyslexics have more difficulty reading [[Abstract and concrete|abstract]] than [[Abstract and concrete|concrete]] and highly imaginable words, more difficulty reading [[adjective]]s, [[adverb]]s, and [[verb]]s than [[noun]]s, a complete inability to read [[Pseudoword|non-words]], and often impairments on tasks of verbal [[working memory]].&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Plaut" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Weekes" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Harley book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harley|first=Trevor|title=The psychology of language : from data to theory|year=2005|publisher=Psychology Press|location=Hove|isbn=978-0-86377-867-4|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kolb|first=Bryan|title=Fundamentals of human neuropsychology|year=2008|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|isbn=0-7167-9586-8|edition=6th|author2=Whishaw, Ian Q.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the symptoms of deep dyslexia listed above are different and independent impairments of reading, it is rare to find an individual who only displays some of the characteristics of it; indeed, most patients presenting with semantic paralexias, a hallmark symptom of the disorder, also demonstrate all of the other symptoms.&lt;ref name= "Weekes" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Coltheartmax"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coltheart|first=Edited by Max|title=*Deep dyslexia.|year=1980|publisher=Routhledge &amp; Kegan Paul|location=London|isbn=0-7100-0456-7|edition=[1st publ.].|author2=Patterson, Karalyn |author3=Marshall, John C. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has resulted in deep dyslexia being considered a symptom-complex and has led to much research into why this variety of symptoms may co-occur in so many patients.&lt;ref name= "Weekes" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Coltheartmax" /&gt;

===Imageability effect and ease of predication===

The difficulty of deep dyslexics in reading abstract words has been referred to as the "[[imageability]] effect".&lt;ref name= "Temple" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Jones"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=GV|title=Deep dyslexia, imageability, and ease of predication.|journal=Brain and Language|year=1985|volume=24|issue=1|pages=1–19|pmid=3971130|doi=10.1016/0093-934x(85)90094-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Riley"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riley|first=EA|author2=Thompson, CK|title=Semantic Typicality Effects in Acquired Dyslexia: Evidence for Semantic Impairment in Deep Dyslexia.|journal=Aphasiology|year=2010|volume=24|issue=6–8|pages=802–813|pmid=20657815|doi=10.1080/02687030903422486|pmc=2907924}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this idea, the ease with which a [[mental image]] can be created for a word is strongly related to the ease of reading the word.&lt;ref name= "Jones" /&gt; In an attempt to explain this relationship, researchers have developed a variable to link the mental imagery created by a word and the ease of reading it.&lt;ref name= "Jones" /&gt; This variable, [[ease of predication]], is a rating of how easy it is to come up with simple factual statements or attributes of a word.&lt;ref name= "Jones" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Harley2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harley|first=Trevor A.|title=Connectionist approaches to language disorders|journal=Aphasiology|year=1993|volume=7|issue=3|pages=221–249|doi=10.1080/02687039308249508}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when presented with the word "dog", an individual may come up with statements, or [[Predicate (grammar)|predicates]], such as "has four legs", "is an animal", or "barks and wags its tail". Words with higher ease of predication scores are more easily read aloud by deep dyslexics than words with lower ease of predicaton scores, yet there is no correlation between ease of predication and ease of reading seen in normal adult readers.&lt;ref name= "Jones" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Harley2" /&gt; Ease of predication may not explain specific symptoms of deep dyslexia, but rather indicates that deep dyslexics read using imagery, or a predicational route, rather than the more precise mechanisms used in normal reading.&lt;ref name= "Jones" /&gt;

==Mechanism==

There are many different, and often conflicting, hypotheses that attempt to explain the deficits associated with deep dyslexia.&lt;ref name= "Shallice"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shallice|first=Tim|title=From neuropsychology to mental structure|year=1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge [England]|isbn=0521308747|edition=Reprint.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theories have resulted in several models designed to conceptualize the symptom-complex found in deep dyslexics. These models are not ordered chronologically, but rather follow a general increasing trend of presence in the field of knowledge regarding deep dyslexics. Some models may be stronger than others, but that is not necessarily reflected here. Models and hypothesis toward the end of the list are more heavily debated and thus typically have a greater wealth of knowledge surrounding their topic.&lt;ref name = "Colangelo" /&gt;

===Continuum model===

The "Glosser and Friedman (continuum) model" is based upon the concept that deep dyslexia and phonological dyslexia are opposite endpoints on a "continuum" of reading disability.&lt;ref name= "Colangelo" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Friedman"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Friedman|first=Rhonda B.|title=Recovery from Deep Alexia to Phonological Alexia: Points on a Continuum|journal=Brain and Language|year=1996|volume=52|issue=1|pages=114–128|doi=10.1006/brln.1996.0006}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 March 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Deep dyslexia appears to be a more severe form of phonological dyslexia;&lt;ref name= "Rapcsak" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Orden" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Lambon" /&gt; however, symptoms in patients can change over time so that an initial diagnosis of deep dyslexia is later better described as strictly a phonological dyslexia.&lt;ref name= "Colangelo" /&gt; These observations suggest recovery is possible along the [[semantic pathway]].&lt;ref name= "Colangelo" /&gt;

Friedman justifies the continuum hypothesis with two sets of evidence. The first involves five patients who started with deep dyslexia, but whose disorders shifted to phonological dyslexia during recovery.  Semantic paralexias were the first symptom to diminish, either partially or totally, in each case and then other symptoms were resolved to varying degrees after that. However, nonword reading was always the last symptom to go and complete recovery was never reached by any patient.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crisp|first=J.|last2=Ralph|first2=M.A.|date=|year=2006|others=|title=Unlocking the Nature of the Phonological-Deep Dyslexia Continuum: The Keys to Reading Aloud Are in Phonology and Semantics|url=|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|volume=18|issue=3|pages=348–362|doi=10.1162/089892906775990543|pmid=16513001|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her second set of evidence in support of the continuum was found in her review of eleven patients with deep or phonological dyslexia in whom she found a predictable succession of symptoms.  She placed great emphasis on the order in which reading symptoms emerged (poor nonword reading first, then visual errors, then noun &gt; functor, then noun &gt; verb, concrete &gt; abstract, and finally, semantic errors) and suggested that the continuum hypothesis was supported by this pattern of symptoms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Connectionist model===

[[File:Connectionist model of deep dyslexia.png|thumb|right|300px|Deep dyslexics have sufficient activation of a written word's features; but, this activation decays quickly, leading to errors in speech output.]]
The "connectionist model" suggests that the phonological and semantic features of a word are [[Spreading activation|activated]], but this activation decays at a rate too quick for cognitive processing- thus, errors in speech output are produced as a result of this fading activation.&lt;ref name= "Colangelo" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Buchanan" /&gt; This hypothesis explains the broad symptom-complex of deep dyslexics without resorting to a multiple loci damage approach as seen in other models.&lt;ref name= "Colangelo" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Buchanan" /&gt; It eliminates the need to attribute a specific locus of damage to each symptom of deep dylsexia, and instead states that all symptoms are due to decay of a large activation area.&lt;ref name= "Colangelo" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Buchanan" /&gt;

=== Distributed attractor networks ===
Plaut and Shallice have hypothesized that units in the brain interact in such a way that semantic features form stable attractors in the space of all possible representations of words.  These unit interactions correspond to particular attractor patterns, and if the particular attractor pattern is activated, the network remains in that pattern.  However, they hypothesize that when the pattern is distorted, there is a pull on the pattern, and it gravitates toward the correct pattern, almost as if this semantic space is filled with basins, where if one point on the pattern falls to the edge of the basin, it will still gravitate toward the middle.  If you lesion this area, the neurons die and the basins change their shape.  When this happens, you may now have the same distorted starting pattern that will end up in a neighboring basin, which is a semantically related area, but not the correct one, and this would account for deep dyslexic patients to incorrectly identify "river" as "ocean".  Lesions that occur early in the network change the basins that send different semantic words to different areas of the network, whereas if they occur later, the words will be much closer semantically.  This may account for severity of the deficit in individual patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Plaut|first=D.C.|date=|year=1995|title=Double Dissociation Without Modularity: Evidence from Connectionist Neuropsychology|url=|journal=Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology|volume=17|issue=2|pages=291–321|doi=10.1080/01688639508405124|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Failure of inhibition hypothesis===

The "failure of inhibition hypothesis" states that the presentation of a target word activates [[semantic memory]] of that word, along with memory for other words that are semantically related.&lt;ref name= "Colangelokaren" /&gt; For example, the target word "dog" may activate "bark", "cat", "squirrel", "ball", "fetch". Deep dyslexic patients are unable to inhibit the other related words, so they are likely to substitute one of these words for the target word in speech production (explicit output).&lt;ref name= "Colangelokaren" /&gt; This hypothesis contradicts the belief of other researchers that the deficits seen in deep dyslexics are due to [[Mental process|processing]] problems.

Researchers believe that "failure of inhibition" has no effect on [[Implicit learning|implicit]] processing, but instead is the cause of impairments in the explicit task of speech production.&lt;ref name= "Colangelokaren" /&gt; They believe that explicit characteristics of reading involve only the conscious production of speech (reading).&lt;ref name= "Colangelokaren" /&gt; Information about written words is internalized without awareness (implicitly); the ability to access this information and process it into words that can be read or spoken is an explicit process.  Implicit knowledge involves [[phonological awareness]], understanding of the [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], and a semantic understanding of written words.&lt;ref name= "Colangelokaren" /&gt; This implicit aspect of reading may be completely intact, and yet reading errors can still occur through defects in explicit output, or production.&lt;ref name= "Colangelokaren" /&gt; Researchers have studied the dissociation of implicit and explicit processes to thus unravel the underlying deficiencies in deep dyslexia. Studies in support of "failure of inhibition" show intact implicit processing of deep dyslexics.&lt;ref name= "Colangelokaren" /&gt; For instance, studies have shown deep dyslexics that are equally fast in a [[lexical decision task]] with a rhyming pair of words (book-took) in comparison to a non-rhyming pair of words (bough-tough), indicating that the patients are able to use implicit phonological knowledge and [[phonics]] to process the words.&lt;ref name= "Colangelokaren" /&gt; Additionally, they are faster in a lexical decision task with words that sound like they are spelled (couch, pouch) than they are with words that do not sound like they are spelled (touch), again showing that patients are using phonology.&lt;ref name= "Colangelokaren" /&gt; These data show that implicit processing is in fact occurring in deep dyslexic patients. Thus, some researchers believe that the impairments present in deep dyslexics are only in explicit phonological output (i.e., reading aloud).&lt;ref name= "Colangelokaren" /&gt; They believe that the problems of deep dyslexics are due to production errors, and that deep dyslexics have normal phonological processing at the implicit level.&lt;ref name= "Colangelokaren" /&gt; This is supported by the fact that deep dyslexia is often present in patients suffering from production errors resulting from [[Expressive aphasia]].&lt;ref name= "Lambon" /&gt;

Riley and Thompson expanded on this theory in 2010.  Previous studies had shown that typical in patients with deep dyslexia, typical members of a semantic category (like "robin" in the category of "birds") are processed faster than atypical members of the same category (like "ostrich"), known as the semantic typicality effect.  According to their research, this typicality effect may indicate an inability to efficiently select a correct lexical-semantic representation.  They suggest that selection inhibition becomes impaired beginning at the level of semantics rather than the later levels of production like the original failure of inhibition hypothesis suggests.&lt;ref name="Riley" /&gt;

===Dual route model===

[[File:Dual route model and deep dyslexia diagram.svg|thumb|right|300px|Deep dyslexia can affect both pathways in the dual-route hypothesis of reading.]]
{{main article|Dual-route hypothesis to reading aloud}}
The "Morton and Patterson (dual route) model" is based upon the [[Dual-route hypothesis to reading aloud|dual route hypothesis of reading]]. It proposes that the occurrence of semantic errors alongside an inability to read non-words aloud must be due to multiple loci of damage within this dual-route model.&lt;ref name= "Colangelo" /&gt; Because a deep dyslexic cannot read aloud non-words, a disruption in the [[Phonology|phonological]] process is assumed, forcing reading to proceed through the semantic route.&lt;ref name= "Colangelo" /&gt; However, deep dyslexics also produce semantic errors while reading, alluding to damage in this pathway as well.&lt;ref name= "Colangelo" /&gt; Other researchers refer to the phonological and semantic route as "modules".&lt;ref name= "Colangelokaren" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Orden" /&gt; They believe that patients have a partially functioning [[Lexicon|lexical]] module and a completely deficient nonlexical module.&lt;ref name= "Orden" /&gt; The lexical module is analogous to the semantic route in the dual route model and relies on lexical memory, or the memory for words, to name words.&lt;ref name= "Colangelokaren" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Orden" /&gt; In using the lexical module, an individual accesses a "mental dictionary" of words. The nonlexical module is comparable to the phonological route and uses knowledge of spelling and [[grapheme]]s to create [[phoneme]]s to name words and nonwords.&lt;ref name= "Orden" /&gt; The absent nonlexical module in deep dyslexics explains why patients cannot name nonwords.&lt;ref name= "Orden" /&gt;

===Right and left hemisphere hypotheses===
[[File:HearReadBrain.png|thumb|Activation areas in the left hemisphere when hearing or reading a word. The "left-hemisphere hypothesis", supports the idea of a damaged left hemisphere-based reading system.]]

Normal reading is typically a function of a left [[Lateralization of brain function|hemisphere-based system]].&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt; The right [[Cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]] plays a minimal role in reading.&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Shallice" /&gt; One hypothesis, the "left hemisphere hypothesis", supports the idea of a damaged left hemisphere-based reading system associated with deep dyslexia.&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Coltheart"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coltheart|first=Max|title=Deep Dyslexia Is Right-Hemisphere Reading|journal=Brain and Language|year=2000|volume=71|issue=2|pages=299–309|doi=10.1006/brln.1999.2183}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Salmelin"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salmelin|first=R|author2=Helenius, P |author3=Service, E |title=Neurophysiology of fluent and impaired reading: a magnetoencephalographic approach.|journal=Journal of Clinical Neurophysiology|year=2000|volume=17|issue=2|pages=163–74|pmid=10831107|doi=10.1097/00004691-200003000-00005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deep dyslexics may be attempting to use this damaged left hemisphere, resulting in severe reading deficits.&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Coltheart" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Salmelin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warrington|first=Rosaleen A. McCarthy, Elizabeth K.|title=Cognitive neuropsychology : a clinical introduction|year=1990|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego|isbn=0124818463|edition=[7. Nachdr.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, the "right hemisphere hypothesis" states that deep dyslexics attempt to read using a completely different reading system.&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Shallice" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Coltheart" /&gt; According to this hypothesis, they are using the right hemisphere for [[Orthography|orthographic]] and semantic processing, but given that this system does not usually play a role in reading, deep dyslexics have many reading disabilities.&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Coltheart" /&gt; Strong support for this hypothesis comes from studies of [[split-brain]] patients who use the right hemisphere for reading. These patients makes semantic errors similar to those seen with deep dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shallice|first=Tim|title=From neuropsychology to mental structure|year=1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page= 112|location=Cambridge [England]|isbn=0521308747|edition=Reprint.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous studies have shown that the right hemisphere ''can'' contribute to reading when a patient's left hemisphere is damaged.&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Shallice" /&gt; Brain imaging studies, performed both on deep dyslexics and in other patients with left hemisphere injury, have shown that the damaged left hemisphere is still playing a role in reading.&lt;ref name= "Coltheart" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Salmelin" /&gt; However, the imaging has also shown that areas of the right hemisphere are also active during reading.&lt;ref name= "Coltheart" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Salmelin" /&gt; Thus, it currently appears that there is greater support in favor of the right-hemisphere hypothesis.&lt;ref name = "Coltheart" /&gt;

==Treatment==
There have been many different studies done in an attempt to treat deep dyslexics, all which have been met with varying success. One method that has been frequently used is to teach patients to sound out words using grapheme-to-phoneme correspondence rules (for example, using single letter graphemes such as the letter 'B" to link with larger words such as "Baby", allowing for association of phonemes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Friedman|first=Rhonda B.|author2=Lott, Susan Nitzberg|title=Successful blending in a phonological reading treatment for deep alexia|journal=Aphasiology|year=2002|volume=16|issue=3|pages=355–372|doi=10.1080/02687040143000627}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such methods are known as "non-lexically based reading treatments". Other studies have looked at attempting to repair the semantic-lexical route, known as "lexically based treatment".&lt;ref name= "Rilling"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stadie|first=Nicole|author2=Rilling, Eva|title=Evaluation of lexically and nonlexically based reading treatment in a deep dyslexic|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychology|year=2006|volume=23|issue=4|pages=643–672|doi=10.1080/02643290500538364}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 March 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the methodology, treatment studies with deep dyslexics are difficult because much of the information regarding this disability is still heavily debated.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Treatment options may be successful on repairing one route of reading but not another, and success for one patient may not translate to success in another.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

'''''Educating the Disfranchised and Disinherited''''' is a 1999 biography of American General [[Samuel Chapman Armstrong]] and his associated [[normal school]] for [[freedmen]], [[Hampton Institute]], written by Robert Francis Engs and published by the [[University of Tennessee Press]]. The first full biography of its kind, the book portrays Armstrong as a complex politician and administrator in the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|postbellum]] period who balanced the needs of opposed parties surrounding the [[Virginia]] school: its African American students, Southern white neighbors, and Northern philanthropist funders. Previous works presented Armstrong in a polarized fashion, as either a savior or handicap for freedmen. The book emphasizes Armstrong's upbringing as a [[missionary]] in [[Hawaii]] in the development of his educational philosophy.

Reviewers complimented the book's balanced presentation of Armstrong, grounded use of the period's thought, and contribution to the historiography of [[industrial education]]. They felt the book lacked community and state historical context, as well as recent scholarship on [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] at Hampton.

Robert Francis Engs's ''Educating the Disfranchised and Disinherited: Samuel Chapman Armstrong and Hampton Institute, 1839–1893'' is the first biography of General [[Samuel Chapman Armstrong]],{{sfn|Wagoner|2001|p=109}}{{sfn|Ahern|2000|p=1045}} the founder of the [[Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute]]. The book was published by the [[University of Tennessee Press]] in 1999. It challenges several long-standing ideas about this period: that the "Hampton-Tuskegee system" and its adherents stunted the progress of African Americans, that the Hampton Institute ideology was opposed to that of [[historically black college|historically black]] and historically white colleges, and that the positions of [[W. E. B. DuBois]] and [[Booker T. Washington]] were diametrically opposed.{{sfn|Wagoner|2001|p=106}} Engs writes Armstrong as a symbol of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|postbellum]] America's conflicts over race, class, religion, and gender. Engs's Armstrong, in "paternal ... arrogance" believed that he and others of higher status could best determine how to improve the lots of those suppressed by "lack of opportunity and discrimination", such as [[African Americans]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]].{{sfn|Wagoner|2001|p=107}} This intuition, of knowing "what was best for the [[freedmen]]", was influenced by his experience in [[missionary]] work,{{sfn|Ahern|2000|p=1045}} where his parents treated the indigenous Hawaiians as misbehaving children with behavior to be corrected.{{sfn|Bair|2000|p=451}} The biography distills Armstrong's philosophy, demeanor, and understanding of African Americans from his experiences as a missionary, student of [[Williams College]], and leader in the [[American Civil War]]. Engs dismisses polarized interpretations of Armstrong's legacy as either a savior or a handicap for uneducated blacks.{{sfn|Medford|2000|p=384}} Instead, Armstrong is portrayed as a complex man who believes both in "black inferiority" and that freedmen could improve their lives through his lessons.{{sfn|Medford|2000|p=385}}

Armstrong was born and raised in Hawaii in the mid-1800s. [[Richard Armstrong (Hawaii)|His father]] was the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]]'s (secular) minister of public instruction, whose schools practiced the "[[manual labor]] principle of education".{{sfn|Wagoner|2001|p=107}} Engs wrote that Armstrong's Hawaiian childhood insulated him from racist sentiment on the mainland.{{sfn|Ahern|2000|p=1045}} Armstrong attended private schools in [[Oahu]] before moving to study on the mainland. He shied away from the ministry, believing as his father, "the shorter one's creed, the better".{{sfn|Wagoner|2001|p=107}} Armstrong's experience in the Civil War—including as a [[prisoner of war]], leader of the [[United States Colored Troops]], and General—led to his lifelong pursuit of "noble strife" in helping his "fellow man".{{sfn|Wagoner|2001|pp=107–108}} He joined the [[Freedmen's Bureau]]{{sfn|Wagoner|2001|p=108}} and served as the first principal of the Hampton Institute on the [[Virginia Peninsula]].{{sfn|Medford|2000|p=384}} Hampton's task was to prepare African Americans "to teach their people the 'civilizing' ways of white men" through "Christian teachings, a strict [[code of conduct]], and manual labor".{{sfn|Medford|2000|p=384}} Hampton was one of eight [[American Missionary Association]] [[normal school|teacher-training schools]]. Armstrong left a 25-year legacy, and introduced the school's manual and industrial teaching methods in the late 1860s despite its increased cost.{{sfn|Wagoner|2001|p=108}} Engs distinguishes this vision from the post-1900 [[industrial education]], with Armstrong's "industry" signifying the industriousness of "self-discipline and self-reliance".{{sfn|Wagoner|2001|p=108}} The labor proceeds also supported the black students through school, though only during school months.{{sfn|Wagoner|2001|p=108}} Armstrong sought to see his "best" graduates ascend to higher education and to occupations "originally envisioned for whites".{{sfn|Ahern|2000|p=1045}} As his "most famous student", "virtual son",{{sfn|Bair|2000|p=451}} and "spiritual heir", [[Booker T. Washington]] opened the [[Tuskegee Institute]] in the style of Hampton.{{sfn|Medford|2000|p=385}} Armstrong later expanded Hampton's scope to include Native Americans,{{sfn|Medford|2000|p=385}} who were kept apart from the blacks as a "school within a school".{{sfn|Bair|2000|p=451}}

Engs notes that missionaries&lt;!--' intent was primarily to CONVERT and secondarily to civilize, and that the post-Civil War missionaries--&gt; struggled to reconcile the task of assimilating discriminated peoples into a society that defined itself by that active discrimination.{{sfn|Wagoner|2001|p=109}} Engs portrays Armstrong as a natural politician, administrator, and "risk-taker"{{sfn|Medford|2000|p=385}} who sought broad-based support from opposed parties, including African Americans, the "anti-Negro white South", and white philanthropists of the North, which made Armstrong into a "master prevaricator".{{sfn|Ahern|2000|p=1045}} As a "realist", Armstrong adopted the subtleties of his patrons to keep Hampton open, and did not confuse "the uplift of African Americans" with "promoting their equality with whites".{{sfn|Bair|2000|p=451}} Hampton's curriculum was ultimately set by federal and donor money.{{sfn|Bair|2000|p=451}} In time, Armstrong's goals for the school were derailed by increased costs and the school's Northern industrialist backers, who made manual labor education the focus and end of the curriculum, rather than a means.{{sfn|Ahern|2000|p=1045}} Engs concludes that Armstrong's black graduates lived in better circumstances than their peers.{{sfn|Ahern|2000|p=1046}} Many became teachers in the South and were "grateful" for their opportunities.{{sfn|Bair|2000|p=451}} Reversely, Hampton's Native American graduates suffered in health at the school and had little job opportunity back out West.{{sfn|Bair|2000|p=451}} Engs also concluded that Armstrong's work was limited by his reliance on the elite, emphasis on white men deciding black lives, and inability to change his philosophy when his assumptions became outdated.{{sfn|Medford|2000|p=385}} Still, Engs thought that Armstrong succeeded in his intent to "civilize" students at Hampton, though this mattered little, Engs wrote, when white society was unprepared to accept them "no matter how civilized they might be".{{sfn|Bair|2000|p=452}}

== Reception ==

Wilbert Ahern (''[[Journal of American History]]'') found the book's arguments convincing and "gracefully written", but wanted to know more about Armstrong's background in financial administration, forming of ties with the Northern philanthropists, and successful students apart from Booker T. Washington.{{sfn|Ahern|2000|p=1046}} Jennings Wagoner (''[[History of Education Quarterly]]'') noted that Armstrong's intentions were portrayed as comparable to the leaders of George Fredrickson's ''Inner Civil War'', who saw their work as an extension of that of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]].{{sfn|Wagoner|2001|p=107}} Wagoner wrote that Engs provided a "well-grounded" biography that handles Armstrong's "complexities and contradictions" with skillful use of the historiography and understanding of the era.{{sfn|Wagoner|2001|p=109}} Ahern emphasized the biography's "balance" in contrast to prior partisan writing on Armstrong. He noted Donald Spivey's ''Schooling for the New Slavery'' and Engs's first book, the 1979 ''Freedmen's First Generation'', as examples of work that associates Armstrong with "stifling ... African-American aspirations".{{sfn|Ahern|2000|p=1045}} Ahern also wrote that Engs's work affirms the then-controversial claim in [[James M. McPherson|James McPherson]]'s 1975 ''The Abolitionist Legacy'' that Armstrong was "fundamentally dedicated to the advancement of opportunity for African Americans" and other races.{{sfn|Ahern|2000|p=1045}} Edna Green Medford (''The North Carolina Historical Review'') wrote that the book was particularly valuable to the historiography of industrial education.{{sfn|Medford|2000|p=385}}

Medford praised Engs's contextualization of the late-nineteenth century in American political, racial, and educational thought, but criticized his treatment of the relationship between the school and its community, particularly in stories of its students interacting with the community.{{sfn|Medford|2000|p=385}} Ahern felt that Engs missed relevant, recent literature on Armstrong's impact on Native Americans.{{sfn|Ahern|2000|p=1046}} Harold Forsythe (''[[The Journal of Southern History]]'') described Engs's tone as mild, but with a "continuous ... critical bite".{{sfn|Forsythe|2002|p=985}} Forsythe also marked the book's reliance on Armstrong's and Hampton records and consequent distance from the larger history of Virginia.{{sfn|Forsythe|2002|p=985}}

Foreign language anxiety, however, is situation-specific and so it can also affect individuals who are not characteristically anxious in other situations.

==Causes==
{{expert needed|the subject, as much of the article is largely incoherent|date=July 2017}}
Although all aspects of using and learning a foreign language can cause anxiety, both listening and speaking are regularly cited as the most anxiety provoking of foreign language activities.&lt;ref name="MacIntyre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Horwitz"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Horwirz |first=E. K. |last2=Horwitz |first2=M. B. |last3=Cope |first3=J. |year=1986 |title=Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety |journal=The Modern Language Journal |volume=70 |issue=ii |pages= |ref=harv |doi=10.2307/327317}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign language anxiety is usually studied and seen in a language classroom situation. It has been argued that language learning is a "profoundly unsettling psychological proposition"&lt;ref name="Horwitz 125–132"/&gt; as it jeopardizes an individual's self-understanding and perspective.&lt;ref name="Horwitz 125–132"/&gt; Three theories of anxiety have been developed from internal appraisal, then more situational in learning language and contextual situation{{clarify|date=July 2017}}:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* self-efficacy and appraisal anxiety
* state, trait, situational anxiety
* situational anxiety in a classroom situation
Potential negative events that people cannot see or handle with their ability{{clarify|date=July 2017}} often leads to anxiety. Also, if individuals are highly anxious, that kind of habitualised reactions{{clarify|date=July 2017}} may cause those who have experienced many threatening situations in the past to be more likely perceive future situations as threatening. As well, if their anxiety are traits rather than states, self-efficacy must result from past successes, vicarious experiences and social persuasion.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pappamihiel|first1=N. Eleni|title=English as a Second Language Students and English Language Anxiety: Issues in the Mainstream Classroom|journal=Research in the Teaching of English|date=1 January 2002|volume=36|issue=3|pages=327–355|jstor=40171530}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Self-efficacy'' is one's own confidence that he or she would be able to handle to achieve intended goals. ''State, trait, situational anxiety'' refers to those who have gotten traumatised a lot in the past being more likely to perceive the future situations as treating too. Also, specifically in an ESL classroom, students learning a foreign language out of their country are very vulnerable to high levels of anxiety about language learning, which leads them to being less likely to get encouraged by others because of lacking vicarious experience and social persuasions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

More specifically, foreign language anxiety is seen in a language classroom. As such, the causes of foreign language anxiety have been broadly separated into three main components: [[communication apprehension]], [[test anxiety]] and [[fear of negative evaluation]].&lt;ref name="Horwitz" /&gt; Communication apprehension is the anxiety experienced in speaking or listening to other individuals. Test-anxiety is a form of [[performance anxiety]] associated with the fear of doing badly or failing altogether. Fear of negative evaluation is the anxiety associated with the learner's perception of how other onlookers (instructors, classmates or others) may negatively view their language ability.

Sparks and Ganschow&lt;ref name="SparksGanschow1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sparks|first1=Richard L.|last2=Ganschow|first2=Leonore|title=Foreign Language Learning Differences: Affective or Native Language Aptitude Differences?|journal=The Modern Language Journal|volume=75|issue=1|year=1991|pages=3–16|issn=0026-7902|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4781.1991.tb01076.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; asked a question, which drew attention to the fact that anxiety could be a cause of poor language learning or a result of poor language learning. If a student is unable to study as required before writing a language examination, the student could experience test anxiety. Context anxiety could be viewed as a result. In contrast, anxiety becomes a cause of poor language learning when it was due to anxiety that student is unable to adequately learn the target language.

There can be various physical causes of anxiety, such as hormone levels, but the underlying causes of excessive anxiety while learning are fear&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shahsavari|first1=Mahmood|title=Relationship between anxiety and achievement motivation among male and female students|journal=Journal of American Science|date=2012|volume=8|issue=11|pages=329–332|url=http://www.jofamericanscience.org/journals/am-sci/am0811/048_11656am0811_329_332.pdf|accessdate=23 January 2017|publisher=AmericanScience.org / Marsland Press|issn=2375-7264&lt;!-- print: 1545-1003 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a lack of confidence. Lack of confidence itself can come from various causes. One reason can be the teaching approach&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Riasati|first1=Mohammad Javad|title=Language Learning Anxiety from EFL Learners' Perspective|journal=Middle-East Journal of Scientific Research|date=2011|volume=7|issue=6|pages=907–914|url=http://idosi.org/mejsr/mejsr7(6)11/13.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826001617/http://idosi.org/mejsr/mejsr7(6)11/13.pdf|archive-date=26 August 2016|deadurl=no|accessdate=23 January 2017|publisher=IDOSI Publications|issn=1990-9233}}&lt;/ref&gt; used.

Furthermore, foreign language anxiety roots in three psychological challenges:
* performance difficulty
* threat
* identity conflict
Those psychological states thus have task-performance and identity dimensions. People tend to act or speak in a way that would be judged appropriate to the other people native to the foreign culture, but the behaviour that individuals are producing grapples with ingrained values and behaviours. Emotions by the psychological challenges has something to do with attempting to switch codes in an interactive encounter.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Molinsky|first1=Andrew|title=Cross-Cultural Code-Switching: The Psychological Challenges of Adapting Behavior in Foreign Cultural Interactions|journal=The Academy of Management Review|date=1 January 2007|volume=32|issue=2|pages=622–640|doi=10.2307/20159318|jstor=20159318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
The effects of foreign language anxiety are particularly evident in the foreign language classroom, and anxiety is a strong indicator of academic performance. Anxiety is found to have a detrimental effect on students' [[confidence]], [[self-esteem]] and level of participation.&lt;ref name="Horwitz" /&gt;

Anxious learners suffer detrimental effects during spontaneous speaking activities in performance, affective reactions and their overall attitudes towards learning their target second language&lt;ref name="Phillips"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Phillips |first=E. M. |year=1992 |title=The effects of language anxiety on students' oral test performance and attitudes |journal=The Modern Language Journal |volume=76 |issue= 1|pages=14-26 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-4781.1992.tb02573.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Furthermore, they may lack confidence, be less able to self-edit and identify language errors and more likely to employ [[avoidance coping|avoidance]] strategies such as skipping class.&lt;ref name="Gregerson"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gregerson |first=T. |year=2003 |title=To err is human: A reminder to teachers of language-anxious students |journal=Foreign Language Annals |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=25–32 |doi= 10.1111/j.1944-9720.2003.tb01929.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anxious students also forget previously learned material, volunteer answers less frequently and tend to be more passive in classroom activities than their less anxious counterparts.&lt;ref name="Horwitz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ely"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ely |first=C. M. |year=1986 |title=An analysis of discomfort, risk-taking, sociability, and motivation in the L2 classroom |journal=Language Learning |volume=36 |issue= |pages=1–25 |doi= 10.1111/j.1467-1770.1986.tb00366.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of foreign language anxiety also extend outside the second language classroom. A high level of foreign language anxiety may also correspond with communication apprehension, causing individuals to be quieter and less willing to communicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Liu |first=M. |last2=Jackson |first2=J. |year=2008 |title=An exploration of Chinese EFL learners’ Unwillingness to Communicate and Foreign Language Anxiety |journal=The Modern Language Journal |volume=92 |issue=i |pages=71–86 |doi= 10.1111/j.1540-4781.2008.00687.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who exhibit this kind of communication [[reticence]] can also sometimes be perceived as less trustworthy, less competent, less socially and physically attractive, tenser, less composed and less dominant than their less reticent counterparts.

=== Cross-cultural code-switching ===
The effects of these negative emotions may also lead to '''cross-cultural code-switching''', in which bilingual people alter a language to their other language{{clarify|date=July 2017}} through their interactions with other bilinguals. Unlike linguistic [[code-switching]], cross-cultural code-switching is the socio-linguistic phenomenon of changing culturally-ingrained behaviors in a foreign situation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although cross-cultural code-switching possibly results from both positive and negative emotions, negative emotions are more common and more likely to affect the way a bilingual person speaks. Negative emotions include embarrassment, performance anxiety, guilt, distress and anxiety.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Molinsky|first=Andrew|date=2007-01-01|title=Cross-Cultural Code-Switching: The Psychological Challenges of Adapting Behavior in Foreign Cultural Interactions|jstor=20159318|journal=The Academy of Management Review|volume=32|issue=2|pages=622–640|doi=10.2307/20159318}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Molinsky identifies three psychological states that appraise under the influence of emotions while code-switching. These are: "experienced performance difficulty, face threat and identity conflict—all of which mediate the relationship between personal and contextual variables and the negative and positive emotions an individual experiences while code-switching".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.diplom.de/document/228636|title=Diplom.de - Cross-cultural Code Switching and Application|website=www.diplom.de|language=de|access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three types of cross-cultural code-switching:&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Titone|first=Renzo|date=1994-01-01|title=Some Italian Investigations of 'Code Switching' in Diglossic Settings: A Summary Report|jstor=30249052|journal=La Linguistique|volume=30|issue=2|pages=67–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* situational code-switching
* conversational code-switching
* borrowing
This code-switching could be considered as an unconscious behavior because of its negative and usually threatening situations.{{clarify|date=July 2017}} In that sense, although code-switching results from foreign language anxiety, it is more often caused by external circumstances than by internal mental change.{{clarify|date=July 2017}}&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Measures==
A number of tools have been developed to investigate the level of foreign language anxiety experienced by language learners.

The Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale (FLCAS)&lt;ref name="Horwitz" /&gt; is a 33-question, 5-point [[Likert scale]] survey, which is widely used in research studies. It investigates participants' communication apprehension, test-anxiety and fear of negative evaluation and focuses on speaking in a classroom context. It has been translated and used in several languages, including [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]].

Following the success of the Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety scale, similar instruments have been devised for measuring Foreign Language Reading Anxiety (FLRAS),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Saito |first=Y. |last2=Horwitz |first2=E. K. |last3=Garza |first3=T. J. |year=1999 |title=Foreign Language Reading Anxiety |journal=The Modern Language Journal |volume=83 |issue= |pages=202–218 |doi= 10.1111/0026-7902.00016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign Language Listening Anxiety (FLLAS) and Second Language Writing Apprehension (SLWAT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cheng |first=Y. S. |last2=Horwitz |first2=E. K. |last3=Shallert |first3=D.

== Issues and area of research ==
In the 1990s, the challenge was a clear categorisation of grammatical or sociolinguistic constraints on code-switching caused by foreign language anxiety and to determine how bilinguals produce different code-mixed patterns. In fact, previously, most researches focused more upon syntactic aspects on code-switching; in other words, psychological elements were completely ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Myers-Scotton|first1=Carol|title=Common and Uncommon Ground: Social and Structural Factors in Codeswitching|journal=Language in Society|date=1 January 1993|volume=22|issue=4|pages=475–503|jstor=4168471|doi=10.1017/s0047404500017449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] it is sometimes referred to as ''First Year Fatties'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cara |url=http://mhsbroadcaster.org/dj/health13/?p=227 |title=First Year Fatties &amp;#124; Health and Fitness |publisher=Mhsbroadcaster.org |date=2013-05-10 |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fresher Spread'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lissa Christopher |url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/diet-and-fitness/the-brain-food-binge-20110401-1cnoy.html |title=University life can make you fat |publisher=Smh.com.au |date= |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Fresher Five'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Nick|last1=|title=The Fresher Five|url=http://www.critic.co.nz/columns/article/2719/hi-dr-nick--issue-05|website=Critic - Te Arohi|publisher=Otago University Students' Association|accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hercus|first1=Josh|title=Fresher FAQ|url=http://www.critic.co.nz/features/article/663/fresher-faq|website=Critic - Te Arohi|accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter referring to a five-kilogram gain.

The purported causes of this weight gain are increased alcohol intake and the consumption of fat and carbohydrate-rich [[cafeteria]]-style food in university dormitories and [[fast food]] in nearby restaurants. Many other causes include [[malnutrition]], [[Stress (biology)|stress]], and decreased levels of [[exercise]]. All of these factors can affect each person in a different way.  Studies confirm many of these causes. Colleges and universities have recently been cracking down on this common problem and are trying to educate people on how to prevent it. This problem has grown so much that students are focusing on how to stop the freshman 15 before it happens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Freshman 15 College Weight Gain.

Despite how commonly the Freshman 15 is asserted, an Ohio State University study showed that the average college student gains only two to three pounds in their first year. Additionally, it showed that college students did not gain any more weight than non-college students of the same age, and that the only factor that increased weight gain was heavy drinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title="Freshman 15" weight gain is a myth: study |author=Kim Palmer |work=[[Reuters]] |date=November 1, 2011 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/01/us-college-weight-idUSTRE7A055O20111101 |accessdate=November 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Over-eating==

===College meal plans===
College meal plans are designed to give students a narrow variety of options. The most extravagant meal plans include a set amount of meals per day, so many per week, or so many per semester. In addition, plans may include little money that can be spent on snacks or other meals. Students can eat several meals a day or less than three meals a day. The meal plan was designed to benefit the student but it can be abused.&lt;ref name=Levitsky&gt;D A Levitsky, C A Halbmaier, &amp; G Mrdjenovic. (2004).

===Dining halls===
[[File:Dartmouth College campus 2007-06-23 Thayer Dining Hall 02.JPG|left|thumb|Thayer Dining Hall at Dartmouth College]]
The dining halls at colleges try to make dining at school convenient and comfortable. Dining halls can provide a wide variety and bountiful options of food. They can also provide a place where students can endlessly indulge in high calorie foods such as [[pizza]], [[fried food]], and [[ice cream]]. When exposed to these gourmet restaurants, students are generally more likely to choose them over healthier options, which leads to weight gain, especially if [[fast food]] restaurants are more prevalent on campus than other restaurants.&lt;ref name=Goodwin&gt;Goodwin, Stephanie K., Kathy W. Hosig, Elena L. Serrano, Kerry J. Redican, Wen You, and Aaron D. Schroeder. Development of the University Health Index to Examine the Interface between Campus Environment and Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Weight in College Students. University of Arizona Ebook. Page 23. 2 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; A study done on 60 students at [[Cornell University]] showed that 20% of the weight gained by the test subjects was directly caused by the dining halls' all-you-can-eat nature.&lt;ref name=Levitsky/&gt;

====Eating habits====
[[File:CTU Cafeteria.jpg|thumb|Dining halls are often arranged in buffet style.]]
College dining halls appeal to some students and repulse others, and this is especially problematic in the first year. A study published in the ''Journal of Adolescent Health'' determined that “regular family meals provide an opportunity for the role modeling of healthy eating patterns and social interactions among family members, and may thus help to reinforce healthy eating patterns and prevent disordered eating behaviors.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6T80-4DK5DTX-2&amp;_user=557737&amp;_coverDate=11%2F30%2F2004&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000028438&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=557737&amp;md5=3a18d945bafae93d23401e1b4f4d2f2a |title=Gumberg Library Home Page - Duquesne University  |accessdate=2014-03-07 |doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2004.01.004 |pmid=15488428  |volume=35 |issue=5  |journal=Journal of Adolescent Health |pages=350–359|year=2004  |last1=Neumark-Sztainer  |first1=Dianne  |last2=Wall  |first2=Melanie  |last3=Story  |first3=Mary  |last4=Fulkerson  |first4=Jayne A  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, parents determine when, where, what and how their children eat. Away from home, often for the first time, students have no parental monitoring of their eating habits and have to (re)discover what good eating patterns are.

In parental-supervised eating, teenagers typically ingest the proper amount of calories. The average 18-year-old-male is {{convert|68|to|70|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} tall and weighs between {{convert|160|and|170|lb|abbr=on}}. The average 18-year-old-female is {{convert|64|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} tall and weighs between {{convert|125|and|130|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schwanke |first=Crystal |url=http://teens.lovetoknow.com/Average_Height_and_Weight_for_Teenager |title=Average Height and Weight for a Teenager |publisher=Teens.lovetoknow.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[calorie counter]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bcm.edu/cnrc/caloriesneed.htm ]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116152958/http://www.bcm.edu/cnrc/caloriesneed.htm |date=January 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; used at the [[Baylor College of Medicine]], an average 18-year-old-male who is rarely active needs to consume approximately 2676 calories per day to maintain his weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bcm.edu/cnrc/caloriesneed.htm |title=Adult Energy Needs and BMI Calculator |publisher=Baylor College of Medicine |accessdate={{date|2010-04-15}} |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116152958/http://www.bcm.edu/cnrc/caloriesneed.htm |archivedate=2009-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, an average 18-year-old female who is rarely active needs to consume approximately 1940 calories per day to maintain her weight.

In parental-supervised diets, students also usually ingest the proper proportion of foods from the different dietary groups; once removed from the parental dinner table, many college students do not eat enough fruits, vegetables, and dairy products.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Lora Beth.  "College students can benefit by participating in a prepaid meal plan." ''Journal of the American Dietetic Association.'' Volume 105, Issue 3, March 2005, Pages 445&amp;ndash;448.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because when students go off to college, they face an independence that they usually have not experienced before. Many have to learn how to go out and feed themselves instead of having their parents cook for them.&lt;ref name="Goodwin p10"&gt;Goodwin, Stephanie K., Kathy W. Hosig, Elena L. Serrano, Kerry J. Redican, Wen You, and Aaron D. Schroeder. Development of the University Health Index to Examine the Interface between Campus Environment and Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Weight in College Students. University of Arizona Ebook. Page 10. 2 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that over 60 percent of college students commonly ingest sugary and fatty foods like chocolate and potato chips over fruits and vegetables.&lt;ref name=Ursell&gt;"Foods to power you through your finals; A university student asks our resident nutrition expert which foods to eat to aid brainpower during exam season." The Times. Lexis Nexis. Web. 7 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Presently, sugar accounts for approximately 20 percent of an American’s diet, which equates to about 90 pounds of sugar per person per year.&lt;ref name=Taubes&gt;Taubes, Gary. "Is Sugar Toxic?". The New York Times: 47. LexisNexis. Web. 17 Apr. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This explains why a study, conducted by Stephanie Goodwin of Virginia Polytechnic Institute, states that three out of four students don’t eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables daily, denying students key vitamins C and E, as well as fiber.

[[Malnutrition]] can be caused by a number of things including inadequate or unbalanced [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], problems with [[digestion]] or [[Absorption (small intestine)|absorption]], or certain medical conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000404.htm |title=Malnutrition: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia |publisher=Nlm.nih.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hunger]] is a main cause of malnutrition because if it is not satisfied then malnutrition is sure to follow.  People suffer from hunger because of a lack of food and the [[nutrients]] which accompany food in the short term. If hunger proceeds for an extended period of time there is a good chance that it will lead to malnutrition.
Malnutrition can affect people of every age. Though infants, children, and adolescents suffer more from malnutrition because of their need for critical nutrients for their normal development, older people may have problems because of aging or illness. People of college age have issues with malnutrition as well, though it may not be as severe as with the younger kids or the elderly.
In people in their undergraduate years of study at a four-year university, malnutrition can occur due to negligence of eating and even their diet.&lt;ref name="kidshealth1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kidshealth.org/parent/growth/feeding/hunger.html#a_Who_Is_at_Risk_for_Malnutrition_ |title=Hunger and Malnutrition |publisher=Kidshealth.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other causes===

Students often eat to deal with the pressures of stress. Stress may come from the pressures of unclear assignments, homework, and the transition from high school to college. The biggest stress factor for students is exams and doing well on them. Students entering college may be making independent decisions about their diet, activity, and television viewing behaviors for the first time. They also concluded that new environmental and social factors might emerge during this time period and have a greater influence on their behavior. When a student is stressed, the stress hormone cortisol is released, which causes some individuals to excessively eat.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kon.org/urc/v7/crooks.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Social pressures also play a factor with college student's eating habits. If an individual is trying to diet it becomes very difficult when they go out with friends to a restaurant or go eat at the dinning hall. One study (Pliner et al., 2007) found that social pressures have a powerful effect on how we eat. According to the researchers, individuals will often eat the same amount as those around them, especially when they are in a small group. This finding implies that when we eat, it is not as simple as eating until we feel full. Rather, we might under-eat or overeat depending on the company we are in. This suggests that we may eat similar types of food to those around us, making others’ unhealthy choices our own.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailytexanonline.com/opinion/2013/09/29/social-eating-poses-serious-problems-for-college-students&lt;/ref&gt; Also much of this comes from the transition from living at home, to living on their own, which results in students not knowing how to properly eat on their own. Students then tend to go eat with other students and choose poor eating decisions.

Most college students activity levels significantly decrease over the course of college. This results in weight gain because students do not workout as much and become lazier in everyday tasks. Transitioning into college is the first time when students actually have to learn how to maintain a healthy lifestyle and manage time in their schedules for physical activity.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.news-medical.net/news/20101111/Physical-activity-level-decreases-among-college-students.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

===College diet===
College students must deal with many different changes in living conditions when it comes to dining.

In addition, some college students consume a lot of [[alcoholic]] beverages. The vitamins and minerals consumed from alcohol and from food consumed with alcohol have a good chance of being unabsorbed.  People who drink large amounts of alcohol have a good chance of becoming [[malnourished]] or losing an unhealthy amount of weight because of the absorption blocking qualities of alcohol.&lt;ref name="kidshealth1"/&gt;

==Alcohol consumption==

===Nutrition===
The body has a certain number of [[calories]] that it needs to consume in order to maintain its weight.  This is determined through [[height]], [[weight]], [[ageing|age]], and several other factors, which differs from person to person.  When a person takes in more or fewer calories than that set limit, weight is either gained or lost.  Alcohol provides a large amount of calories in a small quantity of liquid, which tends to lead to unwanted extra calories.&lt;ref name="medicinenet3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/alcohol_and_nutrition/page3.htm |title=Alcohol and Nutrition: Health and Disease Prevention - Does alcohol impact your weight? |publisher=MedicineNet |date= |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vitamin B12.png|thumb|Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, shown here, is necessary to maintain human life.]]

When drinking alcohol on a regular basis, certain [[vitamin]] and [[mineral]] deficiencies can follow.  Examples of these deficiencies are as follows:

*'''Folate''': [[Folate]] helps to create and maintain new [[Cell (biology)|cells]].  Alcohol interferes with the [[intake]], absorption, [[transport]], storage, and release of [[folate]].
*'''Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;''': [[Vitamin B12|Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]] is required to make [[DNA]] and maintain healthy nerve and red blood cells.  Alcohol has been shown to decrease the levels of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;.
*'''Vitamin A''': [[Vitamin A]] is needed for [[visual system|vision]], regulation of the [[immune system]], [[bone]] growth, [[reproduction]], [[cell division]], and [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]].  Alcohol decreases the levels of this vitamin and increases [[toxicity]] when alcohol is consumed in large amounts.
*'''Calcium''': [[Calcium]] is needed for [[blood vessel]] and [[muscle]] movement, for the [[secretions]] of certain [[hormones]] and [[enzymes]], and for sending messages through the [[nervous system]].  Consumption of alcohol can cause a loss of calcium through urinary excretion.

These deficiencies can lead to weight issues caused by malnutrition.  When consuming alcohol, these vitamins and minerals must be replaced.  Often this is how certain cravings arise.&lt;ref name="medicinenet3"/&gt;

About 1 in 4 college students report academic consequences from drinking, including missing classes, falling behind, doing poorly on exams, and overall receiving lower grade.&lt;ref name="College Drinking"&gt;[https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/CollegeFactSheet/CollegeFactSheet.pdf "College Drinking"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Students who are involved in fraternities and sororities in college tend to have the highest alcohol consumption rates.&lt;ref name="College Drinking"/&gt;

When you consume alcohol, it turns into acetate. When acetate is present, the body will burn it up as calories before anything else. As a result, anything you ate prior to drinking your alcoholic beverage will be stored as fat. Alcohol also makes it harder for the body to burn fat that is already present by slowing down a process called "liquid oxidation." The more alcohol that a person consumes, the more food they are going to want to eat.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rightstep.com/alcoholism/alcohol-and-weight-gain/ "Where the problem reLLY Lies"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have found that those who consumed drinks of higher alcohol strength, ate significantly more than the others. Not only that, but they also chose to eat more fatty and salty foods. They also found that urges to snack were much higher among drinkers. Drinking alcohol also increases the body fat percentage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.weightlossresources.co.uk/body_weight/alcohol-effect.htm "How does alcohol consumption affect your weight and shape?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unhealthy foods with alcohol===
[[File:Fast food (282678968).jpg|thumb|left|Students often turn to greasy and fatty food while drinking alcohol.]]

According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism's research, people who tend to drink the largest amount of alcohol have the poorest eating habits compared to those who do not consume much alcohol at all. Those who do not drink a large quantity of alcohol seem to have the best quality diets. In this study researchers compared the [[Healthy eating pyramid|Healthy Eating]] scores of 3,000 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey with their overall consumption of alcohol. They used frequency, quantity, and average daily volume to measure the alcohol consumption.

The researchers found that as the alcohol quantity increased, the Health Index scores declined. As the frequency of alcohol consumed increased, the Healthy Eating scored declined. Diet quality was the poorest among those who consumed the largest quantity of alcohol. Care packages filled with unhealthy treats, sent usually by parents, was found to be the leading cause of weight gain. Those who drank less alcohol in an infrequent time frame had the best health index scores overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alcoholism.about.com/od/nutrition/a/blniaaa060217.htm |title=Unhealthy Drinking, Eating Habits Linked |publisher=Alcoholism.about.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stress and night eating==
It is not unusual for college students, especially freshmen, to experience abnormal levels of stress. This is more prevalent for freshmen because they are still transitioning from high school. College students can hold jobs while taking classes and may feel they have no time for studying, while freshmen might be stressed just trying to adjust to the college work load. There are hundreds of reasons for why college students get stressed, but, whatever the reason, it also can lead to weight gain. This is because when the body is stressed, it releases hormones such as [[adrenaline]] or more importantly [[cortisol]]. Cortisol has been tested to slow down the body's [[metabolism]]. Other studies have shown that when people are stressed, they have cravings for foods that are high in calories such as sweet, salty, and processed foods.  Not only do people crave bad food when they are nervous or stressed, but they eat large quantities of it through continuous snacking even though they might not be hungry.&lt;ref name=Stress&gt;{{cite journal |last=Epel |first=Elissa |title=Stress may add bite to appetite in women: a laboratory study of stress-induced cortisol and eating behavior|volume=26|issue=1|date=January 2001|pages=37–49|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306453000000354|accessdate=2014-03-07 |doi=10.1016/S0306-4530(00)00035-4 |pmid=11070333 |journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, an increase in weight can be seen in freshmen students even though they are eating normally.

A study done by Jatturong R. Wichianson and colleagues at the [[University of Southern California]] showed a direct relationship between eating late at night ([[Night eating syndrome]]) and stress levels with college students. They used a standardized test to measure both the levels of NES and perceived stress each student had. The results showed that students that had higher levels of stress were more likely to have NES due to the inability to adapt. This study shows that students who were not able to deal with stress appropriately were more likely to use late night eating to solve their issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Wichianson, Jatturong R. , Stephanie A. Bughi, Jennifer B. Unger, Donna Spruijt-Metz, Selena T.

==Body Image==
Many college students struggle with body image issues at some point. College students being happy with their body image is hard to maintain due to the stress and comparisons of other college students. Body image in college students is of great concern because body dissatisfaction is one of the most consistent risk factors for eating disorders and is a significant predictor of low self-esteem, depression, and obesity.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eatingdisorderhope.com/programs/colleges-and-universities/college-and-body-image&lt;/ref&gt; Eating disorders typically begin between the ages of 18 and 21. The two most common eating disorders are anorexia and bulimia. Anorexia deals with a person’s refusal to gain weight, disturbance of body image and the inability to maintain a certain weight. Bulimia is generally eating large amounts of food in a short period of time, usually within a span of two hours, then trying to get rid of the food by various methods; purging, laxatives or over-exercising.&lt;ref name="elon.edu"&gt;http://www.elon.edu/e-web/pendulum/Issues/2005/04_28/features/bodyimage.xhtml&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the "Freshman 15" makes students think that it is impossible to avoid when going to college. This is what develops eating disorders because students feel the need to be thin and skinny in order to avoid the "Freshman 15" weight gain. Statistics show that 91 percent of women attempt to control their weight by dieting.&lt;ref name="elon.edu"/&gt;

Body image is especially more popular with women. Currently, beautiful is considered good and thinness is synonymous with beauty, which makes it valued by society while its opposite, obesity, is strongly rejected. Although the ideals of female beauty vary as a function of esthetical standards adopted at each time, studies show that women have tried to change their bodies to follow these standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc = 3830171|year = 2012|last1 = Goswami|first1 = S|title = Body image satisfaction among female college students|journal = Industrial Psychiatry Journal|volume = 21|issue = 2|pages = 168–172|last2 = Sachdeva|first2 = S|last3 = Sachdeva|first3 = R|pmid = 24250055|doi = 10.4103/0972-6748.119653}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young women’s body image is greatly influenced by how they believed their friends and peers judged their bodies.

Developmental and social changes that may impact body image include: Physical and emotional separation from family, requirements for high academic performance, and transitions such as moving from home to residence hall.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.uhs.umich.edu/bodyimage&lt;/ref&gt;

==Male vs. female==
Nicole L. Mihalopoulos and colleagues developed a study at a private university in the Northeastern [[United States]].  Their goal was to determine if college students did truly gain weight in their freshmen year. Test subjects were made up of male and female freshmen college students who lived on campus. They took an online survey to answer questions about their eating patterns, social behaviors, as well as weight. The purpose of this was to discover if the individuals showed signs of body image issues or [[eating disorders]].

125 freshmen were eligible for testing and the average age was 18.4. The results showed that about half of the test subjects gained weight. The men gained an average of 3.7&amp;nbsp;lbs and women gained an average of 1.7&amp;nbsp;lbs their freshmen year. These results disproved their hypothesis that the women would have a larger weight gain than the men, but this stays consistent with other studies done on the hypothesis. Even though only 5% of the test subjects showed a weight gain of 15&amp;nbsp;lbs or greater the authors of this study concluded that the freshmen year in college has potential for weight gain and can even lead to obesity later on in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mihalopoulos, Nicole L.

The '''Sri Lankan Advanced Level''' ('''A-level'''), is a [[General Certificate of Education]] (GCE) qualification exam in [[Education in Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]], similar to the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Advanced Level (UK)|Advanced Level]], conducted annually by the [[Department of Examinations]] of the [[Ministry of Education (Sri Lanka)|Ministry of Education]]. It is usually taken by students during the optional final two years of [[Education in Sri Lanka#Secondary|collegiate level]] (grade 12 and 13  or external (non-school) candidates), after they have completed [[General Certificate of Education|GCE]] [[Ordinary Level (SL)|Ordinary Level]] exams. The majority of candidates enter the exams via their respective schools, while candidates who have finished school education can also apply as private applicants. The qualification also serves as an entrance requirement for Sri Lankan state universities. The exams are held in three mediums: [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[English language|English]].

==Fields of Study==
The candidates are expected to study for 2 years at collegiate level before taking the examination. The examination diversifies over 5 major fields of study,
# Physical Science stream (Combined mathematics, Physics and Chemistry/information technology )
# Biological Science stream (Biology (Botany and Zoology), Physics and Chemistry)
# Commerce stream
# Arts stream
# Technology stream (The subjects include [[Engineering Technology]], Bio-system Technology, Science for Technology and a category subject)

In each stream, candidates are expected to face 3 subjects related to the specific stream. Additionally, there would be a General English test and a Common General test. Although the result of the General English test is not taken into account for the University Entrance selection criteria, candidates are expected to obtain a pass mark for the Common General test.

==Exam procedure==
The exams are conducted each year in August, in selected national schools across the country. Invigilators and supervisors are appointed by the Department of Examinations and they are typically qualified teachers of the local school system. Candidates are allowed to sit for the exam 3 times to qualify for a state university, i.e. the candidates have to meet the minimum requirements for university admission within 3 attempts in order gain university admission. Candidates can sit for the examination any number of times in order to qualify for private courses or any other job requirements. The test assessments are carried out by marking panels usually consisting of qualified and experienced school teachers in service, who are guided by supervisors (usually university lecturers). It takes about 4–5 months for the final results of the island wide examination to be released and candidates have to wait further for around one year to enter a local university, depending on the university and the course/field of study.

==Physical Science stream==
Physical Science stream is also known as Maths stream. Mathematics stream has four main subjects: Combined Mathematics, [[Physics]], [[Chemistry]], and [[Information and Communication Technology]] (ICT). Under the recent syllabus, candidates can choose between either Chemistry or ICT, though Combined Mathematics and Physics are mandatory.
Combined Mathematics is a combination of [[Pure Mathematics]] and [[Applied Mathematics]]. Previously, the candidates had to follow these two subjects separately; by introducing Combined Mathematics syllabi, the two separate subjects were appended and redrafted.

The curriculum also consists of practical experiments that students are expected to participate in school laboratories.

==Biological Science stream==
Biological Science stream consists of three subjects: [[Biology]], [[Chemistry]], [[Physics]], and [[Agricultural Science]] as an optional subject. Candidates can choose either [[Physics]] or [[Agricultural Science]].

==Commerce stream==
Commerce Stream has three main subjects. They are [[Accounting]], [[Business Studies]] and [[Economics]]. Candidates do have the option of selecting either Business Studies or [[Business Statistics]] and Economics or [[Information Technology]] (IT)

==Technology stream==
Technology stream was introduced in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=“Technology” is introduced as a new stream into the Advanced Level subject streams|url=http://www.moe.gov.lk/english/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=894:technology-is-introduced-as-a-new-stream-into-the-advanced-level-subject-streams&amp;catid=344&amp;Itemid=771|publisher=Ministry of Education, Sri Lanka|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subjects include Engineering Technology, Bio-system Technology, Science for Technology, and ICT, or any other subject from the category. Candidates can choose between either Engineering Technology or Bio-system Technology. Science for Technology is a compulsory subject for both Engineering and Bio-system candidates.
Since the stream is relatively new, number of schools that have the facilities to teach the stream is limited or null in some areas for those who want to study those subjects.

==Arts stream==
Arts stream consists of [[Arts]], [[Languages]], [[Logic]] &amp; [[Scientific method]], [[Aesthetic]], and also Economics subjects.

==Criticism==
It has been noted that in recent years the exam has become extremely competitive and even traumatic for most high school students in Sri Lanka. For the academic year of 2013, out of 55,241 candidates who applied for university admission, only 43.8% were able to gain access to the state universities through the [[University Grants Commission (Sri Lanka)|University Grants Commission]] (UGC), despite satisfying minimum requirements for admission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Academic Year 2013/2014|url=http://www.ugc.ac.lk/downloads/admissions/local_students/Admission%20to%20Undergraduate%20Courses%20of%20the%20Universities%20in%20Sri%20Lanka%202013_2014.pdf|publisher=University Grants Commission - Sri Lanka|accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2010 study by [[Child and Adolescent Mental Health|Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health]], symptoms of [[anxiety]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]] were common more among students in GCE Advanced Level classes compared to other grades. Students in grade 13 had the second highest depression and anxiety scores, with examination related issues being the most commonly cited problem.  Out of the 445 students that were assessed, 22.9% of students in grade 12 and 28.6% in grade 13 reportedly had [[severe depression]], while 28.6% in grade 12 and 32.1% in grade 13 had [[anxiety disorder|severe anxiety]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Symptoms of anxiety and depression in adolescent students; a perspective from Sri Lanka|url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2F1753-2000-4-10.pdf|format=pdf|publisher=Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the [[Test anxiety|intimidating nature of the exam]], family pressure, and [[social stigma]] resulting from exam results, most students tend to get severely depressed if they fail to achieve desired results. Some cases of [[Suicide in Sri Lanka|suicide]] have been linked to the exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Student who failed A/L's commits suicide|url=http://www.hirunews.lk/52496/student-who-failed-ls-commits-suicide|publisher=Hiru News|accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Student commits suicide over A/L admission, principal suspended|url=http://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=31889|publisher=Ada Derana|accessdate=27 December 2017|date=August 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abeysekera|first1=Nalin Abeysekera|title=Education System of Sri Lanka- is committing suicide, a social outcome?|url=http://asiantribune.com/node/22000|publisher=Asian Tribune|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Short description|A document format for reporting studies in the scientific literature}}
{{broader|Scientific article}}
In scientific writing, '''IMRAD''' or '''IMRaD''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɪ|m|r|æ|d}}) ('''Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion''') is a common organizational structure (a document format). IMRaD is the most prominent norm for the structure of a [[scientific journal]] article of the [[original research]] type.&lt;ref name="pmid_15243643"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sollaci LB, Pereira MG | title = The introduction, methods, results, and discussion (IMRAD) structure: a fifty-year survey | journal = Journal of the Medical Library Association | volume = 92 | issue = 3 | pages = 364–7 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 15243643 | pmc = 442179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Scientific Writing and Communication in Agriculture and Natural Resources|last=P.

==Overview==
[[File:Wineglass model for IMRaD structure..png|thumb|Fig.1: Wineglass model for IMRaD structure. The above scheme schematically shows how to line up the information in IMRaD writing. It has two characteristics, first one is "top-bottom symmetric shape", second one is "change of width", that means "the top is wide and it narrows towards the middle, and then widens again as it goes down toward the bottom". First one, "top-bottom symmetric shape" represents the symmetry of the story development. Second one, the change of the width of above diagram, represents the change of generality of the viewpoint.]]
Original research articles are typically structured in this basic order&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.routledge.com/Scientific-And-Medical-Communication-A-Guide-For-Effective-Practice/Mogull/p/book/9781138842557|title=Scientific And Medical Communication: A Guide For Effective Practice|last=Mogull|first=Scott A. | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Routledge|year=2017|isbn=9781138842557|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hira&gt;{{cite book | first = Hilary | last = Glasman-deal | name-list-format = vanc | year = 2009 |title=Science research writing for non-native speakers of English |publisher=Imperial College Press |isbn=978-1-84816-310-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=George&gt;{{cite book | veditors= Hall GM | date = December 2012 |title=How to write a paper |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell, BMJ Books |isbn=978-0-470-67220-4 |edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Introduction – Why was the study undertaken? What was the [[research question]], the tested [[hypothesis]] or the purpose of the research?
*Methods – When, where, and how was the study done? What materials were used or who was included in the study groups (patients, etc.)?
*Results – What answer was found to the research question; what did the study find? Was the tested hypothesis true?
*Discussion – What might the answer imply and why does it matter? How does it fit in with what other researchers have found? What are the perspectives for future research?

The plot and the flow of the story of IMRaD is style writing are explained by a 'wine glass model'&lt;ref name=hira/&gt; or hourglass model.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Writing, compliant with IMRaD format (IMRaD writing) typically first presents "(a) the subject that positions the study from the wide perspective", "(b) outline of the study", develops through "(c) study method", and  "(d) the results", and concludes with "(e) outline and conclusion of the fruit of each topics", and "(f) the meaning of the study from the wide and general point of view".&lt;ref name=hira/&gt;  Here, (a) and (b) are mentioned in the section of the "Introduction", (c) and (d) are mentioned in the section of the "Method" and "Result" respectively, and (e) and (f) are mentioned in the section of the "Discussion" or "Conclusion".

In this sense, to explain how to line up the information in IMRaD writing, the 'wine glass model' (see the pattern diagram shown in Fig.1) will be helpful (see pp 2–3 of the Hilary Glasman-deal &lt;ref name=hira/&gt;). As mentioned in abovementioned textbook,&lt;ref name=hira/&gt; the scheme of 'wine glass model' have two characteristic. First one is "top-bottom symmetric shape" and Second one is "changing width" i.e. "the top is wide and it narrows towards the middle, and then widens again as it goes down toward the bottom". 
 
The First one, "top-bottom symmetric shape", represents the symmetry of the story development. Note the shape of the top trapezoid (representing the structure of Introduction) and the shape of the trapezoid at the bottom are reversed. This is expressing that the same subject introduced in Introduction will be taken up again in suitable formation for the section of Discussion/Conclusion in these section in the reversed order. (See the relationship between abovementioned  (a), (b) and (e), (f).)

The Second one, "the change of the width" of the schema shown in Fig.1, represents the change of generality of the view point. As along the flow of the story development, when the viewpoints are more general, the width of the diagram is expressed wider, and when they are more specialized and focused, the width is expressed narrower.

===As the standard format of academic journals===
The IMRAD format has been adopted by a steadily increasing number of [[academic journal]]s since the first half of the 20th century. The IMRAD structure has come to dominate academic writing in the sciences, most notably in [[empirical]] biomedicine.&lt;ref name="pmid_15243643"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Day |first=RA |title=The Origins of the Scientific Paper: The IMRAD Format |journal=American Medical Writers Association Journal |year=1989 |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=16–18 |url=http://www.amwa.org/default/publications/journal/scanned/v04.2.pdf |access-date=2011-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927083129/http://www.amwa.org/default/publications/journal/scanned/v04.2.pdf |archive-date=September 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szklo|first=Moyses | name-list-format = vanc |title=Quality of scientific articles|journal=Revista de Saúde Pública|year=2006|volume=40|pages=30–35|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0034-89102006000400005&amp;nrm=iso|access-date=2011-06-17|doi=10.1590/s0034-89102006000400005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure of most [[public health journal]] articles reflects this trend. Although the IMRAD structure originates in the empirical sciences, it now also regularly appears in academic journals across a wide range of [[discipline (academia)|disciplines]]. Many scientific journals now not only prefer this structure but also use the IMRAD acronym as an instructional device in the instructions to their authors, recommending the use of the four terms as main headings. For example, it is explicitly recommended in the "[[Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals]]" issued by the [[International Committee of Medical Journal Editors]] (previously called the ''[[Vancouver guidelines]]''): &lt;blockquote&gt;
The text of observational and experimental articles is usually (but not necessarily) divided into the following sections: Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion. This so-called "IMRAD" structure is not an arbitrary publication format but rather a direct reflection of the process of scientific discovery. Long articles may need subheadings within some sections (especially Results and Discussion) to clarify their content. Other types of articles, such as case reports, reviews, and editorials, probably need to be formatted differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icmje.org/urm_full.pdf |title=Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals: Writing and Editing for Biomedical Publication - IV.A.1.a. General Principles |publisher=International Committee of Medical Journal Editors |access-date=2010-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706184319/http://www.icmje.org/urm_full.pdf |archive-date=July 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The IMRAD structure is also recommended for empirical studies in the 6th edition of the publication manual of the [[American Psychological Association]] ([[APA style]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=American Psychological Association|publisher=American Psychological Association|edition=6th|year=2010|title=Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association|isbn=978-1-4338-0562-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The APA publication manual is widely used by journals in the [[social science|social]], [[educational research|educational]] and [[behavioral science]]s.&lt;ref name=Tampere&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uta.fi/FAST/FIN/RESEARCH/imrad.html|title=The IMRAD Research Paper Format|publisher=Department of Translation Studies, [[University of Tampere]]|access-date=2008-10-22|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025070226/http://www.uta.fi/FAST/FIN/RESEARCH/imrad.html|archive-date=2008-10-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
The IMRAD structure has proved successful because it facilitates literature review, allowing readers to navigate articles more quickly to locate material relevant to their purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burrough-Boenisch|first=J|title=International Reading Strategies for IMRD Articles|journal=Written Communication|year=1999|volume=16|issue=3|pages=296–316|url=http://wcx.sagepub.com/content/16/3/296.abstract|access-date=2011-06-17|doi=10.1177/0741088399016003002}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the neat order of IMRAD rarely corresponds to the actual sequence of events or ideas of the research presented; the IMRAD structure effectively supports a reordering that eliminates unnecessary detail, and allows the reader to assess a well-ordered and noise-free presentation of the relevant and significant information. It allows the most relevant information to be presented clearly and logically to the readership, by summarizing the research process in an ideal sequence and without unnecessary detail.

==Caveats==
The idealised sequence of the IMRAD structure has on occasion been criticised for being too rigid and simplistic. In a radio talk in 1964 the [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel laureate]] [[Peter Medawar]] even criticised this instructive text structure for not giving a realistic representation of the thought processes of the writing scientist: "… the scientific paper may be a fraud because it misrepresents the processes of thought that accompanied or gave rise to the work that is described in the paper".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Medawar|first=P|title=Is the scientific paper fraudulent?|journal=The Saturday Review|year=1964|issue=August 1|pages=42–43|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev-1964aug01-00042|access-date=2012-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medawar's criticism was discussed at the XIXth General Assembly of the [[World Medical Association]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brain|first=L|title=Structure of the scientific paper|journal=Br Med J|volume=2|year=1965|issue=2|pages=868–869|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/2/5466/868.full.pdf|access-date=2011-06-19|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.5466.868 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Report of Editors' Conference |journal=BMJ |date=9 October 1965 |volume=2 |issue=5466 |pages=870–872 |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.5466.870 | url = http://www.bmj.com/content/2/5466/870.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; While respondents may argue that it is too much to ask from such a simple instructional device to carry the burden of representing the entire process of scientific discovery, Medawar's caveat expressed his belief that many students and faculty throughout academia treat the structure as a simple panacea. Medawar and others have given testimony both to the importance and to the limitations of the device.

==Abstract considerations==
In addition to the scientific article itself a brief [[abstract (summary)|abstract]] is usually required for publication. The abstract should, however, be composed to function as an autonomous text, even if some authors and readers may think of it as an almost integral part of the article. The increasing importance of well-formed autonomous abstracts may well be a consequence of the increasing use of searchable digital abstract archives, where a well-formed abstract will dramatically increase the probability for an article to be found by its optimal readership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Structured Abstract Initiative |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/resources/html/about/sa_initiative.html |publisher=Education Resources Information Center |access-date=2011-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608181554/http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/resources/html/about/sa_initiative.html |archive-date=June 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, there is a strong recent trend toward developing formal requirements for abstracts, most often structured on the IMRAD pattern, and often with strict additional specifications of topical content items that should be considered for inclusion in the abstract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ripple AM, Mork JG, Knecht LS, Humphreys BL | title = A retrospective cohort study of structured abstracts in MEDLINE, 1992-2006 | journal = Journal of the Medical Library Association | volume = 99 | issue = 2 | pages = 160–3 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21464855 | pmc = 3066587 | doi = 10.3163/1536-5050.99.2.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such abstracts are often referred to as "structured abstracts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Structured Abstracts|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/policy/structured_abstracts.html|author=U.S. National Library of Medicine|date=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growing importance of abstracts in the era of computerized literature search and [[information overload]] has led some users to modify the IMRAD acronym to AIMRAD, in order to give due emphasis to the abstract.

==Heading style variations==
Usually, the IMRAD article sections use the IMRAD words as [[wikt:heading|heading]]s. A few variations can occur, as follows: 
* Many journals have a convention of omitting the "Introduction" heading, based on the idea that the reader who begins reading an article does not need to be told that the beginning of the text is the introduction. This print-era proscription is fading since the advent of the Web era, when having an explicit "Introduction" heading helps with navigation via document maps and collapsible/expandable [[table of contents|TOC]] trees. (The same considerations are true regarding the presence or proscription of an explicit "Abstract" heading.)
* In some journals, the "Methods" heading may vary, being "Methods and materials", "Materials and methods", or similar phrases. Some journals mandate that exactly the same wording for this heading be used for all articles without exception; other journals reasonably accept whatever each submitted manuscript contains, as long as it is one of these sensible variants.
* The "Discussion" section may [[wikt:subsume|subsume]] any "Summary", "Conclusion", or "Conclusions" section, in which case there may or may not be any explicit "Summary", "Conclusion", or "Conclusions" [[wikt:subheading|subheading]]; or the "Summary"/"Conclusion"/"Conclusions" section may be a separate section, using an explicit heading on the same heading hierarchy level as the "Discussion" heading. Which of these variants to use as the default is a matter of each journal's chosen style, as is the question of whether the default style must be forced onto every article or whether sensible inter-article flexibility will be allowed.

==Other elements that are typical although not part of the [[acrostic]]==
* Disclosure statements (''see main article at [[conflicts of interest in academic publishing]]'')
** Reader's theme that is the point of this element's existence: "Why should I (the reader) trust or believe what you (the author) say? Are you just making money off of saying it?"
** Appear either in opening footnotes or a section of the article body
** Subtypes of disclosure:
*** Disclosure of funding (grants to the project)
*** Disclosure of conflict of interest (grants to individuals, jobs/salaries, stock or stock options)
* Clinical relevance statements
** Reader's theme that is the point of this element's existence: "Why should I (the reader) spend my time reading what you say? How is it relevant to my clinical practice? Basic research is nice, other people's cases are nice, but my time is triaged, so make your case for 'why bother'"
** Appear either as a display element (sidebar) or a section of the article body
** Format: short, a few sentences or bullet points
* Ethical compliance statements 
** Reader's theme that is the point of this element's existence: "Why should I believe that your study methods were ethical?"
** "We complied with the [[Declaration of Helsinki]]."
** "We got our study design approved by our local [[institutional review board]] before proceeding."
** "We got our study design approved by our local ethics committee before proceeding."
** "We treated our animals in accordance with our local [[Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee]]."

==Additional standardization (reporting guidelines)==

&lt;!-- [[Reporting standards in the scientific literature]] redirects here. This section needs to be [[WP:SPINOFF|spun off]] to a separate article titled "[[Reporting standards in the scientific literature]]", but I am not sure how soon I can devote time to building v1.0 of such an article. --&gt;

In the late 20th century and early 21st, the scientific communities found that the communicative value of journal articles was still much less than it could be if [[best practice]]s were developed, promoted, and enforced. Thus reporting guidelines (guidelines for how best to report information) arose. The general theme has been to create [[template (word processing)|templates]] and [[checklist]]s with the message to the user being, "your article is not complete until you have done all of these things." In the 1970s, the ICMJE (International Committee of Medical Journal Editors) released the [[Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals]] (Uniform Requirements or URM). Other such [[technical standard|standards]], mostly developed in the 1990s through 2010s, are listed below. The academic medicine community is working hard on trying to raise compliance with good reporting standards, but there is still much to be done;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Couzin-Frankel|first=Jennifer|date=2018-09-19|title=‘Journalologists’ use scientific methods to study academic publishing. Is their work improving science?|url=https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aav4758|journal=Science|language=en|doi=10.1126/science.aav4758|issn=0036-8075}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, a 2016 review of instructions for authors in 27 emergency medicine journals found insufficient mention of reporting standards,&lt;ref name="pmid_27881175"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sims MT, Henning NM, Wayant CC, Vassar M | title = Do emergency medicine journals promote trial registration and adherence to reporting guidelines? A survey of "Instructions for Authors" | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Trauma, Resuscitation and Emergency Medicine | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 137 | date = November 2016 | pmid = 27881175 | pmc = 5121955 | doi = 10.1186/s13049-016-0331-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2018 study found that even when journals' instructions for authors mention reporting standards, there is a difference between a mention or [[web badge|badge]] and enforcing the requirements that the mention or badge represents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Leung V, Rousseau-Blass F, Beauchamp G, Pang DS | title = ARRIVE has not ARRIVEd: Support for the ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting of in vivo Experiments) guidelines does not improve the reporting quality of papers in animal welfare, analgesia or anesthesia | journal = PLOS One | volume = 13 | issue = 5 | pages = e0197882 | date = 2018-05-24 | pmid = 29795636 | pmc = 5967836 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0197882 | url = https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0197882 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of a need for best practices in [[data sharing]] has expanded the scope of these efforts beyond merely the pages of the journal article itself. In fact, from the most rigorous versions of the [[evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] perspective, the distance to go is still quite formidable.&lt;ref name="pmid_29595127"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jefferson T, Jørgensen L | title = Redefining the 'E' in EBM | journal = BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 46–47 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29595127 | doi = 10.1136/bmjebm-2018-110918 | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most researchers cannot be familiar with all of the many reporting standards that now exist, but it is enough to know which ones must be followed in one's own work, and to know where to look for details when needed. Several organizations provide help with this task of checking one's own compliance with the latest standards: 
* The [[EQUATOR Network]]
* The BioSharing collaboration ([https://biosharing.org/ biosharing.org])

Several important webpages on this topic are: 
* NLM's list at [https://www.nlm.nih.gov/services/research_report_guide.html Research Reporting Guidelines and Initiatives: By Organization] 
* The EQUATOR Network's list at [http://www.equator-network.org/toolkits/using-guidelines-in-journals/reporting-guidelines-and-journals-fact-fiction/ Reporting guidelines and journals: fact &amp; fiction]
* TRANSPOSE [https://transpose-publishing.github.io (Transparency in Scholarly Publishing for Open Scholarship Evolution)], “a grassroots initiative to build a crowdsourced database of journal policies,” allowing faster and easier lookup and comparison, and potentially spurring harmonization

Relatedly, [[SHERPA (organisation)|SHERPA]] provides compliance-checking tools, and [[AllTrials]] provides a rallying point, for efforts to enforce [[open data|openness]] and completeness of [[clinical trial]] reporting. These efforts stand against [[publication bias]] and against [[corporatocracy|excessive corporate influence]] on [[scientific integrity]].

'''Ilia State University (ISU)''', located in [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], is a higher education institution, established in 2006 as a merger of six different educational and research institutions.

==Study==
[[File:Iliauni new ligamus.jpg|thumbnail|"Ligamus" book store at Iliauni]]
In its activities, Ilia State University follows the model of a research triangle. This justifies the existence of three interdisciplinary directions at the University:

# Georgian studies; 
# Researches in fundamental and applied sciences; 
# Participation in international research.

The university was the first university in Georgia to introduce principles of [[liberal education]].

In 2012, a new standard for teaching called [[RESULT – Research and Education Systems Unified as Learning Tools|RESULT (Research and Education Systems United as Learning Tools)]] was implemented, which means that students and professors are communicating about a specific research issue and carry out research together (research based teaching). The important part of teaching was planned according to this new format by faculty professors.RESULT allows students to learn by "doing", i.e., by means of participation in the research projects.

==Faculties==

There are four Schools in the university, each offering undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate programs:

* '''School of Arts and Sciences''', the professors of the school are united  in  more than 20 research institutes. The research programs of institutes at the same time serves as MA, MSc and PhD. Programs’ axis. The philosophy of the faculty is to involve students even from the first year of undergraduate education in the research process. 
* '''Iliauni Business School''' founded in 2008 as the faculty of Business and Law. T [http://ibr.iliauni.edu.ge/index.php/ge/ he Economic Research and Consulting Center of Iliauni Business School] leads research and consulting activities involving students.
* '''School of Law''', 2012 School of Law became a member of the [[International Association of Law Schools]] and [[International Law Association|International Lawyers Association]].
* '''School of Natural Sciences and Engineering''', offers programs in: Architecture, Building Constructions and Computer Science. Includes: Institute of [http://seismo.iliauni.edu.ge/eqs/eqs.php Earth Science]; [http://artcenter.iliauni.edu.ge/ Fine and Applied Arts Center]; Nanotechnologies

==Research==
The university operates 25 research institutes, centers and laboratories dispersed across the country.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9351">'''Inclusive education in Latin America''' aims at giving all people of the region the right to access education. Its development consists of four aspects that may define the position of the debate on inclusive education in the region:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002475/247577E.pdf|title=Youth and changing realities: Rethinking secondary education in Latin America|last=Néstor López|first=Renato Opertti|last2=Vargas Tamez|first2=Carlos|publisher=UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-31 00204-5|location=|pages=64–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Combining traditional programmes with new approaches
# Focusing in and beyond the education system
# Educational progressivism
# Understanding the past and the present

== Combining traditional programmes with new approaches ==
In [[Latin America]] as a whole, the most traditional programmes – mainly built around the concepts of equity and quality – exist side by side with those reflecting renewed sensibilities and approaches, through such themes as [[Education for sustainable development|Education for Sustainable Development]] (ESD), comprehensive citizenship education, [[intercultural bilingual education]] and [[ICTs]], and academic inclusion. Rather than being anchored in one unified approach, the new agendas tend more to combine together, stacking on top of one another and adding up to a sum of divided trends, projects and interventions. They are predominantly based on educational provision and maintain a fairly marginal relationship with the core of the education system (i.e. its essence and substance). [[The Education Agenda 2030]] presents an alternative to a programme of accumulated themes and places Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) and [[Global citizenship education|Global Citizenship Education]] (GCED) at the core of formal, [[Nonformal learning|non-formal and informal education]] through comprehensive measures and academic support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Incheon Declaration and Education 2030: Education 2030: Towards inclusive and equitable quality education and lifelong learning for all|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Furthermore, the incorporation of new subjects to the regional agenda has not induced a rethinking of what is understood in the field of [[Inclusion (education)|inclusive education]] or what the options and the paths needed to achieve greater equity and quality truly involves. For example, with respect to achieving intercultural bilingual education, we should ask ourselves whether this is rooted in references and [[curriculum]] frameworks common to all or, alternatively, requires separate curricula. Likewise, when considering inclusion, if we should aim to deal with the specific nature of groups linked to intercultural bilingual education with or without a base in universal policies or what type of universalism this should be based on; or rather, whether equity involves guaranteeing access to education for these groups or differentiating curriculum approaches and [[Pedagogy|pedagogic]] strategies to lend education meaning and relevance for them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Generally speaking, education systems are immersed in a variety of actions that seek to overcome the lack or inadequacy of common conceptual threads among the various educational levels. It is possible to consider this while still acknowledging the lack of unified policy frameworks and the ordering of priorities. In any case, education systems are often constructed more in terms of service providers as opposed to providers of learning opportunities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Focusing in and beyond the education system ==
Within the field of inclusive education, there are a variety of approaches, policies and interventions that may place the responsibility for the achievement of inclusion outside the education system and instead on those systems that assimilate people with [[special needs]]. The multiple foundations of inclusive education policies reflect an adaptable concept that generally lacks its own meaning and projection but instead serves the purpose of other policies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Educational progressivism ==
{{Progressivism sidebar}}
Latin America presents a case of unfinished [[democratization]] when it comes to genuine inclusion and educational achievements. Certainly, and particularly in the last 15 years, the region has made notable progress in at least four fundamental respects that fall under what could be termed ‘[[Educational Progressivism|educational progressivism]]’: i) the strengthening of the concept of [[Right to education|education as a right]] and [[public good]] to the detriment of the concept of education as a service and [[consumer good]]; ii) expansion of the right to education through an extension of compulsory schooling, with an emphasis on lower and upper secondary education; iii) greater investment in education as a percentage of GDP of each country and a steady improvement of the conditions and inputs aimed at supporting teaching and learning processes, chiefly with respect to physical infrastructures, equipment and materials; and finally iv) the priority given to improving the working conditions and pay of teachers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Educational progressivism has generated the political will to bring about positive change in the regulatory framework and the conditions to implement the right to education and the improvement of learning opportunities, but this has not been matched by the political will to provide each and every child and young person a chance to participate in education and learning. For the most part, this endeavour has lacked the full-bodied institutional, curricular and academic policies needed to achieve this goal. More often, educational progressivism has tended to make use of the traditional battery of classroom approaches thought ‘to be advanced’, as in the case of the different variants of constructivism rather than to reflect on what are the most pertinent combinations of curriculum and teaching approaches to support and guide learners towards gaining access to relevant and sustainable learning processes. Currently, the urgent need to realize a huge academic effort tailored to the individual learner has not been sufficiently weighted – nor has this effort been valued or recognized – as a fundamental ingredient for policy change in education.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Understanding the past and the present ==
How to situate oneself in the most recent past and present in order to get to the root of the problem of achieving inclusive education. A superficial [[History|historical]] perspective ranging over the past four decades runs the risk of presenting an ideological vision classifying this period in terms of gains and setbacks, without any nuances or transitions. Yet, it is important to observe that the challenges to inclusive education have not been confronted or solutions channelled sustainably and satisfactorily in a great variety of ideological and political frameworks. If by inclusion, we understand equity and [[justice]] in the processes, participation and outcomes, which entails seeking [[Human equality|equality]] starting from the recognition of differences,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001425/142599s.pdf|title=Equidad educativa y desigualdad social. Desafíos a la educación en el nuevo escenario latinoamericano|last=López|first=N.|publisher=Buenos Aires, UNESCO-IIPE|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; then inclusion in this sense constitutes an unfinished business on account of both conservatism and progressivism in education.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Challenges ==
From a joint regional perspective, it is possible to identify four orders of problems that obstruct inclusive education:
# The aggregation of policies for educational changes without any comprehensive rethinking of the vision of education and the role of the education system as their guarantor and support
# The broad array of concepts of inclusive education and its adaptability for supporting a wide range of education policy proposals
# The lack of linkages between the discourse, regulatory framework and real conditions for putting into practice the right to education, along with the implementation of educational practices bent more on educational approaches than thought from understanding and regarding the expectations and needs of the learners
# The observation that inclusive education is thus still unfinished business under democratic governments with markedly different political, economic and social differences&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''International Information Centre for Terminology''' ('''Infoterm''') was founded in 1971 by [[UNESCO]]. Its goal is "to support and co-ordinate international co-operation in the field of terminology."&lt;ref name="itw"&gt;[http://www.infoterm.info/ Infoterm website], Vienna, 2011. Accessed 2012-06-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Infoterm members are national, international and regional institutions, organizations, networks and specialized public, semi-public or other non-profit institutions engaged in devising and standardizing terminology.&lt;ref name="itw" /&gt; Members are drawn from Africa, the Americas, Asia and Europe.

==History==
Since the early 1930s in [[Wieselburg]], [[Austria]], industrialist [[Eugen Wüster]] led a private centre studying terminology as part of his engineering firm. His research on international technical communication resulted in the 1936 founding of the Technical Committee for Terminology Standardization of the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO/TC 37). During the 1950s and 1960s Wüster formulated a [[terminology|general theory of terminology]] and was a pioneer of [[ISO/TC 37|terminological standardization]]. In 1951 the [[Austrian Standards Institute]] (ASI) made Wüster general secretary responsible for its terminology principles and coordination efforts (the [[ISO/TC 37]] technical committee).

As a result of his pioneering activity, in 1971 UNESCO signed a contract with ASI establishing Infoterm as an international organization; from that year until 2008 Infoterm would assume guidance of the secretariat that Wüster had led for its first 20 years. After Wüster's death in 1977, his fame as the father of terminology science gained widespread currency, and Infoterm took control of his legacy in 1982. In 1996 Infoterm became an independent international non-profit scientific association and established the Eugen Wüster Archive at the [[University of Vienna]].

==Infoterm activities==
Infoterm aims to coordinate terminological cooperation internationally to facilitate subject-area communication and knowledge exchange, enabling all who are active in a particular field to participate. Its main areas of action are international collaboration on terminology, terminology policy, legal aspects of terminology data (copyright), theory and methodology of structured content (terminology database management) and terminological standardization.

==Eugen Wüster Prize==
From 1997, Infoterm began awarding the now triennial Eugen Wüster Prize to recognize outstanding performance in the field of terminology.&lt;ref name="awards"&gt;[http://www.infoterm.info/activities/terminology_awards.php Terminology Awards], Infoterm, 12 October 2011.

The '''International Max Planck Research School for Molecular Life Sciences''' (short: IMPRS-LS) is a German centre for postgraduate training and research in [[life sciences]]. It is one among over 60 International Max Planck Research Schools in Germany. It is located in [[Munich]] and was established in 2005. The Ph.D. program is organised by three of the [[Max Planck Institutes]] and two universities in Munich.

==International Max Planck Research Schools==
To date more than 60 International Max Planck Research Schools (short: IMPRS) have been established in Germany, each representing a joint cooperative of [[Max Planck Institutes]] and one or several German universities. The concept for the International Max Planck Research Schools was jointly developed in 1999 by the [[Max Planck Society]] and the so-called Hochschul Rektoren Konferenz (HRK), a body representing all German universities. The aim of these PhD programs is to offer German and international doctoral students a first class education in innovative and interdisciplinary research environments with facilities and research projects. Each International Max Planck Research School covers a specific topic in one of the following areas: chemistry, physics &amp; technology, biology &amp; medicine or human sciences. In contrast to traditional doctoral education in Germany where a doctoral student is trained and supervised individually by a professor or group leader, Max Planck Research Schools offer structured programs with a defined curriculum and a supervision by a committee of normally 3 or more expert scientists.  Language of instruction is [[English language|English]]. German language courses are provided to interested international students. 
In order to maintain highest educational standards, all IMPRS programs are evaluated on a regular basis by an international and independent scientific commission.

== International Max Planck Research School for Molecular Life Sciences (IMPRS-LS)==
The International Max Planck Research School for Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences (short: IMPRS-LS) was established in 2005. The research oriented PhD program is jointly organized by the [[Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry]], the [[Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology]] and the [[Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry]] in cooperation with two of Germany's leading universities, the [[Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München]] and the [[Technische Universität München]]. Over 60 research groups from the [[Munich]] area participate in the program, covering many aspects of [[life sciences]] including [[biochemistry]], [[cell biology]], [[molecular medicine]], [[neurobiology]] and [[structural biology]].

IMPRS-LS is 100% committed to basic research and aims to address fundamental questions in the following research areas: 

* Biochemistry
* Biophysics
* Bio-imaging
* Computational Biology
* Gene Regulation
* Immunology
* Neurobiology
* Neurodegeneration
* Protein Structure
* Signaling
* Systems Biology

Although students specialize in a particular research topic, the interdisciplinary context of the program facilitates interactions with other research groups and fosters the ability of cross-frontier thinking. Laboratory work is supplemented by seminars, summer schools, elective courses, training in soft skills and participation in national or international conferences. Currently, some 140 doctoral students are enrolled in IMPRS-LS and approximately 50% of those come from abroad (Germany: 50%, Europe: 30%, Overseas: 20%)

Annually, 30 to 40 doctoral students from all over the world are accepted to the program. Deadline for application is January 6, each year. All doctoral students receive a fellowship covering living expenses and tuition. Entry requirement is a [[MSc]] degree (or equivalent) in the fields of [[biology]], [[biochemistry]], [[bioinformatics]], [[biophysics]], [[biotechnology]], [[medicine]] or in a related discipline. The doctoral degree is usually awarded by one of the two participating Munich universities. International doctoral students may also obtain their doctoral degree from a university residing in their home country.

Currently, more than 250 doctoral students from all over the world are working at the Max Planck Institutes of Biochemistry and Neurobiology, together with numerous doctoral students from close by university laboratories. Amongst other activities, graduate students organize a regular social get together, a seminar series, and [https://www.interact-munich.com/ &lt;interact&gt;], an annual student symposium.

'''The International Society for Performance Improvement''' ('''ISPI''') is a non-profit association for performance improvement professionals dedicated to improving individual, organizational, and societal functioning, productivity, and accomplishment in the workplace.

==Membership==
ISPI has both a US and international membership base with members in more than 53 countries. In addition to the international organization ISPI sponsors local chapters in major cities through the United States and Canada and has affiliates in Europe, Africa, and Asia as well as members in South America and Australia. The association’s members work in various types of organizations, including business, industry, government, military, education (K-12 and post secondary), non-profit and as independent consultants.

==Professional Standards and Ethics==
With its roots in the 1960s, '''Human Performance Technology''' (HPT), sometimes known as '''Human Performance Improvement''' (HPI), grew primarily from behavioral psychology and Instructional Systems Design (ISD).  Nowadays HPT also draws from many other disciplines such as Human Factors, quality improvement, process improvement, Instructional and Educational Technologies, Organization Development, motivation and reward research, training research to change performance and achieve worthy outcomes. (See ISPI, 2007.)

HPT aims to overcome problems and address opportunities for improved outcomes at societal, organizational, process and individual levels.  It uses systemic, rigorous analytical processes to identify and define requirements for change, determine existing obstacles and potential facilitators for specified changes, and select and develop appropriate interventions to improve outcomes.  Following tenets of evidence-based practice, HPT also initiates and implements interventions effectively to achieve meaningful and sustained change in outcomes throughout their life cycle.  Evaluation is also a central aspect of HPT, and is used during planning, carrying out, and following up interventions by measuring results against identified requirements.

In 2002 ISPI convened a group of workplace managers, business consultants, and academics met to define what skills and abilities a performance technology practitioner needed.  That group established a set of ten standards of performance:
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ispi.org/uploadedFiles/ISPI_Site/About_ISPI/About/Standards.pdf] ISPI Standards of Performance Technology&lt;/ref&gt;

#Focus on Results,
#Take a Systems View,
#Add Value,
#Utilize Partnerships,
#Systematicly Assess the Opportunity or Need,
#Identify the Factors That Limit Performance,
#Design the Solution or the Speciation for the Solution,
#Create (Develop) the Solution,
#Implement the Solution, and
#Evaluate the Process and Its Results.

That set of standards was validated in a subsequent study conducted by graduate students at Indiana University.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Validating_the_ISPI_Standards_and_Princi.html?id=2clR4263vosC&amp;redir_esc=y] Lauer, M.J. (2008) Validating the ISPI standards and principles for the Certified Performance Technologist. INDIANA UNIVERSITY&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the ten standards, ISPI created a code of ethics &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ispi.org/uploadedFiles/ISPI_Site/About_ISPI/About/Code-of-Ethics.pdf] ISPI Code of Ethics&lt;/ref&gt; as a guide for its members. This set of standards and code of ethics are a basis for ISPI’s Certified Performance Technologist credential (CPT).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ispi.org/content.aspx?id=186&amp;linkidentifier=id&amp;itemid=186] ISPI CPT Certification&lt;/ref&gt;

The CPT designation permits individuals to demonstrate proficiency in the ten Standards of Performance Technology.  This demonstration enables employers and clients to determine the qualifications and applied skills of a performance improvement professional with a standardized measurement. The certification indicates that the CPT has demonstrated that her or his work results in measurable positive impact in the workplace. The certification also provides the CPT with the means to promote his or her skills and experience. Since the certification is performance-based, not education-based, individuals who demonstrate proficiency in ten Standards of Performance Technology and commit to the ISPI Code of Ethics can be certified regardless of their educational background. Re-certification is required every three years thus demonstrating ongoing learning, growth and professional development

==About ISPI==
The mission of ISPI is to advance the field of Human Performance Technology, advocate its application, and enhance the skills and professional standing of its practitioners.

ISPI’s stated vision is that “our technology will be recognized as the premier approach to improving the performance of people, groups and organizations and that we who competently apply it will be widely recognized by employers and clients as reliable sources of significant value”.

The roots of ISPI began on January 29, 1962 at the Randolph Air Force Base Officers’ Club in San Antonio, Texas, during a dinner meeting held to organize the Programmed Learning Society. The stated purpose of the Society was to collect, develop, and diffuse information concerned with programmed instruction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ispi.org/pl/history/ispi.swf] NSPI/ISPI Interactive Timeline&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1962 the Society adopted a new name—National Society for Programmed Instruction (NSPI) and a constitution was adopted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ispi.org/pl/history/ispi.swf] ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 the name was changed to National Society for Performance and Instruction to reflect a broader interest in improving workplace performance using solutions that are both instructional and non-instructional (job-aids, work redesign, process improvement, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ispi.org/pl/history/ispi.swf] ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 the Human Performance Technology (HPT) model was developed &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ispi.org/pl/history/ispi.swf] ibid&lt;/ref&gt; to reflect the work of Thomas Gilbert, one of the founders of the field of human performance improvement and a long-time member of NSPI.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ispi.org/pl/history/ispi.swf] ibid&lt;/ref&gt;  That same year the Handbook of Human Performance Technology edited by Harold Stolovitch and Erica Keeps was co-published with Jossey-Bass, Inc. to provide readers with the first comprehensive guide to the fundamental knowledge necessary to improve human performance in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ispi.org/pl/history/ispi.swf] ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1995 the membership voted to change the name to the International Society for Performance Improvement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ispi.org/pl/history/ispi.swf] ibid&lt;/ref&gt; With members living and working in more than 30 countries, it was felt that ISPI more accurately reflected the breadth and geographic diversity of the membership and acknowledged the wide variety of interventions that comprise human performance technology.  That same year the Board approved funding to establish the ISPI Book Program. The book program better positioned ISPI as the primary source of information about HPT.

In 1996 the Board approved the development of a Research Endowment, investing $150,000 with the interest being used to fund research projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ispi.org/pl/history/ispi.swf] ibid&lt;/ref&gt; The fund’s support of research to advance the field of human performance ensured ISPI’s continuing leadership as the primary disseminator of performance improvement information.

In 1999 the Principles &amp; Practices Institute debuted at Annual Conference. The three-day Institute was designed disseminate the integration of HPT models, concepts, and research findings through the analysis of real cases for the first time. The Handbook for Human Performance: Improving Individual and Organizational Performance Worldwide (2nd Edition) edited by Erica Keeps and Harold Stolovitch debuted at Annual Conference in 1999. The revised Handbook focused on the global nature of HPT.

== Continuing Professional Education==
ISPI hosts an annual conference in major cities in the U.S. and Canada. The ISPI EMEA affiliate hosts an annual conference in Europe.  Additional educational events include pre-conference one- and two-day workshops, a monthly webinar, a quarterly experts’ series, the Performance and Practices Institute, the Certified Performance Technology Workshop and topics presented at local chapter meetings throughout the year.

'''Irawati Karve''' (1905&amp;nbsp;– August 11 ,1970) was an [[anthropologist]], [[sociologist]], educationist and writer from [[Maharashtra]], [[India]].

== Early life and education ==
Karve was born in 1905 to a wealthy [[Chitpavan Brahmin]] family and was named after the [[Irrawaddy River]] in Burma where her father, Ganesh Hari Karmarkar, was working for the [[Burma Cotton Company]]. She attended the girls boarding school [[Huzurpaga]] in [[Pune]] from the age of seven and then studied philosophy at [[Fergusson College]], from which she graduated in 1926. She then obtained a Dakshina Fellowship to study sociology under [[G. S. Ghurye]] at [[Bombay University]], obtaining a master's degree in 1928 with a thesis on the subject of her own [[caste]] titled ''The Chitpavan Brahmans&amp;nbsp;— An Ethnic Study''.{{sfnp|Sundar|2007|pp=367-368, 377|ps=}}

Karve married Dinkar Dhondo Karve, who taught chemistry in a school, while studying with Ghurye. Although her husband was from a socially distinguished Brahmin family, the match did not meet with approval from her father, who had hoped that she would marry into the ruling family of a [[princely state]]. Dinkar was a son of [[Dhondo Keshav Karve]], a campaigner for women's rights who, somewhat contradictorily, opposed Dinkar's decision to send her to Germany for further studies.{{sfnp|Sundar|2007|pp=368-369|ps=}}{{efn|Dinkar Karve later became principal of Fergusson College.{{sfnp|Sundar|2007|p=370|ps=}}}}

The time in Germany, which commenced in November 1928, was financed by a loan from [[Jivraj Mehta]], a member of the [[Indian National Congress]], and was inspired by Dinkar's own educational experiences in that country, where he had obtained his PhD in [[organic chemistry]] a decade or so earlier. She studied at the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics]], was awarded a doctorate two years later{{efn|Karve studied philosophy, Sanskrit and zoology as well as eugenics for her PhD, which was titled ''The normal asymmetry of the human skull''.{{sfnp|Sundar|2007|p=380|ps=}}}} and then returned to her husband in India, where the couple lived a rather unconventional life less bound by the social strictures that were common at that time.{{sfnp|Sundar|2007|pp=370-371, 378|ps=}}{{efn|Examples of the Karve family's unconventionality include Irawati's decision not to wear any of the traditional symbols associated with married Hindu women, an unusual degree of familiarity in address between her, her husband and their children, and her being the first woman in Pune to ride a [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooter]].{{sfnp|Sundar|2007|p=371|ps=}}}} Her husband was an [[atheist]] and she explained her own visits to the Hindu shrine to [[Vithoba]] at [[Pandharpur]] as out of deference for "tradition" rather than belief. Despite all this, theirs was essentially a [[middle-class]] Hindu family in outlook and deed.{{sfnp|Sundar|2007|p=371|ps=}}

== Career ==
Karve worked as an administrator at [[SNDT Women's University]] in Bombay from 1931 to 1936 and did some postgraduate teaching in the city. She moved to Pune's [[Deccan College Post-Graduate and Research Institute|Deccan College]] as a [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in sociology in 1939 and remained there for the rest of her career.{{sfnp|Sundar|2007|pp=380-381|ps=}}

According to Nandini Sundar, Karve was the first Indian female anthropologist, a discipline that in India during her lifetime was generally synonymous with sociology. She had wide-ranging academic interests, including anthropology, [[anthropometry]], [[serology]], [[Indology]] and [[palaeontology]] as well as collecting folk songs and translating [[feminist]] poetry.{{sfnp|Sundar|2007|pp=360-364|ps=}} She was essentially a [[diffusionist]], inspired by several intellectual schools of thought and in some respects emulating the techniques used by [[W. H. R. Rivers]]. These influences included classical Indology, ethnology as practised by bureaucrats of the [[British Raj]] and also German [[eugenics]]-based [[physical anthropology]]. In addition, she had an innate interest in [[fieldwork]].{{sfnp|Sundar|2007|pp=373-380|ps=}} Sundar notes that "as late as 1968 she retained a belief in the importance of mapping social groups like subcastes on the basis of anthropometric and what was then called 'genetic' data (blood group, colour vision, hand-clasping, and hypertrichosis)".{{sfnp|Sundar|2007|p=380|ps=}}

She founded the department of anthropology at what was then Poona University (now the [[University of Pune]]).{{sfnp|Sundar|2007|pp=360-364|ps=}}

Karve served for many years as the head of the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at Deccan College, Pune (University of Pune).{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} She presided over the Anthropology Division of the National Science Congress held in [[New Delhi]] in 1947.{{sfnp|Sundar|2007|pp=360-364|ps=}} She wrote in both [[Marathi language|Marathi]] and English.

== Legacy ==
Sundar says that {{quote|although Karve was very well known in her time, especially in her native Maharashtra, and gets an honourable mention in standard histories of sociology/anthropology, she does not seem to have had a lasting effect on the disciplines in the way of some of her contemporaries.}} She provides various possible reasons why Karve's effect has been less than that of people such as Ghurye and [[Louis Dumont]]. These include her location at an academic centre that carried less prestige than, say, those in [[Delhi]] and [[Bombay]] and because she concentrated on the classical anthropological concern relating to origins at a time when her fellow academics were moving from that to more specialised matters underpinned by [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]]. In addition, her lasting impact may have been affected due to none of her PhD students being able to carry her work forward: unlike, say, Ghurye's students, they failed to establish themselves in academia. There was also the issue of her use of a niche publisher&amp;nbsp;— her employers, Deccan College&amp;nbsp;— for her early works rather than a mainstream academic house such as [[Oxford University Press]], although this may have been imposed upon her.{{sfnp|Sundar|2007|pp=360-364|ps=}}

After Karve's death, [[Durga Bhagwat]], a contemporary Marathi intellectual who had also studied under Ghurye but left the course, wrote a scathing critique of Karve. Sundar summarises this as containing "charges of plagiarism, careerism, manipulation of persons, suppressing the work of others, etc. Whatever the truth of these charges, the essay does Bhagwat little credit."{{sfnp|Sundar|2007|p=374|ps=}}

Although Karve's work on kinship was based on anthropometric and linguistic surveys that are now considered unacceptable, there has been a revival of academic interest in that and some other aspects of her work, such as [[ecology]] and Maharashtrian culture.{{sfnp|Sundar|2007|pp=360-364|ps=}}

Her range of reading was wide, encompassing [[Sanskrit]] epics such as the ''[[Ramayana]]'' to the [[Bhakti movement|Bhakti poets]], [[Oliver Goldsmith]], [[Jane Austen]], [[Albert Camus]] and [[Alistair Maclean]], and her library of books related to academic subjects now forms a part of the collection of Deccan College.{{sfnp|Sundar|2007|p=372|ps=}}

== Works ==
Among Karve's publications are:

*''Kinship Organization in India'' (Deccan College, 1953), a study of various social institutions in India.
*''Hindu Society&amp;nbsp;— an interpretation'' (Deccan College, 1961), a study  of [[Hindu]] society based on data which Karve had collected in her field trips, and her study of pertinent texts in [[Hindi]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Pāli|Pali]] and [[Prakrit]]. In the book, she discussed the pre-[[Aryan]] existence of the [[caste]] system in [[Hinduism]], and traced its development to its present form.
*''Maharashtra&amp;nbsp;— Land and People'' (1968) - describes various social institutions and rituals in Maharashtra.
*''[[Yuganta: The End of an Epoch]]'', a study of the main characters of the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' treats them as historical figures and uses their attitudes and behavior to gain an understanding of the times in which they lived. Karve wrote the book first in Marathi, and later translated it into English. The book won the 1967 [[Sahitya Academy]] Award for best book in Marathi.{{sfnp|Sundar|2007|p=372|ps=}}
*''Paripurti'' (in Marathi)
*''Bhovara'' (in Marathi)
*''Amachi Samskruti'' (in Marathi)
*''Samskruti'' (in Marathi)
*''Gangajal'' (in Marathi)

'''Jacaranda Software''' was an Australian developer and publisher of educational computer games for children. It was based in [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]] and published under the "inspirational" leadership of John Collins. The team worked as a department of Jacaranda-Wiley; the Australian imprint of American publishing company, Wiley. While it was considered initially as an experimental venture, it proved to be profitable from its first year through to its closure in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://playitagainproject.org/companies/jacaranda-software/|title = Jacaranda Software|date = |accessdate = 2015-01-26|website = Play it again...|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacaranda Software released titles for a range of computer systems, including the [[Apple II]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Macintosh]], [[Microbee]] and [[BBC Micro]]. After the department closed, former employees David Smith, Bruce Mitchell, and Steve Luckett continued to write software for schools, under the name [[Greygum Software]]. They bought remaining stock, rights, and equipment from Jacaranda. As of 2015, several popular former Jacaranda titles are still available in Windows and Macintosh versions from Greygum Software, including [[Goldfields (video game)|Goldfields]], [[Kraken: a deep sea quest]], [[Desert Quest]] and [[Crossing the Mountains]].

'''Dame Judith Ann Gladys Kilpatrick''', [[Order of the British Empire|DBE]] (''née'' Foxley) (20 February 1952 – 5 September 2002) was an English head teacher who was noted for her work in the improvements in examination results at the [[Portsmouth Academy|City of Portsmouth Girls' School]] (now Portsmouth Academy) which led to the school acquiring advanced training school status in 2002. She first entered the teaching profession in 1974 at [[Regents Park Community College|Regent Park's Girls School]] and went on to serve as a [[Liaison officer]] for schools in industry for South East Hampshire from 1987 to 1989. Kilpatrick later moved to [[Portsmouth]] where she had the deputy headship of the [[King Richard School]] and was appointed to the post of headmistress for the first time in her career in 1993 at [[The Wavell School]].

She moved back to Portsmouth in 1995 and was appointed the new headmistress of the City of Portsmouth Girls' School and sough to achieve high standards from her students and colleagues. Kilpatrick was instrumental in persuading other schools to share teachers with challenging schools in an effort to improve standards and deliver a high quality education. In her later years, she was a member of various [[quango]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s which included the Home Office Advisory Committee on the Misuse of Drugs and served on the executive council of the [[Training and Development Agency for Schools|Teacher Training Agency]]. Kilpatrick also represented the [[National Association of Head Teachers]] on the Portsmouth educational committee. After her death, she posthumously won a lifetime achievement award and a road was named in her honour

The remainder of Kilpatrick's working life was spent on or near the [[Southern England|South Coast of England]] but did not lose her northern accent.&lt;ref name="ODNBentry" /&gt;

Her first job was as a teacher of English, history and integrated studies at [[Regents Park Community College|Regent Park's Girls School]] from 1974 to 1985. Kilpatrick then completed an additional year as head of careers at the school and later served a stint as a [[liaison officer]] for schools and industry in South East Hampshire between 1987 and 1989.&lt;ref name="ODNBentry" /&gt; She later moved to Portsmouth where she was made the deputy headteacher of the [[King Richard School]] in the city's [[Paulsgrove]] district.&lt;ref name="guardianobituary" /&gt; Kilpatrick's first job as the headmistress of a school came four years later at [[The Wavell School]] in [[Farmborough]]. She married Andrew Kilpatrick, a fellow headteacher, on 22 October 1994, after Andrew divorced.&lt;ref name="ODNBentry" /&gt;

In 1995, Kilpatrick returned to Portsmouth and was appointed the new headmistress of the [[Portsmouth Academy|City of Portsmouth Girls' School]] (now Portsmouth Academy).&lt;ref name="timesobituary" /&gt; There she sought to achieve high standards from her students and colleagues and the school's [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (GCSE) results became the best in the immediate area,&lt;ref name="guardianobituary" /&gt; and better than most schools in the area that struggled with the issues originating from a disadvantaged neighbourhood.&lt;ref name="ODNBentry" /&gt; Kilpatrick was instrumental in persuading other schools to share teachers with challenging schools which was an idea she created to improve standards and deliver a high quality education.&lt;ref name="guardianobituary" /&gt; She supported single-sex education and scorned suggestions that children are less socially developed by going to a same-sex school.&lt;ref name="timesobituary" /&gt;

Her success and work at the school was noticed by the incoming Labour government after the victory in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]].&lt;ref name="timesobituary" /&gt; Good practice in the inner cities was keen to be replicated by the government and singled out the City of Portsmouth Girl's School as their best example. The school was awarded [[Beacon Status]] in 2000 which identified it as "an exceptionally good school" and the award allowed them to exchange their expertise with other schools.&lt;ref name="ODNBentry" /&gt; In June that year, Kilpatrick became the second teacher to become a [[dame]] in the [[Birthday Honours|Queen's Birthday's Honours]] list for "services to education".&lt;ref name="guardianobituary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ltobituary" /&gt;&lt;ref name=bbcnewsdamehood&gt;{{cite news|title=Honours success for education|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/794244.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|date=16 June 2000|accessdate=7 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040731043946/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/794244.stm|archivedate=31 July 2004|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said of the decision to appoint her a DBE,

&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm absolutely thrilled to bits. It reflects well on all my colleagues, and that's the important thing. You don't get these sat in your office, you get them working with colleagues … Schools are about partnerships. It's about trusting your staff. Setting the parameters against which we're going to work, but then trusting people to do that—monitoring, supporting, and generally working with colleagues not above colleagues.&lt;ref name=bbcnewsdamehood/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The City of Portsmouth Girls' School was awarded [[training school]] status in 2001 and was given advanced training school status the following year which recognised its expertise in recruiting and retaining staff through "excellent initial teacher training and continuing professional development".

==History==
[[File:Kathmandu University.jpg|right|thumb|Administration Building, Kathmandu University]]
As a precursor to the establishment of a University, a team of dedicated people first established Kathmandu Valley Campus (a private campus under the affiliation of Tribhuvan University) in 1985 to provide education in the  Intermediate of Science (ISc) level. The same team proposed the establishment of Kathmandu University. After a thorough discussion on the proposal in the Parliament, Kathmandu University was granted by an Act of Parliament on December 11, 1991.

Learning commons may also have tools, equipment, [[makerspace]]s, and/or [[publishing]] services available for borrowing or use. Along with the so-called "bookstore model," which is focused on customer service, [[bookless library|bookless]] or [[digital libraries]], the learning commons or digital commons is frequently cited as a model for the "library of the future."&lt;ref name=redefine&gt;{{cite web|last=Attis|first=David|title=Redefining the academic library: managing the migration to digital information services|url=http://digitalcommons.mcmaster.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=lookingforward|work=Looking forward: reimagining the academic library's role in teaching, learning and research|publisher=McMaster University|accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and Development==
[[File:WikiservicioSpring201501 01.JPG|thumb|Students learning to work with Wikipedia at the learning commons of Tec de Monterrey, Mexico City]]
Learning Commons have developed across the [[United States]] and other countries in [[academic libraries]] since the early 1990s, when they were more frequently called Information Commons. Two early examples were the Information Arcade at the University of Iowa (1992) and the Information Commons at the University of Southern California (1994). By 1999, Donald Beagle had noted its emergence as "...a new model for service delivery in academic libraries," and proposed that the model could be characterized by offering "a continuum of service" from information retrieval to original knowledge creation. This approach, often called "one-stop shopping," could be facilitated, Beagle suggested, though the application of strategic alignment, a management approach adapted from IT enterprise planning.&lt;ref name=conceptualizing&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beagle|first=Donald|title=Conceptualizing an Information Commons|journal=Journal of Academic Librarianship|date=1999|volume=25|issue=2|pages=82–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Increased use of the term Learning Commons had become apparent by 2004, when the University of Southern California hosted a national conference titled "Information Commons: Learning Space Beyond the Classroom." Beagle's white paper for this conference proposed a developmental pathway "From Information Commons to Learning Commons," based on a typology of change adapted from research by the [[American Council on Education]]. This white paper defined an Information Commons as a library-centric "...cluster of network access points and associated IT tools situated in the context of physical, digital, human, and social resources organized in support of learning.” A Learning Commons, by contrast, was no longer library-centric, as  “…when the resources of the information commons are organized in collaboration with learning initiatives sponsored by other academic units, or aligned with learning outcomes defined through a cooperative process.”&lt;ref name="ic to lc"&gt;{{cite web|last=Beagle|first=Donald|title=From Information Commons to Learning Commons|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263444112_From_Information_Commons_to_Learning_Commons_A_White_Paper_for_Presentation_at_the_University_of_Southern_California_Leavey_Library_Conference Leavey Library Conference|publisher=University of Southern California |date=2004 |accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These definitions were later adopted and elaborated upon by [[Scott Bennett (librarian)|Scott Bennett]], Yale University Librarian Emeritus.&lt;ref name="bennett ic lc"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bennett|first=Scott|title=The Information or the Learning Commons: Which Will We Have?|journal=Journal of Academic Librarianship|date=2008|volume=34|issue=3|pages=183–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the late 1990s, hundreds of Learning Commons have developed and morphed in response to [[Web 2.0]] technologies and the continuous evolution of libraries and librarians’ functions.  [[Web 2.0]] technologies such as [[blogs]], [[social networking]] sites, [[video sharing]] sites and [[web apps]], have radically impacted the way that information is exchanged and engaged in.  A learning commons takes these technologies into consideration and then adapts to provide the best possible services to the new 2.0 users and students. A driving force for the institution to place various services in the library are caused by two major reasons.  The first reason is the reduction of space used to house print materials which are of little use to students and faculty compared to digital resources rapidly accessible through internet based services. The second reason for learning commons advances is the prime location on campus that most libraries have managed to secure. The library often frees up space through weeding of the print collections. A synergistic service can develop in support of students with other service departments.

==Why a Learning Commons==

Students appear to have natural abilities to use emerging technology. But
the reality is, while students easily grasp the entertainment and
communication value of the devices they use, they need to be taught how
these tools can be used in learning and critical thought. This is a task for
the Learning Commons.

There is growing consensus among educators that students need to learn
transferable skills in order to work efficiently and successfully in our future
world.&lt;ref name="accessola.com"&gt;https://www.accessola.org/web/Documents/OLA/Divisions/OSLA/TogetherforLearning.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

To achieve this, students will need to become critical consumers of
information, effective problem solvers, capable decision makers and
innovative communicators as well. They will require the skills and ability to
flow with change. And most of all, students will need to understand that
these transferable skills give them the capacity to make a difference in this
world… personally.&lt;ref name="accessola.com"/&gt;

A Learning Commons provides boundless opportunity for growth. It is
based on a cross-curricular perspective that recognizes literacy, numeracy,
knowledge, thinking, communication, and application as foundations for
learning how to learn.&lt;ref name="accessola.com"/&gt;

A Learning Commons becomes the physical and virtual catalyst where
inquiry, imagination, discovery, and creativity come alive and become
central to growth — personal, academic, social and cultural.&lt;ref name="accessola.com"/&gt;

==The Role of Differentiated Instruction==

An effective Learning Commons will accommodate all learners and address multiple learning styles and learning levels.
In working together, teacher-librarians in partnership with others can modify the process, content, product and environment to meet the needs of a diverse student population. The result will be empowered learners.  The learning commons model creates an ideal environment for the teacher librarian to utilize teaching methods that allow for both formal and informal learning to take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loertscher|first1=D|title=Makers, Self-Directed Learners, and the Library Learning Commons|journal=Teacher Librarian|date=2014|volume=41|issue=5|pages=35–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Learning Commons, Student Services, and the Institution==
A learning commons allows for academic libraries to provide wider ranging and more cohesive services to students and users.  Meshing numerous services maintains the traditional reference and research elements of the classic library while adding exciting new services that support new technologies and service in a larger and more integrated environment.&lt;ref name="Holly"&gt;Heitsch, Elizabeth K. &amp; Holley, Robert P. (2011): The Information and Learning Commons: Some Reflections, New Review of Academic Librarianship, 17:1, 64-77
from library to learning commons: a metamorphosis&lt;/ref&gt; The learning commons reflects a marked shift in our conception of the library, a shift that is driven by our evolving understanding of the library’s role in supporting student learning.&lt;ref name="Holmgren" /&gt; The emergence of the learning commons as a central element in contemporary library design offers an opportunity to transform the library’s role on campus from a provider of information to a facilitator of learning.&lt;ref name="Holmgren"&gt;Holmgren, Richard A. (2010): Learning Commons: A Learning-Centered Library Design, College &amp; Undergraduate Libraries, 17:2-3, 177-191&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, libraries and learning commons share responsibility for delivering college-wide outcomes: developing effective research strategies, finding and evaluating the appropriateness of resource materials for a particular topic, honing effective oral and written communication skills, and promoting good study and learning habits.&lt;ref name="Holmgren" /&gt;  The goal of a Learning Commons Librarians’ work should be to encourage all students to engage in substantive ways with multiple services in the organization.&lt;ref name="Holmgren" /&gt;  Properly implemented in an academic library, this model of library service benefits all parts of the institution.  A cohesiveness and purpose among the diverse elements of the library allows both the library and the school to run more smoothly and efficiently and students’ needs are met in an environment that is designed to provide multiple services in a single location.&lt;ref name="Holly" /&gt;

==The Digital Divide and Learning Commons==
The [[Digital Divide]] is a very real problem in academic libraries currently and will remain so for the foreseeable future.  This can be a problem in a highly technological library model but when the learning commons work efficiently, the needs of these students are provided for through library orientations, research/reference classes, technology courses, one-on-one assistance, effective and in-library peer assistance.  These services should be developed online as well as in person for the maximum benefit of the student user and the school.&lt;ref name="Holly" /&gt;

==Importance of Physical Space==
New or renovated library space is now commonly repurposed to bring students together to work, study, and socialize.  The learning commons typically offer comfortable furniture for both individual and group study, modular furnishings that allow users to customize the environment to suit their needs, access to wireless networks and electrical outlets, multimedia labs and support, and often a cafe accompanied by relaxed food and drink restrictions.  The Learning Commons seeks to expand and integrate the real and virtual choices learners have to share their experiences. Safe, inclusive and
welcoming environments throughout a school are imperative to meet the diverse abilities and learning styles of individuals, teams and groups. Virtual learning spaces increase this potential.

==Learning Commons promotes Inquiry Based Learning==
Through the process of inquiry, individuals construct much of their understanding of the natural and human-designed worlds. Inquiry implies a "need or want to know" premise. Inquiry is not so much seeking the right answer—because often there is none—but rather seeking appropriate resolutions to questions and issues. For educators, inquiry implies emphasis on the development of inquiry skills and the nurturing of inquiring attitudes or habits of mind that will enable individuals to continue the quest for knowledge throughout life.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thirteen.org/edonline/concept2class/inquiry/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges to Learning Commons==

The challenge is discovering how to reconfigure our current spaces both inside and beyond a school and a school library’s walls to reflect this new reality. Access to the technology that makes it possible, obviously, is critical

==Role of the School Library==
The school library, a key component of a Learning Commons, has an
integral and transformative role to play in implementing this fresh and
innovative vision for education.

Every member of a school’s population will ultimately participate in the
creation of a Learning Commons, but the concept’s early coordination and
leadership will rest with school library expertise.

Where properly developed, a school’s library is already the hub for
networking and information access. As the Learning Commons’ concept
grows, a school library’s collection-based facilities will continuously change
and expand, creating access-based services suited to a school community’s
needs.

This process will mean changes in the operations of a school’s library.
Resource collections will need to be reshaped even more rapidly and readily
than they are currently to reflect their communities as well as the world at
large. It is the only way a library’s access to the global, interconnected and
interactive communication networks of the future.&lt;ref name="accessola.com"/&gt;

A '''liberal education''' is a system or course of education suitable for the cultivation of a [[Freedom (philosophy)|free]] (Latin: ''liber'') human being. It is based on the [[Medieval university|medieval]] concept of the [[liberal arts]] or, more commonly now, the [[liberalism]] of the [[Age of Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Liberal Arts Education|url=http://ls.berkeley.edu/about-college/liberal-arts-education|accessdate=9 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215125841/http://ls.berkeley.edu/about-college/liberal-arts-education|archivedate=15 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been described as "a philosophy of education that empowers individuals with broad knowledge and transferable skills, and a stronger sense of values, ethics, and civic engagement ... characterised by challenging encounters with important issues, and more a way of studying than a specific course or field of study" by the [[Association of American Colleges and Universities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Liberal Education?|url=http://www.aacu.org/resources/liberaleducation/index.cfm|publisher=Association of American Colleges &amp; Universities|accessdate=May 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Usually global and [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralistic]] in scope, it can include a general education [[curriculum]] which provides broad exposure to multiple disciplines and learning strategies in addition to in-depth study in at least one [[Academia|academic]] area.

Liberal education was advocated in the 19th century by thinkers such as [[John Henry Newman]], [[Thomas Huxley]], and [[Frederick Denison Maurice|F. D. Maurice]].
[[Wilfred Griffin Eady|Sir Wilfred Griffin Eady]] defined liberal education as being education for its own sake and personal enrichment, with the teaching of values.&lt;ref name=Harrison&gt;[[J. F. C. Harrison]] (1954); ''A History of the Working Men's College (1854–1954)'', p. 191; Routledge Kegan Paul. {{ISBN|0-415-43221-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decline of liberal education is often attributed to mobilization during the Second World War. The premium and emphasis placed upon mathematics, science, and technical training caused the loss of its prominent position in higher education studies. However, it became central to much undergraduate education in the United States in the mid-20th century, being conspicuous in the movement for 'general education'.

==Definition==
The [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] describes a liberal education in this way: "Ideally, a liberal education produces persons who are open-minded and free from provincialism, dogma, preconception, and ideology; conscious of their opinions and judgments; reflective of their actions; and aware of their place in the social and natural worlds."{{sfn|Project on Liberal Education and the Sciences|1990|p=xi}} Liberally educated people are skeptical of their own traditions; they are trained to think for themselves rather than conform to higher authorities.{{sfn|Nussbaum|2009|p=10}}

It also cultivates "active citizenship" through off-campus community service, internships, research, and study abroad.{{sfn|Freeland|2009|pp=6–8}} Some faculty see this movement towards "civic engagement" as more pedagogically powerful than traditional classroom teaching, but opponents argue that the education occurring within an academic institution must be purely intellectual and scholarly.{{sfn|Freeland|2009|pp=10–11}}

A liberal education combines an education in the [[classics]], [[English literature]], the [[humanities]], and moral virtues.{{sfn|Van Doren|1943|p=43}} The term ''liberal education'' in the modern sense should not be confused with ''[[liberal arts education]]''; the latter deals with academic subjects, while the former deals with ideological subjects. Indeed, a liberal arts education does not necessarily include a liberal education, and a liberal arts program may even be as specialized as a vocational program.{{sfn|Shoenberg|2009|p=56}} For practical purposes, liberal education is not actually differentiated from liberal arts education today, except by scholars.

Unlike a professional and vocational education that prepares students for their careers, a liberal education prepares students to utilize their leisure time. Such an education helps the individual navigate internal and external conflicts in life. For example, a liberal education aims to help students be self-conscious and aware of their actions and motivations. Individuals also become more considerate for other beliefs and cultures. According to James Engel, the author of ''The Value of a Liberal Arts Education'', ''"A liberal education provides the framework for an educated and thoughtful citizen."''{{sfn|The Value of a Liberal Arts Education||}}

==History==
Definitions of a liberal education may be broad, generalized, and sometimes even contradictory.{{sfn|Axelrod|Anisef|Lin|2001|p=52}} "It is at once the most enduring and changeable of academic traditions."{{sfn|Axelrod|Anisef|Lin|2001|p=50}} Axelrod, Anisef, and Lin suggest that conceptions of liberal education are rooted in the teaching methods of [[Ancient Greece]],{{sfn|Axelrod|Anisef|Lin|2001|p=50}} a slave-owning community divided between slaves and freemen. The freemen, mostly concerned about their rights and obligations as citizens, received a non-specialized, non-vocational, [[liberal arts]] education that produced well-rounded citizens aware of their place in society. At the same time, [[Socrates]] emphasized the importance of [[individualism]], impressing upon his students the duty of man to form his own opinions through reason rather than indoctrination. [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] education also provided a balance between developing the mind and the body. Another possibility is that liberal education dates back to the [[Zhou Dynasty]], where the teachings of [[Confucianism]] focused on propriety, morality, and social order. Hoerner{{who|date=January 2015}} also suggests that [[Jesus]] was a liberal educator, as "he was talking of a free man capable of thinking for himself and of being a responsible citizen," but liberal education is still commonly traced back to the Greeks.{{sfn|Valerio, Jim Ellis|1970|pp=2–3}}

While liberal education was stifled during the barbarism of the [[Early Middle Ages]], it rose to prominence once again in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, especially with the re-emergence of [[Aristotelian philosophy]]. The thirteenth and fourteenth centuries saw a revolt against narrow spirituality and educators started to focus on the human, rather than God. This [[humanism|humanist]] approach favored reason, nature and aesthetics.{{sfn|Hoerner|1970|pp=4–6}}

Study of the [[Classics]] and [[humanities]] slowly returned in the fourteenth century, which led to increased study of both [[Greek language|Ancient Greek]] and [[Latin]]. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, liberal education focused mostly on the classics. Commoners, however, were not too keen on studying the classics, so they instead took up vernacular languages and literature, and also the sciences. Until at least the twentieth century, both humanist and classicist influences remained in the liberal education, and proponents of a [[progressive education]] also embraced the humanist philosophy. Study of the classics continued in the form of the [[Great Books]] program.{{sfn|Hoerner|1970|pp=7–8}} [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]] brought this program to the [[University of Chicago]]. Upon Hutchins' resignation, the university got rid of the program, but an adapted version still exists at [[Shimer College]].

While liberal education is a Western movement, it has been influential in other regions as well. For example, in Japan during the general liberalism of the [[Taishō period]], there was a liberal education movement that saw the establishment of a number of schools based on liberal education in the 1920s – see [[:ja:大正自由教育運動|大正自由教育運動]].

==Relationship with professional education==
Liberal education and professional education have often been seen as divergent. [[German universities]] moved towards more professional teaching in the nineteenth century, and unlike American students, who still pursued a liberal education, students elsewhere started to take professional courses in the first or second year of study.{{sfn|Ofer|2007|p=47}} In the early twentieth century, [[American liberal arts colleges]] still required students to pursue a common curriculum, whereas public universities allowed a student to move on to more pragmatic courses after having taken general education courses for the first two years of study. As an emphasis on specialized knowledge grew in the middle of the century, colleges began to adjust the proportion of required general education courses to those required for a particular major.{{sfn|Fong|2004|pp=8–9}}

As [[University of Chicago]] professor [[Martha Nussbaum]] points out, standardized testing has placed more emphasis on honing technical knowledge, and its quantitative, multiple-choice nature prompts rote learning in the classroom. At the same time, humanistic concepts such as imagination and critical thinking, which cannot be tested by such methods, are disappearing from college curricula.{{sfn|Nussbaum|2009|p=13}}

Thirty percent of college graduates in the United States are likely to eventually work in jobs that do not exist yet.{{sfn|Fong|2004|p=9}} Proponents of a liberal education therefore argue that a postsecondary education must prepare students for an increasingly complex labor market. Rather than provide narrowly designed technical courses, a liberal education would foster critical thinking and analytical skills that allow the student to adapt to a rapidly changing workforce.{{sfn|Geary Schneider|2009}} The movement towards career-oriented courses within a liberal education has begun at places like [[Dartmouth College]], where a journalism course combines lessons on writing style with reading and analyzing historical journalism.{{sfn|Jaschik|2004}} An American survey of CEOs published in 1997 revealed that employers were more focused on the long-term outcomes of education, such as adaptability, than college students and their parents, who were more concerned with the short-term outcomes of getting a job.{{sfn|Axelrod|Anisef|Lin|2001|p=56}}

==Provision==
Ronel B. Esquivel said only eight percent of colleges provide a liberal education to four percent of students in the United States.{{sfn|Shoenberg|2009|p=59}} Liberal education revived three times in the United States during periods of industrialization and shifts of social preoccupations—before [[World War I]], after [[World War II]], and in the late 1970s—perhaps as a reaction against overspecialization in undergraduate curricula.{{sfn|Xin|2004|p=1}}

Currently, pressures from employers, parents and governments have defined the type of education offered at educational institutions. Such trends have curtailed the role of education offered in America. Universities have now provided education for the sole purpose to prepare students for the workforce. This idea has negatively influenced the credibility of liberal education which has impacted how students view higher education. The negative impact being a focus on specific disciplinary practices separating it from the original ideology of liberal education as a "...a philosophy of education that empowers individuals with broad knowledge and transferable skills, and a stronger sense of values, ethics, and civic engagement ..." {{sfn|"The parent factor: how parents view their school-aged children's options for college."||}} Politicians have influenced the type of education provided at universities. These politicians have been recently cutting the funds for universities applying immense pressure on higher educational institutions. Lack of funds have caused many to abandon the liberal arts curricula. Therefore, universities have been forced to provide a curriculum useful for providing a vocational education. The lack of funds to maintain a balanced education system has caused American universities to provide an education with a lack of emphasis on liberal values.{{sfn| Kiener Robert|2013|p=63-64}}

The disappearance of liberal education can also be traced to Liberal Art Colleges. Students are beginning to view higher education as a preparation for careers. This has then led to the natural selection of colleges. Obviously, the thought of having education that instructs to enhance the individual for the purpose of improving society does not meet current demands. Thus, as a result, Liberal Art Colleges are diminishing along with the emphasis on providing a liberal education. .{{sfn|Di Leo|2011|pp=1-2}}

Chinese universities began to implement liberal curricula between the 1920s and 1940s, but shifted to specialized education upon the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949. Higher education reform in the 1990s returned to liberal education. In 2000 [[Peking University]] started to offer a liberal education curriculum to its undergraduate students, followed by other institutions throughout the country.{{sfn|Xin|2004|pp=1–2}}

Some of the universities in [[India]] have started offering Liberal Arts Education. [[Ahmedabad University]] is one such young university which offers students a&amp;nbsp;[[Liberal arts education|liberal education]]&amp;nbsp;focused on research and interdisciplinary learning.

Born Rabindranath Kaul, in [[Jodhpur]], Rajasthan, in a [[Kashmiri Pandit]] family,&lt;ref name=guard&gt;{{cite web| title = Mani Kaul obituary|publisher= The Guardian|author=Derek Malcolm|authorlink=Derek Malcolm|date=14 July 2011|url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jul/14/mani-kaul-obituary| accessdate = 2013-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jag&gt;{{cite web| title = Filmmaker Mani Kaul passes away after prolonged illness| url = http://post.jagran.com/filmmaker-mani-kaul-passes-away-after-prolonged-illness-1309944386|publisher=[[Dainik Jagran]], Jagran Post|date=6 July 2011| accessdate = 2013-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaul first joined FTII, Pune as an acting student and later shifted to the direction course, where noted film director Ritwik Ghatak was a teacher, graduating in 1966.&lt;ref name=upst&gt;{{cite web |title=Profile |url=http://www.upperstall.com/people/mani-kaul |publisher=[[upperstall.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=January 2012}}

He was the nephew of actor-director Mahesh Kaul, who made films like [[Raj Kapoor]] starrer ''[[Sapno Ka Saudagar]]'' (1968).&lt;ref name=upst/&gt;

==Career==
His first film ''[[Uski Roti]]'' (1969) has been described as "one of the key films of the New Indian Cinema or the Indian New Wave".&lt;ref name=upst&gt;{{cite web |title=Profile |url=http://www.upperstall.com/people/mani-kaul |publisher=[[upperstall.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = ‘Mani Kaul’s films didn’t come to you, you had to go to them’|publisher=Indian Express| url = http://www.indianexpress.com/news/-Mani-Kaul-s-films-didn-t-come-to-you--you-had-to-go-to-them-/817832/|date=16 July 2011| accessdate = 2013-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It marked a drastic departure from earlier Indian cinema technique, form and narrative. It was one of the early formal experimental films in Indian cinema.

''[[Ashadh Ka Ek Din]]'' (1971), his next film, was based on a play by [[Mohan Rakesh]].

''[[Duvidha]]'', his third film, was his first in colour. It grew out of a short story by [[Vijaydan Detha]] and tells the story of a merchant's son, who returns with his new bride. When he departs on a business trip, a ghost falls in love with the wife. It was widely shown across Europe. He was awarded the prestigious [[Jawaharlal Nehru Fellowship]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Official list of Jawaharlal Nehru Fellows (1969-present)|work = [[Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund]] | url = http://www.jnmf.in/flist.html  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Kaul was one of the co-founders of the Yukt Film Co-operative (Union of Kinematograph Technicians) in 1976, leading to avant-garde films. Critics&lt;ref name=upst/&gt; opined in "Mani Kaul's cinematic conception, fiction and documentary films have no clear demarcated dividing line." He also taught music in the Netherlands, and was Creative Director of the film house at Osian's Connoisseurs of Art, Mumbai.

In 1971, he was a member of the jury at the [[21st Berlin International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="berlinale 1971"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1971/04_jury_1971/04_Jury_1971.html |title=Berlinale 1971: Juries |accessdate=13 March 2010 |work=berlinale.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a visiting lecturer at [[Harvard University]] for the 2000–2001 school year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=103655|title=The Harvard Crimson:: Indie Film Director to Teach VES Course}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Mani Kaul died on 6 July 2011 at his home in [[Gurgaon]], near Delhi, after prolonged battle with cancer.&lt;ref name=jag/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Filmmaker Mani Kaul dead |url=http://www.thehindu.com/arts/cinema/article2163928.ece |work=The Hindu |location=India |date=6 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Docuwallahs06Jul2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://movies.groups.yahoo.com/group/docuwallahs2/message/9878|title=Mani Kaul no more|date=6 July 2011|work=Docuwallahs2|accessdate=6 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710003636/http://movies.groups.yahoo.com/group/docuwallahs2/message/9878|archivedate=10 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is survived by two sons and two daughters.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt;

==Tribute==
According to a tribute&lt;ref name="Docuwallahs06Jul2011" /&gt; from Prabha Mahajan on the Indian documentary film discussion network Docuwallahs2 [https://groups.yahoo.com/group/docuwallahs2], Mani Kaul's significant body of work included both feature films and documentaries. In an interview Mani stated: "The dividing line from my films and documentaries is thin. Some of my films like ''[[Siddheshwari]]'' are like poetic documentaries." Mani Kaul's fellow alumni from [[Film and Television Institute of India|FTII]] intend to put together a collective tribute to Mani Kaul and his work, and interested persons were invited to send in their thoughts on Mani as a film maker, teacher/ mentor, colleague, and as a person.

Indian film critic [[Khalid Mohamed]] commented,&lt;ref name="Deccan Chronicle - 07Jul2011 - Mani Kaul no more"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/editorial/dc-comment/determined-outsider-183|title=The determined outsider|date=7 July 2011|work=Deccan Chronicle |location=India|accessdate=6 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "As a film director, he discussed the status of women (''[[Uski Roti]]'', ''[[Duvidha]]''), crafted visually seductive documentaries (''Arrival'', ''Before My Eyes'', ''A Desert of a Thousand Lines'') and went through a spell of interpreting [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]’s masterworks. The Russian writer’s short story ''A Gentle Creature'' inspired ''[[Nazar (1991 film)|Nazar]]'', shot in low, chiaroscuro lighting."

The '''Microtraining''' method is an approach aimed at supporting [[informal learning]] processes in organizations and companies. Learning in this sense means that an active process of knowledge creation is taking place within [[social interaction]]s, but outside of [[formal learning]] environments or training facilities. This process can be facilitated by well-designed and structured systems and by supporting ways of communication and collaboration, like the Microtraining method does. A Microtraining arrangement comprises a time span of 15–20 minutes for each learning session, which can activate and maintain learning processes for a longer period if bundled into series. A Microtraining session can be held face-to-face, online or embedded in an [[e-learning]] scenario.

==Applicability==
The Microtraining method can be applied to learning situations within [[organization]]s and [[Company|companies]], especially when basic knowledge needs to be refreshed or improved and when information is needed for immediate use in daily practice. In comparison to formal learning, Microtraining is an approach aimed at structuring informal learning activities. While formal learning may be a successful approach for people with less knowledge and skills [Tynjälä, 2008], it can be counter-productive for more experienced employees [Jonassen et al., 1993] for whom informal blended learning approaches like Microtraining appear to be working very well [Jonassen/Mayes/McAleese, 1993; Jonassen, 1997].

==Organizational requirements==
With regard to organizational requirements, facilitating the new learning concept by [[management]] and accompanying the initial phase of implementing the Microtraining method are crucial for its success. Consequently, the Microtraining method is not meant to be an approach to designing learning materials alone, but involves analyzing learning processes in organizations and supporting change management of learning strategies as a whole. If, for example, employees have insufficient access to a computer or web services supporting [[E-learning|online learning]] activities that are part of the Microtraining approach or if they are not allowed to spend working time learning, any effort to design the best material and collaborative surroundings will fail.

==Didactical principles==
The Microtraining method is based on several current learning theories and concepts, one of the most important of which is the theory of [[Social constructivism|Social Constructivism]], which sees learning as an active process, taking into account the learner's individual background [Vygotsky, 1978]. The second crucial idea comes from the concept of [[connectivism]], which states that learning is not an internal, solitary process, but that new knowledge is acquired best while working and learning in a lively community [Siemens, 2005].

==The method==
Microtraining sessions are structured as follows:

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Microtraining session structure.png]] --&gt;

1 Active start (3 minutes)
* Start with a mental activity e.g. thinking, reflecting, organizing and comparing
* Communicate the goal of the session

2 Exercise / Demonstration (6 minutes)
* Connect with different learning styles by using a combination of pictures, sounds and text.
* Stimulate the learning process by giving concrete examples

3 Feedback/ Discussion (4 minutes)
* Ensure effective, direct and positive feedback
* Stimulate both discussion and knowledge sharing between participants
* Check if all participants really understand the content by asking questions

4 Conclusion: What's next? How do we learn more? (2 minutes)
* What are the topics we will discuss during the next meeting(s)
* Discuss how to retain the knowledge
* Stimulate involvement and ensure participants leave with a clear goal

The '''Museum of Comparative Zoology''', full name "The Louis Agassiz Museum of Comparative Zoology", often abbreviated simply to "MCZ", is the [[zoology]] museum located on the grounds of [[Harvard University]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. It is one of three natural history research museums at Harvard whose public face is the [[Harvard Museum of Natural History]]. Harvard MCZ's collections consist of some 21 million specimens, of which several thousand are on rotating display at the public museum.  The current director of the Museum of Comparative Zoology is [[James Hanken]], the Louis Agassiz Professor of Zoology at Harvard University.

Many of the exhibits in the public museum have not only zoological interest but also historical significance. Past exhibits have included a [[fossil]] [[sand dollar]] which was found by [[Charles Darwin]] in 1834, Captain Cook's [[mamo]], and two [[pheasant]]s that once belonged to [[George Washington]], now on loan to Mount Vernon in Virginia.

The Harvard Museum of Natural History is physically connected to the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology]]; for visitors, one admission ticket grants access to both museums. The research collections of the Museum of Comparative Zoology are not open to the public.

==History==
The Museum of Comparative Zoology was founded in 1859 through the efforts of zoologist [[Louis Agassiz]], and the museum used to be referred to as "The Agassiz" after its founder.&lt;ref&gt;Winsor, Mary P. [https://books.google.com/books?id=w6vLeToUzHEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=reading+the+shape+of+nature&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj7qvSLpLfZAhWFPN8KHUbnBN4Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=reading%20the%20shape%20of%20nature&amp;f=false Reading the Shape of Nature: Comparative Zoology at the Agassiz Museum] (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;  Agassiz designed the collection to illustrate the variety and [[Comparative anatomy|comparative relationships]] of [[animal]] life.

The [[Radcliffe Zoological Laboratory]] was created in 1894 when [[Radcliffe College]] rented a space on the fifth floor of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University to convert into a women's laboratory. Prior to this acquisition, Radcliffe science laboratories were taught using inadequate facilities, converting spaces such as bathrooms in old houses into physics laboratories, which Harvard professors often refused to teach in&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=HUL Access/2.0|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/doi/10.1111/1468-0424.12292/abstract|doi=10.1111/1468-0424.12292/epdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;.The laboratory space was converted from an office or storage closet, and was sandwiched between other invertebrate storage rooms on the fifth floor.

==Departments==
The museum comprises twelve departments: [[Biological Oceanography]], [[Entomology]], [[Herpetology]], [[Ichthyology]], [[Invertebrate paleontology|Invertebrate Paleontology]], [[Invertebrate zoology|Invertebrate Zoology]], [[Mammalogy]], [[Marine invertebrates]], [[Malacology]], [[Ornithology]], [[Population Genetics]], and [[Vertebrate Paleontology]].  The [[Ernst Mayr|Ernst Mayr Library]] and its archives join in supporting the work of the museum.  The Ernst Mayr Library is a founding member of the [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org Biodiversity Heritage Library].

==Publications==
The museum publishes two journals: the ''Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard College'', first published in 1869,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard College|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/2803|website=Biodiversity Heritage Library|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Breviora'', first published in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breviora|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/3989|website=Biodiversity Heritage Library|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Displays==
In contrast to numerous more modern museums, the Harvard Museum of Natural History has many hundreds of [[taxidermy|stuffed animals]] on display, from the collections of the Museum of Comparative Zoology.  Notable exhibits include [[whale]] [[skeleton]]s, the largest [[turtle]] [[Animal shell|shell]] ever found (eight feet long), "the Harvard [[mastodon]]", a {{convert|42|ft|m|sing=on}} long ''[[Kronosaurus]]'' skeleton, the skeleton of a [[dodo]], and a [[coelacanth]] preserved in fluid. The two-story Great Mammal Hall was renovated in 2009 in celebration of the 150th anniversary of founding of the Museum of Comparative Zoology.

New and changing exhibitions in the Harvard Museum of Natural History include "Evolution" (2008); "The Language of Color" (2008 to 2013); "Arthropods: Creatures that Rule" (2006); "New England Forests" (2011); and "Mollusks: Shelled Masters of the Marine Realm" (2012).

'''NUGS''',officially The '''National Union of Ghana Students''' is the largest [[student organization]] in [[Ghana]]. https://nugsonline.org.gh/about-us/ However the date of it foundation has been the subject of controversy.

He says he was preceded by P.D. Vanderpuije of the [[Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology|University of Science and Technology]] (UST) and followed by Mr. F.Y.I. Fiagbe, also of the UST. He further claims that both he and Fiagbe, along with Antwi (the General Secretary at the time), Mr. Easmon and Mr. Kodwo Carr were all arrested and imprisoned without trial under the [[Preventive Detention Act]].&lt;ref name="Sarfo"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sarfo|first1=Samuel Adjei|title=Prof. Justice Kludze’s Take on Nkrumah’s Dictatorship.

'''Perdana Leadership Foundation''' ({{lang-ms|'''Yayasan Kepimpinan Perdana'''}}) is a foundation established to preserve, develop and spread information regarding former [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Ministers]] of [[Malaysia]]. The foundation's main aim is to increase awareness of Malaysia's intellectual heritage based on its belief that past leadership can provide important resources and insights for future development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perdana.org.my/about-us/our-history Perdana Leadership Foundation] Retrieved 16 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of its objectives is to initiate greater understanding and co-operation between the world's [[cultures]], [[religions]] and ways of life, while inspiring a positive change in the values of [[Malaysia]]ns throughout the world.

Established in early 2003, the idea was mooted by Mathias Chang, Political Secretary to the Prime Minister and was well accepted by the government and private sectors. Thus, a special trust committee was formed with members mostly from private sector and headed by  Tan Sri Datuk Seri Azizan Zainul Abidin (President, Putrajaya Corporation; President, [[Petronas]]) to materialize this idea. The Foundation was launched by Prime Minister, Datuk Seri [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]] on 10 May 2005. Before that, Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad launched the Perdana Library on 29 April 2004.

== Objectives ==
Objectives of Perdana Leadership Foundation:

* To research, document, disseminate and publicise the intellectual legacies of Malaysia’s past prime ministers.
* To elucidate and illuminate the contribution of Malaysia’s past Prime Ministers in the social, economic and political development of the nation.
* To create awareness of the development process of the nation and serve as a platform for future development.
* To be a resource centre of policies, strategies and initiatives that were adopted under Malaysia’s various prime ministers which may be used and adapted as models for the development of other nations.

The Foundation’s broader objective is to promote global understanding by providing a channel for scholars and thinkers to undertake research and idea-sharing.

== Administration ==
Its Honorary President is the current seventh prime minister, Tun Dr [[Mahathir Mohamad]]. The foundation also has a Board of Trustees, chaired by Tan Sri Dato' Azman Hashim, whose members are prominent figures in the banking, education and property sectors. Day-to-day management is headed by Tan Sri Datuk Nik Mohamed Nik Yaacob formerly the CEO of Sime Darby Berhad.

== Library ==
The Foundation operates a physical and digital library, the Perdana Library which provides direct access to a wealth of information on Malaysia's past Prime Ministers. The Library collects, organises, preserves and disseminates materials by and about Malaysia's national leaders and events connected to them, and outlines the policies, strategies and initiatives they adopted. In line with the Foundation's objective of disseminating information on Malaysian leadership, these materials are digitised and are made available to the public through the Internet. To date, the Foundation has close to 10,000 items in its physical collections (including photos and audio video materials) and more than three hundred and thirty thousand records in its digital collections. Some of the Library's resources can be accessed for free [http://library.perdana.org.my/cgi-bin/gw_43_0/chameleon via the Foundation's website] while others are available only to members.

== Digital Preservation Initiative ==
The Foundation actively digitises materials connected to the leadership history of the country. These materials include speeches, books, news clippings, magazine articles, videos and audio tapes. It collaborates with the National Archives and the National Library to digitise these institutions' holdings (with a copy handed back to the source institution) and seeks to take this initiative nationwide to centralise and digitise materials of historical import. To date, the Foundation has digitised more than three hundred thirty thousand documents, equivalent to more than eight million pages, consisting of speeches of former PMs, news clippings, journal articles, and Parliamentary Hansards. In terms of technology, the Foundation has invested in a book scanning machine, OCR software and [http://www.perdana.org.my/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=338:new-straits-times&amp;catid=57:plfinthenews&amp;Itemid=151 an upgraded search engine] to enable more efficient research.

== Building ==
The building is located at Precinct 8, [[Putrajaya]]. This building is equipped with facilities such as a Library (Perdana Library), auditorium, meeting rooms, administrative offices and a banquet hall.

'''Platon Constantinovich Karsavin''' ({{lang-ru|Платон Константинович Карсавин}}; November 17, 1854, [[Saint Petersburg]] – 1922, [[Saint Petersburg]]) was a dancer with the [[Russian Imperial Ballet]] in St Petersburg, and afterwards a teacher of dance.

==Biography==
Platon Constantinovich Karsavin was born on 17 November 1854, at St Petersburg. His father had been a provincial actor, but had three children, and to feed his family, had become a tailor and moved to St. Petersburg. When Platon was 6 years old, his father died. The family was again left without money. Therefore, he and his brother Vladimir were placed in the [[Saint Petersburg State Theatre Arts Academy|Imperial Theatre School]] - where children lived and learned free, supported by the imperial treasury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://baza.vgd.ru/18/73930/ ru: Biography of Tamara Karsavina]&lt;/ref&gt; A teacher of Platon Karsavin were [[Marius Petipa]] and [[Christian Johansson]].

After Theatre School (in 1875) Platon Karsavin was admitted as a dancer at the [[Mariinsky Theatre]]. There he worked from 1875 to 1891. He danced in the ballets of [[Arthur Saint-Léon]], [[Marius Petipa]] and [[Lev Ivanov]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pro-ballet.ru/html/k/karsavin.html ru: Karsavin in the Ballet Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing his career of ballet dancer, he became a teacher at the [[Saint Petersburg State Theatre Arts Academy|Imperial choreographic school]]. Among his pupils were [[Michel Fokine]], [[Alexander Alexeyevich Gorsky|Alexander Gorskiy]], [[Adolph Bolm]], [[Vasily Tikhomirov]], [[Alexandr Monakhov]], Alexandr Chekrygin, [[Alexandr Shiryayev]] ([[Cesare Pugni]]’grandson) etc.

He died in 1922 at St Petersburg.

==Family==
* His wife, Anna Khomiakova, was the daughter of a cousin of the philosopher [[Aleksey Khomyakov]].
Their children:
* [[Lev Platonovich Karsavin]] (1882–1952) was a religious philosopher, poet, and historian of European culture, a professor at [[St. Petersburg University]], was expelled from Russia in 1922, taught at [[Vilnius University]], Lithuania (1928-1939); was arrested by [[Joseph Stalin]]’s regime and died in 1952 in a prison camp.
* [[Tamara Karsavina]] (1885–1978) was a famous Russian ballerina.

The '''School Mathematics Study Group (SMSG)''' was an American academic [[think tank]] focused on the subject of reform in [[mathematics education]].  Directed by [[Edward G. Begle]] and financed by the [[National Science Foundation]], the group was created in the wake of the [[Sputnik crisis]] in 1958 and tasked with creating and implementing [[mathematics]] [[curriculum|curricula]] for [[primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education]], which it did until its termination in 1977.  The efforts of the SMSG yielded a reform in mathematics education known as [[New Math]] which was promulgated in a series of reports, culminating in a series published by [[Random House]] called the ''New Mathematical Library''.  In the early years, SMSG also produced a set of draft textbooks in typewritten paperback format for elementary, middle and high school students. 

Perhaps the most authoritative collection of materials from the School Mathematics Study Group is now housed in the [[Archives of American Mathematics]] in the [[University of Texas at Austin]]'s Center for American History.

The practice was held constitutional in the 1977 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case ''[[Ingraham v. Wright]]'', where the Court held that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause of the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]] did not apply to disciplinary corporal punishment in public schools, being restricted to the treatment of prisoners convicted of a [[crime]].&lt;ref name=Oluwole&gt;Oluwole, Joseph (23 September 2014). [http://www.britannica.com/event/Ingraham-v-Wright "Ingraham v. Wright".] ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the years since, a number of U.S. states have banned corporal punishment in public schools,&lt;ref name=Phoenix/&gt; with the most recent state to outlaw public school corporal punishment being [[New Mexico]] in 2011&lt;ref name="lyman"/&gt;, and the most recent de-facto statewide ban to occur in [[North Carolina]] in 2018, when the last school district in the state not to ban public school corporal punishment voted to ban. 

As of October 2, 2018, corporal punishment is still legal in private schools in every U.S. state except [[New Jersey]] and [[Iowa]], legal in public schools in 19 U.S. states, permitted in 18, and practiced in 15 U.S. states.

As of 2014, a student is hit in a U.S. public school an average of once every 30 seconds.''&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, Valerie (18 September 2014). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2014/09/18/19-states-still-allow-corporal-punishment-in-school/ "19 states still allow corporal punishment in school".] ''The Washington Post''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of corporal punishment in U.S. schools==

Corporal punishment was widely utilized in U.S. schools during the 19th and 20th centuries as a way to motivate students to perform better academically and maintain objectively good standards of behavior.&lt;ref name="middleton"&gt;Middleton, Jacob. ''The Experience of Corporal Punishment in Schools, 1890–1940'', History of Education, Vol. 37, No. 2, March 2008, pp. 253–275&lt;/ref&gt; The practice was generally considered a fair and rational way to discipline school children, particularly given its parallels to the [[Incarceration in the United States|criminal justice system]], and teachers in the late 19th century were encouraged to employ corporal punishment over other types of discipline.&lt;ref name="landon"&gt;Landon, Joseph. ''The Principles and Practice of Teaching and Class Management'', Alfred M. Holdon, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the English-speaking world, the right of teachers to discipline children is enshrined in the common-law doctrine ''[[in loco parentis]]'' (Latin for "in the place of parents"), which places a legal responsibility on authority-holders to take on the functions of a parent in some instances.&lt;ref name="inloco"&gt;Don R. Bridinger, (1957). [https://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3665&amp;context=clevstlrev "Discipline by Teachers in Loco Parentis"] Cleveland State Law Review.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the earliest parental opposition to corporal punishment in schools occurred in England in 1899 in the case ''Gardiner v. Bygrave'',&lt;ref name="middleton" /&gt; in which a teacher in London was acquitted after a parent took him to court for assault after he physically punished their son. This case set a precedent that schools could discipline children in the way they saw fit, regardless of the wishes of the parent regarding the physical punishment of their child. Over the next century, the conception of corporal punishment as a common component of disciplining students in public schools would be challenged in various countries, but opposition to corporal punishment it schools wouldn't make it to the U.S. Supreme Court until 1977.

===Federal stance===
In 1977, the question of the legality of corporal punishment in schools was brought to the Supreme Court. At this point, only New Jersey (1867), Massachusetts (1971), Hawaii (1973), and Maine (1975) had outlawed physical punishment in public schools, and just New Jersey had also outlawed the practice in private schools. Many assumed that the Supremes would rule in favor of the plaintiffs.

The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the legality of corporal punishment in schools in the landmark [[Ingraham v. Wright]] case. The Supremes ruled 5-4 that the corporal punishment of James Ingraham, who was restrained by his assistant principal and paddled by the principal over 20 times, ultimately requiring medical attention, did not constitute the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]], which protects citizens from cruel and unusual punishment. They further concluded that corporal punishment did not violate the due process clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], since teachers or administrators administering excessive punishment can face criminal charges.&lt;ref name=Oluwole/&gt;&lt;ref name="hyman"&gt;Irwin A. Hyman; James H. Wise [https://www.questia.com/read/8095712/corporal-punishment-in-american-education-readings "Corporal Punishment in American Education: Readings in History, Practice, and Alternatives"]. ''Corporal Punishment in American Education: Readings in History, Practice, and Alternatives,'' Temple University Press, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; This case established a precedent of "reasonable, but not excessive" punishment of students and was criticized by some scholars as "an apparent low point in American teacher-student relations."&lt;ref name="Rowland"&gt;Debran Rowland [https://books.google.com/books?id=-u6OgdOpN9AC&amp;pg=PA556&amp;lpg=PA556&amp;dq=ingraham+v.+wright+significance&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6rI7EibH6J&amp;sig=DthIbK8OUvxzFwed09O_2Vt-JI0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwit7Zz_w9PZAhUl7oMKHdGQAio4ChDoAQhmMAw#v=onepage&amp;q=ingraham%20v.%20wright%20significance&amp;f=false "The Boundaries of Her Body: The Troubling History of Women's Rights in America"]. ''The Boundaries of Her Body: The Troubling History of Women's Rights in America'' Sphinx Pub, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ingraham v. Wright ruling firmly pushed the decision of whether or not to outlaw corporal punishment in schools squarely onto state legislators. A majority of state bans on corporal punishment have occurred in the intervening years since 1977.

===States' stance===

Individual states have had the power to ban corporal punishment in public schools since the 19th century. Each state has the authority to define corporal punishment in its state laws, so bans on corporal punishment differ from state to state.&lt;ref name="NPR2017"/&gt; For example, in Texas, teachers are permitted to paddle children and to use "any other physical force" to control children in the name of discipline;&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; in Alabama, the rules are more explicit: teachers are permitted to use a "wooden paddle approximately 24 inches in length, 3 inches wide and ½ inch thick."&lt;ref name="Pickens"&gt;Pickens County Board of Education (2015). [http://www.pickenscountyschools.net/?DivisionID=11923&amp;DepartmentID=12384 "The Pickens County Board of Education Board Policy Manual."]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first state to abolish school corporal punishment was [[New Jersey]] in 1867.&lt;ref name=Phoenix/&gt; In 1894, a Newark bill challenged this ruling, arguing that whipping should be legal if parents consented to it; the New Jersey House defeated that bill, with one doctor's testimonial asserting that the bill's provisions "would expose children who did not have thoughtful and careful parents to the cruel discrimination of the teachers."&lt;ref name="Times1894"&gt;NY Times Editorial (20 March 1894).[https://www.corpun.com/uss89403.htm#19675 "New-Jersey House Says Newark Teachers Shall Not Use the Rattan."]. ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; The second state to ban corporal punishment in schools was [[Massachusetts]], 104 years later in 1971. As of 2015, corporal punishment is banned in [[state schools]] (known as ''public schools'' in the U.S.) in 31 U.S. states and the [[District of Columbia]] (see list below).&lt;ref name="lyman"&gt;Lyman, Rick (30 September 2006).[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/30/education/30punish.html "In Many Public Schools, the Paddle Is No Relic"]. ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; The usage of corporal punishment in [[private school]]s is legally permitted in nearly every state, though extremely uncommon in most, with only [[New Jersey]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corpun.com/usscr1.htm United States - Extracts from State legislation] at World Corporal Punishment Research.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Iowa]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legis.state.ia.us/IACODE/2003SUPPLEMENT/280/21.html Iowa statutes, 280.21.]&lt;/ref&gt; prohibiting it in both public and private schools. Corporal punishment is still used in schools to a significant (though declining)&lt;ref name="ced"&gt;[http://www.stophitting.com/index.php?page=statesbanning "Corporal Punishment and Paddling Statistics by State and Race"], Center for Effective Discipline.&lt;/ref&gt; extent in some public schools in [[Alabama]], [[Arkansas]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Tennessee]], North Carolina and [[Texas]]. The most recent state to outlaw school corporal punishment was [[New Mexico]] in 2011.&lt;ref name="lyman"/&gt;

The majority of students who experience corporal punishment reside in the [[Southern United States]]; Department of Education data from 2011–2012 show that 70 percent of students subjected to corporal punishment were from the five states of [[Alabama]], [[Arkansas]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Mississippi]], and [[Texas]], with the latter two states accounting for 35 percent of corporal punishment cases.&lt;ref name=Atlantic&gt;{{cite web |author=Anderson, Melinda |date=15 December 2015 |title=Where Teachers Are Still Allowed to Spank Students |website=The Atlantic |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/12/corporal-punishment/420420/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lyman" /&gt;

Students can be physically punished from kindergarten to the end of high school, meaning that even legal [[adult]]s who have reached the [[age of majority]] are sometimes spanked by school officials.&lt;ref name="corpun"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.corpun.com/counuss.htm |title= Corporal punishment in US schools |author= C. Farrell |date=October 2016 |website= www.corpun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a majority of states that permit corporal punishment require that parental consent be given before children may be paddled. In these states, parents are sometimes (but not always) given the option of physical punishment of their child instead of alternate disciplinary measures, like suspension.&lt;ref name="NPR2017"&gt;{{cite web |author=Clark, Jess|url= https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2017/04/12/521944429/where-corporal-punishment-is-still-used-its-roots-go-deep |title= Where Corporal Punishment Is Still Used In Schools, Its Roots Run Deep |date=April 2017 |website= www.npr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevalence of school corporal punishment has decreased since the 1970s, declining from 4 percent of the total number of children in schools in 1978 to less than 1 percent in 2014. This reduction is partially explained by the increasing number of states banning corporal punishment from public schools between 1974 and 1994.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/900942715|title=Corporal punishment in U.S. public schools : legal precedents, current practices, and future policy|last=Gershoff |first=Elizabeth T.|last2=Purtell|first2=Kelly M|last3=Holas|first3=Igor|publisher=|year=|isbn=9783319148182|location=Cham|pages=|oclc=900942715}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of instances of corporal punishment in U.S. schools have also declined in recent years. In the 2002-2003 school year, federal statistics estimated that 300,000 children were disciplined with corporal punishment at school at least once. In the 2006-2007 school year, this number was reduced to 223,190 instances.&lt;ref name="pate"&gt;Pate, Matthew and Gould, Laurie. ''Corporal Punishment Around the World.'' ABC-CLIO, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Department of Education, over 166,000 students in public schools were physically punished during the 2011–2012 school year.&lt;ref name="Atlantic2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/12/corporal-punishment/420420/|title=Where Teachers Are Still Allowed to Spank Students|author=Anderson, Melinda|date=15 December 2015|website=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2013-2014 academic year, this number was reduced to 109,000 students.&lt;ref name="sparks2"&gt;Sparks, Sarah and Harwin, Alex. [https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2016/08/23/corporal-punishment-use-found-in-schools-in.html "Corporal Punishment Use Found in Schools in 21 States."] ''Education Week," 23 August 2016.''&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the 2011-2012 academic year, 19 states legally allowed school corporal punishment. Approximately 14 percent of the schools in those 19 states reported the use of corporal punishment, and 1 in 8 students attended schools that use this practice.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt;

=== Behaviors that elicit corporal punishment in schools ===

Several studies have explored which  behaviors elicit corporal punishment as a response, but so far there is not a cohesive and standardized system use within states or across states. The [[Human Rights Watch]] conducted a series of interviews with paddled students and teachers in Mississippi and Texas and found that most of school corporal punishment was for minor infractions, such as violating the dress code, being tardy, talking in class, running in the hallway and going to the bathroom without permission.&lt;ref&gt;Human Right Watch (2008). A Violent Education Corporal Punishment of Children in US Public Schools. https://www.aclu.org/files/pdfs/humanrights/aviolenteducation_report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A review of over 6,000 disciplinary files in Florida for 1987-1988 school year found that corporal punishment use in schools was not related to the severity of student's misbehavior or with the frequency of the infraction.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, S. R., &amp; Braden, J. P. (1990). Race and gender bias in the administration of corporal punishment. ''School Psychology Review, 19''(3), 378-383.&lt;/ref&gt; Czumbil and Hyman reviewed over 500 media stories about corporal punishment in newspapers from 1975 to 1992 and coded the reason of the punishment and its severity. They found that the nature of the child's misbehavior (violent or non-violent) did not meaningfully influence whether the student was physically punished or not.&lt;ref&gt;Czumbil, M. R., &amp; Hyman, I. A. (1997). What happens when corporal punishment is legal? Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 12, 309–315. doi:10.1177/088626097012002010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disparities ===
Many studies have found that there are extreme disparities in the physical punishment of students across racial and ethnic lines, gender and disability status.&lt;ref name="Success"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2010/04/15/corporal-punishment-schools-and-its-effect-academic-success-joint-hrw/aclu-statement|title=Corporal Punishment in Schools and Its Effect on Academic Success|date=15 April 2010|publisher=Human Rights Watch, American Civil Liberties Union|accessdate=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gershoff|first=Elizabeth T.|last2=Font|first2=Sarah A.|date=2016|title=Corporal Punishment in U.S. Public Schools: Prevalence, Disparities in Use, and Status in State and Federal Policy|journal=Social policy report|volume=30|pages=|issn=1075-7031|pmc=5766273|pmid=29333055|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, results suggest that boys, children of color and children with disabilities are most likely to be targets of corporal punishment.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;  These disparities may violate three federal laws that prohibit discrimination by race, gender and disability status: [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]], [[Title IX|Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972]], and [[Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973]].&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt;

==== By gender ====
At the turn of the 20th century, both boys and girls received roughly equal levels of corporal punishments in U.S. schools, but girls were more likely to report their punishment as 'unjust' or 'unfair.' However, while punishment was seen as a builder of [[masculinity]] for boys, girls were not expected to experience the same benefits, so their punishment was often, but not always, more lenient.&lt;ref name="middleton" /&gt; This trend in gender parity changed significantly in the next century.

Today, boys are more likely than girls to be physically punished in schools, and this disparity has persisted for decades.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt; In 1992, boys accounted for 81 percent of all incidents of physical discipline in schools.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gregory|first=James F.|date=1995|title=The Crime of Punishment: Racial and Gender Disparities in the use of Corporal Punishment in U.S. Public Schools|jstor=2967267|journal=The Journal of Negro Education|volume=64|issue=4|pages=454–462|doi=10.2307/2967267}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012, the majority of school districts within states that legally allow corporal punishment registered a ratio of 3:1 or higher, indicating that boys are 3 times more likely than girls to experience corporal punishment.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt; Differences in behavior (and perceived behavior) can explain a fraction of this imbalance, but does not account for the entire discrepancy between the genders. Boys have been found to be two times as likely as girls to be disciplined for misbehavior in school, but they are four times as likely to be disciplined using corporal punishment.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Skiba|first=Russell J.|last2=Michael|first2=Robert S.|last3=Nardo|first3=Abra Carroll|last4=Peterson|first4=Reece L.|date=1 December 2002|title=The Color of Discipline: Sources of Racial and Gender Disproportionality in School Punishment|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1021320817372|journal=The Urban Review|language=en|volume=34|issue=4|pages=317–342|doi=10.1023/a:1021320817372|issn=0042-0972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When race and gender are considered together, black boys are 16 times as likely to be subject of corporal punishment as white girls.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Among children with disabilities, black boys have the highest probability of being subject to corporal punishment, followed by white boys, black girls and white girls. While black boys are 1.8 times as likely as white boys to be physically punished, black girls are 3 times more likely than white girls.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt;

==== By race or ethnicity ====
The race and ethnic disparities in school corporal punishment have decreased within groups over time, but the relative prevalence of corporal punishment between groups has remained stable.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt; Black students are physically punished at higher rates than white or Hispanics. In contrast, Hispanic students are less likely than white students to receive corporal punishment. One study found that African-American students were more likely than either white or Hispanic students to be physically punished, by 2.5 times and 6.5 times respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Gershoff, E. T. (2008). Report on Physical Punishment in the United States: What Research Tells Us About Its Effects on Children. Columbus, OH: Center for Effective Discipline.&lt;/ref&gt; Another study calculated the proportion of Black students who were physically punished to the proportion of white students who were by state, and found that for the 2011-2012 academic year, black children in Alabama and Mississippi were over 5 times more likely to be disciplined with corporal punishment than their white counterparts. In other southeastern states -Florida, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana and Tennessee- black children were more than 3 times more likely to receive corporal punishment than white children.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

A review of over 4,000 discipline events in Florida from 1987-1989 across nine schools revealed that, although Black students constituted 22 percent of school enrollment, they accounted for over 50 percent of all cases of corporal punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McFadden|first=Anna C.|last2=Marsh|first2=George E.|last3=Price|first3=Barrie Jo|last4=Hwang|first4=Yunhan|date=1 December 1992|title=A study of race and gender bias in the punishment of handicapped school children|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01108358|journal=The Urban Review|language=en|volume=24|issue=4|pages=239–251|doi=10.1007/BF01108358|issn=0042-0972}}&lt;/ref&gt; The North Carolina Department of Public Instruction in 2013 published a review of corporal punishment cases in the 2011-2012 academic year founding that corporal punishment was disproportionately applied to Native American students, who represented 58 percent of all cases of corporal punishment while being only 2 percent of the student population.&lt;ref&gt;North Carolina Department of Public Instruction. (2013). [http://www.ncpublicschools.org/docs/research/discipline/reports/consolidated/2011-12/consolidated-report.pdf Consolidated Data Report, 2011-2012.] State Board of Education, Public Schools of North Carolina.&lt;/ref&gt;

The disparity by race in the use of corporal punishment in schools goes in line with findings of other methods of discipline, where Black children are 2 to 3 times more likely than white children to be suspended or expelled from schools. According to a study by the American Psychological Association, these imbalances are not due to a higher likelihood of misbehaving by children of one race over another, or the socio-economic status of the children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Force|first=American Psychological Association Zero Tolerance Task|title=Are zero tolerance policies effective in the schools?: An evidentiary review and recommendations.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0003-066X.63.9.852|journal=American Psychologist|language=en|volume=63|issue=9|pages=852–862|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.63.9.852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== By disability status ====
Children with physical, mental, or emotional disabilities are afforded special protections and services in U.S. public schools.&lt;ref&gt;[[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]]. (1990). P.L. 101–476.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they are not afforded protection from school corporal punishment in the states that allow it, and in many states they are actually at greater risk for receiving corporal punishment than their non-disabled peers.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt; According to a report jointly authored by [[Human Rights Watch]] and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], the United States Department of Education's Civil Rights Data Collection for 2006 shows that students with [[Disability|disabilities]] are subjected to corporal punishment at disproportionately high rates for their share of the population.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.hrw.org/news/2010/04/15/corporal-punishment-schools-and-its-effect-academic-success-joint-hrw/aclu-statement Corporal Punishment in Schools and Its Effect on Academic Success]". Human Rights Watch, American Civil Liberties Union. 15 April 2010. Retrieved November 201&lt;/ref&gt; Representative [[Carolyn McCarthy]] remarked in a 2010 [[congressional hearing]] that students with disabilities are subjected to corporal punishment at "approximately twice the rate of the general student population in some States."&lt;ref&gt;[http://democrats.edworkforce.house.gov/sites/democrats.edworkforce.house.gov/files/documents/111/pdf/statements/20100415McCarthyHearingStatement.pdf "Chair McCarthy Statement at Subcommittee Hearing on 'Corporal Punishment in Schools and Its Effect on Academic Success'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304140531/http://democrats.edworkforce.house.gov/sites/democrats.edworkforce.house.gov/files/documents/111/pdf/statements/20100415McCarthyHearingStatement.pdf |date=4 March 2016 }} (PDF). U.S. House of Representatives Education &amp; Labor Committee. 15 April 2010. Retrieved November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Children with disabilities are 50 percent more likely to experience school corporal punishment in more than 30% of the school districts in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee. However, in some school districts among Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee, children with disability status are 5 times more likely to be subject of corporal punishment than peers without disabilities.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt;

== Effects on children ==
Although there is literature on the effects of parental use of corporal punishment on health and school performance, corporal punishment in schools has been understudied. There are correlational studies that linked the use of corporal punishment in schools with detrimental physical and psychological effects on children, and also provide evidence about its long-term effects.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

According to these studies,{{Specify|date=March 2018}} children exposed to school corporal punishment are more likely to have less conduct disorder problems, to experience feelings less of inadequacy and resentment, to be less aggressive and violent, and to less experience reduced problem-solving abilities, social competence and academic achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hyman|first=Irwin A.|title=Corporal punishment, psychological maltreatment, violence, and punitiveness in America: Research, advocacy, and public policy|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0962184905800848|journal=Applied and Preventive Psychology|volume=4|issue=2|pages=113–130|doi=10.1016/s0962-1849(05)80084-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have suggested that corporal punishment in schools can deter children's cognitive development, as children subject to corporal punishment in schools have a more restricted vocabulary, poorer school marks, and lower IQ scores.&lt;ref&gt;Ogando Portela, Maria José; Pells, Kirrily (2015). C [https://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/788-corporal-punishment-in-schools-longitudinal-evidence-from-ethiopia-india-peru-and.html orporal Punishment in Schools - Longitudinal Evidence from Ethiopia, India, Peru and Viet Nam], ''Innocenti Discussion Papers''UNICEF Office of Research - Innocenti, Florence.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, disparities in the use of corporal punishment among gender, race and disability status can be perceived by children as discrimination. This perceived discrimination has been related with lower self-esteem, lower positive mood, higher depression and anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmitt|first=Michael T.|last2=Branscombe|first2=Nyla R.|last3=Postmes|first3=Tom|last4=Garcia|first4=Amber|title=The consequences of perceived discrimination for psychological well-being: A meta-analytic review.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0035754|journal=Psychological Bulletin|language=en|volume=140|issue=4|pages=921–948|doi=10.1037/a0035754}}&lt;/ref&gt; These effects can also manifest as low academic engagement and more negative school behaviors, which exacerbate the existing gap in discipline policies along race and gender lines.&lt;ref&gt;Smalls C., White, R., Chavous, T., &amp; Sellers, R. (2007). [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0095798407302541#articleCitationDownloadContainer Racial ideological beliefs and racial discrimination experiences as predictors of academic engagement among African American adolescents]. Journal of Black Psychology, 33, 299-330. doi:10.1177/0095798407302541&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have found a negative correlation between legality of corporal punishment and test scores. Students who are not exposed to school corporal punishment exhibit better results on the ACT test compared to students in states that allow disciplinary corporal punishment in schools.&lt;ref name="CED"&gt;Center for Effective Discipline (2010), [http://www.gundersenhealth.org/ncptc/center-for-effective-discipline/discipline-at-school/act-scores/ Paddling Versus ACT Scores - A Retrospective Analysis], Ohio: Center for Effective Discipline.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, 75 percent of states that allow corporal punishment in schools scored below average on the ACT composite, while three-quarters of non-paddling states scored above the national average. Improvement trend among the years also differ, in the last 18 years 66 percent non-paddling states have above average rates of improvement, while 50 percent of spanking states were above the national trend of improvement.&lt;ref name=CED/&gt;

Furthermore, while corporal punishment is sometimes lauded as an alternative to [[Suspension (punishment)|suspension]], the lack of formal training for U.S. teachers means that there is no consistently implemented style of corporal punishment that takes into account the size, age, or psychological profile of students. This leaves students more vulnerable to physical and psychological injury.&lt;ref name="sparks2"/&gt;

In November 2018 the American Academy of Pediatrics has issued a new policy statement taking a stronger stance against corporal punishment, including spanking, 20 years after releasing its last position statement on effective discipline.

The AAP mentioned in particular the risks on mental health issues and anger management problems, in children and teens who received corporal punishments in school. 

== Controversy ==

=== Public opinion in the U.S. ===
Public-opinion research has found that most Americans are not in favor of school corporal punishment; in polls taken in 2002 and 2005, American adults were respectively 72% and 77% opposed to the use of corporal punishment by teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth T. Gershoff, [https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/lcp/vol73/iss2/3 More Harm Than Good: A Summary of Scientific Research on the Intended and Unintended Effects of Corporal Punishment on Children], 73 ''Law and Contemporary Problems'' 31-56 (Spring 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, a national survey conducted on teachers ranked corporal punishment as the lowest effective method to discipline offenders among eight possible techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Little|first=Steven G.|last2=Akin-Little|first2=Angeleque|date=1 March 2008|title=Psychology's contributions to classroom management|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pits.20293/abstract|journal=Psychology in the Schools|language=en|volume=45|issue=3|pages=227–234|doi=10.1002/pits.20293|issn=1520-6807}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A bill to end the use of corporal punishment in schools was introduced into the United States House of Representatives in June 2010 during the 111th Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Vagins, Deborah J. (3 July 2010). [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/deborah-j-vagins/an-arcane-destructive_b_631417.html "An Arcane, Destructive — and Still Legal — Practice."] ''[[The Huffington Post]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Carolyn McCarthy|McCarthy, Carolyn]] (2010). [http://carolynmccarthy.house.gov/index.cfm?sectionid=155&amp;sectiontree=189,155&amp;itemid=1550 ''Congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy Introduces Legislation to End Corporal Punishment in Schools.''] 29 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The bill, H.R. 5628,&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.5628: H.R. 5628], 111th Congress, 2d Session&lt;/ref&gt; was referred to the [[United States House Committee on Education and Labor]] where it was not brought up for a vote. A previous bill "to deny funds to educational programs that allow corporal punishment"&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c102:H.R.1522: H.R. 1522], 102d Congress, 1st Session.&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced into the U.S. House of Representatives in 1991 by Representative [[Major Owens]]. That bill, H.R. 1522, did not become law. A new bill, the Ending Corporal Punishment in Schools Act of 2015 (HR 2268) would prohibit all corporal punishment, defined as "paddling, spanking, or other forms of physical punishment, however light, imposed upon a student", the petition was closed. In 2017, Ending Corporal Punishment in Schools Act of 2017 was introduced, and was referred to the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/160 H.R. 160], 115th Congress. Ending Corporal Punishment in Schools Act of 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States' [[National Association of Secondary School Principals]] (NASSP) opposes the use of corporal punishment in schools, defined as the deliberate infliction of pain in response to students' unacceptable behavior and/or language. In articulating their opposition, they cite the disproportionate use of corporal punishment on Black students in the US: potential adverse effects on students' self-image and school achievement, correlation between school corporal punishment and increased truancy, drop-out rates, violence, and vandalism by youth, the potential for misuse and/or injury to students, and increased legal liability for schools. The NASSP notes that the use of corporal punishment in schools is inconsistent with laws regarding child abuse as well as policies toward "racial, economic, and gender equity", asserting that "Fear of pain or embarrassment has no place" in the process of education. The NASSP recommends a range of alternatives to corporal punishment, including "appropriate instruction", "behavioral contracts", "[[positive reinforcement]]", and "individual and group counseling" where necessary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.principals.org/Content.aspx?topic=47093 "Corporal punishment"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203092131/http://www.principals.org/Content.aspx?topic=47093 |date=3 December 2010 }}. National Association of Secondary School Principals. February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars{{Like whom?|date=March 2018}} note a severe legal double-standard when it comes to the physical punishment of children versus adults. In North Carolina, teachers can use a 2-foot long paddle to discipline children, which, in some cases, is more than half the height of an elementary school-aged child.&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/data/set2clinical/set2color.pdf " Clinical growth charts: Set 2 summary file."] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; "In any other context, the act of an adult hitting another person with a board [2 feet long] (or really, of any size) would be considered assault with a weapon and would be punishable under criminal law."&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

However, some teachers and administrators{{Specify|date=March 2018}} defend the use of corporal punishment in the classroom as a reasonable alternative to other types of disciplinary action, like suspension, which have been shown to negatively impact children's classroom performance and social skills.&lt;ref name="suspension"&gt;Anne-Marie Iselin, [https://childandfamilypolicy.duke.edu/pdfs/familyimpact/2010/Suspension_Research_Brief_2010-04-27.pdf Research on School Suspension], ''Center for Child and Family Policy, Duke University''(Spring 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Some students, when given the choice between an in-school suspension and corporal punishment, choose to be physically punished in lieu of missing class time.&lt;ref name="NPR2017"/&gt;

The student's choice in favor of corporal punishment is often dictated by the parents and by the fact that a corporal punishment is not reported on student's personal record, when a suspension is duly recorded and can jeopardize the access to the university. Often students accept a physical punishment as a way to erase the record of the infraction. 

In March 2018 the mother of Wylie Greer, a senior year student, has published a Tweet that become viral, she reported that during national gun control student walkout, his son with two other students walked out of class in Greenbrier High School, Arkansas. The same day the Assistant principal Mr Brett Meek informed Wylie of the consequences, two days of suspension or two "swats" with a wooden paddle. Wylie chose the corporal punishment. During a nationwide protest in favor of a more strict gun control, Wylie described the experience more humiliating than painful, but he reported that Mr.Meek warned him that it was a particularly light punishment, somehow to avoid further bad publicity to the school. Arkansas is one of the states where even senior students above 18 year old, can be paddled in school. 

In the 2018 case Ayers v Wells, Mr Ayers, Assistant principal in Etowah middle school in Alabama, was accused of excessive use of force during a paddling incident in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Thornton |first1=Donna |title=Judge refuses to dismiss charge in paddling case |url=http://www.gadsdentimes.com/news/20180402/judge-refuses-to-dismiss-charge-in-paddling-case |website=The Gadsen Times |publisher=The Gadsen Times |accessdate=7 November 2018 |ref=gadsen-times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge William Ogletree refused to dismiss the charges of child abuse against Mr Ayers and argued that immunity laws cannot be an excuse for using disproportionate force during punishments. This was the first legal limit to immunity laws and school corporal punishments in Alabama.

In September 2018 The Georgia School of Innovation and the Classics in Georgia sparked controversy when the superintendent Jody Boulineau proposed a reintroduction of corporal punishment. One third of the parents agreed with the proposal. Mr Boulineau in a interview with CBS said that he was really surprised of the outrage from some parents. Google review ratings for the school dropped by 2 points, and several parents expressed in their reviews that they wish to find school alternatives, for fear of their children's safety. The school engaged in a counter-campaign to seek to boost the lowered Google review rating.

On 3 October 2018 Gary L. Gunckel, the principal of schools in Indianola, Oklahoma was charged with two counts of felony child assault after paddling that left two boys with deep bruises. One of the children fell to the ground during paddling, and Gunckel apologized to one of the mothers for busting the boys. Once more, parents that gave consent for paddling realized too late that school corporal punishments can be much more severe than any corporal punishment dealt at home. In light of recent events it is indeed almost impossible to draw a line between punishment and child abuse and it is impossible to determine some standard on how hard a kid could be punished without committing a crime. The Supreme Court case [[Ingraham v. Wright]] appears to be more and more outdated facing growing hostility from parents towards consequences of corporal punishments in school. Gunckel has been placed on administrative leave.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="757">'''Social and Vocational Skills''' (SVS) is a subject which can be taken in [[high schools]] as a [[Standard Grade]] in Scotland. Unlike other subjects in the [[Scottish educational system]], those who take it are picked specially to do it, normally due to failings in other subjects or social issues. There are exceptions to this rule however, such as [[Elgin Academy, Scotland|Elgin Academy]] in Moray, where it is taken as an additional compulsory standard grade by all pupils, giving most students a possible total of 9.

{{nihongo|'''''Super Boy Allan'''''|スーパーボーイ・アラン|Sūpā Bōi Aran}} is an [[educational video game]] developed by [[Asmik Corporation]] for the [[Family Computer Disk System]], and published by [[Sunsoft]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamefaqs.com/famicomds/578394-super-boy-allan&lt;/ref&gt;

''Super Boy Allan'' is the second installment in Sunsoft and Asmik's Intelligence Game trilogy. It is preceded by ''[[Adian no Tsue]]'' (1986), and followed by ''[[Chitei Tairiku Orudora]]'' (1987).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.giantbomb.com/super-boy-allan/3030-42272/ |title=''Super Boy Allan'' |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=[[Giant Bomb]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the game, Allan Colada journeys from his home in the foothills into the mountains to retrieve a remedy for his sister Leela's fever.

==Gameplay==
To progress through most game screens, the player must push, kick, or pull logs to clear a path to the exit, as well as to solve [[arithmetic]] [[equation]]s and [[Inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] statements involving [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=9017567 |title=Super Boy Allan Is Not So Super |last=Cifaldi |first=Frank |date=22 January 2010 |website=[[1Up.com]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanics of the log-pushing puzzles are comparable to those in the ''[[Eggerland (series)|Eggerland]]'' [[video game franchise]], which in turn derive from ''[[Sokoban]]'' (1982). However, by using a rope (which are in limited supply), Allan can also pull a log away. Kicking a log toward an enemy defeats the enemy.

The design of the game world is patterned on [[Nintendo]]'s [[action-adventure game]] ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' (1986).{{fact|date=June 2018}}

'''The Circle School''' is an Integral school located in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]] and founded in 1984, and is operated similarly to the [[Sudbury model]] established by the [[Sudbury Valley School]] in [[Framingham]], [[Massachusetts]].  It enrolls pre-kindergarten through high school aged children. The Circle School currently has approximately 70 students enrolled and 5 full-time staff members.  It is one of three Sudbury-like schools in [[Pennsylvania]] and one of the oldest in the world.

==Educational method==
The Sudbury Valley model of schooling has two defining characteristics. First, the students are free to spend their time as they choose.  During the hours they are in school students can spend their time engaging in any activity they wish (reading, playing video games, climbing trees, conversing, studying, playing trumpet etc.).  The only requirements placed on them are that they must follow the rules and that they must do a chore each day (the school has no custodian).  There are no required grades or evaluations, the idea being that every activity students engage in, they engage in because they wish to do so.  The second defining characteristic is that the school is run democratically on a one-person, one vote-model. All the "day-to-day" affairs of the school are governed by a democratic body called the School Meeting. There, decisions are made concerning such things as creating, repealing or amending rules, all aspects of managing the school, suspending and expelling students, etc.  The School Meeting is composed of all students and staff members (teachers) and since the students greatly outnumber the staff members, most of the administrative power lies with the students.  This model of education receives a great deal of skepticism as it is very different than the other methods of teaching.

==History==
The Circle School was founded in 1984 by Beth Stone, Jim Rietmulder and Sue Narten.  They were soon joined by dee Holland-Vogt.  The school was not founded as a democratic school but as an innovative pre-school and elementary school. In 1997 The Circle School added high school grades and has ever since included all grades, pre-kindergarten through high school.

'''ThreeJars, Inc.''' is a U.S.-based company specializing in teaching [[financial literacy]] to children aged 5 to 13 through an online allowance service.  They believe it is best to teach children about money early in life, through allowance, and hands-on experience.

==Operation==
ThreeJars works like an online bank for children, but instead of cash, parents pay allowances in [[IOU]]s, representing real money. Parents decide how the allowance will be allocated to their child's SAVE, SPEND and SHARE Jars. Parents can track chores and paying projects. Earned IOUs are credited to a child's jars, but the actual cash stays with the parent. A parent's approval is required for all financial transactions. Children learn to budget, set financial goals, delay gratification, earn interest, and make charitable donations. Children track their financial choices.

ThreeJars employs the financial expertise of [[Jean Chatzky]].

ThreeJars is located in [[Westport, Connecticut]] and services the United States and Canada.

==History==
ThreeJars was founded by a husband and wife of six children: Anton Simunovic and Carlotta McClaran. The founders explain on their website:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Like most parents, my wife and I wanted our kids to lead happy, purposeful lives. But how to raise a child with a mind for managing money and a heart for helping others? Despite a career in finance, I found it hard to speak to my kids about money. While I didn't want them to feel entitled, I didn't want them to stress over money either. We all know that if you do not learn to manage money responsibly it will end up managing you. If we're lucky, we also understand that by helping others we are really helping ourselves. Both of these values are at the core of ThreeJars.''{{cite quote|date=May 2011}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Partnerships==
ThreeJars has partnered with several experts (including [[Jean Chatzky]]), companies (including [[Rogers Communications]] and [[Parents (magazine)|''Parents Magazine'']]), and charities in the fields of finance, parenting, and philanthropy. Charities that may be supported by ThreeJars clients include:
* [[ASPCA|American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]]
* [[Carbobfund.org|The Carbobfund.org Foundation]]
* [[Save The Children]]
* [[WDCS|Whale and Dolphin Conversation Society]]
* [[The Nature Conservancy]]
* [[Smile Train]]
* [[Wolf Conservation Center]]
* [[Play Soccer Nonprofit International]]
* [[Sea Turtle Conservancy]]
* [[Right to Play]]
* [[Performing Animal Welfare Society]]
* [[The Mr. Holland's Opus Foundation]]

==Reception==
ThreeJars.com has been reviewed in various publications and websites, including ''[[Consumer Reports]]''&lt;ref name=CR&gt;

In general, reviewers agree that the site's independence from credit card payments is a benefit.  (Children request payouts from their virtual accounts, and parents receive an alert of the request, fulfilling the request out of their own cash on hand.)  However, they disliked the option of payouts in gift cards, noting that such cards limit a child's choices of how to spend their money, and often go [[Gift card#Redemption rate|unredeemed or partially redeemed]].&lt;ref name=CR/&gt; Since the ''Consumer Reports'' review, ThreeJars has ceased to offer gift cards as a redemption option.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The '''University of Fribourg''' ({{lang-fr|Université de Fribourg}}; {{lang-de|Universität Freiburg}}) is a [[university]] in the city of [[Fribourg]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Fribourg University Law Faculty|url=http://www.llm-guide.com/university/776/fribourg-university-law-faculty|journal=www.llm-guide.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The roots of the university can be traced back to 1580, when the notable Jesuit [[Peter Canisius]] founded the [[Collège Saint-Michel]] in the City of [[Fribourg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Saint Peter Canisius - The Windmill of Wisdom|url=http://www.dailycatholic.org/apr27doc.htm|journal=www.dailycatholic.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1763, an Academy of law was founded by the state of Fribourg which formed the nucleus of the present Law Faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=University of Fribourg|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06302a.htm|journal=www.newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Fribourg was finally created in 1889 by an Act of the parliament of the Swiss [[Canton of Fribourg]].&lt;ref name=handbook&gt;{{cite journal |title=University of Fribourg - Universities Handbook|url=http://www.universitieshandbook.com/directory/canton-fribourg/university-of-fribourg|journal=www.universitieshandbook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fribourg&gt;{{cite journal |title=Université de Fribourg|url=https://www.fr.ch/safu/fr/pub/universite_fribourg.htm|journal=www.fr.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Fribourg is Switzerland’s only bilingual university and offers full curricula in both French and German, two of Switzerland's national languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Université de Fribourg|url=http://fr.mastersportal.eu/universities/815/universitat-freiburg-universite-de-fribourg.html|journal=fr.mastersportal.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students number about 10,000; there are about 200 tenured professors and 700 other academic teaching and research personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=University of Fribourg|url=http://globaled.gmu.edu/programs/semester/switzerland.html|journal=globaled.gmu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Misericorde Campus, constructed between 1939–42, was designed by the architects Honegger and Dumas, students of Swiss architect [[Le Corbusier]].&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;

There are five [[Faculty (division)|faculties]]: [[Catholic theology]], [[law]], [[natural sciences]], [[humanities]], and [[economics]] &amp; [[social sciences]].&lt;ref name=UNIFR/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fribourg/&gt;

==History==
[[Image:University Fribourg 003.JPG|thumb|University of Fribourg, main building]]

The university owes its earliest origin to the foundation of the Jesuit [[:fr:Collège Saint-Michel (Fribourg)|College St. Michel]] on Belze Hill by [[Peter Canisius]] in 1580 at the invitation of the government of Fribourg.&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt; In 1763, an Academy of Law was founded, housed in the Albertinium (now a Dominican residence). In 1834, the cantonal library was formed from works brought to Fribourg (from Catholic monasteries) for safekeeping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Université de Fribourg|url=http://www.sellamquick.com/fr/classified_ads/university-of-business-and-international-2/|journal=www.sellamquick.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The College St. Michel was closed following the expulsion of the [[Jesuits]] from Fribourg after the canton's defeat in the Sonderbund war.&lt;ref name= newadvent&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06302a.htm|title=University of Fribourg (Switzerland)|work=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=2007-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Georges Python.jpg|thumb|250px|Plaque commemorating Georges Python]] --&gt;
In 1886, Georges Python, founder of the cantonal bank and State Counsellor for Fribourg (M.P. in the upper house of the Swiss parliament) became Director of Public Education. He raised funds through a lottery and was
granted some 2,500,000 CHF by the canton.&lt;ref name= newadvent/&gt; The cantonal library became integrated with that of the university and the Academy became the Faculty of Law. In 1939, the university moved to a new campus constructed on the former cemetery of Misericorde, ceding St. Michel to one of Fribourg's gymnasia, which took the name College St. Michel. During the Second World War, the university set up "university camps" along with the University of Zürich, HEC in St. Gall and a Lycée camp at Wetzikon provided a wide variety of courses to educate Polish prisoners of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The polish Army in France &amp; 2DSP internment in Switzerland 1939 - 1940|url=http://www.polandinexile.com/franceand2dsp.html|journal=www.polandinexile.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Perolles campus was constructed on the site of a former wagon factory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=University at miséricorde|url=http://www.fribourgtourisme.ch/en/uni-misericorde.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040731/http://www.fribourgtourisme.ch/en/uni-misericorde.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-03-04|journal=www.fribourgtourisme.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many lectures were originally in Latin, Fribourg is now the only French/German bilingual university in the world (45% French and 55% German).&lt;ref name=UNIFR/&gt; The town itself is 70% French and 30% German. This fact, coupled with the traditional dominance of French as the language of the city aristocracy explains why French has remained so dominant in university administration and in the AGEF (Association Generale des Etudiants Fribourgois), the Student's Union. To commemorate the centerary of the university, La Poste issued a stamp depicting the figures Science and Sagesse.

==Recent developments==
{{Unreferenced section|date= April 2018}}
In 2005, the university inaugurated its Perolles 2 campus, to which the Faculty of Economics and Social Science relocated. The university has the third largest collection of Biblical antiquities in the world after the British Museum and the Cairo Museum. Fribourg has also developed FriMat, a centre of excellence in nanotechnology. As part of the BeNeFri association comprising the Universities of Berne, Neuchâtel and Fribourg, students at any one of these universities may take courses at another in the association and still receive credit at their home institution. The [[academic degrees]] were the Demi-Licence, Licence, [[DEA (former French degree)|DEA]] / DESS, [[Doctorate]]. The university now follows the requirements of the [[Bologna process]].

The University of Fribourg launched for the 2009–2010 academic year a new postgraduate law programme, the [[Master of Laws in Cross-Cultural Business Practice]] (MLCBP), an [[LL.M]] taught entirely in English.

==Faculties==
The Fribourg University is divided into five faculties:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www3.unifr.ch/faculties/en/ |title=Faculties |publisher=University of Fribourg |location=Freibrug/Fribour, Switzerland |accessdate=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The ''Faculty of Humanities'' is the largest faculty with about 4,000 students. They follow courses and seminars in the fields of philosophy, historical sciences, languages, literature, education, psychology or social sciences.
* The ''Faculty of Law'' has about 1,900 students. The program includes national and international law; both subjects areas can be followed bilingual.
* The ''Faculty of Theology'' is the largest and the most international of Switzerland, and, with Lucerne, it is the only state university in Switzerland to have a Faculty of Catholic Theology.
* Approximately 1,900 students are enrolled in one of the four Bachelor programmes and one of the seven Master programmes of the ''Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences''. The faculty is composed of four departments: business management, economics, computer science, media and communication. In addition, the ''international institute of management in technology (iimt)'' and the ''[[:de:Verbandsmanagement Institut|Verbandsmanagement Institute (VMI)]]'' are attached to the Faculty.
* The ''Faculty of Science'' was founded in 1896 and has seven departments: biology, chemistry, geosciences, computer science, mathematics, medicine and physics. The Faculty is composed of 14 fields: biochemistry, biology, chemistry, geography, computer science, human medicine and dentistry (Bachelor), mathematics, neuroscience, pharmacy, physics, biomedical sciences, environmental sciences, earth sciences (geology) and sport. The [[Adolphe Merkle Institute]] (AMI) is an interdisciplinary research institute of the Faculty of Sciences devoted to fundamental and application-oriented research and teaching in the domain of soft nanomaterials.

==Traditions==
{{Unreferenced section|date= April 2018}}
*Dies Academicus - On this day in November every year, no lectures are held. Festivities begin with Mass in the Chapel of the Collège St. Michel. The members of the University then proceed to the Aula Magna (Great Hall) in solemn procession. After an address by the rector and a prominent guest speaker, honorary degrees are awarded. The student guilds attend in ceremonial dress including swords.
*[[Corporation (university)|Corporations]] - These are similar to the [[Studentenverbindung]]en in Germany and Austria, but there is no de facto constraint to participate as it is in the [[student nations]] at the universities of [[Uppsala]], [[Lund]] and [[Helsinki]]. They maintain Central European student traditions and meet at least once a week around a ''Stammtisch'' ("regulars’ table") in order to socialise, drink and sing together. They tend to be organised on linguistic lines. One of them is still engaged in dueling, while the other corporations in Fribourg already rejected this tradition at the time they were founded, amongst others for religious reasons. Membership has often been considered advantageous for those wishing to pursue a career in business, politics or law. Most of Fribourg's student corporations belong to the formerly Catholic ''[[Schweizerischer Studentenverein]]''. An example is [[AV Fryburgia]].
*The Day of Welcomes (''Jour D’Accueil'') - Similar to Freshers’ Week in anglophone universities. New students are invited to the Aula Magna, where they are welcomed to Fribourg by the Rector and the Syndic (Mayor of the City of Fribourg). This is followed by a meal in the university mensa provided by the city, where new students are expected to dine with the rest of the faculty to which they have been admitted.
*Every year, the Catholic Church holds collections during masses throughout Switzerland. Known as Fribourg Sunday, the funds raised are mainly used to award scholarships to foreign priests by the Faculty of Theology.

==Branding==
{{Unreferenced section|date= April 2018}}
The university seal depicts a cross and bishop's ring representing the university's Catholic ethos on a shield of black and white, representing the canton of Fribourg. The logo of the university is a blue stylized "F" (with triangles echoing the facade structure of the Miséricorde Building and symbolizing the Alps) and the name of the university in Latin.

==History==
[[File:Brick Hall, Maine State College, Orono, from Robert N. Dennis collection of stereoscopic views.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Brick Hall (1871), later renamed Oak Hall, burned in 1936]]
The University of Maine was founded in 1862 as a function of the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act|Morrill Act]], signed by President [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]]. Established in 1865 as the Maine State College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts, the Maine College opened on September 21, 1868 and changed its name to the University of Maine in 1897.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite book|title=The First Century: A History of the University of Maine, 1865&amp;ndash;1965 |last=Smith |first=David C. |publisher=University of Maine at Orono Press |year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1871, curricula had been organized in Agriculture, Engineering, and electives. The Maine Agricultural and Forest Experiment Station was founded as a division of the university in 1887. Gradually the university developed the Colleges of Life Sciences and Agriculture (later to include the School of Forest Resources and the School of Human Development), Engineering and Science, and Arts and Sciences. In 1912 the Maine Cooperative Extension, which offers field educational programs for both adults and youths, was initiated. The School of Education was established in 1930 and received college status in 1958. The School of Business Administration was formed in 1958 and was granted college status in 1965. Women have been admitted into all curricula since 1872. The first master's degree was conferred in 1881; the first doctor's degree in 1960. Since 1923 there has been a separate graduate school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cutler.umaine.edu/about/history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909055056/http://www.cutler.umaine.edu/about/history.htm |archivedate=2006-09-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:UMaine StevensHall.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Stevens Hall]]
Near the end of the 19th century, the university expanded its curriculum to place greater emphasis on [[liberal arts]]. As a result of this shift, faculty hired during the early 20th century included [[Caroline Colvin]], chair of the history department and the nation's first woman to head a major university department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.honors.umaine.edu/community/the-honors-campus/colvin-hall/caroline-colvin/ |title=The University of Maine - Honors College - Caroline Colvin |publisher=The University of Maine |accessdate=2012-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120801205844/http://www.honors.umaine.edu/community/the-honors-campus/colvin-hall/caroline-colvin/ |archivedate=2012-08-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906, [[The Senior Skull Honor Society]] was founded to "publicly recognize, formally reward, and continually promote outstanding leadership and scholarship, and exemplary citizenship within the University of Maine community."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umaine.edu/orientation/traditions.htm#skull] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724020101/http://www.umaine.edu/orientation/traditions.htm#skull|date=July 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 16, 1925, 80 women met in Balentine Hall {{mdash}} faculty, alumnae, and undergraduate representatives {{mdash}} to plan a pledging of members to an inaugural honorary organization. This organization was called "The All Maine Women" because only those women closely connected with the University of Maine were elected as members. On April 22, 1925, the new members were inducted into the honor society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umainealumni.com/feed.php?num=6&amp;feed_id=51&amp;news_id=157 |title=UMaine Alumni Association |publisher=Umainealumni.com |accessdate=2012-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322024504/http://www.umainealumni.com/feed.php?num=6&amp;feed_id=51&amp;news_id=157 |archivedate=2012-03-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the University of Maine System was incorporated, in 1968, the school was renamed by the legislature over the objections of the faculty to the University of Maine at Orono. This was changed back to the University of Maine in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=State of Maine|title=Maine Legislative Document No. 1027, H.P. 717, 112th Legislature|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization and administration==
The University of Maine is the flagship of the University of Maine System.&lt;ref name="96CHEG"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maine.gov/spo/economics/docs/publications/30and1000.pdf |title=How to Build a Knowledge-based Economy in Maine and Raise Incomes to the National Average by 2010 |publisher=Maine State Planning Office |date=November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maine.edu/pdf/umprescri.pdf |title=Next President}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalog.umaine.edu/content.php?catoid=49&amp;navoid=551 |title=President's Message |publisher=Undergraduate Catalog, University of Maine}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president of the university is [[Joan Ferrini-Mundy]].&lt;ref name="UMaine President"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://umaine.edu/president/|website=Office of the President — UMaine|title=University of Maine Office of the President|accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The senior administration governs cooperatively with the Chancellor of the University of Maine system, [[James H. Page]] and the sixteen members of the University of Maine Board of Trustees (of which fifteen are appointed by the Governor of Maine and one is the current Maine State Commissioner of Education). The Board of Trustees has full legal responsibility and authority for the university system. It appoints the Chancellor and each university President, approves the establishment and elimination of academic programs, confers tenure on faculty members, and sets tuition rates/operating budgets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maine.edu/board/index.php |title=University of Maine System &amp;#124; Board of Trustees |publisher=Maine.edu |date=2012-05-16 |accessdate=2012-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UMaine is also one of a handful of colleges in the United States whose Student Government is incorporated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umaine.edu/handbook/SOrg/student_government.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616155115/http://www.umaine.edu/handbook/SOrg/student_government.htm|date=June 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Student Government was formed in 1978 and incorporated in 1987. It is classified as a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation.&lt;ref name=MEICS&gt;{{cite web|url= http://icrs.informe.org/nei-sos-icrs/ICRS?CorpFilings=19880274ND|title= Corporate Name Search:University of Maine Student Government, Inc.|accessdate= 2009-05-11|publisher = Maine Bureau of Corporations, Elections, and Commissions}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of a legislative branch, which passes resolutions, and an executive branch, which helps organize on-campus entertainment and guest speakers, works with new and existing student organizations, and performs other duties. Other organizations fall under the umbrella of Student Government Inc., including representative boards, community associations, and many other student groups. [[The Maine Campus]], the student newspaper, is also incorporated and does not operate under or receive money from student government.

In 1867, the university rejected a campus plan by landscape architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], who designed Central Park in New York City and the White House grounds in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tclf.org/landscapes/university-maine-orono |title=University of Maine at Orono |publisher=The Cultural Landscape Foundation |accessdate=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magarchive.umaine.edu/issues/v2i4/lasting.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611004249/http://www.magarchive.umaine.edu/issues/v2i4/lasting.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-06-11 |title=The University of Maine - UMaine Today - September / October 2002 - Lasting Impression |publisher=Magarchive.umaine.edu |accessdate=2012-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan's broad concepts, including the Front Lawn, were nevertheless adopted during the school's first fifty years, and were oriented toward the Stillwater River. A second master plan was produced in 1932 by Carl Rust Parker of the [[Olmsted Brothers]] firm, which reoriented the campus center to the Mall, an open grassy area between the [[Raymond H. Fogler Library]] and the Memorial Gym.&lt;ref name=NRHP&gt;National Register nomination for University of Maine at Orono Historic District, 2010 increase; available by request from the Maine State Historic Preservation Office&lt;/ref&gt; The Mall is further bordered by one residence and five academic halls.

The campus is essentially divided into three sections (northern, southern, and hilltop),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umaine.edu/locator/ |title=The University of Maine - Campus Map |publisher=Umaine.edu |accessdate=2012-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; all of which are near or border the Mall. The northern section includes many of the athletic facilities, including the [[Alfond Arena]] (basketball, hockey), [[Alfond Stadium (University of Maine)|Morse Field at the Alfond Sports Stadium]] (football, track and field), [[Larry Mahaney Diamond]] (baseball), Kessock Field (softball), the Field Hockey Complex (field hockey), and the Mahaney athletic/recreational dome. Other buildings on the northern section include the Cutler Health Center, two administrative halls, three residence halls, and multiple academic halls.

The southern section of campus includes the Memorial Student Union, the [[Maynard F. Jordan Observatory]], Lengyel Gymnasium and Athletic Field, the Buchanan Alumni House, as well as multiple administrative, residence, and academic halls. The recently renovated [[Collins Center for the Arts]] is also on the southern part of campus, and not only provides the Hutchins Concert Hall, a 1,435-seat venue for performing artists from around the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collinscenterforthearts.com/pdf/TechnicalInformation.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027004432/http://collinscenterforthearts.com/pdf/TechnicalInformation.pdf |archivedate=2010-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but also houses the [[Hudson Museum]], known for its contemporary [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] art, as well as displays that are culturally specific to the indigenous people of Maine. The Hilltop section of campus is populated largely with residence halls but also includes the {{convert|7|acre|ha|1|adj=on}} Lyle E. Littlefield Ornamental Gardens,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umaine.edu/lhc/ornamental.htm |title=Lyle E. Littlefield Ornamental Gardens ..

The campus is also designated as an [[arboretum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://umaine.edu/about/quick-facts-2/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311224242/https://umaine.edu/about/quick-facts-2/ |archivedate=2016-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-1915 core of the campus, covering its earliest period of development, was listed as a [[historic district (United States)|historic district]] on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1978; this was expanded to include the second major phase of development (through the end of [[World War II]]) in 2010.&lt;ref name=NRHP/&gt;

===Ambulance Service===
[[Image:UVAC AMBULANCE.jpg|thumb|right|200px|One of the University of Maine's ambulances.]]
The University of Maine operates the "University Volunteer Ambulance Corps," an [[Ambulance]] service licensed by the State of Maine. The service is operated by students and staff of the University. UVAC's ambulances are available to respond to emergencies on campus and also provide mutual aid to surrounding towns and agencies. The service ensures a licensed Emergency Medical Technician is sent on every call. The service has two ambulances both equipped to provide [[Paramedic|Paramedic Level]] care. UVAC responds to approximately 500 calls per school year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Sustainability===
The University of Maine is one of 16 colleges and universities listed in ''[[Princeton Review]]'s'' "Green Honor Roll" (2011). Several of the nation's leading research universities, including Virginia Tech, Georgia Tech, Oregon State, Arizona State and the University of Washington are also on that prestigious list, as are Harvard and Northeastern. Recognizing schools for their commitment to sustainability, the Green Honor Roll lists only those 16 institutions that received the highest possible score on ''The Princeton Review'' green rating. The guide lauds UMaine for its recycling programs, green-certified buildings and free shuttle bus service.  It also notes the fact UMaine has a sustainability coordinator, a sustainability council, and "Eco Reps" in its residence halls.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://umaine.edu/news/blog/2011/08/02/princeton-review-fiske-guides-list-umaine-among-nations-best-university-named-to-green-honor-roll/ |title=The University of Maine - UMaine News - Princeton Review, Fiske Guides, Forbes all list UMaine among nation's best; university named to Green Honor Roll |publisher=Umaine.edu |date=2011-08-02 |accessdate=2012-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

University of Maine has a sustainability council made up of students, faculty, administrators, staff and a full-time sustainability coordinator. A green loan fund provides capital for energy efficiency and renewable energy investments.&lt;ref name="Understanding and Mitigating the Environmental Footprint of the University of Maine"&gt;{{cite web| title =Understanding and Mitigating the Environmental Footprint of the University of Maine| publisher =University of Maine| url =http://www.climatechange.umaine.edu/Research/MaineClimate/EnFootprint.html| accessdate =2009-10-09| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://archive.is/20121215055935/http://www.climatechange.umaine.edu/Research/MaineClimate/EnFootprint.html| archivedate =2012-12-15| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university has committed to achieving [[carbon neutrality]] by 2040, and two residential-scale solar thermal systems are in place on Nutting Hall and Sebec House.

==Research==

The University of Maine is one of the National Science Foundation's top 100 public universities for research. In FY10, UMaine exceeded $100 million in external expenditures for research — 86% of which was federal funding. Leading sectors of the university in generating external support are advanced materials, marine sciences, climate change, environmental studies, forestry, precision manufacturing, and aquaculture. Undergraduate research is a priority at UMaine, and in 2008, the Center for Undergraduate Research was established to connect students with faculty projects that suit their interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cugr.umaine.edu/|title=Center for Undergraduate Research {{!}} University of Maine|website=cugr.umaine.edu|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Maine has several research areas that operate as independent units under the umbrella of the University of Maine. While these units house and fund faculty, staff, and students from a variety of academic backgrounds and colleges, the research units are independent of the traditional departmental and college structure. The full list of independent research units at the University of Maine include:

=== UMaine Advanced Structures and Composites Center ===

The [[UMaine Advanced Structures and Composites Center]], founded in 1996 with support from the National Science Foundation, provides research, education, and economic development encompassing material sciences, manufacturing and engineering of composites and structures. The center's research and development projects have included the VolturnUS 1:8, composite arch bridge system, and the Modular Ballistic Protection System (MBPS).

The center is the leading member of the [[DeepCwind Consortium]], whose mission is to establish the State of Maine as a national leader in deepwater offshore wind technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://composites.umaine.edu/our-research/offshore-wind/deepcwind-consortium/|title=DeepCwind Consortium {{!}} Advanced Structures &amp; Composites Center {{!}} University of Maine|website=composites.umaine.edu|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UMaine Deepwater Offshore Wind Test Site at Monhegan Island ===
The University of Maine was granted an ocean energy demonstration site through state legislation in 2009. The site, known as the [[UMaine Deepwater Offshore Wind Test Site]], is available for use by commercial and non-commercial entities in partnership with the university to research and develop ocean energy devices, such as floating wind turbines or wave energy converters.

In 1993, they defeated Lake Superior State University 5-4 behind a third period hat trick by Jim Montgomery. In 1999, they defeated rival [[University of New Hampshire Wildcats|University of New Hampshire]] 3-2 in overtime on a goal by Marcus Gustafsson.&lt;ref name=ESPNFrozenFour&gt;{{cite web|url= http://sports.espn.go.com/ncaa/news/story?page=almanacmenshockey|accessdate= 2009-05-11|title= Frozen Four History|publisher= [[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, the football team competed in the Tangerine Bowl in Orlando, Florida against East Carolina. They were beaten in the game 31-0,&lt;ref name=CapOneBowl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcsports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=60968&amp;SPID=6637&amp;DB_OEM_ID=11300&amp;ATCLID=619680 |accessdate=2009-05-11 |title=Champs Sports Bowl History |publisher=Florida Citrus Sports }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; but remain the only team from Maine to compete in a bowl contest.

The baseball team has participated in seven [[College World Series]], six of them under coach [[John Winkin]] between 1976 and 1986, and one under Jack Butterfield in 1964. The Black Bears achieved two third-place finishes in 1964 and 1982.

Although the official [[fight song]] of UMaine is "For Maine", the school's main spirit song is the better-known "[[The Maine Stein Song|Maine Stein Song]]".  Written by Lincoln Colcord (words) and E. A. Fenstad (music), the tune rose to fame when singer [[Rudy Vallée]] arranged the current version.  Vallee attended Maine from 1921–1922 before transferring to [[Yale University|Yale]], and his popularity helped make the song a national favorite.  To this day, the "Stein Song" remains the only college fight song to ever reach number one on the pop charts, achieving this distinction in 1930.&lt;ref name=top40hits1930&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ntl.matrix.com.br/pfilho/html/top40/1930.html|accessdate= 2009-04-05|title= Top 40 Hits of 1930|publisher= LyricsWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to ''College Fight Songs: An Annotated Anthology'', by Studwell and Schueneman, the "Stein Song" is one of the very best fight songs of all time.&lt;ref name=Studwell&gt;{{cite book|url= https://www.amazon.com/College-Fight-Songs-Annotated-Anthology/dp/0789006650#reader|accessdate= 2009-05-11|title= College Fight Songs: An Annotated Anthology|first= William|last= Studwell|author2=Bruce R.

In addition to varsity athletics, the university offers many club sports through its Campus Recreation department.  Sport clubs represent UMaine by competing against teams and clubs from other universities and colleges. National governing bodies for each club provide competition guidelines and league structure.

Sport clubs are student-led and student-administered. Each has a budget that is run through Campus Recreation, which in part funds nearly all clubs. Clubs are eligible for funding through Campus Recreation after they have been active for at least one year and have a membership minimum of ten members. Current club sports include [[alpine skiing]], [[baseball]], [[Rowing (sport)|crew]], [[cricket]], [[cycling]], fast pitch [[softball]], [[field hockey]], [[golf]], [[ice hockey]], [[lacrosse]], [[nordic skiing]], [[roller hockey]], [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[shotokan karate]], [[soccer]], [[tennis]], [[table tennis]], tackle [[American football|football]], [[ultimate (sport)|ultimate]], and [[volleyball]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umaine.edu/campusrecreation/programs/clubs/clubs_about.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528124056/http://www.umaine.edu/campusrecreation/programs/clubs/clubs_about.html|date=May 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Vatterott College was founded in 1969 in St. Louis, MO by John C. Vatterott Sr.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stltoday.com/travel/travels-with-amy/new-haven-offers-an-art-filled-retreat-close-to-home/article_0076e6aa-67bc-58d1-8efc-b7a95f024a4c.html "New Haven offers an art-filled retreat close to home"]. ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'', April 03, 2015 6:45 am  •  By Amy Bertrand&lt;/ref&gt; The original name was Urban Technical Centers, Inc., and subsequent changes included Vatterott &amp; Sullivan Educational Center and Vatterott Educational Centers.

The institution changed its name to Vatterott College in 1989 when associate degree (specialized) granting authority was issued by the Accrediting Commission of National Association of Trade and Technical Schools (NATTS), which is now called the [[Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges]] (ACCSC).

In January 1985, the institution opened a facility in St. Ann, Missouri.

The college expanded to Springfield, Joplin, and Independence, Missouri, in April 1991 as a result of a teach-out of students attending Draughon Business College. In August 1991, Vatterott College was authorized to establish branch campuses at these locations. In May 1995, Vatterott College expanded to Quincy, Illinois, as a result of the acquisition of the former Quincy Technical Schools.

In June 1996, the Business and Banking Institutes with locations in Omaha, Nebraska, and Des Moines, Iowa, were acquired. Programs were added and the institutions were relocated under the Vatterott brand. In the same year, an additional location of the St. Ann campus opened in Sunset Hills, Missouri. Vatterott College expanded into the following cities as a result of various teach-out agreements: St. Joseph, Missouri, in March 1995; Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1997; Memphis, Tennessee, in 1999; Wichita, Kansas, in 1999; and Cleveland, Ohio in 2001. In 1997, a location was opened in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

In December 1999, Vatterott College expanded in Omaha, Nebraska by acquiring the former Universal Technology Institute. In January 2000, a campus was established in O’Fallon, Missouri. In September 2001, Vatterott College purchased the former Omaha College of Health Careers in Omaha, Nebraska, and established a campus. [[Wellspring Capital Management]] acquired all Vatterott College locations in January 2003 and named the holding company as Vatterott Educational Centers, Inc.

L’Ecole Culinaire, a culinary school located in St. Louis, was opened in 2004. Vatterott College operations expanded into Texas in 2004, acquiring Court Reporting Institute of Dallas and the Court Reporting Institute of Houston. These two campuses are now closed (2015).

In January 2007, Vatterott Education Center located in Dallas, Texas was approved as a branch campus of the Quincy main institution and has since been closed (2014). The Vatterott Career College, Appling Farms (Memphis, TN) location was opened in April 2008. In November 2008, L’École Culinaire, Cordova, Tennessee, was opened. Vatterott College was established in Fairview Heights, Illinois in August, 2009 with seven diploma programs.

In September 2009, [[TA Associates]] acquired Vatterott Educational Centers, Inc. from WellSpring Capital Partners.&lt;ref&gt;''Vatterott Sold to TA Associates'', St. Louis Business Journal, Sept. 21, 2009.  http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/2009/09/21/daily29.html&lt;/ref&gt; That year three executives of the College were convicted of conspiring to obtain federal student grants and loans for students who were not eligible by providing false information and documents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/davidhalperin/for-profit-college-owner_b_8337428.html "For-Profit College Owner, Who Used Strippers As Lure, Goes On Trial"]. ''Huffington Post'', October 20, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The O’Fallon, Missouri, location relocated in the fall of 2010 to a  renovated building in St. Charles, MO. The Court Reporting Institute opened a campus in Arlington, Virginia, in December 2011 and was closed within one year after opening.

"ex’Treme Institute by Nelly", a music recording and production school, was opened in St. Louis Missouri in December, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;''Nelly's Ex'Treme Institute now open to students,'' KSDK-TV. http://www.ksdk.com/news/article/288651/3/Nellys-music-school-now-open-to-students&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Nelly to Open Production School in St. Louis,'' BET.com, Nov. 27, 2011. http://www.bet.com/news/music/2011/11/27/nelly-to-open-production-school-in-st-louis.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Pamela Bell is the former CEO of Vatterott Educational Centers, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;''Vatterott College Names Bell CEO'', St. Louis Business Journal, June 25, 2007. http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/2007/06/25/daily4.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the college was sued by a student who claimed that she was misled that her credits from the college would be transferable toward a nursing certificate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article1303067.html "Appeals court upholds student's case against Vatterott College"]. ''Kansas City Star'',  August 26, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kctv5.com/story/22634184/vatterott-college-told-to-pay-belton-woman-13-million "Vatterott College told to pay Belton woman $13 million"]. ''KCTV News5'',  Jun 19, 2013 Chris Oberholtz, Amy Anderson and DeAnn Smith&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, Brian Carroll, president of the college's Kansas City campus for the previous five years, was fired by the school because he allowed a homeless student to sleep in the library on a night where temperatures fell to -4 degrees Fahrenheit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fox5sandiego.com/2017/01/17/trade-school-fires-president-after-he-gave-homeless-student-shelter-in-library-during-sub-zero-weather/ "Trade school fires president after he let homeless student stay in library during sub-zero weather"], ''Fox 5 San Diego'', January 17, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''XF''' is a [[grade (education)#The A-F system|letter grade]] used at some [[United States|U.S.]] [[colleges]], to denote either students who withdraw from a course after the refund period has lapsed &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uwrf.edu/esis/NonAttendanceGradeReporting.htm UWRF]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pitt.edu/~registrar/grdPgGrades.htm UPitt ]&lt;/ref&gt; or who are caught performing acts of [[academic dishonesty]]. This was intended to make it evident from the transcript why the failing grade was assigned, though critics&lt;ref&gt;[https://walkingstick.tesu.edu/WebAdvisor/WebAdvisor?TOKENIDX=5595040900&amp;TYPE=M&amp;PID=CORE-WBMAIN TESU: Understanding Your Transcript (internal link)]&lt;/ref&gt; have pointed to inconsistent grading schema among universities issuing XF grades.  The '''XF''' variation is also used by at least one institution to indicate a student who has failed a course due to non-attendance.&lt;ref&gt;University of Wisconsin - River Falls - [http://www.uwrf.edu/esis/NonAttendanceGradeReporting.htm NonAttendance Grade (XF) Reporting]&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest instance of the XF grade occurred at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], and XFs have been assigned for plagiarists at [[Kansas State University]] since 2000.  [[Pennsylvania State University]] and [[East Carolina University]] have also recently adopted the practice.  At Kansas, students with XF grades may have the grade changed to a regular "F" by enrolling in an [[academic integrity]] course.

Students at [[Wichita State University]], who did not wish for "F"s on their transcript to be mistaken for academic dishonesty, requested adoption of the XF by their university. Students at [[Thomas Edison State University]] requested that XF grades gained from missing the withdrawal deadline be omitted from official transcripts, leading to a policy change within the university.&lt;ref&gt;[https://walkingstick.tesu.edu/WebAdvisor/WebAdvisor?TOKENIDX=5595040900&amp;TYPE=M&amp;PID=CORE-WBMAIN TESU: Understanding Your Transcript (internal link)]&lt;/ref&gt; This is notable in that the discussion was sparked, in part, by inconsistent grading policies among universities issuing XF grades.
