'''Ann Gloag''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (born '''Ann Heron Souter'''; 10 December 1942, in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]]) is a Scottish business woman and charity campaigner. She is co-founder of the international transport company [[Stagecoach Group]].

==Biography==
Educated at Caledonian Road Primary School and [[Perth High School]], she qualified as a nurse , and during a 20-year career worked as a burn unit sister. She is ranked as Scotland's richest woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/scotgaz/people/famousfirst527.html|title=Overview of Ann Heron Gloag|publisher=Scottish-places.info|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stagecoach===
Using her father's redundancy money, and working with her brother [[Brian Souter|Sir Brian Souter]] and her first husband [[Robin Gloag]], Gloag established the Stagecoach Group in 1980, running buses from Dundee to London. Expansion continued and in the early 1990s, Stagecoach acquired National Bus Company operations in Cumberland, Hampshire, East Midlands, Ribble, Southdown and the United Counties. Stagecoach bought further bus operations in Scotland, Newcastle and London, with Manchester being added in 1993.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Manston Airport===
In November 2013, Gloag took ownership of [[Kent International Airport]], also known as [[Manston Airport]] for the sum of [[Pound sterling|£1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-24532999|title=Manston Airport sold to Stagecoach founder for £1|website=Bbc.co.uk|date=15 October 2013|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gloag's co-director is [[Pauline Bradley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pauline Bradley|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=29536681&amp;privcapId=13705047|title=Pauline Bradley: Executive Profile|website=Investing.businessweek.com|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a corporate lawyer and former head of joint ventures at [[Bank of Scotland]], described by the Scottish Herald as "''one of Scotland's most powerful women''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/head-of-joint-ventures-at-bos-quits-to-join-kenmore-1.65525|title=Head of joint ventures at BoS quits to join Kenmore|publisher=Herald Scotland|date=19 January 2005|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite assurances to staff regarding long term investment in the airport,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/news/local/ann-gloag-believes-1-manston-airport-will-take-off-1.142397%20] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521012433/http://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/news/local/ann-gloag-believes-1-manston-airport-will-take-off-1.142397%20|date=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; management announced a consultation on closure in April 2014.

Uncertainty about the airport's future led flight operators who were using Manston to leave, notably [[KLM]] who ran a twice daily service to [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Amsterdam Schiphol]]. A number of bids were forthcoming during the consultation period to buy and run the airport,&lt;ref name="kentonline1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Price|first=Chris|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kent-business/county-news/dramatic-last-minute-offer-for-17318|title=Manston airport: Dramatic last-minute offer to buy Thanet site by US group RiverOak rejected as staff leave for last time|publisher=Kentonline.co.uk|date=15 May 2014|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but on 15 May 2014 Manston was closed with the loss of 144 jobs in the airport and an unknown number in the surrounding area. Gloag did not appear publicly or give a reason for the airport's closure or her refusal to sell. The [[trade union]] Unite said it would challenge the way the consultation on closure was conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/10813475/Manston-Airport-closure-bizarre-says-union.html|title=Manston Airport closure 'bizarre', says union|publisher=Telegraph|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Gale|Sir Roger Gale]], [[Member of Parliament]] for [[North Thanet (UK Parliament constituency)|Thanet North]], described Gloag's actions as an act of "corporate vandalism".&lt;ref name="kentonline1"/&gt;

{{As of|2016}}, Gale and pressure groups including ''Save Manston Airport'' and ''Why Not Manston?'' continue to campaign for the reopening of the airport and have opposed alternative uses. In May 2014, then [[Prime Minister of the UK|prime minister]] [[David Cameron]], in answer to a question from Gale in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|Houses of Commons]], stated that the future of Manston was the responsibility of the airport owner, but the Government was in negotiation with Mrs Gloag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140514/debtext/140514-0001.htm|title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 14 May 2014 (pt 0001)|publisher=Publications.parliament.uk|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017 planning inspectors rejected an appeal stating that the site was protected for aviation use under EC4 regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kentnews.co.uk/business/war-of-words-continues-as-planning-chiefs-refuse-change-of-use-of-buildings-at-manston-airport-1-5106233|title=War of words continues as planning chiefs refuse change of use of buildings at Manston airport|first=Tom|last=Pyman|website=Kentnews.co.uk|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Gloag has owned [[Beaufort Castle, Scotland|Beaufort Castle]] near [[Inverness]] since 1995, and [[Kinfauns Castle]], near [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] since 2004. She has attempted to block off private access at Kinfauns in a high-profile case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=819912006|title=The Scotsman|publisher=Thescotsman.scotsman.com|date=2 June 2006|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/tayside_and_central/5040326.stm|work=BBC News|title=Tycoon launches court access bid|date=2 June 2006|accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 June 2007 she was successful in gaining a court ruling that she was legally entitled to bar the public from a swath of woodland in the grounds of Kinfauns Castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Severin|last=Carrell|title=Multimillionaire uses financial muscle to bar ramblers from woods|url=https://www.theguardian.com/country/article/0,,2102624,00.html|work=The Guardian|date=14 June 2007|accessdate=14 June 2007|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her ex-husband, [[Robin Gloag]], was killed in a car crash on 6 December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/tayside_and_central/7130178.stm|title=Gloag's ex-husband dies in crash|publisher=BBC News|date=6 December 2007|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their son, Jonathan, killed himself in 1999, aged 28.&lt;ref name=scotsman&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/saturday-profile-brian-souter-1-595815|title=Saturday Profile: Brian Souter|publisher=[[The Scotsman]]|date=2 February 2002 |accessdate=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Company History ==
BenevolentAI was founded in November 2013 by Ken Mulvany&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lunden |first1=Ingrid |title=BenevolentAI, which uses AI to develop drugs and energy solutions, nabs $115M at $2B valuation |url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/18/benevolentai-which-uses-ai-to-develop-drugs-and-energy-solutions-nabs-115m-at-2b-valuation/ |website=TechCrunch |publisher=TechCrunch |accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Initially the company focussed on the development of a cross functional AI technology to incorporate basic science, chemistry and clinical components and designed that could ingest, read and contextualise the world’s available bioscience information&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=BenevolentAI |title=BenevolentAI Raises $115 Million to Extend Its Leading Global Position in the Field of AI Enabled Drug Development |url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/benevolentai-raises-115-million-to-extend-its-leading-global-position-in-the-field-of-ai-enabled-drug-development-680180573.html |website=PR Newswire |publisher=Cision |accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Throughout the course of 2014 and 2015 the technology was further developed to also reason and propose hypotheses to treat disease. By 2015, the company had raised $87 million in funding, including investors like Woodford Investment Management and Lansdowne Partners&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Taylor |first1=Nick Paul |title= MedTech BenevolentAI bags $115M to fuel AI-enabled R&amp;D push |url=https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/benevolentai-bags-115m-to-fuel-ai-enabled-r-d-push |website=Fierce Biotech |publisher=Questex |accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2015 BenevolentAI began to fully apply its technology to drug discovery and development and announced the appointment of Jackie Hunter to lead bioscience research at the company&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=BenevolentAI |title=BenevolentAI, the pioneering London-based company using artificial intelligence to advance pharmaceutical development, appoints head of BBSRC as new Chief Executive |url=https://benevolent.ai/news/announcements/benevolentai-appoints-jackie-hunter-as-ceo-of-benevolentbio |website=BenevolentAI |publisher=BenevolentAI |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

2017 saw the company file its first Investigational New Drug (IND) application. In February 2018, BenevolentAI acquired a Cambridge research facility in order to expand its capabilities across the entire drug discovery process. Two months later the company announced a further round of funding for $115 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Reuters |title=AI drug hunter BenevolentAI worth $2 billion after fund raising |url=https://www.euronews.com/2018/04/19/ai-drug-hunter-benevolentai-worth-2-billion-after-fund-raising |website=EuroNews |publisher=EuroNews |accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== BenevolentAI Award ==
In 2017 BenevolentAI announced the creation of the BenevolentAI Award, in partnership with the Association of Medical Research Charities. The award is given to a single applicant a year, allowing the winner to access the company’s technology to accelerate their medical research using artificial intelligence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Annual award announced for medical research charities wishing to benefit from artificial intelligence |url=https://benevolent.ai/news/announcements/medical-ai-award-sets-its-sights-on-treating-parkinsons |website=BenevolentAI |publisher=BenevolentAI |accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The winner of the 2018 award was a collaboration between the Parkinson’s UK and The Cure Parkinson’s Trust.

Black Cube’s main business is "litigation support", in which the company provides intelligence, evidence and advisory services in multi-jurisdictional legal and criminal cases.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Black Cube's tactics have resulted in a number of international controversies. In Romania, two of its employees were convicted of criminal charges involving harassment and hacking.&lt;ref name=RomaniaInsider/&gt;&lt;ref name=ToI/&gt;

==Notable projects==
Beginning in 2011, Black Cube provided intelligence services to [[Vincent Tchenguiz]] in a number of cases, including Tchenguiz’s fight against the UK Serious Fraud Office,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; following his arrest as part of the SFO investigation into the collapse of the Icelandic bank [[Kaupthing]].&lt;ref&gt;Business Desk [https://www.bbc.com/news/business-12688072 "Robert and Vincent Tchenguiz arrested in Iceland probe"] "BBC" 10 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Black Cube analysed the network of relationships surrounding the collapse of the bank,&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; and helped build a successful challenge to the SFO arrests and search warrants, causing the judge to declare the SFO’s actions unlawful in 2013.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://e.forbes.co.il/behind-closed-doors-first-peek-into-the-israeli-company-that-captivates-global-interest/ |title=Inside Black Cube - The "Mossad" of the Business World - Forbes Israel |date=13 November 2017 |work=Forbes Israel|access-date=13 February 2018 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this investigation the SFO was ordered by the court to pay over £3m to Tchenguiz in 2014, and to issue a formal apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.sfo.gov.uk/2014/07/25/serious-fraud-office-vincent-tchenguiz-announce-settlement-civil-claims/ |title=The Serious Fraud Office and Vincent Tchenguiz announce settlement of civil claims |date=25 July 2014 |website=Serious Fraud Office|access-date=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ft.com/content/e0133cf6-cd66-11e4-9144-00144feab7de |title=Subscribe to read |website=Financial Times |language=en-GB|access-date=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2014, Black Cube were hired by Israeli businessman [[Nochi Dankner]], to examine a court decision assigning control of IDB Holding Corp. Ltd. (TASE:IDBH) to Motti Ben Moshe.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Black Cube investigated the sources of capital of Ben Moshe, revealing an ongoing investigation by German regulatory authorities into Ben Moshe’s company ExtraEnergy,&lt;ref&gt;Efrat Peretz, [http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-dankner-german-regulator-probing-ben-moshe-1000913719 "Dankner: German regulator probing Ben-Moshe"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626151616/http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-dankner-german-regulator-probing-ben-moshe-1000913719 |date=26 June 2015 }} "Globes" 30 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and locating a witness who held evidence of money laundering and tax evasion by Ben Moshe.&lt;ref&gt;Efrat Peretz, [http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-dankner-accuses-ben-moshe-of-money-laundering-1000924326 "Dankner accuses Ben-Moshe of money laundering"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626144234/http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-dankner-accuses-ben-moshe-of-money-laundering-1000924326 |date=26 June 2015 }} "Globes" 13 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Black Cube was hired to assist [[Kfar Giladi|Kfar Gildai]] Quarries in their highly publicised dispute with Caeserstone (NASDAQ:CSTE). Black Cube engaged a Caesarstone engineer in conversation during a group bicycle trip in Kfar Giladi.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; In the recording, the engineer contradicted the allegations that were made by Ceaserstone in the arbitration proceeding with Kfar Giladi. After six years of deliberations, Judge Boaz Okun ordered Caeserstone to pay more than $14m as compensation to Kfar Giladi. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-caesarstone-to-pay-kfar-giladi-nis-50m-compensation-1001220457 |title=CaesarStone to pay Kfar Giladi NIS 50m compensation - Globes English |last= |first= |date= |website=Globes |language=English|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Black Cube assisted Taiwanese businessman [[Nobu Su]], owner of the shipping company TMT, in his efforts to gain permission to appeal a 2014 judgement in favour of Lakatamia Shipping &lt;ref&gt;Unknown Author, [http://en.acnnewswire.com/press-release/english/19779/nobu-su-fights-back-against-lakatamia "Nobu Su Fights Back Against Lakatamia"] "ACN Newswire" 9 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; in which Su was found personally liable for the amount of almost $47m.&lt;ref&gt;Unknown Author, [http://www.tradewindsnews.com/weekly/348219/UK-judge-declares-Nobu-Su-personally-liable-for-37.9m "Gone to the dogs?"] "Tradewinds" 7 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Black Cube delivered intelligence to Su’s legal team showing that 20% of the judgement amount was due to a company called Slagen Shipping, which had ceased operations at the time of the establishment of the claim, thereby rendering it unable to act as a claimant, both reducing the quantum of the judgement significantly, and causing the appeal to be granted.&lt;ref&gt;Japan Corporate News, [http://www.nasdaq.com/article/headway-for-nobu-su-20150414-00262 "Headway for Nobu Su"] "Nasdaq" 14 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Black Cube was involved in exposing bribery and corruption in a set of Italian arbitrations between [[AmTrust Financial Services|AmTrust]] (NASDAQ:AFSI) and an Italian named Antonio Somma totalling €2bn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-14/bullets-secret-tapes-and-bribery-claim-in-suit-against-italians |title=When Doing Business in Italy Means a Box of Bullets in the Mail |date=14 April 2016 |work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=13 February 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Somma admitted to the company's undercover agents that he could control the arbitration panels,&lt;ref&gt;Corriere della Sera, [http://www.corriere.it/digital-edition/CORRIEREFC_NAZIONALE_WEB/2016/04/14/25/il-lodo-da-2-miliardi-in-tribunale-corruzione-o-calunnia-per-larbitro_U43170723463763HLG.shtml "Il lodo da 2 miliardi in Tribunale Corruzione o calunnia per l’arbitro"] 14 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and that he had an agreement to pay the chair of the arbitration panel 10% of any money they awarded him.&lt;ref&gt;B1, [http://www.b1.ro/stiri/externe/black-cube-dezvaluie-cel-mai-mare-caz-de-coruptie-judiciara-din-italia-146717.html "Black Cube dezvăluie cel mai mare caz de corupție judiciară din Italia"] 16 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Following Black Cube's findings, the arbitrator was dismissed and in July 2016, the two sides reached a settlement on the total of 60 million euros instead of the initial 2 billion euro claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.ilcorrierino.com/pace-milionaria-salvo-il-broker-antonio-somma/1857.html |title=Pace milionaria, salvo il broker Antonio Somma - Transazione tra AmTrust e l'assicuratore stabiese con un giro di affari all'estero |work=Il Corrierino|access-date=30 May 2018 |language=it-IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Black Cube was hired by [[Rami Levy Hashikma Marketing|Rami Levy]], the owner of Rami Levy Chain Stores Hashikma Marketing (TASE:RMLI) who is considered a champion of low prices in Israel,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://jewishbusinessnews.com/2013/04/28/who-is-rami-levy-and-why-do-investors-love-him-the-most/ |title=Who is Rami Levy and why investors love him |website=Jewish Business News|access-date=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to verify his suspicions that he was being targeted by a rival chain in a negative media campaign. Black Cube provided Levy with evidence that the PR agent who worked for Levy's competitor, Victory supermarket chain, exposed the negative campaign that they carried out aimed at damaging Levy's public reputation. Levy later used those materials in a lawsuit against his competitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://haaretz.com/israel-news/business/.premium-1.717297 |title=Rami Levy allegedly targeted by rival chain in negative media campaign - Business |website=haaretz.com|access-date=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, [[Alstom]] (EPA:ALO) and Afcon (TASE:AFHL) hired Black Cube’s services in order to assist them with their dispute against the Israel Railways’ electrification bid, which the Spanish company SEMI won. Black Cube presented recordings of officials from the Israel Railway discussing malfunctions that occurred in the bid. Based on these findings, in January 2018, the Superior Court in Israel issued an agreement of compromise according to which the work on the railway will be divided between all three of the companies and that Black Cube’s clients’ work will be priced at 580 million NIS, after they originally lost the bid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.enr.com/articles/42365-israel-high-court-splits-disputed-500m-rail-power-contract?v=preview |title=Israel High Court Splits Disputed $500M Rail Power Contract|access-date=14 February 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Gefen Biomed (TASE:GEFEN) filed a NIS 60 million lawsuit which claims that entrepreneurs Moshe (Mori) Arkin and others deliberately misled or deceived minority shareholders in biomed company cCam Biotherapeutics. The lawsuit is based on evidence collected by Black Cube, which conducted recorded interviews with key figures in cCam that prove a deliberate and systematic attempt to conceal exit talks with [[Merck &amp; Co.|Merck]] (NYSE:MRK) for up to $625 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://services.globes.co.il/en/article-lawsuit-claims-mori-arkin-misled-ecams-minority-shareholders-1001180305 |title=Lawsuit claims Arkin misled eCam shareholders - Globes English |website=Globes |language=he|access-date=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specialising in Asset Tracing and analysis of offshore companies and trusts, Black Cube was hired by [[Bank Hapoalim]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-black-cube-the-mossad-style-business-intelligence-company-1001183611 |title=Black Cube - a "Mossad-style" business intelligence co - Globes English |website=Globes |language=he|access-date=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (TASE: POLI) to trace the assets of Motti Zisser, who left behind a high debt to the bank. Black Cube provided intelligence of many assets in Europe which were transferred from Mr. Zisser to his son David through a sophisticated network of shell companies. Networks of hotels in Brussels, a hotel and mall district in Amsterdam, apartments in Strasbourg and a company in Hong Kong were located, among others. As a result of the intelligence gathered by Black Cube, Bank Hapoalim was granted an injunction that applies an effective freeze on all the companies of the Zisser Family. At the end of a legal process, the two parties came to a settlement in February 2018, according to which Zisser’s heirs would pay nearly 95 million NIS to Bank Hapoalim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-zissers-heirs-to-pay-hapoalim-nis-95m-after-black-cube-uncovers-assets-1001224055 |title=Zisser’s heirs to pay Hapoalim NIS 95m after Black Cube uncovers assets - Globes English |website=Globes |language=he|access-date=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Black Cube filed a lawsuit in the UK against Vincent Tchenguiz for unpaid invoices and breach of contract. Concurrently, Tchenguiz filed a lawsuit in Israel against Black Cube, alleging fraudulent invoices, an allegation denied by Black Cube. Both lawsuits were dropped in a settlement agreement, the details of which are undisclosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Simon |last=Bowers, |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/apr/22/vincent-tchenguiz-settles-black-cube-dispute |title=Vincent Tchenguiz settles Black Cube legal dispute |work=The Guardian |date=22 April 2013 |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, two of the company employees were arrested in Bucharest on suspicions of spying, phishing and cyber harassing the chief prosecutor of the Romanian [[National Anticorruption Directorate]], [[Laura Codruța Kövesi]] and people close to her.  The two employees were eventually convicted on charges of hacking and harassment.&lt;ref name="RomaniaInsider"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.romania-insider.com/israeli-citizen-gets-probation-after-pleading-guilty-in-espionage-case-in- |title=Israeli citizen gets probation after pleading guilty in espionage case in Romania}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ToI"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-convicted-for-targeting-romanias-anti-corruption- |title=Israeli convicted for targeting Romania’s anti-corruption chief}}&lt;/ref&gt; After sentencing, the company reached an understanding with the Romanian authorities and the two employees were released and returned to Israel after a few months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-black-cube-the-mossad-style-business-intelligence-company-1001183611 |title=Black Cube - a "Mossad-style" business intelligence co |website=Globes |language=he|access-date=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the arrest, Black Cube denied any wrongdoing, saying that they were working under contract from the highest political powers in Bucharest and that "all of Black Cube’s employees follow local law to the letter, and the allegations against them are unfounded and untrue".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.algemeiner.com/2016/04/06/report-claims-romania-investigating-4-israelis-for-spying/# "Report Claims Romania Investigating 4 Israelis for Spying"] "Algemeiner" 6 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The Romanian government and Romanian Police denied the existence of any such contract.&lt;ref&gt;[[Attila Somfalvi]], Itamar Eichner [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4788160,00.html "Employees of Israeli business intelligence firm Black Cube is suspected of spying on the director of Romania's Anticorruption Directorate; company denies allegations."] "Israel News" 9 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, [[Ronan Farrow]] reported in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' that film executive [[Harvey Weinstein]] hired Black Cube in order to stop the publication of the abuse allegations against him. Using false identities, private investigators from Black Cube tracked and met journalists and actresses, in particular [[Rose McGowan]], who later publicly accused Weinstein of rape. Over the course of a year, Weinstein had Black Cube and other agencies "target, or collect information on, dozens of individuals, and compile psychological profiles that sometimes focussed on their personal or sexual histories."&lt;ref&gt;Ronan Farrow, Harvey Weinstein’s Army of Spies. ''New Yorker'' 6 November 2017 https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/harvey-weinsteins-army-of-spies&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Weinstein Hired ex-Mossad Agents to Track Women Accusing Him of Sexual Assault.

In November 2017, Black Cube set up a fake recruitment firm, and flew an employee and a former employee of a hedge fund company to London for fake job interviews, in order to gain proprietary information about the hedge fund, according to ''[[The New York Times]]''. Black Cube refused to comment. In New York State, private investigators are required to be licensed, but the Times couldn't find a record of a license for Black Cube or B.C. Strategy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/business/deception-and-ruses-fill-the-toolkit-of-investigators-used-by-weinstein.html Deception and Ruses Fill the Toolkit of Investigators Used by Weinstein].

In March 2018, Black Cube and [[Cambridge Analytica]] each denied a Cambridge Analytica ex-employee’s statement that the company had hired Black Cube's services. In April 2018, Brittany Kaiser, a senior manager at Cambridge Analytica affirmed the denials and testified in front of the British Parliament that Black Cube is not the company they worked with.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/culture-media-and-sport/Brittany%20Kaiser%20Parliamentary%20testimony%20FINAL.pdf |title=Written testimony to the Fake News Inquiry |author=Brittany Kaiser|access-date=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://sputniknews.com/science/201804171063653258-cambridge-analytica-testimony-facebook-kaiser/ |title='There Were Chinese Walls': Ex-Cambridge Analytica Employee Testifies |last=Sputnik |website=sputniknews.com |language=en|access-date=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, Black Cube was accused of using false identities to seek damaging information about former Obama administration officials and help the Trump administration undermine the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|Iran nuclear deal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/israeli-operatives-that-aided-harvey-weinstein-collected-information-on-former-obama-administration-officials |title=Israeli Operatives Who Aided Harvey Weinstein Collected Information on Former Obama Administration Officials |last=Farrow |first=Ronan |date=6 May 2018 |work=The New Yorkers|access-date=7 May 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black Cube has responded by stating that it has no relation to the Trump administration, to Trump aides or to the Iran nuclear deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/more-details-on-israeli-spy-firm-ops-against-ex-obama-aides-revealed-1.6061080 |title=More Details on Israeli Spy Firm Black Cube's 'Ops Against ex-Obama Officials' Revealed |last=Tibon |first=Amir |date=7 May 2018 |work=Haaretz|access-date=7 May 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2018, ''[[The New Yorker]]'' connected Black Cube's research to a memo which circulated in the Trump White House in early 2017 and alleged that former Obama officials were conspiring with reporters "to undermine President Trump's foreign policy" to save [[Obamacare]] and the Iran deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Entous |first1=Adam |last2=Farrow |first2=Ronan |url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-conspiracy-memo-aimed-at-obama-aides-that-circulated-in-the-trump-white-house |title=The Conspiracy Memo About Obama Aides That Circulated in the Trump White House |work=The New Yorker |date=23 August 2018 |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Broadcast_Electronics_FM_Transmitter.jpg|200px|thumb|A Broadcast Electronics transmitter installed at [[WHJY]] in Providence, RI]]
'''Broadcast Electronics''' (BE) is a manufacturer of AM and FM [[transmitter]]s, Marti Electronics STL and [[Remote pickup unit|RPU]] equipment, developer of the AudioVAULT radio automation system and parent company to Commotion - a social media company for radio.

Founded in 1959 in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]], BE initially manufactured endless loop cartridge "[[Fidelipac|cart]]" machines. Through the years, BE also manufactured [[phonograph|turntables]], [[Mixing console|audio consoles]], and program automation equipment which was the precursor to today’s [[Broadcast automation|automation systems]] for radio stations.

In 1977, BE relocated to [[Quincy, Illinois]] and it was there that BE began designing and manufacturing FM and AM [[transmitter]]s.  Initially the offering was for tube transmitters but their line also expanded to solid state broadcast transmitters.

The AudioVAULT automation system was one of the first [[digital audio]] storage and [[playout]] solutions for radio. AudioVAULT compensated for the slow PC processing speeds at the time by manufacturing their own [[sound card]]s and using off-bus technology. Today, AudioVAUL is in its 4th generation architecture since the time the technology was known as a "[[Fidelipac|cart]]" machine replacement product.

In 1994, BE acquired [[MARTI Electronics]]. Today, Marti Electronics equipment is also manufactured in Quincy, Illinois.

BE is the largest radio only equipment manufacturer in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://bdcast.com/about-us/ |title =About Us |accessdate = 2015-06-22 |author = Broadcast Electronics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4592">The term '''business operating system''' ('''BOS''') refers to standard, enterprise-wide collection of [[business process]]es used in many diversified industrial companies. The definition has also been extended to include the common structure, principles and practices necessary to drive the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Hope Is Not a Strategy | author = Ted Gee | page = 85 | publisher = Dog Ear | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-1-59858-767-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diversified industrial companies like [[Ingersoll Rand]], [[Honeywell]], and [[Danaher Corporation|Danaher]] have adopted a standard, common collection of business processes and/or [[business process management|business process improvement methodologies]] which they use to manage strategy development and execution. In the case of [[Danaher]], the business system is a core part of the company's culture, is seen as one of the key drivers of corporate performance, and is therefore a differentiator for shareholders and prospective employees.

The objectives of such systems are to ensure daily work is focused on the organisation's strategic objectives and is done in the most efficient way. The systems deal with the questions "why" (purpose of the work), "what" (specific objectives of the work) and "how" (the processes used to do the work). The Toyota Production System is focused on both how to make cars, and how to improve the way cars are made. A third objective can also be added, which is to improve the business system itself by identifying or improving the component tools and techniques.

== Terminology. ==
Terms used to describe such systems include:
* XPS - meaning “Company-specific Production System" with the X standing in place of the company name
* Business System
* Management Operating System

== Examples of business operating systems ==
* [[Toyota]]'s [[Toyota Production System]] (TPS) is one of the earliest examples, developed between 1948 and 1975
* [[Danaher]] is well known for its Danaher Business System (DBS)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.danaher.com/how-we-work/danaher-business-system&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fortive]] (a company that split from Danaher in 2016) has the Fortive Business System (FBS) which is derived from the DBS&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fortive.com/fortive-business-system&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ingersoll Rand]] established the Ingersoll Rand business operating system (BOS) to describe the six enterprise focus areas and its process improvement method ([[Lean Six Sigma]]).
* [[Honeywell]] has the Honeywell Operating System (HOS)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.honeywell.com/who-we-are/our-initiatives/hos-gold&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Idex Corporation]] has the Idex Operating Model &lt;ref&gt;http://www.idexcorp.com/about/about_strategy.asp&lt;/ref&gt;
* [http://www.etw.com/ ETW (Execute to Win)]
* Bosch Production System
* Boeing Production System
* Audi Production System
* Lego Production System
* John Deere Quality and Production System
* Alcoa Business System
* REC Production System
* Electrolux Manufacturing System
* Novo Nordisk - "cLEAN” 
* Trumpf - “Synchro”
* Magellan Operating System ([[Magellan Aerospace]])

== List of common features ==
Many of business operating systems share common features. This is because the systems are derived from other known systems, and from established methods and practices for business management. The following is a list of features that appear in several systems.
* Hoshin Kanri, a strategic planning methodology developed by [[Yoji Akao]], used to create goals, assign them measurable milestones, and assess progress against those milestones (Hoshin Kanri is also referred to as Policy Deployment or X-Matrix)
* Standard work - the best and most reliable methods and sequences for each work process which is used as the basis for sustaining improvements
* Process improvement methodologies: [[Lean Six Sigma|Lean]], [[Six Sigma]], and [[Kaizen]] are popular approaches incorporated in business systems 
* [[Just-in-time manufacturing|Just-in-time]] manufacturing
* [[Gemba]] walks
* Jidoka - "automation with a human touch" where human intervention is used to improve machine performance
* Visual controls or visual management where management processes (e.g. checking) use simple graphics to show problems at a glance
* Problem solving techniques such as [[root cause analysis]]
* Technology: While these standard business operating systems may inform or be linked to a company's technology platform, they more commonly refer to the way the company manages complex business processes in a common way across its diverse portfolio of businesses.

[[File:April 2013 to March 2014 Import commodities from India, by percent value in US$.png|thumb|Indian commodity imports in US$]]
In the field of [[economics]], the '''[[commodity]] value''' of a [[economic good|good]] is its [[free market]] [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] under optimal use conditions. In a free market, the commodity value of a good will be reflected by its price. For example, if an acre of land can yield a net of 100 dollars loss by lying [[fallow]], 50 dollars gain by being planted with corn, and 100 dollars gain by being planted with wheat, then that acre's commodity value is 100 dollars; the farmer is assumed to put his land to best use. The price of a commodity fluctuates around its commodity value.&lt;ref name="cam"&gt;{{cite book |title=Consumption and Management: New Discovery and Applications |last=Wu |first=Bingxin |year=2011 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=9781908818072 |url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pIpwAgAAQBAJ |accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Currency ==
A commodity value expressed as a [[price]] is determined by historical, social and cultural aspects of production and distribution.&lt;ref name="macu"&gt;{{cite book |title=Material Culture in America: Understanding Everyday Life |last=Sheumaker |first=Helen |author2=Shirley Teresa Wajda |year=2008 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=9781576076477 |page=299 |url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JjVlAzj9qDQC |accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Karl Marx]] described price as the money-name for the [[Labour economics|labour]] realised in a commodity.&lt;ref name="caac"&gt;{{cite book |title=Capital: A Critique of Political Economy - The Process of Capitalist Production |last=Marx |first=Karl |year=2007 |publisher=Cosimo, Inc |isbn=9781605200064 |page=114 |url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sxQl44nJmjwC |accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A commodity value is dependent on its [[utility]].&lt;ref name="tvom"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Value of Money |last=Anderson |first=B. M. |year=1922 |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |isbn=9781610162777 |page=15 |url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PzrKq7x06MQC |accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commodity value is of particular significance in the study of currency. For example, the commodity value of a coin is the value of the metal of which it is made. Gold and silver coins have a high commodity value, whereas [[fiat money|fiat]] coins such as modern day [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarters]] have a low commodity value. This is of particular historical relevance when analyzed in light of [[Gresham's Law]].

Because money becomes valuable not due to its substance, that is, its commodity value, but rather because of its performance, currencies tend to become [[token money|token]].&lt;ref name="ncsp"&gt;{{cite book |title=Nature, Choice and Social Power |last=Schoenberger |first=Erica |year=2014 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=1135051585 |page=98 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=TO5TBAAAQBAJ |accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Debt ==
[[Asset]] backed [[debt]] has a commodity value equal to the price of the [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]]; a loan backed by a house has a commodity value equal to the free market price of the house. Non-collateralized debt, on the other hand, does not have a commodity value; it is valuable only insofar as it is repaid.

== Investment ==
Commodity value is an important consideration in hedging against [[inflation]]. Whereas fiat currencies can devalue, often [[hyperinflation|catastrophically]], currencies with considerable commodity value are known to better maintain their value; a government can print as many fiat bills as it wants with relative ease, the same is not true of mining [[precious metals]]. This leads some investors to purchase goods and debts with high commodity value, which are inherently safer than those with low, or no commodity value, minimizing risk by sacrificing potential return.

'''Sir Douglas Lynch''', [[Knight or Dame of St. Andrew (Barbados)|KA]], [[Order of St Michael and St George|CMG]], [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] (1926 – 12 April 2016) was a [[Barbados|Barbadian]] retired businessman and lawyer, former member of the [[Privy Council]] of Barbados and a director of the [[Central Bank of Barbados]].

Sir Douglas was the first person to be formally admitted to the party,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=30 years and onward: in celebration of the thirtieth anniversary |page=6 |year=1985 |publisher=[[Democratic Labour Party (Barbados)|Democratic Labour Party]] |oclc=13519235 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and himself stood for election, but was defeated in his first and sole attempt to gain political office, but remained a powerful background figure in the Democratic Labour Party with Barrow rarely making any decisions on business or financial without consulting him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The life and times of Errol Barrow |last=Morgan |first=Peter |page=28 |year=1994 |publisher=Caribbean Communications |oclc=32104227 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among many posts held in the private sector he was also a director, and vice-chairman, of the island's largest insurance company, the [[Barbados Mutual Life Assurance Society]] (known by all locally as simply "The Mutual").

Sir Douglas joined The Barbados Shipping and Trading Company - the country's largest company, being the holding company for the six next largest companies in the country - as a Director, and as a regular part-time student of business at MIT was instrumental in choosing and setting up their first mainframe computer - which used a card-reading machine for input.

In time, Sir Douglas rose to become Joint Managing Director of BS&amp;T, followed by promotion to Chairman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Menard: 'Silly for me to push them' |work=[[The Montreal Gazette]] |date=1 March 1975 |page=4  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then Chairman and Joint Managing Director upon the retirement of his predecessor. He died in Barbados in April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leighrayment.com/knights/knightskinlyv.htm Leigh Rayment's Peerage Page - Knights and Dames since 1837: Kin-Lyv]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bryansfuneralhome.com/blog/sir-douglas-percy-lynch-ka-cmg-qc/ SIR DOUGLAS PERCY LYNCH KA, CMG, QC]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Downtown Compton''' is the major business district of [[Compton, California]]. Downtown Compton started out as a thriving and safe environment throughout the early 1950s to the mid-1970s. When gang violence and robberies sparked in the 70s businesses began to move out and relocate leaving Downtown Compton a [[ghost town]]. It is now home to many businesses, two shopping centers, and the [[Martin Luther King Jr. Transit Center]]. The [[Metro Blue Line (LACMTA)]] now currently runs through 'Downtown Compton making travel to the city much easier.

== History ==

=== 1950s-1970s ===
Throughout the 1950s to early 1970s Downtown Compton was a major business district and home to many companies. During weekends streets would be packed and filled with shoppers, especially during the holidays.

=== 1970s-1980s ===
During the late '70s the face of Downtown Compton began to take a drastic turn. Robberies and ongoing gang violence due to the primarily African-American street gangs the [[Crips]] and the [[Bloods]], businesses began to move elsewhere to avoid further problems.

=== 1980s-1990s ===
During the late 80s the face of [[Compton, California|Compton]] began to change with new mayor, [[Omar Bradley]], This included the construction of the new [[Compton Town Center]]. Around this time the [[Metro Rail (Los Angeles County)|Los Angeles County Metro Rail System]] began adding the finishing touches to the [[Metro Blue Line (LACMTA)|Metro Blue Line]] that runs straight through Downtown Compton on the median of [[Willowbrook Avenue]]. This led to the construction of the new [[Martin Luther King Jr. Transit Center]], also located on '''Willowbrook''' along with the [[Compton (LACMTA station)|Metro Blue Line Compton Station]].

== Recent Years ==
Downtown Compton is now home to the following businesses.

*[[Martin Luther King Jr, Transit Center]]
*[[Compton Town Center]]
*Renaissance Plaza
*[[Compton Courthouse]]

Straz Jr. Center for the Performing Arts]] opened its doors as the Tampa Bay Performing Arts Center, Tampa, Florida in July 1987 and has welcomed more than 10 million guests. The Straz Center is located in northern downtown on a 9-acre (36,000 m2) site along the east bank of the Hillsborough River. As the second largest performing arts complex in the Southeastern United States (behind the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts), the 335,000-square-foot (31,100 m2) venue provides an environment for a variety of events. It has a leading Broadway series, produces grand opera, is the home of the resident professional theater company [[Jobsite Theater]], and also presents a wide variety of concerts and other events.

=== Theaters ===

[[File:Tampa Theater.jpg|thumb|left|Tampa Theater]]
The [[Tampa Theatre]] a historic [[U.S. theater]] and city landmark in the Uptown District of downtown Tampa, Florida. On January 3, 1978, it was added to the [[U.S. National Register of Historic Places]]. The Theatre features a wide range of independent, foreign, and documentary films on a daily basis. It is Tampa's only non-profit movie theater and operating costs are largely covered by its membership program, various corporate sponsors as well as ticket sales. It has periodically been used as a backdrop for movies, MTV videos and local programming.

== Downtown Districts ==

=== Uptown District ===
{{main|Uptown Tampa}}
Also known as the '''River Arts District''', this northwestern chunk of downtown contains the majority of nightlife and dining in the neighborhood. Important cultural landmarks such as [[Tampa Theatre]], [[Straz Center for the Performing Arts]],  the John F. Germany public library, [[Glazer Children's Museum]], and the [[Tampa Museum of Art]] are all centered around [[Curtis Hixon Waterfront Park]], which has been called "Tampa's town square".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tampagov.net/news/renovations-underway-curtis-hixon-waterfront-park|title=Renovations Underway Curtis Hixon Waterfront Park|work=City of Tampa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collectively, this area represents the focal point of downtown proper due to having a large concentration of interest points and establishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2010-09-24/travel/os-travel-tampa-childrens-museum-20100924_1_channel-district-new-arts-new-museums|title=Children's museum strengthens Tampa's arts district|work=tribunedigital-orlandosentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Channel District ===
Although technically downtown, [[Channel District, Tampa|Channelside]] is often thought to be adjacent to the main CBD. This district is the location for many prominent downtown venues. The [[Tampa Convention Center]], [[Amalie Arena]], [[Tampa Bay History Center]], the [[Florida Aquarium]] and the [[SS American Victory]] are located in the Channel District. Twin 30 story condos were completed in 2007, called the [[Towers of Channelside]]. Many other residential mid and high-rises have been completed since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2004/01/02/Citytimes/Towers_viewed_as_bles.shtml|title=Citytimes: Towers viewed as blessing, curse|work=sptimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many locals know the Channel District (often abbreviated to Channelside in local parlance) for its nightlife. The [[Channelside Bay Plaza]], which has views of the downtown skyline, is located in the middle of the district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/News/051301/Columns/Channelside_woos_nigh.shtml|title=Columns: Channelside woos night life; singles seek a match|work=sptimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entrepreuners have founded companies that operate [[Neighborhood Electric Vehicle|NEVs]] to shuttle clubgoers to/from Channelside and Tampa's other core districts: [[Hyde Park, Tampa|Hyde Park]], [[Soho, Tampa|SoHo]], Downtown, and [[Ybor City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.tbo.com/content/2009/apr/07/agency-discuss-regulating-golf-cart--vehicles/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121209021801/http://www2.tbo.com/content/2009/apr/07/agency-discuss-regulating-golf-cart--vehicles/ |archivedate=2012-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/transportation/article459794.ece|title=Hop Tampa ready to give folks a ride downtown|work=Tampa Bay Times|access-date=2009-07-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607052533/http://www.tampabay.com/news/transportation/article459794.ece|archive-date=2011-06-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== University Area ===
The University area is the city's educational hub and is the location of [[The University of Tampa]] a medium sized private co-educational university. Making up the City's western boundary and located just across the Hillsborough River from downtown the university is home to 6,900 students.

=== Encore ===
The northern half of downtown is undergoing huge construction projects including retail, condos, and a large grocery store. The district, which will fill the gray zone between Downtown and [[Ybor City, Tampa|Historic Ybor]], will be called "Encore" and will be a "city within a city." &lt;sup&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100326173401/http://www2.tbo.com/content/2010/mar/24/job-fair-one-downtowns-largest-projects/news-breaking/]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/realestate/construction-job-fair-in-tampa-draws-thousands-of-applicants/1082786]&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100511021838/http://www.encoretampa.com/index.php]&lt;/sup&gt; A stimulus grant amounting $38 million was secured to help fund the project, the remaining to be derived from private funding. It is expected to create thousands of jobs for the area including at least 1,000 permanent ones. &lt;sup&gt;[http://www.review.net/print/tampas-encore-project-awarded-38-million-grant/]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/36034368/ns/local_news-tampa_fl/]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101128212929/http://southtampa2.tbo.com/content/2010/nov/24/010000/sprawling-encore-project-under-way/]&lt;/sup&gt; The district is being created with its African-American heritage in mind, having been built over the site of the former Central Avenue Business District and later Central Park housing project.

=== Riverwalk ===
[[File:Tampa architectural photos 256.jpg|thumb|right|The Riverwalk alongside [[Curtis Hixon Park]] ]]
{{main|Tampa Riverwalk}}
The Tampa Riverwalk is a 2.4 mile long walking and biking trail that winds along the edge of Tampa's downtown, running along the [[Hillsborough River (Florida)|Hillsborough River]] and the [[Garrison Channel]] from the [[Channel District]] on the southeast end to [[Water Works Park (Tampa, Florida)|Waterworks Park]] to the northwest. The Riverwalk's wide pathways, boardwalks, and bridges connect most of Tampa's waterfront parks, attractions, sports and entertainment venues, and hotels, including the [[Tampa Convention Center]], [[Amalie Arena]], the [[Straz Center]], and many others.&lt;ref name="Riverwalk-city"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tampagov.net/riverwalk | title=The Tampa Riverwalk | publisher=City of Tampa | accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea for the Riverwalk was first proposed by mayor [[Bill Poe]] in the mid-1970s as a way to redevelop Tampa's downtown waterfront, which had long been dominated by large warehouses, port facilities, and other industrial uses. The project was initiated in 1976 with a short walkway of wooden planks behind old [[Curtis Hixon Hall]]. However, funding and interest waned, and the project stalled for almost 30 years until mayor [[Pam Iorio]] made completing the project a city priority upon taking office in 2003. Construction began in phases in the mid-2000s, and the originally planned Riverwalk was completed in 2016, with further extensions to be added on both ends. The total cost of the completed project will be about $32 million, with most of the funds coming the city of Tampa along with a $11 million grant from the [[United States Department of Transportation]].&lt;ref name="Riverwalk-friends"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thetampariverwalk.com/about/history.aspx | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107124317/http://www.thetampariverwalk.com/about/history.aspx | dead-url=yes | archive-date=7 January 2015 | title=History of the Tampa Riverwalk | publisher=Friends of the Tampa Riverwalk | accessdate=7 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EasyLanguage''' is a proprietary [[programming language]] that was developed by [[TradeStation]] and built into its [[electronic trading platform]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tradestation.com/strategy_testing/st_creation.shtm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091121224930/http://www.tradestation.com/strategy_testing/st_creation.shtm |archivedate=2009-11-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to create custom indicators for financial charts and also to create [[algorithmic trading]] strategies for the markets. External [[Dynamic-link library|DLL]]'s can be referenced using EasyLanguage which greatly extends its functionality. 

The language was intended to allow creation of custom trading strategies by traders without specialized computer training. Commands consist mostly of regular English words, which makes EasyLanguage easier to learn than more complex programming languages.&lt;ref&gt;http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/2201&lt;/ref&gt;

Example:
* Plain English: "If the close is greater than the high of 1 day ago, then buy 100 shares at market."
* EasyLanguage: "if the Close &gt; the High of 1 day ago then Buy 100 shares next bar at market;"

'''First Isabela Cooperative Bank'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=First Isabela Cooperative Bank|url=http://www.ficobank.com/corpoprofile.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;, stylized as '''FICOBank'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=FICOBank|url=http://www.ficobank.com/visualidentity.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;, is a cooperative bank started in the mid-1970s. It is primarily engaged in financial intermediation between and among: [[farmer]]s, [[fisherman|fishers]] and their organizations; micro, small and medium [[entrepreneurs]]; rural, urban and overseas workers; and professionals, pensioners and other segments of the market. It also provides mobile-money, money-transfer/remittance and cash-dispensing services to the public. As of June 2018, FICOBank has 34 banking units located in the provinces of Isabela, Quirino, Nueva Vizcaya, Cagayan, Tarlac, Nueva Ecija, Bataan, Pampanga, Pangasinan and Bulacan.

== History ==
The Philippine Cooperative Program of the ‘70s during the [[Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos administration]] paved the way for the organization of cooperative banks in the country. A group of technocrats led by Dr. Orlando J. Sacay, the recognized father of the [[Philippine]] cooperative banking system, worked for the enactment of Presidential Decree 175, espousing the formation of economic institutions or [[Cooperative|cooperatives]]. Composed of small farmers, these cooperatives were primarily organized to look after their own interests.

To serve as foundation of the cooperative rural banks and area marketing cooperatives, ''samahang nayon'' (pre-cooperatives) were organized in the rural areas. Thus, the triangular approach to rural development—production (under the ''samahang nayon''), credit (under a cooperative rural bank), and marketing (under an area marketing cooperative)—was put into operation. It was envisioned that there would be social equity, if these three vital functions of rural development will be placed in the hands of the farmers.

In 1973, the Regional Cooperative Development Program for Cagayan Valley (RCDP-CV) was launched to develop the farming communities of the region. With financial assistance from the [[Canadian International Development Agency]], the program sought to: improve farm productivity; diversify [[agricultural]] production; increase household income; and install a system of cooperatives, as an indispensable support mechanism. The institution of the cooperative rural banking system, as a major component of the program, was in line with the recognition of the importance of rural finance for development.

The [[Bank]] was officially formed on September 10, 1976&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Milestones|url=http://www.ficobank.com/milestone.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; . It was the time when the authorized representatives of two cooperatives and 47 ''samahang nayon'' unanimously agreed and voluntarily joined together to establish a cooperative rural bank in the [[province of Isabela]]. The primordial objective for its establishment was to provide financing to farmers and small entrepreneurs who have limited resources and access to banking services.

Originally, the Bank was registered with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)]], as First Isabela Cooperative Rural Bank Inc. (FICRBI). On February 14, 1979, it acquired its juridical personality through SEC’s stamp of approval and registration. It was re-registered with the Bureau of Cooperative Development of the Ministry of Local Government and Community Development (BCOD-MLGCD) on April 10, 1979, under Certificate of Registration No. FF-119. The Central Bank of the Philippines granted the Bank its Certificate of Authority, numbered B-1000, on December 21, 1979 to operate as a cooperative rural bank. As such, it is vested with the rights to exercise all authority and powers, to do and perform all acts and to transact all businesses, which may be legally done by rural banks under the Rural Banking Act, and to do all other things incident thereto, as may be determined by the Monetary Board of the [[Central Bank of the Philippines]] (now known as Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas).

The Bank was formally inaugurated on January 2, 1980. Being a cooperative bank, FICRBI (now FICOBank) is under the supervision of both the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) and the Cooperative Development Authority (CDA). The latter was created by the enactment of Republic Act 6939. Together with Republic Act 6938 or the 1990 Cooperative Code of the Philippines, they are known as the twin Cooperative Laws of the country. In compliance with the provisions of the said laws, FICOBank obtained CDA’s confirmation of its registration, as a cooperative bank. Its Certificate of Confirmation, numbered 661, was issued by CDA on March 11, 1991.

After staying at the CAVADECO compound in [[Cauayan City, Isabela]] for about 15 years, FICOBank moved out and began its branching initiative to other parts of the province and its neighboring provinces in the region. In 1995, it opened its first branch in [[Roxas, Isabela]]. This was followed, in succession, by its branches in [[Alicia, Isabela|Alicia]] and Cauayan City, both in Isabela, in 1996. The Maddela Branch in [[Quirino province]] was opened in 1998. In the same year, its Jones Branch, also in Isabela, became its fifth branch. In 2003, its Cauayan Branch was transferred to [[Santiago (Philippine city)|Santiago City]]. A year later, the Bank’s Corporate Office—the nerve center of its operations—was inaugurated in its present location in Cauayan City, Isabela. A branch in [[Dupax del Sur]], the first operating unit of the Bank in the province of [[Nueva Vizcaya]], was also opened in the same year. It was later transferred to the municipality of [[Solano, Nueva Vizcaya|Solano]]. FICOBank established its foothold in the whole region by opening its branch in [[Solana, Cagayan]] in 2005.

Few years later, two field offices in [[Diffun, Quirino]] and [[Aurora, Isabela]] were opened, and two more branches in the municipalities of [[ Paniqui, Tarlac|Paniqui]] and [[Concepcion, Tarlac|Concepcion in Tarlac]] were inaugurated. Field offices in [[San Mateo, Isabela|San Mateo]], [[Ilagan, Isabela|Ilagan City]], [[Echague, Isabela|Echague]], [[Tumauini, Isabela|Tumauini]] and [[Cabagan, Isabela|Cabagan]]—all in Isabela—and in [[Bambang, Nueva Vizcaya]] were opened, one after the other. The Bank also opened one branch each in the municipalities of [[Dinalupihan, Bataan|Dinalupihan]] and Orani in Bataan and in [[Cabanatuan City, Nueva Ecija|Cabanatuan City in Nueva Ecija]], all in Region III. 

In 2009, FICOBank opened its five new branches, one in [[Cagayan]] and four in [[Pangasinan]]. The northernmost town of Aparri is the site of the new branch in Cagayan, while the municipalities of Umingan, Malasiqui, Lingayen and Mangaldan are the locations of the new branches of the Bank in the province of Pangasinan. The Orani Branch in Bataan was also transferred to Urdaneta City in Pangasinan in the same year. The Bank’s 27th operating unit was officially opened in Tuguegarao City in 2010. 

Its field offices were converted into extension offices, and all became full-fledged branches afterward. Its banking offices in Umingan (Pangasinan), Cabagan (Isabela) and Mangaldan (Pangasinan) were transferred to Guimba (Nueva Ecija), Gapan City (Nueva Ecija) and San Fernando City (Pampanga), respectively. Later on, five more branches were opened in Cauayan City (Isabela), Baliwag (Bulacan), and San Jose City, Rizal and Zaragoza (all in Nueva Ecija). In December 2017, the Bank inaugurated its 33rd banking unit in [[Abulug, Cagayan|Abulug (Cagayan)]]. And six (6) months later thereafter, FICOBank opened another branch in Cagayan, particularly in Gonzaga.

'''George Powell Barnes''' (20 September 1856 &amp;ndash; 9 December 1949), generally referred to by his full name or as "George P. Barnes",&lt;ref group="N"&gt;Most likely to distinguish him in newspaper reports from his contemporary, the prominent British parliamentarian [[George Barnes (British politician)|George Barnes]].&lt;/ref&gt; was a Queensland businessman and politician.

==Early life==
George was a son of Cobb and Co. pioneer [[Hiram Barnes]] and a brother of [[Walter Barnes (politician)|Walter Barnes MLA]].

==Business interests==

George Barnes started the company Barnes and Company Limited in 1880 in association with his brother, [[Walter Henry Barnes]] and Mr TF Merry.  Merry was a storekeeper in [[Toowoomba]], with whom George worked earlier and whose daughter, Mary Cecelia was married to George in 1879.  Barnes and Co was formed to control businesses in Warwick, [[Allora, Queensland|Allora]], [[Yangan, Queensland|Yangan]] and Roma Street and Commonwealth Flour Mills at [[Warwick, Queensland|Warwick]] and [[South Brisbane, Queensland|South Brisbane]].&lt;ref name=qhr&gt;{{cite QHR|15731|Barnes and Co. Trading Place|600956|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a leading figure in the Warwick Methodist Church and the Warwick Ambulance Brigade.

==Politics==
He was member for [[Electoral district of Warwick|Warwick]] for 27 years, from 1908 to 1935, when he retired.&lt;ref name=qp&gt;{{cite web|title=Former Members|publisher=[[Parliament of Queensland]]|year=2015| url=http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/members/former/bio?id=3301486626|accessdate= 27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
He married Mary Cecilia Merry (ca.1858  &amp;ndash; 3 October 1942) of [[Bulimba, Queensland]] in 1879. She was active in the local Methodist Church, Red Cross Society and Benevolent Society; they had a home "Glen Lyn" in [[Warwick, Queensland|Warwick]].

A son, [[Franklin George Barnes]] (ca.1883 &amp;ndash; ) was a mining engineer who devised and patented a method for [[degaussing]] British ships to counter the threat of [[magnetic mine]]s in the early days of World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article41943188 |title=Outwitted Nazis. |newspaper=[[The Courier-Mail]] |location=Brisbane |date=2 August 1941 |accessdate=11 May 2014 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article48742837|title=Inventor Of Degaussing Device Describes Famous Safeguard|date=4 February 1942|newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)]]|accessdate=23 January 2018|issue=26001|location=South Australia|volume=LXXXIV,|page=8|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another son, Cecil Merry Barnes, lost his life savings when his company, Barnes Ltd. of [[Fortitude Valley]] was forced into liquidation. G. P. Barnes felt his son's failure acutely, and personally paid out the company's [[preference share]]holders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article40855508 |title=Lost £16,000, Is Now Selling Flour. |newspaper=[[The Courier-Mail]] |location=Brisbane |date=4 August 1939 |accessdate=11 May 2014 |page=9 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The former [[Barnes and Co. Trading Place]] in Warwick is listed on the [[Queensland Heritage Register]].&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

A {{Nihongo||合同会社|'''gōdō gaisha'''}}, or godo kaisha, abbreviated '''GK''', is a type of [[Company|business organization]] in [[Japan]] modeled after the American [[limited liability company]] (LLC). It is a type of [[mochibun kaisha]] ([[corporation]] having a simplified internal structure like that of a [[partnership]]) distinguished by offering [[limited liability]] for all investors.

==Background==

Gōdō gaisha was newly introduced by the [[Law of Japan|Companies Act]], which became effective on May 1, 2006.

==Basic structure==

A GK is formed by {{nihongo|articles of incorporation|定款|teikan}} signed between its investors, called {{nihongo|members|社員|shain}}. Each member may provide a capital contribution in the form of money or property. Credit and promises to perform services are not valid consideration for an ownership interest in a GK.

Following ratification of the agreement, the GK's articles of incorporation and corporate seal must be registered with the {{nihongo|Legal Affairs Bureau|法務局|hōmukyoku}}. Once the bureau processes the registration, the company may open a bank account, seal contracts, and engage in other activities as a [[Juristic person|legal entity]].

The members may, either in the agreement or pursuant to the agreement, choose a {{nihongo|manager|執行社員|shikkō shain}} from among their ranks. This manager can be either an individual or a corporation; however, corporate managers must appoint a {{nihongo|functional manager|業務執行社員|gyōmu shikkō shain}} to perform the actual management duties.

The legal duties of GK managers are very similar to the legal duties of KK directors. GK members may sue managers in the same way that KK shareholders may sue directors on the company's behalf.

A GK may be converted to a KK with the unanimous consent of all of its members.

==Distinguishing characteristics==

The following distinguish godo gaisha from [[kabushiki gaisha]]:

* All members must consent to amendment of the articles of incorporation, unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise. (In a KK, only a supermajority of shareholders is required.)
* All members must consent to any transfer of ownership, unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise. (In a KK, the transfer of shares is unlimited by default.)
* All members are representatives of the company by default, unless managers have been appointed. (In a KK, only the [[Representative Director (Japan)|Representative Director]] represents the company.)
* Major business decisions (such as large asset sales or winding up of the company) may be made informally. (In a KK, resolutions of shareholder and board meetings are often required for such decisions).
* Members may invest any type of asset in exchange for their interest. (In a KK, non-cash contributions require an appraisal supervised by a court.)
* Because KKs traditionally required a larger capital and procedural investment, GKs did not initially have the same level of prestige. That has changed with many large companies, including Apple, Exxon Mobil and Amazon, opting for GKs in Japan.

==Taxation==

GKs are taxed as corporations under Japanese law: the company's profits are taxed at corporate tax rates, and dividends are taxed at individual tax rates.

In late 2005, following the passage of the Companies Act, the [[Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry]] pressed the [[Ministry of Finance (Japan)|Ministry of Finance]] to treat GKs as "pass-through entities" in which only company profits would be taxed. However, the Ministry of Finance refused to allow such treatment. As a result, many new companies are expected to use the more prestigious KK business form rather than the GK business form, especially given the looser regulation of KKs under the new law. The only limited liability business which receives pass-through tax treatment in Japan is the [[limited liability partnership]].

Under [[United States]] tax law, gōdō gaisha are not classified as corporations, and are therefore eligible to make an [[entity classification election]]: a single-member GK may be treated as an extension of its member and a multi-member GK may follow the tax rules for [[partnership]]s.

'''Howard Moskowitz''' is an American [[market research]]er and [[Psychophysics|psychophysicist]]. He is best known for the detailed study he made of the types of [[Tomato sauce|spaghetti sauce]] and horizontal segmentation. By providing a large number of options for consumers, Moskowitz pioneered the idea of [[intermarket variability]] as applied to the [[food industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=What The Dog Saw |last=Gladwell |first=Malcolm |authorlink=Malcolm Gladwell |year=2009 |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |isbn=0-316-07584-1 |page=432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard Moskowitz is the CEO of i-Novation Inc as well as President of Moskowitz Jacobs Inc., a firm he founded in 1981.

Moskowitz graduated from [[Harvard University]] in 1969 with a Ph.D. in experimental psychology. Prior to that he graduated [[Queens College]] (New York), [[Phi Beta Kappa]], with degrees in [[mathematics]] and [[psychology]].  He has written/edited sixteen books, has published well over 300 articles and serves on the editorial board of major journals.

His latest book with co-author Alex Gofman, ''[[Selling Blue Elephants]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moskowitz|first=Howard|title=Selling Blue Elephants: How to make great products that people want BEFORE they even know they want them|year=2007|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hal|isbn=0136136680|url=https://www.amazon.com/Selling-Blue-Elephants-products-people/dp/0136136680/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1359826183&amp;sr=1-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  demonstrates and popularizes how IdeaMap (i-Novation`s flagship product) creates new products and messages... from areas as diverse as credit cards, jewelry offers, presidential messaging during election years, stock market communications, and trans-national innovation.

Moskowitz has won the Scientific Director`s Gold Medal for outstanding research at the [[U.S. Army Natick Laboratories]], and the 2001 and 2003 awards by [[ESOMAR]] (European Society Of Market Research). In 2004, Moskowitz was elected as an [[Institute of Food Technologists|IFT]] Fellow, and also was awarded the "David R. Peryam Award", from [[ASTM]], in recognition of outstanding contributions to the field of basic and applied sensory science.

In 2005, Moskowitz was awarded the [[Charles Coolidge Parlin]] Marketing Research Award for his substantial contributions and dedication to the advancement of marketing research practices.  Most recently, he is the recipient of the [[Advertising Research Foundation|ARF]] Research Innovation Award and [[The Market Research Council]] Hall of Fame Award, both in 2006.

==Products==
Moskowitz developed [[Dr. Pepper#Flavor variations|Cherry Vanilla Dr Pepper]] when he was hired in 2004 by [[Cadbury Schweppes]], which was hoping to expand the market for [[Dr. Pepper]] by developing a [[Product line extensions|product line extension]] using an alternative formulation with vanilla or cherry flavors. Moskowitz has been consulted by [[Campbell Soup]], [[General Foods]], [[Kraft Foods|Kraft]] and [[PepsiCo]] for his expertise in [[food optimization]]. According to Moskowitz he has optimized [[soup]]s, [[pizza]]s, [[salad dressing]]s, and [[Pickled cucumber|pickles]] in his work for various firms. His research on [[Prego]] [[spaghetti sauce]], which revealed a significant customer preference for an "extra-chunky" formulation, is notable as was his optimization of the amount of salt, sugar, and fat in spaghetti sauce at the "[[bliss point (food)|bliss point]]" which maximized consumer satisfaction. His first job after graduation from Harvard was for the [[United States Army]] with respect to [[Meal, Ready-to-Eat|Meals, Ready-to-Eat]], where he applied the concept of [[sensory-specific satiety]], the tendency for consumers to tire of strongly flavored foods, to ensure that the meals were formulated in a way that encouraged soldiers to eat sufficient calories.&lt;ref name=NYTMag022013&gt;{{cite news|title=The Extraordinary Science of Addictive Junk Food|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/magazine/the-extraordinary-science-of-junk-food.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=March 1, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times Magazine|date=February 20, 2013|author=Michael Moss}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and education==
Mwangi was born in [[Kangema]], in [[Central Province (Kenya)|Kenya's Central Province]], circa 1962. His father was killed in the [[Mau Mau]] conflict, so the young Mwangi, together with his six siblings were raised by '''Grace Wairimu Mwangi''', their single mother. He attended ''Nyagatugu Primary School'' in Kangema Village. He went on to ''Ichagaki Secondary School'', on a government scholarship, having excelled in primary school. For his A-Level education, he went to ''Kagumo High School'', where he studied [[economics]], [[English literature]] and [[geography]]. He went on to the [[University of Nairobi]], graduating with the degree of [[Bachelor of Commerce]] (BCom). He also sat and passed the [[Certified Public Accountant|Certified Public Accountant of Kenya]] (CPA) examinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|

==Career==
In 1993, in his capacity as "Finance Director", he was tasked by the Chairman and by the CEO of '''Equity Building Society''' (EBS), to wind up the insolvent organisation which was losing KSh5 million (approx. US$60,000 then), annually and had, at that time, accumulated total losses of KSh33 million (approx. US$380,000 then). However the young Mwangi, aged about 31 at the time, began by motivating the 27 staff members to give better customer care to the 27,000 customers they had then. He also encouraged them to use 25% of their salaries to buy EBS shares. When things began to brighten up at EBS, the society began to sell shares to customers and to pay annual dividends in 1997. In 2000, the society computerized their operations. They were able to raise more capital and attract more customers. On 31 August 2004, Equity Building Society became [[Equity Bank Kenya Limited|Equity Bank Kenya]].

In 2006, Equity Bank listed on the [[Nairobi Stock Exchange]] (NSE). On Thursday 18 June 2009, the Group's stock cross listed on the [[Uganda Securities Exchange]] and started trading that day, under the symbol: '''EBL'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/220/685424|title=Equity Bank Cross-Lists On USE|date=21 June 2009|accessdate=22 October 2014|first=Archive|last=Newvision|newspaper=[[New Vision]] (Kampala)|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141021210134/http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/220/685424|archivedate=21 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{asof|October 2014}}, the bank group has subsidiaries in [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], [[Tanzania]], [[Rwanda]] and [[South Sudan]]. {{asof|March 2014}}, Equity Group Holdings Limited was a large financial services organisation in East Africa, with an asset base valued at over US$3.45 billion (KES:295 billion), with a total customer base in excess of 8.7 million, in the region the group serves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equity Group In 20 Percent Profit Rise to Sh3.8 Billion| url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201404171408.html|publisher=[[98.4 Capital FM|Capital FM Online]] (Nairobi) via [[AllAfrica.com]]| first=Kennedy|last=Kangethe|date=17 April 2014|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also co-created the DC comic book ''[[Prez (comics)|Prez]]'' with [[Joe Simon]].

[[Pop artist]] [[Roy Lichtenstein]]'s 1962 drawing ''Jet Pilot'' is based on a Grandenetti comic-book panel on the cover of DC's ''[[All-American Comics|All-American Men of War]]'' #89 ([[cover-date]]d Feb. 1962), and Lichtenstein's 1964 triptych "[[As I Opened Fire]]" is based on panels by Grandenetti in "Wingmate of Doom" in issue #90 (April 1962).

==Biography==

===Early life and career===

Born in the village of [[Bronxville]] in the town of [[Eastchester, New York]], a suburb of New York City, Jerry Grandenetti studied art and architectural drawing at the Cartoonists and Illustrators School (later named the [[School of Visual Arts]]), in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name="inter" /&gt; He did World War II military service in the [[U.S. Navy]] "in 1942 or 1943", he recalled,&lt;ref name="inter"&gt;Archive of Fears, Stephen. {{cite web|url=http://www.jergrand.com/interview.php |title="The Jerry Grandenetti Interview" |accessdate=2017-04-21 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514174207/http://www.jergrand.com/interview.php |archivedate=May 14, 2008 |df= }} at Grandenetti official site, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; and after the war attended [[Brooklyn]]'s [[Pratt Institute]] on the [[G.I. Bill]]. In either 1946 or 1948 (accounts differ), he was making the rounds of comic-book companies and met [[Everett M. "Busy" Arnold]], publisher of [[Quality Comics]]. Arnold had no position for him but sent Grandenetti to [[Will Eisner]], writer-artist of the Sunday-newspaper comic-book section starring Eisner's celebrated character the [[Spirit (comics)|Spirit]]. Grandenetti hired on as an art assistant. As ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' editor-publisher [[Gary Groth]] wrote, "By the late '40s, Eisner's participation in the strip had dwindled to a largely supervisory role. ... Eisner hired Jerry Grandenetti and [[Jim Dixon (comics)|Jim Dixon]] to occasionally ink his pencils. By 1950, [[Jules Feiffer|[Jules] Feiffer]] was writing most of the strips, and Grandenetti, Dixon, and [[Al Wenzel]] were drawing them",&lt;ref&gt;Archive of [[Gary Groth|Groth, Gary]], {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429204530/http://www.tcj.com/267/e_groth.html |date=April 29, 2008 |title="Will Eisner: Chairman of the Board"|archivedate=2008 }},''The Comics Journal'' #267, May 2005.

"Working for Eisner was exciting", Grandenetti recalled in 2005. "Although there was no such thing as teaching or showing you how to develop your craft. ... Before [the feature's] demise he tried everything.  Had me penciling 'The Spirit'. Later on it was [[Wally Wood]]", who drew it through to its end in 1952, "but nothing could save 'The Spirit'! Sad, too. It was probably the greatest comic strip ever created".&lt;ref name="arndt"&gt;{{cite web|last=Arndt |first=Richard J. |url=http://www.enjolrasworld.com/Richard%20Arndt/The%20Warren%20Magazines%20Interviews.htm |title=The Warren Magazines: Interviews |date=February 3, 2010 |accessdate=13 March 2007 |archivedate=June 15, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313060303/http://www.enjolrasworld.com/Richard%20Arndt/The%20Warren%20Magazines%20Interviews.htm |df= }} Additional .&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, Eisner, in his sideline as a comics packager, created the feature "Secret Files of Dr. Drew" for [[Fiction House]]. Grandenetti said Eisner instructed him to draw it "in the Eisner style.  Which I did, badly.  Anyway, after a couple of stories I began to do my own thing".&lt;ref name="arndt" /&gt; The eight-page story "The Strange Case of the Absent Floor" in ''Rangers Comics'' #47 (June 1949), which he both penciled and [[inker|inked]], marked Grandenetti's first credited comics art, and he remained on the feature (scripted by Eisner's office manager and future journalist [[Marilyn Mercer]]) through #60 (Aug. 1951). Grandenetti also drew "Senorita Rio" stories for the same publisher's ''Fight Comics''.&lt;ref name=gcd&gt;[http://www.comics.org/credit/name/Jerry%20Grandenetti/sort/chrono/ Jerry Grandenetti] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]&lt;/ref&gt;

After doing a small amount of work for [[Lev Gleason Publications]]' ''Boy Comics'' #52 (April 1960), Media's ''Mister Universe'' #1 (July 1951), [[American Comics Group]]'s ''Adventures into the Unknown'' #22 (Aug. 1951), and [[Prize Comics]]' ''Black Magic'' vol. 2, #3 (Feb. 1952), Grandenetti began his 17-year run at [[DC Comics]].&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt;

===DC Comics===
[[Image:OurFightingForces71.jpg|thumb|''Our Fighting Forces'' #71 (Oct. 1962): One of Grandenetti's wash-tone covers]]
At DC, then the leading comic-book company and the home of [[Batman]] and [[Superman]], Grandenetti drew some of everything that was not a [[superhero]]. Beginning with ''[[Western Comics]]'' #27 (Sept. 1951), Grandenetti did [[Western comics]] (''[[All-Star Western]]''),  [[crime fiction]] (''[[Racket Squad]] in Action'', ''[[Gang Busters]]'', ''[[Mr. District Attorney]]''), science fiction (''[[Strange Adventures]]''), and [[mystery fiction|mystery]]-suspense (''[[House of Mystery]]''), but made his mark as one of DC's signature [[war comics]] artists, drawing hundreds of [[anthological]] stories and covers in a dozen years' worth of such titles as ''[[All-American Men of War]]'', ''[[G.I. Combat]]'', ''[[Our Army at War]]'', ''[[Our Fighting Forces]]'', and ''[[Star Spangled War Stories]]''.&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt;

DC war-comics editor and writer [[Robert Kanigher]] recalled that on the feature "Gunner and Sarge" in particular, Grandenetti "managed to get the grime and the humor of the two Marines (and, eventually their wonderful Pooch) fighting in the jungle as no one else could. Jerry liked to experiment and I had to sit on him to get him to stop it. Especially in his covers, which were outstanding, when I forced him to draw as realistically as possible".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kanigher interview, ''The Comics'' (Oct. 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; With Kanigher, Grandenetti co-created the feature "[[Mademoiselle Marie|Mlle. Marie]]", about a World War II [[French Resistance]] fighter, in ''Star Spangled War Stories'' #84 (Aug. 1959).&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toonopedia.com/mllemari.htm Mlle. Marie] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]. [https://www.webcitation.org/62hbPk3iP?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/mllemari.htm Archived] October 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grandenetti became known for cover art rendered in wash-tone, also known as grey-tone, which, as comics-art historian [[Don Mangus]] describes, "is executed as an ink-[[wash drawing]], and then a [[halftone]] [[Photostat]] of the cover is made, the logo added, and finally the color is laid in over this statted wash drawing",&lt;ref name="mangus"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mangus |first=Don |url=http://www.comicartville.com/manguswoodconflict.htm |title=Conflict! |publisher=Comicartville.com |date=n.d. |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5sq0XOYtF?url=http://www.comicartville.com/manguswoodconflict.htm |archivedate=September 18, 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; rendering a painted effect.

===Later comics career===
In late 1965, Grandenetti began freelancing for additional companies, drawing a small number of stories for [[Charlton Comics]] and [[Tower Comics]], and penciling a [[Sub-Mariner]] story—inked by the character's creator, [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age of Comics]] legend [[Bill Everett]]—in [[Marvel Comics]]' ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #86 (Dec. 1966).&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt;

Mostly, however, Grandenetti began turning to [[Warren Publishing]], home of the black-and-white, [[horror fiction|horror]]-comics magazines ''[[Creepy (magazine)|Creepy]]'' and ''[[Eerie]]''.  Grandenetti's work for Warren, writes comics-art historian Don Mangus, "returned to a much more expressionistic and experimental phase, building on what he had begun at Eisner's studio, or perhaps due to freedom from Kanigher’s restraints. Perhaps it was the subject matter or the fluid nature of the wash medium but whatever the case, he produced brilliant work at Warren in the late 1960s and early 1970s".&lt;ref name="mangus" /&gt; Warren would later reprint his youthful inking and background work for Will Eisner with the magazine series ''The Spirit''. Grandenetti was profiled in ''Creepy'' #42, and a [[self-portrait]] ran in ''Vampirella'' #16.

Concurrently, for DC, Grandenetti succeeded [[Neal Adams]] on the 1960s run of DC's [[supernatural]] spirit of vengeance the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]], drawing issues #6–10 (Oct. 1966 – June 1969). Grandenetti also helped revive the 1940s DC character the [[Phantom Stranger]], drawing the lead story in his return appearance in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #80 (Feb. 1969). In ''Showcase'' #82 (May 1969), he and writer [[Dennis O'Neil]] co-created the minor [[sword and sorcery]] character [[Nightmaster]]—originally assigned to then-newcomer [[Bernie Wrightson]], who was taken off it after his first seven pages proved disappointing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/05wrightson.html |title=Like a Bat Out of Hell: Chatting with Bernie Wrightson, DC's Monster Maker |work=[[Comic Book Artist]] |publisher=[[Two Morrows Publishing]] |issue=5 |date=Summer 1999 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5sq0rQnS4?url=http://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/05wrightson.html |archivedate=September 18, 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He contributed to at least one issue of the black-and-white humor magazine ''[[Sick (magazine)|Sick]]'' (#70, Oct. 1969), edited by his friend [[Joe Simon]], the Golden Age co-creator of [[Captain America]], then collaborated with Simon at DC on issues of ''Champion Sports''. The two then co-created the [[youth culture]] oddity ''[[Prez (comics)|Prez]]'', about the first teen president of the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 156 |quote = Teenage President of the United States Prez Rickard didn't enjoy a long term in comics.

Grandenetti penciled a parody of the TV series ''[[Kolchak: The Night Stalker]]'' in the Marvel humor comic ''Arrgh!'' #4 (July 1975), for which he also drew the cover.&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt;

Comics historian [[Mark Evanier]], calling Grandenetti "[o]ne of the great individual stylists of comic books in the fifties and sixties," wrote that, "As the [1960s] wore on, he got away from combat art and conventional page layouts, taking what he'd learned from [[Will Eisner|[Will] Eisner]] and applying it in new, then-revolutionary directions. Like most artists who departed from the conventional, his work was loved by many but disliked by some. … [B]y the early seventies, Grandenetti was working so far outside even the relaxed conventions of DC Comics that he no longer quite fit in. I thought he was a marvelous, distinct talent who wasn't precisely suited to the work he was assigned, like ''The Spectre'', ''Prez'' and "Nightmaster".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Mark Evanier |last=Evanier |first=Mark |url=http://www.newsfromme.com/archives/2003_11_12.html |title=Comic Artist Website of the Day |publisher="P.O.V.

Grandenetti continued to freelance occasional stories for DC through at least ''G.I. Combat'' #270 (Oct. 1984).&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt;

===Later life===
In 1990,&lt;ref name="arndt" /&gt; Grandenetti became an [[art director]] at the large [[advertising agency]] [[Young &amp; Rubicam]]. Breaking into advertising, he recalled, "wasn't really [tough] because, unlike a lot of comic book illustrators, all of the time I had my eyes set elsewhere. I was developing that ability, while at the same time working for the comic book companies, by doing spot drawings and illustrations for small agencies. By the time I was ready, I had this well developed portfolio so I was able to break in".&lt;ref name="inter" /&gt;

As of 2005, Grandenetti was freelancing for ad agencies in New York City, and doing [[fine art]] paintings in [[watercolor]], [[Acrylic paint|acrylics]], and [[mixed media]].

Grandenetti, who lived in [[Bellport, New York|Bellport]], New York, on [[Long Island]], died at age 83 at Brookhaven Memorial Hospital in nearby [[East Patchogue, New York]]. The official cause of death was cardiopulmonary arrest, though he also had metastatic cancer.&lt;ref name=fft /&gt;

==Legacy==
[[Pop artist]] [[Roy Lichtenstein]]'s 1962 drawing ''Jet Pilot'' is based on a Grandenetti comic-book panel on the cover of DC's ''[[All-American Comics|All-American Men of War]]'' #89 (Feb. 1962).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/deconstructing-roy-lichtenstein/40534730/ Deconstructing Lichtenstein], [http://www.lichtensteinfoundation.org/3163.htm The Roy Lichtenstein Foundation: ''Jet Pilot'']  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015051127/http://www.lichtensteinfoundation.org/3163.htm |date=October 15, 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Lichtenstein's 1964 triptych "[[As I Opened Fire]]" is based on panels by Grandenetti in "Wingmate of Doom" in issue #90 (April 1962).&lt;ref name=Waldman&gt;{{cite book|first=Diane|last=Waldman| title= Roy Lichtenstein | publisher= [[Solomon R.

'''John Emil List''' (September 17, 1925 – March 21, 2008) was an American [[mass murder]]er&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.crimemuseum.org/crime-library/serial-killers/serials-killers-vs-mass-murderers/|title=Serial Killers vs. Mass Murderers|publisher=[[National Museum of Crime &amp; Punishment|Crime Museum]]|access-date=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and long-time [[fugitive]]. On November 9, 1971, he killed his wife, mother, and three children in their home in [[Westfield, New Jersey|Westfield]], [[New Jersey]], then disappeared. He had planned the murders so that nearly a month passed before anyone suspected that anything was amiss.

As he eluded justice for nearly 18 years, List assumed a new identity and remarried. He was finally apprehended in [[Virginia]] on June 1, 1989, after the story of his murders was broadcast on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] television program ''[[America's Most Wanted]]''. After [[extradition]] to New Jersey, he was [[Conviction (law)|convicted]] on five counts of [[first degree murder]] and [[Sentence (law)|sentenced]] to five consecutive terms of [[life imprisonment]] without [[parole]].

List gave critical financial problems, and his perception that his family was falling away from [[God]], as his rationale. Killing them, he allegedly reasoned, would assure their souls a place in [[Heaven]], where he hoped eventually to join them. He died in prison in 2008 at the age of 82.

==Personal background==
Born in [[Bay City, Michigan|Bay City]], [[Michigan]], List was the only child of [[German-American]] parents, John Frederick List (1859–1944) and Alma Maria Barbara Florence (Hubinger) List (1887–1971)&lt;!--born Feb 12 1887--&gt;. Like his father, he was a devout [[Lutheran]] and a [[Sunday school]] teacher. In 1943, he enlisted in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and served in the infantry as a laboratory technician during [[World War II]]. After his discharge in 1946, he enrolled at the [[University of Michigan]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], where he earned a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[business administration]] and a [[master's degree]] in [[accounting]], and was commissioned a [[second lieutenant]] through [[ROTC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ryzuk|first=Mary S.|year=1990|title=Thou Shalt Not Kill|publisher=Popular Library|isbn=0-445-21043-5|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1950, as the [[Korean War]] escalated, List was recalled to active military service. At [[Fort Eustis]], in [[Virginia]], he met Helen Morris Taylor, the widow of an infantry officer [[killed in action]] in [[Korea]], who lived nearby with her daughter, Brenda. John and Helen married on December 1, 1951, in [[Baltimore]], and the family moved to northern [[California]] where List served as an Army accountant.&lt;ref&gt;Benford, T. ''Righteous Carnage: The List Murders in Westfield''. Scribner (1991), pp. 120-125. {{ISBN|0684192004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After completion of his second tour in 1952, List worked for an accounting firm in [[Detroit]], and then as an audit supervisor at a paper company in [[Kalamazoo, Michigan|Kalamazoo]], where their three children were born.&lt;ref&gt;Benford 1991, pp. 126-7.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1959, List had risen to general supervisor of the company's accounting department; but Helen, an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]], had become increasingly unstable.&lt;ref&gt;Benford 1991, pp. 131-7.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, Brenda married and left the household, and List moved with the remainder of his family to [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[New York (state)|New York]], to take a job with [[Xerox]], where he eventually became director of accounting services.&lt;ref&gt;Benford 1991, pp. 137-9.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, he accepted a position as vice president and comptroller at a bank in [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], [[New Jersey]], and moved with his wife, children, and mother into Breeze Knoll, a 19-room [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] mansion at 431 Hillside Avenue in [[Westfield, New Jersey|Westfield]].&lt;ref&gt;Benford 1991, pp. 153-60.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murders==
On November 9, 1971, List methodically murdered his entire immediate family, using his own [[9mm]] [[Steyr 1912]] [[Semi-automatic pistol|semi-automatic handgun]]&lt;ref&gt;Benford TB, Johnson JP. ''Righteous Carnage: The List Murders in Westfield''. Scribner (1991), p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; and his father's [[Colt guns|Colt]] [[.22 caliber]] [[revolver]].&lt;ref&gt;Benford and Johnson, 1991, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt; While his children were at school he shot his wife Helen, 46, in the back of the head, and then his mother Alma, 84, above the left eye. As his daughter Patricia, 16, and younger son Frederick, 13, arrived home from school, he shot each of them in the back of the head. After making himself lunch, List drove to his bank to close his own and his mother's bank accounts, and then to Westfield High School to watch his elder son John Jr., 15, play in a [[soccer]] game. He drove the boy home, then shot him repeatedly in the chest and face.&lt;ref name = "ramsland"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT20081228"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/28/magazine/28List-t.html |title=Wanted: A Killer Disappears Into Another Life |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=December 28, 2008 | first=Elizabeth | last=McCracken | accessdate=May 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because his son tried to resist, List shot him repeatedly until he was sure the boy was dead.

List placed the bodies of his wife and children on sleeping bags in the mansion's ballroom. He left his mother's body in her apartment in the attic. In a five-page letter to his pastor, found on the desk in his study, he wrote that he saw too much evil in the world, and he had killed his family to save their souls. He then cleaned the various crime scenes, carefully cut his own picture out of every family photograph in the house, tuned a radio to a religious station, and departed.&lt;ref name="NYT20081228"/&gt;

The murders were not discovered until December 7, nearly a month later, due in part to the family's reclusiveness and refusal to socialize, and in part to notes sent by List to the children's schools and part-time jobs stating that the family would be visiting Helen's mother in [[North Carolina]] for several weeks. He also stopped milk, mail and newspaper deliveries.&lt;ref name="NYT20081228"/&gt;  Neighbors noticed that all of the mansion's lights were illuminated day and night, with no apparent activity within. Finally, as the lights began burning out one by one, they called police.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsland, K: John List. [http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/family/list/1.html Crime Library].

The case became the most notorious crime in New Jersey history since the kidnapping and murder of the [[Lindbergh baby]]. A nationwide [[Manhunt (law enforcement)|manhunt]] was launched.

==Relocation, arrest and trial==
In 1971, as the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] later discovered, List had traveled by train from New Jersey to Michigan, and then [[Colorado]]. He settled in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] in early 1972 and took an accounting job as Robert Peter "Bob" Clark, the name of one of his college classmates (although the real Bob Clark later asserted that he had never known List).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Death Sentence: The Inside Story of the John List Murders Joe Sharkey, Signet, 305 pp., {{ISBN|0-451-16947-6}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1979 to 1986 he was the comptroller at a paper box manufacturer outside Denver. He joined a Lutheran congregation and ran a car pool for shut-in church members. At one religious gathering, he met an Army [[Base Exchange|PX]] clerk named Delores Miller and married her in 1985. In February 1988, the couple moved to [[Midlothian, Virginia|Midlothian]], Virginia, where List, still using the name Bob Clark, resumed work as an accountant.&lt;ref&gt;Gross, Ken; Bonnett Sellinger, Margie; Kelley, Jack.

On June 1, 1989, he was arrested at a [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] accounting firm after a Denver neighbor viewed the ''America's Most Wanted'' broadcast, recognized the profile, and alerted authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/richmond/about-us/history-1/history |title=FBI Richmond Division History |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation |accessdate=19 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116171738/http://www.fbi.gov/richmond/about-us/history-1/history |archivedate=16 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ryzuk, pp.396-399&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to stand by his alias for several months, even after [[extradition]] to [[Union County, New Jersey|Union County]], New Jersey, in late 1989; but finally, faced with irrefutable evidence—including a [[fingerprint]] match with List's military records, and then with evidence found at the crime scene—he confessed his true identity on February 16, 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Ryzuk, p.452&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;He Just Fit Right In.

At trial, List testified that he was faced with grave financial difficulties in 1971: he had lost his job at the Jersey City bank. To avoid sharing this humiliating development with his family, he spent each workday at the Westfield train station, reading newspapers until it was time to come home. He skimmed money from his mother's bank accounts to avoid defaulting on his [[mortgage]].&lt;ref name="NYT20081228"/&gt; He was also dealing with his wife's alcoholism and her untreated [[syphilis#tertiary|tertiary syphilis]], contracted from her first husband and concealed for 18 years. According to trial testimony, Helen had pressured List into marriage by falsely claiming that she was pregnant, then insisted that they marry in [[Maryland]], which does not require blood testing to obtain a marriage license.&lt;ref&gt;Benford 1991, pp. 125-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Though her health progressively worsened, she said nothing to List or her physicians until 1969, when a check-up revealed the condition. By then the disease and her excessive alcohol consumption had, according to testimony, "transformed her from an attractive young woman to an unkempt and paranoid recluse"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goleader.com/list/ The List Murders Stun Westfield In 1971] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060321184241/http://www.goleader.com/list/ |date=2006-03-21 }} By Kathy Halverson, February 17, 2001 For The Westfield Leader and The Times.

A court-appointed psychiatrist testified that List suffered from [[obsessive-compulsive personality disorder]], and that he saw only two solutions to his situation: accept [[Social programs in the United States#Welfare|welfare]] or kill his family and send their souls to [[Heaven]].&lt;ref name="NYT19900407"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=I Know That What Has Been Done Is Wrong |date=1990 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/29/nyregion/i-know-that-what-has-been-done-is-wrong.html |work=New York Times |accessdate=March 30, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Welfare was an unacceptable option, he reasoned, because it would expose him and his family to ridicule and violate his [[Authoritarian personality|authoritarian]] father's teachings regarding the care and protection of family members.&lt;ref name="NYT19900407"/&gt;

On April 12, 1990, List was convicted of five counts of [[first degree murder]].&lt;ref name = "LA Times"/&gt; At his sentencing hearing he denied direct responsibility for his actions: "I feel that because of my mental state at the time, I was unaccountable for what happened. I ask all affected by this for their forgiveness, understanding and prayer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Associated Press |date=May 20, 1990 |title=Judge Sentences Family Killer to Life in Prison |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-05-02/news/mn-174_1_life-sentences |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=26 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge was unpersuaded: "John Emil List is without remorse and without honor," he said. "After 18 years, five months and 22 days, it is now time for the voices of Helen, Alma, Patricia, Frederick and John F. List to rise from the grave." He imposed a sentence of five terms of [[life imprisonment]], to be served consecutively, the maximum permissible penalty at the time.&lt;ref name = "LA Times"&gt;{{cite news |title=Killer of Family Gets 5 Life Terms : Court: Judge sentences accountant who murdered his mother, wife and children 18 years ago to the maximum sentence |author=AP |date=May 11, 1990 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-05-01/news/mn-423_1_maximum-sentence |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=September 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

List filed an appeal of his convictions on grounds that his judgment had been impaired by [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] due to his military service. He also argued that the letter he left behind at the crime scene, essentially his confession, was a confidential communication to his pastor and therefore inadmissible as evidence. A federal appeals court rejected both arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stout |first=D. |date=March 25, 2008 |title=John E.

List later expressed a degree of remorse for his crimes: "I wish I had never done what I did," he said. "I've regretted my action and prayed for forgiveness ever since."&lt;ref&gt;List and Goodrich (2006): ''Collateral Damage: The John List Story'', p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;  When asked by [[Connie Chung]] in 2002 why he had not taken his own life, he said he believed that [[suicide]] would have barred him from Heaven, where he hoped to be reunited with his family.&lt;ref name="NYT_19830325"/&gt;

==Death==

==Home arson==
Breeze Knoll was destroyed by [[arson]] on August 20, 1972, approximately 10 months after the murders. The crime remains officially unsolved.&lt;ref name="BN"&gt;Breeze Knoll: The John List Murder House. [http://www.house-crazy.com/breeze-knoll-the-john-list-murder-house/ house-crazy.com], retrieved December 29, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Destroyed along with the home was the ballroom's [[stained glass]] skylight, rumored to be a signed [[Louis Comfort Tiffany|Tiffany]] original, worth at least $100,000 at the time ({{Inflation|US|100000|1972|r=-4|fmt=eq}}).&lt;ref name="NYT_19830325"/&gt; A new house was built on the site in 1974.&lt;ref name="BN"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
Over the years, List and his crimes have furnished inspiration for a number of movies and documentaries. Examples include the 1993 film ''[[Judgment Day: The John List Story]]'', in which List was portrayed by [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]]; the 1987 film ''[[The Stepfather (1987 film)|The Stepfather]]'' and its [[The Stepfather (2009 film)|2009 remake]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ryan|first=Desmond|title=How Profitable Sequels Succeed: They Just Bring 'em Back Alive|url=http://articles.philly.com/1989-12-03/entertainment/26158069_1_stepfather-mortal-coil-predator-ii|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer|date=December 3, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the character [[Keyser Söze]] in the 1995 film ''[[The Usual Suspects]]''.&lt;ref name="DVDcom"&gt;''The Usual Suspects'' DVD commentary featuring [[Bryan Singer]] and [[Christopher McQuarrie]], [2000]. Retrieved 27 September 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1996 episode of the series ''[[Forensic Files]]'' discussed the List murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1469600/ | series=[[Forensic Files]] | title=The List Murders | date=December 12, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2003 episode of the [[A&amp;E (TV channel)|A&amp;E]] series ''[[American Justice]]'' also detailed the case and featured an interview with List.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tv.com/shows/american-justice/to-save-their-souls-819731/ | series=[[American Justice]] | title=To Save Their Souls | date=February 12, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, List was proposed as a suspect in the [[D. B. Cooper]] [[air piracy]] case because of the timing of his disappearance (two weeks prior to the airline hijacking), multiple matches to the hijacker's description, and the reasoning that "a fugitive accused of mass murder has nothing to lose".&lt;ref name="nymagtimeline"&gt;{{cite news| title = D.B.

While his name is still occasionally mentioned in Cooper articles and documentaries, no direct evidence implicates him, and the FBI no longer considers him a suspect.&lt;ref name="NYT20081228"/&gt;

In 2008, [[John Walsh (television host)|John Walsh]], the host of ''America's Most Wanted'', donated the age-progressed bust by Frank Bender that played a pivotal role in List's apprehension to a forensic science exhibit at the now defunct [[National Museum of Crime &amp; Punishment]] in [[Washington, DC]].

In 2015, the story was covered in Season 2, Episode 2 of the [[Investigation Discovery]] show, ''[[Your Worst Nightmare]].'' The episode was named "Murder House" and premiered on November 18, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.investigationdiscovery.com/tv-shows/your-worst-nightmare/ | series=[[Your Worst Nightmare]] | title=Murder House | date=November 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jacob "Kobi" Alexander''' (born May 4, 1952) is an Israeli-American businessman. He is the founder and the former [[CEO]] of [[New York City|New York]]-based [[Comverse Technology]]. In 2006, he was charged with multiple counts of [[fraud]] and related offenses pertaining to irregularities in trading of Comverse stock; he subsequently fled to [[Namibia]], a nation which has no [[extradition treaty]] with the US.

Alexander founded Comverse Technology (NASDAQ: CMVT) in 1982 and built it up from a 3-person Israeli startup to employing over 5,000, becoming the leading provider of software and systems for telecommunication companies worldwide. Comverse's success led to its inclusion in the NASDAQ 100 and S&amp;P 500 indices.

==Early life==

Alexander was born on May 4, 1952, into a middle-class family in [[Kfar Saba]], [[Israel]]. His mother was a school teacher, and his father an officer in the signal corps of the [[Israeli Defense Forces]], and later, the Managing Director of the Israeli National Oil Company.

Following military service, Alexander enrolled in the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], receiving a BA in Economics ''magna cum laude'' in 1977. In 1978 he traveled to the United States earning an MBA at [[New York University]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

In his early years in New York, he met an electrical engineer and together with his brother in law, a professor of Computer Science at Columbia University, the three conceived voice mail technology and developed the idea of what was to become Comverse Technology. The founders understood already then that communications will be a big market, and pioneered the voice mail systems that today are used by telecoms worldwide to support telephony services.

==Career==
{{Update | section | date = October 2016 | inaccurate = yes}}
In 1981, fresh with his NYU MBA, Alexander returned to Israel to bootstrap Comverse. In 1986, after struggling for over 4 years with the company reaching the brink of bankruptcy, the two other founders left their operational roles, and subsequently left the company.

Upon taking the helm, Alexander made three key strategic decisions:
# Selling strictly to telecoms, who in turn represented hundreds of thousands of end user licenses for Comverse systems, and who enabled Comverse to piggyback on their growth.
# Focusing on markets outside the U.S. where competition was weaker, enabling Comverse to establish leadership in certain regions early on.
# Raising financing when market conditions were favorable.

Within a short amount of time, Comverse was back on its feet. A major breakthrough came when Alexander convinced Swiss telecom giant Ascom to invest US$6 million in the company in the mid 1980s, providing Comverse the capital it needed at that time. In 1986, Alexander was able to take Comverse public on the [[NASDAQ]].

In 1997, Comverse bought its main competitor for US$700 million, at the time the largest acquisition to date for an Israeli-based company. Comverse Technology, Inc., which owns 100% of Comverse, also owns majority equity in several other companies, including [[Verint Systems|Verint]] and Ulticom. It has over US$1.5 billion in sales to over 450 telecoms in 120 countries supporting more than 450 million subscribers worldwide. As of March 2006, the company employed approximately 6000 people in over 50 countries, had a market capitalization of approximately US$6 billion, and over US$2.2 billion in cash.

Alexander also formerly owned 25% of the Israeli basketball team [[Maccabi Tel Aviv B.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.themarker.com/misc/1.114884|title=Kobi Alexander, Elite Industries selling holdings in Maccabi Tel Aviv|work=TheMarker|access-date=2017-07-18|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and accomplishments==

For his achievements over the last 25 years, Alexander received the several business awards. He came 12th in Chief Executive Magazine's: "Market Value Added Ranking" of the CEOs of the 1000 largest US corporations, ranking those that "created the most wealth for shareholders".{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The successes of Alexander and Comverse were recognized by the world's leading publications including Barron's, Bloomberg, Business Week, Financial World, Forbes, Fortune, International Business, and Wall Street Journal.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Alexander was awarded "Entrepreneur of the Year" by both Ernst &amp; Young and Deloitte &amp; Touche.

The Wall Street Transcript, naming Kobi Alexander as the Gold Award Winner in the Computer Telephony industry said: "... an exceptional management team have yielded consistently outstanding revenues, earnings, and shareholder value. Alexander has set some very high standards for this company and this industry."{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

[[File:Comverse Logo.jpg|thumb|Comverse]]
In addition to Comverse Technology, Alexander spun off and took public several other companies including Ulticom (NASDAQ: ULCM) and [[Verint Systems]] (NASDAQ: VRNT). Companies under his leadership were listed in Barron's 500, Business Week: "Hot Growth Companies", "Business Week 50", Business Week: "The Information Technology 100", Financial World: "America's Best 100 Growth Companies", Fortune: "100 Fastest Growing Companies"',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2000/09/04/286829/index.htm | publisher = Fortune | work = Ten Stocks: The Best Of The Bunch | title = Betting on high-growth companies is scary.

In 2006, Comverse was named one of Institutional Investor: America's Most Shareholder-Friendly Companies".  "As CEO of Comverse, Alexander was sought out by the likes of former Chinese President [[Jiang Zemin]], who slipped away from official meetings in 2000 and steered his motorcade through a pot-holed section of Tel Aviv to meet with him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://quote.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aJHBHVHTD2JE |work=Bloomberg |title=Former Comverse Chief Alexander Arrested in Namibia (Update8) |date=September 27, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930035232/http://quote.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aJHBHVHTD2JE |archivedate=September 30, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as the [[Chair (official)|Chairman of the Board]] and [[Chief Executive Officer]]  of CTI from 1987 to May 1, 2006, when he resigned during an investigation being conducted by a Special Committee of CTI's [[Board of Directors]] into the timing of CTI's [[stock option]] grants. He was Chairman of several CTI subsidiaries, including [[Verint Systems]] and Ulticom.

==Criminal charges==
On July 31, 2006, Alexander was charged by [[United States Department of Justice]] authorities with multiple charges of [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to commit various types of [[fraud]] (including [[securities fraud]], [[wire fraud]] and [[mail fraud]]), as well as with related offences, all relating to the timing of Comverse's stock option grants.

After Alexander left the [[United States]] on June 21, 2006 on a pre-planned annual vacation in Israel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.namibian.com.na/2006/October/national/064DD41C82.html | publisher = The Namibian | title = A US fugitive, a Namibian brigadier and dollars galore | author = Werner Menges | date = 2006-10-03 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; his lawyers arranged with American authorities that he would return to face [[indictment]] on July 30, 2006; however, he instead traveled to [[Germany]]. On July 31 a warrant was issued for his arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fbi.gov/wanted/alert/alexander_j.htm |title=Jacob Alexander |work=Crime Alert |publisher=[[FBI]] |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010092026/http://www.fbi.gov/wanted/alert/alexander_j.htm |archivedate=October 10, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 9, 2006 the [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission]] filed a civil injunctive action in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York]] against Alexander, along with alleged co-conspirators [[William F. Sorin]], Comverse's former Senior General Counsel, and [[David Kreinberg]], Comverse's former [[Chief Financial Officer]]. The complaint makes nine claims of violation of the [[Securities Act]] and the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934|Exchange Act]], including fraud (First and Second Claims), and falsification of books, records or accounts (Fourth Claim). Through this action, the Commission is seeking [[permanent injunction|permanent injunctive relief]], disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil damages, and a prohibition against any of the defendants becoming officers of a securities-issuing entity under SEC jurisdiction.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Alexander transferred over 40 million dollars from his personal U.S. bank account to his personal bank account in Israel. He was arrested by [[Interpol]] in [[Windhoek, Namibia]] on September 27, 2006.  He was released on bail on October 3, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-6120521.html?part=rss&amp;tag=feed&amp;subj=zdnn | title = Ex-Comverse CEO arrested in Namibia | publisher = [[ZDNet]] | date = 2006-09-27 | author = [[Reuters]] }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/5386276.stm | title = Fugitive US tycoon held in Africa | date = 2006-09-27 | work = Business news | publisher = [[BBC]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=aJHBHVHTD2JE&amp;refer=news | publisher = Bloomberg | title = Former Comverse Chief Alexander Arrested in Namibia | date = 2006-09-27 | author = Bob Van Voris }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.namibian.com.na/2006/September/national/064CE75EFB.html |publisher=The Namibian |title=Namibia swoops on one of FBI's 'most wanted' suspects |author=Werner Menges |date=2006-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609193414/http://www.namibian.com.na/2006/September/national/064CE75EFB.html |archivedate=2007-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a Reuters report of April 23, 2007, the Namibian government described Alexander as "very passionate" about the country and its people;  Alexander has promised to boost academic interest in science and technology in Namibia by establishing an annual scholarship for primary and secondary level students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSL2324973420070423 | work=Reuters | title=Wanted U.S. millionaire starts Namibia student fund | date=April 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also begun to introduce advanced technology to the country with his development of a low budget solar powered housing project for 100 low-income Namibian families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3349589,00.html|title=Alexander invests in Namibia poor|date=2007-08-01|work=Ynetnews|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 3, 2008 a Namibian court split decisions for and against Alexander granting his request to remove the judge currently assigned to preside at his extradition hearing while declining to assign a magistrate of his choosing.

'''Konrad Otto Bernheimer''' (born 30 August 1950) is a German art dealer and collector. He is the chairman and owner of [[Bernheimer Fine Old Masters]] in Munich, and was the owner of [[Colnaghi]] in London. He sold Colnaghi to the Spanish dealers [[Jorge Coll]] and Nicolas Cortés in 2016.

==Early life==
Konrad Otto Bernheimer was born in [[Rubio, Venezuela|Rubio]], Venezuela, on 30 August 1950.&lt;ref name="ClubCarriere"&gt;{{cite book|title=Club Carriere – Enzyklopädie des Erfolges März 2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kLqWwDs7v4IC&amp;pg=PT387|accessdate=27 November 2015|year=2004|publisher=Algoprint Verlags AG|isbn=978-3-9522689-1-9|page=387}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CompaniesHouse&gt;{{cite web|title=P &amp; D Colnaghi &amp; Co Ltd|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/03697496/officers|website=Companies House|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[Kristallnacht]] on 9–10 November 1938, which saw the huge plate glass windows of the [[Bernheimer-Haus]] smashed, the family was sent to [[Dachau concentration camp]]. The Mexican government intervened, as his grandfather [[Otto Bernheimer]] was the Mexican honorary consul in Munich. [[Hermann Göring]], a Bernheimer client, did a deal whereby they bought his niece’s Venezuelan coffee plantation which was struggling, and were allowed to emigrate there, and  also had to take Göring's aunt and her Jewish husband along, and support them until they died.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gleadell|first1=Colin|title=Art Sales: Bernheimer clears out|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/art/89883/art-sales-bernheimer-clears-out.html|accessdate=20 November 2015|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Apollo /&gt;

His father Kurt Bernheimer (1911–1954) committed suicide (which Konrad only found out about when writing his memoirs) in Venezuela, and his Venezuelan mother, Mercedes Uzcátegui Ramírez, and his two sisters joined Otto in Germany, who had returned to Munich in 1945.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

==Career==
[[File:München Lenbachplatz Haus Bernheimer.jpg|thumb|Bernheimer-Haus]]
Konrad O. Bernheimer is the fourth generation of a family dealing in art and antiques, founded by his great-grandfather [[Lehmann Bernheimer]] as ''Bernheimer'' in May 1864.&lt;ref name=colnaghi&gt;{{cite web|title=Konrad Bernheimer|url=http://www.colnaghi.co.uk/konrad-bernheimer|website=colnaghi|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bernheimer_150 /&gt;

Bernheimer took over the family business in 1977, aged 26, and has moved it from a more broadly based art and antiques business to one dealing in Old Masters.&lt;ref name=Apollo&gt;{{cite news|title=Dealer's dynasty: Konrad Bernheimer, Chairman of Pictura at TEFAF, is the fourth generation of a family of distinguished dealers.

In 1987, he sold the [[Bernheimer-Haus]] in Munich, a "massive baroque-style, purpose-built palace ten bays wide and six storeys high".&lt;ref name=Apollo /&gt;

As well as being the chairman and owner of [[Bernheimer Fine Old Masters]], Munich, he owned [[Colnaghi]] in London, founded in 1760, and the world's oldest gallery, which he bought in 2002. He sold the company to the Spanish dealers [[Jorge Coll]] and Nicolas Cortés in 2016. &lt;ref name=bernheimer_150&gt;{{cite web|title=150 Years of Bernheimer Anniversary Exhibition|url=http://www.bernheimer.com/photography/en/exhibition/811/150-years-of-bernheimer-anniversary-exhibition|website=bernheimer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Apollo /&gt;

'''Marketing mix modeling''' ('''MMM''') is statistical analysis such as [[multivariate statistics|multivariate]] [[Linear regression|regressions]] on sales and marketing [[time series]] data to estimate the impact of various [[marketing]] tactics ([[marketing mix]]) on sales and then forecast the impact of future sets of tactics. It is often used to optimize advertising mix and promotional tactics with respect to sales revenue or profit.

The techniques were developed by [[econometrics|econometricians]] and were first applied to [[consumer packaged goods]], since manufacturers of those goods had access to good data on sales and marketing support. The first companies dedicated to the commercial development of MMM were MMA (then Media Marketing Assessment) started in 1990 and the Hudson River Group founded in 1989. Other early pioneer-users of econometric modeling were the ATG group at the advertising agency [[J. Walter Thompson|JWT]] in the 1990s and later incorporated into [[MindShare]] ATG, [[BrandScience]] at [[Omnicom]], and the specialist modeling agency OHAL since the late 1980s. These agencies took MMM from being a little-used and academic discipline to being a widespread and common marketing tool. Improved availability of data, massively greater computing power, and the pressure to measure and optimize marketing spend has driven the explosion in popularity as a marketing tool. In the recent times MMM has found acceptance as a trustworthy marketing tool among the major consumer marketing companies. Often in the digital media context, MMM is referred to as attribution modeling.

==History==

The term [[marketing mix]] was developed by [[Neil Borden]] who first started using the phrase in 1949. “An executive is a mixer of ingredients, who sometimes follows a recipe as he goes along, sometimes adapts a recipe to the ingredients immediately available, and sometimes experiments with or invents ingredients no one else has tried." (Culliton, J. 1948)

According to Borden, "When building a marketing program to fit the needs of his firm, the marketing manager has to weigh the behavioral forces and then juggle marketing elements in his mix with a keen eye on the resources with which he has to work." (Borden, N. 1964 pg 365).

[[E. Jerome McCarthy]] (McCarthy, J. 1960), was the first person to suggest the [[four P's]] of marketing&amp;nbsp;– price, promotion, product and place (distribution)&amp;nbsp;– which constitute the most common variables used in constructing a marketing mix. According to McCarthy the marketers essentially have these four variables which they can use while crafting a marketing strategy and writing a [[marketing plan]]. In the long term, all four of the mix variables can be changed, but in the short term it is difficult to modify the product or the distribution channel.

Another set of marketing mix variables were developed by Albert Frey (Frey, A. 1961) who classified the marketing variables into two categories: the offering, and process variables. The "offering" consists of the product, service, packaging, [[brand]], and price. The "process" or "method" variables included advertising, promotion, sales promotion, personal selling, [[publicity]], distribution channels, [[marketing research]], strategy formation, and new [[product development]].

Recently, Bernard Booms and Mary Bitner built a model consisting of seven P's (Booms, B. and Bitner, M. 1981). They added "People" to the list of existing variables, in order to recognize the importance of the human element in all aspects of marketing. They added "process" to reflect the fact that services, unlike physical products, are experienced as a process at the time that they are purchased. Desktop modeling tools such as Micro TSP have made this kind of statistical analysis part of the mainstream now. Most advertising agencies and strategy consulting firms offer MMM services to their clients.

==Marketing mix model==

Marketing mix modeling is an analytical approach that uses historic information, such as syndicated point-of-sale data and companies’ internal data, to quantify the sales impact of various marketing activities. Mathematically, this is done by establishing a simultaneous relation of various marketing activities with the sales, in the form of a linear or a non-linear equation, through the statistical technique of [[Regression analysis|regression]]. MMM defines the effectiveness of each of the marketing elements in terms of its contribution to sales-volume, effectiveness (volume generated by each unit of effort), efficiency (sales volume generated divided by cost) and [[Rate of return|ROI]]. These learnings are then adopted to adjust marketing tactics and strategies, optimize the marketing plan and also to forecast sales while simulating various scenarios.

This is accomplished by setting up a model with the sales volume/value as the dependent variable and independent variables created out of the various marketing efforts. The creation of variables for Marketing Mix Modeling is a complicated affair and is as much an art as it is a science. The balance between automated modeling tools crunching large data sets versus the artisan econometrician is an ongoing debate in MMM, with different agencies and consultants taking a position at certain points in this spectrum. Once the variables are created, multiple iterations are carried out to create a model which explains the volume/value trends well. Further validations are carried out, either by using a validation data, or by the consistency of the business results.

The output can be used to analyze the impact of the marketing elements on various dimensions. The contribution of each element as a percentage of the total plotted year on year is a good indicator of how the effectiveness of various elements changes over the years. The yearly change in contribution is also measured by a due-to analysis which shows what percentage of the change in total sales is attributable to each of the elements. For activities like television advertising and trade promotions, more sophisticated analysis like effectiveness can be carried out. This analysis tells the marketing manager the incremental gain in sales that can be obtained by increasing the respective marketing element by one unit. If detailed spend information per activity is available then it is possible to calculate the [[Return on Investment]] of the marketing activity. Not only is this useful for reporting the historical effectiveness of the activity, it also helps in optimizing the marketing budget by identifying the most and least efficient marketing activities.

Once the final model is ready, the results from it can be used to simulate marketing scenarios for a [[Sensitivity analysis|‘What-if’ analysis]]. The marketing managers can reallocate this marketing budget in different proportions and see the direct impact on sales/value. They can optimize the budget by allocating spends to those activities which give the highest return on investment.

Some MMM approaches like to include multiple products or brands fighting against each other in an industry or category model - where cross-price relationships and advertising share of voice is considered as important for wargaming.

===Components===
Marketing-mix models decompose total sales into two components:

'''Base Sales''': This is the natural demand for the product driven by economic factors like pricing, long-term trends, [[seasonality]], and also qualitative factors like [[brand awareness]] and [[brand loyalty]].

'''Incremental Sales''': Incremental sales are the component of sales driven by marketing and promotional activities. This component can be further decomposed into sales due to each marketing component like [[Television advertising]] or [[Radio advertising]], [[Print Advertising]] (magazines, newspapers etc.), Coupons, [[Direct mail|Direct Mail]], Internet, Feature or Display Promotions and Temporary Price Reductions. Some of these activities have short-term returns (Coupons, Promotions), while others have longer term returns (TV, Radio, Magazine/Print).

Marketing-Mix analyses are typically carried out using [[Linear Regression]] Modeling. [[Nonlinear]] and lagged effects are included using techniques like [[Advertising Adstock]] transformations. Typical output of such analyses include a decomposition of total annual sales into contributions from each marketing component, a.k.a. Contribution pie-chart.

Another standard output is a decomposition of year-over year sales growth/decline, a.k.a. ‘Due-to charts’.

===Elements measured in MMM===

====Base and incremental volume====
The very break-up of sales volume into base (volume that would be generated in absence of any marketing activity) and incremental (volume generated by marketing activities in the short run) across time gain gives wonderful insights. The base grows or declines across longer periods of time while the activities generating the incremental volume in the short run also impact the base volume in the long run. The variation in the base volume is a good indicator of the strength of the brand and the loyalty it commands from its users.

====Media and advertising====
Market mix modeling can determine the sales impact generated by individual media such as television, magazine, and online display ads. In some cases it can be used to determine the impact of individual advertising campaigns or even ad executions upon sales. For example, for TV advertising activity, it is possible to examine how each ad execution has performed in the market in terms of its impact on sales volume. MMM can also provide information on TV correlations at different [[media weight]] levels, as measured by [[Gross Rating Points]] (GRP) in relation to sales volume response within a time frame, be it a week or a month. Information can also be gained on the minimum level of GRPs (threshold limit) in a week that need to be aired in order to make an impact, and conversely, the level of GRPs at which the impact on volume maximizes (saturation limit) and that the further activity does not have any payback. While not all MMM's will be able to produce definitive answers to all questions, some additional areas in which insights can sometimes be gained include: 1) the effectiveness of 15-second vis-à-vis 30-second executions; 2)comparisons in ad performance when run during prime-time vis-à-vis off-prime-time dayparts; 3) comparisons into the direct and the halo effect of TV activity across various products or sub-brands. The role of new product based TV activity and the equity based TV activity in growing the brand can also be compared. GRP's are converted into reach (i.e. GRPs are divided by the average frequency to get the percentage of people actually watching the advertisement). This is a better measure for modeling TV.

====Trade promotions====
Trade promotion is a key activity in every marketing plan. It is aimed at increasing sales in the short term by employing promotion schemes which effectively increases the customer awareness of the business and its products. The response of consumers to trade promotions is not straight forward and is the subject of much debate. Non-linear models exist to simulate the response. Using MMM we can understand the impact of trade promotion at generating incremental volumes. It is possible to obtain an estimate of the volume generated per promotion event in each of the different retail outlets by region. This way we can identify the most and least effective trade channels. If detailed spend information is available we can compare the Return on Investment of various trade activities like Every Day Low Price, Off-Shelf Display. We can use this information to optimize the trade plan by choosing the most effective trade channels and targeting the most effective promotion activity.

====Pricing====
Price increases of the brand impact the sales negatively. This effect can be captured through modeling the price in MMM. The model provides the price elasticity of the brand which tells us the percentage change in the sales for each percentage change in price. Using this, the marketing manager can evaluate the impact of a price change decision.

====Distribution====
For the element of distribution, we can know how the volume will move by changing distribution efforts or, in other words, by each percentage shift in the width or the depth of distribution. This can be identified specifically for each channel and even for each kind of outlet for off-take sales. In view of these insights, the distribution efforts can be prioritized for each channel or store-type to get the maximum out of the same. A recent study of a laundry brand showed that the incremental volume through 1% more presence in a neighborhood Kirana store is 180% greater than that through 1% more presence in a supermarket.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/catalyst/2007/05/24/stories/2007052400080200.htm, 12. Sept. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Based upon the cost of such efforts, managers identified the right channel to invest more for distribution.

====Launches====
When a new product is launched, the associated publicity and promotions typically results in higher volume generation than expected. This extra volume cannot be completely captured in the model using the existing variables. Often special variables to capture this incremental effect of launches are used. The combined contribution of these variables and that of the marketing effort associated with the launch will give the total launch contribution. Different launches can be compared by calculating their effectiveness and ROI.

====Competition====
The impact of competition on the brand sales is captured by creating the competition variables accordingly. The variables are created from the marketing activities of the competition like television advertising, trade promotions, product launches etc. The results from the model can be used to identify the biggest threat to own brand sales from competition. The cross-price elasticity and the cross-promotional elasticity can be used to devise appropriate response to competition tactics. A successful competitive campaign can be analyzed to learn valuable lesson for the own brand.

==Studies in MMM==
Typical MMM studies provide the following insights
* Contribution by marketing activity
* ROI by marketing activity
* Effectiveness of marketing activity
* Optimal distribution of spends
* Learnings on how to execute each activity better e.g. optimal GRPs per week, optimal distribution between 15s and 30s, which promos to run, what SKUS to put on promotion etc.

==Adoption of MMM by the industry==
Over the past 20 years many large companies, particularly consumer packaged goods firms, have adopted MMM. Many Fortune 500 companies such as P&amp;G, AT&amp;T, Kraft, Coca-Cola and Pepsi have made MMM an integral part of their marketing planning. This has also been made possible due to the availability of specialist firms that are now providing MMM services.

Marketing mix models were more popular initially in the CPG industry and quickly spread to Retail and Pharma industries because of the availability of Syndicated Data in these industries (primarily from [[Nielsen Company]] and [[IRI (company)|IRI]] and to a lesser extent from [[NPD Group]] and [[Bottom Line Analytics]] and [[Gain Theory]]). Availability of Time-series data is crucial to robust modeling of marketing-mix effects and with the systematic management of customer data through CRM systems in other industries like Telecommunications, Financial Services, Automotive and Hospitality industries helped its spread to these industries. In addition competitive and industry data availability through third-party sources like [[Forrester Research]]'s Ultimate Consumer Panel (Financial Services), Polk Insights (Automotive) and Smith Travel Research (Hospitality), further enhanced the application of marketing-mix modeling to these industries. Application of marketing-mix modeling to these industries is still in a nascent stage and a lot of standardization needs to be brought about especially in these areas:
* Interpretation of promotional activities across industries for e.g. promotions in CPG do not have lagged effects as they happen in-store, but automotive and hospitality promotions are usually deployed through the internet or through dealer marketing and can have longer lags in their impact. CPG promotions are usually absolute price discounts, whereas Automotive promotions can be cash-backs or loan incentives, and Financial Services promotions are usually interest rate discounts.
* Hospitality industry marketing has a very heavy seasonal pattern and most marketing-mix models will tend to confound marketing effectiveness with seasonality, thus overestimating or underestimating marketing ROI. Time-series Cross-Sectional models like 'Pooled Regression' need to be utilized, which increase sample size and variation and thus make a robust separation of pure marketing-effects from seasonality.
* Automotive Manufacturers spend a substantial amount of their marketing budgets on dealer advertising, which may not be accurately measurable if not modeled at the right level of aggregation. If modeled at the national level or even the market or DMA level, these effects may be lost in aggregation bias. On the other hand, going all the way down to dealer-level may overestimate marketing effectiveness as it would ignore [[consumer switching]] between dealers in the same area. The correct albeit rigorous approach would be to determine what dealers to combine into 'addable' common groups based on overlapping 'trade-areas' determined by consumer zip codes and cross-shopping information. At the very least 'Common Dealer Areas' can be determined by clustering dealers based on geographical distance between dealers and share of county sales. Marketing-mix models built by 'pooling' monthly sales for these dealer clusters will be effectively used to measure the impact of dealer advertising effectively.

The proliferation of marketing-mix modeling was also accelerated due to the focus from Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 that required internal controls for financial reporting on significant expenses and outlays. Marketing for consumer goods can be in excess of a 10th of total revenues and until the advent of marketing-mix models, relied on qualitative or 'soft' approaches to evaluate this spend. Marketing-mix modeling presented a rigorous and consistent approach to evaluate marketing-mix investments as the CPG industry had already demonstrated. A study by American Marketing Association pointed out that top management was more likely to stress the importance of marketing accountability than middle management, suggesting a top-down push towards greater accountability.

==Limitations==
While marketing mix models provide much useful information, there are two key areas in which these models have limitations that should be taken into account by all of those that use these models for decision making purposes. These limitations, discussed more fully below, include:

1) the focus on short-term sales can significantly under-value the importance of longer-term equity building activities; and

2) when used for media mix optimization, these models have a clear bias in favor of time-specific media (such as TV commercials) versus less time-specific media (such as ads appearing in monthly magazines); biases can also occur when comparing broad-based media versus regionally or demographically targeted media.

In relation to the bias against equity building activities, marketing budgets optimized using marketing-mix models may tend too much towards efficiency because marketing-mix models measure only the short-term effects of marketing. Longer term effects of marketing are reflected in its brand equity. The impact of marketing spend on [brand equity] is usually not captured by marketing-mix models. One reason is that the longer duration that marketing takes to impact brand perception extends beyond the simultaneous or, at best, weeks-ahead impact of marketing on sales that these models measure. The other reason is that temporary fluctuation in sales due to economic and social conditions do not necessarily mean that marketing has been ineffective in building brand equity. On the contrary, it is very possible that in the short term sales and market-share could deteriorate, but brand equity could actually be higher. This higher equity should in the long run help the brand recover sales and market-share.

Because marketing-mix models suggest a marketing tactic has a positive impact on sales doesn't necessarily mean it has a positive impact on long-term brand equity. Different marketing measures impact short-term and long-term brand sales differently and adjusting the marketing portfolio to maximize either the short-term or the long-term alone will be sub-optimal. For example, the short-term positive effect of promotions on consumers’ utility induces consumers to switch to the promoted brand, but the adverse impact of promotions on brand equity carries over from period to period. Therefore, the net effect of promotions on a brand’s market share and profitability can be negative due to their adverse impact on brand. Determining marketing ROI on the basis of marketing-mix models alone can lead to misleading results. This is because marketing-mix attempts to optimize marketing-mix to increase incremental contribution, but marketing-mix also drives brand-equity, which is not part of the incremental part measured by marketing-mix model- it is part of the baseline. True '[[Return on Marketing Investment]]' is a sum of short-term and long-term ROI. The fact that most firms use marketing-mix models only to measure the short-term ROI can be inferred from an article by [[Booz Allen Hamilton]], which suggests that there is a significant shift away from traditional media to 'below-the-line' spending, driven by the fact that promotional spending is easier to measure. But academic studies have shown that promotional activities are in fact detrimental to long-term marketing ROI (Ataman et al., 2006). Short-term marketing-mix models can be combined with brand-equity models using brand-tracking data to measure 'brand ROI', in both the short- and long-term. Finally, the modeling process itself should not be more costly than the resulting gain in profitability; i.e. it should have a positive [[Return on modeling effort|Return On Modeling Effort (ROME)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.decisionanalyst.com/whitepapers/marketingmixmodeling/|title=Marketing Mix Modeling|last=Thomas|first=Jerry W.|year=2006|access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second limitation of marketing mix models comes into play when advertisers attempt to use these models to determine the best media allocation across different media types. The traditional use of MMM's to compare money spent on TV versus money spent on couponing was relatively valid in that both TV commercials and the appearance of coupons (for example, in a FSI run in a newspaper) were both quite time specific. However, as the use of these models has been expanded into comparisons across a wider range of media types, extreme caution should be used.

Even with traditional media such as magazine advertising, the use of MMM's to compare results across media can be problematic; while the modelers overlay models of the 'typical' viewing curves of monthly magazines, these lack in precision, and thus introduce additional variability into the equation. Thus, comparisons of the effectiveness of running a TV commercial versus the effectiveness of running a magazine ad would be biased in favor of TV, with its greater precision of measurement. As new forms of media proliferate, these limitations become even more important to consider if MMM's are to be used in attempts to quantify their effectiveness. For example, Sponsorship Marketing, Sports Affinity Marketing, Viral Marketing, Blog Marketing and Mobile Marketing all vary in terms of the time-specificity of exposure.

Further, most approaches to marketing-mix models try to include all marketing activities in aggregate at the national or regional level, but to the extent that various tactics are targeted to different demographic consumer groups, their impact may be lost. For example, Mountain Dew sponsorship of NASCAR may be targeted to NASCAR fans, which may include multiple age groups, but Mountain Dew advertising on gaming blogs may be targeted to the Gen Y population. Both of these tactics may be highly effective within the corresponding demographic groups but, when included in aggregate in a national or regional marketing-mix model, may come up as ineffective.

Aggregation bias, along with issues relating to variations in the time-specific natures of different media, pose serious problems when these models are used in ways beyond those for which they were originally designed. As media become even more fragmented, it is critical that these issues are taken into account if marketing-mix models are used to judge the relative effectiveness of different media and tactics.

Marketing-mix models use historical performance to evaluate marketing performance and so are not an effective tool to manage marketing investments for new products. This is because the relatively short history of new products make marketing-mix results unstable. Also relationship between marketing and sales may be radically different in the launch and stable periods. For example, the initial performance of Coke Zero was really poor and showed low advertising elasticity. In spite of this Coke increased its media spend, with an improved strategy and radically improved its performance resulting in advertising effectiveness that is probably several times the effectiveness during the launch period. A typical marketing-mix model would have recommended cutting media spend and instead resorting to heavy price discounting.

'''Mu Sigma''' is an Indian [[management consulting]] firm that primarily offers [[data analytics]] services.  The firm's name is derived from the statistical terms "Mu (μ)" and "Sigma (σ)" which symbolize the [[mean]] and the [[standard deviation]] respectively of a [[probability distribution]]. Mu Sigma is headquartered in [[Bengaluru]] and has a United States branch office in [[Chicago]].

== History ==
Mu Sigma was founded by [[Dhiraj Rajaram]], a former strategy consultant for the India branches of [[Booz Allen Hamilton]] and [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]], in 2004.&lt;ref name="GettingNumbersRight" /&gt; 
In 2008, Mu Sigma raised its first institutional investment round of $30 million from FTVentures (now FTV Capital).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = FTVentures Commits $30 Million to Mu Sigma (press release) | date = September 24, 2008 | work = FTVentures | url = http://www.ftvcapital.com/newsletters/20081001.html | accessdate = June 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011, the company raised an additional $25 million from [[Sequoia Capital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date = June 6, 2011 | title = The Daily Start-Up: Sequoia Makes "Big Data" Move With Mu Sigma | work = Venture Capital Dispatch | publisher = [[Wall Street Journal]] | url = https://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2011/06/06/the-daily-start-up-sequoia-makes-big-data-move-with-mu-sigma/ | accessdate = June 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, the company announced a $108 million round of financing from Sequoia and growth equity investor [[General Atlantic]].&lt;ref name="WSJBigMoney"&gt;{{cite news | title = Mu Sigma Lands Big Money for Big Data |publisher = [[The Wall Street Journal]] | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203899504577126720815824762 | date = December 29, 2011 | accessdate = Nov 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013, Mu Sigma received an investment of $45 million from [[MasterCard]], which placed the company over the $1 billion (Rs. 5,400 crore{{efn|At time of transaction}}) milestone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-02-20/news/37200522_1_dhiraj-rajaram-mu-sigma-data-analytics | work=The Times Of India | title=Mu Sigma attracts a clutch of foreign investors, gets valued at  billion, Dhiraj Rajaram is now king of data analysis,data science and predictions by  | date=February 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2016, the company was sued by [[Aon (company)|Aon Corp]] founder [[Pat Ryan (executive)|Pat Ryan]], who discussed that Mu Sigma lowballed its own growth prospects in order to buy back Ryan's stake in the company. Ryan won the court case.&lt;ref name=mehrotra&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mehrotra|first1=Kartikay|title=Aon founder Pat Ryan sues Mu Sigma, claims lowball buyout|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/technology/ct-pat-ryan-mu-sigma-20160310-story.html|accessdate=21 December 2017|work=Chicago Tribune|date=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016 Dhiraj Rajaram took over the role of CEO from his estranged wife, Ambiga Subramanian, who was currently serving as CEO at the time. The couple split in 2016, post which Dhiraj became the CEO.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.financialexpress.com/industry/unicorn-mu-sigma-founder-dhiraj-rajaram-takes-control-including-role-of-ceofrom-estranged-wife/406130/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://inc42.com/buzz/mu-sigma-ambiga-subramanian-social-media-startup-hyphen-social/|title=Mu Sigma’s Ex-CEO Ambiga Subramanian To Roll Out Her Own Social Media Startup Hyphen.Social|date=2017-11-10|work=Inc42 Media|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|'''Pentaho BA Platform''' || EE, CE || Server application || 7.1 || 7.1 || Commonly referred to as the BI Platform, and recently renamed Business Analytics Platform (BA Platform), makes up the core software piece that hosts content created both in the server itself through plug-ins or files published to the server from the desktop applications.  It includes features for managing security, running reports, displaying dashboards, report bursting, scripted business rules, OLAP analysis and scheduling out of the box.  &lt;br&gt;Commercial plug-ins from Pentaho expand out-of-the-box features.  A few open-source plug-in projects also expand capabilities of the server.  The Pentaho BA Platform runs in the Apache [[Application server#Java application servers|Java Application Server]].  It can be embedded into other Java Application Servers.

|-
| '''Pentaho Analysis Services (Mondrian)''' || EE, CE || Server application || 3.7.0 || [http://sourceforge.net/projects/mondrian/files/ 3.6.1] ||Pentaho Analysis Services, codenamed [[Mondrian OLAP server|Mondrian]],  is an [[open-source software|open-source]] [[Online analytical processing|OLAP]] (online analytical processing) [[Server (computing)|server]], written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]].
It supports the [[MultiDimensional eXpressions|MDX]] (multidimensional expressions) query language and the [[XML for Analysis]] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20150312031439/http://www.olap4j.org/ olap4j] interface specifications.  It reads from [[SQL]] and other data sources and aggregates data in a memory cache.  Mondrian can be run separately from the Pentaho BI Platform, but is always bundled with the platform itself in both EE and CE versions.

|-
| '''Pentaho Dashboard Designer (PDD)''' || EE || Server plug-in || 5.0.6 || - || A commercial plug-in provided to enterprise edition (EE) subscribers.  It allows users to create [[Dashboards (management information systems)|dashboards]], which are collections of other content components displayed together with the goal of providing a centralized view of [[Key performance indicator| key performance indicators (KPI)s]] and other business data movements, letting users monitor them and make decisions.  Content components are usually individual [[Information graphics]], tables, OLAP views or reports.  The plug-in simplifies dashboard creation through the use of layout templates, drag-and-drop interaction and a [[GUI]] for providing parameters and inputs to dashboard components.

|-
| '''Pentaho Analysis (Analyzer) (PAZ)''' || EE || Server plug-in || 5.0.6 || - || The Pentaho Analyzer plug-in provides a web-based, drag-and-drop OLAP viewer. It allows a user to visually create MDX queries by dragging parts of a previously defined Mondrian OLAP schema onto a canvas, where other activities can take place like filtering, sorting, creating calculated members from other measures, exporting the result table to PDF or MS Excel, and optionally graphing the data.  It is also known to work on Apple iPads by using the Safari web browser.
|-
| '''Pentaho Interactive Reporting (PIR)''' || EE || Server plug-in || 5.0.6 || - || This plug-in enables users to create [[ad hoc]] reports in a visual drag-and-drop fashion.
|-
| '''Pentaho Data Access Wizard''' ||EE, CE|| Server plug-in || - || - || This plug-in is bundled with all servers and allows users to create new data sources for use throughout the system from other databases or CSV files uploaded to the server while using a setup wizard.  During the steps of creating a data source users also are given a chance to create a data model describing how columns or fields relate to each other creating hierarchies of relationships like Time: Year, Quarters, Months, Weeks and Product Division, Category, Type etc.  The resultant model is used by Mondrian and any other plug-in like Analyzer or Saiku to create new queries against the newly created data source.  This component is part of what Pentaho introduces as agile BI, which simply means having a way to start from basic data and quickly iterate through steps to discover the proper way to structure, study and present the data.&lt;ref name="pentahodataaccess"&gt;Michael Terallo, Pentaho [http://www.pentahoevalcenter.com/content-creation-delivery/data-access-wizard/ Data Access Wizard] Retrieved July 29, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
| '''Pentaho Metadata Editor (PME)''' || EE, CE || Desktop application || 6.1 || The metadata editor is used to create business models and act as an abstraction layer from the underlying data sources.  The resulting metadata models are used by Pentaho Interactive Reporting, Saiku Reporting, and Pentaho's legacy AD HOC reporting plug-in applications to create reports within the BA server without using any of the other external desktop applications.
|-
| '''Pentaho Aggregate Designer (PAD)''' || EE, CE || Desktop application || 6.1 || Aggregate Designer operates on Pentaho Analysis (Mondrian) XML schema files and the database with the underlying tables described by the schema to generate precalculated, aggregated answers to speed up analysis work and MDX queries executed against Mondrian.  This is accomplished by the software examining the hierarchies described in the schema and the measures also defined there and generating SQL which would result in the creation of tables storing those answers away for future use by Mondrian.  After using the software to generate these aggregate tables, the original Mondrian XML schema file describing the OLAP cube is modified to reference the precomputed results.

|-
| '''Pentaho Schema Workbench (PSW)''' || EE, CE || Desktop application || [http://sourceforge.net/projects/mondrian/files/schema%20workbench/ 3.5.0] || Pentaho Schema Workbench provides a graphical interface for designing OLAP cubes for Pentaho Analysis (Mondrian).  The schema created is stored as a regular XML file on disk.  It is not necessary to use the Schema Workbench to create schema, but it is often helpful for beginners and even experts who need go inspect a cube visually and come up to speed with how to maintain or extend it.

|-
| '''Pentaho Design Studio (PDS)''' || EE, CE || Desktop application || [http://sourceforge.net/projects/pentaho/files/Design%20Studio/ 4.0] || The Pentaho BA Server supports special XML scripts called xactions to implement business logic and other forms of automation in the platform.  Design Studio is a modified version of the Eclipse Development Environment with a plug-in designed to understand the components supported by xaction scripts.  Xactions are very powerful, and useful, but sometimes prove difficult to troubleshoot because of the low-level way they interact with parts of the BA server.  Developers are starting to use Pentaho Data Integration transformation files to carry out automation and business logic tasks.  The transformations can be run directly by the BA Server and visually debugged in Pentaho Data Integration (PDI) and are quickly gaining favor in the community over xactions. It is a small leap to imagine PDI transformations will eventually replace xactions entirely.

'''Process Lifecycle''' is a manner of looking at processes, in the context of their initial, maturing and final stages of evolution and growth.  Understanding and analyzing processes in this manner helps to understand how they fit into a "system" of processes as well as how they change as a process matures within an organization.

This manner of analysis is a companion to the [[systems thinking]] discipline that is defined as any process of estimating or inferring how local policies, actions, or changes influences the state of the neighboring universe. It is an approach to [[problem solving]] that views "problems" as parts of an overall system, rather than reacting to present outcomes or events and potentially contributing to further development of the undesired issue or problem.[1] Systems thinking is a framework that is based on the belief that the component parts of a system can best be understood in the context of relationships with each other and with other systems, rather than in isolation. The only way to fully understand why a problem or element occurs and persists is to understand the part in relation to the whole.[2] Standing in contrast to [[René Descartes|Descartes's]] [[scientific reductionism]] and [[philosophical analysis]], it proposes to view systems in a holistic manner. Consistent with [[Systems Philosophy|systems philosophy]], systems thinking concerns an understanding of a system by examining the linkages and interactions between the elements that compose the entirety of the system.

{{Notability|date=February 2018}}

'''Ricardo Armbruster''' (1944 – 1976) was a Spanish ecologist, adventurer and entrepreneur.

Ricardo Armbruster Blecher (Nano) was born in [[Madrid]] to the German/Spanish family Armbruster/Blecher. His father Eugen Armbruster was a successful industrialist in Spain (tubes, plastics, metals, energy, banks, forests) and his mother, Trude Armbruster ([[Given name|née]] Blecher) was a renowned violinist.

At an early age, Ricardo Armbruster and his family discovered that schooling and academic life were not going to be his preferred way of advancing personally. He developed a wide interest in animals and nature in the 1950s, spending long periods at the family farm in [[Camorritos]], Spain, and becoming a respected naturalist at a very early stage. Soon afterwards, at the age of 17, he decided to travel and learn. He spent some time at several academies and jobs in Switzerland, Germany and [[London]], before returning to Madrid and, from there, to the American continent. First, he traveled around the United States and Mexico with his brother and friends, before accepting a job at a bookstore in [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]]. After feeling frustrated by the fact that the store sold books by length for decoration rather than for reading, he felt the call of the wild, embarked on a trip to the south and disappeared in the [[Amazon rainforest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Corbillón |first1=Antonio |title=En el Amazonas sin mapas, guía, ni GPS |url=https://www.eldiariomontanes.es/on-extra/201703/19/amazonas-mapas-guia-20170318190826.html |work=El Diario Montañes |date=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some time later Ricardo Armbruster reappeared in [[Tenerife]], on the [[Canary Islands]]. He had made a living by hunting in the forest, making research films, helping national armies explore new territories and, in the end, smuggling coffee to pay for a ship fare back to Europe.

Back in Spain, Ricardo Armbruster settled down, married Erika Born, another German/Spanish national, and had two children: Yaukuma (named after a [[Mehinako people|Mehinaku]] Indian of the [[Xingu River|Xingú River]] Basin) and Thurit Armbruster. The couple moved to [[Valladolid]], in the north of Spain, where Ricardo Armbruster became a successful entrepreneur but was mostly recognized for his activist ecologism and political positioning (against the [[Spanish State]] of [[caudillo]] [[Francisco Franco]].

Ricardo Armbruster was one of the driving forces behind the creation of the [[AEORMA]] ecologist group, a strictly forbidden activity under the [[Francoist State]]. He was also, with Julio Valdeón Baruque, José Luis Martín, José Luis Barrigón, Carlos Santamaría, Carlos Carrasco, Manuel Conde and others, the driving force behind the creation of the [[Instituto Regional Castellano-Leonés]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Adiós a Rafa Álvarez-Taladriz, pionero del ecologismo |url=http://ultimocero.com/noticias/2016/11/03/adios-a-rafa-alvarez-taladriz-pionero-del-ecologismo/ |publisher=Ultimocero |date=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; an autonomy-enhancing entity that was subject to severe persecution by Franco´s authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Berzal |first1=Enrique |title=Gran medievalista, profesor e impulsor de Castilla y León |url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2009/06/22/opinion/16330706.html |work=El Mundo |date=22 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;Historia del movimiento castellano leonés&gt;

Erika and Ricardo Armbruster's home in the Castillian countryside ([[La Corala]]) soon became a preferred stop for zoologists and naturalists in the early 1970s, who brought over every kind of fauna to be treated and cured. This made the premises look more like a zoo than a private home. The property also became a hot spot for debates about democracy and ecology among Spanish intellectuals, artists and oligarchs who appreciated Armbruster's views on these subjects.

A rebel [[Christian]] (he married under scrutiny and press coverage following the [[Catholic]] and [[Lutheran]] rituals at a time of [[National Catholicism]] in Spain), Ricardo Armbruster died on Easter Sunday in April 1976, at the age of 32, in [[Ribadesella]], [[Asturias]] (Spain), while scuba diving in search of eels and other sea species in the cold waters of the [[Cantabrian Sea]].&lt;El Norte de Castilla&gt;

'''Richard Katemi Makenga''' is a [[Kenya]]n [[Businessperson|businessman]] and [[politician]], who is currently the Member of National Assembly for [[Kaiti Constituency]] in [[Makueni County]], Kenya.

He was elected Member of National Assembly in March 2013 after many unsuccessful attempts to clinch the seat, taking over from [[Gideon Ndambuki]] who had quit the parliamentary race to run for Makueni Senator seat in the same general election but lost the [[Wiper Democratic Movement – Kenya|Wiper Democratic Movement]] ticket to the late [[Mutula Kilonzo]] who would eventually be elected senator. Mutula died slightly over a month after the general elections.

Makenga has been running private businesses, mostly in the Clearing and Forwarding industry since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;https://kenyan-politicians.popit.mysociety.org/persons/core_person%3A1650#political-career&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4191">'''Silk waste''' includes all kinds of raw [[silk]] which may be unwindable, and therefore unsuited to the [[Silk throwing|throwing process]]. Before the introduction of machinery applicable to the spinning of silk waste, the refuse from [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoon]] reeling, and also from silk winding, which is now used in producing spun silk fabrics, was nearly all destroyed as being useless, with the exception of that which could be hand-combed and spun by means of the [[distaff]] and [[spinning wheel]], a method which is still practised by some of the peasantry in [[India]] and other countries in [[Asia]].

==Sources==
The supply of waste silk is drawn from the following sources:

* The [[silkworm]], when commencing to spin, emits a dull, lustreless and uneven thread with which it suspends itself from the twigs and leaves of the tree upon which it has been feeding, or  the straws provided for it by attendants in the worm-rearing establishments: this first thread is unreelable, and, moreover, is often mixed with straw, leaves and twigs.
* The outside layers of the true [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoon]] are too coarse and uneven for reeling; and as the worm completes its task of spinning, the thread becomes finer and weaker, so both the extreme outside and inside layers are put aside as waste.
* Pierced cocoons, that is, those from which the moth of the silkworm has emerged-and damaged cocoons.
* During the process of reeling from the cocoon the silk often breaks; and both in finding a true and reliable thread, and in joining the ends, there is unavoidable waste.
* Raw silk skeins are often re-reeled; and in this process part has to be discarded: this being known to the trade as gum-waste. The same term—gum-waste—is applied to "waste" made in the various processes of silk throwing; but manufacturers using threads known technically as organzines and trams call the surplus "manufacturer's waste."

==Processing==
A silk "[[wiktionary:throwster|throwster]]" receives the silk in skein form, the thread of which consists of a number of silk fibres wound together to make a certain diameter or size, the separate fibre having actually been spun by the worm. The silk-waste spinner receives the silk in quite a different form: merely the raw material, packed in [[:wikt:bale#Etymology 3|bales]] of various sizes and weights, the contents being a much-tangled mass of all lengths of fibre mixed with much foreign matter, such as ends of straws, twigs, leaves, worms and [[chrysalis]]. It is the spinner's business to straighten out these fibres, with the aid of machinery, and then to so join them that they become a thread, which is known as spun silk.

All silk produced by the worm is composed of two substances: [[fibroin]], the true thread, and [[sericin]], which is a hard, gummy coating of the fibroin. Before the silk can be manipulated by machinery to any advantage, the gum coating must be removed, really dissolved and washed away. Where the method used in achieving this operation is through fermentation, the product is called '''schappe'''. The former, schapping, is the French, Italian and Swiss method, from which the silk when finished is neither so bright nor so good in colour as the discharged silk; but it is very clean and level, and for some purposes essential, as, for instance, in [[velvet]] manufacture.

'''Syarhei Parsyukevich''' ({{lang-be|Сяргей Парсюкевіч}}, '''Siarhiej Parsiukievič''', born 14 May 1967 in [[Vitebsk]]) is a [[Belarus]]ian small businessman who was sentenced to 2.5 years of jail and a compensation of 1.5 Million Br for protesting against a decree introducing severe limitations for [[Small and medium enterprises]]. His arrest became a large scandal in Belarus, Parsyukevich is considered by many, including the US [[Department of State]][http://www.charter97.org/ru/news/2008/5/1/6282/] to be a political prisoner.

Parsyukevich is a retired police officer who started doing his business in [[Viciebsk]] in 2004. He was leader of a union of individual businessmen of the "Smalensk market".

On January 10 he took part in a demonstration of small and medium businesspeople in [[Minsk]] protesting against the presidential decree #760 that introduced limitations to SME's business (for instance, allowing them to hire only relatives of the business owner). On January 13 he was arrested in [[Viciebsk]] and brought to Minsk. On the following day he was given 15 days of arrest for participating in the demonstration. During this period he went on [[hunger strike]].

On January, 21 Syarhej Parsyukevich was probably strongly beaten up in jail by a policeman. Soon after his liberation, he was accused of having beaten up the policeman himself.

On April, 23, the next day after the final trial of [[Andrei Kim]], another person considered as political prisoner, Parsyukevich was sentenced to 2.5 years of jail and a compensation of 1.5 Million Br. The fact that he is a former police officer is considered as a fact to threaten current policemen not loyal to the regime of president [[Lukashenka]].

The School of Medicine has launched several research centers and institutes dedicated to specific fields of research:

===The Institute of Human Virology===
The Institute of Human Virology (IHV) was formed in 1996 as a research institute of the University of Maryland School of Medicine, headed and co-founded by [[Robert Gallo]], the only recipient of two [[Lasker Awards]] for the discovery of the first human [[retrovirus]], and the discovery of [[HIV]] as the cause of [[AIDS]].&lt;ref name="NIHLasker"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.nih.gov/research/sources_award_winners.html|title=Lasker NIH Intramural Awardees|accessdate=2014-01-09|publisher=[[National Institutes of Health]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; IHV operates in a dedicated building on the UMSOM campus next to the [[University of Maryland Medical Center]] as a partnership between the State of Maryland, the City of Baltimore, the University System of Maryland and the University of Maryland Medical System.

===The Institute for Genome Sciences===
Launched in 2007, the Institute for Genome Sciences (IGS) is an internationally recognized genomics research center at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.  IGS investigators use genomic and bioinformatic tools to research genome function in health and diseases and work in interdisciplinary collaborations with biomedical investigators. IGS is led by Dr. [[Claire M. Fraser-Liggett]]. Research areas include: Bioinformatics, Cancer Genomics, Functional Genomics, Human Genetic Variation, Infectious Diseases, Organismal Diversity and Evolution, [[Human Microbiome Project]], Plant Genomics, and Microbial Community Ecology. Investigators at IGS work on Disease Ontology research, the Data Analysis and Coordination Center (DACC) for HMP, and other grants. IGS is one of the Genome Sequencing Center for Infectious Diseases (GSCID) centers designated by NIAID.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===The Institute for Global Health===
The [http://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/IGH/ Institute for Global Health] (IGH) was established in 2015 and is dedicated to improving global health by conducting innovative, world-leading research around the world. The IGH develops new and improved ways of diagnosing, preventing, treating, controlling and eradicating diseases of global impact. Such diseases include malaria, Ebola and vaccine-preventable infectious diseases such as measles. The IGH includes the [http://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/cvd/ Center for Vaccine Development] (CVD) and the [http://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/malaria/ Division of Malaria Research].

===Maryland Psychiatric Research Center===
The '''MPRC''' [http://www.mprc.umaryland.edu] was established on the grounds of [[Spring Grove Hospital Center|Spring Grove Hospital]] as a result of public interest in the research pioneered there on the use of the psychedelic compound [[LSD]] in [[Schizophrenia]] research. The first of this series of experiments, which came to be known as the [[Spring Grove Experiment]], began in 1955 in cottage 13 of the hospital grounds. The study was largely conducted by the members of the Research Unit of Spring Grove State Hospital, and became the largest study on psychedelic drugs in psychiatric research.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309477954_Thirty_Years_of_Psychedelic_Research_The_Spring_Grove_Experiment_and_Its_Sequels|title=Thirty Years of Psychedelic Research: The Spring Grove Experiment and Its Sequels (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the study gained media publicity, research funding was made available and Spring Grove was rebuilt into the  MPRC, a division of the department of Psychiatry of the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Currently, MPRC hosts over 20 clinical and basic research faculty that form its core research program into psychiatric disease.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Mprc.umaryland.edu_August_25_2017c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mprc.umaryland.edu/about/Faculty--Staff/ |title=Faculty &amp; Staff |newspaper=Mprc.umaryland.edu |date=  |author= |accessdate= August 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; MPRC is also the editorial seat for the [[Schizophrenia Bulletin]], a [[peer-reviewed]] [[medical journal]] dedicated to schizophrenia research.

'''Ye Zheyun''' is a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] [[businessman]] who was accused of being involved in a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Association football|football]] [[Political corruption|corruption]] and [[Gambling|betting]] [[List of sporting scandals|scandal]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.expatica.com/be/news/Belgian-soccer-match-fixing-scandal-widens_133915.html|title=Belgian soccer match-fixing scandal widens|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was alleged that several teams and/or players received money from Ye to [[Match fixing|influence match results]], so involved gamblers could be certain of a gambling profit.

==Background information==
Teams mentioned in the scandal are [[Lierse S.K.|Lierse]], [[R.A.A. Louviéroise|La Louvière]], [[K. Sint-Truidense V.V.|Sint-Truiden]], [[R.A.E.C. Mons|Mons]], [[K.F.C. Verbroedering Geel|Geel]] and also [[Beerschot AC|Germinal Beerschot]]. Ye always appeared at teams with financial problems, except for Beerschot, who had at that time a crucial match against AEC Mons who were on the verge of relegation. The insinuations about fixed results started after a few matches, on which were heavily betted, with strange events and/or results. Such as e.g. Lierse starting with a reserve team twice unexpectedly. Ye had also been the owner of [[Finland|Finnish]] team [[AC Allianssi]], due to [[bankruptcy]] a now defunct club who also seemed to experience from some strange match events at the end of their existence. Police investigated the case but found insufficient evidence.

==Disappearance==
Ye mostly worked together with Pietro Allatta and [[Olivier Suray]]. Police arrested both, but Allatta and Suray were released after interrogation. On 16 March the Belgian [[Federal Public Service Justice|Justice Department]] ordered an international [[arrest warrant]] against Ye. It is unknown where he currently remains. His [[lawyer]] told [[France|French]] [[sports]] [[newspaper|paper]] ''[[L'Équipe]]'' that Ye denied all accusations and that he was residing somewhere in [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/03/sports/soccer-corruption-without-borders-in-belgian-scandals-china-link.html|title=Soccer: Corruption without borders in Belgian scandal's China link|date=2006-03-03|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-15|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906E2DB1330F935A35751C1A96F9C8B63|title=Police Look at Links to Soccer Betting in Murders in England|last=Werdigier|first=Julia|date=2009-12-06|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-15|last2=Newcastle|first2=ROB HUGHES; Julia Werdigier reported from|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|last3=London|first3=Rob Hughes from|last4=Bochum|last5=Germany.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
