'''144''' ('''one hundred [and] forty-four''') is the [[natural number]] following [[143 (number)|143]] and preceding [[145 (number)|145]]. '''144''' is a dozen [[dozen]]s, or '''one [[gross (unit)|gross]]'''.

==In mathematics==
144 is the twelfth [[Fibonacci number]], and the largest one to also be a [[square number|square]],&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Bunch, ''The Kingdom of Infinite Number''. New York: W. H. Freeman &amp; Company (2000): 165&lt;/ref&gt; as the square of 12 (which is also its index in the Fibonacci sequence), following [[89 (number)|89]] and preceding [[233 (number)|233]].

144 is the smallest number with exactly 15 divisors, but it is not highly composite since a smaller number [[120 (number)|120]] has 16 divisors.

144 is divisible by the value of its [[Euler's totient function|&amp;phi; function]], which returns 48 in this case. Also, there are 21 solutions to the equation φ(''x'') = 144, more than any integer below 144, making it a [[highly totient number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A097942|title=Sloane's A097942 : Highly totient numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

144{{sup|5}} = 27{{sup|5}} + 84{{sup|5}} + 110{{sup|5}} + 133{{sup|5}}, the smallest number whose fifth [[Power (mathematics)|power]] is a sum of four (smaller) fifth powers. This solution was found in 1966 by L. J. Lander and T. R. Parkin, and disproved [[Euler's sum of powers conjecture]].

The [[Hadamard's maximal determinant problem|maximum determinant]] in a 9 by 9 matrix of zeroes and ones is 144.

144 is in base 10 a [[sum-product number]], as well as a [[Harshad number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A005349|title=Sloane's A005349 : Niven (or Harshad) numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 144 is a [[repdigit]] in bases 15, 17, 23, 35, 47, 71, and 143.  144 is the sum of a [[twin prime]] pair (71 + 73)

'''''Abramowitz and Stegun''''' ('''''AS''''') is the informal name of a [[mathematics|mathematical]] reference work edited by [[Milton Abramowitz]] and [[Irene Stegun]] of the United States [[National Bureau of Standards]] (NBS), now the ''National Institute of Standards and Technology'' (NIST). Its full title is '''''Handbook of Mathematical Functions with Formulas, Graphs, and Mathematical Tables'''''.  A digital successor to the Handbook was released as the "[[Digital Library of Mathematical Functions]]" (DLMF) on May 11, 2010, along with a printed version, the ''[[NIST Handbook of Mathematical Functions]]'', published by [[Cambridge University Press]].&lt;ref name="NIST_2010"&gt;{{cite book |title=NIST Handbook of Mathematical Functions |title-link=NIST Handbook of Mathematical Functions |editor1-first=Frank William John |editor1-last=Olver |editor1-link=Frank William John Olver |editor2-first=Daniel W. |editor2-last=Lozier |editor3-first=Ronald F. |editor3-last=Boisvert |editor4-first=Charles W. |editor4-last=Clark |date=2010 |publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST), [[U.S. Department of Commerce]], [[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-521-19225-5 |mr=2723248}} [http://www.cambridge.org/uk/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521140638]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Since it was first published in 1964, the 1046 page ''Handbook'' has been one of the most comprehensive sources of information on [[special function]]s, containing definitions, identities, approximations, plots, and tables of values of numerous functions used in virtually all fields of [[applied mathematics]].&lt;ref name="REV_89_1"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Reviews and Descriptions of Tables and Books 1: Milton Abramowitz &amp; Irene A.

At the time of its publication, the ''Handbook'' was an essential resource for practitioners. Nowadays, [[computer algebra system]]s have replaced the [[mathematical table|function tables]], but the ''Handbook'' remains an important reference source. The foreword discusses a meeting in 1954 in which it was agreed that "the advent of high-speed computing equipment changed the task of table making but definitely did not remove the need for tables".

{{Quotation|More than 1,000 pages long, the ''Handbook of Mathematical Functions'' was first published in 1964 and reprinted many times, with yet another reprint in 1999. Its influence on science and engineering is evidenced by its popularity. In fact, when ''[[New Scientist]]'' magazine recently asked some of the world’s leading scientists what single book they would want if stranded on a desert island, one distinguished British physicist&lt;ref name="Berry_1997"&gt;{{cite journal |author-first=Michael |author-last=Berry |author-link=Michael Berry (physicist) |title=Christmas books: ...

The ''Handbook'' is likely the most widely distributed and most cited NIST technical publication of all time. Government sales exceed 150,000 copies, and an estimated three times as many have been reprinted and sold by commercial publishers since 1965. During the mid-1990s, the book was cited every 1.5 hours of each working day. And its influence will persist as it is currently being updated in digital format by NIST.|[[NIST]]&lt;ref name="NIST_2001"&gt;{{cite web |title=NIST at 100: Foundations for Progress, 1964: Mathematics Handbook Becomes Best Seller |date=2001 |url=https://www.nist.gov/centennial/ph_spaceage.cfm#1964 |access-date=2016-03-13 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313160527/https://www.nist.gov/centennial/ph_spaceage.cfm#1964 |archive-date=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Editions==
Because the ''Handbook'' is the work of [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] employees acting in their official capacity, it is [[Copyright status of work by the U.S. government|not protected by copyright]] in the United States. While it could be ordered from the [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]], it has also been reprinted by commercial publishers, most notably [[Dover Publications]] ({{ISBN|0-486-61272-4}}), and can be legally viewed on and downloaded from the web.

While there was only one edition of the work, it went through many [[print run]]s including a growing number of corrections.

As a side-note, the Dover paperback edition (SBN 468-61272-4) cover names the second editor "Irene A. Segun" instead of Stegun.  This error is sometimes used to illustrate the human trait of looking in every place except the most obvious one.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10289">In [[computer science]], an '''abstract state machine''' ('''ASM''') is a [[state machine]] operating on [[state (computer science)|states]] that are arbitrary data structures ([[mathematical structure|structure]] in the sense of [[mathematical logic]], that is a nonempty [[Set (mathematics)|set]] together with a number of [[function (mathematics)|functions]] ([[operation (mathematics)|operations]]) and [[relation (mathematics)|relations]] over the set).

The '''ASM Method''' is a practical and scientifically well-founded [[systems engineering]] method that bridges the gap between the two ends of system development:
* the human understanding and formulation of real-world problems ([[requirements analysis|requirements capture]] by accurate high-level modeling at the level of abstraction determined by the given application domain)
* the deployment of their algorithmic solutions by code-executing machines on changing platforms (definition of design decisions, system and implementation details).

The method builds upon three basic concepts: 
* ''ASM'': a precise form of pseudo-code, generalizing [[Finite State Machines]] to operate over arbitrary data structures
* ''ground model'': a rigorous form of blueprints, serving as authoritative reference model for the design
* ''refinement'': a most general scheme for stepwise instantiations of model abstractions to concrete system elements, providing controllable links between the more and more detailed descriptions at the successive stages of system development.

In the original conception of ASMs, a single [[software agent|agent]] executes a program in a sequence of steps, possibly interacting with its environment. This notion was extended to capture [[distributed computing|distributed computations]], in which multiple agents execute their programs concurrently.

Since ASMs model algorithms at arbitrary levels of abstraction, they can provide high-level, low-level and mid-level views of a hardware or software design. ASM specifications often consist of a series of ASM models, starting with an abstract ''ground model'' and proceeding to greater levels of detail in successive [[Program refinement|refinements]] or coarsenings.

Due to the algorithmic and mathematical nature of these three concepts, ASM models and their properties of interest can be analyzed using any rigorous form of [[Verification and Validation (software)|verification]] (by reasoning) or [[Verification and Validation (software)|validation]] (by experimentation, testing model executions).

==History==
The concept of ASMs is due to [[Yuri Gurevich]], who first proposed it in the mid-1980s as a way of improving on [[Church–Turing thesis|Turing's thesis]] that every [[algorithm]] is [[Simulation#Computer science|simulated]] by an appropriate [[Turing machine]]. He formulated the ''ASM Thesis'': every algorithm, no matter how [[abstraction|abstract]], is step-for-step [[emulated]] by an appropriate ASM. In 2000, Gurevich [[axiomatic system|axiomatized]] the notion of sequential algorithms, and proved the ASM thesis for them. Roughly stated, the axioms are as follows: states are structures, the [[state transition]] involves only a bounded part of the state, and everything is [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under [[isomorphisms]] of structures. (Structures can be viewed as [[universal algebra|algebras]], which explains the original name ''evolving algebras'' for ASMs.) The axiomatization and characterization of sequential algorithms have been extended to [[parallel computing|parallel]] and interactive algorithms.

In the 1990s, by a community effort, the ASM method was developed, using ASMs for the [[formal specification]] and analysis ([[Verification and Validation (software)|verification and validation]]) of [[computer hardware]] and [[software]]. Comprehensive ASM specifications of [[programming languages]] (including [[Prolog]], [[C (programming language)|C]], and [[Java (programming language)|Java]]) and [[design language]]s ([[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] and [[Specification and Description Language|SDL]]) have been developed. 
A detailed historical account can be found in the [http://www.di.unipi.it/~boerger/AsmBook/ AsmBook] (Chapter 9) or in
[http://www.jucs.org/jucs_8_1/the_origins_and_the this article].

A number of software tools for ASM execution and analysis are available.

[[Image:Apollonian circles.svg|thumb|right|350px|Some Apollonian circles. Every blue circle intersects every red circle at a right angle. Every red circle passes through the two points, ''C'' and ''D'', and every blue circle separates the two points.]]

'''Apollonian circles''' are two families of [[circle]]s such that every circle in the first family intersects every circle in the second family [[orthogonal]]ly, and vice versa. These circles form the basis for [[bipolar coordinates]]. They were discovered by [[Apollonius of Perga]], a renowned [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[geometer]].

==Definition==
The Apollonian circles are defined in two different ways by a [[line segment]] denoted ''CD''.

Each circle in the first family (the blue circles in the figure) is associated with a positive [[real number]] ''r'', and is defined as the locus of points ''X'' such that the ratio of distances from ''X'' to ''C'' and to ''D'' equals ''r'',
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{X\mid \frac{d(X,C)}{d(X,D)} = r\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;
For values of ''r'' close to zero, the corresponding circle is close to ''C'', while for values of ''r'' close to ∞, the corresponding circle is close to ''D''; for the intermediate value ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, the circle degenerates to a line, the perpendicular bisector of ''CD''. The equation defining these circles as a locus can be generalized to define the [[Fermat–Apollonius circle]]s of larger sets of weighted points.

Each circle in the second family (the red circles in the figure) is associated with an angle ''θ'', and is defined as the locus of points ''X'' such that the [[inscribed angle]] CXD equals ''θ'',
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{X\mid  \; C\hat{X}D \; = \theta\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Scanning ''θ'' from 0 to ''π'' generates the set of all circles passing through the two points ''C'' and ''D''.

The two points where all the red circles cross are the [[limiting point (geometry)|limiting points]] of pairs of circles in the blue family.

==Bipolar coordinates==

A given blue circle and a given red circle intersect in two points. In order to obtain bipolar '''coordinates''', a method is required to specify which point is the right one. An isoptic arc is the locus of points ''X''  that sees points ''C'' and ''D'' under a given oriented angle of vectors i.e. 
:&lt;math&gt;isopt(\theta)=\{X\mid \angle( \overrightarrow{XC}, \overrightarrow{XD} )=\theta +2k\pi\}.&lt;/math&gt;
Such an arc is contained into a red circle and is bounded by points ''C'' and ''D''. The remaining part of the corresponding red circle is &lt;math&gt;isopt(\theta+\pi)&lt;/math&gt;. When we really want the whole red circle, a description using oriented angles of straight lines has to be used
:&lt;math&gt; {\rm full\;red\;circle}=\{X\mid \angle( \overrightarrow{XC}, \overrightarrow{XD} )=\theta +k\pi\}&lt;/math&gt;

==Pencils of circles==
{{split section|Pencil of circles|Talk:Apollonian circles#Split|date=August 2015}}

Both of the families of Apollonian circles are called '''pencils of circles'''. More generally, there is a natural correspondence between circles in the plane and points in three-dimensional [[projective space]]; a line in this space corresponds to a one-dimensional continuous family of circles called a pencil.

Specifically, the equation of a circle of radius ''r'' centered at a point (''p'',''q''),
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle (x-p)^2 + (y-q)^2 = r^2,&lt;/math&gt;
may be rewritten as
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \alpha(x^2 + y^2) - 2\beta x - 2\gamma y + \delta = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
where α&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, β&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''p'', γ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''q'', and δ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. 
In this form, multiplying the quadruple (α,β,γ,δ) by a [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] produces a different quadruple that represents the same circle; thus, these quadruples may be considered to be [[homogeneous coordinates]] for the space of circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Pfeifer|Van Hook|1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Straight lines may also be represented with an equation of this type in which α&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and should be thought of as being a degenerate form of a circle. When α&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0, we may solve for ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;β/α, ''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;γ/α, and ''r''&amp;nbsp;=√((&amp;minus;δ&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;β&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;γ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)/α&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;); note, however, that the latter formula may give ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 (in which case the circle degenerates to a point) or ''r'' equal to an [[imaginary number]] (in which case the quadruple (α,β,γ,δ) is said to represent an ''imaginary circle'').

The set of [[affine combination]]s of two circles (α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,β&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,δ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), (α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,δ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), that is, the set of circles represented by the quadruple
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle z(\alpha_1,\beta_1,\gamma_1,\delta_1)+(1-z)(\alpha_2,\beta_2,\gamma_2,\delta_2)&lt;/math&gt;
for some value of the parameter ''z'',
forms a pencil; the two circles are called ''generators'' of the pencil. There are three types of pencil:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Schwerdtfeger|1979|pp=8–10}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*An ''elliptic pencil'' (red family of circles in the figure) is defined by two generators that pass through each other in exactly '''two''' points (''C'' and ''D'').  At these points, the defining formula has zero value, and therefore will also equal zero for any affine combination. Thus, every circle of an elliptic pencil passes through the same two points. An elliptic pencil does not include any imaginary circles.
*A ''hyperbolic pencil'' (blue family of circles in the figure) is defined by two generators that do not intersect each other at '''any''' point. It includes real circles, imaginary circles, and two degenerate point circles (here ''C'' and ''D'') called the ''Poncelet points'' of the pencil. Each point in the plane belongs to exactly one circle of the pencil.  forms a pencil of this type.
*Finally, a ''parabolic pencil'' (as a limiting case) is defined where two generating circles are tangent to each other at a '''single''' point . It consists of a family of real circles, all tangent to each other at a single common point. The degenerate circle with radius zero at that point also belongs to the pencil.

A family of concentric circles centered at a single focus ''C'' forms a special case of a hyperbolic pencil, in which the other focus is the point at infinity of the [[complex projective line]]. The corresponding elliptic pencil consists of the family of straight lines through ''C''; these should be interpreted as circles that all pass through the point at infinity.

==Radical axis and central line==

Except for the two special cases of a pencil of concentric circles and a pencil of coincident lines,
any two circles within a pencil have the same [[radical axis]], and all circles in the pencil have collinear centers. Any three or more circles from the same family are called '''coaxal circles''' or '''coaxial circles'''.&lt;ref&gt;MathWorld uses “coaxal,” while {{harvtxt|Akopyan|Zaslavsky|2007}} prefer “coaxial.”&lt;/ref&gt;

The elliptic pencil of circles passing through the two points ''C'' and ''D'' (the set of red circles, in the figure) has the line ''CD'' as its radical axis. The centers of the circles in this pencil lie on the perpendicular bisector of ''CD''.
The hyperbolic pencil defined by points ''C'' and ''D'' (the blue circles) has its radical axis on the perpendicular bisector of line ''CD'', and all its circle centers on line ''CD''.

The radical axis of any pencil of circles, interpreted as an infinite-radius circle, belongs to the pencil.
Any three circles belong to a common pencil whenever all three pairs share the same radical axis and their centers are collinear.

==Inversive geometry, orthogonal intersection, and coordinate systems==
[[Circle inversion]] transforms the plane in a way that maps circles into circles, and pencils of circles into pencils of circles. The type of the pencil is preserved: the inversion of an elliptic pencil is another elliptic pencil, the inversion of a hyperbolic pencil is another hyperbolic pencil, and the inversion of a parabolic pencil is another parabolic pencil.

It is relatively easy to show using inversion that, in the Apollonian circles, every blue circle intersects every red circle orthogonally, i.e., at a [[right angle]].  Inversion of the blue Apollonian circles with respect to a circle centered on point ''C'' results in a pencil of concentric circles centered at the image of point ''D''.  The same inversion transforms the red circles into a set of straight lines that all contain the image of ''D''.  Thus, this inversion transforms the [[bipolar coordinates|bipolar coordinate system]] defined by the Apollonian circles into a [[polar coordinates|polar coordinate system]].
Obviously, the transformed pencils meet at right angles. Since inversion is a [[conformal map|conformal transformation]], it preserves the angles between the curves it transforms, so the original Apollonian circles also meet at right angles.

Alternatively,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Akopyan|Zaslavsky|2007}}, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; the orthogonal property of the two pencils follows from the defining property of the radical axis, that from any point ''X'' on the radical axis of a pencil ''P'' the lengths of the tangents from ''X'' to each circle in ''P'' are all equal. It follows from this that the circle centered at ''X'' with length equal to these tangents crosses all circles of ''P'' perpendicularly. The same construction can be applied for each ''X'' on the radical axis of ''P'', forming another pencil of circles perpendicular to ''P''.

More generally, for every pencil of circles there exists a unique pencil consisting of the circles that are perpendicular to the first pencil. If one pencil is elliptic, its perpendicular pencil is hyperbolic, and vice versa; in this case the two pencils form a set of Apollonian circles. The pencil of circles perpendicular to a parabolic pencil is also parabolic; it consists of the circles that have the same common tangent point but with a perpendicular tangent line at that point.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Schwerdtfeger|1979|pp=30–31, Theorem A}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4973">'''Arithmetic topology''' is an area of [[mathematics]] that is a combination of [[algebraic number theory]] and [[topology]]. It establishes an analogy between [[number field]]s and closed, orientable [[3-manifold]]s.

==Analogies==
The following are some of the analogies used by mathematicians between number fields and 3-manifolds:&lt;ref&gt;Sikora, Adam S. "Analogies between group actions on 3-manifolds and number fields." Commentarii Mathematici Helvetici 78.4 (2003): 832-844.&lt;/ref&gt;
#A number field corresponds to a closed, orientable 3-manifold
#[[Ideal (ring theory)|Ideals]] in the ring of integers correspond to [[link (knot theory)|links]], and [[prime ideal]]s correspond to knots.
#The field '''Q''' of [[rational number]]s corresponds to the [[3-sphere]].

Expanding on the last two examples,  there is an analogy between [[knot (mathematics)|knots]] and [[prime number]]s in which one considers "links" between primes. The triple of primes {{nowrap|(13, 61, 937)}} are "linked" modulo 2 (the [[Rédei symbol]] is −1) but are "pairwise unlinked" modulo 2 (the [[Legendre symbol]]s are all 1). Therefore these primes have been called a "proper Borromean triple modulo 2"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Vogel |first=Denis |date=13 February 2004 |title=Massey products in the Galois cohomology of number fields |url=http://www.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/archiv/4418 |id={{URN|nbn|de:bsz:16-opus-44188}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "mod 2 Borromean primes".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Morishita |first=Masanori |date=22 April 2009 |title=Analogies between Knots and Primes, 3-Manifolds and Number Rings |arxiv=0904.3399|bibcode=2009arXiv0904.3399M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the 1960s topological interpretations of [[class field theory]] were given by [[John Tate]]&lt;ref&gt;J. Tate,  Duality theorems in Galois cohomology over number fields, (Proc. Intern. Cong. Stockholm, 1962, p. 288-295).&lt;/ref&gt; based on [[Galois cohomology]], and also by [[Michael Artin]] and [[Jean-Louis Verdier]]&lt;ref&gt;M. Artin and J.-L.

Then [[David Mumford]] (and independently [[Yuri Manin]]) came up with an analogy between [[prime ideals]] and [[Knot (mathematics)|knots]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neverendingbooks.org/who-dreamed-up-the-primesknots-analogy Who dreamed up the primes=knots analogy?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718061649/http://www.neverendingbooks.org/index.php/who-dreamed-up-the-primesknots-analogy.html |date=July 18, 2011 }}, neverendingbooks, lieven le bruyn's blog, may 16, 2011,&lt;/ref&gt; which was further explored by [[Barry Mazur]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.harvard.edu/~mazur/papers/alexander_polynomial.pdf Remarks on the Alexander Polynomial], Barry Mazur, c.1964&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B.

His name is attached to the [[Herz–Schur multiplier]].

==Education and career==
Herz received his bachelor's degree from [[Cornell University]] in 1950 and then became a mathematics graduate student at [[Princeton University]]. There he received a Ph.D. under the supervision of [[Salomon Bochner]] in 1953 with the dissertation "Bessel Functions of Matrix Argument".&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=8117|name=Carl Herz}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Tom H. Koornwinder]], Herz's dissertation (published in the [[Annals of Mathematics]] in May 1955) "was a pioneering paper in the field of [[special function]]s in several variables associated with [[Lie group]]s and with [[root system]]s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Koornwinder, T. H.|title=Death of Carl Herz|website=OP–SF WEB|date=12 September 1996|url=http://math.nist.gov/opsf/personal/herz.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herz returned to Cornell, where he became in 1953 an instructor, in 1955 an assistant professor, in 1958 an associate professor, and in 1963 a full professor and remained at Cornell until 1969. He worked for the academic year 1969–1970 at [[Brandeis University]] and then became in 1970 a professor at [[McGill University]], where he remained until his death in 1995. For the academic year 1962–1963 Herz was a Sloan Fellow at [[University of Paris-Sud|Université de Paris-Sud]] at [[Orsay]]; in subsequent years he was a frequent academic visitor at Orsay for a month or two each year. In the academic years 1957-1958 and 1976–1977 he was a visiting scholar at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. Herz did mathematical research on spectral synthesis, [[positive definite function]]s, [[Fourier transform]]s on [[convex set]]s, [[potential theory]], H&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, and [[Bounded mean oscillation|BMO]]. According to [[Nicholas Varopoulos]], Herz made contributions "to the theory of symmetric spaces, Lie groups and the [[heat kernel]] on these; among other things he succeeded in classifying all faithful representations of Lie groups by [[contact transformation]]s of a [[compact manifold]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Carl Herz 1930--1995|journal=Notices of the AMS|date=July 1996|volume=43|issue=7|pages=768–771|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/199607/comm-herz.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978 he was elected of a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. In 1986 he was awarded the [[Jeffery–Williams Prize]] by the [[Canadian Mathematical Society]]. The Institut des sciences mathématiques (a consortium of eight [[Quebec]] universities) established a prize in honour of Carl Herz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.uqam.ca/ism/index_en.html?fondation/bourseherz_en.html The Carl Herz Prize, Institut des sciences mathématiques.]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227211154/http://www.math.uqam.ca/ism/index_en.html?fondation%2Fbourseherz_en.html |date=February 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the president of the [[Canadian Mathematical Society]] in 1987–1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.uqam.ca/ism/index_en.html?fondation/carlherz_en.html Carl Herz, ISM]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227211454/http://www.math.uqam.ca/ism/index_en.html?fondation%2Fcarlherz_en.html |date=February 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chaffing and winnowing''' is a [[cryptography|cryptographic]] technique to achieve [[confidentiality]] without using [[encryption]] when sending data over an [[insecure channel]]. The name is derived from agriculture: after grain has been harvested and [[threshing|threshed]], it remains mixed together with inedible fibrous [[chaff]].  The chaff and grain are then separated by [[winnowing]], and the chaff is discarded. The cryptographic technique was conceived by [[Ron Rivest]] and published in an on-line article on 18 March 1998.&lt;ref name="ron"&gt;[http://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/chaffing-980701.txt Rivest's article on chaffing and winnowing]&lt;/ref&gt; Although it bears similarities to both traditional encryption and [[steganography]], it cannot be classified under either category.

This technique allows the sender to deny responsibility for encrypting their message. When using chaffing and winnowing, the sender transmits the message unencrypted, in clear text. Although the sender and the receiver share a secret key, they use it only for [[authentication]]. However, a third party can make their communication confidential by simultaneously sending specially crafted messages through the same channel.

|}

The sender ([[Alice and Bob|Alice]]) wants to send a message to the receiver ([[Alice and Bob|Bob]]). In the simplest setup, Alice enumerates the symbols (usually [[bit]]s) in her message and sends out each in a separate [[Packet (information technology)|packet]]. In general the method requires each symbol to arrive in-order and to be authenticated by the receiver. When implemented over networks that may change the order of packets, the sender places the symbol's serial number in the packet, the symbol itself (both unencrypted), and a [[message authentication code]] (MAC). Many MACs use a [[secret key]] Alice shares with Bob, but it is sufficient that the receiver has a method to authenticate the packets. [[Alice and Bob|Charles]], who transmits Alice's packets to Bob, interleaves the packets with corresponding bogus packets (called "chaff") with corresponding serial numbers, arbitrary symbols, and a random number in place of the MAC. Charles does not need to know the key to do that (real MAC are large enough that it is extremely unlikely to generate a valid one by chance, unlike in the example). Bob uses the MAC to find the authentic messages and drops the "chaff" messages. This process is called "winnowing".

An eavesdropper located between Alice and Charles can easily read Alice's message. But an eavesdropper between Charles and Bob would have to tell which packets are bogus and which are real (i.e. to winnow, or "separate the wheat from the chaff"). That is infeasible if the MAC used is secure and Charles does not leak any information on packet authenticity (e.g. via timing).

If a fourth party, Dave, (anyone other than Alice, Charles, or Bob) requires Alice to disclose her secret key, she can defend with the argument that she used the key merely for authentication and did not intend to make the message confidential. If Dave cannot force Alice to disclose an authentication key (the knowledge of which would enable him to forge messages from Alice), then her messages will remain confidential. On the other hand, Charles does not even possess any secret keys that he could be ordered to disclose.

== Variations ==

The simple variant of the chaffing and winnowing technique described above adds many bits of overhead per bit of original message. To make the transmission more efficient, Alice can process her message with an [[all-or-nothing transform]] and then send it out in much larger chunks. The chaff packets will have to be modified accordingly. Because the original message can be reconstructed only by knowing all of its chunks, Charles needs to send only enough chaff packets to make finding the correct combination of packets computationally infeasible.

Chaffing and winnowing lends itself especially well to use in [[packet-switched network]] environments such as the [[Internet]], where each message (whose payload is typically small) is sent in a separate network packet. In another variant of the technique, Charles carefully interleaves packets coming from multiple senders. That eliminates the need for Charles to generate and inject bogus packets in the communication. However, the text of Alice's message cannot be well protected from other parties who are communicating via Charles at the same time. This variant also helps protect against [[information leakage]] and [[traffic analysis]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

==Implications for law enforcement==
Ron Rivest suggests that laws related to cryptography, including export controls, would not apply to ''chaffing and winnowing'' because it does not employ any encryption at all.&lt;ref name="ron"/&gt;

{{Quote|The power to authenticate is in many cases the power to control, and handing all authentication power to the government is beyond all reason|Ronald L. Rivest, 1998&lt;ref name="ron"/&gt;}}

The author of the paper proposes that the security implications of handing everyone's authentication keys to the government for law-enforcement purposes would be far too risky, since possession of the key would enable someone to masquerade and communicate as another entity, such as an airline controller.  Furthermore, Ron Rivest contemplates the possibility of rogue law enforcement officials framing up innocent parties by introducing the chaff into their communications, concluding that drafting a law restricting ''chaffing and winnowing'' would be far too difficult.&lt;ref name="ron"/&gt;

==Trivia==
The term ''winnowing'' was suggested by Ronald Rivest's father.  Before the publication of Rivest's paper in 1998 other people brought to his attention a 1965 novel,  [[Rex Stout]]'s ''[[The Doorbell Rang]]'', which describes the same concept and was thus included in the paper's references.&lt;ref name="ron"/&gt;

'''90''', 027002 (2003), {{doi|10.1103/PhysRevLett.90.027002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[superconducting quantum computing]], a charge qubit is formed by a tiny [[superconductor|superconducting]] island (also known as a Cooper-pair box) coupled by a [[Josephson junction]] to a superconducting reservoir (see figure).  The state of the qubit is determined by the number of Cooper pairs which have tunneled across the junction. In contrast with the charge state of an atomic or molecular ion, the charge states of such an "island" involve a macroscopic number of conduction electrons of the island. The quantum superposition of charge states can be achieved by tuning the gate voltage U that controls the chemical potential of the island. The charge qubit is typically read-out by electrostatically coupling the island to an extremely sensitive [[electrometer]] such as the [[radio-frequency]] [[single-electron transistor]].

Typical [[Spin-spin_relaxation|T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; coherence times]] for a charge qubit are on the order of 1–2 μs.&lt;ref name=Houck&gt;A.A.

== Benefits ==
To-date, the realizations of qubits that have had the most success are [[ion trap]]s and [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]], with [[Shor's algorithm]] even being implemented using NMR.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bristol.ac.uk/physics/media/theory-theses/rodrigues-da-thesis.pdf Superconducting Charge Qubits], by Denzil Anthony Rodrigues, page 3&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is hard to see these two methods being scaled to the hundreds, thousands, or millions of qubits necessary to create a [[Quantum computing|quantum computer]]. [[Solid-state physics|Solid-state]] representations of qubits are much more easily scalable, but they themselves have their own problem: [[Quantum decoherence|decoherence]]. Superconductors, however, have the advantage of being more easily scaled, and they are more coherent than normal solid-state systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bristol.ac.uk/physics/media/theory-theses/rodrigues-da-thesis.pdf Superconducting Charge Qubits] by Denzil Anthony Rodrigues, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

== Experimental Progress ==
Superconducting charge qubits have been progressing quickly. They were first suggested in 1997 by Shnirman,&lt;ref&gt;A. Shnirman, G. Sch¨on, and Z. Herman, Phys. Rev. Lett. 79, 2371 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; and by 2001 coherent oscillations were observed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5386">In [[mathematics]], the '''complex conjugate''' of a [[complex numbers|complex]] [[vector space]] &lt;math&gt;V\,&lt;/math&gt; is a complex vector space &lt;math&gt;\overline V&lt;/math&gt;, which has the same elements and additive group structure as &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, but whose [[scalar multiplication]] involves conjugation of the scalars. In other words, the scalar multiplication of &lt;math&gt;\overline V&lt;/math&gt; satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha\,*\, v = {\,\overline \alpha \cdot \,v\,}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; is the scalar multiplication of &lt;math&gt;\overline V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; is the scalar multiplication of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.
The letter &lt;math&gt;v\,&lt;/math&gt; stands for a vector in &lt;math&gt;V\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\alpha\,&lt;/math&gt; is a complex number, and &lt;math&gt;\overline\alpha&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[complex conjugate]] of &lt;math&gt;\alpha\,&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Schmüdgen2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=K. Schmüdgen|title=Unbounded Operator Algebras and Representation Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fx3yBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16|date=11 November 2013|publisher=Birkhäuser|isbn=978-3-0348-7469-4|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More concretely, the complex conjugate vector space is the same underlying ''real'' vector space (same set of points, same vector addition and real scalar multiplication) with the conjugate [[linear complex structure]] ''J'' (different multiplication by ''i'').

==Motivation==
If &lt;math&gt;V\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;W\,&lt;/math&gt; are complex vector spaces, a function &lt;math&gt;f\colon V \to W\,&lt;/math&gt; is [[Antilinear map|antilinear]] if
:&lt;math&gt;f(v+v') = f(v) + f(v')\quad\text{and}\quad f(\alpha v) = \overline\alpha \, f(v)&lt;/math&gt;
With the use of the conjugate vector space &lt;math&gt;\overline V&lt;/math&gt;, an antilinear map &lt;math&gt;f : V \to W&lt;/math&gt; can be regarded as an ordinary [[linear map]] of type &lt;math&gt;\overline V \to W&lt;/math&gt;. The linearity is checked by noting:
:&lt;math&gt; f(\alpha * v) = f(\overline \alpha \cdot v) =  \overline{\overline{\alpha}} \cdot f(v) =\alpha \cdot f(v)&lt;/math&gt;
Conversely, any linear map defined on &lt;math&gt;\overline V&lt;/math&gt; gives rise to an antilinear map on &lt;math&gt;V\,&lt;/math&gt;.

This is the same underlying principle as in defining [[opposite ring]] so that a right &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-[[right module|module]] can be regarded as a left &lt;math&gt;R^{op}&lt;/math&gt;-module, or that of an [[opposite category]] so that a [[contravariant functor]] &lt;math&gt;C \to D&lt;/math&gt;  can be regarded as an ordinary functor of type &lt;math&gt;C^{op} \to D&lt;/math&gt;.

==Complex conjugation functor==
A linear map &lt;math&gt;f \colon V \to W\,&lt;/math&gt; gives rise to a corresponding  linear map &lt;math&gt;\overline f \colon \overline V \to \overline W&lt;/math&gt; which has the same action as &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. Note that &lt;math&gt;\overline f&lt;/math&gt; preserves scalar multiplication because
:&lt;math&gt;\overline f (\alpha * v) = f(\overline \alpha \cdot v) = \overline \alpha \cdot f(v) = \alpha * \overline f(v)&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, complex conjugation &lt;math&gt;V\mapsto \overline V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f\mapsto\overline f&lt;/math&gt; define a [[functor]] from the [[category theory|category]] of complex vector spaces to itself.

If &lt;math&gt;V\,&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;W\,&lt;/math&gt; are finite-dimensional and the map  &lt;math&gt;f\,&lt;/math&gt; is described by the complex [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]  &lt;math&gt;A\,&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the [[basis of a vector space|bases]]  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt; of  &lt;math&gt;V\,&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal C&lt;/math&gt; of  &lt;math&gt;W\,&lt;/math&gt;, then the map  &lt;math&gt;\overline f&lt;/math&gt; is described by the complex conjugate of  &lt;math&gt;A\,&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the bases  &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathcal B}&lt;/math&gt; of  &lt;math&gt;\overline V&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathcal C}&lt;/math&gt; of  &lt;math&gt;\overline W&lt;/math&gt;.

==Structure of the conjugate==
The vector spaces &lt;math&gt;V\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline V&lt;/math&gt; have the same [[dimension of a vector space|dimension]] over the complex numbers and are therefore [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] as complex vector spaces. However, there is no [[natural isomorphism]] from  &lt;math&gt;V\,&lt;/math&gt; to  &lt;math&gt;\overline V&lt;/math&gt;.

The double conjugate &lt;math&gt;\overline{\overline V}&lt;/math&gt; is identical to &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.

== Complex conjugate of a Hilbert space ==
Given a [[Hilbert space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; (either finite or infinite dimensional), its complex conjugate &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathcal{H}}&lt;/math&gt; is the same vector space as its [[continuous dual space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}'&lt;/math&gt;.
There is one-to-one antilinear correspondence between continuous linear functionals and vectors.
In other words, any continuous [[linear functional]] on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; is an inner multiplication to some fixed vector, and vice versa.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Thus, the complex conjugate to a vector &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, particularly in finite dimension case, may be denoted as &lt;math&gt;v^*&lt;/math&gt; (v-star, a [[row vector]] which is the [[conjugate transpose]] to a column vector &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;).
In quantum mechanics, the conjugate to a ''ket&amp;nbsp;vector''&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is denoted as &lt;math&gt;\langle\psi|&lt;/math&gt; – a ''bra vector'' (see [[bra–ket notation]]).

A '''component''' in the [[Unified Modeling Language]] "represents a [[modular]] part of a [[system]], that encapsulates its content and whose manifestation is replaceable within its [[built environment|environment]]. A component defines its [[behavior]] in terms of ''provided'' and ''required'' [[Interface (computer science)|interfaces]]".&lt;ref name= "OMG UML V2.1.2"&gt;OMG (2008). ''[http://www.omg.org/spec/UML/2.1.2/Superstructure/PDF OMG Unified Modeling Language (OMG UML), Superstructure, V2.1.2]'' p.146.&lt;/ref&gt;

A component may be replaced by another if and only if their provided and required interfaces are identical. This idea is the underpinning for the [[plug-and-play]] capability of [[component-based]] systems and promotes [[software reuse]].&lt;ref name= "OMG UML V2.1.2"/&gt;

As can be seen from the above definition, UML places no restriction on the granularity of a component. Thus, a component may be as small as a ''figures-to-words converter'', or as large as an entire ''[[document management system]]''.

Larger pieces of a [[system]]'s functionality may be assembled by reusing components as parts in an encompassing component or assembly of components, and wiring together their required and provided interfaces."&lt;ref name= "OMG UML V2.1.2"/&gt; Such assemblies are illustrated by means of [[component diagram]]s.

'''Cosmic time''' (also known as '''time since the big bang''') is the [[time]] [[coordinate]] commonly used in the [[Big Bang]] models of [[physical cosmology]].  It is defined for [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]], [[Cosmic expansion|expanding]] universes as follows:  Choose a time coordinate so that the universe has the same [[density]] everywhere at each moment in time (the fact that this is possible means that the universe is, by definition, homogeneous).  Measure the passage of time using [[Clock|clocks]] moving with the [[Hubble flow]].  Choose the big bang singularity as the origin of the time coordinate. 

Cosmic time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Cosmology|last=Dodelson|first=Scott|publisher=Academic Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-12-219141-1|location=|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Cosmology|last=Bonometto|first=Silvio|publisher=Institute of Physics Publishing|year=2002|isbn=0750308109|location=Bristol and Philadelphia|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a measure of time by a physical clock with zero [[Peculiar velocity#Cosmology|peculiar velocity]] in the absence of matter over-/under-densities (to prevent time dilation due to relativistic effects or confusions caused by expansion of the universe). Unlike other measures of time such as temperature, redshift, particle horizon, or Hubble horizon, the cosmic time (similar and complementary to the comoving coordinates) is blind to the expansion of the universe. 

There are two main ways for establishing a reference point for the cosmic time. The most trivial way is to take the present time as the cosmic reference point (sometimes referred to as the lookback time) or alternatively, take the [[Big Bang]] as &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; (also referred to as age of the universe). The big bang doesn't necessarily have to correspond to a physical event but rather it refers to the point at which the scale factor would vanish for a standard cosmological model such as ΛCDM. For instance, in the case of inflation, i.e. a non-standard cosmology, the hypothetical moment of big bang is still determined using the benchmark cosmological models which may coincide with the end of the inflationary epoch. For inflationary models, it is not possible to establish a well defined origin of time before the big bang since the universe does not require a beginning event in such models. For technical purposes, concepts such as the average temperature of the universe (in units of eV) or the particle horizon are used when the early universe is the objective of a study since understanding the interaction among particles is more relevant than their time coordinate or age. 

Cosmic time is the standard time coordinate for specifying the [[Friedmann&amp;ndash;Lemaître&amp;ndash;Robertson&amp;ndash;Walker metric|Friedmann&amp;ndash;Lemaître&amp;ndash;Robertson&amp;ndash;Walker solutions]] of [[Einstein's equations]].

'''''De divina proportione''''' (''On the Divine Proportion'') is a book on [[mathematics]] written by [[Luca Pacioli]] and illustrated by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], composed around 1498 in [[Milan]] and first printed in 1509.&lt;ref name="StAnd"/&gt; Its subject was mathematical proportions (the title refers to the [[golden ratio]]) and their applications to geometry, visual art through [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], and architecture. The clarity of the written material and Leonardo's excellent diagrams helped the book to achieve an impact beyond mathematical circles, popularizing contemporary geometric concepts and images.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/pacioli.html|title=Luca Pacioli's Polyhedra|first=George W.|last=Hart|website=Virtual Polyhedra|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Y&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.math.ubc.ca/~hoek/Teaching/Golden/Divina.html|publisher = [[University of British Columbia]]|title = The Rose and the Nautilus|last = Hoechsmann|first = Klaus Hoechsmann|date = 1 April 2001|accessdate = 15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents of the book==
{{further information|Mathematics and art}}

[[File:Divina proportione.png|thumb|250px| Woodcut illustrating proportions of the human face. Note that despite the label in the image, the lines drawn relate to Vitruvius' system of integers and do not correspond in any way to the golden ratio.]]
The book consists of three separate manuscripts,&lt;ref name="StAnd"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Pacioli.html|title = Luca Pacioli|website = School of Mathematics and Statistics|publisher = [[University of St Andrews]]|last = O'Connor|first = J J|last2 = Robertson|first2 = E F|date = July 1999|accessdate = 15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Pacioli worked on between 1496 and 1498.

===''Compendio divina proportione''===
The first part, ''Compendio divina proportione'' (''Compendium on the Divine Proportion''), studies the [[golden ratio]] from a mathematical perspective (following the relevant work of [[Euclid]]) and explores its applications to various arts, in seventy-one chapters.&lt;ref name="StAnd"/&gt; It also contains a discourse on the [[Regular polyhedra|regular]] and [[semiregular polyhedra]],&lt;ref name=E/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=J F|last=Field|title=Rediscovering the Archimedean polyhedra: Piero della Francesca, Luca Pacioli, Leonardo da Vinci, Albrecht Dürer, Daniele Barbaro, and Johannes Kepler|journal=Arch. Hist. Exact Sci.|volume=50|number=3-4|year=1997|pages=241–289}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a discussion of the use of [[geometric perspective]] by painters such as [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Melozzo da Forlì]] and [[Marco Palmezzano]].

===''Trattato dell'architettura''===
The second part, ''Trattato dell'architettura'' (''Treatise on Architecture''), discusses the ideas of [[Vitruvius]] (from his ''[[De architectura]]'') on the application of [[mathematics and architecture|mathematics to architecture]] in twenty chapters. The text compares the proportions of the human body to those of artificial structures, with examples from classical [[Greco-Roman world#Architecture|Greco-Roman architecture]].

===''Libellus in tres partiales divisus''===
The third part, ''Libellus in tres partiales divisus'' (''Book divided into three parts''), is mainly an Italian translation of [[Piero della Francesca]]'s Latin writings ''On [the] Five Regular Solids'' ("''De quinque corporibus regularibus''")&lt;ref name="StAnd"/&gt; and mathematical examples.&lt;ref name=E&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ww3.ac-poitiers.fr/arts_p/b@lise14/pageshtm/page_4.htm |title=La Divine Proportion de Luca Pacioli |language=French |publisher=Académie de Poitiers |last=Gardes |first=Michel |date=20 June 2001 |accessdate=15 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150127090823/http://ww3.ac-poitiers.fr/arts_p/b%40lise14/pageshtm/page_4.htm |archivedate=27 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1550 [[Giorgio Vasari]] wrote a biography of della Francesca, in which he accused Pacioli of plagiarism and claimed that he stole della Francesca's work on perspective, on arithmetic and on geometry.&lt;ref name="StAnd"/&gt;

===Illustrations===
[[File:Leonardo polyhedra.png|thumb|250px| The first printed illustration of a [[rhombicuboctahedron]], by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].]]
After these three parts are appended two sections of illustrations, the first showing twenty-three capital letters drawn with a ruler and compass by Pacioli and the second with some sixty illustrations in [[woodcut]] after drawings by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].&lt;ref name=X&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/drawings_and_prints/divina_proportione_leonardo_da_vinci/objectview.aspx?collID=9&amp;OID=90003660|website = The Collection Online|publisher = Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York|title = Divina proportione, after Leonardo da Vinci|accessdate = 15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonardo drew the illustrations of the regular solids while he lived with and took mathematics lessons from Pacioli. Leonardo's drawings are probably the first illustrations of skeletonic solids which allowed an easy distinction between front and back.

==History==
Pacioli produced three manuscripts of the treatise by different scribes. He gave the first copy with a dedication to the Duke of Milan, [[Ludovico il Moro]]; this manuscript is now preserved in Switzerland at the [[Bibliothèque Publique et Universitaire (Geneva)|Bibliothèque de Genève]] in [[Geneva]]. A second copy was donated to [[Galeazzo da Sanseverino]] and now rests at the [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana]] in Milan. The third, which has gone missing, was given to [[Pier Soderini]], the [[Gonfaloniere of Justice|Gonfaloniere]] of [[Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=PACIOLI, Luca|encyclopedia=Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani|language=Italian|volume=80|year=2014|last=Di Teodoro|first=Francesco Paolo|publisher=Treccani|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/luca-pacioli_%28Dizionario-Biografico%29/|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 June 1509 the first printed edition was published in Venice by [[Paganino Paganini]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=PAGANINI, Paganino|encyclopedia=Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani|language=Italian|volume=80|year=2014|last=Nuovo|first=Angela|publisher=Treccani|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/paganino-paganini_%28Dizionario-Biografico%29/|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has since been reprinted several times.

[[File:Fra Luca Pacioli Letter M 1509.png|thumb|250px| Architectural letter 'M']]
The book was displayed as part of an exhibition in Milan between October 2005 and October 2006 together with the [[Codex Atlanticus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.leonardo3.net/leonardo/atlantico/manoscritti_eng.htm|title = The Virtual Codex Atlanticus|website = Leonardo3|accessdate = 15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "M" logo used by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York is adapted from one in ''De divina proportione''.&lt;ref name=T&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://store.metmuseum.org/magnets-bookmarks+novelties/renaissance-m-bookmark/invt/10086668/|website = The Met Store|publisher = Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York|title = Renaissance 'M' Bookmark|accessdate = 15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notes ==

* This article uses the standard notation [[ISO 80000-2]], which supersedes [[ISO 31-11#Coordinate systems|ISO 31-11]], for [[spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinates]] (other sources may reverse the definitions of ''θ'' and ''φ''):
** The  polar angle is denoted by ''θ'': it is the angle between the ''z''-axis and the radial vector connecting the origin to the point in question.
** The [[azimuth|azimuthal angle]]  is denoted by ''φ'': it is the angle between the ''x''-axis and the projection of the radial vector onto the ''xy''-plane.
* The function {{nowrap|[[atan2]](''y'', ''x'')}} can be used instead of the mathematical function {{nowrap|[[arctan]](''y''/''x'')}} owing to its [[Domain of a function|domain]] and [[Image (mathematics)|image]]. The classical arctan function has an image of {{nowrap|(−π/2, +π/2)}}, whereas atan2 is defined to have an image of {{nowrap|(−π, π]}}.

:{{note|Alpha|α}} This page uses &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; for the polar angle and &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; for the azimuthal angle, which is common notation in physics. The source that is used for these formulae uses &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; for the azimuthal angle and &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; for the polar angle, which is common mathematical notation. In order to get the mathematics formulae, switch &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; in the formulae shown in the table above.

== Unit vector conversion formula ==
The unit vector of a coordinate parameter u is defined in such a way that a small positive change in u causes the position vector '''&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\vec{r}&lt;/math&gt;''' to change in &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\hat{u}&lt;/math&gt; direction.

Therefore, &lt;math&gt;{\partial\boldsymbol\vec{r} \over \partial u}={\partial{s} \over \partial u}{\boldsymbol\hat{u}}&lt;/math&gt; where s is the arc length parameter.

For two sets of coordinate systems &lt;math&gt;u_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_j&lt;/math&gt;, according to [[Differential of a function|chain rule]], &lt;math&gt;d\boldsymbol\vec{r}=\sum_{i}{\partial{\boldsymbol\vec{r}}\over\partial u_i}du_i=\sum_{i}{\partial{s}\over\partial u_i}\boldsymbol\hat{u_i}du_i=\sum_{j}{\partial{s}\over\partial v_j}\boldsymbol\hat{v_j}dv_j=\sum_{j}{\partial{s}\over\partial v_j}\boldsymbol\hat{v_j}\sum_{i}{\partial{v_j}\over\partial u_i}du_i=\sum_{i}\sum_{j}{\partial{s}\over\partial v_j}{\partial{v_j}\over\partial u_i}\boldsymbol\hat{v_j}du_i&lt;/math&gt;

Now, let all of &lt;math&gt;du_i=0&lt;/math&gt; but one and then divide both sides by the corresponding differential of that coordinate parameter, we find:

&lt;math&gt;{\partial{s}\over\partial u_i}\boldsymbol\hat{u_i}=\sum_{j}{\partial{s}\over\partial v_j}{\partial{v_j}\over\partial u_i}\boldsymbol\hat{v_j}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2964">In the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML), an '''Element''' is an abstract class with no superclass.&lt;ref name="OMG2"&gt;OMG Unified Modeling Language, Superstructure, Version 2.4.1&lt;/ref&gt; It is used as the superclass or base class, as known by object oriented programmers, for all the metaclasses in the UML infrastructure library. All other elements in the UML inherit, directly or indirectly from Element. An Element has a derived composition association to itself to support the general capability for elements to own other elements. As such, it has no additional attributes as part of its specification.

== Associations ==

An association describes a set of [[tuple]]s of typed instances.&lt;ref name="UML2"&gt;UML 2 Certification Guide, Tim Weilkiens and Bernd Oestereich - {{ISBN|0-12-373585-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*''ownedComment: Comment[*]'': An Element may own, or have associated to it, an arbitrary quantity of comments.&lt;ref name="OMG2" /&gt; A comment is sometimes referred to as a note.&lt;ref name="UML2" /&gt; The asterisk in brackets is the Comment's [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]] which means that there can be an arbitrary number of comments owned by an Element.
*''/ ownedElement: Element[*]'': An Element may own an arbitrary quantity of elements.&lt;ref name="OMG2" /&gt; This is called a derived union, symbolized by the forward slash notation. The asterisk in brackets is the Element's [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]] which means that there can be an arbitrary number of elements owned by an Element.
*''/ owner: Element[0..1]'': The Element that owns this element.&lt;ref name="OMG2" /&gt; This is called a derived union, symbolized by the forward slash notation. The [0..1] is the owning Element's [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]] which means that there can only be zero to one owner element.

The Element class belongs to the base package in the UML called the Kernel. This is the package that contains the superclasses that make up the superstructure of the UML.

Subclasses of Element provide semantics appropriate to the concept they represent. The comments for an Element add no semantics but may represent information useful to the reader of the model.&lt;ref name="OMG2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1969">'''Essential manifold''' a special type of closed manifolds. 
The notion was first introduced explicitly by [[Mikhail Gromov (mathematician)|Mikhail Gromov]].&lt;ref&gt;Gromov, M.: Filling Riemannian manifolds, J. Diff. Geom. 18 (1983), 1–147.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

A closed [[manifold]] ''M'' is called essential if its [[fundamental class]] [''M''] defines a nonzero element in the [[homology (mathematics)|homology]] of its [[fundamental group]] ''π'', or more precisely in the homology of the corresponding [[Eilenberg–MacLane space]] ''K''(''π'',&amp;nbsp;1), via the natural homomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;H_n(M)\to H_n(K(\pi,1))&lt;/math&gt;, 
where ''n'' is the dimension of ''M''.  Here the fundamental class is taken in homology with integer coefficients if the manifold is orientable, and in coefficients modulo 2, otherwise.

==Examples==

*All closed surfaces (i.e. 2-dimensional manifolds) are essential with the exception of the 2-sphere ''S&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''.
*Real projective space ''RP&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' is essential since the inclusion 
*:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{RP}^n \to \mathbb{RP}^{\infty}&lt;/math&gt;
:is injective in homology, where
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{RP}^{\infty} = K(\mathbb{Z}_2, 1)&lt;/math&gt;
:is the Eilenberg–MacLane space of the finite cyclic group of order 2.
*All compact [[aspherical manifold]]s are essential (since being aspherical means the manifold itself is already a ''K''(''π'',&amp;nbsp;1))
**In particular all compact [[hyperbolic manifold]]s are essential.
*All [[lens space]]s are essential.

==Properties==

*The [[connected sum]] of essential manifolds is essential.
*Any manifold which admits a map of nonzero degree to an essential manifold is itself essential.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4235">{{short description|A long flexible batten used to produce a fair curve through a set of points}}
{{Refimprove|date=February 2012}}
[[File:Spline (PSF).png|thumb|right|A spline]]
A '''spline''', or the more modern term '''flexible curve''', consists of a long strip fixed in position at a number of points that relaxes to form and hold a smooth curve passing through those points for the purpose of transferring that curve to another material.

Before computers were used for [[computer-aided design|creating engineering designs]], [[Technical drawing|drafting tools]] were employed by designers drawing by hand. To draw curves, especially for [[shipbuilding]], draftsmen often used long, thin, flexible strips of wood, plastic, or metal called splines (or [[lath]]s, not to be confused with [[lathe]]s). The splines were held in place with lead weights (called ducks because of their [[duck]]-like shape). The [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] of the spline material combined with the constraint of the control points, or [[Spline (mathematics)#Definition|knots]], would cause the strip to take the shape that minimized the energy required for bending it between the fixed points, this being the smoothest possible shape.

[[File:Krzywik.jpg|thumb|left|A modern flexible curve]]
Splines are more recently referred to as flexible curves and perform much of the original function.{{dubious|date=October 2018}}  The main difference between splines and flexible curves is that the control points{{clarify|reason=what control points?|date=October 2018}} of flexible curves are entirely internal in their housing.  This has one advantage over splines: whereas the draftsman had to first set up the spline and control points before moving the object to be marked to the spline in that order only,{{clarify|date=October 2018}} with flexible curves the draftsman can also set up the flexible curve before carefully moving the flexible curve to the object to be marked.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

One can recreate an original draftsman's spline device with weights and a length of thin stiff plastic or rubber tubing. The weights are attached to the tube (by gluing or pinning). The tubing is then placed over drawing paper. Crosses are marked on the paper to designate the knots or control points. The tube is then adjusted so that it passes over the control points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate = 2012-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, mathematicians started studying the spline shape and derived the piecewise [[polynomial]] formula known as the [[spline (mathematics)|spline curve]], or spline function. This has led to the widespread use of such functions in [[computer-aided design]], especially in the surface designs of vehicles. [[Isaac Jacob Schoenberg|I. J. Schoenberg]] gave the spline function its name after its resemblance to the mechanical spline used by draftsmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of the spline in wood-working may show in the conjectured etymology,{{by whom|date=October 2018}} which connects the word ''spline'' to the word ''splinter''.{{cn|date=October 2018}}{{OR|date=October 2018}} Later craftsmen have made splines out of rubber, steel, and other [[elastomer]]ic materials.

Spline devices help bend the wood for pianos, violins, violas, etc. The [[Wright brothers]] used one to shape the wings of their aircraft.

'''Franco P. Preparata''' is a [[computer scientist]], the [[An Wang]] Professor, Emeritus, of Computer Science at [[Brown University]].

He is best known for his 1985 book "Computational Geometry: An Introduction"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Computational Geometry - Springer|url = https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-1-4612-1098-6|doi = 10.1007/978-1-4612-1098-6|first = Franco P.|last = Preparata|first2 = Michael Ian|last2 = Shamos}}&lt;/ref&gt; into which he blended salient parts of [[Michael Ian Shamos|M. I.  Shamos']] doctoral thesis (Shamos appears as a co-author of the book). This book, which represents a snapshot of the disciplines as of 1985, has been for many years the standard textbook in the field, and has been translated into four foreign Languages (Russian, Japanese, Chinese, and Polish). He has made several contributions to the computational geometry, the most recent being the notion of "algorithmic degree" as a key feature to control robust implementations of geometric algorithms.

In addition, Preparata has worked in many other areas of, or closely related to, computer science.

His initial work was in coding theory, where he (independently and simultaneously) contributed the Berlekamp-Preparata codes (optimal convolution codes for burst-error correction) and the Preparata codes, the first known systematic class of nonlinear binary codes, with higher information content than corresponding linear BCH codes of the same length. Thirty years later these codes have been found relevant to quantum coding theory.

In 1967, he substantially contributed to a model of system-level fault diagnosis, known today as the PMC (Preparata-Metze-Chien) model, which is a main issue in the design of highly dependable processing systems. This model is still the object of intense research today (as attested by the literature).

Over the years, he was also active in research in parallel computation and VLSI theory. His 1979 paper (with J. Vuillemin), still highly cited, presented the cube-connected-cycles (CCC), a parallel architecture that optimally emulates the hypercube interconnection. This interconnection  was closely reflected in the architecture of the CM2 of Thinking Machines Inc., the first massive-parallel system in the VLSI era. His 1991 paper with Zhou and Kang on interconnection delays in VLSI was awarded the 1993 "Darlington Best Paper Award" by the IEEE Circuits and Systems Society. In the late nineties, (in joint work with G. Bilardi) he confronted the problem of the physical limitations (space and speed) of parallel computation, and formulated the conclusion that mesh connections are ultimately the only scalable massively parallel architectures.

More recently the focus of his research has been Computational Biology. Among other results, he contributed (with [[Eli Upfal]]) a novel approach  to DNA Sequencing by Hybridization,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sequencing-by-Hybridization at the Information-Theory Bound: An Optimal Algorithm|url = http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/106652700750050970|journal = Journal of Computational Biology|date = 2000-08-01|issn = 1066-5277|pages = 621–630|volume = 7|issue = 3-4|doi = 10.1089/106652700750050970|first = Franco P.|last = Preparata|first2 = Eli|last2 = Upfal|pmid=11108482}}&lt;/ref&gt; achieving sequencing lengths that are the square of what was previously known, which has attracted media coverage.

The unifying character of these results in diverse research areas is the methodological approach, based on the construction of precise mathematical models and the use of sophisticated mathematical techniques.

Preparata was born in Italy in December, 1935. He received a doctorate from the University of Rome, Italy  in 1959. After a postdoctorate at CNR and several years of working in industry, he joined the faculty of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1965, where he achieved the rank of Professor in 1970. He stayed at the UIUC  for many years, advising 16 Ph.D. students there. He received his Italian Libera Docenza in 1969. In 1991, Preparata moved from Illinois to Brown University where he has remained active in research, teaching, and student advising until his retirement at the end of 2013. He is the author (or co-author) of three books and nearly 250 articles. In 1997, the University of Padova awarded Preparata an honorary doctorate in Information Engineering. Preparata is an IEEE Fellow (1978),an ACM Fellow (1993), and was a Fellow of the Japan Society for the Advancement of Science.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2869">'''French mathematical seminars''' have been an important type of institution combining research and exposition, active since the beginning of the twentieth century. 

From 1909 to 1937, the [[Séminaire Hadamard]] has gathered many participants (f. i. [[André Weil]]) around the presentation of international research papers and work in progress. The [[Séminaire Julia]] focussed on yearly themes and impulsed the Bourbaki movement. The [[Séminaire Nicolas Bourbaki]] is the most famous, but is atypical in a number of ways: it attempts to cover, if selectively, the whole of [[pure mathematics]], and its talks are now, by convention, reports and surveys on research by someone not directly involved. More standard is a working group organised around a specialist area, with research talks given and written up 'from the horse's mouth'.

Historically speaking, the [[Séminaire Cartan]] of the late 1940s and early 1950s, around [[Henri Cartan]],  was one of the most influential. Publication in those days was by means of the duplicated ''exemplaire'' (limited distribution and not peer-reviewed). The seminar model was tested, almost to destruction, by the SGA series of [[Alexander Grothendieck]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4392">The ''' Gauss Lectureship''' (''Gauß-Vorlesung'') is an annually awarded mathematical distinction, named in honor of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]. It was established in 2001 by the [[German Mathematical Society]] with a series of lectures for a broad audience.

Each Gauss Lecture is paired with another presentation on the [[history of mathematics]].

The '''George Pólya Prize''' is a prize in [[mathematics]], awarded by the [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=George Polya Prize|url=http://www.siam.org/prizes/sponsored/polya.php|accessdate=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; First given in 1969, the prize is named after Hungarian mathematician [[George Pólya]].  It is now awarded in evenly numbered years. Starting in 1969 the prize money was provided by [[Frank Harary]], who donated the profits from his [[Graph Theory]] book. At some point{{when|date=October 2012}} SIAM took it over.  The first SIAM selection committee is listed as 2002.

The prize is given every two years, alternately in two categories: (1) for a notable application of combinatorial theory; (2) for a notable contribution in another area of interest to George Pólya such as approximation theory, complex analysis, number theory, orthogonal polynomials, probability theory, or mathematical discovery and learning.

The prize is broadly intended to recognize specific recent work. Prize committees may occasionally consider an award for cumulative work, but such awards should be rare.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11275">In [[mathematics]], a '''hereditary property''' is a property of an object, that inherits to all its  ''subobjects'', where the term subobject depends on the context. These properties are particularly considered in [[topology]] and [[graph theory]], but also in [[set theory]].

==In topology==
In [[topology]], a [[topological property]] is said to be ''hereditary'' if whenever a [[topological space]] has that property, then so does every [[Subspace topology|subspace]] of it.  If the latter is true only for [[Closed set|closed subspaces]], then the property is called ''weakly hereditary'' or
''closed-hereditary''.

For example, [[second countability]] and [[metrisability]] are hereditary properties. [[sequential space|Sequentiality]] and [[Compact space|Hausdorff compactness]] are weakly hereditary, but not hereditary.&lt;ref&gt;*Goreham, Anthony, "[http://www.citebase.org/cgi-bin/citations?id=oai:arXiv.org:math/0412558 Sequential Convergence in Topological Spaces]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Connected space|Connectivity]] is not weakly hereditary.

If ''P'' is a property of a topological space ''X'' and every subspace also has property ''P'', then ''X'' is said to be "hereditarily ''P''".

==In graph theory==
In [[graph theory]], a ''hereditary property'' is a [[graph property|property]] of a [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] which also holds for (is "inherited" by) its [[induced subgraph]]s.&lt;ref name="AS"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Alon|first = Noga|author-link = Noga Alon|last2 = Shapira| first2 = Asaf|title = Every monotone graph property is testable|journal = SIAM Journal on Computing|volume = 38|issue = 2|year = 2008|pages = 505–522|doi = 10.1137/050633445|url = http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~nogaa/PDFS/monotone1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternately, a hereditary property is preserved by the removal of vertices.  A graph class &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt; is said hereditary if it is closed under induced subgraphs.  Examples of hereditary graph classes are independent graphs (graphs with no edges), which is a special case (with ''c'' = 1) of being ''c''-colorable for some number ''c'', being [[Tree (graph theory)|forest]]s, [[Planar graph|planar]], [[Clique (graph theory)|complete]], [[Complete multipartite graph|complete multipartite]] etc.

In some cases, the term "hereditary" has been defined with reference to [[graph minor]]s, but this is more properly called a '''minor-hereditary property'''. The [[Robertson–Seymour theorem]] implies that a minor-hereditary property may be characterized in terms of a finite set of [[forbidden minor]]s.

The term "hereditary" has been also used for graph properties that are closed with respect to taking subgraphs.&lt;ref name="Survey"&gt;{{citation

This approach is used by the members of the scientific society [[Hereditarnia]] Club. The language of hereditary properties and induced-hereditary properties provides a powerful tool for study of structural properties of various types of generalized [[Graph coloring|colourings]].  The most important result from this area is the '''Unique Factorisation Theorem'''.&lt;ref name="UFT"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/jgt.20062 | volume=49 | issue=1 | title=Factorizations and characterizations of induced-hereditary and compositive properties | year=2005 | journal=Journal of Graph Theory | pages=11–27 | last1 = Farrugia | first1 = Alastair}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
===Monotone property=== &lt;!--Monotone_property redirects here--&gt;
There is no consensus for the meaning of "'''monotone property'''" in graph theory. Examples of definitions are:
* Preserved by the removal of edges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = King | first1 = R | year = 1990 | title = A lower bound for the recognition of digraph properties | url = | journal = Combinatorica | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 53–59 | doi=10.1007/bf02122695}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Preserved by the removal of edges and vertices (i.e., the property should hold for all subgraphs).&lt;ref name="AS" /&gt;
* Preserved by the addition of edges and vertices (i.e., the property should hold for all supergraphs).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cs.ucsc.edu/~optas/papers/k-col-threshold.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* Preserved by the addition of edges.&lt;ref&gt;Spinrad, J. (2003), ''Efficient Graph Representations'', AMS Bookstore, {{isbn|0-8218-2815-0}}, p9.&lt;/ref&gt; (This meaning is used in the statement of the [[Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture]].)

The complementary property of a property that is preserved by the removal of edges is preserved under the addition of edges. Hence some authors avoid this ambiguity by saying a property A is monotone if A or A&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; (the complement of A) is monotone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ashish Goel|title=Monotone properties of random geometric graphs have sharp thresholds|year=2003|author2=Sanatan Rai|author3=Bhaskar Krishnamachari|doi=10.1214/105051605000000575|journal=Annals of Applied Probability|volume=15|issue=4|pages=2535–2552|arxiv=math.PR/0310232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors choose to resolve this by using the term  ''increasing'' monotone for properties preserved under the addition of some object, and ''decreasing'' monotone for those preserved under the removal of the same object.

==In problem solving==
In [[planning]] and [[problem solving]], or more formally [[one-person game]]s, the search space is seen as a [[directed graph]] with ''states'' as nodes, and ''transitions'' as edges.  States can have properties, and such a property P is hereditary if ''for each state S that has P, each state that can be reached from S also has P''.

The subset of all states that have P plus the subset of all states that have ~P form a partition of the set of states called a [[hereditary partition]].  This notion can trivially be extended to more discriminating partitions by instead of properties, considering ''aspects'' of states and their domains.  If states have an aspect A, with d&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;sub; D a partition of the domain D of A, then the subsets of states for which A&amp;isin;d&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; form a hereditary partition of the total set of states.

If the current state and the goal state are in different elements of a hereditary partition, there is no path from the current state to the goal state — the problem has no solution.

Can a checkers board be covered with domino tiles, each of which covers exactly two adjacent fields?  Yes.  What if we remove the top left and the bottom right field?  Then no covering is possible any more, because the difference between number of uncovered white fields and the number of uncovered black fields is 2, and adding a domino tile (which covers one white and one black field) keeps that number at 2.  For a total covering the number is 0, so a total covering cannot be reached from the start position.

This notion was first introduced by [[Laurent Siklóssy]] and Roach&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1624822 |title=Proving the Impossible is impossible is possible}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==In model theory==
In [[model theory]] and [[universal algebra]], a class ''K'' of [[structure (mathematical logic)|structures]] of a given [[signature (logic)|signature]] is said to have the ''hereditary property'' if every [[substructure (mathematics)|substructure]] of a structure in ''K'' is again in ''K''. A variant of this definition is used in connection with [[Fraïssé's theorem]]: A class ''K'' of finitely generated structures has the ''hereditary property'' if every finitely generated substructure is again in ''K''. See [[age (model theory)|age]].

==In matroid theory==
In a [[matroid]], every subset of an independent set is again independent. This is also sometimes called the ''hereditary property.''

==In set theory==
[[Recursive definition]]s using the adjective "hereditary" are often encountered in [[set theory]].

A [[Set (mathematics)|set]] is said to be [[Hereditary set|hereditary (or ''pure'')]] if all of its elements are hereditary sets. It is [[vacuously true]] that the empty set is a hereditary set, and thus the set &lt;math&gt;\{\varnothing\}&lt;/math&gt; containing only the [[empty set]] &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; is a hereditary set, and [[recursion|recursively]] so is &lt;math&gt;\{\varnothing, \{\varnothing \}\}&lt;/math&gt;, for example. In formulations of set theory that are intended to be interpreted in the [[von Neumann universe]] or to express the content of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], all sets are hereditary, because the only sort of object that is even a candidate to be an element of a set is another set. Thus the notion of hereditary set is interesting only in a context in which there may be [[urelement]]s.

A couple of notions are defined analogously:
* A [[hereditarily finite set]] is defined as a [[finite set]] consisting of zero or more hereditarily finite sets. Equivalently, a set is hereditarily finite if and only if its [[transitive set|transitive closure]] is finite.
* A [[hereditarily countable set]] is a [[countable set]] of hereditarily countable sets.  Assuming the [[axiom of countable choice]], then a set is hereditarily countable if and only if its transitive closure is countable.

Based on the above, it follows that in ZFC a more general notion can be defined for any predicate &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x)&lt;/math&gt;. A set ''x'' is said to have ''hereditarily'' the property &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; if ''x'' itself and all members of its transitive closure satisfy &lt;math&gt;\Phi(y)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;x\cup \mathop{\rm tc}(x)\subseteq \{y\mid\Phi(y)\}&lt;/math&gt;. Equivalently, ''x'' hereditarily satisfies &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; [[iff]] it is a member of a transitive subset of &lt;math&gt;\{y\mid\Phi(y)\}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Azriel Levy (2002), ''Basic set theory'', p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Forster (2003), ''Logic, induction and sets'', p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; A property (of a set) is thus said to be hereditary if is inherited by every subset. For example, being well-ordered is a hereditary property, and so it being finite.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Roitman (1990), ''Introduction to modern set theory'', p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

If we instantiate in the above schema &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; with "''x'' has cardinality less than κ", we obtain the more general notion of a set being ''hereditarily of cardinality less than κ'', usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;H_\kappa &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levy (2002), p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; or &lt;math&gt;H(\kappa) &lt;/math&gt;. We regain the two simple notions we introduced above as &lt;math&gt;H(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; being the set of hereditarily finite sets and &lt;math&gt;H(\omega_1)&lt;/math&gt; being the set of hereditarily countable sets.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Kunen (1983), ''Set theory'', p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\omega_1&lt;/math&gt; is the [[first uncountable ordinal]].)

In [[geometry]], the '''hinge theorem''' states that if two sides of one [[triangle]] are [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] to two sides of another triangle, and the [[Congruence_(geometry)#Congruence_of_triangles|included angle]] of the first is larger than the included angle of the second, then the third side of the first triangle is longer than the third side of the second triangle. This theorem is actually Propositions 24 of Book 1 of [[Euclid's Elements]] (sometimes called the '''open mouth theorem'''). The theorem states the following:

{{Quote|text=If two sides of one triangle are congruent, respectively, to two sides of a second triangle, and the included angle of the first triangle is larger than the included angle of the second, then the third side of the first triangle is longer than the third side of the second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moise|first1=Edwin|last2=Downs, Jr.|first2=Floyd|title=Geometry|date=1991|publisher=Addison-Wesley Publishing Company|isbn=0201253356|page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Euclidean == 

The hinge theorem holds in [[Euclidean space]]s and more generally in simply connected non-positively curved [[space form]]s.

It can be also extended from plane Euclidean geometry to higher dimension Euclidean spaces (e.g., to tetrahedra and more generally to simplices), as has been done for orthocentric tetrahedra (i.e., tetrahedra in which altitudes are concurrent)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abu-Saymeh|first=Sadi|author2=Mowaffaq Hajja|author3=Mostafa Hayajneh|title=The open mouth theorem, or the scissors lemma, for orthocentric tetrahedra|journal=Journal of Geometry|year=2012|volume=103|issue=1|pages=1–16|doi=10.1007/s00022-012-0116-4|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/g1n21875438457l0/?MUD=MP}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more generally for orthocentric simplices (i.e., simplices in which altitudes are concurrent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hajja|first=Mowaffaq|author2=Mostafa Hayajneh|title=The open mouth theorem in higher dimensions|journal=Linear Algebra and Its Applications|date=August 1, 2012|volume=437|issue=3|page=1057-1069|doi=10.1016/j.laa.2012.03.012|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/science/article/pii/S0024379512002121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Converse ==

The [[Conversion (logic)|converse]] of the hinge theorem is also true: If the two sides of one triangle are congruent to two sides of another triangle, and the third side of the first triangle is greater than the third side of the second triangle, then the included angle of the first triangle is larger than the included angle of the second triangle. 

In some textbooks, the theorem and its converse are written as the [[solution of triangles|SAS]] Inequality Theorem and the [[solution of triangles|SSS]] Inequality Theorem respectively.

In [[cryptography]], the '''hybrid argument''' is a proof technique used to show that two distributions are [[Computational indistinguishability|computationally indistinguishable]].

==Formal description==
Formally, to show two distributions ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are computationally indistinguishable, we can define a sequence of ''hybrid distributions'' ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; := ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; =: ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; where ''t'' is polynomial in the security parameter. Define the advantage of any probabilistic efficient (polynomial-bounded time) algorithm '''A''' as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{Adv}_{H_i, H_{i+1}}^{\mathsf{dist}}(\mathbf{A}) := \left|\Pr[x \stackrel{\$}{\gets} H_i : \mathbf{A}(x)=1] - \Pr[x \stackrel{\$}{\gets} H_{i+1} : \mathbf{A}(x)=1] \right|,&lt;/math&gt;

where the dollar symbol ($) denotes that we sample an element from the distribution at random.

By [[triangle inequality]], it is clear that for any probabilistic polynomial time algorithm '''A''',

:&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{Adv}_{D_1, D_2}^{\mathsf{dist}}(\mathbf{A}) \leq \sum_{i=0}^{t-1}\mathsf{Adv}_{H_i, H_{i+1}}^{\mathsf{dist}}(\mathbf{A}).&lt;/math&gt;

Thus there must exist some ''k'' s.t. 0 ≤ ''k'' &lt; ''t'' and

:&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{Adv}_{H_k, H_{k+1}}^{\mathsf{dist}}(\mathbf{A}) \geq \mathsf{Adv}_{D_1, D_2}^{\mathsf{dist}}(\mathbf{A})/t.&lt;/math&gt;

Since ''t'' is polynomial-bounded, for any such algorithm '''A''', if we can show that its advantage to distinguish the distributions ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt; is negligible for every ''i'', then it immediately follows that its advantage to distinguish the distributions ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; must also be negligible. This fact gives rise to the hybrid argument: it suffices to find such a sequence of hybrid distributions and show each pair of them is computationally indistinguishable.&lt;ref&gt;Lemma 3 in Dodis's notes.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The hybrid argument is extensively used in cryptography. Some simple proofs using hybrid arguments are:
* If one cannot efficiently predict the next bit of the output of some number generator, then this generator is a [[pseudorandom number generator]] (PRG).&lt;ref&gt;Theorem 1 in Dodis's notes.&lt;/ref&gt;
* We can securely expand a PRG with 1-bit output into a PRG with ''n''-bit output.&lt;ref&gt;Lemma 80.5, Corollary 81.7 in Pass's notes.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3887">A '''hypertranscendental function''' or '''transcendentally transcendental function''' is an [[analytic function]] which is not the solution of an [[algebraic differential equation]] with coefficients in '''Z''' (the [[integer]]s) and with algebraic [[initial condition]]s. All hypertranscendental functions are [[transcendental function]]s.

==History==

The term 'transcendentally transcendental' was introduced by [[E. H. Moore]] in 1896; the term 'hypertranscendental' was introduced by [[D. D. Morduhai-Boltovskoi]] in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;D. D. Mordykhai-Boltovskoi, "On hypertranscendence of the function ξ(x, s)", ''Izv. Politekh. Inst. Warsaw''&lt;!-- what is the full name of this journal? presumably something like Izwiestija Politechniki Instituti Warszawskiej, but (a) I don't know Polish (b) I haven't been able to find a journal of that name or similar--&gt; '''2''':1-16 (1914), cited in Anatoly A. Karatsuba, S. M. Voronin, ''The Riemann Zeta-Function'', 1992, {{ISBN|3-11-013170-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fNontpCu9kQC&amp;pg=PA390 p. 390]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Morduhaĭ-Boltovskoĭ|1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

One standard definition (there are slight variants) defines solutions of [[differential equation]]s of the form
:&lt;math&gt;F\left(x, y, y', \cdots, y^{(n)} \right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial with constant coefficients, as ''algebraically transcendental'' or ''differentially algebraic''. Transcendental functions which are not ''algebraically transcendental'' are ''transcendentally transcendental''. [[Hölder's theorem]] shows that the [[gamma function]] is in this category.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eliakim H. Moore]], "Concerning Transcendentally Transcendental Functions", ''Mathematische Annalen'' '''48''':1-2:49-74 (1896) {{doi|10.1007/BF01446334}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Daniel Carmichael|R. D. Carmichael]], "On Transcendentally Transcendental Functions", ''Transactions of the American Mathematical Society'' '''14''':3:311-319 (July 1913) [http://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1913-014-03/S0002-9947-1913-1500949-2/S0002-9947-1913-1500949-2.pdf full text] {{jstor|1988599}} {{doi|10.1090/S0002-9947-1913-1500949-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee A. Rubel, "A Survey of Transcendentally Transcendental Functions", ''The American Mathematical Monthly'' '''96''':777-788 (November 1989) {{jstor|2324840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hypertranscendental functions usually arise as the solutions to [[functional equation]]s, for example the [[gamma function]].

==Examples==

===Hypertranscendental functions===
* The zeta functions of [[algebraic number field]]s, in particular, the [[Riemann zeta function]]
* The [[gamma function]] (''cf.'' [[Hölder's theorem]])

===Transcendental but not hypertranscendental functions ===
* The [[exponential function]], [[logarithm]], and the [[trigonometric function|trigonometric]] and [[hyperbolic function|hyperbolic]] functions.
* The [[generalized hypergeometric function]]s, including special cases such as [[Bessel function]]s (except some special cases which are algebraic).

===Non-transcendental (algebraic) functions===
* All [[algebraic function]]s, in particular [[polynomial]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4948">In [[mathematics]], an '''invariant measure''' is a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] that is preserved by some [[function (mathematics)|function]]. [[Ergodic theory]] is the study of invariant measures in [[dynamical systems]]. The [[Krylov–Bogolyubov theorem]] proves the existence of invariant measures under certain conditions on the function and space under consideration.

==Definition==
Let (''X'',&amp;nbsp;Σ) be a [[measurable space]] and let ''f'' be a [[measurable function]] from ''X'' to itself. A measure ''μ'' on (''X'',&amp;nbsp;Σ) is said to be '''invariant under''' ''f'' if, for every measurable set ''A'' in Σ,

:&lt;math&gt;\mu \left( f^{-1} (A) \right) = \mu (A).&lt;/math&gt;

In terms of the [[pushforward measure|push forward]], this states that ''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;(''μ'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''μ''.

The collection of measures (usually [[probability measure]]s) on ''X'' that are invariant under ''f'' is sometimes denoted ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''). The collection of [[ergodic (adjective)|ergodic measures]], ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''), is a subset of ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''). Moreover, any [[convex combination]] of two invariant measures is also invariant, so ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') is a [[convex set]]; ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') consists precisely of the extreme points of ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'').

In the case of a [[Dynamical system (definition)|dynamical system]] (''X'',&amp;nbsp;''T'',&amp;nbsp;''φ''), where (''X'',&amp;nbsp;Σ) is a measurable space as before, ''T'' is a [[monoid]] and ''φ''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''T''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''X'' is the flow map, a measure ''μ'' on (''X'',&amp;nbsp;Σ) is said to be an '''invariant measure''' if it is an invariant measure for each map ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''X''. Explicitly, ''μ'' is invariant [[if and only if]]

:&lt;math&gt;\mu \left( \varphi_{t}^{-1} (A) \right) = \mu (A) \qquad \forall  t \in T, A \in \Sigma.&lt;/math&gt;

Put another way, ''μ'' is an invariant measure for a sequence of [[random variable]]s (''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''t''≥0&lt;/sub&gt; (perhaps a [[Markov chain]] or the solution to a [[stochastic differential equation]]) if, whenever the initial condition ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is distributed according to ''μ'', so is ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; for any later time ''t''.

When the dynamical system can be described by a [[transfer operator]], then the invariant measure is an eigenvector of the operator, corresponding to an eigenvalue of 1, this being the largest eigenvalue as given by the [[Frobenius-Perron theorem]].

==Examples==
:[[File:Hyperbolic sector squeeze mapping.svg|250px|right|thumb|[[Squeeze mapping]] leaves [[hyperbolic angle]] invariant as it moves a [[hyperbolic sector]] (purple) to one of the same area. Blue and green rectangles also keep the same area]]
* Consider the [[real line]] '''R''' with its usual [[Borel sigma algebra|Borel &amp;sigma;-algebra]]; fix ''a'' ∈ '''R''' and consider the translation map ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; : '''R''' → '''R''' given by:

::&lt;math&gt;T_{a} (x) = x + a.&lt;/math&gt;

: Then one-dimensional [[Lebesgue measure]] ''&amp;lambda;'' is an invariant measure for ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;.

* More generally, on ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with its usual Borel σ-algebra, ''n''-dimensional Lebesgue measure ''λ''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is an invariant measure for any [[isometry]] of Euclidean space, i.e. a map ''T'' : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; that can be written as

::&lt;math&gt;T(x) = A x + b&lt;/math&gt;

: for some ''n'' &amp;times; ''n'' [[orthogonal matrix]] ''A'' &amp;isin; O(''n'') and a vector ''b'' &amp;isin; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

* The invariant measure in the first example is unique up to trivial renormalization with a constant factor. This does not have to be necessarily the case: Consider a set consisting of just two points &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\rm S}=\{A,B\}&lt;/math&gt; and the identity map &lt;math&gt;T={\rm Id}&lt;/math&gt; which leaves each point fixed. Then any probability measure &lt;math&gt;\mu : \boldsymbol{\rm S} \rightarrow \boldsymbol{\rm R} &lt;/math&gt; is invariant. Note that '''S''' trivially has a decomposition into ''T''-invariant components ''{A}'' and ''{B}''.
* The measure of [[angle|circular angles]] in [[degree (angle)|degree]]s or [[radian]]s is invariant under [[rotation]]. Similarly, the measure of [[hyperbolic angle]] is invariant under [[squeeze mapping]].
* [[Area]] measure in the Euclidean plane is invariant under [[2 × 2 real matrices#Equi-areal mapping|2 × 2 real matrices with determinant 1]], also known as the ''special linear group'' [[SL(2,R)]].
* Every [[locally compact group]] has a [[Haar measure]] that is invariant under the group action.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1786">In [[astrophysics]] and [[statistical mechanics]], '''Jeans's theorem''', named after [[James Jeans]], states that any steady-state solution of the collisionless [[Boltzmann equation]] depends on the phase space coordinates only through [[constant of motion|integrals of motion]] in the given potential, and conversely any function of the integrals is a steady-state solution.

Jeans's theorem is most often discussed in the context of potentials characterized by three, global integrals. In such potentials, all of the orbits are regular, i.e. non-[[chaos theory|chaotic]]; the [[Orbital elements|Kepler potential]] is one example. In generic potentials, some orbits respect only one or two integrals and the corresponding motion is chaotic. Jeans's theorem can be generalized to such potentials as follows:&lt;ref name=DEGN&gt;{{cite book|last=Merritt|first=David|author-link=David Merritt|title=Dynamics and Evolution of Galactic Nuclei|date=2013|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=978-0-691-12101-7|lccn=2013936624|pages=67–68|url=http://openlibrary.org/works/OL16802359W/Dynamics_and_Evolution_of_Galactic_Nuclei}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The phase-space density of a stationary stellar system is constant within every well-connected region.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A well-connected region is one that cannot be decomposed into two finite regions such that all trajectories lie, for all time, in either one or the other. [[Invariant torus|Invariant tori]] of regular orbits are such regions, but so are the more complex parts of phase space associated with chaotic trajectories. Integrability of the motion is therefore not required for a steady state.

The '''Kerala School of Astronomy and Mathematics''' was a school of [[Indian mathematics|mathematics]] and [[Indian astronomy|astronomy]] founded by [[Madhava of Sangamagrama]] in [[Kerala]], India, which included among its members: [[Parameshvara]], [[Neelakanta Somayaji]], [[Jyeshtadeva]], [[Achyuta Pisharati]], [[Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri]] and [[Achyuta Panikkar]]. The school flourished between the 14th and 16th centuries and the original discoveries of the school seems to have ended with [[Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri|Narayana Bhattathiri]] (1559–1632).  In attempting to solve astronomical problems, the Kerala school independently created a number of important mathematics concepts. Their most important results—series expansion for trigonometric functions—were described in [[Sanskrit]] verse in a book by Neelakanta called ''[[Tantrasangraha]]'', and again in  a commentary on this work, called ''Tantrasangraha-vakhya'', of unknown authorship. The theorems were stated without proof, but proofs for the series for sine, cosine, and inverse tangent were provided a century later in the work ''[[Yuktibhasa]]'' ({{circa|1500|1610}}), written in [[Malayalam]], by Jyesthadeva, and also in a commentary on ''Tantrasangraha''.&lt;ref name=roy&gt;Roy, Ranjan.  1990. "Discovery of the Series Formula for &lt;math&gt; \pi &lt;/math&gt; by Leibniz, Gregory, and Nilakantha."  ''Mathematics Magazine'' (Mathematical Association of America) 63(5):291–306.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their work, completed two centuries before the invention of [[calculus]] in Europe, provided what is now considered the first example of a [[power series]] (apart from geometric series).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Stillwell|2004|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they did not formulate a systematic theory of [[derivative|differentiation]] and [[integral|integration]], nor is there any direct evidence of their results being transmitted outside [[Kerala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bressoud|2002|p=12}} Quote: "There is no evidence that the Indian work on series was known beyond India, or even outside Kerala, until the nineteenth century. Gold and Pingree assert [4] that by the time these series were rediscovered in Europe, they had, for all practical purposes, been lost to India. The expansions of the sine, cosine, and arc tangent had been passed down through several generations of disciples, but they remained sterile observations for which no one could find much use."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Plofker|2001|p=293}} Quote: "It is not unusual to encounter in discussions of Indian mathematics such assertions as that "the concept of differentiation was understood [in India] from the time of Manjula (... in the 10th century)" [Joseph 1991, 300], or that "we may consider Madhava to have been the founder of mathematical analysis" (Joseph 1991, 293), or that Bhaskara II may claim to be "the precursor of Newton and Leibniz in the discovery of the principle of the differential calculus" (Bag 1979, 294). ... The points of resemblance, particularly between early European calculus and the Keralese work on power series, have even inspired suggestions of a possible transmission of mathematical ideas from the Malabar coast in or after the 15th century to the Latin scholarly world (e.g., in (Bag 1979, 285)). ... It should be borne in mind, however, that such an emphasis on the similarity of Sanskrit (or Malayalam) and Latin mathematics risks diminishing our ability fully to see and comprehend the former. To speak of the Indian "discovery of the principle of the differential calculus" somewhat obscures the fact that Indian techniques for expressing changes in the Sine by means of the Cosine or vice versa, as in the examples we have seen, remained within that specific trigonometric context.  The differential "principle" was not generalized to arbitrary  functions—in fact, the explicit notion of an arbitrary function, not to mention that of its
derivative or an algorithm for taking the derivative, is irrelevant here"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pingree|1992|p=562}} Quote: "One example I can give you relates to the Indian Mādhava's demonstration, in about 1400 A.D., of the infinite power series of trigonometrical functions using geometrical and algebraic arguments. When this was first described in English by Charles Whish, in the 1830s, it was heralded as the Indians' discovery of the calculus. This claim and Mādhava's achievements were ignored by Western historians, presumably at first because they could not admit that an Indian discovered the calculus, but later because no one read anymore the ''Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society'', in which Whish's article was published. The matter resurfaced in the 1950s, and now we have the Sanskrit texts properly edited, and we understand the clever way that Mādhava derived the series ''without'' the calculus; but many historians still find it impossible to conceive of the problem and its solution in terms of anything other than the calculus and proclaim that the calculus is what Mādhava found. In this case the elegance and brilliance of Mādhava's mathematics are being distorted as they are buried under the current mathematical solution to a problem to which he discovered an alternate and powerful solution."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Katz|1995|pp=173–174}} Quote: "How close did Islamic and Indian scholars come to inventing the calculus? Islamic scholars nearly developed a general formula for finding integrals of polynomials by A.D. 1000—and evidently could find such a formula for any polynomial in which they were interested.  But, it appears, they were not interested in any polynomial of degree higher than four, at least in any of the material that has come down to us.  Indian scholars, on the other hand, were by 1600 able to use ibn al-Haytham's sum formula for arbitrary integral powers in calculating power series for the functions in which they were interested.  By the same time, they also knew how to calculate the differentials of these functions.  So some of the basic ideas of calculus were known in Egypt and India many centuries before Newton.  It does not appear, however, that either Islamic or Indian mathematicians saw the necessity of connecting some of the disparate ideas that we include under the name calculus.  They were apparently only interested in specific cases in which these ideas were needed.&lt;br&gt;{{quad}}There is no danger, therefore, that we will have to rewrite the history texts to remove the statement that Newton and Leibniz invented the calculus.  They were certainly the ones who were able to combine many differing ideas under the two unifying themes of the derivative and the integral, show the connection between them, and turn the calculus into the great problem-solving tool we have today."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions==

===Infinite series and calculus===
The Kerala school has made a number of contributions to the fields of [[Series (mathematics)|infinite series]] and [[calculus]]. These include the following (infinite) geometric series:

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{1-x} = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + \cdots \text{ for } |x|&lt;1 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name =singh&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Singh | first1 = A. N. | date = 1936 | title = On the Use of Series in Hindu Mathematics | url = | journal = Osiris | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 606–628 |doi = 10.1086/368443 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Kerala school made intuitive use of [[mathematical induction]], though the [[Inductive hypothesis#Formal description|inductive hypothesis]] was not yet formulated or employed in proofs.&lt;ref name=roy/&gt; They used this to discover a semi-rigorous proof of the result:

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;1^p+ 2^p + \cdots + n^p \approx \frac{n^{p+1}}{p+1}&lt;/math&gt;}}

for large ''n''.  

They applied ideas from (what was to become) [[Derivative|differential]] and [[integral]] [[calculus]] to obtain ([[Taylor series|Taylor–Maclaurin]]) infinite series for &lt;math&gt;\sin x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\cos x&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; \arctan x&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=bressoud&gt;Bressoud, David.  2002.  "Was Calculus Invented in India?"  ''The College Mathematics Journal'' (Mathematical Association of America).  33(1):2–13.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Tantrasangraha-vakhya'' gives the series in verse, which when translated to mathematical notation, can be written as:&lt;ref name=roy/&gt;

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;r\arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) = \frac{1}{1}\cdot\frac{ry}{x} -\frac{1}{3}\cdot\frac{ry^3}{x^3} + \frac{1}{5}\cdot\frac{ry^5}{x^5} - \cdots, \text{ where } \frac y x \leq 1. &lt;/math&gt;}}

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;r\sin \frac{x}{r} = x - x\cdot\frac{x^2}{(2^2+2)r^2} + x\cdot \frac{x^2}{(2^2+2)r^2}\cdot\frac{x^2}{(4^2+4)r^2} - \cdot &lt;/math&gt;}}

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt; r \left( 1 - \cos \frac{x}{r} \right) = r \frac{x^2}{(2^2-2)r^2} - r \frac{x^2}{(2^2-2)r^2}\cdot \frac{x^2}{(4^2-4)r^2} + \cdots 
&lt;/math&gt;}}

where, for &lt;math&gt; r = 1, &lt;/math&gt; the series reduce to the standard power series for these trigonometric functions, for example:

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\sin x = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \frac{x^7}{7!} + \cdots &lt;/math&gt; and}}

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\cos x = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \frac{x^6}{6!} + \cdots &lt;/math&gt;}}

(The Kerala school did not use the "factorial" symbolism.)

The Kerala school made use of the rectification (computation of length) of the arc of a circle to give a proof of these results.  (The later method of Leibniz, using quadrature (''i.e.'' computation of area under the arc of the circle), was not yet developed.)&lt;ref name=roy/&gt; They also made use of the series expansion of &lt;math&gt;\arctan x&lt;/math&gt; to obtain an infinite series expression (later known as Gregory series) for &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref name=roy/&gt;
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{4} = 1 - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{7} + \cdots  &lt;/math&gt;}}

Their rational approximation of the ''error'' for the finite sum of their series are of particular interest.  For example, the error, &lt;math&gt;f_i(n+1)&lt;/math&gt;, (for ''n'' odd, and ''i = 1, 2, 3'') for the series:

{{block indent| &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{4} \approx 1 - \frac{1}{3}+ \frac{1}{5} - \cdots (-1)^{(n-1)/2}\frac{1}{n} + (-1)^{(n+1)/2}f_i(n+1)&lt;/math&gt;
{{block indent|where &lt;math&gt;f_1(n) = \frac{1}{2n}, \ f_2(n) = \frac{n/2}{n^2+1}, \ f_3(n) = \frac{(n/2)^2+1}{(n^2+5)n/2}.&lt;/math&gt;}}}}

They manipulated the terms, using the partial fraction expansion of :&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{n^3-n}&lt;/math&gt; to obtain a more rapidly converging series for &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref name=roy/&gt;

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{3}{4} + \frac{1}{3^3-3} - \frac{1}{5^3-5} + \frac{1}{7^3-7} - \cdots  &lt;/math&gt;}}

They used the improved series to derive a rational expression,&lt;ref name=roy/&gt; &lt;math&gt;104348/33215&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; correct up to nine decimal places, i.e. &lt;math&gt;3.141592653&lt;/math&gt;. They made use of an intuitive notion of a [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]] to compute these results.&lt;ref name=roy/&gt; The Kerala school mathematicians also gave a semi-rigorous method of differentiation of some trigonometric functions,&lt;ref name=katz&gt;Katz, V. J.  1995.  "Ideas of Calculus in Islam and India."  ''Mathematics Magazine'' (Mathematical Association of America),  68(3):163-174.&lt;/ref&gt; though the notion of a function, or of exponential or logarithmic functions, was not yet formulated.

===Recognition===
In 1825 John Warren published a memoir on the division of time in southern India,&lt;ref&gt;John Warren (1825) [https://books.google.ca/books?id=nttCAAAAcAAJ A Collection of Memoirs on Various Modes According to which Nations of the Southern Part of India Divide Time] from [[Google Books]]&lt;/ref&gt; called the ''Kala Sankalita'', which briefly mentions the discovery of infinite series by Kerala astronomers. 

The works of the Kerala school were first written up for the Western world by Englishman [[C. M. Whish]] in 1835. According to Whish, the Kerala mathematicians had "laid the foundation for a complete system of fluxions" and these works abounded "with fluxional forms and series to be found in no work of foreign countries".&lt;ref name="charles"&gt;{{Citation 
 | author =Charles Whish
 | year = 1835
 | title = Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland
 | publisher = 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; However, Whish's results were almost completely neglected, until over a century later, when the discoveries of the Kerala school were investigated again by [[C. T. Rajagopal]] and his associates. Their work includes commentaries on the proofs of the arctan series in ''Yuktibhasa'' given in two papers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rajagopal | first1 = C. | last2 = Rangachari | first2 = M.

In 1952 [[Otto Neugebauer]] wrote on Tamil astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Neugebauer]] (1952) "Tamil Astronomy", [[Osiris (journal)|Osiris]] 10: 252–76&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1972 [[K. V. Sarma]] published his [[A History of the Kerala School of Hindu Astronomy]] which described features of the School such as the continuity of knowledge transmission from the 13th to the 17th century:  [[Govinda Bhattathiri]] to [[Parameshvara]] to [[Damodara]] to [[Nilakantha Somayaji]] to [[Jyesthadeva]] to [[Acyuta Pisarati]]. Transmission from teacher to pupil conserved knowledge in "a practical, demonstrative discipline like astronomy at a time when there was not a proliferation of printed books and public schools."

In 1994 it was argued that the [[heliocentric model]] had been adopted about 1500 A.D. in Kerala.&lt;ref&gt;K. Ramasubramanian, M. D. Srinivas &amp; M. S. Sriram (1994) [http://www.physics.iitm.ac.in/~labs/amp/kerala-astronomy.pdf Modification of the earlier Indian planetary theory by the Kerala astronomers (c. 1500 A.D.) and the implied heliocentric picture of planetary motion], [[Current Science]] 66(10): 784–90 via [[Indian Institute of Technology Madras]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possibility of transmission of Kerala School results to Europe==
A. K. Bag suggested in 1979 that knowledge of these results might have been transmitted to Europe through the trade route from [[Kerala]] by traders and [[Jesuit]] missionaries.&lt;ref&gt;A. K. Bag (1979) ''Mathematics in ancient and medieval India''. Varanasi/Delhi: Chaukhambha Orientalia. page 285.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kerala was in continuous contact with China and [[Arabia]], and [[Europe]].  The suggestion of some communication routes and a chronology by some scholars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Raju | first1 = C. K. |authorlink=C. K. Raju | date = 2001 | title = Computers, Mathematics Education, and the Alternative Epistemology of the Calculus in the Yuktibhasa | url = | journal = Philosophy East and West | volume = 51 | issue = 3| pages = 325–362 | doi=10.1353/pew.2001.0045}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=almeida/&gt; could make such a transmission a possibility; however, there is no direct evidence by way of relevant manuscripts that such a transmission took place.&lt;ref name=almeida&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Almeida | first1 = D.

Both [[Islamic mathematics|Arab]] and Indian scholars made discoveries before the 17th century that are now considered a part of calculus.&lt;ref name=katz/&gt; According to V.J. Katz, they were yet to "combine many differing ideas under the two unifying themes of the [[derivative]] and the [[integral]], show the connection between the two, and turn calculus into the great problem-solving tool we have today", like [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]].&lt;ref name=katz/&gt; The intellectual careers of both Newton and Leibniz are well-documented and there is no indication of their work not being their own;&lt;ref name=katz/&gt; however, it is not known with certainty whether the immediate ''predecessors'' of Newton and Leibniz, "including, in particular, Fermat and Roberval, learned of some of the ideas of the Islamic and Indian mathematicians through sources of which we are not now aware".&lt;ref name=katz/&gt; This is an active area of current research, especially in the manuscript collections of Spain and [[Maghreb]], research that is now being pursued, among other places, at the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]] in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name=katz/&gt;

[[File:Arbre Binomial Options Reelles.png|thumb|right| Binomial Lattice with [[Binomial options pricing model#STEP 1: Create the binomial price tree|CRR formulae]] ]]

In [[finance]], a '''lattice model'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lattice-model.asp|title=Lattice-Based Model|first=Investopedia|last=Staff|date=17 November 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a technique applied to the [[Valuation of options|valuation of derivatives]], where a [[discrete time]] model is required. For [[stock option|equity options]], a typical example would be pricing an [[American option]], where a decision as to [[Exercise (options)|option exercise]] is required at "all" times (any time) before and including maturity. A continuous model, on the other hand, such as [[Black–Scholes model|Black–Scholes]], would only allow for the valuation of [[European option]]s, where exercise is on the [[Expiration (options)|option's maturity date]]. For [[interest rate derivatives]] lattices are additionally useful in that they address many of the issues encountered with continuous models, such as [[pull to par]].&lt;ref&gt;Hull, J. C. (2006). Options, futures, and other derivatives. Pearson Education India.&lt;/ref&gt; The method is also used for valuing certain  [[exotic option]]s, where because of [[path dependence]] in the payoff,  [[Monte Carlo methods for option pricing]] fail to account for optimal decisions to terminate the derivative by early exercise.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, J. C., Ross, S. A., &amp; Rubinstein, M. (1979). Option pricing: A simplified approach. Journal of financial Economics, 7(3), 229-263.&lt;/ref&gt;

|'''Tree-based equity option valuation:'''
1. Construct the tree of equity-prices: 
*Either forward-construct, applying an up or down factor (&lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;) to the current price, such that in the next period the price will either be &lt;math&gt;S_{up} = S \cdot u&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;S_{down} = S \cdot d&lt;/math&gt;; 
*or given that the tree is recombining, directly via &lt;math&gt;S_n = S_0 \times u ^{N_u - N_d}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;N_u&lt;/math&gt; is the number of up ticks and &lt;math&gt;N_d&lt;/math&gt; is the number of down ticks.

2. Construct the corresponding option tree:
*at each final node of the tree—i.e. at expiration of the option—the option value is simply its intrinsic, or exercise, value;
*at earlier nodes,  [[expectation value|value is via expectation]], &lt;math&gt;C_{t-\Delta t,i} = e^{-r \Delta t}(pC_{t,i+1} + (1-p)C_{t,i-1}) \,&lt;/math&gt;, p being the probability of an up move; where [[option style|non-European]] value is the greater of this and the exercise value given the corresponding equity value.
|}
In general the approach is to divide time between now and the option's expiration into ''N'' discrete periods. At the specific time ''n'', the model has a finite number of outcomes at time ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 such that every possible change in the state of the world between ''n'' and ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 is captured in a branch. This process is iterated until every possible path between ''n'' = 0 and ''n'' = ''N'' is mapped. Probabilities are then estimated for every ''n'' to ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 path. The outcomes and probabilities flow backwards through the tree until a fair value of the option today is calculated.

For equity and commodities the application is as follows. The first step is to trace the evolution of the option's key underlying variable(s), starting with today's [[spot price]], such that this [[stochastic process|process]] is consistent with its volatility; [[Log-normal distribution|log-normal]] [[Brownian motion]] with constant volatility is usually assumed.&lt;ref name="Chance"&gt;Chance, Don M. March 2008 [http://www.henley.ac.uk/web/files/rep/binomial_option.pdf ''A Synthesis of Binomial Option Pricing Models for Lognormally Distributed Assets'']. Journal of Applied Finance, Vol. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The next step is to value the option recursively, stepping backwards from the final time-step, and applying risk neutral valuation at each node, where option value is the probability-weighted [[present value]] of the up- and down-nodes in the later time-step. See {{sectionlink|Binomial options pricing model|Method}} for more detail, as well as {{sectionlink|Rational pricing|Risk neutral valuation}} for logic and formulae derivation.

As above, the lattice approach is particularly useful in valuing [[American option]]s, where the choice whether to [[Exercise (options)|exercise the option early]], or to hold the option, may be modeled at each discrete time/price combination; this is true also for [[Bermudan option]]s. For similar reasons, [[Real options valuation#Valuation methods|real options]] and [[Employee stock option#Valuation|employee stock options]] are often modeled using a lattice framework, though with modified assumptions. In each of these cases, a third step is to determine whether the option is to be exercised or held, and to then apply this value at the node in question. Some [[exotic options]], such as [[barrier options]], are also easily modeled here; note though that for other [[Path-Dependent Options]],  [[Monte Carlo methods in finance|simulation]] would be preferred. (Although, tree-based methods have been developed&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Klassen. (2001) [http://www.math.ku.dk/~rolf/KlassenBinomial.pdf Simple, Fast and Flexible Pricing of Asian Options], ''Journal of Computational Finance'', 4 (3) 89-124 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Hull and Alan White. (1993) [http://jod.iijournals.com/content/1/1/21 Efficient procedures for valuing European and American path-dependent options], ''Journal of Derivatives'', Fall, 21-31&lt;/ref&gt;)

The simplest lattice model is the [[binomial options pricing model]];&lt;ref&gt;Ronnie Becker. [http://users.aims.ac.za/~ronnie/NM1&amp;2Notes/Chap8.pdf Pricing in the Binomial Model], [[African Institute for Mathematical Sciences]]&lt;/ref&gt; the standard ("canonical"&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Markus K. Brunnermeier. [http://www.princeton.edu/~markus/teaching/Fin501/10Lecture.pdf Multi-period Model Options], [[Princeton University]].&lt;/ref&gt;) method is that proposed by [[John C. Cox|Cox]], [[Stephen Ross (economist)|Ross]] and [[Mark Rubinstein|Rubinstein]] (CRR) in 1979; see diagram for formulae. Over 20 other methods have been developed,&lt;ref name="Joshi"&gt;Mark s. Joshi (2008). [http://fbe.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/806280/170.pdf The Convergence of Binomial Trees for Pricing the American Put]&lt;/ref&gt; with each "derived under a variety of assumptions" as regards the development of the underlying's price.&lt;ref name="Chance"/&gt; [[Limit (mathematics)|In the limit]], as the number of time-steps increases, these converge to the [[Log-normal distribution]], and hence produce the "same" option price as Black-Scholes: to achieve this, these will variously seek to agree with the underlying's [[central moment]]s, [[raw moment]]s and / or [[Log-normal distribution|log-moments]] at each time-step, [[Variance#Discrete random variable|as measured discretely]]. Further enhancements are designed to achieve stability relative to Black-Scholes as the number of time-steps changes. More recent models, in fact, are designed around direct convergence to Black-Scholes.&lt;ref name="Joshi"/&gt;

A variant on the Binomial, is the [[Trinomial tree]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/groups/finance/WP/rpf292.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/oleg_zaboronski/fm/trinomial_tree_2010_kevin.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; developed by [[Phelim Boyle]] in 1986, where valuation is based on the value of the option at the up-, down- and middle-nodes in the later time-step. The chief conceptual difference here, being that the price may also remain unchanged over the time-step. As for the binomial, a similar (although smaller) range of methods exist. Note that the trinomial model is considered&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoadley.net/options/calculators.htm|title=Option Pricing &amp; Stock Price Probability Calculators - Hoadley|website=www.hoadley.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; to produce more accurate results than the binomial model when fewer time steps are modelled, and is therefore used when computational speed or resources may be an issue. For [[vanilla option]]s, as the number of steps increases, the results rapidly converge, and the binomial model is then preferred due to its simpler implementation. For [[exotic option]]s the trinomial model (or adaptations) is sometimes more stable and accurate, regardless of step-size.

Various of the [[Greeks (finance)|Greeks]] can be estimated directly on the lattice,  [[Finite_difference#Relation_with_derivatives|where the sensitivities are calculated using finite difference]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Don Chance. (2010) [http://www.bus.lsu.edu/academics/finance/faculty/dchance/Instructional/TN05-02.pdf Calculating the Greeks in the Binomial Model].&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Greeks (finance)#Delta|Delta]] and [[Greeks (finance)#Gamma|gamma]], being sensitivities of option value w.r.t. price, are approximated given differences between option prices - with their related spot - in the same time step.  [[Greeks (finance)#Theta|Theta]], sensitivity to time, is likewise estimated given the option price at the first node in the tree and the option price for the same spot in a later time step. (Second time step for trinomial, third for binomial. Note also, that depending on method, if the "down factor" is not the inverse of the "up factor", this method will not be precise.)  For [[Greeks (finance)#Rho|rho]], sensitivity to interest rates, and [[Greeks (finance)#Vega|vega]], sensitivity to input volatility, the measurement is indirect, as the value must be calculated a second time on a new lattice built with these inputs slightly altered - and the sensitivity here is likewise returned via finite difference. See also [[Fugit]] - the estimated time to exercise - which is typically calculated using a lattice.

When it is important to incorporate the [[volatility smile]], or [[Volatility surface|surface]], '''implied trees''' can be constructed. Here, the tree is solved such that it successfully reproduces selected (all) market prices, across various strikes and expirations. These trees thus "ensure that all European standard options (with strikes and maturities coinciding with the tree nodes) will have theoretical values which match their market prices".&lt;ref name="dkc"&gt;Emanuel Derman, Iraj Kani, and Neil Chriss (1996). [http://www.smartquant.com/references/Volatility/vol14.pdf Implied Trinomial Trees of the Volatility Smile]. Goldman Sachs, Quantitative Strategies Research Notes&lt;/ref&gt; Using the calibrated lattice one can then price options with strike / maturity combinations not quoted in the market, such that these prices are consistent with observed volatility patterns.  There exist both [[implied binomial tree]]s, often [[Mark Rubinstein|Rubinstein]] IBTs  (R-IBT),&lt;ref&gt;Mark Rubinstein (1994). [http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/groups/finance/WP/rpf232.pdf Implied Binomial Trees]. ''Journal of Finance''. July, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Implied trinomial tree]]s, often [[Emanuel Derman|Derman]]-Kani-[[Neil Chriss|Chriss]]&lt;ref name="dkc"/&gt; (DKC; superseding the DK-IBT&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmat.edu.uy/~mordecki/hk/derman-kani.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;). The former is easier built, but is consistent with one maturity only; the latter will be consistent with, but at the same time requires, known (or [[interpolated]]) prices at all time-steps and nodes. (DKC is effectively a discretized [[local volatility]] model.)

As regards the construction, for an R-IBT the first step is to recover the "Implied Ending Risk-Neutral Probabilities" of spot prices. Then by the assumption that all paths which lead to the same ending node have the same risk-neutral probability, a "path probability" is attached to each ending node.  Thereafter "it's as simple as One-Two-Three", and a three step backwards recursion allows for the node probabilities to be recovered for each time step. Option valuation then proceeds as standard, with these substituted for ''p''. For DKC, the first step is to recover the [[state price]]s corresponding to each node in the tree, such that these are consistent with observed option prices (i.e. with the volatility surface). Thereafter the up-, down- and middle-probabilities are found for each node such that: these sum to 1; spot prices adjacent time-step-wise evolve risk neutrally, incorporating [[dividend yield]]; state prices similarly "grow" at the risk free rate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://db.riskwaters.com/data/energyrisk/EnergyRisk/Energyrisk_0808/MasterclassER0408.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; (The solution here is iterative per time step as opposed to simultaneous.)  As for R-IBTs, option valuation is then by standard backward recursion.

As an alternative, '''Edgeworth binomial trees'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/groups/finance/WP/rpf275.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; allow for an analyst-specified [[Skewness|skew]] and [[kurtosis]] in spot price returns; see [[Edgeworth series]].  This approach is useful when the underlying's behavior departs (markedly) from normality. A related use is to calibrate the tree to the volatility smile (or surface), by a "judicious choice"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471499226.html|title=Wiley: Advanced Modelling in Finance using Excel and VBA - Mary Jackson, Mike Staunton|website=eu.wiley.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; of parameter values—priced here, options with differing strikes will return differing implied volatilities. For pricing American options, an [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth|Edgeworth]]-generated ending distribution may be combined with an R-IBT. Note that this approach is limited as to the set of skewness and kurtosis pairs for which valid distributions are available. One recent proposal, [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14697680902950821?journalCode=rquf20#.VGWuy_mUfT8 Johnson binomial trees], is to use [[Norman Lloyd Johnson|N. L. Johnson]]'s system of distributions, as this is capable of accommodating all possible pairs; see [[Johnson SU distribution]].

For multiple [[Underlying|underlyers]], multinomial lattices&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.in-the-money.com/artandpap/Rainbow%2BOptions.doc |author=Mark Rubinstein |title=Rainbow Options |date=January 15, 1995 |publisher= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622150346/http://www.in-the-money.com/artandpap/Rainbow%20Options.doc |archivedate=22 June 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; can be built, although the number of nodes increases exponentially with the number of underlyers. As an alternative, [[Basket option]]s, for example, can be priced using an "approximating distribution"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nag.com/about/student_awards/thesis_iehrlich.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; via an Edgeworth (or Johnson) tree.

|'''Tree-based bond option valuation:'''
0. Construct an interest-rate tree, which, as described in the text, will be consistent with the current term structure of interest rates.

1. Construct a corresponding tree of bond-prices, where the [[underlying]] bond is valued at each node by "backwards induction": 
*at its final nodes, bond value is simply [[face value]] (or $1), plus coupon (in cents) if relevant; if the bond-date and tree-date do not coincide, these are then discounted to the start of the time-step using the node-specific short-rate;
*at each earlier node, it is the [[present value|discounted]] [[expected value]] of nodes in the later time step, plus coupon payments during the current time step, similarly discounted to the start of the time-step.

2. Construct a corresponding bond-option tree, where the option on the bond is valued similarly:
*at option maturity, value is based on [[moneyness]] for all nodes in that time-step;
*at earlier nodes, value is a function of the expected value of the option at the nodes in the later time step, discounted at the short-rate of the current node; where [[option style|non-European]] value is the greater of this and the exercise value given the corresponding bond value.
|}

Lattices are commonly used in valuing [[Bond option#Valuation|bond options]], [[Swaption#Valuation|Swaptions]], and other [[interest rate derivatives]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/~mh2078/LatticeModelsFE1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://simonbenninga.com/wiener/MiER73.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  In these cases the valuation is largely as above, but requires an additional, zeroeth, step of constructing an interest rate tree, on which the price of the underlying is then based. Note that the next step also differs: the underlying' price here is built via "backward induction" i.e. flows backwards from maturity, accumulating the present value of scheduled cash flows at each node, as opposed to flowing forwards from valuation date as above. The final step, option valuation, then proceeds as standard. See aside.

The initial lattice is built by discretizing either a [[short-rate model]], such as [[Hull-White]] or [[Black Derman Toy]], or a [[forward rate]]-based model, such as the [[LIBOR market model]] or [[Heath–Jarrow–Morton framework|HJM]].  As for equity, trinomial trees may also be employed for these models;&lt;ref&gt;[http://simonbenninga.com/wiener/leippold-wiener2003.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; this is usually the case for Hull-White trees.

Under HJM,&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160304073048/http://rendleman.com/ARNAVSHETH/CHAP11.pdf Pricing Interest Rate-dependent Financial Claims with Option Features], Ch 11. in Rendleman (2002), per Bibliography.&lt;/ref&gt;  the [[rational pricing|condition of no arbitrage]] implies that there exists a [[Risk-neutral measure|martingale probability measure]], as well as a corresponding restriction on the "drift coefficients" of the forward rates.  These, in turn, are functions of the volatility(s) of the forward rates.&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Don Chance, [[Louisiana State University]]. [http://www.bus.lsu.edu/academics/finance/faculty/dchance/Instructional/TN02-01.pdf The Heath-Jarrow-Morton Term Structure Model]&lt;/ref&gt;  A "simple" discretized expression&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.iijournals.com/doi/abs/10.3905/jfi.1999.319247#sthash.5R3a6VDr.dpbs|title=Implementing No-Arbitrage Term Structure of Interest Rate Models in Discrete Time When Interest Rates Are Normally Distributed|journal=The Journal of Fixed Income|volume=8|issue=4|pages=85–98|first1=Dwight M.|last1=Grant|first2=Gautam|last2=Vora|date=26 February 2009|doi=10.3905/jfi.1999.319247}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the drift then allows for forward rates to be expressed in a binomial lattice.  Note that for these forward rate-based models, dependent on volatility assumptions, the lattice might not recombine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6NPuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=recombine|title=Rubinstein on Derivatives|first=Mark|last=Rubinstein|date=1 January 1999|publisher=Risk Books|via=Google Books|isbn=9781899332533}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt; This means that an "up-move" followed by a "down-move" will not give the same result as a "down-move" followed by an "up-move". In this case, the Lattice is sometimes referred to as a "bush", and the number of nodes grows exponentially as a function of number of time-steps. A recombining binomial tree methodology is also available for the Libor Market Model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rstapleton.com/papers/lmm.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

As regards the short-rate models, these are, in turn, further categorized: these will be either [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium-based]] ([[Vasicek model|Vasicek]] and [[Cox–Ingersoll–Ross model|CIR]]) or [[Rational pricing#Fixed income securities|arbitrage-free]] ([[Ho–Lee model|Ho–Lee]] and [[Short-rate model#One-factor short-rate models|subsequent]]). This distinction means that for equilibrium-based models the [[yield curve]] is an ''output'' from the model, while for arbitrage-free models the yield curve is an ''input'' to the model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finanzaonline.com/forum/attachments/econometria-e-modelli-di-trading-operativo/1570826d1332880630-lezioni-di-econometria-interest-rate-derivatives-lecture-notes.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  
In the former case, the approach is to "calibrate" the model parameters, such that bond prices produced by the model, in its continuous form, [[best fit]] observed market prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sitmo.com/article/calibrating-the-ornstein-uhlenbeck-model/|title=sitmo -|website=www.sitmo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tree is then built as a function of these parameters.
In the latter case, the calibration is directly on the lattice:  the fit is to both the current term structure of interest rates (i.e. the [[yield curve]]), and the corresponding [[Volatility (finance)#Volatility terminology|volatility structure]].  Here, calibration means that the interest-rate-tree reproduces the prices of the [[zero-coupon bond]]s—and any other interest-rate sensitive securities—used in [[Yield curve construction|constructing the yield curve]]; note the parallel to implied trees above, and compare [[Bootstrapping (finance)]].  For models assuming a [[normal distribution]] (such as Ho-Lee), calibration may be performed analytically, while for [[log-normal]] models the calibration is via a [[root-finding algorithm]]; see boxed-description under [[Black–Derman–Toy model]].

The volatility structure—i.e. vertical node-spacing—here reflects the volatility of rates during the quarter, or other period, corresponding to the lattice time-step. (Some analysts use "[[Volatility (finance)#Volatility terminology|realized volatility]]", i.e. of the rates applicable ''historically'' for the time-step; others prefer to use ''current'' [[interest rate cap]] prices, and the [[implied volatility]] for the [[Black-76]]-prices of each component [[Interest rate cap and floor#Interest rate cap|caplet]]; see [[Interest rate cap#Implied Volatilities]].)  Given this functional link to volatility, note the resultant difference in the construction relative to implied trees above: here, the volatility is known for each time-step, and the node-values (i.e. interest rates) must be solved for specified risk neutral probabilities; for implied trees, on the other hand, a single volatility cannot be specified per time-step, i.e. we have a "smile", and the tree is built by solving for the probabilities corresponding to specified values of the underlying at each node.

Once calibrated, the interest rate lattice is then used in the valuation of various of the fixed income instruments and derivatives.&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt; The approach for bond options is described aside—note that this approach addresses the problem of [[pull to par]] experienced under closed form approaches; see {{sectionlink|Black–Scholes model|Valuing bond options}}. For swaptions the logic is almost identical, substituting [[swap (finance)|swaps]] for bonds in step 1, and swaptions for bond options in step 2.  For caps (and floors) step 1 and 2 are combined: at each node the value is based on the relevant nodes at the later step, plus, for any caplet ([[Interest rate cap and floor#Interest rate floor|floorlet]]) maturing in the time-step, the difference between its reference-rate and the short-rate at the node (and reflecting the corresponding [[day count fraction]] and notional-value exchanged). For [[callable bond|callable-]] and [[putable bond]]s a third step would be required: at each node in the time-step incorporate the effect of the [[embedded option]] on the bond price and / or the option price there before stepping-backwards one time-step. (And noting that these options are not mutually exclusive, and so a bond may have several options embedded;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/embedded+option|title=embedded option|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; hybrid securities are treated below.) For other, [[Interest rate derivative#Exotic derivatives|more exotic interest rate derivatives]], similar adjustments are made to steps 1 and onward. For the "Greeks"  see under next section.

An alternative approach to modeling (American) bond options, particularly those [[strike price|struck]] on [[yield to maturity]] (YTM), employs modified equity-lattice methods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riskworx.com/insights/abo/abo.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Here the analyst builds a CRR tree of YTM, applying a constant volatility assumption, and then [[Bond valuation#Present value approach|calculates the bond price as a function of this yield]] at each node; prices here are thus pulling-to-par. The second step is to then incorporate any [[Forward volatility|term structure of volatility]] by building a corresponding DKC tree (based on every second time-step in the CRR tree: as DKC is trinomial whereas CRR is binomial) and then using this for option valuation.

Since the [[2007–2012 global financial crisis]], [[Swap (finance)#Valuation|swap pricing]] is (generally) under a "multi-curve" framework, whereas previously it was off a single, "self discounting", curve; see {{sectionlink|Interest rate swap|Valuation and pricing}}. Here, payoffs are set as a function of [[LIBOR]] specific to the [[Tenor (finance)|tenor]] in question, while discounting is at the [[Overnight indexed swap|OIS rate]]. To accommodate this in the lattice framework, the OIS rate and the relevant LIBOR rate are jointly modeled in a three-dimensional tree, constructed such that LIBOR swap rates are matched.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull/downloadablepublications/MulticurveModeling.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hybrid securities==
[[Hybrid security|Hybrid securities]], incorporating both equity- and bond-like features are also valued using trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fincad.com/derivatives-resources/articles/pricing-convertible-bonds.aspx|title=Pricing Convertible Bonds|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[convertible bonds]] (CBs) the approach of Tsiveriotis and Fernandes (1998)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.nyu.edu/~lw429/ms_project/cb3.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; is to divide the value of the bond at each node into an "equity" component, arising from situations where the CB will be converted, and a "debt" component, arising from situations where CB is redeemed. Correspondingly, twin trees are constructed where discounting is at the risk free and credit risk adjusted rate respectively, with the sum being the value of the CB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mngt.waikato.ac.nz/kurt/frontpage/ModelsAcademic/Model%20Detail%20Descriptions/Description%20Convertible%20Tree%20Model%20w%20Credit%20Risk.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321062119/http://www.mngt.waikato.ac.nz/kurt/frontpage/ModelsAcademic/Model%20Detail%20Descriptions/Description%20Convertible%20Tree%20Model%20w%20Credit%20Risk.htm |archivedate=2012-03-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are other methods, which similarly combine an equity-type tree with a short-rate tree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rmr.lixin.edu.cn/files/100134/1110/109_19371597786.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;   An alternate approach, originally published by [[Goldman Sachs]] (1994),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emanuelderman.com/media/gs-valuing_convertibles.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; does not decouple the components, rather, discounting is at a conversion-probability-weighted risk-free and risky interest rate within a single tree. See {{sectionlink|Convertible bond|Valuation}}, [[Contingent convertible bond]].

Additional to the calculation of "Greeks" as for equity, lattices can be used here to estimate sensitivities related to overall changes in interest rates. For a bond with an [[embedded option]], the standard [[yield to maturity]] based calculations of [[Bond duration|duration]] and [[Bond convexity|convexity]] do not consider how changes in interest rates will alter the cash flows due to option exercise. To address this, [[Bond duration #Embedded options and effective duration | "effective" duration]] and [[Bond convexity #Effective convexity |-convexity]] are introduced. Here, similar to rho and vega above, the interest rate tree is rebuilt for an upward and then downward [[parallel shift]] in the yield curve and these measures are calculated numerically given the corresponding changes in bond value.&lt;ref&gt;See Fabozzi under Bibliography.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar calculations can be applied to interest rate derivatives above, as regards Greeks and duration.

More generally, [[Equity (finance)|equity]] can be viewed as a [[call option]] on the firm:&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/Seminars/AIMR3.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; where the value of the firm is less than the value of the outstanding debt shareholders would choose not to repay the firm's debt; they would choose to repay—and not to [[liquidate]] (i.e. [[Exercise (options)|exercise their option]])—otherwise. Lattice models have been developed for equity analysis here,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grantthornton.com/staticfiles/GTCom/Calendar%20of%20Events/Archived%20webcasts/2013%20Archived%20webcast%20slides/June%2012%20Valuation%20Considerations%20PPT%20Final.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709123757/http://www.grantthornton.com/staticfiles/GTCom/Calendar%20of%20Events/Archived%20webcasts/2013%20Archived%20webcast%20slides/June%2012%20Valuation%20Considerations%20PPT%20Final.pdf |archivedate=2015-07-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bvresources.com/pdfs/WB081513/BVR+-+Lattice+Models.pdf|title=Not Found - Business Valuation Resources|website=www.bvresources.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly as relates to [[Distressed securities|distressed firms]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/eqnotes/optequity.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;   Relatedly,  as regards corporate debt pricing, the relationship between equity holders' [[limited liability]] and potential [[Chapter 11]] proceedings has also been modelled via lattice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/~mnb2/broadie/Assets/JFQA-422-Broadie-Kaya-Proofs.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3977">In [[graph theory]], a branch of mathematics, the '''linear arboricity''' of an [[undirected graph]] is the smallest number of [[linear forest]]s its edges can be partitioned into. Here, a linear forest is an acyclic graph with maximum [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] two, i.e., a [[disjoint union]] of [[path graph]]s.

{{unsolved|mathematics|Does every graph of maximum degree &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; have linear arboricity at most &lt;math&gt;\lceil(\Delta+1)/2\rceil&lt;/math&gt;?}}
The linear arboricity of a graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; with maximum degree &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is always at least &lt;math&gt;\lceil\Delta/2\rceil&lt;/math&gt;, because each linear forest can use only two of the edges at a maximum-degree vertex. The '''linear arboricity conjecture''' of {{harvtxt|Akiyama|Exoo|Harary|1981}} is that this [[lower bound]] is also tight: according to their conjecture, every graph has linear arboricity at most &lt;math&gt;\lceil(\Delta+1)/2\rceil&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

&lt;math&gt;\Delta/2 + O(\Delta^{2/3 - c})&lt;/math&gt; for some constant &lt;math&gt; c&gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; due to Ferber, Fox and Jain.&lt;ref name="ffj"&gt;{{citation

In a [[regular graph]], the linear arboricity cannot equal &lt;math&gt;\Delta/2&lt;/math&gt; because the endpoints of each path in one of the linear forests would not have two adjacent edges used by that forest. Therefore, for regular graphs, the linear arboricity conjecture implies that the linear arboricity is exactly &lt;math&gt;\lceil(\Delta+1)/2\rceil&lt;/math&gt;.

Linear arboricity is a variation of [[arboricity]], the minimum number of forests that the edges of a graph can be partitioned into. Researchers have also studied linear {{mvar|k}}-arboricity, a variant of linear arboricity in which each path in the linear forest can have at most {{mvar|k}} edges.&lt;ref name="atw"&gt;{{citation

In mathematics, the '''relaxation''' of a [[Mixed integer linear programming|(mixed) integer linear program]] is the problem that arises by removing the integrality constraint of each variable.

For example, in a [[0-1 integer program]], all constraints are of the form

:&lt;math&gt;x_i\in\{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;.

The relaxation of the original integer program instead uses a collection of linear constraints
:&lt;math&gt;0 \le x_i \le 1.&lt;/math&gt;

The resulting relaxation is a [[linear program]], hence the name. This [[Relaxation technique (mathematics)|relaxation technique]] transforms an [[NP-hard]] optimization problem (integer programming) into a related problem that is solvable in [[polynomial time]] (linear programming); the solution to the relaxed linear program can be used to gain information about the solution to the original integer program.

==Example==
Consider the [[set cover problem]], the linear programming relaxation of which was first considered by {{harvtxt|Lovász|1975}}. In this problem, one is given as input a family of [[set (mathematics)|set]]s ''F'' = {''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ...}; the task is to find a subfamily, with as few sets as possible, having the same [[union (set theory)|union]] as ''F''.

To formulate this as a 0-1 integer program, form an [[indicator variable]] ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' for each set ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', that takes the value 1 when ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' belongs to the chosen subfamily and 0 when it does not. Then a valid cover can be described by an assignment of values to the indicator variables satisfying the constraints
:&lt;math&gt;\textstyle x_i\in\{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;
(that is, only the specified indicator variable values are allowed) and, for each element ''e&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the union of ''F'',
:&lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{\{i\mid e_j\in S_i\}} x_i \ge 1&lt;/math&gt;
(that is, each element is covered). The minimum set cover corresponds to the assignment of indicator variables satisfying these constraints and minimizing the linear objective function
:&lt;math&gt;\textstyle \min \sum_i x_i.&lt;/math&gt;
The linear programming relaxation of the set cover problem describes a ''fractional cover'' in which the input sets are assigned weights such that the total weight of the sets containing each element is at least one and the total weight of all sets is minimized.

As a specific example of the set cover problem, consider the instance ''F'' = {{''a'', ''b''}, {''b'', ''c''}, {''a'', ''c''}}. There are three optimal set covers, each of which includes two of the three given sets. Thus, the optimal value of the objective function of the corresponding 0-1 integer program is 2, the number of sets in the optimal covers. However, there is a fractional solution in which each set is assigned the weight 1/2, and for which the total value of the objective function is 3/2. Thus, in this example, the linear programming relaxation has a value differing from that of the unrelaxed 0-1 integer program.

==Solution quality of relaxed and original programs==
The linear programming relaxation of an integer program may be solved using any standard linear programming technique. If the optimal solution to the linear program happens to have all variables either 0 or 1, it will also be an optimal solution to the original integer program. However, this is generally not true, except for some special cases (e.g., 
problems with [[totally unimodular]] matrix specifications.)

In all cases, though, the solution quality of the linear program is at least as good as that of the integer program, because any integer program solution would also be a valid linear program solution. That is, in a maximization problem, the relaxed program has a value greater than or equal to that of the original program, while in a minimization problem such as the set cover problem the relaxed program has a value smaller than or equal to that of the original program. Thus, the relaxation provides an optimistic bound on the integer program's solution.

In the example instance of the set cover problem described above, in which the relaxation has an optimal solution value of 3/2, we can deduce that the optimal solution value of the unrelaxed integer program is at least as large. Since the set cover problem has solution values that are integers (the numbers of sets chosen in the subfamily), the optimal solution quality must be at least as large as the next larger integer, 2. Thus, in this instance, despite having a different value from the unrelaxed problem, the linear programming relaxation gives us a tight lower bound on the solution quality of the original problem.

==Approximation and integrality gap==

&lt;!-- this section is linked to from [[Randomized_rounding]], please update that link there if you change the section title here --nealeyoung May 31, 2010 --&gt;

Linear programming relaxation is a standard technique for designing [[approximation algorithm]]s for hard optimization problems. In this application, an important concept is the '''integrality gap''', the maximum ratio between the solution quality of the integer program and of its relaxation. In an instance of a minimization problem, if the real minimum (the minimum of the integer problem) is &lt;math&gt;M_{int}&lt;/math&gt;, and the relaxed minimum (the minimum of the linear programming relaxation) is &lt;math&gt;M_{frac}&lt;/math&gt;, then the integrality gap of that instance is &lt;math&gt;IG=\frac{M_{int}}{M_{frac}}&lt;/math&gt;. In a maximization problem the fraction is reversed. The integrality gap is always at least 1. In [[#Example|the example above]], the instance ''F'' = {{''a'', ''b''}, {''b'', ''c''}, {''a'', ''c''}} shows an integrality gap of 4/3.

Typically, the integrality gap translates into the [[approximation ratio]] of an approximation algorithm. This is because an approximation algorithm relies on some rounding strategy that finds, for every relaxed solution of size &lt;math&gt;M_{frac}&lt;/math&gt;, an integer solution of size at most &lt;math&gt;RR\cdot M_{frac}&lt;/math&gt; (where ''RR'' is the rounding ratio). If there is an instance with integrality gap ''IG'', then ''every'' rounding strategy will return, on that instance, a rounded solution of size at least &lt;math&gt;M_{int} = IG\cdot M_{frac}&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore necessarily &lt;math&gt;RR \geq IG&lt;/math&gt;. The rounding ratio ''RR'' is only an upper bound on the approximation ratio, so in theory the actual approximation ratio may be lower than ''IG'', but this may be hard to prove. In practice, a large ''IG'' usually implies that the approximation ratio in the linear programming relaxation might be bad, and it may be better to look for other approximation schemes for that problem.

For the set cover problem, Lovász proved that the integrality gap for an instance with ''n'' elements is ''H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', the ''n''th [[harmonic number]]. One can turn the linear programming relaxation for this problem into an approximate solution of the original unrelaxed set cover instance via the technique of [[randomized rounding]] {{harv|Raghavan|Tompson|1987}}. Given a fractional cover, in which each set ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' has weight ''w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', choose randomly the value of each 0-1 indicator variable ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' to be 1 with probability ''w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;(ln&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;+1), and 0 otherwise. Then any element ''e&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' has probability less than 1/(''e''&amp;times;''n'') of remaining uncovered, so with constant probability all elements are covered. The cover generated by this technique has total size, with high probability, (1+o(1))(ln&amp;nbsp;''n'')''W'', where ''W'' is the total weight of the fractional solution. Thus, this technique leads to a [[Randomized algorithm|randomized]] approximation algorithm that finds a set cover within a logarithmic factor of the optimum. As {{harvtxt|Young|1995}} showed, both the random part of this algorithm and the need to construct an explicit solution to the linear programming relaxation may be eliminated using the [[method of conditional probabilities]], leading to a deterministic [[greedy algorithm]] for set cover, known already to Lovász, that repeatedly selects the set that covers the largest possible number of remaining uncovered elements. This greedy algorithm approximates the set cover to within the same ''H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' factor that Lovász proved as the integrality gap for set cover. There are strong complexity-theoretic reasons for believing that no polynomial time approximation algorithm can achieve a significantly better approximation ratio {{harv|Feige|1998}}.

Similar [[randomized rounding]] techniques, and derandomized approximation algorithms, may be used in conjunction with linear programming relaxation to develop approximation algorithms for many other problems, as described by Raghavan, Tompson, and Young.

==Branch and bound for exact solutions==
As well as its uses in approximation, linear programming plays an important role in [[branch and bound]] algorithms for computing the true optimum solution to hard optimization problems.

If some variables in the optimal solution have fractional values, we may start a [[branch and bound]] type process, in which we recursively solve subproblems in which some of the fractional variables have their values fixed to either zero or one. In each step of an algorithm of this type, we consider a subproblem of the original 0-1 integer program in which some of the variables have values assigned to them, either 0 or 1, and the remaining variables are still free to take on either value. In subproblem ''i'', let ''V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' denote the set of remaining variables. The process begins by considering a subproblem in which no variable values have been assigned, and in which ''V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the whole set of variables of the original problem. Then, for each subproblem ''i'', it performs the following steps.
# Compute the optimal solution to the linear programming relaxation of the current subproblem. That is, for each variable ''x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' in ''V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', we replace the constraint that ''x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' be 0 or 1 by the relaxed constraint that it be in the interval [0,1]; however, variables that have already been assigned values are not relaxed.
# If the current subproblem's relaxed solution is worse than the best integer solution found so far, backtrack from this branch of the recursive search.
# If the relaxed solution has all variables set to 0 or 1, test it against the best integer solution found so far and keep whichever of the two solutions is best.
# Otherwise, let ''x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' be any variable that is set to a fractional value in the relaxed solution. Form two subproblems, one in which ''x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' is set to 0 and the other in which ''x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' is set to 1; in both subproblems, the existing assignments of values to some of the variables are still used, so the set of remaining variables becomes ''V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;{''x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}. Recursively search both subproblems.

Although it is difficult to prove theoretical bounds on the performance of algorithms of this type, they can be very effective in practice.

==Cutting plane method==
Two 0-1 integer programs that are equivalent, in that they have the same objective function and the same set of feasible solutions, may have quite different linear programming relaxations: a linear programming relaxation can be viewed geometrically, as a [[convex polytope]] that includes all feasible solutions and excludes all other 0-1 vectors, and infinitely many different polytopes have this property. Ideally, one would like to use as a relaxation the [[convex hull]] of the feasible solutions; linear programming on this polytope would automatically yield the correct solution to the original integer program. However, in general, this polytope will have exponentially many [[Facet (mathematics)|facet]]s and be difficult to construct. Typical relaxations, such as the relaxation of the set cover problem discussed earlier, form a polytope that strictly contains the convex hull and has vertices other than the 0-1 vectors that solve the unrelaxed problem.

The [[cutting-plane method]] for solving 0-1 integer programs, first introduced for the [[traveling salesman problem]] by {{harvtxt|Dantzig|Fulkerson|Johnson|1954}} and generalized to other integer programs by {{harvtxt|Gomory|1958}}, takes advantage of this multiplicity of possible relaxations by finding a sequence of relaxations that more tightly constrain the solution space until eventually an integer solution is obtained. This method starts from any relaxation of the given program, and finds an optimal solution using a linear programming solver. If the solution assigns integer values to all variables, it is also the optimal solution to the unrelaxed problem. Otherwise, an additional linear constraint (a ''cutting plane'' or ''cut'') is found that separates the resulting fractional solution from the convex hull of the integer solutions, and the method repeats on this new more tightly constrained problem.

Problem-specific methods are needed to find the cuts used by this method. It is especially desirable to find cutting planes that form facets of the convex hull of the integer solutions, as these planes are the ones that most tightly constrain the solution space; there always exists a cutting plane of this type that separates any fractional solution from the integer solutions. Much research has been performed on methods for finding these facets for different types of combinatorial optimization problems, under the framework of [[polyhedral combinatorics]] {{harv|Aardal|Weismantel|1997}}.

The related [[branch and cut]] method combines the cutting plane and branch and bound methods. In any subproblem, it runs the cutting plane method until no more cutting planes can be found, and then branches on one of the remaining fractional variables.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6226">In [[mathematical logic]], '''minimal axioms for Boolean algebra''' are assumptions which are equivalent to the axioms of [[Boolean algebra]] (or [[propositional calculus]]), chosen to be as short as possible. For example, an axiom with six [[Logical NAND|NAND]] operations and three variables is equivalent to Boolean algebra:

: &lt;math&gt;((a\mid b)\mid c) \mid (a\mid((a\mid c)\mid a)) = c&lt;/math&gt;

where the vertical bar represents the NAND logical operation (also known as the [[Sheffer stroke]]).

[[Stephen Wolfram]], and separately, a group of researchers including [[William McCune]], [[Branden Fitelson]], and [[Larry Wos]], identified this axiom by testing 25 candidate axioms, the set of Sheffer identities of length less or equal to 15 elements (excluding mirror images) that have no noncommutative models with four or fewer variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wolfram |first1=Stephen |authorlink=Stephen Wolfram |title=[[A New Kind of Science]] |date=2002 |publisher=Wolfram Media |isbn=978-1579550080 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mccune&gt;{{citation

In 1933, [[Edward Vermilye Huntington]] identified the axiom
:&lt;math&gt;{\neg({\neg x} \lor {y})} \lor {\neg({\neg x} \lor {\neg y})} = x&lt;/math&gt;
as being equivalent to Boolean algebra, when combined with the commutativity of the [[Logical OR|OR]] operation, &lt;math&gt;x \lor y = y \lor x&lt;/math&gt;, and the assumption of associativity, &lt;math&gt;(x \lor y) \lor z = x \lor (y \lor z)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huntington |first=E.

:&lt;math&gt;\neg(\neg(x \lor y) \lor \neg(x \lor {\neg y})) = x,&lt;/math&gt;
which requires one fewer use of the logical negation operator &lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt;. Neither Robbins nor Huntington could prove this conjecture; nor could [[Alfred Tarski]], who took considerable interest in it later. The conjecture was eventually proved in 1996 with the aid of [[automated theorem proving|theorem-proving software]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Henkin |first1=Leon |authorlink1=Leon Henkin |last2=Monk |first2=J.

The existence of a 2-basis was established in 1967 by [[Carew Arthur Meredith]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meredith |first1=C. A. |authorlink1=Carew Arthur Meredith |last2=Prior |first2=A. N. |authorlink2=Arthur Prior |title=Equational logic |journal=[[Notre Dame J. Formal Logic]] |year=1968 |volume=9 |pages=212–226 |doi=10.1305/ndjfl/1093893457 |mr=0246753}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\neg({\neg x} \lor y) \lor x = x,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\neg({\neg x} \lor {\neg y}) \lor (z \lor y) = y \lor (z \lor x).&lt;/math&gt;
The following year, Meredith found a 2-basis in terms of the Sheffer stroke:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meredith |first=C. A. |authorlink1=Carew Arthur Meredith |title=Equational postulates for the Sheffer stroke |journal=[[Notre Dame J. Formal Logic]] |volume=10 |year=1969 |pages=266–270 |doi=10.1305/ndjfl/1093893713 |mr=0245423}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(x\mid x) \mid (y\mid x) = x,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x|(y\mid(x\mid z)) = ((z\mid y)\mid y)\mid x.&lt;/math&gt;

In 1973, Padmanabhan and Quackenbush demonstrated a method that, in principle, would yield a 1-basis for Boolean algebra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Padmanabhan |first1=R. |last2=Quackenbush |first2=R. W. |title=Equational theories of algebras with distributive congruences |journal=[[Proc. Amer. Math.

This search yielded the 1-basis in terms of the Sheffer stroke given above, as well as the 1-basis
:&lt;math&gt;\neg(\neg(\neg(x \lor y) \lor z) \lor \neg(x \lor \neg(\neg z \lor \neg(z \lor u)))) = z,&lt;/math&gt;
which is written in terms of OR and NOT.&lt;ref name=mccune /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2130">In mathematical [[representation theory]], a '''minuscule representation''' of a [[semisimple Lie algebra]] or group is an [[irreducible representation]] such that the [[Weyl group]] acts transitively on the weights. Some authors exclude the trivial representation. A '''quasi-minuscule representation''' (also called a '''basic representation''') is an irreducible representation such that all non-zero weights are in the same orbit under the Weyl group; each simple Lie algebra has a unique quasi-minuscule representation that is not minuscule, and the multiplicity of the zero weight is the number of short nodes of the Dynkin diagram.

The minuscule representations are indexed by the [[weight lattice]] modulo the [[root lattice]], or equivalently by irreducible representations of the center of the simply connected compact group. For the simple Lie algebras, the dimensions of the minuscule representations are given as follows.

*A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;  ({{su|p=''n''+1|b=''k''|a=c}}) for 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''n'' (exterior powers of vector representation).  Quasi-minuscule: ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+2''n'' (adjoint)
*B&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; 1 (trivial),  2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; (spin). Quasi-minuscule: 2''n''+1 (vector)
*C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;  1 (trivial),  2''n'' (vector). Quasi-minuscule: 2''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;–''n''–1 if ''n''&gt;1
*D&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; 1 (trivial),  2''n'' (vector),  2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; (half spin),  2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; (half spin). Quasi-minuscule: 2''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;–''n'' (adjoint)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4276">In [[network science]], [[preferential attachment]] means that nodes of a network tend to connect to those nodes which have more links. If the network is growing and new nodes tend to connect to existing ones with linear probability in the degree of the existing nodes then preferential attachment leads to a [[scale-free network]]. If this probability is sub-linear then the network’s degree distribution is [[stretched exponential distribution|stretched exponential]] and hubs are much smaller than in a [[scale-free network]]. If this probability is super-linear then almost all nodes are connected to a few hubs. According to Kunegis, Blattner, and Moser several online networks follow a '''non-linear preferential attachment''' model. Communication networks and online contact networks are sub-linear while interaction networks are super-linear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kunegis, Jérôme|author2=Blattner, Marcel|author3=Moser, Christine|title=Preferential Attachment in Online Networks: Measurement and Explanations|date=2013|arxiv=1303.6271|bibcode=2013arXiv1303.6271K}}&lt;/ref&gt; The co-author network among scientists also shows the signs of sub-linear preferential attachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barabási|first1=Albert-László|title=Network Science|pages=19|url=http://barabasi.com/networksciencebook/|chapter= Ch. 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of preferential attachment ==

For simplicity it can be assumed that the probability with which a new node connects to an existing one follows a power function of the existing nodes’ degree&amp;nbsp;''k'':

: &lt;math&gt; \pi(k) \sim k^\alpha \, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''α''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0. This is a good approximation for a lot of real networks such as the Internet, the citation network or the actor network. If ''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 then the preferential attachment is linear. If ''α''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1 then it is sub-linear while if ''α''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1 then it is super-linear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barabási|first1=Albert-László|title=Network Science|pages=20–21|url=http://barabasi.com/networksciencebook/|chapter= Ch. 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In measuring preferential attachment from real networks, the above log-linearity functional form ''k''&lt;sup&gt;''α''&lt;/sup&gt; can be relaxed to a free form function, i.e. {{pi}}(''k'') can be measured for each ''k'' without any assumptions on the functional form of {{pi}}(''k''). This is believed to be more flexible, and allows the discovery of non-log-linearity of preferential attachment in real networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pham|first1=Thong|last2=Sheridan|first2=Paul|last3=Shimodaira|first3=Hidetoshi|title=PAFit: A Statistical Method for Measuring Preferential Attachment in Temporal Complex Networks|journal=PLoS ONE|date=September 17, 2015|volume=10 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0137796|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0137796|pages=e0137796|pmid=26378457|pmc=4574777|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1037796P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sub-linear preferential attachment  ==

In this case the new nodes still tend to connect to the nodes with higher degree but this effect is smaller than in the case of linear preferential attachment. There are less hubs and their size is also smaller than in a scale-free network. The size of the largest component logarithmically depends on the number of nodes:

: &lt;math&gt; k_{\max} \sim (\log n)^{1/(1-\alpha)} &lt;/math&gt;

so it is smaller than the polynomial dependence.&lt;ref name="Connectivity of Growing Random Networks"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krapivsky|first1=P. L.|author2=S. Redner|author3=F. Leyvraz|title=Connectivity of Growing Random Networks|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett.|date=2000|volume=85|pages=4629–4632|arxiv=cond-mat/0005139|doi=10.1103/physrevlett.85.4629|bibcode=2000PhRvL..85.4629K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Super-linear preferential attachment  ==

If ''α''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1 then a few nodes tend to connect to every other node in the network. For ''α''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2 this process happens more extremely, the number of connections between other nodes is still finite in the limit when ''n'' goes to infinity. So the degree of the largest hub is proportional to the system size:&lt;ref name="Connectivity of Growing Random Networks"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; k_{\max} \sim n. \, &lt;/math&gt;

'''Paolo Uccello''' ({{IPA-it|ˈpaːolo utˈtʃɛllo}}; 1397 – 10 December 1475), born '''Paolo di Dono''', was an [[Italy|Italian]] painter and mathematician who was notable for his pioneering work on visual [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] in art. In his book ''[[Lives of the Artists]]'' [[Giorgio Vasari]] wrote that Uccello was obsessed by his interest in perspective and would stay up all night in his study trying to grasp the exact vanishing point. While his contemporaries used perspective to narrate different or succeeding stories, Uccello used perspective to create a feeling of depth in his paintings. His best known works are the [[The Battle of San Romano|three paintings]] representing the [[battle of San Romano]], which were wrongly entitled the "Battle of Sant' Egidio of 1416" for a long period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=Uccello|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paolo worked in the [[International Gothic|Late Gothic]] tradition, emphasizing colour and pageantry rather than the classical realism that other artists were pioneering. His style is best described as idiosyncratic, and he left no school of followers. He has had some influence on twentieth-century art and literary criticism (e.g., in the "[[Vies imaginaires]]" by [[Marcel Schwob]], "Uccello le poil" by [[Antonin Artaud]] and "O Mundo Como Ideia" by [[Bruno Tolentino]]).

==Early life and training==
The sources for Paolo Uccello’s life are few: [[Giorgio Vasari]]’s biography, written 75 years after Paolo’s death, and a few contemporary official documents. Due to the lack of sources, even his date of birth is questionable. It is believed that Uccello was born in [[Pratovecchio]] in 1397,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Private Life of a Masterpiece]]'', BBC TV&lt;/ref&gt; and his tax declarations for some years indicate that he was born in 1397, but in 1446 he claimed to be born in 1396.&lt;ref&gt;Borsi, Franco &amp; Stefano. ''Paolo Uccello''. pp. 15, 34. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;  His father, Dono di Paolo, was a [[barber|barber-surgeon]] from [[Pratovecchio]] near Arezzo; his mother, Antonia, was a high-born Florentine. His nickname ''[[:wiktionary:uccello|Uccello]]'' came from his fondness for painting birds.

From 1412 until 1416 he was apprenticed to the famous sculptor [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]].&lt;ref name="Lloyd-OAO"&gt;Lloyd, Christopher. "Uccello, Paolo." ''Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online''. Oxford University Press. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Ghiberti was the designer of the doors of the [[Florence Baptistery]] and his workshop was the premier centre for Florentine art at the time. Ghiberti's late-Gothic, narrative style and sculptural composition greatly influenced Paolo. It was also around this time that Paolo began his lifelong friendship with [[Donatello]]. In 1414, Uccello was admitted to the [[painters' guild]], ''Compagnia di San Luca,'' and just one year later, in 1415, he joined the official painter's guild of Florence ''Arte dei Medici e degli Speziali''. Although the young Uccello had probably left Ghiberti's workshop by the mid 1420s, he stayed on good terms with his master and may have been privy to the designs for Ghiberti's second set of Baptistery doors, ''The Gates of Paradise.'' These featured a battle scene "that might well have impressed itself in the mind of the young Uccello," and thus influenced ''[[The Battle of San Romano]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Private Life of a Masterpiece BBC TV&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
According to [[Vasari]], Uccello’s first painting was a Saint Anthony between the saints Cosmas and Damianus, a commission for the hospital of Lelmo. Next, he painted two figures in the convent of Annalena. Shortly afterwards, he painted three [[fresco]]es with scenes from ''the life of [[Francis of Assisi|Saint Francis]]'' above the left door of the [[Santa Trinita]] church. For the [[Santa Maria Maggiore di Firenze|Santa Maria Maggiore]] church, he painted a fresco of the [[Annunciation]]. In this fresco, he painted a large building with columns in perspective. According to Vasari, people found this to be a great and beautiful achievement because this was the first example of how lines could be expertly used to demonstrate perspective and size. As a result, this work became a model for artists who wished to craft illusions of space in order to enhance the realness of their paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/reader?id=43yEDKzADr0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;pg=GBS.PA75.w.1.2.161.0.1|title=The Lives of the Artists|last=Vasari|first=Giorgio|date=1998-04-02|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780191605482|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paolo painted ''the Lives of the [[Church Fathers]]'' in the cloisters of the church of [[San Miniato]], which sat on a hill overlooking Florence. According to Vasari, Paolo protested against the monotonous meals of cheese pies and [[cheese soup]] served by the abbot by running away, and returned to finish the job only after the abbot promised him a more varied diet.&lt;ref&gt;Barolsky, Paul. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-yeEoGzFQIQC&amp;pg=PA24 ''Why Mona Lisa Smiles and Other Tales by Vasari'']. Penn State Press, 2010. p. 24. {{ISBN|0271038527}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Uccello was asked to paint a number of scenes of distempered animals for the house of the Medici. The scene most appreciated by Vasari was his depiction of a fierce lion fighting with a venom-spouting snake. Uccello loved to paint animals and he kept a wide variety of pictures of animals, especially birds, at home. This love for birds is what led to his nickname, Paolo Uccelli (Paul of the birds).

By 1424, Paolo was earning his own living as a painter. In that year, he proved his artistic maturity by painting episodes of the ''Creation and Expulsion,'' which are now badly damaged, for the Green Cloister (''Chiostro Verde'') of [[Santa Maria Novella]] in Florence. Again, this assignment allowed him to paint a large number of animals in a lively manner. He also succeeded in painting trees in their natural colours. This was a skill that was difficult for many of his predecessors, so Uccello also began to acquire a reputation for painting landscapes. He continued with scenes from the [[Deluge (mythology)|Deluge]], the story of [[Noah's Ark]], Noah's sacrifice and Noah's drunkenness. These scenes brought him great fame in Florence.

[[Image:Paolo Uccello 044.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''[[Funerary Monument to Sir John Hawkwood]]'']]

In 1425, Uccello travelled to [[Venice]], where he worked on the mosaics for the façade of [[St Mark's Basilica|San Marco]], which have all since been lost. During this time, he also painted some frescoes in the [[Prato Cathedral]] and [[Bologna]]. Some suggest he visited [[Rome]] with his friend Donatello before returning to Florence in 1431. After he returned, Uccello remained in Florence for most of the rest of his life, executing works for various churches and patrons, most notably the [[Santa Maria del Fiore|Duomo]].

Despite his leave from Florence, interest in Uccello did not diminish. In 1432, the Office of Works asked the Florentine ambassador in Venice to enquire after Uccello’s reputation as an artist.  In 1436, he was given the commission for the monochromatic fresco of ''Sir [[John Hawkwood]]''. This equestrian monument exemplified his keen interest in [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]]. The [[condottiere]] and his horse are presented as if the fresco was a sculpture seen from below.

It is widely thought that he is the author of the frescoes ''Stories of the Virgin'' and ''Story of Saint Stephen'' in the Cappella dell'Assunta, Florence, so he likely visited nearby [[Prato]] sometime between 1435 and 1440. Later, in 1443, he painted the figures on the clock of the Duomo. In that same year and continuing into 1444, he designed a few stained glass windows for the same church.  In 1444 he was also at work in [[Padua]], and he travelled to Padua again in 1445 at Donatello’s invitation.

[[Image:Paolo Uccello 047b.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Saint George and the Dragon'' (c. 1470), showing Uccello's Gothic influences]]
Back in Florence in 1446, he painted the ''Green Stations of the Cross'', again for the cloister of the church Santa Maria Novella. Around 1447–1454 he painted ''Scenes of Monastic Life'' for the church [[Basilica di San Miniato al Monte|San Miniato al Monte]], Florence.

Around the mid-1450s,&lt;ref name="Lloyd-OAO"/&gt; he painted his three most famous paintings, the panels depicting ''[[The Battle of San Romano]]'' for the Palazzo Medici in Florence, commemorating the victory of the Florentine army over the Sienese in 1432. The extraordinarily [[Perspective (graphical)|foreshortened]] forms extending in many planes accentuate Uccello's virtuosity as a draftsman, and provides a controlled visual structure to the chaos of the battle scene.

By 1453, Uccello was married to Tommasa Malifici. This is known because, in that year Donato (named after Donatello), was born. Three years later, in 1456, his wife gave birth to their daughter, Antonia.&lt;ref name="Lloyd-OAO"/&gt; '''Antonia Uccello''' (1456–1491)&lt;ref&gt;Echols, Anne; Marty Williams. ''An annotated index of medieval women''. Markus Wiener Publishers, 1992, p. 61. {{ISBN|0-910129-27-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Carmelite]] nun, whom [[Giorgio Vasari]] called "a daughter who knew how to draw." She was even noted as a "pittoressa", a painter, on her death certificate.  Her style and her skill remains a mystery as none of her work is extant.

From 1465 to 1469, Uccello was in [[Urbino]] with his son Donato working for the Confraternity of Corpus Domini, a brotherhood of laymen. During this time, he painted the [[predella]] for their new altarpiece with the ''Miracle of the Profaned Host.'' (The main panel representing the "Communion of the Apostles" was commissioned to [[Joos van Wassenhove|Justus van Ghent]] and finished in 1474). Uccello's predella is composed of six meticulous, naturalistic scenes related to the antisemitic myth of [[host desecration]], which was based upon an event that supposedly occurred in Paris in 1290. It has been suggested that the subject of the main panel, on which Duke [[Frederick of Montefeltro]] of Urbino appears in the background conversing with an Asian, is related to the antisemitic intention of the predella. However, Federico did allow a small Jewish community to live in Urbino and not all of these scenes are unanimously attributed to Paolo Uccello.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081009120717/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0422/is_4_85/ai_111738112/pg_1 Katz, Dana E., ''The contours of tolerance: Jews and the Corpus Domini Altarpiece in Urbino'']  The Art Bulletin:85 (December 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Uccelo host burning.jpg|thumb|350px|A scene in Paolo Uccello's Corpus Domini [[predella]] (c. 1465–1468), set in a Jewish pawnbroker's home. Blood in the background emanates from [[Host (Holy Communion)|the Host]], which the moneylender has attempted to cook, and seeps under the door. This story first entered the Italian literary tradition via [[Giovanni Villani]] (c. 1280&amp;ndash;1348) and his ''[[Nuova Cronica]]''.]]

In his Florentine tax return of August 1469, Uccello declared, “I find myself old and ailing, my wife is ill, and I can no longer work.” In the last years of his life, Paolo was a lonesome and forgotten man who was afraid of hardship in life. His last known work is ''[[The Hunt in the Forest|The Hunt]]'', c. 1470. He made his testament on 11 November 1475 and died shortly afterwards on 10 December 1475 at the hospital of Florence, at the age of 78. He was buried in his father’s tomb in the Florentine church of [[Santo Spirito, Florence|Santo Spirito]].

With his precise and analytical mind, Paolo Uccello tried to apply a scientific method to depict objects in three-dimensional space. In particular, some of his studies of the perspective foreshortening of the [[torus]] are preserved, and one standard display of drawing skill was his depiction of the [[mazzocchio]].&lt;ref&gt;Emmer, Michele. "Art and Mathematics: The Platonic Solids." Leonardo 15(4): 277-282 (Autumn, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of [[Giulio Carlo Argan|G. C. Argan]]: "Paolo's rigour is similar to the rigour of [[Cubism|Cubists]] in the early 20th century, whose images were more ''true'' when they were less ''true to life''. Paolo constructs space through perspective, and historic event through the structure of space; if the resulting image is unnatural and unrealistic, so much the worse for nature and history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Argan|first=Giulio Carlo|title=Storia dell'arte italiana|year=1968|publisher=Sansoni|volume=2|page=186|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=XIo0AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22paolo+costruisce+lo+spazio%22&amp;dq=%22paolo+costruisce+lo+spazio%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjrq_3D7oDZAhXEHZQKHcReAWEQ6AEILTAB|isbn=9788838319136|language=italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perspective in his paintings has influenced many famous painters, such as [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Albrecht Dürer]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]], to name a few.

[[John Pope-Hennessy|Pope-Hennessy]] is far more conservative than the Italian authors: he attributes some of the works below to a "Prato Master" and a "Karlsruhe Master".

In mathematics, '''Pappus's centroid theorem''' (also known as  the '''Guldinus theorem''', '''Pappus–Guldinus theorem''' or '''Pappus's theorem''') is either of two related [[theorem]]s dealing with the [[surface area]]s and [[volume]]s of [[surface of revolution|surface]]s and [[solid of revolution|solid]]s of revolution.

The theorems are attributed to [[Pappus of Alexandria]]{{efn|See:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pappus of Alexandria|author-link=Pappus of Alexandria|editor-last=Jones|editor-first=Alexander|year=1986|title=Book 7 of the ''Collection''|location=New York|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=978-1-4612-4908-5|doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-4908-5|orig-year=c. 320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They who look at these things are hardly exalted, as were the ancients and all who wrote the finer things. When I see everyone occupied with the rudiments of mathematics and of the material for inquiries that nature sets before us, I am ashamed; I for one have proved things that are much more valuable and offer much application. In order not to end my discourse declaiming this with empty hands, I will give this for the benefit of the readers:&lt;br&gt;

The ratio of solids of complete revolution is compounded of (that) of the revolved figures and (that) of the straight lines similarly drawn to the axes from the centers of gravity in them; that of (solids of) incomplete (revolution) from (that) of the revolved figures and (that) of the arcs that the centers of gravity in them describe, where the (ratio) of these arcs is, of course, (compounded) of (that) of the (lines) drawn and (that) of the angles of revolution that their extremities contain, if these (lines) are also at (right angles) to the axes. These propositions, which are practically a single one, contain many theorems of all kinds, for curves and surfaces and solids, all at once and by one proof, things not yet and things already demonstrated, such as those in the twelfth book of the ''First Elements''.

==The first theorem==
The first theorem states that the [[surface area]] ''A'' of a [[surface of revolution]] generated by rotating a [[plane curve]] ''C'' about an [[axis of rotation|axis]] external to ''C'' and on the same plane is equal to the product of the [[arc length]] ''s'' of ''C'' and the distance ''d'' traveled by the [[Centroid|geometric centroid]] of ''C'':

: &lt;math&gt;A = sd.&lt;/math&gt;

For example, the surface area of the [[torus]] with minor [[radius]] ''r'' and major radius ''R'' is

: &lt;math&gt;A = (2\pi r)(2\pi R) = 4\pi^2 R r.&lt;/math&gt;

==The second theorem==
The second theorem states that the [[volume]] ''V'' of a [[solid of revolution]] generated by rotating a [[plane figure]] ''F'' about an external axis is equal to the product of the area ''A'' of ''F'' and the distance ''d'' traveled by the geometric centroid of ''F''. (Note that the centroid of ''F'' is usually different from the centroid of its boundary curve ''C''.) That is:

: &lt;math&gt;V = Ad.&lt;/math&gt;

For example, the volume of the [[torus]] with minor radius ''r'' and major radius ''R'' is

: &lt;math&gt;V = (\pi r^2)(2\pi R) = 2\pi^2 R r^2.&lt;/math&gt;

This special case was derived by [[Johannes Kepler]] using infinitesimals.{{efn|Theorem XVIII of Kepler's ''Nova Stereometria Doliorum Vinariorum'' (1615):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-last=Kepler|author-first=Johannes|chapter=Nova Stereometria Doliorum Vinariorum|editor-last=Frisch|editor-first=Christian|title=Joannis Kepleri astronomi opera omnia|volume=4|page=582|location=Frankfurt|year=1870|orig-year=1615|access-date=2016-08-04|publisher=Heyder and Zimmer|url=https://archive.org/details/joanniskeplerias04kepl}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Omnis annulus sectionis circularis vel ellipticae est aequalis cylindro, cujus altitudo aequat longitudinem circumferentiae, quam centrum figurae circumductae descripsit, basis vero eadem est cum sectione annuli." Translation:&lt;ref name="RdG2015" /&gt; "Any ring whose cross-section is circular or elliptic is equal to a cylinder whose height equals the length of the circumference covered by the center of the figure during its circular movement, and whose base is equal to the section of the ring."}}

===Proof===
Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be the area of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; the solid of revolution of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; the volume of &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; starts in the &lt;math&gt;xz&lt;/math&gt;-plane and rotates around the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-axis. The distance of the centroid of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; from the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-axis is its &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-coordinate

:&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{\iint_F x\,dA}{A},&lt;/math&gt;

and the theorem states that

:&lt;math&gt;V = Ad = A \cdot 2\pi R = 2\pi\iint_F x\,dA.&lt;/math&gt;

To show this, let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be in the ''xz''-plane, [[Parametric equation|parametrized]] by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Phi}(u,v) = (x(u,v),0,z(u,v))&lt;/math&gt; for  &lt;math&gt;(u,v)\in F^*&lt;/math&gt;, a parameter region. Since &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt; is essentially a mapping from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;, the area of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is given by the [[Integration by substitution#Substitution for multiple variables|change of variables]] formula:

:&lt;math&gt;A = \iint_F dA = \iint_{F^*} \left|\frac{\partial(x,z)}{\partial(u,v)}\right|\,du\,dv = \iint_{F^*} \left|\frac{\partial x}{\partial u}\frac{\partial z}{\partial v} - \frac{\partial x}{\partial v}\frac{\partial z}{\partial u}\right|\,du\,dv,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\partial(x,z)}{\partial(u,v)}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[determinant]] of the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian matrix]] of the change of variables. 

The solid &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; has the [[torus|toroidal]] parametrization &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Phi}(u,v,\theta) = (x(u,v)\cos\theta,x(u,v)\sin\theta,z(u,v))&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;(u,v,\theta)&lt;/math&gt; in the parameter region &lt;math&gt;W^*=F^*\times [0,2\pi]&lt;/math&gt;; and its volume is

:&lt;math&gt;V = \iiint_W dV = \iiint_{W^*} \left|\frac{\partial(x,y,z)}{\partial(u,v,\theta)}\right|\,du\,dv\,d\theta.&lt;/math&gt;

Expanding,

:&lt;math&gt;\left|\frac{\partial(x,y,z)}{\partial(u,v,\theta)}\right| \ = \ 
\left|\,\mathrm{det}\!\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial x}{\partial u}\cos\theta &amp; \frac{\partial x}{\partial v}\cos\theta &amp; -x\sin\theta \\[5pt]
\frac{\partial x}{\partial u}\sin\theta &amp; \frac{\partial x}{\partial v}\sin\theta &amp;  x\cos\theta \\[5pt]
\frac{\partial z}{\partial u}           &amp; \frac{\partial z}{\partial v}           &amp;  0
\end{bmatrix}\right| 
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \ = \ \left|-\frac{\partial z}{\partial v}\frac{\partial x}{\partial u}\,x + \frac{\partial z}{\partial u}\frac{\partial x}{\partial v}\,x\right|
=\ \left|-x\,\frac{\partial(x,z)}{\partial(u,v)}\right| \ =\ x\left|\frac{\partial(x,z)}{\partial(u,v)}\right|.&lt;/math&gt;

The last equality holds because the axis of rotation must be external to &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, meaning &lt;math&gt;x \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;. Now,

:&lt;math&gt;V = \iiint_{W^*} \left|\frac{\partial(x,y,z)}{\partial(u,v,\theta)}\right|\,du\,dv\,d\theta = \int_0^{2\pi}\!\!\!\!\iint_{F^*} x(u,v)\left|\frac{\partial(x,z)}{\partial(u,v)}\right|\,du\,dv\,d\theta&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;= 2\pi\iint_{F^*} x(u,v)\left|\frac{\partial(x,z)}{\partial(u,v)}\right|\,du\,dv = 2\pi\iint_F x\,dA&lt;/math&gt;

by change of variables.

==Generalizations==

The theorems can be generalized for arbitrary curves and shapes, under appropriate conditions. 

Goodman &amp; Goodman&lt;ref name=generalizations&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goodman|first1=A. W.|last2=Goodman|first2=G.|title=Generalizations of the Theorems of Pappus|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2316426?uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21104382078753|website=JSTOR|publisher=The American Mathematical Monthly|accessdate=2014-06-28|ref=generalizations}}&lt;/ref&gt; generalize the second theorem as follows. If the figure ''F'' moves through space so that it remains [[perpendicular]] to the curve ''L'' traced by the centroid of ''F'', then it sweeps out a solid of volume ''V'' = ''Ad'', where ''A'' is the area of ''F'' and ''d'' is the length of ''L''. (This assumes the solid does not intersect itself.) In particular, ''F'' may rotate about its centroid during the motion. 

However, the corresponding generalization of the first theorem is only true if the curve ''L'' traced by the centroid lies in a plane perpendicular to the plane of ''C''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5907">[[File:Pappus Chain Full.svg|thumb|A Pappus chain]]

In [[geometry]], the '''Pappus chain''' is a ring of [[circle]]s between two [[tangent circles]] investigated by [[Pappus of Alexandria]] in the 3rd century [[AD]].

==Construction==
The [[arbelos]] is defined by two circles, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;U&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;, which are tangent at the point '''A''' and where ''C''&lt;sub&gt;U&lt;/sub&gt; is enclosed by ''C''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;.  Let the radii of these two circles be denoted as ''r''&lt;sub&gt;U&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively, and let their respective centers be the points '''U''' and '''V'''.  The Pappus chain consists of the circles in the shaded grey region, which are externally tangent to ''C''&lt;sub&gt;U&lt;/sub&gt; (the inner circle) and internally tangent to ''C''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; (the outer circle).  Let the radius, diameter and center point of the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; circle of the Pappus chain be denoted as ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively.

==Properties==
===Centers of the circles===
====Ellipse====
All the centers of the circles in the Pappus chain are located on a common [[ellipse]], for the following reason.  The sum of the distances from the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; circle of the Pappus chain to the two centers '''U''' and '''V''' of the arbelos circles equals a constant

:&lt;math&gt;
\overline{\mathbf{P}_{n}\mathbf{U}} + \overline{\mathbf{P}_{n}\mathbf{V}} = 
\left( r_{U} + r_{n} \right) + \left( r_{V} - r_{n} \right) = r_{U} + r_{V}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the [[Focus (geometry)|foci]] of this ellipse are '''U''' and '''V''', the centers of the two circles that define the arbelos; these points correspond to the midpoints of the line segments '''AB''' and '''AC''', respectively.

====Coordinates====
If ''r'' = ''AC''/''AB'', then the center of the ''n''th circle in the chain is:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(x_n,y_n\right)=\left(\frac {r(1+r)}{2[n^2(1-r)^2+r]}~,~\frac {nr(1-r)}{n^2(1-r)^2+r}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

===Radii of the circles===
If ''r'' = ''AC''/''AB'', then the radius of the ''n''th circle in the chain is:
:&lt;math&gt;r_n=\frac {(1-r)r}{2[n^2(1-r)^2+r]}&lt;/math&gt;

===Circle inversion===
[[File:Pappus Chain Theorem.svg|thumb|right|250px|Under a particular inversion centered on '''A''', the four initial circles of the Pappus chain are transformed into a stack of four equally sized circles, sandwiched between two parallel lines.  This accounts for the height formula ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''n'' ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and the fact that the original points of tangency lie on a common circle.]]
The height ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of the center of the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; circle above the base diameter '''ACB''' equals ''n'' times ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Ogilvy, pp. 54&amp;ndash;55.&lt;/ref&gt;  This may be shown by [[Circle inversion|inverting in a circle]] centered on the tangent point '''A'''.  The circle of inversion is chosen to intersect the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; circle perpendicularly, so that the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; circle is transformed into itself.  The two arbelos circles, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;U&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;, are transformed into parallel lines tangent to and sandwiching the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; circle; hence, the other circles of the Pappus chain are transformed into similarly sandwiched circles of the same diameter. The initial circle ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and the final circle ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; each contribute ½''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; to the height ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, whereas the circles ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;ndash;''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt; each contribute ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.  Adding these contributions together yields the equation ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''n'' ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

The same inversion can be used to show that the points where the circles of the Pappus chain are tangent to one another lie on a common circle.  As noted above, the [[Inversive geometry|inversion]] centered at point '''A''' transforms the arbelos circles ''C''&lt;sub&gt;U&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; into two parallel lines, and the circles of the Pappus chain into a stack of equally sized circles sandwiched between the two parallel lines.  Hence, the points of tangency between the transformed circles lie on a line midway between the two parallel lines.  Undoing the inversion in the circle, this line of tangent points is transformed back into a circle.  

===Steiner chain===
In these properties of having centers on an ellipse and tangencies on a circle, the Pappus chain is analogous to the [[Steiner chain]], in which finitely many circles are tangent to two circles.

In [[algebra]] and in particular in [[algebraic combinatorics]], a '''quasisymmetric function''' is any element in the '''ring of quasisymmetric functions''' which is in turn a subring of the [[formal power series]] ring with a countable number of variables.  This ring generalizes  the [[ring of symmetric functions]].  This ring can be realized as a specific limit of the [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] of quasisymmetric polynomials in ''n'' variables, as ''n'' goes to infinity. This ring serves as universal structure in which relations between quasisymmetric polynomials can be expressed in a way independent of the number ''n'' of variables (but its elements are neither polynomials nor functions).

== Definitions ==

The '''ring of quasisymmetric functions''', denoted QSym, can be defined over any [[commutative ring]] ''R'' such as the  [[integers]]. 
Quasisymmetric 
functions are [[formal power series|power series]] of bounded degree in variables &lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2,x_3, \dots &lt;/math&gt; with coefficients in ''R'', which are shift invariant in the sense that the coefficient of  the monomial &lt;math&gt;x_1^{\alpha_1}x_2^{\alpha_2}  \cdots x_k^{\alpha_k}&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the coefficient of the monomial &lt;math&gt;x_{i_1}^{\alpha_1} x_{i_2}^{\alpha_2}\cdots x_{i_k}^{\alpha_k}&lt;/math&gt; for any strictly increasing sequence of positive integers 
&lt;math&gt;i_1&lt; i_2&lt; \cdots &lt; i_k&lt;/math&gt; indexing the variables and any positive integer sequence &lt;math&gt;(\alpha_1, \alpha_2,\ldots,\alpha_k)&lt;/math&gt; of exponents.&lt;ref name="EC2"&gt;
[[Richard P. Stanley|Stanley, Richard P.]] ''Enumerative Combinatorics'', Vol. 2, Cambridge University Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-521-56069-1}} (hardback) {{ISBN|0-521-78987-7}} (paperback).&lt;/ref&gt;
Much of the study of quasisymmetric functions is based on that of [[symmetric functions]].

A quasisymmetric function in finitely many variables is a ''quasisymmetric [[polynomial]]''.
Both symmetric and quasisymmetric polynomials may be characterized in terms of [[group actions|actions]] of the [[symmetric group]] &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt;
on a [[polynomial ring]] in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; variables &lt;math&gt;x_1,\dots, x_n&lt;/math&gt;. 
One such action of &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; permutes variables,
changing a polynomial &lt;math&gt;p(x_1,\dots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt; by iteratively swapping pairs &lt;math&gt;(x_i, x_{i+1})&lt;/math&gt;
of variables having consecutive indices.
Those polynomials unchanged by all such swaps
form the subring of symmetric polynomials.
A second action of &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; conditionally permutes variables, 
changing a polynomial &lt;math&gt;p(x_1,\ldots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt;
by swapping pairs &lt;math&gt;(x_i, x_{i+1})&lt;/math&gt; of variables
''except'' in monomials containing both variables.
Those polynomials unchanged by all such conditional swaps form
the subring of quasisymmetric polynomials.  One quasisymmetric function in four variables is the polynomial

: &lt;math&gt; x_1^2 x_2 x_3 + x_1^2 x_2 x_4 + x_1^2 x_3 x_4 + x_2^2 x_3 x_4. \, &lt;/math&gt;

The simplest symmetric function containing all of these monomials is

: &lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
x_1^2 x_2 x_3 + x_1^2 x_2 x_4 + x_1^2 x_3 x_4 + x_2^2 x_3 x_4
+ x_1 x_2^2 x_3 + x_1 x_2^2 x_4 + x_1 x_3^2 x_4 + x_2 x_3^2 x_4 \\
{} + x_1 x_2 x_3^2 + x_1 x_2 x_4^2 + x_1 x_3 x_4^2 + x_2 x_3 x_4^2. \,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Important bases ==

QSym is a [[graded algebra|graded]] ''R''-[[Algebra over a ring|algebra]], decomposing as 

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{QSym} = \bigoplus_{n \ge 0} \operatorname{QSym}_n, \, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{QSym}_n&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-[[linear span|span]] of all quasisymmetric functions that are [[homogeneous polynomial|homogeneous]] of degree &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.  Two natural [[linear basis|bases]] for &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{QSym}_n&lt;/math&gt; are the '''monomial basis''' &lt;math&gt;\{M_{\alpha} \}&lt;/math&gt; and the '''fundamental basis''' &lt;math&gt;\{F_{\alpha} \}&lt;/math&gt; indexed by [[composition (number theory)|composition]]s &lt;math&gt;\alpha = (\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \ldots , \alpha_k)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;\alpha \vDash n&lt;/math&gt;.    The monomial basis consists of &lt;math&gt;M_0=1&lt;/math&gt; and all formal power series 

: &lt;math&gt;M_{\alpha} = \sum_{i_1 &lt; i_2 &lt; \cdots &lt; i_k} x_{i_1}^{\alpha_1} x_{i_2}^{\alpha_2} \cdots x_{i_k}^{\alpha_k}. \, &lt;/math&gt;

The fundamental basis consists &lt;math&gt;F_0=1&lt;/math&gt; and all formal power series 

: &lt;math&gt;F_\alpha = \sum_{\alpha \succeq \beta} M_\beta, \, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha \succeq \beta&lt;/math&gt; means we can obtain &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; by adding together adjacent parts of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, for example, (3,2,4,2)&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\succeq&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;(3,1,1,1,2,1,2).  Thus, when the ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the ring of [[rational numbers]], one has

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{QSym}_n = \operatorname{span}_{\mathbb{Q}} \{ M_\alpha \mid \alpha \vDash n \} = \operatorname{span}_{\mathbb{Q}} \{ F_\alpha \mid \alpha \vDash n \}. \, &lt;/math&gt;

Then one can define the algebra of [[symmetric functions]] &lt;math&gt;\Lambda = \Lambda _0 \oplus \Lambda _1 \oplus \cdots&lt;/math&gt; as the subalgebra of QSym spanned by the [[monomial symmetric polynomial|monomial symmetric functions]] &lt;math&gt;m_0=1&lt;/math&gt; and all formal power series &lt;math&gt;m_\lambda = \sum M_\alpha,&lt;/math&gt; where the sum is over all compositions &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; which rearrange to the [[partition (number theory)|partition]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.  Moreover, we have &lt;math&gt;\Lambda_n = \Lambda \cap \operatorname{QSym}_n&lt;/math&gt;.  For example, &lt;math&gt;F_{(1,2)}=M_{(1,2)}+M_{(1,1,1)}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_{(2,1)}=M_{(2,1)}+M_{(1,2)}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Related algebras ==

As a graded Hopf algebra, the dual of the ring of quasisymmetric functions is the ring of noncommutative symmetric functions. 
Every symmetric function is also a quasisymmetric function, and hence the ring of symmetric functions is a subalgebra of the ring of quasisymmetric functions.

The ring of quasisymmetric functions is the terminal object in category of graded Hopf algebras with a single character.&lt;ref name="ABS"&gt;{{citation|last1=Aguiar|first1= Marcelo|last2=Bergeron|first2= Nantel|last3= Sottile|first3= Frank |title=Combinatorial Hopf algebras and generalized Dehn–Sommerville relations|journal=  Compositio Mathematica  |volume=142  |year=2006|pages= 1–30 |issue= 1|bibcode=2003math.....10016A|arxiv=math/0310016|doi=10.1112/S0010437X0500165X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hence any such Hopf algebra has a morphism to the ring of quasisymmetric functions.

One example of this is the [[peak algebra]].&lt;ref name="Stem"&gt;{{citation|last=Stembridge|first= John R. |title=Enriched P-partitions|journal=  [[Trans. Amer. Math. Soc.]]  |volume=349|year=1997|pages= 763–788  |issue=2|doi=10.1090/S0002-9947-97-01804-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40446">{{redirect-distinguish|Difference equation|differential equation}}
In [[mathematics]], a '''recurrence relation''' is an [[equation]] that [[recursion|recursively]] defines a [[sequence]] or multidimensional array of values, once one or more initial terms are given: each further term of the sequence or array is defined as a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] of the preceding terms.

The term '''[[#Relationship_to_difference_equations_narrowly_defined|difference equation]]''' sometimes (and for the purposes of this article) refers to a specific type of recurrence relation.  However, "difference equation" is frequently used to refer to ''any'' recurrence relation.

==Examples==

===Logistic map===
An example of a recurrence relation is the [[logistic map]]:

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n+1} = r x_n (1 - x_n),&lt;/math&gt;

with a given constant ''r''; given the initial term ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; each subsequent term is determined by this relation.

Some simply defined recurrence relations can have very complex ([[chaos theory|chaotic]]) behaviours, and they are a part of the field of mathematics known as [[Nonlinearity|nonlinear analysis]].

Solving a recurrence relation means obtaining a [[closed-form solution]]: a non-recursive function of ''n''.

===Fibonacci numbers===
The recurrence satisfied by the [[Fibonacci number]]s is the archetype of a homogeneous [[linear recurrence]] relation with constant coefficients (see below).  The Fibonacci sequence is defined using the recurrence

:&lt;math&gt;F_n = F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}&lt;/math&gt;

with [[initial condition]]s (seed values)

:&lt;math&gt;F_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F_1 = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Explicitly, the recurrence yields the equations
:&lt;math&gt;F_2 = F_1 + F_0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F_3 = F_2 + F_1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F_4 = F_3 + F_2&lt;/math&gt;
etc.

We obtain the sequence of Fibonacci numbers, which begins
:0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

The recurrence can be solved by methods described below yielding [[Binet's formula]], which involves powers of the two roots of the characteristic polynomial ''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''t''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1; the [[generating function]] of the sequence is the [[rational function]]
:  &lt;math&gt;\frac{t}{1-t-t^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Binomial coefficients===
A simple example of a multidimensional recurrence relation is given by the [[binomial coefficient]]s &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{n}{k}&lt;/math&gt;, which count the number of ways of selecting ''k'' elements out of a set of ''n'' elements.
They can be computed by the recurrence relation
:&lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{k}=\binom{n-1}{k-1}+\binom{n-1}{k},&lt;/math&gt;
with the base cases &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{n}{0}=\tbinom{n}{n}=1&lt;/math&gt;. Using this formula to compute the values of all binomial coefficients generates an infinite array called [[Pascal's triangle]]. The same values can also be computed directly by a different formula that is not a recurrence, but that requires multiplication and not just addition to compute:
&lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{k}=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Relationship to difference equations narrowly defined ==
Given an ordered [[sequence]] &lt;math&gt;\left\{a_n\right\}_{n=1}^\infty&lt;/math&gt; of [[real numbers]]: the '''first difference''' &lt;math&gt;\Delta(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(a_n) = a_{n+1} - a_n.&lt;/math&gt;

The '''second difference''' &lt;math&gt;\Delta^2(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta^2(a_n) = \Delta(a_{n+1}) - \Delta(a_n),&lt;/math&gt;

which can be simplified to

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta^2(a_n) = a_{n+2} - 2a_{n+1} + a_n.&lt;/math&gt;

More generally: the ''' ''k''-th difference''' of the sequence ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' written as &lt;math&gt;\Delta^k(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; is defined recursively as

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta^k(a_n) = \Delta^{k-1}(a_{n+1}) - \Delta^{k-1}(a_n)=\sum_{t=0}^k \binom{k}{t} (-1)^t a_{n+k-t}.&lt;/math&gt;

(The sequence and its differences are related by a [[binomial transform]].) The more restrictive definition of '''difference equation''' is an equation composed of ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and its ''k''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; differences. (A widely used broader definition treats "difference equation" as synonymous with "recurrence relation".  See for example [[rational difference equation]] and [[matrix difference equation]].)

Actually, it is easily seen that,

:&lt;math&gt;a_{n+k} = 
{k\choose 0}a_n + {k\choose 1} \Delta(a_n)  + \cdots + {k\choose k} \Delta^k(a_n).
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, a difference equation can be defined as an equation that involves 
''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''a&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''a&lt;sub&gt;n-2&lt;/sub&gt;'' etc. (or equivalently
''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''a&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''a&lt;sub&gt;n+2&lt;/sub&gt;'' etc.)

Since difference equations are a very common form of recurrence, some authors use the two terms interchangeably. For example, the difference equation

:&lt;math&gt;3\Delta^2(a_n) + 2\Delta(a_n) + 7a_n = 0&lt;/math&gt;

is equivalent to the recurrence relation

:&lt;math&gt;3a_{n+2} = 4a_{n+1} - 8a_n.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus one can solve many recurrence relations by rephrasing them as difference equations, and then solving the difference equation, analogously to how one solves [[ordinary differential equations]].  However, the [[Ackermann number]]s are an example of a recurrence relation that do not map to a difference equation, much less points on the solution to a differential equation.

See [[time scale calculus]] for a unification of the theory of difference equations with that of [[differential equations]].

[[Summation equation]]s relate to difference equations as [[integral equation]]s relate to differential equations.

===From sequences to grids===
Single-variable or one-dimensional recurrence relations are about sequences (i.e. functions defined on one-dimensional grids). Multi-variable or n-dimensional recurrence relations are about n-dimensional grids. Functions defined on n-grids can also be studied with '''partial difference equations'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1klnDGelHGEC Partial difference equations], Sui Sun Cheng, CRC Press, 2003, {{isbn|978-0-415-29884-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Constant-recursive sequence|Linear difference equation}}

====Roots of the characteristic polynomial====
An order-''d'' '''homogeneous linear recurrence with constant coefficients'''  is an equation of the form

:&lt;math&gt;a_n = c_1a_{n-1} + c_2a_{n-2}+\cdots+c_da_{n-d},&lt;/math&gt;

where the ''d'' coefficients ''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' (for all ''i'') are constants, and &lt;math&gt;c_d\ne0&lt;/math&gt;.

A [[constant-recursive sequence]] is a sequence satisfying a recurrence of this form.  There are ''d'' [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]] for solutions to this recurrence, i.e., the initial values &lt;math&gt;a_0,\dots,a_{d-1}&lt;/math&gt; can be taken to be any values but then the recurrence determines the sequence uniquely.

The same coefficients yield the [[characteristic polynomial]] (also "auxiliary polynomial")

:&lt;math&gt;p(t)= t^d - c_1t^{d-1} - c_2t^{d-2}-\cdots-c_{d}&lt;/math&gt;
whose ''d'' roots play a crucial role in finding and understanding the sequences satisfying the recurrence. If the roots ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... are all distinct, then each solution to the recurrence takes the form
:&lt;math&gt;a_n = k_1 r_1^n + k_2 r_2^n + \cdots + k_d r_d^n,&lt;/math&gt;
where the coefficients ''k&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are determined in order to fit the initial conditions of the recurrence. When the same roots occur multiple times, the terms in this formula corresponding to the second and later occurrences of the same root are multiplied by increasing powers of ''n''. For instance, if the characteristic polynomial can be factored as (''x''−''r'')&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, with the same root ''r'' occurring three times, then the solution would take the form
:&lt;math&gt;a_n = k_1 r^n + k_2 n r^n + k_3 n^2 r^n.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|contribution=2.1.1 Constant coefficients – A) Homogeneous equations|title=Mathematics for the Analysis of Algorithms|first1=Daniel H.|last1=Greene|first2=Donald E.|last2=Knuth|author2-link=Donald Knuth| edition=2nd| publisher=Birkhäuser |page=17 | year=1982}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as the [[Fibonacci number]]s, other constant-recursive sequences include the [[Lucas number]]s and [[Lucas sequence]]s, the [[Jacobsthal number]]s, the [[Pell number]]s and more generally the solutions to [[Pell's equation]].

For order 1, the recurrence
:&lt;math&gt;a_{n}=r a_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;
has the solution ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''r&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' with ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and the most general solution is ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''kr&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' with ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k''. The  characteristic polynomial equated to zero (the [[Characteristic polynomial|characteristic equation]]) is simply ''t''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

Solutions to such recurrence relations of higher order are found by systematic means, often using the fact that ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''r&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' is a solution for the recurrence exactly when ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''r'' is a root of the characteristic polynomial. This can be approached directly or using [[generating function]]s ([[formal power series]]) or matrices.

Consider, for example, a recurrence relation of the form

:&lt;math&gt;a_{n}=Aa_{n-1}+Ba_{n-2}.&lt;/math&gt;

When does it have a solution of the same general form as ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''r&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''? Substituting this guess ([[ansatz]]) in the recurrence relation, we find that

:&lt;math&gt;r^{n}=Ar^{n-1}+Br^{n-2}&lt;/math&gt;

must be true for '''all'''&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1.

Dividing through by ''r''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−2&lt;/sup&gt;, we get that all these equations reduce to the same thing:

:&lt;math&gt;r^2=Ar+B,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r^2-Ar-B=0,&lt;/math&gt;

which is the characteristic equation of the recurrence relation.  Solve for ''r'' to obtain the two roots ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: these roots are known as the [[characteristic root]]s or '''eigenvalues''' of the characteristic equation.  Different solutions are obtained depending on the nature of the roots:  If these roots are distinct, we have the general solution

:&lt;math&gt;a_n = C\lambda_1^n+D\lambda_2^n&lt;/math&gt;

while if they are identical (when ''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4''B''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0), we have

:&lt;math&gt;a_n = C\lambda^n+Dn\lambda^n&lt;/math&gt;

This is the most general solution; the two constants ''C'' and ''D'' can be chosen based on two given initial conditions ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to produce a specific solution.

In the case of complex eigenvalues (which also gives rise to complex values for the solution parameters ''C'' and ''D''), the use of complex numbers can be eliminated by rewriting the solution in trigonometric form.  In this case we can write the eigenvalues as &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1, \lambda_2 = \alpha \pm \beta i.&lt;/math&gt; Then it can be shown that

:&lt;math&gt;a_n = C\lambda_1^n+D\lambda_2^n&lt;/math&gt;

can be rewritten as&lt;ref&gt;Chiang, Alpha C., ''Fundamental Methods of Mathematical Economics'', third edition, McGraw-Hill, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|576–585}}

:&lt;math&gt;a_n = 2 M^n \left( E \cos(\theta n) + F \sin(\theta n)\right) = 2 G M^n \cos(\theta n - \delta),&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{lcl}
  M = \sqrt{\alpha^2+\beta^2} &amp; \cos (\theta) =\tfrac{\alpha}{M} &amp; \sin( \theta) = \tfrac{\beta}{M} \\
  C,D = E \mp F i &amp; &amp; \\
  G = \sqrt{E^2+F^2} &amp; \cos (\delta ) = \tfrac{E}{G} &amp; \sin (\delta )= \tfrac{F}{G}
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''E'' and ''F'' (or equivalently, ''G'' and δ)  are real constants which depend on the initial conditions. Using 
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_1+\lambda_2=2 \alpha = A,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 \cdot \lambda_2=\alpha^2+\beta^2=-B,&lt;/math&gt;

one may simplify the solution given above as

:&lt;math&gt;a_n = (-B)^{\frac{n}{2}} \left( E \cos(\theta n) + F \sin(\theta n)\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the initial conditions and

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  E &amp;=\frac{-A a_1 + a_2}{B} \\
 F &amp;=-i \frac{A^2 a_1 - A a_2 +2 a_1 B}{B \sqrt{A^2+4B}} \\
\theta &amp;=\arccos \left (\frac{A}{2 \sqrt{-B}} \right )
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In this way there is no need to solve for λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and λ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

In all cases—real distinct eigenvalues, real duplicated eigenvalues, and complex conjugate eigenvalues—the equation is [[stability theory|stable]] (that is, the variable ''a'' converges to a fixed value [specifically, zero]) if and only if ''both'' eigenvalues are smaller than one in [[absolute value]].  In this second-order case, this condition on the eigenvalues can be shown&lt;ref&gt;Papanicolaou, Vassilis, "On the asymptotic stability of a class of linear difference equations," ''Mathematics Magazine'' 69(1), February 1996, 34&amp;ndash;43.&lt;/ref&gt; to be equivalent to |''A''|&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''B''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;2, which is equivalent to |''B''|&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1 and |''A''|&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''B''.

The equation in the above example was [[homogeneous differential equation|homogeneous]], in that there was no constant term.  If one starts with the non-homogeneous recurrence

:&lt;math&gt;b_{n}=Ab_{n-1}+Bb_{n-2}+K&lt;/math&gt;

with constant term ''K'', this can be converted into homogeneous form as follows:  The [[steady state]] is found by setting ''b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' =&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt; =&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−2&lt;/sub&gt; =&amp;nbsp;''b''* to obtain

:&lt;math&gt; b^{*} = \frac{K}{1-A-B}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then the non-homogeneous recurrence can be rewritten in homogeneous form as

:&lt;math&gt;[b_n - b^*]=A[b_{n-1}-b^*]+B[b_{n-2}-b^*],&lt;/math&gt;

which can be solved as above.

The stability condition stated above in terms of eigenvalues for the second-order case remains valid for the general ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-order case:  the equation is stable if and only if all eigenvalues of the characteristic equation are less than one in absolute value.

Given a homogeneous linear recurrence relation with constant coefficients of order ''d'', let ''p''(''t'') be the [[characteristic polynomial]] (also "auxiliary polynomial")

:&lt;math&gt;t^d - c_1t^{d-1} - c_2t^{d-2}-\cdots-c_{d} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

such that each ''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' corresponds to each ''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' in the original recurrence relation (see the general form above). Suppose &amp;lambda; is a root of ''p''(''t'') having [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]] ''r''. This is to say that (''t''−λ)&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; divides ''p''(''t''). The following two properties hold:

# Each of the ''r'' sequences &lt;math&gt;\lambda^n, n\lambda^n, n^2\lambda^n,\dots,n^{r-1}\lambda^n&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the recurrence relation.
# Any sequence satisfying the recurrence relation can be written uniquely as a linear combination of solutions constructed in part 1 as ''λ'' varies over all distinct roots of&amp;nbsp;''p''(''t'').

As a result of this theorem a homogeneous linear recurrence relation with constant coefficients can be solved in the following manner:

# Find the characteristic polynomial ''p''(''t'').
# Find the roots of ''p''(''t'') counting multiplicity.
# Write ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' as a linear combination of all the roots (counting multiplicity as shown in the theorem above) with unknown coefficients ''b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''.

::&lt;math&gt;a_n = \left (b_1\lambda_1^n + b_2n\lambda_1^n + b_3n^2\lambda_1^n+\cdots+b_r n^{r-1}\lambda_1^n \right )+\cdots+ \left (b_{d-q+1}\lambda_{*}^n + \cdots + b_{d}n^{q-1}\lambda_{*}^n \right )&lt;/math&gt;

:This is the general solution to the original recurrence relation. (''q'' is the multiplicity of λ&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;)

:4. Equate each &lt;math&gt;a_0, a_1, \dots,a_d&lt;/math&gt; from part 3 (plugging in ''n'' = 0, ..., ''d'' into the general solution of the recurrence relation) with the known values &lt;math&gt;a_0, a_1, \dots,a_d&lt;/math&gt; from the original recurrence relation. However, the values ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' from the original recurrence relation used do not usually have to be contiguous: excluding exceptional cases, just ''d'' of them are needed (i.e., for an original homogeneous linear recurrence relation of order 3 one could use the values ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).  This process will produce a linear system of ''d'' equations with ''d'' unknowns. Solving these equations for the unknown coefficients &lt;math&gt;b_1, b_2, \dots,b_d &lt;/math&gt; of the general solution and plugging these values back into the general solution will produce the particular solution to the original recurrence relation that fits the original recurrence relation's initial conditions (as well as all subsequent values &lt;math&gt;a_0,a_1,a_2,\dots&lt;/math&gt; of the original recurrence relation).

The method for solving linear [[differential equations]] is similar to the method above—the "intelligent guess" ([[ansatz]]) for linear differential equations with constant coefficients is ''e''&lt;sup&gt;λ''x''&lt;/sup&gt; where λ is a complex number that is determined by substituting the guess into the differential equation.

This is not a coincidence.  Considering the [[Taylor series]] of the solution to a linear differential equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infin \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!} (x-a)^n&lt;/math&gt;

it can be seen that the coefficients of the series are given by the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; derivative of ''f''(''x'') evaluated at the point ''a''. The differential equation provides a linear difference equation relating these coefficients.

This equivalence can be used to quickly solve for the recurrence relationship for the coefficients in the power series solution of a linear differential equation.

The rule of thumb (for equations in which the polynomial multiplying the first term is non-zero at zero) is that:

:&lt;math&gt;y^{[k]} \to  f[n+k]&lt;/math&gt;
and more generally
:&lt;math&gt;x^m*y^{[k]} \to n(n-1)...(n-m+1)f[n+k-m]&lt;/math&gt;

'''Example:''' The recurrence relationship for the Taylor series coefficients of the equation:

:&lt;math&gt; (x^2 + 3x -4)y^{[3]} -(3x+1)y^{[2]} + 2y = 0&lt;/math&gt;

is given by

:&lt;math&gt; n(n-1)f[n+1] + 3nf[n+2] -4f[n+3] -3nf[n+1] -f[n+2]+ 2f[n] = 0&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;-4f[n+3] +2nf[n+2] + n(n-4)f[n+1] +2f[n] = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This example shows how problems generally solved using the power series solution method taught in normal differential equation classes can be solved in a much easier way.

'''Example:''' The differential equation

:&lt;math&gt;ay'' + by' +cy = 0&lt;/math&gt;

has solution

:&lt;math&gt; y=e^{ax}.&lt;/math&gt;

The conversion of the differential equation to a difference equation of the Taylor coefficients is

:&lt;math&gt;af[n + 2] + bf[n + 1] + cf[n] = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

It is easy to see that the ''n''th derivative of ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''ax''&lt;/sup&gt; evaluated at 0 is ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;

====Solving via linear algebra====
A linearly recursive sequence y of order n

:&lt;math&gt;y_{n+k} - c_{n-1}y_{n-1+k} - c_{n-2}y_{n-2+k} + \cdots - c_{0}y_{k} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

is identical to

:&lt;math&gt;y_{n} = c_{n-1}y_{n-1} + c_{n-2}y_{n-2} + \cdots +c_{0}y_{0}.&lt;/math&gt;

Expanded with n-1 identities of kind &lt;math&gt;y_{n-k} = y_{n-k},&lt;/math&gt; this n-th order equation is translated into a [[matrix difference equation]] system of n first-order linear equations,

:&lt;math&gt;\vec y_{n} = \begin{bmatrix}y_n\\y_{n-1}\\ \vdots \\ \vdots \\ y_1 \end{bmatrix} =

\begin{bmatrix}
 c_{n-1} &amp; c_{n-2} &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp; c_{0} \\
 1       &amp; 0       &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp; 0     \\
 0       &amp; \ddots  &amp; \ddots &amp;        &amp;\vdots \\
 \vdots  &amp; \ddots  &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp;\vdots \\
 0       &amp; \cdots  &amp; 0      &amp; 1     &amp; 0      \end{bmatrix}

\begin{bmatrix}y_{n-1} \\y_{n-2} \\ \vdots \\ \vdots \\ y_0 \end{bmatrix} 
= C\ \vec y_{n-1} = C^n \vec y_0.&lt;/math&gt;

Observe that the vector &lt;math&gt;\vec y_n&lt;/math&gt; can be computed by ''n'' applications of the [[companion matrix]], C, to the initial state vector, &lt;math&gt;y_0&lt;/math&gt;. Thereby, n-th entry of the sought sequence y, is the top component of &lt;math&gt;\vec y_n, y_n = \vec y_n[n]&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Eigendecomposition of a matrix#Example|Eigendecomposition]], &lt;math&gt;\vec y_n = C^n\, \vec y_0 = c_1\,\lambda_1^n\,\vec e_1 + c_2\,\lambda_2^n\,\vec e_2 + \cdots + c_n\,\lambda_n^n\,\vec e_n&lt;/math&gt; into eigenvalues, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_n&lt;/math&gt;, and eigenvectors, &lt;math&gt;\vec e_1, \vec e_2, \ldots, \vec e_n&lt;/math&gt;, is used to compute &lt;math&gt;\vec y_n.&lt;/math&gt; Thanks to the crucial fact that system ''C'' time-shifts every eigenvector, ''e'', by simply scaling its components ''λ'' times,

:&lt;math&gt;C\,\vec e_i = \lambda_i \vec e_i = C \begin{bmatrix}e_{i,n} \\e_{i,n-1} \\ \vdots \\ e_{i,1}\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}\lambda_i\,e_{i,n} \\ \lambda_i\,e_{i,n-1} \\ \vdots \\ \lambda_i\,e_{i,1}\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

that is, time-shifted version of eigenvector,''e'', has components ''λ'' times larger, the eigenvector components are powers of ''λ'', &lt;math&gt;\vec e_i = \begin{bmatrix}\lambda_i^{n-1} &amp; \cdots &amp; \lambda_i^2 &amp; \lambda_i &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}^T,&lt;/math&gt; and, thus, recurrent homogeneous linear equation solution is a combination of exponential functions, &lt;math&gt;\vec y_n = \sum_1^n {c_i\,\lambda_i^n\,\vec e_i}&lt;/math&gt;. The components &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; can be determined out of initial conditions:

:&lt;math&gt;\vec y_0 = \begin{bmatrix}y_{0}\\ y_{-1} \\ \vdots\\ y_{-n+1}\end{bmatrix} = \sum_{i=1}^n {c_i\,\lambda_i^0\,\vec e_i} = \begin{bmatrix}\vec e_1 &amp; \vec e_2 &amp; \cdots &amp; \vec e_n\end{bmatrix}\,\begin{bmatrix}c_1 \\ c_2 \\ \cdots \\ c_n\end{bmatrix} = E\, \begin{bmatrix}c_1 \\ c_2 \\ \cdots \\ c_n\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for coefficients,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}c_1 \\ c_2 \\ \cdots \\ c_n\end{bmatrix} = E^{-1} \vec y_0 = \begin{bmatrix}\lambda_1^{n-1} &amp; \lambda_2^{n-1} &amp; \cdots &amp;  \lambda_n^{n-1} \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ \lambda_1 &amp; \lambda_2 &amp; \cdots &amp;  \lambda_n \\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}^{-1}\,\begin{bmatrix}y_{0}\\ y_{-1} \\ \vdots\\ y_{-n+1}\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

This also works with arbitrary boundary conditions &lt;math&gt;\underbrace{y_a, y_b, \ldots}_\text{n}&lt;/math&gt;, not necessary the initial ones,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}y_a \\ y_b \\ \vdots\end{bmatrix}  = \begin{bmatrix}\vec y_a[n] \\ \vec y_b[n] \\ \vdots\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}\sum_{i=1}^n {c_i\,\lambda_i^a\,\vec e_i[n]} \\ \sum_{i=1}^n {c_i\,\lambda_i^b\,\vec e_i[n]} \\ \vdots\end{bmatrix}  =\begin{bmatrix}\sum_{i=1}^n {c_i\,\lambda_i^a\,\lambda_i^{n-1}} \\ \sum_{i=1}^n {c_i\,\lambda_i^b\,\lambda_i^{n-1}} \\ \vdots\end{bmatrix} = &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; = \begin{bmatrix}\sum {c_i\,\lambda_i^{a+n-1}} \\ \sum {c_i\,\lambda_i^{b+n-1}} \\ \vdots\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}\lambda_1^{a+n-1} &amp; \lambda_2^{a+n-1} &amp; \cdots &amp; \lambda_n^{a+n-1} \\ \lambda_1^{b+n-1} &amp; \lambda_2^{b+n-1} &amp; \cdots &amp; \lambda_n^{b+n-1} \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \end{bmatrix}\,\begin{bmatrix}c_1 \\ c_2 \\ \vdots \\ c_n\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

This description is really no different from general method above, however it is more succinct. It also works nicely for situations like
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}
  a_n =a_{n-1}-b_{n-1}\\
  b_n =2a_{n-1}+b_{n-1}.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
where there are several linked recurrences.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Discrete Algorithmic Mathematics|first1=Stephen B.|last1=Maurer|first2=Anthony|last2=Ralston|edition=2nd|publisher=A K Peters|year=1998|isbn=9781568810911|page=609}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Solving with z-transforms====
Certain difference equations - in particular, [[Z-transform#Linear constant-coefficient difference equation|linear constant coefficient]] difference equations - can be solved using [[z-transform]]s. The ''z''-transforms are a class of [[integral transform]]s that lead to more convenient algebraic manipulations and more straightforward solutions. There are cases in which obtaining a direct solution would be all but impossible, yet solving the problem via a thoughtfully chosen integral transform is straightforward.

===Solving non-homogeneous linear recurrence relations with constant coefficients===
If the recurrence is non-homogeneous, a particular solution can be found by the [[method of undetermined coefficients]] and the solution is the sum of the solution of the homogeneous and the particular solutions.  Another method to solve a non-homogeneous recurrence is the method of ''symbolic differentiation''.  For example, consider the following recurrence:

:&lt;math&gt;a_{n+1} = a_{n} + 1&lt;/math&gt;

This is a non-homogeneous recurrence.  If we substitute ''n'' ↦ ''n''+1, we obtain the recurrence

:&lt;math&gt;a_{n+2} = a_{n+1} + 1&lt;/math&gt;

Subtracting the original recurrence from this equation yields

:&lt;math&gt;a_{n+2} - a_{n+1} = a_{n+1} - a_{n}&lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently

:&lt;math&gt;a_{n+2} = 2 a_{n+1} - a_n&lt;/math&gt;

This is a homogeneous recurrence, which can be solved by the methods explained above.  In general, if a linear recurrence has the form

:&lt;math&gt; a_{n+k} = \lambda_{k-1} a_{n+k-1} + \lambda_{k-2} a_{n+k-2} + \cdots + \lambda_1 a_{n+1} + \lambda_0 a_{n} + p(n) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\lambda_0, \lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_{k-1}&lt;/math&gt; are constant coefficients and ''p''(''n'') is the inhomogeneity, then if ''p''(''n'') is a polynomial with degree ''r'', then this non-homogeneous recurrence can be reduced to a homogeneous recurrence by applying the method of symbolic differencing ''r'' times.

If
:&lt;math&gt;P(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty p_n x^n&lt;/math&gt;
is the generating function of the inhomogeneity, the generating function
:&lt;math&gt;A(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a(n) x^n&lt;/math&gt;
of the non-homogeneous recurrence 
:&lt;math&gt; a_n = \sum_{i=1}^s c_i a_{n-i}+p_n,\quad n\ge n_r,&lt;/math&gt;
with constant coefficients {{math|c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is derived from
:&lt;math&gt; \left (1-\sum_{i=1}^sc_ix^i \right )A(x)=P(x)+\sum_{n=0}^{n_r-1}[a_n-p_n]x^n-\sum_{i=1}^s c_ix^i\sum_{n=0}^{n_r-i-1}a_nx^n.&lt;/math&gt;
If ''P''(''x'') is a rational generating function, ''A''(''x'') is also one. The case discussed above, where ''p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''K'' is a constant, emerges as one example of this formula, with ''P''(''x'') = ''K''/(1−''x''). Another example, the recurrence &lt;math&gt;a_n=10 a_{n-1}+n&lt;/math&gt; with linear inhomogeneity, arises in the definition of the [[schizophrenic number]]s. The solution of homogeneous recurrences is incorporated as ''p'' = ''P'' = 0.

===Solving first-order non-homogeneous recurrence relations with variable coefficients===
Moreover, for the general first-order non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation with variable coefficients:

:&lt;math&gt;a_{n+1} = f_n a_n + g_n, \qquad f_n \neq 0,&lt;/math&gt;
there is also a nice method to solve it:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.pccu.edu.tw/%7Emeng/Math15.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705023731/http://faculty.pccu.edu.tw/~meng/Math15.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_{n+1} - f_n a_n = g_n&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a_{n+1}}{\prod_{k=0}^n f_k} - \frac{f_n a_n}{\prod_{k=0}^n f_k} = \frac{g_n}{\prod_{k=0}^n f_k}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a_{n+1}}{\prod_{k=0}^n f_k} - \frac{a_n}{\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} f_k} = \frac{g_n}{\prod_{k=0}^n f_k}&lt;/math&gt;

Let 
:&lt;math&gt;A_n = \frac{a_n}{\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} f_k},&lt;/math&gt;
Then 
:&lt;math&gt;A_{n+1} - A_n = \frac{g_n}{\prod_{k=0}^n f_k}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=0}^{n-1}(A_{m+1} - A_m) = A_n - A_0 = \sum_{m=0}^{n-1}\frac{g_m}{\prod_{k=0}^m f_k}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a_n}{\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} f_k} = A_0 + \sum_{m=0}^{n-1}\frac{g_m}{\prod_{k=0}^m f_k}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_n = \left(\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} f_k \right) \left(A_0 + \sum_{m=0}^{n-1}\frac{g_m}{\prod_{k=0}^m f_k}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

If we apply the formula to &lt;math&gt;a_{n+1} = (1 + h f_{nh}) a_n + hg_{nh}&lt;/math&gt; and take the limit h→0, we get the formula for first order [[linear differential equation]]s with variable coefficients; the sum becomes an integral, and the product becomes the exponential function of an integral.

===Solving general homogeneous linear recurrence relations===
Many homogeneous linear recurrence relations may be solved by means of the [[generalized hypergeometric series]]. Special cases of these lead to recurrence relations for the [[orthogonal polynomials]], and many [[special function]]s. For example, the solution to

:&lt;math&gt;J_{n+1}=\frac{2n}{z}J_n-J_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;

is given by

:&lt;math&gt;J_n=J_n(z), &lt;/math&gt;

the [[Bessel function]], while

:&lt;math&gt;(b-n)M_{n-1} +(2n-b-z)M_n - nM_{n+1}=0 &lt;/math&gt;

is solved by

:&lt;math&gt;M_n=M(n,b;z) &lt;/math&gt;

the [[confluent hypergeometric series]]. Sequences which are the solutions of [[P-recursive equation|linear difference equations with polynomial coefficients]] are called [[Holonomic function|P-recursive]]. For these specific recurrence equations algorithms are known which find [[Polynomial solutions of P-recursive equations|polynomial]], [[Abramov's algorithm|rational]] or [[Petkovšek's algorithm|hypergeometric]] solutions. 

===Solving first-order rational difference equations===
{{Main|Rational difference equation}}

A first order rational difference equation has the form &lt;math&gt;w_{t+1} = \tfrac{aw_t+b}{cw_t+d}&lt;/math&gt;. Such an equation can be solved by writing &lt;math&gt;w_t&lt;/math&gt; as a nonlinear transformation of another variable &lt;math&gt;x_t&lt;/math&gt; which itself evolves linearly.  Then standard methods can be used to solve the linear difference equation in &lt;math&gt;x_t&lt;/math&gt;.

==Stability==

===Stability of linear higher-order recurrences===
The linear recurrence of order ''d'',

:&lt;math&gt;a_n = c_1a_{n-1} + c_2a_{n-2}+\cdots+c_da_{n-d},  &lt;/math&gt;

has the [[Characteristic polynomial|characteristic equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda^d - c_1 \lambda^{d-1} - c_2 \lambda^{d-2} - \cdots - c_d \lambda^0 =0. &lt;/math&gt;

The recurrence is [[Stability theory|stable]], meaning that the iterates converge asymptotically to a fixed value, if and only if the [[eigenvalues]] (i.e., the roots of the characteristic equation), whether real or complex, are all less than [[unity (mathematics)|unity]] in absolute value.

===Stability of linear first-order matrix recurrences===
{{Main|Matrix difference equation}}

In the first-order matrix difference equation

:&lt;math&gt;[x_t - x^*] = A[x_{t-1}-x^*]&lt;/math&gt;

with state vector ''x'' and transition matrix ''A'', ''x'' converges asymptotically to the steady state vector ''x''* if and only if all eigenvalues of the transition matrix ''A'' (whether real or complex) have an [[absolute value]] which is less than&amp;nbsp;1.

===Stability of nonlinear first-order recurrences===
Consider the nonlinear first-order recurrence

:&lt;math&gt;x_n=f(x_{n-1}).&lt;/math&gt;

This recurrence is [[stability theory|locally stable]], meaning that it [[limit of a sequence|converges]] to a fixed point ''x''* from points sufficiently close to ''x''*, if the slope of ''f''  in the neighborhood of ''x''* is smaller than [[unity (mathematics)|unity]] in absolute value:  that is,

: &lt;math&gt;| f' (x^*) | &lt; 1. &lt;/math&gt;

A nonlinear recurrence could have multiple fixed points, in which case some fixed points may be locally stable and others locally unstable; for continuous ''f''  two adjacent fixed points cannot both be locally stable.

A nonlinear recurrence relation could also have a cycle of period ''k'' for ''k'' &gt; 1.  Such a cycle is stable, meaning that it attracts a set of initial conditions of positive measure, if the composite function

:&lt;math&gt;g(x) := f \circ f \circ \cdots \circ f(x)&lt;/math&gt;

with ''f'' appearing ''k'' times is locally stable according to the same criterion:

: &lt;math&gt;| g' (x^*) | &lt; 1,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''x''* is any point on the cycle.

In a [[chaos theory|chaotic]] recurrence relation, the variable ''x'' stays in a bounded region but never converges to a fixed point or an attracting cycle; any fixed points or cycles of the equation are unstable.  See also [[logistic map]], [[dyadic transformation]], and [[tent map]].

== Relationship to differential equations ==
When solving an [[ordinary differential equation]] [[numerical ordinary differential equations|numerically]], one typically encounters a recurrence relation. For example, when solving the [[initial value problem]]

:&lt;math&gt;y'(t) = f(t,y(t)), \ \ y(t_0)=y_0,&lt;/math&gt;

with [[Euler's method]] and a step size ''h'', one calculates the values

:&lt;math&gt;y_0=y(t_0), \ \ y_1=y(t_0+h), \ \ y_2=y(t_0+2h), \ \dots&lt;/math&gt;

by the recurrence

:&lt;math&gt;\, y_{n+1} = y_n + hf(t_n,y_n). &lt;/math&gt;

Systems of linear first order differential equations can be discretized exactly analytically using the methods shown in the [[discretization]] article.

== Applications ==

=== Biology ===
Some of the best-known difference equations have their origins in the attempt to model [[population]] dynamics. For example, the [[Fibonacci number]]s were once used as a model for the growth of a rabbit population.

The [[logistic map]] is used either directly to model population growth, or as a starting point for more detailed models of [[population dynamics]]. In this context, coupled difference equations are often used to model the interaction of two or more populations. For example, the Nicholson-Bailey model for a host-[[parasite]] interaction is given by

:&lt;math&gt;N_{t+1} = \lambda N_t e^{-aP_t} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P_{t+1} = N_t(1-e^{-aP_t}), &lt;/math&gt;

with ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; representing the hosts, and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; the parasites, at time&amp;nbsp;''t''.

[[Integrodifference equation]]s are a form of recurrence relation important to spatial [[ecology]]. These and other difference equations are particularly suited to modeling [[voltinism|univoltine]] populations.

===Computer science===
Recurrence relations are also of fundamental importance in [[analysis of algorithms]].&lt;ref&gt;Cormen, T. et al, ''Introduction to Algorithms'', MIT Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Sedgewick, F. Flajolet, ''An Introduction to the Analysis of Algorithms'', Addison-Wesley, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; If an [[algorithm]] is designed so that it will break a problem into smaller subproblems ([[Divide and conquer algorithm|divide and conquer]]), its running time is described by a recurrence relation.

A simple example is the time an algorithm takes to find an element in an ordered vector with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; elements,  in the worst case.

A naive algorithm will search from left to right, one element at a time. The worst possible scenario is when the required element is the last, so the number of comparisons is &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

A better algorithm is called [[Binary search algorithm|binary search]]. However, it requires a sorted vector. It will first check if the element is at the middle of the vector. If not, then it will check if the middle element is greater or lesser than the sought element. At this point, half of the vector can be discarded, and the algorithm can be run again on the other half. The number of comparisons will be given by

:&lt;math&gt;c_1=1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;c_n=1+c_{n/2}&lt;/math&gt;

the [[Time complexity|time complexity]] of which will be &lt;math&gt;O(\log_2(n))&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Digital signal processing ===
In [[digital signal processing]], recurrence relations can model feedback in a system, where outputs at one time become inputs for future time. They thus arise in [[infinite impulse response]] (IIR) [[digital filter]]s.

For example, the equation for a "feedforward" IIR [[comb filter]] of delay ''T'' is:

:&lt;math&gt;y_t = (1 - \alpha) x_t + \alpha y_{t - T}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;x_t&lt;/math&gt; is the input at time ''t'', &lt;math&gt;y_t&lt;/math&gt; is the output at time ''t'', and α controls how much of the delayed signal is fed back into the output.  From this we can see that

:&lt;math&gt;y_t = (1 - \alpha) x_t + \alpha ((1-\alpha) x_{t-T} + \alpha y_{t - 2T})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y_t = (1 - \alpha) x_t + (\alpha-\alpha^2) x_{t-T}  + \alpha^2 y_{t - 2T})&lt;/math&gt;

etc.

===Economics===
Recurrence relations, especially linear recurrence relations, are used extensively in both theoretical and empirical economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Nancy L. |last=Stokey |authorlink=Nancy Stokey |first2=Robert E., Jr. |last2=Lucas |authorlink2=Robert Lucas, Jr. |first3=Edward C. |last3=Prescott |authorlink3=Edward C.

The model would then be solved for current values of key variables (interest rate, real GDP, etc.) in terms of [[exogeny|exogenous variables]] and lagged [[endogeneity (economics)|endogenous]] variables.  See also [[time series analysis]].

In [[mathematics]], a '''self-similar''' object is exactly or approximately [[similarity (geometry)|similar]] to a part of itself (i.e. the whole has the same shape as one or more of the parts). Many objects in the real world, such as [[coastline]]s, are statistically self-similar: parts of them show the same statistical properties at many scales.&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot_Science_1967"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/156/3775/636 | title=How long is the coast of Britain?

[[Scale invariance]] is an exact form of self-similarity where at any magnification there is a smaller piece of the object that is [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]] to the whole. For instance, a side of the [[Koch snowflake]] is both symmetrical and scale-invariant; it can be continually magnified 3x without changing shape. The non-trivial similarity evident in fractals is distinguished by their fine structure, or detail on arbitrarily small scales. As a [[counterexample]], whereas any portion of a [[straight line]] may resemble the whole, further detail is not revealed.

A time developing phenomenon is said to exhibit self-similarity if the numerical value of certain observable quantity 
&lt;math&gt;f(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; measured at different times are different but the corresponding dimensionless quantity at given value of &lt;math&gt;x/t^z&lt;/math&gt; remain invariant. It happens if the quantity &lt;math&gt;f(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; exhibits [[dynamic scaling]]. The idea is just an extension of the idea of similarity of two triangles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hassan M. K., Hassan M. Z., Pavel N.

==Self-affinity==
&lt;!--[[Self-affinity]] redirects directly here.--&gt;
[[Image:Self-affine set.png|thumb|right| A self-affine fractal with [[Hausdorff dimension]]=1.8272.]]

In [[mathematics]], '''self-affinity''' is a feature of a [[fractal]] whose pieces are [[scaling (geometry)|scaled]] by different amounts in the x- and y-directions. This means that to appreciate the self similarity of these fractal objects, they have to be rescaled using an [[anisotropic]] [[affine transformation]].

==Definition==
A [[Compact space|compact]] [[topological space]] ''X'' is self-similar if there exists a [[finite set]] ''S'' indexing a set of non-[[surjective]] [[homeomorphism]]s &lt;math&gt;\{ f_s : s\in S \}&lt;/math&gt; for which

:&lt;math&gt;X=\bigcup_{s\in S} f_s(X)&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;X\subset Y&lt;/math&gt;, we call ''X'' self-similar if it is the only [[Non-empty set|non-empty]] [[subset]] of ''Y'' such that the equation above holds for &lt;math&gt;\{ f_s : s\in S \} &lt;/math&gt;. We call

:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{L}=(X,S,\{ f_s : s\in S \} )&lt;/math&gt;

a ''self-similar structure''. The homeomorphisms may be [[iterated function|iterated]], resulting in an [[iterated function system]]. The composition of functions creates the algebraic structure of a [[monoid]]. When the set ''S'' has only two elements, the monoid is known as the [[dyadic monoid]]. The dyadic monoid can be visualized as an infinite [[binary tree]]; more generally, if the set ''S'' has ''p'' elements, then the monoid may be represented as a [[p-adic number|p-adic]] tree.

The [[automorphism]]s of the dyadic monoid is the [[modular group]]; the automorphisms can be pictured as [[Hyperbolic coordinates|hyperbolic rotation]]s of the binary tree.

A more general notion than self-similarity is [[Self-affinity]].

==Examples==
[[Image:Feigenbaumzoom.gif|left|thumb|201px|Self-similarity in the [[Mandelbrot set]] shown by zooming in on the Feigenbaum point at (−1.401155189...,&amp;nbsp;0)]]
[[Image:Fractal fern explained.png|thumb|right|300px|An image of the Barnsley fern which exhibits [[affine transformation|affine]] self-similarity]]

The [[Mandelbrot set]] is also self-similar around [[Misiurewicz point]]s.

Self-similarity has important consequences for the design of computer networks, as typical network traffic has self-similar properties. For example, in [[teletraffic engineering]], [[packet switched]] data traffic patterns seem to be statistically self-similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leland|first1=W.E.|last2=Taqqu|first2=M.S.|last3=Willinger|first3=W.|last4=Wilson|first4=D.V.|display-authors=2|title=On the self-similar nature of Ethernet traffic (extended version)|journal=IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking|date=January 1995|volume=2|issue=1|pages=1–15|doi=10.1109/90.282603|url=http://ccr.sigcomm.org/archive/1995/jan95/ccr-9501-leland.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This property means that simple models using a [[Poisson distribution]] are inaccurate, and networks designed without taking self-similarity into account are likely to function in unexpected ways.

Similarly, [[stock market]] movements are described as displaying [[self-affinity]], i.e. they appear self-similar when transformed via an appropriate [[affine transformation]] for the level of detail being shown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/multifractals-explain-wall-street/ | title=How Fractals Can Explain What's Wrong with Wall Street | author=Benoit Mandelbrot | publisher=Scientific American|

[[Finite subdivision rules]] are a powerful technique for building self-similar sets, including the [[Cantor set]] and the [[Sierpinski triangle]].

=== In [[cybernetics]] ===
The [[Viable System Model]] of [[Stafford Beer]] is an organizational model with an affine self-similar hierarchy, where a given viable system is one element of the System One of a viable system one recursive level higher up, and for whom the elements of its System One are viable systems one recursive level lower down.

=== In nature ===

{{further information|patterns in nature}}
Self-similarity can be found in nature, as well. To the right is a mathematically generated, perfectly self-similar image of a [[fern]], which bears a marked resemblance to natural ferns. Other plants, such as [[Romanesco broccoli]], exhibit strong self-similarity.

=== In music ===
* Strict [[canon (music)|canons]] display various types and amounts of self-similarity, as do sections of [[fugue (music)|fugues]].
* A [[Shepard tone]] is self-similar in the frequency or wavelength domains.
* The [[Denmark|Danish]] [[composer]] [[Per Nørgård]] has made use of a self-similar [[integer sequence]] named the 'infinity series' in much of his music.
* In the research field of [[music information retrieval]], self-similarity commonly refers to the fact that music often consists of parts that are repeated in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Foote |first1=Jonathan |title=Visualizing music and audio using self-similarity |journal=Multimedia '99 Proceedings of the seventh ACM international conference on Multimedia (Part 1) |date=30 October 1999 |page=77-80 |doi=10.1145/319463.319472 |url=http://musicweb.ucsd.edu/~sdubnov/CATbox/Reader/p77-foote.pdf |dead-url=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809032554/http://musicweb.ucsd.edu/~sdubnov/CATbox/Reader/p77-foote.pdf |archivedate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, music is self-similar under temporal translation, rather than (or in addition to) under scaling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pareyon |first1=Gabriel |title=On Musical Self-Similarity: Intersemiosis as Synecdoche and Analogy |date=April 2011 |publisher=International Semiotics Institute at Imatra; Semiotic Society of Finland |isbn=978-952-5431-32-2 |page=240 |url=https://tuhat.helsinki.fi/portal/files/15216101/Pareyon_Dissertation.pdf |accessdate=30 July 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208034152/https://tuhat.helsinki.fi/portal/files/15216101/Pareyon_Dissertation.pdf |archivedate=8 February 2017}} (Also see [https://books.google.com/books?id=xQIynayPqMQC&amp;pg=PA240&amp;lpg=PA240&amp;focus=viewport&amp;vq=%221/f+noise+substantially+as+a+temporal+phenomenon%22 Google Books])&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10172">The '''significand''' (also '''mantissa''' or '''coefficient''', sometimes also '''argument''' or '''fraction''')&lt;ref name="Savard_2005"/&gt; is part of a number in [[scientific notation]] or a [[floating point|floating-point number]], consisting of its [[significant digit]]s.  Depending on the interpretation of the [[exponent]], the significand may represent an [[integer]] or a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]]. The word ''mantissa'' seems to have been introduced by [[Arthur Burks]] in 1946&lt;ref name="Burks_1946"/&gt; writing for the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] at [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], although this use of the word is discouraged by the [[IEEE floating-point standard]] committee{{citation needed|reason=It seems the only evidence for this statement is anecdotal from user mfc on the talk page|date=September 2017}} as well as some professionals such as the creator of the standard, [[William Kahan]].&lt;ref name="Kahan_2002"/&gt;

==Example==

The number 123.45 can be represented as a [[decimal]] floating-point number with the integer 12345 as the significand and a 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; power term, also called [[characteristic (exponent notation)|characteristic]]s,&lt;ref name="Burks_1946"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schmid_1974"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schmid_1983"/&gt; where −2 is the exponent (and 10 is the base). Its value is given by the following arithmetic:

: 123.45 = 12345 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.

This same value can also be represented in [[scientific notation|normalized form]] with 1.2345 as the fractional coefficient, and +2 as the exponent (and 10 as the base):

: 123.45 = 1'''.'''2345 × 10&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Schmid, however, called this representation with a significand ranging between 1.0 and 10 a '''modified normalized form'''.&lt;ref name="Schmid_1974"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schmid_1983"/&gt;

For base 2, this 1.xxxx form is also called a '''normalized significand'''.

Finally, the value can be represented in the format given by the [[Language Independent Arithmetic]] standard and several programming language standards, including [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[C (programming language)|C]], [[Fortran]] and [[Modula-2]], as

: 123.45 = 0'''.'''12345 × 10&lt;sup&gt;+3&lt;/sup&gt;.

Schmid called this representation with a significand ranging between 0.1 and 1.0 the '''true normalized form'''.&lt;ref name="Schmid_1974"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schmid_1983"/&gt;

This later 0.xxxx form is called a '''normed significand'''.

==Significands and the hidden bit==

For a [[normalized number]], the most significant digit is always non-zero.  When working in [[binary number system|binary]], this uniquely determines this digit to always be 1; as such, it doesn't need to be explicitly stored, being called the ''[[hidden bit]]''.  The significand is characterized by its width in ([[binary digits|binary]]) digits, and depending on the context, the hidden bit may or may not be counted towards the width of the significand.  For example, the same [[IEEE 754]] [[double-precision]] format is commonly described as having either a 53-bit significand, including the hidden bit, or a 52-bit significand, excluding the hidden bit.  IEEE 754 defines the precision ''p'' to be the number of digits in the significand, including any implicit leading bit (e.g., ''p'' = 53 for the double-precision format).

==Use of "mantissa"==

In American English, the original word for this seems to have been ''mantissa'' ([[Arthur Burks|Burks]]&lt;ref name="Burks_1946"/&gt; ''et al.''), and this usage remains common in computing and among [[computer science|computer scientists]]. However, the term ''significand'' was introduced by [[George Elmer Forsythe|George Forsythe]] and [[Cleve Barry Moler|Cleve Moler]] in 1967,&lt;ref name="Forsythe_Moler_1967"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sterbenz_1974"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldberg_1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Savard_2005"/&gt; and the use of ''mantissa'' for this purpose is discouraged by the [[IEEE floating-point standard]] committee{{citation needed|reason=It seems the only evidence for this statement is anecdotal from user mfc on the talk page|date=September 2017}} and by some professionals such as [[William Kahan]]&lt;ref name="Kahan_2002"/&gt; and [[Donald Knuth]], because it conflicts with the pre-existing use of ''mantissa'' for the [[fractional part]] of a [[logarithm]] (see also [[common logarithm]]). For instance, Knuth adopts the third representation 0'''.'''12345 × 10&lt;sup&gt;+3&lt;/sup&gt; in the example above and calls 0'''.'''12345 the ''fraction'' part of the number; he adds:&lt;ref name="Knuth_1969"/&gt; "it is an abuse of terminology to call the fraction part a mantissa, since this concept has quite a different meaning in connection with logarithms".

The confusion is because scientific notation and floating-point representation are log-linear, not logarithmic. To multiply two numbers, given their logarithms, one just adds the characteristic (integer part) and the mantissa (fractional part). By contrast, to multiply two floating-point numbers, one adds the exponent (which is logarithmic) and ''multiplies'' the significand (which is linear).

==Statement==
Let {''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}, {''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} be sequences of scalar/vector/matrix [[random element]]s.

If  ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; converges in distribution to a random element ''X'';

and ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; converges in probability to a constant ''c'', then
* &lt;math&gt;X_n + Y_n \ \xrightarrow{d}\ X + c ;&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;X_nY_n \ \xrightarrow{d}\ cX ;&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;X_n/Y_n \ \xrightarrow{d}\ X/c,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; provided that ''c'' is invertible,

where &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow{d}&lt;/math&gt; denotes [[convergence in distribution]].

'''Notes:'''
# The requirement that ''Y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' converges to a constant is important — if it were to converge to a non-degenerate random variable, the theorem would be no longer valid. For example, let &lt;math&gt;X_n \sim {\rm Uniform}(0,1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y_n = -X_n&lt;/math&gt;.  The sum &lt;math&gt;X_n + Y_n = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all values of ''n''.  Moreover, &lt;math&gt;Y_n \xrightarrow{d} {\rm Uniform}(-1,0)&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;X_n + Y_n&lt;/math&gt; does not converge in distribution to &lt;math&gt;X + Y&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;X \sim {\rm Uniform}(0,1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y \sim {\rm Uniform}(-1,0)&lt;/math&gt;.  (See [http://www.bios.unc.edu/~dzeng/BIOS760/ChapC_Slide Slide 59].)
# The theorem remains valid if we replace all convergences in distribution with convergences in probability (due to [[Convergence of random variables#propB4|this property]]).

==Proof==
This theorem follows from the fact that if ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; converges in distribution to ''X'' and ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; converges in probability to a constant ''c'', then the joint vector (''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) converges in distribution to (''X'',&amp;nbsp;''c'') ([[Convergence of random variables#propB3|see here]]).

Next we apply the [[continuous mapping theorem]], recognizing the functions ''g''(''x'',''y'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y'', ''g''(''x'',''y'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''xy'', and ''g''(''x'',''y'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x'' ''y''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; as continuous (for the last function to be continuous, ''y'' has to be invertible).

'''Structured criticality''' is a property of [[complex systems]] in which small events may trigger larger events due to subtle interdependencies between elements. This often gives rise to a form of stratified [[chaos theory|chaos]] where the general behavior of the system can be modeled on one scale while smaller- and larger-scale behaviors remain unpredictable.

'''For example:'''

Consider a pile of sand. If you drop one grain of sand on top of this pile every second, the pile will continue to grow in the shape of a cone. The general shape, size, and growth of this cone is fairly easy to model as a function of the rate at which new sand grains are added, the size and shape of the grains, and the number of grains in the pile.

The pile retains its shape because occasionally a new grain of sand will trigger an avalanche which causes some number of grains to slide down the side of the cone into new positions. 

These avalanches are chaotic. It is nearly impossible to predict if the next grain of sand will cause an avalanche, where that avalanche will occur on the pile, how many grains of sand will be involved in the event, and so on. 

However, the aggregate behavior of avalanches can be modeled statistically with some accuracy. For example, you can reasonably predict the frequency of avalanche events of different sizes.

The avalanches are caused when the impact of a new grain of sand is sufficient to dislodge some group of sand grains. If that group is dislodged then its motion may be sufficient to cause a [[cascading failure|cascade failure]] in some neighboring groups, while other groups that are nearby may be strong enough to absorb the energy of the event without being disturbed.

Each group of sand grains can be thought of as a sub-system with its own state, and each sub-system can be made up of other sub-systems, and so on. In this way you can imagine the sand pile as a complex system made up of sub-systems ultimately made up of individual grains of sand (yet another sub-system). Each of these sub-systems are more or less likely to suffer a cascade failure. Those that are likely to fail and reorganize can be said to be in a '''critical''' state.

Put another way, the likelihood that any particular sub-system will fail (or experience a particular event) can be called its '''criticality'''. (See: [[Self-organized criticality]])

So then, the pile of sand can be viewed as a network of interconnected systems, each with its own criticality. The relationships between these groups impose a structure on this network which has a profound effect on the probability and scope of a cascade failure in response to some other event. In other words - '''structured criticality'''.

Structured criticality is found just about everywhere. Some other examples are:

* Landslides.
* Lightning strikes.
* Earthquakes.
* The knots that appear on a twisted rubber band in a model airplane as the propeller is wound up.
* Rouge Waves

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1929">In [[additive combinatorics]] and [[additive number theory|number theory]], a subset ''A'' of an [[abelian group]] ''G'' is said to be '''sum-free''' if the [[sumset]] ''A''⊕''A'' is disjoint from ''A''. In other words, ''A'' is sum-free if the equation &lt;math&gt;a + b = c&lt;/math&gt; has no solution with &lt;math&gt;a,b,c \in A&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, the set of [[Even and odd numbers|odd numbers]] is a sum-free subset of the integers, and the set {''N''+1, ..., 2''N''} forms a large sum-free subset of the set {1,...,2''N''}. [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] is the statement that, for a given integer ''n'' &gt; 2, the set of all nonzero ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; powers of the integers is a sum-free subset.

Some basic questions that have been asked about sum-free sets are:

* How many sum-free subsets of {1, ..., ''N''} are there, for an integer ''N''? [[Ben J. Green|Ben Green]] has shown&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Ben |last=Green |arxiv=math.NT/0304058 |title=The Cameron–Erdős conjecture |journal=Bulletin of the [[London Mathematical Society]] |volume=36 |issue=6 |date=November 2004 |pages=769–778 | doi=10.1112/S0024609304003650 |mr=2083752}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the answer is &lt;math&gt;O(2^{N/2})&lt;/math&gt;, as predicted by the [[Cameron–Erdős conjecture]]&lt;ref&gt;P.J. Cameron and P. Erdős, ''On the number of sets of integers with various properties'', Number theory (Banff, 1988), de Gruyter, Berlin 1990, pp.61-79&lt;/ref&gt; (see Sloane's {{OEIS2C|id=A007865}}).
* How many sum-free sets does an abelian group ''G'' contain?&lt;ref name="abelian"&gt;Ben Green and Imre Ruzsa, [http://www.arxiv.org/pdf/math.CO/0307142 Sum-free sets in abelian groups], 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* What is the size of the largest sum-free set that an abelian group ''G'' contains?&lt;ref name="abelian" /&gt;

A sum-free set is said to be '''maximal''' if it is not a [[proper subset]] of another sum-free set.
