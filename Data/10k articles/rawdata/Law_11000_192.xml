      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23960">An '''amnesty law''' is any law that [[Ex post facto law|retroactively]] [[amnesty|exempts]] a select group of people, usually military leaders and government leaders, from criminal liability for crimes committed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crimesofwar.org/thebook/amnesty.html Amnesty] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121075359/http://www.crimesofwar.org/thebook/amnesty.html |date=November 21, 2010 }} By William Bourdon, [[Crimes of War Project]], The Book&lt;/ref&gt;
Most allegations involve [[human rights abuse]]s and [[crimes against humanity]].

==History==
Many countries have been plagued by [[revolution]]s, [[coups]] and [[civil war]]. After such turmoil the leaders of the outgoing regime that want, or are forced, to restore democracy in their country are confronted with possible litigation regarding the "[[counterinsurgency]]" actions taken during their reign. It is not uncommon for people to make allegations of [[human rights abuse]] and [[crimes against humanity]]. To overcome the hazard of facing prosecution, many countries have absolved those involved of their alleged crimes.

Amnesty laws are often also equally problematic to the opposing side as a cost-benefit problem: Is bringing the old leadership to justice worth extending the conflict or rule of the previous regime, with an accompanying increase in suffering and casualties, as the old regime refuses to let go of power?

Victims, their families and [[human rights]] organisations—''e.g.,'' [[Amnesty International]], [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Humanitarian Law Project]]—have opposed such laws through [[Madres de la Plaza de Mayo|demonstrations]] and litigation, their argument being that an amnesty law violates local [[constitutional law]] and [[international law]] by upholding [[impunity]].

Providing [[amnesty]] for “international crimes”—which include [[crimes against humanity]], [[war crimes]] and [[genocide]]—is increasingly considered to be prohibited by [[international law]]. This understanding is drawn from the obligations set out in [[human rights]] [[treaties]], the decisions of international and regional courts and the law emerging from long-standing state practice (customary international law). International, regional and national courts have increasingly overturned general amnesties. And recent peace agreements have largely avoided granting amnesty for serious crimes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/pursuing-peace-justice-or-both "Pursuing Peace, Justice or Both?"], ''[[International Center for Transitional Justice]] (ICTJ)''&lt;/ref&gt; With that in mind, the [[International Criminal Court]] was established to ensure that perpetrators do not evade [[command responsibility]] for their crimes should the local government fail to prosecute.

The [[Belfast Guidelines on Amnesty and Accountability]] set out a framework to evaluate the legality and legitimacy of amnesties in accordance with the multiple legal obligations faced by states undergoing conflict or political transition.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.transitionaljustice.ulster.ac.uk/TransitionalJusticeInstitute.htmAmnestyGuidelinesProject.htm&lt;/ref&gt; They have been collectively authored by a group of international human rights and conflict resolution experts led by Louise Mallinder and Tom Hadden at the [[Transitional Justice Institute]].

===Afghanistan===
{{main article|Human rights in Afghanistan|Invasions of Afghanistan|Operation Enduring Freedom|War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War on Terror}}

Afghanistan has adopted a law precluding prosecution for war crimes committed in conflicts in previous decades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/pp0317.7.shtml AFGHANISTAN: AMNESTY LAW DRAWS CRITICISM, PRAISE] by Ron Synovitz, [[EurasiaNet]], 3/17/07&lt;/ref&gt;

The Afghan government adopted the Action Plan for Peace, Justice, and Reconciliation in December 2005, and hotly debated the plan’s focus on criminal [[accountability]]. Later, Parliament adopted a bill that provided a nearly blanket [[amnesty]] for all those involved in the Afghan conflict.

The drafting of the amnesty bill was pioneered by some of the former commanders known to have committed [[human rights]] abuses and who felt threatened by the sudden emphasis on accountability. 
Although this bill was never formally recognized as law, it has had major political significance, serving as a clear signal of some human rights violators’ continuing power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/transitional-justice-context-ongoing-conflict-case-afghanistan "Transitional Justice in the Context of Ongoing Conflict: the Case of Afghanistan"] by Sari Kouvo, ''[[International Center for Transitional Justice]] (ICTJ)''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Algeria===
{{main article|Algerian Civil War|List of Algerian massacres of the 1990s|Military history of Algeria|History of Algeria}}

A decree by the President in 2006 makes prosecution impossible for human rights abuses, and even muzzle open debate by criminalizing public discussion about the nation's decade-long conflict.&lt;ref&gt;

===Argentina===
{{further|Ley de Punto Final|Ley de Obediencia Debida|Madres de la Plaza de Mayo|Dirty War|Operation Condor|National Commission for Forced Disappearances}}

The [[Comisión Nacional sobre la Desaparición de Personas|National Commission for Forced Disappearances]] (CONADEP), led by writer [[Ernesto Sabato]], was created in 1983. Two years later, the ''[[Juicio a las Juntas]]'' (Trial of the Juntas) largely succeeded in proving the crimes of the various ''juntas'' which had formed the self-styled [[National Reorganization Process]]. Most of the top officers who were tried were sentenced to [[life imprisonment]]: [[Jorge Rafael Videla]], [[Emilio Eduardo Massera]], [[Roberto Eduardo Viola]], [[Armando Lambruschini]], [[Raúl Agosti]], [[Rubén Graffigna]], [[Leopoldo Galtieri]], [[Jorge Anaya]] and [[Basilio Lami Dozo]]. However, [[Raúl Alfonsín]]'s government voted two [[amnesty]] laws in order to avoid the escalation of trials against militaries involved in human rights abuses: the 1986 ''[[Ley de Punto Final]]'' and the 1987 ''[[Ley de Obediencia Debida]]''. President [[Carlos Menem]] then [[pardon]]ed the leaders of the ''junta'' and the surviving commanders of the armed leftist guerrilla organizations in 1989–1990. Following persistent activism by the [[Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo]] and other associations, the amnesty laws were overturned by the [[Supreme Court of Argentina|Argentine Supreme Court]] nearly twenty years later, in June 2005. However, the ruling wasn't applied to the guerrilla leaders, who remained at large.

===Benin===
In the 1980s, incompetent economic management and ballooning domestic graft, including the draining of funds from parastatals, combined with a continent-wide economic crisis, effectively bankrupted the economy. The government turned to the Bretton Woods institutions for support, which required the implementation of unpopular economic austerity measures. In 1988, when France refused to meet the budgetary shortfall, the three main banks, all state-owned, collapsed and the government was unable to pay teachers, civil servants and soldiers their salaries, nor students their grants. This caused domestic opposition to mushroom, rendering the country ‘virtually ungovernable’.20 The World Bank and the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF) refused to provide emergency assistance because of Benin’s failure to adhere to prior agreements.21 Kérékou convened a national conference to discuss the country’s future course, bringing together representatives of all sectors of Beninese society, including ‘teachers, students, the military, government officials, religious authorities, non-governmental organizations, more than 50 political parties, ex-presidents, labor unions, business interests, farmers, and dozens of local development organizations’.22 Kérékou believed that he could retain control of the 488 delegates. Instead, when it met in February 1990, the convention declared itself sovereign, redefined the powers of the presidency, reducing Kérékou to a figurehead role, and appointed Nicéphore Soglo, a former World Bank staff member, to act as executive prime minister. In exchange for a full pardon for any crimes he may have committed, Kérékou peacefully ceded power. By March 1991, the Beninese electorate had ratified a new constitution and democratically elected Soglo president.&lt;ref&gt;From B. A. Magnusson, ‘Testing Democracy in Benin: Experiments in Institutional Reform’, in R Joseph (ed.), State, Conflict and Democracy in Africa, Boulder: Lynne Rienner, 1999, p 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
{{main article|Operation Condor|History of Brazil}}

In 1979, [[Brazilian military government|Brazil’s military dictatorship]]—which suppressed young [[political activists]] and trade unionists—passed an [[amnesty]] law. This law allowed exiled activists to return, but was also used to shield [[human rights]] violators from [[prosecution]]. Perpetrators of human rights abuses during Brazil’s 1964 to 1985 military dictatorship have yet to face [[criminal justice]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/our-work/regions-and-countries/brazil Brazil] ''[[International Center for Transitional Justice]] (ICTJ)''&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2010, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights declared Brazil’s amnesty law illegal because of the provisions that “prevent the investigation and punishment of serious human rights violations” and ordered the nation to begin exploring the gross human rights violations of the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Filho|first=Paulo Coelho|title=Truth Commission in Brazil: Individualizing Amnesty, Revealing the Truth|journal=The Yale Review of International Studies|date=Feb 2012|url=http://yris.yira.org/essays/440|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
On April 9, 2014, a bill (#237/2013) that would modify this law to exclude human rights violations committed by state agents was approved by the Brazilian senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sardinha |first=Edson |title=Comissão aprova revisão da Lei da Anistia |url=http://www.brasildefato.com.br/node/28096 |accessdate=April 11, 2014 |newspaper=Brasil de Fato |date=April 10, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502032618/http://www.brasildefato.com.br/node/28096 |archivedate=May 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chile===
{{main article|1973 Chilean coup d'état|Operation Condor|U.S. intervention in Chile|National Commission on Political Imprisonment and Torture|National Truth and Reconciliation Commission|History of Chile}}

When [[Augusto Pinochet]] was arrested in London as part of a failed [[extradition]] to Spain, which was demanded by magistrate [[Baltasar Garzón]], a bit more information concerning Condor was revealed. One of the lawyers who asked for his extradition talked about an attempt to assassinate [[Carlos Altamirano]], leader of the [[Chilean Socialist Party]]: Pinochet would have met Italian terrorist [[Stefano Delle Chiaie]] in Madrid in 1975, during [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s funeral, in order to have him murdered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.derechos.org/sorin/doc/p2.html Las Relaciones Secretas entre Pinochet, Franco y la [[Propaganda Due|P2]] - Conspiracion para matar], [[Equipo Nizkor]], February 4, 1999 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; But as with [[Bernardo Leighton]], who was shot in Rome in 1975 after a meeting the same year in Madrid between Stefano Delle Chiaie, [[Michael Townley]] and anti-Castrist [[Virgilio Paz Romero]], the plan ultimately failed.

Chilean judge [[Juan Guzmán Tapia]] would eventually make [[jurisprudence]] concerning "permanent kidnapping" crime: since the bodies of the victims could not be found, he deemed that the kidnapping may be said to continue, therefore refusing to grant to the military the benefices of the statute of limitation. This helped indict Chilean militaries who were benefitting from a 1978 self-amnesty decree.

===Democratic Republic of the Congo===
{{main article|First Congo War|Second Congo War|Democratic Republic of the Congo}}

In November 2005 an amnesty law was adopted regarding offences committed between August 1996 and June 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=57408 Amnesty law passed without MPs from Kabila's party] by IRIN, the humanitarian news and analysis service of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Joseph Kabila]] put an Amnesty Law into effect in May 2009. This law forgives combatants for war-related violence in the eastern provinces of North and South Kivu committed between June 2003 and May 2009 – excluding [[genocide]], [[war crimes]] international [[crimes against humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanpress.wordpress.com/2009/06/19/congo-drc-militias-decry-kivu-amnesty-law/ "Congo DRC: Militias decry Kivu amnesty law"]''African Press International (API)''&lt;/ref&gt; Although of limited temporal and geographic scope, by granting [[amnesty]] for many crimes perpetuated by [[rebel groups]], Congolese armed forces, [[militias]], and [[police]], there is a risk that the law may perpetuate the DRC’s culture of [[impunity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/amnesty-must-not-equal-impunity "Amnesty Must Not Equal Impunity"]''[[International Center for Transitional Justice]] (ICTJ)''&lt;/ref&gt;

===El Salvador===
{{main article|Salvadoran civil war|Commission on the Truth for El Salvador}}

Following the twelve-year-long civil war an amnesty law was passed in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=37088 Amnesty Law Biggest Obstacle to Human Rights, Say Activists] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205045538/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=37088 |date=2012-02-05 }} by Raúl Gutiérrez, [[Inter Press Service News Agency]], May 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The law modified a previous amnesty law which was passed in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://elliott.gwu.edu/sites/elliott.gwu.edu/files/downloads/acad/lahs/el-salvador-amnesty-2013.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919230753/https://elliott.gwu.edu/sites/elliott.gwu.edu/files/downloads/acad/lahs/el-salvador-amnesty-2013.pdf |archive-date=2016-09-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, however, the amnesty law was overturned by the El Salvador Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;https://ilg2.org/2016/07/19/el-salvadors-constitutional-court-invalidates-amnesty-law-will-prosecutions-follow/&lt;/ref&gt;

===England===

The [[Indemnity and Oblivion Act]] was passed in 1660, as part of rebuilding during the [[English Restoration]] after the [[English Civil War]]. It was jokingly referred to as producing "indemnity for the King's enemies and oblivion for the King's friends".

The so-called "[[Alan Turing law]]" is a proposed amnesty law for men convicted of consensual homosexual sex prior to the passing of the [[Sexual Offences Act 1967]]. The Government has announced that the amnesty will be introduced in [[England and Wales]] as an amendment to the [[Policing and Crime Bill 2016]].&lt;ref name="BBC-pardon"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-37711518|title='Alan Turing law': Thousands of gay men to be pardoned|date=20 October 2016|accessdate=20 October 2016|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lebanon===
{{main article|Lebanese Civil War}}

An amnesty law for crimes perpetrated before March 28, 1991, was enacted in 1991&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engMDE180092005?open&amp;of=eng-LBN Lebanon: Mass Graves - Exhumations must be in line with international standards, and perpetrators brought to justice] by [[Amnesty International]], December 5, 2005 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070422121747/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGMDE180092005?open&amp;of=ENG-LBN |date=April 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; after which the militias (with the important exception of [[Hezbollah]]) were dissolved, and the [[Lebanese Armed Forces]] began to slowly rebuild themselves as Lebanon's only major non-sectarian institution.

===Paraguay===
{{main article|Operation Condor|History of Paraguay}}

===Peru===
{{main article|Internal conflict in Peru|Peruvian Constitutional Crisis of 1992}}

On 14 June 1995, President [[Alberto Fujimori]] signed a bill granting amnesty for any human rights abuses or other criminal acts committed from May 1982 to 14 June 1995 as part of the counterinsurgency war by military, police, and civilians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freelori.org/groups/nacla/95sep_nacla.html The New Amnesty Law in Peru] by [[NACLA Report on the Americas]] (Sept/Oct 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

The amnesty laws created a new challenge for the [[human rights]] movement in [[Peru]]. They thwarted the demands for [[truth]] and [[justice]] that thousands of family members of victims of [[political violence]] have been making since the 1980s. Thus, after the fall of [[Alberto Fujimori]] in 2001, the [[Inter-American Court]] ruled that the amnesty laws 26.479 and 26.492 were invalid because they were incompatible with the [[American Convention on Human Rights]]. The court later specified that the ruling was applicable to all Peruvian cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/legacy-truth-criminal-justice-peruvian-transition The Legacy of Truth: Criminal Justice in the Peruvian Transition], ''[[International Center for Transitional Justice]] (ICTJ)''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sierra Leone===
{{main article|Lomé Peace Accord}}

On 7 July 1999, the "Lomé Peace Agreement" was signed. Along with a cease-fire agreement between the government of [[Alhaji Ahmad Tejan Kabbah]] and the [[Revolutionary United Front]] (RUF) it contained proposals to "expunge responsibility for all offences including international crimes, otherwise known as [[delict jus gentium]] such as crimes against humanity, war crimes, genocide, torture and other serious violations of international humanitarian law."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-potsdam.de/u/mrz/mrm/mrm13-1.htm Is the Sierra Leonean Amnesty Law Compatible with International Law?] by Phenyo Keiseng Rakate, MenschenRechtsMagazin Heft 3 / 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
{{main article|Apartheid|Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)}}

Following the end of [[apartheid]] [[South Africa]] decided not to prosecute but instead created the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] (TRC). Its aim was to investigate and elucidate the crimes committed during the apartheid regime while not indicting in an attempt to make the alleged perpetrators more compliant to cooperate.

The TRC offered of “amnesty for truth” to perpetrators of [[human rights abuses]] during the apartheid era. This enabled abusers to confess their actions to the TRC in order to be granted [[amnesty]]. It aroused much controversy in the country and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/our-work/regions-and-countries/south-africa South Africa], ''[[International Center for Transitional Justice]] (ICTJ)''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===
{{main article|Spanish transition to democracy|Relations of the Suárez government with the opposition}}

In 1977, the first democratic government elected after Franco's death passed the [[Law 46/1977, of amnesty]], which exempted of responsibility to everyone who committed any offence for political reasons prior to this date. This law allowed the commutation of sentences of those accused to attack the dictatorship and secured that those crimes committed during the Francoism would not be prosecuted.

===United States===
{{main article|Military Commissions Act of 2006|War on Terror}}

During the [[War on Terror]], the [[United States]] enacted the [[Military Commissions Act of 2006]] in an attempt to regulate the legal procedures involving [[illegal combatant]]s. Part of the act was an amendment which retroactively rewrote the [[War Crimes Act of 1996|War Crimes Act]] effectively making [[Bush Doctrine|policy makers]] (i.e., [[George W. Bush administration|politicians]] and [[List of United States military leaders by rank|military leaders]]) and those [[Commanding officer|applying policy]] (i.e., [[CIA]] [[interrogation|interrogators]] and [[U.S. Army|U.S. soldiers]]) no longer subject to legal prosecution under U.S. law for acts defined as war crimes before the amendment was passed.&lt;ref&gt;No longer punishable under U.S. law

{{Constitutions of Poland}}
'''April Novelization''' ({{lang-pl|Nowela kwietniowa}}) refers to the changes ([[constitutional amendment]]s) to the 1952 [[Constitution of the People's Republic of Poland]], agreed in April 1989, in the aftermath of the [[Polish Round Table Agreement]].

Among key changes were:
*restoration of the [[Senate of Poland]] and the post of the [[president of Poland]] (the latter annulling the power of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] [[general secretary]])
*introduction of the [[National Council of the Judiciary]] (''Krajowa Rada Sądownictwa'')
*changes to the electoral legislation, in order to make elections more free and fair
*powers of the [[Sejm]] were adjusted

The 1952 constitution would be even further reformed by the [[December Novelization]] and [[Small Constitution of 1992]], and finally replaced in 1997 by a completely new current [[Constitution of Poland]].

'''''Julian Assange v Swedish Prosecution Authority''''' were the set of legal proceedings in the [[United Kingdom]] concerning the requested extradition of [[Julian Assange]] to [[Sweden]] to further a 'preliminary investigation'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2010/09/sweden-reopens-possible-rape-case-against-wikileaks-founder-julian-assange/1|title=Sweden reopens rape investigation against Wikileaks founder Julian Assange|publisher=[[USA Today]]|author=Douglas Stanglin|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; into accusations of his having committed sexual offences. The proceedings began in 2012 and on 12 August 2015, Swedish prosecutors announced that they would drop their investigation into three of the allegations against Assange, because of the expiration of the statute of limitations. The investigation into the allegation of rape, as of 19 May 2017, has been dropped by Swedish authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.democracynow.org/2017/5/19/human_rights_lawyer_sweden_dropping_investigation|title=Human Rights Lawyer: Sweden Dropping Investigation of WikiLeaks' Assange is "Long Overdue Decision"|last=Avila|first=Renata|date=19 May 2017|work=[[Democracy Now!]]|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="emergence"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/19/sweden-drops-julian-assange-rape-investigation/|title=Julian Assange emerges on embassy balcony to say he will not 'forgive or forget' as Swedish rape investigation is dropped|first1=James|last1=Rothwell|first2=Victoria|last2=Ward|first3=Helen|last3=Nianias|publisher=The Telegraph|date=2017-05-19|accessdate=2017-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; A disputed issue over the course of the legal proceedings was the claimed fear that Assange could ultimately be extradited to [[United States|United States of America]] should he be sent to Sweden. The [[United Nations]] [[Working Group on Arbitrary Detention]] has stated that "the various forms of deprivation of liberty to which Julian Assange has been subjected constitute a form of arbitrary detention", calling for the case to be closed and Assange to be allowed to walk free.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/nov/30/un-panel-upholds-decision-julian-assanges-detainme/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.firstpost.com/world/britain-sweden-should-accept-ruling-on-julian-assange-un-high-commissioner-for-human-rights-2618960.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Swedish investigation==

===Complaints and initial investigation===
On 20 August 2010, two women, a 26-year-old living in [[Enköping]] and a 31-year-old living in [[Stockholm]],&lt;ref name=Cody&gt;{{cite news |title=WikiLeaks stalled by Swedish inquiry into allegations of rape by founder Assange |first=Edward |last=Cody |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/08/AR2010090803240_pf.html |work=The Washington Post |date=9 September 2010 |accessdate=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=india&gt;{{cite news |title=Sex accusers boasted about their 'conquest' of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-12-09/us/28247531_1_wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-swedish-women-condom |work=The Times of India |date=9 December 2009 |accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; jointly went to the [[Swedish police]] not seeking to bring charges against Assange but in order to track him down and persuade him to be tested for sexually transmitted diseases after their separate sexual encounters with him.&lt;ref name=std&gt;{{cite news|last=Hosenball |first=Mark |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/12/07/us-wikileaks-assange-charges-idUSTRE6B669H20101207 |title=Special Report: STD fears sparked case against WikiLeaks boss |publisher=Reuters |date= 7 December 2010|accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police told them that they could not simply tell Assange to take a test, but that their statements would be passed to the prosecutor.&lt;ref name="10days" /&gt; Later that day, the duty prosecutor ordered the arrest of Julian Assange on the suspicion of rape and molestation.&lt;ref name="Swedish Prosecution Authority"/&gt;

The next day, the case was transferred to Chefsåklagare (Chief Public Prosecutor) Eva Finné.
In answer to questions surrounding the incidents, the following day, Finné declared, "I don't think there is reason to suspect that he has committed rape". However, Karin Rosander from the [[Swedish Prosecution Authority]], said Assange remained suspected of molestation. Police gave no further comment at the time, but continued the investigation.&lt;ref name=basis&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11049316|title=Swedish rape warrant for Wikileaks' Assange cancelled|publisher=BBC News | date=21 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After learning of the investigation, Assange said, "The charges are without basis and their issue at this moment is deeply disturbing".&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;{{cite news |title=WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange denies rape allegations |first=Caroline |last=Davies |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/aug/22/wikileaks-julian-assange-denies-rape-allegations |newspaper=The Guardian |date=22 August 2010 |accessdate=19 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The preliminary investigation concerning suspected rape was discontinued by Finné on 25 August,&lt;ref name="Swedish Prosecution Authority"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronology|url=http://www.aklagare.se/In-English/Media/The-Assange-Matter/The-Assange-Matter|publisher=Swedish Prosecution Authority|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but two days later [[Claes Borgström]], the attorney representing the two women, requested a review of the prosecutor's decision to terminate part of the investigation.&lt;ref name="Swedish Prosecution Authority"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News Europe"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11949341|title=Timeline: sexual allegations against Assange in Sweden | publisher=BBC News | date=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 August, Assange was questioned by the Stockholm police regarding the allegations of sexual molestation.&lt;ref name=questioned&gt;{{cite news |title=WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange questioned by police |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/aug/31/wikileaks-julian-assange-questioned |work=The Guardian |date=31 August 2010 |accessdate=19 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He denied the allegations, saying he had consensual sexual encounters with the two women.&lt;ref name="Davies"/&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardCharges&gt;{{cite news |title=WikiLeaks: Interpol issues wanted notice for Julian Assange |first1=David |last1=Leigh |first2=Luke |last2=Harding |first3=Afua |last3=Hirsch |first4=Ewen |last4=MacAskill |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/nov/30/interpol-wanted-notice-julian-assange |work=The Guardian |date=30 November 2010 |accessdate=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=timeline&gt;{{cite news |title=Assange charges: Consensual sex or rape? |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/40551118/ns/us_news-wikileaks_in_security/ |publisher=MSNBC|date=8 December 2010 |accessdate=19 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Investigation reinstated ===
On 1 September 2010, Överåklagare (Director of Public Prosecution) [[Marianne Ny]] decided to resume the preliminary investigation concerning all of the original allegations. On 18 August 2010, Assange had applied for a work and residence permit in Sweden.&lt;ref name=BBCtimeline/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheLocalSV&gt;{{cite news|title=Assange denied Swedish residence permit|url=http://www.thelocal.se/29684/20101018/|accessdate=5 March 2011|newspaper=The Local - Sweden|date=18 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 October 2010, his request was denied.&lt;ref name=BBCtimeline&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11949341 |title=Timeline: sexual allegations against Assange in Sweden |publisher=BBC News|date=2010-12-16 |accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TheLocalSV/&gt;&lt;ref name=RundleTImeline&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crikey.com.au/2010/12/13/rundle-timeline-of-assanges-visit-to-sweden-and-events-that-followed/ |title=Rundle: timeline of Assange’s visit to Sweden and events that followed |publisher=Crikey |accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left Sweden on 27 September 2010. According to one source his departure was with the permission of the Swedish authorities.&lt;ref name=guardiansms&gt;{{cite news|last=Esther Addley|title=Julian Assange's accusers sent texts discussing revenge, court hears|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/feb/08/julian-assange-extradition-hearing-texts|accessdate=2011-03-12|newspaper=Guardian|date=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another source claims that the Swedish authorities notified Assange's lawyer of his imminent arrest on that same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sweden Questions Assange's Departure|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704422204576129703079523420?mod=wsj_share_tweet | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Jeanne|last=Whalen|date=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arrest warrant ===
On 18 November 2010, Marianne Ny ordered the detention of Julian Assange on suspicion of rape, three cases of sexual molestation and unlawful coercion. The Stockholm District Court acceded to the order and issued a European Arrest Warrant to execute it.&lt;ref name="Swedish Prosecution Authority"/&gt; The warrant was appealed to the [[Svea Court of Appeal]] which upheld its issuance, but lowered it to suspicion of rape of a lesser degree, unlawful coercion and two cases of sexual molestation rather than three.&lt;ref name="Press Release"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11803703 | work=BBC News | title=Wikileaks' Assange faces international arrest warrant | date=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15549985 | work=BBC News | title=Wikileaks' Julian Assange loses extradition appeal | date=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The warrant was also appealed to the [[Supreme Court of Sweden]], which decided not to hear the case.&lt;ref name="Supreme Court Protocoll"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://undermattan.com/files/2012/08/ASSANGE-HD-Tillst%C3%A5ndspr%C3%B6vning-2010.pdf |title=Supreme Court Protocoll|publisher=undermattan.com |accessdate=2012-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time Assange had been living in the United Kingdom for 1–2 months. An [[extradition]] hearing took place in an English court in February 2011 to consider an application by Swedish authorities for the extradition of Assange to Sweden. The outcome of the hearing was announced on 24 February 2011, when the extradition warrant was upheld. Assange appealed to the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]]. On 2 November 2011, the court upheld the extradition decision and rejected all four grounds for the appeal as presented by Assange's legal representatives. £19,000 costs was also awarded against Assange. On 5 December 2011, Assange was refused permission by the High Court to appeal to the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]]. The High Court certified that his case raised a point of law of general public importance. The Supreme Court subsequently granted permission to appeal,&lt;ref name="supreme"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16027942|title=Julian Assange wins right to pursue extradition fight |publisher=The BBC|date=5 December 2011|accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and heard the appeal on 1 and 2 February 2012.&lt;ref name=supremebbc&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16822257 Assange extradition case is heard by Supreme Court]&lt;/ref&gt; The court reserved its judgment and dismissed the appeal on 30 May 2012.&lt;ref name=loses/&gt; Assange has said the investigation is "without basis". He remained on conditional [[Bail#England and Wales|bail]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=questioned /&gt;&lt;ref name=abcnews&gt;{{cite news |title=Tell-All on WikiLeaks' Assange Coming out in March |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory?id=12952197 |newspaper=ABC News |date=18 February 2011 |accessdate=19 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCa&gt;{{cite news |title=Wikileaks' Assange appeals over Sweden arrest warrant |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11880965 |newspaper=BBC News |date=1 December 2010 |accessdate=19 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 June 2012, Assange sought refuge at [[Ecuador's Embassy in London]] and was granted temporary asylum. On 16 August 2012, he was granted full asylum by the Ecuadorian government but has been unable to leave the embassy without being arrested.

=== Review of detention order ===
On the 24 June 2014, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported&lt;ref name=guardian20140624&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jun/24/julian-assange-legal-bid-sweden-rape-case|title=Julian Assange makes fresh bid to break deadlock in Swedish rape case|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Assange's lawyers filed a request to [[Stockholm District Court]] to dismiss his detention,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://justice4assange.com/Assange-files-case-to-dismiss.html|title=Assange files case to dismiss Swedish warrant|publisher=Justice for Assange|quote=On Tuesday 24th of June at 1pm CET, Julian Assange’s lawyers filed a request to Stockholm District Court to rescind the decision to detain him without charge.}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on an update to Sweden's code of judicial procedure (1 June 2014) to conform with EU law including a new provision that those arrested or detained have the right to be made aware of "facts forming the basis for the decision to arrest".

On 16 July 2014, the Stockholm District Court reviewed the detention order on request by Assange. During the course of the proceedings, Assange's defence lawyers said that the prosecutors have a "duty" to advance the case, and that they had shown "passivity" in refusing to go to London to interview Assange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jul/16/julian-assange-lawyers-appeal-ruling-uphold-arrest-warrant/ | title=Julian Assange's lawyers will appeal against ruling to uphold arrest warrant | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=17 July 2014 | accessdate=17 July 2014 |author=Crouch, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; After hearing evidence, the district court concluded that there was probable cause to suspect Assange of committing the alleged crimes, and that the detention order should remain in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://domstol.se/Om-Sveriges-Domstolar/Sveriges-Domstolars-pressrum/Nyheter-och-pressmeddelanden/Beslut-i-fraga-om-haktning-i-utevaro--Decision-concering-a-detention-order/ |title=Decision concerning a detention order|publisher=domstol.se |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, Assange's Swedish legal team stated to [[Radio Sweden]]: "We still think we have very good legal arguments to get this decision overruled, so we are confident in the result of the appeal. We think the court of appeal can make another decision on the same arguments as the district court."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&amp;artikel=5916481|title=Assange team confident of Appeal Court win|date=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecuador immediately issued a statement: "The Ecuadorian Government reaffirms its offer of judicial cooperation to the Kingdom of Sweden, to reach a prompt solution to the case. In this sense Ecuador keeps its invitation to judicial officers visit the London Embassy so that Julian Assange can be interviewed or via videoconference. Both possibilities are explicitly referred in the current procedural legislation in Sweden and the European Union."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cancilleria.gob.ec/ecuador-reaffirms-its-commitment-in-defense-of-human-rights-freedom-and-the-life-of-julian-assange/?lang=en|title=Ecuador reaffirms its commitment in defense of human rights, freedom and the life of Julian Assange|date=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 November 2014, the Swedish Court of Appeal refused Assange's appeal, upholding the 2010 detention order, though at the same time issuing a statement criticising the prosecution for not having done more to advance the case by proceeding with an interrogation of Assange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-30129453|title= Swedish court upholds Assange order |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=20 November 2014 |website=BBC News | accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inquiry into three of the allegations dropped ===
On 12 August 2015, Swedish prosecutors announced that, as the [[statute of limitations]] for the less serious allegations had run out, and they had not succeeded in interviewing Assange, they would end part of their preliminary investigation. After 18 August 2015, Assange could no longer be charged for any of the three less serious charges. However, the preliminary investigation into the more serious allegation remained open as the statute of limitations for this charge was not expected to expire until 2020.&lt;ref name="bbcdrop"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-33894757 |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=12 August 2015 |title=Assange Assault Inquiry to Be Dropped |last=Hawley |first=Caroline}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swedish authorities interviewed Assange on this allegation in November 2016.&lt;ref name="testimony" /&gt;

===Revocation of arrest warrant===

On 19 May 2017, the Swedish chief prosecutor applied to the Stockholm District Court to rescind the arrest warrant for Julian Assange,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39973864|title=Julian Assange: Sweden drops rape investigation|last=|first=|date=19 May 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=20 May 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; effectively ceasing their investigation against Julian Assange.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/may/19/swedish-prosecutors-drop-julian-assange-investigation|title=Swedish prosecutors drop Julian Assange rape investigation|last=Addley|first=Esther|date=19 May 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=20 May 2017|last2=Travis|first2=Alan|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case may be reinstated until the expiration of the statute of limitations. Additionally, Britain's arrest warrant pertaining to bail violations remains open.

==Extradition process==

===First instance proceedings===

====Detention and bail====
Assange presented himself to the [[Metropolitan Police]] on December 7, 2010, and was [[Remand (court procedure)|remanded]] to [[London]]'s [[Wandsworth Prison]].&lt;ref name=Addley2&gt;{{cite news |title=Q&amp;A: Julian Assange allegations |first=Esther |last=Addley |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/dec/17/julian-assange-q-and-a |newspaper=The Guardian |date=17 December 2010 |accessdate=19 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 December, he was [[Bail#England and Wales|granted bail]] with bail conditions of residence at [[Ellingham Hall, Norfolk]], and wearing of an [[Electronic tagging|electronic tag]]. Bail was set at [[£]]240,000 [[surety]] with a deposit of £200,000 ([[$]]312,700).&lt;ref name=Local3&gt;{{cite news |title=Extradition part of 'smear campaign': Assange |url=http://www.thelocal.se/30916/20101217/ |newspaper=The Local |date=17 December 2010 |accessdate=20 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On release on bail, Assange said "I hope to continue my work and continue to protest my innocence in this matter,"&lt;ref name=ThomsonReuters&gt;{{cite news |title=WikiLeaks' Assange walks free on bail in London |first1=Isabel |last1=Coles |first2=Avril |last2=Ormsby |url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAL3E6N80HH20101216 |publisher=Thomson Reuters |date=16 December 2010 |accessdate=16 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and told the BBC, "This has been a very successful [[smear campaign]] and a very wrong one."&lt;ref name=VancouverSun&gt;{{cite news |title=WikiLeaks' Julian Assange says he is victim of smear campaign |first=Avril |last=Ormsby |url=https://vancouversun.com/news/WikiLeaks+Julian+Assange+says+victim+smear+campaign/3992455/story.html |newspaper=The Vancouver Sun |date=17 December 2010 |accessdate=20 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that the extradition proceedings to Sweden were "actually an attempt to get me into a jurisdiction which will then make it easier to extradite me to the US."

====Extradition hearing====
The extradition hearing took place on 7–8 and 11 February 2011 before the [[City of Westminster Magistrates' Court]] sitting at Belmarsh Magistrates' Court in London.&lt;ref name=Sydney&gt;{{cite news |title=Besieged Assange hires PR team |url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/besieged-assange-hires-pr-team-20110108-19j5f.html |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=8 January 2011 |accessdate=8 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Addley3&gt;{{cite news |title=WikiLeaks: Julian Assange 'faces execution or Guantánamo detention' |first=Esther |last=Addley |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jan/11/julian-assange-wikileaks-execution-gantanamo |newspaper=The Guardian |date=11 January 2011 |accessdate=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assange's lawyers at the extradition hearing were [[Geoffrey Robertson]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] and [[Mark Stephens (solicitor)|Mark Stephens]], human rights specialists, and the prosecution was represented by a team led by Clare Montgomery QC.&lt;ref name=voanews&gt;{{cite news |title=Lawyer: WikiLeaks Founder Cannot Get Fair Trial in Sweden |first= |last= |url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/europe/Lawyer-WikiLeaks-Founder-Cannot-Get-Fair-Trial-in-Sweden-115938559.html |publisher=Voice of America |date=11 February 2011 |accessdate=11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments were presented as to whether the Swedish prosecutor had the authority to issue a European Arrest Warrant, the extradition was requested for prosecution or interrogation, the alleged crimes qualified as extradition crimes, there was an abuse of process, his human rights would be respected, and he would receive a fair trial if extradited to Sweden.

====Extradition decision====
The outcome of the hearing was announced on 24 February 2011, when the extradition warrant was upheld.&lt;ref name=Dodd&gt;{{cite news |title=Julian Assange extradition attempt an uphill struggle, says specialist |first=Vikram |last=Dodd |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/dec/08/julian-assange-extradition-attempt |newspaper=The Guardian |date=8 December 2010 |accessdate=19 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hearing1&gt;{{cite news |title=Julian Assange extradition hearing – final day live updates |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/blog/2011/feb/11/julian-assange-extradition-hearing-live#block-18 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=8 February 2011 |accessdate=11 February 2011 |first=Simon |last=Jeffery}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=refused&gt;{{cite news |title=Wikileaks founder Julian Assange refused bail |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11937110 |newspaper=BBC News |date=8 December 2010 |accessdate=8 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senior District Judge Howard Riddle found against Assange on each of the main arguments against his extradition.&lt;ref name=Coleman /&gt; The judge said "as a matter of fact, and looking at all the circumstances in the round, this person (Mr Assange) passes the threshold of being an accused person and is wanted for prosecution."&lt;ref name=Coleman /&gt; Judge Riddle concluded: "I am satisfied that the specified offences are extradition offences."&lt;ref name=Coleman&gt;{{cite news |title=Wikileaks' Julian Assange handed 'resounding defeat' |first=Clive |last=Coleman |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12569462 |newspaper=BBC News |date=24 February 2011 |accessdate=25 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assange commented after the decision to extradite him, saying "It comes as no surprise but is nevertheless wrong. It comes as the result of a European arrest warrant system run amok."&lt;ref name=Addley4&gt;{{cite news |title=Julian Assange attacks 'rubber-stamp' warrant as he loses extradition battle |first1=Esther |last1=Addley |first2=Alexandra |last2=Topping |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/feb/24/julian-assange-extradition-sweden-verdict |newspaper=The Guardian |date=24 February 2011 |accessdate=25 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appeal to the High Court===
On 2 March 2011, Assange's lawyers lodged an appeal with the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] challenging the decision to extradite him to Sweden.&lt;ref name=ExtraApp1Guardian&gt;{{cite news|last=Meikle|first=James|title=Julian Assange lodges extradition appeal|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/mar/03/julian-assange-extradition-appeal?INTCMP=SRCH|accessdate=5 March 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assange remained on conditional bail.&lt;ref name=ExtraApp1Guardian /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gordon, PA|first=Cathy|title=WikiLeaks' Assange appeals against UK extradition|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/03/us-britain-assange-appeal-idUSTRE7222LH20110303|accessdate=5 March 2011|newspaper=Reuters|date=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appeal hearing took place on 12 and 13 July 2011 at the High Court in London.

===Appeal to the Supreme Court===
The High Court refused permission to appeal to the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]], but this was granted by the Supreme Court itself, after the High Court certified that a point of law of general public importance was involved in its decision.

The point of law certified was whether the wording ''Judicial Authority'' in the [[2003 Extradition Act]] was to be interpreted as a “person who is competent to exercise judicial authority and that such competence requires impartiality and independence of both the executive and the parties” or if it “embraces a variety of bodies, some of which have the qualities of impartiality and independence …and some of which do not.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/UKSC_2011_0264_Judgment.pdf |title=Supreme court judgement |publisher=the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom |date=2012-05-30 |accessdate=2012-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court heard the appeal on 1 and 2 February 2012.&lt;ref name=supremebbc /&gt; The court reserved its judgment,&lt;ref name=supremeguardian&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/blog/2012/feb/02/julian-assange-extradition-appeal-at-supreme-court-day-two-live-blog | work=The Guardian | first=Paul | last=Owen | title=Julian Assange extradition appeal at supreme court - Thursday 2 February | date=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dismissed the appeal by a 5–2 majority on 30 May 2012.&lt;ref name=loses&gt;{{cite news |title=Julian Assange loses extradition appeal at Supreme Court |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18260914 |newspaper=BBC News |date=30 May 2012 |accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=Assange v The Swedish Judicial Authority|court=UKSC |division= |year=2012 |num=22 |para= |eucase= |parallelcite= |courtname= |juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court granted Assange two weeks to make an application to reopen the appeal after his counsel argued the judgments of the majority relied on an interpretation of the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]] that was not argued during the hearing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supremecourt.uk/news/julian-assange-v-swedish-judicial-authority-judgment.html "Further statement – Julian Assange v Swedish Prosecution Authority,"] United Kingdom Supreme Court, 30 May 2012.

Accessed 18 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barring any appeal to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in [[Strasbourg]], extradition was expected to take place over a ten-day period commencing on 28 June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zeenews.india.com/news/world/assange-loses-final-legal-bid-to-block-extradition-to-sweden_781869.html "Assange loses final legal bid to block extradition to Sweden,"] Zee News, 14 June 2012.

=== Ecuador asylum and bail forfeiture ===
{{wikinews|Assange seeks asylum in Ecuadorian embassy}}
Since 19 June 2012, Assange has lived in the [[Embassy of Ecuador in London]], where he asked for and was granted [[political asylum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/19/julian-assange-asylum-ecuador_n_1609725.html Reuters, 19.06.2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Because Assange did not comply with his bail conditions, his supporters forfeited £93,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/08/julian-assange-supporters-ordered-forfeit-bail|title=Julian Assange supporters ordered to forfeit £93,500 bail money|last=Booth|first=Robert|date=2012-10-08|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assange’s lawyers invited the Swedish prosecutor four times to come and question him at the embassy, but the offer was refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-to-release-files-on-50-countries-20140619-zse02.html|title=WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to release files on 50 countries |first=Rick|last=Feneley|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|date=2014-06-19|accessdate=2017-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, faced with the prospect of the Swedish statute of limitations expiring for some of the allegations, the prosecutor relented and agreed to question Assange in the Ecuadorean embassy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31867829|title=Julian Assange case: Sweden U-turn on questioning|publisher=BBC|date=2015-03-13|accessdate=2017-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK agreed to the interview in May awaiting Ecuadorean approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/wikileaks/11681502/Why-is-Julian-Assange-still-inside-the-embassy-of-Ecuador.html|title=Why is Julian Assange still inside the embassy of Ecuador?|first=Harriet|last=Alexander|publisher=The Telegraph|date=2016-02-04|accessdate=2017-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assange said he would go to Sweden if provided with a diplomatic guarantee that he would not be turned over to the United States,&lt;ref name=afp2102&gt;{{cite news|last=AFP|title=WikiLeaks founder wants guarantee he won't be sent to US|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5juNu7AD08LPbrqXibOf5VLiZ_5GA|accessdate=16 August 2012|newspaper=Agence France-Presse|date=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to which the Swedish foreign ministry stated that Sweden's legislation does not allow any judicial decision like extradition to be predetermined.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/28/ecuador-julian-assange-embassy-wikileaks Guardian, September 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the Swedish government is free to reject extradition requests from non-EU countries, independent of any court decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accusations ===
Assange was arrested in his absence and wanted for questioning in relation to accusations against him of rape and sexual molestation. This was the first step in the criminal prosecution procedure in Sweden, and only after the questioning would the prosecution authority be able to formally indict him.&lt;ref name=10days&gt;{{cite news|last=Nick Davies|title=10 days in Sweden: the full allegations against Julian Assange|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/dec/17/julian-assange-sweden|accessdate=2011-03-11|newspaper=Guardian|date=17 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== l'Espresso document publication ===
On 20 October 2015, a new batch of documents resulting from a FOIA request to the Swedish authorities filed by the Italian news magazine [[l'Espresso]] was published online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espresso.repubblica.it/internazionale/2015/10/16/news/five-years-confined-new-foia-documents-shed-light-on-the-julian-assange-case-1.235129?ref=twhe Five years confined: New Foia documents shed light on the Julian Assange case], 20 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; They contain records of correspondence between the [[Swedish Prosecution Authority]] and the [[Crown Prosecution Service]]. A CPS lawyer wrote in an email to Marianne Ny that "it would not be prudent for the Swedish authorities to try to interview the defendant in the [[UK]]... He would of course have no obligation under English law to answer any questions put to him.... any attempt to interview under strict Swedish law would invariably be fraught with problems." Referring to the case itself, he wrote, "It is simply amazing how much work this is generating... Do not think that the case is being dealt with as just another extradition request." Assange's legal team stated that, following these revelations, they would probably challenge the extradition request in court again.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/oct/19/julian-assange-lawyers-may-launch-new-appeal-emails?CMP=twt_gu Julian Assange lawyers may launch new appeal against extradition in light of CPS emails], 20 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decision to interview Assange in London ===
In March 2015, Marianne Ny indicated that she would allow Assange to be interviewed in London, and that the interview would be conducted by a deputy prosecutor, Ingrid Isgren, as well as a police investigator.&lt;ref name=Isgren&gt;{{cite news|last=David Crouch|title=Julian Assange to be questioned by Swedish prosecutors in London|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/mar/13/julian-assange-wikileaks-swedish-prosecutors-london-interview|accessdate=2011-03-17|newspaper=Guardian|date=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2015, Ecuador stated that it had reached a deal with Sweden which would allow him to be interviewed in the Embassy.&lt;ref name=dec2015&gt;{{cite news|last=Jessica Elgot|title=Julian Assange may face Swedish interrogation within days |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/dec/12/julian-assange-may-face-swedish-interrogation-within-days|accessdate=2015-12-14|newspaper=Guardian|date=12 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016, Ecuador set a date for Assange's interview over the rape allegation. The date was 17 October 2016. It was established that the interview would be conducted by an Ecuadorian prosecutor, with Isgren and a police officer present.&lt;ref name=interview&gt;{{cite news|last=Reuters|title=Date set for questioning of Julian Assange over rape allegation|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/14/date-set-questioning-julian-assange-rape-allegation|accessdate=2016-10-16|newspaper=Guardian|date=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interview was subsequently postponed until 14 November 2016, "to ensure the presence of Mr Assange’s attorneys," according to a spokesman for Assange’s legal team.&lt;ref name=interviewpostponed&gt;{{cite news|last=Esther Addley|title=Date set for questioning of Julian Assange over rape allegation|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/oct/12/questioning-of-julian-assange-by-swedish-authorities-postponed|accessdate=2016-10-17|newspaper=Guardian|date=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Assange's lawyer, the "shape" of the questions was still being discussed a week before the scheduled interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Julian Assange to be questioned by Ecuador over rape allegation|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/nov/07/julian-assange-to-be-questioned-by-ecuador-over-allegation|accessdate=9 November 2016|work=Guardian|date=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assange released his testimony to the public on 7 December.&lt;ref name="testimony"&gt;{{cite news|title=Assange releases testimony from London questioning, says he is innocent|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ecuador-sweden-assange-idUSKBN13W20O?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=worldNews|accessdate=8 December 2016|agency=Reuters|date=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his statement, Assange says that his Swedish lawyer was not actually permitted to be present during the interview, among many other complaints concerning the length and irregularities of the process and events leading up to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Assange|first1=Julian|title=14/15 NOVEMBER 2016 QUESTIONING AT THE ECUADORIAN EMBASSY|url=https://justice4assange.com/IMG/html/assange-statement-2016.html|website=Justice4assange.com|accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opinion of arbitrary detention by UN Working Group and move to lift European arrest warrant===
On 5 February 2016, it was announced by the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] that the [[Working Group on Arbitrary Detention]] had found that Assange is effectively being held in [[arbitrary detention]] by the UK and Swedish governments in a [[binding precedent|legally-binding]] [[legal opinion|opinion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Julian Assange arbitrarily detained by Sweden and the UK|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=17013&amp;LangID=E|accessdate=7 February 2016|publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt; High Commissioner [[Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein]] reaffirmed later the same month that the opinion is based on binding [[international law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Britain, Sweden should accept Assange ruling: UN rights chief|url=https://sg.news.yahoo.com/swedish-prosecutor-vows-assange-london-105517466.html|accessdate=7 April 2017|agency=AFP News|publisher=Yahoo!

=== Offers to Obama Administration ===

Assange and his supporters have expressed concerns that upon his return to Sweden, Assange may be extradited to the United States to face charges related to his professional work, since Wikileaks has been under investigation in the US since at least 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Edward Snowden and others urge Trump to drop case against Assange|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/may/15/edward-snowden-assange-wikileaks-open-letter?CMP=twt_gu|accessdate=17 May 2017|work=The Guardian|date=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 January 2017, Wikileaks announced that Assange would agree to extradition to the United States if the [[Obama administration]] granted clemency to [[Chelsea Manning]] though he claimed the charges that might be pressed against him there had no merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Firozi|first=Paulina|title=Assange agrees to be extradited if Obama grants clemency for Manning|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/news/314139-assange-agrees-to-be-extradited-to-us-if-obama-grants-clemency-for-chelsea|accessdate=13 January 2017|publisher=''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]''|date=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The offer followed one made via Assange's attorney in September 2016 that an extradition waiver would be made conditional on a pardon for Manning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/15/politics/julian-assange-wikileaks-chelsea-manning/ WikiLeaks' Julian Assange fails to overturn arrest warrant again], ''[[CNN]], Wesley Bruer &amp; James Masters, September 16, 2016.

=== Statements made by Trump Administration ===

Two weeks before the Swedish arrest warrant for Assange was dropped, one of his lawyers, Per Samuelson, reiterated his opposition to it saying "With the Supreme Court's own reasoning, his detention should now be rescinded because we can now prove that the U.S. is hunting Julian Assange."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Assange lawyer asks Swedish court to tear up detention order|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ecuador-sweden-assange-idUSKBN17Z0P2|accessdate=5 May 2017|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This followed public statements{{specify|reason=It would be nice to know what the statements were, or even to have a general summary of the content|date=January 2018}} made by American President [[Donald Trump]], [[CIA]] Director [[Mike Pompeo]], and Attorney General [[Jeff Sessions]] as to the appropriateness of charging Assange in the U.S. with crimes related to WikiLeaks{{fact|date=January 2018}}.

The Enterprise Bankruptcy Law of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (trial Implementation) was first passed in 1986.  On 1 June 2007, the new Enterprise Bankruptcy Law of the PRC came into force.  It contains 136 articles, almost 100 more than the 1986 law it replaced, and consequently it is thought to be more complete legally. 

The Enterprise Bankruptcy Law of the PRC was adopted in August 27, 2006, and became effective since June 1, 2007.

'''Breakaway PPV''' was a [[Television in Canada|Canadian]] [[English language]] regional [[pay-per-view]] [[television]] provider in [[Western Canada]] and the territories. Breakaway is jointly owned by the parent companies of the [[Vancouver Canucks]], [[Calgary Flames]], and [[Edmonton Oilers]] at 33.33% each. Licensed in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2000/DB2000-738.htm Decision CRTC 2000-738], [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]], 2000-12-14. Retrieved 2010-10-20.&lt;/ref&gt; its sole offerings were regional pay-per-view broadcasts of [[National Hockey League]] games involving the aforementioned teams which are not available through other broadcast or cable channels. The Breakaway name was not used on-air; the services were branded as ''Canucks TV'', ''Flames PPV'', and ''Oilers PPV'' respectively.

The service has not operated since the end of the [[2009–10 NHL season]] &amp;ndash; beginning with the [[2010-11 NHL season]], [[Sportsnet]] secured long-term deals for the packages of Canucks, Oilers, and Flames regional broadcasts previously allocated to Breakaway, and established new regional sub-feeds carried with [[Sportsnet One]] to serve as overflow channels in case of programming conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsnet.ca/pressroom/2010/08/10/flames_oilers/ ROGERS SPORTSNET ANNOUNCES LANDMARK 10-YEAR BROADCAST AGREEMENT FOR NHL HOCKEY], Rogers Sportsnet press release, August 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsnet.ca/pressroom/2010/07/28/sens_sportsnetone/ CANUCKS ANNOUNCE NEW TELEVISION PARTNERSHIP WITH ROGERS SPORTSNET ONE], Rogers Sportsnet press release, July 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its dormancy, the CRTC continued to issue interim license renewals for the service through August 2013&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2010/2010-562.htm Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2010-562], [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]], 2010-08-09. Retrieved 2010-10-20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2011/2011-417.htm Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2011-417], [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]], 2011-07-12. Retrieved 2011-10-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Breakaway was not affiliated with a similar pay-per-view package of [[Ottawa Senators]] games, branded as "Sens TV", which was offered over roughly the same timeframe. Instead, the Senators distributed these games through the main incumbent PPV provider serving each cable or satellite provider (namely [[Viewers Choice]], [[Vu!]], or [[Shaw PPV]]). It too was discontinued in favour of a deal with Sportsnet One in 2010.

The '''Building and Construction Authority''' ([[Abbreviation]]: '''BCA'''; {{zh|c=建设局}}) is a [[Statutory boards of the Singapore Government|statutory board]] under the [[Ministry of National Development (Singapore)|Ministry of National Development]] of the [[Singapore Government]]. It was established on 1 April 1999 through the merger of the Construction Industry Development Board and the Building Control Division of the former Public Works Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Building Up. The Inaugural Annual Report 2000 of the Building and Construction Authority|year=2000|publisher=Building and Construction Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary role of BCA is to develop and regulate Singapore's building and construction industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About BCA|url=http://www.bca.gov.sg/AboutUs/about_bca.html|publisher=Building and Construction Authority|accessdate=24 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Building safety ==
BCA ensures that buildings in Singapore are designed, constructed and maintained to high standards of safety through its building regulatory system.

In October 2004, BCA issued a window retrofitting order, requiring aluminium rivets fitted on casement windows to be replaced with stainless steel rivets.  Since the order came into force, BCA and the [[Housing Development Board]] (HDB) have been urging property owners and tenants to practise window safety through a public campaign. Every year, 6 June and 12 December have been designated as “Window Safety Days”, where property owners and tenants are encouraged to check their windows at least once every six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Window Maintenance|url=http://www.bca.gov.sg/Windows_safety/windows_maintenance.html|publisher=Building and Construction Authority|accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BCA is also the lead agency in Singapore in regulating amusement rides to protect public safety. In July 2011, a new regulatory framework was introduced to protect the safety of ride-goers in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New regulations for amusement rides starting July|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne+News/Singapore/Story/A1Story20110624-285861.html|accessdate=24 November 2011|newspaper=AsiaOne|date=24 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sustainability ==
BCA actively promotes the use of green building technologies and designs through its Green Building Masterplan and various initiatives. Under the second Green Building Masterplan which was launched in 2009, BCA seeks to achieve the national target of greening at least 80% of the buildings in Singapore by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2nd Green Building Masterplan|url=http://www.bca.gov.sg/GreenMark/others/gbmp2.pdf|publisher=Building and Construction Authority|accessdate=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BCA Green Mark Scheme was launched in 2005 to promote sustainability in the built environment and raise environmental awareness among developers, designers and builders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About BCA Green Mark Scheme|url=http://www.bca.gov.sg/greenmark/green_mark_buildings.html|publisher=Building and Construction Authority|accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It assesses the environmental friendliness and energy efficiency of buildings. In 2005, there were only 17 Green Mark building projects in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Factsheet on BCA Green Mark|url=http://www.bca.gov.sg/newsroom/others/pr04082011_GMESB.pdf|publisher=Building and Construction Authority|accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, BCA launched South-East Asia’s first Zero Energy Building (ZEB)  located at the BCA Academy of the Built Environment. The ZEB was retrofitted from an existing building and serves as a test-bedding centre for green building technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=$10m plan to create S'pore's first zero-energy building|date=8 November 2007|newspaper=The Straits Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building is expected to be about 40-50% more efficient than an office building of similar layout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.asiaone.com/Business/News/Story/A1Story20091026-176057.html|title=Singapore's first Zero Energy Building launched today|date=26 October 2009|newspaper=AsiaOne|accessdate=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, BCA became the first government agency outside North America to be conferred the Aspen Institute’s Energy and Environment Award (Government) for its comprehensive policies and programmes in steering  development of green buildings and sustainable construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Aspen Institute Announces Winners and Finalists of the 2010 Aspen Institute Energy and Environment Awards. (Press release)|url=http://www.aspeninstitute.org/news/2010/07/20/aspen-institute-announces-winners-finalists-2010-aspen-institute-energy-environment-|publisher=The Aspen Institute. 20 July 2011|accessdate=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Singapore was ranked first in green building policies, before advanced cities like Tokyo, Sydney and Seoul, in a study conducted by [[Solidiance]] on Asia-Pacific cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Asia Pacific’s Top 5 Green Cities|newspaper=The Sunday Times|date=13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, there are more than 940 green building projects, translating to a gross floor area of about 300 million ft2, or 12% of Singapore’s total gross floor area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bca.gov.sg/Newsroom/pr06122011_WGBC.html|title=International Recognition for BCA Singapore and its Green Building Masterplan. (Press release)|publisher=Building and Construction Authority|accessdate=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BCA Green Mark Scheme includes districts, parks, infrastructure, office interiors, and residential and non-residential buildings. In 2011, the Scheme was extended to include restaurants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1152544/1/.html|title=Restaurants awarded BCA Green Mark certification|date=12 September 2011|newspaper=Channel NewsAsia|accessdate=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and existing schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bca.gov.sg/newsroom/others/pr04082011_GMES.pdf|title=New Green Mark Award for Existing Schools. (Press release)|publisher=Building and Construction Authority|accessdate=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme has also extended its reach beyond Singapore . More than 120 projects in countries like China, Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei, India, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, The Philippines and Tanzania have applied for the Green Mark certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bca.gov.sg/newsroom/others/pr04082011_GMESB.pdf|title=Factsheet on BCA Green Mark|publisher=Building and Construction Authority|accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BCA clinched the inaugural Regional Leadership Award, one of the six awards handed out at the World Green Building Council Government Leadership Awards 2011, for its  Green Building Masterplan and leadership in the green building movement in Asia Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WorldGBC Government Leadership Awards|url=http://www.worldgbc.org/site2/programs/awards/|publisher=World Green Building Council|accessdate=11 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128001114/http://www.worldgbc.org/site2/programs/awards|archivedate=28 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BCA  collaborates with  the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) to promote sustainable building practices. In 2011, BCA and UNEP finalised an agreement establishing BCA’s Centre for Sustainable Buildings as a “Centre Collaborating with UNEP”,  the first in Asia. Through the collaboration, both BCA and UNEP will provide policy advice and outreach activities related to sustainable building resource management in   sector in tropical cities and regions worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Factsheet on UNEP-BCA MOU|url=http://www.bca.gov.sg/newsroom/others/pr12092011_IGBCA.pdf|publisher=Building and Construction Authority|accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Close to 1,000 delegates attended the International Green Building Conference 2011.JPG|thumb|Close to 1,000 delegates attended the International Green Building Conference 2011]]

BCA organised the second International Green Building Conference in September 2011 during the Singapore Green Building Week. The event attracted close to 1,000 delegates from over 32 countries, including  industry experts,  practitioners, and policy-makers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Green Building Conference|url=http://www.sgbw.com.sg/|accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other green building events that BCA conducts include the roving BCA Green Building Exhibitions with green building tips and information for residents to make their homes more environmentally friendly. The annual BCA Awards recognises sustainable buildings, and honous industry professionals  committed to safe, high quality and user-friendly buildings.

In 2016, BCA set up the world's first high-rise rotatable laboratory for the tropics - the BCA SkyLab. Modelled after the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's FLEXLAB, the facility is a  rotatable test facility pivotal to developing  energy efficient building technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BCA-SkyLab|url=https://www.bca.gov.sg/skylab/|publisher=Building and Construction Authority|accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accessibility ==
In 1990, BCA introduced the Code on Barrier-Free Accessibility, reshaping the accessibility landscape of Singapore’s built environment by improving inter-connectivity between buildings and upgrading existing buildings to make them more accessible. A $40 million fund has been set aside to co-fund voluntary upgrading on basic barrier-free features over a period of five years. Additionally, BCA has legislative measures in place to ensure continued compliance to the Code and to prevent misuse of barrier-free facilities.

BCA also promotes Universal Design (UD) for buildings to cater to the needs of all users, including the young, the elderly, persons with disabilities, and parents with infants. The BCA Universal Design Award was launched in early 2007, recognising outstanding achievements by building developers and owners to incorporate barrier-free accessibility and UD in their developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UD Awards|url=http://www.friendlybuildings.sg/web2/Contents/Contents.aspx?Id=41|publisher=Our Friendly Built Environment Portal. Building and Construction Authority|accessdate=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BCA maintains an Accessibility Rating System on its Friendly Buildings portal, which classifies buildings according to levels of user-friendliness.  The system provides detailed information such as the location of accessible entrances and other accessibility facilities, to aid building users on locating accessible buildings in Singapore.  By December 2011, about 3,000 buildings have been rated of which 2,200 of them are accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Question – How many buildings have been rated?|url=http://www.friendlybuildings.sg/web/Contents/Contents.aspx?Contid=188|publisher=Our Friendly Built Environment Portal. Building and Construction Authority|accessdate=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Training and professional standards==
BCA has put in place many schemes to help raise the construction industry’s skill levels and professionalism, design and construction capabilities, niche expertise, and the export of construction-related services. Some examples are the Construction Registration of Tradesmen (CoreTrade) Scheme to establish a core base of trade foremen and tradesmen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aesperon - What Is CoreTrade|url=http://aesperoncoretrade.com/what-is-bca-coretrade/|publisher=Aesperon - What Is CoreTrade|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the BCA Academy of the Built Environment to develop a professional workforce and encourage the adoption of innovative technologies. BCA International, a wholly owned subsidiary formed by BCA, paves the way for local construction companies to offer a full scope of expertise and value-added services to assist overseas governments and clients in developing excellent built environments.

BCA also established a Construction Productivity Gallery and a Centre for Lean and Virtual Construction to guide and advise construction firms on the latest construction technologies and re-engineering processes to achieve time and labour savings. This is in line with Singapore’s national productivity drive, where BCA introduced a S$250-million Construction Productivity and Capability Fund (CPCF)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CPCF Construction Productivity &amp; Capability Fund Overview|url=http://aesperoncoretrade.com/bca-cpcf-fund-enhancement/|publisher=Aesperon - BCA CPCF Construction Productivity &amp; Capability Fund|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in June 2010 to help the construction industry build up a skilled workforce, adopt more advanced construction technologies, and enhance building capability in niche areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transforming the Construction Industry through Capability Development and Productivity Improvement|url=http://www.mof.gov.sg/budget_2011/expenditure_overview/mnd.html|publisher=Singapore Budget 2011 – Expenditure Overview. Ministry of Finance|accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BCA strongly promotes the adoption of [[Building information modeling|Building Information Modelling]] (BIM),  which allows professionals to work on a building project digitally before it is built. BCA targets to get 80 per cent of the industry to use BIM widely by 2015, and is working with the public sector to take the lead in driving greater BIM adoptiont.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bca.gov.sg/Newsroom/pr02112011_BI.html | title=Public sector has role to play in adoption of BIM, say experts | date=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Criminal procedure (trial)}}
'''Capital punishment''', also known as the '''death penalty''', is a government-sanctioned practice whereby a person is killed by the state as a punishment for a crime. The [[sentence (law)|sentence]] that someone be punished in such a manner is referred to as a '''death sentence''', whereas the act of carrying out the sentence is known as an '''execution'''. Crimes that are punishable by death are known as '''capital crimes''' or '''capital offences''', and they commonly include offences such as [[murder]], [[treason]], [[espionage]], [[war crime]]s, [[crimes against humanity]] and [[genocide]]. Etymologically, the term ''capital'' (lit. "of the head", derived via the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|capitalis}}'' from ''{{lang|la|caput}}'', "head") in this context alluded to execution by beheading.&lt;ref name="KronenwetterP202"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kronenwetter|2001|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of formal execution extends to the beginning of recorded history. Most historical records and various primitive tribal practices indicate that the death penalty was a part of their justice system. Communal punishment for wrongdoing generally included compensation by the wrongdoer, [[corporal punishment]], [[shunning]], [[exile|banishment]] and execution. Usually, compensation and shunning were enough as a form of justice.&lt;ref&gt;So common was the practice of compensation that the word ''murder'' is derived from the French word ''mordre'' (bite) a reference to the heavy compensation one must pay for causing an unjust death. The "bite" one had to pay was used as a term for the crime itself: "Mordre wol out; that se we day by day." – [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] (1340–1400), [[The Canterbury Tales]], ''The Nun's Priest's Tale'', l. 4242 (1387–1400), repr. In ''The Works of Geoffrey Chaucer'', ed. Alfred W. Pollard, et al. (1898).&lt;/ref&gt; The response to crime committed by neighbouring tribes or communities included a formal apology, compensation or blood [[feud]]s.

A [[Feud|blood feud]] or vendetta occurs when arbitration between families or tribes fails or an arbitration system is non-existent. This form of justice was common before the emergence of an arbitration system based on state or organized religion. It may result from crime, land disputes or a code of honour. "Acts of retaliation underscore the ability of the social collective to defend itself and demonstrate to enemies (as well as potential allies) that injury to property, rights, or the person will not go unpunished."&lt;ref&gt;Translated from Waldmann, ''op.cit.'', p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in practice, it is often difficult to distinguish between a war of vendetta and one of conquest.

In most countries that practise capital punishment, it is now reserved for [[murder]], [[terrorism]], [[war crimes]], [[espionage]], [[treason]], or as part of military justice.  In some countries sexual crimes, such as [[rape]], [[fornication]], [[adultery]], [[incest]] and [[sodomy]], carry the death penalty, as do religious crimes such as [[Hudud]] and [[Qisas]] crimes, such as [[Apostasy from Islam|apostasy]] (formal renunciation of the [[state religion]]), [[Islam and blasphemy|blasphemy]], [[moharebeh]], [[hirabah]], [[Fasad]], [[Mofsed-e-filarz]]   and [[witchcraft]]. In many [[Use of capital punishment by nation|countries that use the death penalty]], [[drug trafficking]] is also a capital offence. In [[China]], [[Trafficking in human beings|human trafficking]] and serious cases of [[Political corruption|corruption]] and [[financial crime]]s are punished by the death penalty. In militaries around the world [[courts-martial]] have imposed death sentences for offences such as [[cowardice]], [[desertion]], [[insubordination]], and [[mutiny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shotatdawn.org.uk/ |title=Shot at Dawn, campaign for pardons for British and Commonwealth soldiers executed in World War I |accessdate=20 July 2006 |publisher=Shot at Dawn Pardons Campaign |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060703143147/http://www.shotatdawn.org.uk/ |archivedate=3 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient history===
[[File:Jean-Léon Gérôme - The Christian Martyrs' Last Prayer - Walters 37113.jpg|thumb|left|''The Christian Martyrs' Last Prayer'', by [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] (1883). [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Colosseum]].]]
Elaborations of tribal arbitration of [[feud]]s included peace settlements often done in a religious context and compensation system. Compensation was based on the principle of ''substitution'' which might include material (for example, cattle, slave) compensation, exchange of brides or grooms, or payment of the blood debt. Settlement rules could allow for animal blood to replace human blood, or transfers of property or [[Blood money (term)|blood money]] or in some case an offer of a person for execution. The person offered for execution did not have to be an original perpetrator of the crime because the social system was based on tribes and clans, not individuals. Blood feuds could be regulated at meetings, such as the [[Norsemen]] ''[[Thing (assembly)|things]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lindow, ''op.cit.'' (primarily discusses Icelandic ''things'').&lt;/ref&gt; Systems deriving from blood feuds may survive alongside more advanced legal systems or be given recognition by courts (for example, [[trial by combat]]). One of the more modern refinements of the blood feud is the [[duel]].

In certain parts of the world, nations in the form of ancient republics, monarchies or tribal oligarchies emerged. These nations were often united by common linguistic, religious or family ties. Moreover, expansion of these nations often occurred by conquest of neighbouring tribes or nations. Consequently, various classes of royalty, nobility, various commoners and slaves emerged. Accordingly, the systems of tribal arbitration were submerged into a more unified system of justice which formalized the relation between the different "[[social class]]es" rather than "tribes". The earliest and most famous example is [[Code of Hammurabi]] which set the different punishment and compensation, according to the different class/group of victims and perpetrators. The [[Torah]] (Jewish Law), also known as the [[Pentateuch]] (the first five books of the Christian [[Old Testament]]), lays down the death penalty for murder, [[kidnapping]], practicing [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], violation of the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]], [[blasphemy]], and a wide range of sexual crimes, although evidence suggests that actual executions were rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=William|last=Schabas|year=2002|title=The Abolition of the Death Penalty in International Law|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-81491-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further example comes from [[Ancient Greece]], where the [[Athenian]] legal system was first written down by [[Draco (lawgiver)|Draco]] in about 621 BC: the death penalty was applied for a particularly wide range of crimes, though [[Solon]] later repealed Draco's code and published new laws, retaining only Draco's homicide statutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Robert|url=http://history-world.org/draco_and_solon_laws.htm|title=Greece, A History of Ancient Greece, Draco and Solon Laws|publisher=History-world.org|accessdate=23 August 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021023919/http://history-world.org/draco_and_solon_laws.htm|archivedate=21 October 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word [[wikt:draconian|draconian]] derives from Draco's laws. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] also used death penalty for a wide range of offences.&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/93902/capital-punishment|title=capital punishment (law) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia|publisher=Britannica.com|accessdate=12 December 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122091559/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/93902/capital-punishment|archivedate=22 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tang dynasty===
Although many are executed in the [[Capital punishment in China|People's Republic of China]] each year in the present day, there was a time in the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907) when the death penalty was abolished.&lt;ref name="benn 8"&gt;Benn, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; This was in the year 747, enacted by [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]] (r. 712–756). When abolishing the death penalty Xuanzong ordered his officials to refer to the nearest regulation by analogy when sentencing those found guilty of crimes for which the prescribed punishment was execution. Thus depending on the severity of the crime a punishment of severe scourging with the thick rod or of exile to the remote Lingnan region might take the place of capital punishment. However, the death penalty was restored only 12 years later in 759 in response to the [[An Lushan Rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;Benn, pp. 209–210&lt;/ref&gt; At this time in the Tang dynasty only the emperor had the authority to sentence criminals to execution. Under [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Xuanzong]] capital punishment was relatively infrequent, with only 24 executions in the year 730 and 58 executions in the year 736.&lt;ref name="benn 8"/&gt;

[[File:Lingchi (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|Ling Chi – execution by [[slow slicing]] – was a form of torture and execution used in China from roughly AD 900 ([[Tang dynasty|Tang]] era) until it was banned in 1905.]]
The two most common forms of execution in the Tang dynasty were strangulation and decapitation, which were the prescribed methods of execution for 144 and 89 offences respectively. Strangulation was the prescribed sentence for lodging an accusation against one's parents or grandparents with a magistrate, scheming to kidnap a person and sell them into slavery and opening a coffin while desecrating a tomb. Decapitation was the method of execution prescribed for more serious crimes such as treason and sedition. Despite the great discomfort involved, most of the Tang Chinese preferred strangulation to decapitation, as a result of the traditional Tang Chinese belief that the body is a gift from the parents and that it is, therefore, disrespectful to one's ancestors to die without returning one's body to the grave intact.

Some further forms of capital punishment were practised in the Tang dynasty, of which the first two that follow at least were extralegal.{{Clarify|if they were extra-legal, they fail the definition of CapPun|date=July 2016}} The first of these was scourging to death with the thick rod{{Clarify|what is scourging with a thick rod? Anal?|date=July 2016}} which was common throughout the Tang dynasty especially in cases of gross corruption. The second was truncation, in which the convicted person was cut in two at the waist with a fodder knife and then left to bleed to death.&lt;ref name=Benn210&gt;Benn, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; A further form of execution called Ling Chi ([[slow slicing]]), or death by/of a thousand cuts, was used from the close of the Tang dynasty (around 900) to its abolition in 1905.

When a minister of the fifth grade or above received a death sentence the emperor might grant him a special dispensation allowing him to commit suicide in lieu of execution. Even when this privilege was not granted, the law required that the condemned minister be provided with food and ale by his keepers and transported to the execution ground in a cart rather than having to walk there.

Nearly all executions under the Tang dynasty took place in public as a warning to the population. The heads of the executed were displayed on poles or spears. When local authorities decapitated a convicted criminal, the head was boxed and sent to the capital as proof of identity and that the execution had taken place.&lt;ref name=Benn210 /&gt;

===Middle Ages===

[[File:Lamanie kolem L 001xx.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[breaking wheel]] was used during the Middle Ages and was still in use into the 19th century.]]

In [[Middle Age|medieval]] and early modern Europe, before the development of modern [[prison]] systems, the death penalty was also used as a generalized form of punishment. During the reign of [[Henry VIII of England]], as many as 72,000 people are estimated to have been executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/execution/readings/history.html|title=History of the Death Penalty|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service|accessdate=12 December 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113123001/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/execution/readings/history.html|archivedate=13 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early modern Europe, a massive [[moral panic]] regarding [[witchcraft]] swept across Europe and later the European colonies in North America. During this period, there were widespread claims that malevolent [[Satanism|Satanic]] [[witchcraft|witches]] were operating as an organized threat to [[Christendom]]. As a result, tens of thousands of women were prosecuted for witchcraft and executed through the [[witch trials in the early modern period|witch trials of the early modern period]] (between the 15th and 18th centuries).

The death penalty also targeted sexual offences such as [[sodomy]]. In England, the [[Buggery Act 1533]] stipulated hanging as punishment for "[[buggery]]". [[James Pratt and John Smith]] were the last two Englishmen to be executed for sodomy in 1835.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A Gay History of Britain: Love and Sex Between Men Since the Middle Ages | publisher=[[Greenwood World Publishing]] | last1=Cook |first1=Matt | last2=Mills |first2=Robert | last3=Trumback |first3=Randolph | last4=Cocks |first4=Harry | year=2007 |page=109| isbn=978-1846450020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the wide use of the death penalty, calls for reform were not unknown. The 12th century [[Jewish]] legal scholar, Moses [[Maimonides]], wrote, "It is better and more satisfactory to acquit a thousand guilty persons than to put a single innocent man to death." He argued that executing an accused criminal on anything less than absolute certainty would lead to a slippery slope of decreasing [[Legal burden of proof|burdens of proof]], until we would be convicting merely "according to the judge's caprice". Maimonides's concern was maintaining popular respect for law, and he saw errors of commission as much more threatening than errors of omission.&lt;ref name="Moses Maimonides 1967"&gt;Moses Maimonides, ''The Commandments, Neg. Comm. 290'', at 269–71 (Charles B. Chavel trans., 1967).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]]s in [[Baghdad]], such as [[Al-Mu'tadid]], were often cruel in their punishments.&lt;ref&gt;''The Caliphate: Its Rise, Decline, and Fall.'', [[William Muir]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2017}}

In the last several centuries, with the emergence of modern [[nation state]]s, justice came to be increasingly associated with the concept of [[natural and legal rights]]. The period saw an increase in standing police forces and permanent penitential institutions. [[Rational choice theory (criminology)|Rational choice theory]], a [[utilitarian]] approach to [[criminology]] which justifies punishment as a form of deterrence as opposed to retribution, can be traced back to [[Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria|Cesare Beccaria]], whose influential treatise ''[[Dei delitti e delle pene|On Crimes and Punishments]]'' (1764) was the first detailed analysis of capital punishment to demand the abolition of the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195396607/obo-9780195396607-0007.xml|title=Rational Choice Theories|work=Oxford Bibliographies|author=John Paul Wright|date=14 December 2009|accessdate=3 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119232533/http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195396607/obo-9780195396607-0007.xml|archivedate=19 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimring2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Franklin E.

Official recognition of this phenomenon led to executions being carried out inside prisons, away from public view.

In England in the 18th century, when there was no police force, there was a large increase in the number of capital offences to more than 200. These were mainly property offences, for example cutting down a cherry tree in an orchard.&lt;ref name="JonesJohnstone2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mark Jones|author2=Peter Johnstone|title=History of Criminal Justice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qhPdaCJWQikC&amp;pg=PA152|date=22 July 2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-4377-3491-1|pages=150–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1820, there were 160, including crimes such as shoplifting, petty theft or stealing cattle.&lt;ref&gt;Durant, Will and Ariel, ''The Story of Civilization, Volume IX: The Age of Voltaire'' New York, 1965, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; The severity of the so-called [[Bloody Code]] was often tempered by juries who refused to convict, or judges, in the case of petty theft, who arbitrarily set the value stolen at below the statutory level for a capital crime.&lt;ref&gt;Durant, Will and Ariel, ''The Story of Civilization, Volume IX: The Age of Voltaire'' New York, 1965, p. 72,&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
[[File:Mexican execution, 1914.jpg|left|thumb|Mexican execution by firing squad, 1916]]

In [[Nazi Germany#Law|Nazi Germany]] there were three types of capital punishment; hanging, decapitation and death by shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gN0QgcW4Td0C&amp;pg=PA289&amp;lpg=PA289|page= 289|title=The criminal law of Japan: the general part|author=Dando Shigemitsu|year=1999|isbn= 9780837706535}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, modern military organisations employed capital punishment as a means of maintaining military discipline. In the past, [[cowardice]], absence without leave, [[desertion]], [[insubordination]], [[looting]], shirking under enemy fire and disobeying orders were often crimes punishable by death (see [[Decimation (Roman army)|decimation]] and [[running the gauntlet]]). One method of execution, since firearms came into common use, has also been [[firing squad]], although some countries use execution with a single shot to the head or neck.

Various authoritarian states—for example those with fascist or Communist governments—employed the death penalty as a potent means of [[political repression|political oppression]]. According to [[Robert Conquest]], the leading expert on [[Joseph Stalin#Famine and the Great Terror: 1932–1939|Joseph Stalin's purges]], more than one million [[Soviet Union#Stalin era|Soviet citizens were executed]] during [[the Great Terror]] of 1937–38, almost all by a bullet to the back of the head.&lt;ref&gt;Conquest, Robert, ''[[The Great Terror]]: A Reassessment'', New York, pp. 485–86&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mao Zedong]] publicly stated that "800,000" people had been executed in China during the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966-1976). Partly as a response to such excesses, civil rights organizations started to place increasing emphasis on the concept of [[human rights]] and an abolition of the death penalty.

===Contemporary era===

Among countries around the world,  all European (except [[Capital punishment in Belarus|Belarus]]) and many [[Oceania|Oceanic]] states (including [[Capital punishment in Australia|Australia]], [[Capital punishment in New Zealand|New Zealand]] and [[East Timor]]), and [[Capital punishment in Canada|Canada]] have abolished capital punishment. In [[Latin America]], most states have completely abolished the use of capital punishment, while some countries such as [[Capital punishment in Brazil|Brazil]] and [[Capital punishment in Guatemala|Guatemala]] allow for capital punishment only in exceptional situations, such as treason committed during wartime. The [[Capital punishment in the United States|United States]] (the federal government and 31 of the states), some [[Caribbean]] countries and the majority of countries in Asia (for example, [[Capital punishment in Japan|Japan]] and [[Capital punishment in India|India]]) retain capital punishment. In Africa, less than half of countries retain it, for example [[Capital punishment in Botswana|Botswana]] and [[Zambia]]. South Africa [[Capital punishment in South Africa|abolished the death penalty]] in 1995.

Abolition was often adopted due to political change, as when countries shifted from authoritarianism to democracy, or when it became an entry condition for the European Union. The United States is a notable exception: some states have had bans on capital punishment for decades, the earliest being [[Michigan]] where it was abolished in 1846, while other states still actively use it today. The death penalty in the United States remains a contentious issue which is [[Capital punishment debate in the United States|hotly debated]].

In retentionist countries, the debate is sometimes revived when a miscarriage of justice has occurred though this tends to cause legislative efforts to improve the judicial process rather than to abolish the death penalty. In abolitionist countries, the debate is sometimes revived by particularly brutal murders though few countries have brought it back after abolishing it. However, a spike in serious, violent crimes, such as murders or terrorist attacks, has prompted some countries to effectively end the moratorium on the death penalty. One notable example is [[Capital punishment in Pakistan|Pakistan]] which in December 2014 lifted a six-year moratorium on executions after the [[2014 Peshawar school massacre|Peshawar school massacre]] during which 132 students and 9 members of staff of the Army Public School and Degree College Peshawar were killed by [[Taliban]] terrorists. Since then, Pakistan has executed over 400 convicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= 465 prisoners sent to gallows since 2014, says report |url= https://tribune.com.pk/story/1451615/465-prisoners-sent-gallows-since-2014-says-report/ |publisher= tribune.com.pk |accessdate= July 19, 2017 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170706181850/https://tribune.com.pk/story/1451615/465-prisoners-sent-gallows-since-2014-says-report/ |archivedate= 6 July 2017 |df= dmy-all |date= 2017-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Movements towards non-painful execution==
{{Further|Cruel and unusual punishment}}
[[File:SQ Lethal Injection Room.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A gurney at [[San Quentin State Prison]] in [[California]] used for executions by [[lethal injection]]]]
Trends in most of the world have long been to move to private and less painful executions. France developed the [[guillotine]] for this reason in the final years of the 18th century, while Britain banned [[Hanged, drawn and quartered|drawing and quartering]] in the early 19th century. [[Hanging]] by turning the victim off a ladder or by kicking a stool or a bucket, which causes death by suffocation, was replaced by [[hanging|long drop "hanging"]] where the subject is dropped a longer distance to [[Cervical dislocation|dislocate the neck]] and sever the [[spinal cord]]. [[Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar]], [[Qajar dynasty#Qajar Shahs of Persia, 1794–1925|Shah of Persia (1896-1907)]] introduced throat-cutting and [[blowing from a gun]] (close-range cannon fire) as quick and relatively painless alternatives to more torturous methods of executions used at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=http://explorion.net/ride-india-across-persia-and-baluchistan/chapter-vii-ispahan-shiraz?page=3&amp;quicktabs_3=1|title=A Ride to India across Persia and Baluchistan|year=1901|chapter=Ispahan - Shiraz|publisher=Explorion.net|accessdate=23 February 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718200923/http://explorion.net/ride-india-across-persia-and-baluchistan/chapter-vii-ispahan-shiraz?page=3&amp;quicktabs_3=1|archivedate=18 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, [[electrocution]] and [[gas chamber|gas inhalation]] were introduced as more humane alternatives to hanging, but have been almost entirely superseded by [[lethal injection]]. A small number of countries still employ slow hanging methods and [[stoning]].

A study of executions carried out in the United States between 1977 and 2001 indicated that at least 34 of the 749 executions, or 4.5%, involved "unanticipated problems or delays that caused, at least arguably, unnecessary agony for the prisoner or that reflect gross incompetence of the executioner". The rate of these "botched executions" remained steady over the period of the study.&lt;ref&gt;Borg and Radelet, pp. 144–47&lt;/ref&gt; A separate study published in ''[[The Lancet]]'' in 2005 found that in 43% of cases of lethal injection, the blood level of [[hypnotic]]s was insufficient to guarantee unconsciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Van Norman p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in 2008 (''[[Baze v. Rees]]'') and again in 2015 (''[[Glossip v. Gross]]'') that lethal injection does not constitute [[cruel and unusual punishment]].&lt;ref&gt;Paternoster, R. (2012-09-18). Capital Punishment.

Many countries have abolished capital punishment either in law or in practice. Since [[World War II]] there has been a trend toward abolishing capital punishment. Capital punishment has been completely abolished by 102 countries, a further six have done so for all offences except under special circumstances and 32 more have abolished it in practice because they have not used it for at least 10 years and are believed to have a policy or established practice against carrying out executions.&lt;ref name="amnesty2015"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act50/3487/2016/en/ |title=Death Sentences and Executions Report 2015 |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |access-date=10 August 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814003146/https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act50/3487/2016/en/ |archivedate=14 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The death penalty was banned in China between 747 and 759. In Japan, [[Emperor Saga]] abolished the death penalty in 818 under the influence of Shinto and it lasted until 1156.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=1472|title=Encyclopedia of Shinto|publisher=kokugakuin.ac.jp|accessdate=5 September 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519153543/http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=1472|archivedate=19 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, a public statement of opposition was included in [[The Twelve Conclusions of the Lollards]], written in 1395. Sir [[Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', published in 1516, debated the benefits of the death penalty in dialogue form, coming to no firm conclusion.  More was himself executed for treason in 1535. More recent opposition to the death penalty stemmed from the book of the Italian [[Cesare Beccaria]] ''Dei Delitti e Delle Pene'' ("[[On Crimes and Punishments]]"), published in 1764. In this book, Beccaria aimed to demonstrate not only the injustice, but even the futility from the point of view of [[social policy|social welfare]], of [[torture]] and the death penalty. Influenced by the book, [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Grand Duke Leopold II]] of Habsburg, the future Emperor of Austria, abolished the death penalty in the then-independent [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]], the first permanent abolition in modern times.  On 30 November 1786, after having ''de facto'' blocked executions (the last was in 1769), Leopold promulgated the reform of the [[penal code]] that abolished the death penalty and ordered the destruction of all the instruments for capital execution in his land. In 2000, Tuscany's regional authorities instituted an annual holiday on 30 November to commemorate the event. The event is commemorated on this day by 300 cities around the world celebrating [[Cities for Life Day]].

The [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] banned capital punishment in 1849. [[Venezuela]] followed suit and abolished the death penalty in 1863&lt;ref&gt;Roger G. Hood. ''The death penalty: a worldwide perspective'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2002. p10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- previous cite was for 1854 but this article doesn't even mention the death penalty as far as I can see. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/venezuela/5.htm|title=Venezuela: A Country Study (The Century of Caudillismo)|publisher=countrystudies.us|accessdate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; and [[Use of capital punishment by nation|San Marino]] did so in 1865. The last execution in San Marino had taken place in 1468. In Portugal, after legislative proposals in 1852 and 1863, the death penalty was abolished in 1867. The last execution of the death penalty in Brazil was 1876, from there all the condemnations were commuted by the Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] until it's abolition for civil offences and military offences in peacetime in 1891. The penalty for crimes committed in peacetime was then reinstated and abolished again twice (1938–53 and 1969–78), but on those occasions it was restricted to acts of terrorism or subversion considered "internal warfare" and all sentence were commuted and were not carried out.

Abolition occurred in [[Capital punishment in Canada#History|Canada in 1976 (except for some military offences, with complete abolition in 1998)]], in [[Capital punishment in France#Abolition|France in 1981]], and in [[Capital punishment in Australia#Commonwealth|Australia in 1973]] (although the state of [[Capital punishment in Australia#Western Australia|Western Australia]] retained the penalty until 1984). In 1977, the United Nations General Assembly affirmed in a formal resolution that throughout the world, it is desirable to "progressively restrict the number of offences for which the death penalty might be imposed, with a view to the desirability of abolishing this punishment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsbatch.com/deathpenalty.htm|title=Death Penalty|publisher=Newsbatch.com|date=1 March 2005|accessdate=23 August 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724130457/http://www.newsbatch.com/deathpenalty.htm|archivedate=24 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, it was abolished for murder (leaving only [[treason]], [[piracy with violence]], [[arson in royal dockyards]] and a number of wartime military offences as capital crimes) for a five-year experiment in 1965 and permanently in 1969, the last execution having taken place in 1964.

Georgia]]'' case, but the 1976 ''[[Gregg v. Georgia]]'' case once again permitted the death penalty under certain circumstances. Further limitations were placed on the death penalty in ''[[Atkins v. Virginia]]'' (death penalty unconstitutional for people with an [[intellectual disability]]) and ''[[Roper v. Simmons]]'' (death penalty unconstitutional if defendant was under age 18 at the time the crime was committed). In the United States, 18 states and the [[District of Columbia]] ban capital punishment.

Abolitionists believe capital punishment is the worst violation of [[human rights]], because the [[right to life]] is the most important, and capital punishment violates it without necessity and inflicts to the condemned a [[psychological torture]]. Human rights activists oppose the death penalty, calling it "cruel, inhuman, and degrading punishment". [[Amnesty International]] considers it to be "the ultimate, irreversible denial of Human Rights".&lt;ref name="Abolish the death penalty"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/death-penalty|title=Abolish the death penalty|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=23 August 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830062328/http://www.amnesty.org/en/death-penalty|archivedate=30 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Amnesty International, 23 countries are known to have performed executions in 2016.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act50/5740/2017/en/|title=Document|website=www.amnesty.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011071624/https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act50/5740/2017/en/|archivedate=11 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are countries which do not publish information on the use of capital punishment, most significantly China and [[Capital punishment in North Korea|North Korea]].

The death penalty was overwhelmingly practised in poor and authoritarian states, which often employed the death penalty as a tool of political oppression. During the 1980s, the democratisation of Latin America swelled the ranks of abolitionist countries.

This was soon followed by the fall of [[Communism]] in [[Europe]]. Many of the countries which restored democracy aspired to enter the [[European Union|EU]]. The [[European Union]] and the [[Council of Europe]] both strictly require [[List of European Union member states|member states]] not to practise the death penalty (see [[Capital punishment in Europe]]). Public support for the death penalty in the EU varies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?did=2165 |title=International Polls &amp; Studies |publisher=The [[Death Penalty Information Center]] |accessdate=1 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203428/http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?did=2165 |archivedate=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last execution in a member state of the present-day Council of Europe took place in 1997 in [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hub.coe.int/what-we-do/human-rights/death-penalty |title=Death Penalty – Council of Europe |publisher=Hub.coe.int |accessdate=11 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140205224923/http://hub.coe.int/what-we-do/human-rights/death-penalty |archivedate=5 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.handsoffcain.info/bancadati/schedastato.php?idcontinente=20&amp;nome=ukraine |title=HANDS OFF CAIN against death penalty in the world |publisher=Handsoffcain.info |accessdate=11 February 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203235754/http://www.handsoffcain.info/bancadati/schedastato.php?idcontinente=20&amp;nome=ukraine |archivedate=3 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the rapid industrialisation in Asia has seen an increase in the number of developed countries which are also retentionist. In these countries, the death penalty retains strong public support, and the matter receives little attention from the government or the media; in [[China]] there is a small but significant and growing movement to abolish the death penalty altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cadpnet.com/show.asp?id=689 |title=China Against Death Penalty (CADP) |publisher=Cadpnet.com |date=31 March 2012 |accessdate=12 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027173245/https://www.cadpnet.com/show.asp?id=689 |archivedate=27 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend has been followed by some African and Middle Eastern countries where support for the death penalty remains high.

Some countries have resumed practising the death penalty after having previously suspended the practice for long periods. The United States suspended executions in 1972 but resumed them in 1976; there was no execution in India between 1995 and 2004; and [[Sri Lanka]] declared an end to its [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] on the death penalty on 20 November 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details_p.asp?NewsID=16269 |title=AIUK : Sri Lanka: President urged to prevent return to death penalty after 29-year moratorium |publisher=Amnesty.org.uk |accessdate=23 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605115738/http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details_p.asp?NewsID=16269 |archivedate=5 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although it has not yet performed any further executions. The [[Philippines]] re-introduced the death penalty in 1993 after abolishing it in 1987, but again abolished it in 2006.

The United States and Japan are the only developed countries to have recently carried out executions. The U.S. federal government, the U.S. military, and 31 states have a valid death penalty statute, and over 1,400 executions have been carried in the United States since it reinstated the death penalty in 1976, including 28 in 2015 alone. Japan has 111 inmates with finalized death sentences {{as of|2018|July|26|lc=y|df=US}}; after executing [[Shoko Asahara]] and six other senior members of [[Aum Shinrikyo]], a cult group which carried out multiple atrocities involving thousands of victims such as [[Tokyo subway sarin attack|the Tokyo subway sarin attack,]] which took place on March 20, 1995, on July 6&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=July 6, 2018|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/07/06/national/crime-legal/aum-founders-execution-paves-way-debate-japan-death-penalty/|title=Aum founder Shoko Asahara's execution leads to renewed debate in Japan on death penalty|publisher=Japan Times|accessdate=July 24, 2018|newspaper=The Japan Times Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; the executions of the remaining six senior members took place on July 26.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=July 26, 2018|url=https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20180726/p2g/00m/0dm/035000c|title=Japan hangs 6 remaining AUM death row inmates|publisher=Mainichi|accessdate=July 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Juvenile offenders===
{{category see also|Executed juvenile offenders}}

The death penalty for [[Adolescence|juvenile]] offenders (criminals aged under 18 years at the time of their crime although the legal or accepted definition of ''juvenile offender'' may vary from one jurisdiction to another) has become increasingly rare. Considering the [[Age of Majority|age of majority]] is still not 18 in some countries or has not been clearly defined in law, since 1990 ten countries have executed offenders who were considered juveniles at the time of their crimes: The [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC), [[Bangladesh]], [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Japan]], [[Nigeria]], [[Pakistan]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Sudan]], the [[United States]], and [[Yemen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationaljusticeproject.org/juvWorld.cfm |title=Juvenile executions (except US) |publisher=Internationaljusticeproject.org |accessdate=23 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726182207/https://www.internationaljusticeproject.org/juvWorld.cfm |archivedate=26 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The PRC&lt;!--Refer to it as PRC to avoid confusion with the ROC on Taiwan--&gt;, Pakistan, the United States, Yemen and Iran have since raised the minimum age to 18.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iranwpd.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=3066:iran-changes-law-for-execution-of-juveniles&amp;Itemid=64 |title=Iran changes law for execution of juveniles |publisher=Iranwpd.com |date=10 February 2012 |accessdate=30 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429231704/http://iranwpd.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=3066%3Airan-changes-law-for-execution-of-juveniles&amp;Itemid=64 |archivedate=29 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ghanoononline.ir/NSite/FullStory/News/?Serv=19&amp;Id=16270 |title=مجازات قصاص برای افراد زیر 18 سال ممنوع شد |publisher=Ghanoononline.ir |accessdate=12 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213111337/http://www.ghanoononline.ir/NSite/FullStory/News/?Serv=19&amp;Id=16270 |archivedate=13 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International has recorded 61 verified executions since then, in several countries, of both juveniles and adults who had been convicted of committing their offences as juveniles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/death-penalty/executions-of-child-offenders-since-1990 |title=Executions of juveniles since 1990 |publisher=Amnesty International |accessdate=12 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121204044639/http://www.amnesty.org/en/death-penalty/executions-of-child-offenders-since-1990 |archivedate=4 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The PRC does not allow for the execution of those under 18, but child executions have reportedly taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act50/015/2004/en/|title=Stop Child Executions!

Between 2005 and May 2008, Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Yemen were reported to have executed child offenders, the largest number occurring in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/pub/2008/children/HRW.Juv.Death.Penalty.053008.pdf|title=HRW Report|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=23 August 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113084648/http://www.hrw.org/pub/2008/children/HRW.Juv.Death.Penalty.053008.pdf|archivedate=13 November 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Hassan Rouhani]]’s current tenure as president of Iran since 2013, at least 3,602 death sentences have been carried out. This includes the executions of 34 juvenile offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://iran-hrm.com/index.php/2018/10/08/cruel-and-inhuman-executions-in-iran/ | title=Annual report on the death penalty in Iran, October 2018| date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://irannewswire.org/iran-executes-female-juvenile-offender-despite-grossly-unfair-legal-process/ | title=Iran executes female juvenile offender despite grossly unfair legal process| date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], which forbids capital punishment for juveniles under article 37(a), has been signed by all countries and subsequently [[ratification|ratified]] by all signatories with the exceptions of [[Somalia]] and the United States (despite the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] decisions abolishing the practice).&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF, [http://www.unicef.org/crc/index_30229.html Convention of the Rights of the Child – FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125094459/http://www.unicef.org/crc/index_30229.html |date=25 January 2016 }}: "The Convention on the Rights of the Child is the most widely and rapidly ratified human rights treaty in history. Only two countries, Somalia and the United States, have not ratified this celebrated agreement. Somalia is currently unable to proceed to ratification as it has no recognised government. By signing the Convention, the United States has signaled its intention to ratify but has yet to do so."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights]] maintains that the death penalty for juveniles has become contrary to a [[jus cogens]] of [[customary international law]]. A majority of countries are also party to the U.N. [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (whose Article 6.5 also states that "Sentence of death shall not be imposed for crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of age...").

Iran, despite its ratification of the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] and [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], was the world's largest executioner of juvenile offenders, for which it has been the subject of broad international condemnation; the country's record is the focus of the [[Stop Child Executions Campaign]]. But on 10 February 2012, Iran's parliament changed controversial laws relating to the execution of juveniles. In the new legislation the age of 18 (solar year) would be applied to accused of both genders and juvenile offenders must be sentenced pursuant to a separate law specifically dealing with juveniles.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Based on the Islamic law which now seems to have been revised, girls at the age of 9 and boys at 15 of lunar year (11 days shorter than a solar year) are deemed fully responsible for their crimes.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Iran accounted for two-thirds of the global total of such executions, and currently{{update after|2014|8|15}} has approximately 140 people considered as juveniles awaiting execution for crimes committed (up from 71 in 2007).&lt;ref name=AP&gt;[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-09-17-child-executions_N.htm Iranian activists fight child executions], Ali Akbar Dareini, [[Associated Press]], 17 September 2008.

Japan has not executed juvenile criminals after August 1997, when they executed [[Norio Nagayama]], a [[spree killer]] who had been convicted of shooting four people dead in the late 1960s. Nagayama's case created the eponymously named [[Norio Nagayama|''Nagayama'' ''standards'']], which take into account factors such as the number of victims, brutality and social impact of the crimes. The standards have been used in determining whether to apply the death sentence in murder cases. [[Teruhiko Seki]], convicted of murdering four members including a 4-year-old daughter and raping a 15-year-old daughter of a family in 1992, became the second inmate to be hanged for a crime committed as a minor in the first such execution in 20 years after Nagayama on December 19, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=December 19, 2017|url=https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2017/12/881eeda07930-japan-hangs-2-death-row-inmates-sources.html |title=Japan hangs 2 inmates including man who killed 4 as minor |publisher=Kyodo News|accessdate=July 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Takayuki Fukuda|Takayuki Otsuki]], who was convicted of raping and strangling a 23-year-old woman and subsequently strangling her 11-month-old daughter to death on April 14, 1999, when he was 18, is another inmate sentenced to death, and his request for retrial has been rejected by the [[Supreme Court of Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=October 30, 2012|url=https://japantoday.com/category/crime/man-sentenced-to-death-for-killing-mother-baby-daughter-in-1999-seeks-retrial |title=Man sentenced to death for killing mother, baby daughter in 1999 seeks retrial |publisher=Japan Today|accessdate=July 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public execution===
{{main|Public execution}}
A public execution is a form of capital punishment which "members of the general public may voluntarily attend". This definition excludes the presence of a small number of witnesses randomly selected to assure executive accountability.&lt;ref name=blum&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blum |first=Steven A. |date=Winter 1992 |title=Public Executions: Understand the "Cruel and Unusual Punishments" Clause |url=http://www.hastingsconlawquarterly.org/archives/V19/I2/Blum.pdf |journal=Hastings Constitutional Law Quarterly |volume=19 |issue=2 |page=415 |doi= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326225628/http://www.hastingsconlawquarterly.org/archives/V19/I2/Blum.pdf |archivedate=26 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; While today the great majority of the world considers public executions to be distasteful and most countries have outlawed the practice, throughout much of history executions were performed publicly as a means for the state to demonstrate "its power before those who fell under its jurisdiction be they criminals, enemies, or political opponents". Additionally, it afforded the public a chance to witness "what was considered a great spectacle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cawthorne |first=Nigel |date=2006 |title=Public Executions: From Ancient Rome to the Present Day |url= |location= |publisher= |pages=6–7 |isbn=978-0-7858-2119-9 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social historians note that beginning in the 20th century in the U.S. and western Europe death in general became increasingly shielded from public view, occurring more and more behind the closed doors of the hospital.&lt;ref name=chambliss&gt;{{cite book|author=William J.

==Capital crime==

===Crimes against humanity===
Crimes against humanity such as [[genocide]] are usually punishable by death in countries retaining capital punishment. Death sentences for such crimes were handed down and carried out during the [[Nuremberg Trials]] in 1946 and the [[Tokyo Trials]] in 1948, but the current [[International Criminal Court]] does not use capital punishment. The maximum penalty available to the International Criminal Court is [[life imprisonment]].

===Murder===
Intentional homicide is punishable by death in most countries retaining capital punishment, but generally provided it involves an [[aggravating factor]] required by statute or judicial precedents.

===Drug trafficking===
{{main|Capital punishment for drug trafficking}}
[[File:CKS Airport drugs sign.JPG|thumb|A sign at the [[Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport]] warns arriving travelers that drug trafficking is a capital crime in the Republic of China (photo taken in 2005)]]
Some countries provide the death penalty for [[drug trafficking]] and related offences, mostly in [[West Asia]], [[South Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]] and [[East Asia]]. Among countries who regularly execute drug offenders are China, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Singapore.

===Other offences===
{{See also|Capital punishment for non-violent offenses}}

===Retribution===
[[File: Karl Morgenschweis prays for Franz Strasser.jpg|thumb|Execution of a [[war crimes|war criminal]] in 1946]]
Supporters of the death penalty argued that death penalty is morally justified when applied in murder especially with aggravating elements such as for murder of [[police officers]], [[child murder]], [[torture murder]], multiple [[homicide]] and [[mass killing]] such as [[terrorism]], [[massacre]] and [[genocide]]. This argument is strongly defended by [[New York Law School]]'s Professor [[Robert Blecker Wants Me Dead|Robert Blecker]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nyls.edu/faculty/faculty_profiles/robert_blecker/ |title=New York Law School :: Robert Blecker |publisher=Nyls.edu |access-date=14 April 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902231929/http://www.nyls.edu/faculty/faculty_profiles/robert_blecker/ |archivedate=2 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; who says that the punishment must be painful in proportion to the crime. Eighteenth-century philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] defended a more extreme position, according to which every murderer deserves to die on the grounds that loss of life is incomparable to any jail term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.american.edu/dgolash/Kant_on_Punishment.html/ |title=Immanuel Kant, The Philosophy of Right |publisher=American.edu |access-date=6 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140217232041/http://www1.american.edu/dgolash/Kant_on_Punishment.html |archive-date=17 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some abolitionists argue that retribution is simply revenge and cannot be condoned. Others while accepting retribution as an element of criminal justice nonetheless argue that [[life without parole]] is a sufficient substitute. It is also argued that the punishing of a killing with another death is a relatively unique punishment for a violent act, because in general violent crimes are not punished by subjecting the perpetrator to a similar act (e.g. rapists are not punished by [[judicial corporal punishment|corporal punishment]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/capitalpunishment/against_1.shtml#section_4 |title=Ethics – Capital punishment: Arguments against capital punishment |publisher=BBC |date=1 January 1970 |access-date=11 February 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209003504/http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/capitalpunishment/against_1.shtml#section_4 |archivedate=9 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abolitionists believe capital punishment is the worst violation of [[human rights]], because the [[right to life]] is the most important, and capital punishment violates it without necessity and inflicts to the condemned a [[psychological torture]]. Human rights activists oppose the death penalty, calling it "[[cruel and unusual punishment|cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment]]". [[Amnesty International]] considers it to be "the ultimate irreversible denial of Human Rights".&lt;ref name="Abolish the death penalty"/&gt; [[Albert Camus]] wrote in a 1956 book called ''Reflections on the Guillotine, Resistance, Rebellion &amp; Death'':

{{Quote|An execution is not simply death. It is just as different from the privation of life as a concentration camp is from prison. [...] For there to be an equivalency, the death penalty would have to punish a criminal who had warned his victim of the date at which he would inflict a horrible death on him and who, from that moment onward, had confined him at his mercy for months. Such a monster is not encountered in private life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://people.smu.edu/rhalperi/ |title=Death Penalty News &amp; Updates |publisher=People.smu.edu |accessdate=14 April 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413081015/http://people.smu.edu/rhalperi/ |archivedate=13 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the classic doctrine of [[natural rights]] as expounded by for instance [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[William Blackstone|Blackstone]], on the other hand, it is an important idea that the right to life can be forfeited.&lt;ref name=feinberg&gt;Joel Feinberg: [http://www.tannerlectures.utah.edu/lectures/documents/feinberg80.pdf Voluntary Euthanasia and the Inalienable Right to Life] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021073901/http://www.tannerlectures.utah.edu/lectures/documents/feinberg80.pdf |date=21 October 2012 }} [[Tanner Lectures on Human Values|The Tanner Lecture on Human Values]], 1 April 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[John Stuart Mill]] explained in a speech given in Parliament against an amendment to abolish capital punishment for murder in 1868:

{{Quote|And we may imagine somebody asking how we can teach people not to inflict suffering by ourselves inflicting it? But to this I should answer – all of us would answer – that to deter by suffering from inflicting suffering is not only possible, but the very purpose of penal justice. Does fining a criminal show want of respect for property, or imprisoning him, for personal freedom? Just as unreasonable is it to think that to take the life of a man who has taken that of another is to show want of regard for human life. We show, on the contrary, most emphatically our regard for it, by the adoption of a rule that he who violates that right in another forfeits it for himself, and that while no other crime that he can commit deprives him of his right to live, this shall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ethics.sandiego.edu/books/Mill/Punishment/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508233912/http://ethics.sandiego.edu/Books/Mill/Punishment/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 May 2013 |title=John Stuart Mill, Speech on Capital Punishment |publisher=Sandiego.edu |accessdate=6 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Wrongful execution===
[[File:Timothy Evans Grave.JPG|thumb|Capital punishment was abolished in the United Kingdom in part because of the case of [[Timothy Evans]], an innocent man who was hanged in 1950 after being wrongfully convicted of two murders that had been committed by his neighbour.]]
{{Main|Wrongful execution}}

It is frequently argued that capital punishment leads to [[miscarriage of justice]] through the wrongful execution of innocent persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?did=412|title=Innocence and the Death Penalty|publisher=Deathpenaltyinfo.org|accessdate=23 August 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080701205425/http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?did=412|archivedate=1 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people have been proclaimed innocent victims of the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://capitaldefenseweekly.com/innocent.html Capital Defense Weekly&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070804222621/http://capitaldefenseweekly.com/innocent.html |date=4 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justicedenied.org/executed.htm|title=Executed Innocents|publisher=Justicedenied.org|accessdate=23 August 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124184742/http://justicedenied.org/executed.htm|archivedate=24 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mitglied.lycos.de/PeterWill/penal9.htm|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090522224521/http://mitglied.lycos.de/PeterWill/penal9.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=22 May 2009|title=Wrongful executions|publisher=Mitglied.lycos.de|accessdate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have claimed that as many as 39 executions have been carried out in the face of compelling evidence of innocence or serious doubt about guilt in the US from 1992 through 2004. Newly available [[DNA evidence]] prevented the pending execution of more than 15 [[death row]] inmates during the same period in the US,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innocenceproject.org/Content/575.php |title=The Innocence Project – News and Information: Press Releases |publisher=Innoccenceproject.org |accessdate=23 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702223208/http://www.innocenceproject.org/Content/575.php |archivedate=2 July 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; but DNA evidence is only available in a fraction of capital cases.&lt;ref name="CB2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lundin|first=Leigh|title=Casey Anthony Trial– Aftermath|url=http://criminalbrief.com/?p=17459|work=Capital Punishment|publisher=Criminal Brief|location=Orlando|date=10 July 2011|quote=With 400 condemned on death row, Florida is an extremely aggressive death penalty state, a state that will even execute for drug trafficking.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911200202/http://criminalbrief.com/?p=17459|archivedate=11 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2017}}, 159 prisoners on death row have been exonerated by DNA or other evidence, which is seen as an indication that innocent prisoners have almost certainly been executed.&lt;ref&gt;Van Norman p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DPIC2015/&gt; It is impossible to assess how many have been wrongly executed, since courts do not generally investigate the innocence of a dead defendant, and defense attorneys tend to concentrate their efforts on clients whose lives can still be saved; however, there is strong evidence of innocence in many cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/executed-possibly-innocent#also|title=Executed But Possibly Innocent &amp;#124; Death Penalty Information Center|publisher=Deathpenaltyinfo.org|accessdate=30 April 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413152426/http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/executed-possibly-innocent#also|archivedate=13 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Improper procedure may also result in unfair executions. For example, [[Amnesty International]] argues that in [[Singapore]] "the [[Misuse of Drugs Act (Singapore)|Misuse of Drugs Act]] contains a series of presumptions which shift the burden of proof from the prosecution to the accused. This conflicts with the universally guaranteed right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty".&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, [https://www.amnesty.org/documents/asa36/001/2004/en "Singapore – The death penalty: A hidden toll of executions"] (January 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; This refers to a situation when someone is caught with drugs. In this situation, in almost any jurisdiction, the prosecution has a [[prima facie]] case.

===Racial, ethnic and social class bias===
Opponents of the death penalty argue that this punishment is being used more often against perpetrators from racial and ethnic minorities and from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, than against those criminals who come from a privileged background; and that the background of the victim also influences the outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/death-penalty/us-death-penalty-facts/death-penalty-and-race |title=Death Penalty and Race &amp;#124; Amnesty International USA |publisher=Amnestyusa.org |accessdate=11 February 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209235831/http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/death-penalty/us-death-penalty-facts/death-penalty-and-race |archivedate=9 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eji.org/deathpenalty/racialbias |title=Racial Bias &amp;#124; Equal Justice Initiative |publisher=Eji.org |accessdate=11 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001080516/http://www.eji.org/deathpenalty/racialbias |archivedate=1 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncadp.org/pages/racial-bias |title=Racial Bias &amp;#124; National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty |publisher=Ncadp.org |date=1999-03-18 |accessdate=2014-07-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140602161510/http://www.ncadp.org/pages/racial-bias |archivedate=2 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have shown that white Americans are more likely to support the death penalty when told that it is mostly applied to African Americans,&lt;ref name="peffley-2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peffley|first=Mark|last2=Hurwitz|first2=Jon|title=Persuasion and Resistance: Race and the Death Penalty in America|journal=American Journal of Political Science|year=2007|volume=51|issue=4|pages=996–1012|url=http://www.unc.edu/~fbaum/teaching/articles/AJPS-20007-Peffley.pdf|accessdate=3 May 2014|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00293.x|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503085353/http://www.unc.edu/~fbaum/teaching/articles/AJPS-20007-Peffley.pdf|archivedate=3 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that more stereotypically black-looking defendants are more likely to be sentenced to death if the case involves a white victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eberhardt|first1=J.

Again in 2008, a large majority of states from all regions adopted a second resolution calling for a moratorium on the use of the death penalty in the UN General Assembly (Third Committee) on 20 November. 105 countries voted in favour of the draft resolution, 48 voted against and 31 abstained.

A range of amendments proposed by a small minority of pro-death penalty countries were overwhelmingly defeated. It had in 2007 passed a non-binding resolution (by 104 to 54, with 29 abstentions) by asking its member states for "a moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSN1849885920071218|title=U.N.

[[File:04CFREU-Article2-Crop.jpg|thumb|left|Article 2 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] affirms the prohibition on capital punishment in the [[European Union|EU]]]]

A number of regional conventions prohibit the death penalty, most notably, the Sixth Protocol (abolition in time of peace) and the 13th Protocol (abolition in all circumstances) to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. The same is also stated under the Second Protocol in the [[American Convention on Human Rights]], which, however has not been ratified by all countries in the Americas, most notably Canada and the United States. Most relevant operative international treaties do not require its prohibition for cases of serious crime, most notably, the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]. This instead has, in common with several other treaties, an optional protocol prohibiting capital punishment and promoting its wider abolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr-death.htm |title=Second Optional Protocol to the ICCPR |accessdate=8 December 2007 |publisher=Office of the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121143327/http://www.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr-death.htm |archivedate=21 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several international organizations have made the abolition of the death penalty (during time of peace) a requirement of membership, most notably the [[European Union]] (EU) and the [[Council of Europe]]. The EU and the Council of Europe are willing to accept a [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] as an interim measure. Thus, while [[Capital punishment in Russia|Russia]] is a member of the Council of Europe, and the death penalty remains codified in its law, it has not made use of it since becoming a member of the Council – Russia has not executed anyone since 1996. With the exception of Russia (abolitionist in practice), [[Capital punishment in Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan]] (abolitionist for ordinary crimes only), and [[Capital punishment in Belarus|Belarus]] (retentionist), all European countries are classified as abolitionist.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt;

[[Capital punishment in Latvia|Latvia]] abolished ''de jure'' the death penalty for war crimes in 2012, becoming the last EU member to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/death-penalty/death-sentences-and-executions-in-2012 |title=The Death Penalty in 2012 &amp;#124; Amnesty International |publisher=Amnesty.org |date=9 April 2013 |accessdate=11 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029232445/http://www.amnesty.org/en/death-penalty/death-sentences-and-executions-in-2012 |archivedate=29 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=187&amp;CM=&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG Protocol no.13] calls for the abolition of the death penalty in all circumstances (including for war crimes). The majority of European countries have signed and ratified it. Some European countries have not done this, but all of them except Belarus and Kazakhstan have now abolished the death penalty in all circumstances (''de jure'', and Russia ''de facto'').

In [[Turkey]], over 500 people were sentenced to death after the [[1980 Turkish coup d'état]]. About 50 of them were executed, the last one 25 October 1984.&lt;!--- Hidir Aslan ---&gt; Then there was a ''de facto'' moratorium on the death penalty in Turkey.    As a move [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|towards EU membership]], Turkey made some legal changes. The death penalty was removed from peacetime law by [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|the National Assembly]] in August 2002, and in May 2004 Turkey amended [[Constitution of Turkey|its constitution]] in order to remove capital punishment in all circumstances. It ratified Protocol no. 13 to the European Convention on Human Rights in February 2006. As a result, Europe is a continent free of the death penalty in practice, all states but Russia, which has entered a moratorium, having ratified the Sixth Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights, with the sole exception of [[Capital punishment in Belarus|Belarus]], which is not a member of the Council of Europe. The [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] has been lobbying for Council of Europe observer states who practise the death penalty, the U.S. and Japan, to abolish it or lose their observer status. In addition to banning capital punishment for EU member states, the EU has also banned detainee transfers in cases where the receiving party may seek the death penalty.

[[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n countries that have recently abolished the death penalty include [[Burundi]], which abolished the death penalty for all crimes in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/news/burundi-abolishes-death-penalty-bans-homosexuality-20090427 |title=Burundi abolishes the death penalty but bans homosexuality &amp;#124; Amnesty International |publisher=Amnesty.org |accessdate=11 February 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140218040338/http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/news/burundi-abolishes-death-penalty-bans-homosexuality-20090427 |archivedate=18 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gabon]] which did the same in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.handsoffcain.info/archivio_news/index.php?iddocumento=15302086&amp;mover=0 |title=Death Penalty: Hands Off Cain Announces Abolition In Gabon |publisher=Handsoffcain.info |accessdate=11 February 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225204443/http://www.handsoffcain.info/archivio_news/index.php?iddocumento=15302086&amp;mover=0 |archivedate=25 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 July 2012, [[Benin]] became part of the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which prohibits the use of the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.handsoffcain.info/bancadati/schedastato.php?idstato=17000190 |title=HANDS OFF CAIN against death penalty in the world |publisher=Handsoffcain.info |accessdate=11 February 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225204334/http://www.handsoffcain.info/bancadati/schedastato.php?idstato=17000190 |archivedate=25 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newly created [[South Sudan]] is among the 111 UN member states that supported the resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly that called for the removal of the death penalty, therefore affirming its opposition to the practice. South Sudan, however, has not yet abolished the death penalty and stated that it must first amend its Constitution, and until that happens it will continue to use the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article46452 |title=South Sudan says death penalty remains until constitution amended – Sudan Tribune: Plural news and views on Sudan |publisher=Sudan Tribune |accessdate=11 February 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228053742/http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article46452 |archivedate=28 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Amnesty International and [[Human Rights Watch]] are noted for their opposition to capital punishment. A number of such NGOs, as well as trade unions, local councils and bar associations formed a [[World Coalition Against the Death Penalty]] in 2002.

==Religious views==
{{Main|Religion and capital punishment}}
The world's major faiths have differing views depending on the religion, denomination, [[sect]] and/or the individual adherent. As an example, the majority of [[Christendom]] opposes the death penalty&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://incommunion.org/2008/02/24/orthodoxy-and-capital-punishment/|title=Orthodoxy and Capital Punishment|date=24 February 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the world's largest Christian denomination - Catholicism - opposes capital punishment in all cases, whereas both the Baha'i and Islamic faiths support capital punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KA/ka-103.html|title=Bahá'í Reference Library - The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Pages 203-204|website=reference.bahai.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Siting the Death Penalty Internationally|first1=David F.|last1=Greenberg|first2=Valerie|last2=West|date=2 May 2008|journal=Law &amp; Social Inquiry|volume=33|issue=2|pages=295–343|doi=10.1111/j.1747-4469.2008.00105.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Unitedstatesreports.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The ''[[United States Reports]]'' is the official reporter of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].]]

'''Case citation''' is a system used by legal professionals to identify past [[court case]] decisions, either in series of books called [[Reporter (law)|reporters]] or [[law report]]s, or in a neutral style that identifies a decision regardless of where it is reported. Case citations are formatted differently in different [[jurisdiction]]s, but generally contain the same key information.

A '''legal citation''' is a "reference to a legal precedent or authority, such as a case, statute, or treatise, that either substantiates or contradicts a given position."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Black's Law Dictionary|year=2012|publisher=West|location=St. Paul, Minnesota|isbn=978-0-314-26578-4|edition=9th Abridged|editor-first=Bryan A.|editor-last=Garner|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where cases are published on paper, the citation usually contains the following information:
* Court that issued the decision
* Report title
* Volume number
* Page, section, or paragraph number
* Publication year

In some report series, for example in England, Australia and some in Canada, volumes are not numbered independently of the year: thus the year and volume number (usually no greater than 4) are required to identify which book of the series has the case reported within its covers. In such citations, it is usual in these jurisdictions to apply square [[bracket]]s "{{bracket|year}}" to the year (which may not be the year that the case was decided: for example, a case decided in December 2001 may have been reported in 2002).

The Internet brought with it the opportunity for courts to publish their decisions on websites and most published court decisions now appear in that way.  They can be found through many national and other websites, such as [[WorldLII]], that are operated by members of the [[Free Access to Law Movement]].

The resulting flood of unpaginated information has led to numbering of paragraphs and the adoption of a medium-neutral citation system.  This usually contains the following information:
* Year of decision
* Abbreviated title of the court
* Decision number (not the court file number)
Rather than utilizing page numbers for pinpoint references, which would depend upon particular printers and [[Web browser|browser]]s, pinpoint quotations refer to paragraph numbers.

The conjunction "versus" is abbreviated to "v" in Commonwealth countries and to "v." in the United States.

==Pronunciation of case titles==

In [[common law]] countries with an [[adversarial system]] of justice, the names of the opposing parties are separated in the case title by the abbreviation ''v''{{mdash}}usually written as ''v'' in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries and always as ''v.'' in the US. The abbreviation represents the Latin word ''versus'', which means ''against''. When case titles are read out loud, the ''v'' can be pronounced, depending on the context, as ''and'', ''against'', ''versus'', or ''vee''.&lt;ref name="soas_uk_civil"&gt;{{cite web|website=SOAS Library: Research Guides|title=Understanding UK Case Law|url=http://www.soas.ac.uk/library/subjects/law/research/file70250.pdf|author=School of Oriental and African Studies Library, University of London|pages=5–6|date=August 2012|quote=The small letter “v” is an abbreviation of versus. However, the term “and” is used to pronounce it, rather than “v” or “versus”, e.g. the case “Smith v Jones” would be pronounced “Smith and Jones”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commonwealth pronunciation===

Commonwealth countries follow British legal style:

* [[Civil law (common law)|Civil cases]] are pronounced with ''and''.  For example, ''Smith v Jones'' would be pronounced "Smith {{em|and}} Jones".&lt;ref name="soas_uk_civil"/&gt;
* [[Criminal law|Criminal cases]] are pronounced with ''against''.  For example, ''R v Smith'' would be pronounced "the Crown {{em|against}} Smith".&lt;ref name="soas_uk_criminal"&gt;{{cite web|website=SOAS Library: Research Guides|title=Understanding UK Case Law|url=http://www.soas.ac.uk/library/subjects/law/research/file70250.pdf|author=School of Oriental and African Studies Library, University of London|page=5|date=August 2012|quote=A case can be pronounced in a number of ways, e.g. “R v Smith” would be pronounced either “the Crown against Smith”, or it can be referred to as simply “Smith” }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin words ''Rex'', ''Regina'', and ''versus'' are all rendered into English.
* ''Versus'' and ''vee'' are incorrect.&lt;ref name="soas_uk_civil"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Melbourne University Law Review Association|title=Australian Guide to Legal Citation|date=2010|isbn=9780646527390|page=43|edition=3rd|url=http://law.unimelb.edu.au/mulr/aglc|quote=In speech, the 'v' between the parties' names is rendered 'and' in a civil action and 'against' in a criminal action both in Australia and the United Kingdom. It is not pronounced 'versus' as it is in the United States of America.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===American pronunciation===

In the United States, there is no consensus on the pronunciation of the abbreviation ''v.''  This has led to much confusion about the pronunciation and spelling of court cases:&lt;ref name="nyt1989"&gt;{{cite news|title=On Language: Child's Garden of Vs.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/04/magazine/on-language-child-s-garden-of-vs.html|agency=The New York Times|date=June 4, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Versus'' is most commonly used,&lt;ref name="nyt1989"/&gt; leading some newspapers to use the common abbreviation ''vs.'' in place of the legal abbreviation ''v.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kuttner|first1=Robert|title=How the Airlines Became Abusive Cartels|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/17/opinion/how-the-airlines-became-abusive-cartels.html|work=The New York Times|date=17 April 2017|quote=Today’s auction system on oversold flights, ironically, is the stepchild of a 1976 Supreme Court case, Nader vs. Allegheny, in which the late and little lamented Allegheny Airlines (known to its long suffering passengers as Agony Airlines) picked the wrong passenger to bump.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Vee'' is also heard but is not as common.&lt;ref name="nyt1989"/&gt;
* ''Against'' is a matter of personal style.&lt;ref name="nyt1989"/&gt;  For example, [[Warren E. Burger]] and [[John Paul Stevens]] preferred to announce cases at the Supreme Court with ''against''.&lt;ref name=oyez_betamax&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/1982/81-1687|title=''Sony Corporation of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.''|quote=Warren E. Burger: Before we hear the arguments in Sony Corporation against Universal City Studios ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oyez_smith&gt;{{cite web|title=''Smith v. Massachusetts''|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/2004/03-8661|website=Oyez|quote=John Paul Stevens: We'll hear argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''And'' is used by some law professors, but other law professors regard it as an affectation.&lt;ref name="nyt1989"/&gt;

During [[Oral argument in the United States|oral arguments]] in ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' (1992), the participants demonstrated the lack of consensus by using different pronunciations of ''v.'' Solicitor General [[Ken Starr]] even managed to use all three of the most common American pronunciations interchangeably:&lt;ref name=oyez_casey&gt;{{cite web|title=''Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey''|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/1991/91-744|website=Oyez|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=[[Ken Starr|Kenneth W. Starr]]: This is the process of analysis that is quite familiar to the Court, very lengthily laid out by Justice Harlan in his dissent in Poe ''versus'' Ullman, and then adumbrated in his concurring opinion in Griswold ''against'' Connecticut. ... Well, I think that that is the necessary consequence of Roe ''vee'' Wade.}}

==Australia==
Legal citation in Australia generally mirrors the methods of citation used in [[England]]. A widely used guide to Australian legal citation is the ''[[Australian Guide to Legal Citation]]'' (commonly known as AGLC), published jointly by the ''[[Melbourne University Law Review]]'' and the ''[[Melbourne Journal of International Law]]''.

The standard case citation format in Australia is:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! ''Style of cause''
! (year of decision)
! [year of report]
! volume
! report
! (series)
! page
|- valign="top"
| ''[[Mabo v Queensland (No 2)]]''
| (1992)
|
| 175
| CLR
|
| 1.
|}

As in Canada, there has been divergence among citation styles. There exist commercial citation guides published by Butterworths and other legal publishing companies, academic citation styles and court citation styles. Each court in Australia may cite the same case slightly differently. There is presently a movement in convergence to the comprehensive academic citation style of the [[Australian Guide to Legal Citation]] published jointly by the ''[[Melbourne University Law Review]]'' and the ''[[Melbourne Journal of International Law]]''.

===Neutral citation===
Australian courts and tribunals have now adopted a neutral citation standard for case law. The format provides a naming system that does not depend on the publication of the case in a law report.  Most cases are now published on AustLII using neutral citations.&lt;ref name="austlii"&gt;[http://austlii.edu.au Austlii.edu.au]&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard format looks like this:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Year of decision
!Court identifier
!Ordinal number
|- valign="top"
|[2005]
|HCA
|1
|}
So the above-mentioned ''Mabo'' case would then be cited like this: ''Mabo v Queensland (No 2)'' [1992] HCA 23.

There is a unique court identifier code for most courts.  The court and tribunal identifiers include:
{| class="wikitable"

==Canada==
There are a number of citation standards in Canada. Many legal publishing companies and schools have their own standard for citation. Since the late 1990s, however, much of the legal community has converged to a single standard—formulated in ''[[The Canadian Guide to Uniform Legal Citation]]'', commonly known as the "[[McGill Guide]]" after the ''[[McGill Law Journal]]'', which first published it. The following format reflects this standard:

:''[[Hunter v. Southam|Hunter v Southam]]'', [1984] 2 SCR 145.

Broken into its component parts, the format is:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! ''Style of cause''
! (year of decision),
! [year of report]
! volume
! report
! (series)
! page
! jurisdiction/court
|- valign="top"
| ''[[R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd.|R v Big M Drug Mart Ltd]]'',
|
| [1985]
| 1
| SCR
|
| 295.
|
|- valign="top"
| ''[[R. v. Oakes|R v Oakes]]'',
|
| [1986]
| 1
| SCR
|
| 103.
|
|- valign="top"
| ''Re Canada Trust Co and OHRC''
| (1990),
|
|69
|DLR
|(4th)
|321
|(Ont CA).
|}

The ''Style of Cause'' is italicized as in all other countries and the party names are separated by ''v'' (English) or ''c'' (French). Prior to 1984 the appellant party would always be named first. However, since then case names do not switch order when the case is appealed.

Undisclosed parties to a case are represented by initials (e.g., ''[[R. v. R.D.S|R v RDS]]''). Criminal cases are prosecuted by the Crown, which is always represented by ''R'' for ''Regina'' (queen) or ''Rex'' (king). [[reference question|Constitutional references]] are always entitled "''Reference re''" followed by the subject title.

If the year of decision is the same as the year of the report, and the date is a part of the reporter's citation, then the date need not be listed after the ''style of cause''. If the date of the decision is different from the year of the report, then both should be shown.

Where available, cases should be cited with their neutral citation immediately after the ''style of cause'' and preceding the print citation. For example,

:''[[Chaoulli v. Quebec (Attorney General)|Chaoulli v Quebec (Attorney General)]]'', 2005 SCC 35, [2005] 1 SCR 791.

This format was adopted as the standard in 2006, in the sixth edition of the McGill Guide. Prior to this format, the opposite order of parallel citation was used.

The seventh edition of the McGill Guide, published 2010-08-20, removes most full stop/period (".") characters from the citations, e.g., a citation to the Supreme Court Reports that previously would have been [2005] 1 S.C.R. 791, is now [2005] 1 SCR 791. Most full stops are also removed from styles of cause. The seventh edition also further highlights the significance of neutral citations (i.e., tribunal-assigned citations that are publisher-independent)

===Neutral citation===
In 1999 the [[Canadian Judicial Council]] adopted a neutral citation standard for case law. The format provides a naming system that does not depend on the publication of the case in a law report.

The standard format look like this:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Year of decision
!Court identifier
!Ordinal number
|- valign="top"
|2000
|SCC
|1
|}

There is a unique court identifier code for most courts. A list of the court identifiers include:

* Canadian Citation Committee [http://www.lexum.com/ccc-ccr/neutr/neutr.jur_en.html A Neutral Citation Standard for Case Law]

== Denmark ==
There is no official standard for case citations in Denmark, and the citation format also varies depending on how the reporter in question indexes their judgments (i.e. by page number or giving each case an identifier). However, citations usually include the same components:
* The name or abbreviation of the reporter.
* The year of the reporter.
* The page number or identifier of the case.
* The name or abbreviation of the court who heard the case.
As an example, a case from the [[Supreme Court (Denmark)|Supreme Court]] (Højesteret) published in the [[Ugeskrift for Retsvæsen]], the main reporter of decisions, in the year 2001 on page 2327 could be cited in various different ways, as exemplified by this non-exhaustive list:
* UfR 2001.2327 H
* U 2001.2327 HD
* U 2001 p. 2327
* Ugeskrift for Retsvæsen 2001 p. 2327
The above example is from a reporter that cites cases by page number. Another reporter, Tidsskrift for Skatter og Afgifter, gives each case a number instead. The above case was given the identifier 719 and would be cited using 719 instead of a page number (e.g. TfS 2001/179 H or TfS 2001/179 HD, among others).{{Efn-ur|group=Denmark|name=Examples|Note how Ugeskrift for Retsvæsen can be cited both as "UfR" or simply "U". Additionally, p. (page) would be written as s. (side) in Danish. This particular example is, in part, from {{Harvnb|Madsen|2018|p=11}}}}

Cases that have not been published in a reporter should be cited using the name of the court, the date of the decision and the court's own case number. For example:
* Højesterets dom af 17. februar 2010 fra Højesteret, sag 269/2009 ([[English language|English]]: The Supreme Court's judgment of the 17th of February 2010, case 269/2009)
As with reporter citations, the composition and wording of the citation can vary, the key is to include enough information for the reader to be able to acquire it.{{Efn-ur|{{Harvnb|Madsen|2018|pp=11-12}}}}

==Germany==
{{main|German legal citation}}
In Germany there are two types of citation: the full citation of a case and its shortened form. In e.g. scientific articles, the full citation of a particular case is only used at its first occurrence; after that, its shortened form is used. In most law journals, the articles themselves only use the shortened form; the full citations for all articles sometimes are summarized at the beginning of that journals edition.

A third type (yet not too widely spread) is the citation by using the [[European Case Law Identifier]], a ″neutral″ citation system introduced by the [[Council of the European Union]] in 2011, which Germany is participating in.

===Federal Constitutional Court of Germany===
The most important cases of the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] are published by the court in its official collection. This collection is abbreviated ''BVerfGE'', whereas ''BVerfG'' is short for ''Bundesverfassungsgericht'', the German court name, and ''E'' stands for ''Entscheidung'' (decision).

Starting in 2004, the court also publishes the BVerfGK collection, containing decisions made only by a ''Kammer'', a specific part of the court.

The so-called [[:de:Volkszählungsurteil|Volkszählungsurteil]] for example could be cited
:BVerfGE 65, 1 (43), Urteil des Ersten Senats vom 15. Dezember 1983 auf die mündliche Verhandlung vom 18. und 19. Oktober 1983, Az. 1 BvR 209, 269, 362, 420, 440, 484/83.
in full and
:BVerfGE 65, 1 (43).
in short.

{| class="wikitable"

| (43),
| Urteil des Ersten Senats&lt;br /&gt;vom 15. Dezember 1983&lt;br /&gt;[in case of a hearing:] auf die mündliche Verhandlung vom 18. und 19. Oktober 1983,
| Az. 1 BvR 209, 269, 362, 420, 440, 484/83
|}

For the meaning of the different case numbers of the BVerfG see [[:de:Aktenzeichen#Verwendete Aktenzeichen des Bundesverfassungsgerichts|the German article]].

If decisions are not yet published by the court, or will not be published at all, law journals can be cited, e.g.,
:BVerfG, NJW 2009, 1234 (1235 f.).
Where ''NJW'' stands for the law journal [[:de:Neue Juristische Wochenschrift|Neue Juristische Wochenschrift]], 2009 is the year, 1234 the page of the beginning and 1235 the cited page(s) – "f." stands for "seq.". In general, citations of the official collections are preferred.

===Federal Court of Justice of Germany===
The [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany]] (Bundesgerichtshof, short BGH) publishes the official collections ''[[:de:BGHSt|BGHSt]]'' for decisions in [[penal law]] and ''[[:de:BGHZ|BGHZ]]'' for those in [[private law]].

The [[:de:Katzenkönigfall|Katzenkönigfall]] e.g. would be cited
:BGHSt 35, 347 ff., Urteil des 4. Strafsenats vom 15. September 1988, Az. 4 StR 352/88.
in full and
:BGHSt 35, 347 ff.
in short (in this example, not a specific page but the case as such is cited; "ff." means "sqq.").

===Other federal courts===
The official collection of the [[Bundessozialgericht|Federal Social Court of Germany]] (Bundessozialgericht, BSG) is abbreviated ''BSGE''.

The official collection of the [[Federal Finance Court of Germany]] (Bundesfinanzhof, BFH) is ''BFHE''.

The official collection of the [[Federal Labor Court of Germany]] (Bundesarbeitsgericht, BAG) is ''BAGE''.

The official collection of the [[Federal Administrative Court of Germany]] (Bundesverwaltungsgericht, BVerwG) is ''BVerwGE''.

===Other courts===
For other courts, generally the same rules apply, though most do not publish an official collection, so they must be cited from a law journal.

===European Case Law Identifier===
According to the [[European Case Law Identifier|ECLI]] system the ''Volkszählungsurteil'' would be cited as 
:ECLI:DE:BVerfG:1983:rs19831215.1bvr020983
and the ''Katzenkönigfall'' as 
:ECLI:DE:BGH:1988:150988U4STR352.88.0

==India==
India's vast federated judicial system admits to a large number of reporters, each with their own style of citation. There are over 200 law reports in India – subject-wise and state (province)-wise, authorized and unauthorized.

===Supreme Court of India===
The  official reporter for Supreme Court decisions is the Supreme Court Reports. These reports however lag behind other journals in the speed of reporting. While decisions themselves are uploaded by the Supreme Court itself on ''www.courtnic.nic.in'', the edited versions with headnotes in the official reporter take years to compile. However, some reporters have been authorised to publish the Court's decisions. The ''All India Reporter'' (AIR) is an old and respected reporter that, in addition to the Supreme Court, also reports decisions of the various State High Courts. Other popular reporters include ''Supreme Court Cases'', which has become the most cited report in the Supreme Court, the ''Supreme Court Almanac'', and ''Judgements Today''.

[[File:All India Reporter.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''All India Reporter'']]

''[[Sebastian Hongray v. Union of India]]'':
* AIR 1984 SC 571 – "AIR" refers to the ''All India Reporter'', "1984" is the year of judgement (AIR does not use a volume-based classification), "SC" refers to the Supreme Court of India, and "571" is the first page number of the report within the volume;
* (1984) 1 SCC 339 – "1984" is the year of publication, "1" is the volume number of the reporter, "SCC" stands for ''Supreme Court Cases'' (the name of the reporter), and "339" is the first page number of the report within the volume; and
* 1984 Cri LJ 289 (SC) – "1984" is the year of publication, "Cri LJ" is an abbreviation for the ''Criminal Law Journal'' (the name of the reporter), and "289" is the first page number of the report within the volume. The "SC" in parentheses indicates that the case was heard by the Supreme Court.

A citation of the "Supreme Court Almanac":
* ''[[Additional Secretary, Government of India v. Alka Subhash Gadia]]'' (1990) 2 Scale 1352

A citation in "Judgements Today":
* ''[[Premium Granites v. State of Tamil Nadu]]'' JT (1994) 1 SC 374

The "Supreme Court Cases (SCC)" published supplementary reports for a few years in the early 1990s. Those citations looked like this:
* ''[[Federation of Mining Associations v. State of Rajasthan]]'' 1992 Supp (2) SCC 239, which points to page 239 of the Second Supplementary Volume of the SCC reports in the year 1992. From 1996 the Supplementary Volumes were numbered in sequence after the regular volumes.

The SCC also have a separate series of subject-based reporting of the decisions of the Supreme Court:
* ''[[Rathinam Nagbhushan Patnaik v. Union of India]]'' 1994 SCC (Cri) 740, which refers to the SCC Criminal Reports
* ''[[Delhi Transport Corporation v. Mazdoor Congress]]'' 1991 SCC (L&amp;S) 1213, which refers to the SCC Labour &amp; Services Reports

===High Courts===
The ''All India Reporter'' (AIR) is the most popular nationwide reporter for decisions of the High Courts. An AIR High Court citation looks like: ''[[Surjya Kumar Das v. Maya Dutta]]'' AIR 1982 Cal 222, where "Cal" refers to the [[Calcutta High Court]] in [[Kolkata]]. This is a uniform style for AIR High Court reports. Only the shortened indicator of the forum changes for different High Courts. ''The Calcutta Weekly Notes'' is the oldest continuously published [[law journal]] in India having uninterrupted publication since 1896 reporting reportable decisions of the High Court at Calcutta. Reports are cited in the style 105 CWN 345 where 105 refers to the volume number calculated at one volume per year from the initial volume, which had been published in 1896. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===National Judicial Reference System ([[NJRS]])===

National Judicial Reference System ([[NJRS]]) is a project started by the Income-tax Department, Government of India. It has been envisaged as a tool to achieve efficiency in the tax litigation process of Income Tax Department (ITD). Within this project the Judicial Research &amp; Reference System (JRRS) – JRRS is a repository of judicial orders as a single, indexed, searchable, cross-linked, database of Judgments / orders of ITAT, Authority of Advance Ruling (AAR), HC and SC.

The Citation nomenclature followed within [[NJRS]] :
* ''[[Chandra Ranganathan &amp; Ors. v. Commissioner of Income-tax]]'' 2009-LL-1021, which refers to [[NJRS]] citations.

This Citation further allows to add the Authority where the judgment / order was pronounced.
* ''[[Chandra Ranganathan &amp; Ors. v. Commissioner of Income-tax]]'' 2009-LL-1021-SC, which refers to [[NJRS]] citations.

==New Zealand==
The standard case citation format in New Zealand is:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! ''Style of cause''
! (year of decision)
! [year of reporter]
! volume
! reporter
! page
|- valign="top"
| ''Taylor v New Zealand Poultry Board''

| NZLR
| 394
|- valign="top"
|  ''R v Howse''
| (2005)
|
| 21
| CRNZ
| 823
|}

Several leading law reviews in New Zealand have also adopted the ''[[Australian Guide to Legal Citation]]'' (AGLC) such as the ''[[University of Canterbury|Canterbury]] Law Review''. The AGLC style is also rather similar to citation style in New Zealand.

===Reporters===

|1981–
|}

Additionally, a number of other report series exist for specialist areas such as Family, Employment and Tax Law. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===Neutral citation===
New Zealand courts and tribunals have begun to adopt a neutral citation standard for case law. The format provides a naming system that does not depend on the publication of the case in a law report.

The standard format looks like this:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Year of decision
!Court identifier
!Ordinal number
|- valign="top"
|[2005]
|NZSC
|1
|}

There is a unique court identifier for each court or tribunal.  These identifiers are:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Court Identifier
!Court
!Years
|- valign="top"
|NZSC
|[[Supreme Court of New Zealand]]
| 2005–
|- valign="top"
|NZCA

| NZEnvC
|[[Environment Court of New Zealand]]
| 2010–
|- valign="top"
| NZFC
|[[Family Court of New Zealand]]
| 2012–
|}

Where both a neutral citation and a reporter citation exist, the neutral citation should come first e.g. ''R v AM'' [2010] NZCA 114, [2010] 2 NZLR 750

==Norway==
The Norwegian standard case citation format for published court decisions is:

:Rt. 1952 s. 989 ''(Telefonsjikanedommen)''

where:

* '''Rt.''' identifies the report series.
** All [[Supreme Court of Norway|supreme court judgments]] are published in Retstidende (Court Times), abbreviated Rt.
** Many judgments and decisions from lower courts are published in Rettens gang (RG).
* '''1952''' is the year of reporter
* '''s.''' is the Norwegian abbreviation for page. This is optional.
* '''989''' is the first page number of the decision in the reporter.
* Finally, one can add the popular name of the decision. It is unusual to refer to name of the plaintiff(s) and defendant(s), but often there is an unofficial name. ''Telefonsjikanedommen'' refers to a 1952 case where the Supreme Court ruled that telephone harassment ("telefonsjikane") was not illegal under the current criminal code.

==The Philippines==
Despite the long-standing [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] tradition in the Philippines, reliance on judicial precedents has become indispensable since the period of American rule. [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] decisions are expressly recognized as part of the internal law, and are thus frequently cited in court decisions and legal pleadings. Though there is only one Supreme Court in the Philippines, the citation of its decisions varies, depending on which report of a case is relied on by the person citing that case. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===Official reporter===
The ''Philippine Reports'' is the official reporter of decisions of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]]. The standard format for citation of the ''Philippine Reports'' is:

:''People v. Flores'', 442 Phil. 561 (2002)

where:

* ''People v. Flores'' is the name of the case
* ''442'' is the volume number of the ''Philippine Reports'' where the case may be found
* ''Phil.'' is the standard abbreviation of ''Philippine Reports''
* ''561'' is the page number in the ''Philippine Reports'' that contains the beginning of the decision. If this number is followed by a comma then another page number (i.e., ''442 Phil. 561, 563''), the latter number indicates the particular page where the annotated text can be found
* ''(2002)'' is the year the case was decided.

As of present, Philippine cases are contained in quarterly issues. The Supreme Court Reports Annotated or SCRA are cited as such:

Juarez v. Court of Appeals 214 SCRA 475

where 214 is the volume of the book, and 475 is the page number. There are already over 700 SCRAs in circulation.

===Unofficial reporter===
In the last few decades, the ''Philippine Reports'' has suffered from production problems, resulting in long delays in publication, as well as significant gaps within its published series. As a result, the privately published ''Supreme Court Reports Annotated'' (published by Central Professional Books, Inc.) has become more widely used than the ''Philippine Reports'', even by the courts. The proper format for citation of the ''Supreme Court Reports Annotated'' is:

:''Fortich v. Corona'', G.R. No. 131457, 24 April 1998, 289 SCRA 624

where:

* ''Fortich v. Corona'' is the name of the case
* ''G.R. No. 131457'' is the case docket number originally assigned by the Supreme Court at the time the action was filed with the Court (G.R. means ''General Register'')
* ''24 April 1998'' is the exact date the decision of this case was promulgated
* ''289'' is the volume number of the ''Supreme Court Reports Annotated'' where the case may be found
* ''SCRA'' is the standard abbreviation of ''Supreme Court Reports Annotated''
* ''624'' is the page number in the ''Supreme Court Reports Annotated'' that contains the beginning of the decision. If this number is followed by a comma then another page number (i.e., ''289 SCRA 624, 627''), the latter number indicates the particular page where the annotated text can be found

Owing to the delays in the regular publication of the Philippine Reports, reliance on the SCRA has been tolerated, although if a case may be found at the Philippine Reports, it is preferred that the official reporter be cited in lieu of the SCRA.

When citing cases not yet reported in the Philippine Reports or the SCRA, the above citation without reference to the SCRA is preferred (i.e., ''Fortich v. Corona'', G.R. No. 131457, 24 April 1988)

===Lower court decisions===
As there are no official or unofficial reporters that regularly publish decisions of the [[Philippine Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]] and other lower courts, citation of their decisions hews to the same format as cases not reported either in the Philippine Reports or the SCRA. Thus: ''(case name)'', ''(docket number)'', ''(Exact date of promulgation of decision)''.

==Switzerland==
Citations vary by court and by language. Cases of the [[Swiss Federal Supreme Court]] are cited as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Schweizerisches Bundesgericht - Zitierregeln|url=https://www.bger.ch/index/juridiction/jurisdiction-inherit-template/jurisdiction-zitierregeln.htm|website=Swiss Federal Supreme Court|accessdate=28 April 2018|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Officially published cases are cited as ''BGE 133 II 292 [E. 3.2 S. 296]'' (German: ''Bundesgerichtsentscheide'') or ''ATF 133 II 292 [consid. 3.2 p. 296]'' (French: ''arrêts du tribunal fédéral''). In this example, 133 is the annual issue of the court reports, II the part indicating the division of the Court, and 292 the page on which the decision begins. Optionally, "E. 3.2" and "S. 296" are the section and page specifically cited.

Supreme Court decisions not selected for official publication are cited as ''Urteil [des Bundesgerichts] 5C.260/2006 vom 30. März 2007'' or ''arrêt [du Tribunal fédéral] 5C.260/2006 du 30 mars 2007'' respectively. In this example, 5C is the division of the Court, 260 the case number and 2006 the year in which the case was opened.

The citation style for cases of the inferior [[federal courts of Switzerland]] is similar.

==United Kingdom==

===Neutral citation===
{{main|British and Irish Legal Information Institute#Case citations}}
Since 2001, judgments in the House of Lords, Privy Council, Court of Appeal and Administrative Court have been issued with neutral citations. This system was extended to other parts of the High Court in 2002. Judgments with neutral citations are freely available on the British and Irish Legal Information Institute website (www.bailii.org).
	
Neutral citations identify judgments independently of any series of reports, and cite only parties, year of judgment, court and case number. For example, &lt;br /&gt;''Rottman v MPC'' [2002] UKHL 20 &lt;br/&gt;identifies the 20th judgment in 2002 in the UK House of Lords. UKHL stands for UK House of Lords. EWHC and EWCA identify the England and Wales High Court and Court of Appeal respectively. These abbreviations are generally followed by an abbreviation indicating the court or division (e.g. Admin, Ch, Crim, Pat).

===How to cite a case===
{{see also|Oxford Standard for Citation of Legal Authorities}}
If a neutral citation is available for a judgment, it should immediately follow the party names. If the judgment has also been reported in a law reports series, follow the neutral citation with the ''best report'', which is usually from the official Law Reports series (Appeals Cases – AC, Chancery – Ch, Family – Fam, Queen's Bench – QB etc.).

The case of ''Rottman v MPC'' was reported in the Appeals Cases, so the citation should be:
*''Rottman v MPC'' [2002] UKHL 20, [2002] 2 AC 692.

This means that a report of the case and the judgment can be found in the 2002 volumes, vol 2, of the Law Reports series called Appeals Cases, beginning at page 692.

To cite a particular paragraph from the judgment, add the paragraph number in square brackets at the end of the citation:
*''Rottman v MPC'' [2002] UKHL 20, [2002] 2 AC 692 [58].

If a case is not reported in the Law Reports, the next best report is the Weekly Law Reports (e.g. [2002] 2 WLR 1315), and then the All England Reports (e.g., [2002] 2 All ER 865). In some situations, it might be preferable to cite a specialist series, e.g., ''Rottman v MPC'' was also cited in the Human Rights Law Reports, at [2002] HRLR 32.

For cases before 2001, cite the best report. If referring to a particular page of the judgment, give that page number after the page number on which the report begins. The following citation refers to page 573 of the ''Donoghue v Stevenson'' judgment:

*''Donoghue v Stevenson'' [1932] AC 562, 573.
*See [http://denning.law.ox.ac.uk/published/oscola.shtml Oxford Standard for the Citation of Legal Authorities]

===England and Wales===
The standard case citation format in [[England and Wales]] is:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! ''Style of cause''
! (year of decision),
! [year of report]
! volume
! report
! (series)

In [[England and Wales]] as with certain Commonwealth countries, the abbreviation "R" for ''rex'' (king) or ''regina'' (queen), is used for cases in which the state is a party (typically criminal cases or [[judicial review]] cases).

[[Bracket#Square brackets .5B .5D|Square brackets]] "[ ]" are used when the year is essential to locating the report (e.g., the official law reports either—as with ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'', above—do not have volume numbers or, if there are multiple volumes in a single year, they are numbered 1, 2, etc.).  [[Bracket#Parentheses .28 .29|Round brackets]] "( )" are used when the year is not essential but is useful for information purposes, e.g., in reports that have a cumulative volume number such as ''[[R v Dudley and Stephens]]'', above.

===Law Reports===
The term "reporter", meaning a law report or a series of them, is not widely used in England and Wales. Before 1865, English courts used a large number of privately printed reports, and cases were cited based on which report they appeared in. (This system was also used in the United States and other common law jurisdictions during that period.)

Two main unofficial law reports report all areas of law: the ''Weekly Law Reports'' (WLR) and the ''All England Reports'' (All ER). In addition, a number of unofficial specialist law reports focus on particular areas, e.g., ''Entertainment and Media Law Reports'' (EMLR) or the ''Criminal Appeal Reports'' (Cr App R).

For the citation of "The Law Reports" of the Incorporated Council of Law Reporting, see [[Law Reports]]. These have been published since 1865. They have always been split into a number of different series, the current series being the Appeal Cases (AC), Chancery (Ch), Family (Fam), and Queen's Bench (QB) (or King's Bench—KB—depending on the monarch of the time). These four series are cited in preference to all others in court.

==United States==
The standard case citation format in the United States is:
:''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', 410 U.S. 113 (1973)
where:
*''Roe v. Wade'' is the abbreviated name of the case. Generally, the first name (here, ''Roe'') is the surname of the [[plaintiff]], who is the party who filed the suit for an original case, or the [[appellant]], the party appealing in a case being appealed from a lower court, or the [[petitioner]] when litigating in the [[Supreme court|high court]] of a jurisdiction; and the second name (here, ''Wade'') is the surname of the [[defendant]], the party responding to the suit, or the [[appellee]], the party responding to the appeal, or the [[respondent]], when defending in the high court of the jurisdiction. Litigants are generally referred to by their last name (when they are natural persons), and a case is generally referred to by the first named litigant on each side of the case. In this example, ''Roe'' refers to "[[Jane Roe]]," a pseudonym commonly used when it is appropriate to keep the identity of a litigant out of the public spotlight, and ''Wade'' refers to [[Henry Wade]], the [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County]] District Attorney at the time.
*410 is the volume number of the "[[Reporter (law)|reporter]]" that reported the Court's written opinion in the case titled ''Roe v. Wade''.
*U.S. is the abbreviation of the reporter, or printed book of court opinions. Here, "U.S." stands for ''[[United States Reports]]''.
*113 is the page number (in volume 410 of ''United States Reports'') where the opinion begins.
*1973 is the year when the court rendered its decision.
*The abbreviated name of the court is included inside the parenthesis before the year if the name of the court is not obvious from the reporter. This rule comes into play because certain reporters, such as members of the West [[National Reporter System]], publish opinions originating from multiple courts.  In this example, the name of the court (United States Supreme Court) is obvious (since only decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court are published in ''United States Reports'') and is thus omitted as a matter of convention.

Case citations are used to find a particular case, both when looking up a case in a printed reporter and when accessing it via the Internet or services such as LexisNexis or Westlaw.

This format also allows different cases with the same parties to be easily differentiated. For example, looking for the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case of ''[[Miller v. California]]'' would yield four cases, some involving different people named Miller, and each involving different issues.

===Supreme Court of the United States===
Cases from the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] are officially printed in the ''[[United States Reports]]''. A citation to the ''United States Reports'' looks like this:

*''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', 347 U.S. 483 (1954).
*''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'', 384 U.S. 436 (1966).

Many court decisions are published in more than one reporter. A citation to two or more reporters for a given court decision is called a "parallel citation". For U.S. Supreme Court decisions, there are several unofficial reporters, including the [[National Reporter System|''Supreme Court Reporter'']] (abbreviated S.&amp;nbsp;Ct.) and ''United States Supreme Court Reports, Lawyers' Edition'' (commonly known simply as ''Lawyers' Edition'') (abbreviated L.&amp;nbsp;Ed.), which are printed by private companies and provide further annotations to the opinions of the Court. Although a citation to the latter two is not required, some attorneys and legal writers prefer to cite all three case reporters at once:

*''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'', 381 U.S. 479, 85 S. Ct. 1678, 14 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1965)

The "2d" after the L.&amp;nbsp;Ed. signifies the second series of the ''Lawyers' Edition''. United States case reporters are sequentially numbered, but the volume number is never higher than 999. When the 1,000th volume is reached (the threshold in earlier years was lower), the volume number is reset to 1 and a "2d" is appended after the reporter's abbreviation. Some case reporters are in their third series, and a few are approaching their fourth.

Some very old Supreme Court cases have odd-looking citations, such as ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 (1803). The "(1 Cranch)" refers to the fact that, before there was a reporter series known as the ''United States Reports'' compiled by the Supreme Court's [[Supreme Court of the United States Reporter of Decisions|Reporter of Decisions]], cases were gathered, bound together, and sold privately by the Court's Reporter of Decisions. In this example, ''Marbury'' was first reported in an edition by [[William Cranch]], who was responsible for publishing Supreme Court reports from 1801 to 1815. Such reports, named for the individual who gathered them and hence called "[[nominative reports]]", existed from 1790 to 1874. Beginning in 1874, the U.S. government created the ''United States Reports'', and at the same time simultaneously numbered the volumes previously published privately as part of a single series and began numbering sequentially from that point. In this way, "5 U.S. (1&amp;nbsp;Cranch)" means that it is the 5th overall volume of the ''United States Reports'' series, but the first that was originally published by [[William Cranch]]; four volumes of opinions prior to that were (for example) published by [[Alexander J. Dallas (statesman)|Alexander Dallas]] (for example, "4 U.S. (4 Dall.)"), and after Cranch's 9 volumes, 12 more were published by [[Henry Wheaton]] (e.g., "15 U.S. (2&amp;nbsp;Wheat.)"). See the [[Supreme Court of the United States Reporter of Decisions]] for other edition names. The name of the reporter of decisions has not been used in citations since the U.S. government began printing the ''United States Reports''.

When a case has been decided, but not yet published in the case reporter, the citation may note the volume but leave blank the page of the case reporter until it is determined. For example, ''[[Golan v. Holder]]'', {{nowrap|565 U.S. ___ (2012)}}.

In the caption of a Supreme Court case, the first name listed is the name of the petitioning (appealing) party, followed by the party responding (respondent) to the appeal.  In most cases, the appealing party was the losing party in the prior court.  This is no longer the practice used in cases in the federal courts of appeal, in which the original alignment of parties from the lower court is preserved.

===Lower federal courts===
[[File:US Court of Appeals and District Court map.svg|thumb|400px|right|Map of the geographic boundaries of the various United States Courts of Appeals and United States District Courts]]
[[United States court of appeals]] cases are published in the ''[[Federal Reporter]]'' (F., F.2d, or F.3d). [[United States district court]] cases and cases from some specialized courts are published in the ''[[Federal Supplement]]'' (F. Supp., F. Supp. 2d, or F. Supp. 3d). Both series are published by [[Thomson West]]; they are technically unofficial reporters, but have become widely accepted as the ''de facto'' "official" reporters of the lower federal courts because of the absence of a true official reporter. (Of the federal appeals and district courts, only one, the [[D.C. Circuit]], has an official reporter, ''United States Court of Appeals Reports'', and even that one is rarely used today.)&lt;ref&gt;D.C. Circuit Rule 32.1 provides: "Citations to decisions of this court must be to the Federal Reporter. Dual or parallel citation of cases is not required."&lt;/ref&gt;

When lower federal court opinions are cited, the citation includes the name of the court. This is placed in the parentheses immediately before the year. Some examples:

*''[[Geary v. Visitation of Blessed Virgin Mary School]]'', 7 F.3d 324 (3d Cir. 1993) – a 1993 case in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]]
*''[[Glassroth v. Moore]]'', 229 F. Supp. 2d 1290 (M.D. Ala. 2002) – a 2002 case in the [[U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama]]

U.S. circuit and district court cases from 1789 to 1880 were reported in [[Federal Cases]], abbreviated F. Cas. An example of the citation form is: ''[[Wheaton v. Peters]]'', 29 F. Cas. 862 (C.C.E.D. Pa. 1832) (No. 17,486).

===State courts===
State court decisions are published in several places. Many states have their own official state reporters, which publish decisions of one or more of that state's courts. Reporters that publish decisions of a state's highest court are abbreviated the same as the state's name (note: this is the traditional abbreviation, not the postal abbreviation), regardless of what the actual title of the reporter is.  Thus, the official reporter of decisions of the [[California Supreme Court]] (titled ''California Reports'') is abbreviated "Cal." (or, for subsequent series, "Cal. 2d," "Cal. 3d", or "Cal. 4th").

*''[[Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad Co.]]'', 248 N.Y. 339 (1928), a case in the [[New York Court of Appeals]], reported in ''New York Reports''. Note that the New York Court of Appeals is the highest court in New York. Because the ''New York Reports'' only report opinions of the New York Court of Appeals, there is no need to repeat the court designation before the year.
*''Green v. [[Chicago Tribune]] Company'', 286 Ill. App. 3d 1 (1996) – a case in the [[Illinois Appellate Court]], reported in ''Illinois Appellate Court Reports''. Note that, in contrast to New York, the Illinois Appellate Court is only the [[List of state intermediate appellate courts|intermediate court of appeals]] in Illinois; decisions of the [[Illinois Supreme Court]] are reported in ''Illinois Reports'', abbreviated "Ill." (or "Ill. 2d"). Because the ''Illinois Appellate Court Reports'' are dedicated solely to reporting decisions of the Illinois Appellate Court, there is no need to repeat the court designation before the year.
*''Harte v. Hand'', 438 N.J. Super. 545 (Ch. Div. 2014). Note that although all published opinions of the [[New Jersey Superior Court]] are published in the ''New Jersey Superior Court Reports'', the organization of the Superior Court into three divisions (the Law Division, the Chancery Division, and the [[New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division|Appellate Division]]) means the citation must specify which division issued the opinion. This is especially salient as the Appellate Division hears appeals from the Law and Chancery Divisions, as occurred with the example case (a rehearing on remand of ''Harte v. Hand'', 433 N.J. Super. 457 (App. Div. 2013)).

[[File:National Reporter System regions.png|thumb|400px|right|The [[Thomson West]] National Reporter System regions.]]
In addition to the official reporters, [[Thomson West]] publishes several series of "regional reporters" that cover several states each. These are the ''[[North Eastern Reporter]]'', ''[[Atlantic Reporter]]'', ''[[South Eastern Reporter]]'', ''[[Southern Reporter]]'', ''[[South Western Reporter]]'', ''[[North Western Reporter]]'', and ''[[Pacific Reporter]]''. [[California]], [[Illinois]], and [[New York (state)|New York]] also each have their own line of Thomson West reporters, because of the large volume of cases generated in those states (titled, respectively, ''West's California Reporter'', ''Illinois Decisions'', and ''West's New York Supplement'').  Some smaller states (like [[South Dakota]]) have stopped publishing their own official reporters, and instead have certified the appropriate West regional reporter as their "official" reporter.

Here are some examples of how to cite West reporters:

*''Jackson v. Commonwealth'', 583 S.E.2d 780 (Va. Ct. App. 2003) – a case in the [[Virginia Court of Appeals]] (an intermediate appellate court) published in the ''South Eastern Reporter'''s 2nd series
*''Foxworth v. Maddox'', 137 So. 161 (Fla. 1931) – a case in the [[Florida Supreme Court]] published in the ''Southern Reporter''
*''People v. Brown'', 282 N.Y.S.2d 497 (N.Y. 1967) – a case in the [[New York Court of Appeals]] (New York's highest court) published in  ''West's New York Supplement'''s 2nd series. The case also appears in West's regional reporter: ''People v. Brown'', 229 N.E.2d 192 (N.Y. 1967). Note, in both forms, that "N.Y." is placed in the parenthetical, because both ''West's New York Supplement'' and the ''North Eastern Reporter'' report the opinions of more courts than only the New York Court of Appeals. A citation to the officially published reports, ''People v. Brown'', 20 N.Y.2d 238 (1967), however, does not require the court name in the parenthetical, because the official ''New York Reports'' only report opinions of the New York Court of Appeals.

Abbreviations for lower courts vary by state, as each state has its own system of trial courts and intermediate appellate courts. When a case appears in both an official reporter and a regional reporter, either citation can be used. Generally, citing to the regional reporter is preferred, since out-of-state attorneys are more likely to have access to these. Many lawyers prefer to include both citations. Some state courts require that parallel citations (in this case, citing to both the official reporter and an unofficial regional reporter) be used when citing cases from any court in that state's system.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Like the United States Supreme Court, some very old state case citations include an abbreviation of the name of either the private publisher or the [[reporter of decisions]], a state-appointed officer who originally collected and published the cases. For example, in ''Hall v. Bell'', 47 Mass. (6 Met.) 431 (1843), the citation is to volume 47 of ''Massachusetts Reports'', which, like ''United States Reports'', was started in the latter half of the 19th century and incorporated into the series a number of prior editions originally published privately, and began numbering from that point; "6 Met." refers to the 6th volume that had originally been published privately by [[Theron Metcalf]]. An example of a case cited to a reporter that has not been subsequently incorporated into an officially published series is ''[[Pierson v. Post]]'', 3 Cai. 175 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1804), reported in volume 3 of ''Caines' Reports'', page 175, named for [[George Caines]], who had been appointed to report New York cases; the case was before the New York Supreme Court of Judicature (now defunct). Most states gave up this practice in the mid-to-late 19th century, but [[Delaware]] persisted until 1920.

Some states, notably [[California]] and [[New York (state)|New York]], have their own citation systems that differ significantly from the various federal and national standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/New_Styman.htm "New York Law Reports Style Manual"]&lt;/ref&gt; In California, the year is placed ''between'' the names of the parties and the reference to the case reporter; in New York, the year is wrapped by in [[Bracket#Square brackets .5B .5D|bracket]]s instead of [[Bracket#Parentheses ( )|parentheses]]. Both New York and California styles wrap an entire citation in parentheses when used as a stand-alone sentence, although New York places the terminating period outside the parentheses, whereas California places it inside. New York wraps just the reporter and page references in parentheses when the citation is used as a clause. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Either way, both state styles differ from the national/[[Bluebook]] style of simply dropping in the citation as a separate sentence without further adornment. Both systems use less punctuation and spacing in their reporter abbreviations.

For example, assuming that it is being placed as a stand-alone sentence, the ''Brown'' case above would be cited (using the official reporter) to a New York court as:

*(''People v. Brown'', 20 NY2d 238 [1967]).

And, again, as a stand-alone sentence, the famous ''Greenman'' [[product liability]] case would be cited to a California court as:

*(''Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc.'' (1963) 59 Cal.2d 57.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C2/59C2d57.htm ''Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc.'' (1963) 59 C2d 57&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unpublished decisions===
{{main|Non-publication}}
A growing number of court decisions are not published in case reporters.  For example, only 7% of the opinions of the California intermediate courts (the [[California Court of Appeal|Courts of Appeal]]) are published each year. This is mainly because judges certify only significant decisions for publication, due to the massive number of frivolous appeals flowing through the courts and the importance of avoiding information overload.&lt;ref&gt;''Schmier v. Supreme Court'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/CA4/78CA4t703.htm 78 Cal. App. 4th 703] (2000). The plaintiff in this case unsuccessfully challenged the selective publication policy as unconstitutional. The court retorted: "Appellant either misunderstands or ignores the realities of the intermediate appellate process." The court went on to describe the variety of frivolous appeals regularly encountered by the Courts of Appeal, and concluded: "Our typical opinions in such cases add nothing to the body of stare decisis, and if published would merely clutter overcrowded library shelves and databases with information utterly useless to anyone other than the actual litigants therein and complicate the search for meaningful precedent."&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also argued that this is in part because in many states, especially California, the legislature has failed to expand the judiciary to keep up with population growth (for various political and fiscal reasons). To deal with their crushing caseloads, many judges prefer to write shorter-than-normal opinions that dispose of minor issues in the case in a sentence or two. They avoid publishing such abbreviated opinions, however, so as not to risk creating bad [[precedent]]s. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Attorneys have several options in citing "unpublished" decisions:
* For cases that have not been published or put in an electronic database, or very recently decided cases that have not ''yet'' been published or put in an electronic database, a citation to the case's docket number before the court that decided it is required.
**''Groucho Marx Prods. v. Playboy Enters.'', No. 77 Civ. 1782 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 30, 1977) – a decision of the [[U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York]]; the docket number and specific date allow a researcher to track down the printed copy maintained by the court if needed (legal citation forms strongly prefer citations to traditional printed resources).
* Even though only some decisions of the U.S. Courts of Appeal are considered "published" (those appearing in ''Federal Reporter''), Thomson West has recently started making available all decisions officially considered "unpublished" in a separate publication called ''Federal Appendix'' (abbreviated "F. App'x").
* Cases intentionally left officially unpublished are nonetheless often "published" on computer services, such as [[LexisNexis]] and [[Westlaw]]. These services have their own citation formats based on the year of the case, an abbreviation indicating the computer service (or a specific database of that computer service), and an identification number; citations to online databases also usually include the case's [[docket (court)|docket]] number and the specific date when it was decided (due to the preference for citation to traditional printed resources). Examples include:
**''[[Fuqua Homes, Inc. v. Beattie]]'', No. 03-3587, 2004 WL 2495842 (8th Cir. Nov. 8, 2004) – a case found on the Westlaw electronic database, decided by the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]]; the citation includes the case's original docket number (No. 03-3587), and a citation to the electronic database that indicates the date of decision, the database (WL for Westlaw) and a unique serial number in that database (2495842).
**''[[Chavez v. Metro. Dist. Comm'n]]'', No. 3:02CV458(MRK), 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11266 (D. Conn. June 1, 2004) – a case decided by the [[U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut]]; the citation includes the case's original docket number (No. 3:02CV458(MRK)), the date of decision, the database (U.S. Dist. LEXIS, indicating the LexisNexis database for U.S. District Court cases), and a unique serial number in that database (11266).

Some court systems—such as the [[California]] state [[Judiciary of California|court system]] and the federal [[United States courts of appeals|Court of Appeals]] for the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh]], and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuits]]—forbid attorneys to cite unpublished cases as precedent. Other systems allow citation of unpublished cases only under specific circumstances. For example, in [[Kentucky]], unpublished cases from that state's courts can only be cited if the case was decided after January 1, 2003, and "there is no published opinion that would adequately address the issue before the court".  From 2004 to 2006, federal judges debated whether the [[Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure]] (FRAP) should be amended so that unpublished cases in all circuits could be cited as precedent. In 2006, the Supreme Court, over the objection of several hundred judges and lawyers, adopted a new Rule 32.1 of FRAP requiring that federal courts allow citation of unpublished cases. The rule took effect on January 1, 2007.

===Vendor-neutral citations===
With the rise of the web, many courts placed new cases on websites.  Some were published while others never lost their "unpublished" status. The major legal citation systems required cites to the officially published page numbers, in which publishers such as [[West Publishing]] claimed a copyright interest.

A vendor-neutral citation movement&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aallnet.org/Documents/Leadership-Governance/Committees/taskforce.html#Definitions AALL Citation Formats Committee]; accessed May 31, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; led to provisions being made for citations to web-based cases and other legal materials. A few courts modified their rules to specifically take into account cases "published" on the web.

An example of a vendor-neutral citation:
*''[[Equal. Found. of Greater Cincinnati, Inc. v. City of Cincinnati]]'', 1997 FED App. 0318P (6th Cir.) – a 1997 case decided by the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]]; the citation to the numbering system adopted by the court ("1997 FED App. 0318P") eliminates the need to cite to a specific vendor's product, in this case [[West (publisher)|Thomson West]]'s ''[[Federal Reporter]]'' (i.e., 128 F.3d 289).

===Pinpoint citations===
In practice, most lawyers go one step farther, once they have developed the correct citation for a case using the rules discussed above. Most court opinions contain holdings on multiple issues, so lawyers need to cite to the page that contains the specific holding they wish to invoke in their own case. Such citations are known as pinpoint citations, "pin cites", or "jump cites".&lt;ref&gt;[http://libguides.law.tulane.edu/content.php?pid=209935&amp;sid=5027306 Using Pinpoints], Tulane University Law School, Legal Citation Guide.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in ''Roe v. Wade'', the U.S. Supreme Court held that the word "person" as used in the Fourteenth Amendment does not include the unborn.  That particular holding appears on page 158 of the volume in which the ''Roe'' decision was published.  A full pin cite to ''Roe'' for that holding would be as follows:

* ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', 410 U.S. 113, 158 (1973).

And a parallel cite to all three U.S. Supreme Court reporters, combined with pin cites for all three, would produce:

* ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', 410 U.S. 113, 158, 93 S. Ct. 705, 729, 35 L. Ed. 2d 147, 180 (1973).

But in its opinions, the Court usually provides a direct pin cite only to the official reporter. The two unofficial reporters, when they reprint the Court's opinions, add on parallel cites to each other, but do not add pin cites.  Therefore, a citation to ''Roe v. Wade'' in a later Supreme Court decision as viewed on Lexis or Westlaw would appear as follows:

* ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', 410 U.S. 113, 158, 93 S. Ct. 705, 35 L. Ed. 2d 147 (1973).

Even then, such citations are still quite lengthy, and may look quite mysterious and intimidating to laypersons when they read court opinions. Since the 1980s, there has been an ongoing debate among American judges as to whether they should relegate such lengthy citations to footnotes to improve the readability of their opinions, as strongly urged by [[Bryan A. Garner]], one of the leading authors on [[legal writing]] and style. Most judges do relegate ''some'' citations to footnotes, but jurists such as Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] and Judge [[Richard Posner]] refuse to use footnotes in their opinions.

===Types of citations===
There are two types of citations: proprietary and [[public domain]] citations. There are many citation guides; the most commonly acknowledged is called ''[[The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation]]'', compiled by the ''[[Columbia Law Review]]'', ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', ''[[University of Pennsylvania Law Review]]'', and ''[[Yale Law Journal]]''. ''Public domain citations'' refer to the official reporters, rather than a publication service such as [[Westlaw]], [[LexisNexis]], particular legal journals, or specialization-specific reporters. States with their own unique style for court documents and case opinions also publish their own style guides, which include information on their citation rules.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The '''College of the State Bar of Texas''' is an honorary society of qualified [[lawyers]] who are interested in both high ethical standards and improved training for all [[Texas]] [[Lawyer|attorneys]].

==Purpose and membership==
The College recognizes [[Texas]] lawyers who voluntarily attend at least double the minimum [[Continuing Legal Education]] (CLE) classes required by the [[State Bar of Texas]].&lt;ref name="Regulations"&gt;{{cite web | title=Regulations| work=College of the State Bar of Texas, texasbarcollege.com|url=http://texasbarcollege.com/Regulations.html| accessdate=2007-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the State Bar of Texas mandates that every licensed attorney complete at least fifteen hours of continuing legal education classes each year,&lt;ref name="Texas Minimum Continuing Legal Education Rules"&gt;{{cite web | title=Texas Minimum Continuing Legal Education Rules| work=State Bar Rules, art. XII, sec. 6(A), www.texasbar.com|url=http://www.texasbar.com/Template.cfm?Section=Rules_and_Procedures1&amp;CONTENTID=10590&amp;TEMPLATE=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm| accessdate=2007-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; the College requires its members to double that number by attending thirty hours per year.&lt;ref name="Regulations"/&gt;

As of 2006, it was the only organization in the United States formed for the specific purpose of promoting and recognizing attorneys who strive to maintain and enhance their professional skills and the quality of their practice through voluntary participation in [[Continuing legal education|CLE]] programs. Historically, only about eight percent of the licensed attorneys in [[Texas]] (4,100 out of 63,500 in 1999) meet the requirements for membership in the College of the State Bar of Texas.&lt;ref name="Monday Wash: Five local barristers"&gt;{{cite web|title=Monday Wash: Five local barristers |author=Arambula, O |work=Larado Morning Times: Opinion, 6A (March 8, 1999), lmtonline.com |url=http://lmtonline.com/news/archive/0308/pagea6.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021231421/http://lmtonline.com/news/archive/0308/pagea6.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-21 |accessdate=2007-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The motto of the College is: "Professionalism Through Education."

Since 1993, the College of the State Bar has each year presented a lawyer with the Jim Bowmer Professionalism Award, an annual honor established to recognize members who have significantly contributed to professionalism within the legal community, as well as a Franklin Jones Best CLE Article Award and a Steve Condos Most CLE Hours Award.&lt;ref name="Annual Awards"&gt;{{cite web | title=Annual Awards| work=College of the State Bar of Texas, texasbarcollege.com|url=http://texasbarcollege.com/Awards.html| accessdate=2007-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Jim D. Bowmer and Franklin Jones, Jr., both past presidents of the State Bar of Texas, credit each other with starting the College of the State Bar. Mr. Bowmer, who believed that lawyers in Texas should be given recognition for attending programs of continuing legal education, urged Mr. Jones to persuade the Board of Directors of the State Bar of Texas to adopt the idea for the College. At the request of the Board of the Directors of the [[State Bar of Texas]], the College was established by the [[Texas Supreme Court]] on December 14, 1981.&lt;ref name="History of the State Bar College"&gt;{{cite web | title=History of the State Bar College| work=College of the State Bar of Texas, texasbarcollege.com|url=http://texasbarcollege.com/History.html| accessdate=2007-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2001, the Board of the State Bar voted to change the status of the College from a [[standing committee]] of the Bar to a "bar-related entity."  On October 25, 2001, the Texas Supreme Court amended its 1981 order establishing the College of the State Bar (Misc. Docket No. 01-9180) and directed it to pursue incorporation under the Texas Non-Profit Corporation Act. As a qualifying [[non-profit corporation]], the College applied for and received Section 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status under the United States [[Internal Revenue Code]].&lt;ref name="History of the State Bar College"/&gt;

The '''Czech Pirate Party''' ({{lang-cs|Česká pirátská strana}}) or '''Pirates''' ({{lang-cs|Piráti}})&lt;ref name="kontakty"/&gt; is a [[political party]] in the [[Czech Republic]], founded in 2009. It is the third largest party in the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic|Chamber of Deputies]] following the [[Czech legislative election, 2017|2017 legislative election]], with 22 out of 200 seats,&lt;ref name="BBC October 22, 2017"/&gt; entering the Chamber of Deputies for the first time since its formation. The parliamentary party sits in [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] to the [[Andrej Babiš' Second Cabinet|ruling cabinet]], and party leader [[Ivan Bartoš]] serves as the chairman of the Committee on Public Administration and Regional Development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psp.cz/en/sqw/detail.sqw?id=6433 PhDr. Ivan Bartos, Ph.D.] psp.cz.&lt;/ref&gt; The party is represented by three Members of the [[Senate of the Czech Republic]], it formed a governing coalition in the [[Prague]] City Assembly and [[Zdeněk Hřib]] is the current [[List of mayors of Prague|Mayor of Prague]].

The party's program focuses on political [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]]&lt;ref name="Nordsieck"/&gt; and [[accountability]], [[Corruption|anti-corruption]], [[e-government]], [[Participatory democracy|public participation in democratic decision making]], supporting [[small business]], funding of [[local development]], [[tax avoidance]] prevention and safeguarding of [[civil liberties]]. The party has also introduced proposals for policies and reforms for taxation, education, science, healthcare, environment, culture, industry and trade, agriculture, justice system and foreign relations.&lt;ref name="Pirates official program"/&gt;

== History ==
=== Formation and early years ===
The Czech Pirate Party was founded as a student-driven [[grassroots]] [[Political movement|movement]] campaigning for [[political transparency]], [[civil rights]] and [[participatory democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip Heijmans. [https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2018-09-24/in-czech-elections-pirate-party-eyes-prague-mayors-seat Pirates Seek to Plant a Flag in Prague]. ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]''. September 24, 2018,&lt;/ref&gt; The party was originally inspired by the [[Swedish Pirate Party]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hp.sqw?k=6600 Poslanecký klub České pirátské strany vznikl v 8. období 22. října 2017.] psp.cz.&lt;/ref&gt; which like most other [[Pirate Party|Pirate parties]] was a single-issue party focusing on [[Internet freedom]].&lt;ref name="Maškarinec"/&gt; However, the Czech Pirate Party has developed a broad political platform grounded in [[social liberalism]] and [[left-libertarianism]].&lt;ref name="Maškarinec"/&gt;

On 27 May 2009 an application was submitted to the [[Ministry of the Interior (Czech Republic)|Ministry of the Interior]] for registration of the party. On 17 June, the party was registered under the code MV-39553-7/VS-2009.&lt;ref name="novinky.cz"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.novinky.cz/internet-a-pc/171841-ceska-piratska-strana-ma-povoleni-ministerstva-a-chce-do-parlamentu.html | title = Česká pirátská strana má povolení ministerstva a chce do parlamentu | language = Czech | work = Novinky.cz | date = 22 June 2009 | first = Miloslav | last = Fišer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the first two days of the launch of their website in April, 1,800 people had signed an online petition to register the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://zpravy.idnes.cz/domaci.asp?c=A090421_160045_domaci_anv | title = Čeští internetoví piráti zakládají politickou stranu | language = Czech | work = iDnes.cz | date = 21 April 2009 | first = Andrea | last = Votrubová}}&lt;/ref&gt; Czech law requires a paper petition with 1,000 signatures for registration. In the student elections, the Pirate Party received 7.7% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.wienerzeitung.at/default.aspx?tabID=3861&amp;alias=wzo&amp;cob=494591 | title = Tschechien: Jugend vereint gegen Linksparteien | work = Wiener Zeitung | date = 21 May 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110606122248/http://www.wienerzeitung.at/default.aspx?tabID=3861&amp;alias=wzo&amp;cob=494591 | archivedate = 6 June 2011 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 June 2009 the party held a constitutive forum in [[Průhonice]], near Prague, where the board was elected and main elements of the program were declared. Kamil Horký was elected as chairman. At the end of October 2009 in [[Albrechtice nad Orlicí]], the General Assembly (GA) met for the first time, to complete statutes and elect a new board, commission and committee. [[Ivan Bartoš]] became party chairman.

The party participated in the [[Czech legislative election, 2010|general election]] in May 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/zpravy/384074 | title = Czech Interior Ministry registers Czech Pirate Party | work = ČeskéNoviny.cz | date = 22 June 2009 | agency = [[Czech News Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received 0.8% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.election.cz/pls/ps2010/ps2?xjazyk=EN |title=Election to the Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic held on 28 – 29 May 2010 |publisher=Czech Statistical Office |date=2010-05-30 |accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, the party launched its own national whistle-blowing site similar to [[WikiLeaks]], called PirateLeaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,6376006,00.html | title = Czech Pirate Party launches new whistleblowing site | work = Deutsche Welle | date = 2010-12-29 | accessdate = 2011-03-14 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110629001134/http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0%2C%2C6376006%2C00.html | archivedate = 2011-06-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was intended as a primary source for journalists, dedicated to evidence of corruption in the Czech government and public administration documents which should be publicly available according to law 106/1999 Sb. (Free Access to Information Act) but which the authorities refused to disclose without a formal request defined by the law.

=== Parliamentary party until present ===
[[File:Praha, Smíchov, volební štáb, Ivan Bartoš a Zdeněk Hřib.jpg|thumb|Following the [[Prague municipal election, 2018|2018 Prague municipal election]], the party formed a governing coalition and [[Zdeněk Hřib]] (left) was elected [[List of mayors of Prague|Mayor of Prague]].]]
Standing in a local senate election on 18–19 March 2011 in [[Kladno]], they obtained 0.75% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;http://wiki.pp-international.net/Main_Page PPI wiki&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Czech Senate election, 2012]], the Czech Pirate Party nominated three candidates; one of them was a co-nomination with two other parties. This candidate, the whistleblower [[Libor Michálek]], was elected as Senator in the second round of voting, with the Czech Pirate Party becoming a parliamentary party for the first time.

In local elections in 2014 the party entered many local assemblies, including a clear majority in [[Mariánské Lázně]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://piratetimes.net/pirates-to-enter-several-local-czech-parliaments/|title=Pirates to Enter Several Local Czech Parliaments|publisher=PirateTimes|date=2014-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in [[Vojtěch Franta]] being elected as the party's first mayor.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/regiony/292152-prvni-starosta-z-piratu-chceme-marianske-lazne-omladit/|title=První starosta z Pirátů: Chceme Mariánské Lázně omladit|trans-title=The first Pirate mayor: We want to rejuvenate Marianske Lazne|publisher=Ceskatelevize|date=2014-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Mayor of Mariánské Lázně|url=http://www.muml.cz/mestsky-urad/starosta/|date=2014-11-13|publisher=City of Mariánské Lázně}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Czech Senate election, 2016|2016 Senate election]], the Pirates won two additional seats in the Senate with Ladislav Kos and Renata Chmelová, who were nominated by multi-party coalitions with the Pirates' support.&lt;ref&gt;[https://volby.idnes.cz/senat-2016.aspx Výsledky voleb v České republice Senátní volby 2016 (konečné výsledky)]. ''[[Mladá fronta DNES]]''. &lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Czech legislative election, 2017|2017 legislative election]], the party became the third largest party in the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic|Chamber of Deputies]] with 22 out of 200 seats and sits in [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] to the [[Andrej Babiš' Second Cabinet|ruling cabinet]].&lt;ref name="BBC October 22, 2017"/&gt; Economist and auditor [[Lukáš Wagenknecht]] was elected [[Senate of the Czech Republic|Senator]] in the [[Czech Senate election, 2018|2018 election]], when Michálek's term ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://plus.rozhlas.cz/ivan-stern-wagenknecht-vyhral-senatni-volby-7640959|title=Ivan Štern: Wagenknecht vyhrál senátní volby|date=2018-10-13|publisher=[[Czech Radio]]|access-date=2018-10-16|language=cs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pirates ranked second in the [[Prague municipal election, 2018|2018 Prague municipal election]] with 13 out of 65 seats and formed a governing coalition with the third and fourth-ranked parties that holds 39 out of 65 seats in the [[Prague City Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://domaci.ihned.cz/c1-66312370-nova-koalice-planuje-personalni-zmeny-v-mestskych-firmach-chce-tak-skoncovat-se-systemem-politickych-trafik Nová pražská koalice plánuje personální změny v městských firmách.

== Positions and objectives ==
=== Political positions ===
In a 2016 analysis of voters' perception of political parties, the Czech Pirate Party was identified as [[Centrism|centrist]] (having both [[Right-wing politics|right wing]] and [[Left-wing politics|left wing]] voters) and "[[Liberalism|liberal]]" (as opposed to "[[Conservatism|conservative]]").&lt;ref&gt;[https://zpravy.idnes.cz/politicky-kompas-prvni-zjisteni-d43-/domaci.aspx?c=A160911_141109_domaci_jw Politická mapa podle čtenářů: Úsvit a ANO neuchopitelní, o KSČM máte jasno]. ''[[Mladá fronta DNES]]''. 13 September, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The party's program focuses on control of [[Power (social and political)|political power]] and [[government spending]] through [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]], [[accountability]] and [[Corruption|anti-corruption]] measures, safeguarding of [[civil liberties]] including [[digital rights]], introducing elements of [[participatory democracy]] by enabling law proposals by the public through [[petition]]s and simplification of state [[bureaucracy]] through [[e-government]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lidovky.cz/pirati-se-vymezili-proti-vyroku-andreje-babise-novym-sloganem-vsichni-nekradou-gdb-/zpravy-domov.aspx?c=A170907_121342_ln_domov_ELE Piráti představili program. Do voleb jdou se sloganem ‚Všichni nekradou‘]. ''[[Lidové noviny]]''. Published on September 7, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Czech Pirate Party is generally [[Pro-Europeanism|pro-European]] and pro-[[Eurozone]], while advocating major reforms in both institutions to address the perceived [[democratic deficit in the European Union]]. The Pirates propose that the Czech Republic should participate in the mainstream of the [[European integration]] and should participate in EU decision making, but should [[Czech Republic and the euro|adopt the Euro]] only if specific conditions are fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pirati.cz/program/temata/euro/ Euro 2024 – Roadmapa]&lt;/ref&gt; The party also supports Czech membership of [[NATO]], but it is critical of aggression by NATO members and argues that any engagement of NATO forces outside of the territories of its member states should take place only if supported by a [[United Nations resolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pirati.cz/tiskove-zpravy/nato-a-evropska-obrana.html Stanovisko Pirátů ke kolektivní obraně v rámci EU a NATO] (Czech).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pirates oppose the [[Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership]] (TTIP),&lt;ref&gt;ČTK, iDNES.cz.

Published on 17 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The party supports a [[bank tax]], the strengthening of the [[Czech National Bank]]'s authority; measures to stop [[capital outflow]], prevent [[financial speculation]] that lead to [[financial crisis|financial crises]] and [[financial crime]]; and it is against any taxpayer-funded [[bank bailout]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pirati.cz/program/temata/banky/ Banky, které se postarají samy o sebe]. pirati.cz.&lt;/ref&gt; The party also proposes the establishment of a [[lobby register]] and a lobbying law.&lt;ref&gt;Karolína Sadílková.

*Control of power and government spending through transparency and accountability
*Simplification of state bureaucracy by introducing e-government
*Supporting [[small business]]es and [[e-commerce]], addressing [[capital outflow]] of [[Foreign ownership|foreign-owned]] companies and [[tax avoidance]] via [[offshore financial centre]]s

'''''Donselaar v Donselaar''''' [1982] 1 NZLR 97 is an often cited case in New Zealand regarding the legal issue of [[exemplary damages]] which held that although the ACC law prohibits damages for compensation, it does not exclude liability for punitive damages (exemplary damages).

==Background==
The Donselaar family had a long running family dispute, culminating in John Donselaar trespassing on his brother Andrew's property. Not happy with his brother's trespass, Andrew hit his brother over the head with a hammer.

As a result, John sued Andrew for damages for this assault. As section 5 of the Accident Compensation Act [1972] prohibits suing for damages for physical injury, John sued for exemplary damages for the hammer attack.

==Decision==
The court ruled that the Accident Compensation Act [1972] did not prohibit damages for exemplary damages. However the court rules that it was the conduct of the defendant was the deciding factor on whether special punishment of exemplary damages should be awarded, and not the nature of the plaintiff's injury. Which was unfortunate for the plaintiff here, as the court referred to him here as the "principal irritant", as amongst other things, he was trespassing at the time of the assault, and as a result, the court declined to make an award for exemplary damages to the plaintiff.

The issue was Apple's variation of the '''[[Double Irish arrangement|Double Irish]]''' tax system, which, from 2004–2014, Apple used to shield circa €110.8 billion&lt;ref name="cof1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cof2"/&gt; of non–U.S. profits from tax.&lt;ref name="rotten apple"&gt;{{Cite journal| url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08853908.2017.1356250|title=The Rotten Apple: Tax Avoidance in Ireland|journal=The International Trade Journal|volume=32|pages=150|date=2 August 2017|publisher=The International Trade Journal| doi=10.1080/08853908.2017.1356250|last1=Barrera|first1=Rita|last2=Bustamante|first2=Jessica}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Apple did not use the standard ''two separate Irish companies'', as Google and other Irish-based U.S. multinationals employ with their [[Double Irish]] tax systems, but instead received two rulings from the [[Revenue Commissioners|Irish Revenue]] (in 1991, and again updated in 2007), that it could use a single Irish company, split into ''two branches''.  These were private rulings to Apple, not given to other Irish-based U.S. multinationals, and thus charged as illegal Irish State aid by the Commission.&lt;ref name="cliff"/&gt;

On the 9 January 2015, Apple informed the Commission{{efn|name=findings|Revealed when the EU Commission published their full COMMISSION DECISION (S.A 38373), page 42 section 2.5.7 ''Apple's new corporate structure in Ireland as of 2015''.&lt;ref name="eu1"/&gt;}} that it closed its hybrid–Double Irish, [[base erosion and profit shifting]] ("BEPS") tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/competition/elojade/isef/case_details.cfm?proc_code=3_SA_38373|title=CASE SA.38373: STATE AID TO APPLE|publisher=EU Commission|date=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Q1 2015, Apple restructured into a new Irish BEPS tool called the '''[[Double Irish#Backstop of capital allowances|Capital Allowances for Intangible Assets]]''' ("CAIA") tool,&lt;ref name="cof2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economic-incentives.blogspot.ie/2018/01/what-apple-did-next.html|title=What Apple did next|publisher=Economic Incentives, [[University College Cork]]|author=Seamus Coffey, [[Irish Fiscal Advisory Council]]|date=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cofr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfr.org/blog/tax-avoidance-and-irish-balance-payments|title=Tax Avoidance and the Irish Balance of Payments|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|date=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; also called the "[[Ireland as a tax haven#Green Jersey|Green Jersey]]".  Apple's Q1 2015 restructuring required a 12 July 2016 restatement of Irish 2015 GDP, which increased it by 26.3 per cent (later revised to 34.4 per cent); the restatement was called "[[leprechaun economics]]", and led to new EU inquiries in 2017,&lt;ref name="eu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sb1"/&gt; and confirmation in June 2018, that Ireland was the world's [[tax haven#Top 10 tax havens|largest tax haven]].&lt;ref name="zux"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/ireland-is-the-world-s-biggest-corporate-tax-haven-say-academics-1.3528401?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fbusiness%2Feconomy%2Fireland-is-the-world-s-biggest-corporate-tax-haven-say-academics-1.3528401|title=Ireland is the world’s biggest corporate ‘tax haven’, say academics|quote=New Gabriel Zucman study claims State shelters more multinational profits than the entire Caribbean|publisher=Irish Times|date=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ireland's rejection of the EU Commission's "windfall" in back-taxes surprised some.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/irish-appeal-of-apple-ruling-a-strange-decision-says-moscovici-1.2785431|title=Irish appeal of Apple ruling a ‘strange decision’, says Moscovici|publisher=Irish Times|date=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in {{slink|#Understanding Irish decision}}, U.S.–controlled multinationals are 25 of Ireland's top 50 companies, pay over 80% of all Irish corporate taxes (circa. €8 billion per annum),&lt;ref name="rev"/&gt;  directly employ 25 per cent of the Irish labour force&lt;ref name="IDA1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oecdx"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/investment/IRELAND-trade-investment-statistical-country-note.pdf|title=IRELAND Trade and Statistical Note 2017|publisher=OECD|date=2017|pages=2-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and indirectly pay half of all Irish salary taxes), and are 57 per cent of all non-farm OECD value-add in the Irish economy.  The American–Ireland Chamber of Commerce estimated that the value of U.S. investment in Ireland was €334 billion, exceeding Irish GDP (€291 billion in 2016).&lt;ref name="amc"/&gt; In contrast, there are no non–U.S./non–U.K. foreign multinationals in Ireland's top 50 firms.  The U.K. firms are either selling into Ireland, like Tesco, or date pre–2009, after which the U.K. reformed to a "territorial" tax system.  Multinationals from "territorial" systems rarely use [[tax havens]], and in 2016, the U.S. was one of the last "worldwide" tax systems in operation.  The cost of U.S. multinationals abandoning Ireland as a U.S. corporate–[[tax haven]], would greatly exceed the EU's €13 billion "windfall".

=== History of Apple in Ireland ===
{{see also|Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Low tax economy}}
On the 23 December 1980, Apple opened production facilities in Holyhill, Cork.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishcentral.com/opinion/others/when-steve-jobs-and-apple-first-came-to-ireland-137472208-238117741|title=When Steve Jobs and Apple first came to Ireland|last=|first=|date=17 January 2012|work=|newspaper=IrishCentral.com|access-date=14 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/steve-jobs-in-cork-ireland-in-1980-2016-8|title=Apple defended its Irish tax-minimizing operation using a classic photo of Steve Jobs in Cork|last=Leswing|first=Kif|date=30 August 2016|work=|newspaper=Business Insider|access-date=14 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1990, the number of jobs had grown from 700 jobs to 1000 permanent jobs, as well as 500 sub-contractors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-apple-managed-to-get-its-tax-deal-in-ireland-in-1991-2016-8?r=UK&amp;IR=T|title=A deal made in 1991 paved the way for Apple's current tax issue|last=Cook|first=James|date=30 August 2016|work=|newspaper=Business Insider|access-date=14 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interview excerpts, published by European Commission, found that this information was used in the way of background information by a tax adviser representing Apple during meetings with Apple in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/233744b6-4886-11e4-ad19-00144feab7de?siteedition=uk#axzz3Eo859Rt0|title=Interview extracts between Apple tax advisers and Irish Revenue|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ft.com|publisher=|access-date=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By November 2016, Apple employed 6,000 people in Ireland, almost all of which were in the Apple Hollyhill Cork plant.  The Cork plant is Apple's only self-operated manufacturing plant in the world (e.g. Apple always contracts to 3rd party manufacturers).  Holyhill is considered a low-technology facility, building iMacs to order by hand, and in this regard is more akin to a global logistics hub for Apple (albeit located on the island of Ireland).  No research is carried out in the facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/30/the-guardian-view-on-tax-and-ireland-apple-pay-your-way|title=The Guardian view on tax and Ireland: Apple, pay your way|date=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unusually for a plant, over 700 of the 6,000 employees work from home (the largest remote percentage of any Irish technology company).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/revealed-eight-facts-you-may-not-know-about-the-apple-irish-plant-36409796.html|title=Revealed Eight facts you may not know about the Apple Irish plant|publisher=Irish Independent|date=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/may/29/apple-tax-profits-ireland-cork|title=Apple's multi-billion dollar, low-tax profit hub: Knocknaheeny, Ireland|publisher=The Guardian|date=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple’s unusual Cork plant should be seen in the context of the job thresholds Ireland places on U.S. multinationals availing of the main Irish [[BEPS]] tools, discussed [[Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Low tax economy|here]], which provide ''[[Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Effective tax rate (ETR)|effective Irish tax rates]]'' of 0–3%, but require specific employment quotas; and give more "substance" to the BEPS tool.

In 2014, Apple's Irish structure consisted of two [[Subsidiary|subsidiaries]]; Apple Operations Ireland ("AOI") an Irish-registered holding company which acts as an internal financing company. AOI claimed tax residence in [[Bermuda]] and thus, is not an Irish tax resident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/blog/checkpoint/Apples-13-billion-Irish-back-tax-bill-reverberates-around-the-world|title=Apple's €13 billion Irish back-tax bill reverberates around the world - Apple and Ireland to appeal; U.S. denounces decision|last=Hayes|first=Terry|date=2 September 2016|work=|newspaper=Thomson Reuters Tax &amp; Accounting|language=en-US|access-date=14 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU Commission [[State Aid]] fine does not pertain to AOI. 

Apple Sales International ("ASI"), on the other hand, is the focus of the EU Commission's fine (and was the focus of 2013 Senate Investigation).  ASI is an Irish-registered subsidiary of Apple Operations Europe ("AOE").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapid=26016763|title=Apple Sales International: Private Company Information - Businessweek|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

ASI's 2014 structure was an adaptation of the [[Double Irish arrangement|Double Irish]] scheme, an Irish [[Corporate haven#IP-based BEPS tools|IP–based BEPS tool]] used by many U.S. multinationals. Apple did not follow the traditional Double Irish structure of using ''two separate Irish companies''.  Instead, Apple used ''two separate "branches" inside one single company'', namely ASI.&lt;ref name="cliff"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/apple-s-irish-company-structure-key-to-eu-tax-finding-1.2775684|title=Apple’s Irish company structure key to EU tax finding|last=Taylor|first=Cliff|date=2 September 2016|work=|newspaper=The Irish Times|language=en-US|access-date=14 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is this "branch structure" the EU Commission allege is illegal State aid, as it was not offered to other multinationals in Ireland, who had used the traditional ''two separate companies'' version of the Double Irish BEPS tool.

Under the [[Double Irish|Double Irish]] structure, one Irish subsidiary (IRL1) is an Irish registered company selling products to non–U.S. locations from Ireland. The other Irish subsidiary (IRL2) is "registered" in Ireland, but "managed and controlled" from a tax haven like Bermuda. The Irish tax code considers IRL2 a Bermuda company (used the "managed and controlled" test), but the U.S. tax code considers IRL2 an Irish company (uses the registration test). Neither taxes it.  Apple's subsidiary, ASI, behaved like it was IRL2, it was "managed and controlled" via ASI Board meetings in Bermuda, so Irish Revenue did not tax it.  But ASI also did all the functions of IRL1, making circa €110.8 billion&lt;ref name="cof1"/&gt; of profits from Non–U.S. sales.  The EU Commission contest IRL1's actions made ASI Irish, and the functions of IRL1 over-rode the Bermuda Board meetings in deciding the "managed and controlled" test.  The Commission had not brought any cases against U.S. multinationals using the standard double ''two separate companies'' Irish BEPS tool.

Apple's unique ASI structure, is believed to be the reason why Apple never had an Apple retail store in the Republic of Ireland (it even has one in smaller Belfast).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/apple-store-ireland-1999423-Mar2015/|title=Why there are no Apple Stores in the Republic and probably won't be for a while|date=15 March 2015|publisher=thejournal.ie|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ahern-Bush-Patrick's2005.jpg|thumb|On the 14 September 2016, former Irish [[Taoiseach]] [[Bertie Ahern]] (from 1997 to 2008), said that the Irish [[Revenue Commissioners]] kept the Apple 1991 and 2007 tax rulings secret from the Irish Cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/ireland/revenue-kept-apple-tax-deal-from-cabinet-c33r330mg|title=BERTIE AHERN: Revenue ‘kept Apple tax deal from cabinet’|publisher=Sunday Times|date=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In May 2013, Apple’s tax practices were examined by a U.S. bipartisan investigation of the [[United States Senate Homeland Security Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations|Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigation]].&lt;ref name="senate"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/subcommittees/investigations/media/subcommittee-to-examine-offshore-profit-shifting-and-tax-avoidance-by-apple-inc|title=Majority Media {{!}} Media {{!}}  Homeland Security &amp; Governmental Affairs Committee|last=|first=|date=|website=www.hsgac.senate.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation aimed to examine whether Apple used [[Offshore financial centre|offshore structures]], in conjunction with arrangements, to shift profits from the U.S. to Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/05/21/apples-profit-shifting-claims-were-in-humpty-dumpty-territory-here/#71b220cc50c2|title=Apple's Profit Shifting Claims: We're In Humpty Dumpty Territory Here|last=Worstall|first=Tim|date=21 May 2013|work=|newspaper=Forbes|access-date=14 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senators [[Carl Levin]] and [[John McCain]] drew light on what they referred to as a special tax arrangement between Apple and Ireland which allowed Apple to pay a [[Corporate tax|corporate tax rate]] of less than 2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2013/0531/453905-ambassador-us-tax/|title=US Senator repeats Irish 'tax haven' claim|last=|first=|date=31 May 2013|work=|newspaper=RTE.ie|access-date=14 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="psi1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/142660268/Subcommittee-Memo-on-Offshore-Profit-Shifting-Apple|title=Offshore Profit Shifting and the U.S. Tax Code - Part 2 (Apple Inc.)|author1=Senator Carl Levin|author2=Senator John McCain|publisher=US Senate|quote=A number of studies show that multinational corporations are moving "mobile" income out of the United States into low or no tax jurisdictions, including tax havens such as Ireland, Bermuda, and the Cayman Islands.|page=3| date=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="psi2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/ireland-ambassador-letter-us-senate-corporate-tax-932838-May2013/|title=Senators insists Ireland IS a tax haven, despite ambassador's letter: Carl Levin and John McCain have dismissed the Irish ambassador's account of Ireland's corporate tax system.|publisher=thejournal.ie|quote=Senators LEVIN and McCAIN: Most reasonable people would agree that negotiating special tax arrangements that allow companies to pay little or no income tax meets a common-sense definition of a tax haven.| date=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="psi3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ireland-tax/ireland-rejects-u-s-senator-claims-as-tax-spat-rumbles-on-idUSBRE94U0VU20130531|title=Ireland rejects U.S. senator claims as tax spat rumbles on|publisher=Reuters|date=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In June 2014, an investigation was opened by the [[European Commissioner for Competition]] on behalf of the EU Commission (SA 38373).&lt;ref name="eur"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-663_en.htm|title=Commission investigates transfer pricing arrangements on corporate taxation of Apple (Ireland) Starbucks (Netherlands) and Fiat Finance and Trade (Luxembourg)||publisher=EU Commission|date=11 June 2004|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ireland case was opened in conjunction with two other similar cases; involving [[Starbucks]] ([[Netherlands]]) and [[Fiat Automobiles|Fiat]] ([[Luxembourg]]). The Commissioner noted concerns that discretion in [[transfer pricing]] rules had been used to give Apple selective advantage.

=== Finding (2016) ===

[[File:DOORSTEP 2016-09-09 EUROGROUP Ministers (28935735673).jpg|thumb|On the 2 September 2016, the acting Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan, described the EU Commission ruling as an attempt to establish a "bridgehead, to bring down Ireland's 12.5% corporate tax rate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/apple-ruling-is-aimed-at-harming-irish-tax-regime-claims-noonan-1.2776908|title=Apple ruling is aimed at harming Irish tax regime, claims Noonan|publisher=Irish Times|date=2 September 2016|quote=I do. I think they are establishing a bridgehead. There is a lot of envy across Europe about how successful we are in putting the HQ of so many companies into Ireland and especially into Dublin}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

On the 30 August 2016, the Commission released a 4–page [[press release]] describing their decision and rationale.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-2923_en.htm|title=European Commission - PRESS RELEASES  - Press release - State aid: Ireland gave illegal tax benefits to Apple worth up to €13 billion|last=|first=|date=30 August 2016|website=europa.eu|publisher=|access-date=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The EU Commission's full 130–page report on their State aid findings, including partially redacted information on Apple's Irish business (e.g. profits, employees, Board minutes etc.), was released on the 30 August 2016.&lt;ref name="eu1"/&gt;

According to the Commission, the tax arrangement between Ireland and Apple qualifies as state aid as it meets the European Union's four criteria:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/competition/state_aid/overview/index_en.html|title=What is state aid?

* This intervention gives the benefactor a [[competitive advantage]] on a selective basis
* As a result, competition has been or may be distorted
* The intervention is likely to affect trade between the Member States

{{quote|Member States cannot give tax benefits to selected companies – this is illegal under EU state aid rules. The Commission's investigation concluded that Ireland granted illegal tax benefits to Apple, which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses over many years. In fact, this selective treatment allowed Apple to pay an effective corporate tax rate of 1 per cent on its European profits in 2003 down to 0.005 per cent in 2014.|source=[[Margrethe Vestager]], "State aid: Ireland gave illegal tax benefits to Apple worth up to €13 billion", 30 August 2016.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;}}

The 30 August 2016 press briefing summarised the following findings from the main report:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

{{ordered list|type=lower-roman

|''The taxable profits of Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe in Ireland are determined by a tax ruling granted by Ireland in 1991, which in 2007 was replaced by a similar second tax ruling. This tax ruling was terminated when [ASI] and [AOE] changed their structures in 2015'';
|''Two tax rulings issued by Ireland to Apple have substantially and artificially lowered the tax paid by Apple in Ireland since 1991'';
|''These rulings endorsed a way to establish the taxable profits for two Irish companies of the Apple group [..] which did not correspond to economic reality'';
|''As a result of the allocation method endorsed in the tax rulings, Apple only paid an effective corporate tax rate that declined from 1% in 2003 to 0.005% in 2014.''

}}

The 30 August 2016 press briefing made the following statements regarding the financial implications:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

{{ordered list|type=lower-roman

|''The Commission can order recovery of illegal state aid for a ten-year period preceding the Commission's first request for information in 2013'';
|''Ireland must now recover the unpaid taxes in Ireland from Apple for the years 2003 to 2014 of up to €13 billion, plus interest [and normal penalties]''.

===Fine (2016)===

[[File:Barack Obama and Enda Kenny in the Oval Office 2012.jpg|thumb|On the 3 September 2016, the acting Irish [[Taoiseach]] [[Enda Kenny]], pictured with U.S. President [[Barack Obama]], called the EU Commission's €13 billion fine an attempt by the EU to "bully" Ireland, and that: "This is about the right of a small nation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/enda-kenny-europe-trying-to-bully-ireland-with-apple-tax-ruling-419214.html|publisher=Irish Examiner|date=4 September 2016|title=Enda Kenny: Europe trying to bully Ireland with Apple tax ruling}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/2016/0902/813786-apple-enda-kenny/|publisher=RTE News|date=3 September 2016|title=Taoiseach makes 'no apology' for defending right to appeal EC decision}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Commission fine of €13 billion was still an estimate, subject to final ASI accounts, and covers the period 2004 to 2014 inclusive, as the Commission is permitted to order a full recovery within a 10–year period from the start of any investigation.  The January 2018 updated estimate of the fine had risen to €13.85 billion&lt;ref name="cof2"/&gt;). The Commission fine is simply the estimated profits of, mainly, ASI applied, at the prevailing Irish corporate tax rate of 12.5% (see Table 1 above; and full EU Commission report).&lt;ref name="eu1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cof1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://economic-incentives.blogspot.ie/2016/03/apple-sales-internationalby-numbers.html|title=Apple Sales International–By the numbers|publisher=Economic Incentives, [[University College Cork]]|author=Seamus Coffey, [[Irish Fiscal Advisory Council]]|date=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, Apple will also owe interest penalties at the Irish [[Revenue Commissioners|Revenue]] penalty rate (was 8% in 2016), which would total circa €6 billion, giving a total fine of circa €20 billion.&lt;ref name="cof1"/&gt;  

A fallback position of the EU Commission's State aid case is that if ASI is '''not''' an Irish company, then it was a "stateless" company (given it was "legally" registered in Ireland), and Apple has been remitting royalty payments from EU–28 countries to a company in a jurisdiction with no EU tax treaty.  Apple would, therefore, owe back-taxes to each individual EU country, from which these royalties were paid (and not to Ireland).  As all other EU countries have corporation tax rates materially in excess of Ireland's 12.5% corporation tax rate, the total Apple effective taxes owned, in this scenario, would be materially in excess of €13 billion.  [[Margrethe Vestager]] appealed to individual EU taxing authorities to assess this aspect of Apple's State aid case for themselves, on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_AC-16-3727_en.htm|title=European Commission - Announcement Ireland granted undue tax benefits to Apple|publisher=EU Commission|date=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In fact, the tax treatment in Ireland enabled Apple to avoid taxation on almost all profits generated by sales of Apple products in the entire EU Single Market. This is due to Apple's decision to record all sales in Ireland rather than in the countries where the products were sold. This structure is however outside the remit of EU state aid control. If other countries were to require Apple to pay more tax on profits of the two companies over the same period under their national taxation rules, this would reduce the amount to be recovered by Ireland.|source=[[Margrethe Vestager]], "State aid: Ireland gave illegal tax benefits to Apple worth up to €13 billion", 30 August 2016.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;}}

=== Appeal (ongoing) ===

In November 2016, in a letter to the Apple community in Europe, Tim Cook said the company would appeal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Irish government also formally notified the EU Commission it would appeal in November 2016, and reject any claim to the €13 billion "windfall". In the immediate aftermath of the Commission's 29 August 2016 ruling, Ireland’s finance minister [[Michael Noonan (Fine Gael politician)|Michael Noonan]] stated that Ireland would be appealing the decision, subject to cabinet approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.finance.gov.ie/news-centre/press-releases/minister-noonan-disagrees-profoundly-commission-apple|title=Minister Noonan disagrees profoundly with the Commission on Apple|last=Byrne|first=David|date=30 August 2016|work=|newspaper=An Roinn Airgeadais, Department of Finance|language=en|access-date=14 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 September 2016, the Irish cabinet voted to approve the appeal.&lt;ref name="irl"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/irish-lawmakers-expected-to-approve-appeal-on-apple-ruling-1473256462|title=Irish Lawmakers Back Appeal on Apple Ruling|last=Hannon|first=Paul|date=7 September 2016|work=|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=14 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minority [[Fine Gael]]–led government also had to secure a general [[Dail Eireann]] vote on the matter, which it did on the 7 September 2016, by a majority of 93 to 36, securing the support of the other main Irish political party, [[Fianna Fáil]].&lt;ref name="dail"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dail2"/&gt;  

The appeal will firstly be heard in the [[General Court (European Union)|EU’s General Court]], with any further appeal being taken to the EU’s highest court; the [[European Court of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/09/02/apple-appeal-eu-tax-bill/|title=Apple Appeal Against EU Tax Bill Would Enter Uncharted Territory|last=|first=|date=2 September 2016|website=Fortune|publisher=|access-date=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Action brought on 9 November 2016 – Ireland v Commission|url=http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=187579&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=en&amp;mode=req&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=230206|website=CURIA|accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, it was reported that the appeal would begin before the end of 2018, but could take over 5 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/appeal-over-apple-tax-may-start-this-year-tns55tgtk|title=Appeal over Apple tax may start this year: State’s case gets priority but could last five years|publisher=[[The Sunday Times]]|date=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and that Apple had begun to lodge the €13 billion into an [[escrow account]] during Q2 2018.&lt;ref name="13bn"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ca.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKBN1KN27E-OCABS|title=Apple says it has paid two-thirds of its tax bill|publisher=Reuters|date=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 18 September 2018, it was reported that Apple had lodged the €13 billion, plus another €1.3 billion,{{efn|The extra €1.3 billion has been reported as being ''interest'', however, interest is not payable when there is an appeal; it is more likely that €14.3 billion is the final total fine, excluding interest, as a result of the final audited ASI accounts for 2013 and 2014 being filed.&lt;ref name="cof1"/&gt;}} into the Irish State's escrow account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/technology/state-collects-13bn-apple-tax-bill-plus-interest-37329162.html|title=State collects €13bn Apple tax bill – plus interest|date=18 September 2018|publisher=Irish Independent|author=Louise Kelly}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 2018, the Commission announced that it would drop its legal action against Ireland for late payment of the fine (deadline was 3 January 2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/commission-drops-legal-action-against-ireland-over-apple-aid-1.3667869|title=Commission drops legal action against Ireland over Apple ‘aid’|publisher=[[Irish Times]]|author=Ciara O'Brian|date=8 October 2018|quote=The action was taken following a delay of several months in recovering the money from the tech giant.

The EU Commission's findings cover the period from 2004 to end 2014, and their report notes that Apple had informed them at the start of 2015 that they had closed down their controversial hybrid–[[Double Irish]] BEPS tool, ASI, which enabled the Commission to complete their State aid report, and finalise the fine of €13 billion.&lt;ref name="eu1"/&gt;  

In January 2018, economist Seamus Coffey, Chairman of the State's [[Irish Fiscal Advisory Council]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/chairman-fiscal-advisory-council-theres-been-a-very-strong-recovery-we-are-now-living-within-our-means-36500320.html|title=Chairman, Fiscal Advisory Council: 'There's been a very strong recovery - we are now living within our means'|publisher=Irish Independent|date=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and author of the State's 2017 ''Review of Ireland's Corporation Tax Code'',&lt;ref name="coffey1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finance.gov.ie/updates/minister-donohoe-publishes-review-of-irelands-corporation-tax-code/|title=Minister Donohoe publishes Review of Ireland's Corporation Tax Code|publisher=Department of Finance|date=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="coffey2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finance.gov.ie/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/170912-Review-of-Irelands-Corporation-Tax-Code.pdf|title=REVIEW OF IRELAND'S CORPORATION TAX CODE, PRESENTED TO THE MINISTER FOR FINANCE AND PUBLIC EXPENDITURE AND REFORM|publisher=[[Department of Finance (Ireland)]]|author=Seamus Coffey [[Irish Fiscal Advisory Council]]|date=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed Apple restructured ASI into another Irish [[Corporate haven#IP-based BEPS tools|IP–based BEPS tool]], the [[Double Irish arrangement#CAIA|Capital Allowances for Intangible Assets]] ("CAIA"), in Q1 2015.&lt;ref name="cof2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sb1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cofr"/&gt; 

It is specifically prohibited under Ireland's own corporation tax code (Section 291A(c) of the Irish Taxes and Consolation Act 1997) to use the CAIA BEPS scheme for reasons that are not "commercial bona fide reasons" and in particular for schemes where the main purpose is "... the avoidance of, or reduction in, liability to tax".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.revenue.ie/en/companies-and-charities/reliefs-and-exemptions/capital-allowances-for-intangible-assets/index.aspx|title=Capital allowances for intangible assets|publisher=Irish Revenue | date=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rev1"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Intangible Assets Scheme under Section 291A Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 |url = https://www.revenue.ie/ga/tax-professionals/historic-material/tax-briefing/2010/tax-briefing-issue-09-2010.pdf|publisher=Irish Revenue|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-09/09-02-05.pdf|title=Capital Allowances for Intangible Assets under section 291A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (Part 9 / Chapter2)|publisher=Irish Revenue|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that the CAIA scheme is a deliberate [[Corporate haven#IP-based BEPS tools|IP–based BEPS tool]], it is Ireland tripping over itself trying to maintain OECD-compliance.  

The November 2017 [[Paradise Papers]] leaks revealed that Apple and its lawyers, Applebys, were looking for a replacement for the ASI structure in 2014.  They considered a number of tax havens (especially Jersey).  Some of the disclosed documents leave little doubt as to the key drivers of Apple's decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/world/apple-taxes-jersey.html|author1=Jesse Drucker|author2=Simon Bowers|title=After a Tax Crackdown, Apple Found a New Shelter for Its Profits|publisher=New York Times|date=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41889787|title=BBC Panorama Special Paradise Papers Apple Secret Bolthole Revealed|publisher=BBC News|date=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/apple-paradise-papers-tax-jersey-channel-islands-haven-latest-a8040981.html|title=Apple used Jersey for new tax haven after Ireland crackdown, Paradise Papers reveal|publisher=Independent|date=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brads"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Apple’s Exports Aren’t Missing: They Are in Ireland|url = https://www.cfr.org/blog/apples-exports-arent-missing-they-are-ireland|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|date=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the [[Revenue Commissioners|Irish Revenue]] waived Section 291A(c) for Apple's 2015 restructuring, it could result in a further EU Commission State Aid investigation.

In January 2018, in a series of articles in [[The Sunday Business Post]], Mr Coffey estimated that since the 2015 restructuring, Apple has avoided Irish corporate taxes totalling circa at €2.5–3bn per annum (at the 12.5% rate).&lt;ref name="cof2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businesspost.ie/business/apple-tax-bill-climb-e9bn-firms-dig-407710|title=Apple tax bill could climb by €9bn as firms dig in|publisher=New York Times|date=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mr Coffey calculated the potential second EU Apple State aid fine for the 2015–2018 (inclusive) period, would therefore reach circa €10bn, excluding any interest penalties.&lt;ref name="sb1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businesspost.ie/opinion/e13bn-apple-tax-payment-may-not-end-story-407700|title=Why €13bn Apple tax payment may not be the end of the story|publisher=The Sunday Business Post|date=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sinnfein.ie/contents/47954|title=Apple could owe billions more in tax due to its restructured tax arrangements since 2015 – Pearse Doherty TD|publisher=Sinn Fein|date=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish financial media further noted that the then Finance Minister [[Michael Noonan (Fine Gael politician)|Michael Noonan]], had increased the tax relief threshold for the Irish [[Double Irish arrangement#CAIA|CAIA]] scheme from 80% to 100% in the 2015 budget (i.e. reduce the effective Irish corporate tax rate from 2–3% to 0%).  This was changed back in the subsequent 2017 budget by Finance Minister [[Paschal Donohoe]], however firms which had started their Irish [[Double Irish arrangement#CAIA|CAIA]] scheme in 2015 (like Apple), were allowed to stay at the 100% relief level for the duration of their scheme &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/budget/tax-break-for-ip-transfers-is-cut-to-80pc-36215540.html|title=Tax break for IP transfers is cut to 80pc|publisher=Irish Independent|date=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/cliff-taylor-noonan-and-donohoe-rule-switching-could-cost-1bn-next-year-1.3283383?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fbusiness%2Feconomy%2Fcliff-taylor-noonan-and-donohoe-rule-switching-could-cost-1bn-next-year-1.3283383|title=Change in tax treatment of intellectual property and subsequent and reversal hard to fathom|publisher=Irish Times|date=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which can, under certain conditions, be extended indefinitely.&lt;ref name="ref2"/&gt;

In November 2017, it was reported that the EU Commission had already asked for details on Apple's Irish structure post their January 2015 ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/eu-asks-for-more-details-of-apples-tax-affairs-d5w6qq0g8|title=EU asks for more details of Apple’s tax affairs|publisher=The Times|date=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The April 2017 release of Irish corporation tax returns showed an equivalent "leprechaun economics"–like jump.  It led some to wonder whether Apple decided, given the exposure of its CAIA BEPS tool, and the controversy of "leprechaun economics", to "[[Leprechaun economics#Did Apple still pay tax?|still pay tax in Ireland]]".

After the 29 August 2016 ruling, the EU Commission followed up on the 31 August 2016 to counter statements from the Irish Government that Ireland would have to use the proceeds of any Apple fine to pay down public sector debt (in line with agreed EU budgetary rules), and to clarify that Ireland could allocate the money in whichever way the Irish Government lawfully saw fit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.siliconrepublic.com/companies/eu-tax-apple-ireland-national-debt|title=EU debunks claims about how Ireland can use €13bn Apple tax windfall|publisher=Silicon Republic|date=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regardless however, on the 7 September 2016, the Irish minority Government, with material opposition support,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/fianna-f%C3%A1il-to-vote-for-appeal-on-apple-tax-ruling-1.2780655|title=Fianna Fáil to vote for appeal on Apple tax ruling|publisher=Irish Times|date=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; rejected the EU Commission's ruling on Apple, and the payment of €13 billion, plus penalties, to the Irish State.&lt;ref name="dail"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dail2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/2016/0907/814744-apple/|title=Dail backs plan to appeal Apple ruling|publisher=RTE News|date=7 September 2016|quote=Following a lengthy debate in the recalled Dáil, the vote was passed by 93 votes to 36.

U.S. multinationals dominate Ireland's economy, attracted by Ireland's [[BEPS]] tools, that [[Ireland as a tax haven#Global "knowledge hub" for "selling into Europe"|shield their non–U.S. profits from the historical U.S. "worldwide" corporate tax system]].  In contrast, multinationals from countries with "territorial" tax systems, by far the most common corporate tax system in the world, don't need to use corporate–[[tax havens]] like Ireland, as their foreign income is taxed at much lower rates.&lt;ref name="hines2016"&gt;{{cite journal| url = https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2831&amp;context=articles|title=Multinational Firms and Tax Havens|author1=[[James R.

For example, in 2016–17, U.S.–controlled multinationals in Ireland:

* Directly employed one–quarter of the Irish private sector workforce;&lt;ref name="oecdx"/&gt;

* Created "higher-value" jobs at an average wage of €85k (€17.9 billion wage roll for 210,443 staff) vs. Irish domestic industrial wage of €35k;&lt;ref name="IDA2"/&gt;

* Paid €28.3 billion in 2016 in taxes (€5.5 billion), wages (€17.9 billion on 210,443 staff) and capital spending (€4.9 billion);&lt;ref name="IDA1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.idaireland.com/newsroom/publications/ireland-s-economic-and-competitiveness-update-q1|title=IDA Ireland Competitiveness|publisher=IDA Ireland|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IDA2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.idaireland.com/docs/publications/ida_strategy_final|title=Winning FDI 2015–2019 Strategy|publisher=IDA Ireland|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Paid circa 50 percent of Irish salary taxes (due to higher paying jobs), 50 per cent of Irish VAT, and 92 per cent of Irish customs and excise duties;&lt;br&gt;(this was claimed by a leading Irish tax expert (and Past President of the Irish Tax Institute), but is not fully verifiable)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/multinationals-tax-contribution-ireland-facts-2972139-Sep2016/|title=FactCheck: How much do multinationals actually contribute in taxes?|publisher=thejournal.ie|date=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''fantasy defense''' is where a defendant accused of attempting a crime (enticing [[Minor (law)|minors]] into sexual activity, for example) claims that they never intended to complete the crime. Instead, they claim they were engaged in a fantasy and, in the case of luring a minor, believed they were dealing with an adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferraro|first=Monique Mattei|title=Investigating Child Exploitation and Pornography: The Internet, the Law and Forensic Science|year=2005|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|isbn=978-0-12-163105-5|page=283|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BtjzJhcAAGYC&amp;lpg=PA283&amp;dq=%22Fantasy%20defense%22%20-Android%20-football%20-itunes%20-wikipedia%20-game%20-football&amp;pg=PA283#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author2=Casey, Eoghan|accessdate=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
{{moresources|section|date=August 2017}}
George Frank McLardy was born at 8 Sweden Grove, Waterloo, Lancashire  in 1915, the eldest son of a draper, George McLardy, and his wife Mary (née Wood) McLardy. He had two younger brothers. He attended St Edmund's School, Waterloo and [[St Mary's College, Crosby]], where he was a member of the First XV [[rugby union|rugby]] and [[First XI]] cricket teams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.friendsofstmarys.com/images/stories/files/Decades/30s/SMC_Yearbook_1934.pdf ''St. Mary's College Yearbook, 1934''] pp 15, 35-39&lt;/ref&gt; Academically bright, McLardy progressed into St Mary's College [[Sixth Form]]. 

Upon leaving school in 1934 he studied pharmacy at the [[Liverpool Technical College|Liverpool School of Pharmacy]].&lt;ref&gt;Founded 1849, now part of [[Liverpool John Moores University]]&lt;/ref&gt; McLardy subsequently moved with his family to live in nearby [[Formby]], where he was articled to a [[dispensing chemist|chemist]]. He qualified as a ''Member of the [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain|Pharmaceutical Society]]'' in October 1939.

That same year he joined the [[British Union of Fascists]] (BUF), becoming first district treasurer, then district leader in Waterloo. McLardy sold the BUF magazine ''Action'' around [[Crosby, Merseyside|Crosby]] and Waterloo, and held his BUF meetings in a local public house, ''The Crosby Hotel''. The intelligence service [[MI5]] began monitoring his activities in July 1937.

==World War II==
{{unsourced|section|date=August 2017}}
On the outbreak of World War II, McLardy volunteered for the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]]. He was posted to [[Aldershot]], and owing to his qualifications, was promoted to the rank of [[sergeant]]. On 9 May 1940, he landed in France with the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]]. After pushing as far north as [[Brussels]], his unit was beaten back by the Germans towards [[Battle of Dunkirk|Dunkirk]].{{cn|date=August 2017}}

McLardy was captured near [[Wormhoudt]] on 31 May 1940. It was suspected that he deliberately became separated from his unit to be captured. He was sent first to [[Stalag XX-A]] at [[Toruń|Thorn]], and soon on to [[Stalag XXI-A]] at [[Ostrzeszów|Schildberg]] (both in [[Poland]]). For three years McLardy remained in Schildberg as an ordinary [[prisoner of war]], performing medical duties for his fellow prisoners in the camp hospital. 

Around this time McLardy began complaining of "heart trouble" and "ear problems." He hoped for [[repatriation]] to the UK. His hopes were dashed in September 1943, however, when he was told that instead he would be moving to [[Stalag XXI-D]] at [[Poznań|Posen]], reputedly the worst camp in Poland.

===Collaboration===
{{unsourced|section|date=August 2017}}
McLardy claimed that he "would not survive another Polish winter", and recalled a conversation with a "Dutch officer" in Stalag XXI-A who stated that he had applied to join the [[Waffen-SS]] with a view to ultimately escape. McLardy approached a surprised [[Abwehr]] officer at Schildberg with the request that he might join the Waffen-SS. His application, written in his own hand in English was translated into German, then typed and forwarded to Berlin. 

It stated ''"I hereby apply to offer my services to Germany in the common struggle against Bolshevism and I express my willingness to serve as a soldier against Soviet Russia."'' Frank McLardy thus became the first British POW of World War II to volunteer to join the German armed forces. A reply was received three weeks later when an Abwehr guard arrived at the camp to escort him to Berlin.

===British Free Corps===
{{unsourced|section|date=August 2017}}
[[File:BFCgroup.jpg|thumb|right|Two early members of the BFC, ''[[SS-Mann]]'' Kenneth Berry and ''[[Sturmmann]]'' Alfred Minchin, with German officers, April 1944]]
McLardy was taken first to Stalag IIID/517S at [[Ludwigsfelde|Genshagen]], south of Berlin. This was a "holiday" or Propaganda Camp established by the Germans in early 1943. Batches of prisoners from other camps were regularly sent there and offered special privileges in an attempt to undermine their loyalty.

A recurring dream of Hitler's was the propaganda value of a battalion of British POWs who might be persuaded to go into battle against the Russians. An early attempt at recruitment had ended in abject failure. The ''Legion of St George'' had been the brainchild of [[John Amery]]. He toured the internment camps of France, distributing leaflets entitled ''"Why die for Stalin? Why die for the Jews?"'' 

His only recruit was [[Kenneth Berry (British Free Corps)|Kenneth Berry]], a 17-year-old deckhand from a sunken ammunition ship, and Amery was soon sidelined by the Germans. But a group of men at Stalag IIID now caught the Germans' eye as the potential nucleus for another attempt to form such a foreign legion. Soon to be known as the "Big Six", they were [[William Brittain (British Free Corps)|William Brittain]], New Zealander [[Roy Courlander]], Canadian [[Edwin Barnard Martin]], Seaman [[Alfred Minchin]] and McLardy.

These men were packed off to a requisitioned bierkeller in [[Pankow]], Berlin and placed under the tutelage of Thomas Haller Cooper, a half-German who had already served in the SS ''Totenkopf'' and [[SS Polizei Division]] and boasted of committing atrocities against Jews and Russian POWs in Poland. The group decided among themselves to change the name of the ''Legion'' to the ''[[British Free Corps]]'' and soon set about designing uniforms and recruitment leaflets.

McLardy was given the rank of ''SS-[[Unterscharführer]]'', and put in charge of propaganda. Most members of the BFC changed their names on enlistment, and McLardy went under his mother's surname of ''Wood''.  He regularly travelled to prisoner of war camps, dressed as a civilian, dropping off leaflets and interviewing likely recruits, claiming that there were two full [[Division (military)|divisions]] of the BFC – one, led by British officers, supposedly already fighting the Russians with the approval of the British government.

In expectation of a surge of recruits, in February 1944 the BFC were moved to an SS barracks at [[Hildesheim]], a former monastery converted into the ''SS Nordic Study Centre''. The optimistic Germans had 800 Waffen-SS uniforms made, sporting a collar patch with three lions, and a union jack shield on the sleeve together with a "British Free Corps" armband in Gothic script.

Recruits, many realising they had been duped, were subjected to lectures from McLardy on Economics, Bolshevism and the German language, and forced to give Nazi salutes to McLardy and the other ringleaders of the BFC. He would later be described by them as ''"capable and intelligent"'', a ''"fanatical fascist"'', who ''"hoped for a fascist England"'', but ''"a physical and moral coward"'', ''"very anti-Jewish and anti-Russian"'', ''"a very learned man of high education"'', ''"reserved"'', but who when aroused ''"would talk for hours on National Socialism."''

Some members of the BFC stayed in it merely for an easy time, the beer and the chance to fraternise with local women. Others attempted to sabotage it, or demanded to be sent back to their POW camps. A schism developed in April 1944, when a group took exception to McLardy's increasingly pro-Nazi, anti-British harangues, and fisticuffs ensued. Thereafter McLardy, Courlander and Co. slept in a separate room, under pictures of Hitler, Himmler and the Nazi flag, while newer recruits occupied a room in which a picture of the [[Edward VIII|Duke of Windsor]] had pride of place.

On Hitler's birthday, 20 April 1944, the BFC paraded in full uniform for the first time. The Corps continued to be riven by intrigue with Cooper, McLardy and Courlander all jockeying for control, at odds among themselves and with their German masters. Fewer than 60 men ever joined the BFC and its strength never rose above 27, three below the number Hitler had stipulated as the minimum for it to go into battle. By August 1944, McLardy, realising the British Free Corps was a failure, decided to abandon it and volunteered for the Waffen-SS ''[[Sanitätswesen (Nazi camp)|Sanitätswesen]]'' (Medical Corps).

===Waffen-SS===
{{unsourced|section|date=August 2017}}
He was posted to the SS medical supply depot at [[Lichtenberg]], and in his own words ''"wore an ordinary SS uniform and lived the life of a German soldier."'' Towards the end of 1944, McLardy was selected for officer training. He was sent first to [[Graz]], then to [[Stettin]] to commence his training. He realised the end of the war was near, and had no intention of becoming part of a last-ditch effort of the SS to defend the Third Reich. On reporting to Stettin in January 1945 he reported sick and was excused duties, and allowed to return to Berlin.

McLardy went to the [[RSHA|SS Head Office]] and was offered work at the ''[[Rundfunkhaus]]'' and with the ''[[SS-Standarte Kurt Eggers]].'' Desiring neither, he managed to dupe the SS into granting him leave, thinking he had accepted both. McLardy donned civilian clothes and went to ground in Berlin, living at ''33 Sächsische Strasse'', while he plotted his escape from the crumbling capital.

In early April he learned that the Propaganda Ministry's ''[[Büro Concordia]]'' was abandoning Berlin for [[Helmstedt]], and persuaded them to take him along. He declined the job of broadcaster, but instead offered to "monitor" Allied broadcasts. McLardy left Berlin on 10 April 1945. By the time they reached Helmstedt the Reich was falling apart, and after a week McLardy told his associates he was heading for [[Hamburg]].

Instead, he posed as a Belgian, and after hiding on a farm at [[Döhren]] for two days, surrendered to the arriving Americans. He was handed into British custody on 19 April 1945 and repatriated to the UK on 13 May 1945.

==Postwar==
{{moresources|section|date=August 2017}}
McLardy was charged with ''voluntarily aiding the enemy whilst a prisoner of war''. He was court-martialled at Blacon Camp, near [[Chester]] and sentenced to life imprisonment on 1 January 1946.&lt;ref&gt;[http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=qubelfast&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=&amp;docId=CS35471934&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0 "Life Sentence For Aiding Enemy"], ''Times'', London, 30 January 1946: pg. 2 via Times Digital Archive; accessed 20 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[MI5|Security Service]] files on him are held by the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]] under references [http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C10907220 KV 2/251] and [http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C10907221 KV 2/252]. The sentence was later commuted to 15 years, of which McLardy served seven. McLardy received the heaviest sentence of those convicted of membership of the ''British Free Corps''. He served his sentence first at [[HM Prison Parkhurst]], then in open prisons.  During his imprisonment McLardy studied for an external degree in chemistry from [[Cambridge University]]. 

==Last years==
Upon his release in 1953, he emigrated to Germany, married a German woman and had two sons.{{cn|date=August 2017}} He worked as a pharmacist and died in 1981 at [[Ingelheim am Rhein]], near [[Mainz]], aged 66.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

==In popular culture==
The British Free Corps is featured in [[Jack Higgins]]' World War II thriller ''[[The Eagle Has Landed (novel)|The Eagle Has Landed]]''. In 2010, an episode of ''[[Foyle's War Series Seven#.22The Hide.22|Foyle's War]]'' concerned a member of the BFC put on trial for treason after the war.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

A '''general incorporation law''' allows [[corporation]]s to be formed without a [[charter]] from the [[legislature]]. It also refers to a law enabling a certain type of corporation, such as a [[railroad]], to exercise [[eminent domain]] and other special rights without a charter from the legislature.

* [[North Carolina]], 1795 
* [[Massachusetts]], 1799
* [[New York (state)|New York]], 1811: [[Act Relative to Incorporations for Manufacturing Purposes of 1811]]
* [[Connecticut]] in 1837.

===Railroads===

*[[New Jersey]]: April 2, 1873 (breaking the [[Camden and Amboy Rail Road]]'s monopoly and allowing for the [[National Railway]] project)

== United Kingdom ==
The UK required a legislative charter for incorporation until passage of the [[Joint Stock Companies Act 1844]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2217">{{Politics of Ghana}}

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[Ghana]] on 31 January 1964. The proposed amendments to the constitution would turn the country into a [[one-party state]] and increase the powers of [[Head of state of Ghana|President]] [[Kwame Nkrumah]]. With results showing that an implausible 99.91% of voters supported the amendments, the referendum was accused of being "obviously rigged".&lt;ref&gt;Seth Anthony (1969) "The State of Ghana", ''African Affairs'' Vol. 68, No. 273, pp337–339&lt;/ref&gt; Voter turnout was reported to be 96.5%.&lt;ref name="HronikaBelgrade"&gt;Milutin Tomanović (1965) ''Hronika međunarodnih događaja 1964'', [[Institute of International Politics and Economics]], p240 (in [[Serbo-Croatian]])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Following the successful passage of the constitutional amendments, the country became a one-party state with the [[Convention People's Party]] as the sole legal party (though the country had essentially been a one-party state since independence in 1957). Nkrumah became [[president for life]] of both nation and party, with greatly expanded powers; he could now remove members of the [[Supreme Court of Ghana|Supreme Court]] at his discretion. In effect, the amendments transformed Nkrumah's regime into a legal dictatorship. Elections were scheduled to be held under this system in 1965, but were cancelled shortly beforehand, with Nkrumah appointing MPs instead. However, Nkrumah was overthrown in a [[National Liberation Council|coup in February 1966]], the CPP was dissolved, and the constitution suspended. Multi-party politics was restored by the time of the [[Ghanaian parliamentary election, 1969|next elections]] in 1969.

'''Goldsmith Collins''' (16 September 1901 – 27 April 1982)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://australianfootball.com/players/player/goldie%2Bcollins/3992|title=Goldie Collins - Player Bio|publisher=Australian Football|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Australian rules football]]er who played with [[Fitzroy Football Club|Fitzroy]] in the [[Australian Football League|VFL]]. 

He made his debut with Fitzroy in 1922 and the following season was the club's [[Fitzroy FC honour roll|best and fairest]]. His brothers, [[Harry Collins (footballer)|Harry]] and [[Norm Collins|Norm]] both played for Fitzroy.

==Propensity to violence==
Collins was a controversial character who was suspended for nearly two seasons for striking.

==Clashes with the law==
===Vexatious litigant===
On 27 March 1953, on the basis of his having "instituted 40 litigations in the last five years", Collins was declared a [[vexatious litigant]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/2878538 Vexatious Litigant, ''The Canberra Times'', (Saturday, 28 March 1953), p.4.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.smh.com.au/national/meet-the-vexatious-litigants-20080927-4pdy.html Munro, P. (2008) "Meet the Vexatious Litigants", ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 28 September 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contempt of court===
Later that year, was jailed for four months, by the Supreme Court, for [[contempt of court]], when he assaulted a detective who was attempting "to take him into custody to serve a term of one month imposed for an earlier contempt in writing insulting letters to judges of the court".&lt;ref&gt;[https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/206465550 Four Months for Contempt, ''The Age'', (Wednesday, 21 December 1953), p.3.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Violent behaviour===
In April 1954, already in Pentridge Gaol, serving the earlier sentence, and, once again, charged with contempt of court, he put on an extraordinary display, shouting insults at the judge, etc., that the judge collapsed. Once the judge had recovered enough to be removed from the court, the Chief Justice, [[Edmund Herring|Sir Edmund Herring]], was called to the court. Herring adjourned the hearing indefinitely and ordered that Collins be returned to Pentridge. Collins, then, "fought violently with two warders and a court policeman and was hand cuffed by Detective-Sergeant W. W. Mooney, who had joined in to help them".&lt;ref&gt;[https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/205709528 Noisy Court Scene, ''The Age'', (Wednesday, 14 April 1954), p.4.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/26603129 Accused called "rudest man": Judge collapses as ex-ruckman attacks Bench, ''The Argus'', (Wednesday, 14 April 1954), p.6;] [https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/96271273 Judge Collapsed in Court under Deft's.

O Centro Espírita Beneficente União do Vegetal|volume=546|page=418|pin=|year=2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court held that, under the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]], the government had failed to show a compelling interest in prosecuting religious adherents for drinking a sacramental tea containing a [[Schedule I controlled substance]].  After the federal government seized its sacramental tea, the [[União do Vegetal]] (UDV), the [[New Mexico|New Mexican]] branch of a Brazilian church that imbibes [[ayahuasca]] in its services, sued, claiming the seizure was illegal, and sought to ensure future importation of the tea for religious use. The church won a preliminary injunction from the [[United States District Court for the District of New Mexico]], which was affirmed on appeal.

The Supreme Court affirmed. The Court also disagreed with the government's central argument that the uniform application of the [[Controlled Substances Act]] (CSA) does not allow for exceptions for the substance in this case, as [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] are given exceptions to use [[peyote]], another Schedule I substance.

== Background ==
On May 21, 1999, [[United States Customs Service|U. S. Customs]] agents seized over {{convert|30|usgal|L|abbr=off|sp=us}} of ''hoasca'' ([[ayahuasca]]) tea which was shipped to the [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] branch of the [[Brazil]]-based UDV; ayahuasca contains [[dimethyltryptamine]], which is outlawed for most purposes under the [[Controlled Substances Act]]. While no charges were filed, the United States chapter, led by [[Seagram]] heir [[Bronfman family|Jeffrey Bronfman]], filed suit claiming that the seizure was an illegal violation of the church members' rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Toobin|first1=Jeffrey|authorlink1=Jeffrey Toobin|title=High Tea|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/12/20/high-tea|accessdate=16 October 2017|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=13 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; They claimed their usage was permitted under the 1993 [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]] (RFRA), {{USC|42|2000bb}}, a law passed by Congress in direct response to ''[[Employment Division v. Smith]]'' (1990), in which the Supreme Court held that unemployment benefits could be denied to two Native Americans fired for using [[Peyote]].

In filing suit, the UDV sought a [[preliminary injunction]] preventing the federal government from barring their usage of hoasca.  In August 2002, U.S. District Chief Judge [[James Aubrey Parker]] granted the church's motion, finding it was likely to succeed on the merits of its claim under RFRA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=O Centro Espirita Beneficiente União do Vegetal v.

In September 2003, [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit]] Senior Judge [[John Carbone Porfilio]], joined by Judge [[Stephanie Kulp Seymour]], affirmed, over the dissent of Judge [[Michael R. Murphy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=O Centro Espirita Beneficiente União do Vegetal v.

Judge Seymour, joined by Judges [[Deanell Reece Tacha]], Porfilio, [[Robert Harlan Henry]], [[Mary Beck Briscoe]], and [[Carlos F.

McConnell]], joined in full by Judge [[Timothy Tymkovich]], argued that the district court used the correct standard to reach the correct result, and partially joined those parts of the other opinions that said so.

As it worked its way through the appellate courts, the Supreme Court lifted a stay in December 2004 thereby permitting the church to use hoasca for their Christmas services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Church Gets High Tea for Christmas|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/dec/11/nation/na-tea11|accessdate=16 October 2017|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=11 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One-hour of oral arguments were heard on November 1, 2005, where [[Edwin Kneedler]], the Deputy [[Solicitor General of the United States]], appeared for the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Greenhouse|first1=Linda|authorlink1=Linda Greenhouse|title=Justices Weighing Narcotics Policy Against Needs of a Church|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/02/us/justices-weighing-narcotics-policy-against-needs-of-a-church.html|accessdate=16 October 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gonzales v.

== Opinion of the Court ==
On February 21, 2006, the Supreme Court unanimously delivered judgment in favor of the church, affirming and remanding to the lower court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Greenhouse|first1=Linda|authorlink1=Linda Greenhouse|title=Sect Allowed to Import Its Hallucinogenic Tea|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/22/politics/sect-allowed-to-import-its-hallucinogenic-tea.html|accessdate=16 October 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=22 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chief Justice [[John Roberts]] wrote the opinion for a unanimous Court of eight justices.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last= |first= | title=The Supreme Court, 2005 Term — Leading Cases | volume=120 | journal=[[Harv. L. Rev.]] | page=341 | pin= | url=https://harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/gonzales_v_ocentroespirita_beneficiente.pdf | year=2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Justice [[Samuel Alito]] took no part in the consideration or decision of the case because he was not on the Court when the case was argued. The Court found that the government was unable to detail the government's [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment#Compelling interest|compelling interest]] in barring religious usage of Hoasca when applying [[strict scrutiny]] as required by the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]] (RFRA).

The Court first found that the standard under RFRA for a preliminary injunction is the same as at trial, just as it would be for a constitutional claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bluebook journal | first=Matthew | last=Nicholson | title=Note, Is O Centro a Sign of Hope for RFRA Claimants? | volume=95 | journal=[[Va. L. Rev.]] | page=1281 | pin= | url=http://www.virginialawreview.org/sites/virginialawreview.org/files/1281-2.pdf | year=2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Disagreeing with the District Court, the Supreme Court found that Hoasca is covered under the 1971 [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances|United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances]], which is implemented by the [[Controlled Substances Act]] (CSA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Bluebook journal | first=Richard W. | last=Garnett | | first2=Joshua D. |last2=Dunlap |title=Taking Accommodation Seriously: Religious Freedom and the O Centro Case | volume=2005–2006 | journal=Cato Sup. Ct. Rev. | page=159 | pin= | url=https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/supreme-court-review/2006/9/dunlap.pdf | year=2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court rejected the District Court's reliance on the official commentary to the convention, reasoning that the [[United Nations]] had incorrectly interpreted the treaty when it found that tea made from plants is a naturally occurring material.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7036734975431570669&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006 ''Gonzales v. O Centro Espírita Beneficente União do Vegetal''], 546 U.S. 418, 437 (2006) citing U. N. Commentary on the Convention on Psychotropic Substances 387, 385 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt;  However, because the government had failed to submit any evidence on the international consequences of granting an exemption to CSA enforcement by allowing UDV to practice its religion, the Court ruled that it had failed to meet its burden on this point. The Supreme Court ruled that the government failed to demonstrate a compelling interest in applying the Controlled Substances Act to the UDV's sacramental use of the tea.

The ruling upheld a preliminary injunction allowing the church to use the tea pending a lower court trial on a permanent injunction, during which the government would have had the opportunity to present further evidence consistent with the Supreme Court's ruling.

== Subsequent developments ==
The ruling is not binding on states. The Act was amended in 2003 to only include the federal government and its entities, such as Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Winnifred. 2005. The impossibility of religious freedom. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0-691-11801-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of states have passed [[State Religious Freedom Restoration Acts|their own version of the RFRA]], but the ''[[Employment Division v. Smith|Smith]]'' case remains the authority in these matters in many states.&lt;ref&gt;Canby, William C. Jr. (2004). American Indian Law. P. 344. West Publishing Co. St. Paul. {{ISBN|0-314-14640-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bronfman next sought to move the church's services from the [[yurt]] outside his home to a new building in [[Arroyo Hondo, New Mexico]], promoting opposition from neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Verma|first1=Sonia|title=Bronfman scion's temple plans aren't U.S. town's cup of tea|url=https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/bronfman-scions-temple-plans-arent-us-towns-cup-of-tea/article1215451/?ref=https://www.theglobeandmail.com&amp;|accessdate=16 October 2017|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=14 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the county refused to grant the church a building permit, Bronfman sued under the [[Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act]], and Assistant 
Attorney General [[Tom Perez]] of the [[United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division]] filed a statement of interest in support of the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=City And Town Engaged In Systematic Religious Discrimination, Suit Alleges|url=https://www.justice.gov/crt/city-and-town-engaged-systematic-religious-discrimination-suit-alleges#5|accessdate=16 October 2017|work=Religious Freedom in Focus|agency=[[United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division]]|issue=52|date=June 2012|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In late 2012, a settlement was reached in which the county agreed to allow the church to be built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burnett|first1=John|title=Controversy Brews Over Church's Hallucinogenic Tea Ritual|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/04/25/177315132/controversy-brews-over-churchs-hallucinogenic-tea-ritual|accessdate=16 October 2017|work=[[All Things Considered]]|agency=[[NPR]]|date=25 April 2013|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7584">[[File:Heliotrop Freiburg.jpg|thumb|300px|Heliotrope in [[Freiburg]]]]The '''Heliotrope''' is an [[environmentally friendly]] house designed by the German architect [[Rolf Disch]] who also designed the [[Sonnenschiff (Solar Ship)|Sonnenschiff (Sun Ship)]]. Three such houses exist in Germany, the first experimental version having been built in 1994 as the architect's home in [[Freiburg im Breisgau]], while the other two are used as exhibition buildings for the [[Hansgrohe]] company in [[Offenburg]] and a dentist's lab in Hilpoltstein in [[Bavaria]]. The '''Heliotrope''' in [[Freiburg]] was the first building in the world to capture more energy than it uses, all of which is entirely renewable, emissions free and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; neutral. The structure physically rotates to track the sun, which allows it to harness the maximum natural sunlight and warmth possible. Several different energy generation modules are used in the building including a {{convert|603|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} [[solar tracker|dual-axis solar photovoltaic tracking panel]], a [[geothermal heat pump|geothermal heat exchanger]], a [[cogeneration|combined heat and power unit (CHP)]] and [[solar thermal energy|solar-thermal]] balcony railings to provide heat and warm water. These innovations in combination with the superior insulation of the residence allow the Heliotrope to capture anywhere between four and six times its energy usage depending on the time of year. The Heliotrope is also fitted with a [[greywater|grey-water cleansing system]] and built-in natural waste composting.

At the same time that Freiburg’s Heliotrope was built, [[Hansgrohe]] contracted [[Rolf Disch Solar Architecture]] to design and build another Heliotrope to be used as a visitor’s center and showroom in [[Offenburg]], Germany. A third Heliotrope was then contracted and built in [[Hilpoltstein]], [[Bavaria]] to be used as a technical dental laboratory. Disch’s unique design accommodates different utilization from private residences to laboratories, and nevertheless maintains the structure’s positive energy balance.
In addition to the original Heliotrope design, Rolf Disch has drawn plans for larger versions of the project to be built as a rotating hotel, which gives every guest a beautiful view, as well as administrative buildings and even an exhibition pavilion for the [[EXPO 2010]] in [[Shanghai]].

==PlusEnergy==
[[PlusEnergy]] is a coined concept developed by Rolf Disch that indicates a structure’s extreme energy efficiency so that it holds a positive energy balance, actually obtaining more energy than it uses. With the completion of his private residence, the Heliotrope, in 1994, Disch had created the first PlusEnergy house in the world. The sheer logic of a home that captures more energy than it consumes made perfect sense to Disch. His next goal in its development was thus the mass application of the concept to residential, commercial and retail space. As the concept further developed and gained financial backing as well, Disch built several more projects with PlusEnergy certifications.  PlusEnergy is a simple concept that has been materialized in a technical design. “PlusEnergy is a fundamental environmental imperative,” Disch claims.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rolfdisch.de&lt;/ref&gt; Disch believes that passive building isn’t enough because passive homes still emit CO2 into the atmosphere.

==Environment and energy needs==
The house is designed to face the sun with its triple-pane windows (U = 0.5) during the heating months of the year and turn its highly insulated back (U = 0.12) to the sun during the warmer months when heating isn't necessary. This significantly reduces heating and cooling requirements for the building throughout the year which are provided for by a heat pump, while hot water is provided by vacuum-tube solar panels.

Photovoltaic solar panels with a rated power of 6.6&amp;nbsp;kW on its roof provide five to six times more energy than the building uses, making the building energy positive ([[PlusEnergy]]). To further improve energy capture, the panels also rotate independently from the building to follow the sun, while being able to adapt its orientation in case of strong winds.

==Water usage and natural waste management==
In order to limit water usage, a gray water circuit (for washing dishes and clothes) is used. It also collects rainwater. Waste water is purified in a vegetated cascade pond outside of the edifice.

Natural waste and excrement are dry composted in the structure as well.

==Inhabitant comfort==
One of the main attractions of the house, apart from its low energy needs is its rotating view. As the building turns according to the sun's position, the view changes creating a spectacular view. This feature was later developed into a rotating hotel concept.

The roof deck includes a sun and viewing deck, as well as a garden terrace. The solar panels can be used for sun or rain protection while on the roof terrace.

All floors are accessible from the spiral staircase reducing surface loss through hallways and corridors.

==Further potential==
Further potential for this building design includes plans that were drawn up for a possible Heliotrope Hotel. This project currently has no customers but was designed to show that the revolving design can easily be scaled up. The plans for a rotating hotel have surfaced on several occasions although the financing has not yet been available for its actualization.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1792">'''Home Detention Curfew''' is a [[Detention (imprisonment)|detention]] scheme in the [[United Kingdom]] whereby certain short-term [[criminals]] are released from [[prison]] several weeks to months before the completion of their [[prison sentence|sentence]] to allow them to integrate back into [[society]]. The scheme is used for prisoners who are sentenced to terms greater than three months. Long term prisoners (these serving a sentence of more than four years but excluding life sentence prisoners) cannot be considered for release on the scheme. HDC is not typically applied to [[sex offender]]s or [[violent crime|violent criminals]] sentenced under the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]]. Prisoners are assessed for risk prior to being released under this scheme and fitted with an [[Electronic tagging|electronic monitoring tag]] to ensure that they do not violate the terms of their [[curfew]]. Typically, such prisoners are required to remain in their designated home between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m.

'''''A Hundred Thousand Billion Poems''''' or '''''One hundred million million poems''''' (original French title: ''Cent mille milliards de poèmes'') is a book by [[Raymond Queneau]], published in 1961. The book is a set of ten [[sonnet]]s printed on card with each line on a separate strip.  As all ten sonnets have not just the same [[rhyme scheme]] but the same rhyme sounds, any lines from a sonnet can be combined with any from the nine others, allowing for 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; (= 100,000,000,000,000) different poems. When Queneau ran into trouble creating the book, he solicited the help of [[mathematician]] [[Francois Le Lionnais]], and in the process they initiated [[Oulipo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spinelessbooks.com/20/essays/oulipo.html |title=Spineless Books |publisher=Spineless Books |date= |accessdate=2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original French version of the book was designed by [[Robert Massin]]. Two full translations into English have been published, those by John Crombie and [[Stanley Chapman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://x42.com/active/queneau.html |title=Cent mille milliards de počmes |publisher=X42.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beverley Charles Rowe's translation, one that uses the same rhyme sounds, has been published online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bevrowe.info/Queneau/QueneauHome_v2.html |title=Queneau Home |publisher=Bevrowe.info |date= |accessdate=2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, Edition Zweitausendeins in Frankfurt a.M. published a German translation by Ludwig Harig.

In 1997, a French court decision outlawed the publication of the original poem on the Internet, citing the Queneau estate and [[Gallimard]] publishing house's exclusive [[moral rights (copyright law)|moral right]].&lt;ref name=Libera&gt;Luce Libera, [http://multitudes.samizdat.net/spip.php?article169 12 268 millions de poèmes et quelques...

{{UStaxation}}
In [[Income tax in the United States|United States income tax law]], an '''installment sale''' is generally a "disposition of property where at least 1 loan payment is to be received after the close of the taxable year in which the disposition occurs."&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|26|453(b)(1)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "installment sale" does not include, however, a "dealer disposition" (as defined in the statute) or, generally, a sale of inventory.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|26|453(b)(2)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The installment method of accounting provides an exception to the general principles of income recognition by allowing a taxpayer to defer the inclusion of income of amounts that are to be received from the disposition of certain types of property until payment in cash or cash equivalents is received.&lt;ref&gt;Overview of Issues Relating to the Modification of the Installment Sales Rules by the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999, Joint Committee on Taxation (JCX-15-00), Feb. 28, 2000 (as cited in Samuel A. Donaldson, Federal Income Taxation of Individuals: Cases, Problems &amp; Materials. 2nd edition. American Casebook Series, Thomson West: St. Paul, Minnesota, 2007, 580.&lt;/ref&gt;  The installment method defers the recognition of income when compared with both the cash and accrual methods of accounting.  Under the cash method, the taxpayer would recognize the income when it is received, including the entire sum paid in the form of a negotiable note.&lt;ref name="Taxation 2007"&gt;Overview of Issues Relating to the Modification of the Installment Sales Rules by the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999, Joint Committee on Taxation (JCX-15-00), Feb. 28, 2000 (as cited in Samuel A. Donaldson, Federal Income Taxation of Individuals: Cases, Problems &amp; Materials. 2nd edition. American Casebook Series, Thomson West: St. Paul, Minnesota, 2007, 581.&lt;/ref&gt;  The deferral advantages of the installment method are the most pronounced when comparing to the accrual method, under which a taxpayer must recognize income as soon as he or she has a right to the income.&lt;ref name="Taxation 2007"/&gt;

==Process==
If a taxpayer realizes ''income'' (e.g., gain) from an installment sale, the income generally may be reported by the taxpayer under the "installment method."&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|26|453(a)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The "installment method" is defined as "a method under which the income recognized for any taxable year [ . . . ] is that proportion of the payments received in that year which the gross profit [ . . . ] bears to the total contract price."&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|26|453(c)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that if a taxpayer sells real estate with a basis of $250,000 for $1,000,000 resulting in 75% total profit then the taxpayer should claim 75% of the total principal payments received during the taxable year as gross income.  The interest on the note is included in gross income by the taxpayer according to the taxpayer's usual method of accounting.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel A. Donaldson, Federal Income Taxation of Individuals: Cases, Problems &amp; Materials. 2nd edition. American Casebook Series, Thomson West: St. Paul, Minnesota, 2007, 581.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nothing in the language of the governing statute (section 453 of the Internal Revenue Code) requires the use of the installment method where the disposition results in a loss. If the taxpayer disposes of property in an installment sale, he or she reports a portion of the gain at the time of receipt of each installment payment. Income from an installment sale is generally reported on [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] Form 6252, Installment Sale Income, to be included in the taxpayer's Federal income tax return for each year in which a payment is received.

Taxpayers may elect out of the installment method and report the entire gain in the year of disposition, even though at least one payment will not have been received by the close of that year)&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|26|453(d)(1)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; by making the election on a timely filed income tax return for the tax year in which the disposition occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|26|453(d)(2)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note that "contract price" does not necessarily mean the dollar amount agreed to by contract.  Instead, Treasury Regulation Sec. 15A.453-1(b)(2)(iii) defines contract price as "the total contract price equal to selling price reduced by that portion of any qualifying indebtedness...assumed or taken subject to by the buyer, which does not exceed the seller's basis in the property (adjusted, for installment sales in taxable years ending after October 19, 1980, to reflect commissions and other selling expenses as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section)."  Qualifying indebtedness is further defined as a "mortgage or other indebtedness encumbering the property and indebtedness, not secured by the property but incurred or assumed by the purchaser incident to the purchaser's acquisition, holding, or operation in the ordinary course of business or investment, of the property."  Qualifying indebtedness specifically excludes any debts that are incident to the disposition of the property, such as legal fees incurred during the sale, or debts that are not functionally related to the taxpayer's holding of the property.&lt;ref&gt;Treas. Reg Sec. 15A.453-1(b)(2)(iv)&lt;/ref&gt;  This method of calculating contract price allows the installment method to more accurately account for the taxpayer's basis in the property.

==Electing Out and Contingent Payments==

One of the primary reasons that sellers elect out of the installment method is the harsh treatment of contingencies in the regulations accompanying IRC 453. Contingent payments are common in some types of installment sales, where, for example, payments are based on the actual rather than the expected profitability of the item sold (typically some percentage of the future profits). Where the contract calls for contingent payments, the regulations recognize three possibilities.

First, the contingent payments may be subject to a stated maximum selling price, e.g., "5% of future profits up to a maximum of $1,000,000." In this case, the regulations require the seller to calculate the profit ratio by assuming that the maximum will actually be reached. As compared to a situation where the maximum in fact is not reached, this requirement has the effect of increasing the profit ratio and thus the gain reportable for each year, deferring recovery of basis. Any deficiency between the actual amounts received and the stated maximum selling price will result in unrecovered basis, for which no loss may be reported until there is no more right to future payments.

Second, if there is no maximum selling price, the contingent payments may be subject to a finite duration, e.g., "5% of future profits for ten years." In this case, the regulations require the basis to be apportioned ratably over the years in which payment can be received. Basis that is not used in one year is carried over to the next year. Especially if the item sold declines in profitability over the stated finite duration, it is possible that there will be unrecovered basis at the end of the period, for which no loss may be reported until that final year.

Finally, there may be neither a maximum selling price nor a finite duration. In this case, the first step is to consider whether there is a sale at all; the transaction may in fact be for rent or royalties, since beneficial ownership arguably remains with the seller. However, if there is in fact a sale, there are two possibilities. First, the transaction may be subject to the judicial "open transaction doctrine" of Burnet v. Logan. Almost no sales are subject to this doctrine because it is applicable only to unusual and rare sales that are wholly speculative and impossible to value. If the open transaction doctrine applies, the taxpayer may completely recover basis before reporting any gain. This is by far the best tax treatment for the transaction, but it is likely to be attacked by the IRS and in most circumstances would not be sustained.

More likely, a contingent sale in the third category would be a closed transaction. This is the worst-case scenario. In this case, basis is allocated ratably over a fifteen-year period, but unused basis is not simply carried forward into the next year; instead unused basis is re-allocated over the balance of the 15-year term. No loss may be reported until the final year.

In all three of these scenarios, there is the possibility that there will be unrecovered basis on the back end of the transaction resulting in a capital loss. If, for example, the seller is an individual who is retiring off of the proceeds of the sale, the capital loss on the back end would be almost worthless (except to the nominal extent usable against ordinary income).

The alternative is to elect out of the installment method. In that case, the seller reports the fixed amounts (taking [[original issue discount]] into account for future fixed payments) ''plus'' the fair market value of the right to contingent payments. The taxpayer pays tax up front in the year of the sale on this total amount realized. The taxpayer ''then'' has a basis in the right to contingent payments equal to the amount reported as fair market value. The good news here is that the seller gets a little piece of the open transaction doctrine, and may fully recover basis in the contingent piece of the sale before reporting any additional contingent payments in future years. Where the profit ratio would have been high anyway and the fair market value of the contingent payments are low, the taxpayer may experience favorable consequences by effectively paying a little more tax up front and in return getting the first crop of contingent payments tax-free, while eliminating the risk of an unusable future capital loss.

Whether or not the seller elects out, the total net gain or loss reported will be the same, but timing and characterization can vary widely.

==Treatment of Escrowed Consideration==
If, instead of a note, consideration is held back in an escrow account, installment reporting may be available if the escrow imposes a "substantial restriction" and is arranged to "serve a bona fide interest of the buyer." For example, if the escrow secures representations and warranties of the seller, installment reporting is available to report payments as they are released from escrow. In contrast, if amounts are released from escrow with the mere passage of time, installment reporting is not available.

Whether, in a merger or acquisition, escrows established to secure the continued employment of selling shareholders who are also management employees (so-called "[[golden handcuffs]]") are reportable on the installment method is currently an unresolved question, even if it is assumed that such amounts are properly treated as merger consideration and not compensation for employment. On the one hand, such conditions are clearly established for the benefit of the buyer. On the other, amounts in escrow appear to be released with the passage of time in a manner that is within the control of the seller, and so arguably the escrow does not impose a "substantial" restriction.

==Impact==
Installment sales are a valuable tool to help sellers defer tax. As with any other [[seller financing]], however, the seller is generally at risk with respect to the buyer's creditworthiness or ability to manage the asset. The seller may often retain a [[lien]] against the property to secure payment of the installment obligation, which itself may or may not be evidenced by a [[promissory note]].

The installment sale allows buyers to obtain an asset such as real estate without bank financing. The seller is then at risk of buyer default and the consequential repossession/foreclosure of the asset.

==Alternatives==
A sales method called the [[Structured sale]], also known as the Ensured Installment Sale and a [[Monetized Installment Sale]], are variations of the traditional installment sale and is intended to protect the seller completely from the risk in connection with the buyer's creditworthiness.

The '''''International Review of Victimology''''' is a triannual [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] that covers the field of [[victimology]]. The [[editor-in-chief]] is Joanna Shapland ([[University of Sheffield]]) and the editors are Edna Erez ([[University of Illinois at Chicago]]), Matthew Hall ([[Sheffield University]]), Leslie Sebba ([[The Hebrew University]]) and Jo-Anne Wemmers ([[Université de Montréal]]). It was established in 1989 and is currently published by [[SAGE Publications]].

The Journal focuses upon traditional areas of victimological research, such as offender typologies, victim-offender Relationship, victimization surveys, victim compensation, the victim in the criminal justice system, reparation and restitution by offenders and crime prevention for victims. The International Review of Victimology also looks at broader theoretical issues such as definitions of victimization and the philosophy of victimology. This in turn opens the door to the consideration of political and human rights issues, including victims of war crimes, and contribution with a comparative perspective. Occasionally, there are special issues dealing with specific topics. Each issue contains reviews of relevant books. 

== History ==
The International Review of Victimology was first published in 1989 under the leadership of John Freeman and Leslie Sebba. The new journal was meant to reflect current developments in the field of victimology, in which leading experts in the field would have an input, not only as contributors, but also in terms of editorial policy and via the peer review process. Unfortunately, at the time of publishing the first issue, it was already clear that John Freeman would have to retire as editor due to health problems. David Miers, originally the Associate Editor, succeeded John Freeman as editor, working with Leslie Sebba, and Joanna Shapland became Associate Editor.  As the number of submissions and interest in the field of victimology increased, so it was necessary to increase the numbers of editors. Joanna Shapland became Editor (subsequently Executive Editor) in 2002.

The idea of creating an international journal in victimology was conceived at the Third International Symposium on Victimology, which was held in 1979 in Munster (Germany). Finding a publisher who was interested in bringing out the journal was not an easy task. Finally, John Freeman found AB Academic Publishing, a small privately owned company, which was owned by Ena Adams. ABA continued to publish the journal until 2011 when it was sold to SAGE. Since its start, the Review has been published in association with the World Society of Victimology, though it is editorially independent from the WSV.

The '''Interstate Wildlife Violator Compact''' (IWVC) is a United States [[interstate compact]] (an agreement among participating states) to provide reciprocal sharing of information regarding sportsman fishing, hunting, and trapping violations and allows for recognition of suspension or revocation of hunting, fishing, and trapping licenses and permits in other member states resulting from violations concerning hunting, fishing and trapping laws in order to prevent poaching across state lines. 

Illegal activities in one state can thus affect a person’s hunting or fishing privileges in all member states. The IWVC obligates members to report wildlife violation convictions to Compact members, gives the members the capability to honor each other's suspensions, and provides the method to exchange violator data between member states. A conviction in one Compact member state may cause them to be barred from participating in hunting, fishing, and trapping in all member states, at the discretion of each state.

==Introduction==
If a person's license or permit privileges which come under the scope of the Compact are suspended or revoked in one member state, they are subject to suspension or revocation in all member states. In addition to license and permit suspensions and revocations which result from a conviction for the illegal pursuit, possession or taking of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, amphibians, mollusks, shellfish and crustaceans, failing to appear in court or to otherwise answer a ticket or summons issued for such violations will also result in license or permit suspension. Compact member states also agree to recognize convictions for violations within the scope of the Compact which occur in all other member states and to apply them toward license and permit suspension and revocations in the state in which the person resides.

The Interstate Wildlife Violator Compact also establishes a process whereby wildlife law violations by a non-resident from a member state are handled as if the person were a resident, meaning they can be served a ticket rather than being arrested, booked, and bonded. This process is a convenience for hunters, fishermen, and trappers of member states, and increases efficiency of Game Wardens by allowing more time for enforcement duties rather than violator processing procedures.

Each member state honors all similar wildlife violation suspensions from other member states. This would include Failure to Appear in court violations. One of the benefits to sportsman who violate wildlife laws is if they are from a member state game warden can write them a simple citation instead of taking them to jail and having them post a cash bond. If a non-resident sportsman is issued a wildlife citation fails to comply with the citation or appear in court, the Wildlife Agency of that state will notify their home state of a Failure to Comply. The home state will then suspend that person's resident hunting or fishing license. Once the sportsman complies with the initial violation, their home state will be notified and their resident license will be reinstated. The threat of not being able to hunt, fish, or trap in most states will serve as a powerful deterrent to would be poachers.

For a state to become a part of the compact, the state first must pass a legislation to join then the state's wildlife agency will adopt regulations to implement the membership. Membership in the compact requires no additional funding or additional staffing, however, as of 2018, there is a $500 annual membership fee for each state. Entering the violators into the database take a small amount of time and is normally the responsibility of the state's existing wildlife agency personnel.

==History==
The concept of a wildlife violator compact was first advanced in the early 1980s by member states in the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies. Law enforcement administrators and Wildlife Commissioners from several states began discussing the idea of a compact based on the format of the existing [[Driver License Compact]] and [[Non-Resident Violator Compact]]s, both of these related to motor vehicle operator licensing and enforcement.

In 1985 draft compacts were developed independently in Colorado and Nevada. Subsequently, these drafts were merged and the Interstate Wildlife Violator Compact was created. During the 1989 Legislative session compact legislation was passed into law in Colorado, Nevada and Oregon. These three states formed the nucleus of the compact.

==Member states==
The 48 IWVC member states are: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska (bill is currently on the Governor's desk), Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.&lt;ref&gt;Most states websites are not updated regularly; Utah apparently has the most complete list: {{cite web|title=Know the consequences|url=http://wildlife.utah.gov/know-the-consequences.html|access-date=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every state which is a member has a page describing the compact. Here are some of them.

==Non-member states==
These two states are, as of July 2018, not members of the IWVC: Hawaii, and Massachusetts. 

State legislation is pending in Massachusetts to enter the Commonwealth into the IWVC and to update penalties for existing wildlife crimes, including elevating fines, jail time, and license suspensions. Entering the IWVC will prevent wildlife violators who have lost their hunting, trapping, or fishing privileges in member states from going to Massachusetts to circumvent their license revocations and preventing Massachusetts residents who have lost their licenses from going out of state to evade punishment. The legislation also creates heightened penalties for chronic poachers and those who kill animals for pure thrill, to give the Massachusetts Environmental Police an additional tool to target those who intentionally and repeatedly disregard the laws in place to protect wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wildlife.utah.gov/know-the-consequences.html|title=Know the consequences|website=Wildlife.Utah.gov|access-date=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==How the Compact Works==
The compact creates reciprocity among member states for purposes of hunting, fishing, and trapping license suspensions. In most instances, when a resident of a Compact state ("home state") commits a wildlife violation in another member state ("charging state"), the officer in the charging state can treat the non-resident violator as though he/she were a resident - issuing a citation and releasing him/her on personal recognizance. If the violator fails to comply with the citation, the charging state may request the violator's home state to suspend hunting privileges until the violator complies with the terms of the ticket. If the violator is convicted, he/she will be entered into the Compact database. The home state and all member states may treat the conviction as though it occurred in their own state for purposes of license suspension. 

==Benefits of the Compact==
The Compact reduces [[poaching]] through reciprocal recognition of license suspensions which reduces interstate wildlife violator movement. Previous to the Compact, a poacher could lose their license and simply cross state lines with no penalty. They would have to lose their license in each state in order for penalties to take effect. With the Compact, poachers caught poaching in a participating state, he/she will be held accountable for his/her actions across any participating state. 

The Compact streamlines the process for dealing with non-resident violators, conserving valuable state resources and enhancing efficiency of services. There are fewer arrests because officers can cite-and-release non-residents, thereby reducing the burden on jail facilities and courts. In addition, since a non-resident offender is subject to license suspension in his/her state home state for failure to comply with a citation, he/she has the same incentive to comply as a resident - reducing failure-to-appear cases. 

==Process for Joining==
There are a few steps required for a state to join the Compact:

1. The state must pass legislation to join (incorporating the Compact directly into the state's statutes or authorizing the state wildlife agency to join). 

2. The agency must adopt regulations to implement Compact membership. States communicate suspensions with each other using the Compact database, which stores revocation information. 

3. States must pay an annual fee of $500 for access to the database. Entering violators into the Compact and ratifying other states' suspensions requires a minor time commitment and this responsibility is usually carried out by existing agency personnel. 

==Conflicting with State Laws==
The Compact provides general procedures to be followed by enforcement agencies and courts. A state can develop specific Compact procedures to comply with legal and administrative requirements of that state as long as the procedures comply with the intent of the Compact. The Compact does not affect the right of any participating state to apply any of its laws relating to license privileges to any person or circumstance. When the Compact conflicts with a state's laws, it remains in full force and effect for the at state without the conflicting provision.

'''Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership''' ('''JPFO''') is a [[501(c)(3)]] [[nonprofit organization]] dedicated to the preservation of [[gun rights]] in the United States and to encourage Americans to understand, uphold, and defend "all of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] for all Citizens.&lt;ref&gt;JPFO "[http://jpfo.org/filegen-a-m/jpfobor.htm What Is Bill of Rights Day?]"&lt;/ref&gt;" The group was founded by U.S. Navy veteran, former [[Federal Firearms License|FFL]] dealer, and author [[Aaron S. Zelman]] in 1989. Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership recognizes the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] as protecting a pre-existing natural law right of individuals to keep and bear arms. It is based in [[Bellevue, Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jpfo.org/filegen-a-m/about.htm JPFO: ''About JPFO''] Retrieved 2012-12-16&lt;/ref&gt;

Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership takes the position that an armed citizenry is the population's last line of defense against tyranny by their own government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Gregg Lee Carter|author=Samuel C.

''[https://books.google.com/books?id=9qDIamIBC90C&amp;pg=PA137 Guns, Democracy, and the Insurrectionist Idea]'', p. 137 (University of Michigan Press, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization is noted for producing materials (bumper stickers, posters, billboards, booklets, videos, etc.) with messages that equate gun control with [[totalitarianism]].  The most famous of these are the "All in favor of Gun Control raise your right hand" materials, which features a drawing of [[Adolf Hitler]] giving a [[Nazi salute]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://shop.jpfo.org/cart.php?m=product_detail&amp;p=78 JPFO online store: ''Raise Your Right Hand poster''] Retrieved 2012-12-16&lt;/ref&gt; The organization also attempts to prove that [[genocide]] is linked to [[gun control]], by showing that most countries where a genocide has taken place had gun control first.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpfo.org/filegen-a-m/deathgc.htm JPFO: ''The Human Cost of "Gun Control" Ideas''] Retrieved 2012-12-16&lt;/ref&gt;

Members are not required to be [[Jew]]ish. The only membership requirement is that you must be a "law-abiding citizen," by "obeying the Bill of Rights."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpfo.org/filegen-a-m/member.htm JPFO: ''JPFO Membership Information''] Retrieved 2012-12-16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disagreement with the Anti-Defamation League==
Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership has been highly critical of the [[Anti-Defamation League|Anti-Defamation League (ADL)]]. In pamphlets such as "Why Does the ADL Support Nazi-Based Laws?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpfo.org/alerts/alert20070920.htm JPFO: "Why Does the ADL Support Nazi-Based Laws?"] Retrieved 2012-12-16&lt;/ref&gt; and "JPFO Facts vs. ADL Lies,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://jpfo.org/filegen-a-m/jpfacts.htm JPFO: "JPFO Facts vs. ADL Lies."] Retrieved 2012-12-16&lt;/ref&gt; the JPFO has accused the ADL of undermining the welfare of the Jewish people.

In response, [[Abraham Foxman]], National Director of the Anti-Defamation League, wrote about the JPFO, "[[Anti-Semitism]] has a long and painful history, and the linkage to gun control is a tactic by Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership to manipulate the fear of anti-Semitism toward their own end... It is a campaign that has been viewed with concern by many in the Jewish community."&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7D6123CF932A15756C0A963958260  Abraham Foxman, ADL, in New York Times opinion piece, May 16, 1995: "N.R.A. Doesn't Represent George Bush or Even Most Members; Jewish Pro-Gun Group."] Retrieved 2012-12-16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political positions==
{{see also|Gun politics in Germany}}
Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership is probably most noted for its claim that parts of the text of the [[Gun Control Act of 1968]] were translated from Nazi legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jpfo.org/filegen-a-m/GCA_68.htm JPFO: ''"Gun Control’s" Nazi Connection''] Retrieved 2012-12-16&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gun legislation in Germany#Hitler.27s partial relaxation of gun control on government workers in Nazi Germany|German Weapons Law]], which existed before the Nazis came to power in 1933, was altered on 18 March 1938 by the Nazi Government. The JPFO's claim is based in part on the fact that the 1968 GCA introduces the "sporting purpose" test to distinguish different types of weapons, similar to the "sporting purpose" test that existed in the German law in question. Senator Thomas Dodd was a prosecutor at the [[Nuremberg Trials]] and had reviewed copies of the Nazi Germany firearms laws, and in 1968 requested translations of these from the Library of Congress.

[[Bernard Harcourt]], professor at the [[University of Chicago Law School]], in discussing this fundamental proposition advanced by the JPFO, notes, "[O]n January 13th, 1919, the Reichstag enacted legislation requiring surrender of all guns to the government. This law, as well as the August 7, 1920, ''Law on the Disarmament of the People'' passed in light of the Versailles Treaty, remained in effect until 1928, when the German parliament enacted the ''Law on Firearms and Ammunition'' (April 12, 1928)—a law which relaxed gun restrictions and put into effect a strict firearm licensing scheme."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.uchicago.edu/faculty/harcourt/harcourt_fordham.pdf Bernard E. Harcourt, April 5, 2004: ''Hitler and Gun Registration''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071126220900/http://www.law.uchicago.edu/faculty/harcourt/harcourt_fordham.pdf |date=November 26, 2007 }} Retrieved 2012-12-16&lt;/ref&gt; Harcourt continued, "To be sure, the Nazis were intent on killing Jewish persons and used the gun laws and regulations to further the genocide", but he concluded that the firearms laws were not central to implementing the Holocaust.

Attorney and author [[Stephen Halbrook]], in his law article "Nazi Firearms Law and the Disarming of the German Jews", asserts that German arms laws were extremely lax, and even under the 1920 "Law on the Disarmament of the People", only items such as grenades and machineguns were banned and small arms such as rifles and pistols remained in common use.&lt;ref name=Halbrook&gt;[http://www.stephenhalbrook.com/article-nazilaw.pdf Stephen Halbrook, 17 Arizona Journal of International and Comparative Law, 2000: ''Nazi Firearms Law and the Disarming of the German Jews''] Retrieved 2012-12-16&lt;/ref&gt; Valery Polozov, a former advisor to the committee on national security in the Russian Duma, claims in his book "Firearms in Civil Society" that Germany did not in fact have comprehensive gun control legislation up until 1928, which created the legal framework later built upon by the Nazis. Halbrook did clarify in the first sentences of his article that, "Gun control laws are depicted as benign and historically progressive. However, German firearm laws and hysteria created against Jewish firearm owners played a major role in laying the groundwork for the eradication of German Jewry in the Holocaust."&lt;ref name=Halbrook /&gt;

== Bill of Rights Sentinel  ==
JPFO publishes for its membership the "Bill of Rights Sentinel&lt;ref&gt;JPFO "[http://jpfo.org/filegen-n-z2/sentinel-archive.htm Bill of Rights Sentinel Archive.]"&lt;/ref&gt;," a quarterly newsletter, with a masthead featuring the motto, "All the Bill of Rights for All Citizens."

== Bill of Rights Day ==
JPFO founder Aaron Zelman believed in the importance of the Bill of Rights and encouraged Americans to celebrate Bill of Rights Day&lt;ref&gt;JPFO "[http://jpfo.org/filegen-a-m/jpfobor.htm What Is Bill of Rights Day?]"&lt;/ref&gt; (December 15th).

== Aaron Zelman letter to Ted Nugent ==
In 2010, JPFO Founder Aaron Zelman issued an open letter to NRA Board of Directors member Ted Nugent, titled "The Day I'll join the NRA.&lt;ref&gt;Zelman, Aaron S. (2010). "[http://jpfo.org/articles-assd02/nugent-open-letter.htm The Day I'll Join the NRA.]" JPFO&lt;/ref&gt;"

== Don't Inspire Evil Initiative ==
JPFO's "Don't Inspire Evil Initiative&lt;ref&gt;JPFO "[http://jpfo.org/articles-2016/korwin-media-initiative.htm Amendment to Journalism Ethics Proposed.]"&lt;/ref&gt;" is a proposal that "calls upon all journalists to refrain from gratuitous or repetitious portrayal of mass murderers' names and images."

== JPFO on "Never Again!" ==
In 2018, JPFO advisory board member Dov Marhoffer, a [[Holocaust]] [[Concentration Camp|concentration camp]] survivor, penned an [[op-ed]] titled "Never Again&lt;ref&gt;Dov Marhoffer (July 11, 2018) "[http://www.jewishaz.com/opinion/never-again-belongs-to-the-holocaust-not-to-the-movement/article_244c47fa-8542-11e8-a7cb-4bb851136f69.html ‘Never again’ belongs to the Holocaust, not to the movement for gun control]" Jewish News&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dov Marhoffer (July 17, 2018) "[http://www.sdjewishworld.com/2018/07/17/oped-never-again-should-be-reserved-for-holocaust/ Never Again should be reserved for Holocaust]" San Diego Jewish World&lt;/ref&gt;" calling attention to what JPFO believes to be an appropriate historical understanding and context of the [[motto]]. In the piece, Marhoffer sees alternative usage of the motto promoting gun control as inappropriate.

== JPFO Rabbinic Director ==
JPFO's Rabbinic Directors, providing guidance on Judaism and firearms, include Rabbi R. Mermelstein&lt;ref&gt;Mermelstein, Rabbi R. (April 11, 2001). "[http://jpfo.org/alerts/alert20010411.htm Redefining Hypocrisy and Chutzpah.]" JPFO.&lt;/ref&gt; and Rabbi Dovid Bendory&lt;ref&gt;Bendory, Rabbi Dovid (Archives) "[http://jpfo.org/rabbi/rabbi-archive.htm Rabbi Bendory's Archive Page.]" JPFO&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Mission statement==
''From the Law Library of Congress website:''

&lt;blockquote&gt;The mission of the Law Library of Congress is to provide research and legal information to the U.S. Congress as well as to U.S. Federal Courts and Executive Agencies, and to offer reference services to the public ... To accomplish this mission, it has created the world's largest collection of law books and other legal resources from all countries, and now moves into the age of digitized information with online databases and guides to legal information worldwide.&lt;sup&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/law/public/law-about.html]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==

===Early years===
The [[Library of Congress]] was established as an in-house reference library for Congress in 1800, the year the government moved from [[Philadelphia]] to the new city of [[Washington D.C.|Washington, D.C.]] Law books made up nearly 20% of the initial collection. These were for the most part publications in English and [[International law]].

The first Library of Congress was destroyed when the British burned the [[United States Capitol Building|Capitol Building]] in 1814. It was replaced by the purchase of the library of [[Thomas Jefferson]] in 1815. This brought 475 law titles, 318 of which were published in England. It included [[Virginia]] laws and court decisions, but material from other states (which Jefferson had classified as "foreign law") remained limited. Although the Library received copies of all federal laws and Supreme Court decisions, obtaining state laws and decisions of state courts remained a problem for decades.

===The Supreme Court===
There were repeated efforts to extend the use of what was generally called "The Congress Library" to other government officials and especially to the federal judiciary. The [[United States Supreme Court]] sat in the United States Capitol Building from 1801 to 1935. For the first decade of the nineteenth century its Justices could not formally use the Library of Congress, although they may have been able to consult the books with a letter of introduction from a Member of Congress. On March 2, 1812, a Joint Resolution of both Houses of Congresses authorized use of the Library by the justices of the Supreme Court, on whose behalf [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Marshall]] (served 1801–1835) wrote a polite letter thanking Congress for the favor.

===Establishment of the Law Library in 1832===
The first three decades of the nineteenth century saw repeated unsuccessful attempts to establish a separate Law Library to serve both Congress and the Supreme Court. The initiative came from those members of Congress who had had distinguished legal or judicial careers. On January 20, 1832, [[New York (state)|New York]] Senator [[William L. Marcy]], a sometime Associate Judge of the [[New York Supreme Court|Supreme Court of New York]], introduced a bill to "Increase and Improve the Law Department of the Library of Congress". This time, the Bill passed both Houses of Congress and was signed by President [[Andrew Jackson]] on July 14, 1832. (The Statute remains in force, now listed as {{USC|2|132}}, {{USC|2|134|notitle=1}}, {{USC|2|135|notitle=1}}, and {{USC|2|137|notitle=1}}.)

The Act directed the Librarian to prepare an "apartment" for the purpose of a law library and to remove the law books from the library into the apartment. The Justices of the Supreme Court were authorized to make rules and regulations for the use of the Law Library during the sitting of the court. The Law Library, however, remained a part of the Library of Congress which was responsible for its incidental expenses.

A sum of $5,000 was appropriated "for the present year" to purchase law books, with $1,000 for each of the next five years. The books would be selected by the Chief Justice. Some 2,011 law books (693 of which had belonged to Thomas Jefferson) were transferred from the general collection, and became the nucleus of a collection that now exceeds 2 million volumes. The Law Library thus acquired its own appropriation and budget line, as well as a statutory relationship with the Supreme Court that would endure until 1935.

===Providing legal information to Congress and the Supreme Court===
[[File:Law Library of the Library of Congress in the U.S. Capitol c 1895.jpg|thumb|Law Library from in the former Supreme Court Chamber]]
From 1860 to 1897, the Law Library was housed in the former [[Old Supreme Court Chamber|Supreme Court Chamber]] in the Capitol Building. A spiral staircase connected this with the Court in the room above, and the Custodian of Law (the early title of the official later called the Law Librarian, the first of whom would be Charles Henry Wharton Meehan) climbed the stair to deliver materials requested by the Justices. The rules of the Law Library, set down by the Chief Justice, permitted the Justices of the Supreme Court, Members of Congress, and some "gentlemen of the bar having a case on the docket" to sign out up to three books from the collection. The Custodian of Law helped patrons to find the law by physically locating a book and putting it in their hands. A special collection of major texts and court decisions was reserved for the exclusive use of the Justices.

The acquisition of the [[Louisiana Territory]] (1803) and of [[Florida Territory|Florida]] (1819), which brought property and inheritance systems based on [[Law of France|French]] and [[Law of Spain|Spanish law]], provided some incentive for the acquisition of books from the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] tradition. The first systematic effort to collect foreign law came in 1848 soon after the conclusion of the [[Mexican–American War|Mexican War]], when Congress directed the Library to obtain all available [[law of Mexico|laws of Mexico]]. In the second half of the nineteenth century collections of laws of the major European nations were added.

===Public service circa 1898===
Although the Library of Congress was founded and funded to serve Congress, from the earliest years there was pressure to make its collections available to the public as well as to government officials. By the end of the nineteenth century members of the public were free to consult the collections, although only Members of Congress and a few other officials could borrow books. The Law Library had a few tables, which were usually occupied by students from local law schools.

The Law Librarian's Annual Report for 1898 described a room "about 50 feet square. This cockpit, dim-lighted and inconvenient, ... is expected to accommodate the justices, lawyers engaged in cases, the members of the bar in search of light, as well as law students." Service was limited by crowding, short hours, and a small staff who were obligated to serve Congress and the Supreme Court before anyone else. A law reading room with a limited collection was set up in the newly opened [[Library of Congress Building]] in 1897, and eventually the entire collection and staff moved to less crowded quarters in the new building.

===Expansion===
The 20th century saw a major expansion of the scope of all Law Library activities. Reference service to the public benefited from a larger and, equally important, a well-catalogued collection. In the first decade of the 20th century the Law Library began a program of publication of authoritative reference works on the laws of the United States and of major foreign nations. After the early 1900s the Law Library was led by a series of Law Librarians with high professional qualifications and previous experience in the practice of law, the foreign service, or academic law schools. They oversaw what became a major on-going program of legal indexing, first for the laws of the United States and then for those of foreign nations.

In 1899 the law collection consisted of 103,000 volumes (including 15,000 duplicates), of which about 10,000 were in foreign languages.&lt;ref name=Dorn&gt;{{cite web |last=Dorn |first=Nathan |title=The World's Legal Heritage in Great Subterranean Halls, or ... A Collection Big with Babylonian Perspective |date=7 May 2013 |website=In Custodia Legis blog |publisher=Law Library of Congress |url=http://blogs.loc.gov/law/2013/05/the-worlds-legal-heritage-in-great-subterranean-halls-or-a-collection-big-with-babylonian-perspective/ |accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1950, 150,000 of 750,000 volumes were in foreign languages.&lt;ref name=Dorn/&gt; The major acquisition of foreign language material came after the Second World War, and reflected the great increase in the absolute number of jurisdictions in the world, the changing position of the United States in world affairs and the deliberate policy of attempting to collect legal material from all jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=Dorn/&gt;

The 1909 publication of the index to the United States federal statutes, which immediately became a standard reference work for law libraries, marked the beginning of the Law Library's transition from a purely local reference library to a major center for legal research. Law Librarian Dr. [[Edwin Borchard]] began the production of bibliographic guides to the law of foreign countries with the 1912 publication of a guide to the law of [[Germany]], followed in 1913 by his own ''Bibliography of International Law and Continental Law''. For the next several decades major publications on the laws of [[Spain]], [[France]], the larger [[Latin America]]n countries, [[Eastern Europe]] and [[East Asia]] were produced, usually with support from various foundations or government agencies. Initially the work was done by temporary staff or outside experts, but after the mid-1930s the Law Library gradually began adding permanent staff whose primary qualifications were in foreign rather than United States law.

The permanent staff of the Law Library grew from 5 in 1901 to 6 in 1910, stayed at 7 from 1911 through 1921, and numbered 10 in 1924. Their numbers were augmented by sets of temporary workers employed on specific projects and funded either by grants from foundations or by one-time Congressional appropriations. By 1946 the total had increased to 30, and the Law Library requested 30 additional positions to relieve the overburdened staff.

Funding from outside bodies supported the expansion of the Law Library's foreign research capabilities after the [[Second World War]]. From 1949 to 1960 the [[National Committee for a Free Europe]] supported a staff of 12 lawyers from Eastern European and Baltic countries then under Communist rule. In 1951 the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] began a Far Eastern Law Project, under which refugee scholars from China collected and translated legal material from the newly established [[People's Republic of China]].

By the 1950s the Law Library responded to the manifold problems of trying to find, much less interpret, foreign legal information by striving to, whenever possible, employ individuals trained in the law of the country in question and able to provide authoritative answers in English. The staff of foreign-trained attorneys has, over the years since the late 1940s, included former judges, private practitioners, diplomats and legislative drafters. In fact, the foreign attorneys play a significant role in developing the collection, selecting the most relevant texts and serials for the jurisdictions they cover.

By 1960 the pattern of a Reading Room providing reference service in United States federal and state law and a foreign legal research and reference wing staffed by specialists with expertise in the laws of particular foreign countries was set.

===Move to Madison Building===
In 1981, the library's collections were moved across [[Independence Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Independence Avenue]] to the sub-basement of the recently constructed [[James Madison Memorial Building]].&lt;ref name="Strattner"&gt;{{cite web |last=Strattner |first=Mark |title=Thirty Years Ago – The Big Move |date=2 February 2011 |website=In Custodia Legis blog |publisher=Law Library of Congress |url=http://blogs.loc.gov/law/2011/02/the-big-move/ |accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moving the library's 1.6 million volumes took four months, and a new reading room opened in April 1981 on the second floor of the Madison building.&lt;ref name="Strattner"/&gt; The new stacks occupied 81,000 square feet, totaling 59.5 linear miles of [[mobile shelving]].&lt;ref name="Strattner"/&gt;

By 2002, the Madison building stacks were full, and additional materials were sent to the Library of Congress' High Density Storage Facility in [[Fort Meade, Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Carroll |first=Kurt |title=Fort Meade Delivers, or Finding a Needle in this Haystack Couldn't be Easier |date=28 October 2010 |website=In Custodia Legis blog |publisher=Law Library of Congress |url=http://blogs.loc.gov/law/2010/10/fort-meade-delivers/ |accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutional differentiation===
After about 1900, as the volume of acquisitions and the percentage of foreign language materials both increased and the workload of the Supreme Court also increased, the Justices played a diminishing role in the selection of books for the Law Library. The move of the Supreme Court to its own building in 1935, and the establishment of a separate [[Supreme Court Library]] of American and British law brought the close institutional relations between the Law Library and the Court to an end. The Law Library continues to support the Supreme Court's needs for information on foreign and international law.

Congress established the [[Legislative Reference Service]] (the organizational ancestor of the present [[Congressional Research Service]]) in 1914, but for its first decade the LRS was headed by the Law Librarian and much of its work consisted of legal indexing, for both American and foreign law, and responses to Congressional requests about American, International and foreign law.

By the late 1920s the division of labor that endures to the present was established. The RS (later CRS) contains an American Law Section (now Division) working exclusively for Congress and depending on the collection maintained by the Law Library. The Law Library operates the Reading Room, provides reference service in U.S. law to Congress on a priority basis, and is responsible for all reference and research service in foreign, comparative and international law.

===Indexing foreign law===
Indexes and other finding aids are indispensable tools for [[legal research]], but the laws of many countries are not well-indexed or available in authoritative or up-to-date codes or collections. The first major project of the Law Library was the 1907–1910 preparation of an index to United States federal statutes, an endeavor funded by a special Congressional appropriation. In 1902 the Librarian of Congress, [[Herbert Putnam]], proposed a comprehensive index to current legislation from all the countries of the world. He noted that "If accompanied by a reference to preceding statutes or by brief abstracts ... it may become an instrument of the highest value not merely to the theoretic investigator, but to the practical legislator". Although there were far fewer sovereign countries in 1902 than today, Congress's practical legislators refused to fund so ambitious a project. The idea did not die though, and various guides to the legislation of foreign countries were produced as funding permitted.

Legislative indexing was a major activity of the Legislative Reference Service during its first ten years (1916–1924), and the staff of the Law library began keeping a card index to Latin American laws in the late 1920s. This was eventually published as the Index to Latin American Legislation in a two volume set in 1961, with two supplements - in 1973 and 1978 - covering the years from 1961 through 1975. The indexing of Latin American legislation continued, being adapted to existing information-processing technology as it developed from the 1970s through the 1990s.

By the 1990s, indexes and guides to the laws of many developed nations had become available, often on a commercial basis, as electronic files accessible through the Internet. Although not usually available to the general public, the Law Library's legal specialists used these for their research. But, control of a rapidly expanding body of legal information from a growing number of jurisdictions remained a major challenge to legal researchers. One institutional solution arrived at was an international, cooperative network that makes indexes, abstracts and the complete text of new laws available over the Internet. This is the [[Global Legal Information Network]] (GLIN), which is coordinated by the Law Library of Congress. The Library's foreign law efforts are via  its Directorate of Legal Research, which has a staff of foreign–trained lawyers from around the world along with research specialists.

===Notable reports issued===

In August 2009, the Law Library of Congress issued a controversial and disputed [[legal opinion]] report titled ''[[Honduras: Constitutional Law Issues]]''. The report was originally commissioned by [[U.S. Congressman|Congressman]] [[Aaron Schock]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R.]], [[Illinois|Ill.]]), prepared by Senior Foreign Law Specialist Norma Gutiérrez, and published by the Law Library of Congress. It features a legal analysis of the [[2009 Honduran constitutional crisis]] with a specific examination of the legality of [[President of Honduras|President]] [[Manuel Zelaya|Manuel Zelaya's]] 28 June 2009 [[2009 Honduran coup d'état|removal from office and expatriation]].&lt;ref name = "Honduras Constitutional Issues p8"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.loc.gov/law/help/honduras/constitutional-law-issues.php | title = Honduras: Constitutional Issues| date = August 2009 |  publisher = Law Library of Congress|page = 8|accessdate=2009-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Legal Services Commission''' ('''LSC''') was an executive [[non-departmental public body]] of the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]] that was responsible for the operational administration of [[legal aid]] in [[England and Wales]].

==Overview==
The LSC was responsible for a budget of around [[Pound sterling|£]]2&amp;nbsp;billion annually, and helping over 2 million people with their legal problems across England and Wales each year. It was established under the [[Access to Justice Act 1999]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawcentres.org.uk/uploads/Legal_Aid.pdf |title=Legal Aid History |publisher=[[Law Centre Federation]] |deadurl=yes |accessdate=5 November 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917034911/http://www.lawcentres.org.uk/uploads/Legal_Aid.pdf |archivedate=17 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2000 replaced the Legal Aid Board (founded 30 June 1949). Sponsored by the Ministry of Justice, the LSC helped to protect the fundamental rights of the individual and addressed problems that contribute to social exclusion. The Chair of the LSC was Sir [[Bill Callaghan]] and its work was overseen by an independent board of commissioners. The Chief Executive of the LSC was Matthew Coats.

==Replacement by Legal Aid Agency==
The [[Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012]] made provision for the abolition of the LSC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/10/pdfs/ukpga_20120010_en.pdf LASPO Act at legislation.gov.uk, accessed 4 August 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; The LSC was replaced by the [[Legal Aid Agency]], an [[executive agency]] of the Ministry of Justice, on 1 April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalservices.gov.uk/civil/cls_news_13713.asp Legal Services Commission website - news. Retrieved 14 August 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; The agency carries out a similar function to the LSC, although executive agency status differs from the LSC's non-departmental public body status. Independence of decision-making within the Legal Aid Agency is through the post of a Director of Legal Aid Casework, who has independence from the [[Lord Chancellor]] in applying directions and guidance to any individual funding decision. Matthew Coats is the Chief Executive of the new agency, and he is also the Director of Legal Aid Casework.

== Services ==
The LSC was responsible for the development and administration of two service programmes: 

* The Civil Legal Service (CLS), which provides services under the [[Civil Legal Advice]] (CLA) banner
* The [[Criminal Defence Service]] (CDS)

The CLA aimed to improve access to quality information and help for civil legal problems, in fields such as family, debt and housing law. CLA provides direct legal advice services to the public via its [https://web.archive.org/web/20100514003158/http://www.communitylegaladvice.org.uk/ Community Legal Advice website] and helpline, and also provides advice centre offices for low-income individuals and families, who are referred to participating [[solicitor]]s and advice agencies that are certified through the CLA's Quality Mark scheme.

The CDS provides free legal advice and representation for people facing criminal charges who are unable to pay for legal help. This is supplied through criminal solicitors’ offices and the Public Defender Service.

==Criticism==
In the [[House of Commons (United Kingdom)|House of Commons]] on 20 July 2010 [[Robert Buckland]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] made what the [[Parliamentary Under-secretary of State]] for Justice, [[Jonathan Djanogly]], described as "serious accusations of mismanagement".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jonathandjanogly.com/content/justice-questions-0 Website of Jonathan Djanogly, MP]&lt;/ref&gt;

In dealing with the pro se litigant, a judge must remain impartial but ensure that the litigant receives a fair hearing. If the judge does too much to help the party, she risks becoming an advocate; if she does too little, the party is denied the fundamental right to a fair hearing. The problem is compounded if the pro se party tests the limits of the court's patience and the judge overreacts."

Law schools in this list are categorized by whether they are currently active, proposed, or closed; within each section they are listed in alphabetical order by state, then name. Most of these law schools grant the [[Juris Doctor]] degree, which is the typical [[first professional degree]] in law in the United States.

Law schools are nationally accredited by the [[American Bar Association]] (ABA),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abanet.org/legaled/accreditation/acinfo.html ABA Accreditation Process]&lt;/ref&gt; and graduates of these schools may generally sit for the [[bar exam]] in any state. There are 206 ABA accredited law schools, divided between 202 with full accreditation and with provisional accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.americanbar.org/groups/legal_education/resources/aba_approved_law_schools.html List of ABA approved law schools]&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Whittier Law School]] will no longer be taking students and the legal program will be discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.law.whittier.edu/index/news/article/a-message-from-the-whittier-college-board-of-trustees|title=A Message from the Whittier College Board of Trustees|access-date=2017-04-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, individual state legislatures or bar examiners, like the [[State Bar of California]], may maintain a separate accreditation system which is open to non-ABA accredited schools.  The California State Bar also accredits law schools, which the California Committee of Bar Examiners (CBE) recognizes.  Also, the CBE allows registered "Unaccredited" schools to operate and students of those schools are eligible to take the California Bar Examination upon graduation.

No [[Correspondence law school|correspondence or online law schools]] are accredited by the ABA&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abanet.org/careercounsel/faq.html] ABA-CLE Career Resource Center&lt;/ref&gt; or by state bar examiners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calbar.ca.gov/state/calbar/calbar_generic.jsp?cid%3D10115%26id%3D5128#CLC |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630153344/http://www.calbar.ca.gov/state/calbar/calbar_generic.jsp?cid=10115&amp;id=5128#CLC |archivedate=2007-06-30 |df= }} Law Schools&lt;/ref&gt; However, twelve correspondence and online law schools, although not accredited, are registered by the Committee of Bar Examiners of the State Bar of California. This means that the graduates of these distance learning law schools can sit for the California Bar Examination and, under varying circumstances, the bar exams in many other states.

'''Longlife''' (Longlife - Sustainable, [[Efficient energy use|energy efficient]] residential buildings in regard to European requirements and innovative technologies in the [[Baltic Sea Region]]) is a transnational project in the Baltic Region. It is funded through the [[European Union|EU]] programme [[Baltic Sea Region Programme|Baltic Sea Region]] 2007-2013. Longlife contributes to the EU Strategy 2020&lt;ref name="EU 2020 targets"/&gt; framework to reduce [[energy consumption]].

== Longlife project ==
Longlife is developing standards for sustainable, energy efficient building in the Baltic Region and harmonizing the different construction technologies. This includes standards for sustainability, procedures for planning, building permits and tendering and funding in the Baltic Region. One of the goals is to make the Baltic Region more competitive.

In the Longlife project partners from [[Denmark]], [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]] and [[Germany]] are working together. Lead Partner is the [[TU Berlin]], Institute of Architecture, Chair of Design and Structure, Prof. Dr.-Ing. Klaus Rückert. The developed [[Technical standard|standard]]s and [[wikt:benchmark|benchmark]]s are minimum requirements for sustainable buildings. Considerations are made concerning the ecological, economic and social aspects in the life cycle of a building. The design process is supported by the Longlife prototype, a catalogue of materials, components and key technologies for energy efficiency and renewable energy sources that meet the minimum requirements of Longlife, e.g. the [[final energy]] consumption of 40kWh / m² year.

Longlife will demonstrate with [[Pilot experiment|Pilot projects]] that an extra effort in the integrated planning in order to minimize energy consumption and [[operating costs]] of a building life cycle is worthwhile.

At the end of the planning process, the building will be certified with the Longlife Performance Pass. This performance pass includes measurable data from the building in the fields of energy, costs and qualities. The practical solutions and innovative technologies are also applicable to other building types. Together with seven other projects Longlife will develop in 2012 a compendium which shows the potential and synergy of an energy cluster.&lt;ref name="Energy Cluster"/&gt;

As a continuation of the project's work, the Longlife Institute e.V. was founded in September 2011.&lt;ref name="Longlife Institute" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7912">The '''Luders Affair''' was a legal and diplomatic embarrassment to the [[Haiti]]an government in 1897.
[[File:Luders Affair, Germany, Haiti.jpg|thumb|A German postcard of Captain August Carl Thiele handing over the German Ultimatum on 6 December 1897 during the Luders Affair]]
On September 21, 1897, Haitian police were looking for one Dorléus Présumé, who was accused of theft. They found him washing a coach in front of the "Écuries Centrales" (Central Stables) of [[Port-au-Prince]], whose proprietor was Emile Lüders.&lt;ref&gt;His last name is usually written ''Luders'' in French.&lt;/ref&gt; Présumé resisted arrest, and Lüders, who had heard the noise, came to his defence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacques Nicolas Léger]], ''Haiti, Her History and Her Detractors'', New York: Neale, 1907, OCLC 561509564, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YakaAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA249&amp;lpg=PA249&amp;dq=Dorl%C3%A9us+Pr%C3%A9sum%C3%A9+Luders+Haiti&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GJUmxctIC5&amp;sig=BnZybVbCf6eqVQym_qDYtQ6gIWA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Bq_dS4-IAYX4sgPFopCHBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CA4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=charged%20with%20having%20committed%20petty%20larceny&amp;f=false p. 249].&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 21, 1897, both Présumé and Lüders were sentenced by the Police Tribunal to one month's imprisonment for assault and battery. They appealed to the Correctional Tribunal, but this time they were also charged with using force to resist arrest. The original sentence was annulled and on October 14 they were sentenced to one year's imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Léger, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YakaAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA249&amp;lpg=PA249&amp;dq=Dorl%C3%A9us+Pr%C3%A9sum%C3%A9+Luders+Haiti&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GJUmxctIC5&amp;sig=BnZybVbCf6eqVQym_qDYtQ6gIWA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Bq_dS4-IAYX4sgPFopCHBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CA4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=they%20were%20consequently%20sentenced&amp;f=false pp. 249-50].&lt;/ref&gt;

Lüders had previously been sentenced to six days imprisonment in 1894 for battery on a soldier.&lt;ref&gt;[[Solon Ménos]], ''L'affaire Luders'', 2nd ed.

Nonetheless, on October 17 the German [[Chargé d'affaires]], Count Schwerin, demanded the immediate release of Lüders (who had been born in Haiti but had a German father), as well as the removal of the judges and dismissal of the police officers involved in the case.&lt;ref&gt;Léger, pp. 250, 249.&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to intervention by the [[United States|American]] representative, W.F.

[[File:SMS Charlotte (1885) 2.jpg|thumb|The German warship [[SMS Charlotte]] with her crew]]
On December 6, 1897, two German warships, the [[SMS Charlotte|SMS ''Charlotte'']] and the [[SMS Stein|SMS ''Stein'']], anchored in the harbor of Port-au-Prince, without the usual salute, and Captain Thiele of the ''Charlotte'' notified the Haitian government of an [[ultimatum]] whose conditions were humiliating in both form and substance: compensation in the amount of twenty thousand dollars for Luders,&lt;ref&gt;According to Gerhard Wiechmann, ''Die preußisch-deutsche Marine in Lateinamerika 1866 - 1914: eine Studie deutscher Kanonenbootpolitik'', diss. University of Oldenburg, 2000 (German), [http://oops.uni-oldenburg.de/volltexte/2000/445/pdf/kap10.pdf p. 253] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719110817/http://oops.uni-oldenburg.de/volltexte/2000/445/pdf/kap10.pdf |date=2011-07-19 }}, the German government had previously required Schwerin to demand $30,000.&lt;/ref&gt; a promise that Luders could return to Haiti, a letter of apology to the German government, a 21-gun salute to the German flag, a reception for the German Chargé d'affaires, and four hours to decide.&lt;ref&gt;Léger, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YakaAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA249&amp;lpg=PA249&amp;dq=Dorl%C3%A9us+Pr%C3%A9sum%C3%A9+Luders+Haiti&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GJUmxctIC5&amp;sig=BnZybVbCf6eqVQym_qDYtQ6gIWA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Bq_dS4-IAYX4sgPFopCHBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CA4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Thiele&amp;f=false p. 250].&lt;/ref&gt; The President was required to raise a white flag on the presidential palace in token of surrender.&lt;ref&gt;Ménos, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JAgNAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA182&amp;lpg=PA182&amp;dq=Dorl%C3%A9us+Pr%C3%A9sum%C3%A9+L%C3%BCders+Haiti+-wikipedia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=a8OUKvoDx_&amp;sig=qUGZrSxvSmHrRhop3AFeAOFgkwY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_77dS4nvHo2isgOvqJHMBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=en%20arborant%20le%20drapeau%20blanc&amp;f=false p. 314].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Haitian government yielded, to the distress of its people, who had been prepared to defend their national honor.&lt;ref&gt;Léger, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YakaAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA249&amp;lpg=PA249&amp;dq=Dorl%C3%A9us+Pr%C3%A9sum%C3%A9+Luders+Haiti&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GJUmxctIC5&amp;sig=BnZybVbCf6eqVQym_qDYtQ6gIWA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Bq_dS4-IAYX4sgPFopCHBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CA4Q6AEwAQ#v=snippet&amp;q=offended%20the%20national%20amour%20propre&amp;f=false pp. 250-51].&lt;/ref&gt; They were horrified to see the white flag, despite the protestations of the French ambassador, Théodore Meyer, that it was merely a parliamentary standard.&lt;ref&gt;Ménos, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JAgNAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA182&amp;lpg=PA182&amp;dq=Dorl%C3%A9us+Pr%C3%A9sum%C3%A9+L%C3%BCders+Haiti+-wikipedia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=a8OUKvoDx_&amp;sig=qUGZrSxvSmHrRhop3AFeAOFgkwY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_77dS4nvHo2isgOvqJHMBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwBA#v=snippet&amp;q=drapeau%20blanc%20parlementaire&amp;f=false p.334].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Solon Ménos]], Foreign Minister of Haiti at the time, subsequently fought a duel with a member of Lüders' family and was the subject of an action for defamation by two German officials requiring him to append a statement to the end of his book on the Lüders affair.&lt;ref&gt;Ménos, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JAgNAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA182&amp;lpg=PA182&amp;dq=Dorl%C3%A9us+Pr%C3%A9sum%C3%A9+L%C3%BCders+Haiti+-wikipedia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=a8OUKvoDx_&amp;sig=qUGZrSxvSmHrRhop3AFeAOFgkwY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_77dS4nvHo2isgOvqJHMBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=du%20duel%20de%20l%27auteur%20avec%20un%20membre%20de%20la%20famille%20Luders&amp;f=false p. 391].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Luders affair was extremely embarrassing for president Sam, and undermined his authority in Haiti, leading to his resignation in 1902.&lt;ref name=Aftershocks&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dubois|first1=Laurent|title=Haiti: The Aftershocks of History|date=January 3, 2012|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780805095623|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=drU3HlesN5kC&amp;pg=PT221&amp;dq=Hammerton+Killick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30313">The '''Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure (MIP)'''&lt;ref name="MIP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/economic_governance/macroeconomic_imbalance_procedure/index_en.htm|title=Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure|accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced by the [[European Union]] in autumn 2011 amidst the [[European sovereign-debt crisis|economic and financial crisis]], and entered into force on 13 December 2011. It is designed to prevent and correct risky macroeconomic developments, such as high current account deficits, unsustainable external indebtedness and housing bubbles. The MIP is part of the EU's so-called '[[Sixpack (European Union law)|six-pack]]' legislation, which aims to reinforce the monitoring and surveillance of macroeconomic policies in the [[European Union|EU]] and the [[euro area]].

==Procedure==
The first step of each yearly round of the MIP is the '''Alert Mechanism Report''' prepared by the [[European Commission]]. Based on a [[#The scoreboard|scoreboard of indicators]],&lt;ref name="MIP_scoreboard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/economic_governance/macroeconomic_imbalance_procedure/mip_scoreboard/index_en.htm|title=MIP Scoreboard|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are not interpreted mechanically, the Commission identifies the countries and issues which require '''In-Depth Reviews''' for further economic analysis. The Commission also takes into account relevant data beyond the scope of the scoreboard, when selecting countries for in-depth reviews. Based on these in-depth reviews, the Commission determines if imbalances exist; what the nature of the imbalances is; and judges whether they are persistent, aggravating or unwinding. Depending on the severity of the imbalances the Commission proposes a policy recommendation under either the 'preventive arm' or the 'corrective arm' of the MIP.

In the case of countries where an imbalance exists, but is not of an excessive nature, the follow-up to the in-depth review will take place under the '''preventive arm''' of the MIP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/economic_governance/macroeconomic_imbalance_procedure/mip_framework/index_en.htm|title=The MIP framework|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is embedded in the [[Europe 2020#The European Semester|European Semester]] (the EU's yearly cycle of economic policy coordination). This means that the MIP-relevant recommendation will be integrated in the package of proposals for Country-Specific Recommendations, which aim to provide guidance for national policy making.

If the Commission in their In-Depth Review find existence of an excessive imbalance, this might subsequently trigger an '''Excessive Imbalance Procedure''' (EIP) under the '''corrective arm''' of the MIP. The Commission's decision will be taken in the context of the additional analysis of the "National Reform Programme" and "Stability/Convergence Programme" submitted in April. If the Commission on this basis find the excessive imbalance soon will be mitigated by implementation of effective counter measures, they will refrain to open up an EIP, but the state will still be subject to "a specific and close monitoring of policy implementation" by a separate status report issued a half year later, which will conduct a real-time assessment of implemented action and establish peer pressure towards ensuring the promised reform action is taken by the Member State in concern. On the other hand, if an excessive imbalance that jeopardises the proper functioning of the Economic and Monetary Union is still found to exist by the end of the European Semester, not being properly rectified by the submitted programmes, the Commission will then (upon the same time of its publication of Country-Specific Recommendations) forward a special procedural recommendation to the Council for opening up an EIP. If the Council at its subsequent meeting decides to follow the Commission's recommendation to open up an EIP, the member state concerned will then have to submit a "corrective action plan" to the Council and Commission within a short notice, featuring a detailed roadmap for all specific policy actions with specific deadlines for implementing adequate measures satisfying the received Council recommendation. Surveillance will subsequently be stepped up by the Commission through regular progress reports drawn up by the member state concerned. The enforcement of the Excessive Imbalance Procedure is backed by sanctions for euro area member states (up to 0.1% of GDP), if they repeatedly fail to take agreed action or to deliver a sufficient "corrective action plan".&lt;ref name="EIP regulation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:306:0025:0025:EN:PDF |title=REGULATION (EU) No 1176/2011 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 16 November 2011: On the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances |format=PDF |publisher=Official Journal of the European Union |date=23 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715000627/http://old.eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ%3AL%3A2011%3A306%3A0025%3A0025%3AEN%3APDF |archivedate=15 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Review of the 6-pack and 2-pack legislation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/economic_governance/documents/com%282014%29905_en.pdf|title=Economic governance review: Report on the application of Regulations (EU) n° 1173/2011, 1174/2011, 1175/2011, 1176/2011, 1177/2011, 472/2013 and 473/2013|format=PDF|publisher=European Commission|date=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the entry into force of the EIP regulation on 13 December 2011, the Council however never has launched any Excessive Imbalance Procedure. Two main reasons exist for no launched EIP's. The first reason, was that all of the seven states identified to have excessive imbalance through 2013-15, succeeded to present sufficient counter measures when submitting their next year reform programme. The second reason, was that the most fragile and imbalanced "Programme countries" at the height of their imbalances received macroeconomic financial support from [[European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism|EFSM]]/[[European Financial Stability Fund|EFSF]]/[[European Stability Mechanism|ESM]]/[[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] or the EU Balance of Payments Programme, and thus were not covered at all by the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure and the Excessive Imbalance Procedure (instead being tightly monitored by their macroeconomic financial assistance programme). In 2013 the list of "Programme countries" included: [[2012–13 Cypriot financial crisis|Cyprus]], [[Greek government-debt crisis|Greece]], [[Post-2008 Irish economic downturn|Ireland]], [[2010–13 Portuguese financial crisis|Portugal]] and [[Economy of Romania#2009 IMF loan|Romania]]. In comparison, [[2008–14 Spanish financial crisis|Spain]] was not considered to be a "Programme country" in 2013, due to only receiving financial assistance for bank recapitalizations and not any macroeconomic financial assistance.&lt;ref name="Review of the 6-pack and 2-pack legislation"/&gt;

==Implementation==
The Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure was triggered the first time with the publication of the Alert Mechanism Report in February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-12-132_en.htm|title=Commission's first Alert Mechanism Report: tackling macroeconomic imbalances in the EU|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the analysis in the report, the European Commission carried out in-depth reviews for twelve EU member states. The countries included were: [[Belgium]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Cyprus]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Hungary]], [[Slovenia]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. The analysis confirmed that these EU member states faced macroeconomic imbalances of different nature. But none were considered excessive, therefore no Excessive Imbalance Procedure was launched.&lt;ref name="IDR 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-12-388_en.htm|title=Following in-depth reviews, Commission calls on Member States to tackle macroeconomic imbalances|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'preventive arm' of the MIP was however activated, with the recommended policy responses to the imbalances being integrated in the set of Country-Specific Recommendations addressed to member states under the [[Europe 2020#The European Semester|European Semester]]. These recommendations were endorsed by the [[European Council]] in June and subsequently adopted by the [[Council of the European Union|Council of Ministers]] in July 2012.

On 28 November 2012 the second Alert Mechanism Report was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-12-912_en.htm|title=Second Alert Mechanism Report on macroeconomic imbalances in EU Member States|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the report, the Commission decided to review the progress in all of the twelve member states initially reviewed in 2012. They were therefore all selected again for an In-Depth Review. In addition, the Commission also started in-depth reviews for [[Malta]] and the [[Netherlands]]. On 10 April 2013, the Commission published the in-depth reviews&lt;ref name="MIP"/&gt; and concluded that excessive imbalances exist in [[Spain]] and [[Slovenia]].&lt;ref name="IDR 2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipex.eu/IPEXL-WEB/dossier/document/COM20130199.do|title=COM/2013/0199 - COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL AND TO THE EUROGROUP: Results of in-depth reviews under Regulation (EU) No 1176/2011 on the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances|publisher=European Commission|date=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-13-313_en.htm|title=Commission concludes in-depth reviews of macroeconomic imbalances in 13 Member States|accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its meeting on 14 May 2013, the Council of the European Union however stated that the European Commission should first review the national reform programmes of these countries, and on this basis it would then be assessed whether additional policy measures were necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://economics.rabobank.com/publications/2013/august/why-the-eurozone-needs--stronger-institutions/|title=Why the eurozone needs stronger institutions|publisher=Rabobank Economic Research Department|date=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Slovenian Prime Minister stated on 23 May:
"We have the feeling the Commission believes submitting us to this [Excessive Imbalance] procedure will be a help to our country. This is not the case, in my estimate, and I believe it would be much better that Slovenia can on its own without any supervision resolve its problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ft.com/brusselsblog/2013/05/23/will-slovenia-be-next-weeks-brussels-target/|title=Will Slovenia be next week’s Brussels target?|publisher=Financial Times|date=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 May 2013, after the national reform programmes of Spain and Slovenia had been reviewed, the Commission found those programmes to be sufficient;&lt;ref name="No EIPs in 2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-13-481_en.htm|title=Press Speaking Points at the European Semester Press Conference (SPEECH/13/481, 29/05/2013)|publisher=European Commission|date=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus refrained from launching an Excessive Imbalance Procedure towards Spain and Slovenia.&lt;ref name="No EIPs in 2013 -confirmed by secondary source"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://economics.rabobank.com/publications/2013/november/alert-mechanism-report-2014/|title=Will the Alert Mechanism Report 2014 improve economic rebalancing?|publisher=Rabobank Economic Research Department|date=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the third Alert Mechanism Report published in November 2013, the Commission announced a new round of in-depth reviews for the countries already under scrutiny, but widened these reviews to [[Germany]], [[Croatia]], and [[Luxembourg]], as well as to [[Ireland]] immediately after exit from its [[Post-2008 Irish economic downturn|assistance programme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-970_en.htm|title=Third Alert Mechanism Report on macroeconomic imbalances in EU Member States|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 2014, the Commission concluded that it found no imbalances in [[Denmark]], [[Malta]] and [[Luxembourg]], while the remaining countries were experiencing imbalances. Imbalances in [[Spain]] were not considered excessive any more. Imbalances in [[Italy]], [[Croatia]], and [[Slovenia]] were however experienced as excessive, with decisions to be taken in June 2014 on subsequent steps under the MIP - meaning those three countries are in risk of facing the opening up of EIP's.&lt;ref name="IDR 2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/economic_governance/documents/2014-03-05_in-depth_reviews_communication_en.pdf|title=Results of in-depth reviews under Regulation (EU) No 1176/2011 on the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances|date=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The joint decision by the Commission and Council whether or not to open up EIP's, will be taken in conjunction with the publication of the Country-Specific Recommendations in the context of the European Semester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/economic_governance/macroeconomic_imbalance_procedure/index_en.htm|title=Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 June 2014 the Commission announced for the three countries identified with excessive imbalance: "we have found that their national reform programmes appropriately address the main challenges we identified in March. That's why we are not proposing to launch the Excessive Imbalances Procedure for these three Member States. We will however monitor very closely the implementation of today’s detailed "Country Specific Recommendations", so as to provide the same support for the reform process in these countries, as we have over the past year for Spain and Slovenia, where progress has been very encouraging".&lt;ref name="No EIPs in 2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-14-419_en.htm|title=Speaking points by Vice-President Olli Rehn at the Press Conference on the Country Specific Recommendations (SPEECH/14/419, 02/06/2014)|publisher=European Commission|date=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===List of Excessive Imbalance surveillance reports===
These surveillance reports listed below, published at regular intervals by the European Commission for states found to be in ''Excessive Imbalance'', were crafted to check the country-specific progress of implementing mitigating reforms (as outlined by their annual ''National Reform Programme'' report). Each states period with extended surveillance, span from the time the Commission became aware of the existence of ''Excessive Imbalance'', until the point of time when their ''In-Depth Review'' report (published annually in February/March) finds the ''Excessive Imbalance'' no longer exist.

==The scoreboard==
The scoreboard&lt;ref name="MIP_scoreboard"/&gt; in the Alert Mechanism Report is currently made up of eleven indicators that monitor external imbalances and competitiveness, as well as internal imbalances. The indicators in the scoreboard ensure an early identification of imbalances that emerge over the short term in addition to those that arise due to structural and long-term trends. Since 2015, the scoreboard comprises 14 headline indicators for which indicative thresholds have been set. In addition the scoreboard comprises 28 auxiliary indicators without thresholds, that help to qualify its economic reading.&lt;ref name="Eurostat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/The_Macroeconomic_Imbalance_Procedure_(MIP)_introduced#MIP_indicators_through_the_years|title=MIP indicators through the years, in: The Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure (MIP) introduced|publisher=Eurostat|date=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The design of the scoreboard is as follows:

'''External imbalances and competitiveness'''
*	3 year average of the [[current account balance]] as a percentage of GDP, with an indicative threshold of +6% and -4%.
*	[[Net international investment position]] (NIIP) as a percentage of GDP, with an indicative threshold of -35%. The NIIP shows the difference between a country's external financial assets and its external financial liabilities.
*	5 year percent change of export market shares measured in values, with an indicative threshold of -6%.
*	3 year percent change in nominal [[unit labor cost]], with indicative thresholds of +9% for euro area countries and +12% for non-euro area countries.
*	3 year percent change in [[Trade Weighted Effective Exchange Rate Index|real effective exchange rates]] (REER) based on [[HICP]] deflators, relative to 41 other industrial countries, with indicative thresholds of -/+5% for euro area countries and -/+11% for non-euro area countries. The REER shows price competitiveness relative to the main trading partners.

'''Internal imbalances'''
*	private sector debt (consolidated) as a percentage of GDP, with an indicative threshold of 133%.
*	private sector credit flow (consolidated) as a percentage of GDP, with an indicative threshold of 15%.
*	year-on-year percentage change in deflated [[House price index|house prices]], with an indicative threshold of 6%.
*	[[public debt|public sector debt]] as a percentage of GDP, with an [[Stability and Growth Pact|indicative threshold of 60%]].
*	year-on-year percent change in total financial liabilities of the [[financial sector]], with an indicative threshold of 16.5%.

'''Social Indicators'''
*	3-year average of the [[unemployment rate]], with an indicative threshold of 10%.
*	3-year change of the [[Economic activity rate|activity rate]], with an indicative threshold of -0.2 pp.
*	3-year change of the long-term unemployment rate, with an indicative threshold of 0.5 pp.
*	3-year change of the [[Youth_unemployment|youth unemployment]] rate, with an indicative threshold of 2 pp.


==Legal basis==
The Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure is based on two Regulations that are part of the '[[Sixpack (European Union law)|six-pack]]' to improve economic governance in the EU. The first is Regulation 1176/2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:306:0025:0032:EN:PDF|title=Regulation (EU) No 1176/2011 on the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which lays out the details of the surveillance procedure and covers all EU member states. The second is Regulation 1174/2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:306:0008:0011:EN:PDF|title=Regulation (EU) No 1174/2011 on enforcement measures to correct excessive macroeconomic imbalances in the euro area|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which focuses on enforcement, including the possibility of sanctions, and only applies to euro area member states.

== Quality of statistics underlying the MIP ==
The (ECOFIN) Council of the European Union, in its 2015 conclusions on EU statistics, recalled that the Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure must rely upon sound and harmonised official statistics. The Council welcomed the close cooperation of the [[European Statistical System|ESS]] and the [[European System of Central Banks|ESCB]], using existing fora, in ensuring the reliability of the statistics underlying the Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure (MIP) and their comparability, welcomed the production of the first [http://www.cmfb.org/publications/mip-documents ESS-ESCB quality report on MIP statistics] and encouraged the two statistical systems to give high priority to taking forward this programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-15003-2015-INIT/en/pdf|title=ECOFIN Council Conclusions on EU Statistics 2015|last=|first=|date=8 December 2015|website=|publisher=|access-date=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12170">The terms [[monism]] and dualism are used to describe two different theories of the relationship between [[international law]] and national law. Many states, perhaps most, are partly monist and partly dualist in their actual application of international law in their national systems.

== Monism ==

Monists accept that the internal and international legal systems form a unity. Both national legal rules and international rules that a state has accepted, for example by way of a treaty, determine whether actions are legal or illegal.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pieter Kooijmans]], International publiekrecht in vogelvlucht, Wolters-Noordhoff, Groningen, 1994, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; In most so-called "monist" states, a distinction between international law in the form of treaties, and other international law, e.g., customary international law or [[jus cogens]], is made; such states may thus be partly monist and partly dualist.
State sovereignty as well.
In a pure monist state, international law does not need to be translated into national law.  It is just incorporated and has effect automatically in national or domestic laws. The act of ratifying an international treaty immediately incorporates the law into national law; and customary international law is treated as part of national law as well. International law can be directly applied by a national judge, and can be directly invoked by citizens, just as if it were national law. A judge can declare a national rule invalid if it contradicts international rules because, in some states, the latter have priority. In other states, like in Germany, treaties have the same effect as legislation, and by the principle of ''[[List of Latin legal terms#L|Lex posterior derogat priori]]'' ("''Later law removes the earlier''"), only take precedence over national legislation enacted prior to their ratification. In its most pure form, monism dictates that national law that contradicts international law is null and void, even if it post-dates international law, and even if it is [[constitutional]] in nature.
From a [[human rights]] point of view, for example, this has some advantages. Suppose a country has accepted a human rights treaty - the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] for instance - but some of its national laws limit the [[freedom of the press]]. A citizen of that country, who is being prosecuted by his state for violating this national law, can invoke the human rights treaty in a national courtroom and can ask the judge to apply this treaty and to decide that the national law is invalid. He or she does not have to wait for national law that translates international law. His or her government can, after all, be negligent or even unwilling to translate. The treaty was perhaps only accepted for political reasons, in order to please donor-countries for example.{{Clarify|reason=Not clear what "donor-countries" is referring to|date=March 2018}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"So when someone in The Netherlands feels his human rights are being violated he can go to a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] judge and the judge must apply the law of the [[European Convention on Human Rights|Convention]]. He must apply international law even if it is not in conformity with Dutch law".&lt;ref&gt;G.J. Wiarda, in [[Antonio Cassese]], International Law in a Divided World, Clarendon Press, [[Oxford]], 1992, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Dualism ==

Dualists emphasize the difference between national and international law, and require the translation of the latter into the former. Without this translation, international law does not exist as law. International law has to be national law as well, or it is no law at all. If a state accepts a treaty but does not adapt its national law in order to conform to the treaty or does not create a national law explicitly incorporating the treaty, then it violates international law. But one cannot claim that the treaty has become part of national law. Citizens cannot rely on it and judges cannot apply it. National laws that contradict it remain in force. According to dualists, national judges never apply international law, only international law that has been translated into national law.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"International law as such can confer no rights cognisable in the municipal courts. It is only insofar as the rules of international law are recognized as included in the rules of municipal law that they are allowed in municipal courts to give rise to rights and obligations".&lt;ref&gt;[[James Atkin, Baron Atkin]], in M. Akehurst, Modern Introduction to International Law, Harper Collins, [[London]], p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The supremacy of international law is a rule in dualist systems as it is in monist systems. Sir [[Hersch Lauterpacht]] pointed out the Court's determination to discourage the evasion of international obligations, and its repeated affirmation of:

{{quote|the self-evident principle of international law that a State cannot invoke its municipal law as the reason for the non-fulfillment of its international obligations.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://books.google.com/books?id=piU8AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA261&amp;ots=Og6Yhjh177&amp;pg=PA262#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Development of International Law by the International Court''], Hersch Lauterpacht (ed), Cambridge University Press, 1982, {{ISBN|0-521-46332-7}}, page 262&lt;/ref&gt;}}

If international law is not directly applicable, as is the case in dualist systems, then it must be translated into national law, and existing national law that contradicts international law must be "translated away". It must be modified or eliminated in order to conform to international law.
Again, from a human rights point of view, if a human rights treaty is accepted for purely political reasons, and states do not intend to fully translate it into national law or to take a monist view on international law, then the implementation of the treaty is very uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;[[Antonio Cassese]], International Law in a Divided World, Clarendon Press, [[Oxford]], 1992, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The problem of "lex posterior" ===

In dualist systems, international law must be translated into national law, and existing national law that contradicts international law must be "translated away". It must be modified or eliminated in order to conform to international law. However, the need for translation in dualist system causes a problem with regard to national laws voted after the act of translation. 
In a monist system, a national law that is voted after an international law has been accepted and that contradicts the international law, becomes automatically null and void at the moment it is voted. The international rule continues to prevail. In a dualist system, however, the original international law has been translated into national law - if all went well - but this national law can then be overridden by another national law on the principle of "[[lex posterior derogat legi priori]]", the later law replaces the earlier one. This means that the country - willingly or unwillingly - violates international law.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pieter Kooijmans]], Internationaal publiekrecht in vogelvlucht, Wolters-Noordhoff, Groningen, 1994, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; A dualist system requires continuous screening of all subsequent national law for possible incompatibility with earlier international law.

== Examples ==

In some countries, such as the UK for instance, the dualist view is predominant. International law is only part of British national law once it is accepted in national law. A treaty

:"has no effect in municipal law until an [[Act of Parliament]] is passed to give effect to it.

In other countries this distinction tends to be blurred. In the vast majority of democratic countries outside the Commonwealth, the legislature, or part of the legislature, participates in the process of [[ratification]], so that ratification becomes a legislative act, and the treaty becomes effective in international law and in municipal law simultaneously. For instance, the [[Constitution of the United States]] provides that the President

:'shall have power, by and with the advice and consent of the [[United States Senate|Senate]], to make treaties, provided two-thirds of the Senators present concur'.

Treaties ratified in accordance with the Constitution automatically become part of the municipal law of the USA".&lt;ref&gt;M. Akehurst, Modern Introduction to International Law, Harper Collins, [[London]], p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States of America has a "mixed" monist-dualist system; international law applies directly in US courts in some instances but not others.  US Constitution, art. VI, does indeed say that treaties are part of the Supreme Law of the Land, as suggested by the quote above; however, its Supreme Court, as late as the recent case of ''[[Medellín v. Texas]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Medellín v. Texas|volume=552|page=491|pin=|year=2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; has restated that some treaties are not "self-executing."  Such treaties must be implemented by statute before their provisions may be given effect by national and sub-national courts.  Similarly with regard to customary international law, its Supreme Court stated, in the case of the Pacquete Habana (1900), that "international law is part of our law."  However, it also said that international law would not be applied if there is a controlling legislative, executive, or judicial act to the contrary...&lt;ref&gt;"Basic Concepts of Public International Law - Monism &amp; Dualism", ed. Marko Novakovic, Belgrade 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== A matter of national legal tradition ==

International law does not determine which point of view is to be preferred, monism or dualism. Every state decides for itself, according to its legal traditions. International law only requires that its rules are respected, and states are free to decide on the manner in which they want to respect these rules and make them binding on its citizens and agencies.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[T]he transformation of international norms into domestic law is not necessary from the point of view of international law…the necessity of transformation is a question of national, not of international law".&lt;ref&gt;[[Antonio Cassese]], International Law in a Divided World, Clarendon Press, [[Oxford]], 1992, pp. 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Both a monist state and a dualist state can comply with international law. All one can say is that a monist state is less at risk of violating international rules, because its judges can apply international law directly.&lt;ref name="Kooijmans_83"&gt;[[Pieter Kooijmans]], Internationaal publiekrecht in vogelvlucht, Wolters-Noordhoff, Groningen, 1994, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Negligence or unwillingness to implement international law in national law can only pose a problem in dualist states. 
States are free to choose the way in which they want to respect international law, but they are always accountable if they fail to adapt their national legal system in a way that they can respect international law. Either they adopt a constitution that implements a monist system so that international law can be applied directly and without transformation, or they do not. But then they have to translate all international law in national law. 
In a monist state we rely only on the judges and not on the legislators, but judges can also make mistakes. If a judge in a monist states makes mistakes when applying international law, then the country violates international law just as much as a dualist country that, for one reason or another, does not allow its judges to apply international law directly and fails to translate or fails to translate correctly and effectively.&lt;ref name="Kooijmans_83"/&gt; One reason for preferring dualism is precisely the fear that national judges are not familiar with international law - a highly complex field of law - and hence are liable to make mistakes.

The '''Nonbusiness energy property tax credit''', in the United States, provides a nonrefundable personal [[tax credit]] for [[Income tax in the United States|Federal income tax purposes]], for making a home more energy efficient. (Unlike a deduction, which lowers taxable income, a tax credit reduces the actual tax paid, dollar-for-dollar.) This credit was added to the [[Internal Revenue Code]] by the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]].&lt;ref&gt;.01 Section 1333 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-58, 119 Stat. 594.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Credit ==
Nonbusiness energy property provides a credit for buying qualified energy efficiency improvements &lt;ref&gt;26 U.S.C. § 25C(a)(1).&lt;/ref&gt; and provides credits in various amounts for costs relating to residential energy property expenses.26 U.S.C. § 25C(a)(2). Labor costs for onsite preparation, assembly, or original installation are included as eligible expenses for certain items.&lt;ref&gt;26 U.S.C. § 25C(d)&lt;/ref&gt;
klk

== Eligibility ==
For an improvement to be eligible for the credit it must meet the following qualifications: (1) a component must meet or exceed the criteria established by the 2009 International Energy Conservation Code; (2) component is installed in or on a dwelling unit located in the United States and owned and used by the taxpayer as the taxpayer’s principal residence; (3) the original use of such component commences with the taxpayer and (4) such component reasonably can be expected to remain in use for at least 5 years. &lt;ref&gt; 26 U.S.C. § 25C(c)(1). &lt;/ref&gt;

Residential energy property expenditures are eligible for the credit if the purchase: (1) is installed on or in connection with a dwelling unit located in the United States and owned by the taxpayer and used as his principal residence (section 121); (2) the item is originally placed in service by the taxpayer and (3) it is qualified energy property as defined by 26 U.S.C. § 25C(d)(2)(a) that meets certain performance and quality standards established by the code or by the Secretary.&lt;ref&gt;26 U.S.C. § 25C(d)(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limits ==
A tax credit of up to $500 is available to individuals for nonbusiness energy property, such as residential exterior doors and windows, insulation, heat pumps, furnaces, central air conditioners, and water heaters. 

a. The credit varies depending on the type of improvement.
b. There is a lifetime credit of $500.
c. The improvements must be installed in the taxpayer's principal residence in the United States.

== Termination of credit ==
Items must be placed in service before Jan. 1, 2018 to be eligible for the credit. &lt;ref&gt;26 U.S.C. § 25C(g).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Product liability''' is the area of law in which manufacturers, distributors, suppliers, retailers, and others who make [[Product (business)|product]]s available to the public are held responsible for the injuries those products cause.   Although the word "product" has broad connotations, product liability as an area of law is traditionally limited to products in the form of tangible personal [[property]].&lt;ref&gt;Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability, § 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In the United States, the majority of product liability laws are determined at the state level and vary widely from state to state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Logan |first1=Michael A. |last2=Mayer |first2=Zach T. |last3=Fisher |first3=Brian J. |title=Products Liability: Protection for the "Innocent" Seller in Texas |journal=National Law Journal |date=5 August 2010 |url=https://www.natlawreview.com/article/products-liability-protection-innocent-seller-texas |accessdate=11 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each type of product liability claim requires proof of different elements in order to present a valid claim.

===History===
Of the various [[U.S. state]]s, [[California]] was the first to throw away the fiction of a warranty and to boldly assert the doctrine of strict liability in [[tort]] for defective products, in the Supreme Court of California's decision in ''Greenman v. Yuba Power Products'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C2/59C2d57.htm 59 Cal. 2d 57] (1963) (in which the [[majority opinion]] was authored by then-Associate Justice [[Roger J. Traynor]]). The Greenman decision was highly influential on the development of product liability law in other states.&lt;ref&gt;White, Robert Jeffrey. "[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Top+10+in+torts%3A+evolution+in+the+common+law.-a018526923 Top 10 in torts: evolution in the common law.]" ''Trial'' 32, no. 7 (July 1996): 50-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Greenman'', Traynor cited to his own earlier [[concurring opinion]] in ''[[Escola v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co.]]'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C2/24C2d453.htm 24 Cal. 2d 453, 462] (1944) (Traynor, J., concurring).  In ''Escola'', now widely recognized as a landmark case in American law,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Lawrence M. Friedman, ''American Law in the 20th Century'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004), 356-357, and Jay M. Feinman, ''Law 101: Everything You Need to Know About the American Legal System'', rev. ed. (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006), 165-168.&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Traynor laid the foundation for ''Greenman'' with these words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Even if there is no negligence, however, public policy demands that responsibility be fixed wherever it will most effectively reduce the hazards to life and health inherent in defective products that reach the market. It is evident that the manufacturer can anticipate some hazards and guard against the recurrence of others, as the public cannot. Those who suffer injury from defective products are unprepared to meet its consequences. The cost of an injury and the loss of time or health may be an overwhelming misfortune to the person injured, and a needless one, for the risk of injury can be insured by the manufacturer and distributed among the public as a cost of doing business. It is to the public interest to discourage the marketing of products having defects that are a menace to the public. If such products nevertheless find their way into the market it is to the public interest to place the responsibility for whatever injury they may cause upon the manufacturer, who, even if he is not negligent in the manufacture of the product, is responsible for its reaching the market. However intermittently such injuries may occur and however haphazardly they may strike, the risk of their occurrence is a constant risk and a general one. Against such a risk there should be general and constant protection and the manufacturer is best situated to afford such protection.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The year after ''Greenman'', the Supreme Court of California proceeded to extend strict liability to ''all'' parties involved in the manufacturing, distribution, and sale of defective products (including retailers)&lt;ref&gt;''Vandermark v. Ford Motor Co.'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C2/61C2d256.htm 61 Cal. 2d 256] (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1969 made it clear that such defendants were liable not only to direct customers and users, but also to any innocent bystanders randomly injured by defective products.&lt;ref&gt;''Elmore v. American Motors Corp.'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C2/70C2d578.htm 70 Cal. 2d 578] (1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many jurisdictions have been swayed by Justice Traynor's arguments on behalf of the strict liability rule in ''Escola'', ''Greenman'', and subsequent cases.  In the 40 years after ''Greenman'', the highest courts of nearly all U.S. states and territories followed California's example in imposing strict liability on manufacturers, distributors, and retailers for defective products.  In a landmark 1986 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court embraced strict liability for defective products by adopting it as part of [[United States admiralty law|federal admiralty law]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[East River S. S. Corp. v. Transamerica Delaval Inc.]]'', {{ussc|476|858|1986}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the ''Greenman'' rule was adopted by many other states through Section 402A of the [[Restatement of Torts, Second]] (published in 1964 after ''Greenman''), the [[Supreme Court of California]] refused to adopt Section 402A's "unreasonably dangerous" limitation upon strict liability in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;''Cronin v. J.B.E. Olson Corp.'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C3/8C3d121.htm 8 Cal. 3d 121] (1972).&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, strict liability in California is truly strict, in that the plaintiff need not show that the defect was unreasonable or dangerous.  On the other hand, in California, the defendant is allowed to introduce evidence in a strict products liability action that the plaintiff contributed to his or her own injuries.&lt;ref&gt;''Daly v. General Motors Corp.'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C3/20C3d725.htm 20 Cal. 3d 725] (1978).&lt;/ref&gt;

California's courts continue to follow the standard set forth in ''Greenman''.  In 2002 the [[California Supreme Court]] held that strict liability for defective products applies to makers of component products that are installed into and sold as part of [[real property]].&lt;ref&gt;''Jimenez v. Superior Court (T.M. Cobb Co.)'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C4/29C4t473.htm 29 Cal. 4th 473] (2002) (finding window manufacturers liable to homebuyers for defective windows that had been installed by developers into new homes).&lt;/ref&gt; However, strict liability is not limitless.  In 2012, the Court held that manufacturers are liable under strict liability and negligence only for defects in their products, as distinguished from other products that could potentially be used in association with their products.&lt;ref&gt;''O'Neil v. Crane Co.'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C4/53C4t335.htm 53 Cal. 4th 335] (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of liability===
Section 2 of the ''Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability'' distinguishes between three major types of product liability claims:

*  Manufacturing defect
*  Design defect
*  Failure to warn (also known as marketing defects)

However, in most states, these are not legal claims in and of themselves, but are pleaded in terms of the theories mentioned above.  For example, a plaintiff might plead negligent failure to warn or strict liability for defective design.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Merrill v. Navegar, Inc.'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C4/26C4t465.htm 26 Cal. 4th 465] (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;
*  Manufacturing defects are those that occur in the manufacturing process and usually involve poor-quality materials or shoddy [[Skill|workmanship]].  
*  Design defects occur where the product design is inherently dangerous or useless (and hence defective) no matter how carefully manufactured; this may be demonstrated either by showing that the product fails to satisfy ordinary consumer expectations as to what constitutes a safe product, or that the risks of the product outweigh its benefits.&lt;ref&gt;''Barker v. Lull Engineering,'' [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C3/20C3d413.htm 20 Cal. 3d 413] (1978).&lt;/ref&gt; 
*  Failure-to-warn defects arise in products that carry inherent nonobvious dangers. These can be mitigated through adequate warnings to the user, and these dangers are present regardless of how well the product is manufactured and designed for its intended purpose. This also includes fail to provide relevant product instructions or sufficient product warnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Noel |first1=Dix W. |title=Products Defective because of Inadequate Directions or Warnings |journal=Southwestern Law Journal |date=1969 |volume=23 |pages=256 |url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/smulr23&amp;div=29&amp;id=&amp;page= |accessdate=11 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theories of liability===
In the United States, the claims most commonly associated with product liability are [[negligence]], [[strict liability]], [[breach of warranty]], and various [[consumer protection]] claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Larson |first1=Aaron |title=Product Liability Law: Protecting People from Defective Products |url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/product_liability/product_liability.html |website=ExpertLaw |accessdate=11 August 2018 |date=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Breach of warranty====
Warranties are statements by a manufacturer or seller concerning a product during a commercial transaction.  Warranty claims commonly require [[privity]] between the injured party and the manufacturer or seller; in [[plain English]], this means they must be dealing with each other directly. Breach of warranty-based product liability claims usually focus on one of three types:
#Breach of an [[express warranty]],
#Breach of an [[implied warranty]] of merchantability, and
#Breach of an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.
Express warranty claims focus on express statements by the manufacturer or the seller concerning the product (e.g., "This chainsaw is useful to cut turkeys").

The various implied warranties cover those expectations common to all products (e.g., that a tool is not unreasonably dangerous when used for its proper purpose), unless specifically disclaimed by the manufacturer or the seller. Claims involving real estate may also be brought under a theory of implied warranty of habitability.

====Negligence====
A basic [[negligence]] claim consists of proof of

# a duty owed,
# a breach of that duty,
# the breach was the cause in fact of the plaintiff's injury (actual cause)
# the breach proximately caused the plaintiff's injury.
# and the plaintiff suffered actual quantifiable injury (damages).

As demonstrated in cases such as ''[[Winterbottom v. Wright]]'', the scope of the duty of care was limited to those with whom one was in privity. Later cases like ''[[MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.]]'' broadened the duty of care to all who could be foreseeably injured by one's conduct.

Over time, negligence concepts have arisen to deal with certain specific situations, including [[negligence per se|negligence ''per se'']] (using a manufacturer's violation of a law or regulation, in place of proof of a duty and a breach) and [[res ipsa loquitur]] (an inference of negligence under certain conditions).

====Strict liability====
{{Main|Strict liability}}
Rather than focus on the behavior of the manufacturer (as in negligence), strict liability claims focus on the product itself.  Under strict liability, the manufacturer is liable if the product is defective, even if the manufacturer was not negligent in making that product defective.

The difficulty with negligence is that it still requires the plaintiff to prove that the defendant's conduct fell below the relevant standard of care.  However, if an entire industry tacitly settles on a somewhat careless standard of conduct (that is, as analyzed from the perspective of a layperson), then the plaintiff may not be able to recover even though he or she is severely injured, because although the defendant's conduct ''caused'' his or her injuries, such conduct was not negligent in the legal sense (if everyone within the trade would inevitably testify that the defendant's conduct conformed to that of a reasonable tradeperson in such circumstances).  As a practical matter, with the increasing complexity of products, injuries, and medical care (which made many formerly fatal injuries survivable), it is quite a difficult and expensive task to find and retain good expert witnesses who can establish the standard of care, breach, and causation.

Therefore, in the 1940s and 1950s, many American courts departed from the ''MacPherson'' standard and decided that it was too harsh to require seriously injured consumer plaintiffs to prove negligence claims against manufacturers or retailers. To avoid having to deny such plaintiffs any relief, these courts began to look for facts in their cases which they could characterize as an express or implied warranty from the manufacturer to the consumer.  The ''[[res ipsa loquitur]]'' doctrine was also stretched to reduce the plaintiff's burden of proof.  Over time, the resulting [[legal fiction]]s became increasingly strained.

====Consumer protection====
In addition to common law remedies, many states have enacted consumer protection statutes that provide specific remedies for a variety of product defects. Under the product liabiity "economic loss rule", strict liability is generally unavailable for products that damage only themselves. Statutory remedies may apply to defects that merely render the product unusable (and hence cause economic injury) but do not cause physical injury or damage to other property.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The best known examples of consumer protection laws for product defects are [[lemon law]]s, which provide protection to purchasers of defective new vehicles and, in a small number of states, used vehicles.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Worldwide==

In most nations legislatures have taken the lead in imposing strict liability for defective products.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} The courts of several countries, including Canada and South Africa, have rejected attempts by lawyers to persuade them to follow California's ''Greenman'' holding.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===China===
[[China]] first enacted a Product Quality Law in October 1993 in an attempt to impose strict liability, but the law was badly drafted and was quite weak.  After numerous product scandals throughout the 2000s, China finally enacted a much stronger Tort Liability Act in December 2009, followed by a Statute on the Choice of Substantive Law in Foreign-Related Civil Relationships in April 2011, which enables Chinese consumers injured by foreign-made products to request that Chinese courts apply the law of the defendant's place of business.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}  While these two laws are still relatively ineffective against large Chinese manufacturers who are [[Government-owned corporation|state-owned enterprises]] (as the defendant can simply have the product defect declared a [[Classified information|state secret]] and then have the plaintiff prosecuted for revealing state secrets), they will enable Chinese consumers to seek some compensation from non-state companies as well as foreign manufacturers.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===Europe===
In Europe, a movement towards strict liability began with the [[Council of Europe]] [[Convention on Products Liability in regard to Personal Injury and Death]] (the '''Strasbourg Convention''') in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=European Convention on Products Liability in regard to Personal Injury and Death |year=1977 |publisher=Council of Europe |accessdate=2008-04-30 |url=http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/091.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 25, 1985, the [[European Economic Community]] adopted the [[Product Liability Directive]].  In language similar to Traynor's, the Directive stated that "liability without fault on the part of the producer is the sole means of adequately solving the problem, peculiar to our age of increasing technicality, of a fair apportionment of the risks inherent in modern technological production."  However, the Directive also gave each member state the option of imposing a liability cap of 70 million [[euro]]s per defect.  The Directive only imposed strict liability upon manufacturers or importers, and deviated significantly from the U.S. model by refusing to impose strict liability on purely domestic distributors or retailers.

===Other nations===
The legislatures of many other countries outside the EEC subsequently enacted strict liability regimes based on the European model (that is, generally applying only to manufacturers and importers), including [[Israel]] (March 1980, based on an early proposed draft of the Directive), [[Brazil]] (September 1990), [[Peru]] (November 1991), [[Australia]] (July 1992), [[Russia]] (February 1992), [[Switzerland]] (December 1992), [[Argentina]] (October 1993), [[Japan]] (June 1994), [[Taiwan]] (June 1994), [[Malaysia]] (August 1999), [[South Korea]] (January 2000), [[Thailand]] (December 2007), and [[South Africa]] (April 2009).{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Debate over strict liability laws==

Advocates of strict liability laws argue that strict products liability causes manufacturers to internalize costs they would normally [[externality|externalize]]. Strict liability thus requires manufacturers to evaluate the full costs of their products. In this way, strict liability provides a mechanism for ensuring that a product's absolute good outweighs its absolute harm.

Between two parties who are not negligent (manufacturer and consumer), one will necessarily shoulder the costs of product defects. Proponents say it is preferable to place the economic costs on the manufacturer because it can better absorb them and pass them on to other consumers. The manufacturer thus becomes a de facto insurer against its defective products, with premiums built into the product's price.

Strict liability also seeks to diminish the impact of [[information asymmetry]] between manufacturers and consumers. Manufacturers have better knowledge of their own products' dangers than do consumers. Therefore, manufacturers properly bear the burden of finding, correcting, and warning consumers of those dangers.

Strict liability reduces [[litigation]] costs, because a [[plaintiff]] need only prove [[Causation (law)|causation]], not imprudence. Where causation is easy to establish, parties to a strict liability suit will most likely settle, because only damages are in dispute.

Critics charge that strict liability creates risk of [[moral hazard]]. They claim that strict liability causes consumers to under invest in care even when they are the least-cost avoiders. This, they say, results in a lower aggregate level of care than under a negligence standard. Proponents counter that people have enough natural incentive to avoid inflicting serious harm on themselves to mitigate this concern.

Critics charge that the requiring manufacturers to internalize costs they would otherwise externalize increases the price of goods. Critics claim that in [[Elasticity (economics)|elastic]], price-sensitive markets, price increases cause some consumers to seek substitutes for that product. As a result, they say, manufacturers may not produce the socially optimal level of goods. Proponents respond that these consumer opt outs reflect a product whose absolute harm outweighs its absolute value; products that do more harm than good ought not be produced.

In the [[law and economics]] literature, there is a debate about whether liability and regulation are substitutes or complements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kolstad|first=Charles D.|last2=Ulen|first2=Thomas S.|last3=Johnson|first3=Gary V.|date=1990|title=Ex Post Liability for Harm vs. Ex Ante Safety Regulation: Substitutes or Complements?|jstor=2006714|journal=The American Economic Review|volume=80|issue=4|pages=888–901}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ewerhart|first=Christian|last2=Schmitz|first2=Patrick W.|date=1998|title=Ex Post Liability for Harm vs. Ex Ante Safety Regulation: Substitutes or Complements?

If they are complements, then the joint use of liability and regulation is optimal.

{{refimprove|date=April 2007}}
In [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], '''publicans''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]] τελώνης ''telōnēs'' (singular); [[Latin language|Latin]] ''publicanus'' (singular); ''publicani'' (plural)) were public contractors, in which role they often supplied the [[Roman legion]]s and military, managed the collection of port duties, and oversaw public building projects. In addition, they served as [[tax collector]]s for the Republic (and later the [[Roman Empire]]), bidding on contracts (from the Senate in Rome) for the collection of various types of taxes. Importantly, this role as tax collectors was not emphasized until late into the history of the Republic (c. 1st century BC). The publicans were usually of the class of [[equites]].

The legacy of the Roman Republic continues to provide inspiration for the operation of modern governments, as the Romans first witnessed the challenges associated with the management of large territorial areas and populations in a more or less sustainable fashion. The era of the Roman Republic began with the overthrowing of the kings around 500 BC and ended with the beginning of the imperial rule of the Caesars in 27 BC. During the republican era, civil service, which was the size of modern middle-sized city governments, dealt with organising public policy for nearly thirty million people. The solution for the day-to-day operation of public administration was the extensive use of private contracting in the implementation of public policies. The earliest accounts of contracting describe contracts for feeding sacred hens, which were honoured for warning the citizens of Rome of approaching enemies, on the hill of Capitolium in Rome in 390 BC.{{sfn|Badian|1983}}

Private organisations, societas publicanorum, and their managers, the publicani, took care of most public duties, such as constructing public buildings, supplying equipment for the army, operating mines, and, most importantly, collecting taxes. The societies participated in tenders for public duties. Those who offered the lowest price won construction deals, and those who guaranteed the highest amount of collected taxes for the senate succeeded in tax collection tenders. The management structure of the societies represented a core-periphery structure with a relatively small permanent management structure and a large short-term operative work-force, which could be adjusted according to successes and losses in consecutive competitive tenders. The societas publicanorum were probably the first type of limited liability shareholder-owned companies. This arrangement makes Societas Publicanorum one of the first examples of hybrid organization or public-private partnership. A legal structure for limiting liability in purely private business activity did not exist at the time. To limit personal liability, which could lead to slavery and the confiscation of all personal property, early entrepreneurs invented the practice of common slave ownership, in which a jointly owned slave served as chief executive officer of the enterprise. As slaves were ‘things’ responsible for only their own cost, they liberated the owners of their personal liabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrike Malmendier 2009. Law and the finance at the origin. Journal of economic Literature.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
At the height of the [[Roman republic|Republic]]'s era of provincial expansion (roughly the 1st and 2nd centuries BC until the end of the Republic) the Roman [[tax farming]] system was very profitable for the publicani. The right to collect taxes for a particular region would be auctioned every few years for a value that (in theory) approximated the tax available for collection in that region. The payment to Rome was treated as a loan and the publicani would receive interest on their payment at the end of the collection period. In addition, any excess (over their bid) tax collected would be pure profit for the publicani. The principal risk to the publicani was that the tax collected would be less than the sum bid.

In the Roman Republic, the distinction between politics and business was clear-cut. Senators could not take part in the management of the societas publicanorum or other business activities, but they could be shareholders of the companies. Likewise, private contractors could not enter seats in the senate. Consequently, the publicani, as the most influential group in the order of the knights, became part of the power-balancing mechanism of ancient Rome. Tax farming deals in newly acquired eastern provinces in Asia Minor proved to be a highly lucrative source of income for the companies, which placed publicani in competitive positions with the appointed local governors of the provinces. Also, the exclusion of the publicani from the senate opened up positions for them in the special courts, allowing them to weigh the limits and practices of government power.{{sfn|Badian|1983}}

The actions of the publicani were fiercely criticised. They were accused of insurance fraud in delivering goods during the Punic wars, of excessive greed when collecting taxes in the provinces, of exceptionally crude conduct towards slave labour working in the mines, and of fraudulent practices in trying to get rid of unprofitable public contracts. However, surviving literary sources are mainly based on accounts of senators, who were in a competitive position with the publicani. Still, the overall operation of the private contractors seems to have supplied satisfactory results for the management of the republic. The degradation of the role of private contracting coincided with the beginning of the rule of the emperors, during which the oligarchic power of the senate had to give way for the autocratic rule of the Caesars, and a more centralised public civil service system replaced private contractors in implementing the most important parts of public policy. However, the order of the knights, to which the publicani belonged, formed the backbone of the population from which civil servants were recruited. Throughout history, the publicani, or, more precisely, their local henchmen, were probably best known from their minor local tax collecting duties in Roman provinces during the imperial era &lt;ref&gt;Silver, M., 2007. Fiscalism in the emergence and extinction of societates publicanorum. Pomoerium, 6, pp. 47–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

By [[New Testament]] times, the provincial people came to see the publicans chiefly as [[tax]] collectors. It is in this sense that the term is used in [[Jesus Christ|Jesus']] [[parable]] of the [[Pharisee and the Publican]]. However, their role as public contractors, especially as regards building projects, was still significant. 
{{cn|date=September 2013}}
With the rise of a much larger Imperial bureaucracy, this task of the publicans, as well as their overall importance, declined precipitously. Evidence for the existence of publicans extends as far back as the 3rd century BC, although it is generally assumed{{by whom|date=November 2017}} that they existed at still earlier times in Roman history. Knowledge of a tentative ''[[terminus post quem]]'' is taken from the histories of the 1st century AD Imperial historian [[Livy]].

[[File:Truppa di Garibaldi.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Truppa di Garibaldi]]

'''Redshirts''' {{in it|Camicie Rosse}} or '''Red coats''' {{in it|Giubbe Rosse}} is the name given to the volunteers who followed [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] in [[Mezzogiorno|southern Italy]] during his [[expedition of the Thousand]] to southern Italy, but sometimes extended to other campaigns of his. The name derived from the color of their shirts or loose fitting blouses (complete uniforms were beyond the finances of the Italian patriots).

==Background==
[[File:Borrani_Cucitrici.png|thumb|upright|left|Sewing red shirts for the volunteers: [[Odoardo Borrani]], ''Cucitrici di camicie rosse'', 1863]]
The red shirts were started by Giuseppe Garibaldi. During his years of exile, Garibaldi was involved in a military action in [[Uruguayan Civil War|Uruguay]], where, in 1843, he originally used red shirts from a stock destined for slaughterhouse workers in [[Buenos Aires]]. Later, he spent time in private retirement in [[New York City]]. Both places have been claimed as the birthplace of the Garibaldian red shirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Il lungo Risorgimento: la nascita dell'Italia contemporanea (1770–1922)|last= Pécout|first= Gilles|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1999|publisher= Paravia Bruno Mondadori|location= |isbn= 9788842493570|page= |pages= 173|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=S1Gf95fGYysC&amp;pg=PA172&amp;dq=Camicie+rosse+origini+1843.#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of his force of volunteers in Uruguay, his mastery of the techniques of guerilla warfare, his opposition to the [[Emperor of Brazil]] and [[Argentina|Argentine]] territorial ambitions (perceived by liberals as also imperialist), and his victories in the battles of Cerro and Sant'Antonio in 1846 that assured the independence of Uruguay, made Garibaldi and his followers heroes in Italy and Europe. Garibaldi was later hailed as the "Gran Chico Fornido" on the basis of these exploits.

In Uruguay, calling on the Italians of [[Montevideo]], Garibaldi formed the [[Italian Legion]] in 1843. In later years, it was claimed that in Uruguay the legion first sported the red shirts associated with Garibaldi's "Thousand", which were said to have been obtained from a factory in Montevideo which had intended to export them to the slaughter houses of Argentina. Red shirts sported by Argentinian butchers in the 1840s are not otherwise documented, however, and the famous ''camicie rosse'' did not appear during Garibaldi's efforts in [[Rome]] in 1849–50.

Later, after the failure of the campaign for Rome, Garibaldi spent a few years, circa 1850–53, with the Italian patriot and inventor, [[Antonio Meucci]], in a modest [[gothic architecture|gothic]] frame house (now designated a New York City Landmark), on [[Staten Island]], [[New York City]], before sailing for Italy in 1853. There is a [[Garibaldi Memorial|Garibaldi-Meucci museum]] on Staten Island.

In New York, during the pre-Civil War era, rival companies of [[Volunteer fire department|volunteer firemen]] were the great working-class heroes of the city. Their courage, their civic spirit, and the lively comradeship they demonstrated inspired fanatic followers throughout New York, the original "[[Fire buff|fire buffs]]".
[[File:Monteporzio - Garibaldino.JPG|thumb|upright|right|A typical patriotic communal monument to the ''Garibaldini'', at [[Monte Porzio]]]]
Volunteer fire companies varied in the completeness and details of their uniforms, but they all wore the red flannel shirt. When Garibaldi returned to Italy after his New York stay, the red shirts made their first appearance among his followers.

Garibaldi remained a local hero among European immigrants back in [[History of New York City|New York]]. The "Garibaldi Guard" ([[39th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment|39th New York State Volunteers]]) fought in the [[American Civil War]], 1861–65. As part of their uniform, they wore red woolen "Garibaldi Shirts"{{snd}} at least, all enlisted men did. The ''[[New York Tribune]]'' sized them up:
{{quote|The officers of the Guard are men who have held important commands in the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Hungarian]], [[Italian Unification|Italian]], and [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German]] revolutionary armies. Many of them were in the [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinian]] and [[Second French Empire|French]] armies in the [[Crimean War|Crimea]] and in [[Algeria]].}}

A woman's fashion, the [[Garibaldi shirt]], was begun in 1860 by the [[Eugénie de Montijo|Empress Eugénie]] of France, and the blousy style remained popular for some years, eventually turning into the [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]] [[Waist (clothing)|shirt waist]] and modern woman's [[blouse]].&lt;ref&gt;Young, Julia Ditto, "The Rise of the Shirt Waist", ''[[Good Housekeeping]]'', May 1902, pp. 354-357&lt;/ref&gt;

Giuseppe Garibaldi's son, [[Ricciotti Garibaldi]], later led redshirt volunteer troops that fought with the [[Greek Army]] in the [[Greco-Turkish War of 1897]] and the [[First Balkan War]] of 1912–13.

The Redshirts gave inspiration to [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]], to form the [[Fascism|Fascist]] [[blackshirts]] units and, from there, to [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s brownshirted [[Sturmabteilung]] (SA) units, as well as, the quasi-fascist Irish [[Blueshirts]], under [[Eoin O'Duffy]]. However, whilst being vaguely nationalistic in tone, Garibaldi and his men are not widely considered as having been [[protofascist]]. Nottingham Forest FC now proudly wear the Garibaldi red shirts since their inception in 1865.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3287">'''Stanak''' is the most common name used to refer to the assembly of nobility in [[medieval Bosnia]]. The assembly was also known as the '''Rusag''' (from the [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] word ''orszag'', meaning "country"), '''Zbor''', '''Sva Bosna''' (meaning ''"Whole of Bosnia"'') or just '''Bosna''', with the officials of the [[Republic of Ragusa]] employing several [[Latin language|Latin]] terms as well. The term ''stanak'' is first attested in the charter of [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|Tvrtko I]] in 1354.&lt;ref name=parlament&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.parlament.ba/istorija/default.aspx?id=27865&amp;langTag=bs-BA&amp;pril=b|title=Istorija parlamentarizma u BiH|work=Parlamentarna skupština Bosne i Hercegovine|first=Edin|last=Radušić|year=2010|publisher=Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to take part in the sessions of the Stanak was enjoyed by every Bosnian ''[[Knez (title)|knez]]'', from magnates to petty lords, collectively known as ''vlastela'', but the ultimate authority belonged to the highest nobility.&lt;ref name=jlz&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=Enciklopedija Jugoslavije: Bje-Crn|year=1980|editors=Miroslav Krleža, Ivo Cecić, Igor Gostl|publisher=Jugoslavenski leksikografski zavod|page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Stanak was convoked when required, usually by the [[List of rulers of Bosnia|ruler]], who presided over it and led its sessions.&lt;ref name=parlament/&gt;&lt;ref name=jlz/&gt; If male, [[list of Bosnian consorts|his wife]] was allowed to attend, but his sons were not.&lt;ref name=parlament/&gt; The [[Bosnian Church]] clergy, not belonging to the ''vlastela'', were also barred, but influenced decision-making in the Stanak through the great lords associated with it.&lt;ref name=jlz/&gt; The magnates of the country convoked the Stanak themselves when the country experienced greater domestic issues, such as succession crisis or deposition of the ruler. It normally took place wherever the monarch held court: in [[Mile]], [[Milodraž]], [[Bobovac]], [[Kraljeva Sutjeska]] and [[Jajce]].&lt;ref name=parlament/&gt;

The Stanak enjoyed great power and authority; it deliberated on matters such as [[royal elections|election of the new king or queen]] and [[coronation]], foreign policy, sale or cession of territory, contracting and signing treaties with neighbouring countries, and military issues.&lt;ref name=parlament/&gt;&lt;ref name=jlz/&gt; Charters issued by monarchs reflected the decisions made by the Stanak; as the royal power weakened, the Stanak's increased.&lt;ref name=parlament/&gt; Its influence peaked between the 1390s and the 1420s. The Serbian historian [[Sima Ćirković]] and most other Yugoslav scholars believed that the existence of the Stanak proved a unity and feeling of belonging to a Bosnian entity, while their American colleague [[John Van Antwerp Fine, Jr.]] argued that it only illustrated weakness of the monarch and [[decentralization]] of the state.&lt;ref name=Fine2&gt;{{citation|title=The Bosnian Church: Its Place in State and Society from the Thirteenth to the Fifteenth Century|last=Van Antwerp Fine|first=John|author-link=John Van Antwerp Fine, Jr.|publisher=Saqi|isbn=0863565034|year=2007|pages=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sumac Kawsay'''  ''Buen Vivir''  ("good living") rooted in the cosmovisión (or worldview) of the [[Quechua people|Quechua]] peoples of the Andes, sumak kawsay – or buen vivir, to give it its Spanish name – describes a way of doing things that is community-centric, ecologically-balanced and culturally-sensitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/buen-vivir-philosophy-south-america-eduardo-gudynas|title=Buen vivir: the social philosophy inspiring movements in South America|last=Balch|first=Oliver|date=2013-02-04|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-03-19|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is related to tradition of legal and political scholarship advocating legal standing for the natural environment.&lt;ref name="Stone CD 1974 p 8"&gt;Stone CD, Should Trees Have Standing? Toward Legal Rights for Natural Objects.

With the enactment of [[2008 Constitution of Ecuador|its 2008 Constitution]], [[Ecuador]] became the first country in the world to codify the Rights of Nature and to inform a more clarified content to those rights. Articles 10 and 71–74 of the Ecuadorian Constitution recognize the inalienable rights of [[ecosystems]] to exist and flourish, gives people the authority to petition on the behalf of ecosystems, and requires the government to remedy violations of these rights.

==History==
{{Further|Plant rights|Environmental movement}}

=== Rights of nature in legal history ===
In his famous work, "Should Trees Have Standing?", Christopher Stone presented the case for conferring legal personality and rights on the environment. As Stone explained, as a rights-holder the natural object would “have a legally recognised worth and dignity in its own right, and not merely to serve as a means to benefit ‘us’”. To achieve rights-holder status, the natural object must satisfy three criteria: [First], that the thing can institute legal actions at its behest; second, that in determining the granting of legal relief, the court must take injury to it into account; and third, that relief must run to the benefit of it.&lt;ref name="Stone CD 1974 p 8"/&gt;

In his dissenting opinion in the landmark environmental law case, ''[[Sierra Club v. Morton]]'', 405 U.S. 727 (1972), Justice [[William O. Douglas]] argued that "inanimate objects" should have standing to sue in court: {{quote|The critical question of "standing" would be simplified and also put neatly in focus if we fashioned a federal rule that allowed environmental issues to be litigated before federal agencies or federal courts in the name of the inanimate object about to be despoiled, defaced, or invaded by roads and bulldozers and where injury is the subject of public outrage. Contemporary public concern for protecting nature's ecological equilibrium should lead to the conferral of standing upon environmental objects to sue for their own preservation. This suit would therefore be more properly labeled as Mineral King v. Morton.&lt;ref name=405US727&gt;{{Cite court|title=a|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/405/727/case.html#741|year=1972|accessdate=October 8, 2011|court=USSC|litigants=Sierra Club v. Morton|opinion=727|pinpoint=741–43|reporter=U.S.|vol=405}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
Douglas continued: {{quote|Inanimate objects are sometimes parties in litigation. A ship has a legal personality, a [[Legal fiction|fiction]] found useful for maritime purposes. The [[corporation sole]]{{mdash}}a creature of ecclesiastical law{{mdash}}is an acceptable adversary and large fortunes ride on its cases.... So it should be as respects valleys, alpine meadows, rivers, lakes, estuaries, beaches, ridges, groves of trees, swampland, or even air that feels the destructive pressures of modern technology and modern life. The river, for example, is the living symbol of all the life it sustains or nourishes{{mdash}}fish, aquatic insects, water ouzels, otter, fisher, deer, elk, bear, and all other animals, including man, who are dependent on it or who enjoy it for its sight, its sound, or its life. The river as plaintiff speaks for the ecological unit of life that is part of it.&lt;ref name=405US727 /&gt;}}

In 2012 [[New Zealand]]'s [[Whanganui River]] was legally declared a person with standing (via guardians) to bring legal actions to protect its interests.&lt;ref name=nzh&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shuttleworth|first1=Kate|title=Agreement entitles Whanganui River to legal identity|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10830586|work=[[New Zealand Herald]]|date=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=huff&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fairbrother|first1=Alison|title=New Zealand's Whanganui River Gains A Legal Voice|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/18/new-zealand-whanganui-river_n_1894893.html|work=[[Huffington Post]]|date=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vines, T., Bruce, A., Faunce, T.

===Outcome from neoliberal development in Ecuador===

The Rights of Nature articles in Ecuador's constitution are part of a reaction to a combination of political, economic, and social phenomena. Ecuador's abusive past with the [[oil industry]], most famously the [[Chevron Corporation#Environmental damage in Ecuador|class-action litigation]] against [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], and the failure of an extraction-based economy and [[neoliberal]] reforms to bring economic prosperity to the region has resulted in the election of a New Leftist regime led by President [[Rafael Correa]], and sparked a demand for new approaches to development. In conjunction with this need, the principle of "''Buen Vivir''" or good living, which focuses on social, environmental and spiritual wealth versus material wealth, gained popularity among citizens and was incorporated into the new constitution.&lt;ref name="Gudynas"&gt;Gudynas, Eduardo. 2011. Buen Vivir: Today's Tomorrow Development 54(4):441-447.&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of indigenous groups, from whom the concept of ''Buen Vivir'' originates, in the forming of the constitutional ideals also facilitated the incorporation of the Rights of Nature as a basic tenet of their culture and conceptualization of ''Buen Vivir''.&lt;ref name="Becker"&gt;Becker, Marc. 2011 Correa, Indigenous Movements, and the Writing of a New Constitution in Ecuador. Latin American Perspectives 38(1):47-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

The neoliberal development schemes in line with the "[[Washington Consensus]]" did not create prosperity for much of Ecuador's population, especially its [[Indigenous peoples in Ecuador|indigenous population]]s, who make up about 40% of the country's population.&lt;ref name="Acosta"&gt;Acosta, Alberto, Eduardo Gudynas, Esperanza Martínez, and Joseph H.

Policy Innovations. http://www.policyinnovations.org/ideas/briefings/data/000077&lt;/ref&gt; The economy, based on the exportation of the country's raw materials, mainly oil, was also wreaking havoc on the nation's environment, an area with valuable biological and cultural diversity.&lt;ref name="Arsel"&gt;Arsel, Murat 2012. Between 'Marx and Markets'? The State, The 'Left Turn' And Nature In Ecuador. Tijdschrift Voor Economische En Sociale Geografie (Journal of Economic &amp; Social Geography) 103(2):150-163.&lt;/ref&gt; The global economic crisis of 2008 revealed the vulnerabilities of an extractive economy, and led to a period of political turmoil in the country that made obviously the need for a new more inclusive government that embodied a post-oil, post-neoliberal development paradigm.&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Acosta" /&gt; In late 2006, the election of leftist Rafael Correa, who ran on an anti-neoliberal platform, showed the emergence of a new political era for Ecuador.&lt;ref name="Arsel" /&gt;

===''Buen Vivir''===

''Buen Vivir'' ("good living") emerged as a response to the traditional strategies for development and their negative environmental, social, or economic effects. ''Buen Vivir'' is an alternative concept of development that focuses on the attainment of the "good life" in a broad sense, only attainable within a community; a community that includes Nature. A popular approach to ''Buen Vivir'' is the Ecuadorian concept of ''[[w:es:sumak kawsay|sumak kawsay]]'', meaning a full life in [[kichwa]]. Part of this concept also emphasizes living in harmony with other people and nature. ''Buen Vivir'' has gained new popularity, spreading throughout parts of [[South America]] and evolving as a multicultural concept. Social consensus led to the inclusion of ''Buen Vivir'' in Ecuador's new constitution, supported as an alternative to neoliberal development. The constitution outlines ''Buen Vivir'' as a set of rights, one of which is the rights of nature.&lt;ref name="Gudynas" /&gt; In line with the assertion of these rights, ''Buen Vivir'' changes the relationship between nature and humans to a more bio-pluralistic view, eliminating the separation between nature and society.&lt;ref name="Gudynas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SENPLADES"&gt;SENPLADES. 2009 National Plan for Good Living. Electronic document, http://plan2009.senplades.gob.ec/web/en/presentation, accessed May, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous movement===

The inclusion of "Buen Vivir" and Rights of Nature in the constitution was ushered in largely due to the increased influence of indigenous activist groups in the political realm. After several years of worsening economic and environmental conditions, uprisings from various indigenous communities, who found themselves receiving less support from the state, while simultaneously their land was being increasingly encroached upon by oil companies, brought attention to their concerns.&lt;ref name="Arsel" /&gt; After historically being excluded from the political process, indigenous groups, especially concerned about the worsening environmental devastation of the extraction business and global [[climate change]], started social movements aimed at creating a new approach to development that would protect the environment and harmonize its relationship with people. [[CONAIE]] (National Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador), the largest federation of indigenous movements, encompassing 14 of the nation's indigenous groups, and other groups focused on social justice began lobbying for a new constitution that incorporated recognition of the nation's indigenous groups, their language, culture, history, and land rights, and inherently their concepts of ''sumak kawsay'' and ''[[Pachamama]]'' (English: "Mother Nature").&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt;

===Drafting===
President [[Rafael Correa]] included calling for a constitutional assembly in his 2006 campaign. On April 15, 2007, over 80% of Ecuadorians voted in favor of calling a new assembly, thanks in large part to the support of indigenous communities. Indigenous groups had been pressuring for a new, more inclusive constitution for years, and were therefore actively involved in the drafting process. Alberto Acosta, the elected Assembly President, pledged to make the assembly more inclusive and incorporate the concerns of the indigenous into the constitution. In the end, a few indigenous representatives were elected to the assembly.&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; To create a constitution based on the principles of ''Buen Vivir'', the Constitutional Assembly, with the advice of the [[Pachamama]] Alliance, enlisted the help of the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund (CELDF) to draft language for the new provisions of the constitution detailing the Rights of Nature.&lt;ref name="Celdf" /&gt; Indigenous groups also played a role in the drafting process. Fundación Pachamama, in conjunction with leaders in CONAIE, met with members of the assembly to present their ideas for the constitution and gain support. A national media campaign detailing the tenets of the new constitution and the Rights of Nature was also launched to inform and gain support from the public.&lt;ref name="FP"&gt;Fundación Pachamama (FP). 2011 [http://www.derechosdelanaturaleza.org/website/files/2011/01/Recogniting-Rights-for-Nature-in-the-Ecuadorian-Constitution-Fundacion-Pachamama1.pdf "Recognizing Rights for Nature in the Ecuadorian Constitution"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adoption===
On April 10, 2008, with 91 votes out of 130, the [[Ecuadorian Constituent Assembly|Constitutional Assembly]] approved Article 10 for inclusion in the new constitution. On June 7, the language of Articles 71 through 74, compiling the Rights of Nature, were presented and debated on, before receiving approval for inclusion in the constitution.&lt;ref name="FP" /&gt;
 
On September 28, 2008, a mandatory [[referendum]] was held to vote on the new constitution, where the adoption of the constitution was approved by 65% of voters.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Smith, Gar. 2009, "In Ecuador, Trees Now Have Rights", ''Earth Island Journal'' 23(4):15-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text of the Rights of Nature==

===Title II===

===Rights===

===Chapter one===

===Principles for the enforcement of rights===

'''Article 10.''' Persons, communities, peoples, nations and communities are bearers of rights and shall enjoy the rights guaranteed to them in the Constitution and in international instruments.
Nature shall be the subject of those rights that the Constitution recognizes for it.

===Chapter seven===

===Rights of nature===

'''Article 71.''' Nature, or Pacha Mama, where life is reproduced and occurs, has the right to integral respect for its existence and for the maintenance and regeneration of its life cycles, structure, functions and evolutionary processes.
All persons, communities, peoples and nations can call upon public authorities to enforce the rights of nature. To enforce and interpret these rights, the principles set forth in the Constitution shall be observed, as appropriate.
The State shall give incentives to natural persons and legal entities and to communities to protect nature and to promote respect for all the elements comprising an ecosystem.

'''Article 72.''' Nature has the right to be restored. This restoration shall be apart from the obligation of the State and natural persons or legal entities to compensate individuals and communities that depend on affected natural systems.
In those cases of severe or permanent environmental impact, including those caused by the exploitation of nonrenewable natural resources, the State shall establish the most effective mechanisms to achieve the restoration and shall adopt adequate measures to eliminate or mitigate harmful environmental consequences.

'''Article 73.''' The State shall apply preventive and restrictive measures on activities that might lead to the extinction of species, the destruction of ecosystems and the permanent alteration of natural cycles.
The introduction of organisms and organic and inorganic material that might definitively alter the nation’s genetic assets is forbidden.

'''Article 74.''' Persons, communities, peoples, and nations shall have the right to benefit from the environment and the natural wealth enabling them to enjoy the good way of living.
Environmental services shall not be subject to appropriation; their production, delivery, use and development shall be regulated by the State.&lt;ref name="PDBA"&gt;[http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Ecuador/english08.html "2008 Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador. Political Database of the Americas (PDBA)"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
The Rights of Nature is significant as it is the first case where this concept has been evoked at the national level. The articles set out a rights-based system that recognizes Nature, or ''Pachamama'', as a right-bearing entity that holds value in itself, apart from human use. This differs from traditional systems that see nature as property, giving landowners the right to damage or destroy ecosystems that depend on their land. The rights-based approach spelled out in the Rights of Nature expands on previous laws for regulation and conservation by recognizing that nature has fundamental and inalienable rights as a valuable entity in and of itself. The system also assigns liability for damage to the environment and holds the government responsible for the reparation of any damage. Additionally, if an ecosystem's rights are violated, it gives people the authority to petition on behalf of the ecosystem to ensure that its interests are not subverted to the interests of individuals or corporations.&lt;ref name="Celdf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Acosta" /&gt;
 
The inclusion of the Rights of Nature also makes the constitution more democratic and inclusive, as it reflects the indigenes' idea of Nature as a mother that must be respected and celebrated. This is the first constitution that has incorporated indigenous concepts of ''sumak kawsay'' and ''Pachamama'', as well as recognized the [[plurinationality]] of Ecuador. This has broad significance for the recognition of indigenous groups and their right to preserve their land and culture. The combination of human rights with the rights of nature will allow for more effective protection of indigenous communities.&lt;ref name="FP" /&gt;
 
The Rights of Nature also transforms the relationship between nature and humans by asserting that nature is not just an object.&lt;ref name="Mychalejko"&gt;Mychalejko, Cyril. 2008 Ecuador's Constitution Gives Rights to Nature. Philadelphia Independent Media Center.&lt;/ref&gt; By putting ecosystems on an equal footing with humans, the conception of humans as masters or as separate from nature is dismissed.&lt;ref name="Gudynas" /&gt; Instead, this system celebrates nature and recognizes that humans are a part of it.&lt;ref name="Arsel" /&gt;
 
The Rights of Nature are further incorporated in the updated National Plan for Good Living, which states guaranteeing the Rights of Nature and promoting a healthy and sustainable environment as one of its twelve objectives. Policies under the objective include aims to preserve and manage biodiversity, diversify the national energy matrix with renewable sources, prevent, control and mitigate environmental damage, promote adaptation to and [[mitigation of climate change]], and incorporate environmental approach in all public policies.&lt;ref name="SENPLADES" /&gt;

===Legal effects===
The Rights of Nature has been applied to several legal disputes and considered in government development initiatives.

====Wheeler c. Director de la Procuraduria General Del Estado de Loja====
''Wheeler c. Director de la Procuraduria General Del Estado de Loja'' was the first case in history to vindicate the Rights of Nature. The lawsuit was filed against the local government near Rio Vilcabamba in March 2011, who were responsible for a road expansion project that dumped debris into the river, narrowing its width and thereby doubling its speed. The project was also done without the completion of an [[environmental impact assessment]] or consent of the local residents. The case was filed by two such residents, citing the violation of the Rights of Nature, rather than property rights, for the damage done to the river. The case was important because the court stated that the rights of nature would prevail over other constitutional rights if they were in conflict with each other, setting an important precedent. The proceedings also confirmed that the burden of proof to show there is no damage lies with the defendant. Though the plaintiffs were granted a victory in court, the enforcement of the ruling has been lacking, as the local government has been slow to comply with the mandated reparations.&lt;ref name="Daly"&gt;Daly, Erin. 2012, [http://celdf.live2.radicaldesigns.org/downloads/The_Ecuadorian_Exemplar_The_First_Ever_Vindications_of_Constitutional_Rights_of_Nature.pdf "Ecuadorian Exemplar: The First Ever Vindications of Constitutional Rights"], ''Review of European Community &amp; International Environmental Law'' 21(1): 63-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

====República del Ecuador Asamblea Nacional, Comisión de la Biodiversidad y Recursos Naturales====
In March 2011, right after the ruling on the ''Wheeler'' case, the government of Ecuador filed a case against illegal gold mining operations in northern Ecuador, in the remote districts San Lorenzo and Eloy Alfaro. The rights of nature were violated by the mining operations, which were argued to be polluting the nearby rivers. This case is different from the previous in that it was the government addressing the violation of the rights of nature. It was also swiftly enforced, as military operation to destroy the machinery used for illegal mining was ordered and implemented.&lt;ref name="Daly" /&gt;

====Yasuni ITT initiative====
The Yasuni-Ishpingo, Tambococha, and Tiputini (ITT) Initiative, referring to the corridor of oil reserves within the [[Yasuni National Park]], is the first post-oil development initiative that recognizes that the benefits gained from the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]] are greater than the economic benefits from oil extraction. The aim of the initiative is therefore to protect the biodiversity of the area, which UNESCO has declared a biodiversity reserve, by keeping the oil reserves in the ground, in return for compensation from the international community for at least half of the projected benefit Ecuador would receive from the oil extraction (approximately $3.5 billion). These funds would be used to fund other economic initiatives to alleviate poverty and develop the renewable energy sector. The importance of keeping the oil in the ITT area in the ground has been argued as of international importance to mitigate the effects of global climate change by preventing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and the local environmental devastation the extraction would cause. The Rights of Nature and other articles of the new constitution also make the protection of the park a legal imperative, as the extraction would be a violation of nature's rights.&lt;ref name="Acosta" /&gt; Though there originally was some difficulty evoking a sense of international responsibility to fund the initiative, especially with the national constitution requiring this law already, eventually in August 2010 Ecuador came to an arrangement with the UNDP for funding of the initiative through the issue of Yasuní Guarantee Certificates, denoting the amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions avoided and their monetary value, which can potentially be used in the [[European Union]] [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme|Emission Trading Scheme]].&lt;ref name="Arsel" /&gt;

==Reactions==

===Praise===
The adoption of the Rights of Nature by Ecuador has received praise internationally by many countries who see this as a revolutionary way to conceptualize the environment and a way for Ecuador to move beyond the extractive economy of its past.&lt;ref name="Madden" /&gt; Initiatives to adopt the concept of ecosystem rights have been taken or are being taken in various parts of the world, including Bolivia, Turkey, Nepal, and various municipalities in the United States.&lt;ref name="Celdf" /&gt;

===Criticisms===
Criticisms of the Rights of Nature have generally centered on the mechanisms of enforcement of the provision. One criticism is that though the constitution establishes stronger regulations for the environment, it also gives the state the power to relax these regulations if found to be in the national interest.&lt;ref name="Arsel" /&gt; Therefore, much of the enforcement of the ecosystem rights depends on the will of the government, or an active citizenry.&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; Indigenous groups have also expressed dissatisfaction that the constitution does not give local communities veto power over projects affecting their land.&lt;ref name="FP" /&gt; Others also feel a major weakness of the constitution is that it does not require prior or informed consent by communities before the start of development projects, which can undermine their ability to uphold the rights of nature.&lt;ref name="Mychalejko" /&gt; There are also concerns that the Rights of Nature could negatively affect [[foreign direct investment]] since companies will not want to comply with the more stringent regulations.&lt;ref name="Madden" /&gt; On the other hand, people are skeptical of the Correa administration for still approving projects by foreign extraction companies violating the Rights of Nature.&lt;ref name="Mychalejko" /&gt;

'''''Swift v. Zynga''''' is an ongoing [[class action lawsuit]] filed in 2009, based on allegedly deceptive ads that ran in [[Zynga]] games on [[Facebook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Complaint, Swift v.

Retrieved on March 03, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; A motion by Zynga to dismiss the case was denied by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California in November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/31550/Judge_Denies_Zyngas_Request_To_Dismiss_Scam_Suit.php Judge Denies Zynga's Request to Dismiss Scam Suit].

Zynga Game Network, Inc. et al | image=US_DC_NorCal.svg | imagealt = United States District Court for the Northern District of California Coat of Arms}}

== Factual background ==
[[Zynga]] is a developer of popular online games such as [[FarmVille]], [[Mafia Wars]], [https://forums.yoworld.com/ Yoworld] and ZyngaPoker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zynga.com/games/ Zynga Games]. From Zynga. Retrieved on March 03, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; These games allow players to spend [[virtual economy|virtual currency]] to take in-game actions and purchase [[virtual goods]]. Currency is metered out through the game itself, and additional currency can be purchased directly, or earned by completing special offers with Zynga and its business partners.&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2009/10/31/scamville-the-social-gaming-ecosystem-of-hell/ Scamville: The Social Gaming Ecosystem of Hell]. From TechCrunch. Retrieved on February 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plaintiff, Rebecca Swift, alleges that she played Zynga games and participated in multiple special offers run by Zynga's partner Adknowledge. In April 2009 she allegedly provided her cell phone number as requested by one of these offers, in order to be texted a code redeemable for YoCash, in-game currency in Zynga's  YoVille! game. She subsequently received four charges of $9.99 billed to her cell phone from April 16, 2009 onward, without her knowledge or consent.&lt;ref name="complaint"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/gov.uscourts.cand.223267 Swift V Zynga, No. C 09-05443 SBA (N.D.C. November 17, 2009)]. From Archive.org. Retrieved on March 03, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, on June 14, 2009 Rebecca signed up for a second special offer, a "risk-free Grean Tea Purity Trial." The offer promised YoCash in exchange for participation in the risk-free trial, and stipulated that the trial could be cancelled anytime within 15 days of sign-up. Rebecca provided her debit card number and was charged an initial $5.95 for shipping and handling. Ten days later she sent an email asking to cancel the subscription, after receiving a shipment of green tea pills and tea bags. On July 4th Rebecca received an email indicating she would be charged an additional $79.95, despite her request to cancel. She was unable to contact the sender by telephone, and on July 6th was billed for the $79.95 plus a foreign transaction fee. On July 20th, she was billed again, resulting in total charges of $176.56.&lt;ref name="complaint"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Procedural background ==
Rebecca Swift filed a putative class action on November 19, 2009, claiming Facebook, Zynga, and AdKnowledge profited from "highly misleading" ads.&lt;ref name="complaint"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Outside experts initially voiced the opinion that both Facebook and Zynga would be immune to legal action under provisions of the [[Communications Decency Act]] (CDA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediapost.com/publications/?fa=Articles.showArticle&amp;art_aid=117845 Experts Say Facebook, Zynga Have Defense To 'Scam' Ads] from MediaPost. Retrieved February 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Swift withdrew her action against Facebook in January 2010, though court records showed that the case was dismissed without prejudice and could in theory be re-filed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediapost.com/publications/?fa=Articles.showArticle&amp;art_aid=121206 'Scamville' Lawsuit Against Facebook Dropped] from MediaPost. Retrieved February 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; A First Amended Complaint was filed by Swift on February 10th, 2010, which claimed violation of the Unfair Competition Law, violation of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act, and unjust enrichment.

Both Zynga and AdKnowledge separately moved to dismiss the case on the grounds that Swift’s claims are barred by the CDA, but the motion was denied by the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]] in a November 3rd, 2010 ruling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/california/candce/4:2009cv05443/223267/34/ Order Denying Defendants'  Motion to Dismiss First Amended Complaint]. From Justia&lt;/ref&gt;

AdKnowledge separately claimed that Swift failed to sufficiently identify AdKnowledge's role in the alleged fraud. AdKnowledge also argued that Swift's unjust enrichment claim should be dismissed. Finally, AdKnowledge moved to strike Swift's class allegations. AdKnowledge's claim and both motions were denied.

== Court's reading of CDA immunity and reaction == 
In evaluating Zynga's motion to dismiss, the court looked to the [[Fair Housing Council of San Fernando Valley v. Roommates.com, LLC | Roommates.com ruling]] (521 F.3d at 1161-1162). Through the lens of that ruling, the court determined that Swift's allegations could, if proven, support the conclusion that Zynga was responsible for creating or developing the content at issue. Specifically, Swift asserts that the virtual currency offered in the ads is the most important "content" found within them, and that Zynga further contributed to their development by specifying the design, layout, and format of the offers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/gov.uscourts.cand.223267 Swift V Zynga, No. C 09-05443 SBA (N.D.C. November 11, 2010)]. From Archive.org. Retrieved on March 03, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

When evaluating AdKnowledge's immunity claim, the court found that it was unable to determine whether it is entitled to CDA immunity, an evaluation which it judged to be a fact-based inquiry.

Several law blogs have remarked on the failure to dismiss for CDA immunity as a potentially far-reaching shift in the law, claiming that it marks a departure from standard case law and could require websites to take extra steps to ensure their immunity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://woodfordiplaw.com/blog/2010/12/8/website-immunity-under-the-cda-230-in-the-9th-circuit-veerin.html Website Immunity Under the CDA §230 in the 9th Circuit: Veering Toward Uncertainty] from woodfordiplaw.com. Retrieved on February 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2010/11/ad_networks_can.htm Ad Networks Can't Get 47 USC 230 Defense on Motion to Dismiss--Swift v. Zynga] from Eric Goldman's Technology and Law Marketing Blog. Retrieved on February 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Changes by Zynga ==
Zynga reacted to the broader [[Zynga#Scam ads | "scam ads"]] controversy by removing all "offer" based advertising from its site in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/zynga-were-banning-all-offers-from-games-2009-11 Zynga: We're Banning All Offers From Games] from Business Insider. Retrieved March 02, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This action was taken after Swift experienced the allegedly fraudulent ads, but before the original complaint in Swift v. Zynga was filed. In January 2010, Zynga reinstated these offer-based promotions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unigamesity.com/zynga-to-bring-back-offers-for-in-game-money/ Zynga to Bring Back Offers for In-Game Money!].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10943">'''Systemic development''' is a process of thinking about development which uses a [[systems thinking]] approach to create a solution to a social, environmental, and economic stress which the world is suffering from.

== Overview ==
[[File:Sustainable development.svg|thumb|Development can be a combination of multiple disciplines. Sustainable development focuses on a balance of environmental, economic, and social.]]
The core approach of systemic development is a process for thinking holistically while addressing complex issues and progressing towards a mutual goal with high participation rates.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The process encompasses comprehension of current activities and future needs from a holistic perspective. For success, it is essential that the process moves from an integrated assessment to a sustainable assessment. The perspective must consider the many facets of the current and proposed development including the economic, social, environmental, political and ecological aspects. The idea behind a systemic development approach can be applied to many disciplines, similar to [[sustainable development]]. Systemic development is practice rather than [[sustainability]], which is an end state.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
[[Systems theory|General Systems Theory]] (GST) laid the foundation to systemic thinking. [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy|Ludwig Von Bertalanffy]] was known as the founder of the original principles of GST.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Cruz, Ivonne, Andri Stahel, and Manfred Max-Neef. "Towards a Systemic Development Approach: Building on the Human-Scale Development Paradigm." ''Ecological Economics'' 68.7 (2009): 2021-030. ''Elsevier''. Web. 20 Apr. 2017. &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2009.02.004&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 1968, when GST was introduced in Bertalanffy’s book, ''General System Theory: Foundations, Development, Applications'', the traditional approach to development used linear thinking or cause-and-effect thinking. GST was influenced by many different types of theories such as “Chaos theory, complexity theory, catastrophe theory, cybernetics, fuzzy set theory, and learning matrices” &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spruill|first=Nina|last2=Kenney|first2=Con|last3=Kaplan|first3=Laura|date=2001-03-01|title=Community Development and Systems Thinking: Theory and Practice|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ncr.90110/abstract|journal=National Civic Review|language=en|volume=90|issue=1|pages=105–116|doi=10.1002/ncr.90110|issn=1542-7811}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1990, [[Peter Senge]], author of ''[[The Fifth Discipline]]'', wove systemic thinking approach into development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Concepts ==
The integration of ontology, methodology, epistemology, and axiology has formed an outline for GST. Together, these concepts and philosophies contribute to the theory of systemic development.&lt;ref&gt;Sedlacko, Michal, Andre Martinuzzi, Inge RÃ¸pke, Nuno Videira, and Paula Antunes. "Participatory Systems Mapping for Sustainable Consumption: Discussion of a Method Promoting Systemic Insights." ''Ecological Economics'' 106 (2014): 33-43. ''Elsevier''. Web. 05 Mar. 2017. &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0921800914002043/1-s2.0-S0921800914002043-main.pdf?_tid=9d75173e-4500-11e7-b416-00000aacb361&amp;acdnat=1496125640_f44c0f82766115a9b6be398ef056d52f&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ontological ===
[[Ontology]] is the most basic fundamental tool. In a systemic development approach, the first step is to define the boundaries, thresholds, and stakeholders.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Sala, Serenella, Biagio Ciuffo, and Peter Nijkamp. "A Systemic Framework for Sustainability Assessment." ''Ecological Economics'' 119 (2015): 314-25. ''Elsevier''. Web. 05 Mar. 2017. &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0921800915003821/1-s2.0-S0921800915003821-main.pdf?_tid=24da3502-4500-11e7-951c-00000aacb35d&amp;acdnat=1496125438_401becd0b4afcc87524ef4bc3b8de9af&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  Understanding what is, is crucial to understand the layers of complexity of the development needs.

=== Methodological ===
[[Methodology]] in systemic development must consider all variables, values, and sustainability principles, and aim to ensure that no elements have been neglected. It is important to ensure completeness, comprehensiveness, and transparency of the assessment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Mutual feedback and interactions between stakeholders should be modeled and assessed using carefully designed specific methodologies.

=== Epistemological ===
[[Epistemology]] stresses how dialogue and communication by the stakeholders are the key tools to systemic development. This is when the verification and confirmation of the facets of the development process are discovered. Insight from each stakeholder is important to enhance and broaden the perspective of all involved. It is essential to take these viewpoints into consideration because they influence the process, the trends, the drivers of change, and the interactions between the parts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is during this phase that learning is accomplished.

=== Axiological ===
Axiologology emphasizes the ethical and aesthetic responsibility during the development process. It is important because the solution manifested by the systemic development process needs to represent the values of the represented stakeholders.

==Framework ==
=== Holistic Thinking ===
To successfully achieve development through a [[systems approach]], holistic thinking is necessary. A holistic approach to a system thinks about each variable, the space between the variables and what defines the variable. “It’s the sum of the interaction of its parts”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In this process each individual must learn from each other to understand the whole system in a [[multidimensional]] way to find a solution. To think about development with a systemic lens, one needs to be able to see the whole instead of parts and understand the relationship between the parts, the way the parts move, what drives the behavior of the parts, what influences the flow or direction, and to understand why there are no more or no fewer parts.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Flander, Katleen De, and Jeb Brugmann. "Pressure-Point Strategy: Leverages for Urban Systemic Transformation." ''Sustainability'' 9.1 (2017): 99. ''Sustainability''. Web. 15 May 2017. &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/9/1/99&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The many factors that make up the whole can be a complex system.

=== Stakeholders ===
Including many diverse stakeholders helps each individual to grow their own perspective, gain an understanding of others and to increase their creativity. Systemic involvement must strive for a [[Transdisciplinarity|transdisciplinary]] approach instead of a [[Multidisciplinary approach|multidisciplinary]] or [[interdisciplinary]] approach to achieve successful development.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Transdisciplinary allows for the integration of methodologies and epistemologies through collaboration of the different stakeholders. Including more perspectives in the loop will increase the chance of a successful solution.

=== Communication and Learning ===
The foundation of systemic development, systems thinking, when applied, creates knowledge which leads to expanded knowledge, which leads to success.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Dialog is an essential tool for sharing knowledge and translating it into action. Communication can provide feedback and insight about “system, culture, practices, and artifacts and about the objectives and values of the project sponsor, client, and other stakeholders.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Learning happens during the dialog process as each stakeholder comes to observe other stakeholder’s values and ideas about what successful development would encompass.

''The Fifth Element'', by Peter Senge, emphasizes the importance of learning to improve lives using systems thinking. Individuals who acquire information, knowledge, and skills from other stakeholders and the environment tend to experience a change in their own lives and livelihood.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; They themselves then become the agents of change by sharing their knowledge with others.&lt;ref&gt;Work Bank. Knowledge for Development. New York: Oxford University Press, 1999, p, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Complex loop ===
A feedback loop, closed loop, or systems complex model is a tool to help cope with complexity&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and understand the system as a whole. The tool will help to visualize the direction, velocity, delay time, long term and short term effects, and to help see the dynamic process. Feedback is necessary to learn about each other, including objectives and values of stakeholders and officials. A systemic approach to development is change oriented. The approach must encourage humans to communicate through interpersonal interactions, address the values of each stakeholder, and take part in developing and understanding the complex loop.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Goals ==
[[File:Systems_thinking_about_the_society.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Systems_thinking_about_the_society.svg|thumb|Parts, society, needs, means, individuals, and bigger picture are pieces of the puzzle that must be accounted for to make systemic development successful.]]
Systemic development is based on the principle that one must understand the complexity of the whole system to develop a solution. This can be accomplished by learning different elements in the system and applying them to their existing knowledge. We must learn about the past suggested solutions, the balance of the system, influx of the system, the challenges within the system, the best timing for each element, learning about uncertainty of cause-and-effect, the best leverage points in the system, the system does not work unless every piece is functioning at its prime, and there is no one individual at fault if everyone is working together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/314017669|title=Systemic development : local solutions in a global environment|last=1944-|first=Sheffield, Jim,|last2=Emergence.|first2=Institute for the Study of Coherence and|last3=N.Z.)|first3=ANZSYS Conference (13th : 2007 : Auckland,|date=2009|publisher=Isce Publishing|isbn=9780981703275|oclc=314017669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of systemic development is to have community participants shift from being reactors to viewing themselves “as active participants in shaping their reality [to move] from reacting to the present to creating the future”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The non-linear processes must coincide, be fluid and strive to benefit all parties involved.

The '''Treaty of Ayacucho''' was an agreement between [[Brazil]] and [[Bolivia]] signed in 1867.&lt;ref name="Rodrigues2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gomercindo Rodrigues|title=Walking the Forest with Chico Mendes: Struggle for Justice in the Amazon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vf6JglqhNpgC&amp;pg=PA73|date=1 December 2007|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-79504-4|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; It assigned the land of [[Acre (state)|Acre]] (now a state in Brazil) to [[Bolivia]] in exchange for 102,400 square kilometers of territory further north then annexed to [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]].&lt;ref&gt;Maria Luise Wagner. "Political instability and economic decline (1839-79)". In Hudson &amp; Hanratty.&lt;/ref&gt; It lasted until 1899, when an expedition led by [[Luiz Gálvez Rodríguez de Aria]] set up the '''first [[republic of Acre]]'''.

==Background==
Brazil was pressured to sign the agreement due to a threat of Bolivia joining in the [[Paraguayan War|war between Paraguay and Brazil]]. However, despite Bolivian pressure demarcation was not started until the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Rodrigues2007"/&gt;

==Collapse==
In Acre profits in rubber drew thousands of Brazilians, largely immigrants from the poor northern coast of the country (deep semi desert of center-southern [[Ceara]] state). In 1889, the situation escalated when the Brazilians living in Acre decided to defy the authority of [[Bolivia]]. They wanted to create an independent territory, and request annexation from [[Brazil]]. [[Bolivia]]'s response was to found the city of Puerto Alonso (today [[Porto Acre]]). Using military force, in October 1889 the Brazilians occupied and expelled the Bolivians.

In July 1899, with the help of the governor of the state of Amazonas, the Brazilian population proclaimed the [[Republic of Acre]].

Bolivia then leased the region through the [[Treaty of Aramayo]] to The Bolivian Syndicate of New York in 1901. However, by August 1902, an insurrection of around two thousand Brazilian guerrillas began. They would finally defeat Bolivian force in 1903. [[José Plácido de Castro]] was proclaimed governor of the Independent Acre.

==Supersession==
Finally, it was superseded in 1903 by the [[Treaty of Petrópolis]], which gave Acre to Brazil, in exchange for some concessions in [[Mato Grosso]].

'''Trial advocacy''' is the branch of knowledge concerned with making attorneys and other advocates more effective in trial proceedings.  Trial advocacy is taught in primary, secondary, and undergraduate schools (usually associated with a [[mock trial]] elective).&lt;ref&gt;Adamson, John E. ''Law for Business and Personal Use'' p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;  It is taught as an essential trade skill for litigators in [[law school]]s and in [[continuing legal education]] programs.

The skills of trial advocacy can be broken into two categories: skills that accomplish individual tasks ([[Tactic (method)|tactical skills]]) such as selecting jurors, delivering opening statements and closing arguments, and examining witnesses, and those skills that integrate the individual actions to achieve greater effects and to drive unfolding events toward the advocate’s desired outcome ([[litigation strategy|strategy]]) .&lt;ref&gt;Dreier, A.S., ''Strategy, Planning &amp; Litigating to Win'', pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[law school]] trial advocacy courses focus on tactical skills, though some integrate basic methods of strategic planning.  Some academics have expressed disfavor with advanced strategic techniques because of the imbalance they create, especially against attorneys who are unaware of them.  Proponents of advanced strategic techniques argue that these methods are the only effective means to counter the already-existing imbalances in the system, as between [[indigent]] defendants and the state, and between working-class [[plaintiff]]s and well-resourced, [[wealth]]y [[Conglomerate (company)|corporations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://advocacyteaching.blogspot.com/2013/01/trial-advocacy-professors-tell-me-that.html Selby-Dreier Debate on ''Advocacy Teaching'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Like most legal skills, trial advocacy evolved through the apprenticeship and practice of attorneys.  Even after 1900 (when the education of attorneys shifted to [[law schools]]&lt;ref&gt;Harno, Albert James (2004), ''Legal Education in the United States'' p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;) most law schools offered little education in advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;Kutcher, Edward A.; Lee, Robert B. (1962) ''The Deterioration of Trial Advocacy-Are the Laws Schools Responsible?''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Bar Association (1967) ''The Law School Curriculum and Advocacy Training''&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1969, in response to criticism within the judicial system that law schools were not properly preparing attorneys for trial practice, a group of lawyers and law professors combined to form the [[National Institute for Trial Advocacy]] (NITA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nita.org/About#History NITA website]&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, many law schools have added or improved their instruction in trial advocacy, and numerous [[Continuing Legal Education]] organizations have offered classes surveying the subject area, and on specific topics within the field.  Currently nearly one dozen law schools in the United States offer [[Master of Law]] (LL.M.) degrees in trial advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;Owens, Eric, Princeton Review (2013) ''The Best 168 Law Schools''&lt;/ref&gt;
Trial advocacy originally focused on individual actions within the trial, proposing methods for improved selection of jurors, delivery of argument, and direct and cross examination.  However, in the 1970s, NITA advanced the concepts of theme and theory as methods of integrating the various components into a cohesive whole.&lt;ref&gt;Lubet, Steven (2004) ''Modern Trial Advocacy''&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, [[Litigation Strategy|litigation strategy]] has blossomed with the importation of concepts from economic [[game theory]], [[Complexity theory and organizations|complexity theory]], [[Gestalt psychology]], and the application of [[maneuver warfare]] as a means not only of integrating the various actions within the trial into a comprehensive case, but also as a means of gaining a decisive advantage over opposing counsel.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier, A.S. (2012) ''Strategy, Planning &amp; Litigating to Win''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topics in trial advocacy==
The topics commonly encompassed within Trial Advocacy are:

===Jury selection or ''voir dire''===
{{Main|Jury selection|Voir dire}}
The selection of jurors that will be receptive to the argument the attorney intends to make.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Lubet, p. 529 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opening statement===
{{Main|Opening statement}}
Presenting a non-argumentative overview of what the jury will see, often in the context of the attorney’s theme, theory and story.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Lubet, p. 8 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direct examination===
{{Main|Direct examination}}
Eliciting evidence from one’s own witnesses through non-[[leading question]]s.  Because studies have shown that people best remember the first and the most recent (last) information heard (methods referred to as [[Serial position effect|primacy and recency]]), the preferred method is to start with an engaging and favorable topic, move through more mundane matters, and to finish on a strong, favorable point.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Lubet, p. 45 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cross examination===
{{Main|Cross examination}}
Working with witnesses offered by the opposing party who may be [[hostile witness|hostile]] or uncooperative.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Lubet, p. 83 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Closing argument===
{{Main|Closing argument}} 
Using [[argument]] to create within the jurors a perception of what they have seen and heard that influences them to find in favor of the attorney’s client.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Lubet, p. 467 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dreier, A.S. (2012) ''Strategy, Planning &amp; Litigating to Win'' p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persuasion===
{{Main|Persuasion}}
The general principles that enable an advocate to make the jurors more receptive to his claims.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Lubet, p. 16, 32 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mock trial===
{{Main|Mock trial}}
In mock trial, students take responsibility for the [[prosecution]]/[[plaintiff]] or [[defense counsel|defense]] case in a trial presented using fabricated evidence, and role-players as witnesses and faculty or volunteers as judge or jury.  It evaluates the participants’ skills in argument, evidence handling, and examination of witnesses, but omits jury selection and strategic matters.  Mock trial differs from [[moot court]] in that moot court practices appellate argument, and so involves no handling of witnesses or evidence, but rather is an exercise in legal research and oral advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;Korzen, John (2010) ''Make Your Argument: Succeeding in Moot Court and Mock Trial''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basic trial strategy===
{{Main|Litigation strategy}}
The means of organizing a case into a clear and complete presentation.
* Case Diagrams: In which the attorney charts the elements he / she intends to prove (or attack) and the evidence that will support each. These ensures the case is comprehensively addressed.&lt;ref&gt;see, e.g. Indiana Law School web site [http://www.law.indiana.edu/instruction/tanford/web/reference/basictactics.html], accessed March 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
* Theme and Theory: The theme is a sound bite that captures the emotional appeal of the case, and the theory is an explanation of events.  These serve as strategic focal points, allowing individual actions (opening, examination of each witness, etc.) to be united with a common focus, and in a way that clarifies and reinforces the perception of the case the attorney wants the jury or judge to adopt.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Lubet, p. 411 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advanced trial strategy===
{{Main|Litigation strategy}}
The means of organizing the case to maximize the combined impact of every element, and to overwhelm or outmaneuver the opposing counsel while presenting a clear, decisive argument to the jury (or judge, in the case of bench trials).&lt;ref&gt;Dreier, A.S. (2012) ''Strategy, Planning &amp; Litigating to Win'' pp. 1–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Advanced strategic skills, based upon [[psychology]] and [[maneuver warfare|military maneuver philosophy]], are generally learned outside the classroom, as few law schools teach them.  In fact, [[academic]]s have criticized advanced strategic techniques for tipping [[verdict]]s through means unrelated to the [[merit (law)|merits of the case]].  For example, these techniques may be used to cause an advocate unfamiliar with them to take actions that unwittingly undermine his client’s interests.  There is particular concern regarding the use of advanced strategic techniques by [[prosecutor]]s, who already wield the substantial power of the State against often poorly resourced defendants.

The counterargument is that strategy can correct already-existing imbalances in the justice system, such as when inexperienced advocates must face highly experienced ones, when [[law firm|small firms]] oppose large ones, and when poor clients must litigate their rights against wealthy ones.  Under the current system, without a well-developed strategy, a small firm with a poor client stands almost no chance of success against a large firm with its greater resources, regardless of the merits of the case.
* [[Litigation strategy|Maneuver strategy]] An alternative to arguing the evidence or the law, maneuver strategies pursue solutions such as redirecting the focus of the trial, reshaping the way events are perceived, or disrupting or surprising the opposing counsel, rendering him ineffective at responding to unfolding events.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  While these methods are practiced widely, even by advocates not educated in strategy, some object to this as improper even when practiced ethically, as it subordinates the importance of the evidence and the law in determining a trial's outcome.  One proponent of maneuver strategy, however, has noted that regardless of whether the attorney intends to leverage the tools of maneuver strategy, the attorney must understand the methods or she will be ill-equipped to identify and counter them.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier, pp. 86–8&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gestalt psychology]] This branch of psychology focuses on how things are perceived in whole as opposed to how individual components appear.  It aids in ensuring the jury (or judge, in bench trials) perceives events as the attorney desires, and it offers a means of shaping the way witnesses and opposing counsel will perceive the problems an attorney raises for them during trial.  When coupled with game theory, shaping perception allows an attorney to influence or shape the actions the hostile witness or counsel take.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier pp. 37–40, 83–4&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Game theory]] Game theory offers models of how people make decisions.  In trial practice, game theory is useful in predicting the likely actions witnesses will take when presented with a decision.  Because decisions are framed according to how they perceive a situation, when game theory is coupled with Gestalt psychology, attorneys can present problems to witnesses or opposing counsel in a way that increases the likelihood of them making decisions about their responses that improve the attorney's strategic position.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier pp. 62–8&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Litigation strategy|Lines of effort]] In the way a case diagram matches evidence to elements, the line of effort matches actions to specific effects the attorney intends to the various results that achieve her or his goal.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier pp. 47–65&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''UNASUR Constitutive Treaty''', officially the '''Constitutive Treaty of the Union of South American Nations''', was signed on May 23, 2008 during the extraordinary summit of heads of state and government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) held in [[Brasília]], [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7417896.stm South America nations found union] ''[[BBC]]'', accessed on May 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It officially established the [[Union of South American Nations]], a [[intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental]] [[continental union]] of twelve [[South American]] nations.

==Treaty content==
The treaty consists of 27 relatively short sections, and is the constitution of the new union. It outlines its structure and organs, and assumes that additional documents fill in the details.

===Summary===
The treaty declares the establishment and objects of the Union (in §§&amp;nbsp;1-3), its organs (§§&amp;nbsp;4-10 and 17), juridical foundation (§§&amp;nbsp;11-13 and 22-27), and financial foundation (§&amp;nbsp;16). It regulates the acceptance of new associate or full members and the right of cessation from the union in §§&amp;nbsp;19, 20, 24, and 26, and the rules for adopting amendments to the treaty in §&amp;nbsp;25. Finally, §§&amp;nbsp;14, 15, 18, and 21 declare the intent to employ dialogue among the member states, with its citizens, with third parties, and as the means for conflict resolution.

===Membership===
The 12 original signatories of the document have presented documentation of ratification to the Ecuadorian government. Other [[Latin America]]n and [[Caribbean]] states may be admitted as associated members. An associated member may apply for and be granted full membership, but only after having been associated for at least four years, and only after five years have elapsed since the treaty came into force. This implies that no new full members outside the original twelve can be admitted before March 11, 2016.

A full or associated member state may unilaterally withdraw from the union. To do so, the state must deposit their cessation documentation in a similar manner as the ratification, and the cessation will take effect six months after the deposition.  However, cessation of membership will not free states from any financial debts to the Union for unpaid membership fees or otherwise.

At the time the treaty came into force on March 11, 2011, it had been ratified by [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Guyana]], [[Peru]], [[Suriname]], [[Uruguay]], and [[Venezuela]]. The two other original signatories, [[Brazil]] and [[Paraguay]], had not yet completed the ratification process by that date.  By December 14, 2011, when Colombia deposited its instruments of ratification of the Constitutive Treaty with the Government of the Republic of Ecuador, the process was complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.el-nacional.com/noticia/14178/11/Colombia-y-Ecuador-acordaron-mejorar-seguridad-y-transporte-en-la-frontera.html|title=Colombia y Ecuador acordaron mejorar seguridad y transporte en la frontera|date=2011-12-14|accessdate=2012-01-14|language=Spanish|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114165435/http://www.el-nacional.com/noticia/14178/11/Colombia-y-Ecuador-acordaron-mejorar-seguridad-y-transporte-en-la-frontera.html|archive-date=2012-01-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amendments===
Any member state may suggest amendments to the constitutional treaty. In order to be adopted, an amendment must be approved by the Council of Heads of State and Government, and then ratified by at least nine member states.

==Additional Protocol==
{{wikisource|Additional Protocol to the Constitutive Treaty of the Union of South American Nations on Commitment to Democracy}}
On November 26, 2010, during the [[2010 South American Summit]], representatives introduced a democratic clause to the Constitutive Treaty of the Union of South American Nations. The [[amend (motion)|amend]]ment specifies measures to be taken against member-states whose political processes are not respected. The clause establishes sanctions, such as shutting down borders and the suspension of trade against the country that suffers an attempted coup.

The decision to include a democratic clause was made after the recent [[2010 Ecuador crisis|upheaval in Ecuador]] that briefly threatened the administration of President, [[Rafael Correa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.telam.com.ar/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=10270:unasur-summit-condemned-attempt-of-coup-daetat-in-ecuador-and-reasserted-commitment-to-democratic-institutions&amp;catid=42:politics UNASUR Summit condemned attempt of coup d´etat in Ecuador and reasserted commitment to democratic institutions] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706082439/http://english.telam.com.ar/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=10270%3Aunasur-summit-condemned-attempt-of-coup-daetat-in-ecuador-and-reasserted-commitment-to-democratic-institutions&amp;catid=42%3Apolitics |date=2011-07-06 }} Telam.

==Entering into force==
On March 11, 2011, when the Constitutive Treaty entered into legal force, establishing the [[Union of South American Nations]] as an international [[legal personality]], the Foreign Ministers of the [[Member State of the Union of South American Nations|UNASUR member states]] met at [[Ciudad Mitad del Mundo]], [[Ecuador]], to celebrate the event and lay the foundation stone of the UNASUR Secretariat headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telesurtv.net/secciones/noticias/89973-NN/sede-de-unasur-llevara-el-nombre-de-nestor-kirchner |title=Sede de Unasur llevará el nombre de Néstor Kirchner |publisher=telesur |date=09-03-2011 |language=es |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901073430/http://www.telesurtv.net/secciones/noticias/89973-NN/sede-de-unasur-llevara-el-nombre-de-nestor-kirchner/ |archivedate=September 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
