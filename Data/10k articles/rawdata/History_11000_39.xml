The "general crisis" thesis generated controversy between supporters of this theory and those, such as the Marxist historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]], who believed in the "general crisis," but saw the problems of 17th-century Europe as more social and economic in origin than Trevor-Roper would allow. A third faction comprised those who simply denied there was any "general crisis," including Lublinskaya, Dutch historian Ivo Schöffer and the Danish historian Niels Steengsgaard.&lt;ref&gt;Rabb, Theodore K.''The Struggle for Stability in Early Modern Europe'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1975 pages 20–21 &amp; 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her professional publications number over 200, on a great variety of topics, but can be broken into three categories: works on [[paleography]], critical publication of historical documents, and monographs and articles on the social and political history of medieval and early modern France ("[[middle ages]]" in Soviet chronology extended to about 1650).&lt;ref name=lossky/&gt;

Her ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' was a series of books on the history of the administration of [[Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]].&lt;ref name=lossky/&gt; The first book was ''Frantsiia v nachale XVII veka'' (1610-1622 gg.)  "France at the beginning of the 17th century, 1610-1620" published in 1959. This was followed by ''French Absolutism: the Crucial Phase, 1620-1629'' in 1965. A third book was published just before her death covering the years 1630-42.&lt;ref name=lossky/&gt; Another major work was ''Frantsuzskie krest'iane v XVI-XVIII vv.'' ("French peasants in the 16th-18th centuries"), published in 1978.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1470">'''Akakor''' is the name of a mythological ancient underground city, located somewhere between [[Brazil]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Peru]].

It was described by German journalist [[Karl Brugger]], based on interviews with a self-proclaimed Brazilian Indian chieftain [[Tatunca Nara]] in his book ''The Chronicle of Akakor'' (1976). Although Brugger was apparently convinced, the information in it has only one source (Tatunca Nara), who was later exposed by activist and adventurer [[Rüdiger Nehberg]] as being Günther Hauck, a German.

Elements of the story from ''The Chronicle of Akakor'' were used in the film
''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'', where they were conflated with [[El Dorado]], although references are to "Akator".&lt;ref&gt;[http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/05/10/film-preview-part-one-indiana-jones-kingdom-of-the-crystal-skull/  Film Preview (Pt.

West Lafayette, IN: C-SPAN Archives, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randomhouse.com/features/americancentury/frame.html The American Century]. randomhouse.com.&lt;/ref&gt; is a characterization of the period since the middle of the 20th century as being largely dominated by the United States in political, economic, and cultural terms. It is comparable to the description of the period 1815–1914 as [[Britain's Imperial Century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Ronald|last=Hyam|title=Britain's Imperial Century, 1815–1914: A Study of Empire and Expansion|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2002|isbn=978-0-7134-3089-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2eMoHQAACAAJ|accessdate=December 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States' influence grew throughout the 20th century, but became especially dominant after the end of [[World War II]], when only two superpowers remained, the United States and the [[Soviet Union]]. After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the United States remained the world's only superpower,&lt;ref name="Paper for presentation at the biennial meetings of the South African Political Studies Association Saldanha, Western Cape 29 June – 2 July 1999"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://post.queensu.ca/~nossalk/papers/hyperpower.htm|title=Analyzing American Power in the Post-Cold War Era|accessdate=February 28, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070311021450/http://post.queensu.ca/~nossalk/papers/hyperpower.htm| archivedate= March 11, 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became the [[hegemon]], or what some have termed a [[hyperpower]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordspy.com/words/hyper-power.asp Definition and Use of the Word ''Hyperpower'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the phrase==
The term was coined by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' publisher [[Henry Luce]] to describe what he thought the role of the United States would be and should be during the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;David Harvey, ''The New Imperialism'', (New York: Oxford University Press, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Luce, the son of a missionary, in a February 17, 1941 ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine editorial&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Luce|Luce, Henry]] (February 17, 1941) [https://books.google.com/books?id=I0kEAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=century&amp;f=false The American Century], ''[[Life Magazine]]''&lt;/ref&gt; urged the United States to forsake [[isolationism]] for a missionary's role, acting as the world's [[Good Samaritan]] and spreading democracy. He called upon the US to enter [[World War II]] to defend democratic values:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Throughout the 17th century and the 18th century and the 19th century, this continent teemed with manifold projects and magnificent purposes.  Above them all and weaving them all together into the most exciting flag of all the world and of all history was the triumphal purpose of freedom.
&lt;br&gt;
It is in this spirit that all of us are called, each to his own measure of capacity, and each in the widest horizon of his vision, to create the first great American Century.&lt;ref&gt;Luce, H. R: "The American Century" reprinted in ''The Ambiguous Legacy'', M. J. Hogan, ed. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Democracy and other American ideals would "do their mysterious work of lifting the life of mankind from the level of the beasts to what the Psalmist called a little lower than the angels". Only under the American Century can the world "come to life in any nobility of health and vigor".&lt;ref&gt;Henry Luce, "The American Century", ''Life'', (February 17, 1941): pp. 64–65, https://books.google.co.il/books?id=I0kEAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=century&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]], Luce believed "the power conferred was global and universal rather than territorially specific, so Luce preferred to talk of an American century rather than an empire".&lt;ref&gt;David Harvey, ''The New Imperialism'', (New York: Oxford University Press, 2003), 50.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same article he called upon United States "to exert upon the world the full impact of our influence, for such purposes as we see fit and by such means as we see fit".&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Hogan, ''The ambiguous legacy: U.S. foreign relations in the "American century"'', (Cambridge University Press, 1999),  [https://books.google.com/books?id=T_QfEZw6hKkC&amp;pg=PA20 p. 20].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early characteristics==
[[Image:GreaterAmericaMap.jpg|thumb|250px|Post-[[Spanish–American War]] map of "Greater America"]]
Beginning at the end of the 19th century, with the [[Spanish–American War]] in 1898 and the [[Boxer Rebellion]], the United States began to play a more prominent role in the world beyond the North American continent. The government adopted [[protectionism]] after the Spanish–American War to develop its native industry and built up the navy, the "[[Great White Fleet]]". When [[Theodore Roosevelt]] became president in 1901, he accelerated a foreign policy shift away from [[isolationism]] and towards foreign involvement, a process which had begun under his predecessor [[William McKinley]].

For instance, the United States fought the [[Philippine–American War]] against the [[First Philippine Republic]] to solidify its control over the newly acquired Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;John M. Gates (August 1984) [http://www3.wooster.edu/History/jgates/book-ch3.html "War-Related Deaths in the Philippines"] ''Pacific Historical Review'' , v. 53, no. 3, 367–78.
{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140629045949/http://www3.wooster.edu/History/jgates/book-ch3.html |date=June 29, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, Roosevelt committed the United States to building the [[Panama Canal]], creating the [[Panama Canal Zone]]. Interventionism found its formal articulation in the 1904 [[Roosevelt Corollary]] to the [[Monroe Doctrine]], proclaiming a right for the United States to intervene anywhere in the Americas, a moment that underlined the emergent US regional [[hegemony]].

After the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, the United States pursued a policy of [[non-intervention]], avoiding conflict while trying to broker a peace. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] later argued that the war was so important that the US had to have a voice in the peace conference.&lt;ref name="Karp-PoW-1979"&gt;{{harvnb|Karp|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States was never formally a member of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] but entered the war in 1917 as a self-styled "Associated Power". Initially the United States had a small army, but, after the passage of the [[Selective Service Act of 1917|Selective Service Act]], it drafted 2.8 million men,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sss.gov/induct.htm |title=Selective Service System: History and Records |publisher=Sss.gov |accessdate=July 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507211238/http://www.sss.gov/induct.htm |archivedate=May 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, by summer 1918, was sending 10,000 fresh soldiers to France every day. The war ended in 1919 with the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The United States then adopted a policy of [[isolationism]], having refused to endorse the 1919 [[Versailles Treaty]] or formally enter the [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, David M., ''Freedom From Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929–1945'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999) 386&lt;/ref&gt;

During the interwar period, economic [[protectionism]] took hold in the United States, particularly as a result of the [[Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act]] which is credited by economists with the prolonging and worldwide propagation of the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011"&gt;{{cite book |title=International Financial Management, 6th Edition |author=Eun, Cheol S. |author2=Resnick, Bruce G. |year=2011 |publisher=McGraw-Hill/Irwin |location=New York |isbn=978-0-07-803465-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|33}} From 1934, [[trade liberalization]] began to take place through the [[Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act]].

With the onset of [[World War II]] in 1939, Congress loosened the [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s]] but remained opposed to entering the [[World War II in Europe|European war]].&lt;ref name="Schmitz 2000 124"&gt;{{Harvnb|Schmitz|2000|p=124}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, the United States ranked 18th in terms of military power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WWII Overview|url=http://www.nationalww2museum.org/learn/education/for-students/ww2-history/overview.html|publisher=The National WWII Museum|accessdate=February 28, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305070506/http://www.nationalww2museum.org/learn/education/for-students/ww2-history/overview.html|archive-date=March 5, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ssi.armywarcollege.edu/pubs/summary.cfm?q=358|title=Excerpt – General George C.

American public opinion remained isolationist. The 800,000-member [[America First Committee]] vehemently opposed any American intervention in the European conflict, even as the US sold military aid to the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union through the [[Lend-Lease]] program.

In the 1941 State of the Union address, known as the [[Four Freedoms]] speech, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] made a break with the tradition of [[non-interventionism]]. He outlined the US role in helping allies already engaged in warfare. By August, President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] had drafted the [[Atlantic Charter]] to define goals for the post-war world.&lt;ref&gt;Langer and Gleason, chapter 21&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1941, Japan attacked American and British holdings with near-simultaneous [[Japanese expansion (1941–1942)|offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific]] including an [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attack on the US fleet at Pearl Harbor]].&lt;ref name="Wohlstetter 1962 341_343"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wohlstetter|1962|pp=341–43}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These attacks led the United States and United Kingdom to declare war on Japan. Three days later, Germany and Italy declared war on the United States, which the United States reciprocated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunn|1998|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to maintain peace after World War II,&lt;ref name="Yoder 1997 39"&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoder|1997|p=39}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] formed the [[United Nations]], which came into existence on October 24, 1945,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/aboutun/history.htm|title=History of the UN|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=January 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and adopted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948, as a common standard for all member states.&lt;ref name="Waltz 2002"&gt;{{Harvnb|Waltz|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. worked closely with the United Kingdom to establish the [[IMF]], [[World Bank]] and [[NATO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://rooseveltinstitute.org/special-relationship-between-great-britain-and-united-states-began-fdr/|title=The "Special Relationship" between Great Britain and the United States Began with FDR.|date=2010-07-22|work=Roosevelt Institute|access-date=2018-01-24|quote=and the joint efforts of both powers to create a new post-war strategic and economic order through the drafting of the Atlantic Charter; the establishment of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank; and the creation of the United Nations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/04/22/remarks-president-obama-and-prime-minister-cameron-joint-press|title=Remarks by the President Obama and Prime Minister Cameron in Joint Press Conference|date=2016-04-22|work=whitehouse.gov|access-date=2018-01-24|quote=That's what we built after World War II.

[[Pax Americana]] represents the relative [[peace]] in the Western world, resulting in part from the preponderance of [[power (international relations)|power]] enjoyed by the United States of America starting around the middle of the 20th century. Although the term finds its primary utility in the late 20th century, it has been used in other times in the 20th century. Its modern connotations concern the peace established after the end of World War II in 1945.

==Post-1945 characteristics==

The ''American Century'' existed through the [[Cold War]] and demonstrated the status of the United States as the foremost of the world's two superpowers. After the Cold War, the most common belief held that only the United States fulfilled the criteria to be considered a superpower.&lt;ref name="Paper for presentation at the biennial meetings of the South African Political Studies Association Saldanha, Western Cape 29 June – 2 July 1999"/&gt; Its geographic area composed the [[List of countries and dependencies by area|fourth-largest state in the world]], with an area of approximately 9.37 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theodora.com/wfb1989/united_states/united_states_geography.html US geography]&lt;/ref&gt; The population of the US was 248.7 million in 1990, at that time the third-largest nation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/population/censusdata/table-2.pdf US Census] census.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-to-late 20th century, the political status of the US was defined as a strongly capitalist federation and constitutional republic. It had a permanent seat on the [[United Nations Security Council]] plus two allies with permanent seats, the [[United Kingdom–United States relations|United Kingdom]] and [[France–United States relations|France]]. The US had strong ties with capitalist Western Europe, Latin America, [[British Commonwealth]], and several East Asian countries ([[South Korea–United States relations|Korea]], [[Republic of China–United States relations|Taiwan]], [[Japan–United States relations|Japan]]). It allied itself with both right-wing dictatorships and capitalist democracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Kinzer |title=Overthrow: America's Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq |publisher=Times Books |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Century includes the political influence of the United States but also its economic influence. Many [[State (polity)|states]] around the world would, over the course of the 20th century, adopt the economic policies of the [[Washington Consensus]], sometimes against the wishes of their populations. The economic force of the US was powerful at the end of the century due to it being by far the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|largest economy in the world]]. The US had large resources of minerals, energy resources, metals, and timber, a large and modernized farming industry and large industrial base. The United States dollar is the dominant world [[reserve currency]] under the [[Bretton Woods system]]. US systems were rooted in capitalist economic theory based on supply and demand, that is, production determined by customers' demands. America was allied with the [[G7]] major economies. US economic policy prescriptions were the "standard" reform packages promoted for [[Economic crisis|crisis-wracked]] [[developing country|developing countries]] by Washington, DC-based international institutions such as the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), [[World Bank]], as well as the [[US Treasury Department]].&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, John: [http://www.iie.com/publications/papers/paper.cfm?researchid=486 What Washington Means by Policy Reform] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625085003/http://www.iie.com/publications/papers/paper.cfm?ResearchID=486 |date=June 25, 2009 }}, in: Williamson, John (ed.): ''Latin American Readjustment: How Much has Happened'', Washington: Institute for International Economics 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[military of the United States]] was a naval-based advanced military with by far the [[List of countries by military expenditures|highest military expenditure]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/spending.htm Military spending]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Navy]] was the world's largest navy, with the largest number of [[aircraft carrier]]s, bases all over the world (particularly in an incomplete "ring" bordering the [[Warsaw Pact]] states to the west, south and east). The US had the largest [[nuclear arsenal]] in the world during the first half of the Cold War, one of the largest armies in the world and one of the two largest air forces in the world. Its powerful military allies in Western Europe (the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] states) had their own nuclear capabilities. The US also possessed a powerful global intelligence network in the [[Central Intelligence Agency]].

The cultural impact of the US, often known as [[Americanization]], is seen in the influence on other countries of US music, TV, films, art, and fashion, as well as the desire for [[freedom of speech]] and other guaranteed rights its residents enjoy. US pop stars such as [[Elvis Presley]], [[Michael Jackson]], and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] have become global celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;Biddle, Julian (2001).

==Criticism and usage==
Critics have condemned Luce's "[[Jingoism|jingoistic]] missionary zeal".&lt;ref&gt;Michael, Terry (February 16, 2011) [http://reason.com/archives/2011/02/16/the-end-of-the-american-centur The End of the American Century], ''[[Reason magazine|Reason]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Others have noted the end of the 20th century and the American Century, most famously the late [[Gonzo journalism|gonzo]] journalist [[Hunter S. Thompson]] who titled his autobiography ''Kingdom of Fear: Loathsome Secrets of a Star Crossed Child in the Last Days of the American Century''.

With the advent of the new [[millennium]], critics from the [[University of Illinois]] stated that it was a matter of debate whether America was losing its superpower status, especially in relation to [[Chinese Century|China's rise]].&lt;ref name="uiuc-superpower"&gt;Unger J (2008), [http://www.news.uiuc.edu/news/08/0508superpower.html U.S. no longer superpower, now a besieged global power, scholars say] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006183338/http://www.news.uiuc.edu/news/08/0508superpower.html |date=October 6, 2008 }} ''University of Illinois''&lt;/ref&gt; Other analysts have made the case for the "American Century" fitting neatly between America's late entry into [[World War I]] in 1917 and the inauguration of its 45th President in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/comment-and-analysis/donald-trump-in-the-white-house-is-the-end-of-the-american-century-20170119-gtv1ae.html|title=Donald Trump in the White House is the end of the 'American Century'|last=Pascoe|first=Michael|date=January 20, 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=January 21, 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars, such as [[George Friedman]], stipulate that the 21st century will be the U.S. century: "The twenty-first century will be the American century."&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, George, [https://www.amazon.com/Next-100-Years-Forecast-Century/dp/038551705X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1498628991&amp;sr=1-1 ''The Next 100 Years: A Forecast for the 21st Century''], p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Artur Eisenbach''' (born 7 April 1906 in [[Nowy Sącz]], died 30 October 1992 in [[Tel Aviv]]) was a [[Polish-Jewish]] historian; an expert on the [[history of Jews in Poland]], member of [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] and the head of the [[Jewish Historical Institute]] in [[Warsaw]] between 1966 and 1968.&lt;ref name=yivo&gt;Antony Polonsky, [http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Eisenbach_Artur The YIVO encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe, Volume 1, pg. 463] ''[[YIVO]] Institute for Jewish Research'', 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Eisenbach studied history briefly at the Jewish Educational Seminary in Vilna and then at the [[Warsaw University]] under [[Marceli Handelsman]]. Afterwards, he worked at the Society for Jewish Health Care in Poland (Towarzystwo Ochrony Zdrowia Ludności Żydowskiej w Polsce, TOZ).&lt;ref name=yivo/&gt;

He married the sister of a fellow historian, and later ghetto chronicler, [[Emanuel Ringelblum]].&lt;ref name=yivo/&gt; After the [[Nazi invasion of Poland]] on 1 September 1939 Artur, along with his wife and child, escaped to his wife's hometown [[Kresy|in the east]], the small town of [[Buczacz]] (now Buchach, [[Ukraine]]). However, as a consequence of the Nazi-Soviet pact known as the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Treaty]], on 17 September the Soviet Union also invaded Poland and Buczacz fell within the [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Soviet occupation zone]]. Along with 1,200,000 other Poles, Artur Eisenbach was [[Soviet repressions of Polish citizens (1939–1946)#Mass deportations to the East|deported deep within the Soviet Union]]. His wife and daughter stayed behind. In July 1941, after the [[Operation Barbarossa|Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union]], Buczacz was taken over by the Germans. Eisenbach's wife and daughter subsequently were murdered by the Nazis.&lt;ref name=yivo/&gt;

Eisenbach returned to Poland from the Soviet Union in 1946 and settled in Warsaw. In the same year he became the chief archivist of the Jewish Historical Institute (JHI) in Warsaw.&lt;ref name=yivo/&gt; He was a member of the PPR
Polska Partia Robotnicza), the communist party in Poland from 1942 to 1948, and after 1948 member of the reconstituted PZPR (Polska Zjednoczona Partia Robotnicza).  In 1966, Eisenbach became the director of the JHI and joined the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]]. In 1968, he was persecuted by the communist authorities of the [[People's Republic of Poland]] during the anti-Zionist events in the aftermath of Israel's Six Day War [[1968 Polish political crisis]] ("the March events") and forced to resign as director JHI. Unlike many other Poles of Jewish background who left Poland after these events, Artur Eisenbach chose to remain in the country and continued his studies. Subsequently, he also wrote a series of monographs on Polish Jewish history.&lt;ref name=yivo/&gt; He was a historical consultant on film [[Austeria]] by [[Kawalerowicz]] in 1982.

Eisenbach emigrated to [[Israel]] towards the end of his life, in 1987, where he worked at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] and [[Yad Vashem]]. Facing terminal illness, he committed suicide in 1992.

The '''Ballymurphy Massacre''' was a series of incidents between 9 and 11 August 1971 in which the [[1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment]] of the [[British Army]] killed eleven civilians in [[Ballymurphy, Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]], as part of [[Operation Demetrius]]. The shootings were later referred to as Belfast's Bloody Sunday, a reference to the [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|killing of civilians by the same battalion]] in [[Derry]] a few months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/united-kingdom/belfast-bloody-sunday-inquiry-called-for-38259.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130220194633/http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/united-kingdom/belfast-bloody-sunday-inquiry-called-for-38259.html|archivedate=20 February 2013|title=Belfast 'Bloody Sunday' Inquiry Called For|author=Damian Robin|publisher=The Epoch Times|date=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Northern Ireland [[The Troubles|Troubles]] had been ongoing for two years, and Belfast was particularly affected by political and sectarian violence. The British Army had been deployed in Northern Ireland in 1969, as events had got beyond the control of the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]].

On the morning of Monday 9 August 1971, the security forces launched Operation Demetrius. The plan was to arrest and [[internment|intern]] anyone suspected of being a member of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]]. The unit selected for this operation was the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]]. Members of the Parachute Regiment stated that, as they entered the Ballymurphy area, they were shot at by republicans and returned fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-12511377 |title= Ballymurphy families meet First Minister Peter Robinson |publisher= BBC News |date= 18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mike Jackson (British Army officer)|Mike Jackson]], later to become head of the British Army, includes a disputed account of the shootings in his autobiography, and his then role as press officer for the British Army stationed in Belfast while the incidents happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Mike Jackson|date= 2007|title = Soldier: The Autobiography | publisher = Bantam Press | isbn = 978-0593059074 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This account states that those killed in the shootings were Republican gunmen. This claim has been strongly denied by the Catholic families of those killed in the shootings, in interviews conducted during the documentary film The Ballymurphy Precedent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.channel4.com/programmes/massacre-at-ballymurphy | publisher = Channel 4 | website = channel4.com | title = Massacre at Ballymurphy | date = 8 September 2018 | accessdate = 14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://theballymurphyprecedent.com/ | publisher = theballymurphyprecedent.com | title = The Ballymurphy Precedent - Documentary | accessdate = 14 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Sir [[Declan Morgan]], the [[Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland]], recommended an [[inquest]] into the killings as one of a series of "legacy inquests" covering 56 cases related to the Troubles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=18 January 2016|last=Kearney|first=Vincent|title=The Troubles: Judge begins review of inquests|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-35327073|work=BBC News|location=London, UK|access-date=4 May 2016|quote=There are 56 cases involving 97 deaths. … The stalled inquests into the Army shootings of 10 people in Ballymurphy, west Belfast, in 1971, and of five more civilians in nearby Springhill a year later, were examined on the opening day in Laganside Courts.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=12 February 2016|title=Legacy inquests in Northern Ireland 'can be dealt with in five years'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-35562197|work=BBC News|location=London, UK|access-date=4 May 2016|quote=After a review of more than 50 outstanding cases it has been decided that all are suitable for inquest.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These inquests were delayed as funding was not approved by the [[Northern Ireland Executive]]. The former Stormont first minister [[Arlene Foster]] of the DUP deferred a bid for extra funding for inquests into historic killings in Northern Ireland,&lt;ref name="irishnews_2018-03-08"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2018/03/08/arlene-foster-wrong-to-defer-bid-for-legacy-inquest-funding-says-judge-1273548/?ref=sh|title=Arlene Foster wrong to defer bid for legacy inquest funding, says judge|website=The Irish News}}&lt;/ref&gt; a decision condemned by the human rights group [[Amnesty International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=3 May 2016|last=Kearney|first=Vincent|title=Lord Chief Justice legacy inquests plan put on hold|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-36198471|work=BBC News|location=London, UK|access-date=4 May 2016|quote=A radical plan by Northern Ireland's most senior judge to deal with inquests into some of the most controversial killings of the Troubles has been put on hold.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foster confirmed she had used her influence in the devolved power-sharing executive to hold back finance for a backlog of inquests connected to the conflict.&lt;ref name="irishnews_2018-03-08"/&gt; The High Court said "her decision to refuse to put a funding paper on the Executive basis was unlawful and procedurally flawed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/arlene-foster-will-not-pay-damages-over-blocking-legacy-inquest-funding-plan-36712780.html|title=Arlene Foster will not pay damages over blocking legacy inquest funding plan|publisher=|via=www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, the coroner's office announced that the inquest is due to begin in September 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2018/01/19/news/coroner-in-ballymurphy-shootings-inquest-appeals-for-witnesses-to-come-forward-1236730/|title=Coroner in Ballymurphy shootings' inquest appeals for witnesses to come forward|first=Michael McHugh, Press|last=Association|website=The Irish News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4165">'''Bartholomew MacCarthy''' (b. [[Conna]], Ballynoe, [[County Cork]], 12 Dec., 1843; d. Inniscarra, Co. Cork, 6 Mar., 1904) was a scholar and chronologist who wrote extensively on [[Early Irish literature]]. 

He was educated at Mount Melleray [[Seminary]], [[County Waterford]], and at [[St Colman's College, Fermoy]], Co. Cork, afterwards studying at Rome, where he was ordained in 1869. On his return to Ireland he was appointed professor of [[Classics]] at St. Colman's, where he remained about three years. He then went as [[curate]] to [[Mitchelstown]] (where he was at the time of a massacre in 1887), and afterwards to [[Macroom]] and [[Youghal]]. In 1895 he was appointed parish priest of Inniscarra, near Cork, where he died.  A few months before his death, he had been chosen by the Government on the recommendation of the Council of the Royal Irish Academy to edit the ''Annals of Tighearnach''. He often spoke critically of his predecessors, for instance of [[John Colgan]], the O'Clerys, [[Eugene O'Curry]], etc., and of contemporary scholars.&lt;ref&gt;cf. ''Irish Ecclesiastical Record'', 1883, and ''Gaelic Journal'', I, 8, 263&lt;/ref&gt; A letter of his criticising a favourable review of John Salmon's ''Ancient Irish Church as a Witness to Catholic Doctrine'' in the ''Irish Ecclesiastical Record'' (August, 1897, 166-170) led to a controversy between these two Catholic scholars, which was carried on in that periodical the following year.

==Published works==
*''Essays on various Early Irish Ecclesiastical Fragments'', written while he was in Rome and published mostly anonymously in the ''Irish Ecclesiastical Record'' (1864 sqq.)
*''The Stowe Missal'', perhaps his best-known work, published in the ''Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy'', XXVII (1886), 135-268, in which he establishes the date of Moelchaich's recension as about 750 or at least the eighth century, and proves that the so-called [[Middle Irish]] corruptions can be paralleled from old Irish manuscripts, none of which are later than the ninth century; he also separates the earlier portion of the text into (a) the original Mass, dating from at least A.D. 500, called "Missa Patricii" in the ''[[Book of Armagh]]'' (A.D. 807), and (b) later augments and Roman contents.
*Four Dissertations on the ''Codex Palatino-Vaticanus'', No. 830 (Chronica Mariani Scotti), published in the Todd Lecture Series of the [[Royal Irish Academy]], III (1892), illustrated by studies on [[Old Irish]] [[Meter (poetry)|Metric]], the Synchronisms from the ''[[Book of Ballymote]]'', Paschal [[Computus|computations]], and various Irish historical documents.
*''New Textual Studies on the Tripartite Life of St. Patrick'', published in the ''Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy'', XXIX, 183 sqq., in which he proves that portion of the material of the ''Vita Tripartita'' must date back to the middle of the sixth century.
*''The Annals of Ulster''.  On the death of William M. Hennessey, Dr. MacCarthy was asked by the Government to continue the editing of this collection of Irish Annals in the [[Rolls Series]]. He published vols. II (1893), III (1895), and IV (1901). In the introduction to the fourth and final volume of these annals he deals in detail of various questions connected with the history of chronology among the nations of western Europe. These include discussions of the ancient [[Paschal cycle]] of 84 years and other Paschal computations in vogue in Ireland, the origin of A.D. dating in Irish annals, the methods of rectifying errors in the same, and the history of the various British or Irish falsifications which appeared during the disputes regarding [[Easter]] in the insular churches of the West, such as the ''Acts of Caesarea'', the ''Athanasian Tractate'', the ''Book of Anatolius'', and the "Epistle" of [[Cyril of Alexandria]]. MacCarthy was recognized as an authority on the Paschal question.

[[Hand fan]]s first arrived in [[Europe]] in the 15th century from Asia and became popular in the 16th century. Several fan styles were common and a plethora of materials were used to create them. Subject matter varied greatly, from Biblical scenes to landscapes. Hand fans serve as a cooling mechanism, [[social instrument]], and [[fashion accessory]].

== History ==
Fans were used throughout history, and can be traced back as long as five thousand years ago. They developed in [[ancient Egypt]], [[India]], and [[China]] where they were used for ceremonies and practical purposes.&lt;ref name=Steele&gt;Steele, Valerie. The Fan: Fashion and Femininity Unfolded. New York: Rizzoli, 2002. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 12th century, during the [[Crusades]], the fan was brought to Europe.&lt;ref name=Alexander&gt;Alexander, Hélène. Fans. London: B.T. Batsford, 1984. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; At first, Europeans adopted the [[rigid fan]] and [[feather fan]]s. Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]] (1533–1603) owned dozens of these fans, as was shown in her portraits. Later in the 16th century, [[folding fan]]s were introduced into Europe from [[Japan]] where they originated.&lt;ref name=Steele/&gt;

[[File:Elizabeth I George Gower.jpg|Elizabeth I George Gower|thumb]]

Once the fan was known to Europe, [[France]] became the center for fan design and production. At the end of the 17th century, [[Huguenot]] immigrants traveled to [[England]], bringing the fan craft with them.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt; French fans were so popular that they were smuggled into England during the 18th century. During this time the [[Worshipful Company of Fan Makers]] tried to grow the English fan trade, but their success was small in comparison to the French industry.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt;

== Types ==
There were two main types of fans seen in Europe during the 18th century: the rigid (or fixed) fan and the folding fan.

=== Rigid fan ===

As its name implies, the rigid fan is stiff. Possible fan shapes are a leaf, a rectangle, or an oval. The fan is attached to a base where it is held.&lt;ref name=Steele/&gt;

=== Folding fan ===
The folding fan was the most popular in Europe during the 18th century, a time known as the golden age of the folding fan.&lt;ref&gt;"Fans." The Decoratosr and Furnisher 24.5 (1894): 182. JSTOR. Web. 10 Dec. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The principal folding fan styles are pleated, brisé, and cockade.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt;
[[File:Hand fan 1800 1805.jpg|Hand fan 1800 1805|thumb]]

==== Pleated fan ====
The [[pleated fan]] consists of a mount and a set of sticks. The outer sticks (the guards) are wider than the others and are often more decorated. At the base of the sticks is a pivot which connects the fan and allows it to spread and open. The base is either shaped or rounded off.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt;

==== Brisé fan ====
The [[brisé fan]] consists only of a set of sticks. These sticks are attached to a base with a pivot similar to that of a pleated fan. A cord or ribbon runs across the top of the fan, holding the sticks together.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt; 
 [[File:Hand fan 1815 1820.jpg|Hand fan 1815 1820|thumb]]

==== Cockade fan ====
[[File:Cockade Fan YORCM TFN217.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A Parisian Cockade fan of silk and ivory, 1800-1850]]
A [[cockade fan]] opens into a complete circle around the pivot. Their style can be either pleated or brisé. They were not very practical and considered too flamboyant, and thus they saw little popularity.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt;

== Materials ==
Fans in the 18th century were made from a wide variety of materials depending on their style and purpose. During the 18th century fans were a fashion accessory and thus were made from the fashionable materials of the time.&lt;ref name="Mayor, Susan 1980"&gt;Mayor, Susan. Collecting Fans. New York: Mayflower, 1980. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sticks and handles ===
Sticks and handles could be made of [[gold]], [[tortoiseshell material|tortoise shell]], [[ivory]], [[mother-of-pearl]], [[horn (anatomy)|horn]], or [[wood]]. They were often highly decorated. Most sticks and handles were not only made of the previously listed materials, but were inlaid with others. For example, a mother-of-pearl fan could be inlaid with gold. Other sticks were plain.&lt;ref name="Mayor, Susan 1980"/&gt;

=== Mounts ===
Previous to 1780, mounts were typically made of [[vellum]] or [[paper]]. Some, more valuable fans were decorated with materials used for the sticks such as mother-of-pearl.&lt;ref name="Mayor, Susan 1980"/&gt; Other decorations included [[feather]]s, [[butterfly]] wings, [[silk]], gold, and [[sequin]]s. Although not as common, the 18th century also saw [[lace]] fans.&lt;ref name="Mayor, Susan 1980"/&gt;

== Subject matter ==
European fans were often decorated with historical, political, or social images. While some fans were meant to inform, others were meant to entertain. There was fan for every occasion; whether it be a [[wedding]], a [[funeral]], or a [[dance]], there was always a fan made specifically for the event.&lt;ref name="Bennett, Anna G. 1981"&gt;Bennett, Anna G., and Ruth Berson. Fans in Fashion. [San Francisco]: Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, 1981. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Entertainment ===
Some artists designed fans which would prevent [[boredom]] during a dull event, or would start a conversation. These fans were often covered with [[riddle]]s and [[puzzle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Esdaile, Arundell. "Fans." British Museum Quarterly 14.1 (1940): 23-24. JSTOR. Web. 10 Dec. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Another type of entertainment fan was the [[fortune-telling]] fan. These presented questions such as “Whether one is to get Riches; Whether one will be successful in Love; What sort of Husband shall I have; etc.”&lt;ref name=Steele/&gt;

=== Instructive ===
The 18th century saw fans which assisted in remembering [[holiday]]s or that served as [[map]]s.&lt;ref name="Bennett, Anna G. 1981"/&gt; The fan, “Map of Warwickshire” is such a fan.&lt;ref name=Schreiber&gt;Schreiber, Charlotte. Fans and Fan-Leaves. Comp. [[Lionel Cust]]. London: Oxford UP, 1893. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historical ===
Fans commonly recorded current events.&lt;ref name="Bennett, Anna G. 1981"/&gt; There were [[souvenir]] fans that depicted scenes such as [[Vesuvius]] erupting and the [[Coliseum]]. Others celebrated public events such as a military victory.&lt;ref name=Steele/&gt; The fan, “Coronation of George II” shows the banquet of [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] and [[Caroline of Ansbach|Queen Caroline]] in [[Westminster Hall]] on their [[coronation]] day, October 11, 1727.&lt;ref name=Schreiber/&gt;

=== Biblical and classical ===
Classical [[myth]]s and biblical scenes were frequent during the early 18th century.&lt;ref name=Steele/&gt; Fans for church depicted Bible subjects such as [[Jacob]] and [[Rachel]] or [[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]] and [[Boaz]].&lt;ref name="Bennett, Anna G. 1981"/&gt; The fan, “Moses Striking the Rock” shows the Israelite encampment in the wilderness and [[Moses]] standing by the rock from which water flows.&lt;ref name=Schreiber/&gt;

=== Pastoral ===
Later in the 18th century, [[rococo]] pastoral scenes became popular. [[Landscape]]s were common as well as images with [[love]] and [[courtship]] themes. [[Cupid]] was often a principal figure on such fans.&lt;ref name=Steele/&gt; The fan, “Pastoral Landscape” shows a [[river]] landscape with men and women walking by and [[sheep]] grazing.&lt;ref name=Schreiber/&gt;

== Purposes ==

=== Practical ===
When originated, the fan’s purpose was to cool the face and keep away [[insect]]s. Before the 18th century their most common use was to keep flies away from church [[altar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Standen, Edith. "Acquisitions of Works of Art by Museums and Galleries: Supplement." The Burlington Magazine 107.750 (1965): 487. JSTOR. Web. 10 Dec. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; While driving insects away became less and less of a fan’s purpose, the fan continued to serve as a cooling mechanism.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt;

=== Fashion ===
In Europe, fans were not a necessity. They were mainly used as a fashion accessory, to complement the rest of the lady’s outfit. “Fans were as much an adjunct to a lady of fashion’s attire as were gloves or bags.”&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt; By the 18th century fans were used only by females. The fan was described as the “feminine accessory, par excellence.”&lt;ref name=Steele/&gt;

=== Propaganda ===
Subject matter such as historical and political events made fans a means of spreading [[news]] or political [[propaganda]]. Other fans contained [[brand name]]s and store fronts and thus acted as [[advertisement]]s.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt;

=== Social instrument – fan language ===
Due to their large use and popularity, fans began to affect [[gesture]]s and thus a fan “[[sign language]]” developed between 1711 and 1740.&lt;ref name="Bennett, Anna G. 1981"/&gt; In a 1740 edition of the [[Gentleman's Magazine]], there was an advertisement for “The New Fashioned Speaking FAN!”&lt;ref name=Steele/&gt; This “speaking fan” created a system whereby motions of the fan translated into letters of the alphabet. The alphabet, with the exception of J, was split into five sections. These sections corresponded to one of the following movements:

# Moving the fan with the left hand to the left arm
# Moving the fan with the right hand to the left arm
# Placing the fan against the bosom
# Raising the fan to the mouth
# Raising the fan to the forehead

In order to signal a letter two movements were necessary. The first corresponded to one of the five [[alphabet group]]s, and the second told the letter’s position in the group. For example, to signal “D”, one would use movement 1 (first section of the alphabet), followed by movement 4 (fourth letter in that section of the alphabet).&lt;ref name=Steele/&gt; 
	

== Current status ==
{{Time-context|section|date=August 2018}}
Fans are often considered minor works of art.{{according to whom?|date=August 2018}} Many survived and are in the hands of owners or museums throughout the world.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt;

'''Frederic Slater''' (c1880- 10 March 1947&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18006389 |title=Family Notices. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=12 March 1947 |accessdate=22 January 2015 |page=24 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an Australian journalist, poet, researcher and "authority on aboriginal folk lore".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article160503047 |title=AN ABORIGINAL SCULPTRESS. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Mail]] |date=3 March 1937 |accessdate=22 January 2015 |page=43 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, Slater was founder and president of the short-lived Australian Archaeological and Education Research Society, also known as the Australian Archaeological Society. He married Katherine Elizabeth Plowman, who survived him and was executor of his will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18014319 |title=Advertising. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=20 March 1947 |accessdate=20 March 2015 |page=17 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had one son, Ederic Charles James Sutherland Slater, born in January 1923.

Slater studied Aboriginal place names and archaeological sites and provided information on Aboriginal languages including, for example, the meaning of [[Canberra]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15424246 |title=TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=2 June 1913 |accessdate=8 September 2015 |page=11 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}

The Secret Visitors Project]&lt;/ref&gt; is the claim that Australian Aborigianes came from Egypt, based on carvings at Devil's Rock, [[Wollombi]], in the [[Royal National Park]], [[Brunswick Heads]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article30051046 |title=Discovery Of Aborigines' Religious Mound. |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=29 July 1939 |accessdate=22 January 2015 |page=22 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other locations. In an address at Sydney, to the [[Anthropological Society of New South Wales]]. he claimed the carvings were especially significant ''...totems, symbols and ideographs, which show that the ancestors of original Australians migrated from Egypt in the late paleolithic and the neolithic ages''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17485120 |title=NATIONAL PARK ROCK CARVINGS. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=18 August 1938 |accessdate=22 January 2015 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/27137194/The Ogden Standard-Examiner » 1937 » May » 9 May 1937, Sun » Page 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

Slater's observations and theories have been supported in recent years by other 'pseudoarchaeologists' such as [[Steven Strong]],&lt;ref&gt;Gojak, D. 2017, 'the Resurrection of Frederick Slater: Tales of a Pseudo-archaeologist in the 1930s and 2010s, in ''Defining the Fringe of Contemporary Australian Archaeology, Pyramidiots, Paranoia and the Paradormal'', ed Darran Jordan &amp; Rocco Bosco, Cambridge Scholars, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2017 the mound south of Brunswick Heads was nominated local heritage about which Salter wrote in 1939 "ABORIGINES WORSHIP MOUND-A mound 35ft. long and 15ft. high, which has been discovered about three miles from Brunswick Heads, is believed to have been an aborigines' religious mound, which was a centre of worship for aborigines from all parts of Australia before the coming of the white race.  Access to the mound is gained by a sloping pathway on one side. It appears to have been untouched for a great many years.  The president of the Archaeological Society of Australia (Mr. Frederick Slater) has deciphered many of the carvings on the sandstone, which must have been brought a considerable distance. There is none of it in the district. Another such mound is known to exist in North Australia. A Fraser Island aborigine when told of the discovery said that his tribe had been searching for the mound for years. Mr. Slater said that the attitude of silence of the aborigine after saying that was similar to that shown by other aborigines since they first came In contact with white men" (Daily Advertiser [Wagga Wagga], Wednesday 2 August 1939, page 4 http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/145374467 )&lt;ref&gt;[http://theedgeofreality.proboards.com/thread/3964/australias-stonehenge Steven Strong, Australia’s Stonehenge: the History of an Ancient Stone Arrangement, 16 September 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://forgottenorigin.com/5-australias-stonehenge-frederic-slaters-legacy Australia’s Stonehenge: Frederic Slater’s Legacy By Steven &amp; Evan Strong]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3672">'''Frédéric Charles Jean Gingins de la Sarraz''' (14 August 1790, [[Éclépens]] – 27 February 1863, [[Lausanne]]) was a Swiss [[historian]] and [[botanist]].

From 1817 to 1828 he worked as a translator of the French language in the State Chancellery at [[Bern]]. In 1844 he received an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Bern]] and in 1854 was awarded an honorary professorship at the [[University of Lausanne|Academy of Lausanne]].&lt;ref name=SH&gt;[http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/f/F31578.php  Dictionnaire historique de la Suisse] biography&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2058">'''Gabriel de Mussis''' (''ca.'' 1280 - ''ca.'' 1356) — also '''Gabriele de' Mussi''' — was a [[notary]] from [[Piacenza]], Italy, who gave a vivid account of the [[Black Death]] ([[bubonic plague]]) in the [[Black Sea]] city of [[Kaffa (city)|Kaffa]] ([[Feodosiya|Feodosia]]) and in [[Sicily]] known as ''Istoria de Morbo sive Mortalitate quae fuit Anno Dni MCCCXLVIII''  [“History of the Disease, OR The Great Dying of the Year of our Lord 1348”]&lt;ref&gt;Original MS in Codex 59, Library of the [[University of Wroclaw]], Poland.&lt;/ref&gt; De Mussis’ account then continues to record the terror in Piacenza. Although it was formerly believed that de Mussis had been present in Kaffa and travelled in a disease-laden ship to Piacenza, it has been determined that he probably never left home. De Mussis apparently recorded an early example of [[biological warfare]] in describing the hurling of plague-infected cadavers over the Kaffa city walls by the besieging [[Tatars|Tartar]]s in 1346. Modern authorities believe that his description of events is plausible and may indicate that plague was successfully introduced into Kaffa by the Tartars, but that the long-standing belief that the events at Kaffa contributed to the spread of plague beyond the city is not correct.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Wheelis|Wheelis, Mark]] (2002), [http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/8/9/01-0536_article.htm#r22 “Biological Warfare at the 1346 Siege of Caffa”], ''[[Emerging Infectious Diseases]]'', Vol. 8, No. 9 (September issue).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Geologic Clock with events and periods.svg|thumb|right|325px|Geologic time represented in a diagram called a geological clock, showing the relative lengths of the eons of Earth's history and noting major events]]
The '''geological history of Earth''' follows the major events in Earth's past based on the [[geological time scale]], a system of [[Chronological dating|chronological measurement]] based on the study of the planet's rock layers ([[stratigraphy]]). Earth formed [[Age of the Earth|about 4.54 billion years ago]] by accretion from the [[solar nebula]], a disk-shaped mass of dust and gas left over from the formation of the Sun, which also created the rest of the [[Solar System]].

Earth was initially molten due to extreme [[volcanism]] and frequent collisions with other bodies. Eventually, the outer layer of the planet cooled to form a solid [[crust (geology)|crust]] when water began accumulating in the atmosphere. The [[Moon]] formed soon afterwards, possibly as a result of the impact of a planetoid with the Earth. [[Outgassing]] and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere. Condensing [[water vapor]], augmented by ice delivered from [[comet]]s, [[Origin of water on Earth|produced the oceans]].

As the surface continually reshaped itself over hundreds of millions of years, continents formed and broke apart. They [[Plate tectonics|migrated across the surface]], occasionally combining to form a [[supercontinent]]. Roughly {{Ma|750}}, the earliest-known supercontinent [[Rodinia]], began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form [[Pannotia]], {{Ma|600|540}}, then finally [[Pangaea]], which broke apart {{Ma|200}}.

The present pattern of [[ice age]]s began about {{Ma|40}}, then intensified at the end of the [[Pliocene]]. The polar regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating every 40,000–100,000&amp;nbsp;years. The [[last glacial period]] of the [[Quaternary ice age|current ice age]] ended about 10,000&amp;nbsp;years ago.

== Precambrian ==
{{Life timeline}}
{{Main|Precambrian}}
The Precambrian includes approximately 90% of geologic time. It extends from 4.6 billion years ago to the beginning of the Cambrian Period (about 541 [[annum|Ma]]).  It includes three eons, the Hadean, Archean, and Proterozoic.

Major volcanic events altering the Earth's environment and causing extinctions may have occurred 10 times in the past 3 billion years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/earth-rsquo-s-lost-history-of-planet-altering-eruptions-revealed/?WT.mc_id=SA_FB_ENGYSUS_NEWS|title=Earth's Lost History of Planet-Altering Eruptions Revealed|last=Witze|first=Alexandra|work=Scientific American|access-date=2017-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hadean Eon ===
{{Main|Hadean}}
[[File:Protoplanetary-disk.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Artist's conception of a [[protoplanetary disc]]]]
During Hadean time (4.6&amp;ndash;4 [[annum|Ga]]), the [[Solar System]] was forming, probably within a large cloud of gas and dust around the sun, called an [[accretion disc]] from which [[History of Earth#Origin|Earth formed]] {{Ma|4500}}.&lt;ref name="age_earth"&gt;{{cite book | first=G.B. | last=Dalrymple | date=1991 | title=The Age of the Earth | publisher=Stanford University Press | location=California | isbn=0-8047-1569-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Hadean Eon is not formally recognized, but it essentially marks the era before we have adequate record of significant solid rocks. The oldest dated [[zircon]]s date from about {{Ma|4400}}.&lt;ref name="ICS2015"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/ICSchart/ChronostratChart2015-01.pdf | title=International Chronostratigraphic Chart v.2015/01 | publisher=[[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] | date=January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilde | first1 = S.

[[Earth]] was initially molten due to extreme [[volcanism]] and frequent collisions with other bodies. Eventually, the outer layer of the planet cooled to form a solid [[crust (geology)|crust]] when water began accumulating in the atmosphere. The [[Moon]] formed soon afterwards, possibly as a result of the [[giant impact hypothesis|impact]] of a large planetoid with the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Canup, R.

During the Hadean the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] occurred (approximately {{Ma|4100|3800}}) during which a large number of impact craters are believed to have formed on the Moon, and by inference on Earth, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]] and [[Mars]] as well.

=== Archean Eon ===
{{Main|Archean}}
The Earth of the early Archean ({{Ma|4000|2500}}) may have had a different tectonic style. During this time, the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]] cooled enough that rocks and continental plates began to form. Some scientists think because the Earth was hotter, that plate tectonic activity was more vigorous than it is today, resulting in a much greater rate of recycling of crustal material. This may have prevented cratonisation and continent formation until the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] cooled and convection slowed down. Others argue that the subcontinental lithospheric mantle is too buoyant to [[Subduction|subduct]] and that the lack of Archean rocks is a function of [[erosion]] and subsequent [[tectonic]] events.

In contrast to the [[Proterozoic]], Archean rocks are often heavily metamorphized deep-water sediments, such as [[graywacke]]s, [[mudstone]]s, volcanic sediments and [[banded iron formation]]s. [[Greenstone belt]]s are typical Archean formations, consisting of alternating high- and low-grade metamorphic rocks. The high-grade rocks were derived from volcanic [[island arc]]s, while the low-grade metamorphic rocks represent deep-sea sediments eroded from the neighboring island rocks and deposited in a [[forearc|forearc basin]]. In short, greenstone belts represent sutured protocontinents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|1999|pp=302&amp;ndash;303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Earth's [[magnetic field]] was established 3.5 billion years ago. The [[solar wind]] flux was about 100 times the value of the modern [[Sun]], so the presence of the magnetic field helped prevent the planet's atmosphere from being stripped away, which is what probably happened to the [[atmosphere of Mars]]. However, the field strength was lower than at present and the [[magnetosphere]] was about half the modern radius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Staff | title=Oldest measurement of Earth's magnetic field reveals battle between Sun and Earth for our atmosphere | date=March 4, 2010 | work=Physorg.news | url=http://www.physorg.com/news186922627.html | accessdate=2010-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proterozoic Eon ===
{{Main|Proterozoic}}
The geologic record of the Proterozoic ({{Ma|2500|541}}) is more complete than that for the preceding [[Archean]]. In contrast to the deep-water deposits of the Archean, the Proterozoic features many [[stratum|strata]] that were laid down in extensive shallow [[Epeiric Sea|epicontinental seas]]; furthermore, many of these rocks are less [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphosed]] than Archean-age ones, and plenty are unaltered.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|1999|p=315}}&lt;/ref&gt; Study of these rocks show that the eon featured massive, rapid [[continent]]al accretion (unique to the Proterozoic), [[supercontinent cycle]]s, and wholly modern [[orogeny|orogenic]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|1999|pp=315&amp;ndash;318, 329&amp;ndash;332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly {{Ma|750}},&lt;ref name="ICS2008"&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5nDdmUWXk?url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/upload/ISChart2008.pdf International Stratigraphic Chart 2008, International Commission on Stratigraphy]&lt;/ref&gt; the earliest-known supercontinent [[Rodinia]], began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form [[Pannotia]], 600–540&amp;nbsp;Ma.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Murphy, J. B. |author2=Nance, R. D. | title=How do supercontinents assemble? | journal=American Scientist | date=1965 | volume=92 | issue=4 | pages=324–333 | url=http://scienceweek.com/2004/sa040730-5.htm | accessdate=2007-03-05 | doi=10.1511/2004.4.324 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first-known glaciations occurred during the Proterozoic, one began shortly after the beginning of the eon, while there were at least four during the Neoproterozoic, climaxing with the [[Snowball Earth]] of the Varangian glaciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|1999|pp=320&amp;ndash;321, 325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phanerozoic Eon ==
{{Main|Phanerozoic}}
The '''Phanerozoic''' Eon is the current eon in the geologic timescale. It covers roughly 541&amp;nbsp;million years. During this period continents drifted about, eventually collected into a single landmass known as [[Pangea]] and then split up into the current continental landmasses.

The Phanerozoic is divided into three eras – the [[Paleozoic]], the [[Mesozoic]] and the [[Cenozoic]].

Most of biological evolution occurred during this time period.

=== Paleozoic Era ===
{{Main|Paleozoic}}
The '''Paleozoic''' spanned from roughly {{Ma|541|252}} (Ma)&lt;ref name="ICS2015"/&gt; and is subdivided into six [[period (geology)|geologic periods]]; from oldest to youngest they are the [[Cambrian]], [[Ordovician]], [[Silurian]], [[Devonian Period|Devonian]], [[Carboniferous]] and [[Permian]]. Geologically, the [[Paleozoic]] starts shortly after the breakup of a supercontinent called [[Pannotia]] and at the end of a global ice age. Throughout the early Paleozoic, the Earth's landmass was broken up into a substantial number of relatively small continents. Toward the end of the era the continents gathered together into a supercontinent called [[Pangaea]], which included most of the Earth's land area.

==== Cambrian Period ====
{{Main|Cambrian}}
The '''Cambrian''' is a major division of the [[geologic timescale]] that begins about 541.0 ± 1.0 Ma.&lt;ref name="ICS2015"/&gt; [[Cambrian]] continents are thought to have resulted from the breakup of a [[Neoproterozoic]] supercontinent called Pannotia. The waters of the Cambrian period appear to have been widespread and shallow. Continental drift rates may have been anomalously high. [[Laurentia]], [[Baltica]] and [[Siberia]] remained independent continents following the break-up of the supercontinent of Pannotia. [[Gondwana]] started to drift toward the South Pole. [[Panthalassa]] covered most of the southern hemisphere, and minor oceans included the [[Proto-Tethys Ocean]], [[Iapetus Ocean]] and [[Khanty Ocean]].

==== Ordovician period ====
{{Main|Ordovician}}
The '''Ordovician''' period started at a major extinction event called the [[Cambrian–Ordovician extinction event]] some time about 485.4 ± 1.9 Ma.&lt;ref name="ICS2015"/&gt;  During the [[Ordovician]] the southern continents were collected into a single continent called Gondwana. Gondwana started the period in the equatorial latitudes and, as the period progressed, drifted toward the South Pole. Early in the Ordovician the continents Laurentia, Siberia and Baltica were still independent continents (since the break-up of the supercontinent Pannotia earlier), but [[Baltica]] began to move toward Laurentia later in the period, causing the Iapetus Ocean to shrink between them. Also, [[Avalonia]] broke free from Gondwana and began to head north toward Laurentia. The [[Rheic Ocean]] was formed as a result of this. By the end of the period, Gondwana had neared or approached the pole and was largely glaciated.

The Ordovician came to a close in a series of [[extinction event]]s that, taken together, comprise the second-largest of the five major extinction events in [[History of Earth|Earth's history]] in terms of percentage of [[genus|genera]] that became extinct. The only larger one was the Permian-Triassic extinction event. The extinctions occurred approximately {{Ma|447|444}} &lt;ref name="ICS2015"/&gt; and mark the boundary between the Ordovician and the following [[Silurian]] Period.

The most-commonly accepted theory is that these events were triggered by the onset of an [[ice age]], in the Hirnantian faunal stage that ended the long, stable [[greenhouse]] conditions typical of the Ordovician. The ice age was probably not as long-lasting as once thought; study of oxygen [[isotope]]s in fossil brachiopods shows that it was probably no longer than 0.5 to 1.5 million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|1999|p=358}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The event was preceded by a fall in atmospheric carbon dioxide (from 7000ppm to 4400ppm) which selectively affected the shallow seas where most organisms lived. As the southern supercontinent [[Gondwana]] drifted over the South Pole, ice caps formed on it. Evidence of these ice caps have been detected in Upper Ordovician rock strata of North Africa and then-adjacent northeastern South America, which were south-polar locations at the time.

==== Silurian Period ====
{{Main|Silurian}}
The '''Silurian''' is a major division of the [[geologic timescale]] that started about 443.8 ± 1.5 Ma.&lt;ref name="ICS2015"/&gt; During the [[Silurian]], Gondwana continued a slow southward drift to high southern latitudes, but there is evidence that the Silurian ice caps were less extensive than those of the late Ordovician glaciation. The melting of ice caps and glaciers contributed to a rise in [[sea level]]s, recognizable from the fact that Silurian sediments overlie eroded Ordovician sediments, forming an [[unconformity]]. Other [[craton]]s and continent fragments drifted together near the equator, starting the formation of a second supercontinent known as [[Euramerica]]. The vast ocean of Panthalassa covered most of the northern hemisphere. Other minor oceans include Proto-Tethys, Paleo-Tethys, Rheic Ocean, a seaway of Iapetus Ocean (now in between Avalonia and Laurentia), and newly formed [[Ural Ocean]].

==== Devonian Period ====
{{Main|Devonian}}
The '''Devonian''' spanned roughly from 419 to 359 Ma.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt;  The period was a time of great tectonic activity, as [[Laurasia]] and Gondwana drew closer together. The continent Euramerica (or Laurussia) was created in the early Devonian by the collision of Laurentia and Baltica, which rotated into the natural dry zone along the [[Tropic of Capricorn]]. In these near-deserts, the [[Old Red Sandstone]] sedimentary beds formed, made red by the oxidized iron ([[hematite]]) characteristic of drought conditions. Near the equator Pangaea began to consolidate from the plates containing North America and Europe, further raising the northern [[Appalachian Mountains]] and forming the [[Caledonian Mountains]] in [[Great Britain]] and [[Scandinavia]]. The southern continents remained tied together in the supercontinent of [[Gondwana]]. The remainder of modern Eurasia lay in the Northern Hemisphere. Sea levels were high worldwide, and much of the land lay submerged under shallow seas. The deep, enormous Panthalassa (the "universal ocean") covered the rest of the planet. Other minor oceans were Paleo-Tethys, Proto-Tethys, Rheic Ocean and Ural Ocean (which was closed during the collision with Siberia and Baltica).

==== Carboniferous Period ====
{{Main|Carboniferous}}
The '''Carboniferous''' extends from about 358.9 ± 0.4 to about 298.9 ± 0.15 Ma.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt;

A global drop in sea level at the end of the Devonian reversed early in the [[Carboniferous]]; this created the widespread epicontinental seas and carbonate deposition of the [[Mississippian age|Mississippian]]. There was also a drop in south polar temperatures; southern Gondwana was glaciated throughout the period, though it is uncertain if the ice sheets were a holdover from the Devonian or not. These conditions apparently had little effect in the deep tropics, where lush [[coal]] swamps flourished within 30 degrees of the northernmost glaciers. A mid-Carboniferous drop in sea-level precipitated a major marine extinction, one that hit [[crinoid]]s and [[ammonite]]s especially hard. This sea-level drop and the associated unconformity in North America separate the [[Mississippian Period]] from the [[Pennsylvanian period]].&lt;ref name="Stanley, 414"&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|1999|p=414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Carboniferous was a time of active mountain building, as the supercontinent Pangea came together. The southern continents remained tied together in the supercontinent Gondwana, which collided with North America-Europe ([[Laurussia]]) along the present line of eastern [[North America]]. This continental collision resulted in the [[Hercynian orogeny]] in Europe, and the [[Alleghenian orogeny]] in North America; it also extended the newly uplifted Appalachians southwestward as the [[Ouachita Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|1999|pp=414&amp;ndash;416}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same time frame, much of present eastern [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] plate welded itself to Europe along the line of the [[Ural mountains]]. There were two major oceans in the Carboniferous the Panthalassa and Paleo-Tethys. Other minor oceans were shrinking and eventually closed the [[Rheic Ocean]] (closed by the assembly of South and North America), the small, shallow [[Ural Ocean]] (which was closed by the collision of [[Baltica]], and [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]] continents, creating the Ural Mountains) and Proto-Tethys Ocean.

==== Permian Period ====
{{Main|Permian}}
The '''Permian''' extends from about 298.9 ± 0.15 to 252.17 ± 0.06 Ma.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt;

During the [[Permian]] all the Earth's major land masses, except portions of East Asia, were collected into a single supercontinent known as [[Pangaea]]. Pangaea straddled the equator and extended toward the poles, with a corresponding effect on ocean currents in the single great ocean (''[[Panthalassa]]'', the ''universal sea''), and the [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean]], a large ocean that was between Asia and Gondwana. The Cimmeria continent rifted away from Gondwana and drifted north to Laurasia, causing the Paleo-Tethys to shrink. A new ocean was growing on its southern end, the Tethys Ocean, an ocean that would dominate much of the Mesozoic Era. Large continental landmasses create climates with extreme variations of heat and cold ("continental climate") and monsoon conditions with highly seasonal rainfall patterns. [[Desert]]s seem to have been widespread on Pangaea.

=== Mesozoic Era ===
{{Main|Mesozoic}}
[[File:249 global.png|thumb|Plate tectonics- {{Ma|249}}]]
[[File:290 global.png|thumb|Plate tectonics- {{Ma|290}}]]
The '''Mesozoic''' extended roughly from {{Ma|252|Cenozoic}}.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt;

After the vigorous convergent plate mountain-building of the late [[Paleozoic]], [[Mesozoic]] tectonic deformation was comparatively mild. Nevertheless, the era featured the dramatic rifting of the supercontinent [[Pangaea]]. Pangaea gradually split into a northern continent, [[Laurasia]], and a southern continent, [[Gondwana]]. This created the [[passive continental margin]] that characterizes most of the [[Atlantic]] coastline (such as along the U.S. East Coast) today.

==== Triassic Period ====
{{Main|Triassic}}
The '''Triassic''' Period extends from about 252.17 ± 0.06 to 201.3 ± 0.2 Ma.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt;  During the [[Triassic]], almost all the Earth's land mass was concentrated into a single [[supercontinent]] centered more or less on the equator, called [[Pangaea]] ("all the land"). This took the form of a giant "[[Pac-Man]]" with an east-facing "mouth"  constituting the [[Tethys Ocean|Tethys sea]], a vast gulf that opened farther westward in the mid-Triassic, at the expense of the shrinking [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean]], an ocean that existed during the [[Paleozoic]].

The remainder was the world-ocean known as [[Panthalassa]] ("all the sea"). All the deep-ocean sediments laid down during the Triassic have disappeared through [[subduction]] of oceanic plates; thus, very little is known of the Triassic open ocean. The supercontinent Pangaea was rifting during the Triassic&amp;mdash;especially late in the period&amp;mdash;but had not yet separated. The first nonmarine sediments in the [[rift]] that marks the initial break-up of Pangea&amp;mdash;which separated [[New Jersey]] from [[Morocco]]&amp;mdash;are of Late Triassic age; in the U.S., these thick sediments comprise the [[Newark Supergroup]].&lt;ref name=lasdtri&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because of the limited shoreline of one super-continental mass, Triassic marine deposits are globally relatively rare; despite their prominence in [[Western Europe]], where the Triassic was first studied. In [[North America]], for example, marine deposits are limited to a few exposures in the west. Thus Triassic [[stratigraphy]] is mostly based on organisms living in lagoons and hypersaline environments, such as ''Estheria'' crustaceans and terrestrial vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sereno P.

==== Jurassic Period ====
{{Main|Jurassic}}
The '''Jurassic''' Period extends from about 201.3 ± 0.2 to 145.0 Ma.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt;
During the early [[Jurassic]], the supercontinent [[Pangaea]] broke up into the northern supercontinent [[Laurasia]] and the southern supercontinent [[Gondwana]]; the [[Gulf of Mexico]] opened in the new rift between North America and what is now [[Mexico]]'s [[Yucatan Peninsula]]. The Jurassic North [[Atlantic Ocean]] was relatively narrow, while the South Atlantic did not open until the following Cretaceous Period, when Gondwana itself rifted apart.&lt;ref name=panjur2&gt;{{cite web

| publisher = C. R. Scotese
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Tethys Ocean|Tethys Sea]] closed, and the [[Mediterranean Basin|Neotethys]] basin appeared. Climates were warm, with no evidence of [[glacier|glaciation]]. As in the Triassic, there was apparently no land near either pole, and no extensive ice caps existed. The Jurassic geological record is good in western [[Europe]], where extensive marine sequences indicate a time when much of the continent was submerged under shallow tropical seas; famous locales include the [[Jurassic Coast]] [[World Heritage Site]] and the renowned late Jurassic ''[[lagerstätte]]n'' of [[Holzmaden]] and [[Solnhofen limestone|Solnhofen]].&lt;ref name=lasdjur&gt;{{cite web

In contrast, the North American Jurassic record is the poorest of the Mesozoic, with few outcrops at the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalatlas.gov/articles/geology/legend/ages/jurassic.html |title=Jurassic Rocks – 208 to 146 million years ago |accessdate=2007-07-19 |work=nationalatlas.gov |publisher=United States Department of the Interior |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140930212425/http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/geology/legend/ages/jurassic.html |archivedate=2014-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the [[Epeiric Sea|epicontinental]] [[Sundance Sea]] left marine deposits in parts of the northern plains of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] during the late Jurassic, most exposed sediments from this period are continental, such as the [[alluvium|alluvial]] deposits of the [[Morrison Formation]]. The first of several massive [[batholith]]s were emplaced in the northern [[American cordillera|Cordillera]] beginning in the mid-Jurassic, marking the [[Nevadan orogeny]].&lt;ref&gt;Monroe and Wicander, 607.&lt;/ref&gt; Important Jurassic exposures are also found in Russia, India, South America, Japan, [[Australasia]] and the United Kingdom.

==== Cretaceous Period ====
{{Main|Cretaceous}}
[[File:100 global.png|thumb|Plate tectonics- 100 Ma,&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt; [[Cretaceous]] period]]
The '''Cretaceous''' Period extends from circa {{Ma|145.0}} to {{Ma|Paleogene}}.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt;

During the [[Cretaceous]], the late [[Paleozoic]]-early Mesozoic [[supercontinent]] of [[Pangaea]] completed its breakup into present day [[continent]]s, although their positions were substantially different at the time. As the [[Atlantic Ocean]] widened, the convergent-margin [[orogeny|orogenies]] that had begun during the Jurassic continued in the [[American cordillera|North American Cordillera]], as the [[Nevadan orogeny]] was followed by the [[Sevier orogeny|Sevier]] and [[Laramide orogeny|Laramide orogenies]]. Though Gondwana was still intact in the beginning of the Cretaceous, [[Gondwana]] itself broke up as [[South America]], [[Antarctica]] and [[Australia]] rifted away from [[Africa]] (though [[India]] and [[Madagascar]] remained attached to each other); thus, the South Atlantic and [[Indian Ocean]]s were newly formed. Such active rifting lifted great undersea mountain chains along the welts, raising [[sea level|eustatic sea levels]] worldwide.

To the north of Africa the [[Tethys Sea]] continued to narrow. Broad shallow seas advanced across central [[North America]] (the [[Western Interior Seaway]]) and Europe, then receded late in the period, leaving thick marine deposits sandwiched between [[coal]] beds. At the peak of the Cretaceous [[transgression (geology)|transgression]], one-third of Earth's present land area was submerged.&lt;ref&gt;Dougal Dixon et al., ''Atlas of Life on Earth'', (New York: Barnes &amp; Noble Books, 2001), p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cretaceous is justly famous for its [[chalk]]; indeed, more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the [[Phanerozoic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|1999|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mid-ocean ridge]] activity—or rather, the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges—enriched the oceans in calcium; this made the oceans more saturated, as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for [[Coccolithophores|calcareous nanoplankton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|1999|pp=279&amp;ndash;281}}&lt;/ref&gt; These widespread [[carbonate]]s and other [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary deposits]] make the Cretaceous rock record especially fine. Famous [[Geologic formation|formations]] from North America include the rich marine fossils of [[Kansas]]'s [[Smoky Hill Chalk|Smoky Hill Chalk Member]] and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous [[Hell Creek Formation]]. Other important Cretaceous exposures occur in [[Europe]] and [[China]]. In the area that is now India, massive [[lava]] beds called the [[Deccan Traps]] were laid down in the very late Cretaceous and early Paleocene.

=== Cenozoic Era ===
{{Main|Cenozoic}}
The '''Cenozoic''' Era covers the {{period start|Cenozoic}}&amp;nbsp;million years since the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] up to and including the present day. By the end of the [[Mesozoic]] era, the continents had rifted into nearly their present form. [[Laurasia]] became [[North America]] and [[Eurasia]], while [[Gondwana]] split into [[South America]], [[Africa]], [[Australia]], [[Antarctica]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]], which collided with the Asian plate. This impact gave rise to the Himalayas. The Tethys Sea, which had separated the northern continents from Africa and India, began to close up, forming the [[Mediterranean sea]].

==== Paleogene Period ====
{{Main|Paleogene}}
The '''Paleogene''' (alternatively '''Palaeogene''') [[geologic period|Period]] is a unit of [[geologic time]] that began {{period start|Paleogene}} and ended 23.03 Ma&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt; and comprises the first part of the [[Cenozoic]] Era. This period consists of the [[Paleocene]], [[Eocene]] and [[Oligocene]] Epochs.

===== Paleocene Epoch =====
{{Main|Paleocene}}
The '''Paleocene''', lasted from {{Ma|Paleocene}} to {{Ma|56.0}}.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt;

In many ways, the [[Paleocene]] continued processes that had begun during the late Cretaceous Period. During the Paleocene, the [[continent]]s continued to drift toward their present positions. Supercontinent [[Laurasia]] had not yet separated into three continents. [[Europe]] and [[Greenland]] were still connected. [[North America]] and [[Asia]] were still intermittently joined by a land bridge, while Greenland and North America were beginning to separate.&lt;ref name="Hooker"&gt;Hooker, J.J., "Tertiary to Present: Paleocene", pp. 459-465, Vol. 5. of Selley, Richard C., L. Robin McCocks, and Ian R. Plimer, Encyclopedia of Geology, Oxford: Elsevier Limited, 2005. {{ISBN|0-12-636380-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Laramide orogeny]] of the late Cretaceous continued to uplift the [[Rocky Mountains]] in the American west, which ended in the succeeding epoch. South and North America remained separated by equatorial seas (they joined during the [[Neogene]]); the components of the former southern supercontinent [[Gondwana]] continued to split apart, with [[Africa]], South America, [[Antarctica]] and [[Australia]] pulling away from each other. Africa was heading north toward [[Europe]], slowly closing the [[Tethys Ocean]], and [[India]] began its migration to Asia that would lead to a tectonic collision and the formation of the [[Himalayas]].

===== Eocene Epoch =====
{{Main|Eocene}}
During the '''[[Eocene]]''' ({{Ma|56.0}} - {{Ma|33.9}}),&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt; the continents continued to drift toward their present positions. At the beginning of the period, Australia and Antarctica remained connected, and warm [[equator]]ial currents mixed with colder Antarctic waters, distributing the heat around the world and keeping global temperatures high. But when Australia split from the southern continent around 45 [[annum|Ma]], the warm equatorial currents were deflected away from Antarctica, and an isolated cold water channel developed between the two continents. The Antarctic region cooled down, and the ocean surrounding Antarctica began to freeze, sending cold water and ice floes north, reinforcing the cooling. The present pattern of [[ice age]]s began about {{Ma|40}}.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The northern [[supercontinent]] of [[Laurasia]] began to break up, as [[Europe]], [[Greenland]] and [[North America]] drifted apart. In western North America, [[Orogeny|mountain building]] started in the Eocene, and huge lakes formed in the high flat basins among uplifts. In Europe, the [[Tethys Sea]] finally vanished, while the uplift of the [[Alps]] isolated its final remnant, the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], and created another shallow sea with island [[archipelago]]s to the north. Though the North [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] was opening, a land connection appears to have remained between North America and Europe since the faunas of the two regions are very similar. [[India]] continued its journey away from [[Africa]] and began its collision with [[Asia]], creating the [[Himalaya]]n orogeny.

===== Oligocene Epoch =====
{{Main|Oligocene}}
The '''Oligocene''' Epoch extends from about {{Ma|34}} to {{Ma|23}}.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt; During the [[Oligocene]] the continents continued to drift toward their present positions.

[[Antarctica]] continued to become more isolated and finally developed a permanent [[ice cap]]. [[Orogeny|Mountain building]] in western [[North America]] continued, and the [[Alps]] started to rise in [[Europe]] as the [[African Plate|African plate]] continued to push north into the [[Eurasian plate]], isolating the remnants of [[Tethys Sea]]. A brief marine incursion marks the early Oligocene in Europe. There appears to have been a land bridge in the early Oligocene between [[North America]] and [[Europe]] since the [[Fauna (animals)|faunas]] of the two regions are very similar. During the Oligocene, [[South America]] was finally detached from [[Antarctica]] and drifted north toward [[North America]]. It also allowed the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] to flow, rapidly cooling the continent.

==== Neogene Period ====
{{Main|Neogene}}
The '''Neogene''' Period is a unit of [[geologic timescale|geologic time]] starting 23.03 Ma.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt; and ends at 2.588 Ma.  The Neogene Period follows the [[Paleogene]] Period. The Neogene consists of the [[Miocene]] and [[Pliocene]] and is followed by the [[Quaternary]] Period.

===== Miocene Epoch =====
{{Main|Miocene}}
The '''Miocene''' extends from about 23.03 to 5.333 Ma.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt;

During the [[Miocene]] continents continued to drift toward their present positions. Of the modern geologic features, only the land bridge between [[South America]] and [[North America]] was absent, the subduction zone along the [[Pacific Ocean]] margin of South America caused the rise of the [[Andes]] and the southward extension of the [[Meso-American]] peninsula. [[India]] continued to collide with [[Asia]]. The Tethys Seaway continued to shrink and then disappeared as [[Africa]] collided with [[Eurasia]] in the [[Turkey|Turkish]]-[[Arabia]]n region between 19 and 12 [[annum|Ma]] ([[International Commission on Stratigraphy|ICS]] 2004). Subsequent uplift of mountains in the western [[Mediterranean]] region and a global fall in sea levels combined to cause a temporary drying up of the Mediterranean Sea resulting in the [[Messinian salinity crisis]] near the end of the Miocene.

===== Pliocene Epoch =====
{{Main|Pliocene}}
The '''Pliocene''' extends from {{Ma|5.333}} to {{Ma|2.588}}.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt;  During the [[Pliocene]] continents continued to drift toward their present positions, moving from positions possibly as far as {{convert|250|km|mi|0}} from their present locations to positions only 70&amp;nbsp;km from their current locations.

South America became linked to North America through the [[Isthmus of Panama]] during the Pliocene, bringing a nearly complete end to South America's distinctive [[Marsupialia|marsupial]] faunas. The formation of the Isthmus had major consequences on global temperatures, since warm equatorial ocean currents were cut off and an Atlantic cooling cycle began, with cold Arctic and Antarctic waters dropping temperatures in the now-isolated Atlantic Ocean. [[Africa]]'s collision with [[Europe]] formed the [[Mediterranean Sea]], cutting off the remnants of the [[Tethys Ocean]]. Sea level changes exposed the land-bridge between [[Alaska]] and Asia. Near the end of the Pliocene, about {{Ma|2.58}} (the start of the Quaternary Period), the [[Quaternary glaciation|current ice age]] began. The polar regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating every 40,000–100,000&amp;nbsp;years.

==== Quaternary Period ====
{{Main|Quaternary}}

===== Pleistocene Epoch =====
{{Main|Pleistocene}}
The '''Pleistocene''' extends from {{Ma|2.588}} to 11,700 years before present.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt;  The modern [[continent]]s were essentially at their present positions during the [[Pleistocene]], the [[tectonic plate|plates]] upon which they sit probably having moved no more than {{convert|100|km|mi|0}} relative to each other since the beginning of the period.

===== Holocene Epoch =====
{{Main|Holocene}}
[[File:Earth dry elevation.stl|thumb|right|Current Earth - without water (click/enlarge to "spin" 3D-globe).]]
The '''Holocene''' Epoch began approximately 11,700 calendar years before present&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt; and continues to the present. During the [[Holocene]], continental motions have been less than a kilometer.

The [[last glacial period]] of the [[Quaternary ice age|current ice age]] ended about 10,000&amp;nbsp;years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Staff | url = http://www.lakepowell.net/sciencecenter/paleoclimate.htm | title = Paleoclimatology - The Study of Ancient Climates | publisher = Page Paleontology Science Center | accessdate = 2007-03-02 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/617EaUwHQ?url=http://www.lakepowell.net/sciencecenter/paleoclimate.htm | archivedate = 2011-08-22 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ice melt caused world [[Sea level rise|sea levels to rise]] about {{convert|35|m|ft|0}} in the early part of the Holocene. In addition, many areas above about [[40th parallel north|40 degrees north]] latitude had been depressed by the weight of the Pleistocene [[glacier]]s and rose as much as {{convert|180|m|ft|0}} over the late Pleistocene and Holocene, and are still rising today. The sea level rise and temporary land depression allowed temporary marine incursions into areas that are now far from the sea. Holocene marine fossils are known from [[Vermont]], [[Quebec]], [[Ontario]] and [[Michigan]]. Other than higher latitude temporary marine incursions associated with glacial depression, Holocene fossils are found primarily in lakebed, floodplain and cave deposits. Holocene marine deposits along low-latitude coastlines are rare because the rise in sea levels during the period exceeds any likely upthrusting of non-glacial origin. [[Post-glacial rebound]] in [[Scandinavia]] resulted in the emergence of coastal areas around the [[Baltic Sea]], including much of [[Finland]]. The region continues to rise, still causing weak [[earthquake]]s across [[Northern Europe]]. The equivalent event in North America was the rebound of [[Hudson Bay]], as it shrank from its larger, immediate post-glacial [[Tyrrell Sea]] phase, to near its present boundaries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48192">The '''intentional stance''' is a term coined by [[philosopher]] [[Daniel Dennett]] for the level of [[abstraction]] in which we view the behavior of an entity in terms of [[mental properties]]. It is part of a theory of [[mental content]] proposed by Dennett, which provides the underpinnings of his later works on [[free will]], [[consciousness]], [[folk psychology]], and [[evolution]].

{{Quote|text=Here is how it works: first you decide to treat the object whose behavior is to be predicted as a rational agent; then you figure out what beliefs that agent ought to have, given its place in the world and its purpose. Then you figure out what desires it ought to have, on the same considerations, and finally you predict that this rational agent will act to further its goals in the light of its beliefs. A little practical reasoning from the chosen set of beliefs and desires will in most instances yield a decision about what the agent ought to do; that is what you predict the agent will do.|sign=Daniel Dennett|source=''The Intentional Stance'', p. 17}}

== Dennett and intentionality ==
Dennett (1971, p.&amp;nbsp;87) states that he took the concept of "[[intentionality]]" from the work of the German philosopher [[Franz Brentano]].&lt;ref&gt;In his second edition (1973/1924, pp. 180–81), Brentano added this explanation of "intentional" to his 1911 edition: "This expression had been misunderstood in that some people thought it had to do with intention and the pursuit of a goal. In view of this, I might have done better to avoid it altogether. Instead of the term 'intentional' the Scholastics very frequently used the expression 'objective'. This has to do with the fact that something is an object for the mentally active subject, and, as such, is present in some manner in his consciousness, whether it is merely thought of or also desired, shunned, etc. I preferred the expression 'intentional' because I thought there would be an even greater danger of being misunderstood if I had described the object of thought as 'objectively existing', for modern day thinkers use this expression to refer to what really exists as opposed to 'mere subjective appearances'."&lt;/ref&gt; When clarifying the distinction between mental phenomena (viz., mental activity) and physical phenomena, Brentano (p.&amp;nbsp;97) argued that, in contrast with physical phenomena,&lt;ref&gt;In addition to cogitations (such as judgement, recollection and inference) and emotions (such as joy and sorrow and fear), Brentano (op.cit. p. 79) includes things such as "hearing a sound, seeing a colored object, feeling warm or cold" in his category of physical phenomena.&lt;/ref&gt; the "distinguishing characteristic of all mental phenomena"&lt;ref&gt;By contrast, Brentano (p. 80) includes things such as "a color... a chord which I hear, warmth, cold, odor which I sense" in his category of mental phenomena.&lt;/ref&gt; was "the reference to something as an object" – a characteristic he called "''intentional inexistence''".&lt;ref&gt;Note that, whilst the term "inexistence" appears haphazardly right throughout the text of Bretano's work as both '''''in-existence''''' and ''''''inexistence''''', it very clearly always carries the "inherence" meaning (i.e., the fact or condition of existing in something), rather than the "non-existence" meaning (i.e., the fact or condition of not existing).&lt;/ref&gt; Dennett constantly speaks of the "''[[aboutness]]''" of ''intentionality''; for example: "the aboutness of the pencil marks composing a shopping list is derived from the intentions of the person whose list it is" (Dennett, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;240).

[[John Searle]] (1999, pp.&amp;nbsp;85) stresses that "competence" in predicting/explaining human behaviour involves being able to both recognize others as "''intentional''" beings, and interpret others' minds as having "intentional states" (e.g., beliefs and desires):
:"The primary evolutionary role of the mind is to relate us in certain ways to the environment, and especially to other people. My subjective states relate me to the rest of the world, and the general name of that relationship is "intentionality." These subjective states include beliefs and desires, intentions and perceptions, as well as loves and hates, fears and hopes. "Intentionality," to repeat, is the general term for all the various forms by which the mind can be directed at, or be about, or of, objects and states of affairs in the world." (p.85)&lt;ref&gt;Searle (1999, pp. 85–86) clarifies his usage: "'''''Intentionality''''' is an unfortunate word, and like a lot of unfortunate words in philosophy, we owe it to the German-speaking philosophers. The word suggests that intentionality, in the sense of directedness, must always have some connection with 'intending' in the sense in which, for example, I intend to go to the movies tonight. (German has no problem with this because '''''Intentionalität'''''' does not sound like '''''Absicht'''''', the word for intention in the ordinary sense of intending to go to the movies.) So we have to keep in mind that in English intending is just one form of intentionality among many.&lt;br/&gt; Foss and Bow (1986, p. 94) present a far more [[Artificial intelligence|A.I.-oriented]] view:&lt;br/&gt;"We assume that people understand the actions of others by viewing those actions as purposive, as goal directed. People use their knowledge of human intentionality, of the types of goals people have and of the types of plans they devise in service of those goals, to understand action sequences that are described in narratives or observed directly. Many recent approaches to comprehension emphasize the role of goal planning knowledge when understanding narratives and conversations, and when remembering observed sequences and goal directed actions. According to these approaches, understanding involves inferring the intentions (i.e. the plans and goals) of the characters, speakers, or actors. Such inferences are ubiquitous because narratives frequently provide only sketchy descriptions of the character's actions and goals; speakers rarely state their intentions directly; and observers rarely see all the events preceding or following the action to be explained. Therefore, people are forced to use their general knowledge of human intentionality to fill in the missing information; they do this by generating expectations and drawing inferences in order to come up with a plan that explains an actor's behavior. Although the importance of this type of knowledge for understanding natural discourse and action sequences has been recognized, only recently have cognitive scientists begun examining the psychological processes involved in drawing inferences about human intentionality..."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dennett (1987, pp.&amp;nbsp;48–49), [[folk psychology]] provides a systematic, "reason-giving explanation" for a particular action, and an account of the historical origins of that action, based on deeply embedded assumptions  about the agent;&lt;ref&gt;Because we use folk psychology effortlessly all the time to ''systematically predict'' actions, and because this way of thinking about things seems to be so very effective – Fodor (1987, p. 3) speaks of its "extraordinary predictive power" – Dennett is certain that the practice of treating others as rational agents must have evolved and developed over time: "we treat each other as if we were rational agents, and this myth – for surely we are not all that rational – works very well because we are pretty rational" (p. 50). Siegert (2001, p. 183), agrees: "Evolutionary psychology argues that the ability to form a representation of what another human is thinking is an ability that has been acquired and developed through natural selection. The ability to interpret other people's facial expressions, their body language, and their tone of voice, has obvious advantages for survival. In earlier environments, our ancestors had to be able determine who was a friend and who was an enemy, who was a potential mate and who was not. The ability to distinguish between facial expressions associated with suspicion and curiosity, fear and anger, or disgust and sadness, may have been the difference between life and death. In modern society we also rely on this ability for surviving socially, if not literally. Our ability to accurately express our emotions, to know how and when to express them, to know when to conceal our emotions, and to be able read and interpret the emotions of other people are skills that impact hugely on our ability to form lasting relationships, breed and raise healthy children, and gain high status in our careers" (p. 183).&lt;/ref&gt; namely that:
:(a) the agent's action was entirely rational;&lt;ref&gt;Dennett stresses how research into artificial intelligence has shown just how rational humans actually are: "Even the most sophisticated AI programs stumble blindly into misinterpretations and misunderstandings that even small children reliably evade without a second thought" (1987, p. 52).&lt;/ref&gt;
:(b) the agent's action was entirely reasonable (in the prevailing circumstances);
:(c) the agent held certain ''beliefs'';&lt;ref&gt;Note that it is irrelevant whether the agent actually holds these particular beliefs or not; the critical feature is that the observer ascribes them to the agent. The intentional stance involves an observer amassing a constellation of subjective, observer-centred assumptions, unique to that specific observer, that are expressed in the form of a set of supposed beliefs and desires which are attributed to (and projected upon) the object of that observation ''in order to explain something to the observer''. The observer is not trying to objectively determine the agent's actual state of mind. His only need is to be able to represent the agent's behaviour to himself in such a way that he can respond to the agent's behaviour. Consequently, these attributions rarely describe any actual belief or desire an agent might maintain at any time; and the objective truth of the observer's subjective assumptions about the agent's "inner life" is entirely irrelevant – always provided, of course, that his response to the agent's behaviour has been appropriate.&lt;/ref&gt;
:(d) the agent ''desired'' certain things; and
:(e) the agent's future action could be systematically predicted from the ''beliefs'' and ''desires'' so ascribed.

This approach is also consistent with the earlier work of [[Fritz Heider]] and [[Marianne Simmel]], whose joint study revealed that, when subjects were presented with an animated display of 2-dimensional shapes, they were inclined to ascribe intentions to the shapes.&lt;ref&gt;See Heider &amp; Simmel (1944); the animation used in the experiment is at "youtube.com/watch?v=n9TWwG4SFWQ".&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, Dennett (1987, p.&amp;nbsp;52) argues that, based on our fixed personal views of what all humans ought to believe, desire and do, we predict (or explain) the beliefs, desires and actions of others "by calculating in a normative system";&lt;ref&gt;In other words, humans have a propensity to systematically think as follows: '''X''' has performed action '''A''' because they believe '''B''', and desires '''D''', and (on the basis of their desire for '''D''', and their belief that '''B''' is how things obtain in the real world) '''X''' has chosen to '''A''', with the intention of achieving goal '''G''' (which, as they understand things, will produce outcome '''D'''). This deep desire to eschew disorder and make things systematic has a parallel in the way that humans assess the concept of "randomness". In many circumstances, according to Falk and Konold (1997; 1998), an individual's concept of what is "random" is, in fact, far from it – and this "''subjective randomness''" is, often, far more disordered than a truly random sequence. Lisanby and Lockhead (1991), also differentiate between subjective randomness and genuine randomness (upon which they which they bestow the tautologous title of "''stochastic randomness''").

:"That subjective randomness results from people's failure to make sense of their observations is not a new idea. Piaget and Inhelder [viz., 1951/1975] attribute the origin of the idea of chance in children to their realizing the impossibility of predicting oncoming events or finding causal explanations. The experience of randomness is thus construed as an admission of failure of our intellectual operations" (Falk and Konold, 1988, p. 658).&lt;/ref&gt; and, driven by the reasonable assumption that all humans are rational beings – who do ''have'' specific beliefs and desires and do ''act'' on the basis of those beliefs and desires in order to get what they want – these predictions/explanations are based on four simple rules:

# The agent's ''beliefs'' are those a rational individual ought to have (i.e., given their "perceptual capacities", "epistemic needs" and "biography");&lt;ref&gt;Swinburne (2001, pp. 39–40) argues that one of the most important features of beliefs is that they are involuntary: "Belief is a passive state; believing is a state in which you are, it is not a matter of you doing something. And it is an involuntary state, a state in which you find yourself and which you cannot change at will at an instant. I believe that today is Tuesday, that I am now in Oxford, that Aquinas died in AD 1274, and so on and so on. I cannot sudden-ly decide to believe that today is Monday, that I am now in Italy, or that Aquinas lived in the eighteenth century. That belief is involuntary was a claim of Locke, Leibniz, and Hume. "Belief consists", wrote Hume, "merely in a certain feeling or sentiment; in something that depends not on the will, but must arise from certain determinate causes and principles of which we are not masters."&lt;/ref&gt;
# In general, these beliefs "are both true and relevant to [their] life;&lt;ref&gt;In addressing cases where an agent's beliefs are not "both true and relevant to [their] life", Dennett (1987, p. 49) notes that "when false beliefs are attributed, special stories must be told to explain how the error resulted from the presence of features in the environment that are deceptive relative to the perceptual capacities of the system."&lt;/ref&gt;
# The agent's ''desires'' are those a rational individual ought to have (i.e., given their "biological needs", and "the most practicable means of satisfying them") in order to further their "survival" and "procreation" needs;&lt;ref&gt;Dennett also addresses the cases in which the desires are "abnormal" and remarks that "[these] 'abnormal' desires are attributable if special stories can be told" (1987, p. 49).&lt;/ref&gt; and 
# The agent's behaviour will be composed of those acts a rational individual holding those ''beliefs'' (and having those ''desires'') ought to perform.

==Dennett's three levels==
The core idea is that, when understanding, explaining, and/or predicting the behavior of an object, we can choose to view it at varying levels of abstraction. The more concrete the level, the more accurate ''in principle'' our predictions are; the more abstract, the greater the computational power we gain by zooming out and skipping over the irrelevant details.

Dennett defines three levels of abstraction, attained by adopting one of three entirely different "stances", or intellectual strategies: the physical stance; the design stance; and the intentional stance:&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, D. C., (1987) "Three Kinds of Intentional Psychology", pp. 43–68 in Dennett, D. C., ''The Intentional Stance'', The MIT Press, (Cambridge), 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The most concrete is the ''physical stance'', the domain of physics and chemistry, which makes predictions from knowledge of the physical constitution of the system and the physical laws that govern its operation; and thus, given a particular set of physical laws and initial conditions, and a particular configuration, a specific future state is predicted (this could also be called the "''structure stance''").&lt;ref&gt;Perkins (1983, p. 360), refers to the results of this "'''''machine style'''''" of perception as a "'''''physicist's system'''''".&lt;/ref&gt; At this level, we are concerned with such things as mass, energy, velocity, and chemical composition. When we predict where a ball is going to land based on its current trajectory, we are taking the physical stance. Another example of this stance comes when we look at a strip made up of two types of metal bonded together and predict how it will bend as the temperature changes, based on the physical properties of the two metals.
* Somewhat more abstract is the ''design stance'', the domain of biology and engineering, which requires no knowledge of the physical constitution or the physical laws that govern a system's operation. Based on an implicit assumption that there is no malfunction in the system, predictions are made from knowledge of the purpose of the system's design (this could also be called the "''teleological stance''").&lt;ref&gt;Like Rudyard Kipling's ''Just So Stories'', the theme of the "design" category is that things are simply just that way: a parallel to the doctoral candidate in Molière's ''Le Malade imaginaire'', who, when asked why opium made people go to sleep, spoke of it having a "dormitive virtue" (a sleep-inducing factor): "If you know something about the design of an artifact, you can predict its behavior without worrying yourself about the underlying physics of its parts. Even small children can readily learn to manipulate such complicated objects as VCRs without having a clue how they work; they know just what will happen when they press a sequence of buttons, because they know what is designed to happen. They are operating from what I call the design stance" (Dennett, 1995, p. 229).&lt;/ref&gt; At this level, we are concerned with such things as purpose, function and design. When we predict that a bird will fly when it flaps its wings on the basis that wings are made for flying, we are taking the design stance. Likewise, we can understand the bimetallic strip as a particular type of thermometer, not concerning ourselves with the details of how this type of thermometer happens to work. We can also recognize the purpose that this thermometer serves inside a thermostat and even generalize to other kinds of thermostats that might use a different sort of thermometer. We can even explain the thermostat in terms of what it's good for, saying that it keeps track of the temperature and turns on the heater whenever it gets below a minimum, turning it off once it reaches a maximum.
* Most abstract is the ''intentional stance'', the domain of software and minds, which requires no knowledge of either structure or design,&lt;ref&gt;Perkins (1983, p. 360), refers to the results of this "'''''human style'''''" of perception as a "'''''pragmatist's system'''''".&lt;/ref&gt; and "[clarifies] the logic of mentalistic explanations of behaviour, their predictive power, and their relation to other forms of explanation" (Bolton &amp; Hill, 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;24). Predictions are made on the basis of ''explanations'' expressed in terms of meaningful mental states; and, given the task of predicting or explaining the behaviour of a specific agent (a person, animal, corporation, artifact, nation, etc.), it is implicitly assumed that the agent will always act on the basis of its ''beliefs'' and ''desires'' in order to get precisely what it wants (this could also be called the "''folk psychology stance''").&lt;ref&gt;Observing that the term "belief" has a very wide range of meanings – and remarking that "we seldom talk about what people ''believe'', we [usually] talk about what they ''think'' and what they ''know''" – Dennett (1987, p. 46) produces a precise definition: "folk psychology has it that '''''beliefs''''' are information-bearing states of people that arise from perceptions and that, together appropriately related '''''desires''''', lead to intelligent '''''action'''''".&lt;/ref&gt; At this level, we are concerned with such things as belief, thinking and intent. When we predict that the bird will fly away because it knows the cat is coming and is afraid of getting eaten, we are taking the intentional stance. Another example would be when we predict that Mary will leave the theater and drive to the restaurant because she sees that the movie is over and is hungry.
* In 1971, Dennett also postulated that, whilst "the intentional stance ''presupposes'' neither lower stance", there may well be a fourth, higher level: a "truly moral stance toward the system" – the "''personal stance''" – which not only "presupposes the intentional stance" (viz., treats the system as ''rational'') but also "views it as a person" (1971/1978, p.&amp;nbsp;240).

A key point is that switching to a higher level of abstraction has its risks as well as its benefits. For example, when we view both a bimetallic strip and a tube of mercury as thermometers, we can lose track of the fact that they differ in accuracy and temperature range, leading to false predictions as soon as the thermometer is used outside the circumstances for which it was designed. The actions of a mercury thermometer heated to 500&amp;nbsp;°C can no longer be predicted on the basis of treating it as a thermometer; we have to sink down to the physical stance to understand it as a melted and boiled piece of junk.  For that matter, the "actions" of a dead bird are not predictable in terms of beliefs or desires.

Even when there is no immediate error, a higher-level stance can simply fail to be useful. If we were to try to understand the thermostat at the level of the intentional stance, ascribing to it beliefs about how hot it is and a desire to keep the temperature just right, we would gain no traction over the problem as compared to staying at the design stance, but we would generate theoretical commitments that expose us to absurdities, such as the possibility of the thermostat not being in the mood to work today because the weather is so nice. Whether to take a particular stance, then, is determined by how successful that stance is when applied.

Dennett argues that it is best to understand human behavior at the level of the intentional stance, without making any specific commitments to any deeper reality of the artifacts of [[folk psychology]]. In addition to the controversy inherent in this, there is also some dispute about the extent to which Dennett is committing to [[Philosophical realism|realism]] about mental properties. Initially, Dennett's interpretation was seen as leaning more towards [[instrumentalism]],&lt;ref&gt;Papineau (1995) defines instrumentalism as: "The doctrine that scientific theories are not true descriptions of an unobservable reality, but merely useful instruments which enable us to order and anticipate the observable world": a parallel to Perkins' "pragmatist's system" (Perkins, 1983, p. 360).&lt;/ref&gt; but over the years, as this idea has been used to support more extensive theories of [[consciousness]], it has been taken as being more like Realism. His own words hint at something in the middle, as he suggests that the self is as real as a center of gravity, "an [[abstract object]], a theorist's fiction", but [[operationalism|operationally]] valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a way of thinking about things, Dennett's intentional stance is entirely consistent with everyday commonsense understanding; and, thus, it meets [[Eleanor Rosch]]'s (1978, p. 28) criterion of the "maximum information with the least cognitive effort". Rosch argues that, implicit within any system of categorization, are the assumptions that:
:(a) the major purpose of any system of categorization is to reduce the randomness of the universe by providing "maximum information with the least cognitive effort", and
:(b) the real world is structured and systematic, rather than being arbitrary or unpredictable. Thus, if a particular way of categorizing information does, indeed, "provide maximum information with the least cognitive effort", ''it can only do so because the structure of that particular system of categories corresponds with the perceived structure of the real world''.

Also, the intentional stance meets the criteria Dennett specified (1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;50–51) for algorithms:
:(1) ''Substrate Neutrality'': It is a "mechanism" that produces results regardless of the material used to perform the procedure ("the power of the procedure is due to its logical structure, not the causal powers of the materials used in the instantiation").
:(2) ''Underlying Mindlessness'': Each constituent step, and each transition between each step, is so utterly simple, that they can be performed by a "dutiful idiot".
:(3) ''Guaranteed Results'': "Whatever it is that an algorithm does, it always does it, if it is executed without misstep. An algorithm is a foolproof recipe."

== Variants of Dennett's three stances ==
The general notion of a three level system was widespread in the late 1970s/early 1980s; for example, when discussing the mental representation of information from a [[cognitive psychology]] perspective, Glass and his colleagues (1979, p.&amp;nbsp;24) distinguished three important aspects of representation:
:(a) the ''content'' ("what is being represented");
:(b) the ''code'' ("the format of the representation");&lt;ref&gt;Glass et al. (1979, p. 3) distinguish between ''content'' and ''code'' as follows: "A simple English word like '''''cat''''' is a representation. It represents a certain '''''concept''''' or idea, namely the concept of a furry house-hold pet that purrs. Note that this same concept can be represented in many different ways. We could use a picture of a cat to represent the concept. We could translate cat into Spanish and represent it by '''''gato'''''. We could represent it in Morse code by a series of dots and dashes, or in Braille by a certain tactile pattern. Across all these examples the information being represented stays the same. This common information is called the content of the representation. Each different way the information can be expressed is called a representational code. So the words '''''cat''''' and '''''gato''''' represent the same content, but in different codes (i.e., written English vs. written Spanish). In contrast the words '''''cat''''' and '''''lawyer''''' represent different contents, but in the same code (written English)."&lt;/ref&gt; and
:(c) the ''medium'' ("the physical realization of the code").&lt;ref&gt;Glass et al. (1979, p. 3) distinguish between ''code'' and ''media'' as follows: "Listen to someone singing. Then listen to a recording of the same person singing the same song. The two sounds would probably be virtually identical. Yet the sound would be produced in very different ways – in one case by human vocal cords, in the other by electronic components. These are two different '''''media''''' for producing the same auditory '''''code'''''." Glass et al. also make the point that "cognitive psychology primarily explores representational codes" (p. 24) and "cognitive psychologists study representational codes rather than media" (p. 7).&lt;/ref&gt;
Other significant cognitive scientists who also advocated a three level system were [[Allen Newell]], [[Zenon Pylyshyn]], and [[David Marr (neuroscientist)|David Marr]]. The parallels between the four representations (each of which implicitly assumed that computers ''and'' human minds displayed each of the three distinct levels) are detailed in the following table:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;" 
|- style="background:#bdb76b;"
! Daniel Dennett &lt;br/&gt; "Stances" !! Zenon Pylyshyn &lt;br/&gt; "Levels of Organization" !! Allen Newell &lt;br&gt; "Levels of Description" !! David Marr &lt;br/&gt; "Levels of Analysis"
|-
| &lt;br/&gt;Physical Stance.&lt;ref&gt;In the case of both Dennett and Pylyshyn's terminology the designation "physical" means "relating to physics" (as in "physical laws"), with the strong implication that we are speaking of "[[Hard and soft science|hard science]]".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  || Physical Level, or Biological Level.&lt;ref&gt;"The structure and the principles by which the physical object functions correspond to the physical or the biological level" (Pylyshyn, 1989, p. 57). "We obviously need the biological level to explain such things as the effects of drugs or jet lag or brain damage on behavior" (p.6 1).&lt;/ref&gt; || Physical Level, or Device Level.&lt;ref&gt;Essentially the same as Pylyshyn's ''Physical Level or Biological Level''.&lt;/ref&gt; || Hardware Implementation Level.&lt;ref&gt;Specifies the algorithm's physical substrates (Marr, 1982, p. 24): "How can the representation and algorithm be realized physically?" (p. 25).&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| &lt;br/&gt;Design Stance.&lt;ref&gt;In "Brain Writing and Mind Reading" (1975), Dennett very clearly states that he is agnostic about what he terms "Brain Writing".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; || Symbol Level.&lt;ref&gt;"The semantic content of knowledge and goals is assumed to be encoded by symbolic expressions" (Pylyshyn, 1989, p. 57). "We need the symbol level to explain such things as why some tasks take longer or result in more errors than other tasks" (p. 60). "Information processing psychology is full of examples of discovering that the form of the representation makes a difference to their [sic] behavior in experiments. For example, in problem-solving experiments it makes a difference whether subjects encode the fact that all the objects in a box are red or the equivalent fact that none of the objects is blue" (p. 61).&lt;/ref&gt; || Program Level, or Symbol Level.&lt;ref&gt;Essentially the same as Pylyshyn's ''Symbol Level''.&lt;/ref&gt; || Representation and Algorithm Level.&lt;ref&gt;Specifies how the device does what it does (Marr, 1982, p. 23): "How can this computational theory be implemented? In particular, what is the representation for the input and output, and what is the algorithm for the transformation?" (p. 25).&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| &lt;br/&gt;Intentional Stance.&lt;ref&gt;Dennett stressed "that the intentional stance presupposes '''''neither''''' lower stance" (Dennett 1971/1978, p. 240)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; || Semantic,&lt;ref&gt;: "Although the cognitive science community tends to use the term knowledge quite freely in discussing semantic level principles, it is sometimes worth distinguishing those semantic entities that are knowledge from those that are goals, percepts, plans, and so on. The more general term semantic level is used in contexts where such distinctions are important. Philosophers even talk about the 'intentional' level or 'intentional' objects, but because the use of that terminology tends to raise a large, ancient, and not entirely relevant set of issues, we [viz., Pylyshyn and Newell] shun that term here" (Pylyshyn, 1989, p. 86).&lt;/ref&gt; or Knowledge Level.&lt;ref&gt;Pylyshyn (1989): "[Explains] why people, or appropriately programmed computers, do certain things by saying what they know and what their goals are and by showing that these are connected in certain meaningful or even rational ways." (p. 57) "We need the knowledge level to explain why certain goals and beliefs tend to lead to certain behaviors, and why the behaviors can be changed in rational ways when new beliefs are added by telling things." (p. 60)&lt;/ref&gt; || Knowledge Level.&lt;ref&gt;Newell was aware of Dennett's views prior to Newell's (1980) address that was, later, published in full 1982: "Before I finished preparing that address I found and read ''Brainstorms''. It was instantly clear to  me that the knowledge level and the intentional stance are fundamentally the same, and I indicated as much in the talk." (Newell, 1988, p. 521)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newell (1982), p. 98: "The system at the knowledge level is the agent. The components at the knowledge level are '''''goals''''', '''''actions''''', and '''''bodies'''''. Thus, an agent is composed of a set of actions, a set of goals and a body. The medium at the knowledge level is '''''knowledge''''' (as might be suspected). Thus, the agent processes its knowledge to determine the actions to take. Finally, the behavior law is the '''''principle of rationality''''': Actions are selected to attain the agent's goals.&lt;br /&gt;"To treat a system at the knowledge level is to treat it as having some knowledge and some goals, and believing it will do whatever is within its power to attain its goals, in so far as its knowledge indicates."&lt;/ref&gt; || Computational Theory Level.&lt;ref&gt;This level specifies "'''''what''''' the device does and why" (Marr, 1982, p. 22): "What is the goal of the computation, why is it appropriate, and what is the logic of the strategy by which it can be carried out?" (p. 25)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objections and replies==
The most obvious objection to Dennett is the intuition that it "matters" to us whether an object has an inner life or not. The claim is that we don't just imagine the intentional states of other people in order to predict their behaviour; the fact that they have thoughts and feelings just like we do is central to notions such as trust, friendship and love. The [[Blockhead argument]] proposes that someone, Jones, has a twin who is in fact not a person but a very sophisticated robot which looks and acts like Jones in every way, but who (it is claimed) somehow does not have any thoughts or feelings at all, just a chip which controls his behaviour; in other words, "the lights are on but no one's home". According to the intentional systems theory (IST), Jones and the robot have precisely the same beliefs and desires, but this is claimed to be false. The IST expert assigns the same mental states to Blockhead as he does to Jones, "whereas in fact [Blockhead] has not a thought in his head."  Dennett has argued against this by denying the premise, on the basis that the robot is a [[philosophical zombie]] and therefore metaphysically impossible.  In other words, if something acts in all ways conscious, it necessarily is, as consciousness is defined in terms of behavioral capacity, not ineffable [[qualia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/unzombie.htm Daniel Dennett, The Unimagined Preposterousness of Zombies]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another objection attacks the premise that treating people as [[perfect rationality|ideally rational]] creatures will yield the best predictions. [[Stephen Stich]] argues that people often have beliefs or desires which are irrational or bizarre, and IST doesn't allow us to say anything about these. If the person's "environmental niche" is examined closely enough, and the possibility of malfunction in their brain (which might affect their reasoning capacities) is looked into, it may be possible to formulate a predictive strategy specific to that person. Indeed this is what we often do when someone is behaving unpredictably &amp;mdash; we look for the reasons why. In other words, we can only deal with irrationality by contrasting it against the background assumption of rationality. This development significantly undermines the claims of the intentional stance argument.

The rationale behind the intentional stance is based on evolutionary theory, particularly the notion that the ability to make quick predictions of a system's behaviour based on what we think it might be thinking was an evolutionary adaptive advantage. The fact that our predictive powers are not perfect is a further result of the advantages sometimes accrued by acting contrary to expectations.

==Neural evidence==

Philip Robbins and Anthony I. Jack suggest that "Dennett's philosophical distinction between the physical and intentional stances has a lot going for it" from the perspective of psychology and neuroscience. They review studies on abilities to adopt an intentional stance (variously called "mindreading," "mentalizing," or "theory of mind") as distinct from adopting a physical stance ("folk physics," "intuitive physics," or "theory of body"). [[Autism]] seems to be a deficit in the intentional stance with preservation of the physical stance, while [[Williams syndrome]] can involve deficits in the physical stance with preservation of the intentional stance. This tentatively suggests a [[double dissociation]] of intentional and physical stances in the brain.&lt;ref name=RobbinsJack2006&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Philip Robbins|author2=Anthony I. Jack|title=The phenomenal stance|journal=Philosophical Studies|date=Jan 2006|volume=127|issue=1|pages=59–85|doi=10.1007/s11098-005-1730-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals' ability to understand other people's basic intentions or goals; instead, data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others' viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hamilton AF | title = Goals, intentions and mental states: challenges for theories of autism | journal = J Child Psychol Psychiatry | volume = 50 | issue = 8 | pages = 881–92 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19508497 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2009.02098.x | citeseerx = 10.1.1.621.6275 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robbins and Jack point to a 2003 study&lt;ref name=MartinWeisberg2003&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Alex Martin|author2=Jill Weisberg|title=Neural Foundations For Understanding Social And Mechanical Concepts|journal=Cogn Neuropsychol|date=2003|volume=20|issue=3-6|pages=575–87|doi=10.1080/02643290342000005|pmc=1450338|pmid=16648880}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which participants viewed animated geometric shapes in different "vignettes," some of which could be interpreted as constituting social interaction, while others suggested mechanical behavior. Viewing social interactions elicited activity in brain regions associated with identifying faces and biological objects (posterior temporal cortex), as well as emotion processing (right amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex). Meanwhile, the mechanical interactions activated regions related to identifying objects like tools that can be manipulated (posterior temporal lobe). The authors suggest "that these findings reveal putative 'core systems' for social and mechanical understanding that are divisible into constituent parts or elements with distinct processing and storage capabilities."&lt;ref name=MartinWeisberg2003 /&gt;

==Phenomenal stance==

Robbins and Jack argue for an additional stance beyond the three that Dennett outlined. They call it the ''phenomenal stance'': Attributing consciousness, emotions, and inner experience to a mind. The [[explanatory gap]] of the [[hard problem of consciousness]] illustrates this tendency of people to see phenomenal experience as different from physical processes. The authors suggest that psychopathy may represent a deficit in the phenomenal but not intentional stance, while people with autism appear to have intact moral sensibilities, just not mind-reading abilities. These examples suggest a double dissociation between the intentional and phenomenal stances.&lt;ref name=RobbinsJack2006 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Anthony I. Jack|author2=Philip Robbins|title=The Phenomenal Stance|journal=Philosophical Studies|date=Sep 2006|volume=|issue=127|pages=59–85|doi=10.1007/s11098-005-1730-x|url=https://www.academia.edu/173969/The_phenomenal_stance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a follow-up paper, Robbins and Jack describe four experiments about how the intentional and phenomenal stances relate to feelings of moral concern. The first two experiments showed that talking about lobsters as strongly emotional led to a much greater sentiment that lobsters deserved welfare protections than did talking about lobsters as highly intelligent. The third and fourth studies found that perceiving an agent as vulnerable led to greater attributions of phenomenal experience. Also, people who scored higher on the empathetic-concern subscale of the [[Interpersonal Reactivity Index]] had generally higher absolute attributions of mental experience.&lt;ref name=JackRobbins2012&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Anthony I. Jack|author2=Philip Robbins|title=The Phenomenal Stance Revisited|journal=Review of Philosophy and Psychology|date=Sep 2012|volume=3|issue=3|pages=383–403|doi=10.1007/s13164-012-0104-5|url=http://www.tonyjack.org/files/2012%20Jack%20and%20Robbins%20The%20phenomenal%20stance%20revisited.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryce Huebner (2010) performed two [[experimental philosophy]] studies to test students' ascriptions of various mental states to humans compared with cyborgs and robots. Experiment 1 showed that while students attributed both beliefs and pains most strongly to humans, they were more willing to attribute beliefs than pains to robots and cyborgs.&lt;ref name=Huebner2010&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bryce Huebner|title=Commonsense concepts of phenomenal consciousness: Does anyone ''care'' about functional zombies?|journal=Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences|date=Mar 2010|volume=9|issue=1|pages=133–55|doi=10.1007/s11097-009-9126-6|url=http://faculty.georgetown.edu/lbh24/CCPC.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|138}} "[T]hese data seem to confirm that commonsense psychology does draw a distinction between phenomenal and non-phenomenal states--and this distinction seems to be dependent on the structural properties of an entity in a way that ascriptions of non-phenomenal states are not."&lt;ref name=Huebner2010 /&gt;{{rp|138–39}} However, this conclusion is only tentative in view of the high variance among participants.&lt;ref name=Huebner2010 /&gt;{{rp|139}} Experiment 2 showed analogous results: Both beliefs and happiness were ascribed most strongly to biological humans, and ascriptions of happiness to robots or cyborgs were less common than ascriptions of beliefs.&lt;ref name=Huebner2010 /&gt;{{rp|142}}

The '''Jacobean style''' is the second phase of [[Renaissance architecture]] in England, following the [[Elizabethan style]]. It is named after King [[James I of England]], with whose reign (1603–1625 in England) it is associated.  At the start of James' reign there was little stylistic break in architecture, as Elizabethan trends continued their development. However his death in 1625 came as a decisive change towards more classical architecture, with Italian influence, was in progress, led by [[Inigo Jones]]; the style this began is sometimes called Stuart architecture, or [[English Baroque]] (though the latter term may be regarded as starting later).

Courtiers continued to build large [[prodigy house]]s, even though James spent less time on summer progresses round his realm than Elizabeth had. The influence of Flemish and German [[Northern Mannerism]] increased, now often executed by immigrant craftsmen and artists, rather than obtained from books as in the previous reign. There continued to be very little building of new churches, though a considerable amount of modifications to old ones, but a great deal of secular building.

==Characteristics==

The reign of James VI of Scotland (or James I of England (1603–1625)), a disciple of the new scholarship, saw the first decisive adoption of Renaissance motifs in a free form communicated to England through [[Germany|German]] and [[Flemish]] carvers rather than directly from [[Italy]]. Although the general lines of Elizabethan design remained, there was a more consistent and unified application of formal design, both in plan and elevation. Much use was made of columns and [[pilaster]]s, round-arch [[arcade (architecture)|arcades]], and flat roofs with [[openwork]] [[parapet]]s. These and other classical elements appeared in a free and fanciful vernacular rather than with any true classical purity. With them were mixed the prismatic rustications and ornamental detail of scrolls, [[strapwork|straps]], and [[lozenge]]s also characteristic of Elizabethan design. The style influenced [[Elizabethan and Jacobean furniture|furniture design]] and other [[decorative arts]].

==History and examples==
[[File:Crewe Hall (east bdg detail).jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Jacobean east wing of [[Crewe Hall]], Cheshire, built in 1615–36]]
[[File:Bank Hall Daffodils.jpeg|thumb|250px|[[Bank Hall]], Bretherton, built in 1608]]
Reproductions of the classic orders had already  found their way into English architecture during the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]], frequently based upon [[John Shute (architect)|John Shute]]'s ''The First and Chief Grounds of Architecture'', published in 1563, with two other editions in 1579 and 1584. In 1577, three years before the commencement of [[Wollaton Hall]], a copybook of the orders was brought out in [[Antwerp]] by [[Hans Vredeman de Vries]]. Although nominally based on the description of the orders by [[Vitruvius]], the author indulged freely not only in his rendering of them, but in suggestions of his own, showing how the orders might be employed in various buildings. Those suggestions were of a most decadent type, so that even the author deemed it advisable to publish a letter from a canon of the Church, stating that there was nothing in his architectural designs that was contrary to religion. It is to publications of this kind that Jacobean architecture owes the perversion of its forms and the introduction of strap work and pierced crestings, which appear for the first time at [[Wollaton Hall]] (1580); at [[Bramshill House]], [[Hampshire]] (1607–1612), and in [[Holland House, London|Holland House]], [[Kensington]] (1624), it receives its fullest development.

[[Hatfield House]], built in its entirety by [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]], between 1607 and 1611, is an example of the later extension of the Elizabethan [[prodigy house]], with turreted Tudor-style wings at each end with their mullioned windows but the two wings linked by an [[Italianate]] Renaissance facade.  This central facade, originally an open [[loggia]], has been attributed to Inigo Jones himself; however, the central porch carries a heavier quasi-gatehouse emphasis, so the attribution is probably false.  Inside the house, the elaborately carved staircase demonstrates the Renaissance influence on English ornament.

Other Jacobean buildings of note are [[Crewe Hall]], [[Cheshire]]; [[Hatfield House]], [[Hertfordshire]]; [[Knole House]], near [[Sevenoaks]] in [[Kent]]; [[Charlton House]] in [[Charlton, London]]; [[Holland House, London|Holland House]] by [[John Thorpe]]; [[Plas Teg]] near [[Pontblyddyn]], between [[Wrexham]] and [[Mold, Flintshire|Mold]] in Wales; [[Bank Hall]] in Bretherton; [[Castle Bromwich Hall]] near Solihull; and [[Lilford Hall]] in Northamptonshire.

Although the term is generally employed of the style which prevailed in England during the first quarter of the 17th century, its peculiar decadent detail will be found nearly twenty years earlier at [[Wollaton Hall]], [[Nottingham]], and in [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]] examples exist up to 1660, notwithstanding the introduction of the purer Italian style by [[Inigo Jones]] in 1619 at [[Whitehall]].

==In the Americas==
In 1607 and 1620, England founded her first successful colonies: [[Jamestown, Virginia]] and [[Plymouth, Massachusetts]]. As with other settlers in the New World, the men and women that built the homes and buildings that formed the infrastructure of these towns and the others that followed over the coming century often built edifices that were consistent with Jacobean vernacular architecture in the portion of England that they originated from: for example, the clapboard common to houses in New England and later Nova Scotia to this day are derived from a local style of architecture popular in Northeast England in the early to mid 17th century. Historians often classify this architecture as a subtype of colonial American architecture,  called [[First Period]] architecture, however there is an enormous amount of overlap between the architecture of the commoner class in early 17th century England and colonial America architecture, where some of the key features of the Jacobean era often outlived James I and VI owing to less contact between the American colonists and the fashions of England.

When the Puritans arrived in the winter of 1620 in New England, there was very little time to waste owing to the bitterly cold weather and the fact that many of the occupants of the ship that brought them, the [[Mayflower]], were very ill and needed to get into housing before circumstances could allow the diseases on board to spread further. Those that were still able bodied had to act quickly and as a result the first buildings of New England most resembled  the wattle and daub cottages of the common people  back home, especially of places like [[East Anglia]] and [[Devon]]shire, with the thatched roofs that remained common in England until the 1660s differing only in that the main material chosen for thatching was grass found in the local salt marshes.&lt;ref name="illinois1"&gt;http://www.histarch.illinois.edu/plymouth/folkhouse.htm#N_40_&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these would have been hall and parlor dwellings with a simple central chimney, a feature of British architecture since the earlier [[Elizabethan]] era, a timber frame, a squat lower floor and an upper floor with bare beams and a space to be used for storage.&lt;ref name="illinois1" /&gt; Measurements of the archaeological remains of houses owned by [[Myles Standish]] and [[John Alden]] done in  the mid nineteenth and the mid twentieth century in Duxbury, Massachusetts, a town across the harbor from Plymouth, also settled by the original Pilgrim Fathers, and inhabited just eight years later, reveal that the original homes were very narrow and small, averaging approximately forty feet long by fifteen feet wide. This concurs with the dimensions of houses that would have been found amongst the English commoner classes (specifically yeoman and small farmers) as evidenced by the surviving tax rolls of the Jacobean era.

Examples of original Jacobean architecture in the Americas include [[Drax Hall Estate|Drax Hall Great House]] and [[St Nicholas Abbey|St. Nicholas Abbey]], both located in [[Barbados]], and [[Bacon's Castle]] in [[Surry County, Virginia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6768">'''''The Search for Odin''''' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''Jakten på [[Odin]]'') is the project title of [[Thor Heyerdahl]]'s last series of [[archaeology|archaeological]] excavations, which took place in [[Azov]] ([[Tanais]]) in [[Russia]].

== Theoretical background ==
Heyerdahl's intention was to prove the veracity of the account of [[Snorri Sturluson]] in the [[Ynglinga saga]], written in the 13th century, about the origin of the Norse royal dynasties, and the pre-Christian Norse gods. Snorri provides a [[euhemerism|euhemeristic]] account, in which he describes the [[Norse mythology|Norse god]] [[Odin]] and some other Norse gods, the [[Æsir]], as having been real people who emigrated from the area around the river [[Don River, Russia|Don]] to [[Scandinavia]] at the time of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] expansion into their old homeland. In Scandinavia, Snorri writes, they so impressed the native population that they started worshipping them as gods.

Heyerdahl tried to seek the origins of the Æsir, following the route set out by Snorri Sturluson in the Ynglinga saga, from the [[Black Sea]] and the river [[Don River, Russia|Tanais]] (referred to by Snorri Sturluson by the names ''Tanaís'' and ''Tanakvísl''&lt;ref&gt;Wikiheimild: [http://is.wikisource.org/wiki/Heimskringla/Ynglinga_saga/1 Heimskringla - Ynglinga saga: 1. Hér segir frá landaskipan]&lt;/ref&gt;) via [[Saxons|Saxon]] homelands in northern [[Germany]], [[Odense]] on [[Fyn]], [[Denmark]] to [[Old Sigtuna]], ancient [[Sweden]]. When Heyerdahl died in 2002 the second season of excavations had just been finished.

== Critique ==
Heyerdahl's Odin project was subjected to fierce criticism from Norwegian academics within the fields of research upon which the theory touches. Both the first book detailing the Odin project, ''Ingen grenser'' from 1999, and the second book, ''Jakten på Odin'' from 2001, were met with a forceful and detailed response from leading academics in which the reasons were laid out to the wider public as to why Heyerdahl's theory in their view was false. After the last book the attacks against Heyerdahl were also worded in a way that by many was seen as disrespectful.&lt;ref name = "skep"&gt;"[...]mange har oppfattet den som nedsettende", one of the five reviewers, Anne Stalsberg, wrote in the article [http://skepsis.no/?p=517 'Ytringsfrihet og påstått vitenskap – et dilemma?']&lt;/ref&gt; The five leading academics responsible for the reviews explained that although popular literature would not normally be subject to such scrutiny, they felt it was necessary in this case, partly because Heyerdahl himself laid claim to academic credentials and partly due to his popularity.&lt;ref name = "skep"/&gt;

The reviewers, speaking on behalf of the academic community of Norway, categorize Heyerdahl's theory as an example of [[pseudoarchaeology]], based on a selective reading of sources, and a lack of understanding, or a lack of willingness to use basic scientific methodology. Much of the foundation of his theory, they point out, is based on similarities between names of figures from Norse mythology and geographical place-names of the present time in the [[Pontic steppe]] and Caucasus. Comparison of these names is done with disregard of [[linguistics|linguistic]] theory, according to the reviewers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Even Hovdhaugen]], Christian Keller, Else Mundal, Anne Stalsberg, Gro Steinsland: Anmeldelse av Thor Heyerdahl og Per Lillieström: Jakten på Odin. Stenersens forlag. Oslo 2001. Maal og Minne 1 (2002) s. 98-109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Azov is believed by Heyerdahl to have derived its name from ''as-[[Heathen hofs|hof]]'' – ''temple of the Æsir''. Mainstream linguists and historians will say that the city of Azov got its name from the [[Turkish people|Turks]], over 1000 years after Heyerdahl believes the Æsir lived there. Heyerdahl also points to the similarities between the word Æsir and the [[Azerbaijani people|Azeri]] and Ossetian peoples of the Caucasus, between the god Odin and the [[Caucasian languages|Caucasian]] language group [[Udi language|Udi]] and between the god [[Tyr]] and [[Turkey]], and between the [[Vanir]] (a group of Norse gods) and the word ''[[Vannic Armenian Kingdom|Vannic]]'', which was for a time in the 19th and 20th centuries the name used for the [[Urartian language]], spoken in ancient times in the area around Lake Van.

The linguists and historians behind the review point out that there is no reason to believe that these similarities are any more than coincidences. In particular, they point out that Heyerdahl makes no attempt to look at the development of languages – he anachronistically compares modern day forms with ancient ones. For instance, diachronic linguists will say that the god Odin was called ''[[Wōdanaz]]'' 2,000 years ago, which no longer looks so similar to Udi. Similarly, they assert that his hypothesis fails to explain why there should be any relation whatever between antiquity/medieval [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] names, and names that are to be attributed to extremely distant languages, if those be [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] at all (as [[Turkic languages|Turkish]] and Caucasian languages have no relation whatever to Germanic, while [[Ossetic language|Ossetic]] at least is Indo-European, although from the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] family). However, others like Swedish Professor Åke Daun&lt;ref&gt;http://www.popularsocialscience.com/2013/01/08/never-marry-a-swede/&lt;/ref&gt; say that the Turkic Huns were the ruling elite of the Goths.

'''Anthony Joseph "Joe" Graham''' (born 30 January 1944), is a [[Belfast]]-based [[Irish people|Irish]] writer and historian. He founded ''Rushlight: The Belfast Magazine'' in 1972. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Joe Graham was born in Belfast, the eighth of twelve children born to Jim and Kitty Graham. He was raised in what was then the newly built [[Springfield Road, Belfast|Ballymurphy]] housing estate in the west of the city. He attended St. John’s Public Elementary School and later St. Thomas's Secondary Intermediate School. One of his teachers was [[Michael McLaverty]], who himself wrote stories (''Call My Brother Back'') about the political troubles in Belfast. MacLaverty encouraged Graham to express himself in the written word, prompting Graham to write a number of short plays which were staged and performed locally in his own community. 
Graham's interest in writing and politics deepened.

Graham's father, Jim, would take his son on bike rides and excursions across the length and breadth of [[County Antrim]] to ensure that Joe developed a clear knowledge of many of the historical events that occurred there – particularly the [[1798 rebellion]] in which the Graham family played a prominent role: [http://www.wattygrahamsgac.com/HistoryWatty.aspx Watty Graham], an ancestor, was executed by the British in 1798.

==''Rushlight''==
On one excursion when Joe was only 12 years old, he and his father visited a graveyard situated in Mallusk, close to [[Templepatrick]]. At the back of the graveyard Joe looked at a tall monument erected to the memory of the famed [[James Hope (Ireland)|James Hope]]. Right beside his grave was that of his son, Luke. Inscribed on Luke Hope’s grave was a word that caught the 12-year-old Joe’s eye – the word was "Rushlight". Luke Hope published his "Rushlight" on 3 December 1825, from Clark &amp; Hope’s General Printing Office in High Street, in Belfast. It received the name Rushlight after a [[Rushlight|form of candle]]. However, the paper went out of print after 41 editions and Luke Hope died a young man.

In 1967, at the age of 23, Joe Graham became the editor of ''The Pike'', an Irish republican news sheet.

==Activism==
His involvement in ''The Pike'' gave Graham the opportunity to publish his views on such issues as the [[Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922|Special Powers Act]] and share his opinion with the local community. His interest in civil rights motivated his presence in Duke Street, Derry, on 5 October 1968 and on 4 January 1969 at the [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association#Burntollet|Burntollet Ambush]], where marchers, many of whom were members of a student body named "The People’s Democracy", were physically assaulted by loyalists. In 1969, he became a founding member of the '''Belfast &amp; District Civil Rights Group''',&lt;ref&gt;''The Provisional IRA'' by Patrick Bishop, Eamonn Mallie (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;'''The Ardoyne Citizen's Action Committee''' and '''The Belfast Housing Action Committee'''. These groups were established to address the need for the provision and improvement of housing in Catholic areas.

Graham later established news sheets aimed at Irish republican activists in [[Ardoyne]] (''The Ardoyne Freedom Fighter''), Ballymurphy (''Scale''), and in the [[The Falls Road|Falls Road]] area of [[Clonard, Belfast|Clonard]] (''The Vindicator''). {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==Rushlight Gets Printed==
In 1972, Graham,the man published ''Rushlight - The Belfast Magazine'' for the first time. He shared the stories his father had originally shared with him as a boy as well as his own historical research and study. The magazine included articles of local interest, folklore, and tales of old Belfast. ''The Rushlight'' proved to be a staple part of Belfast literature with copies being forwarded by locals to relatives around the world, as well as copies being held in the [http://www.linenhall.com/Catalogue.asp Linen Hall Library Catalog], as well as at the [https://web.archive.org/web/20050129052950/http://qu-prism.qub.ac.uk/TalisPrism/ Queen's University Library Catalogue], both in Belfast.

In May 2002, Joe Graham was awarded the "Irish Hand" for his "continued and appreciated contribution of Rushlight Magazine to the Irish communities in Belfast, [[Brompton (Sherbrooke)|Brompton, Canada]], and around the world". {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} In 2008, he wrote ''Show Me The Man – The Official Biography of [[Martin Meehan (Irish republican)|Martin Meehan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thepensivequill.am/search/label/Martin%20Meehan The Pensive Quill review of ''Show Me The Man'']&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3992">[[File:Johannes Vergenhans (Nauclerus) 1425.jpg|thumb|Johannes Nauclerus.]]
'''Johannes Nauclerus (Naucler, Naukler)''' ({{circa}} 1425 – May 1, 1510) was a 16th-century [[Swabia]]n [[historian]] and [[Humanism|humanist]]. He was born '''Johann Vergenhans''' to a [[Nobility|noble]] (or [[knight]]ed) man of the same name. As was the fashion of the time, the family's name had been [[Latin]]ized, with ''nauclerus'', meaning "[[Skipper (boating)|skipper]]," being a close [[translation]] of ''Vergenhans'', meaning "[[ferry]]man."  The family's [[coat of arms]] depicted a man on a sailing ship.[http://web.telia.com/~u42300055/NAU/The_book.htm]

Nauclerus became a [[doctor of law]] in 1450 and supervisor to Count [[Eberhard I, Duke of Württemberg|Eberhard V of Württemberg]]. In 1460, he was head of the church in [[Stuttgart]]. He seems to have spent some time in [[Italy]], and had contact with [[Pope Pius II]]. From 1464 to 1465 he taught at the [[University of Basel]], and in 1466 he was in [[Rome]].

In 1477 he became first [[Rector (academia)|rector]] at the [[University of Tübingen]] and subsequently its second [[chancellor]].

In 1502, Nauclerus assumed the office of a [[judge]] of the [[Swabian League]], which he held until the withdrawal of [[Württemberg]] from the federation in 1513.[http://www.pforzheim.de/portal/page?_pageid=123,50497&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL]

==Work==
He is the author of the ''World Chronicle'' (''Memorabilium omnis aetatis et omnium gentium chronici commentarii'', 1516), printed [[Posthumous work|posthumously]], with its foreword written by [[Johann Reuchlin]]. The work chronicled the centuries from the time of [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] to the year 1500. This work did not follow the traditional temporal divisions of "ages" (''aetates'') and "realms" (''regna''), but adhered to a division based on [[generation]]s.

Written in [[Latin]] and on the suggestion of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]], it described [[Biblical]] events, such as the building of the [[Tower of Babel]], as well as events from [[Greek mythology]], such as the [[Trojan War]]. Also included were historical events such as the burning of [[Girolamo Savonarola]] in [[Florence]] (1498).

Nauclerus consulted an unusually large number of different sources (such as an account by [[Eilmer of Malmesbury]]), indicating that he was already committed to the new spirit of humanism. Some of the sources he consulted no longer exist; their contents are only known through Nauclerus' work.[http://www.bsb-muenchen.de/foerder/p52.htm]

This work was known to [[Ortelius]] through [[Franciscus Irenicus]].[http://www.orteliusmaps.com/ortbib/Ortbibsourcesv.htm] [[Erasmus]] also wrote a laudatory foreword.[http://www.bsb-muenchen.de/foerder/p52.htm]

Other works include his ''Tractatus de symonia perutilis'' (Tübingen, 1500).

==Legacy==
*Nauklerstraße ("Naukler Street"), in [[Tübingen]], is named after him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3168">'''John Blair''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]], [[Society of Antiquaries of London|FSA]] (died 24 June 1782), was a British clergyman, and [[chronologist]].

==Life==
He was born and educated in Edinburgh. 
Leaving Scotland as a young man, he became usher of a school in Hedge Lane, London, in succession to Andrew Henderson, author of a well-known history of the rebellion of 1745.{{sfn|Grosart|1886}}

In 1754, he published, 'The Chronology and History of the World, from the Creation to the Year of Christ 1753, illustrated in fifty-six tables.' 
It was dedicated to the lord chancellor (Hardwicke), and was published by subscription. 
In the preface he acknowledged great obligations to the Earl of Bute.
The plan and scope of the work originated with Dr. Hugh Blair's scheme of chronological tables. The 'Chronology' was reprinted in 1756, 1768, and 1814. 
It was revised and enlarged 'by Willoughby Rosse in Bohn's 'Scientific Library,' 1856. 
In 1768, Blair published 'Fourteen Maps of Ancient and Modern Geography, for the illustration of the Tables of Chronology and History ; to which is prefixed a dissertation on the Rise and Progress of Geography.' The dissertation was separately republished in 1784.{{sfn|Grosart|1886}}

Blair's first book was well received. In 1755 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and in its 'Transactions' appeared a paper by him on the 'Agitation of the Waters near Reading'&lt;ref&gt;''Phil. Trans''. x. 651, 1755&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Grosart|1886}}

He had previously obtained orders in the church of England, and in September 1757 was appointed chaplain to  [[Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha]] and mathematical tutor to the [[Prince Edward, Duke of York and Albany]]. 
In March 1761, on the promotion of Dr. Townshend to the deanery of Norwich, Blair was given a prebendal stall at Westminster. 
Within a week the dean and chapter of Westminster presented him to the vicarage of Hinckley. 
In the same year he was chosen fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. 
In September 1763 he left with the Duke of York on a tour on the continent, and was absent until 1764. In 1771 he was transferred, by presentation of the dean and chapter of Westminster, to the vicarage of St. Bride, London, and again to the rectory of St. John the Evangelist, Westminster, in April 1776. 
He was also rector of Horton (Milton's Horton) in Buckinghamshire. 
He died on 24 June 1782.{{sfn|Grosart|1886}}

Blair's 'Lectures on the Canons of the Old Testament, comprehending a Dissertation on the Septuagint Version,' 1785, was a posthumous publication.{{sfn|Grosart|1886}}

'''José Gerson da Cunha''' (2 February 1844&amp;nbsp;– 3 August 1900) was a [[Goa]]n physician who achieved international renown as an [[Orientalism|orientalist]], historian, [[Linguistics|linguist]] and [[Numismatics|numismatist]].

==Early life and medical career==
José Gerson da Cunha was born in [[Arpora]], [[Bardez]] on 2 February 1844, the eldest of twelve children to a [[Goan Catholics|Goan Catholic]] couple, Francisco Caetano da Cunha and Leopoldina Maria Gonçalves.&lt;ref name="Vaz1"&gt;{{harvnb|Vaz|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7DJLxYBYA-YC&amp;pg=PA118#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 118]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cunha Rivara"/&gt; Francisco was an infantry lieutenant in the Portuguese army stationed in [[Goa]] who had taken part in the military campaign against the [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]] at Uspa and Rarim in [[Savantvadi]].&lt;ref name="Cunha Rivara"/&gt; The family traced its descent to Balkrishna Shenoy, also known as ''Balsa Sinai''; a 16th-century [[Goud Saraswat Brahmin]] from [[Cortalim]] in Salcette.&lt;ref name="Cunha Gonçalves2"&gt;{{harvnb|Derrett|1976|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=yH8eAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA473#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 473]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his employment by the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese authorities]] in 1555, Balkrishna moved to [[Pilerne]] in [[Bardez]] with his two nephews Mangappa and Panduranga Shenoy.&lt;ref name="rib"&gt;{{harvnb|Mascarenhas|2008|loc=|Ref=cun}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he converted to Christianity and adopted the surname "Cunha". He later settled down in Arpora.&lt;ref name="sal"&gt;{{harvnb|Mascarenhas|2010|loc=|Ref=mar}}&lt;/ref&gt; His conversion had been preceded by that of his nephew Mangappa who changed his name to Pero Ribeiro and earned the distinction of being the first Christian of Bardez.&lt;ref name="rib"/&gt;

Cunha did his primary studies and study of [[humanities]] in [[Panjim]].&lt;ref name="Arpora"&gt;{{harvnb|Naval and Military Medical Services|1900|p=781}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then moved to [[Bombay]] and enrolled in the [[Grant Medical College and Sir Jamshedjee Jeejeebhoy Group of Hospitals|Grant Medical College]] to pursue his [[Medical humanities|medical studies]].&lt;ref name="Konkani1"&gt;{{harvnb|Sardesai|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=1YILeUD_oZUC&amp;pg=PA96#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 96]}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there, Cunha distinguished himself by winning many prizes.&lt;ref name="Vaz1"/&gt; However, he failed to obtain his licentiate in Medicine, and instead obtained the first degree of Licentiate of the [[University of Mumbai|University of Bombay]] in 1864.&lt;ref name="Konkani1"/&gt; He moved to London in 1867 to obtain his degree and in the same year, obtained the diplomas of [[Conjoint|L.R.C.P.]] Lond. and [[Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons|M.R.C.S]] Eng.&lt;ref name="Arpora"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Konkani1"/&gt; Cunha specialised in [[obstetrics]] at [[Edinburgh]] and London.&lt;ref name="Vaz1"/&gt; He returned to Bombay in 1868, where he soon acquired a large practice.&lt;ref name="Arpora"/&gt;

==Works==
Cunha wrote several papers on obstetrics which attracted much attention at the Medico-Physical Society of Bombay.&lt;ref name="Arpora"/&gt; After an epidemic of [[dengue]] in the city, he wrote an essay on dengue entitled ''Dengue: its history, symptoms and treatment''.&lt;ref name="Arpora"/&gt; Besides medicine, Cunha's interest spanned across diverse subjects such as history, [[archaeology]], [[linguistics]], [[numismatics]] and Sanskritology (study of [[Sanskrit]]).&lt;ref name="Konkani1"/&gt; He wrote and distinguished himself more by creating works of historical value on these subjects.&lt;ref name="Vaz2"/&gt; Besides papers, he was the author of 20 books on these subjects.&lt;ref name="Arpora"/&gt; His decision to write his works in English gained him greater recognition amongst English readers than those Goan authors who had chosen to write on these subjects only in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].&lt;ref name="Vaz2"/&gt;

===History===
Cunha wrote the first book on the history of Bombay, ''The Origin of Bombay'' which was published posthumously by the Bombay branch of the [[Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland|Royal Asiatic Society]] in 1900.&lt;ref name="cun"&gt;{{harvnb|Chatterjee|2003|loc=|Ref=sin}}&lt;/ref&gt; His other best known historical works include ''Memoir on the history of the tooth-relic of Ceylon''; with a preliminary essay on [[Gautama Buddha]] ''The life and system of Gautama Buddha'' (1875), ''Historical and Archeological Sketch of the Island of Angediva'' (1875), and ''The History and Antiquities of Chaul and Bassein'' (1876).

===Linguistics===
Cunha was inspired by the Portuguese civil servant [[Joaquim Heliodoro da Cunha Rivara]]'s efforts to revive [[Konkani language|Konkani]] in Goa.&lt;ref name="Konkani1"/&gt; In 1881, he wrote a scholarly work on the language entitled ''The Konkani Language and Literature'', wherein he discussed its origin and issues. Using the arguments of the [[Philosophy of language|Language theory]], he demonstrated that Konkani was an independent language in its own right with its own dialects, such as ''Kudali'', ''Goadesi'' and the Southern.&lt;ref name="Vaz2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Literature"&gt;{{harvnb|Das|1991|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sHklK65TKQ0C&amp;pg=PA139#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 139]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cunha concluded that while Konkani bears close similarities to [[Marathi language|Marathi]], it is quite distinct from, through cognate with Marathi and has a predominance of Sanskrit words and a faint Turanian or [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] element.&lt;ref name="Konkani2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kodialgar"&gt;{{harvnb|K. M. George (writer)|Akademi|1992|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=m1R2Pa3f7r0C&amp;pg=PA208#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 208]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It possesses an elaborate grammar of its own and a rich vocabulary which is derived from various sources (Sanskrit, [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Kannada language|Kannada]] and Portuguese, with all the contributing elements having lost their autonomy in the course of time and becoming so fused together that only a careful analysis can discover their [[etymology]].&lt;ref name="Konkani2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kodialgar"/&gt;

Cunha was greatly concerned with the increasing corruption of Konkani's purity, as he felt that the incorporation of Portuguese, Persian, Kannada and Marathi loanwards were distancing the language from its original source, Sanskrit.&lt;ref name="Konkani2"&gt;{{harvnb|Sardesai|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=1YILeUD_oZUC&amp;pg=PA97#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 97]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further had serious misgivings about the language's future. In ''The Konkani Language and Literature'', he states:&lt;ref name="Konkani3"&gt;{{harvnb|Sardesai|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=1YILeUD_oZUC&amp;pg=PA98#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 98]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=It is only an autonomous country that can preserve its language in a state of purity, and it is to its literature or rather to the learned men of that country is confided the task of rendering its forms classic and unalterable. But Goa has for centuries been swayed by foreign rulers who have insisted on making their own language the official language, or the language of the court, withdrawing, at the same time, all encouragement for the cultivation of the native tongue. Under these circumstances it is no wonder that Konkani has been treated with neglect by the very children of the soil, and has, from the absence of a norm to regulate its forms, dwindled into the state of a jargon, or ''[[patois]]''. Add to this internal disorganisation the power and vitality of the neighbouring tongues, and one need not be a prophet to foretell that in the course of a century or two, the Konkani language will be encroached upon by the Marathi from the North, and the Kanarese from the South, a movement that has already begun, when Konkani must succumb to the struggle. This has happened before; and it will happen again: for such is the fate of all weak tongues as also of weak peoples.}}

===Numismatics===
Cunha was an avid coin collector. He began collecting coins in 1876 and in addition to his own collection, purchased the collections of James Gibbs and Bhau Dhaji.&lt;ref name="Vaz2"/&gt; By  1888, his personal collection had expanded to include over 27,000 pieces of Gold, Silver and other baser metals.&lt;ref name="Vaz2"/&gt; The collection of coins catalogued by Cunha was generally believed to be among the best in the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref name="Arpora"/&gt; This catalogue was published in Bombay in 1888.&lt;ref name="Vaz2"/&gt; He wrote a book on numismatics, ''Indo-Portuguese Numismatics'' which was published in 1956 by ''Agencia Geral do Ultramar'' in [[Lisbon]]. This work is generally believed to be one of the few valuable studies in this field.&lt;ref name="Vaz2"/&gt;

==Associations==
In view of his work, Cunha acquired significant fame as an Orientalist and was invited to International seminars and conferences.&lt;ref name="Konkani1"/&gt; In addition to his affiliation with various medical associations in Bombay, his prolific contributions to Indian history and linguistics earned him the fellowship of the ''Instituto Vasco da Gama'' in Goa in 1871, and of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bombay in 1873.&lt;ref name="Vaz2"/&gt; He received a price at the Congress of Orientalists in [[Florence]] in 1877, and was a prominent figure at the Twelfth Congress held in Rome in 1899.&lt;ref name="Arpora"/&gt; In the latter conference, Cunha was hailed by the [[Angelo de Gubernatis|Count Angelo de Gubernatis]] as the "leading Orientalist of the day".&lt;ref name="Vaz2"/&gt; He served as the President of the Bombay chapters of the Royal Asiatic Society and the Anthropological Society.&lt;ref name="Arpora"/&gt; He was a Knight of the [[Order of the Crown of Italy]], of the [[Order of St. Gregory the Great]], and of the [[Order of Saint James of the Sword]].&lt;ref name="Arpora"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Cunha was married to Ana Rita da Gama, daughter of António José da Gama, knight of the [[Order of the Immaculate Conception of Vila Viçosa]], by decree of 5 September 1861, retired chief surgeon of Goa.&lt;ref name="Cunha Rivara"&gt;{{harvnb|da Cunha Rivara|Borges|da Cunha Soares|1996|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vnKEgXtNHt0C&amp;pg=PA284#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 284]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had three children; which included two daughters and one son. The eminent lawyer, jurist and orientalist [[Luís da Cunha Gonçalves]] (1875–1956) was a nephew of Cunha, through his sister Leocádia Maria Francisca.&lt;ref name="Cunha Rivara"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cunha Gonçalves1"&gt;{{harvnb|Derrett|1976|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=yH8eAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA472#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 472]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a [[Polyglot (person)|hyperpolyglot]], possessing knowledge of Konkani, Marathi, Portuguese, Italian, French, English, German, [[Middle Persian|Pahlavi]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Latin]] and Sanskrit.&lt;ref name="Vaz2"&gt;{{harvnb|Vaz|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7DJLxYBYA-YC&amp;pg=PA119#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 119]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kurds in Iraq''' ({{lang-ku| کوردانی باشووری کوردستان / کوردانی عێڕاق}}) are people born in or residing in [[Iraq]] who are of [[Kurds|Kurdish]] origin. The Kurds are the largest ethnic minority in Iraq, comprising between 15% and 20% of the country's population according to the [[The World Factbook|CIA World Factbook]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/iz.html#People |title=Iraq |publisher=[[The World Factbook]] |year=  |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kurdish people within Iraq have grappled with various political statuses over their history. Once assumed to receive full independence via the [[Treaty of Sèvres]], Iraqi Kurds have experienced a recent and troubled history of betrayal, oppression, and genocide.&lt;ref name="gunter2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunter|first=Michael|title=The Kurds Ascending|year=2008|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|location=New York|isbn=978-0-230-60370-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s regime in 2003, Iraqi Kurds, now governed by the [[Kurdistan Regional Government]] (KRG), face a crossroads in the political trajectory of Iraqi Kurdistan.&lt;ref name="gunter2008"/&gt; Factors that play into their future include Kurdish diversity and factions, Kurdish relationships with the [[United States]], Iraq's central government, and neighboring countries, previous political agreements, disputed territories, and Kurdish [[ethnonationalism]].

==Background==
The Kurdish people are an ethnic group whose origins are in the [[Middle East]]. They are one of the largest ethnic groups in the world that do not have a state of their own.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aziz|first=Mahir|title=The Kurds of Iraq|year=2011|publisher=I.B. Tauris|location=London|isbn=978-1-84885-546-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This geo-cultural region means "Land of the Kurds". [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] is an autonomous region in northern Iraq, covering {{convert|40643|sqkm}} and has a population of approximately 5.8 million people. Kurdish populations occupy the territory in and around the [[Zagros mountains]]. These arid unwelcoming mountains have been a geographic buffer to cultural and political dominance from neighboring empires.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2011"/&gt; [[Persia]]ns, [[Arabs]], and [[Ottomans]] were kept away, and a space was carved out to develop Kurdish culture, language, and identity.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2011"/&gt;

===Pre-1991===
According to [[Michael M. Gunter]], the Kurds are thought by some scholars to be the descendants of various Indo-European tribes that arrived the region about 4,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="gunter3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunter|first=Michael|title=The Kurds Ascending|year=2008|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|location=New York|isbn=978-0-230-60370-7|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arabs applied the name "Kurds" to the people of the mountains after they had conquered and Islamicized the region.&lt;ref name="gunter3"/&gt; In the 1500s most Kurds fell under Ottoman Rule. Iraqi Kurds developed as a subgroup of the Kurdish peoples when [[Great Britain]] created the state of Iraq out of the [[Sykes–Picot Agreement]] of [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunter|first=Michael|title=The Kurds Ascending|year=2008|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|location=New York|isbn=978-0-230-60370-7|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kurdish people were expecting to soon gain independence from what they were promised in the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] in 1920, but this was quickly overturned in 1923, when the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] established the [[Republic of Turkey]] over Kurdistan's borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunter|first=Michael|title=The Kurds Ascending|year=2008|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|location=New York|isbn=978-0-230-60370-7|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kurdish Democratic Party]] (KDP) was founded in 1946 by [[Mulla Mustafa Barzani]] and pushed for Kurdish autonomy under the Iraqi government.&lt;ref name="gunter13"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunter|first=Michael|title=The Kurds Ascending|year=2008|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|location=New York|isbn=978-0-230-60370-7|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, another political party emerged in Iraqi Kurdistan, led by [[Jalal Talabani]]—the [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan]] (PUK).&lt;ref name="gunter13"/&gt; Since the PUK was established, it lacked cooperation and engaged in violent conflict with the KDP over differing philosophies, demographics, and goals.&lt;ref name="gunter14"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunter|first=Michael|title=The Kurds Ascending|year=2008|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|location=New York|isbn=978-0-230-60370-7|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1991–present===
After the [[Gulf War]] and unsuccessful Kurdish uprising in 1991, Kurds fled back to the mountains to seek refuge from the Hussein regime.&lt;ref name="gunter14"/&gt; The United States established a safe-haven and [[no fly zone]] initiative in Iraqi Kurdistan for the Kurds in order for them to develop an asylum away from the Hussein regime.&lt;ref name="gunter14"/&gt; [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 688]] in 1991 condemned and forbade "the repression of the Iraqi civilian population... in Kurdish populated areas."&lt;ref name="gunter14"/&gt; After many bloody encounters, an uneasy balance of power was reached between the Iraqi forces and Kurdish troops, ultimately allowing Iraqi Kurdistan to function independently. The region continued to be ruled by the KDP and PUK and began to establish a stable economy and national identity. Iraqi Kurdistan built a socioeconomic infrastructure from scratch, completely independent from the centralized framework for the [[Ba'athist Iraq|Baath]] regime.&lt;ref name="bengio2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bengio|first=Ofra|title=Iraqi Kurds: Hour of Power?|journal=Middle East Quarterly|date=Summer 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though civil war broke out in the north between Barzani's Kurdistan Democratic Party and Talabani's Patrioutic Union of Kurdistan from 1994 to 1998, Kurds were still able to maintain a democratic and prosperous foundation for their region.&lt;ref name="gunter2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gunter|first=Michael|author2=Denise Natali |author3=Robert Olson |author4=Nihat Ali Ozcan |author5=Khaled Salih |author6=M. Hakan Yavuz |title=The Kurds in Iraq|journal=Middle East Policy|date=March 2004|volume=11|number=1|doi=10.1111/j.1061-1924.2004.00145.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the US invaded to oust the Hussein regime in 2003, the northern Kurdish border with Iraqi central state was moved considerably southward.&lt;ref name="gunter2004"/&gt; This gave Kurds more access to water and oil resources, therefore increasing priorities within the region to establish steady relations with the Kurds.&lt;ref name="gunter2004"/&gt; This new access also encouraged more investment within the region, softening political tensions and polarization.&lt;ref name="gunter2004"/&gt;

==Culture and diversity==

===Religion===
[[File:YezidiTemple.JPG|thumb|Yezidi Temple]]
Before the spread of [[Islam]], many Kurds were followers of [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Mithraism]], or local [[pagan]] beliefs. Kurds were assimilating these religious practices into their cultural domain as early as 800 BCE. [[Arab conquests]], however, began in the seventh century AD, eventually overpowering Kurdish resistance.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2011"/&gt; Over time, [[Sunni Islam]] became the dominant religion of the Kurdish people, following the [[Shafi]] school. There is a minority [[Shia]] population, 99% of the [[Fayli]] Kurds and 99% of shabak kurds Muslim is shia, who live in central and south eastern Iraq.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2011"/&gt; Though Islam is thought to be a religion of governance as well as spirituality, Kurds made sure to keep spiritual identity separate from national identity.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2011"/&gt; Today, many Muslim Kurds do not consider themselves particularly religious when it comes to adhering to the call to prayer five times a day, but secondary practices of Islam have a stronghold in Kurdish culture.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2011"/&gt; Following Islamic food restrictions, refraining from the consumption of alcohol, circumcising male newborns, and wearing a veil are all very popular customs among Kurds.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2011"/&gt;

A minority of Kurds, primarily in the [[Nineveh Province]] of Iraq, follow the [[Yazidism]]. Yazidism combines complex Kurdish cultural beliefs with [[Zoroastrianism]] and Islamic [[Sufi]] doctrine. It applies traditions of the Abrahamic religions such as the story of [[Adam and Eve]], the importance of [[pilgrimage]], and daily prayer ritual, to more mystical elements, focusing on the importance of [[ancestry]] and the [[Classical elements|four elements]] on the Earth. The religion is practiced in the Kurdish dialect of northern Iraqi Kurdistan, Kirmaji. Most Yazidi traditions are transmitted orally rather than through written text, making it difficult to source many Yazidi origins.

===Language===
Language has been foundational to the building of a [[national identity]] in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]], for the vast majority of Kurdish peoples speak [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]. Kurdish belongs to the Iranian language group and is rooted in the [[Indo-European family of languages]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2011"/&gt; [[Sorani]] and [[Kirmanji]] are the main two Kurdish [[dialects]], so internal language factions are not common.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2011"/&gt; Kirmanji was the favored dialect up until the World Wars, but by the 1960s Sorani became the dominant dialect among Iranian and Iraqi Kurds.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2011"/&gt; A problem among Kurdish people is that they do not have a unified script for their language. Iranian and Iraqi Kurds have modified the [[Perso-Arabic alphabet]], and [[Turkish Kurds]] use a Latinized alphabet.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2011"/&gt; This creates unity within modern political borders but strains relations and effective communications transnationally. This lack of unity in scripture parallels Kurdish cultural history, for isolated Kurdish mountain tribes were often [[nomadic]] and therefore had a very limited written tradition.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2011"/&gt;

After political changes in Iraq in the 1990s, however, Kurdish was increasingly used in the regional administration and education system, given their greater autonomy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2011"/&gt;

===Political parties===
[[File:KDP logo.svg|thumb|PDK Kurdistan]]
[[File:KDP and PUK controlled areas of Kurdistan.png|thumb|KDP and PUK-controlled areas of Kurdistan]]
A major weakness of Kurdish national cohesiveness has been the strength of tribal and regional factions, often resulting in strong breaks between [[political parties]].&lt;ref name="bengio2003"/&gt; The [[Kurdistan Democratic Party]] (KDP), founded by [[Masoud Barzani]], leans toward conservative nationalism and has a strong presence in the north.&lt;ref name="bengio2003"/&gt; Given their geographic location, they have historically relied on [[Turkey]] for international leverage. [[Jalal Talabani]]'s [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan]] (PUK) has aligned itself with [[Marxist]] ideals during their liberation struggle and has a stronghold in the southern Iraqi Kurdistan.&lt;ref name="bengio2003"/&gt; They have tended to seek support from [[Iran]] and [[Syria]]. Throughout the 1990s a continuous power struggle ensued over political representation in parliament and oil revenues, resulting in an armed conflict in 1994.&lt;ref name="bengio2003"/&gt; Fighting again broke out in 1996, when the KDP looked for assistance from the central Iraqi government and the PUK sought out support for the United States. This clash divided the two rival zones into "Barzanistan" and "Talabanistan", establishing two administrations, cabinets, parliaments, and state flags.&lt;ref name="bengio2003"/&gt; Political party infighting ruined a chance for the Kurdish peoples to unify and establish an autonomous state, completely separate from the Iraqi central government.&lt;ref name="bengio2003"/&gt; Within a factionalized atmosphere, other groups established a presence, such as the Turkey-based [[Kurdistan Workers Party]] (PKK), radical Islamist groups, and other Turkish political groups. The PKK has been a major radical party seeking state autonomy and cultural, linguistic, and ethnic rights in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunter|first=Michael|title=The Kurds Ascending|year=2008|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|location=New York|isbn=978-0-230-60370-7|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurdish leaders in Iraq have pushed for the prosperity of divided local governments rather than an independent state; this is because leadership is derived from tribal legitimacy, rather than political institutions. Talabani and Barzani, for instance, did not come from the most populous Kurdish tribe, but rather from well-organized tribes.&lt;ref name="gunter2004"/&gt; This could be an inhibitor to democracy in the region since those trying to preserve the status quo hold power but do not represent the majority.&lt;ref name="gunter2004"/&gt;

From 1986 to the present, Turkey has held different alliances with the KDP and PUK parties of Iraqi Kurdistan. Turkey has protected and armed the KDP from the PKK and PUK. They have also attacked these political parties, but held relations with the KDP, partially for access to cheap [[Iraqi oil]].&lt;ref name="gunter2004"/&gt; The KDP holds the representation of tribes along the Turkish border, so favorable relations with them ensures trading for Iraqi goods.&lt;ref name="gunter2004"/&gt; Turkey then shifted its relationships to favor the PUK party. Since this party sat in the southern region of northern Iraq, it had stronger relations with the central Iraqi government.&lt;ref name="gunter2004"/&gt;

==National identity==
Throughout the 1990s, when Kurds were given regional control after the [[Gulf War]] and a [[no-fly zone]] was established, a stronger Kurdish identity began to form.&lt;ref name="bengio2003" /&gt; This has stemmed from increased international support and the pull-out of the Iraqi central government from Iraqi Kurdistan.&lt;ref name="bengio2003" /&gt; The Kurdish language crossed over into the public sphere, taught and spoken in schools, universities, the adminitation, and the media. There has also been an influx of national symbols, including the [[Kurdish flag]], a Kurdish hymn, and public recognition of the Kurdish people.&lt;ref name="bengio2003" /&gt;

Development of Kurdish instrastructure has also become an integral aspect of their successful autonomy.&lt;ref name="bengio2003" /&gt; Previously dependent on the socioeconomic instrastucure of Baghdad, Kurds were able to efficiently build up their region, physically and politically, from scratch.&lt;ref name="bengio2003" /&gt; They built a fully functioning independent government autonomous from the [[Ba'athist Iraq|Baath]] regime. They were able to manage local governments, establish free and active Kurdish political parties, and institutionalze a Kurdish [[parliament]].&lt;ref name="bengio2003" /&gt; With these developments, the de facto Kurdish government gained recognition for the first time in the international sphere. They have quasi-official representation in [[Turkey]], [[Iran]], [[France]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="bengio2003" /&gt;

Though Kurdish people had success forming a national identity, there have been factors that have stunted its growth. Under the state of Iraq, Kurds were subjugated to the [[nationalism]] process for all Iraqis, given the arbitrary state lines.&lt;ref name="gunter2004" /&gt; Kurds were starting to think of themselves as [[Iraqis]], rather than focus on their collective development as Kurds. Nationalism was also hindered by divisions of tribes, languages, and geography that prevented the Kurdish people from identifying completely as one unit.&lt;ref name="gunter2004" /&gt; No leader has yet to rise above this tribal status and the infighting hurts those fighting for Kurdish autonomy because they are divided by other factions or political boundaries.&lt;ref name="gunter2004" /&gt; For example, during the [[Iran–Iraq War]], from 1980 to 1988, Turkey supported one Iraqi Kurdish group over another in order to play the Iraqi Kurds off against Turkey's own rebellious Kurds.&lt;ref name="gunter2004" /&gt;

Technology and [[telecommunications]] have helped Kurds to establish an ethno-national group, or self-defined national identity. Though this has developed a sense of pride and definition across political boundaries, it reveals a less promising scenario of Kurdish statehood.&lt;ref name="gunter2004" /&gt; It has disclosed disparities across countries about which Kurdish populations are gaining international support and relief. For Iraqi Kurds, this international network was established after the Gulf War of 1991. They had new forms of financial and political support as well as the resources and the legal geographic space to advance their nationalist agenda. This access allowed Kurdish language publications, texts, educational programs, and cultural organizations to flourish—benefits that Kurds only were experiencing within the state of Iraq and in European academic institutions.&lt;ref name="gunter2004" /&gt; Transnational social and cultural networks for Kurds were still tied to characteristics of certain states.&lt;ref name="gunter2004" /&gt;

==Autonomy==
With a Kurdish diaspora, legitimizing a Kurdish state is even more unlikely. Many Turkish Kurds have migrated outside of their historic homeland in the southeast of Turkey, westward for more prosperous lives.&lt;ref name="gunter2004"/&gt; Turkish Kurds have also come to an agreement with the Turkish government. Since the capture of their leader [[Abdullah Ocalan]] in 1999, Kurds have limited their activism to fighting for cultural, social and educational rights within the state of Turkey.&lt;ref name="gunter2004"/&gt; Due to Turkey's pending [[European Union|EU]] application, Turkey has been moving to grant these rights. With this improved relationship, Turkish Kurds have accepted their place within the Turkish state. This is just one instance of how Kurds are focusing on improving their livelihood within already established state lines rather than pushing for a restructuring of political borders in the Middle East. Though Iraqi Kurds have the greatest opportunity to push for autonomy because of the Iraqi state's government restructuring, Kurds in neighboring countries do not have the leverage to push for the independence that would threaten pre existing states.&lt;ref name="gunter2004"/&gt;

Even at a cross-roads for the political future of Iraqi Kurds, [[Barzani Kurds|Barzani]] and [[Talabani]] have both opted for establishing a [[federalist]] system within post-Saddam Iraq in order to insure the future wellbeing of the Kurdish people.&lt;ref name="gunter2004"/&gt;

On 1 July 2014, Massud Barzani announced that "Iraq's Kurds will hold an independence referendum within months." After previously opposing the independence for Iraqi Kurdistan, Turkey has later given signs that it could recognize an independent Kurdish state. On 11 July 2014 KRG forces seized control of the Bai Hassan and Kirkuk oilfields, prompting a condemnation from Baghdad and a threat of "dire consequences," if the oilfields were not relinquished back to Iraq's control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/inside-story/articles/2014/7/15/what-would-be-theregionalimplicationsofanindependentiraqikurdist.html |title=Kurds in Iraq to make their strongest push for independence yet &amp;#124; Al Jazeera America |publisher=America.aljazeera.com |date=2014-07-15 |accessdate=2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iraqi Kurds after the US-led Invasion of 2003==
The US invaded Iraq in order to take down [[Saddam Hussein]]'s regime and dissolve any threats of [[weapons of mass destruction]].Although after invasion, no evidence of mass destruction weapons has been found to prove US claim. After the fall of the regime, the United States government, with the help of ethnic leaders had to confront three issues: the nature of the future Iraqi government, how [[Shia]] representation was to be achieved in the government, and how Sunni re-enfranchisement was to be managed.&lt;ref name="bartu2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bartu|first=Peter|title=Wrestling With the Integrity of A Nation: The Disputed Internal Boundaries in Iraq|journal=International Affairs|year=2010|volume=86|series=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different opinions emerged on whether the Iraqi government should be [[centralized]] or not, how the US should respond to civil conflict between the Arabs and Kurds, and how previous promises to the Kurdish and Iraqi people would be achieved in a future state.&lt;ref name="gunter2004"/&gt;

[[File:Flickr - The U.S. Army - 1st 'Panthers' Battalion prepares to replace 'Warriors,' assume mission in east Rashid.jpg|thumb|Flickr - The U.S. Army - 1st 'Panthers' Battalion prepares to replace 'Warriors,' assume mission in east Rashid]]
Kurdish people have played an important role in Iraqi state building since the United States invaded in 2003. Many Kurds seek to build an autonomous federal state in the post-Huessein era, however, a solution for Kurdish problems in Iraq was not even mentioned in the 2004 UN resolution that established Iraq's interim government.&lt;ref name="gunter2004"/&gt;

===Article 140===
Article 140 of the 2005 Iraqi constitution vowed to place disputed areas under the jurisdiction of the [[Kurdistan Regional Government]] (KRG) by the end of 2007.&lt;ref name="bartu2010"/&gt; The three phases that were going to aid this process were [[normalization (sociology)|normalization]], [[census]], and [[referendum]]. The normalization phase was supposed to undo the 'Arabization' policies Kurds faced from 1968 to 2003 that were designed to alter the demographic in the city of [[Kirkuk]] and other disputed areas to favor the Arab population.&lt;ref name="bartu2010"/&gt; These policies included [[deportation]], displacement, house demolition, and property confiscation.&lt;ref name="bartu2010"/&gt; Institutionalized boundaries as a result of past [[gerrymandering]] were also to be reversed. After this normalization process, a census would talk place and the populous would choose to be governed by either the KRG or Baghdad.&lt;ref name="bartu2010"/&gt;

Article 140 was not implemented by 2007. At this time the Presidency Council also recommended to reattach all previously detached districts of Kirkuk.&lt;ref name="bartu2010"/&gt; The Chemchamal and [[Kalar, Iraq|Kalar]] districts that were allocated to [[Suleimaniya]] governorate in 1976 were to be retrnutned to Kirkuk.&lt;ref name="bartu2010"/&gt; [[Kifri]], annexed to [[Diyala Province|Diyala]] governorate in 1976 was to be rettached, although it has been under Kurdish control since 1991. Lastly, the [[Tuz Khormato|Tuz]] district would be rettached from the Salah ad-Din district. In 2008, the 140 Committee announced inaction on these initiatives.&lt;ref name="bartu2010"/&gt;

In 2008, the Iraqi, Kurdish and US governments came to the consensus that these types of reparations to the Kurdish people would not be able to be carried out without further negotiations and political agreements on boundaries.&lt;ref name="bartu2010"/&gt;

===Disputed territories===
{{main|Disputed Kurdish-Iraqi areas}}
[[File:Kurdish flags at the pro-Kurdistan referendum and pro-Kurdistan independence rally at Franso Hariri Stadiu, Erbil, Kurdistan Region of Iraq 11.jpg|thumb|Pro-independence rally in [[Erbil]] in September 2017]]
Disputed internal boundaries have been a core concern for Arabs and Kurds, especially since US invasion and political restructuring in 2003. Kurds gained territory to the south of Iraqi Kurdistan after the US-led invasion in 2003 to regain what land they considered historically theirs.&lt;ref name="bartu2010"/&gt;

One of the major problems in trying to implement Article 140 was a discrepancy in the definition of 'disputed area'.&lt;ref name="bartu2010"/&gt; The article only refers to regions that would go through this normalization process as "Kirkuk and other disputed area".&lt;ref name="bartu2010"/&gt; In 2003 Kursdish negotiator Mahmud Othman suggested that Kurdish majority areas below the Green line be attached to the KRG immediately, and 'mixed areas' should be questioned on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref name="bartu2010"/&gt; Sunnis felt as if Kurds should gain no additional land as a result of the US invasion.&lt;ref name="bartu2010"/&gt; Reattaching Kirkuk districts to reflect the 1975 boundaries posed many problems to Iraqis and brought along [[unintended consequences]].&lt;ref name="bartu2010"/&gt;

===Additional political problems===
The US government faced many problems trying to implement Article 140. This was not an ideal form of reparation for many Kurds. After being displaced, many formerly Kurdish regions lacked in development and agricultural upkeep.&lt;ref name="bartu2010"/&gt; Educational and economic opportunities were often greater for Kurds outside of these disputed territories, so many people did not want to be forced to return.&lt;ref name="bartu2010"/&gt;

===2014 Northern Iraq offensive===

During the [[Northern Iraq offensive (June 2014)|2014 Northern Iraq offensive]], Iraqi Kurdistan seized the city of [[Kirkuk]] and the surrounding area, as well as most of the disputed territories in Northern Iraq.

This is a partial '''list of 20th-century writers'''. This list includes notable artists, authors, philosophers, playwrights, poets, scientists and other important and noteworthy contributors to literature. Literature (from [[Latin]] ''litterae'' (plural); [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]]s) is the art of written works. Literally translated, the word ''literature'' means "acquaintance with letters" (as in the "[[arts and letters]]"). The two most basic written literary categories include [[fiction]] and [[non fiction]].

'''Léopold Genicot''' (Forville 18 March 1914 - Ottignies 11 May 1995) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] medieval [[historian]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Georges Duby]], [http://www.persee.fr/doc/rbph_0035-0818_1996_num_74_3_4131 Nécrologie: Léopold Genicot], ''Revue belge de philologie et d'histoire'' 74:3 (1996), pp.1075-1077&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

Léopold Genicot was born in Forville, [[Belgium]], in 1914. After earning his BA in [[Political economy|political economics]], he worked as an [[archivist]] for nine years in the [[Namur, Belgium|Namur]] branch of the Royal Archives from 1935 to 1944. During that time, he obtained a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[history]] in 1937. His work at the archives also allowed him to hide escaped prisoners during the [[World War II]].

In 1935, he was offered a position as professor at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834-1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]] and received a [[tenure]] there in 1947. He taught historical critics, [[methodology]], [[History of Belgium|Belgian history]] and [[Medievalism|Middle Age history]]. In his research, he was particularly interested in the [[Walloons|Walloon]] history ([[Wallonia]], Histoire de la Wallonie). He created and directed the Centre d'Histoire rurale et de l'Institut interfacultaire d'Etudes médiévales.

His contribution to the Middle-age history is well known, and his books and articles are used today in many medieval history classes ([http://www.hps.cam.ac.uk/research/srwhms.html], [http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~history/facdata/examreading/Medieval_History_3010.pdf]).

In 1972, for the Belgian scholarly press, Genicot directed "Brepols," a series of lengthy bibliographical essays/monographs, "Typologie des Sources du Moyen Age Occidental" to serve a scholarly base of [[Medieval studies|medievalists]] ranging from graduate students to professors. This series of books has been one of the most successful collections of introductory and bibliographical aids ever introduced to the academic community. By publishing three to four titles a year, the series has steadily grown to seventy-eight volumes, covering everything from necrological documents to Latin treatises on the virtues and vices, from [[astronomy]] to arms and armor. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/technology_and_culture/v041/41.1devries.html]

In 1964, he received the "Guaillarde d'Argent"[http://www.ville.namur.be/pericles/evenemen/wallonie01/08-2.htm]. In 1982, he received an honorary degree from the [[Catholic University of Lublin]] (KUL) [http://www.kul.lublin.pl/art_158.html]. In 1988, he received the prize "Personnalité Richelieu" [http://www.dmnet.be/richelieu/main/fr/pgstfr/persofr.html]

He was the father of the architectural historian Luc-Francis Genicot (1938-2007), and the great uncle of [[Garance Genicot]].

== A Militant ==

He was a strong advocate of [[Wallonia]] and the "Rénovation wallonne" and affiliated with the "[[Rassemblement wallon]]". Candidate to the European elections, his position on the Walloon problems became more radical over time. [http://www.wallonie-en-ligne.net/1995_Cent_Wallons/Genicot_Leopold.htm]

[[File:Jacques-Louis_David_019.jpg|thumb|300x300px|The French emperor [[Napoleon]] I crowns his empress. both wear royal mantle]]

A '''royal mantle''', or more simply a '''mantle''', is a garment normally worn by [[emperor]]s, [[king]]s or [[queen regnant|queen]]s as a symbol of authority. When worn at a coronation such mantles may be referred to as a '''coronation mantle'''. Many [[princes]] also wear such a mantle. Sometimes the mantles are worn only once, but in some instances they may be worn or used at other occasions such as during the opening of a session of the nation's legislature. Mantles also feature prominently in state portraiture and artwork featuring monarchs and princes.

Between the mantles of an [[emperor]] and king in principle there is no difference. Different countries have their own style and shape of the mantle has changed somewhat over the centuries. The oldest coats were not very long and they were not lined with [[fur]]. In the 18th century we see that cloaks become more like each other and appear everywhere in Europe.  The French example was lined with fur and a cloak with a long train became standard. Only the German emperors continued their short coat from the 12th century to the end of their empire.

The non crowned but inaugurated Dutch kings wear a robe on the French model. In the [[Netherlands]], one can not speak of a coronation mantle but use the term "royal robe." ({{lang-nl|Koningsmantel}} (Dutch phonetic: γoningsmant∂l).

'''Maspeth''' is a residential and commercial community in the [[Borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Queens]] in [[New York City]]. It was founded in the early 17th century by Dutch and English settlers. Neighborhoods sharing borders with Maspeth are [[Woodside, Queens|Woodside]] to the north; [[Sunnyside, Queens|Sunnyside]] to the northwest; [[Greenpoint, Brooklyn]] to the west; [[East Williamsburg, Brooklyn]] to the southwest; [[Fresh Pond, Queens|Fresh Pond]] and [[Ridgewood, Queens|Ridgewood]] to the south; and [[Middle Village, Queens|Middle Village]] and [[Elmhurst, Queens|Elmhurst]] to the east.

==History==

[[File:Maspeth creek from 49th Street end jeh.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A westward view at the Maspeth Creek|Maspeth Creek, looking west toward [[Newtown Creek]]]]

The name "Maspeth" is derived from the name of [[Mespeatches]] Indians, one of the 13 main Indian tribes that inhabited [[Long Island]]. It is translated to mean "at the bad waterplace" relating to the many stagnant swamps that existed in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.queensnewyork.com/maspeth/chamberof/history.html |title=History of Maspeth |work=queensnewyork.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area known today as Maspeth was chartered by [[New Netherlander]]s and [[British people|British]] settlers in the early 17th century. The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] had purchased land in the area known today as [[Queens]] in 1635, and within a few years began chartering towns. In 1642, they settled Maspat, under a charter granted to Rev. [[Francis Doughty (clergyman)|Francis Doughty]], making Maspeth the first English settlement in Queens;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyqueen2/Maspeth/ |title=Maspeth, Queens County, New York |work=rootsweb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the deed that was signed between the Native Americans and the settlers was the first one signed on Long Island. As part of the deed's signature, the "Newtown Patent" granted {{convert|13,000|acre|ha}} to settlers.&lt;ref name="maspeth commerce hist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maspethchamberofcommerce.org/maspeth.htm |title=History of Maspeth |work=Maspeth Chamber of Commerce |accessdate=May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conflicts with the Maspat tribe forced many settlers to move to what is now [[Elmhurst, Queens|Elmhurst]] in 1643.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nnp.org/vtour/regions/Long_Island/mespath.html | title=Maspeth&amp;nbsp;– A Tour of New Netherland | work=nnp.org | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608220530/http://www.nnp.org/vtour/regions/Long_Island/mespath.html | archivedate=June 8, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement was leveled the following year in an attack by Native Indians, and the surviving settlers returned to Manhattan.

In 1652, settlers ventured back to the area, settling an area slightly inland from the previous Maspat location.  This new area was called Middleburg, and eventually developed into what is now Elmhurst, bordering Maspeth.  Originally, 28 English [[Quakers]] had founded the village of Maspeth, which had sizable water and [[Milling (machining)|milling]] industries along [[Newtown Creek]] and [[Maspeth Creek]].&lt;ref name="maspeth commerce hist"/&gt; Two storekeepers, Nathanial Hazard and Francis T. White, sold food and clothes at the Maspeth Town Docks, at what is now 56th Terrace and Rust Street, by the late 18th century. After the [[American Revolutionary War]], villagers repaved roads with crushed [[oyster]] shells or [[Plank (wood)|wooden plank]]s.&lt;ref name="maspeth commerce hist"/&gt;

Columbusville was the name formerly applied to a section of Maspeth. It was a development of [[Edward Dunn (developer)|Edward Dunn]] that took place on 69th Place (originally known as Firth Avenue) between [[Grand Avenue (Queens)|Grand Avenue]] and Caldwell Avenue during 1854–55, and was subsequently absorbed into Maspeth. The name fell into disuse in the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite enc-nyc}}, p.26}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following waves of [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]] during the 19th century, Maspeth was home to a [[shanty town]] of [[Boyash]] (Ludar) [[Romani people|Gypsies]] between 1925 and 1939, though this was eventually bulldozed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smithsonianeducation.org/migrations/gyp/lud.html |title=The Ludar |work=smithsonianeducation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flushing Av under Bushw LIRR jeh.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Flushing Avenue runs in a cut under the Bushwick Branch|[[Flushing Avenue]] going below the Bushwick Branch]]

The area consisting of 43rd Street through 58th Street, including the former Furman Island, is industrial lowlands, and from 60th Street to 74th Street is residential.&lt;ref name="nyt 200805"/&gt; The [[Phelps Dodge Corporation]] was present from 1920 to 1983, during which matter from their premises contaminated [[Newtown Creek]], which separates northern Brooklyn from western Queens and serves barge traffic. In the 2000s, politicians started to make efforts to clean up the Newtown and Maspeth Creeks.&lt;ref name="nyt 200805"/&gt; [[Freight train]] traffic moves on the [[Long Island Rail Road]] [[Montauk Branch]] and the lightly-used [[Bushwick Branch]], both of which are used by the LIRR, [[New York and Atlantic Railway]], and [[Conrail]]; in addition, the LIRR [[Bay Ridge Branch]], a freight-only railway branch, separates the neighborhood from Elmhurst and Middle Village.&lt;ref name="fny"/&gt; A new West Maspeth rail freight station has been proposed in connection with a [[Cross-Harbor Rail Tunnel]] to diminish truck traffic across New York City. It is opposed by residents who do not want more trucks in Maspeth.&lt;ref name="amny 201503"/&gt;

The [[Elmhurst gas tanks]] were formerly located in the area and were demolished in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Memory-Filled Tanks; Queens Loses 2 Roadside Landmarks |author=Hevesi, Dennis |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEFD7123CF933A1575AC0A965958260 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 20, 1993 |accessdate=March 24, 2008 |quote="The Elmhurst tanks&amp;nbsp;— those 200-foot monoliths that stood sentinel to the changing landscape of Queens and as harbingers of hair-tearing delay on the highway to Manhattan&amp;nbsp;— are down, deflated forever, their skeletal remains waiting to be dismantled."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Maspeth gas tanks were also located in the area until they were demolished.&lt;ref name="fny"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forgotten-ny.com/2002/04/maspeth-queens/ |title=MASPETH, Queens |work=Forgotten NY |date=April 2002 |accessdate=May 7, 2015 |author=Walsh, Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Single and multi-family dwellings make up most of Maspeth as there are few apartment buildings, except for the Ridgewood Gardens [[Cooperative#Housing cooperative|co-ops]] along 65th Place. Houses in Maspeth range from 400–600 thousand dollars.&lt;ref name="amny 201503"/&gt; One particularly notable group of houses in the area is a cluster of 2- and 3-story orange and yellow brick buildings located between Grand Avenue, 79th Street, and Calamus Avenue; they were made for the Mathews Company and built in 1930 by Louis Allmendinger.&lt;ref name="fny"/&gt;

Much of the area's commerce is situated along [[Grand Avenue (Queens)|Grand Avenue]].&lt;ref name="nyt 200805"/&gt;

Cemeteries take up another large part of this small neighborhood, although they are separated from residential areas for the most part. The [[Mount Olivet Cemetery (Queens)|Mount Olivet Cemetery]], the largest cemetery in the neighborhood, is located on a high hill in Maspeth and used to be an outer-borough vacation site. Mount Olivet Cemetery was planned on March 26, 1850, when James Maurice held a meeting at his Maspeth house to discuss the formation of the cemetery. Notable interments in the cemetery include cosmetics magnate [[Helena Rubinstein|Helena Rubinstein Courielli]] and sixteen victims of the 1911 [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]].&lt;ref name="maspeth commerce hist"/&gt;

The neighborhood, which is nearly isolated by the industrial areas and [[cemetery|cemeteries]] surrounding it, is described by some residents as having a small-town feeling. It is bisected by the [[Long Island Expressway]] (locally known as the LIE), though the two parts of Maspeth are connected by several crossings across the expressway.&lt;ref name="amny 201503"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amny.com/real-estate/city-living/queens/city-living-maspeth-a-caring-community-in-queens-bordering-thriving-industrial-zone-1.10120487 |title=City Living: Maspeth is a caring community bordering a thriving industrial zone |work=AM New York |date=March 25, 2015 |accessdate=May 7, 2015 |author=Lisa Fraser}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many community organizations, which have, among other things, preserved the neighborhood's small-town-like character; for example, they blocked the construction of a [[Home Depot]] at the site of what is now the [[Elmhurst Park]].&lt;ref name="nyt 200805"/&gt;

==Communal locations==
The Maspeth Town Hall [[community center]] is located on 72nd Street.&lt;ref name="amny 201503" /&gt;  A [[one-room schoolhouse]] between 1897 and 1932, it was then occasionally used by a local girls' club and the [[Works Progress Administration]] until 1936. It was a [[New York City Police Department]] precinct until 1971. The building was renovated and made into a community center in 1972.&lt;ref name="jpca" /&gt;

[[File:Engine 291 HL 48 56-07 Metropolitan Ave jeh.jpg|thumb|left|Firehouse on Metropolitan Avenue]]

Other neighborhood institutions include the local Chamber of Commerce, the Lions Club, and the Maspeth Federal Savings Bank.&lt;ref name="amny 201503"/&gt;

==Parks and plazas==
A [[Memorials and services for the September 11 attacks|September 11 memorial]] has been erected at 69th Street and Grand Avenue to commemorate the local FDNY Squad 288 and HAZMAT 1 firehouse's [[Emergency workers killed in the September 11 attacks|casualties]] from the [[September 11 attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]], which were the largest of any [[FDNY]] unit.&lt;ref name="jpca"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.queensledger.com/view/full_story/3568416/article-Somber-9-11-Memorial-in-Maspeth-? |title=Somber 9/11 Memorial in Maspeth |author=Kayla Borg |date=October 9, 2009 |newspaper=Queens Ledger |accessdate=January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monument, adjacent to the LIE, faces the [[World Trade Center site]], where the [[One World Trade Center]] can be seen. An annual memorial ceremony is held at the monument on September 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.queensledger.com/view/full_story/15190554/article-9-11-memorial-in-Maspeth |title=9/11 Memorial in Maspeth |date=August 23, 2011 |newspaper=Queens Ledger |accessdate=January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Walk of Honor, unveiled on Memorial Day 2006, is also in the square, and honors activists and visionaries who lived in the area.&lt;ref name="maspeth commerce hist"/&gt;

Public parks, operated by the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]], include the Frontera Park at 69th Street and the LIE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/frontera-park |title=Frontera Park |work=NYC Parks |accessdate=May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Principe Park at Maurice and 54th Avenues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/frank-principe-park |title=Frank Principe Park |work=NYC Parks |accessdate=May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The smallest park in New York City, [[Luke J. Lang Square]], is located at the triangle caused by the intersection of Fresh Pond Road, 59th Road, and 61st Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/luke-j-lang-square|title=Luke J.

Maspeth is also home to the [[Metropolitan Oval]], a playing field for [[Association football|soccer]] players, which contains a view of the [[Manhattan]] skyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Best full soccer field in the middle of a residential neighborhood&amp;nbsp;–  METROPOLITAN OVAL |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/specials/bestof/2004/detail.php?id=4510 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050324175005/http://www.villagevoice.com/specials/bestof/2004/detail.php?id=4510 |archivedate=2005-03-24 |first=Michael |last=Malone |publisher=Village Voice |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Grand Avenue and the LIE, a plaque to "Horse Cars Rest Stop" exists. There used to be a horse cart barn at Brown Place, one block east of Grand Avenue.&lt;ref name="fny"/&gt; It is now Peter Charles Park, a small [[pocket park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/peter-charles-park/history |title=Peter Charles Park: History |work=NYC Parks |accessdate=May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the LIE was built in the 1950s, it also demolished many streets; the construction of the LIE left many small triangular plazas behind, such as at 57th Road and 73rd Place, where the "Quick Brown Fox Park", another pocket park, is located. The park is named after a story about a [[The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog|quick brown fox]].&lt;ref name="fny"/&gt;

However, by 2005, developers bought the church in order to demolish it, since the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] had refused to landmark the church. This was largely opposed; however, its facade was torn apart, disassembled, and stored at All Faiths Cemetery by 2008. Despite community effort, led by the [[Juniper Valley Park|Juniper Park]] Civic Association, to make a park on the site, by 2011, the church's former site had become warehouses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forgotten-ny.com/2007/07/fed-up-at-the-conditions-at-st-saviours-church-and-the-developers-and-politicians-that-want-it-gone/ |title=ST.

The Ridgewood Gardens [[Apartment building|apartment]]/[[co-op]] complex, on a hill known as the Ridgewood Plateau,&lt;ref name="qc 200701"&gt;[http://queenscrap.blogspot.com/2007/01/coming-soon-another-house-too-narrow.html "Coming Soon: Another House Too Narrow"], ''Queens Crap'' (January 31, 2007). Accessed May 8, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; was built on {{convert|72|acre|ha}} woods owned by James Maurice and donated to the Episcopal Church in 1850. Maurice Woods was bounded by Maurice Avenue, Jay Avenue, 66th Street, and Borden Avenue. 53rd Avenue went down a slope to 64th Street. The apartment complex was built later.&lt;ref name="fny"/&gt; It is notable for a [[step street]] that descends the hill, as well as for a very old, graffiti-covered [[lamppost]] on that street.&lt;ref name="qc 200701"/&gt;

James Maurice used to live at a home at 1 Hill Street. It was sold in 1909.&lt;ref name="jpca"/&gt;

The house where Anton Fausner’s wheelwright and wagonmaker’s shop was located is on Grand Avenue just south of the LIE. Later, an auto shop, Maspeth Auto Parts, was located in that building.

The Maspeth Theater, the neighborhood's largest theater in the 1920s, was built in 1924 at Grand Avenue and 69th Street by Straus and Strausberg, with 1,161 seats.

At Clinton Hall, a 1920s-built venue that had interior [[balcony|balconies]] and a large [[chandelier]], there is now a laboratory and industrial offices. It is named after a mansion built by Judge Joseph Sackett. Sackett had built a wood-framed mansion behind the hall; later, New York Governor [[DeWitt Clinton]] planned the [[Erie Canal]]. The lands of the Sackett-Clinton House, as the mansion was called, were turned into a park by 1910, and the mansion burned down in 1933.&lt;ref name="jpca"/&gt;

The Clinton Diner, at Maspeth and Maurice Avenues, was built in 1935 and is a [[truck stop]] that appeared in the movie ''[[Goodfellas]]'', as well as in other movies. The Queens Head Tavern, nearby, was an [[American Revolutionary War]]-era [[tavern]] and was used as a [[stagecoach]] stop later on.&lt;ref name="jpca"/&gt;

{{for|the Christian saint|Mucian}}
'''Gaius Licinius Mucianus''' (fl. 1st century AD) was a general, [[politician|statesman]] and writer of [[ancient Rome]]. He is considered to have played a role behind the scenes in the elevation of [[Vespasian]] to the throne.

== Life ==
His name shows that he had passed by adoption from the ''[[gens]] [[Mucia (gens)|Mucia]]'' to the ''[[Licinia (gens)|gens Licinia]]''.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Mucianus, Licinius|volume=18|page=954}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mucianus was sent by [[Claudius]] to [[Kingdom of Armenia (Antiquity)|Armenia]] with [[Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo]]. He was a suffect consul during the reign of [[Nero]], most likely during the years 63 or 64.&lt;ref&gt;See Judith B. Ginsberg, "Nero's consular policy", ''American Journal of Ancient History'', '''6''' (1981), p. 68 n. 55 for a discussion of the year of Mucianus' consulship.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the outbreak of the [[First Jewish–Roman War|Jewish revolt]] in 66 AD, Mucianus was serving as governor of [[Roman Syria|Syria]], a post he still held during the [[Year of Four Emperors]] (69);&lt;ref&gt;Werner Eck, "Jahres- und Provinzialfasten der senatorischen Statthalter von 69/70 bis 138/139", ''Chiron'', '''12''' (1982), pp. 284f, and n. 11&lt;/ref&gt; however, he failed to put down the Jewish revolt, and Vespasian was sent to replace him. After the death of [[Galba]], Mucianus and Vespasian (who was in [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]] at the time) both swore allegiance to [[Otho]], but when the civil war broke out, Mucianus persuaded Vespasian to take up arms against [[Vitellius]], who had seized the imperial throne.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

It was agreed that Vespasian should stay behind to settle affairs in the East, while Mucianus made his way through [[Asia Minor]] and [[Thrace]] to attack Vitellius.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; On his way there, he defeated a Dacian invasion of [[Moesia]]. Mucianus reached Rome the day after the death of Vitellius, finding [[Domitian]], Vespasian's son, at head of affairs, but until the arrival of Vespasian the real master of Rome was Mucianus.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Mucianus never wavered in his allegiance to Vespasian, whose favor he retained in spite of his arrogance.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; He is mentioned in the records of the [[Arval Brethren]] in the year 70; Mucianus may have been admitted following Vespasian's entrance to Rome, although [[Ronald Syme]] admits that he may have been co-opted ''in absentia'' by Galba.&lt;ref&gt;Syme, ''Some Arval Brethren'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1980), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed consul (suffect) for the third time in 72.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gallivan, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/638472 "The Fasti for A.D. 70–96"], ''[[Classical Quarterly]]'', '''31''' (1981), p. 188. The date of one of his three consulates, possibly the first, is unknown.&lt;/ref&gt; As no mention is made of Mucianus during the reigns of [[Titus]] or Domitian, he probably died during the reign of Vespasian;&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Syme believes his death happened before 78.&lt;ref&gt;Syme, ''Some Arval Brethren'', p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writings ==
A clever writer and historian, Mucianus collected the speeches and letters of Romans of the older [[Roman Republic|republican]] period, probably including a [[text corpus|corpus]] of proceedings of the Senate&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; (''res gesta senatus''). He was also the author of a memoir, chiefly dealing with the natural history and geography of the East, a text often quoted by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; as the source of miraculous occurrences.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite book|author=George Williamson |chapter=Mucianus and a Touch of the Miraculous: Pilgrimage and Tourism in Roman Asia Minor |editors=[[Jas Elsner|Jaś Elsner]] and Ian Rutherford |title=Pilgrimage in Graeco-Roman and Early Christian Antiquity: Seeing the Gods |place=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Cyber Security Centre''' ('''NCSC''') is a government [[computer security]] organisation in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], an operational arm of the [[Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment]]. The NCSC was developed in 2013 and formally established by the [[Government of Ireland|Irish government]] in July 2015. It is responsible for Ireland's cyber security, with primary focus on securing government networks, protecting [[Critical infrastructure|critical national infrastructure]], and assisting businesses and citizens in protecting their own systems.&lt;ref name="cyber 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Cyber Security Strategy 2015-2017|url=http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/NR/rdonlyres/80C30B53-336F-45EF-9BDE-63F02A0E88C4/0/NationalCyberSecurityStrategy20152017.pdf|publisher=Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources|accessdate=7 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714150335/http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/NR/rdonlyres/80C30B53-336F-45EF-9BDE-63F02A0E88C4/0/NationalCyberSecurityStrategy20152017.pdf|archivedate=14 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCSC incorporates the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT-IE).

The NCSC is headquartered at 29/31 Adelaide Road, [[Dublin]] 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Cyber Security Centre|url=https://www.ripe.net/membership/indices/data/ie.ncsc-ie.html|publisher=Réseaux IP Européens Network Coordination Centre (RIPE NCC)|accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mandate and organisation==
The mandate for the NCSC includes; 
* activities to reduce the vulnerability of critical systems and networks within the state to incidents and [[cyber-attack]]s;
* effective response when such attacks occur;
* responsibility for the [[Critical infrastructure protection|protection of critical information infrastructure]];
* establishing and maintaining cooperative relationships with national and international partners.&lt;ref name="cyber 1"/&gt;

Threats identified to Ireland's critical infrastructure and government networks include: lone individuals, activist groups, criminal groups, terrorist groups, and nation states seeking to gather intelligence or to damage or degrade infrastructure. Incidents arising through extreme weather, human error and hardware or software failure also pose significant risks to individuals, businesses and public administration.&lt;ref name="cyber 1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cullen|first1=Adam|title=Cyber-crime gangs with global threat detected within Ireland|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/news/cybercrime-gangs-with-global-threat-detected-within-ireland-31093475.html|accessdate=8 July 2015|publisher=Irish Independent|date=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work relating to the National Cyber Security Centre, and any records associated with the security of [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] systems in the state and outside it, are exempt from being disclosed under [[Freedom of information laws by country#Ireland|freedom of information]] (FOI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wall|first1=Martin|last2=Duncan|first2=Pamela|title=State ‘vulnerable’ to cyber attacks if security documents exposed, official said|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/technology/state-vulnerable-to-cyber-attacks-if-security-documents-exposed-official-said-1.1718469|accessdate=8 July 2015|publisher=The Irish Times|date=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT-IE)===
The '''Computer Security Incident Response Team''' ('''CSIRT-IE''') was established in late 2011 (prior to the official formation of the NCSC) within the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, and includes secondees from other government agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cybercrime Network Conference (CyNC) 2013, Closing speech by Alan Shatter TD Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence|url=http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/SP13000417|publisher=Dept of Justice and Equality|accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main role of CSIRT-IE is to provide a 24/7 expert [[Computer emergency response team|emergency response to computer security incidents]] across all public sector bodies, as well as providing advice to reduce threat exposure. CSIRT-IE engages in emergency planning with government agencies overseen by the [[Office of Emergency Planning (Ireland)|Office of Emergency Planning]] (OEP) within the [[Department of Defence (Ireland)|Department of Defence]] and the [[Office of Emergency Planning (Ireland)#Government Task Force on Emergency Planning|Government Task Force on Emergency Planning]], chaired by the [[Minister for Defence (Ireland)|Minister for Defence]]. CSIRT-IE shares information with the [[European Network and Information Security Agency|European Union Agency for Network and Information Security]] (ENISA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=National Cyber Security Strategy published|url=http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/Press+Releases/2015/National+Cyber+Security+Strategy+published.htm|accessdate=7 July 2015|publisher=DCENR|date=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outlining the future core aspects of work of the NCSC, the government's ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20150714150335/http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/NR/rdonlyres/80C30B53-336F-45EF-9BDE-63F02A0E88C4/0/NationalCyberSecurityStrategy20152017.pdf National Cyber Security Strategy 2015-2017]'' states that the NCSC is to seek formal international accreditation for a Government CSIRT (g/CSIRT), expected in 2016, and accreditation will be sought for a formal National CSIRT (n/CSIRT), while also developing a capacity in the area of [[Industrial control system|Industrial Control Systems]] and [[SCADA]], which are used to run vital state networks such as electricity, water and telecommunications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kennedy|first1=John|title=Ireland gears up for cyber war – new strategy to protect critical infrastructure|url=https://www.siliconrepublic.com/enterprise/2015/07/03/ireland-gears-up-for-cyber-war-new-strategy-to-protect-critical-infrastructure|accessdate=8 July 2015|publisher=Silicon Republic|date=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Cyber Security Strategy 2015-2017|url=http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/Communications/Business+and+Technology/Cyber+Security/National+Cyber+Security.htm|publisher=Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources Ireland|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inter-departmental cooperation==
[[File:Cis intel curragh offices,co.kildare.PNG|thumbnail|The Defence Forces [[Communications &amp; Information Services Corps|CIS Corps]] work closely with the NCSC]]
There is a strong culture of cooperation between the National Cyber Security Centre and the [[Defence Forces (Ireland)|Irish Defence Forces]] in areas regarding technical skill sets, technical information sharing and exercise participation. Arrangements are due to be formalised by means of a Service Level Agreement with the Department of Defence, including a mechanism for the immediate sharing of technical expertise and information in the event of a major national cyber incident or emergency. The branch of the Irish military with responsibility for cyber defence is the [[Communications &amp; Information Services Corps|Communications and Information Services Corps]] (CIS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Military ‘can help stop cyber attacks’|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/military-can-help-stop-cyber-attacks-313573.html|accessdate=8 July 2015|publisher=Irish Examiner|date=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Garda Síochána]], the national police service, is involved with the NCSC in a preventative and investigative capacity, with regards to [[national security]] and [[computer crime]]. Its liaison relationships with international security services is particularly helpful to the NCSC in identifying emerging threats and vulnerabilities, and establishing best practice preventative measures. There is to be a Memorandum of Understanding with the [[Department of Justice and Equality]] on this matter, and upcoming cyber legislation will support the work of the National Cyber Security Centre.&lt;ref name="cyber 1"/&gt;

There is also a Memorandum of Understanding with the [[Centre for Cybersecurity &amp; Cybercrime Investigation]] (CCI) at [[University College Dublin]], Europe's leading centre for research and education in cybersecurity, cybercrime and [[digital forensics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Centre for Cybersecurity &amp; Cybercrime Investigation, University College Dublin|url=http://www.ucd.ie/cci/|publisher=UCD|accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Gordon|title=Cyber security a safe bet for growth|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/technology/cyber-security-a-safe-bet-for-growth-1.1279774|accessdate=8 July 2015|publisher=The Irish Times|date=28 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 27 of the National Heritage Resources Act (NHRA) of [[South Africa]] provides for places of historic or cultural importance to be designated '''national heritage sites'''.&lt;ref&gt;National Heritage Resources Act, Act 25 of 1999, Government Notice 506, Republic of South Africa Government Gazette, Vol. 406, No 19974, Cape Town, 28 April 1999&lt;/ref&gt; This came into effect with the introduction of the Act on 1 April 2000, when all former national monuments declared by the former [[National Monuments Council (South Africa and Namibia)|National Monuments Council]] and its predecessors became [[Provincial heritage site (South Africa)|provincial heritage sites]] as provided for in Section 58 of the Act.&lt;ref&gt;National Heritage Resources Act, Act 25 of 1999, Government Notice 506, Republic of South Africa Government Gazette, Vol. 406, No 19974, Cape Town, 28 April 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Both national and provincial heritage sites are protected under the terms of Section 27 of the NHRA, and a permit is required to work on them.  National heritage sites are declared and administered by the national heritage resources authority, [[South African Heritage Resources Agency|SAHRA]];  provincial heritage sites fall within the domain of the various [[Provincial heritage resources authority|provincial heritage resources authorities]].

The SAHRA logo is used to mark national heritage sites.

'''Oiasso''',&lt;ref name="Ptolemy"&gt;[[Ptolemy]], 2, 6, 10&lt;/ref&gt; '''Oiasona'''&lt;ref name="Strabo"&gt;[[Strabo]], [[Geographia]] III, 4, 10. The [[Casaubonus]] editions of 1587 and 1620 write ''Oídasoûna'', corrected by [[Adolf Schulten]] to ''Oíasoûna''.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Oiarso'''&lt;ref name="Pliny"&gt;[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], 3, 29&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Vascones|Basque]] [[Hispania Tarraconensis|Roman]] town located on the left bank of the [[Bidasoa]] [[estuary]] in the [[Bay of Biscay]] (current [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]], in Spanish territory). Archaeological evidence unearthed recently pinpoints the core area of Oiasso in the old quarter of [[Irun]] ([[Gipuzkoa]]) by the Spanish-French border, where harbour and bath remains have been discovered. However, two other focuses in [[Cape Higuer]] and hermitage Ama Xantalen ([[necropolis]] and [[mausoleum]]) point to a wider complex outside the main nucleus.

Actually, some authors note that the name Oiasso may have applied to the whole valley, arguing that the very name of the Bidasoa River may stem from [[Latin]] "via ad Oiasso", eventually rendering ''[[Bidasoa]]'' in [[Basque language|Basque]]. Furthermore, it is widely assumed that the name for the town [[Oiartzun]] some 10&amp;nbsp;km away may have developed from '''Oiasso'''. A Roman road linked this spot to ancient [[Pamplona|Pompaelo]] all the way through the ''Saltus Vasconum'' (the [[Vascones|Vasconian]] wilderness), with the road being built to connect the Vasconian main town to the mines of ''Arditurri'' set in the massif of [[Aiako Harria]]. Romans showed an early interest on them on account of the ore (largely silver and copper) they could extract from them, using the port and factories of Oiasso to process and dispatch the freight away.

A museum was founded recently in [[Irun]] to cater for the interest the vestiges unveiled have aroused and for tourism. 

Earlier it was misidentified with current [[San Sebastián]], that is still nicknamed ''la bella Easo'' ("The beautiful Easo", a Hispanization of Oiasso).

'''Paul Fredericq''' (12 August 1850 – 23 March 1920) was a [[Belgian]] [[historian]] at [[Ghent University]] active in the promotion of the use of the [[Dutch language]] in Belgium.

==Early life==
Paul Fredericq was born in the Sleepstraat in [[Ghent]], [[Belgium]]. A student at the ''Koninklijk Atheneum'' of Ghent, where [[Max Rooses]] and [[Jacob Heremans]] influenced him. He became a [[Protestant]] in his youth and his tendencies in religion, as in politics, were liberal.&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; In 1871 he graduated as a high school teacher from the [[University of Liège]] and started working as a teacher in [[Mechelen]] and [[Arlon]]. In 1875, Fredericq received a special doctorate in historical sciences, with his study ''Essai sur le rôle politique et social des ducs de Bourgogne dans les Pays-Bas'', and he became professor of history at the University of Liège.&lt;ref name=eb/&gt;

==Academic career==
[[File:Paul Fredericq.gif|thumb|left|upright|Cover of Fredericq's history of the Flemish Movement]]
After Jacob Heremans became emeritus, Paul Fredericq became professor of history at [[Ghent University]] in 1883. His courses included Dutch literature and practical exercises about Belgian history. Characterizing his sociability: Fredericq also taught in the relaxed surroundings of his home. It was probably during this period that he befriended the students of the ''[['t zal wel gaan]]'' movement.

Fredericq was very active in the [[Liberalism|liberal]] wing of the [[Flemish Movement]]. During the period of 1891-95, he was a liberal member of the city council, and became president of the local ''[[Willemsfonds]]'' organization and editor in chief of the liberal magazine ''Het Volksbelang''. Then founded the ''Hooger Onderwijs voor het Volk'' ("higher education for the people") in 1894, an experiment to close the education-gap between the elite and the workforce. However, Fredericq was especially important during the struggle to include Dutch into the Belgian education system. His activism culminated with his ''Schets eener Geschiedenis der Vlaamsche Beweging'' (1906–09), a short history of the [[Flemish Movement]].

During [[World War I]], on the [[German invasion of Belgium|invasion of Belgium by the Germans]], Fredericq was active in encouraging the patriotic feelings of his countrymen in [[German occupation of Belgium during World War I|occupied Belgium]] and supporting non-violent resistance to the invader. As a result, he was deported to Germany on 16 March 1916, together with his colleague, the historian [[Henri Pirenne]]. He was interned successively at [[Gütersloh]], [[Jena]] and [[Bürgel]].&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{Cite EB1922|wstitle=Fredericq, Paul|last=Pirenne |first=Henri |authorlink=Henri Pirenne}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ordeal weakened him both physically and mentally.

After the war, he became rector at Ghent University in 1919. But quickly resigned after only a few weeks, disappointed by the anti-Flemish backlash. He died shortly afterwards in Ghent.

{{Spanish name|Mujica|Pinilla}}

'''Ramon Elias Mujica Pinilla''' is a [[Peru]]vian [[anthropologist]] and served under three Presidents as Director of the [[National Library of Peru]].

==Early life==
'''Ramon Mujica Pinilla''' is the son of Peruvian diplomat, founding publisher of [[:es:Expreso (Perú)|Expreso de Lima]] and collector Manuel Mujica Gallo and museum docent Marisa Pinilla Sánchez Concha, daughter of a Spanish Consul of Spain in Peru. He graduated from [[New College of Florida]] in [[Sarasota]], [[Florida]]. He did his postgraduate work at the [[National University of San Marcos]].

Se llama Ramon

==Career==
He has written  books on the  mystical intellectual sources of [[St. Rose of Lima]], the first saint of the Americas, and on the political dimensions of her [[French-based creole languages|Creole]] and Indian cult that prepared the ground for Peru's political Independence from Spain in 1821. ''Angeles Apocrifos en la America Virreinal'' includes an explanation for the late 17th century Andean ''sui generis'' [[baroque]] [[iconography]] of angels bearing musquets and [[Hebrew]] names. This angelic visionary iconography explained the Spanish Conquest of Peru in prophetic terms. It alluded to Inca [[Garcilaso de la Vega (chronicler)|Garcilaso de la Vega]]'s belief that the Spanish [[conquistador]]s were divine messengers with thunderclaps sent by the [[Inca]] god [[Viracocha]]. Mujica coordinated  the two volume set on "El Barroco Peruano" published by the Banco de Credito del Peru  and the collection of essays "Vision y Simbolos: del virreinato criollo a la Republica Peruana", that includes contributions  by [[David A. Brading]], [[Teresa Gisbert de Mesa]] and [[Natalia Majluf]], among others.

He is a numerary  member (miembro de numero) of the Peruvian Academia Nacional de Historia and a "miembro correspondiente"  from  the [[Academia Nacional de Bellas Artes]] in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]. He has been appointed to be a board member of the [[Instituto Cervantes]] in 2014 filling a seat vacated by [[Isabella Allende]].

'''Selim Matar''', writer, novelist and sociologist with Swiss and Iraqi nationalities, was born in Bagdad and resides currently in Geneva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rts.ch/video/emissions/archives/fax-culture/400942-paroles-irakiennes-n-oubliez-pas-bagdad.html |title=Paroles irakiennes : n'oubliez pas Bagdad ! - Fax Culture - TV - Play RTS - Radio Télévision Suisse |publisher=Rts.ch |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is founder of the movement known as “Identity of the Iraqi Nation”, chief editor of the trimestral journal Mesopotamie, as well as author of Woman of the Flask, a well known novel in the Arabic-speaking world.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Pasotti : TRINCEE, ACQUITRINI E DEDALI DI DESERTI: LA FIGURA DELLA TERRA IN “LA DONNA DELL’AMPOLLA” DI SELIM MATAR/ELABORATO FINALE DI/Matricola 711604/UNIVERSITA LEGLI  ATUDI DI MILANO/ FACOLTA’ DI LETTERE E FILOSOFIA – FACOLTA’ DI SCIENZE POLITICHE/CORSO DI LAUREA IN MEDIAZIONE LINGUSTICA E CULTURALE&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography==
Selim Matar was born in 1956 in a family that immigrated to Baghdad from the south of Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;autobiographic text from the journal Quatara, Paris: Mon pays éphémère/Salim Matar/Qantara: magazine des cultures arabe et méditerranéenne, ISSN 1148-2648, Nº. 85, 2012, págs. 72-73&lt;/ref&gt;  He becomes member of the Iraqi communist party and leaves his country at the end of 1978, after the failure of what is known as the “national confrontation” between the ruling party Baas and the communists. After three years of ceaseless wanderings in the Middle-East, he finally settles down in Geneva at the end of 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Interview avec Selim Matar, Journal Le Temps, Genève,19/02/2004/&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at the Graduate Institute of Development Studies, specializing in social sciences and research in the Third World.&lt;ref name="mesopot1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salim.mesopot.com/images/stories/books/Bagdad-Geneve.PDF |format=PDF |author=Selim Matar |title=Bagdad - Geneve |publisher=Salim-mesopot.com |accessdate=2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The conception of national identity and that of the Iraqi nation ==
In Switzerland, Selim Matar distanced himself from communism from two points: its internationalist and economic mode of thinking, which disregards national identity and cultural factors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aspd.revues.org/171 |title=Eclairage – Des cafés littéraires de Bagdad aux cafés virtuels |publisher=Aspd.revues.org |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the materialist Marxist philosophy which denies spirituality. From being a “universalist materialist”, he becomes now a “spiritual humanist”, believing in cosmic forces, not by adopting any specific religion, but rather in being open to and in studying diverse beliefs from all around the world.&lt;ref name="mesopot1"/&gt;

One of his fundamental ideas: the exterior is the reflection of the interior; every individual essence contains also the essence of the universe. Therefore, individual identity is the basis of all other forms of identity. If we do not believe in ourselves and in what surrounds us, we cannot believe in the collectivity and what lies further. Therefore, if we are not attached to our own people and own identity, we cannot be attached to humanity as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Neue Zürcher Zeitung, 6. Juni 2007 Wenn die Palme Wurzeln schlägt&lt;/ref&gt; It is from this philosophical starting point, as well as his numerous books (essays and novels) and his journal Mesopotamia that Selim MATAR starts to occupy himself with the concept of “national identity”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matar, Selim|date=1999|title=Les séquelles de l’histoire, L’Irak, de Babel à Babel, Qantara, magazine des cultures arabe et méditerranéenne|pages=40–43|url=http://doc.euroconte.org/opac_css/index.php?lvl=bulletin_display&amp;id=1193|accessdate=2015-06-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810142825/http://doc.euroconte.org/opac_css/index.php?lvl=bulletin_display&amp;id=1193|archivedate=10 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact he is considered as the founding figure of the cultural movement known as “identity of the Iraqi nation”, a concept not known in Iraq until the eighties, be it in the political or cultural domain.

The book that really founded this movement is ''Wounded Identity'' (1996, 500 pages, several Iraqi and Arab editions). This work has been studied in several Iraqi universities. The concept of identity is here explained and applied to the Iraqi case, as well as to the Near East and to the whole Arabic world, from a historical and political point of view.

Because of his pacific discourse that calls for national unity and rejection of ethnic and confessional fanaticism, Selim Matar has been contested by communitarian parties and movements leaning towards armed conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.net/home/print/0353e88a-286d-4266-82c6-6094179ea26d/b9f13248-77be-4396-87c5-42af575b6fbe |title=الجزيرة.نت |publisher=Aljazeera.net |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principal books==
Selim MATAR is the author of several works of reflection, essays, novels and short stories. The ensemble of his works can be consulted free of charge on his website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salim.mesopot.com |title=Salim Matar |publisher=Salim.mesopot.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
=== Early life ===
Slavko Goldstein was born in [[Sarajevo]] in the Jewish family of Ivo and Lea Goldstein.&lt;ref&gt;http://arhiva.nacional.hr/clanak/14093/zidovi-koji-su-izgradili-moderni-zagreb&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather Aron had come to [[Karlovac]], which was at the time in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], in 1890 from [[Transylvania]]. There he worked in Lisander Reich's bookshop, and married the latter's sister Adolfa. The Goldsteins then opened a trade in [[Topusko]], and later moved to [[Orljavac]]. From there, they moved to [[Tuzla]] where they opened a store and where Slavko's father Ivo (''Izchak'') was born. After he graduated agronomy in [[Vienna]], Slavko's father returned briefly to Tuzla and, as a convinced [[Zionist]], moved to [[Mandatory Palestine]]. He lived in an agricultural [[kibbutz]] near [[Haifa]]. In 1928, with his wife Lea, whom he had met in Palestine, he returned to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] – not in Tuzla with his father, but in Karlovac where he took over the bookshop from his uncle Lisander Reich. Slavko was born during a trip to [[Sarajevo]], and spent his childhood in Karlovac with his brother [[Daniel Ivin|Danko]] (''Daniel''), where his father was a book dealer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/1941-Year-That-Keeps-Returning/dp/1590176731 ''1941 – Year That Keeps Returning'' (Croatian: ''1941. – Godina koja se vraća'') review], amazon.com; accessed 23 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second World War ===
During the [[Second World War]] and the 1941 [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|Nazi occupation of Yugoslavia]], Slavko's father was arrested by the [[Ustaša]], while  Slavko escaped from Karlovac to {{ill|Banski Kovačevac|hr}} where he was hidden by the Djerek family. His brother Danko took his grandfather Aron to Tuzla, while his mother Lea was in jail from July to August, when she was released thanks to some friends. In January 1942, all three were found in [[Kraljevica]].&lt;ref name="vl1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/biografije/slavko-goldstein-585 |title=Slavko Goldstein - Večernji.hr |publisher=Vecernji.hr |date=2017-08-21 |accessdate=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They thus joined the [[Yugoslav partisans|Partisans]] with whom they stayed until the end of the war.  From Spring 1942 to 1945, Goldstein was active in the field and combat units of the NOVJ.&lt;ref name="sg"&gt;Slavko Goldstein, 2007, str. 479&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Nedjeljom u 2'', 1. travnja 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  He ended the war, at 17, with the rank of [[Lieutenant]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyrb.com/collections/slavko-goldstein Profile of Slavko Goldstein], nyrb.com; accessed 23 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; 
His mother Lea spent the war in the medical service, and his brother Danko as a courier for the Agitprop of the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] (KPJ).&lt;ref name="ncl"&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Robert Bajruši, Marina Biluš, Viktor Zahtila |url=http://arhiva.nacional.hr/clanak/14093/zidovi-koji-su-izgradili-moderni-zagreb |title=Židovi koji su izgradili moderni Zagreb |magazine=[[Nacional (weekly)|Nacional]] |issue=483 |date=2012-06-29 |accessdate=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slavko's father was killed at [[Jadovno concentration camp]] at the end of July or the first day of August 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://db.yadvashem.org/names/nameDetails.html?itemId=1897363&amp;language=en#!prettyPhoto|title=Ivo Izchak Goldstein|publisher=[[Yad Vashem]]|work=Pages of testimony by Daniel Ivin (Danko Goldstein), son of Slavko Goldstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from his father, Slavko lost a part of the family from Tuzla during the Holocaust, who were killed in the [[Jasenovac concentration camp]] and [[Auschwitz]].&lt;ref name="ncl"/&gt;

===After the war===
After the war, Slavko Goldstein graduated in 1947 from the Karlovac Gymnasium. Then he moved to [[Zagreb]] with his family. After the establishment of the [[State of Israel]] in 1949, he emigrated with his brother Danko and participated in the war for Israel's independence as a member of [[Israel Defense Forces]]. He lived there for few years in a [[kibbutz]] with his brother.&lt;ref name="vl1"/&gt;
He returned to [[SFR Yugoslavia]] in the 1950s, and started studying literature and philosophy at the [[Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb|Zagreb Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences]], but he never graduated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/biografije/slavko-goldstein-585 |title=Slavko Goldstein – Večernji.hr |publisher=Vecernji.hr |date= |accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vl1"/&gt;
In the 1950s, Slavko married the Croat Vera Goldstein. Their son [[Ivo Goldstein]] was born in 1958.&lt;ref name="ncl"/&gt;

===Writing career===
During his studies, Goldstein  began working as a [[journalist]]. He worked at [[Jadran Film]], and in 1952 was a member of the editorial staff of ''Vjesnika u srijedu'', editor at [[Radio Zagreb]], and since 1969 editor-in-chief of the publishing house ''Stvarnost''.&lt;ref name="vl1"/&gt; 
Since the 1950s, Goldstein has been continuously active in journalism, publishing and public life in Yugoslavia and later Croatia. He also worked as an editor of ''[[Vjesnik]]''. He is the founder of the publishing house ''Sveučilišne naklade Liber''."&lt;ref name="vl1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sg"/&gt;

Goldstein  also directed five documentary films, and wrote screenplays for several Yugoslav World War II films such as ''[[Signal Over the City]]'' (''Signali nad gradom'', 1960), ''[[Prometheus of the Island]]'' (''Prometej s otoka Viševice'', 1964; co-written with [[Vatroslav Mimica]] and Krunoslav Quien), and ''[[Operation Stadium]]'' (''Akcija stadion'', 1977; co-written with [[Dušan Vukotić]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmovi.com/yu/film/780.shtml|title=Signali nad gradom |publisher=Filmovi.com|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmovi.com/yu/film/745.shtml|title=Prometej s otoka Viševice |publisher=Filmovi.com|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmovi.com/yu/film/239.shtml|title=Akcija "Stadion" |publisher=Filmovi.com|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He edited more than 150 books, and worked as a publisher on about 400 titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrvatskodrustvopisaca.hr/hr/clan/slavko-goldstein-66|title=Slavko Goldstein – Hrvatsko Društvo Pisaca|publisher=Hrvatskodrustvopisaca.hr|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
Goldstein identified as "[[Yugoslavs|Yugoslav]]".&lt;ref name="Vidal-Folch 2014"&gt;{{cite web | last=Vidal-Folch | first=Ignacio | title="Diga que soy yugoslavo" | website=EL PAÍS | date=14 August 2014 | url=https://elpais.com/cultura/2014/08/13/babelia/1407946228_144228.html | language=es |trans-title=Say that I am Yugoslavian | access-date=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 20 May 1989, together with his brother and several associates from ''Cankarjeva založba'', where he worked then ([[Vlado Gotovac]] and [[Božo Kovačević (politician)|Božo Kovačević]] were also employed there), he founded the first political party in modern Croatia, the [[Croatian Social Liberal Party]] (HSLS) and until February 1990 was its President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/12363/croatian-jews-hope-elections-will-end-area-s-isolation|title=Croatian Jews hope elections will end area's isolation|work=Jweekly.com|date=7 January 2000|accessdate=2 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vl1"/&gt;
He launched the journal for democratic culture "''Erazmus''", of which he was also the editor-in-chief.&lt;ref name="vl1"/&gt;

During the 1990s, Goldstein openly opposed of the authoritarian politics of the Croatian President [[Franjo Tuđman]], as well as the [[Privatization in Croatia|privatization process]]. Together with several other Croatian intellectuals, he signed a request for the resignation of President Tuđman in 1993, published in the Erasmus magazine.&lt;ref name="vl1"/&gt;

Goldstein also argued that Tuđman was more a politician than a historian, and that history was interpreted according to his political views. For Goldstein, Tuđman was a solid personality who did not accept the uprising, that is, he flirted with some [[Greater Croatia]] ideas, but not with the Ustaša.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Maša Ilotić |url=http://www.telegram.hr/politika-kriminal/goldstein-kaze-da-je-cijela-afera-oko-hasanbegovica-vrlo-neugodna-i-to-pred-svijetom/ |title=Slavko Goldstein kaže da je cijela afera oko ministra Hasanbegovića vrlo neugodna i to pred svijetom – |publisher=Telegram.hr |date=2016-02-12 |accessdate=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Goldstein published the book ''1941. – Godina koja se vraća'' ("1941 – The Year That Comes Back") for which he received the Cyclop Award for the Publicist Work of the Year.&lt;ref name="vl1"/&gt;  He founded the publishing house "Novi Liber".&lt;ref name="vl1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sg"/&gt;

For a time he was President of the Zagreb Jewish Community and of the "Cultural Society Miroslav Šalom Freiberger", and together with his son, [[Ivo Goldstein|Ivo]], historian, advocated the reconstruction of the [[Zagreb Synagogue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vjesnik.hr/Pdf/2006%5C07%5C22%5C06A6.PDF | title=Sinagogu u Zagrebu gradit će obje općine | first=Gordan | last=Pandža | work=[[Vjesnik]] | date=15 September 2006 | format=PDF | accessdate=2009-05-17 }}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Goldstein was then the first president of the Jewish religious community ''Beth Israel'' from Zagreb, founded in 2007 after an internal conflict in the Jewish community of Zagreb led by [[Ognjen Kraus]].&lt;ref name="vl1"/&gt;

In 2008, although he had stated that he would visit [[Bleiburg]] together with the [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia|SDP]] President [[Zoran Milanovic]], he finally renounced because he "did not want to hurt the feelings of people from my most intimate circle who pleaded me not to go to Bleiburg."&lt;ref name="sd1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/Hrvatska/tabid/66/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/21808/Default.aspx |title=Slavko Goldstein razočarao SDP-ovce, neće u Bleiburg &gt; Slobodna Dalmacija |publisher=Slobodnadalmacija.hr |date=2008-09-10 |accessdate=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the victory of the [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia|SDP]]-led coalition in the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2011|2011 parliamentary elections]], Goldstein became a special advisor for culture of the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanović, as well as President of the Council of the [[Jasenovac Memorial Center]]. In 2011, together with his son Ivo he published the book ''Jasenovac i Bleiburg nisu isto'' ("Jasenovac and Bleiburg are not the same"). In this book, he opposes those who hold that "... Jasenovac and Bleiburg are simply two identical crimes with different ideological signs."&lt;ref name="vl1"/&gt;  
In 2012, he supported the initiative of his brother Danko to abolish the parliamentary commemoration of the victims of the [[Bleiburg repatriations]].&lt;ref&gt;''Otvoreno'', 10. travnja 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Slavko Goldstein opposed the initiative to introduce the greeting ''[[Za dom spremni]]'' as an official greeting of the [[Republic of Croatia Armed Forces|Armed Forces of the Republic of Croatia]]. He stated that he would not be able to live in Croatia if the greeting was introduced in the military, schools or other state institutions, and that he would immediately seek political asylum in another European country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegram.hr/politika-kriminal/slavko-goldstein-za-telegram-odmah-bi-trazio-azil-u-europi-kad-bi-se-u-vojsku-uveo-za-dom-spremni/ |title=Slavko Goldstein za Telegram: Odmah bih iselio iz Hrvatske da se kao službeni pozdrav uvede 'Za dom spremni' – |publisher=Telegram.hr |date=2015-08-25 |accessdate=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edda.jpg|thumb|Print edition of Snorri's Edda of 1666]]
'''Snorri Sturluson'''&lt;ref&gt;The [[Old Norse]]/[[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] spelling of the name is ''Snorri Sturluson''. ''Snorri Sturlason'' is the modern [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and ''Snorre Sturlasson'' the modern [[Swedish language|Swedish]] spelling. For the construction of the name (a [[patronymic]]), see [[Icelandic name|Icelandic naming conventions]]. English no longer features this type of name, except as a foreign word. Anglicization of Scandinavian names is not standard and varies a great deal. Encyclopedias and dictionaries nearly all list Snorri under his Icelandic name. Books and articles may use Snorre Sturleson, Snorri Sturlusson, Snorre Sturlson, Snorri Sturlson, in addition to his Norwegian and Swedish names.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPA-is|ˈsnɔrːɪ ˈstʏrtlʏsɔn|lang}}; 1179 – 23 September 1241) was an [[Iceland]]ic historian, poet, and politician. He was elected twice as [[lawspeaker]] to the Icelandic parliament, the [[Althing]]. He was the author of the ''[[Prose Edda]]'' or ''Younger Edda'', which consists of ''[[Gylfaginning]]'' ("the fooling of Gylfi"), a narrative of [[Norse mythology]], the ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'', a book of poetic language, and the ''[[Háttatal]]'', a list of verse forms. He was also the author of the ''[[Heimskringla]]'', a history of the [[Norway|Norwegian]] kings that begins with legendary material in ''[[Ynglinga saga]]'' and moves through to early medieval [[History of Scandinavia|Scandinavian history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Snorri-Sturluson|title=Snorri Sturluson {{!}} Icelandic writer|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-08-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For stylistic and methodological reasons, Snorri is often taken to be the author of ''[[Egil's saga]]''.

==Biography==
===Early life===
[[File:Hvammur Skeggi Valley.jpg|right|thumb|Skeggi Valley in Hvammur]]
Snorri Sturluson was born in {{ill|Hvammur í Dölum|is}} (commonly translated as Hvamm or Hvammr)&lt;ref&gt;Wittman, P. (1912). [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14060c.htm Snorri Sturluson]. ''The Catholic Encyclopedia''. New York: Robert Appleton Company.&lt;/ref&gt; into the wealthy and powerful [[Sturlungar family clan|Sturlungar family]] of the [[Icelandic Commonwealth]] in 1179. His parents were Sturla Þórðarson the elder&lt;ref&gt;Often Anglicised to ''Sturla Tordson''.&lt;/ref&gt; of Hvammur and his second wife, Guðný Böðvarsdóttir.&lt;ref&gt;One Anglicization is "Gudny, daughter of Bodvar".&lt;/ref&gt; He had two older brothers, Þórðr Sturluson (b. 1165) and [[Sighvatr Sturluson]] (b. 1170), two sisters (Helga and Vigdís) and nine [[half-siblings]].{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}

Snorri was raised from the age of three (or four) by [[Jón Loftsson]], a relative of the Norwegian royal family, in [[Oddi]], Iceland. As Sturla was trying to settle a lawsuit with the priest and chieftain (''goðorðsmaðr'') Páll Sölvason, Páll's wife (Þorbjörg Bjarnardóttir) lunged suddenly at him with a knife — intending, she said, to make him like his one-eyed hero [[Odin]] — but bystanders deflected the blow to his cheek instead.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}} The resulting settlement would have beggared Páll, but Jón Loftsson intervened in the Althing to mitigate the judgment and, to compensate Sturla, offered to raise and educate Snorri.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}

Snorri therefore received an excellent education and made connections that he might not otherwise have made.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}} He attended the school of [[Sæmundr fróði]], grandfather of Jón Loftsson, at Oddi, and never returned to his parents' home. His father died in 1183 and his mother as guardian soon wasted Snorri's share of the inheritance.{{citation needed|reason=Source needed for second part of sentence|date=August 2015}} Jón Loftsson died in 1197. The two families then arranged a marriage in 1199 between Snorri and Herdís, the daughter of Bersi Vermundarson. From her father, Snorri inherited an estate at Borg and a chieftainship. He soon acquired more property and chieftainships.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}

Snorri and Herdís were together for four years at Borg. They had at least two children, Hallbera and Jón. The marriage succumbed to Snorri's philandering, and in 1206, he settled in [[Reykholt, Western Iceland|Reykholt]] as manager of an estate there, but without Herdís. He made significant improvements to the estate, including a hot outdoor bath ([[Snorralaug]]). The bath and the buildings have been preserved to some extent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snorrastofa.is/default.asp?sid_id=14271&amp;tre_rod=001%7C005%7C003%7C001%7C&amp;tId=1 ''Snorralaug'' (Snorrastofa Cultural and Medieval Centre)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204223244/http://www.snorrastofa.is/default.asp?sid_id=14271&amp;tre_rod=001%7C005%7C003%7C001%7C&amp;tId=1 |date=2015-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the initial years at Reykholt he fathered five children by three different women: Guðrún Hreinsdóttir, Oddný, and Þuríður Hallsdóttir.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://guidetoiceland.is/connect-with-locals/regina/snorri-sturluson---the-most-influential-icelander-ever|title=The Historical Reykholt in West-Iceland &amp; Snorri Sturluson – the most influential Icelander|date=2015-07-10|work=Guide to Iceland|access-date=2017-08-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National life===
Snorri quickly became known as a poet, but was also a lawyer.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}} In 1215, he became [[lawspeaker]] of the [[Althing]], the only public office of the Icelandic commonwealth and a position of high respect. In the summer of 1218, he left the lawspeaker position and sailed to [[Norway]], by royal invitation. There he became well acquainted with the teen-aged King [[Haakon IV of Norway|Hákon Hákonarson]] and his co-regent, [[Skule Bårdsson|Jarl Skúli]]. He spent the winter as house-guest of the jarl. They showered gifts upon him, including the ship in which he sailed, and he in return wrote poetry about them. In the summer of 1219 he met his Swedish colleague, the [[lawspeaker]] [[Eskil Magnusson]], and his wife, [[Kristina Nilsdotter|Kristina Nilsdotter Blake]], in [[Skara]]. They were both related to royalty and probably gave Snorri an insight into the history of [[Sweden]].{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}

Snorri was mainly interested in history and culture. The Norwegian regents, however, cultivated Snorri, made him a ''[[Norwegian noble titles#Titles of the old nobility (1st system)|skutilsvein]]'', a senior title roughly equivalent to [[knight]], and received an oath of loyalty. The king hoped to extend his realm to Iceland, which he could do by a resolution of the [[Althing]], of which Snorri had been a key member.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}

In 1220, Snorri returned to Iceland and by 1222 was back as lawspeaker of the Althing, which he held this time until 1232. The basis of his election was entirely his fame as a poet. Politically he was the king's spokesman, supporting union with Norway, a platform that acquired him enemies among the chiefs. In 1224, Snorri married Hallveig Ormsdottir (c. 1199–1241), a granddaughter of Jón Loftsson, now a widow of great means with two young sons, and made a contract of joint property ownership (or ''helmingafélag'') with her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Jón |last1 = Jóhannesson|title=A History of the Old Icelandic Commonwealth: Islendinga Saga|pages=244–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their children did not survive to adulthood, but Hallveig's sons and seven of Snorri's children did live to adulthood.

Snorri was the most powerful chieftain in Iceland during the years 1224–1230.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Chieftains and Power in the Icelandic Commonwealth|last = Sigurðsson|first = Jón Viðar|publisher = |year = 1999|isbn = |location = |page = 136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Failure in Iceland===
{{unreferenced|section|date=January 2018}}
Many of the other chiefs found his position as royal office-holder contrary to their interests, especially the other [[Sturlungar]]. Snorri's strategy was to consolidate power over them, at which point he could offer Iceland to the king. His first moves were civic. On the death in 1222 of Sæmundur, son of Jón Loftsson, he became a suitor for the hand of his daughter, Sólveig. Herdís' silent vote did nothing for his suit. His nephew, Sturla Sighvatsson, Snorri's political opponent, stepped in to marry her in 1223, the year before Snorri met Hallveig.

A period of clan feuding followed. Snorri perceived that only resolute, saga-like actions could achieve his objective, but he proved unwilling or incapable of carrying them out. He raised an armed party under another nephew, Böðvar Þórðarson, and another under his son, Órækja, with the intent of executing a first strike against his brother Sighvatur and Sturla Sighvatsson. On the eve of battle he dismissed those forces and offered terms to his brother.

Sighvatur and Sturla with a force of 1000 men drove Snorri into the countryside, where he sought refuge among the other chiefs. Órækja undertook [[guerrilla]] operations in the fjords of western Iceland and the war was on.

Haakon IV made an effort to intervene from afar, inviting all the chiefs of Iceland to a peace conference in Norway. This maneuver was transparent to Sighvatur, who understood, as apparently Snorri did not, what could happen to the chiefs in Norway. Instead of killing his opponents he began to insist that they take the king up on his offer.

This was Órækja's fate, who was captured by Sturla during an ostensible peace negotiation at Reykjaholt, and also of Þorleifur Þórðarson, a cousin of Snorri's, who came to his assistance with 800 men and was deserted by Snorri on the battlefield in a flare-up over the chain of command. In 1237, Snorri thought it best to join the king.

===The end of Snorri and the Commonwealth===
{{further information|Age of the Sturlungs}}
The reign of [[Haakon IV of Norway|Haakon IV]] (Hákon Hákonarson),  [[List of Norwegian monarchs|King of Norway]], was troubled by civil war relating to questions of succession and was at various times divided into quasi-independent regions under contenders. There were always plots against the king and questions of loyalty but nevertheless managed to build up the Norwegian state from what it had been.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

When Snorri arrived in Norway for the second time, it was clear to the king that he was no longer a reliable agent. The conflict between Haakon and Skúli was beginning to escalate into civil war. Snorri stayed with the jarl, or chief, and his son and the jarl made him a jarl hoping to command his allegiance. In August 1238, Sigvat and four of his sons (Sturla, Markús, Kolbeinn, and Þórður Krókur, the latter two being executed after the battle), were killed at the [[Battle of Örlygsstaðir]] in Iceland against [[Gissur Þorvaldsson]] and Kolbein the Young, chiefs whom they had provoked. Snorri, Órækja, and Þorleifur requested permission to return home. As the king now could not predict Snorri's behavior, permission was denied. He was explicitly ordered to remain in Norway on the basis of his honorary rank. Skúli on the other hand gave permission and helped them book passage.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

Snorri must have had his own ideas about the king's position and the validity of his orders, but at any rate he chose to disobey them; his words according to ''Sturlunga saga'', 'út vil ek' (literally 'I want out', but idiomatically 'I will go home'), have become proverbial in Icelandic.&lt;ref&gt;'Jón Jóhannesson, Magnús Finnbogason and Kristján Eldjárn, ''Sturlunga saga'', 2 vols (Reykjavík: Sturlunguútgáfan, 1946), I 444 [ch. 143]; Rúnar Kristjánsson, 'Út vil ek', ''Morgunblaðið'', 18 April 2001, http://www.mbl.is/greinasafn/grein/600509/.
&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Iceland in 1239.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The king was distracted by the necessity to confront Skúli, who declared himself king in 1239. He was defeated militarily and killed in 1240. Meanwhile, Snorri resumed his chieftainship and made a bid to crush Gissur by prosecuting him in court for the deaths of Sigvat and Sturla. A meeting of the Althing was arranged for the summer of 1241 but Gissur and Kolbein arrived with several hundred men. Snorri and 120 men formed around a church. Gissur chose to pay fines rather than to attack.

Meanwhile, in 1240, after the jarl's defeat, but before his removal from the scene, Haakon sent two agents to Gissur bearing a secret letter with orders to kill or capture Snorri. Gissur was being invited now to join the unionist movement, which he could accept or refuse, just as he pleased. His initial bid to take Snorri at the Althing failed.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

Hallveig died of natural causes. When the family bickered over the inheritance, Hallveig's sons, Klaeing and Orm, asked assistance from their uncle Gissur. Holding a meeting with them and Kolbein the Younger, Gissur brought out the letter. Orm refused. Shortly after, Snorri received a letter in [[cipher runes]] warning him of the plot, but he could not understand them.&lt;ref name="enoksen3"&gt;Enoksen, Lars Magnar (1998). ''Runor: historia, tydning, tolkning''. Lund: Historiska Media. {{ISBN|91-88930-32-7}}. p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gissur led seventy men on a daring raid to his house, achieving complete surprise. Snorri Sturluson was assassinated in his house at [[Reykholt, Western Iceland|Reykholt]] in autumn of 1241. It is not clear that he was given the option of surrender. He fled to the cellar. There, [[Símon knútur]] asked [[Árni beiskur|Arni the Bitter]] to strike him. Then Snorri said: ''Eigi skal höggva!''—"Do not strike!" Símon answered: "Högg þú!" — "You strike now!" Snorri replied: ''Eigi skal höggva!''—"Do not strike!" and these were his last words.&lt;ref&gt;Monsen, Erling (1990). "Introduction to the Translation of Snorre's History of the Norse Kings". ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=N8hgblngVqAC&amp;printsec=frontcover Heimskringla or the Lives of the Norse Kings: Edited with notes by Erling Monsen and translated into English with the assistance of A. H. Smith]''. Mineola, New York: Dover Publications, Inc. {{ISBN|0-486-26366-5}}. p. xi. All accounts of Snorri's life are based on information given mainly in the [[Sturlunga saga]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The History of Iceland|last = Karlsson|first = Gunnar|publisher = |year = 2000|isbn = |location = |page = 81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This act was not popular in either Iceland or Norway. To diminish the odium, the king insisted that if Snorri had submitted he would have been spared. The fact that he could make such an argument reveals how far his influence in Iceland had come. Haakon went on suborning the chiefs of Iceland. In 1262, the Althing ratified union with Norway and royal authority was instituted in Iceland. Each member swore an oath of personal loyalty to the king, a practice which continued as each new king came to the throne, until absolute and hereditary monarchy was formally accepted by the Icelanders in 1662.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

==Legacy==
Snorri Sturluson's writings provide information and indications concerning persons and events influencing the peoples inhabiting North Europe during periods for which relevant information is scarce: thus, for example, he can be used to illuminate relations between England and Scandinavia during the 10th and 11th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;G O Sayles, ''The Medieval Foundations of England'' (London 1967) p. 80-1&lt;/ref&gt; Snorri is considered a figure of enduring importance{{by who|date=April 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;Magnus Magnusson in his book Vikings&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify-inline|date=June 2017}} in this regard,&lt;ref&gt;[http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft0f59n6wc&amp;chunk.id=d0e5789&amp;toc.depth=100&amp;toc.id=d0e5497&amp;brand=ucpress ‘’Snorri and Contemporary Europe: Culture, Society, and Political Analysis’’ (from Society and Politics in Snorri Sturluson's Heimskringla by Sverre Bagge)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Halvdan Koht]] describing his work as "surpassing anything else that the Middle Ages have left us of historical literature".&lt;ref&gt;J R Tanner ed., ''The Cambridge Medieval History Vol VI'' (Cambridge 1929) p. 387&lt;/ref&gt;  He also provided an early account of the discovery of [[Vinland]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Helge Ingstad]], ''Westward to Vinland'' (London 1969) p.29&lt;/ref&gt;

To an extent, the legacy of Snorri Sturluson also played a role in politics long after his death. His writings could be used in support of the claims of later Norwegian kings concerning the venerability and extent of their rule. Later, ''Heimskringla'' factored in establishing a national identity during the [[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905|Norwegian national independence movement]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://no.wikisource.org/wiki/Side:Norske_Kongesagaer_Nationaludgave_vol_1_2nd_ed.djvu/2 ''Norske Kongesagaer Nationaludgave vol 1 2nd ed.djvu/2'' (Side:Norske)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Icelanders|Icelandic]] perception of Snorri in the 20th century and to date has been colored by the historical views adopted when they sought to [[Icelandic Independence Movement|sever their ties with Denmark]], any revision of which still has strong nationalistic sentiments to contend with. To serve such views, Snorri and other leading Icelanders of his time are sometimes judged with some [[Presentism (literary and historical analysis)|presentism]], on the basis of concepts that came into vogue only centuries later, such as [[Sovereign state|state]], [[independence]], [[sovereignty]], and [[nation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snorrastofa.is/default.asp?sid_id=21065&amp;tId=1&amp;Tre_Rod=002|009|001|&amp;qsr ''Life and works of Snorri Sturluson'' by Jónas Kristjánsson Translation: Anna Yates (Snorrastofa)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorials==
* Snorres gate, a street in the district of  [[St. Hanshaugen]] in Oslo, was named in his honor during 1896.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/list-of-streets-in-oslo ''Snorres Gate''  (List of streets in Oslo)]&lt;/ref&gt; There's also  ''Snorrabraut'', a thoroughfare in Eastern Central Reykjavik, Iceland, dating from the 1940s.
* A statue of Snorri Sturluson, by [[Gustav Vigeland]], is located at Reykholt. The Norwegian Government donated the statue to the Icelandic nation in 1947.&lt;ref name="kjelda_2007_3"&gt;[http://www.fylkesarkiv.no/sites/default/files/kjelda_2007_3.pdf ''Island - Snorre-monumentet på Reykholt''] (Kjelda nr. 3 2007, Fylkesarkivet i Sogn og Fjordane)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snorrastofa.is/default.asp?sid_id=7715&amp;tre_rod=002%7C007%7C&amp;tid=1 ''Statue of Snorri Sturluson'' (Snorrastofa Cultural and Medieval Centre)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040810105127/http://www.snorrastofa.is/default.asp?sid_id=7715&amp;tre_rod=002%7C007%7C&amp;tId=1 |date=2004-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. The original intention of donating it on the 700th anniversary of Snorri's death, was precluded by [[World War II]]. A copy of the Reykholt statue was unveiled in  [[Bergen, Norway]] during  1948.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bergen-guide.com/350.htm ''Snorre Sturlason statue  next to  Bryggen Museum'' (Bergen Guide Norway)]&lt;/ref&gt;

* The 700th anniversary of his death was also recognized by the issue of a set of six Norwegian commemorative postage stamps during 1941.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10591">This article covers '''a speech allegedly given by [[Joseph Stalin]], leader of the [[Soviet Union]], on 19 August 1939''' to members of the [[Politburo]], wherein he supposedly described the strategy of the [[Soviet Union]] on the eve of [[World War II]].

The historicity of the speech is still the subject of academic debate. Plausible textual evidence of this speech found in various reputable archives has been academically studied and published, however no formal first-hand evidence of a [[Politburo]] ''meeting'' held on 19 August 1939 or the delivery of the quoted speech has yet been proven. The Russian version of the speech (registered as f. 7, op. 1, d. 1223) can be found at the Center for Historic Documents of the former Special Archives of the USSR.&lt;ref name="nordling"&gt;Carl O. Nordling, ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927220656/http://www.carlonordling.se/ww2/didstalin.html Did Stalin deliver his alleged speech of 19 August 1939?]'' published by the ''Journal of Slavic Military Studies'', 19:93-106, 2006 (Internet Archive).&lt;/ref&gt; Speeches given in secret were common at the time, the Politburo being a closed and secretive body. There are also contrary views that these copies were intended originally as [[propaganda]] and [[disinformation]]. Accordingly, until consensus is reached by [[historian]]s, the discussion of the documents supporting such a thesis are described in this article as an "alleged" speech.

In these reports, Stalin is represented as talking about his strategic view of the growing conflict in [[Europe]], and his view that it would be beneficial for the Soviet agenda, insofar as it would weaken the West, allowing possible territorial expansion.

== Summary of documents ==
In the source material available to historians, Stalin is represented as expressing an expectation that the war would be the best opportunity to weaken both the Western nations and Nazi Germany, and make Germany suitable for "[[Sovietization]]". There is also expectation of eventual territorial expansion to the [[Baltic countries]], [[Finland]] and [[Poland]], with the approval of either the Western powers or Germany.

Historians who have studied these documents have suggested that if such a speech took place, which is usually considered plausible but not proven (see below), then this view may have formed the basis for the Nazi-Soviet pact of non-aggression signed in 1939, known as the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], which was signed just four days later on 23 August 1939.

== Source material and timeline ==
=== First published in 1939 ===

The first version of this speech was published, partially, on 28 November 1939, in the [[Paris]] newspaper ''Le Temps'' by the [[news agency]] ''[[Havas]]'' despatch from [[Geneva]].&lt;ref name="Carley"&gt;"Weeks quotes heavily from a speech which Stalin allegedly gave at a meeting of the Politburo on 19 August 1939 just prior to the conclusion of the Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact. Stalin talked about playing off the French and British against the Germans, undermining the Western democracies and coming in at the end of a long war to spread world revolution (Appendix, pp. 171–173). Weeks should have thought this document too good to be true. He attributes its to Georgi Dimitrov's diary, but it is nowhere to be found there. In fact, it turned up in French military intelligence documents captured by the Red Army at the end of World War II. It is not clear whether the 'original' document, obtained by the French 2e Bureau, was written in French or in Russian.' On 28 November 1939 the Paris daily Le Temps first published a Havas despatch from Geneva quoting Stalin's comments. The story caused a 'sensation', according to Ya. Z. Surits, the Soviet polpred in Paris. Both Le Temps and Havas were semi-official government sources. Surits linked the release of the 'document' to domestic anti-communist politics." Unlike Weeks, Pons is more cautious in assessing the authenticity of Stalin's 'speech' (pp. 190–191). The forgery of Soviet government documents was good business prior to World War II. Weeks appears to be the last in a long line of buyers of such material, though surprisingly Pons also lends it some credibility. In a recent article the Russian historian Sergei Z. Sluch notes that the 'speech' has a long history and many variants, and he argues persuasively that it is a fake. Surely, Sluch writes, historians have enough legitimate materials to study without indulging in 'sensationalism' based on counterfeit documents." (Review: Soviet Foreign Policy in the West, 1936–1941: A Review Article Author(s): Michael Jabara Carley Reviewed work(s): Stalin and the Inevitable War, 1936–1941 by Silvio Pons Stalin's Other War: Soviet Grand Strategy, 1939–1941 by Albert L. Weeks Source: Europe-Asia Studies, Vol. 56, No. 7 (Nov., 2004), pp. 1081–1093)&lt;/ref&gt; Since then several versions, varying in content, have been in circulation.

=== Stalin denies the news in ''Pravda'' ===
In ''[[Pravda]]'' of 30 November 1939, the day of the outbreak of the [[Winter War]], Stalin was asked for his opinion on the report of "the speech" allegedly made "by Stalin to the Politburo on 19 August", in which he is said to have expressed the thought that the war should go on as long as possible, so that the belligerents are exhausted." Stalin stated this was an incorrect assertion, and was quoted by Pravda as saying:
# that it cannot be denied that it was [[France]] and [[England]] that attacked Germany and consequently they are responsible for the present war;
# that Germany made peace proposals to France and England, proposals supported by the Soviet Union on the grounds that a quick end to the war would ease the situation of all countries and peoples;
# that the ruling circles of England and France rudely rejected Germany's peace proposals.

=== Refound and authenticity issues ===

In 1994, Russian publicist Tatiana S. Bushuyeva published an archival reference because  of the speech in an article printed in the ''[[Novy Mir]]'' magazine (#12, 1994), based on what she claimed was recent findings in Soviet Special Archives of a text that according to her was supposedly recorded by a [[Comintern]] member present at the meeting.&lt;ref&gt;The archive files location: Centre for the Preservation of Collections of Historical Documents, former Soviet Special Archives; fund 7, list 1, file 1223, in Russian: Центр хранения историко-документальных коллекций, бывший Особый архив СССР, ф. 7, оп. 1, д. 1223&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual original text is not available yet. Bushuyeva also printed a Russian translation of a version available in [[French language|French]]. This caused another surge of speculations on the issue. Bushuyeva omitted to mention that the referred archival record was from stock related to the documents of General Staff of the [[French Army]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

== Historicity and debate ==
Whether this speech was ever given by Stalin is still the subject of dispute by historians and no proof is as yet unanimously accepted. According to [[Viktor Suvorov]]'s book ''[[M-Day (book)|M-Day]]'', [[Soviet historians]] laid special emphasis on proving that no [[Politburo]] meeting took place on 19 August 1939. Nevertheless, Suvorov states in his book that Russian military historian [[Dmitri Volkogonov]] has found evidence that a meeting really took place on that day.

An article in the ''Otechestvennaya Istoriya'' ((History of the Fatherland), Отечественная история, 2004, № 1) by Sergey Sluch (С.З. Случ) critically reviews the history of "Stalin's Speech", its textological analysis, and possible reasons and sources for the possible forgery. [[Carl O. Nordling|Carl Nordling]], a Finnish statistician and amateur historian, pointed out some counter-theses to Sluch's disapproval of the existence of such a speech.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vivovoco.rsl.ru/VV/JOURNAL/RUHIST/STANET1.HTM Vivos Voco: Я.Г.Яксв,"Певэ Ярюкхмю,Йнрнпни Ме Ашкн"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128034757/http://vivovoco.rsl.ru/VV/JOURNAL/RUHIST/STANET1.HTM |date=2007-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gkaf.narod.ru/kirillov/ref-liter/slutch-00.html#tn54 Случ С.З.

{{main|Mensalão scandal}}
The '''Mensalão scandal''' ({{lang-pt|'''Escândalo do Mensalão'''}}) took place in Brazil in 2005 and threatened to bring down the government of [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]]. ''Mensalão'' is a [[neologism]] and variant of the word for "big monthly payment" (''salário mensal'' or ''mensalidade'').

== June ==
* 8 June 2005 - A CPI is installed to investigate alleged corruption in the Post Office after the testimony of [[Roberto Jefferson]]. [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers Party]] treasurer [[Delúbio Soares]] denied the claims in a press conference and said that he would authorize the investigation of all of his personal bank accounts.
* 14 June - Additional testimony of [[Roberto Jefferson]] in front of the Council of Ethics of the Chamber of the Deputies. Jefferson says that he informed the ministers [[Aldo Rebelo]], {{ILL|Walfrido Mares Guia|pt}}, [[Ciro Gomes]], [[Miro Teixeira]], [[José Dirceu]] and [[Antônio Palocci]] about the alleged payments. Palocci and Dirceu deny they were warned by Jefferson; Rebelo, Guia, and Gomes, and Teixeira confirm that Jefferson warned them about the existence of the "mensalão". Roberto Jefferson states that José Dirceu should resign from the government "quickly".
* 16 June - Minister of Civilian Household  [[José Dirceu]] resigns. Dirceu was labeled by his opponents the "[[Grigori Rasputin|Rasputin]]" of the government because he was a strong figure with influence over President [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|Lula]].
* 17 June - [[Roberto Jefferson]] leaves the presidency of the [[Brazilian Labour Party (current)|Brazilian Labour Party]] (PTB)
* 22 June - Deputy Raquel Teixeira ([[Goiás]]) testifying in front of the Council of Ethics confirms that on 18 February 2004 deputy [[Sandro Mabel]] of the [[Liberal Party (Brazil)|Liberal Party]] (PL) invited her to leave the [[Brazilian Social Democracy Party|PSDB]] in exchange for a monthly payment if she also promised to support the government. According to Raquel, the offer was R$30,000 (about 12,913 USD) a month - which could be increased up to a sum of R$50,000 (about 21,521 USD) with R$1 million ($430,420) as a "bonus" at the end of the year. Raquel says she denounced the request and spoke to the governor of Goiás [[Marconi Perillo]] about it.
* 22 June - Governor [[Marconi Perillo]] ([[Brazilian Social Democracy Party|PSDB]]-[[Goiás]]) tells the Council of Ethics that on 5 March 2004 during an official visit of President [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] to the food enterprise [[Perdigão S.A.]] in [[Rio Verde, Goiás|Rio Verde]], he notified and warned the president about the offer received by deputy Raquel Teixeira ([[Brazilian Social Democracy Party|PSDB]]-[[Goiás]]).
* 30 June – With his left eye injured due to an accident moving an armoire - Deputy [[Roberto Jefferson]] (PTB-[[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]]) testifies to the Post Office CPI. Jefferson says that the agency of the Rural Bank at the 9th floor of Brasilia Shopping mall is used to withdraw the money of mensalão since the delivery by suitcases got very risky.

==July==
* 4 July – [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers Party]] member [[Silvio Pereira]] resigns from his post as secretary general of the party. According to [[Roberto Jefferson|Jefferson]] he was the manager of the "mensalão".
* 4 July – The magazine ''[[Veja (magazine)|Veja]]'' publishes photos of a contract from the Bank BMG S/A indicating [[Marcos Valério]] as the guarantor of a 17 February 2003 R$2.4 million bank loan to the [[Brazilian Workers Party|Workers Party]] (PT).&lt;ref&gt;[http://veja.abril.com.br/idade/exclusivo/060705/sumario.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The document was signed by Workers Party President José Genoíno and party treasurer Delúbio Soares. Genoino claimed that he didn’t read the document when he signed it. Valério had paid back the first R$300,000 of the loan.
* 5 July – Workers Party (PT) treasurer Delúbio Soares resigned.
* Deputy {{ILL|José Borba|pt}} (leader of the PMDB) claimed that Valério, despite not having a public post, directly took part in the nomination of directors for strategic positions in state-run enterprises. Valério denied the claim.
* 6 July – It is discovered that Marcos Valério had moved more than R$800 million within his bank accounts in the past 3 years.
* 6 July – [[Marcos Valério]] testified before the Post Office CPI and maintained that he did not do anything illegal. The veracity of his testimony was questioned by parliamentarians and many political analysts because Valério spoke under a preemptive ''[[habeas corpus]]'' (exempting the individual from certain legal sanctions for not telling the truth) granted by Brazilian courts.
* 6 July – Deputy {{ILL|Carlos Rodrigues (bishop)|pt|Carlos Rodrigues}}  (PL-RJ), former bishop of the [[Igreja Universal do Reino de Deus]] (Universal Church of the Kingdom of God) denied involvement in the scandal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/brasil/ult96u70294.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 7 July – It became public that the [[Bank of Brazil]] (BB) had loaned R$20 million to the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] without any guarantor or guarantees. The CPI for the Post Office began to investigate loans to the Workers’ Party. There were also new claims that members or supporters of the Workers' Party had unique control of the bank.
* 7 July – The bank, postal, and telephone records of Roberto Jefferson, Delúbio Soares, José Genoíno and José Dirceu were subpoenaed.
* 8 July - José Adalberto Vieira da Silva, an adviser to deputy José Nobre Guimarães, who is the brother of Workers’ Party President José Genoíno, was detained at [[São Paulo–Guarulhos International Airport|Cumbica airport]] in [[Guarulhos]] (SP) with US$100,000 in cash stuffed in his underpants and R$200,000 in his luggage.
* 9 July - [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] president [[José Genoíno]] resigns.
* 12 July - Lula completes a ministerial reform which includes the removal of cabinet-level ministerial status from Luiz Gushiken, the Secretariat of Government Communication and Strategic Management (Secom), who had been suspected of having questionable relationships with pensions firms under his jurisdiction.
* 14 July – [[Mauro Marcelo]], director of the [[Agência Brasileira de Inteligência]] (Abin), resigns after calling the Post Office CPI a "circus ring" and their members "wild beasts".
* [[Henrique Pizzolato]], director of Marketing and Communications for the [[Banco do Brasil]] petitions for retirement. Several days earlier, [[Fernanda Karina Somaggio]], former secretary of [[Marcos Valério]] had accused the director of being part of the circle that connected Valério to the government. Pizzolato had already been attacked because he used [[Banco do Brasil]] funds to pay for a Brazilian country music (''[[Música sertaneja|sertaneja]]'') concert which returned profits to the Workers Party (PT).
* 15 July -  During an interview with the national newscast [[Jornal Nacional]] ([[Rede Globo]]) [[Marcos Valério]] admits that the funds in his bank accounts were used as loans to the Workers Party (PT), thereby administering an illegal off-book accounting scheme for the party.
* 15 July -  A number of non-governmental parties assert that Valerio's concessions are actually a strategy to reduce the apparent severity of the crimes since the penalties for off-book accounting are less severe. Some parliamentarians on the CPI recall the "Uruguay Operation", a fictitious financial entity created by some supporters of the impeached President [[Fernando Collor de Mello]] to explain his alleged large financial gains. The deputy Eduardo Paes ([[PSDB]]-[[Rio de Janeiro|RJ]]) labels the Marcos Valério claims as the "Paraguay Operation" as an allusion to this episode. The Paraguayan ambassador to Brazil Luis González Arias protests against the use of the name of his country in this "pejorative manner".
* 17 July -  During an interview to [[Rede Globo]], Workers Party treasurer Delúbio Soares says that the only impropriety he committed was the use of off-book accounting as described by the businessman Marcos Valério two days earlier.
* 17 July - In Paris for the [[Bastille Day]] celebrations, Brazilian President [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|Lula]] says during an exclusive interview with a Brazilian freelance journalist aired in Brazil by [[Rede Globo]] that off-book accounting is a "common practice in Brazil".
* 19 July -  The former secretary-general of the Workers Party (PT) [[Silvio Pereira]] testifies with ''habeas corpus'' protection before the CPI on the Post Office. He does not explain how he received a [[Land Rover]] from an employee of the firm GDK whose president César Oliveira Silvio he admits to knowing. GDK had won a major contract of R$90 million together with Petrobras in 2004. Silvio Pereira, whose salary as a worker of the PT is R$9,000 per month, is accused of living a lifestyle incompatible with his inheritance and income, including a penthouse apartment in [[São Paulo]] and a mansion in [[Ilhabela]]
* 19 July - The subpoenaed bank records of [[Marcos Valério]] and his businesses reveal connections to the leaders of a number of parties, including the PT. The then former President of the House of Deputies [[João Paulo Cunha]] (PT-SP) appears to be the beneficiary of a withdrawal of R$50 thousand made by wife. This information denies his previous claim that his wife was seen at the [[Banco Rural]] branch only while paying a cable television bill. It is also discovered that there were withdrawals of R$320 thousand made by [[Anita Leocádia]], an advisor to the leader of the PT in the House Paulo Rocha (PT-[[Bahia|BA]]), in addition to numerous other withdrawals made by advisors to PT members and other party leaders.
* 20 July - The  Vote Buying Congressional Inquiry (CPI) is installed.
* 20 July - [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] (PT) treasurer Delúbio Soares testifies under ''[[habeas corpus]]'' protection before the Post Office CPI. He says that the only irregularity practiced by his party is book-off accounting and that he is the only guilty party.
* 20 July -  Maria Christina Mendes Caldeira, the former wife of Deputy [[Valdemar Costa Neto]] (PL), accuses Valdemar of receiving the "mensalão". She says her former husband illegally brought dollars into Brazil and that he is a compulsive gambler.
* 20 July -  Also, the STF, after a communication from the Council for Control of Financial Activities (COAF), blocks an account of [[Marcos Valério]]'s wife [[Renilda Fernandes de Souza]] after she tried to withdraw R$1.8 million from a [[Bank Boston]] account in [[Belo Horizonte]], [[Minas Gerais|MG]]
* 20 July -  The President of the Municipal Foundation of Culture in [[Belo Horizonte]] [[Rodrigo Barroso Fernandes]] resigns because of accusations related to money laundering. He has ties to [[Belo Horizonte]] mayor [[Fernando Pimentel]] (PT) because of his work as treasurer during the 2002 election campaign. Rodrigo's name had appeared in the lists of withdrawals from the accounts of Valério's firms SMP&amp;B and DNA (including a R$350 thousand withdrawal from an account of SMP&amp;B with [[Banco Rural]]).

* 22 July - The head of the CPI on the Post Office Delcídio Amaral admits that [[Roberto Costa Pinho]] worked for his election campaign in 2002. Roberto was discovered to have initiated a withdrawal of R$350 thousand from an account of SMP&amp;B, a firm of Valério's. Also, Amaral confirms that he was guarantor of a rent contract for a house in [[Campo Grande]]/[[Mato Grosso do Sul]] for Costa Pinho.
* 22 July - The former secretary-general of the Workers' Party (PT) [[Silvio Pereira]] admits that it was improper to accept a [[Land Rover]] from a businessman. He apologizes and requests his disaffiliation from the Workers' Party.
* 22 July - Newspapers, including [[O Globo]], report that the police have recorded a phone conversation between members of the "[[máfia da previdência]]", a gang specializing in fraud against the [[National Social Security Institute]] (INSS) and the [[Receita Federal]] (Federal Revenue Service), mentioning the names of political figures [[Delúbio Soares]], [[José Dirceu]] and [[Roberto Jefferson]]. The Ministério Público Federal (the Federal Prosecutor's Office) begins to investigate the new connection. [http://www.portalcorreio.com.br/site/noticia.php?id=9669 here] [http://www.radiobras.gov.br/anteriores/2005/sinopses_2207.htm#4]

==August==
* 1 August - President of the [[Liberal Party (Brazil)|PL]], [[Valdemar Costa Neto]], resigns. He concedes that he received illegal money to pay off debts from his political campaigns.
* 2 August - President of the [[Brazilian Social Democracy Party]] (PSDB) [[Eduardo Azeredo]] confesses that his reelection campaign for the state of [[Minas Gerais]] maintained a system of off-book funds and received money from [[Marcos Valério]].
