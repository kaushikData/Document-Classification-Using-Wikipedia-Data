[[File:Herb Kosciesza.jpg|right|150px|thumb|&lt;center&gt;[[Kościesza coat of arms]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
'''Albert Wijuk Kojałowicz''' ({{lang-pl|Wojciech Wijuk Kojałowicz}}; {{lang-lt|Albertas Vijūkas-Kojelavičius}}; {{lang-la|Koialovicius-Wijuk Albertus}}; 1609–1677) was a Lithuanian historian, theologian and translator. He was devoted [[Jesuit]] and religious polemicist, interested in genealogy and [[heraldry]]. He served as a censor, bishops advisor and [[Kanclerz|Deputy Chancellor of Lithuania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://www.google.pl/books?id=cXUIAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Wijuk+Koja%C5%82owicz&amp;dq=Wijuk+Koja%C5%82owicz&amp;lr=&amp;hl=en&amp;pgis=1 Bogdan Suchodolski PAN: ''Historia nauki polskiej'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Albert and his brother Casimir were born in the [[House of Perkūnas]] in [[Kaunas]] (or Romainiai according to other sources) to a poor [[Lithuanian nobility|Lithuanian noble]] family. They bore [[Kościesza coat of arms]], but without a cross-bar.&lt;ref name=Nies/&gt; He studied [[rhetoric]], philosophy and theology in which mastered title of doctor in 1645.&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://www.google.pl/books?id=SrIZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Wijuk+Koja%C5%82owicz&amp;dq=Wijuk+Koja%C5%82owicz&amp;lr=&amp;hl=en&amp;pgis=1 Gabriel Korbut: ''Literatura polska od początków do wojny światowej'']&lt;/ref&gt; Later he was appointed as a professor of [[Vilnius University|Alma Academia et Universitas Vilnensis Societatis Iesu]], teacher of [[logic]], [[physics]], [[metaphysics]] and [[ethic]]. Together with his brothers he joined [[jesuits|Jesuit order]] and founded its colleges in Kaunas, Vilnius and [[Polatsk]].&lt;ref name=Nies&gt;{{pl icon}}[http://www.google.pl/books?id=L2pJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=Wijuk+Koja%C5%82owicz&amp;lr=&amp;hl=en#PPA148,M1 Kasper Niesiecki: ''Herbarz polski'']&lt;/ref&gt; In 1653 he became rector of Vilnius Academy. He died on 6 October 1677 in [[Vilnius]].

Wijuk Kojałowicz was famous for his rhetoric talent and research in the Lithuanian history. He is considered one of the best and most productive historical writers of the 17th century. Among his forty publications most important is ''"Historiae Lituanae"'', which was the first full research on the [[history of Lithuania]].

== History of Lithuania ==
Wijuk Kojałowicz was devoted to the Lithuanian history and his "''Historiae Lituanae''" is considered, next to [[Maciej Stryjkowski]]'s "''Kronika Polska, Litewska, Żmódzka''" and [[Alexander Guagnini]]'s "''Sarmatiae Europaeae Descriptio''", as one of the most important studies of history of Lithuania from the mid-seventeenth century. It was used as main source for Lithuanian history until the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Four Centuries of Enlightenment: A Historic View Of The University Of Vilnius, 1579–1979 |journal=[[Lituanus]]|date=Summer 1981|first=Venclova|last=Tomas|authorlink=Tomas Venclova|coauthors=|volume=27|issue=1|pages=|id= |url=http://www.lituanus.org/1981_2/81_2_01.htm|accessdate=10 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study continued the tradition of [[Lithuanian Chronicles]] by glorifying the heroic past of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], by voicing the patriotic sentiments and by encouraging Lithuanian nobles to protect the territorial integrity of their fatherland.&lt;ref&gt;M. Jučas: ''Lietuvos metraščiai'' (p. 8-9)&lt;/ref&gt;

Wijuk-Kojałowicz also focused on the imperfection of human memory. Memory is, according to him, a defective instrument, with time it tends to remember incorrectly, incompletely, or not at all. The technology of human memory, in Wijuk-Kojałowicz's view, is always uncertain and doubtful, even the written testimony is bound to mutate and to be distorted.&lt;ref name=Koj&gt;Kojelavičius: ''Lietuvos istorija''&lt;br /&gt;a, b-(p.43), c-(p.384), d-(p.489-512)&lt;/ref&gt; Kojałowicz's implied that the goal of history is nothing else but to preserve memory of all things past. The communal or collective memory is firmest when it is written down:

{{cquote|But all this will be recounted better and more comprehensively for the future generations by the history of the times past, I will only touch upon them in order to show for the future that I was able to publish my history of Lithuania only with the support of Your Grace.&lt;ref&gt;Wojciech Wijuk Kojałowicz: ''Historiae Lituanae'' vol.1,&lt;br /&gt; dedication to its supporter, [[Lew Sapieha]].&lt;/ref&gt; There is no doubt that the person who is a celebrated defender of the Lithuanian state must also be a patron of a history of Lithuania..."}}

In the foreword of the first volume of this work entitled "''An opportunity to write the history of Lithuania''", he admitted that he had not just translated Stryjkowski's history but had revised it "''according to the requirements and laws of a written treatise...''" . According to Wijuk-Kojałowicz, Stryjkowski's history, that was written in Polish was not accessible to foreign readers, and it also broke rhetorics and history principles in many places. Because of his critical stance towards Stryjkowski's "''Kronika...''" Wijuk-Kojałowicz revised it so, that it would teach the young not only the history of their country, but also the Latin language.
His goal, as he admitted himself, was to rewrite Stryjkowski's history in Latin according to the rhetoric principles and historical truth. Kojałowicz's history moved away from metaphorical representation favored by Stryjkowski toward a more balanced description. He replaced Stryjkowski's metaphorical style of historical writing preoccupied with analogy and thereby closer to poetry with a rhetoric focused on the mechanics of telling a linear story.

Despite of his critical attitude, Wijuk-Kojałowicz's History of Lithuania reiterated Stryjkowski's chronological and factual errors. As in ''"Kronika...''", the death dates of the Lithuanian Grand Dukes [[Algirdas]] and [[Gediminas]] were incorrect, and the names of Algirdas's sons and uncles were mixed up.&lt;ref&gt;J. Jurginis: ''A. Kojelavičiaus 'Lietuvos istorija' ir jos reikšmė'' (p.22-23)&lt;/ref&gt; The change of places and names, confused in the course of many centuries, sometimes obscured the truth so that it become impossible to distinguish between truth and the fiction for the states were formed during barbarian times when there were no writers.&lt;ref name=Koj/&gt; Because of such reasons there remained very few stories about the origins and customs of the Lithuanians, and thus many widespread stories are questionable or false. Kojałowicz was skeptical about the possibility of history written sine ''ira et studio'', without anger and without preconception, without affection and hatred.

Wijuk-Kojałowicz described the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] as a state consisting of two states, the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], and two nations, the [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]] and [[Polish people|Polish]], which were supposed to have equal rights.&lt;ref name=Koj/&gt; He extensively described the [[Union of Lublin]] which was, in his opinion, a significant event in the history of the Grand Duchy. The Lithuanian nobles were convinced that they needed this union but its conditions had to guarantee and preserve the dignity of the Lithuanian state and Lithuanian nation:
{{cquote|Beyond doubt they wanted the union, but they expected it not to violate the dignity of the state, not to change offices and courts, laws and privileges, customs and finally the borders of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.}}  In his history, Wijuk-Kojałowicz did not fail to record the continuous rivalry between the Lithuanians and Poles for their rights and privileges and their constant distrust of each other.&lt;ref name=Koj/&gt;

Wijuk-Kojałowicz regarded the religion as the most important attribute of national belonging. According to him, neither ethnicity nor language distinguished Lithuanians from [[Ruthenia]]ns but their different creed. Roman Christianity became a definitive composite of a noble's identity.
Wijuk-Kojałowicz wrote that:
{{cquote|A sovereign must appoint to high offices, posts and public duties only a person of the Roman creed, infidels and even some Christians who refuse to be subject to the authority of the Roman Pope must be excluded. Privileges of the whole noble estate must not be applied to those who do not recognize the Catholic religion and do not obey the Pope.}}
In Kojałowicz's works, the nation was, first of all, imagined as a community with common interests and a shared past. His ideas about the historical nation were not only a reflection of cultural forces in the state, they were instrumental in forging popular imagination of the historical community of the Grand Duchy. The word "nation" (''natio''), which he often used, was expressed as a problematic ambivalence in imagining and fictionalizing the community of Lithuania.

[[File:Schernikau Altmark.jpg|thumb|300px|Altmark at [[Schernikau]]]]
The '''{{lang|de|Altmark}}''' (English: Old [[March (territorial entity)|March]]&lt;ref name=Hansard-82&gt;Hansard, ''The Parliamentary Debates from the Year 1803 to the Present Time ...'', Volume 32. 1 February to 6 March 1816, T.C. Hansard, 1816. [https://books.google.com/books?id=I8ETAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=P74#PPA78,M1 pp. 82]. Article XXIII of the [[Final Act of the Congress of Vienna]]&lt;/ref&gt;) is a historic region in [[Germany]], comprising the northern third of [[Saxony-Anhalt]]. As the initial territory of the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|March of Brandenburg]], it is sometimes referred to as the "Cradle of Prussia", as by [[Otto von Bismarck]], a native from [[Schönhausen]] near [[Stendal]].

== Geography ==
[[File:Altmark.png|thumb|Topography of the Altmark]]
The Altmark is located west of the [[Elbe]] river between the cities of [[Hamburg]] and [[Magdeburg]], mostly included in the {{as of | 2009 | alt = present-day}} districts of [[Altmarkkreis Salzwedel]] and [[Stendal (district)|Stendal]]. In the west, the [[Drawehn]] hill range and the [[Drömling]] depression separate it from the [[Lüneburg Heath]] in [[Lower Saxony]]; the Altmark also borders the [[Lüchow-Dannenberg|Wendland]] region in the north and the [[Magdeburg Börde]] in the south. Adjacent east of the Elbe is the historical [[Prignitz]] region.

The population is small. The [[cultural landscape]] within the [[North European Plain]] is rural and widely covered with forests and [[heath (habitat)|heathlands]]. The largest towns are [[Stendal]], with a population of 39,000, and [[Salzwedel]] (21,500).

== History ==
Before the [[Migration Period]] of 300 to 700&amp;nbsp;AD, the [[Lombards]] had settled the future Altmark. Subsequently, Old Germanic [[Saxons|Saxon]] tribes lived in the northwest and [[Polabian Slavs]] in the eastern territories along the Elbe. After the [[Saxon Wars]], waged by [[Charlemagne]] from 772 to 804, the lands became part of the [[Carolingian Empire]]. They formed part of the [[Eastphalia]]n territory of the [[Duchy of Saxony]], which, from 843 onwards, constituted the eastern borderlands of [[East Francia]] under [[Louis the German]]. The [[Bishop of Verden|bishops of Verden]] and [[Bishopric of Halberstadt|of Halberstadt]] promoted the [[Christianisation]] of the Saxon population.

In 936 the German king [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] allotted the territory of the later Altmark to the Saxon Count [[Gero]], in order to subdue the West Slavic [[Wends]] settling on the Elbe. Gero thereafter campaigned in the Slavic lands far beyond the river Elbe and thereafter established the Saxon {{lang|la|[[Marca Geronis]]}} stretching up to the [[Oder]] in the east. Upon Gero's death in 965, his {{lang|la|marca}} was split and the [[Northern March]] was granted to [[Dietrich of Haldensleben]], who nevertheless turned out to be an incapable ruler and lost all the territories east of the Elbe in the Slavic [[Lutici]] uprising of 983. He retained only his margravial title and the initial land basis of his predecessor Gero's conquests west of the river.

For further one-and-a-half centuries, the lands east of the Elbe defied German control, until in 1134 Emperor [[Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothair of Supplinburg]] bestowed the Northern March on the [[House of Ascania|Ascanian]] count [[Albert the Bear]]. Albert signed an inheritance contract with the Slavic [[Hevelli]] prince [[Pribislav (Hevelli prince)|Pribislav]] and in 1150 succeeded him in his eastern territory around the fortress of [[Brandenburg an der Havel]], which became the nucleus of his newly established [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] in 1157. 
[[File:Karte Mark Brandenburg 1320.png|thumb|Brandenburg under the Ascanians, 1320]]
As the Brandenburg margraves expanded their territory during the course of the {{lang|de|[[Ostsiedlung]]}}, the original western territory of the Northern March became known as the Altmark (literally "Old [[March (territorial entity)|March]]") in contrast to the {{lang|de|[[Mittelmark]]}} (Middle March) and {{lang|de|[[Neumark]]}} (New March) beyond the Oder river; the written record first mentions it in 1304 as {{lang|la|Antiqua Marchia}}.

As part of Brandenburg, from 1415 held by the [[House of Hohenzollern]], the Altmark became part of [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] and (from 1701) of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. After Prussia's defeat at the hands of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] in 1806, the terms of the [[Treaty of Tilsit]] (1807) assigned the territory of the Altmark to the new [[Kingdom of Westphalia]]. Prussia regained the area upon Napoleon's defeat (per Article XXIII of the Final Act of the [[Congress of Vienna]], 1815); however, it was incorporated into the new Prussian [[Province of Saxony]] rather than being attached to the [[Province of Brandenburg]].&lt;ref name=Hansard-82/&gt; Within Prussian Saxony, the Altmark was subdivided into the districts of [[Salzwedel]], [[Gardelegen]], [[Osterburg (Altmark)|Osterburg]], and [[Stendal]], all administered within the {{lang|de|[[Regierungsbezirk]]}} of [[Magdeburg (region)|Magdeburg]].

After [[World War II]] the Altmark, lying to the east of the [[inner German border]], became part of the new state of [[Saxony-Anhalt]] in the [[Soviet occupation zone]]. The regional administration of [[East Germany]] saw it administered within {{lang|de|[[Magdeburg (Bezirk)|Bezirk Magdeburg]]}} from 1952 to 1990. With [[German reunification]] in 1990, the Altmark became part of a reconstituted Saxony-Anhalt.

== Rivers and lakes ==
[[File:AlandFloodplain.jpg|thumb|Aland floodplain near [[Wanzer]]]]
The region is drained by the [[Elbe]], joined by the [[Havel]] at [[Havelberg]], and its left tributaries of the Milde-Biese-[[Aland (river)|Aland]] system and the [[Jeetzel]] river.

The largest natural lake of the Altmark is the [[Arendsee (lake)|Arendsee]].

== Transport ==

=== Road ===
The Altmark is located off the main traffic routes. The [[Bundesautobahn 14]] leads to the [[Bundesautobahn 2]] from [[Hanover]] to [[Berlin]], it however ends north of Magdeburg. A continuation through the Altmark towards [[Schwerin]] is planned. Beside which the [[Bundesstraße|Federal roads]] [[Bundesstraße 71|B71]], B107, [[Bundesstraße 188|B188]], B189, B190, [[Bundesstraße 248|B248]] run through the region.

=== Rail ===
Stendal station is a stop on the [[Hanover–Berlin high-speed railway]]. Other lines include:
* [[Stendal–Uelzen railway|Stendal–Salzwedel–Uelzen]]
* [[Wittenberge]]–[[Salzwedel]]–[[Oebisfelde]]

'''Anton Bezenšek''' (15 April 1854 – 11 December 1915) was a [[Slovenes|Slovene]] [[linguist]], journalist, [[shorthand]] expert, and lecturer, who spent most of his life in [[Bulgaria]]. He is known as the scholar who adapted the [[Gabelsberger shorthand]] system to the [[South Slavic languages]].

Bezenšek was born in a small village of [[Bezenškovo Bukovje]] near [[Frankolovo]], Slovenia, in what was then the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] [[Duchy of Styria]]. He attended the [[Celje First Grammar School]] at the age of 12 and graduated with honours. In 1873 he was elected for a chairman of a school student organization, and learnt the [[Croatian language|Croatian]] adaptation of Gabelsberger Shorthand. Later, he entered the [[University of Zagreb]], where he studied [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin]], and [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] in the philosophy faculty.  As a student, he delivered a shorthand course, which was attended by 236 people in 5 years. After graduating, Bezenšek visited [[Prague]], [[Dresden]] and [[Ljubljana]], obtained a teaching permission, and worked in [[Zagreb]] as a chief stenographer in Parliament. In his 1890 biographic notes, he expressed ideas about a common South Slavic shorthand system: "''It would be of benefit to the spread of shorthand among South Slavs to establish a South-Slavic Shorthand Union, like the German or Northern Shorthand Union, &lt;nowiki&gt;[...]&lt;/nowiki&gt; it should have an agency of its own and should hold an annual congress once in Zagreb, once in Belgrade, once in Sofia, once in Ljubljana.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to an invitation from the Bulgarian government, and after being recommended by his colleague Spas Vatsov, Bezenšek moved to the recently formed [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Kingdom]] in 1879, and worked as a chief stenographer at the [[National Assembly (Bulgaria)|National Assembly]] in [[Sofia]]. He agreed on a salary, which was lower than what he could have earned for a professorship. On 25 September 1879 he conducted the first shorthand course in Bulgaria.

In 1884 one of the chief stenographer's students reported against him, and Bezenšek was fired from his job at the National Assembly, but instead of accepting proposals for a return to Slovenia and Croatia, he decided to move to [[Plovdiv]], which was then the capital of [[Eastern Rumelia]]. From 1885 until 1905, he worked in high schools there, introducing Ethics into the curriculum, as well as applying modern methodologies for studying foreign languages &amp;mdash; e.g. his ''New practical manual for easily learning the German language'' ({{lang-bg|Ново практическо ръководство за лесно изучаване на немския език}}).

Bezenšek moved to Sofia again in 1906, and stayed there till his death. He remained an active scholar, issued a lot of publications and translations, and had been a lecturer at the [[Sofia University]] from 1911. Bezenšek played a significant role for fostering the dialogue 
between Bulgarians and Slovenians, publishing a number of works in 
Slovenian on Bulgarian matters and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Anton Bezenšek and Bulgaria - the Slovenian who bridged two Slavic cultures,|last = Nachev|first = Ivaylo|date = 2015, n.3|journal = Etudes Balkanique|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Armazi stele of Vespasian''' ({{lang-ka|ვესპასიანეს არმაზის სტელა}}) is a [[stele]] with [[Ancient Greek]] inscriptions found in 1867&lt;ref&gt;Lomtatidze, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Armazi]], near [[Mtskheta]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] in the ancient capital of the [[Kingdom of Iberia]].

The inscription is dated 75 AD.&lt;ref name="Rapp"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suny, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toumanoff, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The top of the stele is lost. According to Professor David Braund the missing text was in [[Latin]] or Armazic (outgrowth of [[Aramaic language]]).&lt;ref name="Rapp"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rapp, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cyril Toumanoff]] identifies Amazaspus as King [[Amazasp I of Iberia]],&lt;ref&gt;Toumanoff, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; though it can be prince royal Amazaspus, son of [[Pharasmanes I of Iberia]], who is known from the [[Epigram of Amazaspos]] found in [[Rome]].&lt;ref name="Rapp"/&gt;

'''''Aspects of Anglo-Saxon Magic''''' is a study of [[Anglo-Saxon paganism]] and the role of [[magic in Anglo-Saxon England]] that was written by the English poet and independent scholar [[Bill Griffiths]]. It was first published in 1996 by Anglo-Saxon Books, and later republished in a revised edition in 2003.

Divided into two parts, the first section of the book is devoted to a discussion of Anglo-Saxon paganism and magical beliefs, in doing so drawing evidence from Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Classical sources. It looks at a wide range of different areas, including the Anglo-Saxons conception of gods, the beliefs regarding death and the ancestors, and the ideas about elves and dwarves.

==Background==
The use of historical written sources to learn more about the pre-Christian religion of the Anglo-Saxons was something that had been going on for many decades prior to the publication of ''Aspects of Anglo-Saxon Magic''.
In 1948, [[Godfrid Storms]] published ''Anglo-Saxon Magic'', a study of the subject which also contained a complete collection of Anglo-Saxon charms.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sto48|Storms 1948]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Part One===
In the first chapter, entitled "The Up World", Griffiths discusses the Anglo-Saxons' pre-Christian beliefs about their gods, looking at the veneration of idols and the manner in which the deities were understood by the Anglo-Saxons, in doing so contrasting them with those of the Classical world.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gri03|Griffiths 2003]]. pp. 11&amp;ndash;22.&lt;/ref&gt; Moving on into the second chapter, "The Dead World", Griffiths deals with the role of the ancestors in Anglo-Saxon heathenism before proceeding on to discuss beliefs in an afterlife and the reasons for performing sacrifice,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gri03|Griffiths 2003]]. pp. 23&amp;ndash;45.&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter three, "The Around World", looks into the beliefs regarding those species who were neither god nor humans, such as the elves and dwarves, as well as the Anglo-Saxon magical beliefs regarding medicine and agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gri03|Griffiths 2003]]. pp. 47&amp;ndash;71.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth chapter, which is entitled "The Empty World", deals with those Anglo-Saxon texts which portray the supernatural world as "a bleak reality"”, looking at conceptions of predestination and fate,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gri03|Griffiths 2003]]. pp. 73&amp;ndash;79.&lt;/ref&gt; whilst the fifth, entitled "The Rational World", dealt with the role of [[Anglo-Saxon Christianity]] and the wider effect that this had on English society, in particular discussing the significance of [[Bede]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gri03|Griffiths 2003]]. pp. 81&amp;ndash;93.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part Two===
The second part of the book contains a series of Anglo-Saxon texts pertaining to Anglo-Saxon magical practices.

==Reception and review==
''Aspects of Anglo-Saxon Magic'' has not been the subject of any scholarly book reviews.

The academic archaeologist [[Neil Price (archaeologist)|Neil Price]] made reference to ''Aspects of Anglo-Saxon Magic'' in his study of Norse magical beliefs, ''[[The Viking Way (Price book)|The Viking Way: Religion and War in Late Iron Age Scandinavia]]'' (2002). Praising Griffiths' approach in describing the "fluid ambiguities" of Anglo-Saxon cosmological beliefs, he considered such an approach to be an improvement on British archaeologist [[David M. Wilson]]'s book ''Anglo-Saxon Paganism'' (1992), which he believed had failed to even discuss Anglo-Saxon conceptions of cosmology. Price thought that it was pertinent to "bear [Griffiths'] flexible view of the cosmos in mind" when studying Norse cosmological beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pri02|Price 2002]]. pp. 110&amp;ndash;111.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from these mentions in Neil Price's out-of-print PhD thesis, Griffith's book has not made any impact within scholarship in the fields of northern paganism or Anglo-Saxon studies.

Writing on the ''Twisted Tree Bookshelf'' website, [[Paganism (contemporary)|Contemporary Pagan]] D. James reviewed the book, praising it as a "comprehensive" study of the subject of Anglo-Saxon paganism and magic. Opining that it was a "ground breaking" study, James compared it to [[Brian Bates (psychologist)|Brian Bates]]' ''[[The Way of Wyrd]]'' and recommended it to all practicing Pagans.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Jam08|James 2008]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bela Borsody Bevilaqua''' (1885–1962) was a Hungarian cultural historian.

==Family history==
Bela Borsody and his family lived the history of [[Hungary]]. According to his own account in ''Víziváros'', the first Bevilacqua to visit Hungary was Marchese Alfonso Bevilacqua Conte della Maccastorna in 1676.  Marchese Alfonso's wife, Countess Felicita Andreasi daughter of  Marchesi Amorotti Andreasi Da Grado of Ferrara accompanied her husband to visit Prince Ferenc I Rakoczi (1645–76) and Rakoczi's father-in-law, Peter Zrinyi Viceroy of Croatia.  The purpose of the visit was social; however, all of these families were vehemently opposed to the Austrian Habsburg domination of Hungary and northern Italy.

In 1699, Marchese Alfonso Bevilacqua and Countess Felicita Andreasi's son named Nicola (1677–1761) was invited to stay in Hungary by Prince [[Francis II Rákóczi|Ferenc Rákóczi II]] (1676–1735).  Nicola's brother, Morando, was a priest and was invited to be Racoczi II's spiritual advisor, confessor, and personal priest. Nicola and Morando stayed in Hungary in the service of Prince Ferenc Rákóczi II assisting him in organizing alliances against the Habsburg Emperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]].  Nicola and Morando fought with Prince Ferenc Rakoczi II during the War of Independence from 1703 until 1711 against the Habsburg Emperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]].  Nicola began the Ramus Hungaricus branch of the Bevilaqua family in 1699.  His son was Conte Joannis Petri Bevilaqua born in Selmeczbanya in 1740.  The letter “c” was dropped from the Bevilacqua name to make it easier to pronounce in Hungarian.
  
Nicola managed the production of silver, gold, lead, copper, and arsenic for Prince Rakoczi II.  At that time, only the nobility was allowed to own and operate mines.  Nicola lived at the summit of Calvarienberg Mountain in the Hungarian Ore Mountain range in a castle with an adjacent church.  The castle is now used as a fire watch-tower and the town hall.  Nicola and his son Joannis Petri were instrumental in establishing an academy of refining and forestry funded by [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]], Queen of Hungary and Bohemia, Archduchess of Austria, and Roman-German Empress (1717–1780) in 1760.  The Academy still maintains a remarkable collection of minerals, and a chemical laboratory while the mines are now the property of the state.  The Bevilaqua family was also instrumental in developing a flourishing pottery industry, and a well-known tobacco pipes business.  They also developed the baths of Vihnye, with springs of iron, lime, and carbonic acid, and the baths of Szkleno with springs of sulphur and lime.

==Biography==
Béla Borsody Bevilaqua was born in the town of [[Miskolc]] in Borsod county, on February 23, 1885.  He was the great-grandson of Conte Joannis Petri Bevilaqua, who continued the Ramus Hungaricus branch of the Bevilaqua family. Borsody, Bela's middle name referred to the county in which he was born.  Bela's grandfather was also named Bela.  There is a musical manuscript from 1833 in the possession of the Hungarian Popular Music Centre, coming from Béla Bevilaqua &amp; Co's art shop in Breznóbánya.

Autobiographical data.

Béla's father, Rezső (Rudolf) Bevilaqua was born April 20, 1849, in Léva within Bars county in Upper Hungary.  He graduated from college as a qualified teacher. From 1871 to 1872 he wrote for the Debreczeni Inspector, his writings were included the Debreczi-Oradea Report and Wake newspapers.  He also edited and published the DEBRECZENI weekly. He studied and became a lawyer in Kecskemet, and then entered the government service as an administrator in the postal service.  He became postmaster general of Upper Hungary.  In 1888, Rezső Bevilaqua moved to Buda with his family in the service of the government as postmaster general of Hungary. Béla was three years old then and had two elder sisters.  The family first lived at an estate at 44 Iskola utca, but they soon moved to a larger estate on Szagényház utca (today's Varsányi Irén utca) which has recently been demolished next to number 13 in the historical Víziváros section of Budapest.

Béla's mother was Mária Szentessy, a sister, according to ''Víziváros'', was “the well-known poet” [[Gyula Szentessy]]. Their father, Bela Borsody's grandfather, [[Daniel Szentessy]] was one of the Globetrotters that Bela Borsody wrote about in his book entitled ''Regi Magyar Vilagjrok'' or ''Hungarian Old World Travellers''. Dániel Szentessy (1805, [[Zemplénszentes]] – 1895, [[Oradea|Nagyvárad]]) was a sword-forging master.  His family ruled the city of [[Szentes]] from which his surname is derived szentesi.  After the early death of his parents, he was adopted by a Nagyvárad merchant. He completed the Várad Latin school and studied sword-forging.  As a journeyman, he started his wanderings in 1825. The main stations of his fifteen years of travels were the world-famous places of contemporary armoury: [[Vienna]], [[Armoury, Innsbruck|Innsbruck]], [[Alsace-Lorraine]], [[Flandreau]], [[Sheffield]], [[Bayonne]], [[Córdoba, Spain|Cordoba]], [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], [[Algiers]], [[Tunis]], [[Damascus]], and [[Istanbul]].  He returned home to open a workshop in Nagyvárad in 1840. He took part in the 1848 Revolution.  He was court-martialed and sentenced to two years’ imprisonment in Munkács Castle. Released in 1851, he lived in Nagyvárad until his death.

Béla Borsody Bevilaqua went to the Piarist elementary school in [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]], and the Evangelical grammar school in [[Késmárk]].  The costs of his education at this boarding school were covered by his foster-father, his elder sister's, Hilda's husband, Lajos Nagy from Kossoncz, who was a lawyer.  Bela Borsody's father, the Buda postmaster general, died when he was 47, in the year of the millenary or 1896 when Hungary celebrated the 1,000th anniversary of the Magyar Conquest.

Béla Borsody Bevilaqua mentioned another “foster-father”, the noble László Farkas from Indircs, who later became godfather to Béla Borsody's son.  Farkas was a close friend of Rezső Bevilaqua: a landowner from Kőröstétlen, he also lived in Buda on Sövény utca.  He was a plant grower, and he had a close connection with scientific circles via his activity as an amateur botanist.  After the war, he lost his lands and fortune and finished his life as a gardener in the Városmajor Gardens.

Until the age of twelve, Béla Bevilaqua always spent the whole year in Víziváros, then as a student in Késmárk, he spent every summer there.  When his sister married, his widowed mother moved to live with the young couple in a large house at 60 Toldy Ferenc UTCA.  The estate still has its old garden which creeps up a slope to Szabó Ilonka utca.  There is a gate there with the house number 59.

Lajos Nagy's younger brothers’ years in Buda started here as well; their names were Pál and László.  Later they moved to houses of their own: Pál lived in Hajdúhadháza, while László lived in Víziváros. Hilda, after her husband died from a stroke, lived in Lágymányos. Pál was struck to death with hoes and spades by “the looting mob in the stables of his mansion in Hajdúhadháza” in 1945.  László, an army corps commander in Budapest after 1920, was caught by the Reaper in Balatonalmád on his way escaping towards the west.  Hilda perished in misery during the siege and bombing of Budapest; she was buried in the garden of the Technical University. Later, her body was taken to the Óbuda cemetery in 1947.  The father of the Kosonczi Nagy family mentioned above was Lajos Kosonczi Nagy, an artillery lieutenant in the 1848 revolution.  Later he became a judge of the Court of Appeal, a noble from Kolozsvár living in the Hajdú region.  A successive generation of the Nagy family, Hilda Bevilaqua's sister, Lenke, lived in Kolozsvár even in the 1960s.

Bela Borsody Bevilaqua finished his studies at the arts faculty of [[Pest University]] in 1908: his graduation paper, on the Rhetoric of Alexandros, was supervised by the classical philologist [[István Hegedűs]]. Bela Borsody's doctoral thesis was completed in 1911.  Also, he attended medical university as a student in 1930 but did not complete his degree.  Bela Borsody's first job was as a museum assistant in the National Museum, and he became an under-keeper.  He worked in Hungary's number one public collection from 1911 to 1914 in the library which became the predecessor of the [[National Széchenyi Library]].

He was called to front service in the autumn of 1914: he was garrisoned in [[Krakow]] in 1916, and had served in [[Albania]] and [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] by 1918.  When he had the opportunity, he enthusiastically collected ethnographical particulars.  He was impressed by ethnography, a strong attraction to this field of cultural history was always reflected in his works.  He always carried his data in his mind, and members of his changeable but always exacting table society were amazed at his legendary retentive memory.

On arriving home from the frontline, he opened an antiquity shop in one of the Károlyi houses in the town centre, at 25 Veres Pálné utca.  He lived at 65 Váci utca; but when he was an under-keeper, he was a tenant at 41 Liget utca in Kőbánya, and later at 14 Fortuna utca in Buda.  He was trying to make a business of the antiquity shop until 1925, but not with much success.  Then he found a job in the National Military Museum, and he worked there until 1931 in the position of a first assistant.  Then he became a person of private means and attended medical school.

The year 1935 was a turning point in Bela Borsody's career: “he began to live the life of a writer in Budapest” according to Pál Gulyás’ book ''Work and Lives of Hungarian Writers''.  That summer, in one of his newspaper articles, Bela Borsody wrote about his childhood, which always played an important role in his writing.  He wrote with a certain nostalgia for the “little boy from Buda with glasses, bald-headed, weighing 235 pounds and standing six feet four inches tall”.  Despite his old age that he lamented, Bela Borsody was at full physical and social strength who as a private person and a phenomenon in Pest made a strong impact on public memory.  The coffee house wizard is still remembered; the legend of his life is made colourful by the irreversible past.

Borsordy was an expert on the history of Hungarian economics, and wrote a book called ''Régi és új Magyar Takácsmesterségek'' or Old and ''New Weaver Crafts of Hungary''.

B.B.B.’s book ''Magyar Gaudeamus or Old Hungarian Student Songs'' (1932) is about historical students' customs and songs of Hungary.  It contains the lyrics of thirty-two songs with piano arrangements harmonized by [[Tibor Kazacsay]].  Tibor Kazacsay (March 12, 1892, Budapest - October 5, 1977, Budapest) was a composer and pianist who graduated from the Academy of Music in 1914.  He taught musical theory at the National Music Institute and the Berlin Klindwort-Scharwenka Conservatory.  His cantata ''Song about Margaret Island'', composed in memory of the great eighteenth-century Hungarian poet [[János Arany]], was awarded the "Quality Prize" of Budapest City Council in 1958.  In 1960, he composed his ''Ode of Mourn'' in memory of his passed wife with lyrics by István Raics.  While his early style is based on romantic harmonies from the last century, his Balaton Symphony reached the diatonic and modal folk song style first introduced by [[Bartók]] and [[Kodály]].  His other works include: ''Dreamland'' (1932); ''Small Songs on Animals'' (children's songs collection, lyrics by [[Lili B. Radó]], 1937); ''Max and Móric'' (grotesque symphony, 1938).  He also authored a book called ''The Harmonic Theory of New Music'' (1944, Budapest).

B.B.B. is still remembered for books such as ''The History of the Observatory of Eger University''.  The famous observatory in Eger was designed by the astronomer [[Maximilian Hell|Miksa Hell]] and built-in 1776. Hell was approached by the founder, Archbishop [[Károly Esterházy]], and replied: "There is nothing I wish to do more than to serve my country as well as your Excellency in this manner."  Mikas Hell had previously designed and built an observatory at Kolozsvár when he taught at the Jesuit Academy in 1753.  Hell had later taught at Lõcse and Zsolna, and in 1755 became director of the University of Vienna observatory. Miksa Hell, a Jesuit, had an important role in the establishment of almost all of the early observatories.  He lived in Vienna for thirty-two years, and there published a number of famous Ephemerides, that is, almanacs.  Venus was to pass before the Sun in 1769, and the Danish king invited him to make observations at Vardö.  Their observations of June 3 helped them calculate the solar parallax, the distance of the Earth from the Sun.  Their measurement was questioned by contemporaries, but the accuracy of Hell's figures was later confirmed.  It was an achievement that had the greatest international recognition of any during the classical phase of Hungarian astronomy. The Spekula Observatory astronomical museum is located in the library tower, and Bevilaqua had a planet named after him for his book.

BBB made a lifestyle of being a coffee-house writer sitting in libraries, archives, and at café tables.  He collected data, which he later organized in large, cultural-historical monographs.  He made shorter essays and thick volumes, and he probably had his fees in kind from butchers, beer brewers, and café owners alike.  Themes of essays and monographs from BBB's early years covered the history of the malaria epidemic in Montenegro, Arthur Görgey's Frauenhoffer and Dollond telescopes, and the keys of castle gates.  He was also one of the apostles of Hungarian puppetry art and identified historic artifacts in the royal graves at Székesfehérvár. Here can be found the Castle Károlyi, which was built from the castle of the Perényi family by Heinrich Koch Wiener architect in 1884.

Bela Bevilaqua also wrote about the cultural history of polo, and he wrote an opera libretto about [[Mátyás deák]], a hero in legends and folktales.  He worked on a fantastic novel called ''Wooden Sparrow'', and the cultural history of spectacles.  The latter work gave him the opportunity to dine once a week at the house of optician [[András Gács]].  Although these books were almost entirely destroyed, ''Víziváros'' survived as a six-hundred-page long memorial of BBB. Forty copies of ''Víziváros'' have been “adopted” by a society caring for Budapest's past, present and future.  These books were auctioned, and the income was spent on saving and renewing the legendary cultural historian's memorial tomb in Kerepesi cemetery.  The tomb was donated by the international PEN society for his magnificent writing like the two-volume on the history of Hungarian beer brewing.

Bela Borsody's ''A Hungarian Memorial to [[Albrecht Dürer]]'' was written because of the close relationship between Dürer and the Bevilacqua family in Italy.  Morando Bevilacqua's family had constructed a castle and a church to form the ancient nucleus of the city of [[Trento]] during Roman times.  Trento was located on the ancient Antoniin Roman road, an important trade route between Europe and the Mediterranean.  Over time, the ancient Bevilaqua Castle came to be known as the imposing Buonconsiglio Castle which contains the famous frescoes called the Cycle of Months completed in 1400 by an anonymous Bohemian artist.  For each month of the year, the frescoes depict the lives of the peasant and the nobility: harvesting, grape picking, parades, games, and tournaments.  The area surrounding Trento had expansive forests for lumber, grapes for wine production, mulberry bushes to raise silkworms, and the Italian silk industry began there in 400 A.D.

On his return journey from Venice to Germany in 1495, Dürer painted a watercolor of ''The Castle at Trento'' which is displayed in the [[British Museum]] in [[London]].  Dürer also painted another castle owned by the Bevilacqua family: ''View of Arco'' (1495) was a watercolor and gouache on paper now displayed in the [[Musée du Louvre]], [[Paris]].  Alfonso II Bevilacqua (1567–1622) married Livia, the daughter of Count Massimiliano d’ Arco.  Alfonso II was a Gentleman of the Table of the Duke of Ferrara Alfonso II d’ Este, Honorary Chamberlain of the Duke of Mantova Carlo I Gonzaga, and Alfonso II inherited the title and property as the Marquisate of Serra.

Alfonso II and Livia lived in the [[Castle d’Arco]] documented to have been first constructed in 1124 when "Fridericus de Archi" was granted the property by Barbarossa and the Prince-Bishop of Trento. Livia d'Arco was living in Ferrara in the household of her relative Margherita Gonzaga, at the time of her marriage to Alfonso II in 1579.  Livia was living with the Gonzaga family because of her musical talent playing the viol, under the instruction of Luzzasco Luzzaschi and the Ferrarese maestro di cappella, Ippolito Fiorino.

Livia was the great-granddaughter of Odorico, the Count d’ Arco, and Cecilia Gonzaga of Marquis Ludovico II Gonzaga.  Livia was the granddaughter of Count Nicolo d’Arco, the famous poet, and Giulia Gonzaga di Novellara.  Livia's father, Massimiliano inherited the title of Count d’Arco and married Klara Ludovica von Lodron of the Prince of Bavaria.  After Klara's death, Massimiliano married Olimpia Guerrieri and they had six children including Livia.

==Life-style==
As a university student, Bela Borsody “fought a duel of love”, as he wrote in ''Víziváros'', and was put into the state jail for a few days.  He loved life and company, and the cafés served as study-rooms for all his life.  In [[Nap utca]], where he lived between the 1940s and his death, there is somebody, who still remembers him and speaks about him spending all his days “at Bodó’s writing notes at a table by the shop window”.  The same was mentioned by a well-definable circle of journalists on the occasion of his death early in the spring of 1962, and then at dedicating his tombstone, when they commemorated his legendary figure.  Péter Ruffy wrote about “a larger than life figure, Pest-Buda’s curious expert, whose “big and enormous work was often paid with food bills from coffee shop owners, breweries, and butchers.  Due to existential need, the chronicler’s fees were consumed, and despite his huge working capacity, the thick volumes and thousands of pages, the author spent all his life under straitened circumstances.”

[[Ferenc Némethy]] in ''Magyar Nemzet'', the Hungarian daily newspaper, wrote about Bela Borsody's “simple and modest” lifestyle, but he also remarks that this did not make the author timid.  Once in the street, he had an argument with the fascist prime minister, [[Gyula Gömbös]].  The prime minister's poor driving caused an accident, in which an elderly workwoman was injured, and then the minister quickly changed places with his chauffeur.  As a witness of the accident, Béla Bevilaqua, strong and confident, demanded an explanation, although he knew who he was.  Gömbös, looking at Bevilaqua's large fists, sneaked away.”

Of course, the strong physical behaviour, not usually typical of cultural historians, faded as he was growing old.  “You could see that he could not walk, sit down or stand up easily. Still, he wrote. And waiters served Uncle Béla with silent respect. We often gave him sheets of paper, pencils, or a rubber, so that he could work.”  György Kőbányai says in his obituary, “We sat down at his table in the café – this was his office and home – and he knew that he had to help the young generation: ‘You don’t know anything about the town,’ he said.” Kőbányai witnessed how down good old B.B.B. was in his last year, or years: he drank only weak tea, and he asked for two rounds of hot water to fill up the cup when he sipped out half of it.

His constant companion was [[Olga Finály]], a teacher and poet who was more than twenty years younger than he was, and she adored him with love.  They were together almost every day in the cafés and coffee-houses.  When they ordered something, Bevilaqua would say, “Well, let’s sell the skin before we kill the bear!”  He would get a fee for something sooner or later, he promised.  Olga Finály, of course, knew very well that beloved Béla would never kill that bear.

The master had a strong uvular “r” when he spoke, but his strong baritone voice reached the neighbouring tables.  People who were listening to his stories when he stopped writing his slanted lines on quarter-folded sheets did not mind that he omitted articles in speech.  His written style had its strange features as well: when a noun was important for him, he started it with a capital letter, and he used quotation marks with nouns of special importance.

On the first anniversary of his death, Ágnes Fedor wrote in ''Esti Hírlap'', the evening newspaper, about a 1963 encounter with Bela Borsody in a café at Király utca and Károly körút.  Bevilaqua spoke about his film scenario.  It was the outline of a fantastic play called ''Faveréb'' (Wooden Sparrow), about which Bela Borsody wrote much more in ''Víziváros''.  It is about a millionaire who buys some elixir, the water of resurrection.  However, the characters that are brought back to life realize that “life is life only as long as it is real”.  He also wrote operetta books and puppetry plays.  In the 1950s, he was the founder and chairman of the Puppetry Artists’ Association.  In addition to writing, he designed scenery, museum displays, and architectural decoration.  The majolica mail-coach on the building at 13 Régiposta utca was made based on his drawings.

We know several places where he regularly turned up to write and live during the years.  One is the Centrál Coffee House, others are the Huszár and Bodó's.  But he often visited an “espresso bar” in Király utca, especially after the war and when he lived in Buda, or the Hadik, which was one of Karinthy's frequented places.  And he often went to the Japán.  He was restlessly working on those thousands of pages, helped only by his memory.  As we read his printed texts, we know that he often mistook details or he did not remember if he had already completed a certain story in an earlier chapter of the material that he was working on. Since nobody edited his volumes, these mistakes and repeated contents of several passages appeared twice or sometimes three times in the published version as well.

His lines should be read with criticism, but this is not a reason why we should not pay respect to his unusual memory.  After all, he clearly remembered at least two-thirds of the details.  And people who have read anything of his work all know that it almost entirely consists of data.  The colours and phraseology of live speech are missing from his scholastic volumes.  Even so, they are colourful.  The author‘s personality strikes through the scenery of the rather arbitrarily defined mass of information.

[[Ágnes Fedor]]’s article  'Bevilaqua' from the ''Esti Hírlap'' newspaper states, “Bela Borsody Bevilaqua (B.B.B.) was a patron saint of journalists; there are even some young contemporary ones who were presented a splendid mosaic tile of the history of Budapest… By chance, I myself got much more from him than this. I think he saved my life in a way… When I made an interview with him in 1939 about the origin of Hungarian Jews, who he considered to be Khazar on the evidence of geographical and family names he looked at me and asked, ‘Does this anti-Semitic law apply to you as well?’  I nodded.  ‘But you’re a typical Khazar, too!’ he said. He stared at me drawing an inventory of my features, which was very common that time – but he did it for the purpose of saving my life. Then he said, ‘With these features, complexion and bone structure you can securely mingle as a Slovakian maidservant. It’s only your eyebrows that you have to dye fair!’ It was snowing in March 1944 just like today, when I first considered taking his advice. I dyed my eyebrows fair in the danger of death. And I survived.”

Fedor Ágnes went on to publish her book ''Sárga Nárcisz''.  This book was a collection of her poems from 1939 through 1945. The journalist poet recorded the events of the persecution and the Holocaust in poems, together with comments on the political events.  It was published in Budapest in 1945 by Magyar Téka Publishers. Bevilaqua Borsody Béla Borsody secretly wrote a book during World War II called Német Maszlag Othotól Adolf Hitlerig 972-1945 published in Budapest by Magyar Téka in 1945.  Nemet Maszlag means “He will take no lies” and it is based on German data on the history of the German persecution of Hungarian Jews from the year 972 with a special focus on Adolf Hitler's atrocities. The International PEN Society, an association of writers formed in 1926 to defend freedom of expression with 140 centres in 99 countries, awarded B.B.B. their highest honor for using the power of the word for the expression of the freedom of thought in the face of grave personal danger.

Bela Borsody's second wife, according to Pál Gulyás's biography, was Ella Weiss, the daughter of Jónás Weiss and Nanette Gottlieb.  B.B.B. married Ella Weiss in the late 1920s, and she must have died in the late 1950s: the register of his third marriage shows that the “writer and historian” was a widower when he got married for the third time.

==Death==
Bela Borsody's fourth marriage was to Magdolna Mányi, granddaughter of the famous engineer-teacher [[István Kruspér]].  They got married on March 2, 1962, but Bevilaqua died on March 12.  György Kőbányai tells about the romantic marriage ceremony in his obituary as follows: “He lived in Nap utca, Józsefváros, for tens of years, but at the end of last year he moved to a small flat in Kisfaludy utca. A metal bed, cupboard, table, books, and lumber… he lit a candle in the evening.  It was the end of February when he left the house for the last time. The old scholar was not alone when he came back: he was supported by an exquisite old lady. ‘This is my fiancée,’ he introduced her to the caretaker.  Love lasting for a lifetime. They had met when he was a student, but they parted. They loved each other, they had been exchanging letters for more than half a century. The lady was from Martonvásárhely, she was a scientist and a retired teacher. Now she accompanied the scholar, who was sick, up to the street and called a doctor.

At three o’clock in the afternoon on March 1 they called a registry officer.  They were married by Dr. Imre Felméri, the registry officer of the council of district 8, who stood by the sick-bed, the rickety metal bed. There was candlelight, and one of the marriage witnesses, Béla Pethő, local butcher, bought a bottle of wine. ‘Yes,’ it was said twice, then Borsodi-Bevilaqua shook hands with the registry officer, his eyes sparkling, and said, ‘Thank you for marrying us, now I’m sure I’ll recover.’

His wife was beside him, taking care of him.  He fell asleep in God and closed his eyes forever at dawn yesterday.  The death register recorded cerebral hemorrhage; the patient waited for the unavoidable in Rókus Hospital. A lot of people mourned for him; so did Putyi, with whom he built up the connection again after the middle of the 1940s.  His son sent four parcels to his Budapest address in 1961–62. Being in possession of a certificate of poverty, as it is mentioned in his letters, he hoped to be dispensed from paying customs duty.  The mail exchange between Bellino and his father and their finding each other when Putyi was twenty-one years of age.

A lot of people mourned for BBB. It was not the “legal” widow, Magdolna Mányi in her mid-60s that time, that expressed the greatest sorrow, but Olga Finály.  She was his faithful attendant and companion in his last years.  She paid his bills, typed his manuscripts, and who knows how further in tenderness enthusiastic love carried them.  Because it was love, the deep mourn proves it.  Here are the last two stanzas of her poem ‘In memory of the scholar’: “Through the narrow, dim window / eternity came to see him, / may all my songs get softer, / eternity came to see him / through the narrow, dim window, // The all-the-same embraces me, / no need to worry anymore, / hour and minute fall apart, / the all-the-same embraces me.” And here is another, written in 1957 (a third, fourth, fifth one might just as well be quoted): “Remember me. With a sick child’s word / I ask you, like my father, / hold my hand when wandering / through a dense forest / crying to shout after you; / don’t say my wish is sick and senseless, / and remember then that I loved you.”

The spectator representing the unbiased posterity has great admiration for the radiation of Béla Bevilaqua Borsody's spirit, his indisputable and unexplainable attraction, by means of which, even in his physical and existential disability, he was able to attach a woman, who was enthusiastic about him, while he married another, giving romantic colour even to his death.  “Eternal love. Without Hope. When two pronounce the hard and stubborn word of break-off, behind it with broken wings some hope may glitter – when the train flies off, waving farewell with a shawl suggests future, and forthcoming tomorrow – but I was beaten by the sunset, and became a lonely one to keep your last face to my last face.” Olga Finály.

Bela Borsody Bevilaqua's letters from Krakow, where he was garrisoned as an officer in 1916, addressed to his friend, the author, and poet [[Artúr Keleti]], were also signed by a certain lady called Lolly, who appeared as “Mrs. Bevilaqua” in her signature at the end of November.  Artúr Keleti was the best known of the contemporary representatives of Hungarian literature.  Keleti drew inspiration from the lyrical and bizarre and transformed events into poems and stories.  Lolly was Baroness Yolanda Stauffenberger Perényi who took this generation of the family to Washington, D.C. in the United States of America with their son Bellino who was born in February 1917.

'''Birger Nerman''' (6 October 1888 – 22 August  1971) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[archaeologist]], professor, and author.

==Background==
Birger Nerman belonged to a bourgeois family Nerman (Nehrman) from [[Vimmerby]]. He was the son of  Janne Nerman (1844–1920), the bookseller in [[Norrköping]], and his wife Anna Ida Nordberg. Born in Norrköping, Birger was the younger brother of the Swedish Communist leader [[Ture Nerman]] and the twin brother of the artist [[Einar Nerman]]. 

==Career==
Birger Nerman taught as a temporary professor at [[Uppsala University]] in 1917 and in 1920. In 1923 he became professor in archeology at the [[University of Tartu|University of Dorpat]] ([[Tartu, Estonia]]). There he led the excavations of [[Izborsk]] (1924) and [[Grobin]] in Latvia (1929), among other early medieval sites.

In 1925 the [[Swedish Armed Forces]] published his ''The Rise of the Swedish Realm'' (''Det svenska rikets uppkomst'') in which Nerman argued that the formation of the [[Sweden|Swedish state]] had been completed by the 8th century, that it was the direct continuation of the "powerful [[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Svea]] kingdom" mentioned by [[Tacitus]], and that Sweden with its history of two millennia held senior rank among the existing nations of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sv.wikiquote.org/wiki/Birger_Nerman Citat ur Det svenska rikets uppkomst (1925)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, Nerman became the head of the [[Swedish Museum of National Antiquities]], a position he held until 1969. In 1946, he became a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities|Swedish Royal Academy of Letters]]. Between 1967 and 1970, he was chairman of the Swedish Chamber of the [[World Anti-Communist League]].&lt;ref&gt; ''Svenskt biografiskt lexikon''  (Stockholm. 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Center for Maritime Archaeology and Conservation''' (CMAC) was created in May 2005 by the regents of [[Texas A&amp;M University]].&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Donny L. 2005. ''The Institute of Nautical Archaeology &amp; The Nautical Archaeology Program: A History of Both Institutions, Their Interaction, and Their Role in Student Education''. The INA Quarterly, 32(2) 14-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

CMAC supports the [[Nautical Archaeology Program]] (NAP) in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080929210141/http://anthropology.tamu.edu/index.htm Department of Anthropology] and strengthens the position of the NAP as the leading program in nautical and maritime archaeology.  CMAC encompasses eight laboratories which foster interdisciplinary research, education, and outreach programs:
*[http://nautarch.tamu.edu/crl/ Conservation Research Laboratory] (CRL)
*[http://nautarch.tamu.edu/aprl/ Archaeological Preservation Laboratory] (APRL)
*Archaeo-Genomics Laboratory
*[http://nautarch.tamu.edu/shiplab/ J. Richard Steffy Ship Reconstruction Laboratory]
*[http://nautarch.tamu.edu/newworld/ New World Laboratory]
*[http://nautarch.tamu.edu/oldworld/ Old World Laboratory] (OWL)
*[http://nautarch.tamu.edu/model/ Ship Model Laboratory]
*[http://nautarch.tamu.edu/WilderLab/ Wilder Imaging Laboratory]

CMAC provides direction and coordination to scholars worldwide in projects related to nautical archaeology, [[maritime archaeology]], [[underwater archaeology]], or conservation of material recovered from marine or other aqueous environments.  CMAC plays a leading role in disseminating the results of nautical archaeology research to both scientists and the general public through the Studies in Nautical Archaeology Series published by [[Texas A&amp;M University Press]], as well as through journal publications and internet presence.

''[[La Belle (ship)|La Belle]]'' was one of [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle|Robert de La Salle's]] four ships when he explored the [[Gulf of Mexico]] with the ill-fated mission of starting a French colony at the mouth of the [[Mississippi River]] in 1685.  ''La Belle'' was wrecked in present-day [[Matagorda Bay]] the following year, dooming La Salle's [[Texas]] colony to failure.  For over three centuries the wreckage of ''La Belle'' lay forgotten until it was discovered by a team of state archaeologists in 1995.  The discovery of La Salle's flagship in July 1995 was regarded as one of the most important archaeological finds of the century, and a major excavation was launched by the state of Texas that, over a period of about a year, recovered the entire shipwreck and over a million artifacts. All of the artifacts were removed from the hull by the start of March 1997.  From that point on, the archaeologists concentrated on the remains of the ship itself.  The entire ship was disassembled, each timber being carefully recorded before and after its removal from the hull remains.  Fieldwork was completed by May 1997.  The recovered timbers were eventually reassembled in a special cradle and vat designed at [[Texas A&amp;M University]]'s Nautical Archaeology Program, the institution in charge of the conservation of all the artifacts recovered from the shipwreck site after 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Center for Marine Conservation and Archaeology|url=http://nautarch.tamu.edu/cmac/projects.shtml|website=nautarch.tamu.edu|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hull of the ship and many of the recovered artifacts, including a cannon, are now on display at the [[Bob Bullock Texas State History Museum]] in the state capital of Austin.&lt;ref&gt;KXAN News, "Historic LaBelle shipwreck ready for Bullock Museum": http://kxan.com/2014/10/22/historic-labelle-shipwreck-ready-for-bullock-museum/.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Mardi Gras Shipwreck" sank some 200 years ago about 35 miles off the coast of [[Louisiana]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] in 4,000 feet (1220 meters) of water. The shipwreck, whose real identity remains a mystery, lay forgotten at the bottom of the sea until it was discovered in 2002 by an oilfield inspection crew working for the Okeanos Gas Gathering Company (OGGC). In May 2007, an expedition, led by Texas A&amp;M University and funded by OGGC under an agreement with the Minerals Management Service (now [[BOEM]]), was launched to undertake the deepest scientific archaeological excavation ever attempted at that time to study the site on the seafloor and recover artifacts for eventual public display in the [[Louisiana State Museum]]. As part of the educational outreach [[Nautilus Productions]] in partnership with [[BOEM]], Texas A&amp;M University, the [[Florida Public Archaeology Network]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FPAN Home|url=http://www.flpublicarchaeology.org/|website=Florida Public Archaeology}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Veolia Environmental produced a one-hour HD documentary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck|url=http://nautilusproductions.com/projects/mystery-mardi-gras-shipwreck-documentary|website=Nautilus Productions}}&lt;/ref&gt; about the project, short videos for public viewing and provided video updates during the expedition. CMAC was tasked with the conservation and analysis of the material recovered from the wreck site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Center for Maritime Archaeology and Conservation Mardi Gras Project|url=http://nautarch.tamu.edu/mardigras/|website=nautarch.tamu.edu|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4478">'''Claudia Ann Koonz''' (born 1940) is an American historian of [[Nazi Germany]]. Koonz's critique of the [[Women in Nazi Germany|role of women during the Nazi era]], from a [[feminist]] perspective, has become a subject of much debate and research in itself.&lt;ref name="guba"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://concept.journals.villanova.edu/article/download/327/290

==Education==
Koonz received a [[PhD]] from [[Rutgers University]] in 1970. She has taught at the [[College of the Holy Cross]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], Massachusetts, and then at [[Duke University]].

==Scholarship==
Koonz is best known for documenting the appeal of [[Nazism]] to German women, and their enthusiasm in supporting the Nazis. Koonz has established that the leaders of German feminist groups were happy to go along with [[Gleichschaltung]] that coerced Germans into following Nazi policy. Koonz has noted that female supporters of the Nazis accepted the Nazi division of the sexes into a public sphere for men and a private sphere for women. Koonz has claimed that women involved in resistance activities were more likely to escape notice owing to the "masculine" values of the Third Reich.

Another notable claim made by Koonz is that women who most successfully asserted themselves in the "Third Reich" were also the women who violated the norms of civilized society, such as [[Ilse Koch]]. Koonz maintains that only women who were opposed to Nazism 100% can be considered to be a resistance; those women who protested against [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]] and the [[Action T4]] program without protesting the deportation of Jews to death camps are not considered by Koonz to be part of the resistance. Koonz's views have often had her pitted against [[Gisela Bock]] in a battle some have referred to as the ''Historikerinnenstreit'' (quarrel among historians of women).&lt;ref name="guba" /&gt;

[[File:Rock Ptarmigan (Lagopus Muta).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Natural selection]] has driven the [[Rock ptarmigan|ptarmigan]] to change from [[snow camouflage]] in winter to [[disruptive coloration]] suiting [[moorland]] in summer.]]
[[File:Cornselection.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Selective breeding]] transformed [[teosinte]]'s small spikes (left) into modern [[maize]] (right). [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] argued that [[evolution]] worked in a similar way.]]

[[Animal coloration]] provided important early [[Evidence of common descent|evidence for evolution]] by [[natural selection]], at a time when little direct evidence was available. Three major functions of coloration were discovered in the second half of the 19th century, and subsequently used as [[scientific evidence|evidence]] of selection: [[camouflage]] (protective coloration); [[mimicry]], both [[Batesian]] and [[Müllerian mimicry|Müllerian]]; and [[aposematism]].

[[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' was published in 1859, arguing from circumstantial evidence that selection by human breeders could produce change, and that since there was clearly a struggle for existence, that natural selection must be taking place. But he lacked an explanation either for [[genetic variation]] or for [[heredity]], both essential to the theory. Many [[alternatives to natural selection|alternative theories]] were accordingly considered by biologists, threatening to undermine Darwinian evolution.

Some of the first evidence was provided by Darwin's contemporaries, the naturalists [[Henry Walter Bates]] and [[Fritz Müller]]. They described forms of mimicry that now carry their names, based on their observations of tropical butterflies. These highly specific patterns of coloration are readily explained by natural selection, since predators such as birds which hunt by sight will more often catch and kill insects that are less good mimics of distasteful models than those that are better mimics; but the patterns are otherwise hard to explain. 
Darwinists such as [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] and [[Edward Bagnall Poulton]], and in the 20th century [[Hugh Cott]] and [[Bernard Kettlewell]], sought evidence that natural selection was taking place. Wallace noted that [[snow camouflage]], especially plumage and pelage that changed with the seasons, suggested an obvious explanation as an adaptation for concealment. Poulton's 1890 book, ''[[The Colours of Animals]]'', written [[Eclipse of Darwinism|during Darwinism's lowest ebb]], used all the forms of coloration to argue the case for natural selection. Cott described many kinds of camouflage, and in particular his drawings of coincident [[disruptive coloration]] in frogs convinced other biologists that these deceptive markings were products of natural selection. Kettlewell experimented on [[peppered moth evolution]], showing that the species had [[industrial melanism|adapted as pollution changed the environment]]; this provided compelling evidence of Darwinian evolution.

In his 1889 book ''[[Darwinism (book)|Darwinism]]'', the naturalist [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] considered the white coloration of [[Arctic]] animals. He recorded that the [[Arctic fox]], [[Arctic hare]], [[stoat|ermine]] and [[rock ptarmigan|ptarmigan]] change their colour seasonally, and gave "the obvious explanation", that it was for concealment.&lt;ref name=Wallace&gt;{{cite book |author=Wallace, Alfred Russel |authorlink=Alfred Russel Wallace |title=Darwinism - An Exposition Of The Theory Of Natural Selection - With Some Of Its Applications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VaV9CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT180|year=2015 |origyear=1889 |publisher=Read Books |isbn=978-1-4733-7510-9 |page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|In the case of prey animals like the Arctic hare, this is concealment from predators, reducing the chance of being seen and eaten, directly affecting survival. In the case of predators like the Arctic fox, camouflage provides concealment from prey, increasing the change of a successful hunt, and again improving survival chances. Thus whether the camouflage is defensive or aggressive, it would be favoured by natural selection. [[Edward Bagnall Poulton]] named the two cases "general protective resemblance" and "general aggressive resemblance" respectively.&lt;ref name=Poulton/&gt;}} The modern ornithologist W. L. N. Tickell, reviewing proposed explanations of white plumage in birds, writes that in the ptarmigan "it is difficult to escape the conclusion that [[crypsis|cryptic]] brown summer plumage becomes a liability in snow, and white plumage is therefore another cryptic adaptation." All the same, he notes, "in spite of winter plumage, many Ptarmigan in NE Iceland are killed by [[Gyrfalcon]]s throughout the winter."&lt;ref name=Tickell&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tickell |first1=W.

More recently, decreasing snow cover in Poland, caused by [[global warming]], is reflected in a reduced percentage of [[Mustela nivalis|white-coated weasels]] that become white in winter. Days with snow cover halved between 1997 and 2007, and as few as 20 percent of the weasels had white winter coats. This was shown to be a result of natural selection by predators making use of camouflage mismatch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Knapton |first1=Sarah |title=White-furred animals could die out because of climate change, study suggests |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2018/05/24/white-animals-could-die-climate-change-study-suggests/ |accessdate=24 May 2018 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atmeh Andruszkiewicz Zub 2018"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Atmeh | first=Kamal | last2=Andruszkiewicz | first2=Anna | last3=Zub | first3=Karol | title=Climate change is affecting mortality of weasels due to camouflage mismatch | journal=Scientific Reports | volume=8 | issue=1 | pages=7648 | date=24 May 2018 | doi=10.1038/s41598-018-26057-5| pmid=29795400 | pmc=5967304 | bibcode=2018NatSR...8.7648A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Coincident disruptive coloration}}

In the words of camouflage researchers [[Innes Cuthill]] and A. Székely, the English zoologist and [[List of camoufleurs|camouflage expert]] [[Hugh Cott]]'s 1940 book ''[[Adaptive Coloration in Animals]]'' provided "persuasive arguments for the survival value of coloration, and for [[adaptation]] in general, at [[Eclipse of Darwinism|a time when natural selection was far from universally accepted]] within evolutionary biology."&lt;ref name=Stevens2011&gt;{{cite book |author= [[Innes Cuthill|Cuthill, I. C.]]; Székely, A. |editor=[[Martin Stevens (biologist)|Stevens, Martin]]; Merilaita, Sami |title=Animal Camouflage: Mechanisms and Function |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=10TCvK-9v70C&amp;pg=PA50 |year=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-1-139-49623-0 |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, they argue, "Coincident Disruptive Coloration" (one of Cott's categories) "made Cott's drawings the most compelling evidence for natural selection enhancing survival through [[disruptive camouflage]]."&lt;ref name=Stevens2011/&gt; Cott explained, while discussing "a little frog known as [[Afrixalus fornasini|''Megalixalus fornasinii'']]" in his chapter on coincident disruptive coloration, that "it is only when the pattern is considered in relation to the frog's normal attitude of rest that its remarkable nature becomes apparent... The attitude and very striking colour-scheme thus combine to produce an extraordinary effect, whose deceptive appearance depends upon the breaking up of the entire form into two strongly contrasted areas of brown and white. Considered separately, neither part resembles part of a frog. Together in nature the white configuration alone is conspicuous. This stands out and distracts the observer's attention from the true form and contour of the body and appendages on which it is superimposed".&lt;ref name=Cott1940&gt;{{cite book | author=Cott, Hugh B. | authorlink=Hugh B. Cott | year=1940 | title=Adaptive Coloration in Animals | publisher=Methuen | url=https://archive.org/details/adaptivecolorati00cott | pages=68–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cott concluded that the effect was concealment "so long as the false configuration is recognized in preference to the real one".&lt;ref name=Cott1940/&gt; Such patterns embody, as Cott stressed, considerable precision as the markings must line up accurately for the disguise to work. Cott's description and in particular his drawings convinced biologists that the markings, and hence the camouflage, must have survival value (rather than occurring by chance); and further, as Cuthill and Székely indicate, that the bodies of animals that have such patterns must indeed have been shaped by natural selection.&lt;ref name=Stevens2011/&gt;{{-}}

===Industrial melanism===
{{main|Industrial melanism|Peppered moth evolution}}

Between 1953 and 1956, the geneticist [[Bernard Kettlewell]] experimented on [[peppered moth evolution]]. He presented results showing that in a polluted urban wood with dark tree trunks, dark moths survived better than pale ones, causing [[industrial melanism]], whereas in a clean rural wood with paler trunks, pale moths survived better than dark ones. The implication was that survival was caused by camouflage against suitable backgrounds, where predators hunting by sight (insect-eating birds, such as the [[great tit]]s used in the experiment) selectively caught and killed the less well-camouflaged moths. The results were intensely controversial, and from 2001 [[Michael Majerus]] carefully repeated the experiment. The results were published posthumously in 2012, vindicating Kettlewell's work as "the most direct evidence", and "one of the clearest and most easily understood examples of Darwinian evolution in action".&lt;ref name="Cook2012"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Cook, L.

===Batesian===
{{main|Batesian mimicry}}

[[Batesian mimicry]], named for the 19th century naturalist [[Henry Walter Bates]] who first noted the effect in 1861, "provides numerous excellent examples of natural selection"&lt;ref name=Rice2009&gt;{{cite book |last=Rice |first=Stanley A. |title=Encyclopedia of Evolution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YRcAVvmE6eMC&amp;pg=PA274 |year=2009 |publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]] |isbn=978-1-4381-1005-9 |page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; at work. The evolutionary entomologist [[James Mallet]] noted that [[mimicry]] was "arguably the oldest [[Darwinian]] theory not attributable to Darwin."&lt;ref name=Mallet2001/&gt; Inspired by ''On the Origin of Species'', Bates realized that unrelated Amazonian butterflies resembled each other when they lived in the same areas, but had different coloration in different locations in the Amazon, something that could only have been caused by adaptation.&lt;ref name=Mallet2001&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mallet |first1=James |authorlink=James Mallet |title=Mimicry: An interface between psychology and evolution |journal=PNAS |date=July 2001 |volume=98 |issue=16 |pages=8928–8930 |doi=10.1073/pnas.171326298 |pmid=11481461 |pmc=55348|bibcode=2001PNAS...98.8928M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Müllerian===
{{main|Müllerian mimicry}}

[[Müllerian mimicry]], too, in which two or more distasteful species that share one or more predators have come to mimic each other's warning signals, was clearly adaptive; [[Fritz Müller]] described the effect in 1879, in an account notable for being the first use of [[mathematical biology|a mathematical argument]] in [[evolutionary ecology]] to show how powerful the effect of natural selection would be.{{efn|If one may ignore, as [[James Mallet|Mallet]] comments, [[Malthus]]'s discussion of the effects of [[population growth]] that influenced Darwin.&lt;ref name=Mallet2001/&gt;}}&lt;ref name=Mallet2001/&gt;{{-}}

[[File:Yellow-banded.poison.dart.frog.arp.jpg|upright|thumb|[[aposematic|Warning coloration]] protects poison dart frog ''[[Dendrobates leucomelas]]''.]]

==Aposematism==
{{main|Aposematism}}

In 1867, in a letter to Darwin, Wallace [[Aposematism#Wallace, 1867|described warning coloration]]. The evolutionary zoologist [[James Mallet]] notes that this discovery "rather illogically"&lt;ref name=Mallet2001/&gt; followed rather than preceded the accounts of Batesian and Müllerian mimicry, which both rely on the existence and effectiveness of warning coloration.&lt;ref name=Mallet2001/&gt;{{efn|[[Edward Bagnall Poulton]] invented the name [[aposematism]] some years later, in 1890, in his book ''[[The Colours of Animals]]''.&lt;ref name=Poulton&gt;{{cite book |author=Poulton, Edward Bagnall |authorlink=Edward Bagnall Poulton |date=1890 |title=The Colours of Animals |page=Foldout after page 339|title-link=The Colours of Animals }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The conspicuous colours and patterns of animals with strong defences such as toxins are [[advertising in biology|advertised]] to [[predator]]s, [[honest signalling|signalling honestly]] that the animal is not worth attacking. This directly increases the [[reproductive fitness]] of the potential prey, providing a strong selective advantage. The existence of unequivocal warning coloration is therefore clear evidence of natural selection at work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sherratt, T. N. |authorlink=Thomas N.

==Defence of Darwinism==
{{further|Eclipse of Darwinism}}
[[File:Brazilian Skunk from Edward Bagnall Poulton Colours of Animals 1890.jpg|thumb|left|Warning coloration of the "Brazilian Skunk" in [[Edward Bagnall Poulton]]'s ''[[The Colours of Animals]]'', 1890]]

[[Edward Bagnall Poulton]]'s 1890 book, ''[[The Colours of Animals]]'', renamed Wallace's concept of warning colours "aposematic" coloration, as well as supporting Darwin's then unpopular theories of natural selection and [[sexual selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/Mim/poulton90.html | title=E.B. Poulton (1890) | publisher=[[University College London]] | accessdate=23 November 2012 | author=Mallet, Jim |authorlink=James Mallet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poulton's explanations of coloration are emphatically Darwinian. For example, on aposematic colouration he wrote that

{{blockquote|At first sight the existence of this group seems to be a difficulty in the way of the general applicability of the theory of natural selection. Warning Colours appear to benefit the would-be enemies rather than the conspicuous forms themselves, and the origin and growth of a character intended solely for the advantage of some other species cannot be explained by the theory of natural selection. But the conspicuous animal is greatly benefited by its Warning Colours. If it resembled its surroundings like the members of the other class, it would be liable to a great deal of accidental or experimental tasting, and there would be nothing about it to impress the memory of an enemy, and thus to prevent the continual destruction of individuals. The object of Warning Colours is to assist the education of enemies, enabling them to easily learn and remember the animals which are to be avoided. The great advantage conferred upon the conspicuous species is obvious when it is remembered that such an easy and successful education means an education involving only a small sacrifice of life."&lt;ref name=Poulton1890/&gt;&lt;!--end blockquote--&gt;}}

Poulton summed up his allegiance to Darwinism as an explanation of Batesian mimicry in one sentence: "Every step in the gradually increasing change of the mimicking in the direction of specially protected form, would have been an advantage in the struggle for existence".&lt;ref name=Poulton1890&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Edward Bagnall Poulton |author=Poulton, Edward Bagnall |date=1890 |url=http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/edward-bagnall-poulton/the-colours-of-animals-their-meaning-and-use-especially-considered-in-the-case-ala/1-the-colours-of-animals-their-meaning-and-use-especially-considered-in-the-case-ala.shtml |title=The Colours of Animals, their meaning and use, especially considered in the case of insects |publisher=Kegan Paul, Trench &amp; Trübner |pages=160–161, 220, and whole book}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian of science Peter J. Bowler commented that Poulton used his book to complain about experimentalists' lack of attention to what field naturalists (like Wallace, Bates, and Poulton) could readily see were adaptive features. Bowler added that "The fact that the adaptive significance of coloration ''was'' (sic) widely challenged indicates just how far anti-Darwinian feeling had developed.{{efn|In the [[eclipse of Darwinism]].}} Only field naturalists such as Poulton refused to give in, convinced that their observations showed the validity of selection, whatever the theoretical problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowler |first=Peter J. |authorlink=Peter J.

The '''Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA)''' is a Singaporean government agency under the [[Prime Minister's Office (Singapore)|Prime Minister's Office]] that provides centralised oversight of national [[cyber security]] functions, and works with public and private sector leads to protect Singapore’s critical services, such as those in the energy and banking sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/new-cyber-security-agency-to-be-set-up-in-april-yaacob-ibrahim-to-be-minister-in-charge-of|title=New Cyber Security Agency to be set up in April, Yaacob Ibrahim to be minister in charge of cyber security|last=Tham|first=Irene|date=2015-01-27|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2017-09-05|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formed on 1 April 2015, the agency also engages with various industries and stakeholders to heighten cyber security awareness as well as to ensure the development of Singapore’s cyber security. It is headed by [[Ministry of Defence (Singapore)|Ministry of Defence]]'s deputy secretary of technology David Koh. The Minister-in-charge is S. Iswaran of the [[Ministry of Communications and Information]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/cabinet-reshuffle-s-iswaran-is-new-minister-for-communications-and-information|title=Cabinet reshuffle: S. Iswaran is new Minister for Communications and Information|work=Straits Times|access-date=2018-05-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and overview==
The Cyber Security Agency took over the functions previously carried out by the Singapore Infocomm Technology Security Authority (SITSA), under the Ministry of Home Affairs. SITSA was set up in 2009 as the national specialist authority overseeing operational IT security.

The CSA also took over some roles undertaken by the then-Infocomm Development of Authority (IDA) such as the Singapore [[Computer emergency response team|Computer Emergency Response Team]], which facilitates the detection, resolution and prevention of security-related incidents on the Internet.

The agency builds upon the government’s cyber security capabilities, which include strategy and policy development, cyber security operations, industry development and outreach; as well as public communications and engagement.

It has organised events such as the Singapore International Cyber Week (SICW) in 2016 with over 5,000 attendees from close to 50 countries. The SICW also saw the launch of Singapore’s Cybersecurity Strategy. The second edition of the SICW will be held from 18 to 21 September 2017. Singapore will also host the 2nd ASEAN Ministerial Conference on Cybersecurity this year.

== Singapore's Cybersecurity Strategy ==
In October 2016, the prime minister launched Singapore’s Cybersecurity Strategy with the aim to create a resilient and trusted cyber environment for Singapore. Four pillars underpin the strategy:
* Building a Resilient Infrastructure
* Creating a Safer Cyberspace 
* Developing a Vibrant Cybersecurity Ecosystem
* Strengthening International Partnerships

===Cutting off internet access===
As part of Singapore's cybersecurity strategy, internet access of civil servants' work station will be cut-off. David Koh, chief executive of the newly formed Cyber Security Agency, said officials realised there was too much data to secure and "there is no way to secure this because the attack surface is like a building with a zillion windows, doors, fire escapes".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/24/singapore-to-cut-off-public-servants-from-the-internet&lt;/ref&gt;

Security experts commented that the move may only raise the defense against cyber attack slightly but risk damaging productivity of civil servants and those working at more than four dozen statutory boards, and cutting them off from the people they serve.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/24/singapore-to-cut-off-public-servants-from-the-internet&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''dislocation of Sami people''' was the ordered movement of 300–400 [[Sami people]] from [[Jukkasjärvi]] and [[Karesuando]] in the 1920s to 1940s.

==Background==
This was outermost a result of political nature between [[Norway]] and [[Russia]]. Russia wanted the right to keep on fishing in Norwegian [[fjords]] but this was denied by Norway. In 1852 Russia answered by cutting off all relationships with Norway, causing regions in [[Torne Valley]] (on the Finnish-Russian side) to be excluded from Norwegian Samis' traditional pasture lands and vice versa. About 400 individuals from Norwegian [[Kautokeino]] area then started to change nationality to Swedish and settled in the parish of [[Karesuando]], simply to gain access to previous pasture regions in [[Finland]], since Russia said that Swedish Samis could enter Finland. This lasted until 1889, when Russia closed the border between Sweden and Finland also for Swedish Samis.

==Dislocation==

=== First movings ===
After the pasture in Karesuando became exhausted, which happened very quickly due to many of the families who left Kautokeino had very large herds, some of the original families of Karesuando and some of Kautokeino moved to the parishes of [[Jukkasjärvi]], [[Gällivare]], and [[Jokkmokk]]. Among these were [[Johan Turi]].  These first movings was all by own choice.

===Forced relocation===
In 1919 Norway and Sweden wrote a new convention about reindeer pasture areas. This led to the four northernmost Sami villages losing their right to pasture in Norway.  As the herds grew and the situation became worse, the Swedish parliament decided that the number of reindeer in Karesuando should be decreased or else moved.  Most herders refused to cut down their herd and the authorities decided to move some families from Karesuando by force.  In the early 1920s several families and 10,000s of reindeer were moved.  Most of them to [[Arjeplog]] and [[Jokkmokk]] in south [[Norrbotten]] but also to [[Västerbotten]] particularly [[Tärnaby]]. This relocation is what most people mean when they talk about ''dislocation by force'' since those who resisted were threatened by law.

===Third wave===
In the 1940s a few families moved from Karesuando to Jokkmokk and Norway.  This was all by own choice.

===Consequences===
Since the [[Northern Sami]] were different from the Sami originally living in the areas to which they moved, great controversy emerged.  Most of the conflicts were centered around reindeer herding since the North Sami were used to other conditions and had different methods of herding. When the authorities intervened, they were unable to solve the problems; however they sided with the North Sami, claiming that they were more ''primitive'' – an opinion possibly based on clear racism.  These conflicts between the original users of the land and the newcomers still divide the Sami in the area today.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

The '''dupondius''' ([[Latin]] ''two-pounder'') was a [[brass]] [[coin]] used during the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Roman Republic]] valued at 2 [[as (coin)|asses]] (1/2 of a [[sestertius]] or 1/8 of a [[denarius]]).

The dupondius was introduced during the Roman Republic as a large bronze [[casting (metalworking)|cast]] coin, although even at introduction it weighed less than 2 pounds. The initial coins featured the bust of [[Roma (mythology)|Roma]] on the obverse and a six-spoked [[wheel]] on the reverse.

With the [[coinage reform of Augustus]] in about 23 BC, the [[sestertius]] and dupondius were produced in a golden colored [[copper-alloy]] called [[orichalcum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andonio.it/monrom/smraugustus.htm |title=Roman Coinage, Chapter III: Augustus Reform |last=Louvet|first=Edouard |website=Edouard Louvet. Monedas Romanas |access-date=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the Romans and numismatists, and Latin [[brass]] by us, while lower denominations were produced out of reddish copper. However, some dupondii were made entirely from [[copper]] under [[Augustus]], while under [[Nero]] some [[As (Roman coin)|aes]] were made from both [[orichalcum]] and [[copper]], instead of only copper for [[as (Roman coin)|aes]] coined until then. Therefore, the latter can only be distinguished from dupondii by their smaller size instead of by also the appearance of the metal{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}.

The dupondius was normally further distinguished from the similarly sized [[as (coin)|as]] with the addition of a [[radiate crown]] to the bust of the emperor in 66 AD during the reign of [[Nero]]. Using a radiate crown to indicate double value was also markedly used on the [[antoninianus]] (double [[denarius]]) introduced by [[Caracalla]] and the [[double sestertius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andonio.it/monrom/cabezas.htm#radiada |title=Roman Coinage, Crowns |last=Louvet|first=Edouard |website=Edouard Louvet. Monedas Romanas |access-date=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since dupondii minted prior to and during the reign of [[Nero]], and occasionally under later rulers, lack the radiate crown, it is often hard to distinguish between the [[as (coin)|as]] and the dupondius due to heavy [[patina]] which often obscures the coin's original color{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}.

An extremely rare dupondius from the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius]], dated to 154 or 155 and in excellent condition, was discovered in 2007 at the archeological site in [[Draper's Gardens]], London{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}.

[[Image:VespasianDupondius.jpg|thumb|400px|center|Dupondius of [[Vespasian]] (69-79), struck at [[Lyon]] in about 72-73. This coin seems to have escaped the serious corrosion typically observed in ancient coins and thus retains nearly its original appearance and colour, showing why the Romans sometimes also called this alloy ''aurichalcum'', from ''aurum'' for [[gold]] in Latin+"-chalcum" as in the most widely used [[orichalcum]]. The coin measures about 29mm in diameter.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1963">'''Early modern demography''' is the demography of the world after the end of the [[medieval]] period, encompassing the whole of the [[Early modern period]] until the availability of accurate census records and other data which form the basis for contemporary demography.

Depending on the context, the end of the medieval world and the beginning of the modern may be dated to the [[Black Death]] in the middle of the 14th Century, the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in the middle of the 15th Century, or the [[Age of Exploration]] and the [[History of smallpox#Epidemics in the Americas|resulting epidemic deaths]].

==Early modern demography in Europe==

[[Karl Julius Beloch]] estimated the population of early modern Europe, circa 1600, as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Julius |last=Beloch |chapter=Die Bevölkerung Europas zur Zeit der Renaissance |title=Zeitschrift für Socialwissenschaft |year=1900 |pages=765–786 |publisher=Georg Reimer |volume=3 |oclc=934032978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Italy, 13,000,000
*Spain and Portugal, 10,000,000
*France, 16,000,000, in its boundaries in 1600&lt;ref&gt;Beloch gives it an area of 470,000 km2, too small for France in 1900.&lt;/ref&gt;
*England and Wales, 4,500,000
*Scotland and Ireland, 2,000,000
*Netherlands, 3,000,000, including the Spanish Netherlands in 1600&lt;ref&gt;Beloch gives it an area of 75,000 km2, enough to include Belgium and possibly even Luxemburg.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Denmark, 600,000
*Sweden, Norway, and Finland: 1,400,000
*Poland with Prussia: 3,000,000
*Germany: 20,000,000, probably including most or all of the territory of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] outside Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Beloch gives it an area of 720,000 km2, about twice the size of modern Germany.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Efraín "Cholo" Trelles Aréstegui''' (28 May 1953 &amp;ndash; 1 April 2018), was a [[Peru]]vian historian, writer, journalist and sports commentator for press, television and radio.

Efraín Trelles was born in 1953, in [[Andahuaylas]]. Historian trained in colonial history, graduated by the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Peru]], with a thesis that became the classic: ''Lucas Martínez Vegazo: operation of an initial Peruvian encomienda''. He was one of the pioneers in introducing the analysis of data and computer models in his study on the loyalties of the [[kuraka|kurakas]] in the [[Rebellion of Túpac Amaru II]], which he published with Magnus Mörner in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[https://elcomercio.pe/deporte-total/efrain-trelles-periodistas-historiadores-escritores-lamentan-deceso-facebook-twitter-noticia-508675 Efraín Trelles: periodistas e historiadores lamentan su muerte en Facebook y Twitter] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He then traveled to the University of Austin to do his doctorate studies.

His foray into sports journalism began as a personal hobby. He worked as a columnist in several newspapers of the Peruvian capital as ''Expreso'' and ''[[La República]]''. He worked as a journalist and historian in [[Radio Programas del Perú|RPP]] and [[Latina Televisión]]. His last work was as host of the program ''La cátedra'' at [[Radio Nacional del Perú]], &lt;ref&gt;[https://publimetro.pe/actualidad/noticia-efrain-trelles-periodista-deportivo-fallecio-esta-madrugada-72393 Efraín Trelles, periodista e historiador falleció esta madrugada] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with Roberto Zegarra, Wilmer del Aguila, Ítalo Villarreal, Martín Fernández, Miguel Portanova, Santos Calderón, Dante Mateo, Tito Ponte, Josè Espinoza, among other journalists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publimetro.pe/actualidad/noticia-efrain-trelles-periodista-deportivo-fallecio-esta-madrugada-72393 Víctima de un infarto falleció hoy el periodista e historiador, Efraín Trelles] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consentidosiempre.pe/deportes/efrain-trelles-tayta-quipu-tupananchikama/ Efraín Trelles ¡Tayta Quipu tupananchikama!] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''fifty øre''' coin is the smallest-denomination coin of the [[Danish krone]]. Since the removal of the 25 øre coin in 2008, it has been the only Danish coin with a face value of under one krone.

==Design==
The design is almost identical to the [[Twenty-five øre (Danish coin)|25 øre coin]] issued in 1991, the only differences being the face value of the coin and the size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Nationalbanken | url=http://nationalbanken.dk/DNUK/NotesAndCoins.nsf/side/50-oere_coin_!OpenDocument | title=50-øre coin | accessdate=2008-05-21 | authorlink=Danmarks Nationalbank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The first coin of the denomination of half of a krone was a ½ krone coin issued in 1924, measuring 20mm in diameter and 2mm in thickness. It featured on its obverse the monogram of King [[Christian X of Denmark]], and the crown on the reverse. It was made of [[aluminium]] [[bronze]] and shared its design with the krone coin of the time. Its last minting was in 1940 and it was demonetised on 31 December 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.numista.com/catalogue/pieces14514.html|title=½ Krone - Christian X, Denmark|publisher=|accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The present fifty øre coin was introduced into circulation on 3 July 1989 after the demonetisation of the five and ten øre coins. Its obverse features [[Crown of Christian V|the crown]] of King [[Christian V of Denmark]]. The coin is composed of a bronze of 97% [[copper]], 2.5% [[zinc]] and 0.5% [[tin]]. As of January 2018, 50 øre is around 8 US cents.

'''Film noir''' ({{IPAc-en|n|w|ɑːr}}; {{IPA-fr|film nwaʁ|lang}}) is a cinematic term used primarily to describe stylish [[Hollywood]] [[Crime film|crime dramas]], particularly those that emphasize cynical attitudes and sexual motivations. Hollywood's classical film noir period is generally regarded as extending from the early 1940s to the late 1950s. Film noir of this era is associated with a [[low-key lighting|low-key]], [[black-and-white]] visual style that has roots in [[German Expressionism|German Expressionist]] [[cinematography]]. Many of the prototypical stories and much of the attitude of classic noir derive from the [[hardboiled]] school of [[crime fiction]] that emerged in the United States during the [[Great Depression]].

The term ''film noir'', French for "black film" (literal) or "dark film" (closer meaning),&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Biesen (2005), p. 1; Hirsch (2001), p. 9; Lyons (2001), p. 2; Silver and Ward (1992), p. 1; Schatz (1981), p. 112. Outside the field of film noir scholarship, "dark film" is also offered on occasion; see, e.g., Block, Bruce A., ''The Visual Story: Seeing the Structure of Film, TV, and New Media'' (2001), p. 94; Klarer, Mario, ''An Introduction to Literary Studies'' (1999), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; was first applied to Hollywood films by French critic [[Nino Frank]] in 1946, but was unrecognized by most American film industry professionals of that era.&lt;ref&gt;Naremore (2008), pp. 4, 15–16, 18, 41; Ballinger and Graydon (2007), pp. 4–5, 22, 255.&lt;/ref&gt; Cinema historians and critics defined the category retrospectively. Before the notion was widely adopted in the 1970s, many of the classic film noirs{{Ref label|A|a|none}} were referred to as "[[melodrama]]s". Whether film noir qualifies as a distinct [[film genre|genre]] is a matter of ongoing debate among scholars.

Film noir encompasses a range of plots: the central figure may be a private investigator (''[[The Big Sleep (1946 film)|The Big Sleep]]''), a [[Plainclothes law enforcement|plainclothes policeman]] (''[[The Big Heat]]''), an aging boxer (''[[The Set-Up (1949 film)|The Set-Up]]''), a hapless [[Confidence trick|grifter]] (''[[Night and the City]]''), a law-abiding citizen lured into a life of crime (''[[Gun Crazy]]''), or simply a victim of circumstance (''[[D.O.A. (1950 film)|D.O.A.]]''). Although film noir was originally associated with American productions, the term has been used to describe films from around the world. Many films released from the 1960s onward share attributes with film noirs of the classical period, and often treat its conventions [[Self-reference|self-referentially]]. Some refer to such latter-day works as [[neo-noir]]. The clichés of film noir have inspired parody since the mid-1940s.

==Problems of definition==
[[File:The stranger (1946).webm|thumb|''[[The Stranger (1946 film)|The Stranger]]'', full film]]
The questions of what defines film noir, and what sort of category it is, provoke continuing debate.&lt;ref&gt;Ballinger and Graydon (2007), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; "We'd be oversimplifying things in calling film noir [[oneiric (film theory)|oneiric]], strange, erotic, ambivalent, and cruel&amp;nbsp;..."—this set of attributes constitutes the first of many attempts to define film noir made by French critics [[:fr:Raymond Borde|Raymond Borde]] and Étienne Chaumeton in their 1955 book ''Panorama du film noir américain 1941–1953'' (''A Panorama of American Film Noir''), the original and seminal extended treatment of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Borde and Chaumeton (2002), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; They emphasize that not every film noir embodies all five attributes in equal measure—one might be more dreamlike; another, particularly brutal.&lt;ref&gt;Borde and Chaumeton (2002), pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors' caveats and repeated efforts at alternative definition have been echoed in subsequent scholarship: in the more than five decades since, there have been innumerable further attempts at definition, yet in the words of cinema historian Mark Bould, film noir remains an "elusive phenomenon&amp;nbsp;... always just out of reach".&lt;ref&gt;Bould (2005), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though film noir is often identified with a visual style, unconventional within a Hollywood context, that emphasizes [[low-key lighting]] and [[Composition (visual arts)|unbalanced compositions]],&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Ballinger and Graydon (2007), p. 4; Bould (2005), p. 12; Place and Peterson (1974).&lt;/ref&gt; films commonly identified as noir evidence a variety of visual approaches, including ones that fit comfortably within the Hollywood mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Naremore (2008), p. 167–68; Irwin (2006), p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; Film noir similarly embraces a variety of genres, from the [[mob film|gangster film]] to the [[police procedural]] to the [[gothic fiction|gothic romance]] to the [[social problem film|social problem picture]]—any example of which from the 1940s and 1950s, now seen as noir's classical era, was likely to be described as a melodrama at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Neale (2000), p. 166; Vernet (1993), p. 2; Naremore (2008), pp. 17, 122, 124, 140; Bould (2005), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

While many critics refer to film noir as a genre itself, others argue that it can be no such thing.&lt;ref&gt;For overview of debate, see, e.g., Bould (2005), pp. 13–23; Telotte (1989), pp. 9–10. For description of noir as a genre, see, e.g., Bould (2005), p. 2; Hirsch (2001), pp. 71–72; Tuska (1984), p. xxiii. For the opposing viewpoint, see, e.g., Neale (2000), p. 164; Ottoson (1981), p. 2; Schrader (1972); Durgnat (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; Film noir is often associated with an urban setting, but many classic noirs take place in small towns, suburbia, rural areas, or on the open road; setting, therefore, cannot be its genre determinant, as with the [[Western (genre)|Western]]. Similarly, while the [[private investigator|private eye]] and the [[femme fatale]] are character types conventionally identified with noir, the majority of film noirs feature neither; so there is no character basis for genre designation as with the gangster film. Nor does film noir rely on anything as evident as the monstrous or supernatural elements of the [[horror film]], the speculative leaps of the [[science fiction film]], or the song-and-dance routines of the [[musical film|musical]].&lt;ref&gt;Ottoson (1981), pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

An analogous case is that of the [[screwball comedy film|screwball comedy]], widely accepted by film historians as constituting a "genre": the screwball is defined not by a fundamental attribute, but by a general disposition and a group of elements, some—but rarely and perhaps never all—of which are found in each of the genre's films.&lt;ref&gt;See Dancyger and Rush (2002), p. 68, for a detailed comparison of screwball comedy and film noir.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the diversity of noir (much greater than that of the screwball comedy), certain scholars in the field, such as film historian Thomas Schatz, treat it as not a genre but a "style".&lt;ref&gt;Schatz (1981), pp. 111–15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alain Silver]], the most widely published American critic specializing in film noir studies, refers to film noir as a "cycle"&lt;ref&gt;Silver (1996), pp. 4, 6 passim. See also Bould (2005), pp. 3, 4; Hirsch (2001), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; and a "phenomenon",&lt;ref&gt;Silver (1996), pp. 3, 6 passim. See also Place and Peterson (1974).&lt;/ref&gt; even as he argues that it has—like certain genres—a consistent set of visual and thematic codes.&lt;ref&gt;Silver (1996), pp. 7–10.&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics treat film noir as a "mood",&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Jones (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; characterize it as a "series",&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Borde and Chaumeton (2002), pp. 1–7 passim.&lt;/ref&gt; or simply address a chosen set of films they regard as belonging to the noir "canon".&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Telotte (1989), pp. 10–11, 15 passim.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no consensus on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;For survey of the lexical variety, see Naremore (2008), pp. 9, 311–12 n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Cinematic sources===
[[File:Marlene Dietrich circa 1930 (cropped).png|thumb|left|[[Marlene Dietrich]], an actress frequently called upon to play a [[femme fatale]]]]

The aesthetics of film noir are influenced by [[German Expressionism]], an artistic movement of the 1910s and 1920s that involved theater, photography, painting, sculpture and architecture, as well as cinema. The opportunities offered by the booming Hollywood film industry and then the threat of [[Nazism|Nazi]]sm, led to the emigration of many film artists working in Germany who had been involved in the Expressionist movement or studied with its practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Bould (2005), pp. 24–33.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[M (1931 film)|M]]'' (1931), shot only a few years before director [[Fritz Lang]]'s departure from Germany, is among the first crime films of the [[Sound film|sound era]] to join a characteristically noirish visual style with a noir-type plot, in which the protagonist is a criminal (as are his most successful pursuers). Directors such as Lang, [[Robert Siodmak]] and [[Michael Curtiz]] brought a dramatically shadowed lighting style and a psychologically expressive approach to visual composition (''[[mise en scène|mise-en-scène]]''), with them to Hollywood, where they made some of the most famous classic noirs.&lt;ref&gt;Ballinger and Graydon (2007), pp. 9–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1931, Curtiz had already been in Hollywood for half a decade, making as many as six films a year. Movies of his such as ''[[20,000 Years in Sing Sing]]'' (1932) and ''[[Private Detective 62]]'' (1933) are among the early Hollywood sound films arguably classifiable as noir—scholar Marc Vernet offers the latter as evidence that dating the initiation of film noir to 1940 or any other year is "arbitrary".&lt;ref&gt;Vernet (1993), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Expressionism-orientated filmmakers had free stylistic rein in [[Universal Studios|Universal]] horror pictures such as ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' (1931), ''[[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]]'' (1932)—the former [[cinematography|photographed]] and the latter directed by the Berlin-trained [[Karl Freund]]—and ''[[The Black Cat (1934 film)|The Black Cat]]'' (1934), directed by Austrian émigré [[Edgar G. Ulmer]].&lt;ref&gt;Ballinger and Graydon (2007), pp. 11–13.&lt;/ref&gt; The Universal horror film that comes closest to noir, in story and sensibility is ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]'' (1933), directed by Englishman [[James Whale]] and photographed by American [[Arthur Edeson]]. Edeson later photographed ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' (1941), widely regarded as the first major film noir of the classic era.&lt;ref&gt;Davis (2004), p. 194. See also Ballinger and Graydon (2007), p. 133; Ottoson (1981), pp. 110–111. Vernet (1993) notes that the techniques now associated with Expressionism were evident in the American cinema from the mid-1910s (pp. 9–12).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Josef von Sternberg]] was directing in Hollywood during the same period. Films of his such as ''[[Shanghai Express (film)|Shanghai Express]]'' (1932) and ''[[The Devil Is a Woman (1935 film)|The Devil Is a Woman]]'' (1935), with their hothouse eroticism and baroque visual style, anticipated central elements of classic noir. The commercial and critical success of Sternberg's silent ''[[Underworld (1927 film)|Underworld]]'' (1927) was largely responsible for spurring a trend of Hollywood gangster films.&lt;ref&gt;Ballinger and Graydon (2007), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Successful films in that genre such as ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]'' (1931), ''[[The Public Enemy]]'' (1931) and ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]]'' (1932) demonstrated that there was an audience for crime dramas with morally reprehensible protagonists.&lt;ref&gt;Ballinger and Graydon (2007), pp. 6–9; Silver and Ward (1992), pp. 323–24.&lt;/ref&gt; An important, possibly influential, cinematic antecedent to classic noir was 1930s French [[poetic realism]], with its romantic, [[fatalism|fatalistic]] attitude and celebration of doomed heroes.&lt;ref&gt;Spicer (2007), pp. 26, 28; Ballinger and Graydon (2007), pp. 13–15; Bould (2005), pp. 33–40.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement's sensibility is mirrored in the [[Warner Bros.]] drama ''[[I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang]]'' (1932), a forerunner of noir.&lt;ref&gt;McGarry (1980), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Among films not considered film noirs, perhaps none had a greater effect on the development of the genre than ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941), directed by [[Orson Welles]]. Its visual intricacy and complex, [[voiceover]] narrative structure are echoed in dozens of classic film noirs.&lt;ref&gt;Ballinger and Graydon (2007), p. 20; Schatz (1981), pp. 116–22; Ottoson (1981), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Italian neorealism]] of the 1940s, with its emphasis on quasi-documentary authenticity, was an acknowledged influence on trends that emerged in American noir. ''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]'' (1945), directed by [[Billy Wilder]], another Vienna-born, Berlin-trained American [[auteur]], tells the story of an alcoholic in a manner evocative of neorealism.&lt;ref&gt;Biesen (2005), p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; It also exemplifies the problem of classification: one of the first American films to be described as a film noir, it has largely disappeared from considerations of the field.&lt;ref&gt;Naremore (2008), pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[Jules Dassin]] of ''[[The Naked City]]'' (1948) pointed to the neorealists as inspiring his use of location photography with non-professional extras. This [[semidocumentary]] approach characterized a substantial number of noirs in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Along with neorealism, the style had an American precedent cited by Dassin, in director [[Henry Hathaway]]'s ''[[The House on 92nd Street]]'' (1945), which demonstrated the parallel influence of the cinematic newsreel.&lt;ref&gt;Krutnik, Neale, and Neve (2008), pp. 147–148; Macek and Silver (1980), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary literary influence on film noir was the [[History of crime fiction#Hardboiled American crime fiction writing|hardboiled]] school of American [[detective fiction|detective]] and [[crime fiction]], led in its early years by such writers as [[Dashiell Hammett]] (whose first novel, ''[[Red Harvest]]'', was published in 1929) and [[James M. Cain]] (whose ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (novel)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'' appeared five years later), and popularized in [[pulp magazine]]s such as ''[[Black Mask (magazine)|Black Mask]]''. The classic film noirs ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' (1941) and ''[[The Glass Key (1942 film)|The Glass Key]]'' (1942) were based on novels by Hammett; Cain's novels provided the basis for ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' (1944), ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' (1945), ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946 film)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'' (1946), and ''[[Slightly Scarlet (1956 film)|Slightly Scarlet]]'' (1956; adapted from ''Love's Lovely Counterfeit''). A decade before the classic era, a story by Hammett was the source for the gangster melodrama ''[[City Streets (1931 film)|City Streets]]'' (1931), directed by [[Rouben Mamoulian]] and photographed by [[Lee Garmes]], who worked regularly with Sternberg. Released the month before Lang's ''M'', ''City Streets'' has a claim to being the first major film noir; both its style and story had many noir characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Ballinger and Graydon (2007), p. 6; Macek (1980), pp. 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Raymond Chandler]], who debuted as a novelist with ''[[The Big Sleep]]'' in 1939, soon became the most famous author of the hardboiled school. Not only were Chandler's novels turned into major noirs—''[[Murder, My Sweet]]'' (1944; adapted from ''[[Farewell, My Lovely]]''), ''[[The Big Sleep (1946 film)|The Big Sleep]]'' (1946), and ''[[Lady in the Lake]]'' (1947)—he was an important [[screenwriter]] in the genre as well, producing the scripts for ''Double Indemnity'', ''[[The Blue Dahlia]]'' (1946), and ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' (1951). Where Chandler, like Hammett, centered most of his novels and stories on the character of the private eye, Cain featured less heroic protagonists and focused more on psychological exposition than on crime solving;&lt;ref&gt;Irwin (2006), pp. 71, 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt; the Cain approach has come to be identified with a subset of the hardboiled genre dubbed "[[noir fiction]]". For much of the 1940s, one of the most prolific and successful authors of this often downbeat brand of suspense tale was [[Cornell Woolrich]] (sometimes under the pseudonym George Hopley or William Irish). No writer's published work provided the basis for more film noirs of the classic period than Woolrich's: thirteen in all, including ''[[Black Angel (1946 film)|Black Angel]]'' (1946), ''[[Deadline at Dawn]]'' (1946), and ''[[Fear in the Night (1947 film)|Fear in the Night]]'' (1947).&lt;ref&gt;Irwin (2006), pp. 123–24, 129–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another crucial literary source for film noir was [[William R. Burnett|W. R. Burnett]], whose first novel to be published was ''Little Caesar'', in 1929. It was turned into a hit for [[Warner Bros.]] in 1931; the following year, Burnett was hired to write dialogue for ''Scarface'', while ''[[The Beast of the City]]'' (1932) was adapted from one of his stories. At least one important reference work identifies the latter as a film noir despite its early date.&lt;ref&gt;White (1980), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Burnett's characteristic narrative approach fell somewhere between that of the quintessential hardboiled writers and their noir fiction compatriots—his protagonists were often heroic in their own way, which happened to be that of the gangster. During the classic era, his work, either as author or screenwriter, was the basis for seven films now widely regarded as film noirs, including three of the most famous: ''[[High Sierra (film)|High Sierra]]'' (1941), ''[[This Gun for Hire]]'' (1942), and ''[[The Asphalt Jungle]]'' (1950).&lt;ref&gt;Irwin (2006), pp. 97–98, 188–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classic period==

===Overview===
The 1940s and 1950s are generally regarded as the "classic period" of American ''film noir''. While ''City Streets'' and other pre-WWII crime melodramas such as ''[[Fury (1936 film)|Fury]]'' (1936) and ''[[You Only Live Once (1937 film)|You Only Live Once]]'' (1937), both directed by Fritz Lang, are categorized as full-fledged ''noir'' in Alain Silver and Elizabeth Ward's ''film noir'' encyclopedia, other critics tend to describe them as "proto-noir" or in similar terms.&lt;ref&gt;Silver and Ward (1992), p.  333, as well as entries on individual films, pp. 59–60, 109–10, 320–21. For description of ''City Streets'' as "proto-noir", see Turan (2008). For description of ''Fury'' as "proto-noir", see Machura, Stefan, and Peter Robson, ''Law and Film'' (2001), p. 13. For description of ''You Only Live Once'' as "pre-noir", see Ballinger and Graydon (2007), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film now most commonly cited as the first "true" ''film noir'' is ''[[Stranger on the Third Floor]]'' (1940), directed by Latvian-born, Soviet-trained [[Boris Ingster]].&lt;ref name=3d&gt;See, e.g., Ballinger and Graydon (2007), p. 19; Irwin (2006), p. 210; Lyons (2000), p. 36; Porfirio (1980), p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; Hungarian émigré [[Peter Lorre]]—who had starred in Lang's ''[[M (1931 film)|M]]''—was top-billed, although he did not play the primary lead. He later played [[character actor|secondary roles]] in several other formative American noirs. Although modestly budgeted, at the high end of the [[B movie]] scale, ''Stranger on the Third Floor'' still lost its studio, [[RKO]], US$56,000 ({{Inflation|US|56000|1940|fmt=eq}}), almost a third of its total cost.&lt;ref&gt;Biesen (2005), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine found Ingster's work: "...too studied and when original, lacks the flare to hold attention. It's a film too arty for average audiences, and too humdrum for others."&lt;ref&gt;''Variety'' (1940).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Stranger on the Third Floor'' was not recognized as the beginning of a trend, let alone a new genre, for many decades.&lt;ref name=3d/&gt;

Most film noirs of the classic period were similarly low- and modestly-budgeted features without major stars—B movies either literally or in spirit. In this production context, writers, directors, cinematographers, and other craftsmen were relatively free from typical big-picture constraints. There was more visual experimentation than in Hollywood filmmaking as a whole: the Expressionism now closely associated with noir and the semi-documentary style that later emerged represent two very different tendencies. Narrative structures sometimes involved convoluted flashbacks uncommon in non-noir commercial productions. In terms of content, enforcement of the [[Production Code]] ensured that no film character could literally get away with murder or be seen sharing a bed with anyone but a spouse; within those bounds, however, many films now identified as noir feature plot elements and dialogue that were very risqué for the time.&lt;ref&gt;Ballinger and Graydon (2007), p. 4, 19–26, 28–33; Hirsch (2001), pp. 1–21; Schatz (1981), pp. 111–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film stars noir icons [[Robert Mitchum]] and [[Jane Greer]].]]
Thematically, film noirs were most exceptional for the relative frequency with which they centered on women of questionable virtue—a focus that had become rare in Hollywood films after the mid-1930s and the end of the [[Pre-Code Hollywood|pre-Code]] era. The signal film in this vein was ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'', directed by Billy Wilder; setting the mold was [[Barbara Stanwyck]]'s unforgettable [[femme fatale]], Phyllis Dietrichson—an apparent nod to [[Marlene Dietrich]], who had built her extraordinary career playing such characters for Sternberg. An A-level feature all the way, the film's commercial success and seven [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations made it probably the most influential of the early noirs.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Naremore (2008), pp. 81, 319 n. 13; Ballinger and Graydon (2007), pp. 86–88.&lt;/ref&gt; A slew of now-renowned noir "[[bad girl movies|bad girls]]" followed, such as those played by [[Rita Hayworth]] in ''[[Gilda]]'' (1946), [[Lana Turner]] in ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946 film)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'' (1946), [[Ava Gardner]] in ''[[The Killers (1946 film)|The Killers]]'' (1946), and [[Jane Greer]] in ''[[Out of the Past]]'' (1947). The iconic noir counterpart to the femme fatale, the private eye, came to the fore in films such as ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' (1941), with [[Humphrey Bogart]] as [[Sam Spade]], and ''[[Murder, My Sweet]]'' (1944), with [[Dick Powell]] as [[Philip Marlowe]].

The prevalence of the private eye as a lead character declined in film noir of the 1950s, a period during which several critics describe the form as becoming more focused on extreme psychologies and more exaggerated in general.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Ballinger and Graydon (2007), p. 30; Hirsch (2001), pp. 12, 202; Schrader (1972), pp. 59–61 [in Silver and Ursini].&lt;/ref&gt; A prime example is ''[[Kiss Me Deadly]]'' (1955); based on a novel by [[Mickey Spillane]], the best-selling of all the hardboiled authors, here the protagonist is a private eye, [[Mike Hammer]]. As described by [[Paul Schrader]], "[[Robert Aldrich]]'s teasing direction carries ''noir'' to its sleaziest and most perversely erotic. Hammer overturns the underworld in search of the 'great whatsit' [which] turns out to be—joke of jokes—an exploding atomic bomb."&lt;ref&gt;Schrader (1972), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Orson Welles's baroquely styled ''[[Touch of Evil]]'' (1958) is frequently cited as the last noir of the classic period.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Silver (1996), p. 11; Ottoson (1981), pp. 182–183; Schrader (1972), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars believe film noir never really ended, but continued to transform even as the characteristic noir visual style began to seem dated and changing production conditions led Hollywood in different directions—in this view, post-1950s films in the noir tradition are seen as part of a continuity with classic noir.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Ballinger and Graydon (2007), pp. 19–53.&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of critics, however, regard comparable films made outside the classic era to be something other than genuine film noirs. They regard true film noir as belonging to a temporally and geographically limited cycle or period, treating subsequent films that evoke the classics as fundamentally different due to general shifts in filmmaking style and latter-day awareness of noir as a historical source for [[allusion]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Hirsch (2001), pp. 10, 202–7; Silver and Ward (1992), p. 6 (though they phrase their position more ambiguously on p. 398); Ottoson (1981), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the inceptive noir, ''Stranger on the Third Floor'', was a B picture directed by a virtual unknown, many of the film noirs still remembered were A-list productions by well-known film makers. Debuting as a director with ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' (1941), [[John Huston]] followed with ''[[Key Largo (film)|Key Largo]]'' (1948) and ''[[The Asphalt Jungle]]'' (1950). Opinion is divided on the noir status of several [[Alfred Hitchcock]] thrillers from the era; at least four qualify by consensus: ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' (1943), ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946), ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' (1951) and ''[[The Wrong Man]]'' (1956).&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., entries on individual films in Ballinger and Graydon (2007), pp. 34, 190–92; Silver and Ward (1992), pp. 214–15; 253–54, 269–70, 318–19.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Otto Preminger]]'s success with ''[[Laura (1944 film)|Laura]]'' (1944) made his name and helped demonstrate noir's adaptability to a high-gloss [[20th Century-Fox]] presentation.&lt;ref&gt;Biesen (2005), p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Among Hollywood's most celebrated directors of the era, arguably none worked more often in a noir mode than Preminger; his other noirs include ''[[Fallen Angel (1945 film)|Fallen Angel]]'' (1945), ''[[Whirlpool (1949 film)|Whirlpool]]'' (1949), ''[[Where the Sidewalk Ends (film)|Where the Sidewalk Ends]]'' (1950) (all for Fox) and ''[[Angel Face (1952 film)|Angel Face]]'' (1952). A half-decade after ''Double Indemnity'' and ''The Lost Weekend'', Billy Wilder made ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' (1950) and ''[[Ace in the Hole (1951 film)|Ace in the Hole]]'' (1951), noirs that were not so much crime dramas as satires on Hollywood and the news media. ''[[In a Lonely Place]]'' (1950) was [[Nicholas Ray]]'s breakthrough; his other noirs include his debut, ''[[They Live by Night]]'' (1948) and ''[[On Dangerous Ground]]'' (1952), noted for their unusually sympathetic treatment of characters alienated from the social mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;Ballinger and Graydon (2007), pp. 188, 202–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lady from Shanghai trailer rita hayworth6.JPG|thumb|left|[[Rita Hayworth]] in the trailer for ''[[The Lady from Shanghai]]'' (1947).]]
Orson Welles had notorious problems with financing but his three film noirs were well budgeted: ''[[The Lady from Shanghai]]'' (1947) received top-level, "prestige" backing, while ''The Stranger'', his most conventional film and ''Touch of Evil'', an unmistakably personal work, were funded at levels lower but still commensurate with headlining releases.&lt;ref&gt;For overview of Welles's noirs, see, e.g., Ballinger and Graydon (2007), pp. 210–11. For specific production circumstances, see Brady, Frank, ''Citizen Welles: A Biography of Orson Welles'' (1989), pp. 395–404, 378–81, 496–512.&lt;/ref&gt;  Like ''The Stranger'', Fritz Lang's ''[[The Woman in the Window]]'' (1945) was a production of the independent International Pictures. Lang's follow-up, ''[[Scarlet Street]]'' (1945), was one of the few classic noirs to be officially censored: filled with erotic innuendo, it was temporarily banned in Milwaukee, Atlanta and New York State.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Scarlet Street'' was a semi-independent, cosponsored by [[Universal Studios|Universal]] and Lang's Diana Productions, of which the film's co-star, [[Joan Bennett]], was the second biggest shareholder. Lang, Bennett and her husband, the Universal veteran and Diana production head [[Walter Wanger]], made ''[[Secret Beyond the Door]]'' (1948) in similar fashion.&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan (1997), pp. 314–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before leaving the United States while subject to the [[Hollywood Blacklist]], Jules Dassin made two classic noirs that also straddled the major–independent line: ''[[Brute Force (1947 film)|Brute Force]]'' (1947) and the influential documentary-style ''[[The Naked City]]'' were developed by producer [[Mark Hellinger]], who had an "inside/outside" contract with Universal similar to Wanger's.&lt;ref&gt;Schatz (1998), pp. 354–58.&lt;/ref&gt; Years earlier, working at Warner Bros., Hellinger had produced three films for [[Raoul Walsh]], the proto-noirs ''[[They Drive by Night]]'' (1940), ''[[Manpower (1941 film)|Manpower]]'' (1941) and ''[[High Sierra (film)|High Sierra]]'' (1941), now regarded as a seminal work in noir's development.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Schatz (1981), pp. 103, 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Walsh had no great name during his half-century as a director but his noirs ''[[White Heat]]'' (1949) and ''[[The Enforcer (1951 film)|The Enforcer]]'' (1951) had A-list stars and are seen as important examples of the cycle.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., entries on individual films in Silver and Ward (1992), pp. 97–98, 125–26, 311–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Other directors associated with top-of-the-bill Hollywood film noirs include [[Edward Dmytryk]] (''[[Murder, My Sweet]]'' [1944], ''[[Crossfire (film)|Crossfire]]'' [1947])—the first important noir director to fall prey to the industry blacklist—as well as [[Henry Hathaway]] (''[[The Dark Corner]]'' [1946], ''[[Kiss of Death (1947 film)|Kiss of Death]]'' [1947]) and [[John Farrow]] (''[[The Big Clock (1948 film)|The Big Clock]]'' [1948], ''[[Night Has a Thousand Eyes]]'' [1948]).

Most of the Hollywood films considered to be classic noirs fall into the category of the "[[B movie]]".&lt;ref&gt;See Naremore (2008), pp. 140–55, on "B Pictures versus Intermediates".&lt;/ref&gt; Some were Bs in the most precise sense, produced to run on the bottom of [[double feature|double bills]] by a low-budget unit of one of the [[studio system|major studios]] or by one of the smaller [[Poverty Row]] outfits, from the relatively well-off [[Monogram Pictures|Monogram]] to shakier ventures such as [[Producers Releasing Corporation|Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC)]]. [[Jacques Tourneur]] had made over thirty Hollywood Bs (a few now highly regarded, most forgotten) before directing the A-level ''Out of the Past'', described by scholar Robert Ottoson as "the ''ne plus ultra'' of forties film noir".&lt;ref&gt;Ottoson (1981), p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Movies with budgets a step up the ladder, known as "intermediates" by the industry, might be treated as A or B pictures depending on the circumstances. Monogram created [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]] in the late 1940s to focus on this sort of production. [[Robert Wise]] (''[[Born to Kill (1947 film)|Born to Kill]]'' [1947], ''[[The Set-Up (1949 film)|The Set-Up]]'' [1949]) and [[Anthony Mann]] (''[[T-Men]]'' [1947] and ''[[Raw Deal (1948 film)|Raw Deal]]'' [1948]) each made a series of impressive intermediates, many of them noirs, before graduating to steady work on big-budget productions. Mann did some of his most celebrated work with cinematographer [[John Alton]], a specialist in what James Naremore called "hypnotic moments of light-in-darkness".&lt;ref&gt;Naremore (2008), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[He Walked by Night]]'' (1948), shot by Alton and though credited solely to Alfred Werker, directed in large part by Mann, demonstrates their technical mastery and exemplifies the late 1940s trend of "[[police procedural]]" crime dramas. It was released, like other Mann-Alton noirs, by the small [[Eagle-Lion Films|Eagle-Lion]] company; it was the inspiration for the ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]'' series, which debuted on radio in 1949 and television in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Hayde (2001), pp. 3–4, 15–21, 37.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:DetourPoster1.jpg|thumb|250px|left|alt=Movie poster with a border of diagonal black and white bands. On the upper right is a tagline: "He went searching for love&amp;nbsp;... but fate forced a DETOUR to ''Revelry&amp;nbsp;... Violence&amp;nbsp;... Mystery!''" The image is a collage of stills: a man playing the clarinet; a smiling man and woman in evening dress; the same man, with a horrified expression, holding the body of another man with a bloody head injury; the body of a woman, asleep or dead, splayed out over the end of a bed, a telephone beside her; leaning against either side of a lamppost, the same man a third time, wearing a green suit and tie and holding a cigarette, and a woman wearing a knee-length red dress and black pumps, smoking. Credits at the bottom feature the names of three actors: Tom Neal, Ann Savage, and Claudia Drake.|''[[Detour (1945 film)|Detour]]'' (1945) cost $117,000 to make when the biggest Hollywood studios spent around $600,000 on the average feature. Produced at small [[Producers Releasing Corporation|PRC]], however, the film was 30 percent over budget.&lt;ref&gt;Erickson (2004), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Several directors associated with noir built well-respected oeuvres largely at the B-movie/intermediate level. [[Samuel Fuller]]'s brutal, visually energetic films such as ''[[Pickup on South Street]]'' (1953) and ''[[Underworld U.S.A.]]'' (1961) earned him a unique reputation; his advocates praise him as "primitive" and "barbarous".&lt;ref&gt;Sarris (1985), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomson (1998), p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph H. Lewis (director)|Joseph H. Lewis]] directed noirs as diverse as ''[[Gun Crazy]]'' (1950) and ''[[The Big Combo]]'' (1955). The former—whose screenplay was written by the blacklisted [[Dalton Trumbo]], disguised by a front—features a bank hold-up sequence shown in an unbroken take of over three minutes that was influential.&lt;ref&gt;Naremore (2008), pp. 128, 150–51; Ballinger and Graydon (2007), pp. 97–99.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Big Combo'' was shot by John Alton and took the shadowy noir style to its outer limits.&lt;ref&gt;Ballinger and Graydon (2007), pp. 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt; The most distinctive films of [[Phil Karlson]] (''[[The Phenix City Story]]'' [1955] and ''[[The Brothers Rico]]'' [1957]) tell stories of vice organized on a monstrous scale.&lt;ref&gt;Clarens (1980), pp. 245–47.&lt;/ref&gt; The work of other directors in this tier of the industry, such as [[Felix E. Feist]] (''[[The Devil Thumbs a Ride]]'' [1947], ''[[Tomorrow Is Another Day (1951 American film)|Tomorrow Is Another Day]]'' [1951]), has become obscure. [[Edgar G. Ulmer]] spent most of his Hollywood career working at B studios and once in a while on projects that achieved intermediate status; for the most part, on unmistakable Bs. In 1945, while at PRC, he directed a noir cult classic, ''[[Detour (1945 film)|Detour]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Ballinger and Graydon (2007), pp. 83–85; Ottoson (1981), pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; Ulmer's other noirs include ''[[Strange Illusion]]'' (1945), also for PRC; ''[[Ruthless (film)|Ruthless]]'' (1948), for Eagle-Lion, which had acquired PRC the previous year and ''[[Murder Is My Beat]]'' (1955), for Allied Artists.

A number of low- and modestly-budgeted noirs were made by independent, often actor-owned, companies contracting with larger studios for distribution. Serving as producer, writer, director and top-billed performer, [[Hugo Haas]] made films like ''[[Pickup (film)|Pickup]]'' (1951) and ''[[The Other Woman (1954 film)|The Other Woman]]'' (1954). It was in this way that accomplished noir actress [[Ida Lupino]] established herself as the sole female director in Hollywood during the late 1940s and much of the 1950s. She does not appear in the best-known film she directed, ''[[The Hitch-Hiker]]'' (1953), developed by her company, The Filmakers, with support and distribution by RKO.&lt;ref&gt;Muller (1998), pp. 176–77.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the seven classic film noirs produced largely outside of the major studios that have been chosen for the United States [[National Film Registry]]. Of the others, one was a small-studio release:  ''Detour''. Four were independent productions distributed by [[United Artists]], the "studio without a studio": ''Gun Crazy''; ''Kiss Me Deadly''; ''[[D.O.A. (1949 film)|D.O.A.]]'' (1950), directed by [[Rudolph Maté]] and ''[[Sweet Smell of Success]]'' (1957), directed by [[Alexander Mackendrick]]. One was an independent distributed by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]], the industry leader: ''[[Force of Evil]]'' (1948), directed by [[Abraham Polonsky]] and starring [[John Garfield]], both of whom were blacklisted in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Krutnik, Neale, and Neve (2008), pp. 259–60, 262–63.&lt;/ref&gt; Independent production usually meant restricted circumstances but ''Sweet Smell of Success'', despite the plans of the production team, was clearly not made on the cheap, though like many other cherished A-budget noirs, it might be said to have a B-movie soul.&lt;ref&gt;See Mackendrick (2006), pp. 119–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps no director better displayed that spirit than the German-born [[Robert Siodmak]], who had already made a score of films before his 1940 arrival in Hollywood. Working mostly on A features, he made eight films now regarded as classic-era film noirs (a figure matched only by Lang and Mann).&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Silver and Ward (1992), pp. 338–39. Ottoson (1981) also lists two period pieces directed by Siodmak (''[[The Suspect (1944 film)|The Suspect]]'' [1944] and ''[[The Spiral Staircase (1946 film)|The Spiral Staircase]]'' [1946]) (pp. 173–74, 164–65). Silver and Ward list nine classic-era film noirs by Lang, plus two from the 1930s (pp. 338, 396). Ottoson lists eight (excluding ''[[Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (1956 film)|Beyond a Reasonable Doubt]]'' [1956]), plus the same two from the 1930s (passim). Silver and Ward list seven by Mann (p. 338). Ottoson also lists ''[[Reign of Terror (film)|Reign of Terror]]'' (a.k.a. ''The Black Book''; 1949), set during the French Revolution, for a total of eight (passim). See also Ballinger and Graydon (2007), p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to ''The Killers'', [[Burt Lancaster]]'s debut and a Hellinger/Universal co-production, Siodmak's other important contributions to the genre include 1944's ''[[Phantom Lady (1944 film)|Phantom Lady]]'' (a top-of-the-line B and Woolrich adaptation), the ironically titled ''[[Christmas Holiday]]'' (1944), and ''[[Cry of the City]]'' (1948). ''[[Criss Cross (1949 film)|Criss Cross]]'' (1949), with Lancaster again the lead, exemplifies how Siodmak brought the virtues of the B-movie to the A noir. In addition to the relatively looser constraints on character and message at lower budgets, the nature of B production lent itself to the noir style for economic reasons: dim lighting saved on electricity and helped cloak cheap sets (mist and smoke also served the cause); night shooting was often compelled by hurried production schedules; plots with obscure motivations and intriguingly elliptical transitions were sometimes the consequence of hastily written scripts, of which there was not always enough time or money to shoot every scene. In ''Criss Cross'', Siodmak achieved these effects with purpose, wrapping them around [[Yvonne De Carlo]], playing the most understandable of femme fatales; [[Dan Duryea]], in one of his many charismatic villain roles; and Lancaster as an ordinary laborer turned armed robber, doomed by a romantic obsession.&lt;ref&gt;Clarens (1980), pp. 200–2; Walker (1992), pp. 139–45; Ballinger and Graydon (2007), pp. 77–79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics regard classic film noir as a cycle exclusive to the United States; Alain Silver and Elizabeth Ward, for example, argue, "With the Western, film noir shares the distinction of being an indigenous American form&amp;nbsp;... a wholly American film style."&lt;ref&gt;Silver and Ward (1992), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; However, although the term "film noir" was originally coined to describe Hollywood movies, it was an international phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;See Palmer (2004), pp. 267–68, for a representative discussion of film noir as an international phenomenon.&lt;/ref&gt; Even before the beginning of the generally accepted classic period, there were films made far from Hollywood that can be seen in retrospect as film noirs, for example, the French productions ''[[Pépé le Moko]]'' (1937), directed by [[Julien Duvivier]], and ''[[Le Jour se lève]]'' (1939), directed by [[Marcel Carné]].&lt;ref&gt;Spicer (2007), pp. 5–6, 26, 28, 59; Ballinger and Graydon (2007), pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Mexico]] experienced a vibrant film noir period from roughly 1946 to 1952, which was around the same time film noir was blossoming in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Kristin|date=2015-07-21|accessdate=2018-04-30|title=A Series on Mexican Noir Films Illuminates a Dark Genre|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-series-on-mexican-noir-films-illuminates-a-dark-genre-1437513037|publisher=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the classic period, there were many films produced in Europe, particularly in France, that share elements of style, theme, and sensibility with American film noirs and may themselves be included in the genre's canon. In certain cases, the interrelationship with Hollywood noir is obvious: American-born director [[Jules Dassin]] moved to France in the early 1950s as a result of the [[Hollywood blacklist]], and made one of the most famous French film noirs, ''[[Rififi]]'' (1955). Other well-known French films often classified as noir include ''[[Quai des Orfèvres]]'' (1947)  and ''[[Les Diaboliques (film)|Les Diaboliques]]'' (1955), both directed by [[Henri-Georges Clouzot]]. ''[[Casque d'Or]]'' (1952), ''[[Touchez pas au grisbi]]'' (1954), and [[Le Trou]] (1960) directed by [[Jacques Becker]]; and ''[[Ascenseur pour l'échafaud]]'' (1958), directed by [[Louis Malle]]. French director [[Jean-Pierre Melville]] is widely recognized for his tragic, minimalist film noirs—''[[Bob le flambeur]]'' (1955), from the classic period, was followed by ''[[Le Doulos]]'' (1962), ''[[Le deuxième souffle (1966 film)|Le deuxième souffle]]'' (1966), ''[[Le Samouraï]]'' (1967), and ''[[Le Cercle rouge]]'' (1970).&lt;ref&gt;Spicer (2007), pp. 32–39, 43; Ballinger and Graydon (2007), pp. 255–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each man holds a pistol in his right hand.|''[[Stray Dog (film)|Stray Dog]]'' (1949), directed and cowritten by [[Akira Kurosawa]], contains many cinematographic and narrative elements associated with classic American film noir.]]
Scholar Andrew Spicer argues that British film noir evidences a greater debt to French poetic realism than to the expressionistic American mode of noir.&lt;ref&gt;Spicer (2007), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of British noir from the classic period include ''[[Brighton Rock (1947 film)|Brighton Rock]]'' (1947), directed by [[John Boulting]]; ''[[They Made Me a Fugitive]]'' (1947), directed by [[Alberto Cavalcanti]]; ''[[The Small Back Room]]'' (1948), directed by [[Michael Powell]] and [[Emeric Pressburger]]; ''[[The October Man]]'' (1950), directed by [[Roy Ward Baker]]; and ''[[Cast a Dark Shadow]]'' (1955), directed by [[Lewis Gilbert]]. [[Terence Fisher]] directed several low-budget thrillers in a noir mode for [[Hammer Film Productions]], including ''[[The Last Page]]'' (a.k.a. ''Man Bait''; 1952), ''[[Stolen Face]]'' (1952), and ''[[Murder by Proxy]]'' (a.k.a. ''Blackout''; 1954). Before leaving for France, Jules Dassin had been obliged by political pressure to shoot his last English-language film of the classic noir period in Great Britain: ''[[Night and the City]]'' (1950). Though it was conceived in the United States and was not only directed by an American but also stars two American actors—[[Richard Widmark]] and [[Gene Tierney]]—it is technically a UK production, financed by [[20th Century-Fox]]'s British subsidiary. The most famous of classic British noirs is director [[Carol Reed]]'s ''[[The Third Man]]'' (1949), from a screenplay by [[Graham Greene]]. Set in Vienna immediately after World War II, it also stars two American actors, [[Joseph Cotten]] and [[Orson Welles]], who had appeared together in ''Citizen Kane''.&lt;ref&gt;Spicer (2007), pp. 16, 91–94, 96, 100; Ballinger and Graydon (2007), pp. 144, 249–55; Lyons (2000), p. 74, 81, 114–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere, Italian director [[Luchino Visconti]] adapted Cain's ''The Postman Always Rings Twice'' as ''[[Ossessione]]'' (1943), regarded both as one of the great noirs and a seminal film in the development of neorealism.&lt;ref&gt;Spicer (2007), pp. 13, 28, 241; Ballinger and Graydon (2007), pp. 264, 266.&lt;/ref&gt; (This was not even the first screen version of Cain's novel, having been preceded by the French ''[[Le Dernier Tournant]]'' in 1939.)&lt;ref&gt;Spicer (2007), pp. 19 n. 36, 28.&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, the celebrated [[Akira Kurosawa]] directed several films recognizable as film noirs, including ''[[Drunken Angel]]'' (1948), ''[[Stray Dog (film)|Stray Dog]]'' (1949), ''[[The Bad Sleep Well]]'' (1960), and ''[[High and Low (1963 film)|High and Low]]'' (1963).&lt;ref&gt;Ballinger and Graydon (2007), pp. 266–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the first major [[neo-noir]] films—the term often applied to films that consciously refer back to the classic noir tradition—was the French ''[[Shoot the Piano Player|Tirez sur le pianiste]]'' (1960), directed by [[François Truffaut]] from a novel by one of the gloomiest of American noir fiction writers, [[David Goodis]].&lt;ref&gt;Spicer (2007), p. 241; Ballinger and Graydon (2007), p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; Noir crime films and melodramas have been produced in many countries in the post-classic area. Some of these are quintessentially self-aware neo-noirs—for example, ''[[The Conformist (film)|Il Conformista]]'' (1969; Italy), ''[[The American Friend|Der Amerikanische Freund]]'' (1977; Germany), ''[[The Element of Crime]]'' (1984; Denmark), and ''[[El Aura]]'' (2005; Argentina). Others simply share narrative elements and a version of the hardboiled sensibility associated with classic noir, such as ''[[Yoshitaro Nomura|The Castle of Sand]]'' (1974; Japan), ''[[Insomnia (1997 film)|Insomnia]]'' (1997; Norway), ''[[Croupier (film)|Croupier]]'' (1998; UK), and ''[[Blind Shaft]]'' (2003; China).&lt;ref&gt;Ballinger and Graydon (2007), pp. 253, 255, 263–64, 266, 267, 270–74; Abbas (1997), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neo-noir and echoes of the classic mode==
{{See also|Neo-noir}}
The neo-noir film genre developed mid-way into the Cold War. This cinematological trend reflected much of the cynicism and the possibility of nuclear annihilation of the era. This new genre introduced innovations that were not available with the earlier noir films. The violence was also more potent.&lt;ref name="Schwartz"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chapters.scarecrowpress.com/08/108/081085676Xch1.pdf |title=Neo-Noir The New Film Noir Style from Psycho to Collateral |last=Schwartz |first=Ronald |publisher=The Scarecrow Press Inc. |year=2005 |accessdate=2013-03-31|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104224706/http://chapters.scarecrowpress.com/08/108/081085676Xch1.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-04|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960s and 1970s===
While it is hard to draw a line between some of the noir films of the early 1960s such as ''[[Blast of Silence]]'' (1961) and ''[[Cape Fear (1962 film)|Cape Fear]]'' (1962) and the noirs of the late 1950s, new trends emerged in the post-classic era. ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (1962), directed by [[John Frankenheimer]], ''[[Shock Corridor]]'' (1962), directed by [[Samuel Fuller]], and ''[[Brainstorm (1965 film)|Brainstorm]]'' (1965), directed by experienced noir character actor [[William Conrad]], all treat the theme of mental dispossession within stylistic and tonal frameworks derived from classic film noir.&lt;ref name=u284286/&gt; ''The Manchurian Candidate'' examined the situation of [[Korean War POWs detained in North Korea|American prisoners of war]] (POWs) during the [[Korean War]]. Incidents that occurred during the war as well as those post-war, functioned as an inspiration for a "Cold War Noir" subgenre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.koreanconfidential.com/koreanpowfilmnoir.html |title=Cold War Noir and the Other Films about Korean War POWs |accessdate=2013-03-31|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218203603/http://www.koreanconfidential.com/koreanpowfilmnoir.html |last=Sautner|first=Mark|archivedate=2013-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Conway"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.articledestination.com/Article/Korean-War-Film-Noir--the-POW-Movies/12753 |title=Korean War Film Noir: the POW Movies |last=Conway |first=Marianne B. |accessdate=2013-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217064144/http://www.articledestination.com/Article/Korean-War-Film-Noir--the-POW-Movies/12753 |archivedate=2013-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The television series ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'' (1963–67) brought classic noir themes and mood to the small screen for an extended run.&lt;ref name=u284286&gt;Ursini (1995), pp. 284–86; Ballinger and Graydon (2007), p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt;

Here he imitates a characteristic Bogart gesture, one of the film's [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]].&lt;ref&gt;Appel (1974), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In a different vein, films began to appear that self-consciously acknowledged the conventions of classic film noir as historical [[archetypes]] to be revived, rejected, or reimagined. These efforts typify what came to be known as neo-noir.&lt;ref&gt;Ballinger and Graydon (2007), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Though several late classic noirs, ''Kiss Me Deadly'' in particular, were deeply self-knowing and post-traditional in conception, none tipped its hand so evidently as to be remarked on by American critics at the time.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Variety'' (1955). For a latter-day analysis of the film's self-consciousness, see Naremore (2008), pp. 151–55. See also Kolker (2000), p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt; The first major film to overtly work this angle was French director [[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s ''[[À bout de souffle]]'' (''Breathless''; 1960), which pays its literal respects to Bogart and his crime films while brandishing a bold new style for a new day.&lt;ref&gt;Greene (1999), p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, [[Arthur Penn]] (''[[Mickey One]]'' [1964], drawing inspiration from Truffaut's ''Tirez sur le pianiste'' and other [[French New Wave]] films), [[John Boorman]] (''[[Point Blank (1967 film)|Point Blank]]'' [1967], similarly caught up, though in the ''[[French New Wave|Nouvelle vague']]''s deeper waters), and [[Alan J. Pakula]] (''[[Klute]]'' [1971]) directed films that knowingly related themselves to the original film noirs, inviting audiences in on the game.&lt;ref&gt;For ''Mickey One'', see Kolker (2000), pp. 21–22, 26–30. For ''Point Blank'', see Ballinger and Graydon (2007), pp. 36, 38, 41, 257. For ''Klute'', see Ballinger and Graydon (2007), pp. 114–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

A manifest affiliation with noir traditions—which, by its nature, allows different sorts of commentary on them to be inferred—can also provide the basis for explicit critiques of those traditions. In 1973, director [[Robert Altman]] flipped off noir piety with ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]''. Based on the novel by Raymond Chandler, it features one of Bogart's most famous characters, but in [[iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] fashion: Philip Marlowe, the prototypical hardboiled detective, is replayed as a hapless misfit, almost laughably out of touch with contemporary [[mores]] and morality.&lt;ref&gt;Kolker (2000), pp. 344, 363–73; Naremore (2008), pp. 203–5; Ballinger and Graydon (2007), pp. 36, 39, 130–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Where Altman's subversion of the film noir mythos was so irreverent as to outrage some contemporary critics,&lt;ref&gt;Kolker (2000), p. 364; Ballinger and Graydon (2007), p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; around the same time [[Woody Allen]] was paying affectionate, at points idolatrous homage to the classic mode with ''[[Play It Again, Sam (1972 film)|Play It Again, Sam]]'' (1972). The "[[blaxploitation]]" film ''[[Shaft (1971 film)|Shaft]]'' (1971), wherein [[Richard Roundtree]] plays the titular African-American private eye, [[John Shaft]], takes conventions from classic noir.

The most acclaimed of the neo-noirs of the era was director [[Roman Polanski]]'s 1974 ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/the-ten-greatest-neo-noir-films-a7340126.html|title=The ten greatest neo-noir films|date=2016-09-30|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-08-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written by [[Robert Towne]], it is set in 1930s Los Angeles, an accustomed noir locale nudged back some few years in a way that makes the pivotal loss of innocence in the story even crueler. Where Polanski and Towne raised noir to a black apogee by turning rearward, director [[Martin Scorsese]] and screenwriter [[Paul Schrader]] brought the noir attitude crashing into the present day with ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' (1976), a crackling, bloody-minded gloss on bicentennial America.&lt;ref&gt;Kolker (2000), pp. 207–44; Silver and Ward (1992), pp. 282–83; Naremore (1998), pp. 34–37, 192.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, [[Walter Hill (filmmaker)|Walter Hill]] wrote and directed ''[[The Driver]]'', a chase film as might have been imagined by Jean-Pierre Melville in an especially abstract mood.&lt;ref&gt;Silver and Ward (1992), pp. 398–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hill was already a central figure in 1970s noir of a more straightforward manner, having written the script for director [[Sam Peckinpah]]'s ''[[The Getaway (1972 film)|The Getaway]]'' (1972), adapting a novel by pulp master [[Jim Thompson (writer)|Jim Thompson]], as well as for two tough private eye films: an original screenplay for ''[[Hickey &amp; Boggs]]'' (1972) and an adaptation of a novel by [[Ross Macdonald]], the leading literary descendant of Hammett and Chandler, for ''[[The Drowning Pool (film)|The Drowning Pool]]'' (1975). Some of the strongest 1970s noirs, in fact, were unwinking remakes of the classics, "neo" mostly by default: the heartbreaking ''[[Thieves Like Us (film)|Thieves Like Us]]'' (1973), directed by Altman from the same source as Ray's ''They Live by Night'', and ''[[Farewell, My Lovely (1975 film)|Farewell, My Lovely]]'' (1975), the Chandler tale made classically as ''Murder, My Sweet'', remade here with Robert Mitchum in his last notable noir role.&lt;ref&gt;For ''Thieves Like Us'', see Kolker (2000), pp. 358–63. For ''Farewell, My Lovely'', see Kirgo (1980), pp. 101–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Detective series, prevalent on American television during the period, updated the hardboiled tradition in different ways, but the show conjuring the most noir tone was a horror crossover touched with shaggy, ''Long Goodbye''–style humor: ''[[Kolchak: The Night Stalker]]'' (1974–75), featuring a Chicago newspaper reporter investigating strange, usually supernatural occurrences.&lt;ref&gt;Ursini (1995), p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s and 1990s===

The turn of the decade brought Scorsese's black-and-white ''[[Raging Bull]]'' (cowritten by Schrader); an acknowledged masterpiece—the [[American Film Institute]] ranks it as the greatest American film of the 1980s and the fourth greatest of all time—it is also a retreat, telling a story of a boxer's moral self-destruction that recalls in both theme and visual ambience noir dramas such as ''[[Body and Soul (1947 film)|Body and Soul]]'' (1947) and ''[[Champion (1949 film)|Champion]]'' (1949).&lt;ref&gt;For AFI ranking, see {{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/100Years/movies10.aspx|title=AFI's 100 Years&amp;nbsp;... 100 Movies—10th Anniversary Edition|publisher=American Film Institute|year=2007|accessdate=2012-04-19}} For kinship to classic noir boxing films, see Muller (1998), pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1981, the popular ''[[Body Heat]]'', written and directed by [[Lawrence Kasdan]], invokes a different set of classic noir elements, this time in a humid, erotically charged Florida setting; its success confirmed the commercial viability of neo-noir, at a time when the major Hollywood studios were becoming increasingly risk averse. The mainstreaming of neo-noir is evident in such films as ''[[Black Widow (1987 film)|Black Widow]]'' (1987), ''[[Shattered (1991 film)|Shattered]]'' (1991), and ''[[Final Analysis]]'' (1992).&lt;ref&gt;Silver and Ward (1992), pp. 400–1, 408.&lt;/ref&gt; Few neo-noirs have made more money or more wittily updated the tradition of the noir double-entendre than ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' (1992), directed by [[Paul Verhoeven]] and written by [[Joe Eszterhas]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Grothe, Mardy, ''Viva la Repartee: Clever Comebacks and Witty Retorts from History's Great Wits &amp; Wordsmiths'' (2005), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; The film also demonstrates how neo-noir's polychrome palette can reproduce many of the expressionistic effects of classic black-and-white noir.&lt;ref name=W209/&gt;

Among big-budget auteurs, [[Michael Mann (film director)|Michael Mann]] has worked frequently in a neo-noir mode, with such films as ''[[Thief (film)|Thief]]'' (1981) and ''[[Heat (1995 film)|Heat]]'' (1995) and the TV series ''[[Miami Vice]]'' (1984–89) and ''[[Crime Story (TV series)|Crime Story]]'' (1986–88). Mann's output exemplifies a primary strain of neo-noir, in which classic themes and tropes are revisited in a contemporary setting with an up-to-date visual style and [[Rock music|rock]]- or [[Hip hop music|hip hop]]-based musical [[soundtrack]].&lt;ref&gt;Ballinger and Graydon (2007), pp. 44, 47, 279–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Like ''Chinatown'', its more complex predecessor, [[Curtis Hanson]]'s Oscar-winning ''[[L.A. Confidential (film)|L.A. Confidential]]'' (1997), based on the [[James Ellroy]] novel, demonstrates an opposite tendency—the deliberately retro film noir; its tale of corrupt cops and femmes fatales is seemingly lifted straight from a film of 1953, the year in which it is set.&lt;ref&gt;Naremore (2008), p. 275; Wager (2005), p. 83; Hanson (2008), p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[David Fincher]] followed the immensely successful neo-noir ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'' (1995) with a film that developed into a cult favorite after its original, disappointing release: ''[[Fight Club]]'' (1999) is a ''[[sui generis]]'' mix of noir aesthetic, perverse comedy, speculative content, and satiric intent.&lt;ref&gt;Wager (2005), p. 101–14.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{listen|filename=Dub Driving Sample from Lost Highway CD (Interscope Records).ogg|title="Dub Driving"| description= [[Angelo Badalamenti]] has scored most of [[David Lynch]]'s noir-related work. His work on this track typifies a "modern noir" style, which the director explicitly sought for ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]'' (1997).&lt;ref&gt;Lynch and Rodley (2005), p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Working generally with much smaller budgets, brothers [[Joel and Ethan Coen]] have created one of the most extensive film oeuvres influenced by classic noir, with films such as ''[[Blood Simple]]'' (1984) and ''[[Fargo (film)|Fargo]]'' (1996), considered by some a supreme work in the neo-noir mode.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch (1999), pp. 245–47; Maslin (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; The Coens cross noir with other generic lines in the gangster drama ''[[Miller's Crossing]]'' (1990)—loosely based on the Dashiell Hammett novels ''Red Harvest'' and ''[[The Glass Key]]''—and the comedy ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'' (1998), a tribute to Chandler and an homage to Altman's version of ''The Long Goodbye''.&lt;ref&gt;For ''Miller's Crossing'', see Martin (1997), p. 157; Naremore (2008), p. 214–15; {{cite web|author=Barra, Allen|url=http://dir.salon.com/story/books/feature/2005/02/28/hammett/index.html|title=From 'Red Harvest' to 'Deadwood'|publisher=Salon|date=2005-02-28|accessdate=2009-09-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330053905/http://dir.salon.com/story/books/feature/2005/02/28/hammett/index.html|archivedate=2010-03-30|df=}} For ''The Big Lebowski'', see Tyree and Walters (2007), pp. 40, 43–44, 48, 51, 65, 111; Ballinger and Graydon (2007), p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; The characteristic work of [[David Lynch]] combines film noir tropes with scenarios driven by disturbed characters such as the sociopathic criminal played by [[Dennis Hopper]] in ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' (1986) and the delusionary protagonist of ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]'' (1997). The ''Twin Peaks'' cycle, both [[Twin Peaks|TV series]] (1990–91) and film, ''[[Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me|Fire Walk with Me]]'' (1992), puts a detective plot through a succession of bizarre spasms. [[David Cronenberg]] also mixes surrealism and noir in ''[[Naked Lunch (film)|Naked Lunch]]'' (1991), inspired by [[William S. Burroughs]]' [[Naked Lunch|novel]].

Perhaps no American neo-noirs better reflect the classic noir A-movie-with-a-B-movie-soul than those of director-writer [[Quentin Tarantino]];&lt;ref&gt;James (2000), pp. xviii–xix.&lt;/ref&gt; neo-noirs of his such as ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'' (1992) and ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' (1994) display a relentlessly self-reflexive, sometimes tongue-in-cheek sensibility, similar to the work of the New Wave directors and the Coens. Other films from the era readily identifiable as neo-noir (some retro, some more au courant) include director [[John Dahl]]'s ''[[Kill Me Again]]'' (1989), ''[[Red Rock West]]'' (1992), and ''[[The Last Seduction]]'' (1993); four adaptations of novels by Jim Thompson—''[[The Kill-Off]]'' (1989), ''[[After Dark, My Sweet]]'' (1990), ''[[The Grifters (film)|The Grifters]]'' (1990), and the remake of ''[[The Getaway (1994 film)|The Getaway]]'' (1994); and many more, including adaptations of the work of other major noir fiction writers: ''[[The Hot Spot]]'' (1990), from ''Hell Hath No Fury'', by [[Charles Williams (U.S. author)|Charles Williams]]; ''[[Miami Blues]]'' (1990), from the novel by [[Charles Willeford]]; and ''[[Out of Sight (1998 film)|Out of Sight]]'' (1998), from the novel by [[Elmore Leonard]].&lt;ref name=rough279/&gt; Several films by director-writer [[David Mamet]] involve noir elements: ''[[House of Games]]'' (1987), ''[[Homicide (1991 film)|Homicide]]'' (1991), ''[[The Spanish Prisoner]]'' (1997), and ''[[Heist (film)|Heist]]'' (2001).&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Silver and Ward (1992), pp. 398, 402, 407, 412.&lt;/ref&gt; On television, ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]'' (1985–89) paid homage to classic noir while demonstrating an unusual appreciation of the sense of humor often found in the original cycle.&lt;ref name=rough279&gt;Ballinger and Graydon (2007), p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1983 and 1989, [[Mickey Spillane]]'s hardboiled private eye Mike Hammer was played with wry gusto by [[Stacy Keach]] in a [[Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer (1984 TV series)|series]] and several stand-alone television films (an unsuccessful revival followed in 1997–98). The British miniseries ''[[The Singing Detective]]'' (1986), written by [[Dennis Potter]], tells the story of a mystery writer named Philip Marlow; widely considered one of the finest neo-noirs in any medium, some critics rank it among the greatest television productions of all time.&lt;ref&gt;Creeber, (2007), p. 3. ''The Singing Detective'' is the sole TV production cited in {{cite news|author1=Corliss, Richard |author2=Richard Schickel |url=http://www.time.com/time/2005/100movies/the_complete_list.html |title=All-Time 100 Movies |publisher=Time.com |date=2005-05-23 |accessdate=2009-09-29 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uKhxpXpS?url=http://www.time.com/time/2005/100movies/the_complete_list.html |archivedate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s and 2010s===
The Coen brothers make reference to the noir tradition again with ''[[The Man Who Wasn't There (2001 film)|The Man Who Wasn't There]]'' (2001); a black-and-white crime melodrama set in 1949, it features a scene apparently staged to mirror one from ''Out of the Past''. Lynch's ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'' (2001) continued in his characteristic vein, making the classic noir setting of Los Angeles the venue for a noir-inflected psychological jigsaw puzzle. British-born director [[Christopher Nolan]]'s black-and-white debut, ''[[Following]]'' (1998), was an overt homage to classic noir. During the new century's first decade, he was one of the leading Hollywood directors of neo-noir with the acclaimed ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'' (2000) and the remake of ''[[Insomnia (2002 film)|Insomnia]]'' (2002).&lt;ref&gt;Ballinger and Graydon (2007), pp. 49, 51, 53, 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

Director [[Sean Penn]]'s ''[[The Pledge (film)|The Pledge]]'' (2001), though adapted from a very self-reflexive novel by [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]], plays noir comparatively straight, to devastating effect.&lt;ref&gt;Ballinger and Graydon (2007), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Screenwriter [[David Ayer]] updated the classic noir bad-cop tale, typified by ''[[Shield for Murder]]'' (1954) and ''[[Rogue Cop]]'' (1954), with his scripts for ''[[Training Day]]'' (2001) and, adapting a story by James Ellroy, ''[[Dark Blue (film)|Dark Blue]]'' (2002); he later wrote and directed the even darker ''[[Harsh Times]]'' (2006). Michael Mann's ''[[Collateral (film)|Collateral]]'' (2004) features a performance by [[Tom Cruise]] as an assassin in the lineage of ''Le Samouraï''. The torments of ''[[The Machinist]]'' (2004), directed by [[Brad Anderson (director)|Brad Anderson]], evoke both ''Fight Club'' and ''Memento''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hibbs, Thomas|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/hibbs/hibbs200412030831.asp|title=Bale Imitation|publisher=National Review Online|date=2004-12-03|accessdate=2010-02-11|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090322131118/http://www.nationalreview.com/hibbs/hibbs200412030831.asp|archivedate=2009-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, [[Shane Black]] directed ''[[Kiss Kiss Bang Bang]]'', basing his screenplay in part on a crime novel by [[Brett Halliday]], who published his first stories back in the 1920s.

The television series ''[[Veronica Mars]]'' (2004–07) also brought a youth-oriented twist to film noir.

The man on the right, partly obscured by the steam, is wearing a constabulary-style uniform, featuring large wrap-around shades and a hat or helmet with a glossy, stiff brim. There is a bluish cast to the entire image.|[[Harrison Ford]] as detective Rick Deckard in ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982). Like many classic noirs, the film is set in a version of Los Angeles where it constantly rains.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter (1982), p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; The steam in the foreground is a familiar noir trope, while the "bluish-smoky exterior" updates the black-and-white mode.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1982), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the post-classic era, a significant trend in noir crossovers has involved [[science fiction]]. In Jean-Luc Godard's ''[[Alphaville (film)|Alphaville]]'' (1965), Lemmy Caution is the name of the old-school private eye in the city of tomorrow. ''[[The Groundstar Conspiracy]]'' (1972) centers on another implacable investigator and an amnesiac named Welles. ''[[Soylent Green]]'' (1973), the first major American example, portrays a dystopian, near-future world via a self-evidently noir detection plot; starring [[Charlton Heston]] (the lead in ''Touch of Evil''), it also features classic noir standbys Joseph Cotten, Edward G. Robinson, and [[Whit Bissell]]. The film was directed by [[Richard Fleischer]], who two decades before had directed several strong B noirs, including ''[[Armored Car Robbery]]'' (1950) and ''[[The Narrow Margin]]'' (1952).&lt;ref&gt;Downs (2002), pp. 171, 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cynical and stylish perspective of classic film noir had a formative effect on the [[cyberpunk]] genre of science fiction that emerged in the early 1980s; the film most directly influential on cyberpunk was ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982), directed by [[Ridley Scott]], which pays evocative homage to the classic noir mode&lt;ref&gt;Ballinger and Graydon (2007), p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; (Scott subsequently directed the poignant noir crime melodrama ''[[Someone to Watch Over Me (film)|Someone to Watch Over Me]]'' [1987]). Scholar Jamaluddin Bin Aziz has observed how "the shadow of [[Philip Marlowe]] lingers on" in such other "future noir" films as ''[[12 Monkeys (film)|12 Monkeys]]'' (1995), ''[[Dark City (1998 film)|Dark City]]'' (1998) and ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'' (2002).&lt;ref&gt;Aziz (2005), section "Future Noir and Postmodernism: The Irony Begins". Ballinger and Graydon note "future noir" synonyms: "'cyber noir' but predominantly 'tech noir'" (p. 242).&lt;/ref&gt; Fincher's feature debut was ''[[Alien 3]]'' (1992), which evoked the classic noir jail film ''[[Brute Force (1947 film)|Brute Force]]''.

David Cronenberg's ''[[Crash (1996 film)|Crash]]'' (1996), an adaptation of [[Crash (1973 novel)|the speculative novel]] by [[J. G. Ballard]], has been described as a "film noir in bruise tones".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dougherty, Robin |url=http://www.salon.com/march97/crash970321.html|title=Sleek Chrome + Bruised Thighs|publisher=Salon|date=1997-03-21|accessdate=2009-09-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123090727/http://www.salon.com/march97/crash970321.html|archivedate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hero is the target of investigation in ''[[Gattaca]]'' (1997), which fuses film noir motifs with a scenario indebted to ''[[Brave New World]]''.

==Parodies==
Film noir has been parodied many times in many manners. In 1945, [[Danny Kaye]] starred in what appears to be the first intentional film noir parody, ''[[Wonder Man (film)|Wonder Man]]''.&lt;ref name=SW_parody&gt;Silver and Ward (1992), p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, [[Deanna Durbin]] was the singing lead in the comedic noir ''[[Lady on a Train]]'', which makes fun of Woolrich-brand wistful miserablism. [[Bob Hope]] inaugurated the private-eye noir parody with ''[[My Favorite Brunette]]'' (1947), playing a baby-photographer who is mistaken for an ironfisted detective.&lt;ref name="SW_parody"/&gt; In 1947 as well, [[The Bowery Boys]] appeared in ''[[Hard Boiled Mahoney]]'', which had a similar mistaken-identity plot; they spoofed the genre once more in ''[[Private Eyes (1953 film)|Private Eyes]]'' (1953). Two RKO productions starring Robert Mitchum take film noir over the border into self-parody: ''[[The Big Steal]]'' (1949), directed by [[Don Siegel]], and ''[[His Kind of Woman]]'' (1951).{{Ref label|B|b|none}} The "Girl Hunt" ballet in [[Vincente Minnelli]]'s ''[[The Band Wagon]]'' (1953) is a ten-minute distillation of—and play on—noir in dance.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson (1992), p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Cheap Detective]]'' (1978), starring [[Peter Falk]], is a broad spoof of several films, including the Bogart classics ''The Maltese Falcon'' and ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]''. [[Carl Reiner]]'s black-and-white ''[[Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid]]'' (1982) appropriates clips of classic noirs for a farcical [[Pastiche#Hodge-podge|pastiche]], while his ''[[Fatal Instinct]]'' (1993) sends up noirs both classic (''Double Indemnity'') and neo (''Basic Instinct''). [[Robert Zemeckis]]'s ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' (1988) develops a noir plot set in 1940s L.A. around a host of cartoon characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Springer|first=Katherine|url=http://www.filmfracture.com/frame_of_mind/touch_of_noir_top_5_film_noir_parodies|title=Touch Of Noir: Top 5 Film Noir Parodies|date=2013-06-23|accessdate=2018-04-25|publisher=FilmFracture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In bars, in cars, sidewalks, stores, everywhere. There's no escape. I'm God's lonely man." [[Robert De Niro]] as neo-noir [[antihero]] Travis Bickle in ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' (1976).]]

Noir parodies come in darker tones as well. ''[[Murder by Contract]]'' (1958), directed by [[Irving Lerner]], is a deadpan joke on noir, with a denouement as bleak as any of the films it kids. An ultra-low-budget [[Columbia Pictures]] production, it may qualify as the first intentional example of what is now called a neo-noir film; it was likely a source of inspiration for both Melville's ''Le Samouraï'' and Scorsese's ''Taxi Driver''.&lt;ref&gt;Naremore (2008), p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Belying its parodic strain, ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]''{{'}}s final act is seriously grave. ''Taxi Driver'' caustically [[deconstruction|deconstructs]] the "dark" crime film, taking it to an absurd extreme and then offering a conclusion that manages to mock every possible anticipated ending—triumphant, tragic, artfully ambivalent—while being each, all at once.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Kolker (2000), pp. 238–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Flirting with [[splatter film|splatter]] status even more brazenly, the Coens' ''Blood Simple'' is both an exacting [[Genre parodies|pastiche]] and a gross exaggeration of classic noir.&lt;ref&gt;Silver and Ward (1992), p. 419.&lt;/ref&gt; Adapted by director Robinson Devor from a novel by [[Charles Willeford]], ''[[The Woman Chaser]]'' (1999) sends up not just the noir mode but the entire Hollywood filmmaking process, with seemingly each shot staged as the visual equivalent of an acerbic Marlowe wisecrack.&lt;ref&gt;Holden (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

In other media, the television series ''[[Sledge Hammer!]]'' (1986–88) lampoons noir, along with such topics as [[capital punishment]], gun [[fetishism]], and [[Harry Callahan (character)|Dirty Harry]]. ''[[Sesame Street]]'' (1969–curr.) occasionally casts [[Kermit the Frog]] as a private eye; the sketches refer to some of the typical motifs of noir films, in particular the voiceover. [[Garrison Keillor]]'s radio program ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'' features the recurring character [[Guy Noir]], a hardboiled detective whose adventures always wander into farce (Guy also appears in the [[A Prairie Home Companion (film)|Altman-directed film]] based on Keillor's show). [[Firesign Theatre]]'s Nick Danger has trod the same not-so-mean streets, both on radio and in comedy albums. Cartoons such as ''[[Garfield's Babes and Bullets]]'' (1989) and [[comic strip]] characters such as [[Calvin's alter egos (Calvin and Hobbes)#Tracer Bullet|Tracer Bullet]] of ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]]'' have parodied both film noir and the kindred hardboiled tradition—one of the sources from which film noir sprang and which it now overshadows.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin (2006), p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identifying characteristics==

Others say the combination of color and the specificity of director [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s vision exclude it from the category.&lt;ref&gt;Bould (2005), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In their original 1955 canon of film noir, Raymond Borde and Etienne Chaumeton identified twenty-two Hollywood films released between 1941 and 1952 as core examples; they listed another fifty-nine American films from the period as significantly related to the field of noir.&lt;ref&gt;Borde and Chaumeton (2002), pp. 161–63.&lt;/ref&gt; A half-century later, film historians and critics had come to agree on a canon of approximately three hundred films from 1940–58.&lt;ref&gt;Silver and Ward (1992) list 315 classic film noirs (passim), and Tuska (1984) lists 320 (passim). Later works are much more inclusive: Paul Duncan, ''The Pocket Essential Film Noir'' (2003), lists 647 (pp. 46–84). The title of Michael F. Keaney's ''Film Noir Guide: 745 Films of the Classic Era, 1940–1959'' (2003) is self-explanatory.&lt;/ref&gt; There remain, however, many differences of opinion over whether other films of the era, among them a number of well-known ones, qualify as film noirs or not. For instance, ''[[The Night of the Hunter (film)|The Night of the Hunter]]'' (1955), starring Robert Mitchum in an acclaimed performance, is treated as a film noir by some critics, but not by others.&lt;ref&gt;Treated as noir: Ballinger and Graydon (2007), p. 34; Hirsch (2001), pp. 59, 163–64, 168. Excluded from canon: Silver and Ward (1992), p. 330. Ignored: Bould (2005); Christopher (1998); Ottoson (1981).&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics include ''[[Suspicion (1941 film)|Suspicion]]'' (1941), directed by Alfred Hitchcock, in their catalogues of noir; others ignore it.&lt;ref&gt;Included: Bould (2005), p. 126; Ottoson (1981), p. 174. Ignored: Ballinger and Graydon (2007); Hirsch (2001); Christopher (1998). Also see Silver and Ward (1992): ignored in 1980; included in 1988 (pp. 392, 396).&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning films made either before or after the classic period, or outside of the United States at any time, consensus is even rarer.

To support their categorization of certain films as noirs and their rejection of others, many critics refer to a set of elements they see as marking examples of the mode. The question of what constitutes the set of noir's identifying characteristics is a fundamental source of controversy. For instance, critics tend to define the model film noir as having a tragic or bleak conclusion,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Ballinger and Graydon (2007), p. 4; Christopher (1998), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; but many acknowledged classics of the genre have clearly happy endings (e.g., ''Stranger on the Third Floor,'' ''The Big Sleep,'' ''Dark Passage,'' and ''The Dark Corner''), while the tone of many other noir [[denouement]]s is ambivalent.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Ray (1985), p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics perceive classic noir's hallmark as a distinctive visual style. Others, observing that there is actually considerable stylistic variety among noirs, instead emphasize plot and character type. Still others focus on mood and attitude. No survey of classic noir's identifying characteristics can therefore be considered definitive. In the 1990s and 2000s, critics have increasingly turned their attention to that diverse field of films called neo-noir; once again, there is even less consensus about the defining attributes of such films made outside the classic period.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (2005), pp. 34–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visual style===

The [[low-key lighting]] schemes of many classic film noirs are associated with stark light/dark [[contrast (vision)|contrasts]] and dramatic shadow patterning—a style known as [[chiaroscuro]] (a term adopted from Renaissance painting).{{Ref label|C|c|none}} The shadows of Venetian blinds or banister rods, cast upon an actor, a wall, or an entire set, are an iconic visual in noir and had already become a [[cliché]] well before the neo-noir era. Characters' faces may be partially or wholly obscured by darkness—a relative rarity in conventional Hollywood filmmaking. While black-and-white cinematography is considered by many to be one of the essential attributes of classic noir, the color films ''[[Leave Her to Heaven]]'' (1945) and ''[[Niagara (1953 film)|Niagara]]'' (1953) are routinely included in noir filmographies, while ''[[Slightly Scarlet (1956 film)|Slightly Scarlet]]'' (1956), ''[[Party Girl (1958 film)|Party Girl]]'' (1958), and ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958) are classified as noir by varying numbers of critics.&lt;ref&gt;See Ballinger and Graydon (2007), p. 31, on general issue. Christopher (1998) and Silver and Ward (1992), for instance, include ''Slightly Scarlet'' and ''Party Girl'', but not ''Vertigo'', in their filmographies. By contrast, Hirsch (2001) describes ''Vertigo'' as among those Hitchcock films that are "richly, demonstrably ''noir''" (p. 139) and ignores both ''Slightly Scarlet'' and ''Party Girl''; Bould (2005) similarly includes ''Vertigo'' in his filmography, but not the other two. Ottoson (1981) includes none of the three in his canon.&lt;/ref&gt;

Film noir is also known for its use of [[low-angle shot|low-angle]], [[wide-angle lens|wide-angle]], and [[Dutch angle|skewed, or Dutch angle]] shots. Other devices of disorientation relatively common in film noir include shots of people reflected in one or more mirrors, shots through curved or frosted glass or other distorting objects (such as during the strangulation scene in ''Strangers on a Train''), and special effects sequences of a sometimes bizarre nature. [[Night-for-night]] shooting, as opposed to the Hollywood norm of [[day-for-night]], was often employed.&lt;ref&gt;Place and Peterson (1974), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; From the mid-1940s forward, [[location shooting]] became increasingly frequent in noir.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch (2001), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an analysis of the visual approach of ''Kiss Me Deadly'', a late and self-consciously stylized example of classic noir, critic Alain Silver describes how cinematographic choices emphasize the story's themes and mood. In one scene, the characters, seen through a "confusion of angular shapes", thus appear "caught in a tangible vortex or enclosed in a trap." Silver makes a case for how "side light is used&amp;nbsp;... to reflect character ambivalence", while shots of characters in which they are lit from below "conform to a convention of visual expression which associates shadows cast upward of the face with the unnatural and ominous".&lt;ref&gt;Silver (1995), pp. 219, 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structure and narrational devices===
[[File:SorryWrongNumber2.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A man and a woman, seen in profile, starring intensely at each other. The man, on the left, is considerably taller. He wears a brown pin-striped suit, holds a key in one hand and grips the woman's arm with the other. She is wearing a pale green top. Lit from below and to the side, they cast bold, angled shadows on the wall behind them.|[[Barbara Stanwyck]] and [[Burt Lancaster]] were two of the most prolific stars of classic noir. The complex structure of ''[[Sorry, Wrong Number]]'' (1948) involves a real-time framing story, [[multiperspectivity|multiple narrators]], and flashbacks within flashbacks.&lt;ref&gt;Telotte (1989), pp. 74–87.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Film noirs tend to have unusually convoluted story lines, frequently involving [[Flashback (literary technique)|flashbacks]] and other editing techniques that disrupt and sometimes obscure the [[narrative]] sequence. Framing the entire primary narrative as a flashback is also a standard device. Voiceover narration, sometimes used as a structuring device, came to be seen as a noir hallmark; while classic noir is generally associated with first-person narration (i.e., by the protagonist), Stephen Neale notes that third-person narration is common among noirs of the semidocumentary style.&lt;ref&gt;Neale (2000), pp. 166–67 n. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Neo-noirs as varied as ''The Element of Crime'' (surrealist), ''After Dark, My Sweet'' (retro), and ''Kiss Kiss Bang Bang'' (meta) have employed the flashback/voiceover combination.

Bold experiments in cinematic storytelling were sometimes attempted during the classic era: ''Lady in the Lake'', for example, is shot entirely from the [[Point of view shot|point of view]] of protagonist Philip Marlowe; the face of star (and director) [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]] is seen only in mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;Telotte (1989), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Chase (1946 film)|The Chase]]'' (1946) takes [[Oneiric (film theory)|oneirism]] and fatalism as the basis for its fantastical narrative system, redolent of certain horror stories, but with little precedent in the context of a putatively realistic genre. In their different ways, both ''Sunset Boulevard'' and ''D.O.A.'' are tales told by dead men. Latter-day noir has been in the forefront of structural experimentation in popular cinema, as exemplified by such films as ''Pulp Fiction'', ''Fight Club'', and ''Memento''.&lt;ref&gt;Rombes, Nicholas, ''New Punk Cinema'' (2005), pp. 131–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plots, characters, and settings===
Crime, usually murder, is an element of almost all film noirs; in addition to standard-issue greed, jealousy is frequently the criminal motivation. A crime investigation—by a private eye, a police detective (sometimes acting alone), or a concerned amateur—is the most prevalent, but far from dominant, basic plot. In other common plots the protagonists are implicated in [[heist film|heists]] or [[confidence trick|con games]], or in murderous conspiracies often involving adulterous affairs. False suspicions and accusations of crime are frequent plot elements, as are betrayals and double-crosses. According to J. David Slocum, "protagonists assume the literal identities of dead men in nearly fifteen percent of all noir."&lt;ref&gt;Slocum (2001), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amnesia]] is fairly epidemic—"noir's version of the common cold", in the words of film historian [[Lee Server]].&lt;ref&gt;Server (2006), p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PursuedPoster.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Black-and-white film poster with an image of a young man and woman holding each other. They are surrounded by an abstract, whirlpool-like image; the central arc of the thick black line that define it encircles their head. Both are wearing white shirts and look forward with tense expressions; his right arm cradles her back, and in his hand he holds a revolver. The stars' names—Teresa Wright and Robert Mitchum—feature at the top of the whirlpool; the title and remainder of the credits are below.|By the late 1940s, the noir trend was leaving its mark on other genres. A prime example is the Western ''[[Pursued]]'' (1947), filled with psychosexual tensions and behavioral explanations derived from [[Psychoanalysis|Freudian theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Ottoson (1981), p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Film noirs tend to revolve around heroes who are more flawed and morally questionable than the norm, often [[fall guy]]s of one sort or another. The characteristic protagonists of noir are described by many critics as "[[Social alienation|alienated]]";&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Naremore (2008), p. 25; Lyons (2000), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; in the words of Silver and Ward, "filled with [[existentialism|existential]] bitterness".&lt;ref&gt;Silver and Ward (1992), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Certain archetypal characters appear in many film noirs—hardboiled detectives, femme fatales, corrupt policemen, jealous husbands, intrepid [[claims adjuster]]s, and down-and-out writers. Among characters of every stripe, cigarette smoking is rampant.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Hirsch (2001), pp. 128, 150, 160, 213; Christopher (1998), pp. 4, 32, 75, 83, 116, 118, 128, 155.&lt;/ref&gt; From historical commentators to neo-noir pictures to pop culture ephemera, the private eye and the femme fatale have been adopted as the quintessential film noir figures, though they do not appear in most films now regarded as classic noir. Of the twenty-six National Film Registry noirs, in only four does the star play a private eye: ''The Maltese Falcon'', ''The Big Sleep'', ''Out of the Past'', and ''Kiss Me Deadly''. Just four others readily qualify as detective stories: ''Laura'', ''The Killers'', ''The Naked City'', and ''Touch of Evil''.

Film noir is often associated with an urban setting, and a few cities—Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, and Chicago, in particular—are the location of many of the classic films. In the eyes of many critics, the city is presented in noir as a "labyrinth" or "maze".&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Hirsch (2001), p. 17; Christopher (1998), p. 17; Telotte (1989), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Bars, lounges, nightclubs, and gambling dens are frequently the scene of action. The climaxes of a substantial number of film noirs take place in visually complex, often industrial settings, such as refineries, factories, trainyards, power plants—most famously the explosive conclusion of ''White Heat'', set at a chemical plant.&lt;ref&gt;Ballinger and Graydon (2007), pp. 217–18; Hirsch (2001), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; In the popular (and, frequently enough, critical) imagination, in noir it is always night and it always rains.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Bould (2005), p. 18, on the critical establishment of this iconography, as well as p. 35; Hirsch (2001), p. 213; Christopher (1998), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

A substantial trend within latter-day noir—dubbed "film soleil" by critic [[D. K. Holm]]—heads in precisely the opposite direction, with tales of deception, seduction, and corruption exploiting bright, sun-baked settings, stereotypically the desert or open water, to searing effect. Significant predecessors from the classic and early post-classic eras include ''The Lady from Shanghai''; the [[Robert Ryan]] vehicle ''[[Inferno (1953 film)|Inferno]]'' (1953); the French adaptation of [[Patricia Highsmith]]'s ''[[The Talented Mr. Ripley]]'', ''[[Plein Soleil|Plein soleil]]'' (''Purple Noon'' in the United States, more accurately rendered elsewhere as ''Blazing Sun'' or ''Full Sun''; 1960); and director Don Siegel's version of ''[[The Killers (1964 film)|The Killers]]'' (1964). The tendency was at its peak during the late 1980s and 1990s, with films such as ''[[Dead Calm (film)|Dead Calm]]'' (1989), ''[[After Dark, My Sweet]]'' (1990), ''[[The Hot Spot]]'' (1990), ''[[Delusion (1991 film)|Delusion]]'' (1991), ''[[Red Rock West]]'' (1993) and the television series ''[[Miami Vice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Holm (2005), pp. 13–25 passim.&lt;/ref&gt;

Film noir is often described as essentially pessimistic.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Naremore (2008), p. 37, on the development of this viewpoint, and p. 103, on contributors to Silver and Ward encyclopedia; Ottoson (1981), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The noir stories that are regarded as most characteristic tell of people trapped in unwanted situations (which, in general, they did not cause but are responsible for exacerbating), striving against random, uncaring fate, and frequently doomed. The films are seen as depicting a world that is inherently corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Ballinger and Graydon (2007), p. 4; Christopher (1998), pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Classic film noir has been associated by many critics with the American social landscape of the era—in particular, with a sense of heightened anxiety and alienation that is said to have followed World War II. In author [[Nicholas Christopher]]'s opinion, "it is as if the war, and the social eruptions in its aftermath, unleashed demons that had been bottled up in the national psyche."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher (1998), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Film noirs, especially those of the 1950s and the height of the [[Red Scare]], are often said to reflect cultural paranoia; ''[[Kiss Me Deadly]]'' is the noir most frequently marshaled as evidence for this claim.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Muller (1998), p. 81, on analyses of the film; Silver and Ward (1992), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Film noir is often said to be defined by "moral ambiguity",&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Naremore (2008), p. 163, on critical claims of moral ambiguity; Lyons (2000), pp. 14, 32.&lt;/ref&gt; yet the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]] obliged almost all classic noirs to see that steadfast virtue was ultimately rewarded and vice, in the absence of shame and redemption, severely punished (however dramatically incredible the final rendering of mandatory justice might be). A substantial number of latter-day noirs flout such conventions: vice emerges triumphant in films as varied as the grim ''Chinatown'' and the ribald ''Hot Spot''.&lt;ref&gt;See Skoble (2006), pp. 41–48, for a survey of noir morality.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tone of film noir is generally regarded as downbeat; some critics experience it as darker still—"overwhelmingly black", according to Robert Ottoson.&lt;ref&gt;Ottoson (1981), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Influential critic (and filmmaker) Paul Schrader wrote in a seminal 1972 essay that "''film noir'' is defined by tone", a tone he seems to perceive as "hopeless".&lt;ref&gt;Schrader (1972), p. 54 [in Silver and Ursini]. For characterization of definitive tone as "hopeless", see pp. 53 ("the tone more hopeless") and 57 ("a fatalistic, hopeless mood").&lt;/ref&gt; In describing the adaptation of ''Double Indemnity,'' noir analyst Foster Hirsch describes the "requisite hopeless tone" achieved by the filmmakers, which appears to characterize his view of noir as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch (2001), p. 7. Hirsch subsequently states, "In character types, ''mood'' [emphasis added], themes, and visual composition, ''Double Indemnity'' offer[s] a lexicon of ''noir'' stylistics" (p. 8).&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, definitive film noirs such as ''The Big Sleep'', ''The Lady from Shanghai'', ''Scarlet Street'' and ''Double Indemnity'' itself are famed for their hardboiled repartee, often imbued with sexual innuendo and self-reflexive humor.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders (2006), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
{{refbegin}}
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{Note label|A|a|none}} The plural forms of ''film noir'' in English include ''films noirs'' ([[English plurals#French compounds|derived from the French]]), ''films noir'', and ''film noirs''. [[Merriam-Webster]], which acknowledges all three styles as acceptable, favors ''film noirs'',&lt;ref name="plurals"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/film%20noir |title=film noir |accessdate=2009-02-10 |website=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=[[Merriam–Webster|Merriam-Webster Online]] |quote=Inflected Form(s): plural film noirs \-'nwär(z)\ or films noir or films noirs \-'nwär\ }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] lists only ''films noirs''.&lt;ref&gt;OED Third Edition, September 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{Note label|B|b|none}} ''His Kind of Woman'' was originally directed by John Farrow, then largely reshot under Richard Fleischer after studio owner [[Howard Hughes]] demanded rewrites. Only Farrow was credited.&lt;ref&gt;Server (2002), pp. 182–98, 209–16; Downs (2002), p. 171; Ottoson (1981), pp. 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{Note label|C|c|none}} In ''Academic Dictionary of Arts'' (2005), Rakesh Chopra notes that the high-contrast film lighting schemes commonly referred to as "chiaroscuro" are more specifically representative of [[tenebrism]], whose first great exponent was the Italian painter [[Caravaggio]] (p.&amp;nbsp;73). See also Ballinger and Graydon (2007), p.&amp;nbsp;16.&lt;/li&gt;

'''Hecataeus''' of [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]] or of [[Teos]] ({{lang-el|Ἑκαταῖος ὁ Ἀβδηρίτης}}), was a Greek [[historian]] and [[sceptic]] [[philosopher]] who flourished in the 4th century BC.

{{anchor|Biography|History}}
==Life==
[[Diogenes Laertius]] (ix.61) relates that he was a student of [[Pyrrho]], along with Eurylochus, [[Timon (philosopher)|Timon the Phliasian]], [[Nausiphanes]] of Teos and others, and includes him among the "Pyrrhoneans". [[Diodorus Siculus]] (i.46.8) tells us that Hecataeus visited [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] in the times of [[Ptolemy I Soter]], and composed a history of Egypt. Diodorus supplies the comment that many additional Greeks went to and wrote about Egypt in the same period. The ''[[Suda]]'' gives him the nickname, 'critic grammarian' and says that he lived in the time of the [[Partition of Triparadisus|successors]] to [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Klaus Meister]] "Hecataeus" (2) of Abdera in ''[[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'' 3rd. ed. [[Oxford]]; [[Oxford University Press]] 1999 p.671&lt;/ref&gt;

No complete works of Hecataeus have survived to our time, and our knowledge of his writing exists only in fragments located in various ancient Greek and Latin authors' works, primarily in [[Diodorus Siculus]], whose [[ethnography]] of Egypt (''[[Bibliotheca historica]],'' Book I) represents by far the largest amount. Diodorus mostly paraphrases Hecataeus, thus it is difficult to extract Hecataeus' actual writings. (see [[Karl Wilhelm Ludwig Müller]]'s ''[[Fragmenta historicorum Graecorum]]'').

Hecataeus wrote the work ''Aegyptiaca''&lt;ref&gt;Wachsmuth (1895), Trüdinger (1918), Burton (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; or ''On the Egyptians'' (the same title of [[Manetho]]'s later work),&lt;ref&gt;Jacoby (1943), Murray (1970), Fraser (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; both suggestions are based on known titles of other ethnographic works, an account of Egypt’s customs, beliefs and geography, and the single largest fragment from this [[lost work]] is held to be Diodorus' account of the [[Ramesseum]], tomb of [[Ramesses II|Osymandyas]] (i.47-50).{{fact|date=May 2016}}

Diodorus (ii.47.1-2) and [[Apollonius of Rhodes]] tell of another work by Hecataeus, ''On the Hyperboreans''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title=Pseudo-Hecataeus: On the Jews |author=Bezalel Bar-Kochva | chapter=The Structure of an Ethnographical Work | chapter-url=http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft3290051c&amp;chunk.id=d0e8538&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=d0e8019&amp;brand=eschol |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the ''[[Suda]]'', the 10th century [[Byzantine]] encyclopedia, he wrote a treatise on the poetry of [[Hesiod]] and [[Homer]], but nothing of them has survived.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stoa.org/sol-bin/search.pl?searchstr=Hecataeus Suda online]&lt;/ref&gt;

His digression on the Jews in ''Aegiptica'' was the first mention of them in Greek literature. It was subsequently paraphrased in Diodorus Siculus 40.3.8. A work attributed to him by [[Josephus]] ''On the Jews'' is considered spurious.&lt;ref&gt;''OCD''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; p.671&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry Carrington Bolton''' (1843–1903) was an American chemist and bibliographer of science.

==Biography==
He graduated from [[Columbia University|Columbia]] in 1862,&lt;ref name=acab&gt;{{Appletons'|wstitle=Bolton, Henry Carrington|year=1900|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then studied chemistry with [[Jean Baptiste André Dumas]] and [[Charles Adolphe Wurtz]] in Paris; with [[Robert Bunsen]], [[Hermann Kopp]], and [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] at [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]]; with [[Friedrich Wöhler]] at [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]]; and with [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann]] in [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]], and received a D. Phil. at Göttingen in 1866, for his work called “On the Fluorine Compounds of Uranium”.&lt;ref name="Boltonia2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pratt|first1=Herbert T. |title=Henry Carrington Bolton: A Truly Renaissance Man|journal=Boltonia |date=2004|volume=January |issue=6 |pages=2-5 |publisher=[[Chemical Heritage Foundation]] |url=http://www.chemheritage.org/Downloads/Library/Boltonia-06_2004.pdf|accessdate= 26 March 2018 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926001003/http://www.chemheritage.org/Downloads/Library/Boltonia-06_2004.pdf|archivedate=September 26, 2012|df=}}  The rest of the issue is also about Bolton and his works.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his graduation, he spent some years in travel. From 1872 until 1877, he was assistant in [[quantitative analysis (chemistry)|quantitative analysis]] in the Columbia School of Mines. In 1874 he was appointed professor of chemistry in the Woman's Medical College of the New York Infirmary. He resigned in 1877, when he became professor of chemistry and natural science in [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]]. The celebration of the centennial of chemistry at [[Northumberland, Pennsylvania]], the home of [[Joseph Priestley]], who discovered oxygen in 1774, was suggested and brought about by Bolton.&lt;ref name=acab/&gt;

Among his investigations, that of the action of organic acids on minerals is perhaps the most important, but most of his work was literary, and his private collection of early chemical books was unsurpassed in the United States.&lt;ref name=acab/&gt; Bolton published large bibliographies of chemistry and later of all scientific periodicals which are still used. He included [[alchemy]] in the chemistry listings and emphasized the continuity of the transition. He was a member of many scientific societies, perhaps more than any contemporary.&lt;ref name="Boltonia1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bohning|first1=J.J |title=In Memoriam: Henry Carrington Bolton, 29 January 1843 – 19 November 1903|journal=Boltonia |date=2004|volume=January |issue=6 |pages=1-2 |publisher=[[Chemical Heritage Foundation]] |url=http://www.chemheritage.org/Downloads/Library/Boltonia-06_2004.pdf|accessdate= 26 March 2018 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926001003/http://www.chemheritage.org/Downloads/Library/Boltonia-06_2004.pdf|archivedate=September 26, 2012|df=}}  The rest of the issue is also about Bolton and his works.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Science History Institute]] hosts the Bolton Society, which is named for H.C. Bolton, to support "printed materials devoted to chemistry and related sciences" and to support its Othmer Library of Chemical History.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bolton Society|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/bolton-society|website=Science History Institute|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''history of Kyrenia''', a town in the area of [[Northern Cyprus]] that the Turks have occupied since 1974, dates back to [[Prehistoric Cyprus]] and continues into the present.

==Prehistoric and ancient times==
[[Kyrenia]] dates to the end of the [[Trojan War]] when many settlers arrived there from [[Achaea]] in the [[Peloponnese]] and established towns in the district. Evidence from archeological sites excavated in and around the town of Kyrenia bespeak of the area's settlement since the [[Neolithic]] period, 5800-3000 BC. Moreover, many [[Mycenaean Greek language|Mycenaean]], Geometric and Achaean tombs dating from 14th to 5th centuries BC, were also discovered. A fine climate, fertile soil and an abundance of water offered ideal conditions for the town's early settlement. 

[[Cepheus, King of Tegea|Cepheus]] from [[Arcadia]] is believed to be the founder of the town of [[Kyrenia]]. A military leader, he arrived at the north coast of the island bringing with him many settlers from various towns in Achaea. One such town, located near present-day [[Aigio]] in the [[Peloponnese]], was also called Kyrenia. 

The earliest reference made to the town of Kyrenia is found, together with that of the other seven city kingdoms of Cyprus, in [[Hieratic|Egyptian scripts]] dating from the period of [[Ramesses III]], c. 1186–1155 BC.

From its early days of settlement, Kyrenia's commerce and maritime trade benefited enormously from its proximity to the [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] coast. Boats set sail from the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean islands]], travelled along the Asia Minor coast, and then crossed over the short distance to the northern shores of Cyprus to reach the two city kingdoms of [[Lapithos]] and Kyrenia. This lively maritime activity (late 4th or early 3rd century BC) is evident in an ancient shipwreck discovered by Andreas Kariolou in 1965, just outside Kyrenia harbour. The vessel's route along [[Samos Island|Samos]], [[Kos]], [[Rhodes]], the Asia Minor coastline and then Kyrenia, demonstrates the town's close maritime relations with other city kingdoms in the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. 

During the succession struggle between [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] and [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus]] that followed [[Alexander the Great]]'s death in 323 BC, Kyrenia was subdued under the rule of the kingdom of Lapithos that allied itself with Antigonus. Once the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]] were successful in dominating the whole island, all city kingdoms were abolished. Kyrenia however, because of its maritime trade, continued to prosper. In the 2nd century BC, it is cited as one of six Cypriot towns which were benefactors to the Oracle at [[Delphi]], that is, it received its special representatives who collected contributions and gifts. The town's prosperity at this time is also evident from its two temples, one dedicated to [[Apollo]] and the other to [[Aphrodite]], and from the rich archeological finds dating from the [[Hellenistic period]] excavated within the present-day town limits. 

The Romans succeeded the Ptolemies as rulers of Cyprus and during this time Lapithos became the administrative centre of the district. The numerous tombs excavated and the rich archeological finds dating from this period indicate however, that Kyrenia continued to be a populous and prosperous town. An inscription found at the base of a limestone statue dating from 13-37 AD, refers to "Kyrenians Demos" that is, the town's inhabitants. Here the Romans left their mark by constructing a castle with a seawall in front of it so that boats and ships could anchor in safety. 

[[Christianity]] found fertile ground in the area. The first Christian martyrs used the old quarries of Chrysokava, just east of Kyrenia castle, as [[catacombs]] and cut-rock cemeteries which are considered among the island's most important remains from this period. Later, some of these caves were converted into churches and feature beautiful iconography, the most representative of which is that found at Ayia Mavri. From these early days, the town of Kyrenia was an episcopal see. One of its first bishops, Theodotus, was arrested and tortured between 307-324, under the reign of Licinius.

The persecution of Christians officially ended in 313, when [[Constantine I]] and his co-emperor, [[Licinius]], issued the [[Edict of Milan]], which mandated toleration of Christians in the [[Roman Empire]] and freedom of worship. The martyrdom of Theodotus, however, occurred in 324 and it is this event that the Church annually commemorates on March 2.

==Medieval Ages==
With the division of the Roman empire into an eastern and [[Western Roman Empire|western empire]], in 395 Cyprus came under the Byzantine emperors and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox Church]]. The [[List of Byzantine Emperors|Byzantine emperors]] fortified Kyrenia's Roman castle and in the 10th century, they constructed in its vicinity a church dedicated to [[Saint George|St. George]], which the garrison used as a chapel. Then, when in 806, Lambousa was destroyed in the [[Arab]] raids, Kyrenia grew in importance because its castle and garrison offered its inhabitants protection and security. [[Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus]], the island's last [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] governor, sent his family and treasures to the castle for safety in 1191 when King [[Richard I of England]] of England went to war with him. However, Richard defeated Comnenus and became the island's new master. 

King Richard's rule was not welcomed in Cyprus so he sold the island first to the [[Knights Templar|Templars]], and then in 1192, to [[Guy of Lusignan]]. Under [[Kingdom of Cyprus|Frankish rule]], the villages of the district of Kyrenia became feudal estates and the town became once again the administrative and commercial centre for its region. The Lusignans enlarged the castle, built a wall and towers around the town, and extended the fortifications to the harbour. They also fortified the Byzantine castles of Saint Hilarion, Bouffavento and Kantara, which, together with Kyrenia Castle, protected the town from land and sea attacks. Kyrenia castle played a pivotal role in the island's history during the many disputes among the Frankish kings, as well as the conflicts with the [[Genoa|Genoese]]. On numerous occasions the castle came under siege, but it never capitulated. 

In 1489, Cyprus came under [[Republic of Venice|Venetian rule]]. The Venetians modified [[Kyrenia Castle]] to meet the threat that the use of gunpowder and cannons posed. The castle's royal quarters and three of its four thin and elegant Frankish towers were demolished and replaced by thickset circular towers that could better withstand cannon fire. These new towers, however, were never put to the test. In 1571, the castle and the town surrendered to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] army.

==Kyrenia Under Ottoman Rule==
[[Cyprus under the Ottoman Empire|Under Ottoman rule]], Kyrenia district was at first one of four, then one six, administrative districts of the island and the town remained its administrative capital. The town's fortunes declined however as it was transformed into a [[garrison]] town. The Christian population was expelled from the fortified city, and no one was allowed to reside within the castle other than the artillerymen and their families. These men terrorized the town's inhabitants and those of the surrounding villages, Christian and [[Muslim]] alike, with their arbitrary looting and crimes. The few local inhabitants who dared to stay were merchants and fishermen whose livelihood depended on the sea. They built their homes outside the city wall, which through time, neglect and disrepair, turned to ruin. The rest of the inhabitants moved further out to the area known as Pano Kyrenia or the ‘Riatiko' (so called because it once belonged to a king) or fled further inland and to the mountain villages of [[Thermeia]], [[Karakoumi]], [[Kazafani]], [[Bellapais]] and Karmi. 

The town revived again when bribes and gifts paid to local Turkish officials caused them to permit local maritime trade with Asia Minor and the Aegean islands to resume. In 1783, the church of Chrysopolitissa was renovated. Then in 1856, following the Hatt-I-Humayum, which introduced social and political reform and greater religious freedom for the various peoples of the [[Ottoman Empire]], the church of Archangel Michael was rebuilt on a rocky mount overlooking the sea. At about this time, many of the Christian inhabitants of the surrounding villages reestablished themselves in the town. Local agriculture and maritime trade, particularly the export of carobs to Asia Minor, allowed the people of Kyrenia to have a comfortable living, and some even to educate their children and pursue other cultural activities.

==Under British Rule==
In 1878, following a secret agreement between the [[British Empire|British]] and Ottoman governments, the island was ceded to Great Britain as a military base in the eastern Mediterranean. At first, Great Britain did not undertake major administrative changes, so Kyrenia remained the district's capital. A road was constructed through the mountain pass to connect the town to the island's capital, [[Nicosia]], and the harbour was repaired and expanded to accommodate increasing trade with the opposite coast. The town's municipal affairs were put in order and the municipal council took an active role in cleaning and modernizing the town. In 1893, a hospital was built through private contributions and effort. By the 1900s (decade), Kyrenia was a buzzing little town with a new school building, its own newspaper, social, educational and athletic clubs. It was also a favoured vacation spot for many wealthy Nicosia families. Many homes were converted into pensions and boarding houses and in 1906, the first hotel, The ‘Akteon,' was built by the sea. These first decades of British rule however, also saw increased economic hardship for the population. High taxation, frequent droughts and a world economic depression were precipitating factors for a mass exodus of people from the town and district, first to [[Egypt]] and then to the [[United States]]. 

In 1922, the episcopal see of Kyrenia returned to the town after the completion of a new metropolitan building. That same year, the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)|Greco-Turkish war]] brought to a halt all trade with the opposite coast causing a serious economic depression. To the rescue came a young repatriate from the USA who built the town's first modern hotels; first the ‘Seaview' in 1922 followed by the ‘Dome' in 1932 - both built with a foreign tourist clientele in mind. Kyrenia's mild climate, picturesque harbour, numerous archeological sites, panoramic views that combined sea, mountains and vegetation, coupled with modern amenities, soon attracted many travellers and Kyrenia's economy revived through tourism. After the Second World War, more hotels were built and the town remained a favoured vacation spot for Nicosia residents and foreign travellers alike. To the town's Greek and Turkish inhabitants were added many from [[Great Britain]] who chose Kyrenia as their permanent place of residence.

==After Cypriot Independence==
In 1960, Cyprus gained its independence from Great Britain.  However, the intercommunal conflict that broke out in 1963-64 between the island's Greek and Turkish population again eroded Kyrenia's prosperity. While skirmishes in Kyrenia were minimal, Turkish Cypriot irregulars blockaded the Kyrenia-Nicosia road and occupied Saint Hilarion castle. Despite these difficulties, the 1960s and early 1970s was a period of lively cultural and economic activity. A new town hall was built and a Folklore Museum established. The ancient shipwreck [http://www.kyreniaship.org] already alluded to was reassembled, together with all its amphorae and cargo, and permanently exhibited at the castle. The number of new hotels and tourists multiplied and a new road was constructed in the early 1970s connecting the town to Nicosia from the east. The town's cultural activities greatly increased. Other than the many traditional cultural and religious fairs and festivals annually celebrated, flower shows, yachting races, concerts and theatre performances were organized. Kyrenia, the smallest of Cypriot towns, was undoubtedly the island's most precious jewel. 

The town's inhabitants, Greek, Turk, [[Maronite Church|Maronite]], [[Armenians|Armenian]], Latin and British peacefully coexisted and cooperated in their daily affairs and the town had grown beyond its two historic neighbourhoods of Kato (Lower) Kyrenia and Pano (Upper) Kyrenia. It expanded towards the mountain slopes to form the new neighbourhood of "California", and eastward it had just about reached the outskirts of Thermeia, Karakoumi and Ayios Georgios. On July 20, 1974, [[Turkey]] landed on the island to protect the Turkish minority from attack from the Greek military coup for [[enosis]] . The [[Greek Cypriots]] of Kyrenia abandoned their homes and headed to south of what is now the green line.

In 1974, there were 47 villages in the district of Kyrenia [http://www.kyreniaship.org]. Greek and Maronite Cypriots constituted 83% of the district's total population, while the [[Turkish Cypriots]] constituted just 15% of the total.

==After the Turkish invasion==
In 1974 the Turkish military conducted the [[Turkish Invasion of Cyprus]]. As a result, the Greeks of Kyrenia were expelled from their homes and became refugees. Today, the Republic of Cyprus continues to have a bishop of Kyrenia and the pre-1974 Greek inhabitants of Kyrenia continue to participate elections for the Kyrenia municipality in exile.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14119">{{History of Sudan}}

In June 1986, '''[[Sadiq al Mahdi]] formed a coalition government''' with the [[National Umma Party Sudan|Umma Party]], the [[Democratic Unionist Party (Sudan)|Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP), the [[National Islamic Front]] (NIF), and four southern parties. Unfortunately, however, Sadiq proved to be a weak leader and incapable of governing [[Sudan]]. Party factionalism, corruption, personal rivalries, scandals, and political instability characterized the Sadiq regime. After less than a year in office, Sadiq al Mahdi dismissed the government because it had failed to draft a new penal code to replace the sharia, reach an agreement with the IMF, end the civil war in the south, or devise a scheme to attract remittances from Sudanese expatriates. To retain the support of the DUP and the southern political parties, Sadiq formed another ineffective coalition government.

==Second coalition==
Instead of removing the ministers who had been associated with the failures of the first coalition government, Sadiq al Mahdi retained thirteen of them, of whom eleven kept their previous portfolios. As a result, many Sudanese rejected the second coalition government as being a replica of the first. To make matters worse, Sadiq and DUP leader [[Muhammad Uthman al Mirghani]] signed an inadequate memorandum of understanding that fixed the new government's priorities as affirming the application of the sharia to Muslims, consolidating the [[Islamic banking]] system, and changing the national flag and national emblem. Furthermore, the memorandum directed the government to remove former leader [[Jaafar an Nimeiri|Nimeiri]]'s name from all institutions and dismiss all officials appointed by Nimeiri to serve in international and regional organizations. As expected, antigovernment elements criticized the memorandum for not mentioning the civil war, famine, or the country's disintegrating social and economic conditions.

In August 1987, the DUP brought down the government because Sadiq al Mahdi opposed the appointment of a DUP member, [[Ahmad as Sayid]], to the Supreme Commission. For the next nine months, Sadiq and Mirghani failed to agree on the composition of another coalition government. During this period, Sadiq moved closer to the NIF. However, the NIF refused to join a coalition government that included leftist elements. Moreover, Turabi indicated that the formation of a coalition government would depend on numerous factors, the most important of which were the resignation or dismissal of those serving in senior positions in the central and regional governments, the lifting of the state of emergency reimposed in July 1987, and the continuation of the Constituent Assembly.

==Third coalition==
Because of the endless debate over these issues, it was not until May 15, 1988, that a new coalition government emerged headed by Sadiq al Mahdi. Members of this coalition included the Umma, the DUP, the NIF, and some southern parties. As in the past, however, the coalition quickly disintegrated because of political bickering among its members. Major disagreements included the NIF's demand that it be given the post of commissioner of Khartoum, the inability to establish criteria for the selection of regional governors, and the NIF's opposition to the replacement of senior military officers and the chief of staff of the executive branch.

In November 1988, another more explosive political issue emerged when Mirghani and the SPLM signed an agreement in Addis Ababa that included provisions for a cease-fire, the freezing of the sharia, the lifting of the state of emergency, and the abolition of all foreign political and military pacts. The two sides also proposed to convene a constitutional conference to decide Sudan's political future. The NIF opposed this agreement because of its stand on the sharia. When the government refused to support the agreement, the DUP withdrew from the coalition. Shortly thereafter armed forces commander in chief Lieutenant General Fathi Ahmad Ali presented an ultimatum, signed by 150 senior military officers, to Sadiq al Mahdi demanding that he make the coalition government more representative and that he announce terms for ending the civil war.

==End of al Mahdi rule==
On March 11, 1989, Sadiq al Mahdi responded to this pressure by dissolving the government. The new coalition had included the Umma, the DUP, and representatives of southern parties and the trade unions. The NIF refused to join the coalition because it was not committed to enforcing the sharia. Sadiq claimed his new government was committed to ending the [[Second Sudanese Civil War|southern civil war]] by implementing the November 1988 DUP-SPLM agreement. He also promised to mobilize government resources to bring food relief to famine areas, reduce the government's international debt, and build a national political consensus.

Sadiq's inability to live up to these promises eventually caused his downfall. On June 30, 1989, Colonel (later Lieutenant General) [[Umar Hassan Ahmad al Bashir]] overthrew Sadiq and established the [[Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation]] to rule Sudan. Bashir's commitment to imposing the [[sharia]] on the non-Muslim south and to seeking a military victory over the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army/Movement|SPLA]], however, seemed likely to keep the country divided for the foreseeable future and hamper resolution of the same problems faced by Sadiq al Mahdi. Moreover, the emergence of the NIF as a political force made compromise with the south more unlikely.

The Revolutionary Command Council dissolved itself in October 1993. Its powers were devolved to the President (al Bashir declared himself the President) and the [[Transitional National Assembly]].

==Conflict in the south, Darfur conflict and conflict with Chad==
The civil war in the south has displaced more than 4 million southerners. Some fled into southern cities, such as [[Juba, Southern Sudan|Juba]]; others trekked as far north as [[Khartoum]] and even into [[Ethiopia]], [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], [[Egypt]], and other neighboring countries. These people were unable to grow food or earn money to feed themselves, and malnutrition and starvation became widespread. The lack of investment in the south resulted as well in what international humanitarian organizations call a “lost generation” who lack educational opportunities, access to basic health care services, and little prospects for productive employment in the small and weak economies of the south or the north.

In early 2003 a [[Darfur conflict|new rebellion]] of [[Sudan Liberation Movement/Army]] (SLM/A) and [[Justice and Equality Movement]] (JEM) groups in the western region of [[Darfur]] began. The rebels accused the central government of neglecting the Darfur region, although there is uncertainty regarding the objectives of the rebels and whether they merely seek an improved position for Darfur within Sudan or outright secession. Both the government and the rebels have been accused of atrocities in this war, although most of the blame has fallen on Arab militias ([[Janjaweed]]) allied with the government. The rebels have alleged that these militias have been engaging in [[ethnic cleansing]] in Darfur, and the fighting has displaced hundreds of thousands of people, many of them seeking refuge in neighboring [[Chad]]. There are various estimates on [[Darfur Genocide#Mortality figures|the number of human casualties]], ranging from under twenty thousand to several hundred thousand dead, from either direct combat or starvation and disease inflicted by the conflict.

In 2004 Chad brokered negotiations in [[N'Djamena]], leading to the [[April 8 Humanitarian Ceasefire Agreement]] between the Sudanese government, the JEM, and the SLA.  However, the conflict continued despite the ceasefire, and the [[African Union]] (AU) formed a [[Ceasefire Commission]] (CFC) to monitor its observance. In August 2004, the African Union sent 150 [[Rwanda]]n troops in to protect the ceasefire monitors. It, however, soon became apparent that 150 troops would not be enough, so they were joined by 150 [[Nigeria]]n troops.

On September 18, 2004 [[United Nations Security Council]] issued [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1564|Resolution 1564]] declaring that the government of Sudan had not met its commitments, expressing concern at helicopter attacks and assaults by the [[Janjaweed]] militia against villages in Darfur. It welcomed the intention of the African Union to enhance its monitoring mission in Darfur and urged all member states to support such efforts. During 2005 the [[African Union Mission in Sudan]] force was increased to about 7,000.
 
The [[Chadian-Sudanese conflict]] officially started on December 23, 2005, when the [[government of Chad]] declared a [[war|state of war]] with [[Sudan]] and called for the citizens of [[Chad]] to mobilize themselves against [[Rally for Democracy and Liberty]] (RDL) militants (Chadian rebels backed by the [[Sudan|Sudanese]] government) and Sudanese militiamen who attacked villages and towns in eastern Chad, stealing cattle, murdering citizens, and burning houses.

Peace talks between the southern rebels and the government made substantial progress in 2003 and early 2004, although skirmishes in parts of the south have reportedly continued. The two sides have agreed that, following a final peace treaty, southern Sudan will enjoy autonomy for six years, and after the expiration of that period, the people of southern Sudan will be able to vote in a referendum on independence. Furthermore, oil revenues will be divided equally between the government and rebels during the six-year interim period. The ability or willingness of the government to fulfill these promises has been questioned by some observers, however, and the status of three central and eastern provinces was a point of contention in the negotiations. Some observers wondered whether hard line elements in the north would allow the treaty to proceed.

A final peace treaty was signed on 9 January 2005 in [[Nairobi]]. The terms of the peace treaty are as follows:
*The south will have autonomy for six years, followed by a referendum on secession.
*Both sides of the conflict will merge their armed forces into a 39,000-strong force after six years, if the secession referendum should turn out negative.
*Income from oilfields is to be shared evenly between north and south.
*Jobs are to be split according to varying ratios (central administration: 70 to 30, [[Abyei]]/[[Blue Nile State]]/[[Nuba mountains]]: 55 to 45, both in favour of the government).
*Islamic law is to remain in the north, while continued use of the sharia in the south is to be decided by the elected assembly.

On 31 August 2006, the United Nations Security Council approved [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1706|Resolution 1706]] to send a new peacekeeping force of 17,300 to Darfur. In the following months, however, [[UNMIS]] was not able to deploy to Darfur due to the Government of the Sudan’s steadfast opposition to a peacekeeping operation undertaken solely by the United Nations. The UN then embarked on an alternative, innovative approach to try to begin stabilize the region through the phased strengthening of AMIS, before transfer of authority to a joint African Union/United Nations peacekeeping operation. Following prolonged and intensive negotiations with the Government of the Sudan and significant international pressure, the Government of the Sudan finally accepted the peacekeeping operation in Darfur.

In 2009 the [[International Criminal Court]] issued an arrest warrant for al-Bashir, accusing him of crimes against humanity and war crimes.

In 2009 and 2010 a [[Sudanese nomadic conflicts|series of conflicts between rival nomadic tribes]] in [[South Kordofan]] caused a large number of casualties and displaced thousands.

An agreement for the restoration of harmony between Chad and Sudan, signed January 15, 2010, marked the end of a five-year war between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Report 2011: Chad|url=https://www.hrw.org/en/world-report-2011/chad|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sudanese government and the JEM signed a ceasefire agreement ending the Darfur conflict in February, 2010.

In January 2011 [[Southern Sudanese independence referendum, 2011|referendum on independence for Southern Sudan]] was held, and the South voted overwhelmingly to secede later that year as the [[Republic of South Sudan]], with its capital at [[Juba, Southern Sudan|Juba]] and [[Kiir Mayardit]] as its first president. Al-Bashir announced that he accepted the result, but violence soon erupted in the disputed region of [[Abyei]], claimed by both the North and the South.

On June 6, 2011 [[South Kordofan conflict|armed conflict]] broke out in [[South Kordofan]] between the forces of Northern and [[Southern Sudan]], ahead of the scheduled independence of the South on July 9.  This followed an agreement for both sides to withdraw from [[Abyei]].On June, 20 the parties agreed to demilitarize the contested area of Abyei where [[Ethiopia]]n peacekeepers will be deployed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sudantribune.com/TEXT-North-and-South-Sudan-agree,39282 North and South Sudan agree to demilitarize Abyei]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 9, 2011 South Sudan became an independent country.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14089843 |title = BBC News - South Sudan becomes an independent nation |first = Peter |last = Martell |work = BBC |year = 2011 |accessdate = 9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pius XII Memorial Library taken by Marissa Krieg.jpg|thumb|right|The Knights of Columbus Vatican Film Library is located in the Pius XII Memorial Library (shown) on the campus of Saint Louis University.]]
The '''Knights of Columbus Vatican Film Library''' in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] is the only collection, outside the Vatican itself, of microfilms of more than 37,000 works from the ''Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana'', the [[Vatican Library]] in Europe. It is located in the [[Pius XII Memorial Library]] on the campus of [[Saint Louis University]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Library was created by Lowrie J. Daly (1914–2000), with funding from the [[Knights of Columbus]]. The goal was to make Vatican and other documents more available to researchers in North America.

Microfilming of Vatican manuscripts began in 1951, and according to the Library's website, was the largest microfilming project that had been undertaken up to that date.&lt;ref name=KNE&gt;{{cite news|title=Kentucky New Era - Aug 14, 1954|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=266&amp;dat=19540814&amp;id=GOQrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3GUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3874,6783861|accessdate=30 July 2014|work=[[Kentucky New Era]]|date=14 August 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1951 to 1957, twelve million manuscript pages were recorded, from 30,000 different works.  This represents approximately 75% of the manuscripts available in the targeted language groups.  Other microfilm projects in the 1950s included [[Jesuit]] archival material from [[Rome]], archives in both [[North America]] and [[South America]], and the [[Philippines]].

The Library opened in 1953, and moved to the St. Louis University campus, in the Pius XII Memorial Library, in 1959. The first librarian was Charles J. Ermatinger, who served until 2000.

As of 2007, the Library has microfilmed versions of over 37,000 manuscripts, with material in [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin]], [[Arabic]], [[Hebrew]] and [[Ge'ez language|Ethiopic]], as well as several more common Western European languages.  There are reproductions of many works from the Biblioteca Palatina and Biblioteca Cicognara at the Vatican, as well as [[Papal]] letter registers from the ''Archivio Segreto Vaticano'' ([[Vatican Secret Archives]]) from the 9th to 16th centuries, in the series ''Registra Vaticana'' and ''Registra Supplicationium''.&lt;ref&gt;Vatican Film Library informational pamphlet&lt;/ref&gt;

The Film Library also collects manuscript catalogs and handwritten inventories of Vatican Library manuscripts, as well as those of other libraries, including a collection of microfilmed copies of over 2,500 medieval and [[renaissance]] manuscripts from other libraries, over 20,000 [[incunabula]] (early printed books), and 52,000 color slides of illuminated manuscripts.

The collection also includes many hardcopy works on the subjects of [[palaeography]], [[codicology]], [[illumination (manuscript)|illumination]], and other topics related to manuscript studies.

==Conference==
The Library hosts an annual conference on Manuscript Studies, which is held in St. Louis in mid-October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saint Louis Conference on Manuscript Studies |url=http://libraries.slu.edu/special_collections/stl_conf_manu |website=SLU |publisher=[[St. Louis University]] |accessdate=30 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808040840/http://libraries.slu.edu/special_collections/stl_conf_manu |archivedate= 8 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journal==
Since 1957, the Library has published a twice-annual journal, ''[[Manuscripta]]'', which focuses on manuscript studies of medieval and Renaissance documents. It is published through Brepols Publishers.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Mikałaj Ułaščyk''' (Mikalai Ulashchyk, [[Belarusian language]]: ''Мікалай Улашчык'', [[Russian language|Russian]]: ''Николай Николаевич Улащик''; February 14, 1906 - November 22, 1986) was a [[Belarus]]ian academic [[History|historian]] and [[Archaeology|archaeologist]] known for significant contributions to the research in the medieval history of [[Belarus]].

He was born in the village of Vickaŭščyna close to [[Minsk]]. His birthplace later became a subject of one of his works.

In 1929 Mikałaj Ułaščyk graduated from the [[Belarusian State University]], specialised in history. In 1930 he was arrested by the [[NKVD]] together with a large number of Belarusian intellectuals accused of "anti-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] activity" and "[[nationalism]]" within the framed-up [[Case of the Union of Liberation of Belarus]]. He was deported to a [[labor camp]] close to [[Kirov, Kirov Oblast|Vyatka]]. After his release in 1935 he was again twice arrested and imprisoned in the following years (1941-1942, 1950-1955) because of his active opposing the official Soviet propagandist historiography.

After the final release he was not able to go back to [[Belarus]] and settled in [[Moscow]] where since 1955 he worked at the Institute of History of the [[USSR Academy of Sciences]].

Mikałaj Ułaščyk became doctor of sciences and author of numerous works on the [[History of Belarus]] and the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] related to the research of chronicles, source documents and archaeography. He was also the editor of 32nd and 35th volumes of the [[Full Collection of Russian Chronicles]].

'''Mocha''' ({{lang-es|link=no|Isla Mocha}}) is a small [[Chile]]an island located west of the coast of [[Arauco Province]] in the Pacific Ocean. The island is approximately {{convert|48|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} in area, with a small chain of mountains running roughly in north-south direction. In [[Mapuche mythology]], the souls of dead people travel west to visit this island. The island today is home to the [[Mocha Island National Reserve]], a [[nature reserve]] that covers approximately 45% of the island's surface. The island is noted as the location of numerous historic [[shipwrecks]]. The waters off the island are a popular place for recreational sea fishing.

[[Geology|Geologically]] the island is a basement high{{fact|date=April 2016}} and it does also contains strata of [[Ranquil Formation]] whose main outcrops lie in the continent.&lt;ref name=Garcia1968&gt;{{cite book |last=García A. |first=Floreal |date=1968 |title=El Terciario de Chile Zona Central |editor-last=Ceccioni |editor-first=Giovanni |url= |location=Santiago de Chile |publisher=Ediorial Andrés Bello |page=25–57 |isbn=|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Van spilberger in mocha 1616.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Depiction of Isla Mocha during an incursion by a Dutch pirate fleet in 1616.  From the book that narrates the adventures of Dutch pirate [[Joris van Spilbergen]].]]

The island was historically inhabited by an indigenous coastal population of [[Mapuche]]s known as the [[Lafkenche]]s. The first European to document Mocha was [[Juan Bautista Pastene]] on September 10, 1544, who named it ''Isla de San Nicolas de Tolentino''.

According to [[Juan Ignacio Molina]], the Dutch captain [[Joris van Spilbergen]] observed the use of [[chilihueque]]s (a South American camelid) by native [[Mapuche]]s of Mocha Island as [[plough|plough animals]] in 1614.&lt;ref&gt;''The Geographical, Natural and Civil History of Chili'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=F4oIAAAAQAAJ Pages 15 and 16, Volume II]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mocha Island was regularly visited by [[pirates]] from the [[Netherlands]] and England. [[Francis Drake]] and [[Olivier van Noort]] are known to have used the island as a supply base. When Drake was visiting it during his [[circumnavigation]] of the globe he was seriously hurt by hostile Mapuches that inhabited the island.  Eventually the Mapuche on the island were transported in 1685, from Mocha Island by Governor [[José de Garro]] to a [[reducción]] on the plain on the right bank of the [[Bio Bio River]] called the Valley of Mocha that later became the location of the modern city of [[Concepción, Chile]].

The waters off the island are also noted as the home to a famous 19th century [[sperm whale]], [[Mocha Dick]] as depicted by American explorer and author [[Jeremiah N. Reynolds]] who published an account, "Mocha Dick: Or The White Whale of the Pacific: A Leaf from a Manuscript Journal" in May, 1839 in ''[[The Knickerbocker]]'' magazine in New York.&lt;ref name="Reynolds"&gt;* J. N. Reynolds. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=RBfZAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=the%20knickerbocker%20mocha%20dick&amp;pg=PA377#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Mocha Dick: or the White Whale of the Pacific: A Leaf from a Manuscript Journal]," ''The Knickerbocker, or New-York Monthly Magazine''. Vol. 13, No. 5, May 1839, pp.&amp;nbsp;377–392.&lt;/ref&gt; Mocha Dick was, in part, the inspiration for the fictional whale Moby Dick in the 1851 novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' by [[Herman Melville]]&lt;ref name="Delbanco"&gt;[[Andrew Delbanco|Delbanco, Andrew]]. ''Melville, His World and Work''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2005: 167–168. {{ISBN|0-375-40314-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polynesian contact==
In recent years, considerable evidence has emerged suggesting [[Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact theories#Similarity of features and genetics|pre-Columbian contact between the Mapuche and Polynesians]]. In December 2007, several human skulls with Polynesian features, such as a pentagonal shape when viewed from behind, were found lying on a shelf in a museum in [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]]. These skulls originated from Mocha Island. Professor Lisa Matisoo-Smith of the [[University of Otago]] and [[José Miguel Ramírez Aliaga]] of the [[University of Valparaíso]] hope to win agreement soon with the locals of Mocha Island to begin an excavation search for Polynesian remains on the island.&lt;ref&gt;Lawler, Andrew (2010) "[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/328/5984/1344.full Beyond ''Kon-Tiki'': Did Polynesians Sail to South America?]", ''Science'', June 11: 1344–1347.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|theatre audiences|the gardening arrangement|Parterre}}
The word ''parterre'' comes from the French ''par'' and ''terre'' and literally translated means “on the ground.”&lt;ref&gt;Feldman (2007), p.168.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the term was used in the 16th century to refer to a formal ornamental garden, but by the mid-17th century, it was increasingly used to refer both to the ground level of a theatre where spectators stood to watch performances and to the group of spectators who occupied that space.

Although the word '''parterre''' originated in France, historians use the term interchangeably with its English equivalent, “the pit,” to designate the same part of the audience in [[England]], present-day [[Italy]], and [[Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;Weber (1997), p.688.&lt;/ref&gt; While parterre audiences differed in social status, size, inclusion of women, and seating arrangements, they shared the characteristic of being noisy, often boisterous, interactive audiences.

Today, historians are divided over whether or not parterre audiences deliberately challenged political authority, what role they played in constructing public opinion, and if they contributed to the formation of a [[public sphere]] in [[early modern Europe]].

==Audience==
[[File:Foyer du Théâtre Montansier.jpg|thumb|left|275px|People socializing at the Théâtre Montansier in the 18th century.]]

It is impossible to categorize parterre audiences as belonging exclusively to one social class, but historians agree that cheaper parterre tickets drew a proportionately higher number of lower-level professionals and commercial labourers, such as artisans, students, journalists, and lawyers, to the pit. However, the occupation, wealth, sex, and social standing of parterre spectators differed depending on geographical location.

Historians studying theater audiences in France have traditionally identified the parterre as the exclusive domain of lower-class males, with the exception of female prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1995), p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, scholars such as Jeffrey Ravel argue that parterre audiences were more socially heterogeneous than previously believed.&lt;ref&gt;Ravel (1999), pp.15-17.&lt;/ref&gt; For one, spectators who sat in the more expensive loges (balcony boxes) were free to meander into the parterre as they wished, and it was fashionable for younger well-off men to stand in the parterre.&lt;ref&gt;Ravel (1999), p.19; Weber (1980), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; As well, despite restrictions against women entering the parterre, cross-dressing was not uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;Ravel (1999), p.18&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Kärntnertortheater 1830.jpg|thumb|250px|1830 illustration of Vienna's Kärntnertor theater.]]

England's parterre audiences differed from France because of the relatively high number of elites and “fashionable women” who socialized in the pit.&lt;ref&gt;Hall-Witt (2007), p.62.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Jennifer Hall-Witt provides several possible explanations for the unique character of England's parterre. In English theaters some bench seats were available to parterre spectators, while theatergoers who could not find seats socialized in wide corridors known as fop-allies that ran down the sides and centre of the benches.&lt;ref&gt;Hall-Witt (2007), p.62.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in England, unlike in France or Austria, parterre tickets were not the cheapest; a galley ticket was less than the average half-guinea price of a parterre seat in a ''London'' theater.&lt;ref&gt;Hall-Witt (2007), p.107.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the pit in England was more socially respectable than elsewhere in Europe.

If separation between “nobles and commoners” in English or French theaters was informal, in Austrian theaters, the parterre formally differentiated between elites and non-elites.&lt;ref&gt;Weber (1980), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance; in 1748, [[Vienna]]'s [[Kärntnertor]] theater partitioned a section of the standing parterre to create a second parterre behind the orchestra where only elites could sit.&lt;ref&gt;Van Horn Melton (2004), p.271.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practices==
Parterre practices ranged from harmless gossiping to violent rioting. Talking, laughing, whistling, drunken brawls, and hissing, even dancing and singing was common behaviour. Prostitution was normal and individuals who ventured into the parterre could expect to be pick-pocketed, spied upon, and jostled about, in spite of the police or doormen who were charged with maintaining order. Yet, according to historian and musicologist James Johnson, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Few complained about the noise and bustle&amp;nbsp;... eighteenth-century audiences considered music little more than an agreeable ornament of a magnificent spectacle, in which they themselves played the principal part.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1995), p.10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The antics of parterre audiences included mimicking performances, ogling at the women in the boxes, and making fun of people, as in one performance when “a few misfits in the parterre made sure the whole hall noticed one unlucky woman whose wig was taller than the door to her box.”&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1995), p.26.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not surprising then, that for theatergoers the spectacle in the pit was the primary source of “endless amusement.”&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1995), p.26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The parterre as critic===
[[Image:Paris Comedie-Francaise.jpg|thumb|left|450px|18th century watercolour of the Comédie-Française in Paris.]]
Audience members in the parterre did not hesitate to approve, or censure, plays, performers, royal edicts, or offending individuals. For example, “it was in the parterre that [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] received “kicks in the rear” after his withering attack on French music.”&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1995), p.17.&lt;/ref&gt; Responses could take less-intrusive forms of applause or booing, but the parterre was not always so kind. James Van Horn Melton writes that “audiences at [[London]]'s [[Drury Lane]] Theater expressed their dissatisfaction by pelting the stage with oranges.”&lt;ref&gt;Van Horn Melton (2004), pp.251-279.&lt;/ref&gt;

What influence did parterre audiences have? Though only informal critics, the size of the parterre, which ranged from around 500 to over 1000 spectators, meant their voice carried some weight with theater managers, whose commercial success depended partly on their patronage.&lt;ref&gt;Ravel (1999), p.14.&lt;/ref&gt; On many occasions, for example, audience members from the parterre succeeded in forcing performers to switch programs mid-act, or repeat their favourite arias.

By the mid-18th century the word ''parterre'' acquired additional meaning as contemporaries increasingly identified the parterre as a “public judge,” whose response to a performance could determine the success of a play or even the careers of actors, actresses, and playwrights.&lt;ref&gt;Hall-Witt (2007), p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; The wide range of 18th century sources defining the parterre as a judge, include personal letters, memoirs, and published periodicals, such as [[Joseph Addison]] and [[Richard Steele]]’s ''[[The Spectator]]'' and ''[[Tatler (1709 journal)|The Tatler]]'', which circulated in London’s [[Coffeehouses]]. Historians frequently quote portions from the French philosopher and playwright, [[Jean-François Marmontel]]'s entry for “parterre,” published in the 1776 supplement to [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]]'s [[Encyclopédie]], which declares, “the parterre is the best of all judges.”&lt;ref&gt;Friedland (2002), p.84.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, scholars caution against equating the parterre with “the public,” especially since the latter term has changed meanings in the past two centuries. While parterre audiences were located at, or near, the bottom of the theater's social hierarchy, attending the theater was still an exclusive activity, limited mostly to the middle ranks of people and above.&lt;ref&gt;Lough (1957), p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, "the public” that was the parterre was distinct from "the people" who could not afford even the cheapest theater tickets.&lt;ref&gt;Roche (1987), p.53.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enforcing order===
In the late 17th century, royal authorities in England, France, and regions in present-day Italy published numerous edicts threatening to discipline unruly behaviour, from interrupting performances to wearing hats, that were distributed as pamphlets or read aloud in theaters.&lt;ref&gt;Lough (1957), p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; These edicts where directed at the parterre, and many theater managers, performers, music critics, and individuals from the loges applauded such efforts to enforce order in the parterre. Disciplinary measures varied, but police records from the 18th century tell of police banning disruptive individuals after fights, and punishing unacceptable behaviour, such as defecating in the parterre, as well as guarding against petty crime, such as theft.&lt;ref&gt;Roche (1987), p.53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet, parterre behaviour continued largely unchanged. In Rome and Parma, efforts to regulate start times were ineffective and ignored, especially by “the notorious minor abbots who littered the parterre.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1995), p.27.&lt;/ref&gt; Even a request from a bishop in England to lower the curtain before the start of the Sabbath at midnight could not prevent the pit from rioting and trashing the theater when the stage manager attempted to comply.&lt;ref&gt;Hall-Witt (2007), p.32.&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether the inability of all efforts to impose order in the parterre reflects poor policing capabilities, the declining authority of the monarchy, or the deliberate resistance of the parterre is undecided.

==19th-century changes==
Between the late 18th and early 19th centuries there was a transformation in theater audiences from active participants to passive viewers, most noticeably in the parterre. While there is consensus among scholars that such a transformation occurred, how and why it occurred is highly contested.

===Improved lighting and staging techniques===
Towards the end of the 18th century, theater designs and lighting technology improved dramatically. Previously, the theaters' lighting came from individual candles surrounding the stage, small chandeliers hanging from the boxes, or larger chandeliers that illuminated the whole theater. The smoke from the candles often surrounded the stage with a cloud of haze, leading one historian to remark, “spectators sometimes saw one another more clearly than the performers.”&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1995), p.13.&lt;/ref&gt;  New lighting systems, such as the innovation of gaslights in England, reduced smoke and the invention of a system of pulleys to manipulate chandeliers enabled stage managers to direct the theater's primary light-source, and thus the audiences’ gaze, towards the stage.

Changes in theater design complemented the new lighting.  Early 17th century theater-houses, which were often converted tennis courts, were not conducive to creating the illusion of a single vantage point on the stage. Instead, the boxes often faced each other and an audience member in the parterre would be equally comfortable looking into the loges.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman (2007), p.156.&lt;/ref&gt;

While historians agree that technological changes affected the attentiveness of parterre audiences, they also agree that these innovations alone do not account for silent audiences.

===Seating arrangements===
Historians specializing in the history of the parterre in France attribute the movement to install seats in playhouses with efforts to silence the unwieldy parterre. Seats were installed in the [[Comédie-Française]] in 1782  and in 1788 benches were installed in the [[Comédie-Italienne]].&lt;ref&gt;Ravel (1999), p.220-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1777 [[Jean-François de La Harpe]]’s proposal to install seats in the parterre sparked the debates between [[philosophes]], playwrights, and officials about the desirability and motives behind seating the parterre.&lt;ref&gt;Ravel (1999), p.213.&lt;/ref&gt; Marmontel insisted that plans to seat the parterre was really an imposition of the “aristocracy” on “theatrical democracy.”&lt;ref&gt;Friedland (2002), p. 87-89.&lt;/ref&gt; The theater architect, [[Claude Nicolas Ledoux]], saw the plans for seating in a more positive light, and wrote that “[T]he cabal will end, and we will judge authors more rationally once we have destroyed what is incorrectly called the enthusiasm of the parterre.”&lt;ref&gt;Friedland (2002), p. 87-88.&lt;/ref&gt; Among those who favoured seating the parterre were stage managers and independent music critics, who linked the boisterous parterre to moral decline in the theatre and saw benches as a way to “tame” them.&lt;ref&gt;Ravel (1999), p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of whether individuals advocated for or against installing benches, what is consistent is the belief that seating would pacify the parterre. Other records indicate that the move was also prompted by the series of fires in theater-houses and the realization that packed parterre crowds were a possible fire hazard.&lt;ref&gt;Ravel (1999), pp.41-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

How silent was the seated parterre? Evidence shows that noise and disruptions continued throughout the first half of the 19th century. In England and in regions, such as [[Rome]] and [[Parma]], partial seating had always been available for parterre audiences and did not guarantee calmer audiences. According to Martha Feldman, the theaters in Rome were “the wildest in Europe.”&lt;ref&gt;Feldman (2007), p.156.&lt;/ref&gt; However, for historians who identify the parterre as a site of public opinion, the debates over seating are significant because they provide evidence that disorder in the parterre was an act of disobedience against authorities and that the parterre was able to withstand attempts to pacify them and continued to act as arbiters of public opinion outside the realm of the monarchy.

===New codes of polite behavior===
[[File:The Laughing Audience (or A Pleased Audience) by William Hogarth.jpg|cropped|left|200px|An etching by William Hogarth showing "The Laughing Audience" and a sour-faced critic, 1733.]]

Another explanation for the transformation of parterre audiences by the end of the 18th century is that changes in elite culture and in their behavior at the theater was mirrored by the parterre and the growing “bourgeois” audience whose values, according to some historians, included “politeness and emotional self-restraint.”&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1995), p.3.; Hall-Witt (2007), p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Changing prescriptions for appropriate theater behavior found in conduct books reflect such a shift. Where it was once fashionable to arrive late and not pay too much attention to the performances, the new culture of politeness emphasized the importance of silence and attentiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1995), p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; Hall-Witt argues that the shift in elite behavior in theatres was prompted by changes to the theater's subscription to the loges, which meant that box seats would be available to non-elites.&lt;ref&gt;Hall-Witt (2007), pp.3-6.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the social hierarchy that was mirrored in the seating arrangements of the theater were blurred. By adhering to a new etiquette of politeness that valued silence and attentiveness, elites could replace old methods of differentiation based on seating, with 'superior' behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1995), p.50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes in music===
Scholars analyzing parterre audiences from a musicology perspective argue that changes in musical composition, illustrated by the works of composers such as [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], changed how spectators listened. James Johnson is foremost among the scholars who argue that new styles of music precipitated quieter audiences. In his work, ''Listening in Paris: A Cultural History'', Johnson argues that in pre-19th century theaters, listening was superficial.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1995), p.3.&lt;/ref&gt; The transformation to “engaged listening, and by extension, from talkative to silent audiences,” paralleled new theories of music that required more attentive listening.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1995), p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars writing on the listening habits of audiences in the 18th and 19th century are critical of Johnson's approach. William Weber writes that current "ideological construct[s] of taste and proper listening dates...from the early nineteenth century" and cautions that approaching the 18th century listening habits from this perspective undermines their musical culture.&lt;ref&gt;Weber (1997), p.678-89.&lt;/ref&gt; In Weber's view, socializing and talking did not exclude listening.&lt;ref&gt;Weber (1997), p.679.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historians’ views on the parterre &amp; the public sphere==
[[Jürgen Habermas]]’s influential work ''[[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere]]'' provides historians with the theoretical foundation for scholarship on the rise of a public sphere in Europe. For Habermas the public sphere constitutes a "realm of communication" that is open, egalitarian, rational, and critical and can be traced to the rise of the "bourgeois" in the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Van Horn Melton (2001), p.3.&lt;/ref&gt; Significantly, for scholars interested in the history of the theater Habermas argues that the "realm of arts" served as training grounds for a critical public opinion, which later manifested itself in the realm of politics.&lt;ref&gt;Friedland (2002), p.53.&lt;/ref&gt; Keith Baker’s work, which builds on Habermas’s model of the public sphere, provides historians of theater audiences with another useful framework. Baker's analysis of the 18th century rhetorical construction of “public opinion” as a tribunal and symbol of political culture is especially influential.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1995), p.92.&lt;/ref&gt;

===According to Jeffrey Ravel===
Jeffrey Ravel’s recent work, which is a cultural history of ''The Contested Parterre: Public Theatre and French Political Culture: 1680-1791'', is the first scholarly study devoted to writing the history of the parterre. The significance of the parterre for Ravel is how it functioned as a critical segment of public opinion in an absolutist state, eventually becoming a symbol of political culture in France. Ravel writes that in France, public opinion had already emerged by the 1750s, decades before the date most historians associate with the emergence of public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Ravel (1999), p.101.&lt;/ref&gt; Ravel finds evidence of an emerging public opinion in the parterre audiences of the theater, which in his view was “one of the first forums in France where the subjects of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] Crown insisted on their place in French political culture.”&lt;ref&gt;Ravel (1999), p.26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using 18th century police records, Ravel argues that disorderliness in the pit demonstrates the critical nature of parterre audiences, who were not merely responding to performances and the social activates around them, but were undermining the very authority of the court, who remained, at the same time, the patrons of France’s “privileged” theaters, the  Comédie-Française, Comédie-Italienne,  and the'' Paris Opera''.&lt;ref&gt;Ravel (1999), p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, “the public theatre...did not reproduce the forms of political and cultural authority generated at Versailles.”&lt;ref&gt;Ravel (1999), p.101.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of his analysis, Ravel examines representations of the parterre in literature, from the 17th to 18th centuries. Ravel demonstrates how writers constructed an image of the parterre as a legitimate public critic, endowing it with an authority equivalent to that of the king.&lt;ref&gt;Ravel (1999), p.49.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 18th century, the parterre was synonymous with the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Ravel (1999), p.191.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Kaiser summarized the effect of this process well when he wrote, “the evolution of arts and letters...created an international tribunal of public judgement that it did not control.”&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser (1989), p.189.&lt;/ref&gt;

===According to Paul Friedland===
In 2002 Paul Friedland published his work ''Political Actors: Representative Bodies and Theatricality in the Age of the French Revolution''. Friedland  disagrees with the “equation of the theatrical parterre with the nation” and with the way historians have “imbued” the parterre “with political culture.”&lt;ref&gt;Friedland (2002), p.55.&lt;/ref&gt; More than Ravel, Friedland is highly critical of Habermas and writes that for historians of the theater the implications of Habermas’s model of the “public sphere” is “a reading of public opinion in the arts as if it were veiled political metaphor.”&lt;ref&gt;Friedland (2002), p.54.&lt;/ref&gt; “Theater,” according to Friedland, “was not “really” about politics any more than politics was “really” about theater.”&lt;ref&gt;Friedland (2002), p.55.&lt;/ref&gt;  What theater and politics did share was the “same underlying representative process.”&lt;ref&gt;Friedland (2002), p.55.&lt;/ref&gt;

18th century transformations in modes of political representation paralleled new theories of representation on the stage. Friedland writes that [[Antoine-François Riccoboni]]'s ''L'art du Theatre'' marked  the shift in theories of theatrical representation, from a system where the performers' “representation of a character necessarily entailed the actor's actual physical experience of the character's emotions,” to a new system of representation where the actors performance was not 'true' but resembled what was true.&lt;ref&gt;Friedland (2002), p.21.&lt;/ref&gt; In Friedland's words “...this new, artificial system depended, not on the actors' belief – or, as we tend to refer to it today, on the spectator's suspension of disbelief.”&lt;ref&gt;Friedland (2002), p.23.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, as modes of representation shifted in the world of theater, parallels emerged in the representation of the king. In an absolutist monarchy the king was the source of his own legitimacy, whereas under the new system of representation the king's legitimacy came from the critical judgement of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Friedland (2002), p.55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, Friedland's examination of theater audiences and the political sphere does not see parterre audiences as the basis of political culture in France. Rather the "participatory" parterre audiences of the 18th century  reflected a particular mode of representation, just as the possibility of shaping a modern silent spectator emerged with new conditions of theatergoing  that were dictated by changes in theories of representation.

Pemulwuy would hunt meat and provide it to the food-challenged new colony in exchange for goods. However, in 1790 Pemulwuy began a twelve-year guerilla war against the British, which continued until his assassination.&lt;ref name="message one"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110114180335/http://www.abc.net.au/tv/messagestick/stories/s3084205.htm "Summer Series - Pemulwuy: A War of Two Laws Pt ", ''Message Stick'', Sunday 5 December 2010] accessed 3 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47152902|title=Aboriginal Sydney : a guide to important places of the past and present|last=Studies.|first=Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander|date=2001-01-01|publisher=Aboriginal Studies Press|year=|isbn=0855753706|location=|pages=140|oclc=47152902|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

When Pemulwuy grew into manhood he became ''Bembul Wuyan'', which represents "the earth and the crow". According to historian Richard Green "he wasn't very impressed with the mix of cultures. He preferred that we stayed within our own peoples." . &lt;ref name="message one"/&gt; Another name for him was "''Butu Wargun''" which means "[[crow]]".&lt;ref name="message one"/&gt;

==Early life==
Pemulwuy was born with a [[Strabismus|turned eye]]&lt;ref name="message one" /&gt; or other blemish in his left eye.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to historian Eric Willmot:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Normally, a child that showed an obvious deformity would've been, well, people would have expected that child to be sent back, to be reborn again. It was generally thought that humans, like everything, came from the land. And that a woman, the actual act of conception, was a woman being infected by a child's spirit from the land. And that child grows within her. And so he was different and he became more different. He became better than everybody else. Whatever anyone else could do, Pemulwuy did it better. He could run further, he was one of the best, he could use a spear like no-one else could. And so, around him, was created an aura of difference. So much so that he was said to be a clever man. In an Aboriginal society, clever man is often a man who deals with the spiritual nature of things and sorcery even.&lt;ref name="message one"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;His contemporary [[Colebe]] said that Pemulwuy's left foot was distinctive as it had been damaged by a club, perhaps to mark him as a [[carradhy]] ("clever man" or [[Traditional medicine|healer]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[Kurdaitcha]] (ritual executioners and lawmen) of Central Australia similarly have a foot deliberately mutilated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="message one" /&gt;

===Origin of Conflict: Spearing of McIntyre===
On 9 December 1790, a shooting party left for Botany Bay, including a sergeant of marines and three convicts, including Governor Phillip's gamekeeper John McIntyre. According to [[Watkin Tench]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;About one o’clock, the sergeant was awakened by a rustling noise in the bushes near him, and supposing it to proceed from a kangaroo, called to his comrades, who instantly jumped up. On looking about more narrowly, they saw two natives with spears in their hands, creeping towards them, and three others a little farther behind. As this naturally created alarm, McIntyre said, “don’t be afraid, I know them,” and immediately laying down his gun, stepped forward, and spoke to them in their own language. The Indians, finding they were discovered, kept slowly retreating, and McIntyre accompanied them about a hundred yards, talking familiarly all the while. One of them now jumped on a fallen tree and, without giving the least warning of his intention, launched his spear at McIntyre and lodged it in his left side. The person who committed this wanton act was described as a young man with a speck or blemish on his left eye. That he had been lately among us was evident from his being newly shaved.&lt;ref name="tench chapter eight"&gt;[http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/t/tench/watkin/settlement/chapter8.html#chapter8 Watkin Tench, ''The Settlement at Port Jackson'', Chapter Eight] accessed 3 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The group was pursued by the settlers with muskets, but they escaped. McIntyre was taken back to the settlement, gravely wounded. Tench suspected that McIntyre had previously killed Aboriginal people, and noted the fear and hatred that the Aboriginal people, including [[Bennelong]] (an Aboriginal man who Governor Phillip had captured, in hopes of interaction with the Aboriginals) showed towards him.&lt;ref name="Tench"&gt;{{Citation | title = A Complete Account of the Settlement at Port Jackson | first = Watkin | last = Tench | chapter = Chapter viii | url = http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/t/tench/watkin/settlement/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governor Phillip's Military Expeditions===
An irate Governor Phillip ordered Lieutenant Tench to gather his company of marines and lead an expedition against the Bidjigal in retaliation for Pemulwuy's attack on McIntyre.  He ordered that two Bidjigal were to be captured and ten killed; these ten were then to be beheaded and the heads returned to the settlement. Tench swiftly suggested an alternative and less bloodthirsty plan, that six Bidjigal be captured and brought to Sydney Cove but that none be killed out of hand.&lt;ref name=Moore118&gt;Moore 1987, pp. 117-118&lt;/ref&gt;

Tench's proposal was accepted, and the expedition set out on 14 December in search of Pemulwuy and the Bidjigal tribe. The expedition was the largest military operation since the founding of the colony, comprising Tench, Lieutenants [[William Dawes (British Marines officer)|William Dawes]] and John Poulden, and 46 marines. However, despite three days of searching there was no sign of the Bidjigal. On 17 December Tench ordered a return to Sydney Cove to gather supplies.&lt;ref name=Moore118/&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Moore 1987, pp. 118-119&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Resistance===
Pemulwuy persuaded the [[Eora]], [[Darug people|Dharug]] and [[Tharawal people]] to join his campaign against the settlers
. From 1792 Pemulwuy led raids on settlers from [[Parramatta]], [[Georges River]], [[Prospect, New South Wales|Prospect]], [[Toongabbie]], [[Brickfield Hill|Brickfield]] and [[Hawkesbury River]]. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}} His most common tactic was to burn crops and kill livestock.&lt;ref name="message one"/&gt; In May 1795, Pemulwuy or one of his followers speared a convict near present-day Chippendale.&lt;ref name="smh"&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/11/01/1067597158244.html Keith Vincent Smith, "Australia's oldest murder mystery", ''Sydney Morning Herald'' 1 November 2003] accessed 26 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1795, Pemulwuy and his warriors attacked a work party at [[Botany Bay]] which included [[John Caesar|Black Caesar]]. Caesar managed to crack Pemulwuy's skull and many thought he had killed him, but the warrior survived and escaped. But this critically injured him afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2013/march/1361848257/shane-maloney/pemulwuy-black-caesar Shane Moloney, "Pemulwuy &amp; Black Caesar", ''The Monthly'' March, 2013] accessed 26 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | newspaper = "The Sun Herald" | date = 16 February 2008 | url = http://blogs.sunherald.com.au/whoweare/archives/2008/03/who_we_are_the_11.html | title = WHO WE ARE: The man who nearly changed everything | first = David | last = Dale}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J Henniker Heaton, ''Australian Dictionary of Dates and Men of the Time'', Sydney, 1873&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Al Grassby and Marji Hill, ''Six Australian Battlefields'', North Ryde: Angus &amp;Robertson, 1988:99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nma.gov.au/online_features/defining_moments/featured/pemulwuy |title= Pemulwuy |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Escape===
Despite still having buckshot in his head and body, and wearing a leg-iron, Pemulwuy escaped from the hospital. This added to the belief that he was a ''carradhy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pemulwuy|url=http://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/pemulwuy|work=Dictionary of Sydney|publisher=www.dictionaryofsydney.org|accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pemulwuy recommenced his fighting against the British by November 1797. However his injuries had affected his ability as a fighter and his resistance was on a smaller and more sporadic scale for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="message two"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/tv/messagestick/stories/s2899743.htm "Pemulwuy: A War of Two Laws Part 2", ''Message Stick'' Sunday 16 May 2010, 1:30pm ABC1] accessed 3 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Convicts William Knight and Thomas Thrush escaped and joined the aboriginal resistance.&lt;ref name="smh"/&gt;

According to Richard Green, "with simple spears, rocks, boomerangs, stones, he [Pemulwuy] defeated the British army that they sent here. Every single soldier except for Watkin Tench, that they sent in pursuit of Pemulwuy either walked back into the community with their saddle over their shoulders or they didn't make it back."&lt;ref name="message one"/&gt;

==Death==
Governor [[Philip Gidley King]] issued an order on 22 November 1801 for bringing Pemulwuy in dead or alive, with an associated reward.   The order attributed the killing of two men, the dangerous wounding of several, and a number of robberies to Pemulwuy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor = F. M. Bladen | title = Historical Records of New South Wales | volume = IV — HUNTER AND KING | page = 629 | chapter = Government and General Order. 22 November 1801. | url = http://publications.nsw.gov.au/1241-historical-records-of-nsw-vol-4-hunter-and-king-1800-1801- | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110406134930/http://publications.nsw.gov.au/1241-historical-records-of-nsw-vol-4-hunter-and-king-1800-1801- | archivedate = 6 April 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 June 1802 Pemulwuy was shot and killed by a blinded British sailor [[Henry Hacking]], the first mate of the English ship {{HMS|Lady Nelson|1798|2}}.&lt;ref name="smh"/&gt;

"After being wounded, all the people believed that he was immune to British bullets," says Richard Green. "So he'd stand out in front and, you know, stand right out in front of them and take them on, you know? So after 12 years, his time ran out. He got his shot and he took it."&lt;ref name="message two"/&gt;

Following the death of Pemulwuy, Governor King wrote to Lord Hobart that on the death of Pemulwuy he was given his head by the Aboriginal people as Pemulwuy "had been the cause of all that had happened".  The Governor issued orders with immediate effect to not "molest or ill-treat any native", and to re-admit them to the areas of Parramatta and [[Prospect Hill (New South Wales)|Prospect]] from which they had been forcibly excluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor = F. M. Bladen | title = Historical Records of New South Wales | volume = IV — HUNTER AND KING | page = 868 | chapter = Governor King to Lord Hobart. 30 October 1802 | url = http://publications.nsw.gov.au/1241-historical-records-of-nsw-vol-4-hunter-and-king-1800-1801- | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110406134930/http://publications.nsw.gov.au/1241-historical-records-of-nsw-vol-4-hunter-and-king-1800-1801- | archivedate = 6 April 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pemulwuy's head was preserved in spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47152902|title=Aboriginal Sydney : a guide to important places of the past and present|last=Studies.|first=Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander|date=2001-01-01|publisher=Aboriginal Studies Press|year=|isbn=0855753706|location=|pages=141|oclc=47152902|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was sent to [[England]] to  [[Joseph Banks|Sir Joseph Banks]] accompanied by a letter from Governor King, who wrote: "Although a terrible pest to the colony, he was a brave and independent character."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor = F.

Pemulway's son [[Tedbury]] continued the struggle for a number of years before being killed in 1810.

===Skull===
Repatriation of the skull of Pemulwuy has been requested by Sydney Aboriginal people. It has not yet been located in order to be repatriated. In 2010 [[Prince William]] announced he would return Pemulwuy's skull to his Aboriginal relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/article2469217.ece | title = Prince William takes up search for lost Aboriginal skull| publisher = The Times]| date = 2010-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The Sydney suburb of [[Pemulwuy, New South Wales]] is named after him,&lt;ref&gt;{{NSW GNR|id = MnqwWysESX|title = Pemulwuy|accessdate = 7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Pemulwuy Park in [[Redfern, New South Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | publisher = City of Sydney | url = http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/aboutsydney/historyandarchives/SydneyHistory/ParksHistory/PemulwuyPark.asp | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110316135028/http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/AboutSydney/HistoryAndArchives/SydneyHistory/ParksHistory/PemulwuyPark.asp | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 16 March 2011 | accessdate = 26 October 2010 | title = Pemulwuy Park, Redfern }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s the band [[Redgum]] composed a song about Pemulwuy entitled "Water and Stone".&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|PHOIpCZtRs0|Redgum - Water and Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first song on [[James Asher]]'s 1996 new age album ''Feet In The Soil'' is entitled "Pemulwuy", and the last song is entitled "Pemulwuy Returns". Both feature [[didgeridoo]]s.

Australian composer [[Paul Jarman]] composed a choral work entitled ''Pemulwuy''.  It has become an Australian choral standard, and was performed by the [[Brisbane Birralee Voices|Biralee Blokes]] in their victory in the ABC Choir of the Year 2006.

In 1987 Weldons published "Pemulwuy: The Rainbow Warrior" by Eric Willmot, a best-selling novel providing a fictionalised account using early colonial documents as source. Matilda Media re-released the book in 1994 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pemulwuy: The Rainbow Warrior|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Pemulwuy.html?id=mfTpAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|work=Google Books|publisher=Google|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The redevelopment of [[The Block (Sydney)|The Block]] in the Sydney suburb of [[Redfern, New South Wales|Redfern]] by the Aboriginal Housing Company has been called the Pemulwuy Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.ahc.org.au/ | publisher = Aboriginal Housing Company | title = Redevelopment News | accessdate = 4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 [[Marlene Cummins]] released an eponymous song about Pemulwuy. This was later presented to [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William]] along with a petition to bring Pemulwuy's head back to his people.&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite web|title=Local Heroes: Marlene Cummins|url=http://www.abc.net.au/indigenous/stories/s2897200.htm|website=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 a remote boxing game for the [[Wii]] console, [[Pemulwuy Dream Team]], was developed.

In 2015 the [[National Museum of Australia]] installed a plaque honouring his role in Australian history as part of the ''Defining Moments''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Defining Moments in Australian History|url=http://www.nma.gov.au/online_features/defining_moments|website=National Museum Australia|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maher|first1=Louise|title=Pemulwuy: Commemorating Australia's first Aboriginal resistance leader at the National Museum|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-20/commemorating-australias-first-aboriginal-resistance-leader/6332964?WT.ac=infocus_sydney|website=ABC news|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 a [[Sydney Ferries]] [[Emerald-class ferry]] was named ''Pemulwuy''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20171004191108/https://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/newsroom-and-events/articles/pemulwuy-arrives-sydney-harbour Pemulwuy arrives in Sydney] Transport for New South Wales 30 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:PostalorderTBack.jpg|right|thumb|One of the most famous postal orders in history – the one alleged to have been cashed by [[George Archer-Shee]]]]
A '''postal order''' is a financial instrument usually intended for sending money through the mail. It is purchased at a [[post office]] and is payable at another post office to the named recipient. A small fee for the service, known as [[poundage]], is paid by the purchaser. In the United States, this is known as a postal [[money order]]. Postal orders are not [[legal tender]], but a type of [[promissory note]], similar to a [[cheque]].

==History in the United Kingdom==

[[Image:Irl 9shillingPO.png|thumb|right|[[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] 9 [[Shilling#Irish shillings|shilling]] postal order with additional [[Postage stamp|stamp]] used in 1969. Used postal orders are seldom seen because most were destroyed when they were redeemed or cashed at the [[Minister for Posts and Telegraphs|post office]] or [[List of Irish companies#Banks.2FFinancial Institutions|bank]].]]
The postal order is a direct descendent of the [[money order]], which had been established by a private company in 1792. During World War I and World War II, British postal orders were temporarily declared legal tender to save paper and labour. Postal orders can be bought and redeemed at [[post office]]s in the UK, although a crossed postal order must be paid into a bank account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Postal orders | work = | publisher = [[Post Office Ltd.]] | year = 2013 | url = http://www.postoffice.co.uk/postal-orders | accessdate = 2013-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Until April 2006 they came in fixed [[Denomination (currency)|denominations]] but due to increased popularity they were redesigned to make them more flexible and secure. They now have the payee and value added at the time of purchase, making them more like a cheque. The fee for using this form of payment falls into one of three bands - details are available on the [http://www.postoffice.co.uk/postal-orders Post Office website]. The maximum value of postal order available is £250.00 with the fee capped at £12.50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Fee structure | work = | publisher = [[Post Office Ltd.]] | year = 2013 | url = http://www.postoffice.co.uk/postal-orders | accessdate = 2013-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite competition from cheques and [[electronic money|electronic funds transfer]], postal orders continue to appeal to customers, especially as a form of payment for shopping on the Internet, as they are drawn on the Post Office's accounts so a vendor can be certain that they will not bounce. They also enable those without a bank account, including minors, to make small financial transactions without the need for cash. Postal workers in the United Kingdom use voided or cancelled orders in their training.&lt;ref&gt;"Another view" by Douglas Myall in ''[[British Philatelic Bulletin]]'', Vol. 51, No. 5, January 2014, pp. 149-151.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International use of the British postal order==

[[File:New Zealand 1952 20 Shillings Postal Note.jpg|thumbnail|right|A New Zealand 20 Shillings postal note of 1952]]
The use of postal orders (or postal notes in some countries) was extended to most countries that are now part of the British Commonwealth of Nations, plus to a few foreign countries such as Jordan, Egypt and Thailand.

==The United States==

United States Postal Money Orders appear facially as a draft against an account held by the United States Postal Service, and the United States Postal Service requires a purchaser to know, in advance, where presentment of the instrument will occur. Only special, more expensive United States International Postal Money Orders may be presented abroad.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} In the United States, international money orders are pink and domestic money orders are green.

==Canada==

See also [[Postal orders of Canada]].

Canada had its own postal orders (called Postal Notes) from 1898 until 1 April 1949, when these were discontinued and withdrawn.

A [[British Forces Post Office]] in [[Suffield, Alberta]] was issuing [[British Postal Orders]] as late as July 2006.

==Collecting==

Postal orders are gaining in popularity as collectibles, especially among numismatists who collect banknotes.

There is an active [[numismatics|numismatic]] organisation in the UK called the [[Postal Order Society]] that was established in 1985 with members both domestically and overseas. They hold twice-yearly postal auctions of postal orders and related material from across the British Commonwealth.

==Canteen orders==

[[File:1943 Australia Defence Canteen order.jpg|thumb|Not used as the recipient was at an RAF base in England and presumably had no ready access to an Australian canteen.]]

A Defence canteen order was a variant of a postal order used in Australia during [[World War II]]. Purchased at a post office, it was payable to an enlisted person in goods from a canteen rather than being a cash instrument.

The '''[[postmodern]] social construction of nature''' is a [[theorem]] or speculation of postmodernist [[continental philosophy]] that poses an alternative critique of previous mainstream, [[Prometheanism|Promethean]] discourse about [[environmental sustainability]] and [[ecopolitics]].

==Position==
Whereas traditional [[criticisms of environmentalism]] {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} come from the more conservative "right" of politics, [[leftist]] critiques of nature pioneered by postmodernist constructionism highlight{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} the need to recognise "[[Other (philosophy)|the other]]".  The implicit assumption made by theorists like Wapner&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.questia.com/library/book/environmental-activism-and-world-civic-politics-by-paul-wapner.jsp| title =
Environmental Activism and World Politics | year =  1996| work = Paul Wapner| accessdate = 2007-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://muse.jhu.edu/demo/global_environmental_politics/v003/3.1wapner.html| title =
World summit on sustainable development | year =  2003| work = Paul Wapner| accessdate = 2007-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; refer to it as a new "response to [[ecocriticism]] [which] would require critics to acknowledge the ways in which they themselves silence nature and then to respect the sheer [[Other (philosophy)|other]]ness of the non-human world."

==Criticism==
Critics argue that, by capturing the nonhuman world within its own conceptual domain, postmodern exerts precisely the urge toward mastery that it criticizes in  modernity. Thus, postmodern cultural criticism deepens the modernist urge toward mastery by eliminating the ontological weight of the nonhuman world. "What else could it mean to assert that there is no such thing as nature?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://dissentmagazine.org/article/?article=539| title =
Leftist Criticism of Nature | date =  Fall 2003| work = Dissent Magazine| accessdate = 2007-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue becomes an existentialist query about whether nature can exist in a humanist critique, and whether we can discern the "others'" views in relation to our actions on their behalf. This is referred to as the [[Wapner Paradox]]&lt;!-- is this really the Banach–Tarski paradox or the Euclidian one?--&gt;.

==See also==
[[David Demeritt]]'s typology of the social construction of nature looks at the idea from several standpoints. He seeks to clarify the meaning through exploring the extent of the different uses applied to the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://phg.sagepub.com/cgi/content/short/26/6/767| title =

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5938">'''Settlement archaeology''' (German:''Siedlungsarchäologie'') is a branch of modern [[archaeology]]. It investigates former settlements and deserted areas, forms of housing and settlements, and the prehistoric settlement of entire regions. For this purpose, the forms, functions and developments of individual habitats and settlement systems are explored by means of archaeological surveys and excavation. Settlement archaeology has developed in close cooperation with settlement history and settlement geography. Settlement sequences of several centuries or millennia are explored in individual areas. Changes and consistent elements can be studied and compared with other researched settlements. Archaeological methods are used including [[archaeobotany]] and [[Archaeozoology|-zoology]] and [[Spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] [[phosphate]] analysis to resolve archaeological questions, mostly in the field of prehistory and early history.

==Settlement archaeology as the archaeology of peoples==  
The term settlement archaeology initially referred to a research methodology whose most important exponent was [[Gustaf Kossinna]], who developed his "settlement archaeology method" beginning in 1887. According to Kossinna and his disciples, [[Archaeological culture|cultures]], [[cultural area]]s and, ultimately, settlement areas of ethnic groups can be deduced through types and their [[Assemblage (archaeology)|assemblages]]. This equation of "archaeological culture", ethnicity, and race led, especially during [[National Socialist]] rule, to a fateful and alarming combination of archaeological research with racial ideology. One of the core tenets of Kossina's teaching was that sharply defined archaeological cultural areas coincide at all times with particular peoples (''Völkern'') or tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kossinna |first1=Gustaf |title=Die Herkunft der Germanen: zur methode der Siedlungsarchäologie |date=1911 |publisher=C. Kabitzsch |location=Würzburg | language=de|page=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DLiYugEACAAJ}}"Scharf umgrenzte archäologische Kulturprovinzen decken sich zu allen Zeiten mit ganz bestimmten Völkern oder Völkerstämmen"&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about the "ethnic interpretation" of prehistoric finds, answers were sought by linking "archaeological" with "historical" methods. Kossinna said that the basis of his "settlement archaeological method" was that it makes use of analogy which enlightens dimly-illuminated ancient times by inferences from the better-known present or even ages which, though still ancient, are marked by rich tradition. It illuminates prehistoric times by those which stand in the light of history.&lt;ref&gt;"sich des Analogieschlußes [bedient], insofern sie die Erhellung uralter, dunkler Zeiten durch Rückschlüsse aus der klaren Gegenwart oder aus zwar ebenfalls noch alten, jedoch durch reiche Überlieferung ausgezeichneten Epochen vornimmt. Sie erhellt vorgeschichtliche Zeiten durch solche, die in geschichtlichem Lichte stehen.“&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Postwar|Postwar Era]] the empirical collecting of facts and their chronological and spatial arrangement was declared the main goal of research, which set the final course for today's German archaeology. Theoretical approaches moved to the background.

==Modern settlement archeology==  
Since the 1920s more and more works have emerged in which individual regions have been archaeologically researched. At the same time, more emphasis was placed on investigating the settlements themselves. Researchers such as [[Gerhard Bersu]], Hermann Stoll, and Robert Rudolf Schmidt, who worked mainly in southern Germany, were among this pioneering phase of modern settlement archeology. The excavations at the [[Federsee]], for example, involved the natural sciences at an early stage ([[pollen analysis]] (Palynology), moor geology and [[geomorphology]], [[dendrochronology]], [[radiocarbon dating]], [[archaeozoology]] and [[archaeobotany]], [[paleoclimatology]], material research, etc.). However, especially during the [[Third Reich]] under the direction of [[Hans Reinerth]], the ideological abuse of settlement archaeology was particularly evident. In the end, however, important impulses for the establishment and methodical definition came mainly from the north: the excavations in Haithabu ([[Hedeby]] as well as the investigations at Wurten on the North Sea coast such as [[Feddersen Wierde]] near [[Cuxhaven]] by Werner Haarnagel were seminal. The archaeologist [[Herbert Jankuhn]] is associated with the formulation of this redefinition of settlement archeology.  Jankuhn was a proponent of Kossinna's methods of settlement archeology during the period of in [[National Socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mahsarski |first1=Dirk |title=Herbert Jankuhn (1905 - 1990) : ein deutscher Prähistoriker zwischen nationalsozialistischer Ideologie und wissenschaftlicher Objektivität | language=de |url=https://www.academia.edu/12776827/Herbert_Jankuhn_1905_-_1990_ein_deutscher_Pr%C3%A4historiker_zwischen_nationalsozialistischer_Ideologie_und_wissenschaftlicher_Objektivit%C3%A4t_Dirk_Mahsarski._-_Rahden_Westf._Leidorf_2011._-_VI_381_S._Ill._30_cm._-_Internationale_Arch%C3%A4ologie_114_._-_ISBN_978-3-89646-459-0_EUR_64.80 |website=academia.edu |accessdate=Oct 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New trends==  
More recently the focus has increasingly been on the individual settlement and the aanalysis of landscapes and territories, mostly using [[geographic information system]]s (GIS). Today the term [[landscape archaeology]] is preferred. The long-standing role of natural sciences in settlement archeology has recently further increased, and [[geography]], [[geology]], [[zoology]], [[botany]], and [[anthropology]] have been increasingly used in the field of [[soil science]], which is reflected, for example, in the field of [[geoarchaeology]].

The '''Songze Culture''' was a [[Neolithic]] culture that existed between 3800 and 3300 BCE in the [[Lake Tai]] area near [[Shanghai]].{{sfnp|Wang|2001|p=220}}{{sfnp|Qin|2013|p=578}}

==Dates==
Three radiocarbon dates were taken from Songze culture layers at Jiangli near [[Lake Tai]]. Two of the dates were obtained from charred rice grains, returning dates of 3360-3090 BCE and 3540-3370 BCE. The third date was taken from [[Polygonum aviculare|knotgrass]] and produced a date of 3660-3620 BCE.{{sfnp|Qiu et al.|2014}} Although it is accepted to be the successor of the [[Majiabang culture]], others have suggested that Songze was a successor phase to the [[Hemudu culture]].{{sfnp|Goodenough|1993|p=45}}

==Sites==
===Songze===
In 1957, archaeologists discovered a site north of Songze Village near Zhaoxiang Town {{zh|c=赵巷镇}} in Shanghai's [[Qingpu District, Shanghai|Qingpu District]].{{sfnp|Shanghai Qingpu Museum|2014}} Excavations have been conducted throughout 1961, 1974-1976, 1987, 1994-1995, and 2004. These revealed three cultural layers: the most recent had [[pottery]] from the [[Spring and Autumn period]]; the middle layer was a cemetery with 148 graves and numerous artefacts; the oldest layer belonged to a village of the [[Majiabang culture]].{{sfnp|Shanghai Qingpu Museum|2014}}

===Nanhebang===
92 graves have been excavated from a Songze cemetery at Nanhebang.{{sfnp|Li|2012|p=134}}

===Pishan===
The Pishan cemetery contained 61 burials.{{sfnp|Li|2012|p=134}}

===Dongshan===
Dongshan Village is located near Jingang Town 18 km west of [[Zhangjiagang]]. It was discovered in 1989 and has undergone excavations by the [[Suzhou Museum]] (1989-1990), followed by two large [[Rescue archaeology|rescue excavations]] led by the [[Nanjing Museum]] in 2008-2009.{{sfnp|Li|2012|p=135}} The site is divided into three areas: area 1 was a small cemetery of 27 burials, all of which had different quantities of [[grave goods]], which has been used to suggest the existence of a [[Social_stratification#Anthropological_theories|stratified society]]; area 2 was a residential comprising five buildings in the centre of the site; area 3 was another burial ground in the site's west, with 10 tombs.{{sfnp|Li|2012|p=135}}

In geology a '''succession''' is series of [[stratum|strata]] or rock units in [[chronology|chronological]] order. Rock successions can be seen in cross-sections through rock, for example in a road cutting or cliff. With sedimentary layers of rocks, newer units will be above older units.

[[File:Hobart City Sullivans Cove.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Sullivans Cove, Hobart]]
'''Sullivans Cove''' is on the [[Derwent River, Tasmania|River Derwent]] adjacent to the [[Hobart CBD]] in [[Tasmania]]. 

It was the site of initial European settlement in the area, and the location of the earlier components of the [[Port of Hobart]].

==History==
The Cove was the initial landing site of what is now the city of [[Hobart]].  It was founded on 21 February 1804 by [[Lieutenant Governor]] [[David Collins (governor)|David Collins]], who travelled to the shore via what was then a rocky island named Hunter Island. The connection to the shore was developed and is now known as Hunter Street. The island now has a building directly above it.

Although the first European settlement in the state was further up the river at [[Risdon Cove]] by John Bowen a year earlier, that settlement was abandoned and relocated to join the Sullivans Cove settlers.

Collins named Sullivans Cove after John Sullivan, Permanent Under Secretary to the Colonies.

==Current==
Sullivans Cove holds large historical and sentimental value for the city.  The cove area itself is now known as Macquarie Wharf and serves as the main [[port]] for the city. Many of the original buildings along the [[esplanade]] are still standing.

The [[University of Tasmania]]'s School of the Arts building is based on Hunter Street.

A serviced [[apartment]] building, ''ZeroDavey'', has drawn criticism for its Davey Street facade, being condemned by the local community as aesthetically unpleasing consisting of a grey concrete prefabricated wall with jarring blue metal ledges, as opposed to the rest of the building having a sandstone facade to blend with the heritage Hunter Street buildings next door.

During 2004 there has also been discussions about a proposal for a tourist [[tram]] from Sullivans Cove to the CBD, and possibly to [[North Hobart, Tasmania|North Hobart]].

An international design competition was held for the Hobart waterfront in 2006.  It attracted 280 entries from over 50 countries.  Three winners were announced on January 26, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hwidc.tas.gov.au|title=Hobart Waterfront International Design Competition|accessdate=30 January 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206175315/http://www.hwidc.tas.gov.au/|archivedate=6 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the change in the cove's primary activity from a freight port to tourism and recreational uses, many of the sheds in the area have been either re-purposed or replaced – notably, all buildings keep the former gabled roof architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.themercury.com.au/lifestyle/design-guru-robert-morriss-nunn-sees-hobarts-future-floating-on-water/story-fnj64o6u-1226777469213|title=Design guru Robert Morris-Nunn sees Hobart's future floating on water|work=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]]|date=7 December 2013|accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These buildings include:

'''Tadeusz Czacki''' (28 August 1765 in [[Pavlivka, Volyn Oblast|Poryck]], [[Volhynia]] – 8 February 1813 in [[Dubno]]) was a [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish]] [[historian]], [[pedagogue]] and [[numismatics|numismatist]]. Czacki played an important part in the [[Enlightenment in Poland]].

==Biography==
Czacki was born in Poryck in Volhynia, [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], now Pavlivka in [[Ukraine]]. When [[Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski|Prince Adam Czartoryski]] was placed at the head of the educational district of [[Vilnius]], Czacki was appointed school inspector of [[Volhynia]], [[Podolia]], and the [[Ukraine]]. An opponent of the [[Jesuits]], he combated their work in the field of pedagogy, and on one occasion raised by public subscription the sum of two millions of Polish florins to insure the existence of the gymnasiums in [[Vinnitsa]] and [[Kiev]]. In 1805 he founded the high school in Kremenetz, Volhynia (the [[Liceum Krzemienieckie]]). After Czacki's death his heart was deposited in one of the halls of this Volhynian school, under the inscription "Ubi thesaurus tuus, ibi est cor tuum" (Where your treasury lies, there lies your heart). He discovered what was thought at the time to be the grave of [[Copernicus]]; however, controversy over its location [[Nicolaus Copernicus#Death|continued]] long afterwards. He also was a panel member of the [[Komisja Edukacji Narodowej]], founded by [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]] in 1773 and considered to be the world's first ministry of education.

From 1786 to 1792 he worked for the Polish Commission of the Treasury and was responsible for supervising Jewish affairs in the country.  During this time and afterwards, he worked for the emancipation of Jews in Poland. Exemption from the poll-tax was granted in 1775 to those who would apply themselves to agriculture, and by 1787, owing to Czacki's efforts while in the treasury (see his report of 1787 on the Ruthenian and Ukrainian provinces), he had the satisfaction of seeing a few scores of families enjoying that privilege.  Furthermore, he co-wrote the [[Constitution of 3 May 1791]], and founded the [[Warsaw Society of Friends of Learning|Towarzystwo Przyjaciół Nauk]] (''Society of Friends of Science'').

In 1786 he was awarded the [[Order of Saint Stanislaus]], and in 1792 the [[Order of the White Eagle (Poland)|Order of the White Eagle]].

==Writings==
Czacki's ''Rozprawa o Zydach'' (Discourse on the Jews), first published in Wilna 1807, and translated into Russian by Basil Anastaszewicz, passed through several editions, and was published finally in ''Dzieła Tadeusza Czackiego'' (Works of Tadeusz Czacki), edited by Edward Raczyński, Posen, 1845 (iii. 138-270). For the history of the Jewish institutions, Czacki, who did not know [[Hebrew]], availed himself of the only sources open to him; namely, [[Giulio Bartolocci|Bartolocci]] and Ugolino.  After relating the early history of the Jews, Czacki describes their situation among the Arabs, Italians, Spaniards, French, Germans, and Hungarians. He tells of their entrance into Poland in the twelfth century; of their intellectual condition; of their government and laws; and of the persecutions to which they were subjected.

He also wrote a short discourse on the [[Karaite (Jewish sect)|Karaites]] (''Dzieła Tadeusza Czackiego'', iii. 271-285) which attempts to explain, on the basis of the sources accessible to the author and referred to above, "what the Karaites are, and wherein they chiefly differ from other Jews; when their separation occurred; and in what countries they dwell."

Czcki's, who himself had been interested in [[Lithuanian language]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Clash Of Nationalities At The University Of Vilnius, 1803-1832 |journal=[[Lituanus]]|date=Summer 1981|first=Stasys|last=Yla|volume=27|issue=1|pages=|id= |url=http://www.lituanus.org/1981_2/81_2_03.htm|accessdate=2008-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; published a work on law in a two volumes ''About Lithuanian and Polish laws, their spirit, their origins and about things discussed in the first [[Lithuanian Statutes|Lithuanian Statute]] of the year 1529'' {{lang-pl|O litewskich i polskich prawach, o ich duchu, źródłach, związku i o rzeczach zawartych w pierwszem Statucie dla Litwy 1529 roku}},&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}}[http://pbc.biaman.pl/dlibra/docmetadata?id=83&amp;from=publication&amp;tab=1 Full text of the work]&lt;/ref&gt; explaining differences of the two [[nation]]s within [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|the former Commonwealth]].

The '''Kotahitanga''' movement was an autonomous Māori Parliament convened annually in [[New Zealand]] from 1892 until 1902. Though not recognised by the [[New Zealand Government]], the Māori Parliament was an influential body while it lasted. By 1902 its role was largely superseded by the Māori Councils established by [[James Carroll (New Zealand politician)|James Carroll]] and [[Hone Heke Ngapua]] through the Māori Councils Act 1900. As a result, Kotahitanga members unanimously voted for its dissolution at the 10th Parliament at Waiōmatatini in 1902. 

Te Kotahitanga was distinct from [[Te Kauhanganui]], the Māori parliament established by the [[Kingitanga]] movement in the late 1880s, because it called for the union of all Māori tribes, whereas [[Te Kauhanganui]] was convened by and for the [[hapu]] of the Waikato-Tainui region. In 1895 the two movements considered merging, but this ultimately failed.

== Sessions ==
===Waipatu 1892===
The first formal session of Te Kotahitanga was held in June 1892 at Waipatu in [[Heretaunga Plains|Heretaunga]]. It was hosted by the former [[New Zealand Parliament|Member of Parliament]] for the [[Eastern Maori]] electorate, [[Henare Tomoana]]. 96 representatives sat in the ''Whare o Raro'' and 44 chiefs sat in the ''Whare Ariki''. Tomoana was elected [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker of the House]] because his tenure in parliament gave him the experience necessary to guide debates and maintain order. [[Hoani Te Whatahoro Jury]] was elected Chairman, the formal head of the ''Whare o Raro'', and [[Hamiora Mangakahia]] was elected premier, a position that made him the chief spokesperson for the movement.

===Waipatu 1893===
In 1893 the second session of Te Kotahitanga was also convened at Waipatu, though this session was poorly attended. Only 58 representatives sat in the ''Whare o Raro''. At that time, Mangakahia had fallen out of favour with many of the movement's representatives and was not returned as premier. [[Hoani Te Whatahoro Jury]] was elected in his place.
===Pakirikiri 1894===
The 1894 session took place at Pakirikiri, near [[Gisborne New Zealand|Gisborne]]. The session, hosted by local chief [[Otene Pitau]], was well attended and lasted for over a month.
===Rotorua 1895===
The 1895 session of Te Kotahitanga was convened at Ohinemotu in Rotorua. [[Hamiora Mangakahia]] was re-elected for a second term as premier, and the role of speaker was given to [[Mohi Te Atahikoia]] of Ngāti Kahungunu. In the course of this session, [[Henare Tomoana]] accused Mangakahia of financial mismanagement of Te Kotahitanga during his first term as premier, and attempted to force his resignation. But Mangakahia was able to demonstrate in rebuttal that the mismanagement of Kotahitanga funds had actually developed during the term of his successor, [[Hoani Te Whatahoro Jury]].&lt;ref name="DNZB Mangakahia"&gt;{{DNZB|Ballara|Angela|2m29|Hamiora Mangakahia|27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The session is also notable as the setting for a potential merger of Te Kotahitanga with the [[Kingitanga]] movement. [[Mahuta Tāwhiao]], the new King of the Waikato-Tainui tribes, was visited by representatives from the 1895 sitting of Te Kotahitanga, who invited him to sign the Kotahitanga deed of union, calling for the political union of all Māori tribes. Mahuta appointed a committee to consider the proposal, but was undermined by Waikato chief [[Tupu Atanatiu Taingakawa Te Waharoa]], who circulated a rival deed of union calling for all Māori tribes to unite under the [[Kingitanga]].

== Membership ==
The lower house, or ''Whare o Raro'', had 96 members, elected at large from electorates defined according to tribal affiliation. The upper house, or ''Whare Ariki'', was composed of 44 paramount chiefs elected by the members of the ''Whare o Raro''. 127 representatives filled the 140 positions in both houses at the parliament's first sitting at Waipatu Marae in 1892, as 13 chiefs were elected to both houses.

=== Reception ===
Chakravarti's ''Social Dimensions of Early Buddhism'', based on her doctoral thesis,&lt;ref name=Kaul&gt;
{{citation |last=Kaul |first=Shonaleeka |title=Peopling history |newspaper=Frontline |volume=23 |number=23 |date=18 November 2006 |url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2323/stories/20061201000307200.htm}}
&lt;/ref&gt; is regarded as a classic piece of work, forming mandatory reading for all students of early Indian history.{{sfn|Kumkum Roy, Insights and Interventions|2011|p=1}} Chakravarti based her analysis on the Buddhist texts written in [[Pali language|Pali]], the language spoken by the commoners in early India, ... In her later work, she built on this research to reformulate the issues of social stratification, labour, renunciation and domesticity in early India, with a firm focus on gender, caste and class.&lt;ref name=Tellis/&gt;

''Everyday Lives, Everyday Histories'' is a compilation of 14 essays derived from three decades of work on the history of early India, previously published in various journals and collections. Scholar Shonaleeka Kaul states that the anthology still retains freshness because it represents a "new take on early Indian history," presenting an understanding of the past beyond the vantage of the elite and the orthodox (the "Kings and Brahmanas"). It is the history of the people on the "margins," where margins is translated as "labouring groups including women who labour and women as a wider category."&lt;ref name=Kaul/&gt; The Introductory chapter offers an account of Chakravarti's own journey through the women's movement as well as her production of India's first feminism-informed histories.&lt;ref name=Tellis/&gt;

'''William Nicolas Hutton''' (born 21 May 1950) is a British [[political economist]], academic administrator, and journalist. He is currently Principal of [[Hertford College]], [[University of Oxford]], and Chair of the Big Innovation Centre,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Will Hutton|url=http://www.biginnovationcentre.com/Aboutus/Our-People/7/Will-Hutton|publisher=Big Innovation Centre|accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; an initiative from [[the Work Foundation]] (formerly the Industrial Society), having been chief executive of the Work Foundation from 2000 to 2008. He was formerly [[editor-in-chief]] for ''[[The Observer]]''. He is widely known for his advocacy of centre-left policies, criticisms of the [[neoliberal]] economic consensus, and his long association with key members and policies of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].

==Early life==
Although born in Woolwich, where his father had worked at the [[Royal Ordnance]] factory ([[Royal Arsenal]]), Hutton began his education in Scotland. He went to Bishopton Primary School in [[Bishopton, Renfrewshire]], then [[Paisley Grammar School]] when he was eight. His father moved to [[Bromley]], then in [[Kent]], and he attended Southborough Lane County Primary School in [[Petts Wood]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/passedfailed-an-education-in-the-life-of-will-hutton-author-and-former-newspaper-editor-1707511.html Passed/Failed: An education in the life of Will Hutton, author and former newspaper editor] The Independent, 18 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Hutton studied at [[Chislehurst and Sidcup Grammar School]] in [[Sidcup]], where he was introduced to [[Advanced Level (UK)|A level]] economics by a teacher, Garth Pinkney. He only got average marks at O-level, but enjoyed the sixth form more, studying geography, history and economics. He organised the school tennis team. After studying sociology and economics at the [[University of Bristol]]&lt;ref name=doyle&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/199905310016 The NS Profile – Will Hutton] New Statesman, 31 May 1999&lt;/ref&gt; gaining a [[Bachelor of Social Science|BSocSc]] (2.1), he started his career as an equity salesman for a [[brokerage firm|stock broker]], before leaving to study for an MBA at [[INSEAD]] at [[Fontainebleau]] near Paris.

==Career==
[[File:Vince Cable &amp; Will Hutton.jpg|thumb|left|Hutton (right) with [[Vince Cable]] in 2013]]
Hutton moved on to work in television and radio, spending ten years with the [[BBC]], including working as economics correspondent for ''[[Newsnight]]'' from 1983 to 1988, where he replaced [[Peter Hobday (presenter)|Peter Hobday]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/sep/29/market-forces-bbc-economics-stephanie-flanders&lt;/ref&gt; He spent four years as editor-in-chief at ''The Observer'' and director of the [[Guardian Media Group|Guardian National Newspapers]] before joining the Industrial Society, now known as The Work Foundation, as chief executive in 2000. In 2010 he was criticised for his handling of the Industrial Society by a number of publications including The Sunday Times and Private Eye, for having sold the company's "family jewels". The Work Foundation ceased to be financially viable and was sold to Lancaster University.&lt;ref&gt;^ "Will Hutton 'sold out' work charity". Sunday Times article by Jon Ungoed-Thomas 31 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as a columnist, author and chief executive, Hutton is a governor of [[London School of Economics]], a visiting professor at the [[University of Manchester]] Business School and the [[University of Bristol]], a visiting fellow at [[Mansfield College, Oxford|Mansfield College Oxford]], a shareholder of the [[Scott Trust Limited]] which owns the [[Guardian Media Group]], [[rapporteur]] of the [[Kok Group]] and a member of the [[Design Council]]'s [[Millennium Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theworkfoundation.com/aboutus/biographydetail.aspx?oItemId=58&amp;parentPageID=332 Our People – Will Hutton]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, he was appointed as Principal of [[Hertford College, Oxford]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hertford College |url=http://www.hertford.ox.ac.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=727&amp;Itemid=104 |title=Hertford College &amp;#124; University of Oxford |publisher=Hertford.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; taking up the post later in the year. He continues to be associated with the Work Foundation as chair-designate of a major new initiative on innovation. He sits on the European Advisory Board of [[Princeton University Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://press.princeton.edu/about_pup/european_advisory_board.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608160559/http://press.princeton.edu/about_pup/european_advisory_board.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-06-08 |title=European Advisory Board |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=2011-07-07 |accessdate=2013-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Author==
As an author, his best known and most influential works are ''The State We're In'' (an economic and political look at Britain in the 1990s from a [[Social Democrat|social democratic]] point of view) and ''The World We're In'', in which he expanded his focus to include the relationship between the United States and Europe, emphasising cultural and social differences between the two blocs and analysing the UK as sitting between the two.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxonianreview.org/wp/picking-teams-america-europe-and-the-world-were-in/ 'Picking Teams'], review of ''The World We're In'' in the ''[[Oxonian Review]]''. Published 15 June 2003; Retrieved 10 Jan 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hutton's book ''The Writing on the Wall'' was released in the UK in January 2007. The book examines Western concerns and responses to the rise of China and the emerging global division of labour, and argues that the Chinese economy is running up against a set of increasingly unsustainable contradictions that could have a damaging universal fallout. On 18 February 2007, Hutton was a featured guest in BBC's ''Have Your Say'' programme discussing the implications of China's growth. The analysis in his books is characterised by a support for the [[European Union]] and its potential, alongside a disdain for what he calls [[American conservatism]]&amp;nbsp;– defined, among other factors, as a certain attitude to markets, [[property]] and the [[social contract]]. In 1992, he won the [[What The Papers Say]] award for Political Journalist of the Year. In 2003 he was made an honorary Doctor of Laws (LLD) by the [[University of Bristol]].

His latest book, ''Them and Us: Changing Britain – Why We Need a Fair Society'', was published by [[Little, Brown]].

==Personal life==
Hutton married Jane Atkinson, the daughter of a neurosurgeon, in 1978, and lives in London. They have two daughters and a son. His wife was a director of a [[Real estate development|property development]] company called First Premise based in [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames|Richmond upon Thames]], which she founded in 1987. Jane was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in December 2013, and died in February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/10/jane-atkinson-obituary.&lt;/ref&gt; Hutton calls himself an agnostic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/19/religion-secularism-atheism-hutton-dawkins "What is the proper place for religion in Britain's public life?,"] a discussion with [[Richard Dawkins]], ''The Guardian'' (19 February 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Young Earth creationism''' ('''YEC''') is a form of [[creationism]], a [[religious belief]],&lt;ref name=Scott2004&gt;{{Cite journal |year=2004 |author=[[Eugenie Scott|Scott, Eugenie Carol]] (with foreword by Niles Eldredge) |title=Evolution vs. Creationism: an Introduction |place=Berkeley &amp; Los Angeles, California |publisher=University of California Press |page=xii |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=03b_a0monNYC&amp;pg=PR12#v=snippet&amp;q=%22religious%20belief%22&amp;f=false |isbn=0-520-24650-0 |accessdate=3 June 2014 |ref=harv |quote=Creationism is about maintaining particular, narrow forms of religious belief –  beliefs that seem to their adherents to be threatened by the very idea of evolution.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which holds that the universe, Earth, and all life on Earth were created by direct acts of [[God]] less than 10,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|2006|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its primary adherents are [[Christian]]s who subscribe to a [[Literal interpretation of the Bible|literal interpretation]] of the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation narrative]] in the Bible's [[Book of Genesis]] and believe that God created the Earth in six 24-hour days.&lt;ref name="Griffiths"&gt;{{cite journal|title= Creation days and Orthodox Jewish tradition|last= James-Griffiths|first= P|journal= Creation|volume= 26|issue= 2|pages= 53–55|url= http://creation.com/creation-days-and-orthodox-jewish-tradition |accessdate= 3 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|2006|pp=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to YEC, [[old Earth creationism]] (OEC) is the belief in a metaphorical interpretation of the Book of Genesis and the scientifically determined estimated ages of the Earth and universe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncseweb.org/creationism/general/creationevolution-continuum ''The Creation/Evolution Continuum''], [[Eugenie Scott]], [[National Center for Science Education|NCSE]] Reports, v. 19, n. 4, p. 16-17, 23-25, July/August, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the mid-20th century, young Earth creationists—starting with [[Henry M. Morris|Henry Morris]] (1918–2006)—have devised and promoted a [[pseudoscientific]] explanation called "[[creation science]]" as a basis for a religious belief in a supernatural, geologically recent creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncse.com/cej/6/2/scientific-creationism-as-pseudoscience|title="Scientific" Creationism as a Pseudoscience - NCSE|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary YEC movements arose in protest to the [[scientific consensus]], established by numerous scientific disciplines, which demonstrates that the [[age of the universe]] is around 13.8 billion years, the [[history of the Earth|formation of the Earth]] happened around 4.5 billion years ago, and the [[earliest known life forms|first appearance of life on Earth]] was at least 3.5 billion years ago.&lt;ref name="Trollinger"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trollinger|first1=Susan L.|last2=Trollinger, Jr.|first2=William Vance|editor1-last=Gutjahr|editor1-first=Paul|title=The Oxford Handbook of the Bible in America|date=2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780190258856|pages=217ff|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=23o7DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA223|language=en|chapter=Chapter 31:The Bible and Creationism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IAPStatement" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McLean" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Planck Collaboration|date=2015|title=Planck 2015 results.

A 2017 [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] creationism survey found 38 percent of adults in the United States held the view that "God created humans in their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years" when asked for their views on the origin and development of human beings, which Gallup noted was the lowest level in 35 years.&lt;ref name=Gallup2017/&gt; This level of support could be even lower when poll results are adjusted after comparison with other polls with questions that more specifically account for uncertainty and ambivalence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Branch |first1=Glenn |authorlink1=Glenn Branch |title=Understanding Gallup's Latest Poll on Evolution |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Biblical dates for creation===
The first major comprehensive draft of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] was composed by the [[Yahwist]] in the late 7th or the 6th century BC, during the [[Babylonian captivity]], with later additions made by the [[priestly source]] in the post-exilic period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gnuse |first=Robert |title=The Elohist: A 7th-Century bce Theological Tradition |journal=[[Biblical Theology Bulletin]]|volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=59–69 |publisher=Sage |url=http://btb.sagepub.com/content/42/2/59.short |doi=10.1177/0146107912441303 |accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young Earth creationists have claimed that their view has its earliest roots in ancient Judaism, citing, for example, the commentary on [[Genesis (Hebrew Bible)|Genesis]] by [[Abraham ibn Ezra|Ibn Ezra]] (c. 1089–1164).&lt;ref name="Griffiths"/&gt; Shai Cherry of [[Vanderbilt University]] notes that modern Jewish theologians have generally rejected such [[Biblical literalism|literal interpretations]] of the written text, and that even Jewish commentators who oppose some aspects of science generally accept scientific evidence that the Earth is much older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cherry, S |chapter=Crisis management via Biblical Interpretation: Fundamentalism, Modern Orthodoxy, and Genesis |title=Jewish Tradition and the Challenge of Darwinism |editor1-last=Cantor |editor1-first=Geoffrey |editor1-link=Geoffrey Cantor |editor2-last=Swetlitz |editor2-first=Marc |publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-226-09277-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calculations based on the [[Septuagint]] have traditionally [[Dating Creation|dated creation]] to around 5500 BC, while the [[Samaritan Torah]] produces a date around 4300 BC, and the [[Masoretic]] a date around 4000 BC.&lt;ref name="William Hales 1830, pp. 210-215"&gt;William Hales ''New Analysis of Chronology and Geography, History and Prophecy'', vol. 1, 1830, pp. 210–215&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the earliest Christians who followed the Septuagint calculated the date of creation to be around 5500 BC, and Christians up to the Middle Ages continued to use this rough estimate: [[Clement of Alexandria]] (5592 BC), [[Sextus Julius Africanus]] (5501 BC), [[Eusebius]] (5228 BC), [[Jerome]] (5199 BC) [[Hippolytus of Rome]] (5500 BC), [[Theophilus of Antioch]] (5529 BC), [[Sulpicius Severus]] (5469 BC), [[Isidore of Seville]] (5336 BC), [[Panodorus of Alexandria]] (5493 BC), [[Maximus the Confessor]] (5493 BC), [[George Syncellus]] (5492 BC) and [[Gregory of Tours]] (5500 BC).&lt;ref&gt;''A Collation of the Sacred Scriptures'', Charles Roger Dundee, 1847, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Old Testament 2005 p. 26"&gt;''Chronology of the Old Testament'', Floyd Nolen Jones, Master Books, 15th edition (April 2005), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Byzantine calendar]] has traditionally dated the creation of the world to 1 September 5509 BC, [[María de Ágreda]] and her followers to 5199 BC, while the early [[Ethiopian Church]] (as revealed in the ''[[Book of Aksum]]'') to 5493 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orthodoxwiki.org/Byzantine_Creation_Era |title=Byzantine Creation Era |publisher=OrthodoxWiki |accessdate=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ldolphin.org/barrychron.html |title=Creation And Catastrophe Chronology |publisher=Ldolphin.org |accessdate=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bede]] was one of the first to break away from the standard Septuagint date for the creation and in his work ''De Temporibus'' ("On Time") (completed in 703 AD) dated the creation to 18 March 3952 BC but was accused of heresy at the table of [[Wilfrid|Bishop Wilfrid]], because his chronology was contrary to accepted calculations of around 5500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;''The Reckoning of Time'', Wallis, Faith, trans, pp. xxx, 405–415.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Masoretic text was published, dating creation around 4000 BC became common, and was received with wide support.&lt;ref&gt;''A Collation of the Sacred Scriptures'', Charles Roger Dundee, 1847, pp. 10–24.&lt;/ref&gt; Proposed calculations of the date of creation, using the Masoretic from the 10th century – 18th century include: [[Marianus Scotus]] (4192 BC), [[Maimonides]] (4058 BC), [[Henri Spondanus]] (4051 BC), [[Benedict Pereira]] (4021 BC), [[Louis Cappel]] (4005 BC), [[James Ussher]] (4004 BC), [[Augustin Calmet]] (4002 BC), [[Isaac Newton]] (4000 BC), [[Johannes Kepler]] (27 April, 3977 BC) [based on his book ''Mysterium''], [[Petavius]] (3984 BC), [[Theodore Bibliander]] (3980 BC), [[Christen Sørensen Longomontanus]] (3966 BC), [[Melanchthon]] (3964 BC), [[Martin Luther]] (3961 BC), [[John Lightfoot]] (3960 BC), [[Cornelius Cornelii a Lapide]] (3951 BC) [[Joseph Justus Scaliger]] (3949 BC), [[Christoph Helvig]] (3947 BC), [[Gerardus Mercator]] (3928 BC), [[Matthieu Brouard]] (3927 BC), [[Benito Arias Montano]] (3849 BC), [[Andreas Helwig]] (3836 BC), [[David Gans]] (3761 BC) and [[Gershom ben Judah]] (3754 BC).&lt;ref name="William Hales 1830, pp. 210-215"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Old Testament 2005 p. 26"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friesian.com/calendar.htm |title=Babylonian, Jewish, Muslim, Luni-Solar, Indian, Iranian Calendars |publisher=Friesian.com |accessdate=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="skeptically.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skeptically.org/oldtestament/id15.html |title=The Biblical Date for Creation |publisher=Skeptically.org |accessdate=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="skeptically.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Creation|volume=unknown|issue=unknown|last=Batten |first=Don |url=http://creation.com/old-earth-or-young-earth-belief |title=Old-earth or young-earth belief |publisher=Creation.com |accessdate=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the Masoretic creation estimates or calculations for the date of creation Ussher's specific [[Ussher chronology|chronology]] dating the creation to 4004 BC became the most accepted and popular, mainly because this specific date was attached to the [[King James Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/scopes/ussher.html |title=Bishop James Ussher Sets the Date for Creation: 23 October 4004 B.C. |publisher=Law2.umkc.edu |accessdate=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The youngest ever recorded date of creation within the historic Jewish or Christian traditions is 3616 BC, by [[Yom-Tov Lipmann Heller]] in the 17th century&lt;ref&gt;William Hales ''New Analysis of Chronology and Geography, History and Prophecy'', vol. 1, 1830, pp. 210–215.&lt;/ref&gt; while the oldest proposed date was 6984 BC by [[Alfonso X of Castile]].&lt;ref name=Young&gt;''Young's Analytical Concordance of the Holy Bible'', 1879, 8th Edition, 1939—entry under 'Creation', quoting William Hales ''New Analysis of Chronology and Geography, History and Prophecy'', Vol. 1, 1830, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; However some contemporary or more recent proponents of Young Earth Creationism have taken this figure back further by several thousands of years by proposing significant gaps in the genealogies in chapters 5 and 11 of the Book of Genesis. [[Harold Camping]] for example dated the creation to 11,013 BC, while [[Christian Charles Josias Bunsen]] in the 19th century dated the creation to 20,000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;''Epoch of Creation according to various authorities'' in ''Pre-Adamites'' by Walter Winchell, 1880&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of prominent early [[Church Fathers]] and Christian writers, including [[Origen]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], did not believe that the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation myth in Genesis]] depicted ordinary solar days and read [[Allegorical interpretations of Genesis|creation history as an allegory]] as well as being theologically true.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Several early Jews also followed an allegorical interpretation of Genesis, including most notably [[Philo]] (''On the Creation'', III.13).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/text/philo/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529141839/http://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/text/philo/ |archivedate=29 May 2008 |title=Philo's writings |accessdate=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Protestant reformation]] [[hermeneutic]] inclined some of the Reformers, including [[John Calvin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Genesis|last=Calvin|first=John|authorlink=John Calvin|year=1554|url=http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/ipb-e/epl-01/cvgn1-04.txt|quote=I have said above, that six days were employed in the formation of the world; not that God, to whom one moment is as a thousand years, had need of this succession of time, but that he might engage us in the consideration of his works.|isbn=0-8204-3992-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Institutes of the Christian Religion|first=John|last=Calvin|authorlink=John Calvin|url=http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/ipb-e/epl-01/cvgn1-04.txt|accessdate=17 December 2010|quote=Nor will they abstain from their jeers when told that little more than five thousand years have elapsed since the creation of the world.|isbn=0-87552-182-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Martin Luther]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Luther's Works vol. 1: Lectures on Genesis Chapters 1–5|last=Luther|first=Martin|authorlink=Martin Luther|editor=[[Jaroslav Pelikan]]|year=1958|publisher=Fortress Press|quote=...the Decalog(Ex. 20:11) and the entire Scripture bear witness that in six days God made heaven and earth and everything in them. (pg. 6)"; "We know from Moses that the world was not in existence before 6,000 years ago. (pg. 3)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later Protestants toward a literal reading of the Bible as translated, believing in an ordinary day, and maintaining this younger-Earth view.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Young|Stearley|2008|pp=44–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Earth that was thousands of years old remained the dominant view during the [[Early Modern Period]] (1500–1800) and is found typically referenced in the works of famous poets and playwrights of the era, including [[William Shakespeare]]:

{{quote|...The poor world is almost 6,000 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare's (1599) line given to Rosalind addressing Orlando in ''As you like it'' (IV, 1:90).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Scientific revolution and the old Earth===
Support for an Earth that was created thousands of years ago declined among the scientists and philosophers from the 18th century onwards with the development of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the [[scientific revolution]], and new scientific discoveries. In particular, discoveries in [[geology]] required an Earth that was much older than thousands of years, and proposals such as [[Abraham Gottlob Werner]]'s [[Neptunism]] attempted to incorporate what was understood from geological investigations into a coherent description of Earth's natural history. [[James Hutton]], now regarded as the father of modern geology, went further and opened up the concept of [[deep time]] for scientific inquiry. Rather than accepting that the Earth was deteriorating from a primal state, he maintained that the Earth was infinitely old. Hutton stated that:

{{Quotation|the past history of our globe must be explained by what can be seen to be happening now … No powers are to be employed that are not natural to the globe, no action to be admitted except those of which we know the principle.&lt;ref&gt;'Theory of the Earth', a paper (with the same title of his 1795 book) communicated to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and published in ''Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh'', 1785; cited with approval in [[Arthur Holmes]], ''Principles of Physical Geology'', second edition, Thomas Nelson and Sons Ltd., Great Britain, pp. 43–44, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hutton's main line of argument was that the tremendous displacements and changes he was seeing did not happen in a short period of time by means of catastrophe, but that the incremental processes of uplift and erosion happening on the Earth in the present day had caused them. As these processes were very gradual, the Earth needed to be ancient, in order to allow time for the changes to occur. While his ideas of [[Plutonism]] were hotly contested, scientific inquiries on competing ideas of [[catastrophism]] pushed back the age of the Earth into the millions of years – still much younger than commonly accepted by modern scientists, but a great change from the literalist view of an Earth that was only a few thousand years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uwmc.uwc.edu/geography/hutton/hutton.htm |author=[[James Hutton]] |title=''Theory of the Earth'' (1788 version) |accessdate=12 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030729055405/http://www.uwmc.uwc.edu/geography/Hutton/Hutton.htm |archivedate=29 July 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hutton's ideas, called [[uniformitarianism]] or [[gradualism]], were popularized by [[Charles Lyell|Sir Charles Lyell]] in the early 19th century. The energetic advocacy and rhetoric of Lyell led to the public and scientific communities largely accepting an ancient Earth. By this time, the Reverends [[William Buckland]], [[Adam Sedgwick]] and other early geologists had abandoned their earlier ideas of catastrophism related to a biblical flood and confined their explanations to local floods. By the 1830s, mainstream science had abandoned a young Earth as a serious hypothesis.

John H. Mears was one such scholar who proposed several theories varying from a mix of long/indefinite periods with moments of creation to a day-age theory of indefinite 'days'. He subscribed to the latter theory (indefinite days) and found support from the side of Yale professor [[James Dwight Dana]], one of the fathers of [[Mineralogy]], who wrote a paper consisting of four articles named 'Science and the Bible' on the topic.&lt;ref name="Dana"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dana |first=James Dwight |title=Science and the Bible, a review of and the six days of creation of Prof. Lewis Taylor |publisher=Bibl. Soc. |year=1856–1857 |url=http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/dana-science-bible/page_001}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the acceptance by many biblical scholars of a reinterpretation of Genesis 1 in the light of the breakthrough results of Lyell, and supported by a number of renowned (Christian) scientific scholars, a new hurdle was taken in the future acceptance of Developmentalism (based on Darwin's Natural selection).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bible.org/page.php?page_id=2054#P52_10723 |title=Bible.org, Darwinism and New England Theology |year=2004 |accessdate=8 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decline of support for a biblically literal young Earth during the 19th century was opposed by first the [[scriptural geologist]]s&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Great Devonian Controversy]]'', [[Martin J. S. Rudwick]], 1988, {{ISBN|0-226-73102-2}}, pp 42–44&lt;/ref&gt; and then by the founders of the [[Victoria Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McNatt|first=Jerrold L.|title=James Clerk Maxwell's Refusal to Join the Victoria Institute|journal=[[Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith]]|volume=56|issue=3|pages=204–215|publisher=[[American Scientific Affiliation]]|date=September 2004|url=http://www.asa3.org/asa/pscf/2004/PSCF9-04McNatt.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian fundamentalism and belief in a young Earth===
The rise of [[fundamentalist Christianity]] at the start of the 20th century saw a renewed interest in proposals that the Earth was thousands of years old, as a part of the movement's [[creation-evolution controversy|rejection of evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|2006|pp=51–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923, [[George McCready Price]], a [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]], wrote ''The New Geology'', a book partly inspired by the book ''Patriarchs and Prophets'' in which Seventh-day Adventist prophet [[Ellen G. White]] described the impact of the [[Genesis flood narrative|Great Flood]] on the shape of the Earth. Although not an accredited geologist, Price's writings, which were based on reading geological texts and documents rather than field or laboratory work,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|2006|pp=88–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide an explicitly fundamentalist perspective on geology. The book attracted a small following, with its advocates almost all being Lutheran pastors and Seventh-day Adventists in America.&lt;ref name="rsf"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marston, P  |author2=Forster, R |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2001|title=Reason Science and Faith|publisher=Monarch Books|isbn=978-1-57910-661-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harry Rimmer]] was another prominent exponent of similar views, at least during some of his evangelizing career (Rimmer appears to have also subscribed to "[[gap creationism]]", and a local flood, at least at some times).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|2006|pp=76–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, Price's work came under severe criticism, particularly by [[Bernard Ramm]] in his book ''The Christian View of Science and Scripture''. Together with [[J. Laurence Kulp]], a geologist and in fellowship with the [[Plymouth Brethren]], and other scientists,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1993/PSCF12-93Yang.html Radiocarbon Dating and American Evangelical Christians]. Asa3.org. Retrieved 20 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Ramm influenced Christian organizations such as the [[American Scientific Affiliation]] (ASA) in not supporting [[flood geology]].

Price's work was subsequently adapted and updated by [[Henry M. Morris]] and [[John C. Whitcomb|John C. Whitcomb Jr.]] in their book ''[[The Genesis Flood]]'' in 1961. Morris and Whitcomb argued that the Earth was geologically recent and that the Great Flood had laid down most of the geological strata in the space of a single year, reviving pre-uniformitarian arguments. Given this history, they argued, "the last refuge of the case for evolution immediately vanishes away, and the record of the rocks becomes a tremendous witness... to the holiness and justice and power of the living God of Creation!"&lt;ref&gt;Whitcomb, JC (1960). The Genesis Flood: The Biblical Record and Its Scientific Implications. P&amp;R Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0-87552-338-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This became the foundation of a new generation of young Earth creationist believers, who organized themselves around Morris' [[Institute for Creation Research]]. Sister organizations such as the [[Creation Research Society]] have sought to re-interpret geological formations within a Young Earth Creationist viewpoint. [[Langdon Brown Gilkey|Langdon Gilkey]] writes:

{{quotation|...&amp;nbsp;no distinction is made between scientific theories on the one hand and philosophical or religious theories on the other, between scientific questions and the sorts of questions religious beliefs seek to answer... It is, therefore, no surprise that in their theological works, as opposed to their creation science writings, creationists regard evolution and all other theories associated with it, as the intellectual source for and intellectual justification of everything that is to them evil and destructive in modern society. For them all that is spiritually healthy and creative has been for a century or more under attack by "that most complex of godless movements spawned by the pervasive and powerful system of evolutionary uniformitarianism", "If the system of flood geology can be established on a sound scientific basis... then the entire evolutionary cosmology, at least in its present neo-Darwinian form, will collapse. This in turn would mean that every anti-Christian system and movement (communism, racism, [[humanism]], [[libertarianism]], [[behaviorism]], and all the rest) would be deprived of their pseudo-intellectual foundation", "It [evolution] has served effectively as the pseudo-scientific basis of [[atheism]], agnosticism, socialism, fascism, and numerous faulty and dangerous philosophies over the past century.&lt;ref&gt;(Gilkey, 1998, p. 35; quotations from Henry Morris).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Impact===
Young Earth creationism directly contradicts the [[scientific consensus]] of the [[scientific community]]. A 2006 joint statement of [[InterAcademy Panel on International Issues]] (IAP) by 68 national and international science academies enumerated the scientific facts that young Earth creationism contradicts, in particular that the universe, the Earth, and life are billions of years old, that each has undergone continual change over those billions of years, and that life on Earth has evolved from a [[common ancestor|common primordial origin]] into the diverse forms observed in the fossil record and present today.&lt;ref name="IAPStatement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interacademies.net/10878/13901.aspx|title=IAP Statement on the teaching of evolution|year=2006|publisher=the Interacademy Panel on international issues|accessdate=23 December 2010|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary theory remains the only explanation that fully accounts for all the observations, measurements, data, and evidence discovered in the fields of [[biology]], [[ecology]], [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[zoology]], [[paleontology]], [[molecular biology]], [[genetics]], [[anthropology]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=PZ |last=Myers |authorlink=PZ Myers |title=Ann Coulter: No evidence for evolution? |date=18 June 2006 |publisher=scienceblogs.com |url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/06/18/ann-coulter-no-evidence-for-ev/ |work=Pharyngula |pages=|accessdate=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[National Science Teachers Association]]'s [http://www.nsta.org/159&amp;psid=10 position statement on the teaching of evolution.]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030419055650/http://www.nsta.org/159%26psid%3D10 |date=19 April 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interacademies.net/10878/13901.aspx IAP Statement on the Teaching of Evolution] Joint statement issued by the national science academies of 67 countries, including the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Royal Society]] (PDF file)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AAAS Denounces Anti-Evolution Laws"&gt;From the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], the world's largest general scientific society: [http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2006/pdf/0219boardstatement.pdf 2006 Statement on the Teaching of Evolution] (PDF file), [http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2006/0219boardstatement.shtml AAAS Denounces Anti-Evolution Laws]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=factfancy&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2743476|title=Fact, Fancy, and Myth on Human Evolution|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As such, young Earth creationism is dismissed by the academic and the scientific communities. One 1987 estimate found that "700 scientists ... (out of a total of 480,000 U.S. earth and life scientists) ... give credence to creation-science".&lt;ref name="Newsweek_1987_Martz_McDaniel"&gt;As reported by Newsweek: "By one count there are some 700 scientists with respectable academic credentials (out of a total of 480,000 U.S. earth and life scientists) who give credence to creation-science, the general theory that complex life forms did not evolve but appeared 'abruptly'."{{Harvnb|Martz &amp; McDaniel|1987|Ref=CITEREFMartzMcDaniel1987|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; An expert in the evolution-creationism controversy, professor and author [[Brian Alters]], states that "99.9 percent of scientists accept evolution".&lt;ref name=nihrecord&gt;[http://nihrecord.od.nih.gov/newsletters/2006/07_28_2006/story03.htm ''Finding the Evolution in Medicine''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122022815/http://nihrecord.od.nih.gov/newsletters/2006/07_28_2006/story03.htm |date=22 November 2008 }}, Cynthia Delgado, NIH Record, 28 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1991 Gallup poll found that about 5 per cent of American scientists (including those with training outside biology) identified themselves as creationists.&lt;ref name=robinson&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/ev_publi.htm|title=Beliefs of the U.S. public about evolution and creation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncse.com/rncse/17/6/many-scientists-see-gods-hand-evolution|title=Many Scientists See God's Hand in Evolution - NCSE|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For their part, Young Earth Creationists say that the lack of support for their beliefs by the scientific community is due to discrimination and censorship by professional science journals and professional science organizations. This viewpoint was explicitly rejected in the rulings from the 1981 United States District Court case ''[[McLean v. Arkansas Board of Education]]'' as no witness was able to produce any articles that had been refused publication and the judge could not conceive how "a loose knit group of independent thinkers in all the varied fields of science could, or would, so effectively censor new scientific thought".&lt;ref name="McLean"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/mclean-v-arkansas.html |title=McLean v.

Morris' ideas had a considerable impact on creationism and fundamentalist Christianity. Armed with the backing of conservative organizations and individuals, his brand of "creation science" was widely promoted throughout the United States and overseas, with his books being translated into at least ten different languages. The inauguration of so-called "Young Earth Creationism" as a religious position has, on occasion, impacted [[Creation and evolution in public education|science education in the United States]], where periodic controversies have raged over the appropriateness of teaching YEC doctrine and creation science in [[state school|public schools]] (see [[Teach the Controversy]]) alongside or in replacement of the theory of evolution. Young Earth creationism has not had as large an impact in the less literalist circles of Christianity. Some churches, such as the Roman Catholic Church and the [[Orthodox Christianity|Eastern Orthodox churches]], accede to the possibility of [[theistic evolution]]; though individual church members support young Earth creationism and do so without those churches' explicit condemnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicintl.com/scienceissues/dialogue-evolution1.htm|title=Dialogue on Evolution versus Creationism|accessdate=10 October 2007|author=Philip Porvaznik|publisher=Catholic Apologetics International}}{{dead link|date=August 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adherence to Young Earth Creationism and rejection of evolution is higher in the U.S. than in most of the rest of the [[Western world]].&lt;ref name="Michael Le Page 31"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeff Hecht 11"/&gt; A 2012 Gallup survey reported that 46 per cent of Americans believed in the creationist view that God created humans in their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years, a statistic which has remained essentially the same since 1982; for those with a postgraduate education, only 25 per cent believed in the creationist viewpoint. About one third of Americans believed that [[theistic evolution|humans evolved with God's guidance]] and 15 per cent said [[human evolution|humans evolved]], but that God had no part in the process.&lt;ref name="newport"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/155003/Hold-Creationist-View-Human-Origins.aspx |title=In U.S., 46% Hold Creationist View of Human Origins |last=Newport |first=Frank |publisher=[[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] |date=1 June 2012 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2009 poll by [[Harris Insights &amp; Analytics|Harris Interactive]] found that 39 per cent of Americans agreed with the statement that "God created the universe, the earth, the sun, moon, stars, plants, animals, and the first two people within the past 10,000 years", yet only 18 per cent of the Americans polled agreed with the statement "The earth is less than 10,000 years old".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncse.com/rncse/30/3/americans-scientific-knowledge-beliefs-human-evolution-year-|title=Americans' Scientific Knowledge and Beliefs about Human Evolution in the Year of Darwin|first1=George F|last1=Bishop|first2=Randall|last2=Thomas|first3=Jason A |last3=Wood|first4=Misook|last4=Gwon|work=National Center for Science Education|year=2010|accessdate=September 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2017 [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] creationism survey found that 38 per cent of adults in the United States inclined to the view that "God created humans in their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years" when asked for their views on the origin and development of human beings, which Gallup noted was the lowest level in 35 years.&lt;ref name=Gallup2017&gt;{{cite news|title=In US, Belief in Creationist View of Humans at New Low|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/210956/belief-creationist-view-humans-new-low.aspx|work=Gallup|date=May 22, 2017|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reasons for the higher rejection of evolution in the U.S. include the abundance of fundamentalist Christians compared to Europe.&lt;ref name="Jeff Hecht 11"/&gt; A 2011 [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] survey reported that 30 per cent of Americans said the Bible is the actual word of God and should be interpreted literally, a statistic which had fallen slightly from the late 1970s.

==Characteristics and beliefs==
The common belief of Young Earth Creationists is that the Earth and life were created in six 24-hour periods,&lt;ref name=Carleton /&gt; 6,000-10,000 years ago. However, there are different approaches to how this is possible given the geological evidence for much longer timescales. The Science Education Resource Center at [[Carleton College]] has identified two major types of YEC belief systems:&lt;ref name=Carleton&gt;{{cite web|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/introgeo/earthhistory/creawhat.html|title=What Kind of Creationism?|work=Addressing Creationism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Believers in [[flood geology]] attach great importance to the biblical story of [[Noah's Flood]] in explaining the [[fossil record]] and [[geological strata]]. Major American YEC organizations such as the [[Institute for Creation Research]] and [[Answers in Genesis]] support this approach with detailed argumentation and references to scientific evidence, though often framed with pseudoscientific misconceptions.&lt;ref name=Carleton /&gt;
*A less-visible form of YEC not seen as often on the internet is one which claims that there has been essentially no development of the Universe, Earth, or life whatsoever since creation &amp;mdash; that creation has been in a steady state since the beginning without major changes. According to [[Ronald Numbers]] this belief, which does not necessarily try to explain scientific evidence through appeal to a global flood, has not been promoted as much as the former example given.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|2006|pp=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such YECs believe that fossils are not real and that major extinctions never occurred, so [[dinosaurs]], [[trilobites]], and other examples of extinct organisms found in the fossil record would have to either be hoaxes or simply secular lies, promoted perhaps by the [[devil]].&lt;ref name=Carleton /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|2006|pp=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===View of the Bible===
{{See also|Biblical literalism|Biblical literalist chronology}}
Young Earth creationists regard the Bible as a historically accurate, factually [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrant]] record of natural history.&lt;!-- Morris --&gt; As Henry Morris, a leading Young Earth Creationist, explained it, "Christians who flirt with less-than-literal readings of biblical texts are also flirting with theological disaster."&lt;ref name="Morris Conflict"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wcNY44euja0C&amp;pg=PT25#v=onepage&amp;q=origin%20of%20the%20earth&amp;f=false |chapter=The Origin and History of the Earth |title=The Long War Against God: The History and Impact of the Creation/Evolution Conflict|author=Morris, HM|year=2000|publisher=Master Books|isbn=978-0-89051-291-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Morris, HM|title=Biblical Creationism: What Each Book of the Bible Teaches About Creation &amp; the Flood|year=2000|publisher=Master Books|isbn=978-0-89051-293-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Morris, Christians must "either ... believe God's Word all the way, or not at all."&lt;ref name="Morris Conflict"/&gt; Young Earth creationists consider the account of creation given in Genesis to be a factual record of the origin of the Earth and life, and that Bible-believing Christians must therefore regard [[Book of Genesis#Summary|Genesis 1–11]] as historically accurate.

====Interpretations of Genesis====
{{See also|Genesis creation narrative}}
Young Earth creationists interpret the text of Genesis as strictly literal. Young Earth Creationists reject [[Allegorical interpretations of Genesis|allegorical readings]] of Genesis and further argue that if there was not a literal [[Fall of Man]], [[Noah's Ark]], or [[Tower of Babel]] this would undermine core Christian doctrines like the birth and resurrection of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]].

The genealogies of Genesis record the line of descent from Adam through Noah to Abraham. Young Earth Creationists interpret these genealogies literally, including the old ages of the men. For example, [[Methuselah]] lived 969 years according to the genealogy. Differences of opinion exist regarding whether the genealogies should be taken as complete or abbreviated, hence the 6,000 to 10,000 year range usually quoted for the Earth's age. In contrast, [[Old Earth Creationists]] tend to interpret the genealogies as incomplete, and usually interpret the days of Genesis 1 figuratively as long periods of time.

Young Earth creationists believe that the flood described in Genesis 6–9 did occur, was global in extent, and submerged all dry land on Earth. Some Young Earth Creationists go further and advocate a kind of [[flood geology]] which relies on the appropriation of late eighteenth and early nineteenth century arguments in favor of [[catastrophism]] made by such scientists as [[Georges Cuvier]] and [[Richard Kirwan]]. This approach which was replaced by the mid-nineteenth century almost entirely by [[uniformitarianism]] was adopted most famously by [[George McCready Price]] and this legacy is reflected in the most prominent YEC organizations today. YEC ideas to accommodate the massive amount of water necessary for a flood that was global in scale included inventing such constructs as an orbiting [[vapor canopy]] which would have collapsed and generated the necessary extreme rainfall or a [[Walt Brown (creationist)|rapid movement of tectonic plates]] causing underground aquifers&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Catastrophic plate tectonics: the geophysical context of the Genesis Flood|author=John Baumgardner|url=http://creation.com/catastrophic-plate-tectonics-the-geophysical-context-of-the-genesis-flood|journal=Journal of creation|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; or tsunamis from underwater volcanic steam&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Noah's Flood - Where did the water come from?|author=Answers In Genesis|url=http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/tools/flood-waters.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; to inundate the planet.

===Age of the Earth===
{{See also|Age of the Earth|Dating creation|Flood geology|RATE project}}
The young Earth creationist belief that the age of the Earth is 6,000 to 10,000 years old conflicts with the [[Age of the Earth|age of 4.54 billion years]] measured using independently cross-validated [[geochronology|geochronological]] methods including [[radiometric dating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CD/CD010.html |title=Claim CD010: Radiometric dating gives unreliable results |publisher=[[TalkOrigins Archive]] |date=18 February 2001 |accessdate=28 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Creationists dispute these and all other methods which demonstrate the timescale of [[Geological history of Earth|geologic history]] in spite of the lack of [[scientific evidence]] that there are any inconsistencies or errors in the measurement of the Earth's age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CF/CF210.html |title=Claim CF210: Constancy of Radioactive Decay Rates |date=4 June 2003 |accessdate=28 September 2010 |publisher=TalkOrigins }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ocrwm.doe.gov/factsheets/doeymp0010.shtml |title=Oklo: Natural Nuclear Reactors |date=November 2004 |accessdate=28 September 2010 |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091114215053/http://www.ocrwm.doe.gov/factsheets/doeymp0010.shtml |archivedate=14 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1997 and 2005, a team of scientists at the [[Institute for Creation Research]] conducted an eight-year research project entitled [[RATE project|RATE]] (Radioisotopes and the Age of The Earth) to assess the validity and accuracy of radiometric dating techniques. While they concluded that there was overwhelming evidence for over 500 million years' worth of radioactive decay, they claimed to have found other scientific evidence to prove a young earth. They therefore proposed that nuclear decay rates were accelerated by a factor of one billion during the Creation week and at the time of the Flood. However, when subjected to independent scrutiny by non-affiliated experts, their analyses were shown to be flawed.&lt;ref&gt;

===Human history===

==={{anchor|Dinosaurs}}Flood geology, the fossil record, and dinosaurs===
{{See also|Paleontology|Dinosaur}}
Young Earth creationists reject the geologic evidence that the [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic sequence]] of [[fossil]]s proves the Earth is billions of years old. In his ''Illogical Geology'', expanded in 1913 as ''The Fundamentals of Geology'', George McCready Price argued that the occasionally out-of-order sequence of fossils that are shown to be due to [[thrust fault]]s made it impossible to prove any one fossil was older than any other. His "law" that fossils could be found in any order implied that strata could not be dated sequentially. He instead proposed that essentially all fossils were buried during the flood and thus inaugurated [[flood geology]]. In numerous books and articles he promoted this concept, focusing his attack on the sequence of the [[geologic time scale]] as "the devil's counterfeit of the six days of Creation as recorded in the first chapter of Genesis."&lt;ref&gt;Numbers (2006) pages=79–81&lt;/ref&gt; Today, many young Earth creationists still contend that the fossil record can be explained by the global flood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nas.edu/evolution/CreationistPerspective.html|title=Evolution Resources from the National Academies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Genesis Flood]]'' (1961) [[Henry M. Morris]] reiterated Price's arguments, and wrote that because there had been no death before the Fall of Man, he felt "compelled to date all the rock strata which contain fossils of once-living creatures as subsequent to Adam's fall", attributing most to the flood. He added that humans and [[dinosaur]]s had lived together, quoting Clifford L. Burdick for the report that dinosaur tracks had supposedly been found overlapping a human track in the [[Paluxy River]] bed [[Dinosaur Valley State Park|Glen Rose Formation]]. He was subsequently advised that he might have been misled, and Burdick wrote to Morris in September 1962 that "you kind of stuck your neck out in publishing those Glen Rose tracks." In the third printing of the book this section was removed.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers (2006) pages=202–203&lt;/ref&gt;

Following in this vein, many young Earth creationists, especially those associated with the more visible organizations, do not deny the existence of dinosaurs and other extinct animals present in the [[fossil record]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/24/AR2005092401262.html|title=In Evolution Debate, Creationists Are Breaking New Ground|work=The Washington Post |first=Michael |last=Powell |date=25 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, they claim that the fossils represent the remains of animals that perished in the flood.

As the term "dinosaur" was coined by [[Richard Owen]] in 1842, the Bible does not use the word "dinosaur". Some creationist organizations propose that the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word ''tanniyn'' (תנין, {{IPA-he|tanˈnin|pron}}), mentioned nearly thirty times in the [[Old Testament]], should be considered a synonym.&lt;ref name="clarifying"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarifyingchristianity.com/dinos.shtml|title=Dinosaurs and the Bible|publisher=Clarifying Christianity'|year=2005|accessdate=14 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In English translations, ''tanniyn'' has been translated as "sea monster" or "serpent", but most often it is translated as "dragon". Additionally, in the [[Book of Job]], a "[[behemoth]]" ({{bibleverse||Job|40:15–24|9}}) is described as a creature that "moves his tail like a cedar"; the behemoth is described as ranking "first among the works of God" and as impossible to capture (vs. 24). Biblical scholars have alternatively identified the behemoth as either an elephant, a [[hippopotamus]], or a bull,&lt;ref name="BOTF"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bright, Michael|title=Beasts of the Field: The Revealing Natural History of Animals in the Bible|year=2006|pages=26–27|isbn=1-86105-831-4|publisher=Robson|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CH/CH711.html|title=CH711: Behemoth a Dinosaur|accessdate=13 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-262-66165-9"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pennock, Robert T.|title=Tower of Babel: the evidence against the new creationism|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass|year=2000|isbn=0-262-66165-9|oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some creationists have identified the behemoth with [[sauropod]] dinosaurs, often specifically the ''[[Brachiosaurus]]'' according to their interpretation of the verse "He is the chief of the ways of God" implying that the behemoth is the largest animal God created.&lt;ref name="clarifying"/&gt; The [[leviathan]] is another creature referred to in the Bible's Old Testament that some creationists argue is actually a dinosaur. Alternatively, more mainstream scholars have identified the Leviathan ({{bibleverse||Job|41|9}}) with the [[Nile crocodile]] or, because [[Ugarit]] texts describe it as having seven heads, a purely mythical beast similar to the [[Lernaean Hydra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CH/CH711_1.html|title=Claim CH711.1: Leviathan as a dinosaur|publisher=[[TalkOrigins Archive]]|accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A subset of adherents of the pseudoscience of [[cryptozoology]] promote Young Earth creationism, particularly in the context of so-called "living dinosaurs". [[Science journalism|Science writer]] [[Sharon A. Hill]] observes that the Young Earth creationist segment of cryptozoology is "well-funded and able to conduct expeditions with a goal of finding a living dinosaur that they think would invalidate evolution."&lt;ref name="SCIENTIFICAL-AMERICANS-66"&gt;Hill, Sharon A. 2017.

===Attitude towards science===
{{Main|Creation science}}
Young Earth creationism is most famous for an opposition to the [[theory of evolution]], but believers also are on record opposing many measurements, facts, and principles in the fields of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], dating methods including [[radiometric dating]], [[geology]],&lt;ref name=TO_CH210&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CH/CH210.html|title=Talk Origins Archive – Claim CH210: Age of the Earth|date=2 October 2004|accessdate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[astronomy]],&lt;ref name=TO_CH200&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CH/CH200.html|title=Talk Origins Archive – Claim CH200: Age of the Universe|date=24 February 2005|accessdate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cosmology]],&lt;ref name=TO_CH200 /&gt; and [[paleontology]].&lt;ref name=TO_CH710&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CH/CH710.html|title=Talk Origins Archive – Claim CH200: Age of the Universe|date=13 June 2003|accessdate=11 April 2011|quote=...there is an approximately sixty-four-million-year gap in the fossil record when there are neither dinosaur nor human fossils.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young Earth creationists do not accept any explanation for natural phenomena which deviates from the veracity of a [[Biblical literalism|plain reading]] of the Bible, whether it be the origins of biological diversity, the origins of life, or the origins of the universe itself. This has led some young Earth creationists to criticize other creationist proposals such as [[intelligent design]], for not taking a strong stand on the age of the Earth, special creation, or even the identity of the designer.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Young Earth creationists disagree with the [[methodological naturalism]] that is part of the [[scientific method]]. Instead, they assert the actions of God as described in the [[Bible]] occurred as written and therefore only scientific evidence that points to the Bible being correct can be accepted. See [[Creation-evolution controversy]] for a more complete discussion.

==Compared to other forms of creationism==
{{main|Creationism}}
As a position that developed out of the explicitly [[anti-intellectual]] side of the [[Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy]] in the early parts of the twentieth century, there is no single unified nor consistent consensus on how creationism as a belief system ought to reconcile its adherents' acceptance of biblical inerrancy with [[empiricism|empirical facts]] of the Universe. Although Young Earth Creationism is one of the most stridently literalist positions taken among professed creationists, there are also examples of biblical literalist adherents to both [[Geocentrist|geocentrism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|2006|p=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Flat Earth Society|a flat Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Schadewald RJ |url=http://ncse.com/cej/3/3/six-flood-arguments-creationists-cant-answer |title=Six "Flood" Arguments Creationists can't answer |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] |accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conflicts between different kinds of creationists are rather common, but three in particular are of particular relevance to YEC: [[Old Earth Creationism]], [[Gap creationism]], and the [[Omphalos hypothesis]].

===Old Earth creationism===
{{See also|Old Earth creationism}}
Young Earth creationists reject [[old Earth creationism]] and [[day-age creationism]] on textual and theological grounds. In addition, they claim that the scientific data in geology and astronomy point to a young Earth, against the consensus of the general scientific community.

Young Earth creationists generally hold that, when Genesis describes the creation of the Earth occurring over a period of days, this indicates normal-length 24 hour days, and cannot reasonably be interpreted otherwise. They agree that the Hebrew word for "day" (''yôm'') can refer to either a 24-hour day or a long or unspecified time; but argue that, whenever the latter interpretation is used, it includes a preposition defining the long or unspecified period. In the ''specific context of Genesis 1'', since the days are both numbered and are referred to as "evening and morning", this can mean only normal-length days. Further, they argue that the 24-hour day is the only interpretation that makes sense of the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] command in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 20:8–11. YECs argue that it is a glaring [[exegesis|exegetical]] [[fallacy]] to take a meaning from one context (yom referring to a long period of time in Genesis 1) and apply it to a completely different one ([[yom]] referring to normal-length days in Exodus 20).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Creation|issue=1|volume=19 |title=How long were the days of Genesis 1?|author=Russell Grigg|pages=23–25|url=http://creation.com/how-long-were-the-days-of-genesis-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hebrew scholars reject the rule that ''yôm'' with a number or an "evening and morning" construct can only refer to 24-hour days.&lt;ref&gt;

===Gap creationism===
{{See also|Gap creationism}}
The "gap theory" acknowledges a vast age for the universe, including the Earth and solar system, while asserting that life was created recently in six 24-hour days by divine fiat. Genesis 1 is thus interpreted literally, with an indefinite "gap" of time inserted between the first two verses. (Some gap theorists insert a "primordial creation" and [[Lucifer]]'s rebellion into the gap.) Young Earth Creationist organizations argue that the gap theory is unscriptural, unscientific, and not necessary, in its various forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Creation|volume=10|issue=1|pages=35–37|title=The gap theory – an idea with holes?|author=Henry M.

===Omphalos hypothesis===
{{See also|Omphalos hypothesis}}
Many young Earth creationists distinguish their own hypotheses from the "Omphalos hypothesis", today more commonly referred to as the apparent age concept, put forth by the naturalist and science writer [[Philip Henry Gosse]]. ''[[Omphalos (book)|Omphalos]]'' was an unsuccessful mid-19th century attempt to reconcile creationism with geology. Gosse proposed that just as Adam had a [[navel]] (''omphalos'' is Greek for navel), evidence of a [[gestation]] he never experienced, so also the Earth was created ''[[ex nihilo]]'' complete with evidence of a prehistoric past that never actually occurred. The Omphalos hypothesis allows for a young Earth without giving rise to any predictions that would contradict scientific findings of an old Earth. Although both logically unassailable and consistent with a literal reading of scripture, Omphalos was rejected at the time by scientists on the grounds that it was completely [[falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] and by theologians because it implied to them a deceitful God, which they found theologically unacceptable.

Today, in contrast to Gosse, young Earth creationists posit that not only is the Earth young but that the scientific data supports that view. However, the apparent age concept is still used in young Earth creationist literature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apologeticspress.org/articles/1674 Apologetics Press – Apparent Age].

==Criticism==
Young Earth creationists adhere strongly to a concept of [[biblical inerrancy]], and regard the Bible as [[Biblical inspiration|divinely inspired]] and "infallible and completely authoritative on all matters with which they deal, free from error of any sort, scientific and historical as well as moral and theological".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icr.org/tenets/|title=Foundational Principles|publisher=Institute for Creation Research|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young Earth creationists also suggest that supporters of modern scientific understanding with which they disagree are primarily motivated by atheism. Critics reject this claim by pointing out that many supporters of evolutionary theory are religious believers, and that major religious groups, such as the [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], and [[Church of England]], believe that concepts such as physical cosmology, chemical origins of life, biological evolution, and geological fossil records do not imply a rejection of the scriptures. Critics also point out that workers in fields related to biology, chemistry, physics, or geosciences are not required to sign statements of belief in contemporary science comparable to the biblical inerrancy pledges required by creationist organizations, contrary to the creationist claim that scientists operate on an ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' disbelief in biblical principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=[none]|journal=Creation|url=http://creation.com/amazing-admission-lewontin-quote|title=Amazing admission|year=1998|volume=20|issue=3|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creationists also discount certain modern Christian theological positions, like those of French Jesuit priest, geologist and paleontologist [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], who saw that his work with evolutionary sciences actually confirmed and inspired his faith in the cosmic Christ; or those of [[Thomas Berry]], a cultural historian and [[ecotheology|ecotheologian]], that the [[cosmology|cosmological]] 13-billion-year "Universe Story" provides all faiths and all traditions with a single account by which the divine has made its presence in the world.&lt;ref&gt;See references and further information given at [[Objections to evolution#Atheism|Objections to evolution, Atheism]] for support of this paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of young Earth creationism are regularly accused of [[quote mining]], the practice of isolating passages from academic texts that appear to support their claims, while deliberately excluding context and conclusions to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/quotes/mine/project.html Quote Mine Project: Examining 'Evolution Quotes' of Creationists]. Talkorigins.org. Retrieved 20 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, scientists acknowledge that there are indeed a number of mysteries about the Universe left to be solved, and scientists actively working in the fields who identify inconsistencies or problems with extant models, when pressed, explicitly reject creationist interpretations. [[theology|Theologians]] and [[philosophy|philosophers]] have also criticized this "[[God of the gaps]]" viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newdualism.org/papers/R.Larmer/Gaps.htm |title=Is there anything wrong with "God of the gaps" reasoning? |author=Robert Larmer |accessdate=26 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024045851/http://www.newdualism.org/papers/R.Larmer/Gaps.htm |archivedate=24 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In defending against young Earth creationist attacks on "evolutionism" and "Darwinism", scientists and skeptics have offered rejoinders that every challenge made by YECs is either made in an unscientific fashion, or is readily explainable by science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org|title=TalkOrigins Archive: Exploring the Creation/Evolution Controversy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theological considerations===
Few modern theologians take the Genesis account of creation literally. Even many Christian [[evangelical]]s who reject the notion of purely naturalistic Darwinian evolution, often treat the story as a nonliteral saga, as poetry, or as [[Liturgy|liturgical literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Olson |first=Roger E. |title=The Westminster handbook to evangelical theology |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |edition=First |year=2004 |location=Louisville, KY |page=166 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=MBtFlW8vxuwC&amp;pg=PA166#v=onepage&amp;q=theologians%2C%20%22literal%20interpretation%22%2C%20genesis&amp;f=false |isbn=0-664-22464-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genesis contains two accounts of the Creation: in chapter 1 man was created after the animals ({{bibleverse||Genesis|1:24-26|9}}), while in chapter 2 man was created ({{bibleverse||Genesis|2:7|9}}) before the animals ({{bibleverse||Genesis|2:19|9}}).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite book|last1=Finkelstein|first1=Israel|last2=Silberman|first2=Neil Asher|title=The Bible Unearthed.

Other incongruities soon became apparent: the biblical text was filled with literary asides, explaining the ancient names of certain places and frequently noting that the evidences of famous biblical events were still visible "to this day." These factors convinced some seventeenth century scholars that the Bible's first five books, at least, had been shaped, expanded, and embellished by later, anonymous editors and revisers over the centuries.&lt;br /&gt;By the late eighteenth century and even more so in the nineteenth, many critical biblical scholars had begun to doubt that Moses had any hand in the writing of the Bible whatsoever; they had come to believe that the Bible was the work of later writers exclusively. These scholars pointed to what appeared to be different versions of the same stories within the books of the Pentateuch, suggesting that the biblical text was the product of several recognizable hands. A careful reading of the book of Genesis, for example, revealed two conflicting versions of the creation (1:1—2:3 and 2:4—25), two quite different genealogies of Adam's offspring (4:17—26 and 5:1—28), and two spliced and rearranged flood stories (6:5—9:17). In addition, there were dozens more doublets and sometimes even triplets of the same events in the narratives of the wanderings of the patriarchs, the Exodus from Egypt, and the giving of the Law.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller2003"&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Keith B.|editor-last=Miller|author-first=Conrad|chapter=Comparing Biblical and Scientific Maps of Origin|author-last=Hyers|title=Perspectives on an Evolving Creation|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=-5utmq5m7TAC&amp;pg=PA22|date=25 September 2003|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0-8028-0512-6|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the [[Documentary hypothesis]] suggest that Genesis 1 was a [[litany]] from the ''[[Priestly source|Priestly]]'' source (possibly from an early Jewish [[liturgy]]), while Genesis 2 was assembled from older ''[[Jahwist]]'' material, holding that, for both stories to be a single account, Adam would have named all the animals, and God would have created Eve from his rib as a suitable mate, all within a single 24 hour period. Creationists responding to this point attribute the view to misunderstanding having arisen from poor translation of the tenses in Genesis 2 in contemporary translations of the Bible (e.g. compare "planted" and "had planted" in the [[King James Version]] and [[New International Version]]).&lt;ref&gt;"And the {{LORD}} God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed." &amp;mdash;{{bibleverse||Genesis|2:8|9}}&amp;nbsp;KJV &lt;br /&gt;"Now the LORD God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there he put the man he had formed." &amp;mdash;{{bibleverse||Genesis|2:8|31}}&amp;nbsp;NIV&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christians assert that the Bible is free from error only in religious and moral matters, and that, where scientific or historic questions are concerned, the Bible should not be read literally. This position is held by a number of major denominations. For instance, in a publication entitled ''The Gift of Scripture'', the [[Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales]] comments that, "We should not expect to find in Scripture full scientific accuracy or complete historical precision". The Bible is held to be true in passages relating to human salvation, but, "We should not expect total accuracy from the Bible in other, secular matters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bishops' Conference of England and Wales |title=The Gift of Scripture |publisher=Catholic Truth Society |year=2005 |url=http://www.liturgyoffice.org.uk/Resources/Scripture/GoS.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=13 January 2011 |isbn=1-86082-323-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,13509-1811332,00.html |work=The Times |location=London |title=Catholic Church no longer swears by truth of the Bible |first=Ruth |last=Gledhill |date=5 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Catholic Church teaches that the Bible's message is without error, it does not consider it always to be literal.&lt;ref&gt;N.p., n.d. Web. 9 May 2017. &lt;http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, young Earth creationists contend that moral and spiritual matters in the Bible are intimately connected with its historical accuracy; in their view, the Bible stands or falls as a single indivisible block of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Creation|volume=26|issue=4|title=But Genesis is not a science textbook|author=Jonathan Sarfati|page=6|url=http://creation.com/but-genesis-is-not-a-science-textbook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from the theological doubts voiced by other Christians, young Earth creationism also stands in opposition to the creation mythologies of other religions (both [[wikt:extant|extant]] and [[extinct]]). Many of these make claims regarding the origin of the Universe and humanity that are completely incompatible with those of Christian creationists (and with one another).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Dictionary of Creation Myths|last=Leeming|first=D.A.|author2=Leeming, M.A.|year=1996|publisher=Oxford Paperbacks|isbn=0-19-510275-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marshaling support for the Judeo-Christian creation myth versus other creation myths after having rejected much of the scientific evidence is largely, then, done on the basis of accepting on faith the veracity of the biblical account rather than the alternative.

===Scientific refutation===
The vast majority of scientists refute young Earth creationism. Around the start of the 19th century mainstream science abandoned the concept that Earth was younger than millions of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://records.viu.ca/~johnstoi/darwin/sect2.htm |title=. . . And Still We Evolve: A Handbook on the History of Modern Science |last1=Johnston |first1=Ian |date=May 2000 |website=Vancouver Island University |accessdate=2014-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurements of biological, chemical, geological, and cosmological timescales differ from YEC's estimates of Earth's age by six [[orders of magnitude]] (that is, by factor of a million times). Scientific estimates of the age of the [[History of pottery|earliest pottery discovered]], the [[Dendochronology|oldest known trees]], the [[Ice core#Dating cores|ice cores]], and layers of silt deposit in [[Lake Suigetsu]] are all significantly older than the oldest YEC estimate of Earth's age. YEC's theories are further contradicted by scientists' ability to observe [[Starlight problem|galaxies billions of light years away]].

Spokespersons for the [[scientific community]] have generally regarded claims that YEC has a scientific basis as being religiously motivated [[pseudoscience]], because young Earth creationists only look for evidence to support their preexisting belief that the Bible is a literal description of the development of the Universe. In 1997, a poll by the Gallup organization showed that 5 per cent of U.S. adults with professional degrees in science took a young Earth creationist view. In the aforementioned poll, 40 per cent of the same group said  they believed that life, including humans, had evolved over millions of years, but that God guided this process, a view described as [[theistic evolution]], while 55 per cent held a view of "naturalistic evolution" in which no God took part in this process.&lt;ref name="gallup 1997"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/ev_publia.htm|title=Gallup Poll 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scientists (such as [[Hugh Ross (creationist)|Hugh Ross]] and [[Gerald Schroeder]]) who believe in creationism are known to subscribe to other forms, such as [[old Earth creationism]], which posits an act of creation that took place millions or billions of years ago, with variations on the timing of the creation of mankind.
