'''Abraham Dirk Loman''' (16 September 1823, [[The Hague]] – 17 April 1897, [[Amsterdam]]) was a Dutch theologian. He was a professor from 1856 to 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=H.U. Meyboom|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_jaa002189801_01/_jaa002189801_01_0016.php|title=Levensbericht van A.D. Loman |year=1898 |journal=Jaarboek van de Maatschappij der Nederlandse Letterkunde}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his later period he belonged to the [[Radical Criticism|Dutch radical critics]].&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;{{cite journal|author=A.J. Allan |url=http://www.radikalkritik.de/A_forgotten_chapter.htm |title=A Forgotten Chapter: the Radicals |journal=Kerk &amp; Wereld |year=1995 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717072449/http://www.radikalkritik.de/A_forgotten_chapter.htm |archivedate=2011-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Loman was the son of a [[minister (Christianity)|minister]] in the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Kingdom of the Netherlands|Dutch Lutheran church]]. He started studying theology in 1840 and became a minister in 1846. In 1856 he became a professor at the Lutheran [[seminary]] in Amsterdam. Loman gradually lost his eyesight in the beginning of the 1870s, but continued working. From 1877 he also was a theology professor at the [[University of Amsterdam]] until his retirement in 1893.&lt;ref name="deGroot"&gt;{{cite book|author=A. de Groot |chapterurl=http://www.inghist.nl/retroboeken/blnp/#1%3A138 |chapter=Loman, Abraham Dirk |title=Biografisch lexicon voor de geschiedenis van het Nederlands protestantisme |year=1978 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Loman introduced modern theology in the Dutch Lutheran Church. He taught almost all disciplines of theology, but concentrated after 1867 on the New Testament and early Christian literature. He wrote a book about the [[Muratorian fragment]], but published mostly in journals. His opinions mostly agreed with the [[Tübingen school]]. When his colleague [[Allard Pierson]] in 1878 denied the authenticity of [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]], Loman wrote a fierce condemnation.

But after 1880 his views changed. He was an advocate of the [[Christ myth theory]] and caused great consternation by a public lecture on 13 December 1881 in the [[Paradiso (Amsterdam)|building of the Vrije Gemeente]] where he stated that [[Jesus]] is not a figure of history and that all we know about him is second-century fiction.&lt;ref name="Allen"/&gt; In his ''Quaestiones Paulinae'' (1882, 1883, 1886) he abandoned Pauline authorship of Galatians.&lt;ref name="deGroot"/&gt; His arguments were that the Pauline epistles are not quoted by [[Justin Martyr]] and that the first datable references are by [[Marcion]].&lt;ref name="Schilling"&gt;{{cite web|author=Klaus Schilling |year=2003 |url=http://www.radikalkritik.de/vbve_survey.htm |title=A survey: G.A. van den Bergh van Eysinga |publisher=Radikalkritik - de omnibus dubitandum |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717072428/http://www.radikalkritik.de/vbve_survey.htm |archivedate=2011-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Al-Mawrid''' is an Islamic research institute in [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]] founded in 1983 and then re-established in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://al-mawrid.org/pages/research_detail.php?research_id=5 Javed Ahmad Ghamidi's Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801032942/http://www.al-mawrid.org/pages/research_detail.php?research_id=5 |date=2009-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The institute was established by [[Javed Ahmad Ghamidi]], a well-known Pakistani Islamic scholar, who has been inspired by [[Amin Ahsan Islahi]] and [[Hamiduddin Farahi]]. The organization describes its existence as a reaction to the problem in current Islamic learning, which focuses on "the foundational principles and the emanating discourses of a particular school of thought as well as the polemics to establish their superiority over those of others."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.javedahmadghamidi.com/about/view/almawrid-introduction|title=Almawrid Institute of Islamic Sciences {{!}} Javed Ahmad Ghamidi - Javed Ahmad Ghamidi|website=www.javedahmadghamidi.com|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The institution as a research and educational center aims to facilitate and perpetuate the explanatory and research work on the so-called "true understanding of Islam."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One of its main positions articulated by its founder involved the centralization of Islamic ministry in Pakistan to address the way mosques in the country are currently run privately and that anyone can preach without permission or accountability.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenational.ae/uae/pakistani-scholar-praises-uae-s-preaching-codes-1.319563|title=Pakistani scholar praises UAE’s preaching codes|work=The National|access-date=2018-07-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghamidi maintained that this condition promotes extremism and hatred.

==Projects==
The administration of Al-Mawrid Global is in the hands of its Board of Governors. The administrative system is founded on democratic principles. The President of the institution serves as the academic and intellectual patron, and the Secretary General is entrusted with its administrative affairs. Al-Mawrid Global is a charity registered in Scotland (no. SC044505), and the institution accepts contributions from all those who agree with its objectives.

The institution has its worldwide presence through its country chapters.

=== Criticism ===
Al-Mawrid is criticized for their progressive stand on various religious issues. Sometimes they are charged with fueling controversial topics, like calling for reform in the infamous Hudood laws. Javed Ghamidi is also referred by some as having involvement in the controversial movie 'Khuda kai liya', which brought the issue of radicalization into the limelight in Pakistan. Local and orthodox scholars often reject this school of thought and their liberal understanding of Islam. Some also refer to them as 'clean shave mullas'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hangingodes.wordpress.com/2007/04/07/is-javed-ghamidi-a-true-scholar/|title=Is Javed Ghamidi a True Scholar?|work=Hanging Odes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ghamidi and Al-Mawrid's moderate stance on Islam led to a conflict with the [[Taliban]], which forced Ghamidi to flee his country in 2010. Ghamidi's staff was murdered by the extremist group and Al-Mawrid is now being run through a website and its branches located in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[India]], [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Since 1948, Jodorowsky has worked as a novelist, a storyteller, a poet, a playwright, an essayist, a film director and producer, an actor in cinematic and theatre productions, a theatre director, a screenwriter, a film editor, a [[comics writer]], a musician and composer, a philosopher, a [[puppeteer]], a [[mime]], a [[psychologist]] and psychoanalyst, a [[draughtsman]], a painter, a sculptor and a spiritual [[guru]].
Best known for his [[avant-garde]] films, he has been "venerated by [[cult film|cult cinema]] enthusiasts" for his work which "is filled with violently [[surrealism|surreal]] images and a hybrid blend of [[mysticism]] and religious provocation".&lt;ref name="Church"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/directors/07/jodorowsky.html |title=Alejandro Jodorowsky |journal=Senses of Cinema |first=David |last=Church |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129173737/http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/directors/07/jodorowsky.html |archivedate=29 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born to [[Jewish-Ukrainian]] parents in [[Chile]], Jodorowsky experienced an unhappy and alienated childhood, and so immersed himself in reading and writing poetry. Dropping out of college, he became involved in theater and in particular mime, working as a clown before founding his own theater troupe, the ''Teatro Mimico'', in 1947. Moving to Paris in the early 1950s, Jodorowsky studied mime under [[Étienne Decroux]] before turning to cinema, directing the short film ''[[Les têtes interverties]]'' in 1957. From 1960 he divided his time between Paris and [[Mexico City]], in the former becoming a founding member of the anarchistic avant-garde [[Panic Movement]] of performance artists. In 1966 he created his first comic strip, ''Anibal 5'', while in 1967 he directed his first feature film, the surrealist ''[[Fando y Lis]]'', which caused a huge scandal in [[Mexico]], eventually being banned.

His next film, the [[acid western]] ''[[El Topo]]'' (1970), became a hit on the [[midnight movie]] circuit in the United States, considered as the first-ever midnight cult film, and garnered high praise from [[John Lennon]], who convinced former [[Beatles]] manager [[Allen Klein]] to provide Jodorowsky with $1&amp;nbsp;million to finance his next film. The result was ''[[The Holy Mountain (1973 film)|The Holy Mountain]]'' (1973), a surrealist exploration of [[western esotericism]]. Disagreements with Klein, however, led to both ''The Holy Mountain'' and ''El Topo'' failing to gain widespread distribution, although both became classics on the underground film circuit.&lt;ref name="Church"/&gt;

After [[Dune (Jodorowsky film)|an aborted attempt]] at filming [[Frank Herbert]]'s 1965 science fiction novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', Jodorowsky produced five more films: the family film ''[[Tusk (1980 film)|Tusk]]'' (1980); the surrealist horror ''[[Santa Sangre]]'' (1989); the failed blockbuster ''[[The Rainbow Thief]]'' (1990); and the first two films in a planned five-film autobiographical series ''[[The Dance of Reality]]'' (2013) and ''[[Endless Poetry]]'' (2016). During the same period, he wrote  a series of science fiction comic books, most notably ''[[The Incal]]'' (1980–1989), which has been described as having a claim to be "the best comic book" ever written,&lt;ref&gt;Parkin, Lance (2001). ''The Pocket Essential: Alan Moore''. Pocket Essentials. Page 7.&lt;/ref&gt; and also ''[[The Technopriests]]'' and ''[[Metabarons]]''. He has also written books and regularly lectures on his own spiritual system, which he calls "psychomagic" and "psychoshamanism" and which borrows from his interests in [[alchemy]], the [[tarot]], [[Zen Buddhism]] and [[shamanism]].{{sfn|Jodorowsky|2005|p=xi}} His son Cristóbal has followed his teachings on psychoshamanism; this work is captured in the feature documentary ''Quantum Men'', directed by Carlos Serrano Azcona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sitgesfilmfestival.com/eng/film/?id=10002152 |title=Sitges Film Festival 'Quantum Men' |publisher=Sitgesfilmfestival.com |date=1 January 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Jodorowsky was born in 1929 in the coastal town of [[Tocopilla]], Chile, to parents who were Jewish immigrants from [[Yekaterinoslav]] (now [[Dnipro (city)|Dnipro]]), [[Elisavetgrad]] (now [[Kropyvnytskyi]]) and other cities of the [[Russian Empire]] (now Ukraine). His father, Jaime Jodorowsky Groismann, was a merchant,{{sfn|Jodorowsky|2005|p=ix}} who was largely abusive to his wife Sara Felicidad Prullansky Arcavi, and at one time accused her of flirting with a customer. Angered, he subsequently beat and raped her, getting her pregnant, which led to the birth of Alejandro. Because of this brutal conception, Sara both hated her husband and disliked her son, telling him that "I cannot love you" and rarely showing him tenderness.{{sfn|Jodorowsky|2005|pp=39–40}} Alejandro also had an elder sister, Raquel Jodorowsky, but disliked her, for he believed that she was selfish, doing "everything to expel me from the family so that she could be the centre of attention."{{sfn|Jodorowsky|2005|p=140}} Alongside his dislike for his family, he also held contempt for many of the local people, who viewed him as an outsider because of his status as the son of immigrants, and also for the American mining industrialists who worked locally and treated the Chilean people badly.&lt;ref name="Church"/&gt; It was this treatment at the hands of Americans that led to his later condemnation of American [[imperialism]] and [[neo-colonialism]] in Latin America in several of his films. Nonetheless he liked his local area, and was greatly unhappy when he was forced to leave it aged nine years old, something for which he blamed his father.{{sfn|Jodorowsky|2005|p=115}} His family subsequently moved to the city of [[Santiago, Chile]].

He immersed himself in reading, and also began writing poetry, having his first poem published when he was sixteen years old, alongside associating with such Chilean poets as [[Nicanor Parra]], [[Stella Díaz Varín]] and [[Enrique Lihn]].&lt;ref name="empire-oct-09"&gt;{{Cite news|title=All about Alejandro|last=Braund|first=Simon|date=October 2009|work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Becoming interested in the political ideology of [[anarchism]], he began attending college, studying [[psychology]] and philosophy, but stayed for only two years. After dropping out, and having an interest in theatre and particularly [[mime]], he took up employment as a [[clown]] in a [[circus]] and began a career as a theatre director.&lt;ref name="Church"/&gt; Meanwhile, in 1947 he founded his own theatrical troupe, the Teatro Mimico,&lt;ref name="empire-oct-09"/&gt; which by 1952 had fifty members, and the following year he wrote his first play, ''El Minotaura'' (''The Minotaur''). Nonetheless, Jodorowsky felt that there was little for him left in Chile, and so that year he moved to Paris, France.&lt;ref name="Church"/&gt;

It was while in Paris that Jodorowsky began studying mime with [[Étienne Decroux]] and joined the troupe of one of Decroux's students, [[Marcel Marceau]]. It was with Marceau's troupe that he went on a world tour, and wrote several routines for the group, including "The Cage" and "The Mask Maker". After this, he returned to theatre directing, working on the music hall comeback of [[Maurice Chevalier]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="Church"/&gt; In 1957, Jodorowsky turned his hand to filmmaking, creating ''[[Les têtes interverties]]'' (''The Severed Heads''), a 20-minute adaptation of [[Thomas Mann]]'s novella. It consisted almost entirely of mime, and told the surreal story of a head-swapping merchant who helps a young man find courtship success. Jodorowsky played the lead role. The director [[Jean Cocteau]] admired the film, and wrote an introduction for it. It was considered lost until a print of the film was discovered in 2006.

In 1960, Jodorowsky moved to Mexico, where he settled down in [[Mexico City]]. Nonetheless, he continued to return occasionally to France, on one occasion visiting the [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] artist [[André Breton]], but he was disillusioned in that he felt Breton had become somewhat conservative in his old age.&lt;ref name="Church"/&gt; Continuing his interest in surrealism, in 1962 he founded the [[Panic Movement]] along with [[Fernando Arrabal]] and [[Roland Topor]]. The movement aimed to go beyond the conventional surrealist ideas by embracing absurdism. Its members refused to take themselves seriously, while laughing at those critics who did.&lt;ref name="Church"/&gt; In 1966 he produced his first comic strip, ''Anibal 5'', which was related to the Panic Movement. The following year he created a new feature film, ''[[Fando y Lis]]'',&lt;ref name="empire-oct-09"/&gt; loosely based on a play written by [[Fernando Arrabal]], who was working with Jodorowsky on [[performance art]] at the time. ''Fando y Lis'' premiered at the 1968 [[Acapulco]] Film Festival, where it instigated a riot amongst those objecting to the film's content,&lt;ref name="Rosenbaum92"&gt;Rosenbaum, 1992. p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently it was banned in Mexico.&lt;ref name="Rosenbaum93"&gt;Rosenbaum, 1992. p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in Mexico City that he encountered Ejo Takata (1928–1997), a [[Zen Buddhism|Zen Buddhist]] monk who had studied at the Horyuji and Shofukuji monasteries in Japan before traveling to Mexico via the United States in 1967 to spread Zen. Jodorowsky became a disciple of Takata and offered his own house to be turned into a [[zendo]]. Subsequently, Takata attracted other disciples around him, who spent their time in [[meditation]] and the study of [[koan]]s.{{sfn|Jodorowsky|2005|pp=2–4}} Eventually, Takata instructed Jodorowsky that he had to learn more about his feminine side, and so he went and befriended the English surrealist [[Leonora Carrington]], who recently had moved to Mexico.{{sfn|Jodorowsky|2005|p=24}}

==Career==
===''El Topo'' and ''The Holy Mountain'' (1970–1974)===
In 1970, Jodorowsky released the film ''[[El Topo]]'', which sometimes is known in English as ''The Mole'',&lt;ref name="empire-oct-09"/&gt; which he had both directed and starred in. An [[acid western]], ''El Topo'' tells the story of a wandering Mexican bandit and [[gunslinger]], El Topo (played by Jodorowsky), who is on a search for spiritual enlightenment, taking his young son along with him. Along the way, he violently confronts a number of other individuals, before finally being killed and being resurrected to live within a community of deformed people who are trapped inside a mountain cave. Describing the work, he stated that "I ask of film what most North Americans ask of psychedelic drugs. The difference being that when one creates a psychedelic film, he need not create a film that shows the visions of a person who has taken a pill; rather, he needs to manufacture the pill."&lt;ref&gt;Jodorowsky, ''El Topo: The Book of the Film'', p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Knowing how ''Fando y Lis'' had caused such a scandal in Mexico, Jodorowsky decided not to release ''El Topo'' there,&lt;ref name="Rosenbaum93" /&gt; instead focusing on its release in other countries across the world, including Mexico's northern neighbour, the United States. It was in New York City where the film would play as a "[[midnight movie]]" for several months at [[Ben Barenholtz]]'s [[Elgin Theater]]. It attracted the attention of rock musician and countercultural figure [[John Lennon]], who thought very highly of it, and convinced the president of [[The Beatles]]' company [[Apple Corps]], [[Allen Klein]], to distribute it in the United States.{{sfn|Jodorowsky|2005|p=237}}

Klein agreed to give Jodorowsky $1&amp;nbsp;million to go toward creating his next film. The result was ''[[The Holy Mountain (1973 film)|The Holy Mountain]]'', released in 1973. It has been suggested that ''The Holy Mountain'' may have been inspired by [[René Daumal]]'s Surrealist novel ''[[Mount Analogue]]''. ''The Holy Mountain'' was another complex, multi-part story that featured a man credited as "The Thief" and equated with Jesus Christ, a mystical [[Alchemy|alchemist]] played by Jodorowsky, seven powerful business people representing seven of the planets (Venus and the six planets from Mars to Pluto), a religious training regimen of spiritual rebirth, and a quest to the top of a holy mountain for the secret of [[immortality]]. During the completion of ''The Holy Mountain'', Jodorowsky received spiritual training from [[Oscar Ichazo]] of the [[Arica School]], who encouraged him to take [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] and guided him through the subsequent [[Psychedelia|psychedelic]] experience.&lt;ref&gt;Jodorowsky's audio commentary on the Anchor Bay DVD of ''The Holy Mountain''.&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time (2 November 1973), Jodorowsky participated in an [[isolation tank]] experiment conducted by [[John C. Lilly|John Lilly]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John C. Lilly]], ''The Deep Self: Profound Relaxation and the Tank Isolation Technique'', Simon &amp; Schuster (1977), pp. 220–221.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly thereafter, Allen Klein demanded that Jodorowsky create a film adaptation of Pauline Réage's classic novel of female [[Sadomasochism|masochism]], ''[[Story of O]]''. Klein had promised this adaptation to various investors. Jodorowsky, who had discovered [[feminism]] during the filming of ''The Holy Mountain'', refused to make the film, going so far as to leave the country to escape directing duties. In retaliation, Allen Klein made ''El Topo'' and ''The Holy Mountain'', to which he held the rights, completely unavailable to the public for more than 30 years. Jodorowsky frequently decried Klein's actions in interviews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web5.premiere.com/directors/3354/q-a-alejandro-jodorowsky.html Premiere – Q&amp;A: Alejandro Jodorowsky]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electricsailor.blogspot.com/2007/06/trance-mutations-on-holy-mountain.html |title=Trance Mutations on the Holy Mountain |publisher=Electricsailor.blogspot.com |date=19 June 2007 |accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the release of ''The Holy Mountain'', Jodorowsky gave a talk at the Teatro [[Julio Castillo]], [[University of Mexico]] on the subject of koans (despite the fact that he initially had been booked on the condition that his talk would be about cinematography), at which Ejo Takata appeared. After the talk, Takata gave Jodorowsky his [[kyosaku]], believing that his former student had mastered the art of understanding koans.&lt;ref&gt;Jodorowsky, Alejandro (2005). ''The Spiritual Journey of Alejandro Jodorowsky''. Rochester, Vermont: Park Street Press. pp. 194–216.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Dune'' and ''Tusk'' (1975–1980)===
In December 1974, a French consortium led by Jean-Paul Gibon purchased the [[film rights]] to [[Frank Herbert]]'s epic 1965 science fiction novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' and asked Jodorowsky to direct [[Dune (Jodorowsky film)|a film version]]. Jodorowsky planned to cast the Surrealist artist [[Salvador Dalí]], in what would have been his only speaking role as a film actor, in the role of Emperor [[Shaddam IV]]. Dalí agreed when Jodorowsky offered to pay him a fee of $100,000 per minute of screen time.&lt;ref name=Dune&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also planned to cast [[Orson Welles]] as Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen]]; Welles only agreed when Jodorowsky offered to get his favourite gourmet chef to prepare his meals for him throughout the filming.{{sfn|Jodorowsky|2005|pp=227–230}} The book's protagonist, [[Paul Atreides]], was to be played by Jodorowsky's son, [[Brontis Jodorowsky]]. The music would be composed by [[Pink Floyd]] and [[Magma (band)|Magma]].&lt;ref name=Dune /&gt; Jodorowsky set up a pre-production unit in Paris consisting of [[Chris Foss]], a British artist who designed covers for science fiction publications, [[Jean Giraud]] (Moebius), a French illustrator who created and also wrote and drew for ''[[Métal Hurlant]]'' magazine, and [[H. R. Giger]].&lt;ref name=Dune /&gt; Frank Herbert travelled to Europe in 1976 to find that $2&amp;nbsp;million of the $9.5&amp;nbsp;million budget had already been spent in pre-production, and that Jodorowsky's script would result in a 14-hour movie ("It was the size of a phonebook", Herbert later recalled).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://filmmakermagazine.com/72541-10-lessons-on-filmmaking-from-director-alejandro-jodorowsky/ |title=10 Lessons on Filmmaking from Director Alejandro Jodorowsky |first1=Ariston |last1=Anderson |first2=Alejandro |last2=Jodorowsky |work=[[Filmmaker (magazine)|Filmmaker]] |publisher=[[Independent Feature Project]] |date=17 June 2013 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409080232/http://filmmakermagazine.com/72541-10-lessons-on-filmmaking-from-director-alejandro-jodorowsky/ |archivedate=9 April 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jodorowsky took creative liberties with the source material, but Herbert said that he and Jodorowsky had an amicable relationship. The production for the film collapsed when no film studio could be found willing to fund the movie to Jodorowsky's terms. The aborted production was chronicled in the documentary ''[[Jodorowsky's Dune]]''. Subsequently, the rights for filming were sold to [[Dino de Laurentiis]], who employed the American filmmaker [[David Lynch]] to direct, creating the film ''[[Dune (film)|Dune]]'' in 1984.

After the collapse of the ''Dune'' project, Jodorowsky completely changed course and, in 1980, premiered his children's fable ''[[Tusk (1980 film)|Tusk]]'', shot in India. Taken from [[Reginald Campbell]]'s novel ''[[Poo Lorn of the Elephants]]'', the film explores the [[soul-mate]] relationship between a young British woman living in India and a highly prized elephant. The film exhibited little of the director's outlandish visual style and was never given wide release.

===''Santa Sangre'' and ''The Rainbow Thief'' (1981–1990)===
In 1982 Jodorowsky divorced his wife.{{sfn|Jodorowsky|2005|p=235}}

In 1989, Jodorowsky completed the Mexican-Italian production ''[[Santa Sangre]]'' (''Holy Blood''). The film received limited theatrical distribution, putting Jodorowsky back on the cultural map despite its mixed critical reviews. ''Santa Sangre'' was a surrealistic [[slasher film]] with a plot like a mix of [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' with [[Robert Wiene]]'s "[[The Hands of Orlac (1924 film)|The Hands of Orlac]]". It featured a protagonist who, as a child, saw his mother lose both her arms, and as an adult let his own arms act as hers, and so was forced to commit murders at her whim. Several of Jodorowsky's sons were recruited as actors.

He followed in 1990 with a very different film, ''[[The Rainbow Thief]]''. Though it gave Jodorowsky a chance to work with the "movie stars" [[Peter O'Toole]] and [[Omar Sharif]], the executive producer, [[Alexander Salkind]], effectively curtailed most of Jodorowsky's artistic inclinations, threatening to fire him on the spot if anything in the script was changed (Salkind's wife, [[Berta Domínguez D.]], wrote the screenplay).

That same year (1990), Jodorowsky and his family returned to live in France.{{sfn|Jodorowsky|2005|p=216}}

In 1995, Alejandro's son, Teo, died in an accident while his father was busy preparing for a trip to Mexico City to promote his new book. Upon arriving in Mexico City, he gave a lecture at the [[Julio Castillo]] Theatre where once again he met Ejo Takata, who at this time had moved into a poor suburb of the city where he had continued to teach meditation and Zen. Takata would die two years later, and Jodorowsky would never get to see his old friend again.{{sfn|Jodorowsky|2005|pp=216–218}}

===Attempts to return to filmmaking (1990–2011)===
[[File:AlejandroJodorowsky.jpg|thumb|220px|Jodorowsky (age 77) in [[Sitges]], Spain (2006).]]

In 2000, Jodorowsky won the [[Jack Smith Lifetime Achievement Award]] from the [[Chicago Underground Film Festival]] (CUFF). Jodorowsky attended the festival and his films were shown, including ''El Topo'' and ''The Holy Mountain'', which at the time had grey legal status. According to festival director [[Bryan Wendorf]], it was an open question of whether CUFF would be allowed to show both films, or whether the police would show up and shut the festival down.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Until 2007, ''Fando y Lis'' and ''Santa Sangre'' were the only Jodorowsky works available on DVD. Neither ''El Topo'' nor ''The Holy Mountain'' were available on [[videocassette]] or DVD in the United States or the United Kingdom, due to ownership disputes with distributor [[Allen Klein]]. After settlement of the dispute in 2004, however, plans to re-release Jodorowsky's films were announced by ABKCO Films. On 19 January 2007, the website,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jahnke |first=Adam |url=http://www.digitalbits.com/ |title=Celebrating Film in the Digital Age |publisher=The Digital Bits }}&lt;/ref&gt; announced that on 1 May 2007, [[Anchor Bay Entertainment|Anchor Bay]] released a box set including ''El Topo'', ''The Holy Mountain'', and ''Fando y Lis''. A limited edition of the set includes both the ''El Topo'' and ''The Holy Mountain'' soundtracks. And, in early February 2007, Tartan Video announced its 14 May 2007, release date for the UK ''PAL DVD'' editions of ''El Topo'', ''The Holy Mountain'', and the six-disc box set which, alongside the aforementioned feature films, includes the two soundtrack CDs, as well as separate DVD editions of Jodorowsky's 1968 debut feature ''Fando y Lis'' (with his 1957 short ''La cravate'' a.k.a. ''Les têtes interverties'', included as an extra) and the 1994 feature-length documentary ''La constellation Jodorowsky''. Notably, ''Fando y Lis'' and ''La cravate'' were digitally restored extensively and remastered in London during late 2006, thus providing the perfect complement to the quality restoration work undertaken on ''El Topo'' and ''The Holy Mountain'' in the States by Abkco, and ensuring that the presentation of ''Fando y Lis'' is a significant improvement over the 2001 Fantoma DVD edition. Prior to the availability of these legitimate releases, only inferior quality, optically censored, [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]] copies of both ''El Topo'' and ''The Holy Mountain'' have been circulated on the Internet and on DVD.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In the 1990s and early 2000s, Jodorowsky attempted to make [[El Topo#Sequel|a sequel to ''El Topo'']], called at different times ''The Sons of El Topo'' and ''Abel Cain'', but could not find investors for the project.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In an interview with ''[[Premiere Magazine]]'', Jodorowsky said he intended his next project to be a gangster film called ''[[King Shot]]''. In an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper in November 2009, however, Jodorowsky revealed that he was unable to find the funds to make ''King Shot'', and instead would be entering preparations on ''[[Abel Cain|Sons of El Topo]]'', for which he claimed to have signed a contract with "some Russian producers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author =Steve Rose |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/nov/14/alejandro-jodorowosky-el-topo |title='Lennon, Manson and me: the psychedelic cinema of Alejandro Jodorowsky' &amp;#124; Guardian Film |work=The Guardian |date= 14 November 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Dance of Reality'' and ''Endless Poetry'' (2011–present)===
In August 2011, Alejandro arrived in a town in Chile where he grew up, also the setting of his autobiography ''[[The Dance of Reality]]'', to promote an autobiographical film based upon his book.

On 31 October 2011, [[Halloween]] night, the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (New York City) honored Jodorowsky by showing ''The Holy Mountain''. He attended and spoke about his work and life.&lt;ref name="TarotNYT"/&gt; The next evening, he presented ''El Topo'' at the Walter Reade Theatre at Lincoln Center.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Alejandro has stated that after finishing ''The Dance of Reality'' he was preparing to shoot his long-gestating ''[[El Topo]]'' sequel, ''[[Abel Cain]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eleconomista.com.mx/entretenimiento/2011/11/30/confirma-jodorowsky-su-regreso-cine |title=Confirma Jodorowsky su regreso al cine |language=es |journal=[[El Economista (Mexico)|El Economista]] |date=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2011/11/30/cultura/1322631492.html |title=Jodorowsky: 'Todos los problemas vienen de la familia' &amp;#124; Cultura |journal=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]|date=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By January 2013, Alejandro finished filming on ''The Dance of Reality'' and entered into post-production.

In 2015, Jodorowsky began a new film entitled ''[[Endless Poetry]]'', the sequel to his last "auto-biopic", ''The Dance of Reality''. His Paris-based production company, Satori Films, launched two successful [[crowdfunding]] campaigns to finance the film. The Indiegogo campaign has been left open indefinitely, receiving donations from fans and movie-goers in support of the independent production.&lt;ref&gt;name="Indiegogo" https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/alejandro-jodorowsky-endless-poetry&lt;/ref&gt; The Film was shot between June and August 2015,  in the streets of Matucana in Santiago, Chile, where Jodorowsky lived for a period in his life.&lt;ref name="kickstarter.com"/&gt; The film portrays his young adulthood in Santiago, years during which he became a core member of the Chilean poetic avant-garde alongside artists such as like Hugo Marín, Gustavo Becerra, Enrique Lihn, Stella Díaz Varín, Nicanor Parra and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRuJlHp0PB0|title=Alejandro Jodorowsky's special message on KICKSTARTER – Feb 15 2015|last=UPLINK|date=15 February 2015|accessdate=12 February 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poesiasinfin.com|title=Alejandro Jodorowsky – Endless Poetry|website=Alejandro Jodorowsky – Endless Poetry|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jodorowsky's son, [[Adan Jodorowsky]], plays him as an adult.

Jodorowsky started his comic career in Mexico with the creation of ''[[Anibal 5]]'' series in mid-1966 with illustrations by [[Manuel Moro]]. He also drew his own comic strip in the weekly series ''Fabulas pánicas'' that appeared in the Mexican newspaper, ''[[El Heraldo de México]]''. He also wrote original stories for at least two or three other comic books in Mexico during those days: ''[[Los insoportables Borbolla]]'' was one of them. After his fourth film, ''[[Tusk (1980 film)|Tusk]]'', he started ''[[The Incal]]'', with [[Jean Giraud]] (Mœbius). This [[graphic novel]] has its roots deep in the tarot and its symbols, e.g., the protagonist of ''The Incal'', [[John Difool]], is linked to the [[The Fool (Zero)|Fool card]]. ''The Incal'' (which would branch off into a prequel and sequel) forms the first in a sequence of several science fiction comic book series, all set in the same [[space opera]] [[Jodoverse]] (or "Metabarons Universe") published by [[Humanoids Publishing]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Comic books set in this milieu are Incal (trilogy: ''[[Before the Incal]]/ [[Incal]]/ [[Final Incal]]''), [[Metabarons]] (trilogy: ''[[Castaka]]/ [[The Caste of the Metabarons]]/ [[Weapons of the Metabaron]]''), and ''[[Technopriests|The Technopriests]]'' and also a [[tabletop roleplaying game|RPG adaptation]], ''[[Metabarons Roleplaying Game|The Metabarons Roleplaying Game]]''. Many ideas and concepts derived from Jodorowsky's planned adaptation of ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' (which he would have only loosely based upon [[Frank Herbert]]'s original novel) are featured in this universe.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Mœbius and Jodorowsky sued [[Luc Besson]], director of ''[[The Fifth Element]]'', claiming that the 1997 film borrowed graphic and story elements from ''[[The Incal]]'', but they lost their case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toutenbd.com/article.php3?id_article=697 |title=Mœbius perd son procès contre Besson |accessdate=20 January 2007 |date=28 May 2004 |language=French |work=''ToutenBD.com'' |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028025038/http://www.toutenbd.com/article.php3?id_article=697 |archive-date=28 October 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The suit was plagued by ambiguity since Mœbius had willingly participated in the creation of the film, having been hired by Besson as a contributing artist, but had done so without gaining the approval of ''Incal'' co-creator Jodorowsky, whose services Besson did not call upon. For more than a decade, Jodorowsky pressured his publisher [[Les Humanoïdes Associés]] to sue Luc Besson for [[plagiarism]], but the publisher refused, fearing the inevitability of the final outcome. In a 2002 interview with the Danish comic book magazine ''Strip!'', Jodorowsky stated that he considered it an honour that somebody stole his ideas.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Other comics by Jodorowsky include the Western ''Bouncer'' illustrated by [[Francois Boucq]], ''Juan Solo'' (''Son of the Gun''), and ''Le Lama blanc'' (''The White Lama''), the later were illustrated by [[Georges Bess]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

''Le Cœur couronné'' (''The Crowned Heart'', translated into English as ''The Madwoman of the Sacred Heart''), a racy satire on religion set in contemporary times, won Jodorowsky and his collaborator, [[Jean Giraud]], the 2001 [[Haxtur Award]] for Best Long Strip. He is currently working on a new graphic novel for the U.S. market.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Jodorowsky's comic book work also appears in ''[[Taboo (comic)|Taboo]]'' volume 4 (ed. [[Stephen R. Bissette]]), which features an interview with the director, designs for his version of Frank Herbert's ''Dune'', comic storyboards for ''El Topo'', and a collaboration with Moebius with the illustrated ''Eyes of the Cat''.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Jodorowsky collaborated with [[Milo Manara]] in ''[[Borgia]]'' (2006), a graphic novel about the history of the [[House of Borgia]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

===Psychomagic===
{{BLP sources section|date=July 2017}}
Jodorowsky spent almost a decade reconstructing the original form of the [[Tarot of Marseilles|Tarot de Marseille]].&lt;ref name="TarotNYT"&gt;{{cite news | author=David Coleman | title=When the Tarot Trumps All | work=Fashion &amp; Style | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/13/fashion/alejandro-jodorowsky-and-his-tarot-de-marseille.html?_r=1&amp;smid=tw-nytimesarts&amp;seid=auto | accessdate=13 November 2011 | date=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this work he moved into more therapeutic work in three areas: psychomagic, [[psychogenealogy]] and [[initiatic massage]]. Psychomagic aims to heal psychological wounds suffered in life. This therapy is based on the belief that the performance of certain acts can directly act upon the unconscious mind, releasing it from a series of traumas, some of which practitioners of the therapy believe are passed down from generation to generation. Psychogenealogy includes the studying of the patient's personality and family tree in order to best address their specific sources. It is similar, in its phenomenological approach to genealogy, to the [[Family Constellations|Constellations]] pioneered by Bert Hellinger.

Jodorowsky has several books on his therapeutic methods, including ''Psicomagia: La trampa sagrada'' (''Psychomagic: The Sacred Trap'') and his autobiography, ''La danza de la realidad'' (''[[The Dance of Reality]]''), which he was filming as a feature-length film in March 2012. To date he has published more than 23 novels and philosophical treatises, along with dozens of articles and interviews. His books are widely read in Spanish and French, but are for the most part unknown to English-speaking audiences.

Throughout his career, Jodorowsky has gained a reputation as a philosopher and scholar who presents the teachings of religion, [[psychology]], and spiritual masters, by molding them into imaginative endeavors. All of his enterprises integrate an artistic approach. Currently, Jodorowsky dedicates much of his time to lecturing about his work.

For a quarter of a century, Jodorowsky held classes and lectures for free, in cafés and universities all over the city of Paris. Typically, such courses or talks would begin on Wednesday evenings as [[tarot divination]] lessons, and would culminate in an hour long conference, also free, where at times hundreds of attendees would be treated to live demonstrations of a psychological "arbre généalogique" ("tree of genealogy") involving volunteers from the audience. In these conferences, Jodorowsky would pave the way to building a strong base of students of his philosophy, which deals with understanding the [[unconscious mind|unconscious]] as the "over-self", composed of many generations of family relatives, living or deceased, acting on the [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]], well into adult lives, and causing [[Compulsive behavior|compulsion]]s. Of all his work, Jodorowsky considers these activities to be the most important of his life. Though such activities only take place in the insular world of [[Parisian café]]s, he has devoted thousands of hours of his life to teaching and helping people "become more conscious," as he puts it.

Since 2011 these talks have dwindled to once a month and take place at the "[[Librairie Les Cent Ciels]]" in Paris.

==Personal life==
Jodorowsky's first wife was the actress Valérie Trumblay.  He is currently married to the artist and costume designer Pascale Montandon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Family &amp;#124; Alejandro Jodorowsky|url=http://www.alejandro-jodorowsky.de/leben/familie.html|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has four sons: [[Brontis Jodorowsky]], an actor (he worked with his father in ''El Topo'' and ''The Dance of Reality''); Teo (died of overdose in 1995, at the age of 24; he played a role in ''Santa Sangre'');&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/16/magazine/the-psychomagical-realism-of-alejandro-jodorowsky.html|title=The Psychomagical Realism of Alejandro Jodorowsky|first=Eric|last=Benson|date=14 March 2014|accessdate=12 February 2018|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Axel Jodorowsky|Cristóbal]], a psychoshaman and an actor (interpreter in ''Santa Sangre'' and the main character in the shamanic documentary ''Quantum Men''); and [[Adan Jodorowsky]], the youngest, a musician known by his stage name of Adanowsky. He also has a daughter, Eugenia.

On his religious views, Jodorowsky has called himself an "atheist mystic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alejandro Jodorowsky|url=http://sensesofcinema.com/2007/great-directors/jodorowsky/#b23|work=Senses of Cinema|accessdate=13 October 2013|author =David Church|date=February 2007|quote=However, while Buñuel's attacks on religion are primarily confined to Catholicism, Jodorowsky not only violates but de-centres Western religious traditions by creating a hybrid amalgamation of Western, non-Western and occult beliefs. A self-described "atheist mystic", he has claimed to hate religion (for it "is killing the planet"), but he loves mysticism and occult practices like alchemy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He does not drink or smoke,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cultura.elpais.com/cultura/2013/05/30/actualidad/1369942839_419557.html|title=El psicomago se cuenta a sí mismo|trans-title=The psychomagician talks about himself|journal=[[El País]]|date=31 May 2013|first=Gregorio|last=Belinchón|location=Madrid|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has stated that he does not eat red meat and poultry because he "does not like corpses", basing his diet on vegetables, fruits, cereals and occasionally marine products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/alejodorowsky/status/624278853129740289|accessdate=10 June 2016|title=Alejandro Jodorowsky|date=23 July 2015|first=Alejandro|last=Jodorowsky|quote=No como carne...

Jodorowsky was interviewed by [[Daniel Pinchbeck]] for the Franco-German television show ''[[Durch die Nacht mit …]]'' on the TV station [[Arte]], in a very personal discussion, spending a night together in France, continuing the interview in different locations such as a park and a hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Hasko Baumann |author2=Thorsten Hanisch |author3=Alexander Stahl |url=http://www.dasmanifest.com/04/ddnjodorowskypinchbeck.php |title=Dasmanifest.com |publisher=Dasmanifest.com |date=25 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and controversy==
Alejandro Jodorowsky made a thorough statement&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/323777330058/posts/yo-alejandro-jodorowsky-durante-la-filmaci%C3%B3n-de-una-escena-de-el-topo-viol%C3%A9-a-un/10154430271880059/&lt;/ref&gt; on his Facebook account on June 26, 2017, in response to the question: ''Did you rape an actress during the filming of'' [[El Topo]]?

The following excerpts are from said statement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Where did [the people claiming that I raped Mara Lorenzio on the set of ''El Topo'' in front of the camera] find reports of this alleged incident that would have happened in 1969?

It’s very possible that they read some of the interviews I did in the United States or England back then. I produced ''El Topo'' independently. When I told the Mexican film industry that I was going to travel to New York to sell ''El Topo'', they made fun of me. “You’re crazy, only [[Emilio Fernandez]] ('El Indio') has ever managed to release a movie there and that’s why there is a statue of him. No Mexican film has ever crossed the cactus wall.” In the North American cinematographic environment of the time, Mexican cinema was despised. Hollywood dominated everything.

I had to break through using the only tool I had: shock through scandalous statements. This is how I did it: I dressed up as the mystical bandit character [the titular El Topo], I introduced myself in the interviews with a beard, a mane and a black leather suit, and I said things that purposefully shocked the interviewers. “I am an anti-feminist, I hate women. I hate cats. I’ve eaten human meat tacos with Diego Rivera. ''El Topo'' is a film where things really happened: that scene of rape is a real rape! I killed the animals (that in reality I had purchased dead from a local zoo) with a fork I sharpened myself!” These aggressive, meant to be humorous declarations conquered the era’s young public who were against the establishment and affected by the Vietnam war. This is how I managed to get ''El Topo'' to be noticed and seen, and, thanks to the openly proclaimed admiration of [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]], my film became a cult classic. Half a century has passed and it continues to be screened and discussed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jodorowsky also offered details in that same statement on the filming of the so-called “rape scene”:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Filming a scene like this is not achieved with just a cameraman, two actors and an expanse of sand. Cinema is the most costly art because a large number of technicians and artists are required to execute it. First of all, you needed a group of workers to clean a hundred square meters of desert with rakes because of dangerous snakes and spiders that were hidden in the sand. They remained for the duration of the filming, at the ready, to intervene if necessary. There was also a group of makeup artists, hairdressers and dressmakers in charge of costumes.

[In the movie,] El Topo rips apart the woman’s dress in a take that lasts 10 seconds.
  
It is followed by another take of El Topo [doing the same], but from a different angle.  Filming stopped for half an hour or so for the technicians to change the reflectors. That is to say that in order to shoot an action sequence that does not even last more than three minutes, several hours were needed. And it wasn’t just a single cameraman, but two cameras, each with one operator and four assistants. A total of 10 camera people. Added to this were crewmen placing rails where the camera slid, handling the counterweights of a crane, holding silver reflector cards so that each face is well-lit. There was also the assistant director, the group of set decorators, other actors, etc. A big crowd that the audience does not see.&amp;nbsp;In addition, there were people holding the individual umbrellas protecting the actors from the sun, others that delivered water and food, etc.

How could I have possibly assaulted the actress in front of such a large assembly of people? &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
At the slightest hint of any actual violence, a group of men and women would have thrown themselves at me and immobilized me. The actress would have also been defending herself, howling, scratching. And I, vile satyr, would have ended up persecuted, tried and imprisoned.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In regard to the making of ''El Topo'', Jodorowsky stated in the early 1970s:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When I wanted to do the rape scene, I explained to [Mara Lorenzio] that I was going to hit her and rape her. There was no emotional relationship between us, because I had put a clause in all the women's contracts stating that they would not make love with the director. We had never talked to each other. I knew nothing about her. We went to the desert with two other people: the photographer and a technician. No one else. I said, 'I'm not going to rehearse. There will be only one take because it will be impossible to repeat. Roll the cameras only when I signal you to.' Then I told her, 'Pain does not hurt. Hit me.' And she hit me. I said, 'Harder.' And she started to hit me very hard, hard enough to break a rib...I ached for a week. After she had hit me long enough and hard enough to tire her, I said, 'Now it's my turn. Roll the cameras.' And I really...I really...I really raped her. And she screamed ... Then she told me that she had been raped before. You see, for me the character is frigid until El Topo rapes her. And she has an orgasm. That's why I show a stone phallus in that scene ... which spouts water. She has an orgasm. She accepts the male sex. And that's what happened to Mara in reality. She really had that problem. Fantastic scene. A very, very strong scene.&lt;ref name="Crouse2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Crouse|title=Son of the 100 Best Movies You've Never Seen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B5alnowvF3sC&amp;pg=PT111|date=15 December 2010|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=978-1-55490-330-6|pages=111–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the documentary ''[[Jodorowsky's Dune]]'', Jodorowsky states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It's different. It was my Dune. When you make a picture, you must not respect the novel. It's like you get married, no? You go with the wife, white, the woman is white. You take the woman, if you respect the woman, you will never have child. You need to open the costume and to… to rape the bride. And then you will have your picture. I was raping Frank Herbert, raping, like this! But with love, with love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thewire.co.uk/in-writing/columns/alejandro-jodorowsky-38280|title=Alejandro Jodorowsky: never belonging|author=Daniel Spicer|date=August 2015|work=[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]|access-date=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As a result of these statements, Jodorowsky has been criticised.&lt;ref name=tor&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tor.com/2017/05/02/jodorowskys-dune-didnt-get-made-for-a-reason-and-we-should-all-be-grateful/|title=Jodorowsky's Dune Didn't Get Made for a Reason… and We Should All Be Grateful For That|website=''Tor.com''|author=Emily Asher-Perrin|date=2 May 2017|access-date=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=screenanarchy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenanarchy.com/2016/12/destroy-all-monsters-were-bad-at-confronting-news-like-the-bertolucci-news.html|title=Destroy All Monsters: We're Bad At Confronting News Like The Bertolucci News|author=Matt Brown|date=5 December 2016|website=[[Screen Anarchy]]|access-date=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matt Brown of [[Screen Anarchy]] wrote that "it's easier to wall off a certain type of criminality behind the buffer of time—sure, Alejandro Jodorowsky is on the record in his book on the making of the film as having raped Mara Lorenzo while making El Topo—though he later denied it—but nowadays he's just that hilarious old kook from Jodorowsky's Dune!"&lt;ref name=screenanarchy /&gt; Emily Asher-Perrin of Tor.com called Jodorowsky "an artist who condones rape as a means to an end for the purpose of creating art. A man who seems to believe that rape is something that women 'need' if they can't accept male sexual power on their own".&lt;ref name=tor /&gt; Sady Doyle of ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' wrote that Jodorowsky "has been teasing the idea of an unsimulated rape scene in his cult classic film ''El Topo'' for decades ...  though he's elsewhere described the unsimulated sex in that scene as consensual", and went on to state that the quote "has not endangered his status as an avant-garde icon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/a41293/bertolucci-abuse-art/|title=Bertolucci Wasn't the First Man to Abuse a Woman and Call It Art and He Won't Be the Last|author=Sady Doyle|work=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]|date=8 December 2016|access-date=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''All Ladakh Gonpa Association''' is the central organisation of the Buddhist monasteries in [[Ladakh]], [[India]]. It aims to preserve and strengthen the monastic institutions. It was founded by the [[19th Kushok Bakula Rinpoche]] in 1949 and he acted as its president for 41 years, from 1949 until 1991. In 1949, the first meeting of the great monasteries was held and ten monasteries took part. All Ladakh Gonpa Association was registered in 1959 and is run by a governing body consisting of fifteen lama members belonging to all four major schools of [[Tibetan Buddhism#Schools|Tibetan Buddhism]]. There are sixteen major monastic institutions with hundreds of monks in each monastery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ladakhkalachakra2014.com/all-ladakh-gonpa-association/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=16 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140921181326/http://ladakhkalachakra2014.com/all-ladakh-gonpa-association/ |archive-date=21 September 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Catholic Church hierarchy sidebar}}
An '''almoner''' is a chaplain or church officer who originally was in charge of distributing money to the deserving poor.  The title ''almoner'' has to some extent fallen out of use in English, but its equivalents in other languages are often used for many pastoral functions exercised by [[chaplain]]s or [[pastor]]s. The word derives from the {{lang-grc|ἐλεημοσύνη}} ''{{lang|grc|eleēmosynē}}'' (alms), via the [[popular Latin]] ''{{lang|la|almosinarius}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|almoner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2016}}

Christians have historically been encouraged to donate one tenth of their income as charity to the poor and the first deacons mentioned in Acts 6:1–4 dealt with the distribution of the charity of the early Christian churches to needy members. [[Popes]], [[Bishop]]s, and  Christian monarchs and organisations have since employed their own officers to organise their donations to the poor and needy. Such donations were referred to as alms and the officers as almoners and the position was one of considerable status.

==Roman Catholic Church==
{{Main|Papal almoner}}
The Papal almoner, formally titled the "Almoner of His Holiness", is a member of the [[papal household]] with responsibility for performing [[works of charity]] on behalf of the pope. He is one of a small number of [[Holy See|Vatican]] officials who continue in office [[Sede vacante|when a pope dies or resigns]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Universi Dominici gregis]]'', 22&lt;/ref&gt; Since late 2013, the holder of the title is [[Cardinal_(Catholic_Church)|Cardinal]] [[Konrad Krajewski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work = La Stampa | accessdate = 10 June 2017 | date = 6 August 2013 | url = http://www.lastampa.it/2013/08/06/vaticaninsider/eng/the-vatican/pope-tells-new-almoner-do-this-work-with-a-lot-of-imagination-TqADA31fgDYpB51HYsP4zH/pagina.html | first = Gerard | last = O'Connell | title= Pope tells new Almoner: 'Do this work with a lot of imagination' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UK Royal Household==
{{See also|Royal Almonry}}
Today in the United Kingdom, the office of [[Lord High Almoner]] still exists in the [[Royal Almonry|Royal Household]] and holder of the office is responsible amongst other things for organising the ceremony of the Queen's annual distribution of [[Maundy money]]. Associated with the Almoner's office is the Grand Almoner, an hereditary title in the hands of the [[Marquess of Exeter]].

==French Royal Household==
{{see|Grand Almoner of France}}
The position of almoner within the French royal household was that of [[Grand Almoner of France]] (''Grand aumônier de France'') created by King  [[Francis I of France|Francis I]].

==Livery Companies and Masonic Lodges==
The almoner also remains an active and important office in the [[livery companies]] of the [[City of London]]. In [[Masonic Lodge]]s, the almoner's duty is to oversee the needs of the Brethren within his Lodge. He is the contact for charity and looks after the welfare of the members, including visits to the sick, aged and infirm.

==Hospital almoners==
{{main|Medical social work#Britain and Ireland}}

The title almoner was also used for a hospital official who interviews prospective patients to qualify them as [[wikt:indigent|indigent]]. It was later applied to the officials who were responsible for patient welfare and after-care. This position evolved into the modern profession of [[medical social work]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=The First Lady Almoner: The Appointment, Position, and Findings of Miss Mary Stewart at the Royal Free Hospital, 1895–99|first=Lynsey T.|last=Cullen|journal=Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences|date=October 2013|volume=68|issue=4|pages=551–582|doi=10.1093/jhmas/jrs020|pmc=3792647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3971">The '''Ani-kutani''' (ᎠᏂᎫᏔᏂ) {{Refn | group = "lower-alpha" | {{IPAc-en|ɑː|ˈ|n|iː|k|uː|ˈ|t|ɑː|n|iː}}}} were the ancient priesthood of the [[Cherokee]] people.  According to Cherokee legend, the Ani-Kutani were slain during a mass uprising by the Cherokee people approximately 300 years prior to European contact.  This uprising was sparked by the fact that the Ani-Kutani had become corrupt and conducted sexual improprieties.&lt;ref name="Who Were the Aní-Kutánî?"&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=482712 |title=Who Were the Aní-Kutánî? An Excursion into Cherokee Historical Thought |deadurl=no |volume=31 |pages=255–263}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient structure of Cherokee Society and the [[Cherokee Clans]] were closely linked to the beliefs of the Ani-Kutani.

The Ani-Kutani might be connected to the Longhair Clan, or Anigilohi (ᎠᏂᎩᎶᎯ), or "fire priests" that existed in historic times. They were either a clerical class and/or a hereditary clan. "Aní-" is a prefix referring to a group of individuals, while the meaning of "kutáni" is unknown.&lt;ref name="Who Were the Aní-Kutánî?"/&gt;

==James Mooney's writings concerning the Ani-Kutani ==
From the writings of [[James Mooney]], ''Myths of the Cherokee,'' section 108 "The Massacre of the Ani'-Kuta'ni. "Among other perishing traditions is that relating to the Ani'Kuta'ni or Ani'Kwata'ni, concerning whom the modern Cherokee know so little that their very identity is now a matter of dispute, a few holding that they were an ancient people who preceded the Cherokee and built the mounds, while others, with more authority, claim that they were a clan or society in the tribe and were destroyed long ago by pestilence or other calamity."

The Ani'Kuta'ni most likely supervised all religious ceremonies among the Cherokee. They may have been [[moundbuilders]] who lived in the Appalachian lands in which Cherokees settled.&lt;ref name="Who Were the Aní-Kutánî?"/&gt;

Mooney's informants described this group as much despised, corrupt abusers of their religious power (Mooney compared this power position to be on par with the [[Brahmin]]s of India). Mooney stated they were so completely wiped out that even at the mention of them by [[Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation|Principal Chief]] [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]] and Dr J. B. Evans in 1866, the story and legend were stated to be a century old and must have (due to the dimness of detail) been even older than a century even then.

:"The people long brooded in silence over the oppressions and outrages of this high caste, whom they deeply hated but greatly feared. At length a daring young man, a member of an influential family, organized a conspiracy among the people for the massacre of the priesthood. The immediate provocation was the abduction of the wife of the young leader of the conspiracy. His wife was remarkable for her beauty, and was forcibly abducted and violated by one of the Nicotani while he was absent on the chase. On his return he found no difficulty in exciting in others the resentment which he himself experienced. So many had suffered in the same way, so many feared that they might be made to suffer, that nothing was wanted but a leader. A leader appearing in the person of the young brave whom we have named, the people rose under his direction and killed every Nicotani (Ni-go-ta-ni), young and old. Thus perished a hereditary secret society, since which time no hereditary privileges have been tolerated among the Cherokee'' (Mooney, p. 393).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3046">'''Asclepiad''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: Ἀσκληπιάδης, pl.: Ἀσκληπιάδαι) was a title borne by many [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] medical doctors, notably [[Hippocrates of Kos]]. It is not clear whether the Asclepiads were originally a biological family, or simply a member of an order or guild of doctors.

The Asclepiads may have originally been members of a family claiming descent from the god of healing [[Asclepius]], with the name only later being adopted by all doctors; or they may always have been an association of medical men venerating the god as their founder.&lt;ref&gt;Plinio Prioreschi, ''A History of Medicine: Greek Medicine'', Mellen History of Medicine, 1994, {{ISBN|0773496637}}, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;

Some hold that the Asclepiads were [[priest]]s of [[Asclepieion|Asclepion]].&lt;ref name=rutkow21&gt;{{Harvnb|Rutkow|1993|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Asclepiadae could also have been a guild in honour of [[Asclepius]], the Greek god of healing, separate from the healing temples and closely related to Hippocratic tradition.&lt;ref name="Plat"&gt;{{Harvnb|Jowett|1927|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plato gives Hippocrates this title in his ''Protagoras'', referring to him as “Hippocrates of Kos, the Asclepiad”.&lt;ref name="Plat" /&gt;  It may also have been used to refer to a group of people who claimed to be descended from Asclepius.&lt;ref name=jones39&gt;{{Harvnb|Jones|1868|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Asclepiades was the name of several [[Hellenistic]] physicians, some of whom probably assumed this appellation either as a sort of honorary title in allusion to the ancient family of the Asclepiadae, or in order to signify that they themselves belonged to it, or even just to indicate that they were proficient healers.

'''Baal Shem''' ({{IPA-he|ˈbaʕal ʃɛm}}, Hebrew: בַּעַל שֵׁם, pl. '''Baalei Shem''') in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] meaning "'''Master of the Name'''", refers to a historical Jewish occupation of certain [[kabbalistic]] [[rabbi]]s with knowledge of using [[names of God in Judaism]] for [[practical kabbalah]] healing, miracles,&lt;ref name=jewishencyclopedia&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/2249-ba-al-shem|title=Ba'al Shem|last1=Kohler|first1=Kaufmann|last2=Ginzberg|first2=Louis|publisher=[[JewishEncyclopedia.com]]|year=1906|accessdate=October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; exorcism&lt;ref name=Weiss&gt;''Studies in East European Jewish Mysticism and Hasidism'', Joseph Weiss, Littman Library: chapter 1 "Some Notes on the Social Background of Early Hasidism", chapter 2 "A Circle of [[Pneumatic (Gnosticism)|Pneumatics]] in Pre-Hasidism"&lt;/ref&gt; and blessing.

==History==
The unofficial title was given by others who recognised or benefited from the Baal Shem's ability to perform wondrous deeds, and emerged in the [[Middle Ages]], continuing until the [[early modern era]]. Baal Shem were seen as [[miracle]] workers who could bring about [[cures]] and [[healing]], as well having [[mysticism|mystical]] powers to foresee or interpret events and personalities. They were considered to have a "direct line" to [[Heaven]], evoking God's mercies and compassion on suffering human beings. In Jewish society, the [[practical Kabbalah|practical]] [[theurgic]] role of Baalei Shem among the common folk was a mystical institution, contrasted with the more [[Kabbalah|theosophical]] and [[Jewish meditation|ecstatic]] Kabbalistic study circles, which were isolated from the populace. The Baal Shem, the communal [[Maggid]] preacher and the Mokhiakh ((מוֹכִיחַ/preacher) of penitence were seen as lower level unofficial Jewish intelligentsia, below contract Rabbis and study Kabbalists.&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt;

The activity of Baalei Shem among the community, as well as the influence of kabbalistic ideas, contributed to the popular belief in [[Tzadikim Nistarim]] (Concealed Righteous). Hasidic tradition records [[Elijah Ba'al Shem of Chelm]] in the 16th century, founding a "Nistarim" mystical brotherhood to offer physical and spiritual encouragement to the Jewish populace, making him the first Baal Shem, and from which movement Hasidism later emerged.&lt;ref&gt;''Lubavitcher Rabbi's Memoires'', [[Joseph Isaac Schneersohn]], Kehot publications, 3 volumes&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hasidism==
A few people received the title of ''Baal Shem'' among Eastern and Central European [[Ashkenazi]] Jewry. The name is most well known in reference to the founder of [[Hasidic Judaism]], the ''[[Baal Shem Tov]]'' (''Besht'' – "Master of the Good Name") – Israel ben Eliezer (1698–1760) in [[Ukraine]]. However, this is misleading. The Baal Shem Tov started public life as a traditional ''Baal Shem'', but with his teachings of Hasidism, introduced a new way into mystical thought and practice. His role is distinguished from other, predominantly earlier, Baal Shem by the addition of ''Tov – Good'' to his title. Hasidism popularised esoteric Kabbalah into a social mysticism movement. The new mystical role of the Hasidic [[Tzadik]] [[Rebbe|leader]] replaced ''Baal Shem'' activity among the populace, combining Kabbalist and Maggid, and replacing practical kabbalah with the Tzadik's divine intercession. The 1814–15 ''[[Dov ben Samuel Baer|Praises of the Besht]]'' sets the Baal Shem Tov's teaching circle against his remaining occupation as travelling Baal Shem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hasidicstories.com/Articles/Background_and_Sources/rosman1.html Life Stories: Shivhei Ha-Besht] by Moshe Rosman, hasidicstories.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Two recent studies of the historical Baal Shem Tov: ''Founder of Hasidism: A Quest for the Historical Ba'al Shem Tov'', Moshe Rosman, California University 1996; ''[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=G7wzsY3NbrcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=iw&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true The Besht: Magician, Mystic, and Leader]'', Immanuel Etkes, Brandeis 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Name" referred to in "Master of the Name" is the most holy Four-Letter Name of God or [[Tetragrammaton]]. In Jewish tradition, this Name was pronounced only by the [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] on [[Yom Kippur]]. With the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] by the Romans in the year 70 CE, the true pronunciation was presumably lost. (Jews today do not pronounce the Name out loud and substitute another Hebrew word, usually [[Adonai]], in prayers and texts.) In some accounts, a Baal Shem was believed to have rediscovered the true pronunciation, perhaps during deep [[Jewish meditation|meditation]], and could use it in magical ways to work miracles. Some stories say he pronounced it out loud, and others say he visualized the Name in his mind. He also used the names of [[angels]] in such a way.

===Amulets and Practical Kabbalah===
{{Main|Practical Kabbalah}}
[[File:Kesavyismach1.jpg|thumb|150px|right|A Jewish [[amulet]], consisting of various Divine Names, attributed to the Hasidic Rabbi, [[Moshe Teitelbaum (Ujhel)|Moshe Teitelbaum]] (1759–1841).]]
There are two differentiated streams in Kabbalah, that leading Kabbalists separated over concerns of illegitimate use of Practical Kabbalah:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inner.org/kabbalah/beginner/practical.htm What is Practical Kabbalah?] from www.inner.org&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Kabbalah Iyunit'', "Contemplative Kabbalah" ([[Kabbalah|Theosophical]]-[[Jewish meditation|Meditative]])
*''Kabbalah Ma'asit'', "[[Practical Kabbalah]]" (Seeking to alter Nature in holiness)
The leading Kabbalist [[Isaac Luria]] (1534–1572) forbade people of his time to use Practical Kabbalah. As the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] is not standing, and no one possesses the ashes of the [[Red Heifer]], people are unable to become pure. Without those things, he said, Practical Kabbalah is very damaging. [[Yitzchak Ginsburgh]] describes the connection of Jewish [[amulets]] to Practical Kabbalah:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Amulets are on the border between Practical Kabbalah and an external manifestation of Kabbalah, such as name calculation. There is a source for amulets in the [[Torah]]. When a great sage writes Holy Names, without pronouncing them, on parchment and puts it into a container which is worn by the recipient, it can possess healing and spiritual powers. At the beginning of the [[Baal Shem Tov]]'s life, since he was a healer, he used amulets. Sometimes the amulet works because of the faith of the recipient in the spiritual power of the amulet. At the end of his life, the Baal Shem Tov never wrote the Names of God, only his own signature, Yisrael ben Sara or Yisrael ben Eliezer. This was the ultimate amulet given by the Ba'al Shem Tov.&lt;br /&gt;

The [[Chazal|Sages]] teach us that whoever receives a coin from the hands of [[Job (Biblical figure)|Job]] (a [[tzadik]]) receives a blessing. This is the source in the [[Talmud]] that receiving a coin from a great tzaddik brings with it a blessing. Thus we see that there are amulets that are permissible. The determining factor is the righteousness and intentions of the person giving the amulet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inner.org/kabbalah/beginner/amulets.htm Are Amulets Considered Practical Kabbalah?

==Hasidic replacement of the ''Baal Shem''==
{{Main|Tzadik}}

==Contemporary legacies==
The name "Baal Shem" mainly survives in Jewish surnames of people descending from ''Ba'ale Shem'' such as ''Balshem'', ''Balshemnik'' and ''Bolshemennikov''.

In recent years, some [[new age]] Jewish groups have revived the term as referring to the Jewish equivalent of a [[shaman]] or folk healer.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

[[File:Frans Hogenberg Bildersturm 1566.jpg|thumb|360px|Print of the destruction in the [[Cathedral of Our Lady (Antwerp)|Church of Our Lady in Antwerp]], the "signature event" of the Beeldenstorm, August 20, 1566, by [[Frans Hogenberg]]&lt;ref&gt;analysed in Arnade, 146 (quoted); see also [http://www.learner.org/courses/globalart/work/155/index.html Art through time]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''''Beeldenstorm''''' in Dutch, roughly translatable to "statue storm", or '''''Bildersturm''''' in German ("image/statue storm"), also the '''Great Iconoclasm''' or '''Iconoclastic Fury''', is a term used for outbreaks of destruction of religious images that occurred in Europe in the 16th century. During these spates of [[iconoclasm]], Catholic art and many forms of church fittings and decoration were destroyed in unofficial or mob actions by [[Calvinist]]{{dubious|date=June 2018}} Protestant crowds as part of the [[Protestant Reformation]].&lt;ref name="Marshall2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Byfield2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Byfield|first=Ted|title=A Century of Giants, A.D. 1500 to 1600: In an Age of Spiritual Genius, Western Christendom Shatters|year=2002|publisher=Christian History Project|language=English|isbn=9780968987391|page=297|quote=Devoutly Catholic but opposed to Inquisition tactics, they backed William of Orange in subduing the Calvinist uprising of the Dutch beeldenstorm on behalf of regent Margaret of Parma, and had come willingly to the council at her invitation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the destruction was of art in churches and public places.&lt;ref name="Kleiner2010"/&gt;

The Dutch term usually specifically refers to the wave of disorderly attacks in the summer of 1566 that spread rapidly through the [[Low Countries]] from south to north. Similar outbreaks of iconoclasm took place in other parts of Europe, especially [[Reformation in Switzerland|in Switzerland]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in the period between 1522 and 1566, notably [[Zürich]] (in 1523), [[Copenhagen]] (1530), [[Münster]] (1534), [[Geneva]] (1535), and [[Augsburg]] (1537).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;John Phillips, ''Reformation of Images: Destruction of Art in England, 1535–1660'', (Berkeley: University of California Press) 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

In England there was both government-sponsored removal of images and also spontaneous attacks from 1535 onwards, and in [[Scotland]] from 1559.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In France there were several outbreaks as part of the [[French Wars of Religion]] from 1560 onwards.

==Background==
In France unofficial episodes of large scale destruction of art in churches by [[Huguenot]] Calvinists had begun in 1560; unlike in the Low Countries they were often physically resisted and repulsed by Roman Catholic crowds, but were to continue throughout the [[French Wars of Religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Eire, 279–280&lt;/ref&gt; In Anglican England much destruction had already taken place in an organized fashion under orders from the government,&lt;ref name="Buchanan2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Buchanan|first=Colin|title=The A to Z of Anglicanism|date=4 August 2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|language=English|isbn=9780810870086|page=26|quote=Royal Injunctions order the reading of biblical passages in English at the mass, along with the destruction of images and the provision of a “poor men's box” for alms.}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in Northern Europe, groups of Calvinists marched through churches and removed images, a move which "provoked reactive riots by Lutheran mobs" in Germany and "antagonized the neighbouring Eastern Orthodox" in the Baltic region.&lt;ref name="Marshall2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Peter|title=The Reformation|date=22 October 2009|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|language=English|isbn=9780191578885|page=114|quote=Iconoclastic incidents during the Calvinist 'Second Reformation' in Germany provoked reactive riots by Lutheran mobs, while Protestant image-breaking in the Baltic region deeply antagonized the neighbouring Eastern Orthodox, a group with whom reformers might have hoped to make common cause.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lamport|first=Mark A.|title=Encyclopedia of Martin Luther and the Reformation|date=31 August 2017|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|language=English|isbn=9781442271593|page=138|quote=Lutherans continued to worship in pre-Reformation churches, generally with few alterations to the interior. It has even been suggested that in Germany to this day one finds more ancient Marian altarpieces in Lutheran than in Catholic churches. Thus in Germany and in Scandinavia many pieces of medieval art and architecture survived. Joseph Leo Koerner has noted that Lutherans, seeing themselves in the tradition of the ancient, apostolic church, sought to defend as well as reform the use of images. "An empty, white-washed church proclaimed a wholly spiritualized cult, at odds with Luther's doctrine of Christ's real presence in the sacraments" (Koerner 2004, 58). In fact, in the 16th century some of the strongest opposition to destruction of images came not from Catholics but from Lutherans against Calvinists: "You black Calvinist, you give permission to smash our pictures and hack our crosses; we are going to smash you and your Calvinist priests in return" (Koerner 2004, 58). Works of art continued to be displayed in Lutheran churches, often including an imposing large crucifix in the sanctuary, a clear reference to Luther's ''theologia crucis''. ... In contrast, Reformed (Calvinist) churches are strikingly different. Usually unadorned and somewhat lacking in aesthetic appeal, pictures, sculptures, and ornate altar-pieces are largely absent; there are few or no candles; and crucifixes or crosses are also mostly absent.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, Switzerland and England, conversion to Protestantism had been enforced on the whole population at the level of a city, principality or kingdom, with varying degrees of discrimination, persecution or expulsion applied to those who insisted on remaining Roman Catholic. The Low Countries, Flanders, [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and [[Holland]],&lt;ref&gt;What is now approximately [[Limburg (Belgium)|Belgian Limburg]] was part of the [[Bishopric of Liège]] and ruled by the bishop (shown in brown on the map).&lt;/ref&gt; were part of the inheritance of [[Philip II of Spain]], who was a devout Catholic and self-proclaimed protector of the [[Counter-Reformation]], and [[suppression of dissent|suppressed]] Protestantism through his Governor-general or Regent, [[Margaret of Parma]] the illegitimate daughter of [[Emperor Charles V]], who was herself more willing to compromise. Although Protestants so far represented only a relatively small proportion of the Netherlandish population, but including disproportionate numbers from the nobility and upper [[bourgeoisie]], the Catholic Church had evidently lost the loyalty of the population, and traditional Catholic [[anti-clericalism]] was now dominant.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, 90–91&lt;/ref&gt;

The region affected was perhaps the richest in Europe, but still seethed with economic discontent among parts of the population, and had suffered a poor harvest and hard winter. However, recent historians are generally less inclined to see the movement as prompted by these factors than was the case a few decades ago.&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 95–98, and 116, especially note 105 (where "reputation" is presumably a misprint for "refutation"). Elliott, 89–91, first written in 1968, reflects a version of the older view, for which the German Marxist historian Erich Kuttner was the standard-bearer.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pollmann, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DPGMstg0fosC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;dq=iconoclasm+Beeldenstorm&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=OstrTdHyEMKKhQeUmsygDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=iconoclasm%20Beeldenstorm&amp;f=false 179-80].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Die Predigt Johannes des Täufers (Bruegel).jpg|thumb|400px|An outdoor sermon (''The Preaching of St. John the Baptist'') depicted by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], apparently in 1565, the year before the Beeldenstorm movement began.]]
The Beeldenstorm grew out of a turn in the behaviour of Low Country Protestants starting around 1560, who became increasingly open in their religion, despite penal sanctions. Catholic preachers were interrupted in sermons, and raids were organized to rescue Protestant prisoners from jail, who then often fled into exile in France or England. Protestant views were spread by a large movement of "field sermons" or open-air sermons ({{lang-nl|hagepreken}}) held outside towns, and therefore out of the jurisdiction of the town authorities. The first took place on the ''Cloostervelt'' near [[Hondschoote]], in what is now the [[arrondissement of Dunkirk]] in [[French Flanders]], very close to where the attacks later began, and the first one to be armed against disruption was held near [[Boeschepe]] on July 12, 1562, two months after religious war had broken out again over the (then) French border just nearby.&lt;ref&gt;Petegree, 74–75&lt;/ref&gt;

These open-air sermons, mostly by [[Anabaptist]] or [[Mennonite]] preachers, spread through the country, attracting huge crowds, though not necessarily of those leaning to Protestantism, and in many places immediately preceded the iconoclastic attacks of August 1566. Prosecutions for [[heresy]] continued, especially in the south, although they were erratic, and in some places clergy of clearly heretical views{{Which|date=October 2017}} were appointed to churches. By 1565 the authorities seem to have realized that persecution was not the answer, and the level of prosecutions slackened, and the Protestants became increasingly confident in the open.&lt;ref&gt;Petegree, 82–86&lt;/ref&gt; A letter of July 22, 1566, from local officials to the Regent, warned that "the scandalous pillage of churches, monasteries and abbeys" was imminent.&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 97&lt;/ref&gt;

==Low Countries iconoclastic attacks in 1566==
[[File:Tachtigjarigeoorlog-1566.png|thumb|300px|Blue: The spread of the Beeldenstorm in the Low Countries. Brown: Within the independent [[Bishopric of Liège]].]]

On August 10, 1566, the [[feast-day]] of [[Saint Lawrence]], at the end of the [[pilgrimage]] from Hondschoote to [[Steenvoorde]], the chapel of the ''Sint-Laurensklooster'' was defaced by a crowd who invaded the building. It has been suggested that the rioters connected the saint especially with Philip II, whose monastery palace of the [[Escorial]] near [[Madrid]] was dedicated to Lawrence, and was just nearing completion in 1566.&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 103–104&lt;/ref&gt; Iconoclastic attacks spread rapidly northwards and resulted in the destruction of not only images but all sorts of decoration and fittings in churches and other church or clergy property. However, there was relatively little loss of life, unlike similar outbreaks in France, where the clergy were often killed, and some iconoclasts too.&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 116&lt;/ref&gt;

The attacks reached the commercial centre of the Low Countries, Antwerp, on August 20, and on August 22 Ghent, where the cathedral, eight churches, twenty-five monasteries and convents, ten hospitals and seven chapels were wrecked. From there, it further spread east and north, reaching [[Amsterdam]], then a much smaller town, by August 23, and continuing in the far north and east into October, although the main towns were mostly attacked in August. [[Valenciennes]] ("Valencijn" on the map) was the most southerly town attacked. In the east, [[Maastricht]] on September 20 and [[Venlo]] on October 5 saw attacks, but generally the outbreaks were restricted to more westerly and northern areas.&lt;ref&gt;See map with dates in Petegree, 118; Arnade, 90–91&lt;/ref&gt; Over 400 churches were attacked in Flanders alone.&lt;ref&gt;Eire, 280&lt;/ref&gt;

The eye-witness [[Richard Clough]], a Welsh Protestant merchant then in Antwerp, saw: "all the churches, chapels and houses of religion utterly defaced, and no kind of thing left whole within them, but broken and utterly destroyed, being done after such order and by so few folks that it is to be marvelled at." The [[Cathedral of Our Lady (Antwerp)|Church of Our Lady in Antwerp]], later made the cathedral (illustrated at top): "looked like a hell, with above 10,000 torches burning, and such a noise as if heaven and earth had got together, with falling of images and beating down of costly works, such sort that the spoil was so great that a man could not well pass through the church. So that in fine [short], I cannot write you in x sheets of paper the strange sight I saw there, organs and all destroyed."&lt;ref&gt;Spicer, 109 (spelling modernized); see also Arnade, 146–148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dutchrevolt.leiden.edu/english/sources/Pages/15660721.aspx Eye-witness Account of Image-breaking at Antwerp], Universiteit Leiden {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120709173750/http://dutchrevolt.leiden.edu/english/sources/Pages/15660721.aspx |date=2012-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicolas Sander, an English Catholic exile who was a professor of theology at [[Old University of Louvain|Louvain]], described the destruction in the same church:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;these fresh followers of this new preaching threw down the graven [sculpted] and defaced the painted images, not only of Our Lady but of all others in the town. They tore the curtains, dashed in pieces the carved work of brass and stone, brake the altars, spoilt the clothes and corporesses, wrested the irons, conveyed away or brake the chalices and vestiments, pulled up the brass of the gravestones, not sparing the glass and seats which were made about the pillars of the church for men to sit in.&amp;nbsp;... the [[Blessed Sacrament]] of the altar&amp;nbsp;... they trod under their feet and (horrible it is to say!) shed their stinking piss upon it&amp;nbsp;... these false bretheren burned and rent not only all kind of Church books, but, moreover, destroyed whole libraries of books of all sciences and tongues, yea the Holy Scriptures and the [[church Fathers|ancient fathers]], and tore in pieces the maps and charts of the descriptions of countries.&lt;ref&gt;Miola, 58–59, 59 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:UtrechtIconoclasm.jpg|thumb|250px|Damaged relief statues in the [[Cathedral of Saint Martin, Utrecht]].]]
Such details are corroborated by many other sources. Accounts of the actions of the iconoclasts from eyewitnesses and the records of the later trials of many of them make it clear that there was often a considerable element of [[carnival]] to the outbreaks, with much mockery of the images and fittings such as fonts recorded as the iconoclasts went about their work. Alcohol features largely in very many accounts, perhaps in some cases because in Netherlandish law being drunk could be regarded as a mitigating factor in criminal sentencing.&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 105–111&lt;/ref&gt;

The destruction frequently included ransacking the priest's house, and sometimes private houses suspected of sheltering church goods. There was much looting of common household goods from clergy houses and monasteries, and some street robberies of women's jewellery by the crowd; after the images were smashed and the property occupied, "men fed their stomachs in a carnivalesque indulgence of beer, bread, butter and cheese, while women carted off provisions for the kitchen or bedroom".&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 111–112 (quote from 112); 102 for women's jewellery robbed.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many accounts of rituals of inversion, in which the church sometimes stood for the whole social order. Children sometimes participated enthusiastically, and street games afterwards became play battles between "[[papist]]s" and "[[Geuzen|beggars]]". One child was killed in Amsterdam by a stone thrown in such a game.&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 111–114; for the whole paragraph: 104–122&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere the iconoclasts seemed to treat their actions as a job of work; in one city the group waited for the bell rung to mark the start of the working day before beginning their work. The tombs and memorial inscriptions of the [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patriciate]] and nobility, and in some cases royalty, were defaced or destroyed in several places, although secular public buildings such as town halls, and the palaces of the nobility, were not attacked.&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 116–124&lt;/ref&gt; In Ghent, on the one hand the memorial in a church to Charles V's sister Isabel (and so Philip's aunt) was carefully left alone, but a statue in the street of Charles V and the Virgin was destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 119–120&lt;/ref&gt;

The actions were controversial among Protestants, some of whom implausibly tried to blame Catholic [[agent provocateur]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Petegree, 117–119&lt;/ref&gt; as it became clear that "the more popular elements of the dissident movement were out of control".&lt;ref&gt;Wells, 91&lt;/ref&gt; Protestant ministers and activists returning from exile in England and elsewhere played a significant role, and individual wealthy Protestants were widely suspected of hiring men to do the work in some places, especially Antwerp.&lt;ref&gt;Petegree, 116–117, and elsewhere, on returning exiles; Arnade, 146–147 on paid iconoclasts&lt;/ref&gt;

In some rural areas gangs of iconoclasts moved across country between village churches and monasteries for several days.&lt;ref name="Kleiner2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleiner|first=Fred S.|title=Gardner's Art through the Ages: A Concise History of Western Art|date=1 January 2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|language=English |isbn=9781424069224|page=254|quote=In an episode known as the Great Iconoclasm, bands of Calvinists visited Catholic churches in the Netherlands in 1566, shattering stained-glass windows, smashing statues, and destroying paintings and other artworks they perceived as idolatrous.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 101–102; 104–109&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere there were large crowds involved, sometimes locals, and sometimes from outside the area. In some places the nobility gave assistance, ordering the clearing of churches on their estates. Local magistracies were often opposed, but ineffective in stopping the destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Petegree, 119–124; Arnade, 120–122&lt;/ref&gt; In many towns the archer's guild, who had a function in controlling public order, took no steps against the crowds.&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 120&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1566, unlike the situation after the [[Eighty Years War]] and today, Protestantism in the Low Countries was mainly concentrated in the south (roughly modern [[Belgium]]), and much weaker in the north (roughly now the [[Netherlands]]), and iconoclasm in the north began later, after news of the events in Antwerp was received, and was more successfully resisted by local authorities in some towns, although still succeeding in most.&lt;ref name="Brouwer2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brouwer|first=Maria|title=Governmental Forms and Economic Development: From Medieval to Modern Times|date=11 August 2016|publisher=Springer|language=English|isbn=9783319420400|page=224|quote=The city of Amsterdam pursued a policy of restraint against the Calvinists. The iconoclast movement reached Amsterdam in August 1566, but the city government had moved and stored away many church possessions before the iconoclasts reached the city. All churches were closed to tame the fury.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once again individually socially prominent laymen often took the lead.&lt;ref&gt;Petegree, 124–128&lt;/ref&gt; In many places there were, or were later said to have been, false claims of official commissions from some local authority to perform the actions, and by the end of the outbreak some northern towns removed images by order of the local authority, presumably to prevent the disorder that would accompany a mob action.&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 120–122&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis of the records of the later trials show a wide range of occupations, covering craftsmen and small tradespeople, especially in the textile trade, and also a variety of church employees, at a fairly low level. Where wealth and property are recorded, it is "modest at best".&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 102&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Stille beeldenstorm" of 1581 in Antwerp==
Following the 1566 attacks in Antwerp there was a further period of iconoclasm there in 1581, after a Calvinist city council was elected and purged the city's clergy and guilds of Catholic office-holders. This is known as the "quiet" or "stille" beeldenstorm, as the removal of images was carried out by the institutions they belonged to, the council itself, churches and the guilds. Some images were sold rather than destroyed, but most seem to have been lost. By the summer of 1584 Antwerp was [[Fall of Antwerp|besieged by the Duke of Parma's Spanish army]], falling a year later.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 133&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic losses==
[[File:Le Sac de Lyon par les Réformés - Vers1565.jpg|thumb|300px|The looting of the Churches of Lyon by Calvinists in 1562.]]
Rarely was any thought given to the artistic heritage of these cities in 1566, though families were sometimes able to protect the [[church monument]]s of their ancestors, and in [[Delft]] the syndics of the painters' [[Guild of Saint Luke]] were able to rescue the altarpiece by [[Maarten van Heemskerck]], which the guild had commissioned only 15 years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Montias, 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[van Eyck]]s' [[Ghent Altarpiece]], then as now famous as a supreme example of [[Early Netherlandish painting]] and already a major tourist attraction, just restored in 1550, was saved by dismantling it and hiding it in the cathedral tower. A first attack on August 19 was deterred by a small number of guards. When a larger attack was made at night two days later the iconoclasts had provided themselves with a tree trunk as a battering ram, and succeeded in breaking through the doors.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Charney, 72–73 - a populist account; when he says April he means August, and "The Lamb" refers to the altarpiece. Petegree, 118 has the Beeldenstorm reaching Ghent on August 22. See also Arnade, 118&lt;/ref&gt;

By then the panels had been removed from the frame and hidden, with the guards, on the narrow spiral staircase up the tower, with a locked door at ground level. They were not detected and the crowd left after destroying what else they could find.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The panels were then moved to the town hall, and only returned to view in 1569, by which time the elaborate frame had disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e0X5lErg2tsC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=iconoclasm+%22Ghent+altarpiece%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gNJpTbjeIoiGhQedwbCfDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Early Netherlandish Paintings: Rediscovery, Reception and Research|first1=Bernhard|last1=Ridderbos|first2=Henk Th van|last2=Veen|first3=Anne van|last3=Buren|date=25 March 2018|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite militia guards, two of the three main churches in [[Leiden]] were attacked; in the [[Pieterskerk, Leiden|Pieterskerk]] the choirbooks and altarpiece by [[Lucas van Leyden]] were preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pieterskerk.com/en/explore/16e-eeuw/1566/|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120910114711/http://www.pieterskerk.com/en/explore/16e-eeuw/1566/|deadurl=yes|title=Iconoclasm - Pieterskerk Leiden|date=10 September 2012|archivedate=10 September 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Oude Kerk (Amsterdam)|Oude Kerk]] in Amsterdam an altarpiece with a central panel by [[Jan van Scorel]] and side panels painted on both sides by Maarten van Heemskerck was lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=46VdllfOUIUC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=art+destroyed+in+1566&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=OZhuTfauM8y7hAfdtI2qBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=art+destroyed+in+1566&amp;f=false|title=Northern Renaissance Art, 1400-1600: Sources and Documents|first=Wolfgang|last=Stechow|date=25 March 1966|publisher=Northwestern University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important works of several painters, especially those like [[Pieter Aertsen]] who worked in Antwerp,&lt;ref&gt;[[Gustav Friedrich Waagen]], [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3JIZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA232&amp;dq=Iconoclasm+1566&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=jBXZSZTZKpWQMqKfgLoB#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; were all destroyed, leading to a somewhat distorted view of the art history of the period. An altarpiece in [[Culemborg]] had been commissioned in 1557 from the painter Jan Dey, was then destroyed in 1566 and in 1570 recommissioned from Dey, apparently as a copy of the first. However the new work was only in place for five years before it was removed when the town went officially Calvinist.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Lynn F., review of Liesbeth M.

==Consequences==
[[File:Kreuz von stadelhofen.jpg|thumb|300px|Later depiction of the destruction of a wayside cross in [[Zurich]] in 1523.]]
On August 23, [[Margaret of Parma]], the Habsburg Regent or Governor-general, whose capital of [[Brussels]] was unaffected by the movement, agreed to an "Accord" with the group of aristocratic Protestant leaders known as the "Compromise" or ''[[Geuzen]]'' ("Beggars"), by which freedom of religion was granted, in exchange for allowing Catholics to worship unmolested and an end to the violence. Instead, "the outbreak of the iconoclastic fury began an almost uninterrupted series of skirmishes, campaigns, plunder, pirate-raids, and other acts of violence. Not all areas suffered violence at the same time or to the same extent, but practically none remained unscathed."&lt;ref&gt;Lesger, 110&lt;/ref&gt;

Many elite Protestants were now alarmed by the forces unleashed, and some of the nobility began to shift towards support of the government. Implementing the somewhat vague terms of the agreement led to further tensions, and [[William the Silent|William of Orange]], appointed by Margaret to resolve the situation in Antwerp, tried and failed to produce a wider settlement that all parties could live with. Instead unrest continued and the episode fed into the [[causes of the Dutch Revolt]] which was to erupt two years later.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, 91–93; Petegree, 132–134; Wells, 89–91; Arnade, 100&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 29 Margaret wrote a somewhat panicked letter to Philip, "claiming that half the population were infected with heresy, and that over 200,000 people were up in arms against her authority".&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JxK_O5IclRIC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=Iconoclasm+1566&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=jBXZSZTZKpWQMqKfgLoB#v=onepage&amp;q=Iconoclasm+1566&amp;f=false|title=Immigrants and the Industries of London, 1500-1700|first=Liên|last=Luu|date=25 March 2018|publisher=Ashgate|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philip decided to send the [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]] with an army; he would have led them himself but was kept in Spain by other matters, especially the increasingly evident insanity of his heir, [[Carlos, Prince of Asturias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hXK2fxzn2lAC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=iconoclasm+Beeldenstorm&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LzNrTefmAYa4hAeRtOjsDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=iconoclasm+Beeldenstorm&amp;f=false|title=The Political Thought of the Dutch Revolt 1555-1590|first=Martin van|last=Gelderen|date=3 October 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Alba arrived the following year, and soon replaced Margaret as Governor-general, his heavy-handed repression, which included the execution of many convicted of iconoclastic attacks the summer before, only made the situation worse.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

Antwerp was then Europe's largest financial and international trading centre, taking as much as 75 or 80% of English exports of cloth,&lt;ref&gt;Ramsay, 62–63&lt;/ref&gt; and the disturbances created serious and well-justified fears that its position as such was under threat. Sir [[Thomas Gresham]], the English financier who arranged [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s borrowings, and whose agent in Antwerp was Clough, left London for Antwerp on August 23, only hearing about the Antwerp attacks ''en route''; he needed to roll-over 32,000 Flemish pounds and borrow another 20,000 to finance her expenses in Ireland. Dining with William of Orange on his arrival, he was asked if "the English were minded to depart this town or not", and wrote to [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]], Elizabeth's chief minister, "in alarm that he "liked none of their proceedings" but "apprehended great mischief", and urged that the English government "should do very well in time to consider some other realm and place" for marketing English products. It was a message that helped shape the course of events."&lt;ref&gt;Ramsay, 50&lt;/ref&gt;

The English had found the Antwerp [[money market]] short of funds since earlier in the year, and now made use of [[Cologne]] and [[Augsburg]] as well, but as events unfolded in the next year, and the personal position of some leading lenders became precarious, the English found to their surprise that repayments were no longer pressed for, probably as the lenders were happy to keep their money abroad on loan to a secure borrower.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsay, 50–51&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch Revolt, which from 1585 onwards included a Dutch blockade of the River [[Scheldt]] leading to the city, was to finally destroy Antwerp as a major trading centre.

[[File:Dirck van Delen - Beeldenstorm in een kerk.jpg|thumb|300px|The painting ''Beeldenstorm in een kerk'', 1630, by [[Dirck van Delen]], six decades after the original actions.]]
In many places there were attempts by Calvinist preachers to take over the ransacked buildings. These were usually repulsed in the period after the attacks. In the months afterwards there were attempted negotiations in many cities, by William of Orange and others, to allocate certain churches to accommodate the local Protestants, often divided into [[Lutheran]]s and Calvinists. These had mostly failed within a few weeks, not least because Margaret's government rejected them; she had already had an earlier attempt at compromise overruled by Philip a few months earlier, and been embarrassingly forced to retract a decree.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsay, 48&lt;/ref&gt; Instead there was a wave of building or adapting Calvinist "temples", though in the end none of these were to remain in use by the following year, and their layouts, which seem to have echoed early Swiss and Scottish Calvinist designs, are now largely unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Spicer, 110–118&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the revolt proper had started, there were many further instances of clearing churches, some still unofficial and disorderly, but as cities became officially Protestant, increasingly undertaken by official order, like the Amsterdam [[Alteratie]] ("Alteration") of 1578. Altars, to which Calvinists, unlike Lutherans, took strong exception, were typically completely removed, and in some large churches, like Utrecht Cathedral, large tomb monuments put where they stood, partly to make their return more difficult if political conditions changed. After the Eighty Years War was finally over, in the cities and areas that became Protestant, the old Catholic churches were all or nearly all taken over by the new [[established church]] of the Calvinist [[Dutch Reformed Church]], with other congregations left to shift for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Spicer, 116–124, and following pages&lt;/ref&gt;

The bare and empty state of those churches left in Catholic hands after the hostilities eventually ended prompted a large programme of restocking with Catholic art, which had much to do with the vigour of [[Northern Mannerism]] and later [[Flemish Baroque painting]], and many Gothic churches were given [[Baroque]] makeovers.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 4, 13&lt;/ref&gt; In the north, now very largely Protestant, religious art largely disappeared, and [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] concentrated on a wide range of secular subjects, such as [[genre painting]], [[landscape art]] and [[still-life]]s, with results that might sometimes have surprised the Protestant ministers who initiated the movement. According to one scholar, this "was not only a dramatic change in the function of art, it was the context in which our present concept of art, what the literary critic [[M. H. Abrams]] called "art as such", first began to take shape", replacing a "construction model" where art theory concerned itself with how the maker created his work, with a "contemplation model" concerned with the effect of the finished work on a "lone perceiver" or viewer.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner (short quotes from Abrams), 131&lt;/ref&gt;

Deeply influenced by the writing of [[Edward Bellamy]], Willard is best remembered as a principal in several [[utopian socialism|utopian socialist]] enterprises, including the late 1890s colonization efforts of the [[Brotherhood of the Cooperative Commonwealth]] (BCC).

==Biography==

===Early years===

Cyrus Field Willard was born August 17, 1858 in [[Lynn, Massachusetts]], a member of a family of six children.&lt;ref name=Trahair&gt;Richard C.S. Trahair (ed.), "Cyrus Field Willard," in ''Utopias and Utopians: An Historical Dictionary.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1999; pg. ???.&lt;/ref&gt; The Willard family moved from Lynn to [[Boston]] in 1866, where Cyrus attended [[state school|public school]] before gaining employment as a newspaper reporter for the ''[[Boston Globe]].''&lt;ref name=Trahair /&gt;

In addition to working as a journalist, Willard contributed occasional pieces to the periodical press, including a humorous 1887 interview with poet [[Walt Whitman]], "A Chat with the Good Grey Poet," published in ''The American Magazine.''&lt;ref&gt;"The December Century," ''Brooklyn Daily Eagle,'' vol. 47, no. 332 (Dec. 1, 1887), pg. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Willard had a wide circle of political friends and acquaintances and maintained correspondence with prominent figures of the English and American [[socialism|socialist]] and [[anarchism|anarchist]] movements, including [[William Morris]], [[Sidney Webb]], [[Benjamin R. Tucker]], and [[Peter Kropotkin]].&lt;ref name=Warnke131&gt;Charles Pierce LeWarne, ''Utopias on Puget Sound, 1885–1915.'' [1975] Second Printing. Seattle, WA: University of Washington Press, 1995; pg. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Willard was additionally fluent in [[German language|German]], which enabled him to attend socialist meetings in the Boston area conducted in that language.&lt;ref&gt;LeWarne, ''Utopias on Puget Sound,'' pp. 131-132.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nationalist===
[[File:Looking Backward.jpg|thumb|right|Willard was deeply influenced by Edward Bellamy's 1888 utopian novel ''Looking Backward,'' and spent more than a decade after its publication working as a socialist activist.]]

In 1888 writer [[Edward Bellamy]] published the book ''[[Looking Backward|Looking Backward: 2000–1887]],'' a best-selling work of utopian fiction which depicted a futuristic American society of coordinated production and ameliorated social problems. Although the book sold slowly following its initial release in January 1888, Cyrus Field Willard was one of the first to read the novel, published  as it was in his hometown of Boston.&lt;ref name=Melton297&gt;J. Gordon Melton, "The Theosophical Communities and Their Ideal of Universal Brotherhood," in Donald E. Pitzer (ed.), ''America's Communal Utopias.'' Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 1997; pg. 397.&lt;/ref&gt; A correspondence with Bellamy ensued, in which Willard suggested the possibility of establishing a network of local political groups to attempt to put Bellamy's fictional vision of the future into practical existence.&lt;ref name=Melton297 /&gt;

This idea was independently shared by another Boston journalist Sylvester Baxter, who similarly wrote to Bellamy with his concept.&lt;ref name=Melton297 /&gt; The pair were put into contact with one another and on December 1, 1888, an organizational meeting was held for what would be the first in a vast array of [[Nationalist Clubs]].&lt;ref name=Melton297 /&gt; Willard as a co-founder of the Nationalist Club No. 1 became the group's Secretary.&lt;ref name=LeWarne132 /&gt;

From the outset Willard was deeply involved in attempts to build a broad Nationalist movement from coast to coast, contributing a regular column to the official organ of the group, the magazine ''[[The Nationalist (United States)|The Nationalist]].''&lt;ref name=Trahair /&gt; Willard was for a time from Bellamy and the Nationalist movement, hurt by his refusal to assume a leading role at ''The Nationalist'' and his subsequent decision to start instead a new weekly newspaper called ''[[New Nation (United States)|The New Nation]],'' making use of the financially failing magazine's subscriber list to build his own circulation.&lt;ref name=Lipow&gt;Arthur Lipow, ''Authoritarian Socialism in America: Edward Bellamy and the Nationalist Movement.'' Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1982; pp. 253-254.&lt;/ref&gt; Willard lamented that Bellamy had abandoned "his truest friends" so as to "play at politics" with his Boston rivals [[Mason Green]] and [[Henry R. Legate]], the latter of whom Willard believed to be a "corrupt politician."&lt;ref name=Lipow /&gt;

Bellamy's foray into independent publishing would prove to be a short one, with his paper forced to terminate in 1894, with the Nationalist movement falling to pieces. Even after the demise of the movement proper, however, Willard maintained close relations with the author who had inspired it, attempting to bring the ill-and-dying Bellamy into the fold of the emerging American socialist movement.&lt;ref name=LeWarne132 /&gt;

===Socialist===

In 1897, Willard became active in the [[Social Democracy of America]] and the closely related [[Brotherhood of the Cooperative Commonwealth]] and its effort to establish a model socialist colony in a Western American state with a view to inspiring others to emulate the project and to eventually win political control of the state government. Willard was deeply committed to the colonization plan, which would ultimately lead to the defection of a minority faction to establish a more conventional political organization, the [[Social Democratic Party of America]] in 1898.

Together with Richard J. Hinton of Washington, DC, and [[Wilfred P. Borland]] of [[Bay City, Michigan]], Willard was one of three central decision-makers in the selection of [[Washington state|Washington]] as the group's target state.&lt;ref&gt;"To Locate Socialist Colony," ''Columbus [NE] Journal,'' vol. 28, no. 17 (Aug. 4, 1897), pg. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; He and Borland were also place in charge of the purchasing of land there for colonization, making possible the establishment there of the [[Burley Colony]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3370552/seeking_a_site_colonization_committee/ "Seeking a Site: Colonization Committee of the Social Democracy Will Visit,"] ''Wichita Daily Beacon,'' vol. 28, no. 133 (Sept. 24, 1897), pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Washington the colonization effort abandoned the banner of the Social Democracy of America to become a new organization called the Cooperative Brotherhood. Willard played a leading role in this organization, appearing as the lead signatory on the group's deed of trust for purchase of communal land,&lt;ref&gt;"Deed of Trust: How the Cooperative Brotherhood Secures Collective Ownership," ''Industrial Freedom'' [Edison, WA], whole no. 28 (Nov. 12, 1898), pg. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and was additionally chosen as the first Secretary of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;"Why Our Plans Are as They Are," ''Industrial Freedom'' [Edison, WA], whole no. 28 (Nov. 12, 1898), pg. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Willard would remain a resident of the Burley Colony for two years, before giving up on the project and leaving for the sunnier climes of [[Southern California]].&lt;ref name=Trahair /&gt;

===Theosophist===

Following his departure from the Burley Colony, Willard abandoned socialism and became deeply involved in the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] movement. He moved to [[Los Angeles]] and there established a local chapter of the [[Theosophical Society]] there.&lt;ref name=Trahair /&gt; Willard had long been an adherent of [[spiritualism]], having been introduced in 1884 when he first read [[Helena Blavatsky|Helena Blavatsky's]] seminal work, ''[[Isis Unveiled]].''&lt;ref name=LeWarne132&gt;LeWarne, ''Utopias on Puget Sound,'' pg. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mason===

Willard was also an active [[Freemason]], attaining the status of 32nd Degree. On October 1, 1928, Willard joined with other leading Masons in [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]] to launch the [[Philalethes Society]], a Masonic research organization.&lt;ref name=PS&gt;[http://www.freemasonry.org/history.php "History of the Philalethes Society,"] The Philalethes Society, www.freemasonry.org/&lt;/ref&gt; The society was based upon the previously existing [[Académie Française]] and limited its membership to just 40 fellows, among whom was Willard.&lt;ref name=PS /&gt; The organization continues to exist into the 21st Century and is regarded as the leading Masonic research and writing organization in North America.&lt;ref name=PS /&gt;

===Death and legacy===

Willard died January 17, 1942 in [[San Diego, California]].&lt;ref&gt;Note that some sources mistakenly give Willard's date of death as "1935." This is incorrect. See: [https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3371942/prominent_mason_cyrus_field_willard_dies/ "Prominent Mason Dies,"] ''Salt Lake Tribune,'' vol. 144, no. 96 (Jan. 18, 1942), pg. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; He was 83 years old at the time of his death.

Willard was the second cousin of [[Frances Willard (suffragist)|Frances Willard]], founder of the [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU) and prominent [[suffragist]].&lt;ref name=Warnke131 /&gt; Cyrus Willard claimed to have played a significant role in the shaping of his cousin's political views, recalling in his autobiography, "I had a pile of correspondence with her four inches tall and converted her to the proposition that poverty caused as much intemperance as intemperance caused poverty."&lt;ref&gt;Willard, ''Autobiography,'' chapter 15, pp. 1-2, cited in LeWarne, ''Utopias on Puget Sound,'' pg. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Denis M. MacEoin''' (born 26 January 1949 in [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]]) is a British analyst and writer. Since 2014 has published at the [[Gatestone Institute]], of which he is a Senior Fellow, a number of essays on current events with a Middle Eastern focus.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{Cite web|title=Biography of Denis MacEoin|publisher=Middle East Forum|url=http://www.meforum.org/staff/Denis+MacEoin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/author/Denis+MacEoin|title=Writings by Denis MacEoin :: Gatestone Institute|work=Gatestone Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a "Senior Editor" from 2009–2010 at ''[[Middle East Quarterly]]'', a publication of the American think tank [[Middle East Forum]], where he is also a Fellow.

[[Electrodermal activity]] (EDA) refers to the changing electrical charges observed on the surface of the skin. EDA meters were first developed in 1889 in Russia, and psychotherapists began using them as tools for therapy in the 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.sonoma.edu/users/d/daniels/junglect.html|title = Notes on Carl Gustav Jung|date = |accessdate = 4 April 2015|website = Sonoma State University|publisher = Sonoma State University|last = Daniels|first = Victor|quote=By 1906 [Jung] was using GSR and breath measurement to note changes in respiration and skin resistance to emotionally charged worlds.

[[Volney Mathison]] ([[chiropractor]], [[radio engineer]], [[psychologist]], and [[hypnotist]]) built an EDA meter based on a [[Wheatstone bridge]],&lt;ref&gt;"Technically it is a specially developed 'Wheatstone Bridge' well known to electrically minded people as a device to measure the amount of resistance to a flow of electricity", L.

Very early I wanted a pilot; I had to have some method of metering preclears which was not dependent at all upon opinion or judgment. And I went out and looked at the existing lie detector equipment and I could not find anything which would do a job of work. Now, Volney Mathison out on the Coast heard a talk out there one day, and I mentioned this fact. ... I had one of the fanciest electroencephalographs made and it didn’t do anything very much, police detectors didn’t do anything very much, and Mathison went to work and he floated a current within a current. This machine is relatively simple, but it's a current floating inside another current .. And I am, by the way, very much indebted to Mathison just on this basis of all of a sudden having a pilot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Taped Lecture: How to Audit a Theta Line, Parts I and II|last = Hubbard|first = L.

After the partnership broke up in 1954, Mathison continued improving his E-meters with additional patents ({{US patent|2736313}}, {{US patent|2810383}}), marketing them through his own company and publications, retaining many of the concepts and terms from his time with Hubbard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mathison|first1=Volney|title=Electropsychometry|date=1952|publisher=Mathison Electropsychometers|location=Los Angeles|page=1|edition=4|url=http://www.lermanet.com/exit/volney/Electropsychometry-4%231AF837.jpg|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a separate line of development, EDA monitors were incorporated in [[polygraph]] machines by [[Leonarde Keeler]]. Rigorous testing of the polygraph has yielded mixed results (see [[Polygraph|Polygraph main page]]), and some critics classify polygraph operation as a [[pseudoscience]].

The E-meter was adopted for use in [[Dianetics]] and [[Scientology]] when Mathison collaborated with [[L.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard falsely claimed to be the inventor of the E-meter, a claim which is in keeping with the Scientology stance that Hubbard is the "source", or "the only originator of all Dianetics and Scientology material".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rethinking Scientology A Thorough Analysis of L.

The E-meter was not part of the early days of Dianetics and Scientology. Auditing was composed of conversation and not led by a mechanical device. Hubbard introduced an E-meter prototype during the 1952 Philadelphia Doctorate Course but did not introduce his transistorized version after several years later. The E-meter became "the principal material artifact" of Dianetics and Scientology from the 1960s onward.&lt;ref name="Cowan 2014"&gt;{{cite conference |last=Cowan |first=Douglas E. |title=Acta Comparanda , French |url=http://www.observatoire-religion.com/2016/12/scientology-in-a-scholarly-perspective/ |booktitle=Clearly Material: Objects, Meaning, and the Ongoing Construction of New Religious Reality |conference=International Conference – Scientology in a scholarly perspective 24-25th January 2014 |publisher=University of Antwerp, Faculty for Comparative Study of Religions and Humanism |place=Antwerp, Belgium |year=2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216050903/http://www.observatoire-religion.com/2016/12/scientology-in-a-scholarly-perspective/ |archivedate=2017-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book, ''[[L. Ron Hubbard, Messiah or Madman?]]'', [[Bent Corydon]] wrote:

{{quote|In late 1954 the use of the E-meter was discontinued by Hubbard.  Wrote Hubbard: "Yesterday, we used an instrument called an E-Meter to register whether or not the process was still getting results so that the auditor would know how long to continue it. While the E-Meter is an interesting investigation instrument and has played its part in research, it is not today used by the auditor&amp;nbsp;... As we long ago suspected, the intervention of a mechanical gadget between the auditor and the preclear had a tendency to depersonalize the session&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="Corydon313"&gt;{{cite book |last=Corydon |first=Bent |title=Messiah or Madman |year=1987 |publisher=Lyle Stuart |page=313 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Though it seemed for a while that Scientology's more advanced techniques would serve without an E-meter, a few months later in May 1955, Hubbard wrote:

{{quote|And here come E-Meters back into the picture. The [[Hubbard Association of Scientologists International|HASI]] is, at this moment, building a new and better E-Meter than has ever been built before, under the trademarked name of Physio-galvanometer, or O-Meter. It has very little in common with the old type E-Meter. Nevertheless, an old type E-Meter can be utilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hubbard|first1=L. Ron|title=Professional Auditor's Bulletin No. 52|date=13 May 1955|publisher=Hubbard Communication Office|location=London, UK|isbn=87-87347-82-2|page=1}}&lt;!--|accessdate=17 May 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Scientology meter was smaller, based on [[transistors]] rather than [[vacuum tubes]], and powered by a low-voltage [[rechargeable battery]] rather than [[Mains electricity|line voltage]].

From then on, the E-meter was a required tool for Scientology ministers. The "Hubbard Mark II" E-meter was christened in 1960 and the Hubbard Mark III shortly after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grant|first1=Boyd|title=What is Scientology? History, Beliefs, Rules, Secrets, and Facts|date=2014|publisher=Speedy Publishing|location=Newark, Delaware|page=5|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 6, 1966, Hubbard won a patent on the Mark V version under the name "Hubbard Electropsychometer". Corydon wrote that the Hubbard E-meter was actually developed by Scientologists Don Breeding and Joe Wallis,&lt;ref name="Corydon313" /&gt; though the patent ({{US patent|3290589}}) does not list other developers.

Corydon's account was said to be based on the [[L. Ron Hubbard, Messiah or Madman?|memoirs]] of Hubbard's son, [[Ronald DeWolf]], but in 1987, DeWolf [[Ronald DeWolf#Biography of L. Ron Hubbard|sued the publisher]] to prevent publication and swore an affidavit repudiating everything in the book.&lt;ref&gt;[[:commons:File:Ron DeWolf May 1987.pdf|Affidavit submitted by DeWolf to a notary in Nevada]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scientology E-meter has been redesigned and re-patented several times since its first introduction to Dianetics (e.g.: {{US patent|4459995}}, {{US patent|4578635}}, {{US patent|4702259}}).

In 1969, Scientology was accepted as a religion by the Court of Appeal and declared that the E-meter was useful in "bona fide religious counseling". District Court Judge Gesell, while denying medical validity to the device, returned the e-meter to the Church. All e-meters from this point forward had to be inscribed with a disclaimer that it was not for medical or scientific diagnoses, treatment or prevention of any disease. The church reformulated the disclaimer into: "The Hubbard electrometer is a religious artifact. By itself, this meter does nothing. It is for religious use by students and Ministers of the church in Confessionals and pastoral counseling only."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=New Religious Movements, Technology, and Science: The Conceptualization of the E-meter in Scientology Teachings |journal=Zygon |year=2016 |last=Bigliardi |first=Stefano |volume=51 |issue=3 |page=668 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientology===
E-meters are used in Scientology and [[Dianetics]] by Scientology ministers known as "[[auditing (Scientology)|auditors]]". Scientology materials traditionally refer to the subject as the "[[preclear]]", although auditors continue to use the meter on subjects who are well beyond the "[[clear (Scientology)|clear]]" level. The auditor gives the preclear a series of commands or questions while the preclear holds a pair of cylindrical [[electrodes]] ("cans") connected to the meter, and the auditor notes both the verbal response and the activity of the meter. Auditor training includes familiarization with a number of [[Auditing (Scientology)#Terminology|characteristic needle movements]], each with a specific significance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientology.org/what-is-scientology/the-practice-of-scientology/how-the-e-meter-works.html |title=How the E-Meter works, Church of Scientology International |publisher=Scientology.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religion scholar Dorthe Refslund Christensen describes the e-meter as "a technical device that could help the auditor locate engrams and areas of change when auditing a [[Clear (Scientology)|preclear]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rethinking Scientology A Thorough Analysis of L.

Some critics of Dianetics and Scientology assert that the Scientology concepts associated with the E-meter and its use are regarded by the scientific and medical communities as [[pseudoscience]], and that the E-meter has never been subjected to [[clinical trial]]s as a therapeutic tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Inside Scientology Reaching for the Stars|series=Nightline |network=ABC |date=23 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, by 1972, more than 1500 articles on electrodermal activity (EDA) had been published in professional publications, and today EDA is regarded as a popular method for investigating human [[psychophysiological]] phenomena.&lt;ref name="Boucsein-7"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boucsein|first1=Wolfram|title=Electrodermal Activity|date=2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781461411260|page=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6N6rnOEZEEoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PR4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientologists claim that in the hands of a trained operator, the meter can indicate whether a person has been relieved from the spiritual impediment of past experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Yearbook of the European Convention on Human Rights by the European Court of Human Rights, {{ISBN|90-247-2383-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with a 1974 federal court order, the Church of Scientology asserts that the E-meter is intended for use only in church-sanctioned auditing sessions; it is not a curative or medical device.&lt;ref&gt;Religionsfreiheit und Konformismus: Über Minderheiten und die Macht der Mehrheit, Gerhard Besier, 2004. {{ISBN|3-8258-7654-3}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=3v4xJfq9B88C&amp;pg=PA177&amp;dq=hubbard+electrometer+artefact]&lt;/ref&gt; The E-meters used by the Church were previously manufactured by Scientologists at their [[Gold Base]] facility,&lt;ref name="Sptimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/TampaBay/102598/scientologygold.html |title=A Place called Gold, St. Petersburg Times, 1998 |publisher=Sptimes.com |date=1998-10-25 |accessdate=2012-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; but now are manufactured in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref name="Sptimes.com" /&gt;

According to Hubbard, the E-meter is used by the operator for three vital functions:
# To determine what process to run and what to run it on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hubbard|first=L Ron|title=Unreading Questions and Items|journal=HCO Bulletin 27 May 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# To observe how well the process is running.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hubbard|first=L Ron|title=SOP Goals|journal=HCO Bulletin 18 February 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# To know when the process should be stopped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hubbard|first=L Ron|title=Floating Needles and End Phenomena|journal=HCO Bulletin 20 February 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Church claims that the E-meter can be used to assess the emotion charge of single words, whole sentences, and questions, as well as indicating the general state of the subject when the operator is not speaking.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Few users of the E-meter claim that it does anything to the subject. To most, it does no more than suggest to the operator a change of mental, emotional, or parasympathetic nervous state or activity.&lt;ref name="Lebron-1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lebron|first1=Robyn|title=Searching for Spiritual Unity...

New religious movement scholar Douglas Cowan writes that Scientologists cannot progress along [[the Bridge to Total Freedom]] without an E-meter, and that Hubbard even told Scientologists to buy two E-meters, in the event that one of them fails to operate.&lt;ref name="Cowan 2014"/&gt; According to anthropologist Roy Rappaport, the E-meter is a ritual object, an object that "stand[s] indexically for something intangible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first1=James R. |title=The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements |volume=1 |editor-last=Lewis |editor-first=James R. |publisher=OUP USA |year=2008 |isbn=9780195369649 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Electrodermal activity}}
One of E-meter's primary components is a [[Wheatstone bridge]], an electrical circuit configuration invented in 1833&lt;ref&gt;"The Genesis of the Wheatstone Bridge" by Stig Ekelof discusses [[Samuel Hunter Christie|Christie's]] and [[Charles Wheatstone|Wheatstone]]'s contributions, and why the bridge carries Wheatstone's name. Published in "Engineering Science and Education Journal", volume 10, no 1, February 2001, pages 37-40.&lt;/ref&gt; that enables the detection of very small differences between two [[electrical impedance]]s (in this case, [[electrical resistance|resistance]]). The E-meter is constructed so that one resistance is the subject's body and the other is a [[rheostat]] controlled by the operator. A small voltage from the battery is applied to electrodes held in the subjects hands. As the electrical properties (electrodermal activity) of the subject's body changes during the counseling,&lt;ref&gt;HCO WW Staff: Essential Information Every Scientologist Should Know, HCO Information Letter of 24 November 1963.

In the Scientology E-meter, the large control, known as the "tone arm", adjusts the [[Biasing|meter bias]], while a smaller one controls the [[Gain (electronics)|gain]].

Researchers in [[psychophysiology]] are also exploring [[admittance]] and [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] aspects of EDA that can be observed only with [[alternating current]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Electrodermal Activity|last = Boucsein|first = Wolfram|publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year = 2012|isbn = 9781461411260|location = |pages = 2|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6N6rnOEZEEoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The E-Meter, measuring variations in electrodermal activity (which can be highly responsive to emotion&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;), functions on one of the same physiological data sources as the [[polygraph]] or [[lie detector]].  According to Scientology doctrine, the resistance corresponds to the "mental mass and energy" of the subject's mind, which are claimed to change when the subject thinks of particular mental images ([[engram (Dianetics)|engrams]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientology.org/what-is-scientology/the-practice-of-scientology/the-e-meter.html |title=Official Scientology page on the E-meter |publisher=Scientology.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; One account tells about L.

The traditional theory of EDA holds that skin resistance varies with the state of [[sweat glands]] in the skin. Sweating is controlled by the [[sympathetic nervous system]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Martini | first1 = Frederic | last2 = Bartholomew | first2 = Edwin | title = Essentials of Anatomy &amp; Physiology | publisher = [[Benjamin Cummings]] | location = San Francisco | year = 2001 | page = 263 | isbn = 0-13-061567-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because sweat contains [[dielectric]]s (salt, etc.), conductivity is increased when the sweat glands are activated. But some advocates argue that the meter responds more quickly than would be possible by the exudation and drying of sweat.&lt;ref&gt;[[Skin conductance#Possible problems|Skin conductance main page]]: "Lastly, galvanic skin responses are delayed 1-3 seconds."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hubbard|first1=Lafayette|title=The Book of E-meter Drills|page=27|url=http://e-meter-star.com/books.files/E-meter_drills.pdf#page=27|accessdate=8 April 2015|quote=An Instant Read.

The medical establishment had been watching Hubbard's enterprises since 1951 when the [http://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/bme/ New Jersey State Board of Medical Examiners] [[History of Dianetics|prosecuted the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation]] ([[Elizabeth, New Jersey]]) for practicing medicine without a license.&lt;ref&gt;''Bulletin of the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation'', Elizabeth, New Jersey.

The Church claimed that they had not written any publication that the E-meter could or would heal anything,&lt;ref name=Garrison /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;136&lt;/sup&gt; and sued to get the property back.

Auditing or processing, in their view, treats the spirit of man, not his body, though through the healing of the spirit the body can be affected. They have culled from their literature numerous statements disclaiming any intent to treat disease and recommending that Scientology practitioners send those under their care to doctors when organic defects may be found. They have introduced through testimony a document which they assert all those who undergo auditing or processing must sign which states that Scientology is "a spiritual and religious guide intended to make persons more aware of themselves as spiritual beings, and not treating or diagnosing human ailments of body or mind, and not engaged in the teaching of medical arts or sciences * * *."&lt;br/&gt;Finally, with respect to their claim to be a religion and hence within the protection of the First Amendment, they have shown that the Founding Church of Scientology is incorporated as a church in the District of Columbia, and that its ministers are qualified to perform marriages and burials. They have introduced their Creed into evidence. The Government has made no claim that the Founding Church is not a ''bona fide'' religion, that auditing is not part of the exercise of that religion, or that the theory of auditing is not a doctrine of that religion.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Wright|first1 = Skelley|title = Opinion|url = https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18407779340802616532|publisher = United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia|accessdate = 10 April 2015|location = Washington, D.C.|date = February 5, 1969|page = 1154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Substantial fees were charged for the meter and for auditing sessions using the meter. They repeatedly and explicitly represented that such auditing effectuated cures of many physical and mental illnesses. An individual processed with the aid of the E-Meter was said to reach the intended goal of 'clear' and was led to believe that there was reliable scientific proof that once cleared many, indeed most, illnesses would successfully be cured. Auditing was guaranteed to be successful. All this was and is false.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/E-Meter/barrett-quote.txt Secrets of Scientology: The E-Meter] REFERENCE: Stephen Barrett, MD, and William Jarvis, PhD (editors), "The Health Robbers", Prometheus Books, Buffalo NY (1993).  Chapter 23, "The Gadgeteers", by Wallace Janssen, pp. 321-335.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Unable to do more under the mandate from the Court of Appeals, Judge Gesell ordered all the property to be returned to the Church, and thereafter, the E-meter may be used only in "''bona fide'' religious counseling". All meters and referring literature must include a label disclaiming any medical benefits:

{{quote|The E-Meter is not medically or scientifically useful for the diagnosis, treatment or prevention of any disease.  It is not medically or scientifically capable of improving the health or bodily functions of anyone.&lt;ref name="scribd.com"/&gt;}}

The church adopted a modified version of that statement, which it still invokes in connection with the E-meter. The current statement reads:

{{quote|The Hubbard Electrometer is a religious artifact. By itself, this meter does nothing. It is for religious use by students and Ministers of the church in Confessionals and pastoral counseling only.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jIb6j69FjHUC&amp;q=%22By+itself,+this+meter+does+nothing%22&amp;dq=%22By+itself,+this+meter+does+nothing%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8UbBVKjsG5TjarPBgYAG&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA Dianetics: self-improvement home study course], Bridge Publications, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Judge Gesell also ordered the Church to pay all the government's legal fees and warehousing costs for the confiscated property for the nine years of litigation. He also required the church to pay the salaries and travel expenses of FDA agents who might, from time to time, inspect for compliance with the court's order.&lt;ref name=Garrison /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;143&lt;/sup&gt;  The raid was ruled illegal, but the government retained copies of the documents.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In 1979 in Sweden, a court forbade calling the E-meter "an invaluable aid to measuring man's mental state and changes in it" in an advertisement. The prohibition was upheld by the [[European Commission of Human Rights]] in case ''[[X. and Church of Scientology v. Sweden]]''.

In October 2009, a three-judge panel at the Correctional Court in Paris, France convicted the church and six of its members of organized fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/10/27/france.scientology.fraud/index.html?eref=igoogle_cnn|title=French court convicts Church of Scientology of fraud|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=27 October 2009|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court's decision followed a three-week trial, where two plaintiffs alleged they were defrauded by the organization. One plaintiff's complaint involved the use of an E-Meter by Scientologists with medical implications. This plaintiff claimed that, after being audited with the device, she was encouraged to pay tens of thousands of euros for vitamins, books, and courses to improve her condition. She argued that amounted to fraud. The Court agreed, and the ruling was upheld on appeal in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=AFP|title=Scientology's fraud conviction upheld in France|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/10384877/Scientologys-fraud-conviction-upheld-in-France.html|accessdate=29 March 2014|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; See {{section link|Scientology in France|Conviction for fraud}}.

In 1964, the government of [[Victoria, Australia]] held a Board of Inquiry into Scientology which returned its findings in a document colloquially known as the [[Anderson Report]]. Psychiatrist Ian Holland Martin, honorary federal secretary of the [[Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists|Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists]], gave evidence that the E-Meter "used for Scientology" was a "psycho-galvano-meter" and was "dangerous in unqualified hands".&lt;ref name="CanTimesJun1964"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article105764102 |title=SCIENTOLOGY VENUS TRIP 'A DELUSION'. |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |date=2 June 1964 |accessdate=13 August 2013 |page=27 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that if the E-meter "was suggested to possess mysterious powers" to someone who did not understand that it had "been thoroughly discredited as a lie detector" then "that person would be suggestible to ideas foisted on him by the operator".&lt;ref name="CanTimesJun1964"/&gt; The final report of the inquiry stated that the E-meter enabled Scientology

&lt;blockquote&gt;to assume, intensify and retain control over the minds and wills of preclears. Fears of its abilities keep them in constant subjection. Its use can be so manipulated by cunningly phrased questions that almost any desired result can be obtained, and it is used unscrupulously to dominate students and staff alike. All the evil features of scientology are intensified where the E-meter is involved. When used in conjunction with hypnotic techniques, its evil impact is greatly increased.

This simple electrical device is not, of course, the sole basis for the condemnation of scientology, but without the E-meter scientology would be partly disarmed.&lt;ref&gt;State of Victoria (1965). ''[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Cowen/audit/ar14.html Report of the Board of Inquiry into Scientology]'' p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1965, Victoria banned the use of the E-meter without a license, with Western Australia and South Australia following suit. In 1969, the High Court of Western Australia ruled the ban illegal. South Australia repealed its law in 1973, and Victoria repealed it in 1982. In 1983, the High Court of Australia ruled that Scientology was a religion, and as such had the same rights and protections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=James R.|title=Scientology|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, United Kingdom|isbn=9780199887118|pages=Introduction: 5, 6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WEy-BgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT18&amp;dq=%22founding%20church%20of%20scientology%20v.%20united%20states%22&amp;pg=PT36#v=onepage&amp;q=victoria&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientology beliefs and theories==
Within the Church of Scientology, the early psychoanalysts are credited with first use of the E-meter. {{blockquote|Bob Thomas, senior executive of the Church of Scientology in the United States, described the E-meter ... "Some very early work on this was done by Jung, who used a list of words.  I think he combined it with the psycho-galvanometer. By this word association, he was attempting to increase the effectiveness of the free association techniques, which he was not sure about."&lt;ref name=Garrison /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;62-64&lt;/sup&gt;}}

[[L. Ron Hubbard]] credited Mathison with recreating the E-meter and bringing the first model to Hubbard for use in Dianetics.&lt;ref name=6207C19&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hubbard|first1=L. Ron|title=Taped Lecture 6207C19 SHSBC-191: The E-Meter|date=19 July 1962|publisher=Church of Scientology, St. Hill Organization|location=East Grinstead, England|url=http://www.matrixfiles.com/Scientology%20Materials/Tapes%20in%20order/6105a07%20Saint%20Hill%20Special%20Briefing%20Course%20Lectures/TXT/6207C19%20SHSBC-191%20The%20E-Meter.txt|accessdate=10 June 2015|ref=6207C19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122084024/http://www.matrixfiles.com/Scientology%20Materials/Tapes%20in%20order/6105a07%20Saint%20Hill%20Special%20Briefing%20Course%20Lectures/TXT/6207C19%20SHSBC-191%20The%20E-Meter.txt|archivedate=22 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hubbard set out his [[theory]] of how the E-meter works in his book ''Understanding the E-Meter'':

{{quote|For the meter to be read, the tiny flow of electrical energy through the preclear (person) has to remain steady. When this tiny flow is changed the needle of the E-Meter moves. This will happen if the preclear pulls in or releases mental mass. This mental mass (condensed energy), acts as an additional resistance or lack of resistance to the flow of electrical energy from the E-Meter.}}

Hubbard claimed that this "mental mass" has the same physical characteristics, including weight, as [[mass]] as commonly understood by lay persons:

{{quote|In Scientology it has been discovered that mental energy is simply a finer, higher level of physical energy. The test of this is conclusive in that a thetan "mocking up" (creating) mental image pictures and thrusting them into the body can increase the body mass and by casting them away again can decrease the body mass. This test has actually been made and an increase of as much as thirty pounds, actually measured on scales, has been added to, and subtracted from, a body by creating "mental energy". Energy is energy. Matter is condensed energy.}}

This text in ''Understanding the E-Meter'' is accompanied by three drawings. The first shows a man standing on a weighing scale, which reflects a weight of "150" (the units are not given). The next shows the man on the same scale, weighed down under a burden of "Mental Image Pictures", and the scale indicates a weight of "180". The last picture shows the man standing upright on the scale, now unburdened by "Mental Image Pictures" and with a smile on his face, while the scale again indicates a weight of "148".

Bob Thomas, senior executive of the church in the early 1970s, gave a prosaic description.

{{quote|The immediate goal of the E-meter is to enhance communication. In other words, just to take a parallel: if an analyst were allowing his patient to free-associate, and the patient were connected in some way with a galvanometer which showed the analyst what things the patient mentioned were emotionally charged and what things were not emotionally charged, a lot of time would be saved. So it's simply an assist for the practitioner to direct the individual to areas which he himself may not realize are troubled or charged with emotion or are repressed; and to better direct his attention into those areas ...

The E-meter is a simple psycho-galvanometer. It's got some increased sensitivity built into it and the myological reactions that you sometimes get in the galvanometer have been damped out by the circuitry, so that the mental reactions, the reactions of the spirit, on the body are emphasized and can be read more clearly. But that's simply the design of the circuitry; it doesn't basically affect the kind of device. It registers what is called, commonly, the psychogalvanomic reflex, which is a reflex that is a poorly understood mechanism of the psyche. The body resistance seems to vary when the individual thinks of a painful or pain-associated or traumatic-associated concept, or word or idea.&amp;nbsp;... Some very early work was done on this by Jung&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref name=Garrison /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;62-64&lt;/sup&gt;}}

Chapels and churches in [[embassies]] can be a very particular type of chapel, sometimes acting as [[clandestine church]]es or havens from religion persecution. Since embassies are exempt from the host country's laws, they are able to provide services to prohibited and persecuted religious groups. For example, Catholic embassy chapels in Britain provided services while Catholicism was banned under the [[Penal law (British)|Penal Laws]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Brown |editor-first1=Jonathan |last1=Elliott |first1=John |title=The sale of the century : artistic relations between Spain and Great Britain, 1604–1655 |date=2002 |publisher=Yale University Press in association with Museo Nacional del Prado, Madrid |location=New Haven |isbn=9780300097610}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar role was filled for Protestants by the Prussian embassy chapel in Rome, where Protestantism was unlawful until 1871. Upon laws granting freedom of religion, these embassy chapels have often then become regularised churches and parishes, such as the Dutch embassy chapel in [[Istanbul]], which then became [[The Union Church of Istanbul]].

==History==
Early modern embassy staff, who commonly lived in the ambassadorial residence, were permitted to have in-house chapels and chaplains, especially where, in the wake of the [[Reformation]], they lived in a country that banned their religious faith. These soon drew members of the same faith to join the worship services in the embassy. The [[Dutch Republic]] sponsored chapels in twelve of its embassies, which acted as churches for local [[Dutch Reformed Church|Reformed Protestants]]. Emperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] sponsored them wherever he could, "That Catholic services might be held to comfort the Catholics of the area, and to promote the further growth of this religion."&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Benjamin J., ''Religious Conflict and the Practice of Toleration in Early Modern Europe,'' Harvard University Press, 2007, Chapter 8, p. 186 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; By the late eighteenth century, a new legal principle had come into being, [[extraterritoriality]], according to which, "the ambassador and the precincts of the embassy stood as if on the soil of his homeland, subject only to its laws."&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Benjamin J., ''Religious Conflict and the Practice of Toleration in Early Modern Europe,'' Harvard University Press, 2007, Chapter 8, p. 186 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[religious freedom]] advanced with time, many of the embassy chapels lost their function as safe havens and were converted into churches proper or dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Isabel Karremann|editor2=Cornel Zwierlein|editor3=Inga Mai Groote|title=Forgetting Faith? Negotiating Confessional Conflict in Early Modern Europe. |date=2012 |publisher=De Gruyter |location=Berlin |isbn=9783110270051}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catholic embassies in London===
During the reign of [[Elizabeth I]], Catholicism was gradually outlawed in England, and Catholic masses and worship were prohibited, particularly after the [[Oath of Supremacy]] of 1559. With the "Act to retain the Queen's Majesty's subjects in their obedience," passed in 1581, the celebration of Mass was prohibited under penalty of a fine of two hundred marks and imprisonment for one year for the celebrant, and a fine of one hundred marks and the same imprisonment for those who heard the Mass. The reign of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] (1625–49) saw a small revival of Catholicism in England, especially among the upper classes. As part of his royal marriage settlement Charles's Catholic wife, [[Henrietta Maria]], was permitted her own royal chapel (the [[Queen's Chapel]] in London, as well as a chapel at [[Somerset House]]) and chaplain.

Ambassadors of Catholic nations sought to provide relief for persecuted English Catholics by protecting worship at their chapels with [[diplomatic immunity]]. The English government attempted unsuccessfully several times to dissuade such use of the Spanish and Portuguese embassies between 1563 and 1611.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Trimble |first1=William Raleigh |title=The Embassy Chapel Question, 1625-1660 |journal=The Journal of Modern History |date=1946 |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=97–107 |jstor=1872115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1610, [[James I]] asked foreign ambassadors not to allow English priests to celebrate at, or English Catholics to attend, their chapels, but only the Venetian ambassador complied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=ADAIR |first1=Edward Robert |title=The Extraterritoriality of Ambassadors in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries |date=1929 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1624, several arrests of English Catholics leaving these embassy chapels were made, which irritated the French ambassador, the Marquis of Blainville. On March 10, 1630, an order in council forbade Catholics to hear Mass at the embassies. The next Sunday, as reported by the Venetian ambassador, guards were placed in front of the French, Venetian and Spanish embassies, and Catholics were arrested as they left the premise; afterwards the Spanish ambassador, Don [[Carlos Coloma]], unsuccessfully tried to obtain their release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Trimble |first1=William Raleigh |title=The Embassy Chapel Question, 1625-1660 |journal=The Journal of Modern History |date=1946 |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=97–107 |jstor=1872115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coloma diffused the issue by taking residence in the countryside, and demanding that the English government punish those who had violated his diplomatic immunity. Five years later, on April 12, 1635, the council directed Sir [[John Coke]] to inform the ambassadors that their diplomatic rights would not be infringed upon, but that penal laws against Catholics would be pursued. When a priest who had said Mass was captured and escaped to the house of the French ambassador Henri de Saint-Nectaire, where he was then recaptured, he was set free because of the right of extraterritoriality, and his pursuers were punished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Venice: July 1635 {{!}} British History Online |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/cal-state-papers/venice/vol23/pp409-426 |website=www.british-history.ac.uk |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, enforcement of the law became lenient; Venetian ambassador Anzolo Corer wrote in 1636 that Mass at the chapel of the Queen and at the embassies was "frequented with freedom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Venice: September 1636 {{!}} British History Online |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/cal-state-papers/venice/vol24/pp57-74 |website=www.british-history.ac.uk |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1637, large crowds attended Mass daily at the Spanish embassy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Charles I - volume 376: Undated 1637 {{!}} British History Online |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/cal-state-papers/domestic/chas1/1637-8/pp69-97 |website=www.british-history.ac.uk |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In eighteenth-century London, there were chapels in the French, Spanish, Florentine, Venetian (in the Haymarket), Portuguese (originally in Golden Square, then in South Street, Grosvenor Square), Austrian (on Hanover Street), Neapolitan (in Soho Square), Bavarian (on Warwick Street) and Sardinian embassies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Paola |last1=Bianchi |first2= Karin |last2=Wolfe |title=Turin and the British in the Age of the Grand Tour |publisher=Cambridge University Press, 2017 |isbn=9781107147706}}&lt;/ref&gt; In London, the streets outside the houses and house chapels of the [[Kingdom of Spain|Spanish]], [[Kingdom of France|French]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] embassies were the scenes of public protests, sometimes violent. The police sometimes attempted to detain British people who attended Catholic services in the embassy chapels. Embassy chapels led to diplomatic tension between the English government and the Catholic governments who operated the embassies between 1625 and 1660.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Trimble |first1=William Raleigh |title=The Embassy Chapel Question, 1625-1660 |journal=The Journal of Modern History |date=1946 |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=97–107 |jstor=1872115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the eighteenth century, English subjects ceased to be harassed for attending services at the Sardinian embassy. On Easter Sunday 1772 [[James Boswell]] and [[Pasquale Paoli]] "worshipped together at the Sardinian Chapel."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Martin: A Life of James Boswell, Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; When Catholic worship became allowed in London in 1791 with the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791|Roman Catholic Relief Act]], the Bavarian, Sardinian and Spanish embassy churches were converted into churches, while the others (Venetian, Neapolitan, Imperial, French and Florentine) were dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Evinson |first1=Denis |title=Catholic churches of London |date=1998 |publisher=Sheffield Academic |location=Sheffield |isbn=9781850758198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''essence–energies distinction''' is an [[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology|Eastern Orthodox theological concept]] that states that there is a distinction between the '''essence''' (''[[ousia]]'') and the '''energies''' (''[[energeia]]'') of [[God]]. It was formulated by  [[Gregory Palamas]] of [[Thessaloniki]] (1296–1359), as part of his defense of the [[Mount Athos|Athonite]] [[Christian monasticism|monastic]] practice of ''[[hesychasm]]os''{{refn|group=note|The mystical exercise of "stillness" to facilitate ceasless inner prayer and [[noesis|noetic]] contemplation of God.}} against the charge of [[heresy in Christianity|heresy]] brought by the [[Christian humanism|humanist]] scholar and theologian [[Barlaam of Calabria]].&lt;ref name="Carile"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Romanides_notes"/&gt;

Orthodox theologians generally regard this distinction as a real distinction, and not just a conceptual distinction.&lt;ref name=nichols&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gO6PAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22substance+or+essence%22 |first=Aidan |last=Nichols |title=Light from the East: Authors and Themes in Orthodox Theology, Part 4 |publisher=Sheed and Ward |year=1995 |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, [[Western Christianity|Western Christian]] thought has tended to reject the essence–energies distinction as real in the case of God, characterizing the view as a heretical introduction of an unacceptable division in the Trinity and suggestive of [[polytheism]].&lt;ref name=Vailhe/&gt;&lt;ref name=Meyendorff1&gt;John Meyendorff (editor), [https://books.google.com/books?id=8jcjtUbwptwC&amp;lpg=PR11&amp;pg=PR11#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Palamas%20is%20a%20saint%22&amp;f=false ''Gregory Palamas – The Triads''], p. xi.

==Historical background==
{{See also|Potentiality and actuality}}

The essence–energy distinction was formulated by [[Gregory Palamas]] of [[Thessaloniki]] (1296–1359), as part of his defense of the [[Mount Athos|Athonite]] [[Christian monasticism|monastic]] practice of ''[[hesychasm]]os'', the mystical exercise of "stillness" to facilitate ceaseless inner prayer and [[noesis|noetic]] contemplation of God, against the charge of [[heresy in Christianity|heresy]] brought by the [[Christian humanism|humanist]] scholar and theologian [[Barlaam of Calabria]].&lt;ref name="Carile"&gt;"accusing Gregory Palamas of Messalianism"{{snd}} Antonio Carile, [http://www.apostoliki-diakonia.gr/en_main/catehism/theologia_zoi/themata.asp?cat=hist&amp;contents=contents.asp&amp;main=EH_texts&amp;file=12.htm ''Η Θεσσαλονίκη ως κέντρο Ορθοδόξου θεολογίας – προοπτικές στη σημερινή Ευρώπη''] Thessaloniki 2000, pp. 131–140, (English translation provided by the Apostoliki Diakonia of the Church of Greece).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Romanides_notes"&gt;[http://www.romanity.org/htm/rom.15.en.notes_on_the_palamite_controversy.01.htm ''Notes on the Palamite Controversy and Related Topics''] by John S. Romanides, ''The Greek Orthodox Theological Review'', Volume VI, Number 2, Winter, 1960–61. Published by the Holy Cross Greek Orthodox Theological School Press, Brookline, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt; According to catholic-church.org,
{{quote|The Ultimate Reality and Meaning of the Palamite theology consists of the distinction between God’s Essence and Energy.

The [[mystical theology|mystagogical]] teachings of hesychasm were approved in the Orthodox Church by a series of local [[Fifth Council of Constantinople|Hesychast councils]] in the 14th century, and Gregory's commemoration during the liturgical season of [[Great Lent]] is seen as an extension of the [[Sunday of Orthodoxy]].&lt;ref name=Fortescue&gt;{{Citation  | last = Fortescue  | first = Adrian  | title = Hesychasm  | publisher = Robert Appleton Company  | year = 1910  | location = New York  | volume = VII  | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07301a.htm  | accessdate = 2008-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vailhe&gt;"No doubt the leaders of the party held aloof from these vulgar practices of the more ignorant monks, but on the other hand they scattered broadcast perilous theological theories. Palamas taught that by asceticism one could attain a corporal, i.e. a sense view, or perception, of the Divinity. He also held that in God there was a real distinction between the Divine Essence and Its attributes, and he identified grace as one of the Divine propria making it something uncreated and infinite. These monstrous errors were denounced by the Calabrian Barlaam, by Nicephorus Gregoras, and by Acthyndinus. The conflict began in 1338 and ended only in 1368, with the solemn canonization of Palamas and the official recognition of his heresies. He was declared the 'holy doctor' and 'one of the greatest among the Fathers of the Church', and his writings were proclaimed 'the infallible guide of the Christian Faith'. Thirty years of incessant controversy and discordant councils ended with a resurrection of polytheism" ([http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06752a.htm Simon Vailhé, "Greek Church" in ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orthodox views==

===Essence and energy===
In Eastern Orthodox theology God's essence is called ''[[ousia]]'', "all that subsists by itself and which has not its being in another", and is distinct from his energies (''[[energeia]]'' in Greek, actus in Latin) or activities as actualized in the world.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristotle East and West'' by David Bradshaw, pp. 91, 95 Cambridge University Press (27 December 2004) {{ISBN|978-0-521-82865-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ousia of God is God as God is. The essence, being, nature and substance of God as taught in Eastern Christianity is uncreated, and cannot be comprehended in words. According to Lossky, God's ousia is "that which finds no existence or subsistence in another or any other thing".&lt;ref name="Eastern Church 1997"&gt;''The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church'', by Vladimir Lossky, SVS Press, 1997, pp. 50–55, {{ISBN|0-913836-31-1}}, (James Clarke &amp; Co. Ltd., 1991. {{ISBN|0-227-67919-9}})&lt;/ref&gt; God's ousia has no necessity or subsistence that needs or is dependent on anything other than itself.&lt;ref name="Eastern Church 1997"/&gt; 

It is the energies of God that enable us to experience something of the Divine, at first through sensory perception and then later intuitively or [[noesis|noetically]]. As St [[John Damascene]] states, "all that we say positively of God manifests not his nature but the things about his nature."&lt;ref&gt;''The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church'', by Vladimir Lossky, SVS Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-913836-31-1}} (James Clarke &amp; Co. Ltd., 1991, p. 73, {{ISBN|0-227-67919-9}})&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distinction between essence and energy===

====Real distinction====
According to Fr. [[John Romanides]], Palamas considers the distinction between God's essence and his energies to be a "real distinction", as distinguished from the [[Thomism|Thomistic]] "virtual distinction" and the [[Scotism|Scotist]] "formal distinction". Romanides suspects that Barlaam accepted a "formal distinction" between God's essence and his energies.&lt;ref name="roman"&gt;John S.

According to Lossky, if we deny the real distinction between essence and energy, we cannot fix any clear borderline between the procession of the divine persons (as existences and/or realities of God) and the creation of the world: both the one and the other will be equally acts of the divine nature (strictly uncreated from uncreated). The being and the action(s) of God then would appear identical, leading to the teaching of [[Pantheism]].&lt;ref&gt;"If we deny the real distinction between essence and energy, we cannot fix any very clear borderline between the procession of the divine persons and the creation of the world: both the one and the other will be equally acts of divine nature. The being and the action of God would then appear to be identical and as having the same character of necessity, as is observed by St [[Mark of Ephesus]] (fifteenth century). We must then distinguish in God His nature, which is one; and three hypostases; and the uncreated energy which proceeds from and manifests forth the nature from which it is inseparable. If we participate in God in His energies, according to the measure of our capacity, this does not mean that in His procession ad extra God does not manifest Himself fully. God is in no way diminished in His energies; He is wholly present in each ray of His divinity."

====Modern interpretation====
A few scholars argue against describing Palamas's essence–energies distinction in God as a "real" distinction. Orthodox [[philosophical theology|philosophical theologian]] [[David Bentley Hart]] expresses doubt "that Palamas ever intended to suggest a ''real''&lt;!-- italics in source --&gt; distinction between God's essence and energies".&lt;ref&gt;David Bentley Hart, [https://books.google.com/books?id=i238ThZzszgC&amp;pg=PA204#v=onepage&amp;q=palamas%20%22real%20distinction%22&amp;f=false ''The Beauty of the Infinite''], p. 204, Eerdmans, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0802829214}}. Retrieved on 13 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; G. Philips argues that Palamas's distinction is not an "[[ontology|ontological]]" distinction but, rather, analogous to a "formal distinction" in the [[Scotism|Scotist]] sense of the term.&lt;ref name=Partakers243&gt;Michael J. Christensen, Jeffery A. Wittung (editors), [https://books.google.com/books?id=DgtUoMqm594C&amp;pg=PA243#v=onepage&amp;q=admissible%20pluralism&amp;f=false ''Partakers of the Divine Nature: The History and Development of Deificiation in the Christian Traditions''] (Associated University Presses 2007 {{ISBN|0-8386-4111-3}}), pp. 243–244, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 2007 {{ISBN|978-0838641118}}. Retrieved on 13 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] theological historian Fr. [[Aidan Nichols]], Palamas's essence–energies distinction is not a mere "formal" distinction "demanded by the limited operating capacities of human minds".&lt;ref name=nichols/&gt;

According to Anna N. Williams's study of Palamas, which is more recent than Bentley's and Philips's, in two passages (only) Palamas explicitly says God's energies are "as constitutively and ontologically distinct from the essence as are the three Hypostases", and in one place he makes explicit his view, repeatedly implied elsewhere, that the essence and the energies are not the same; but Williams contends that not even in these passages did Palamas intend to argue for an "ontological or fully real distinction", and that the interpretation of his teaching by certain polemical modern disciples of his is false.&lt;ref name=Partakers243/&gt;

===Orthodox criticism of Western theology===
{{See also|Eastern Orthodox – Roman Catholic theological differences}}

Eastern Orthodox theologians have criticized Western theology, especially the traditional [[scholasticism|scholastic]] claim that God is ''[[actus purus]]'', for its alleged incompatibility with the essence–energies distinction. Christos Yannaras writes, "The West confuses God's essence with his energy, regarding the energy as a property of the divine essence and interpreting the latter as "pure energy" (actus purus)"&lt;ref&gt;Christos Yannaras, ''Orthodoxy and the West: Hellenic Self-Identity in the Modern Age'' (Holy Cross Orthodox Press, 2006), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; According to George C. Papademetriou, the essence–energies distinction "is contrary to the Western confusion of the uncreated essence with the uncreated energies and this is by the claim that God is Actus Purus".&lt;ref&gt;George C. Papademetriou, ''Introduction to St. Gregory Palamas'' (Holy Cross Orthodox Press, 2004), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman Catholic perspectives==
The Roman Catholic Church distinguishes between doctrine, which is single and must be accepted by Roman Catholics, and theological elaborations of doctrine, about which Catholics may legitimately disagree. With respect to the Eastern and Western theological traditions, the Catholic Church recognizes that, at times, one tradition may "come nearer to a full appreciation of some aspects of a mystery of revelation than the other, or [express] it to better advantage."  In these situations, the Church views the various theological expressions "often as mutually complementary rather than conflicting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19641121_unitatis-redintegratio_en.html |title=UnitatisRedintegratio |quote=In the study of revelation East and West have followed different methods, and have developed differently their understanding and confession of God's truth. It is hardly surprising, then, if from time to time one tradition has come nearer to a full appreciation of some aspects of a mystery of revelation than the other, or has expressed it to better advantage. In such cases, these various theological expressions are to be considered often as mutually complementary rather than conflicting. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306113628/http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19641121_unitatis-redintegratio_en.html |archivedate=6 March 2013 |df=dmy }} A concrete example of the application of this principle is the separate presentation in the 1912 ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' [http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Blessed_Trinity%2C_The article on the Blessed Trinity] of the Church's doctrine on the Trinity as interpreted in Greek theology and in Latin theology, without denigrating either interpretation.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Meyendorff, from Palamas's time until the twentieth century, Roman Catholic theologians {{who|date=December 2014}} generally rejected the idea that there is in God a real essence–energies distinction. In their view, a real distinction between the essence and the energies of God contradicted the teaching of the [[First Council of Nicaea]]&lt;ref name=Meyendorff&gt;John Meyendorff (editor), [https://books.google.com/books?id=8jcjtUbwptwC&amp;lpg=PR11&amp;pg=PR11#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Palamas%20is%20a%20saint%22&amp;f=false ''Gregory Palamas – The Triads''], p. xi.

Retrieved on 12 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; on [[monotheism|divine unity]].&lt;ref name=Vailhe/&gt; Catholic theologian [[Ludwig Ott]] held that an absence of real distinction between the [[Attributes of God in Christianity|attributes of God]] and God's essence is a dogma of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="LudwigOtt"&gt;"In distinguishing between God and His attributes, one is going against a doctrine of the faith: 'The Divine Attributes are really identical among themselves and with the Divine Essence' (''De fide''). The reason lies in the absolute simplicity of God. The acceptance of a real distinction (distinctio realis) would lead to acceptance of a composition in God, and with that to a dissolution of the Godhead. In the year 1148, a [[Council of Reims (1148)|Synod at Rheims]], in the presence of Pope Eugene III, condemned, on the instance of St. Bernard of Clairvaux, the doctrine of Gilbert of Poitiers, who, according to the accusation of his opponents, posited a real difference between Deus and Divinitas, so that there would result a quaternity in God (Three Persons plus Godhead). This teaching, which is not obvious in Gilbert's writings, was rejected at the Council of Rheims (1148) in the presence of Pope Eugene III ([http://www.catecheticsonline.com/SourcesofDogma4.php D. 389] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120225346/http://www.catecheticsonline.com/SourcesofDogma4.php |date=20 January 2011 }} et seq.)"

In contrast, Jürgen Kuhlmann argues that the Roman Catholic Church never judged Palamism to be heretical, adding that Palamas did not consider that the distinction between essence and energies in God made God composite.&lt;ref name=Partakers243/&gt; According to Kuhlmann, "the denial of a real distinction between essence and energies is not an article of Catholic faith".&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Mowry LaCugna, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6c_YAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=palamas+%22real+distinction%22 ''God for Us: The Trinity and Christian Life''], p. 200. HarperSanFrancisco, 1991, {{ISBN|9780060649128}}. Retrieved on 12 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Meyendorff, the later twentieth century saw a change in the attitude of Roman Catholic theologians to Palamas, a "rehabilitation" of him that has led to increasing parts of the Western Church considering him a saint, even if uncanonized.&lt;ref name=Meyendorff/&gt; Some Western scholars maintain that there is no conflict between the teaching of Palamas and Roman Catholic thought on the distinction.&lt;ref name=Partakers243/&gt; According to G. Philips, the essence–energies distinction of Palamas is "a typical example of a perfectly admissible theological pluralism" that is compatible with the Roman Catholic magisterium.&lt;ref name=Partakers243/&gt; Jeffrey D. Finch claims that "the future of East-West rapprochement appears to be overcoming the modern polemics of neo-scholasticism and neo-Palamism".&lt;ref name=Partakers243/&gt; Some Western theologians have incorporated the essence–energies distinction into their own thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Kallistos Ware [https://books.google.com/books?id=ognCKztR8a4C&amp;pg=PA186#v=onepage&amp;q=hesychasm%20catholic&amp;f=false ''Oxford Companion to Christian Thought'']; (Oxford University Press 2000 {{ISBN|0-19-860024-0}}), p. 186.

==Protestant views==

===Kierkegaard and the relationship to existentialism===
{{see also|Christian existentialism}}

The Danish [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]], widely considered the father of [[existentialism]], expressed (pseudonymously as John Climacus) in ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments]]'' an approach to God which holds that the Father's ''[[hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis]]'' (existence) has logical primacy over his ''[[ousia]]'' (essence or substance). Hence the teaching that the core of existentialist philosophy can be understood as the maxim, "[[philosophy of existence|existence before essence]]." This has caused many Western observers to see Eastern Orthodox Christian theology as existentialistic (since the Essence–Energies distinction also somewhat holds the view).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lZUBZlth2qgC&amp;lpg=PA418&amp;pg=PA418#v=snippet&amp;q=%22three%20central%20issues%22&amp;f=false The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 5] By Erwin Fahlbusch p. 418. Eerdmans Publishing, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0802824172}}. Retrieved on 21 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This also accounts for other existentialist works such as [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]'s ''[[Notes from Underground]]''. In the case of Dostoevsky, his existentialist outlook would have drawn from his Russian Orthodox faith, but there is no record of Dostoevsky (and the Eastern Orthodox church in general) being exposed to or influenced by Kierkegaard's philosophical works.

'''''Gavāṃpati''''' is a disciple of the Buddha, one of the first ten to be ordained and to have known the state of [[Arhat]]. In Southeastern Buddhism, Gavāṃpati has become a preeminent character. In [[Thailand]], [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]], and the [[Shan states]], the Mon cult of Gavampati has survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Buddhism|last = Buswell|first = Robert E.|publisher = Macmillan Reference USA|year = 2004|isbn = 978-0028657189|location = New York|pages = 301–302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Giuseppe Siri''' (20 May 1906 – 2 May 1989) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] of the [[Catholic Church]] who served as [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Genoa|Archbishop of Genoa]] from 1946 to 1987, and was elevated to the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinalate]] in 1953 by [[Pope Pius XII]]. Some [[sedevacantist]] groups believe a conspiracy theory known as the [[Siri thesis]], which states that Siri was elected during the [[1958 papal conclave]] that elected Angelo Roncalli as [[John XXIII]]. Siri never held these views and accepted the authority of [[John XXIII]], [[Paul VI]], [[John Paul I]], and [[John Paul II]].

==Early life and ministry==
Siri was born in [[Genoa]] to Nicolò and Giulia (née Bellavista) Siri. He entered the [[minor seminary]] of Genoa on 16 October 1916, and attended the [[Seminary|major seminary]] from 1917 to 1926. Siri then studied at the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]] in [[Rome]], and was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] to the [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priesthood]] by Archbishop [[Carlo Minoretti]] on 22 September 1928. Finishing his studies at the Gregorian, he earned his [[Licentiate of Sacred Theology|doctorate in theology]] ''[[Latin honors|summa cum laude]]'' and also did [[Parish (Catholic Church)|pastoral]] work in Rome until autumn 1929.

Upon returning to Genoa, he served as a [[chaplain]] until he became a [[professor]] of [[dogmatic theology]] at the major seminary in 1930, also teaching fundamental [[theology]] for a year. In addition to his academic duties, Siri was a preacher, conferencist (public speaker), and professor of religion at the [[Liceo_classico|classical lyceum]]s named to ''Andrea Doria'' and ''Giuseppe Mazzini'' from 1931 to 1936. He was named [[Synod|prosynodal]] examiner in the [[Diocese|archdiocesan]] [[Curia (Roman Catholic Church)|curia]] in 1936 and [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of ''Collegio Teologico S. Tommaso d'Aquino'' in 1937.

==Episcopal career==
[[File:Pio XII impone la berretta cardinalizia a Giuseppe Siri.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Pope Pius XII bestows the red [[biretta]] upon Siri in 1953.]]
On 14 March 1944, Siri was appointed [[Auxiliary bishop|Auxiliary Bishop]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Genoa|Genoa]] and [[Titular bishop|Titular Bishop]] of ''[[Livias (titular see)|Livias]]'' by [[Pope Pius XII]]. He received his [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|episcopal consecration]] on the following 7 May from Cardinal [[Pietro Boetto]], [[Society of Jesus|SJ]], at the [[Genoa Cathedral|St. Lawrence Cathedral]]. He became [[vicar general]] for the Archdiocese on 8 September 1944. During his tenure as an auxiliary, he was a member of the [[Italian resistance movement]] in [[World War II]]. He negotiated with the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi forces]] surrounding Genoa and met secretly with partisan leaders, eventually arranging a Nazi surrender that avoided further [[bombardment]] of the city.

Following the death of Cardinal Boetto, Siri was named [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Genoa|Archbishop of Genoa]] on 14 May 1946, and [[Enthronement|installed]] on 29 May of that year. Pius XII created him [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal-Priest]] of [[Santa Maria della Vittoria, Rome]] in the [[Papal consistory|consistory]] of 12 January 1953. At the time of his elevation, he was the youngest member of the [[College of Cardinals]]. He became known as the "[[minestrone]] cardinal" for his [[Humanitarian aid|relief work]] in [[soup kitchen]]s.

Siri was noted for his staunchly [[Conservatism|conservative]] views. At the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962–1965), he sat on its Board of Presidency and, alongside Archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]] and Cardinals [[Alfredo Ottaviani]] and [[Thomas Cooray]], he was part of the association of traditionalist Council fathers named ''[[Coetus Internationalis Patrum]]''. However, Siri once said, "I would describe myself as an independent, a man who walks alone and is not a member of any group."&lt;ref&gt;New York Times [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/03/obituaries/giuseppe-cardinal-siri-of-genoa-is-dead-at-82.html Giuseppe Cardinal Siri Of Genoa Is Dead at 82] May 3, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; He was also opposed to [[Collegiality#Collegiality in the Catholic Church|collegiality]]&lt;ref name=Foreign/&gt; and innovation.&lt;ref name=Princes&gt;Time Magazine. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,895979-3,00.html The Princes of the Church] March 30, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope John XXIII]] named Siri the first President of the [[Conferenza Episcopale Italiana|Italian Episcopal Conference]] on 12 October 1959. He remained in that post until 1965. Siri, who had voted in the [[Papal conclave|conclaves]] of [[Papal conclave, 1958|1958]] and [[Papal conclave, 1963|1963]], was also one of the [[Cardinal electors in Papal conclaves, August and October 1978|cardinal electors]] in the [[Papal conclave, August 1978|August]] and [[Papal conclave, October 1978|October 1978]] conclaves. He was a strong candidate for the [[Pope|papacy]], or ''[[papabile]]'', in all four conclaves, in which his support lay mostly with [[Roman Curia|Curialists]] and other conservative cardinals.&lt;ref name=Princes/&gt; Media reports&lt;ref&gt;National Catholic Reporter. [http://www.nationalcatholicreporter.org/update/conclave/how_to.htm How a Pope is Elected] 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Time Magazine. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946069-2,00.html How Pope John Paul I Won] September 11, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that Siri in fact topped the first count of votes in the August 1978 conclave before losing to [[Pope John Paul I|Albino Luciani]], who became Pope John Paul I. Following John Paul I's death, Siri was the leading conservative candidate in opposition to Cardinal [[Giovanni Benelli]], the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Florence|Archbishop of Florence]] and leading [[Liberalism|liberal]] candidate. [[Vaticanologist]]s suggested that the eventual winner, [[Pope John Paul II|Cardinal Wojtyła]], who became Pope John Paul II, was chosen as a compromise candidate between the two. Shortly afterwards, Siri implied that he disapproved of Wojtyła's election.&lt;ref name=Foreign&gt;Time Magazine. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,912229-2,00.html A "Foreign" Pope] October 30, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

In a biography of Cardinal Siri, [[Nicla Buonasorte]] reports that Siri was a friend of Archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]], but disapproved of what the newspaper report on the book called his [[Schism (religion)|schismatic]] undertakings. Up to the last minute he begged him ("on his knees", the Cardinal wrote) not to break from [[Holy See|Rome]], but finally accepted that [[excommunication]] of the dissident bishop was unavoidable.
Buonasorte commented: "In all probability, it is due to Siri that Lefebvre had no significant following in Italy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2006/dicembre/13/Siri_cardinale_dell_Ostpolitik_segreta_co_9_061213007.shtml ''Siri, il cardinale dell'Ostpolitik segreta''] in [[Corriere della Sera]], 13 December 2006. Quote: "fu amico fraterno di monsignor Marcel Lefebvre, ma disapprovò le sue iniziative scismatiche e lo scongiurò fino all'ultimo («in ginocchio», gli scrisse) di non staccarsi da Roma. Infine ammise che non c' erano alternative alla scomunica del vescovo dissidente. «A Siri - osserva la sua biografa - si deve, con tutta probabilità, la mancanza di un seguito significativo di Lefebvre in Italia»."&lt;/ref&gt;

The same book recalls how Siri seems to have turned a blind eye to the assistance given by one or two of his clergy to members of the [[Nazism|German National Socialist Party]], including [[Adolf Eichmann]], fleeing to [[South America]] after the [[Second World War]]. It stresses, however, that this was out of compassion for people in difficulties, and quite unconnected with his well-known conservative views, in spite of which he conducted a personal "[[Ostpolitik]]" of contacts with the Soviet embassy in favour of the Church in Eastern Europe, without informing Pius XII of these contacts. Cardinal Siri during the war had supported [[Democrazia Cristiana|Christian-Democrat]] Italian [[resistance movement|resistance]] financially and morally.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} He also aided and sheltered some of his [[priest]]s who tried to help rescue threatened [[Jews]] to safety in Franco's [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] [[Spain under Franco|Spain]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

[[File:Genova-cattedrale di san lorenzo-tomba Giuseppe Siri.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Siri's tomb in the Genoa Cathedral.]]
Siri reached age 80 in 1986 and thus lost the right to participate in future conclaves; he was the last remaining cardinal elector who had been elevated by Pope Pius XII. Siri resigned from his post in Genoa on 6 July 1987, after 41 years of service. He died in Villa Campostano, Genoa, at age 82, and was buried at San Lorenzo metropolitan cathedral in Genoa.

==Conclave speculation==
{{main|Siri thesis}}
Siri was considered a strong candidate in the [[1958 papal conclave]] held to elect a successor to replace [[Pius XII]]&lt;ref name=Cuneo/&gt; On the evening of 26 October, the first day of the conclave, apparent [[white smoke]] was seen coming from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel, a traditional signal to the crowds in the square outside that a pope has been elected.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Tablet]]''. 1 November 1958. Quoted in {{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Paul|title=The Vatican Exposed: Money, Murder, and the Mafia|date=2009|page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; No announcement was made, however, and after about half an hour, the smoke turned black, indicating that there was no result. Vatican Radio corrected its report.&lt;ref name=Cuneo/&gt;

Sometime in the late 1980s, an American [[traditionalist Catholic]] named Gary Giuffre began to expound the belief that Siri was the true pope, and that he was held captive in a monastery in Rome.&lt;ref name=Cuneo&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cuneo|first1=Michael W.|title=The Smoke of Satan: Conservative and Traditionalist Dissent in Contemporary American Catholicism|date=1999|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=0801862655|pages=84–5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8OL9tyvN5YcC&amp;pg=PA84|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Giuffre and his followers, the white smoke that was seen on 26 October 1958 did indeed mean that a pope had been elected, and that pope was Siri, but Siri was forced to reject the papacy because of threats from outside the conclave. Roncalli, who they claimed was a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]], was elected instead as [[Pope John XXIII]].&lt;ref name=Cuneo/&gt; It was also claimed that this occurred during the [[1963 conclave]] that elected Giovanni Battista Montini  as [[Pope Paul VI]].&lt;ref name=Cuneo/&gt;

Siri himself never made these claims, and accepted the authority of all popes in his lifetime. He was appointed president of the [[Italian Episcopal Conference]] by Pope John in 1959, and remained in the post under Pope Paul until 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cardinale|first1=Gianne|title=The Italian Episcopal Conference and its Presidents|journal=[[30 Days (magazine)|30 Giorni]]|date=February 2007|url=http://www.30giorni.it/articoli_id_13529_l3.htm|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a candidate for pope in the 1978 conclave that followed the death of Paul VI, where he is thought to have led in the early ballot, but the conclave eventually elected Albino Luciani as [[Pope John Paul I]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Allen|first1=John L. Jr.|title=How a pope is elected|url=http://www.nationalcatholicreporter.org/update/conclave/how_to.htm|accessdate=23 April 2017|work=[[National Catholic Reporter]]|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again two months later in the [[Papal conclave, October 1978|October 1978 conclave]], where he is also thought to have come within a few votes of election before the eventual election of Karol Wojtyła as [[Pope John Paul II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pham|first1=John-Peter|title=Heirs of the Fisherman: Behind the Scenes of Papal Death and Succession|date=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195346351|page=131|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ahTU3koVfLEC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Siri never made any reference to the "Siri thesis", nor was there any mention of it in his ''New York Times'' obituary,&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|title=Giuseppe Cardinal Siri Of Genoa Is Dead at 82|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/03/obituaries/giuseppe-cardinal-siri-of-genoa-is-dead-at-82.html|accessdate=23 April 2017|work=New York Times|agency=AP|date=3 May 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the biography written by [[Raimondo Spiazzi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Raimondo |last=Spiazzi |title=Il Cardinale Giuseppe Siri |publisher=Studio Dominicani |place=Bologna |date=1990 |language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in a speech given by [[Giulio Andreotti]] on the centenary of Siri's birth in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andreotti|first1=Giulio|authorlink1=Giulio Andreotti|title=Defender of Tradition and of workers’ rights|journal=30 Days|date=2006|issue= 4|url=http://www.30giorni.it/articoli_id_10414_l3.htm|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Jainism}}
The '''Godha''' are [[Jain]] caste people found in the state of [[Gujarat]] in [[India]] having roots in Rajasthan. The Godha are [[Jain]]. They are also known as Gondha and Gonda. The Godha sometimes (depending on region) use Dengar as a community surname.&lt;ref name="people_of_india_xxi"&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXI  Part One edited by R.B Lal, P.B.S.V Padmanabham, G Krishnan &amp; M Azeez Mohideen pages 418-421&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and origin==
The Godha are descended from a group of [[Gondi people]] tribals that migrated from [[Madhya Pradesh]] some five centuries ago. They are mainly distributed in [[Surat District|Surat]], [[Valsad District|Valsad]] and [[Rajasthan]].

==Present circumstances==
The Godha practice community [[endogamy]]. They have no system of clans, or clan hierarchy. They are present in almost every sector now. Many are now involved in a number of occupations such tailoring, the diamond cutting industry, and many more.

[[File:Meiji Shrine Sando and Torii New Year Worship.jpg|thumb|250px|Crowded [[Meiji Shrine]] for ''hatsumōde'']]
{{nihongo|'''''Hatsumōde'''''|初詣|hatsumōde}} is the first [[Shinto shrine]] visit of the [[Japanese New Year]]. Some people visit a [[Buddhist temple]] instead. Many visit on the first, second, or third day of the year as most are off work on those days. Generally, wishes for the new year are made, new ''[[omamori]]'' (charms or [[amulet]]s) are bought, and the old ones are returned to the shrine so they can be burned. There are often long lines at major shrines throughout Japan.

Most of the people in Japan are off work from December 29 until January 3 of every year. It is during this time that the house is cleaned, debts are paid, friends and family are visited and gifts are exchanged. It would be customary to spend the early morning of New Year's Day in domestic worship, followed by [[sake]]—often containing edible [[gold]] flakes—and special celebration food. During the ''hatsumōde'', it is common for men to wear a full [[kimono]]—one of the rare chances to see them doing so across a year{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}. The act of worship is generally quite brief and individual and may involve queuing at popular shrines. The ''o-mamori'' vary substantially in price.

Some shrines and temples have millions of visitors over the three days. [[Meiji Shrine]] for example had 3.45 million visitors in 1998, and in the first three days of January 2010, 3.2 million people visited Meiji Jingū, 2.98 million [[Narita-san]], 2.96 million [[Kawasaki Daishi]], 2.7 million [[Fushimi Inari-taisha]], and 2.6 million [[Sumiyoshi Taisha]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asianinfo.org/asianinfo/japan/society_celebrations.htm Japan's Society Celebrations - Hatsumōde] accessed on December 29, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.japantimes.co.jp/yen-for-living/tag/hatsumode/ |title='Tis the season for shrines and temples to rake it in |publisher=[[The Japan Times]] |date=3 January 2011 |accessdate=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other popular destinations include [[Atsuta Jingū]], [[Tsurugaoka Hachimangū]], [[Dazaifu Tenman-gū]], and [[Hikawa Shrine (Saitama)|Hikawa Shrine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=1069 |title=Encyclopedia of Shinto - Hatsumōde |publisher=[[Kokugakuin University]] |accessdate=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common custom during ''hatsumōde'' is to buy a written [[oracle]] called ''[[omikuji]]''. If your ''omikuji'' predicts bad luck you can tie it onto a tree on the shrine grounds, in the hope that its prediction will not come true. The ''omikuji'' goes into detail, and tells you how you will do in various areas in your life, such as business and love, for that year. Often a good-luck charm comes with the ''omikuji'' when you buy it, that is believed to summon good luck and money your way.

'''History of the Jews in Carthage''' refers to the history and presence of people of [[Jews|Jewish]] ancestry in [[ancient Carthage]].

Carthage (from the [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] ''Kart-Hadasht'', the "New City", written without vowels in [[Punic]] as ''Qrthdst'') was a city in [[North Africa]] located on the eastern side of [[Lake Tunis]], across from the center of modern [[Tunis]] in [[Tunisia]]. It remains a popular tourist attraction.

There are a number of varying opinions held by historians and scholars as to exactly when Jews came to Carthage and what role they played in the rise and subsequent life of the city, empire and culture associated with the name of Carthage and the Carthaginians, also known as the [[Punics]].

The [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] has a lengthy article about the "Jews in Carthage"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Movers, Phönicier, ii. part i. 142, 144, 350; Böttger, Lexikon zu den Schriften des Flavius Josephus, p. 79; Neubauer, G. T. p. 411; Krauss, Lehnwörter, ii. 572; Delattre, Gamart ou la Nécropole Juive de Carthage, Lyons, 1895; Rev. Et. Juives, xliv. 2-28.|title=Carthage: Josephus; In the Bible and the Talmud; Jews in Carthage; Under the Arabs|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/4085-carthage|publisher=Jewish Encyclopedia|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; tracing various links in sources or by Jews with Carthage:

*Ancient city and republic in northern Africa; of special interest to Jews on account of the [[Phoenicia|Phenico]]-[[Semitic people|Semitic]] origin of its inhabitants, its government under the suffetes, recalling the "[[Biblical judges|shofeṭim]]" (judges) among the [[Hebrews]], and on account of the religion of the inhabitants.
*The city, called קרת חדשת ("New City") in native inscriptions (Lidzbarski, "Nordsemitische Epigraphik," i. 365), is mentioned in Jewish writings since [[Talmud]]ic times only as קרתגיני ("Ḳarthigini"), a name equivalent to the [[Byzantine]] form Kαρϑαγένη and in agreement with the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] (Payne Smith, "Thes. Syr." cols. 3744, 3765), the Greek form Kαρχηδών being found with the latter.
*Notwithstanding the peculiar form, perhaps chosen with reference to the founder [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]] (קרתא + γυνή, "Woman-City"), the Hebrew word certainly designates Carthage in [[Africa]].
*[[Josephus Flavius]] writes Kαρχηδών like the Greeks. He says it is recorded in the public documents of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] that [[King Solomon]] built the [[Temple at Jerusalem]] 143 years and eight months before the Tyrians founded Carthage ("Contra Ap." i. § 17). Josephus intends to prove by this statement the antiquity of the Jewish people.
*Although Carthage is not mentioned in the Bible, modern scholars are inclined to identify the Biblical [[Tarshish]] with Carthage, since it is thus translated in the [[Septuagint]], the [[Targum]], and the [[Vulgate]], Ezek. xxvii. 12.
*In 692 the city was wrested from the Christians by Ḥasan, a general of the calif '[[Abd al-Malik]], and in 698 the Greeks were permanently driven from Carthage and Africa by Musa (Weil, "Gesch. der Chalifen," i. 478). Previous to this the Arabs had founded the city [[Kairouan|Ḳairwan]], which became as important to the Jews as Carthage had been. 
*The fact that the Talmud mentions the Carthaginian teachers of the Law, R. Abba, R. Isaac, and R. Ḥana, proves that Jews were living in that city...
*It is evident from the introduction to the work "[[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume III/Apologetic/An Answer to the Jews|Adversum Judæos]]," ascribed to [[Tertullian]], that Jews were living in Carthage; and they are found still further west (Schürer, "Gesch." 3d ed., iii. 26, note 64). Münter ("Primordia Eccl. Afric." p.&amp;nbsp;165, Copenhagen, 1829) mentions a certain R. Jisschak (the one in the Talmud?).
*The Jews of Africa are often referred to in the correspondence between [[Jerome]] and [[Augustine]]; and in recent times there has been found in [[Gamart]], near the city of Carthage, a great Jewish [[necropolis]] with many inscriptions in Latin.
*From the [[Battle of Carthage (439)|conquest]] of Carthage by the [[Vandals]] (439) to the subjection of the latter by the Byzantines (533), the holy vessels from the Temple of Jerusalem, that had been taken from Rome, were kept in Carthage (Evagrius, "Scholasticus," Fragment iv. p., 17; Procopius, "Bellum. Vand." ii. § 9).
*The Jews then passed under the rule of [[Justinian]], who instructed Solomon, the governor of Africa, to transform the synagogues as well as the churches of the [[Arians]] and the [[Donatists]] into orthodox churches (Novellæ, No. 37). Solomon, however, was soon compelled to flee from the rebellious Africans...Bibliography: Movers, Phönicier, ii. part i. 142, 144, 350; Böttger, Lexikon zu den Schriften des Flavius Josephus, p.&amp;nbsp;79; Neubauer, G.

:"There is no evidence of Jews in Carthage during the Punic period (before 146 B.C.E.); on the other hand, a number of modern scholars maintain that the expansion of the [[Phoenicians]] from [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]] owed something of its impetus to the collaboration of Hebrews from the Palestinian hinterland. Substantial Jewish settlement is known only from the time of the [[Roman Empire]]. Its existence is shown from inscriptions (mainly on tombstones) and from literary sources, especially those of the [[Church Fathers]]. The majority of Jewish inscriptions from Carthage (discovered in a cemetery excavated near the city) show that the language of its Jews was [[Latin]], although a few inscriptions are in Hebrew..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Monceaux, in: REJ, 44 (1902), 1–28; N.

Various Christian and general scholars have written about the Jews in Carthage, such as in a [[Cambridge University Press]] study on "The Jews in Carthage and Western North Africa, 66 - 235 CE"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Katz|first1=Steven T (Editor)|last2=Setzer|first2=Claudia|title=The Cambridge History of Judaism: Volume Four: The Late Roman Rabbinic Period (pp. 68-75)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BjtWLZhhMoYC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=Jews+and+Carthage&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=y0IZVKrAI86fggTdn4H4Dg&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Jews%20and%20Carthage&amp;f=false|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others who have delved into the topic from a variety of perspectives ranging from conventional to controversial perspectives.{{cn|date=February 2016}}

Carthage was founded from Tyre. According to the Bible, the city of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]], were part of the [[tribe of Asher]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;
″even unto great Zidon; And then the coast turneth to Ramah, and to the strong city Tyre″&lt;ref&gt;Joshua., 19:28-29&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The famous Arab historian and sociologist [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332–1406 years), who himself came from [[Tunisia]] (former center of [[Carthage|Carthage Power]]), in his books on the Berbers asserted that [[Berber people|Berber]] to convert to Islam, professed Judaism. Berbers rules [[Kahina]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://cyclowiki.org/wiki/%D0%9A%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%84%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B8 Карфагенские евреи]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Geneticists believe that the Jews founded Carthage and lived in it.{{Dubious|date=May 2017|reason=No evidence of claim substantiated in source; Carthaginians followed a polytheistic Canaanite faith.}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://failedmessiah.typepad.com/files/north-african-jewish-and-non-jewish-populations-form-distinctive-orthogonal-clusters.pdf North African Jewish and non-Jewish populations form distinctive, orthogonal clusters]&lt;/ref&gt; Found mosaic synagogue and cemetery Carthaginian Jews.

The '''[[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]]''' has been represented in '''[[Christian art]]''' both in the [[Eastern Church|Eastern]] and [[Western Church]]es using a variety of depictions.&lt;ref name=Earls70 &gt;''Renaissance art: a topical dictionary'' by Irene Earls 1987 {{ISBN|0-313-24658-0}} page 70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gardner349 &gt;''Gardner's art through the ages: the western perspective'' by Fred S. Kleiner {{ISBN|0-495-57355-8}} page 349&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lossky &gt;Vladimir Lossky, 1999 ''The Meaning of Icons'' {{ISBN|0-913836-99-0}} page 17&lt;/ref&gt;

The depictions have ranged from nearly identical figures that represent the three persons of the [[Holy Trinity]] from a dove to a flame.&lt;ref name=Eugene121/&gt;

The Holy Spirit is often depicted as a [[dove]], based on the account of the Holy Spirit descending like a dove on [[Baptism of Jesus|Jesus at his baptism]].&lt;ref name=Joel14/&gt; In many paintings of the [[Annunciation]], the Holy Spirit is shown in the form of a dove, coming down towards Mary on beams of light, as the [[Gabriel|Archangel Gabriel]] announces [[Christ]]'s coming to [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]].

A dove may also be seen at the ear of [[Saint Gregory the Great]]─as recorded by his secretary or other church father authors, dictating their works to them.

The dove also parallels the one that brought the olive branch to [[Noah]] after the deluge, as a symbol of peace.&lt;ref name=Joel14&gt;''We Believe in the Holy Spirit'' (Ancient Christian Doctrine, No. 4) by Joel C. Elowsky (Jul 13, 2009) InterVarsity {{ISBN|0830825347}} page 14&lt;/ref&gt;

The book of Acts describes the Holy Spirit descending on the [[twelve apostles|apostles]] at [[Pentecost]] in the form of a wind and tongues of fire resting over the apostles' heads. Based on the imagery in that account, the Holy Spirit is sometimes symbolized by a flame.&lt;ref name=Eugene121&gt;''The Holy Spirit: Classic and Contemporary Readings'' by Eugene F. Rogers Jr. (May 19, 2009) Wiley {{ISBN|1405136235}} pages 121-123&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also depictions of the Holy Spirit in the [[book of Genesis]]. In The [[Vatican Museums|Vatican]] Museum in Rome is a carved stone sarcophagus depicting the Holy Trinity as three bearded men during the creation of [[Eve]].&lt;ref name=Robert68&gt;''Early christian art and architecture'' by Milburn, R., &amp; Milburn, R. L. P. (1988) Los Angeles: University of California Press. {{ISBN|0520063260}} page 68&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of early Christian art depicts The Holy Spirit in an anthropomorphic form as a human with two other Identical human figures representing [[God the Father]] and [[Jesus Christ]]. They either sit or they stand grouped closely together. This is used to portray the unity of The Godhead.&lt;ref name=Jane546&gt;''Three Drawing in an Anglo-Saxon Pontifical: Anthropomorphic Trinity of Threefold Christ?'' by Rosenthal, J. E.

(2013) Academic Search Complete {{ISSN|0897-327X}} page 54-55&lt;/ref&gt;

The Holy Spirit is represented in various artistic mediums such as stained glass windows and calligraphy.&lt;ref name=Lois126&gt;''Christian Century'' by Huey-Heck, L. (2012)Academic Search Complete {{ISSN|0009-5281}} page 47&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''immured anchorite''', considered by many to be a myth,&lt;ref name=pressclub&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presscluboftibet.org/china-tibet-16/immured-anchorites.htm |title=Immured Anchorites- Tibetan Myths |publisher=Presscluboftibet.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Tibetan monk who has taken a vow to spend their life permanently sealed inside a small walled cell. The walled cell, only large enough for the monk to sit in meditation, has only a single stone that is moved to offer bread and water once a day. The cell has no windows and the monk spends his life in complete darkness.&lt;ref name=pressclub/&gt;

There have been Christian references to [[anchorite]]s who have immured themselves seeking a life of prayer and mediation. Usually there would be two holes in their cell, one attached to the church in order to hear and observe Mass and the other on the opposite side for visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftarchives.net/foote/crimes/c3.htm |title=Crimes of Christianity: Monkery |publisher=Ftarchives.net |date= |accessdate=2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of an immured anchorite was also used in the novel ''[[The Wheel of Darkness]]'' by [[Douglas Preston]] and [[Lincoln Child]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39028.The_Wheel_of_Darkness |title=The Wheel of Darkness (Pendergast, #8) by Douglas Preston — Reviews, Discussion, Bookclubs, Lists |publisher=Goodreads.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:KellsFol034rXRhoDet3.jpeg|right|thumb|250px|Detail of elaborate interlace from the [[Book of Kells]].]]
In the [[visual arts]], '''interlace''' is a decorative element found in  [[medieval art]]. In interlace, bands or portions of other [[motif (visual arts)|motif]]s are looped, [[braid]]ed, and [[knot]]ted in complex [[geometry|geometric]] patterns, often to fill a space. Interlacing is common in the [[Migration period art]] of [[Northern Europe]], especially in the [[Insular art]] of Ireland and the British Isles and [[Norse art]] of the [[Early Middle Ages]] and in [[Islamic interlace patterns|Islamic art]].

Intricate braided and interlaced patterns, called ''plaits'' in British usage, are found in late [[Roman art]] in many parts of Europe, in [[mosaic]] floors and other media.  [[Coptic art|Coptic manuscripts and textiles]] of 5th- and 6th-century Christian Egypt are decorated with broad-strand ribbon interlace ornament bearing a "striking resemblance" to the earliest types of knotwork found in the [[Insular art]] manuscripts of Ireland and the  [[British Isles]].&lt;ref name="M1"&gt;Mitchell et al. 1977, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and application==

[[File:Torque de Foxados - Detalle.JPG|thumb|left|Interlace and [[rotational symmetry]]: Iron Age ''Torque de Foxados'', Museo de [[Pontevedra]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]]]

===Northern Europe===
Interlace is a key feature of the "Style II" [[animal style]] decoration of Migration Period art, and is found widely across Northern Europe, and was carried by the [[Lombards]] into Northern Italy.  Typically the long "ribbons" eventually terminate in an animal's head.  By about 700 it becomes less common in most of Europe, but continues to develop in the British Isles and [[Scandinavia]], where it is found on metalwork, woodcarving, [[runestone]]s, [[high cross]]es, and [[illuminated manuscript]]s of the 7th to 12th centuries.  Artist [[George Bain (artist)|George Bain]] has characterised the early Insular knotwork found in the 7th-century [[Book of Durrow]] and the [[Durham Cathedral]] [[Gospel Book Fragment (Durham Cathedral Library, A. II. 10.)|Gospel Book fragment]] as "broken and rejoined" braids.&lt;ref&gt;Bain 1973, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Whether Coptic braid patterns were transmitted directly to [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Hiberno-Scottish]] [[monastery|monasteries]] from the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] or came via [[Lombards|Lombardic]] Italy is uncertain.&lt;ref name="M1" /&gt; Art historian [[James Johnson Sweeney]] argued for direct communication between the [[scriptorium|scriptoria]] of [[Early history of Ireland|Early Christian Ireland]] and the Coptic monasteries of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop 2001, p.270&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
This new style featured elongated beasts intertwined into symmetrical shapes, and can be dated to the mid-7th century based on the accepted dating of examples in the [[Sutton Hoo]] treasure.&lt;ref name="M1" /&gt;   The most elaborate interlaced [[zoomorphism|zoomorphics]] occur in [[Viking Age]] art of the [[Urnes style]] (arising before 1050), where tendrils of foliate designs intertwine with the stylized animals.&lt;ref&gt;Graham-Campbell 1980, pp. 150-151&lt;/ref&gt;

The full-flowering of Northern European interlace occurred in the [[Insular art]] of the British Isles, where the animal style ornament of Northern Europe blended with ribbon knotwork and Christian influences in such works as the ''[[Book of Kells]]'' and the [[Cross of Cong]].&lt;ref name="M1" /&gt;  Whole [[carpet page]]s were illuminated with abstract patterns, including much use of interlace, and stone [[high cross]]es combined interlace panels with figurative ones.  Insular interlace was copied in continental Europe, closely in the [[Franco-Saxon school]] of the 8th to 11th centuries, and less so in other [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] schools of illumination, where the tendency was to [[foliage|foliate]] decorative forms.  In [[Romanesque art]] these became typical, and the interlace generally much less complex.  Some animal forms are also found.

===Islamic art===
{{main|Islamic interlace patterns}}
Geometric interlacing patterns are common in Islamic ornament. They can be considered a particular type of [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]]. [[Umayyad architecture|Umayyad architectural]] elements such as floor [[mosaics]], window grilles, carvings and wall paintings, and decorative metal work of the 8th to 10th centuries are followed by the intricate interlacings common in later medieval [[Islamic art]]. Interlaced elaborations are also found in [[Kufic]] [[calligraphy]].

===Southern Europe===
Interlace and knotwork are often found in [[Byzantine art]], continuing Roman usage, but they are not given great prominence. One notable example of a widespread local usage of interlace is the [[Croatian wattle|three-ribbon interlace]] found in the [[Early middle ages|early]] [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|medieval Croatia]] on stone carvings from the 9th to 11th centuries.

'''James Davies''' (1767? &amp;ndash; 16 May 1860) was a Welsh baptist minister from Clydey, [[Pembrokeshire]]. As a boy he attended school in [[Carmarthen]], and services at Pant Teg Church ([[Newcastle Emlyn]]). By 1793 he was living in the Ffynnonhenry area, and was ordained minister there in 1794, and also at Horeb church, [[Rhydargaeau]]. However, during the schism of 1799 the two churches parted company, Ffynnonhenry remaining Calvinistic, and Rhydargaeau becoming a General Baptist church under Davies's charge.

He is known to have supported the Welsh Wesleyan mission to west Wales, and to have preached together with Moses Williams (d. 1819) to the Welsh Wesleyans at [[Carmarthen]] in 1806.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[John Edward Lloyd|Sir J.E.Lloyd]]|title=History of Carmarthenshire, vol 2|page=253|publisher=London Carmarthenshire Society|date=1935}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1820, Ffynnonhenry invited him to return, to become their joint pastor with David Evans (1778-1866), and he remained there for the next 40 years.

He died in Ffynnonbumsaint, aged 93, in 1860, and was buried in Ffynnonhenry burial ground.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6989">{{About|the custody of Jewish orphans in Europe after World War II|the forced conversion of Jewish orphans in Yemen|Orphans' Decree}}

The '''Jewish orphans controversy''' was a dispute about the custody of Jewish children after the end of [[World War II]]. Some Jewish children had been baptized while in the care of Catholic institutions or individual Catholics during the war. Such baptisms allowed children to be identified as Catholics to avoid deportation and incarceration in concentration camps, and likely death in the Holocaust. After the end of hostilities, [[Catholic Church]] officials, either [[Pope Pius XII]] or other prelates, issued instructions for the treatment and disposition of such Jewish children, some but not all of whom were now orphans. The rules they established, the authority that issued those rules, and their application in specific cases is the subject of investigations by journalists and historians.

In 2005, ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' published a document dated 20 November 1946 on the subject of Jewish children baptized in wartime France. The document ordered that baptized children, if orphaned, should be kept in Catholic custody and stated that the decision "has been approved by the Holy Father". Two Italian scholars, Matteo Luigi Napolitano and Andrea Tornielli, confirmed that the memorandum was genuine although the reporting by the ''Corriere della Sera'' was misleading, as the document had originated in the French Catholic Church archives rather than the Vatican archives and strictly concerned itself with children without living blood relatives that were supposed to be handed over to Jewish organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Dimitri | last=Cavalli | accessdate=  18 January 2018 | url= http://www.theamericanmag.com/article.php?article=387 | title=Pius's Children | work=The American | date=1 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope John XXIII|Angelo Roncalli]], later Pope John XXIII, was serving as [[Nuncio]] for France, and reportedly ignored this directive.&lt;ref name=nyt20050109&gt;{{cite news | work = New York Times | accessdate = 19 January 2018 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/09/world/saving-jewish-children-but-at-what-cost.html |title= Saving Jewish Children, but at What Cost? | date= 9 January 2005 | first1= Elaine |last1= Sciolino | first2= Jason | last2= Horowitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Jerusalem Report'', 7 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

A related case was the Finaly Affair, which occurred in France between 1945 and 1953. Cardinal [[Pierre-Marie Gerlier]] and abbé [[Roger Etchegaray]] attempted to settle a dispute over the custody of baptized Jewish children by transferring the Finaly children back to Spain and to Israel, where Jewish relatives were able to raise them.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce Block-Lazarus.

Pius XII personally intervened when a Polish Catholic woman, [[Leokadia Jaromirska]], later honored as one of the [[Righteous Among the Nations]] by Yad Vashem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 19 January 2018 | url = http://www.yadvashem.org/righteous/stories/jaromirska.html |title= Leokadia Jaromirska | date= | publisher=Yad Vashem }}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote him a letter seeking his permission to keep a young Jewish girl she had sheltered during the war. Pius denied her permission to do so and ordered the child returned to her father. He described it as her duty as a Catholic to return the child and to do so in goodwill and friendship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Peter |last= Hellman | title=Avenue of the Righteous | date=1980 | publisher= Atheneum }}{{page needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Peter |last= Hellman | title=The righteous Gentiles of the Holocaust: a Christian interpretation | date=1994 | publisher= Fortress Press }}{{page needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abe Foxman]] (born 1940), the national director of the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL), who had himself been baptized as a child and had been the subject of a custody battle, called for an immediate freeze on Pius's beatification process until the relevant [[Vatican Secret Archives|Vatican Archives]] and baptismal records were opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| publisher =Anti-Defamation League | url = http://www.adl.org/Interfaith/adl_vatican.asp  | title= ADL to Vatican: Open Baptismal Records and Put Pius Beatification on Hold | dead-url = yes | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104082209/http://www.adl.org/Interfaith/adl_vatican.asp |archive-date=4 January 2009 | date= 13 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that opening archives could 
allow orphans "an opportunity to discover their true origins and possibly a return to their original faith while providing a magnificent story of courage by Catholics. In the hell that was the Holocaust, this is one bright shining light."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | publisher = Anti-Defamation League | url = https://www.adl.org/news/op-ed/60-years-later-baptized-jews-deserve-truth-from-vatican | title = 60 Years Later, Baptized Jews Deserve Truth From Vatican | date = 23 January 2005 | first = Abraham H. | last= Foxman | accessdate = 19 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Foxman omitted this in later statements and ADL press releases concerning Pope Pius XII.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/main_Interfaith/Pope_Pius_Position.htm ADL Position on Pope Pius XII (September 18, 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of Christian metal artists''', including artists that played Christian metal at some point in their careers.

[[Christian metal]], which is also known as white metal or heavenly metal,{{sfn|Thompson|2000|pp=153–54}} is [[heavy metal music]] with a Christian message.

|"Practically all chess-players are born optimists [...] Those who believe in God count on divine help; the agnostics know that somehow or other it will turn out all right; whilst the atheists, who are of course the most superstitious, believe in luck. If this last statement seems a trifle high pitched then let me submit as evidence the case of Dr. Tartakower. An atheist if ever there was one, he fervently believed in luck, touched wood at appropriate moments and never, never walked under ladders."&lt;ref&gt;Harry Golombek, 'Chess: The eternal spring of hope', ''The Times'', 24 July 1971; pg. 7; Issue 58233; col E.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Nowhere for me had words Qur'anic or biblical taken on as much life as they had here in the Sahara, where, apart from the Word, there was nothing but rock, sky and sun."&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Collin reviewing Tayler's ''Valley of the Casbahs: A Journey Across the Moroccan Sahara'', ''The Guardian'' (London), 12 April 2003, Guardian Saturday Pages, Pg. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

|{{sortname|Frank J.|Tipler|Frank J. Tipler}}
|1947–
|Scientist
|American mathematical physicist and professor at [[Tulane University]].
|Although an atheist, Tipler believes 'God' will eventually exist in the last moments of the universe: 
"The theory is basically this: just as the Earth began with a Big Bang, so it will end, in a single point, which Tipler calls the Omega Point. And just as life on Earth began with a single cell which colonised the planet, so life at the end of time will, according to Tipler, "become omnipresent, omnipotent, and omniscient which are the three attributes of God". The Omega Point/God is the point of ultimate, infinite knowledge when the earth will be inhabited by beings who are, to all intents and purposes, computers. Tipler says they can be called beings because he defines life as information processing, as did the famous biologist Richard Dawkins, who called computers "biological objects". [...] &lt;br /&gt;
Tipler says his own viewpoint is that of an atheist. Though brought up a Christian fundamentalist, he rejected religion when he was 16, because the Church claimed the Earth was 6,000 years old, when he knew that it went back 4.6 billion years. [...] &lt;br /&gt;
Still, it seems excessively generous for the beings of the future to want to resurrect all of us. Tipler answers that they will be extremely intelligent beings, and therefore extremely curious, interested in all the variations that preceded them, from the very beginning, just as today's scientists are working to recreate the first single cell, in all its possible forms. "I think the evidence is very strong that this particular version of you and this particular version of me will actually be there in the future. It will be you and me emulated down to the atom." Why, he says, we might even end up repeating the whole interview."

This work, first published under the pseudonym William Hammon, was subsequently republished by Richard Carlile in 1826. In the pamphlet Turner declared that he was an atheist, though he did admit that the 'vis naturae', gravity, and matter's elasticity and repulsive powers demonstrated that the universe was permeated by 'a principle of intelligence and design' (ibid., 17).

The horrific pain that living beings inflict upon other living beings is part of a world created by a “good” God? Good God!

Why would God tinker? Doesn’t He know in advance the biological pathways that work? Isn’t a tinkering God one who loudly says “I am not”? And why would He say so if He existed?

These are biblical figures unambiguously identified in contemporary sources according to [[Scientific consensus|scholarly consensus]]. Biblical figures that are identified in artifacts of questionable authenticity, for example the [[Jehoash Inscription]] and the bullae of [[Baruch ben Neriah]], or who are mentioned in ancient but non-contemporary documents, such as [[David]] and [[Balaam]],&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Identified in the [[Tel Dan Stele]] and the [[Deir Alla Inscription]] respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; are excluded from this list.

==Hebrew Bible (Protocanonical Old Testament)==
[[File:Tilglath pileser iii.jpg|upright|right|thumb|Tiglath-Pileser III: [[stela]] from the walls of his palace ([[British Museum]], [[London]]).]]

The [[Hebrew Bible]], known in [[Judaism]] by the acronym ''Tanakh'', is the collection of ancient writings that are considered [[Sacred texts|sacred]] by both Jews and [[Christianity|Christians]]. They tell the story of the [[Jewish people]] and their ancestors, starting from the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation narrative]] and concluding near the end of the 5th century BCE.

Although the first mention of the name ''[[Land of Israel|Israel]]'' in [[Biblical archaeology|archaeology]] dates to the 13th century BCE,&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Philip R., ''In Search of Ancient Israel: A Study in Biblical Origins'', Bloomsbury T&amp;T Clark, 2015, p. 48 [https://books.google.com/books?id=HJIzCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA48]&lt;/ref&gt; contemporary information on the Israelite nation prior to the 9th century BCE is extremely sparse.&lt;ref name="Kelle"&gt;Kelle, Brad E., ''Ancient Israel at War 853–586 BC'', Osprey Publishing, 2007, pp. 8–9 [https://books.google.com/books?id=j5hX7ADoWNkC&amp;pg=PA8]&lt;/ref&gt; In the following centuries a small number of local Hebrew documents, mostly seals and [[Bulla (seal)|bullae]], mention biblical characters, but more extensive information is available in the royal inscriptions from neighbouring kingdoms, particularly [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylon]], [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyria]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]].&lt;ref name="Kelle"/&gt;

== Deuterocanonicals or biblical apocrypha ==
[[File:AlexanderIBalasAndCleopatraThea.jpg|thumb|[[Cleopatra Thea]] with her first husband, [[Alexander Balas]]]]
The [[deuterocanon]] consists of books and parts of books that are included in the Old Testament canon of the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and/or [[Roman Catholic]] churches, but are not part of the Jewish [[Tanakh]], and are regarded as [[apocrypha]]l by [[Protestant]]s. In contrast to the Tanakh, which is preserved in Hebrew (with some Aramaic parts), the deuterocanonical books are preserved mainly in [[Koine Greek]], though Hebrew and Aramaic fragments have been found among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].

While the deuterocanon describes events between the eighth and second centuries BCE, most historically identifiable people mentioned in the deuterocanon lived around the time of the [[Maccabean Revolt]] (167 – 160 BCE), by which time [[Judea]] had become part of the [[Seleucid Empire]]. Coins featuring the names of rulers had become widespread and many of them were inscribed with the year number in the [[Seleucid era]], allowing them to be dated precisely. First-hand information comes also from the Greek historian [[Polybius]] (c. 200 – c. 118 BCE), whose ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|Histories]]'' covers much of the same period as the [[Books of Maccabees]], and from Greek and Babylonian inscriptions.

==New Testament==

[[File:Cameo August BM Gem3577.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Blacas Cameo]] (20–50 CE) depicting Roman emperor [[Augustus]]]]
By far the most important and most detailed sources for first-century Jewish history are the works of Jewish historian [[Flavius Josephus]] (37 – c. 100 CE).&lt;ref&gt;Grabbe, Lester L., ''An Introduction to First Century Judaism: Jewish Religion and History in the Second Temple Period'', A&amp;C Black, 1996, p. 22 [https://books.google.com/books?id=DO6kT5RPuxgC&amp;pg=PA22]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Millar, Fergus, ''The Roman Near East, 31 BC–AD 337'', Harvard University Press, 1993, p. 70 [https://books.google.com/books?id=IA-YlZqHv90C&amp;pg=PA70]&lt;/ref&gt; These books mention many of the same prominent political figures as the New Testament books and are crucial for understanding the historical background of the emergence of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Louis H., ''Josephus, the Bible, and History'', Brill, 1989, p. 18 [https://books.google.com/books?id=lV70mR-E0DQC&amp;pg=PA18]&lt;/ref&gt; Josephus also mentions [[Jesus]] and the execution of [[John the Baptist]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFAntiq|Antiquities]], [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 5|Book XVIII Chr. 5 § 2]]&lt;/ref&gt; although he was not a contemporary of either. Apart from Josephus, information about some New Testament figures comes from Roman historians such as [[Tacitus]] and [[Suetonius]] and from ancient coins and inscriptions.

The central figure of the New Testament is [[Jesus of Nazareth]]. Despite ongoing debate concerning the authorship of many of its books, there is a consensus&lt;ref name="ErdComm"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFCoogan|Coogan et al., 2010]], p. 1973 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nc-i_pQsiW8C&amp;pg=RA2-PA240]&lt;/ref&gt; among modern scholars that at least some were written by a contemporary of Jesus,&lt;ref&gt;Murphy-O'Connor, Jerome, ''Paul: a critical life'', Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 4 [https://books.google.com/books?id=yTddaMGsuWMC&amp;pg=PA4]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cate, Robert L., ''One untimely born: the life and ministry of the Apostle Paul'' Mercer University Press, 2006, p. 48 [https://books.google.com/books?id=vMVwtMopjeUC&amp;pg=PA48]&lt;/ref&gt; namely the epistles of [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], parts of which are considered [[Authorship of the Pauline epistles#Undisputed epistles|undisputed]]. However, outside the New Testament, no contemporary references to Jesus are known, unless a very early dating is assumed of some uncanonical gospel such as the [[Gospel of Thomas]]. Nevertheless, some authentic first century and many second century writings exist in which Jesus is mentioned,&lt;ref group="n"&gt;These sources include (but are not limited to) ''1st century'': [[Pauline Epistles|Paul]], [[First Epistle of Peter|Peter]], [[Josephus on Jesus|Josephus]], [[First Epistle of Clement|Clement]] and the [[Synoptic Gospels]]; ''2nd century'': [[Tacitus on Christ|Tacitus]], [[Lucian on Jesus|Lucian]], [[Ignatius of Antioch]], [[Polycarp's letter to the Philippians|Polycarp]], [[Hegesippus (chronicler)|Hegesippus]], [[Justin Martyr]] and a number of [[New Testament apocrypha|apocryphal works]]. For dates of the New Testament books, see [[Dating the Bible#Table IV: New Testament]].&lt;/ref&gt; leading scholars to conclude that the [[historicity of Jesus]] is well established by historical documents.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Amy-Jill ed., Allison, Dale C. Jr. ed., Crossan, John Dominic ed.,  ''The Historical Jesus in Context'', Princeton University Press, 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HIp_0N3uPPcC&amp;pg=PA4] "''Most scholars agree that Jesus was baptized by John, (...) engaged in healings and exorcisms, taught in parables, (...) and was crucified by Roman soldiers during the governorship of Pontius Pilate (26–36 CE)''"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Graham Stanton|Stanton, Graham]], ''The Gospels and Jesus'' Oxford University Press, 2nd ed. 2002, p. 145. He writes: "''Today nearly all historians, whether Christians or not, accept that Jesus existed and that the gospels contain plenty of valuable evidence which has to be weighed and assessed critically.''"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bockmuehl, Markus N. A., ''The Cambridge companion to Jesus'', Cambridge University Press, 2001, p. 124 [https://books.google.com/books?id=vSehrtQpcYcC&amp;pg=PA124] "''The fact that Jesus existed, that he was crucified under Pontius Pilate (...) seems to be part of the bedrock of historical tradition. If nothing else, the non-Christian evidence can provide us with certainty on that score''"&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Shebna]] (or Shebaniah), royal steward of [[Hezekiah]]: only the last two letters of a name (''hw'') survive on the so-called Shebna lintel, but the title of his position ("over the house"  of the king) and the date indicated by the script style, have inclined many scholars to identify the person it refers to with Shebna.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch, Robert, ''[http://www.bib-arch.org/bar/article.asp?PubID=BSBA&amp;Volume=35&amp;Issue=3&amp;ArticleID=9 Tracking Down Shebnayahu, Servant of the King]'' in ''Biblical Archaeology Review'' May/Jun 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sheshonq I]], Pharaoh of Egypt, is normally identified with king [[Shishaq]] in the Hebrew Bible. The account of Shishaq's invasion in the 5th year of [[Rehoboam]] (1 Kings 14:25–28) is thought to correspond to an inscription found at Karnak of Shoshenq's campaign into Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Grabbe, Lester L., ''Israel in transition: from late Bronze II to Iron IIa (c. 1250–850 B.C.E.)'', Continuum International Publishing Group, 2010, p. 84 [https://books.google.com/books?id=agSC0aHvri0C&amp;pg=PA84]&lt;/ref&gt; However, a minority of scholars reject this identification.&lt;ref&gt;Schreiber, N., ''The Cypro-Phoenician pottery of the Iron Age'', Brill, 2003 p. 87 [https://books.google.com/books?id=0ITEc8yuYu4C&amp;pg=PA87]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tou (biblical figure)|Tou/Toi]], king of Hamath. Several scholars have argued that Tou/Toi, mentioned in 2 Samuel 8:9 and 1 Chronicles 18:9, is identical with a certain 'Taita', king of 'Palistin', known from inscriptions found in northern Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Steitler |first1= Charles|date= 2010 |title= The Biblical King Toi of Ḥamath and the Late Hittite State "P/Walas(a)tin" |journal= Bibische Notizen |issue= 146 |pages= 95 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The History of King David in Light of New Epigraphic and Archeological Data'', ([https://www.haifa.ac.il/index.php/en/11-english/news-english/900-the-history-of-king-david-in-light-of-new-epigraphic-and-archeological-data link]), website of University of Haifa, citing publications by [[Gershon Galil]] from 2013-2014&lt;/ref&gt; However, others have challenged this identification based on linguistic analysis and the uncertain dating of king Taita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Simon |first=Zsolt |editor-last=Csabai |editor-first=Zoltán |title=Studies in Economic and Social History of the Ancient Near East in Memory of Péter Vargyas |publisher=The [[University of Pécs]], Department of Ancient History |date= 2014 |pages=724–725 |chapter= Remarks on the Anatolian Background of the Tel Reḥov Bees and the Historical Geography of the Luwian States in the 10th c. BC |isbn=9789632367958 |url= http://www.academia.edu/7861592}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Uzziah]], king of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]. The writings of Tiglath-Pileser III may refer to him, but this identification is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Haydn, Howell M. ''[https://www.jstor.org/pss/4617145 Azariah of Judah and Tiglath-Pileser III]'' in ''Journal of Biblical Literature'', Vol. 28, No. 2 (1909), pp. 182–199&lt;/ref&gt; There is also an [[Uzziah#Uzziah Tablet|inscription]] that refers to his bones, but it dates from the 1st century CE.
* Zedekiah, son of Hananiah (Jeremiah 36:12). A seal was found of "Zedekiah son of Hanani", identification is likely, but uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Day, John ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=yM_X2yzRLx4C&amp;pg=PA376&amp;lpg=PA376&amp;dq=zedekiah+son+of+hananiah+seal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9UXwzA_MZR&amp;sig=eOB_V-DM1tjP87X0EWlUCaa_VDo&amp;hl=nl&amp;ei=unrYS9yuBeKdOPe3mcIG&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwBQ*v=onepage In search of pre-exilic Israel: proceedings of the Oxford Old Testament Seminar] p. 376&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deuterocanonicals or Biblical Apocrypha===
* [[Aretas I]], [[Nabataean kingdom|King of the Nabataeans]] ({{floruit}} c. 169 BCE), mentioned in {{Bibleverse|2 Macc.|5:8|NRSV}}, is probably referred to in an inscription from Elusa.&lt;ref&gt;Healey, John F., ''The Religion of the Nabataeans: A Conspectus'', Brill, 2001, p. 29 [https://books.google.com/books?id=coso-V3gCEAC&amp;pg=PA29]&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Testament===

* '[[Egyptian (prophet)|The Egyptian]]', who was according to Acts 21:38 the instigator of a rebellion, also appears to be mentioned by Josephus, although this identification is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Vanderkam, James C., in ''The Continuum History of Apocalypticism [https://books.google.com/books?id=7UlbWioOV7sC]'' (edited by McGinn, Bernard J.; Collins, John J.; Stein, Stephen J.), Continuum, 2003, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frankfurter, David, ''Pilgrimage and Holy Space in Late Antique Egypt [https://books.google.com/books?id=3yENB_dXAtwC]'', Brill, 1998, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sergius Paulus]] was proconsul of Cyprus (Acts 13:4–7), when [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] visited the island around 46–48 CE.&lt;ref name="BoA"&gt;Gill, David W. J. (ed.) &amp; Gempf, Conrad (ed.), ''The Book of Acts in Its Graeco-Roman Setting [https://books.google.com/books?id=W-L1DA1ptKQC]'' Wm. B. Eerdmans 1994, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; Although several individuals with this name have been identified, no certain identification can be made. One Quintus Sergius Paulus, who was proconsul of Cyprus probably during the reign of Claudius (41–54 CE) is however compatible with the time and context of Luke's account.&lt;ref name="BoA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bromiley, Geoffrey W. (ed.), ''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia Vol. III: K–P [https://books.google.com/books?id=Zkla5Gl_66oC]'' Wm. B. Eerdmans 1986, pp. 729–730 (entry ''Paulus, Sergius'')&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lysanias]], was tetrarch of [[Abila Lysaniou|Abila]] around 28 CE, according to Luke (3:1). Because Josephus only mentions a Lysanias of Abila who was executed in 36 BCE, some scholars have considered this an error by Luke. However, one inscription from Abila, which is tentatively dated 14–29 CE, appears to record the existence of a later tetrarch called Lysanias.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, C. M., ''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'', Wm. B. Eerdmans 1939, entry ''Lysanias  [http://www.internationalstandardbible.com/L/lysanias.html]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Leon, ''Luke: an introduction and commentary [https://books.google.com/books?id=1ngd8XtswdEC]'' Wm. B. Eerdmans 1988, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Theudas]].  The sole reference to Theudas presents a problem of chronology. In [[Acts of the Apostles]], [[Gamaliel]], a member of the [[sanhedrin]], defends the apostles by referring to Theudas (Acts 5:36–8). The difficulty is that the rising of Theudas is here given as before that of [[Judas of Galilee]], which is itself dated to the [[Census of Quirinius|time of the taxation]] (''c.'' 6–7 AD).  [[Josephus]], on the other hand, says that Theudas was 45 or 46, which is after Gamaliel is speaking, and long after Judas the Galilean.

The [[world]]'s principal [[religion]]s and spiritual traditions may be classified into a small number of major groups, although this is by no means a uniform practice. This theory began in the 18th century with the goal of recognizing the relative levels of civility in societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Tomoko |last=Masuzawa |title=The Invention of World Religions |location=Chicago [[University of Chicago Press]] |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-226-50989-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of religious categories==
[[File:Civilization and religion map 1821.jpg|thumb|300px|An 1821 map of the world, where "Christians, Mahometans, and Pagans" correspond to levels of civilization (the map makes no distinction between Buddhism and Hinduism).]]
[[File:1883 religions map.jpg|thumb|300px|An 1883 map of the world divided into colors representing "Christians, Buddhists, Hindus, Mohammedans and Pagans".]]

In world cultures, there have traditionally been many different groupings of religious belief. In [[Culture of India|Indian culture]], different religious philosophies were traditionally respected as academic differences in pursuit of the same truth. In [[Islam]], the [[Quran]] mentions three different categories: Muslims, the [[People of the Book]], and [[Idolatry|idol worship]]ers. Initially, Christians had a simple dichotomy of world beliefs: Christian civility versus foreign heresy or barbarity. In the 18th century, "[[heresy]]" was clarified to mean [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]];{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MwuUAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA62|title=Twentieth-Century Marxism: A Global Introduction|last=Glaser|first=Daryl|last2=Walker|first2=David M.|date=2007-09-12|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135979744|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[paganism]], this created a fourfold classification which spawned such works as [[John Toland]]'s ''Nazarenus, or Jewish, Gentile, and Mahometan Christianity'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/nazarenusorjewis00tola|title=Nazarenus, or, Jewish, gentile, and Mahometan Christianity : containing the history of the antient Gospel of Barnabas, and the modern Gospel of the Mahometans ... also the original plan of Christianity explain'd in the history of the Nazarens ... with the relation of an Irish manuscript of the four Gospels, as likewise a summary of the antient Irish Christianity|last=Toland|first=John|last2=La Monnoye|first2=Bernard de|date=1718-01-01|publisher=London : J. Brotherton, J. Roberts and A. Dodd}}&lt;/ref&gt; which represented the three [[Abrahamic religions]] as different "nations" or sects within ''religion'' itself, the "true [[monotheism]]."

[[Daniel Defoe]] described the original definition as follows: "Religion is properly the Worship given to God, but 'tis also applied to the Worship of Idols and false Deities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Quu3VvTFnnAC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=Religion+is+properly+the+Worship+given+to+God,+but+'tis+also+applied+to+the+Worship+of+Idols+and+false+Deities#v=onepage&amp;q=Religion%20is%20properly%20the%20Worship%20given%20to%20God,%20but%20'tis%20also%20applied%20to%20the%20Worship%20of%20Idols%20and%20false%20Deities&amp;f=false|title=The Invention of World Religions: Or, How European Universalism Was Preserved in the Language of Pluralism|last=Masuzawa|first=Tomoko|date=2012-04-26|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226922621|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the turn of the 19th century, in between 1780 and 1810, the language dramatically changed: instead of "religion" being synonymous with spirituality, authors began using the plural, "religions," to refer to both Christianity and other forms of worship. Therefore, [[Hannah Adams]]'s early encyclopedia, for example, had its name changed from ''An Alphabetical Compendium of the Various Sects...'' to ''A Dictionary of All Religions and Religious Denominations''.&lt;ref&gt;Masuzawa 2005. pp. 49–61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Quu3VvTFnnAC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=Religion+is+properly+the+Worship+given+to+God,+but+'tis+also+applied+to+the+Worship+of+Idols+and+false+Deities#v=onepage&amp;q=hannah%20adams&amp;f=false|title=The Invention of World Religions: Or, How European Universalism Was Preserved in the Language of Pluralism|last=Masuzawa|first=Tomoko|date=2012-04-26|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226922621|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1838, the four-way division of Christianity, Judaism, [[Mohammedan|Mahommedan]]ism (archaic terminology for [[Islam]]) and Paganism was multiplied considerably by [[Josiah Conder (editor and author)|Josiah Conder]]'s ''Analytical and Comparative View of All Religions Now Extant among Mankind''. Conder's work still adhered to the four-way classification, but in his eye for detail he puts together much historical work to create something resembling our modern Western image: he includes [[Druze]], [[Yazidi|Yezidi]]s, [[Mandaeism|Mandeans]], and [[Elam]]ites{{Clarify|date=April 2012|reason=What does he mean by that?

The modern meaning of the phrase "world religion," putting non-Christians at the same level as Christians, began with the 1893 [[Parliament of the World's Religions]] in [[Chicago]]. The Parliament spurred the creation of a dozen privately funded lectures with the intent of informing people of the diversity of religious experience: these lectures funded researchers such as [[William James]], [[D. T. Suzuki]], and [[Alan Watts]], who greatly influenced the public conception of world religions.&lt;ref&gt;Masuzawa 2005, 270–281&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latter half of the 20th century, the category of "world religion" fell into serious question, especially for drawing parallels between vastly different cultures, and thereby creating an arbitrary separation between the religious and the secular.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen R. L. Clark. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20019386 "World Religions and World Orders"]. ''[[Religious Studies (journal)|Religious studies]]'' 26.1 (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; Even history professors have now taken note of these complications and advise against teaching "world religions" in schools.&lt;ref&gt;Joel E. Tishken. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/495028 "Ethnic vs. Evangelical Religions: Beyond Teaching the World Religion Approach"]. ''The History Teacher'' 33.3 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Others see the shaping of religions in the context of the nation-state as the "[[invented traditions|invention of traditions]]."

* [[Indian religions]], originated in [[Greater India]] and partly of [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] origins, they tend to share a number of key concepts, such as [[dharma]], [[karma]], [[reincarnation]] among others. They are of the most influence across the [[Indian subcontinent]], East Asia, Southeast Asia, as well as isolated parts of Russia. The main Indian religions are [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Sikhism]]. 
* [[East Asian religions]] consist of several East Asian religions which make use of the concept of ''[[Tao]]'' (in Chinese) or ''[[Dō (philosophy)|Dō]]'' (in Japanese or Korean). They include many [[Chinese folk religion]]s, [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]], as well as [[Religion in Korea|Korean]] and [[Shinto|Japanese religion]] influenced by Chinese thought.

* Indigenous [[ethnic religion]]s, found on every continent, now marginalized by the major organized faiths in many parts of the world or persisting as undercurrents ([[folk religion]]s) of major religions.

==Religious demographics==
{{Further information|List of religious populations}}
{{Main category|Religious demographics}}

One way to define a major religion is by the number of current adherents. The population numbers by religion are computed by a combination of census reports and population surveys (in countries where religion data is not collected in census, for example the United States or France), but results can vary widely depending on the way questions are phrased, the definitions of religion used and the bias of the agencies or organizations conducting the survey. Informal or unorganized religions are especially difficult to count.

There is no consensus among researchers as to the best methodology for determining the religiosity profile of the world's population. A number of fundamental aspects are unresolved:

* Whether to count "historically predominant religious culture[s]"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

[[Beatification|Blessed]] '''Marguerite Bays''' (8 September 1815 – 27 June 1879) was a [[Swiss people|Swiss]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] member of the [[Secular Franciscan Order]]. She worked as a seamstress and also served as a catechist.&lt;ref name=MC&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mysticsofthechurch.com/2015/02/blessed-marguerite-bays-lay-mystic-and.html|title=Blessed Marguerite Bays, lay mystic and stigmatic|website=Mystics of the Church|accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She lived a simple life as a Franciscan and adapted the tenets of the order's charism into her own life and social apostolate. This became even greater after she was cured of [[bowel cancer]] on 8 December 1854 (when a Marian dogma was proclaimed) and she took this as a sign of greater service to both [[God]] and neighbor.&lt;ref name=SV&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.savior.org/saints/bays.htm|title=Blessed Marguerite Bays|date=|publisher=Savior.org|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her beatification process commenced after her death and culminated in 1995 after [[Pope John Paul II]] presided over her beatification.
After her death in 1879, [[Pope John Paul II]] beatified her in 1995 after the recognition of a miracle attributed to her intercession. One final miracle is needed for her to be canonized.&lt;ref name=SEB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/91709|title=Blessed Marguerite Bays|publisher=Santi e Beati|date=|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
===Childhood and education===
Marguerite Bays was born in La Pierraz - a hamlet of Chavannes-les-Forts in the [[canton of Fribourg]] - on 8 September 1815 as the second of seven children to Pierre-Antoine Bays and Josephine Morel.&lt;ref name=SV/&gt; Her siblings were:
* Jean
* Marie-Marguerite
* Joseph
* Blaise (died aged 12)
* Seraphine (the last-born)&lt;ref name=MC/&gt;
* Claude
Her parents were devout and were farmers; she herself demonstrated great intelligence as a student (she studied at school in Chavannes-les-Forts) and demonstrated a particular though noted inclination towards reflection and contemplation while deciding to cease interacting with her peers at school in favor of the solitude of talking to [[God]]. In 1823 she received her [[Confirmation (Catholic Church)|Confirmation]] and received her [[First Communion]] in 1826. It was after this from 1830 that she was in an apprenticeship as a seamstress before offering her services as a seamstress to different households.

In her room at home she made a small altar where she placed flowers and a statue of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Madonna]]. Marguerite would awaken in the morning to request her intercession at the statue before going outside to do the duties of the farm. In her spare time she would tell children about the life of Jesus.&lt;ref name=MC/&gt;

Despite the urgings of those around her she dismissed the prospects of becoming a professed religious. Instead it was her desire to remain single as a virgin in order to devote herself to an austere life for [[Jesus Christ]]. But pain struck their household: her sister Marie-Marguerite (known as "Mariette") saw the dissolution of her marriage; her brother Joseph (of a violent temper and relaxed manners) served a sentence in prison and the elder Claude had a child out of the marriage - François - of which Marguerite - then aged seventeen - took care of in terms of his education. Claude got married (aged 47 at the time) with Josette who - according to the testimonies of the relatives - was a woman of rude and indelicate character never losing the chance to humiliate and mistreat her sister-in-law. But Marguerite took care of Josette despite this for she was quite ill so as to prepare her for death.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

===Service to the poor===
It was during her adolescence that some peasant farmers could no longer find work due to the introduction of mechanization in agriculture. But these troubles did not hinder her efforts to serve the poor for she carried milk and bread to them while she would also wash and mend their clothes or even give them new ones to use.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

Her devotedness to service of the poor led her to discover the [[Secular Franciscan Order]] which she became a professed member.&lt;ref name=SV/&gt; Marguerite attended [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]] on a frequent basis despite a 20 minute walk in the neighboring village of [[Siviriez]] and she took part in the [[Eucharistic Adoration]] session following the celebration of the Mass. Marguerite also embarked on pilgrimages to Marian shrines.

|coordinates= {{coord|46.659205|6.894799}}
}}

Marguerite devoted part of her time on teaching [[catechism]] to children and often visited those who were ill. In 1853 she contracted [[bowel cancer]] and begged the Mother of God to heal her through her intercession. But at the same time she asked that her pain be linked with the suffering of Christ for her condition was her own Cross to bear. The disease first came when she began suffering from dizziness and acuta pain in her stomach as well as nausea that caused her often to vomit. But she tried to hide this and did not even take medicine for it until the condition was discovered and she was prompted to see a doctor who made the diagnosis and ruled out an operation.&lt;ref name=MC/&gt; On 8 December 1854 - when [[Pope Pius IX]] proclaimed the dogma of the [[Immaculate Conception]] - she found that she was cured of her illness.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

The mother abbess of a [[convent]] near her (also her goddaughter) Lutgarde Menétrey and the priest Joseph Schorderet often consulted with her in the founding of the Saint Paul's Work in 1873 which was an initiative that she both supported and encouraged despite the opposition of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Lausanne, Geneva and Fribourg|Bishop of Fribourg]] Étienne Marilley.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soeurs-st-paul.ch/fondateur/pierres_fondation.php|title=Les Pierres de fondation|publisher=Soeurs de Saint Paul|website=www.soeurs-st-paul.ch|language=en|date=|access-date=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stigmata and death===
{{Christian mysticism}}
Marguerite later discovered that she had the [[stigmata]] around 1854 and consulted with her local bishop to oversee the verification of just how authentic the stigmata were.&lt;ref name=SV/&gt; In addition she began to fall into ecstatic raptures when she would feel the pain of Christ once a week marking His death. But she first tried to hide the wounds from the outside world though it soon slipped out and news spread about her stigmata.

The stigmata was first noticed when she felt intense burning and noticed red blotches appear on her hands as well as on her feet and at her chest. Marguerite was subjected to a medical examination on 11 April 1873 and the doctor allowed for her niece to be present for the examination.&lt;ref name=MC/&gt; Jules Grangier visited her at her home to see the stigmata for himself sometime in 1873 after a series of requests made to see her.

In her last weeks she could have just little herbal tea as well as small amounts of milk and light bread soup. Her condition had taken a rapid spiral downwards throughout [[Lent]] of 1879 and she suffered from extreme pain during this period. Marguerite grew frail and thin and her brother Jean said she felt like a bag of bones when he had to lift her.&lt;ref name=MC/&gt; No one knew what her condition was for she kept silent on her sufferings and instead offered her pain to God; all that was known was that she suffered from acute pain in her head as well as her throat and chest. Marguerite died at 3:00pm on 27 June 1879 following several weeks of severe suffering and her funeral took place on 30 June; her funeral saw hundreds of people attend. Her remains were later transferred sometime after her death to the parish church at Siviriez.&lt;ref name=SV/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

==Beatification==
The beatification process commenced in Switzerland in 1929 and closed not long after also in 1929. Another local process spanned from 1953 to 1955 and the two processes were ratified on 13 December 1985. Her writings were all investigated and received appropriate theological approval on 25 November 1956 after the determination was made that her writings adhered to Church doctrine and principles. The [[Positio]] was then forwarded to the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] in [[Rome]] in 1986 for further evaluation. Theologians approved the dossier's contents on 13 February 1990 as did the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. not long after on the following 19 June. [[Pope John Paul II]] approved that she had lived a life of [[heroic virtue]] and proclaimed her to be [[Venerable]] on 10 July 1990. A miracle was investigated and the process was ratified on 12 April 1991. Medical experts approved this miracle on 25 February 1993 as did theologians on 2 July and the C.C.S. on 16 November. John Paul II approved it on 23 December 1993 and beatified her on 29 October 1995 in [[Saint Peter's Basilica]]. The miracle that led to her beatification was the cure of Bernard Pochon in 1940.

The second miracle needed for her canonization was investigated and the process closed on 27 May 2014; this alleged miracle involves a girl from 1998 who was saved after what would have been a fatal tractor accident had her grandfather not invoked the intercession of the Blessed. The documents on the miracle were submitted to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laliberte.ch/info-regionale/le-dossier-de-canonisation-de-marguerite-bays-transmis-a-rome-242417|title=The canonization of Marguerite Bays transmitted to Rome|publisher=|date=13 May 2014|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The C.C.S. issued a decree that validated this medical investigation on 1 October 2015.

The current [[postulator]] for this cause is the [[Order of Preachers|Dominican]] priest Bernard Hodel.

'''Maturidiyya''' ({{lang-ar|'''ماتريدي'''}}) is one of the main schools of [[Sunni]] Muslim theology. It was formalized by [[Abu Mansur Al Maturidi]] and brought the beliefs already present among the majority of Sunnis under one school of systematic theology ([[kalam]]). It is considered one of the orthodox [[Sunni]] creeds alongside the [[Ash'ari]] school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maturidiyah|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Maturidiyah|website=Britanicca|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Māturīdism has been the predominant theological orientation among the [[Sunni]] [[Muslims]] of [[Persia]] prior to its [[Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam|forced conversion to Shiaism in the 16th century]], [[Hanafis]], and the [[Ahl ar-Ra'y|Ahl al-Ray]] (people of reason) and enjoyed a preeminent status in the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Mughal India]]. Outside the old Ottoman and Mughal empires, the majority of [[Turkic tribes]], [[Central Asia|Central Asian]], and [[South Asia|South Asian]] Muslims also believe in Maturidi theology. The Maturidi school is strongly connected with [[Sufism]].

==Beliefs==
The Maturidi view holds that:
* All attributes of [[God in Islam|God]] are eternal and not separated from God.&lt;ref&gt;Cenap Çakmak Islam: A Worldwide Encyclopedia [4 volumes] ABC-CLIO 2017 {{ISBN|978-1-610-69217-5}} page 1014&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ethics have an objective existence and humans are capable of recognizing it through reason.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Leaman ''The Biographical Encyclopedia of Islamic Philosophy'' Bloomsbury Publishing 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-472-56945-5}} page 311&lt;/ref&gt;
* Although humans are intellectually capable of realizing God, they need revelations and guidance of [[Prophets in Islam|Prophets]], because human desire can divert the intellect and because certain knowledge of God has been specially given to these Prophets (i.e. the Quran was revealed to Muhammad, who was given this special knowledge from God and only through Muhammad did this knowledge become accessible to others).&lt;ref&gt;Cenap Çakmak Islam: A Worldwide Encyclopedia [4 volumes] ABC-CLIO 2017 {{ISBN|978-1-610-69217-5}} page 1014&lt;/ref&gt;
* Humans are free in determining their actions within scope of God-given possibilities. Accordingly, God has created all possibilities, but humans are free to choose.&lt;ref&gt;Cenap Çakmak Islam: A Worldwide Encyclopedia [4 volumes] ABC-CLIO 2017 {{ISBN|978-1-610-69217-5}} page 1014&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Quran]] is the uncreated word of God, however when it takes form (in sound or letters) it is created.
* The [[Iman (concept)#The Six Articles of Faith|Six articles of faith]].&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Leaman ''The Qur'an: An Encyclopedia'' Taylor &amp; Francis 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-415-32639-1}} page 41&lt;/ref&gt;
* Religious authorities need reasonable arguments to prove their claims.&lt;ref&gt;Ulli Roth, Armin Kreiner, Gunther Wenz, Friedo Ricken, Mahmut Ay, Roderich Barth, Halis Albayrak, Muammer Esen, Engin Erdem, Hikmet Yaman ''Glaube und Vernunft in Christentum und Islam'' Kohlhammer Verlag 2017 {{ISBN|978-3-170-31526-6}} page 83&lt;/ref&gt;
* Support of science and [[falsafa]].&lt;ref&gt;Ulli Roth, Armin Kreiner, Gunther Wenz, Friedo Ricken, Mahmut Ay, Roderich Barth, Halis Albayrak, Muammer Esen, Engin Erdem, Hikmet Yaman ''Glaube und Vernunft in Christentum und Islam'' Kohlhammer Verlag 2017 {{ISBN|978-3-170-31526-6}} page 83&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Maturidis state that [[Iman (concept)|iman]] (faith) does not increase nor decrease depending on one's deeds; it is rather [[taqwa]] (piety) which increases and decreases. The [[Ashʿari|Ash'aris]] say that faith itself increases or decreases according to one's actions.&lt;ref&gt;Cenap Çakmak Islam: A Worldwide Encyclopedia [4 volumes] ABC-CLIO 2017 {{ISBN|978-1-610-69217-5}} page 1015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mile Budak''' (30 August 1889 – 7 June 1945) was a [[Croats|Croatian]] politician and writer best known as one of the chief ideologists of the Croatian fascist [[Ustaša]] movement, which ruled the [[Independent State of Croatia]] during [[World War II in Yugoslavia]] from 1941–45 and waged a genocidal campaign of extermination against its [[Romani people|Roma]] and [[Jew]]ish population, and of extermination, expulsion and religious conversion against its [[Serb]] population.

==Youth and early political activities==
Mile Budak was born in [[Sveti Rok]], in [[Lika]], which was then a part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].&lt;ref name="jasenovac-info.com"&gt;[http://www.jasenovac-info.com/cd/biblioteka/pavelicpapers Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090702234716/http://www.jasenovac-info.com/cd/biblioteka/pavelicpapers |date=2009-07-02 }}, jasenovac-info.com; accessed 8 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; He attended school in [[Sarajevo]] and studied law at the [[University of Zagreb]].&lt;ref name="kadic"&gt;Contemporary Croatian literature by Ante Kadić, published by Mouton, 1960 (page 50)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912, he was arrested by Austro-Hungarian authorities over his alleged role in the attempted assassination of [[Slavko Cuvaj]], Croatian ban ([[viceroy]]).

==Ustaše period==

Budak and [[Vladko Maček]] served as lawyers representing [[Marko Hranilović]] and Matija Soldin at trial amid the [[January 6th Dictatorship]]. On 7 June 1932, he survived an assassination attempt by operatives close to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. Afterwards, he migrated to Italy to join the [[Ustaše]] and become the commander of an Ustaše training camp.&lt;ref name="jasenovac-info.com"/&gt; In 1938, he returned to Zagreb where he began publishing the weekly newspaper ''Hrvatski narod''. In 1940, the authorities banned the newspaper and he was arrested.&lt;ref&gt;''Review of International Affairs: Politics, Economics, Law, Science, Culture by Federation of Yugoslavic Journalists'' (''Savez novinara Jugoslavije, Socijalistički savez radnog naroda Jugoslavije''), published by The Federation, 1953, p. 25&lt;br&gt; On 4 March 1940, [[Aloysius Stepinac|Stepinac]] intervened with Šubašić, at the request of Prof. Lukas and Starčević, in favour of arrested Budak, who was sentenced to death by hanging after the war, as a war criminal (Book II, p. 440)&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 March 1941, in a joint letter to Hitler, Pavelić and Budak asked him "to help Croatian people establish an independent Croatian state that would encompass the old Croatian regions, among them Bosnia and Herzegovina".&lt;ref&gt;Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Second World War by Enver Redžić, Routledge, 2005; {{ISBN|0-7146-5625-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7146-5625-0}}, page 68&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Independent State of Croatia was proclaimed, Budak became the state's chief propagandist&lt;ref&gt;Yugoslavia as History: Twice There was a Country by John R. Lampe, Cambridge University Press, 2000; {{ISBN|0-521-77401-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-77401-7}} (p. 208)&lt;/ref&gt; and Minister of Education and Faith.&lt;ref&gt;''This is Artukovic'' by Devon Gaffney, B.A. Starcevic, published by s.n., 1958 (p. 51)&lt;/ref&gt; As such, he publicly stated that forcible expulsion and religious conversion of the ethnic Serb minority was the official national policy. Budak signed the Ustashe regime's racial laws against Serbs, Jews, and Roma.&lt;ref&gt;To Kill a Nation: The Attack on Yugoslavia by Michael Parenti, Verso, 2002 p. 45&lt;br/&gt;The full text of the racist law was published in Narodne novine from 4 June 1941. with and titled as "Zakonske odredbe o zaštiti narodne i arijske kulture hrvatskog naroda"&lt;/ref&gt; Croatian novelist [[Miroslav Krleža]] described Budak as "a minister of culture with a machine gun".&lt;ref name="jasenovac-info.com"/&gt; In a speech in [[Gospić]] on 22 July 1941, he declared: "The movement of the Ustashi is based on faith. For the minorities we have three million bullets. We shall kill one part of the Serbs, expel the second part, and convert to Catholicism the third part of them"&lt;ref&gt;''Ustaše: Croatian Separatism and European Politics, 1929–1945'', by Srdja Trifkovic, London, UK: 1998 (p. 141)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Magnum Crimen]]'' by Viktor Novak, Zagreb, 1948 (p. 605)&lt;/ref&gt; This exposition of Ustaše policy is attributed to Budak.&lt;ref&gt;''Triple Myth'' by Stella Alexander, Columbia University Press, 1987.&lt;!-- ISBN/ISSN, page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

He later became Croatian envoy to [[Nazi Germany]] (November 1941 – April 1943) and foreign minister (May 1943 – November 1943).&lt;ref&gt;The war we lost: Yugoslavia's Tragedy and the Failure of the West by Constantin Fotitch, published by Viking Press, 1948 (page 122)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;War and Revolution in Yugoslavia, 1941-1945: Occupation and Collaboration by Jozo Tomasevich, published by Stanford University Press, 2001 {{ISBN|0-8047-3615-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8047-3615-2}} (page 317)&lt;/ref&gt; When the Independent State of Croatia collapsed, Budak was captured by British military authorities and handed over to [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]]'s [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] on 18 May 1945. He was court-martialled (before the military court of the 2nd Yugoslav army) in Zagreb on 6 June 1945 and was sentenced to death by hanging the same day. His execution the following day took place exactly 13 years after the assassination attempt on his life.&lt;ref&gt;Politička i ekonomska osnova narodne vlasti u Jugoslaviji za vreme obnove by [[Branko Petranović]], published by Institut za savremenu istoriju, Beograd 1969 (page 201)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freewebs.com/hrvatiamac/budakmile.htm Petition on Mile Budak, once again]&lt;/ref&gt; During the trial, Budak claimed he was not guilty of anything.&lt;ref&gt;''Hrvatska 1945'', by [[Bogdan Radica]], Knjižnica Hrvatske revije, 1974 (p.&amp;nbsp;185).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- ISBN/ISSN needed --&gt;

==Literary work==
Budak was known for his literary work, especially novels and plays in which he had glorified Croatian peasantry. His works included ''Ognjište'' (''The Hearth''),&lt;ref&gt;Herdfeuer. Roman. [Berecht. Uebersetzung aus d. Kroatischen von Franz Hille] by Mile Budak, published by K. H. Bischoff Verl. (1943).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Opanci dida Vidurine'' (''Grandpa Vidurina's Shoes''),&lt;ref&gt;''Opanci dida Vidurine'' by Mile Budak, Sandra Belčić, Zagrebačka stvarnost, 2001; {{ISBN|953-192-071-0}}, {{ISBN|978-953-192-071-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rascvjetana trešnja'' (''The Blossoming Cherry Tree'').

About Budak's writing, E.E. Noth wrote: ''"Here we find the stubborn, spiritual-realistic conception of man and his relation to the soil on which he lives and which Mile Budak symbolizes as 'the hearth'"''.&lt;ref&gt;''Books Abroad: A Quarterly Publication Devoted to Comments on Foreign Books'' by Roy Temple House, Ernst Erich Noth, University of Oklahoma, 1940 (p. 329)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war his books were banned by [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|Communist]] authorities. Thus, many Croatian nationalists viewed Budak as a great figure of [[Croatian literature]], equal, if not superior to the leftist [[Miroslav Krleža]].&lt;ref name="kadic"/&gt; Following Croatian independence in the early 1990s, the Croatian Democratic Union badly wanted to reinterpret the fascist Ustasha quislings of World War II as a Croatian patriotic force. ''Hence, the reissue in early 1993 of the collected works of Mile Budak,the second-in-command in the Ustasha regime. Commenting, at the time of this reissue, Croatian writer Giancarlo Kravar wrote: "... Ustashism, in its history, was undoubtly also a positive political movement for the state-building affirmation of Croatianism, the expression of the centuries-long aspiration of the Croatian people"&lt;ref&gt;''Social Currents in Eastern Europe: The Sources and Consequences of the Great Transformation'' by Sabrina P. Ramet, 2nd edition, Duke University Press, 1995; {{ISBN|0-8223-1548-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8223-1548-3}} (p. 418)&lt;/ref&gt;

For others, Budak was "a mediocre Croatian author",&lt;ref&gt;B. Helleland, C.-E. Ore &amp; S. Wikstrøm (eds.) Names and Identities, Oslo Studies in Language 4(2), 2012. (ISSN 1890-9639) p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; "a mediocre writer at best",&lt;ref&gt;''Croats Face The Past'' in Balkan Report: May 12, 2000,  Volume 4, Number 35&lt;/ref&gt; "a writer of middling originality and imagination"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jhmf.org.uk/mile-budak Jasenovac and Holocaust Memorial Foundation, Mile Budak entry]&lt;/ref&gt; or a writer which literary work is "average and without lasting value".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Three Yugoslavias: State-building and Legitimation, 1918-2005|last=Ramet|first=Sabrina P.|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2006|pages=742}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
{{see also|Far-right politics in Croatia}}
As of August 2004, there were seventeen cities in Croatia which had streets named after Budak.&lt;ref&gt;''To Kill a Nation: The Attack on Yugoslavia'' by Michael Parenti, Verso, 2002; {{ISBN|1-85984-366-2}}, {{ISBN|978-1-85984-366-6}} (p. 45)&lt;/ref&gt; As of August 2012, at least one street in Bosnia and Herzegovina is named after Budak (in [[Mostar]]). The [[Archdiocese of Zagreb]] declared at one point {{When|date=June 2014}} that it had no objection to the erection of a monument dedicated to the dead [[Ustaša]] leader.&lt;ref&gt;''Democratic Transition in Croatia: Value Transformation, Education &amp; Media'' By Sabrina P.

'''Mount Miaofeng''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|妙|峰|山}}|p={{linktext|Miào|fēng |Shān}}|l=Marvelous Peak Mountain}}) is a mountain in the northwestern [[Beijing]], an extension of the [[Taihang Mountains]]. It is located in the [[Mentougou District]] of Beijing about 70 kilometers to the northwest of downtown Beijing.

Mount Miaofeng is culturally significant as a site of worship for the [[Taoism|Taoist]] goddess Bixia Yuanjun ({{zh|c={{linktext|碧|霞|元|君}}|p={{linktext|Bì|xiá |Yuán|jūn}}}}) also known as the "Heavenly Jade Maiden" ({{zh|c={{linktext|天|仙|玉|女}}|p={{linktext|Tiān|xian |Yù|nǚ}}}}) who is associated with [[Mount Tai]] ("Empress of Mount Tai", {{zh|c={{linktext|泰|山|娘|娘}}|p={{linktext|Tài|shān |Niang|niang}}}}).&lt;ref name=Naquin1992&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Naquin |editor1-first=Susan|editor2-last=Yü|editor2-first=Chün-Fang|date= |title=Pilgrims and Sacred Sites in China|location= |publisher=University of California Press|accessdate=February 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mount Miaofeng is the western terminus of a pilgrimage route from Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hiebertglobalcenter.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Reading-5-Strange-Ceremonies-Connected-with-Buddhist-Pilgrimage-to-Miao-Feng-Shan.pdf|title=Strange Ceremonies Connected with Buddhist Pilgrimage to Miao Feng Shan by Julius Eigner}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes2014&gt;{{Citation|author= Ian Johnson

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27515">The '''Muggletonians''', named after [[Lodowicke Muggleton]], were a small [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Christianity|Christian]] movement which began in 1651 when two London tailors announced they were the last prophets foretold in the biblical [[Book of Revelation]]. The group grew out of the [[Ranters]] and in opposition to the [[Quakers]]. Muggletonian beliefs include a hostility to philosophical reason, a scriptural understanding of how the universe works and a belief that God appeared directly on Earth as [[Jesus]] [[Christ (title)|Christ]]. A consequential belief is that God takes no notice of everyday events on Earth and will not generally intervene until it is meant to bring the world to an end.

Muggletonians avoided all forms of worship or preaching, and met only for discussion and socializing. The movement was egalitarian, apolitical and pacifist, and resolutely avoided [[evangelism]]. Members attained a degree of public notoriety by cursing those who reviled their faith. This practice ceased in the mid-nineteenth century. One of the last to be cursed was the novelist [[Sir Walter Scott]].{{cn|date=February 2018}}

The faith attracted public attention in 1979 when Philip Noakes left the entire Muggletonian archive of correspondence, general papers and publications to the [[British Library]].

==Origins==
[[File:Lodowicke Muggleton by William Wood.jpg|thumb|Lodowicke Muggleton, by William Wood, circa 1674]]
The movement was born on 3 February 1651 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|old style]]) when a London tailor, [[John Reeve (religious leader)|John Reeve]], received a commission from God "to the hearing of the ear as a man speaks to a friend."&lt;ref&gt;John Reeves [[A Divine Looking-Glass]] 1652 Chapter 23, verse 22&lt;/ref&gt; Reeve was told four things:
*"I have given thee understanding of my mind in the Scriptures above all men in the world."
*"Look into thy own body, there thou shalt see the Kingdom of Heaven, and the Kingdom of Hell."
*"I have chosen thee a last messenger for a great work, unto this bloody unbelieving world. And I have given thee Lodowick Muggleton to be thy mouth."
*"I have put the two-edged sword of my spirit into thy mouth, that whoever I pronounce blessed, through thy mouth, is blessed to eternity; and whoever I pronounce cursed through thy mouth is cursed to eternity."&lt;ref&gt;T. L. Underwood "The Acts of the Witnesses" New York: Oxford University Press 1999 pp. 142–43&lt;/ref&gt;
Reeve believed that he and his cousin, [[Lodowicke Muggleton]], were the two witnesses spoken of in the third verse of the eleventh chapter of the [[Book of Revelation]]. After Reeve's death Muggleton had a brief struggle for control of the group with [[Laurence Clarkson]], a former Ranter, and subsequently with those followers of [[John Reeve (religious leader)|John Reeve]] who did not accept Muggleton's authority.

The Muggletonians emphasized the [[Millennium]] and the [[Second Coming]] of Christ, and believed, among other things, that the soul is mortal; that [[Jesus]] is God (and not a member of a [[Trinity]]); that when Jesus died there was no God in Heaven, and Moses and Elijah looked after Heaven until Jesus' resurrection; that Heaven is six miles above Earth; that God is between five and six feet tall; and that any external religious ceremony is not necessary. Some scholars think that Muggletonian doctrine may have influenced the work of the artist and poet [[William Blake]].&lt;ref&gt;This is extensively argued in ''[[Witness Against the Beast]]'' by [[E. P. Thompson]]: Cambridge University Press, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent attempts have been made to locate the movement within earlier intellectual traditions, most notably the Eternal Gospel of [[Joachim of Fiore]]. However, Dr [[Marjorie Reeves]] has examined the evidence and concludes "the case for a recognisable Joachimist influence among seventeenth-century English prophets falls to the ground."&lt;ref&gt;[[Marjorie Reeves]] and Warwick Gould "Joachim of Fiore and the Myth of the Eternal Evangel" Oxford: Clarendon Press (1987) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; There had been at least one earlier appearance of a claim about the Two Last Witnesses, which John Reeve knew about.&lt;ref&gt;In [[A Divine Looking-Glass]] chap 24 verse 36, John Reeve refers to Bull and Varnum as predecessors. These were Richard Farnham and John Bull, two London weavers, who came to the conclusion in 1636 that they were the Two Witnesses. They were jailed and unable to assume their roles before their deaths.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==
The six principles of Muggletonianism were perhaps best set out by George Williamson, a Roman Catholic who visited the London Muggletonians in 1913:&lt;ref&gt;George Charles Williamson "Lodowick Muggleton" London: Chiswick Press (1919) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; 
*There is no God but the glorified Man Christ Jesus.
*There is no Devil but the unclean Reason of men.
*Heaven is an infinite abode of light above and beyond the stars.
*The place of Hell will be this Earth when sun, moon and stars are extinguished.
*Angels are the only beings of Pure Reason.
*The Soul dies with the body and will be raised with it.

These principles derive from Lodowicke Muggleton, who would have added one other matter as being of equal importance, namely, that God takes no immediate notice of doings in this world. If people sin, it is against their own consciences and not because God "catches them at it". 

John Reeve's formulation also included pacifism and the doctrine of the two seeds (see [[#2seeds| below]]). 

According to Rev Dr [[Alexander Gordon (Unitarian)|Alexander Gordon]] of Belfast, "The system of belief is a singular union of opinions which seem diametrically opposed. It is rationalistic on one side, credulous on another."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Gordon (1841–1931) first visited the London Muggletonians as a young journalist. He gave his experiences in two lectures to the Liverpool Literary and Philosophical Society which he had printed up as ''The Origins of the Muggletonians'' (1869) and ''Ancient and Modern Muggletonians'' (1870). He became principal of the Unitarian College in Manchester between 1889 and 1911 and revisited the Muggletonians again shortly after his retirement. see Lamont "Last Witnesses" pp. 3, 184&lt;/ref&gt;

Muggletonianism was profoundly materialist. Matter pre-existed even the creation of our universe; nothing can be created from nothing. God, identified as the Holy One of Israel, is a being with a glorified body, in appearance much like a man. There can never be a spirit without a body. A purely spiritual deity, lacking any locus, would be an absurdity (so Muggletonians vehemently told the Quakers) incapable of action in a material world. The man Christ Jesus was not sent from God but was the very God appearing on this earth. Speculation about a divine nature and a human nature, or about the Trinity, is not in error so much as unnecessary. At worst, John Reeve said, it encourages people to ascribe to the deity a whole ragbag of inconsistent human attributes expressed as superlatives. Or, as Thomas Tomkinson drily remarked, it tends to give you a father of justice just when you most wanted a son of mercy.

{{Anchor|2seeds}} The Devil, on the other hand, should not be likened to a character from a Ben Jonson play. When the one reprobate angel was tossed from heaven to earth, he perished, but not before impregnating Eve so that Cain was born to perpetuate his frustrated rage upon this earth. The natural process of generation ensured that, even by the time of Noah, all humans had within themselves something from Seth and something from Cain. Muggletonians call this the '''doctrine of the two seeds''': the seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent. The former promoted faith within us, the latter promoted reasoning and desire. This is the conflict within every person. This is a predestinarian belief but, because there are two seeds and not one, humanity is not rendered abject and the innocence of Adam and Eve still has a chance of coming to the top within modern humankind. 

Reason stems from desire and lack. Reason is not seen as a sublime mental process but as a rather shoddy trick humans use to try to get what they misguidedly imagine they want. Angels are creatures of Pure Reason because their only desire is for God so that their lack will be totally satisfied over and over again. The reprobate angel was not at fault. God deliberately chose to deprive this angel of satisfaction so that, by his fall, the other angels would become aware that their perfection came from God and not from their own natures. 

Professor Lamont sees 17th century Muggletonianism as an early form of liberation theology. Because there are no spirits without bodies, there can be no ghosts, no witches, no grounds for fear and superstition and no all-seeing eye of God. Once persons are contented in their faith, they are free to speculate as they please on all other matters. God will take no notice. And Muggletonian meetings did just that.

The Muggletonian canon is generally taken to comprise:
*The books of the Christian Old &amp; New Testaments except those traditionally ascribed to Solomon, whose wisdom is seen as worldly rather than inspired. Crucially, this deletes [[Ecclesiastes]]. Muggleton expressed doubts about the [[Book of Job]] but it is too much of a favourite to remove. Thomas Tomkinson advances a neat compromise, "though the authority of the book is questioned by some, yet all admit it to be a true history."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Tomkinson ''A System of Religion'' first printed 1729, revised and reprinted Clerkenwell: T. Goode (1857)&lt;/ref&gt;
*The writings of the prophets of the Third Commission.
*The [[Book of Enoch]] (Ethiopic Enoch or 1 Enoch). Muggletonians did not produce their own edition but did reprint ''Signification of the proper names occurring in the Book of Enoch from the Hebrew &amp; Chaldee'' Rev [[David Aaron de Sola|D. A. De Sola]]. Finsbury: Isaac Frost (1852). Similarly, ''The Book of the Secrets of Enoch'' (Slavonic Enoch or 2 Enoch) which was introduced into English by [[Robert Henry Charles]] in 1896 would qualify.&lt;ref&gt;R. H.

However, Muggletonians had a distaste for scriptural literalism. One of the purposes of the third commission was to make clear what was previously held obscure in scripture. Their approach to scripture incorporated quite explicit interpretation and separated texts into positive and privative.

==Muggletonian meetings==
Professor Lamont styles the Muggletonians "disorganized religion". They held no annual conferences, never organised a single public meeting, seem to have escaped every official register or census of religion, never incorporated, never instituted a friendly society, never appointed a leader, spokesperson, editorial board, chairperson for meetings or a single committee. Their sole foray into bureaucracy was to appoint trustees for their investment, the income from which paid the rent on the London Reading Room between 1869 and 1918. Philip Noakes may not have been the last Muggletonian, but he was certainly the last trustee.

Muggletonian meetings were simple comings-together of individuals who appeared to feel that discussion with like-minded believers helped clarify their own thoughts. "Nothing in the Muggletonian history becomes it more than its fidelity to open debate (though sometimes rancorous)."&lt;ref&gt;Lamont ''Last Witnesses'' p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;

Records and correspondence show that meetings took place from the 1650s to 1940 in London and for almost as long in Derbyshire. Regular meetings occurred at other places at other times. Bristol, Cork, Faversham and Nottingham are among those known, and there were many others, especially in East Anglia and Kent. 

In both London and Derbyshire two types of meeting were held. There were regular discussion meetings and there were holiday meetings of a more celebratory nature held in mid-February (to commemorate the start of the Third Commission) and at the end of July (to remember Muggleton's release from imprisonment). 

There remains a description of a Muggletonian holiday meeting held at the Reading Room at 7 New Street, London on February 14, 1869. There were about 40 members present, of whom slightly more than half were men. One quarter were said to have been born into the faith.  Tea was served at 5 o'clock. Discussion continued until 6 when a lady sang "Arise, My Soul, Arise" one of the Muggletonian divine songs.&lt;ref&gt;An updated version of the Divine Songs had been compiled and published by Joseph Frost in 1829. The words were by Muggletonians and the tunes were traditional. Sadly the appropriate tune is not always recorded. The words when read from the page are doggrel but, when sung to the correct tune, come over very well indeed. They are not hymns of praise because God takes no notice. [[William Ewart Gladstone]] (whose hobby was collecting hymnals) requested a copy of the song book and recorded in his diary that he was reading it. A facsimile of the book is available from Kessinger.&lt;/ref&gt; Then a large bowl of port negus with slices of lemon was served and a toast enjoined to absent friends. More songs were sung by each who volunteered. Beer was brought in and supper served at half past eight. "It was a plain substantial meal; consisting of a round of beef, a ham, cheese, butter, bread and beer. Throughout the evening, every one seemed heartily to enjoy himself or herself, with no lack of friendliness, but with complete decorum." No speeches were made. "By ten o'clock all were on their way homeward."&lt;ref&gt;Rev Dr. Alexander Gordon of Belfast ''Ancient and Modern Muggletonians'' p. 58. The meeting was several months before the date given on the plaque for the opening of the Reading Room.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also an account for a far older holiday meeting which Lodowicke Muggleton and his daughter, Sarah, attended in July 1682 at the Green Man pub in Holloway, then a popular rural retreat to the north of London. In addition to a goodly meal with wine and beer, a quartern of tobacco, one-fifth of a pound, was gotten through and a shilling paid out to "ye man of the bowling green".

Outside of holiday times, meetings seem to have altered little with time and place. They comprised discussion, readings and songs. There was no public worship, no instruction, no prayer. There is no record of any participant being moved by the spirit. Until mid-Victorian times, London meetings were held in the back rooms of pubs. In the early days, this is said to have provided an appearance of outward conformity with the [[Conventicle Act 1664|Conventicle Acts 1664]] and 1667. The meeting would look and sound to outsiders like a private or family party. Nothing would advertise religious observance. By 1869, pub life had become irksome and the London congregation obtained their first Reading Room at 7 New Street, which was reckoned to be built on the former site of Lodowicke Muggleton's birthplace, Walnut Tree Yard. This was made possible by legacies from Catherine Peers, Joseph Gandar and the Frost family; all of whom had been active in the faith. The money invested in government stock yielded sufficient income to pay the rent and the wages of a live-in caretaker who, for most of the Victorian period, was an unemployed shoe-repairer named Thomas Robinson. 7 New Street is perhaps the only site with Muggletonian connections still extant. However, it may require considerable historical imagination from the modern passer-by to gain a mental picture of what it would have been like in Victorian times. Then, the area was full of warehouses and factories, not the smart, professional consultancies of today.&lt;ref&gt;The Ordnance Survey map of 1873 (Godfrey Edition, London sheet 63, 1873) shows the neighbours to have been the 6th division police station, London &amp; St Katherine's Dock Warehouses, the Clothes Market and old clothes exchange as well as Broad Street and Liverpool Street railway stations, the latter under construction&lt;/ref&gt; For his visit in 1913, [[George Charles Williamson|Williamson]] tellingly describes it as being "in the East End".&lt;ref&gt;As of Christmas 2008, the building was tenantless and undergoing rewiring and redecoration. As the suspended ceilings were down, it was possible for the uninvited visitor to see that the front room on the first floor is most definitely the scene of the Muggletonian Reading Room photographed by Hallett Hyatt in 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;

By May 1918, wartime inflation seems to have undermined the Victorian financial settlement.&lt;ref&gt;However, E. P. Thompson suggests otherwise. He says the Muggletonians were bombed out by enemy air raid. This is possible. The Aldgate area was badly hit by [[Zeppelin]] attack in the aftermath of the long-remembered "Theatreland raid" of the night of October 13, 1915. But there is no record of New Street being hit.&lt;/ref&gt; The Muggletonians moved to cheaper rented premises not far away at 74 Worship Street, to the north of Finsbury Square.&lt;ref&gt;This address no longer exists but it would have been just to the west of the junction of Paul Street and Worship Street. Several rather mean Georgian houses survive elsewhere in Worship Street and it might be surmised that number 74 once looked like these.&lt;/ref&gt; They remained there until probably the autumn of 1940 when the building was destroyed by a firebomb during the London Blitz. This was the event which led to the transfer of the Muggletonian archive to Mr Noakes' farm in Kent. As a fruit farmer, Mr Noakes received a petrol ration to take his produce to Covent Garden market in central London. On the return journey, the archive was packed into the empty boxes and taken to safety.

==The Two Witnesses==
John Reeve reports that only he was told of his Commission by the word of God. Yet two persons, Lodowicke Muggleton and John Reeve, are appointed the Last Witnesses to fulfill the prophecy of Revelation 11:3 where no distinction is drawn between one witness and the other. John Reeve introduces a distinction of his own. "And I have given thee Lodowicke Muggleton to be thy mouth: at that very moment the holy spirit brought into my mind that scripture of Aaron given unto Moses."&lt;ref&gt;T. L. Underwood ''The Acts of the Witnesses'' p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst Reeve was alive, we have no evidence that anyone took Lodowicke Muggleton very seriously except as Reeve's assistant.  At their blasphemy trial in 1653, The Recorder of London, after examining John Reeve, turns to Muggleton and says, "Let Aaron speak".&lt;ref&gt;T. L. Underwood ''The Acts of the Witnesses'' p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly, Muggleton appears to have written nothing whilst Reeve was alive. After first attempting to take control, Clarkson eventually submitted to Muggleton completely, even agreeing to give up writing and keeping that promise.

Revelation say the Two Witnesses:
*Possess power and to prophesy 1260 days whilst clothed in sackcloth.
*Are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks.
*Will kill their enemies by fire from their mouths.
*Can inflict droughts and plagues and turn water to blood during their prophesying.
*Shall be killed by the Beast and their bodies lie unburied in the street of a great city for three and a half days whilst the people will rejoice "because these two prophets tormented them".
*Will return to life and ascend to heaven whilst an earthquake destroys one tenth of the city. With that "the Second Woe is past and behold the Third Woe cometh quickly".

Muggleton and Reeve's two predecessors, the weavers Richard Farnham and John Bull, did try to live out their script particularly in their role as bringers of plagues. However, there is no evidence that John Reeve and Lodowicke Muggleton felt in any way obliged to follow suit. Contemporaries did comment adversely upon this, especially upon the death of Reeve from all-too-natural causes followed by his equally mundane funeral at the New Bethlehem Burial grounds.{{cn|date=October 2013}}

==Later history==
The Muggletonians had a belief that they could damn and bless according to the will of God and the apparent success of such damning (apparently resulting in the death of certain religious, mainly Quaker, opponents) brought the sect great notoriety. A vigorous tract war ensued with their Quaker opponents that lasted until the death of Muggleton.

[[William Maitland (historian)|William Maitland]]'s 1739 edition of ''A History of London'' gives two Muggletonian meeting-places. One, for the [[Southwark]] congregation, is in Barnaby Street.&lt;ref&gt;believed, nowadays, to be deep below the site of [[London Bridge]] railway station&lt;/ref&gt; The other, for the [[Aldersgate]] congregation, is in [[Old Street Square]].&lt;ref&gt;according to the A–Z of Regency London, this was once on the present site of the Redbrick Estate to the west of the Old Street/Bath Street junction&lt;/ref&gt; Presumably, both of these were public houses, rented rooms or private homes as no dedicated meeting room existed before 1869.

In "[[The Making of the English Working Class]]" [[E. P. Thompson]] says, "The Muggletonians (or followers of Ludovic Muggleton) were still preaching in the fields and parks of London at the end of the eighteenth century."&lt;ref&gt;[[E. P. Thompson]], "[[The Making of the English Working Class]]", Harmondsworth: Penguin (1968) p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Those Muggletons whose lives we know about would have rejected preaching as pointless and spiritually dangerous. Were there other groups of Muggletonians who operated differently? At present, historians cannot answer, but the possibility is there. Firstly, other denominations of that era, such as Methodists and Baptists, existed in a profusion of forms as E. P. Thompson's own index shows. Secondly, contact between those Muggletonians about whom we do know was sporadic, at best. "For example, those in Derbyshire were ignorant of the existence of any persons entertaining the same faith in London until one of their number removed thither to seek employment and, after residing there a short time, heard of the London bretheren&lt;!-- brethren? --&gt; by mere accident."&lt;ref&gt;William Ridsdale of Lenton, Nottingham in a letter to the ''Inquirer'' March 21, 1863&lt;/ref&gt; Thirdly, the name existed widely in the public domain without much knowledge of what it meant. Sir [[Walter Scott]] received eternal damnation for his ignorant remarks in ''[[Woodstock (novel)|Woodstock]]''.{{cn|date=February 2018}} [[Charles Dickens]] incorporates All-Muggleton into ''[[Pickwick Papers]]''. A character called Mrs Snowdrop in [[Douglas William Jerrold]]'s ''Nell Gwynne'' (1833) says, "Nothing now will serve her but to go upon the stage. Tisn't my fault. I'm sure I put the pious Mr Muggleton under her pillow every night." So everyone '''thought''' they knew what a Muggletonian was.

During the nineteenth century this formerly non-proselytizing Protestant sect became increasingly vocal and published several books intended for general audiences. In 1846, for example, the Muggletonian Isaac Frost published ''Two Systems of Astronomy'', a lavishly illustrated book outlining the anti-Newtonian cosmology of the Muggletonians.&lt;ref name="NatGeo"&gt;"[https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/05/muggletonians-maps-cosmos-anti-science/ How an Obscure Religious Sect Mapped the Cosmos]", Greg Miller, May 8, 2018, ''All Over The Map'', ''[[National Geographic]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; This activity arose from the activity of the Frost brothers (Joseph and Isaac) who having made their fortune in the Derby Brass Foundry business proceeded to spend significant sums on publicising their sect once the family moved to London. A great quantity of books were published but very few were actually sold.

Notable Muggletonian writers include [[Laurence Clarkson]] (1615–1667) an itinerant preacher born in Preston, Lancashire; [[John Saddington]] (1634? – 1679) a London sugar merchant, originally from Arnesby, Leicestershire; [[Thomas Tomkinson]] (1631–1710) a Staffordshire yeoman farmer who moved to London in the 1680s; and Isaac Frost (1793–1858) and Joseph Frost (1791–1857), brothers who ran the family metallurgy business in Clerkenwell, London. Also deserving mention is Alexander Delamaine (died 1687), a wealthy London tobacco merchant who began ''The Great Book'' in 1682, which became the Muggletonian archive.&lt;ref&gt;dates for Clarkson, Saddington and Tomkinson from [[T. L. Underwood]] "The Acts of the Witnesses" New York: O.U.P. 1999. pp. 14, 21 and 22 respectively and for the Frost brothers from William Lamont "Last Witnesses" Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing 2006 p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

The group survived into the twentieth century. The last Muggletonian, Philip Noakes of [[Matfield]], [[Kent]], died on 26 February 1979; the sect's records, which he had kept, were then transferred to the British Library.&lt;ref&gt;Lamont, William ''Last witnesses; the Muggletonian history, 1652–1979''. Ashgate Publishing Co, 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-7546-5532-9}}. Other gifts have joined the archive, most notably from Eileen Muggleton of the commonplace book of John Dimock Aspland (1816–1877).&lt;/ref&gt; The published works of the Muggletonian Brethren are still available from Gage Postal Books of [[Westcliffe-on-Sea]], Essex.

There may be another archive still to be found. Mrs Louise Barnes of Buffalo, NY, wrote to London in 1936 about the US Muggletonian archive kept by her father, the late Alfred Hall. This collection was clearly treasured, mainly for family reasons. It may still exist.

"In Edward Thompson's words, Muggletonianism was a 'highly intellectual anti-intellectualism', and as such remarkably well adapted for survival among the semi-educated, self-taught, self-confident London artisans of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries."&lt;ref&gt;Perhaps it still is? Christopher Hill, Barry Reay &amp; William Lamont "The World of the Muggletonians" London: Maurice Temple Smith (1983) p. 102 where is quoted a letter of E. P. Thompson's to the Times Literary Supplement of March 7, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Original Teachings of the Buddha''' are textually recorded teachings of the historical Buddha, [[Siddhartha Gautama]], regarded by modern scholarship as authentic. These authentic teachings are called in Buddhism ''[[Buddhavacana|Buddha Vacana]]'' (the "word of the Buddha"). Modern scholarship regards the [[Pali Canon]] (the only complete extant edition of the ''[[Tripitaka]]'') as representing the most reliable recension of these teachings. These source teachings have given rise to the numerous schools and traditions of Buddhism that exist today. 

In modern academia, the [[Vinaya Pitaka]] and the [[Sutta pitaka]] of the [[Pali Canon]], the derivative Chinese [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Agamas]] as well as surviving fragments of the Sanskrit Canon and [[Gāndhārī language|Gandhari]] Canon have been identified as containing the earliest known record of these teachings. These teachings were passed down over a period of several centuries in oral form before being committed to writing in the first century BCE.

In the final decade of the sixth century AD, the Parthenon was converted into a [[History of Christianity#Early Middle Ages (476–799)|Christian]] church dedicated to the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]].

After the [[Ottoman Greece|Ottoman conquest]], it was turned into a [[mosque]] in the early 1460s.

==Etymology==
The origin of the Parthenon's name is from the Greek word παρθενών (''parthenon''), which referred to the "unmarried women's apartments" in a house and in the Parthenon's case seems to have been used at first only for a particular room of the temple;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dparqenw%2Fn παρθενών], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; it is debated which room this is and how the room acquired its name. The Liddell–Scott–Jones ''[[A Greek–English Lexicon|Greek–English Lexicon]]'' states that this room was the western [[cella]] of the Parthenon, as does J.B. Bury.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A history of Greece to the death of Alexander the Great, 3rd ed|last=Bury|first=J. B.|last2=Meiggs|first2=Russell|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1956|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=367–369}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jamauri D. Green holds that the parthenon was the room in which the [[peplos]] presented to Athena at the [[Panathenaic Festival]] was woven by the ''[[arrephoros|arrephoroi]]'', a group of four young girls chosen to serve Athena each year.&lt;ref&gt;Hurwit 200, pp. 161–163.&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Pelling asserts that Athena Parthenos may have constituted a discrete cult of Athena, intimately connected with, but not identical to, that of [[Athena Polias]].&lt;ref&gt;Research has revealed a shrine with altar pre-dating the Older Parthenon, respected by, incorporated and rebuilt in the north ''[[pteron]]'' of the Parthenon (Pelling, ''Greek Tragedy and the Historian'', 169).&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, the name of the Parthenon means the "temple of the virgin goddess" and refers to the cult of Athena Parthenos that was associated with the temple.&lt;ref name="Br"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Parthenon |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; The epithet ''parthénos'' ({{lang|grc|παρθένος}})  meant "maiden, girl", but also "virgin, unmarried woman"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dparqe%2Fnos παρθένος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; and was especially used for [[Artemis]], the goddess of wild animals, the hunt, and vegetation, and for Athena, the [[goddess]] of strategy and tactics, handicraft, and practical reason.&lt;ref&gt;Frazer, ''The Golden Bough'', 18&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that the name of the temple alludes to the maidens (''parthenoi''), whose supreme sacrifice guaranteed the safety of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, ''The Archaeology of Ancient Greece'', 352&lt;/ref&gt; ''Parthénos'' has also been applied to the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]], Parthénos Maria, and the Parthenon had been converted to a Christian church dedicated to the Virgin Mary in the final decade of the sixth century.&lt;ref name="freely"/&gt;

The first instance in which ''Parthenon'' definitely refers to the entire building is found in the writings of the 4th century BC orator [[Demosthenes]]. In 5th-century building accounts, the structure is simply called ''ho naos'' ("the temple"). The architects [[Iktinos]] and [[Callicrates]] are said to have called the building ''Hekatompedos'' ("the hundred footer") in their lost treatise on Athenian architecture,&lt;ref&gt;[[Harpocration]].{{Full citation needed|date=May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in the 4th century and later, the building was referred to as the ''Hekatompedos'' or the ''Hekatompedon'' as well as the Parthenon; the 1st-century-AD writer [[Plutarch]] referred to the building as the ''Hekatompedos Parthenon''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Pericles'' 13.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the Parthenon was dedicated to the Greek goddess Athena, it has sometimes been referred to as the Temple of [[Minerva]], the Roman name for Athena, particularly during the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, 1878&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
[[File:DoricParthenon.jpg|thumb|The [[Doric order]] of the Parthenon]]
Although the Parthenon is architecturally a temple and is usually called so, it is not really one in the conventional sense of the word.&lt;ref name="Deacy-11"&gt;[[Susan Deacy]], ''Athena'', Routledge, 2008, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; A small [[shrine]] has been excavated within the building, on the site of an older [[sanctuary]] probably dedicated to Athena as a way to get closer to the goddess,&lt;ref name="Deacy-11" /&gt; but the Parthenon never hosted the cult of Athena Polias, patron of Athens: the [[cult image]], which was bathed in the sea and to which was presented the ''[[peplos]]'', was an olivewood ''[[xoanon]]'', located at an older altar on the northern side of the Acropolis.&lt;ref name="Burkert-143"&gt;Burkert, ''Greek Religion'', Blackwell, 1985, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

The colossal statue of Athena by [[Phidias]] was not related to any cult&lt;ref&gt;MC. Hellmann, ''L'Architecture grecque. Architecture religieuse et funéraire'', Picard, 2006, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; and is not known to have inspired any religious fervour.&lt;ref name="Burkert-143" /&gt; It did not seem to have any [[priest]]ess, altar or cult name.&lt;ref name="Nagy-55"&gt;B. Nagy, "Athenian Officials on the Parthenon Frieze", ''AJA'', Vol. 96, No. 1 (January 1992), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to [[Thucydides]], [[Pericles]] once referred to the statue as a gold reserve, stressing that it "contained forty talents of pure gold and it was all removable".&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides 2.13.5. Retrieved 11 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Athenian statesman thus implies that the metal, obtained from contemporary coinage,&lt;ref&gt;S. Eddy, "The Gold in the Athena Parthenos", ''AJA'', Vol. 81, No. 1 (Winter, 1977), pp. 107–111.&lt;/ref&gt; could be used again without any impiety.&lt;ref name="Nagy-55" /&gt;
The Parthenon should then be viewed as a grand setting for Phidias' votive statue rather than a cult site.&lt;ref&gt;B. Holtzmann and A. Pasquier, ''Histoire de l'art antique : l'art grec'', École du Louvre, Réunion des musées nationaux and Documentation française, 1998, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; It is said{{by whom|date=June 2014}} in many writings of the Greeks that there were many treasures stored inside the temple, such as Persian swords and small statue figures made of precious metals.

Archaeologist [[Joan Breton Connelly]] has recently argued for the coherency of the Parthenon’s sculptural programme in presenting a succession of genealogical narratives that track Athenian identity back through the ages: from the birth of Athena, through [[wikt:Special:Search/cosmic|cosmic]] and epic battles, to the final great event of the [[Athenian Bronze Age]], the war of [[Erechtheus]] and [[Eumolpos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Parthenon Enigma: a New Understanding of the West's Most Iconic Building and the People Who Made It|publisher = Vintage|date = 2014|location = New York|isbn = 978-0307476593|first = Joan Breton|last = Connelly}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Welcome to Joan Breton Connelly|url = http://www.joanbretonconnelly.com/|website = Welcome to Joan Breton Connelly|accessdate = 18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She argues a pedagogical function for the Parthenon’s sculptured decoration, one that establishes and perpetuates Athenian foundation myth, memory, values and identity.&lt;ref&gt;Joan Breton Connelly, ''The Parthenon Enigma'',"[https://www.amazon.com/Parthenon-Enigma-Joan-Breton-Connelly/dp/030759338X]" New York, Knopf, 2014, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Mendelsohn, "[http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/04/14/deep-frieze Deep Frieze]", ''The New Yorker'', 14 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; While some classicists, including [[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], [[Peter Green (historian)|Peter Green]], and [[Garry Wills]]&lt;ref&gt;Mary Beard, "[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/mar/06/latest-scheme-parthenon/ The Latest Scheme for the Parthenon]", ''The New York Review of Books'', 6 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mary Beard, Peter Green, Garry Wills "[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/may/22/parthenon-enigma-exchange/ ‘The Parthenon Enigma’—An Exchange]", ''The New York Review of Books'', 22 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; have doubted or rejected Connelly's thesis, an increasing number of historians, archaeologists, and classical scholars support her work.

===Older Parthenon===
{{Main|Older Parthenon}}

The first endeavour to build a sanctuary for [[Athena#Athena Parthenos: Virgin Athena|Athena Parthenos]] on the site of the present Parthenon was begun shortly after the [[Battle of Marathon]] (c. 490–488&amp;nbsp;BC) upon a solid [[limestone]] foundation that extended and levelled the southern part of the [[Acropolis]] summit. This building replaced a ''hekatompedon'' (meaning "hundred-footer") and would have stood beside the [[Old Temple of Athena|archaic temple dedicated to ''Athena Polias'']] ("of the city"). The [[Older Parthenon|Older or Pre-Parthenon]], as it is frequently referred to, was still under construction when the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] sacked the city in 480&amp;nbsp;BC and razed the Acropolis.&lt;ref name="venieri-acropolis" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hurwit 2005, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of both the proto-Parthenon and its destruction were known from [[Herodotus]],&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus Histories, 8.53&lt;/ref&gt; and the drums of its columns were plainly visible built into the curtain wall north of the [[Erechtheion]]. Further physical evidence of this structure was revealed with the excavations of [[Panagis Kavvadias|Panagiotis Kavvadias]] of 1885–90. The findings of this dig allowed [[Wilhelm Dörpfeld]], then director of the [[German Archaeological Institute]], to assert that there existed a distinct substructure to the original Parthenon, called Parthenon I by Dörpfeld, not immediately below the present edifice as had been previously assumed.&lt;ref&gt;W. Dörpfeld, "Der aeltere Parthenon", ''Ath. Mitteilungen'', XVII, 1892, pp. 158–189 and W. Dörpfeld, "Die Zeit des alteren Parthenon", ''AM'' '''27''', 1902, 379–416&lt;/ref&gt; Dörpfeld's observation was that the three steps of the first Parthenon consisted of two steps of Poros limestone, the same as the foundations, and a top step of Karrha limestone that was covered by the lowest step of the Periclean Parthenon. This platform was smaller and slightly to the north of the final Parthenon, indicating that it was built for a wholly different building, now completely covered over. This picture was somewhat complicated by the publication of the final report on the 1885–90 excavations, indicating that the substructure was contemporary with the Kimonian walls, and implying a later date for the first temple.&lt;ref&gt;P. Kavvadis, G. Kawerau, ''Die Ausgabung der Acropolis vom Jahre 1885 bis zum Jahre 1890'', 1906&lt;/ref&gt;

If the original Parthenon was indeed destroyed in 480, it invites the question of why the site was left a ruin for thirty-three years. One argument involves the oath sworn by the Greek allies before the [[Battle of Plataea]] in 479&amp;nbsp;BC&lt;ref&gt;NM Tod, ''A Selection of Greek Historical Inscriptions II'', 1948, no. 204, lines 46–51, The authenticity of this is disputed, however; see also P. Siewert, Der Eid von Plataia (Munich 1972) 98–102&lt;/ref&gt; declaring that the sanctuaries destroyed by the Persians would not be rebuilt, an oath from which the Athenians were only absolved with the [[Peace of Callias]] in 450.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kerr|first=Minott|url=http://people.reed.edu/~mkerr/papers/Parth95.html|title='The Sole Witness': The Periclean Parthenon|publisher=Reed College Portland, Oregon USA|date=23 October 1995|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608024611/http://people.reed.edu/~mkerr/papers/Parth95.html|archivedate=8 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mundane fact of the cost of reconstructing Athens after the Persian sack is at least as likely a cause. However, the excavations of [[Bert Hodge Hill]] led him to propose the existence of a second Parthenon, begun in the period of [[Cimon|Kimon]] after 468&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;B.H. Hill, "The Older Parthenon", ''AJA', XVI, 1912, 535–58&lt;/ref&gt; Hill claimed that the Karrha limestone step Dörpfeld thought was the highest of Parthenon I was in fact the lowest of the three steps of Parthenon II, whose stylobate dimensions Hill calculated at {{convert|23.51|x|66.888|m|2|lk=on}}.

One difficulty in dating the proto-Parthenon is that at the time of the 1885 excavation the archaeological method of [[seriation (archaeology)|seriation]] was not fully developed; the careless digging and refilling of the site led to a loss of much valuable information. An attempt to discuss and make sense of the potsherds found on the Acropolis came with the two-volume study by Graef and Langlotz published in 1925–33.&lt;ref&gt;B. Graef, E. Langlotz, ''Die Antiken Vasen von der Akropolis zu Athen'', Berlin 1925–33&lt;/ref&gt; This inspired American archaeologist [[William Bell Dinsmoor]] to attempt to supply limiting dates for the temple platform and the five walls hidden under the re-terracing of the Acropolis. Dinsmoor concluded that the latest possible date for Parthenon I was no earlier than 495&amp;nbsp;BC, contradicting the early date given by Dörpfeld.&lt;ref&gt;W. Dinsmoor, "The Date of the Older Parthenon", ''AJA'', XXXVIII, 1934, 408–48&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Dinsmoor denied that there were two proto-Parthenons, and held that the only pre-Periclean temple was what Dörpfeld referred to as Parthenon II. Dinsmoor and Dörpfeld exchanged views in the ''American Journal of Archaeology'' in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;W. Dörpfeld, "Parthenon I, II, III", ''AJA'', XXXIX, 1935, 497–507, and W. Dinsmoor, ''AJA'', XXXIX, 1935, 508–9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Present building===
[[File:The Parthenon at Night..jpg|thumb|The Parthenon at the acropolis of Athens at night.]]
[[File:Parthenon restoration.gif|thumb|Parthenon today and as it probably appeared in ancient times]]
In the mid-5th century BC, when the Athenian Acropolis became the seat of the [[Delian League]] and Athens was the greatest cultural centre of its time, [[Pericles]] initiated an ambitious building project that lasted the entire second half of the century. The most important buildings visible on the Acropolis today — the Parthenon, the [[Propylaia]], the [[Erechtheion]] and the temple of [[Athena Nike]] — were erected during this period. The Parthenon was built under the general supervision of the artist [[Phidias]], who also had charge of the sculptural decoration. The architects [[Ictinos]] and [[Callicrates]] began their work in 447&amp;nbsp;BC, and the building was substantially completed by 432, but work on the decorations continued until at least 431.

==Architecture==
[[File:Parthenon plan.png|thumb|right|Floor plan of the Parthenon]]

The Parthenon is a [[peripteral]] [[octastyle]] [[Doric order|Doric]] temple with [[Ionic order|Ionic]] architectural features. It stands on a platform or [[stylobate]] of three steps. In common with other Greek temples, it is of [[post and lintel]] construction and is surrounded by columns ("peripteral") carrying an [[entablature]]. There are eight columns at either end ("octastyle") and seventeen on the sides. There is a double row of columns at either end. The colonnade surrounds an inner masonry structure, the ''[[cella]]'', which is divided into two compartments. At either end of the building the [[gable]] is finished with a triangular [[pediment]] originally occupied by sculpted figures. The columns are of the [[Doric order]], with simple capitals, fluted shafts and no bases. Above the architrave of the entablature is a [[frieze]] of carved pictorial panels ([[Metope (architecture)|metopes]]), separated by formal architectural [[triglyph]]s, typical of the Doric order. Around the cella and across the lintels of the inner columns runs a continuous sculptured [[frieze]] in low relief. This element of the architecture is [[Ionic order|Ionic]] in style rather than Doric.&lt;ref&gt;Banister Fletcher, ''History of architecture on the Comparative Method'', pp 119–123&lt;/ref&gt;

Measured at the stylobate, the dimensions of the base of the Parthenon are {{convert|69.5|by|30.9|m|ft}}. The cella was 29.8&amp;nbsp;metres long by 19.2&amp;nbsp;metres wide (97.8&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;63.0&amp;nbsp;ft). On the exterior, the Doric columns measure {{convert|1.9|m|ft}} in diameter and are {{convert|10.4|m|ft}} high. The corner columns are slightly larger in diameter. The Parthenon had 46 outer columns and 23 inner columns in total, each column containing 20 flutes. (A flute is the [[wikt:concave|concave]] shaft carved into the column form.) The roof was covered with large overlapping marble tiles known as [[imbrex and tegula|imbrices and tegulae]].{{cn|date=September 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Tegula.html|title=LacusCurtius • Roman Architecture — Roof Tiles (Smith's Dictionary, 1875)|website=penelope.uchicago.edu|language=en|access-date=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Parthenon is regarded as the finest example of Greek architecture. The temple, wrote [[John Julius Cooper]], "enjoys the reputation of being the most perfect Doric temple ever built. Even in antiquity, its architectural refinements were legendary, especially the subtle correspondence between the curvature of the stylobate, the taper of the [[naos (architecture)|naos]] walls and the ''entasis'' of the columns."&lt;ref&gt;John Julius Norwich, ''Great Architecture of the World'', 2001, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- If we must have this quote let's at least get it right. --&gt; ''[[Entasis]]'' refers to the slight swelling, of {{convert|4|cm}}, in the centre of the columns to counteract the appearance of columns having a waist, as the swelling makes them look straight from a distance. The stylobate is the platform on which the columns stand. As in many other classical Greek temples,&lt;ref&gt;And in the surviving foundations of the preceding Older Parthenon (Penrose, ''Principles of Athenian Architecture'' 2nd ed. ch. II.3, plate 9).&lt;/ref&gt; it has a slight parabolic upward curvature intended to shed rainwater and reinforce the building against earthquakes. The columns might therefore be supposed to lean outwards, but they actually lean slightly inwards so that if they carried on, they would meet almost exactly a mile above the centre of the Parthenon; since they are all the same height, the curvature of the outer stylobate edge is transmitted to the [[architrave]] and roof above: "All follow the rule of being built to delicate curves", Gorham Stevens observed when pointing out that, in addition, the west front was built at a slightly higher level than that of the east front.&lt;ref&gt;Penrose ''op. cit.'' pp 32–34, found the difference motivated by economies of labour; Gorham P. Stevens, "Concerning the Impressiveness of the Parthenon" ''American Journal of Archaeology'' '''66'''.3 (July 1962:337–338).&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not universally agreed what the intended effect of these "optical refinements" was; they may serve as a sort of "reverse optical illusion".&lt;ref&gt;Archeologists discuss similarly curved architecture and offer the theory. ''Nova'', "Secrets of the Parthenon", PBS. http://video.yahoo.com/watch/1849622/6070405{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=Balon Greyjoy |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Greeks may have been aware, two [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] lines appear to bow, or curve outward, when intersected by converging lines. In this case, the ceiling and floor of the temple may seem to bow in the presence of the surrounding angles of the building. Striving for perfection, the designers may have added these curves, compensating for the illusion by creating their own curves, thus negating this effect and allowing the temple to be seen as they intended. It is also suggested that it was to enliven what might have appeared an inert mass in the case of a building without curves, but the comparison ought to be, according to Smithsonian historian Evan Hadingham, with the Parthenon's more obviously curved predecessors than with a notional rectilinear temple.&lt;ref name=SmithMag&gt;{{Citation |last= Hadingham |first= Evan|year= February 2008 |title= Unlocking Mysteries of the Parthenon  |publisher= Smithsonian Magazine|publication-place= Washington, DC |page= 42|url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies of the Acropolis, including the Parthenon, conclude that many of its proportions approximate the [[golden ratio]]. The Parthenon's façade as well as elements of its façade and elsewhere can be circumscribed by [[golden rectangle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Van Mersbergen, Audrey M., "Rhetorical Prototypes in Architecture: Measuring the Acropolis", ''Philosophical Polemic Communication Quarterly'', Vol. 46, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; This view that the golden ratio was employed in the design has been disputed in more recent studies.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. {{cite journal|author=George Markowsky|url=http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/teaching/maa/markowsky.pdf|format=PDF|title=Misconceptions about the Golden Ratio|journal=The College Mathematics Journal|volume= 23|issue= 1|date=January 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sculpture==
[[File:Elgin Marbles east pediment.jpg|thumb|Group from the east pediment, [[British Museum]].]]
The cella of the Parthenon housed the [[Athena Parthenos|chryselephantine statue of Athena Parthenos]] sculpted by [[Phidias]] and dedicated in 439 or 438&amp;nbsp;BC.  The appearance of this is known from other images.  The decorative stonework was originally highly coloured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ellopos.net/elpenor/greek-texts/ancient-greece/history-of-ancient-greek-art-12.asp |title=Tarbell, F.B. ''A History of Ancient Greek Art''. (online book) |publisher=Ellopos.net |accessdate=18 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temple was dedicated to Athena at that time, though construction continued until almost the beginning of the [[Peloponnesian War]] in 432. By the year 438, the sculptural decoration of the Doric metopes on the [[frieze]] above the exterior colonnade, and of the Ionic frieze around the upper portion of the walls of the [[cella]], had been completed.  In the ''opisthodomus'' (the back room of the cella) were stored the monetary contributions of the Delian League, of which Athens was the leading member.

Only a very small number of the sculptures remain ''in situ''; most of the surviving sculptures are today (controversially) in the [[British Museum]] in London as the [[Elgin Marbles]], and the Athens [[Acropolis Museum]], but a few pieces are also in the [[Louvre]], and museums in Rome, [[Vienna]] and [[Palermo]].&lt;ref&gt;For comprehensive drawings showing the location of each piece today, see: [https://www.academia.edu/2543561/The_Parthenon= "The Parthenon", in ''Strolling Through Athens''], City of Athens, 2004, pp. 112–119.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metopes===
{{Main|Metopes of the Parthenon}}
[[File:Parthenon XL.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of the West metopes]]

The frieze of the Parthenon's entablature contained ninety-two [[Metope (architecture)|metopes]], fourteen each on the east and west sides, thirty-two each on the north and south sides. They were carved in high relief, a practice employed until then only in treasuries (buildings used to keep votive gifts to the gods).{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} According to the building records, the metope sculptures date to the years 446–440&amp;nbsp;BC. The metopes of the east side of the Parthenon, above the main entrance, depict the [[Gigantomachy]] (the mythical battle between the Olympian gods and the [[Gigantes|Giants]]). The metopes of the west end show the [[Amazonomachy]] (the mythical battle of the Athenians against the [[Amazons]]). The metopes of the south side show the Thessalian [[Centauromachy]] (battle of the [[Lapiths]] aided by [[Theseus]] against the half-man, half-horse [[Centaur]]s). Metopes 13–21 are missing, but drawings from 1674 attributed to Jaques Carrey indicate a series of humans; these have been variously interpreted as scenes from the [[Lapith]] wedding, scenes from the early history of Athens and various myths.&lt;ref name=Barringer2008 &gt;{{Cite book |last=Barringer |first=Judith M |year=2008 |title=Art, myth, and ritual in classical Greece |publisher=Cambridge |isbn=978-0521646475  |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/art-myth-and-ritual-in-classical-greece/oclc/174134120 |page=78 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the north side of the Parthenon, the metopes are poorly preserved, but the subject seems to be the [[Iliou persis|sack of Troy]].

Several of the metopes still remain on the building, but, with the exception of those on the northern side, they are severely damaged.

In March 2011, archaeologists announced that they had discovered five [[Metope (architecture)|metopes]] of the Parthenon in the south wall of the Acropolis, which had been extended when the Acropolis was used as a fortress. According to ''Eleftherotypia'' daily, the archaeologists claimed the metopes had been placed there in the 18th century when the Acropolis wall was being repaired. The experts discovered the metopes while processing 2,250 photos with modern photographic methods, as the white Pentelic [[marble]] they are made of differed from the other stone of the wall. It was previously presumed that the missing metopes were destroyed during the Morosini explosion of the Parthenon in 1687.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2011/03/04/archaeologists-discover-new-metopes-of-parthenon/Discovery|title=Discovery Reveals Ancient Greek Theaters Used Moveable Stages Over 2,000 Years Ago |website=greece.greekreporter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frieze===
{{Main|Parthenon Frieze}}
[[File:1868 Lawrence Alma-Tadema - Phidias Showing the Frieze of the Parthenon to his Friends.jpg|thumb|''[[Phidias]] Showing the Frieze of the Parthenon to his Friends'', 1868 painting by [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]]]]

The most characteristic feature in the architecture and decoration of the temple is the Ionic [[frieze]] running around the exterior walls of the cella, which is the inside structure of the Parthenon. The bas-relief frieze was carved in situ; it is dated to 442&amp;nbsp;BC-438&amp;nbsp;BC.

One interpretation is that it depicts an idealized version of the [[Panathenaic Festival|Panathenaic procession]] from the Dipylon Gate in the [[Kerameikos]] to the [[Acropolis]]. In this procession held every year, with a special procession taking place every four years, Athenians and foreigners were participating to honour the goddess [[Athena]], offering sacrifices and a new [[peplos]] (dress woven by selected noble Athenian girls called ''ergastines'').

[[Joan Breton Connelly]] offers a mythological interpretation for the frieze, one that is in harmony with the rest of the temple’s sculptural programme which shows Athenian genealogy through a series of succession myths set in the remote past. She identifies the central panel above the door of the Parthenon as the pre-battle sacrifice of the daughter of [[King Erechtheus]], a sacrifice that ensured Athenian victory over [[Eumolpos]] and his Thracian army. The great procession marching toward the east end of the Parthenon shows the post-battle thanksgiving sacrifice of cattle and sheep, honey and water, followed by the triumphant army of Erechtheus returning from their victory. This represents the very first Panathenaia set in mythical times, the model on which historic Panathenaic processions was based.&lt;ref&gt;Connelly, ''Parthenon and Parthenoi'', 53–80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Connelly, ''The Parthenon Enigma'', chapters 4, 5, and 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pediments===
{{Main|Pediments of the Parthenon}}
The traveller [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], when he visited the Acropolis at the end of the 2nd century AD, only mentioned briefly the sculptures of the [[pediment]]s (gable ends) of the temple, reserving the majority of his description for the gold and ivory statue of the goddess inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/Pausanias1B.html |title=Description of Greece |author=Pausanias |author-link=Pausanias (geographer) |translator-first=W.H.S. |translator-last=Jones |year=1918 |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=Harvard University Press |at=Book 1, 24.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====East pediment====
[[File:Partenon04.JPG|thumb|Part of the east pediment still found on the Parthenon (although part of it, like Dionysos, is a copy)]]

The figures on the corners of the pediment depict the passage of time over the course of a full day.  [[Chariot racing|Tethrippa]] of [[Helios]] and [[Selene]] are located on the left and right corners of the pediment respectively. The horses of Helios's chariot are shown with livid expressions as they ascend into the sky at the start of the day; whereas the Selene's horses struggle to stay on the pediment scene as the day comes to an end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancient.eu/article/780/|title=The Parthenon Sculptures by Mark Cartwright 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details/collection_image_gallery.aspx?partid=1&amp;assetid=1325893001&amp;objectid=461663|title=The British Museum: The Parthenon sculptures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====West pediment====
The supporters of Athena are extensively illustrated at the back of the left chariot, while the defenders of Poseidon are shown trailing behind the right chariot. It is believed that the corners of the pediment are filled by Athenian water deities, such as [[Cephissus (mythology)|Kephisos]] river, [[Ilissos]] river and nymph [[Callirhoe (Greek mythology)|Callirhoe]]. This belief merges from the fluid character of the sculptures' body position which represents the effort of the artist to give the impression of a flowing river.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ascsa.edu.gr/pdf/uploads/hesperia/148069.pdf|title=Athenians and Eleusinians in the West Pediment of the Parthenon }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="britishmuseum.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=461691&amp;partId=1|title=The Parthenon Sculptures, The British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next to the left river god, there are the sculptures of the mythical king of Athens ([[Kekrops]]) with his daughters ([[Aglauros]], [[Pandrosos]], [[Herse]]). The statue of Poseidon was the largest sculpture in the pediment until it broke into pieces during [[Francesco Morosini]]'s effort to remove it in 1688. The posterior piece of the torso was found by Lusieri in the groundwork of a Turkish house in 1801 and is currently held in [[British Museum]]. The anterior portion was revealed by Ross in 1835 and is now held in the [[Acropolis Museum]] of Athens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GFNuxcVKLIkC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;dq=poseidon+torso+morosini#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Pediments of the Prthenon by Olga Palagia|isbn=978-9004111981|last1=Palagia|first1=Olga|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every statue in the west pediment has a fully completed back, which would have been impossible to see when the sculpture was on the temple; this indicates that the sculptors put great effort into accurately portraying the human body.&lt;ref name="britishmuseum.org"/&gt;

===Athena Parthenos===
{{Main|Athena Parthenos}}

The only piece of sculpture from the Parthenon known to be from the hand of Phidias&lt;ref&gt;

It sloped at a greater incline than the original roof and left the building's wings exposed.&lt;ref name = "Chatziaslani"/&gt;

The Parthenon survived as a temple dedicated to Athena for nearly one thousand years until [[Theodosius II]], during the [[Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire]], decreed in 435 AD that all [[pagan]] temples in the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] be closed.&lt;ref name = "Freely69"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QME9WXUnookC&amp;pg=PA69 Freely 2004, p. 69].&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, it is debated exactly when during the 5th-century that the closure of the Parthenon as a temple was actually put in practice.  It is suggested to have occurred in c. 481–484, in the instructions against the remaining temples by order of [[Zeno (emperor)|Emperor Zeno]], because the temple had been the focus of Pagan Hellenic opposition against Zeno in Athens in support of Illus, who had promised to restore Hellenic rites to the temples that were still standing.&lt;ref&gt;Trombley, ''[https://books.google.se/books?id=HZefAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA145&amp;lpg=PA145&amp;dq=statue+allat-athena&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=J8DvCAWQZN&amp;sig=6CwrxUq7hCUokhhLY5j60U_yebU&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi11Zq2o6fbAhXkIJoKHU-fB3EQ6AEITTAM#v=onepage&amp;q=statue%20allat-athena&amp;f=false  Hellenic Religion and Christianization c. 370–529]''&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point in the fifth century, Athena's great [[cult image]] was looted by one of the emperors and taken to [[Constantinople]], where it was later destroyed, possibly during the [[Sack of Constantinople (1204)|siege and sack of Constantinople]] during the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cremin | first = Aedeen | title = Archaeologica | publisher =  Frances Lincoln Ltd. | year = 2007 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=A0llBlzF6UgC&amp;pg=PA170 | page=170 |isbn = 978-0711228221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian church===
The Parthenon was converted into a [[History of Christianity#Early Middle Ages (476–799)|Christian]] church in the final decade of the sixth century AD&lt;ref name="freely"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QME9WXUnookC&amp;pg=PA69 Freely 2004, p. 69] "Some modern writers maintain that the Parthenon was converted into a Christian sanctuary during the reign of [[Justinian]] (527–65)...But there is no evidence to support this in the ancient sources. The existing evidence suggests that the Parthenon was converted into a Christian [[basilica]] in the last decade of the sixth century."&lt;/ref&gt; to become the Church of the Parthenos Maria (Virgin Mary), or the Church of the [[Theotokos]] ([[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mother of God]]). The orientation of the building was changed to face towards the east; the main entrance was placed at the building's western end, and the Christian altar and [[iconostasis]] were situated towards the building's eastern side adjacent to an [[apse]] built where the temple's [[pronaos]] was formerly located.&lt;ref name=Freely70&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QME9WXUnookC&amp;pg=PA70 Freely 2004, p. 70].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hurwit293&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BAnbmQMvdkwC&amp;pg=PA21 Hollis 2009, p. 21].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0pQ4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA293 Hurwit 2000, p. 293].&lt;/ref&gt;  A large central portal with surrounding side-doors was made in the wall dividing the cella, which became the church's [[nave]], from the rear chamber, the church's [[narthex]].&lt;ref name=Freely70/&gt;  The spaces between the columns of the ''opisthodomus'' and the [[peristyle]] were walled up, though a number of doorways still permitted access.&lt;ref name=Freely70/&gt; [[Icons]] were painted on the walls and many Christian inscriptions were carved into the Parthenon's columns.&lt;ref name = "AcropolisRestoration"/&gt;  These renovations inevitably led to the removal and dispersal of some of the sculptures. Those depicting gods were either possibly re-interpreted according to a Christian theme, or removed.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

In 1687, the Parthenon was extensively damaged in the greatest catastrophe to befall it in its long history.&lt;ref name="AcropolisRestoration" /&gt; As part of the [[Great Turkish War|Great Turkish War (1683–1699)]], the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] sent an expedition led by [[Francesco Morosini]] to attack Athens and capture the Acropolis. The Ottoman Turks fortified the Acropolis and used the Parthenon as a [[gunpowder magazine]] – despite having been forewarned of the dangers of this use by the 1656 explosion that severely damaged the [[Propylaea]] – and as a shelter for members of the local Turkish community.&lt;ref name="Tomkinson2"&gt;{{cite web |last=Tomkinson |first=John L. |title=Venetian Athens: Venetian Interlude (1684–1689) |publisher=Anagnosis Books  |url=http://www.anagnosis.gr/index.php?la=eng&amp;pageID=217 | accessdate=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 26 September a Venetian mortar round, fired from the Hill of Philopappus, blew up the magazine, and the building was partly destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Theodor E.

The following year, the Venetians abandoned Athens to avoid a confrontation with a large force the Turks had assembled at [[Chalcis]]; at that time, the Venetians had considered blowing up what remained of the Parthenon along with the rest of the Acropolis to deny its further use as a fortification to the Turks, but that idea was not pursued.&lt;ref name="Tomkinson2" /&gt;

After the Turks had recaptured the Acropolis they used some of the rubble produced by this explosion to erect a smaller mosque within the shell of the ruined Parthenon.&lt;ref name="Tomkinson3"&gt;{{cite web |last=Tomkinson |first=John L. |title=Ottoman Athens II: Later Ottoman Athens (1689–1821) |publisher=Anagnosis Books  |url=http://www.anagnosis.gr/index.php?la=eng&amp;pageID=218 | accessdate=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the next century and a half, portions of the remaining structure were looted for building material and any remaining objects of value.&lt;ref name="Grafton"&gt;{{cite book|last = Grafton| first = Anthony|author2=Glenn W.

The 18th century was a period of [[Sick man of Europe|Ottoman stagnation]]; as a result, many more Europeans found access to Athens, and the picturesque ruins of the Parthenon were much drawn and painted, spurring a rise in [[philhellenism]] and helping to arouse sympathy in Britain and France for Greek independence. Amongst those early travellers and archaeologists were [[James Stuart (1713–1788)|James Stuart]] and [[Nicholas Revett]], who were commissioned by the [[Society of Dilettanti]] to survey the ruins of classical Athens. What they produced was the first measured drawings of the Parthenon published in 1787 in the second volume of ''Antiquities of Athens Measured and Delineated''. In 1801, the British Ambassador at [[Constantinople]], the [[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin|Earl of Elgin]], obtained a questionable ''firman'' (edict) from the [[Sultan]], whose existence or legitimacy has not been proved until today, to make casts and drawings of the antiquities on the Acropolis, to demolish recent buildings if this was necessary to view the antiquities, and to remove sculptures from them.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

===Independent Greece===
[[File:Parthenon 1839.jpg|thumb|right|The first known photograph of the Parthenon was taken by Joly de Lotbinière in October 1839. This is an engraving made after the original daguerreotype. The Ottoman-era mosque can just be seen behind the foreground pillars.]]
[[File:Parthenon.Southern.Side.damaged.jpg|thumb|The southern side of the Parthenon, which sustained considerable damage in the 1687 explosion]]
When independent Greece gained control of Athens in 1832, the visible section of the minaret was demolished; only its base and spiral staircase up to the level of the [[architrave]] remain intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Murray | first = John | title = Handbook for travellers in Greece, Volume 2 | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1884 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ac4GAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA317 | page = 317}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon all the medieval and Ottoman buildings on the Acropolis were destroyed. However, the image of the small mosque within the Parthenon's cella has been preserved in [[Pierre-Gustave Joly de Lotbinière|Joly de Lotbinière]]'s photograph, published in Lerebours's ''Excursions Daguerriennes'' in 1842: the first photograph of the Acropolis.&lt;ref&gt;Neils, ''The Parthenon: From Antiquity to the Present'', 336– the picture was taken in October 1839&lt;/ref&gt; The area became a historical precinct controlled by the Greek government. Today it attracts millions of tourists every year, who travel up the path at the western end of the Acropolis, through the restored [[Propylaea]], and up the Panathenaic Way to the Parthenon, which is surrounded by a low fence to prevent damage.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

===Dispute over the marbles===
{{Main|Elgin Marbles}}
[[File:Pediments of the Parthenon-British Museum.jpg|thumb|Life-size pediment sculptures from the Parthenon in the British Museum]]

The dispute centres around the Parthenon Marbles removed by [[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin]], from 1801 to 1803, which are in the [[British Museum]]. A few sculptures from the Parthenon are also in the [[Louvre]] in Paris, in [[Copenhagen]], and elsewhere, but more than half are in the [[Acropolis Museum]] in Athens.&lt;ref name="Br" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BrIT"&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/10/09/europe/EU_GEN_Greece_Acropolis_Museum.php Greek Premier Says New Acropolis Museum to Boost Bid for Parthenon Sculptures], International Herald Tribune&lt;/ref&gt; A few can still be seen on the building itself. The Greek government has campaigned since 1983 for the British Museum to return the sculptures to [[Greece]].&lt;ref name="BrIT"/&gt; The British Museum has steadfastly refused to return the sculptures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/news_and_press_releases/statements/the_parthenon_sculptures/facts_and_figures.aspx |title=The Parthenon Sculptures: The Position of the British Museum Truistees and Common Misconceptions |publisher=The British Museum |accessdate=18 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and successive British governments have been unwilling to force the Museum to do so (which would require legislation). Nevertheless, talks between senior representatives from Greek and British cultural ministries and their legal advisors took place in London on 4 May 2007. These were the first serious negotiations for several years, and there were hopes that the two sides may move a step closer to a resolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6578661.stm Talks Due on Elgin Marbles Return], BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration==
In 1975, the Greek government began a concerted effort to restore the Parthenon and other Acropolis structures. After some delay, a Committee for the Conservation of the Acropolis Monuments was established in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arcchip.cz/w09/w09_lambrinou.pdf Lina Lambrinou, "State of the Art: ‘Parthenon of Athens: A Challenge Throughout History"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003065235/http://www.arcchip.cz/w09/w09_lambrinou.pdf |date=3 October 2008 }} (pdf file) with bibliography of interim conservation reports;&lt;/ref&gt; The project later attracted funding and technical assistance from the [[European Union]]. An archaeological committee thoroughly documented every [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]] remaining on the site, and architects assisted with [[computer model]]s to determine their original locations. Particularly important and fragile sculptures were transferred to the Acropolis Museum. A crane was installed for moving marble blocks; the crane was designed to fold away beneath the roofline when not in use. In some cases, prior re-constructions were found to be incorrect. These were dismantled, and a careful process of restoration began.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20081003065234/http://cipa.icomos.org/fileadmin/papers/Athens2007/FP111.pdf "The Surface Conservation Project"] (pdf file). Once they had been conserved, the West Frieze blocks were moved to the museum, and copies cast in artificial stone were reinstalled in their places.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, various blocks were held together by elongated iron '''H''' pins that were completely coated in lead, which protected the iron from corrosion. Stabilizing pins added in the 19th century were not so coated, and corroded. Since the corrosion product (rust) is expansive, the expansion caused further damage by cracking the marble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title =Unlocking the Mysteries of the Parthenon |author=Hadingham, Evan |publisher=[[Smithsonian Magazine]] |year=2008 |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/parthenon.html |accessdate=22 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5689">'''Referendary''' is a number of administrative positions, of various rank, in chanceries and other official organisations in Europe.

==Pre-modern history {{anchor|Secular referendaries}} ==
The office of ''{{lang|la|referendarius}}'' (plural: ''{{lang|la|referendarii}}'', from the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|refero}}'', "I inform") existed at the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Court]]. Such officials  reported to the Emperor on the memorials of petitioners, and conveyed to the judges the Emperor's orders in connection with such memorials.

During the [[Frankish Empire]]'s [[Merovingian|Merovingian period]], the official who would later be known as the [[chancellor]] (''{{lang|la|cancellarius}}'') was termed the ''{{lang|la|referendarius}}''. See also [[Royal Administration of Merovingian and Carolingian Dynasties]].

Other medieval kingdoms also had a referendary, e.g., [[Anianus (referendary)|Anianus]], who in 506 CE compiled the ''[[Breviary of Alaric]]'' for that king of the [[Visigoths]].

Later the office proliferated and thus became devalued, as reflected in compound titles differentiating some such offices, e.g., in the [[Offices in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. In later [[iteration]]s of the Polish state, the title occurred again, e.g., as "referendary of state."

A referendary can also be an official ([[Chancellor|Grand Chancellor]]) in an [[order of knighthood]], e.g. the [[Order of Saint Lazarus]].

==Canon law{{anchor|Ecclesiastical referendaries}} ==
{{canon law}}
In the Papal [[Curia Romana]] (court), the office of ''{{lang|la|referendarius apostolicus}}'' ('apostolic referendary') originated in the Middle Ages; their duty was to receive all petitions directed to the Holy See, to report on them to the pope and to tender him advice. The treatment and decision varied according to the nature of the question: if a favour was concerned, it might be either granted or refused; if some dispute, the pope decided whether it should be referred to a judge. The ''{{lang|la|referendarii}}'' were entrusted with all arrangements for these papal decisions, which they had to prepare for the pope's signature (''{{lang|la|signatura}}'').

From these referendarii developed the court of the [[Signatura]] (''{{lang|la|Collegium referendariorum Signaturæ votantium}}''), concerning which there are various papal constitutions. Pope [[Innocent VIII]] (1484–92) introduced a distinction between the referendarii on questions of favours and of justice, whence developed the "{{lang|la|Signatura gratiæ}}" and the "{{lang|la|Signatura justitiæ}}", each competent to give final decision within its sphere. ''{{lang|la|Utriusque Signaturae Apostolicae Referendarius}}'' (attested for Joseph Simeon Assemani), or shorter ''{{lang|la|referendarius utriusque signaturae}}'' (attested for [[Francesco Sforza Pallavicino]]), 'Referendary of both signatures', was a specific title in the Roman Curia, apparently combining both competences.

In the court of the "{{lang|la|Signatura justitiæ}}" developed a distinction between the prelates entitled to vote (''{{lang|la|prœlati votantes}}'') and those whose duties were confined to reporting on individual cases (''{{lang|la|prœlati referendarii}}''). The whole body gradually lost all practical importance, especially after the loss of the [[Papal States]], and was entirely abolished at the reorganization of the Curia by [[Pius X]].

==Germany {{anchor|Referendary in Germany}} ==

In Germany, ''{{lang|de|Referendar}}'' refers to:
* a trainee solicitor/attorney undertaking an articled clerkship as part of his/her professional training, or
* a [[student teacher]] during the practical period of [[teacher training]].

Law graduates are employed and paid by the state. He or she works as a [[law clerk]] at a court. The training comprises several stages that give the ''{{lang|de|Referendar}}'' experience working under supervision in various fields of law. During the first two stages, the ''{{lang|de|Referendar}}'' works as a law clerk for a civil court judge and for the local [[public prosecutor]]'s office.

All law graduates must article as ''{{lang|de|Referendar}}''s for two years before being [[admission to practice law|admitted to practice]]. The traineeship is intended to provide practical knowledge that cannot be taught at [[university]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/495130/Referendar Encyclopædia Britannica: "Referendar (German Jurisprudence)"]&lt;/ref&gt;

For trainee teachers this period lasts between 18 and 24 months depending on the [[states of Germany|state]]. During this time, ''{{lang|de|Referendar}}''s are employed by and paid for by the state as applicants to the "middle" or "upper service" as government employees (''[[Beamter|Beamte]]''), depending on which type of school they are training at. A teacher's traineeship consists of academic courses as well as hands-on teaching. At the end of the traineeship, trainee teachers take their [[Staatsexamen|Second State Examination]] to qualify for government employment as teachers.

According to the [[Jain cosmology]], the '''śalākāpuruṣa''' ({{lang-sa|शलाकपुरूष}}) "illustrious or worthy persons" are 63 illustrious beings who appear during each half-time cycle.&lt;ref name=devdutt&gt;{{cite web  | last =Pattanaik  | first =Devdutt   | title =63 worthy beings  | publisher =Mid-day  | date = 2009-08-18  | url =http://www.mid-day.com/specials/2009/aug/180809-Vardhamana-Mahavir-Jainism-Devlok-Play-24th-Tirthankara.htm| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20120927173952/http://www.mid-day.com/specials/2009/aug/180809-Vardhamana-Mahavir-Jainism-Devlok-Play-24th-Tirthankara.htm| archivedate =2012-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also known as the ''triṣaṣṭiśalākāpuruṣa'' (63 illustrious persons).{{sfn|Jaini|2000|pp=377—378}} The Jain universal or legendary history is a compilation of the deeds of these illustrious persons.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=12}} Their life stories are said to be most inspiring.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2015|p=199}}

The ''śalākāpuruṣa'' comprise 24 ''[[Tirthankara]]s'' (Teaching Gods), twelve [[Chakravartin]] (universal monarchs, emperors of six continents), nine [[Balabhadra]]s (gentle heroes), nine ''Narayanas'' (warrior heroes) and nine ''Prati-narayanas'' (anti-heroes).&lt;ref name=devdutt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=vHnXAAAAMAAJ|title=Jainism in South India|first=P. M.|last=Joseph|date=1997|isbn=9788185692234|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Jain cosmology]], time is without beginning and eternal. The ''Kālacakra'', the cosmic wheel of time, rotates ceaselessly. The wheel of time is divided into two half-rotations, ''Utsarpiṇī'' or ascending time cycle and ''Avasarpiṇī'', the descending time cycle, occurring continuously after each other. ''Utsarpiṇī'' is a period of progressive prosperity and happiness where the time spans and ages are at an increasing scale while the ''[[Avasarpiṇī]]'' is a period of increasing sorrow and immorality with decline in time spans of the epochs.&lt;ref&gt;Kothari, Dr. P. Ajay (2000) p. 90—91&lt;/ref&gt; During each such time cycle, these 63 illustrious persons appear and establish the religion and order in society. According to Jain cosmology, since time is eternal, infinite ''kalacakras'' have elapsed and will occur in future and hence infinite sets of these 63 illustrious persons have appeared, and will appear, to establish order and religion in their respective eras.{{sfn|Kapadia|1941|p=65}}

==Origin and Etymology==
The word ''salakapurusa'' is often translated as illustrious persons or worthy persons or mighty persons. It is derived from the Sanskrit compound of words [[Chuugi|''salaka'']] and ''purusa''. "''Purusa''" means person, but "''salaka''" is of ambiguous etymology in this context. The primary meaning of the word salaka (Sanskrit: ''Śalākā'', Pali: ''salākā'', Prakrit: ''salāgā'', ''salāyā'') is "stick". In the Buddhist context it meant a ticket consisting of wooden sticks meant for voting or to distribute food; but in Jain context it was used to mean a stick and also a measurement and when combined with "purusa" to denote great heroes.&lt;ref&gt;Cort, John (1997) p. 1357&lt;/ref&gt; According to 11th century Jain author, monk [[Acharya Hemachandra]], these persons are called ''salaka'' as they have been specially marked among men. This emphasised that the names of the salakapurusas were underlined or specially significant due to their deeds. John Cort also quotes another author, S. D. Parekh, who emphasises the root meaning of voting sticks and concludes that a salakapurusa is a great person, as his greatness has been accepted by general public.&lt;ref&gt;Cort, John (1997) p. 1358&lt;/ref&gt; Certain ''Śvētāmbara'' texts use the word ''Baladeva'', ''Vāsudeva'' and ''Prativasudeva'' to refer ''Balabhadra'', ''Narayana'' and ''Pratinarayana'' respectively. A 1975 treatise, detailing [[Mahavira]]'s life and doctrine seems to imply the voting-etymology of the word, i.e. they are called ''salakapurusa'', because they are men-that-count.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sramana Bhagavan Mahavira: Life &amp; Doctrine|last=Lalwani|first=K.C.|publisher=Minerva Associates|year=1975|isbn=|location=Calcutta|pages=10–11|quote=The author of the Kalpa Sutra has not bothered about introducing lesser personalities, though nonetheless important as men-that-count (salakapurusas).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of ''salakapurusas'' or Jain universal history started with the biographies of the [[Tirthankara]]s. [[Kalpasutra (Jainism)|Kalpasutra]] gives the names and brief biographies of only tirthankaras. It does not use the word ''salakapurusa''s or mention them by name, but does say that the categories of [[Arihant (Jainism)|Arihant]]s, [[Chakravartin]]s, ''Balabhadras'' and Vasudevas are always born in royal families, thus foreshadowing 54 of the 63 ''salakapurusas''. Furthermore, Jaini traces the origin of list of Baladeva and Vasudeva to the ''Jinacharitra'' (lives of the ''Jina''s) by [[Bhadrabahu]] (3–4th century BCE).{{sfn|Jaini|2000|p=377}} A notable [[hagiography]] of these individuals is [[Hemachandra]]'s ''Triṣaṣṭiśalākāpuruṣacaritra''.&lt;ref name="HemacandraFynes1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hemacandra|author2=R. C. C. Fynes|title=The Lives of the Jain Elders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=quNpKVqABGMC|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-283227-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following [[Jain texts]] chronicle the deeds of the ''salakapurusas'':&lt;ref&gt;John cort p.1356—57&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digambara texts===
*''[[Satkhandagama]]'' (1st century) – This gives a description of Jain universal history in a rudimentary form.
*''[[Tiloya Panatti]]'' by [[Yativṛṣabha]] (7th century) – This text gives descriptions of other Jain heroes i.e. 9 [[Narada]]s, 11 [[Rudra]]s and 24 [[Kamadeva]]s,{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=550}} but specifically states that there are only 63 salakapurusas.
*''[[Adipurana]]'' by [[Jinasena|Acharya Jinasena]] and Gunabhadra (9th century) – This text is also known as Trisastilaksanamahapurana (The great purana describing 63 great heroes). By this time the number of heroes had come to be fixed at 63.
*''Harivamsa Purana'' composed by ''Acharya Jinasena''.

===Śvētāmbara texts===
*''[[Kalpasutra (Jainism)|Kalpasutra]]'' – Devoted mainly to stories of ''[[Rishabhanatha]]'', ''Neminatha'', ''[[Parshvanatha]]'' and Mahavira. It names other tirthankaras and also mentions the categories of Chakravartins, Baldeva and Vasudeva without giving individual names.
*''[[Samavayanga Sutra]]'' – This text gives description of sixty-three and fifty-four salakapurusas in different places.
*''Paumacarya''' by Vimalasuri (2nd century) – This is the Jain version of Ramayana. The story of Rama the eighth Baladeva is narrated within the context of 63 salakapurusas. The later texts were influenced by Paumacarya.
*''Cauppanamahapurisacariya'' by Silanka (9th century) – This narrates the deeds of fifty-four great heroes.
*''Trisastisalakapurusacaritra'' by Hemacandra (11th century) – The deeds of 63 illustrious persons, and one of the most popular text of Jain universal history.
*''Kahavali'' by Bhadresvara (13th century) — This text raised the number of salakapurusa to 72 by adding 9 Naradas.

All traditions of Jainism now agree to the figure of 63 ''salakapurusas''. However, the number of persons is 60 as three persons ([[Shantinath]], [[Kunthunath]] and [[Aranath]]) were ''Chakravartins'' who later on became ''Tirthankaras''.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Tirthankaras==
''[[Tirthankara|Tīrthankaras]]'' (also known as ''Jinas'') are ''Arhatas'' who are teachers and revivers of the Jain philosophy. There are 24 Tīrthankaras in each half time cycle;{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=550}} [[Mahavira|Mahāvīra]] was the 24th and last Tīrthankara of the current descending time cycle and Rishabha was the first Tirthankara. Tīrthankaras are literally "the ford makers", who have shown the way to cross the ocean of rebirth and transmigration and hence have become a focus of reverence and worship amongst Jains. The Tirthankara provides all creatures with the means to liberate the soul from the confines of the body and to rise towards bliss, enlightenment and release from the eternal cycle of rebirth. He advocates continence, truth, non-violence, simplicity and purity for those who seek liberation.  Tīrthankaras ultimately become ''Siddhas'' on liberation.

==Chakravartin==
[[File:14 Ratna of Chakravartin.png|thumb|14 ''Ratna'' (jewels) of Chankravartin. Miniature from the 17th century, ''Saṁgrahaṇīratna'' by Śrīcandra, in Prakrit with a Gujarati commentary. Jain Śvetāmbara cosmological text with commentary and illustrations.]]
A [[Chakravartin]] (Universal Monarch) is the emperor of the world, lord of the material realm.&lt;ref name=devdutt/&gt; Though he possesses worldly power, he often finds his ambitions dwarfed by the enormity of the cosmos. Jain purunas give a list of 12 Chakravartins who flourished in this descending time cycle.{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=550}} Golden in complexion, they all belonged to Kasyapa gotra.&lt;ref&gt;Shah, Umakant Premchand (1987) p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; One of the greatest Chakravartis mentioned in Jain scriptures is Bharata in whose memory India came to be known as "Bharata-varsha". After conquering the whole world, King Bharata, brimming with pride, sought to inscribe his great feat on the slopes of Mount Meru. To his great dismay, he found the names of many other kings carved on Meru. Like him, they too had conquered the world. He was not the first man to do so. He was not the last. There were many before him, there were many after him. Bharata, humbled by the experience, returned to his kingdom to do his duty, aware that his actions were not unique and that his existence was not special.&lt;ref name=devdutt/&gt;  The names of the twelve Chakravartins as per Jain Texts are:&lt;ref&gt;Jaini, J.L. (1940) Appendix III&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Shantinatha.jpg|thumb|Lord Shantinatha, the sixteenth Jain Tirthankara was also a Chakravarti]]
#[[Bharata Chakravarti|Bharata]] - Tirthankara [[Rishabha]]'s son.
#[[Sagara (Vedic king)|Sagara]] - Ancestor of [[Bhagiratha]] as per Hindu [[Puranas]].
# Maghava
#[[Sanatkumara]]
#[[Shantinatha]] - (also a Tirthankara)
#[[Kunthunatha]] - (also a Tirthankara)
#[[Aranatha]] - (also a Tirthankara)
#[[Subhuma]]
#Padmanabha
#[[Harishena]]
# Jayasena
#[[Brahmadatta]]

In Jainism, a chakravarti was characterised by possession of ''saptaratna'', or "seven jewels":
# [[Sudarshana Chakra]], a miraculous wheel that never misses its target
# Queen
# Huge army of chariots
# Jewellery
# Immense wealth
# Huge army of horses
# Huge army of elephants

Some texts cite ''navaratna'' or "nine jewels" instead, adding "prime minister" and "son". Some texts even further expands to 14 ''Ratna'', jewels.

==Triad of Baladeva, Vasudeva and Prativasudeva==
[[File:Weapons and symbols of Vasudeva or Narayana.png|thumb|Weapons and symbols of Vasudeva or Narayana. Miniature from the 17th century, ''Saṁgrahaṇīratna'' by Śrīcandra, in Prakrit with a Gujarati commentary. Jain Śvetāmbara cosmological text with commentary and illustrations.]]
In every half time cycle, there are 9 sets of ''[[Balabhadra]]s'' (gentle heroes), ''Vasudevas'' (violent heroes) and ''Prativāsudevas'' (anti-heroes).{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=550}} Unlike in the Hindu Puranas, the names ''Balabhadra'' and ''Narayana'' are not restricted to [[Balarama]] and [[Krishna]] in Jain puranas. Instead they serve as names of two distinct classes of mighty half brothers, who appear nine times in each half of the time cycles of the [[Jain cosmology]] and jointly rule half the earth as half-chakravarti. Ultimately ''Prati-naryana'' is killed by ''Narayana'' for his unrighteousness and immorality. Jaini traces the origin of this list of brothers to the ''Jinacaritra'' (lives of the [[Tirthankara|Jinas]]) by [[Bhadrabahu]] swami (3-4th century BCE).{{sfn|Jaini|2000|p=377}} Jain Ramayana is based on the stories of [[Rama in Jainism|Rama]], [[Lakshmana]] and [[Ravana]] who are the eighth [[Balabhadra|Baladeva]], ''Narayana'', ''Pratinarayana'' and respectively. Similarly ''[[Harivamsa Purana]]'' is based on the stories of [[Balarama]], [[Krishna]] and [[Jarasandha]], who are the ninth and the last set of ''Balabhadra'', ''Narayana'', and ''Pratinarayana''.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=305}} However, the main battle is not the Mahabharata, but the fight between Krishna and Jarasandha who is killed by Krishna.

According to Jain texts, ''Narayana'' are generally of dark complexion and wear yellow garments. There are seven weapons and symbols of ''Narayana'', namely: conch, discus ([[sudarshana chakra]]), club, bow, sword, jewel (kaustubha mani) and a garland of flowers (vanamala). Baladevas, half-brothers of Vasudevas, are described as fair in complexion and wear garments of dark blue and have a banner of palm tree. Their symbols or weapons are: bow, plough, pestle and arrow. The two brothers are inseparable and they jointly rule three continents as half-Chakravarti. Although ''Narayana'' is the mightier of the two, ''Balabhadra'' is depicted as superior for his non-violent ways and he achieves liberation. According to the Jain ''puranas'', the ''Balabhadras'' lead an ideal Jain life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=2pnXAAAAMAAJ|p=146|title=Jainism and Prakrit in Ancient and Medieval India|isbn=9788173040511|author1=Jain|first1=Jagdish Chandra|last2=Bhattacharyya|first2=Narendra Nath|date=1994-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of nine ''Balabhadra'', eight attain liberation and the last one goes to heaven. On the other hand, ''Narayana'' go to hell on account of their violent exploits, even though they did these in order to uphold righteousness.&lt;ref&gt;Shah, Umakant Premchand (1987) p. 74–75&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rama Lakshmana.jpg|thumb|Rama and Lakshmana are the eighth set of Baladeva and Vasudeva according to the Jain universal history]]

==Hierarchy==
Out of the above five classes of illustrious persons, Tirthankaras are placed at the top. They establish the religion and attain liberation. The Chakravarti attain liberation if they renounce their kingdom, or else go to hell if they indulge in sensual pleasures. Next in rank are Baladevas who are gentle heroes and devout laymen, who attain liberation corresponding to Tirthankaras. Vasudevas are also devout Jain laymen and ultimately attain liberation, but are first reborn in hell because of their violent actions.

The mother of a Tirthankara sees 16 [[Auspicious dreams in Jainism|auspicious dreams]] dreams (14 dreams in some traditions) when the soul descents into her womb. The mother of a Vasusdeva sees seven dreams, while that of a ''Balabhadra'' sees only four dreams. The mother of a Prati-vasudeva sees no dreams.&lt;ref&gt;Cort, John (1997) p. 1360&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain Jain texts also depict the comparative powers of ''Salakapurusas'' in the following manner:&lt;ref&gt;Muni Nagraj. p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;
*A bull is as powerful as 12 warriors.
*A horse is as powerful as 10 bulls.
*A buffalo is as powerful as 12 horses.
*An elephant is as powerful as 15 buffalos.
*A lion with a mane is as powerful as 500 elephants.
*An octoped (Astapada mythical eight limbed animal) is as powerful as 2,000 maned lions.
*A Baldeva is as powerful as 1 million octopeds.
*A Vasudeva  is as powerful as 2 Baldevs. (A Prati-vasudeva  is slightly less powerful that a Vasudeva)
*A Chakravartin is as powerful as 2 Vasudevs.
*A king of serpent gods is as powerful as 100,000 [[Chakravartin#Jain tradition|Chakravartins]].
*An [[Indra#Jainism|Indra]] is as powerful as 10 million kings of serpent gods.
*The power of innumerable Indras is insignificant as compared to that of the small finger of a [[Tirthankara]].

==Other classes of heroes==
In Jain universal history, other than these 63 Salakapurusa, there are other classes of 106 people who, though not depicted as salakapurusas, are important enough to be mentioned separately. They are:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7664">'''Sharanagathi''' or '''Prapatti''' ([[Sanskrit]] for "surrender"), in the devotional school of Hindu denominations known as [[Vaishnavism]], is the process of total [[Surrender (spirituality and psychology)|surrender]] to God ([[Vishnu]] or [[Krishna]]). The process of Saranagati forms the basis of devotion to [[God in Hinduism|Godhead]] in the [[bhakti]] traditions within the [[Sri Sampradaya]], propagated by [[Ramanujacharya]] (1017–1137 CE) and the [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Gaudiya Sampradaya]], founded by [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] (1482–1533 CE). Ramanuja considered surrender to Vishnu and His consort [[Lakshmi]] to be the highest goal of life, while Chaitanya emphasizes surrender to [[Krishna]] and his consort [[Radha]] as supreme.

==Spiritual initiation==
The formal ritual of Saranagati or Prapatti is a Vedic and Puranic, scriptural and tradition backed ritual called Pancha-Samskara or "the five impressions" and another name is Samashrayanam. The individual receives the following:
* An initiation 'spiritual' name such as a name of [[Vishnu]] or one of his devotees such as Ramanujacharya, suffixed with the word ''dasa'' (meaning "servant" or servant of). Examples being ''Vishnu dasa'', or ''Ramanuja dasa''. (Nama samskara)
* Tiruman or [[Tilaka]] on the foreheand and 12 marks on certain parts of the body, which signifies that they belong to Vishnu and that their bodies, minds and Souls is the walking temple of Laxshmi-Narayana. (Pundra samskara)
* Special branding on the shoulders of the Conch ([[Panchajanya]]) and Chakra or wheel ([[Sudarshana]]) of Vishnu by the [[guru]]. (Thapa samskara)
* Learning to do [[Archana (Hinduism)|Archana]] or [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] or ritual worship of Laxshmi-Narayana from the Guru. (Yajna samskara)
* Learning three special mantras to Vishnu from the guru. (Mantra Samskara)*
&lt;br /&gt;
[http://www.srivaishnavam.com/stotras/stotraratna_sans.pdf Sri Alavandhar Stotram/Stotra Ratnam] by [[Yamunacharya|Bhagawad Sri Yamunacharya]] features following shloka which defines Saranagathi&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''''Na Dharma Nishthosmi Na Cha Atmavedi'''''&lt;br /&gt;
'''''Na BhaktimansTvat Charanaravinde |'''''&lt;br /&gt;
'''''Akinchanonanyagati Sharanyam&lt;/big&gt;'''''&lt;br /&gt;
'''''Tvat Padamoolam Sharanam Prapadye ||'''''&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
O Lord, I do not know Dharma, I do not know Dnyana, I do not have Bhakti in your divine Lotus Feet. All I have is I am Akinchan (one who does not have anything), and Ananyagati (One who is totally dependent ONLY on You). This akinchan and ananyagati soul is surrendered to your Lotus Feet.&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;
In Sri Bhagavadgeeta Bhagawan Sri Krishna explains Saranagati to Arjuna after explaining in detail Karma, Dnyana, Bhakti Yogas. Sri Bhagawadgeeta is a saar of all the vedas, upanishads, puranaas. And The following shloka is a saar of Sri Bhagawadgeeta. This shloka being Saranagathi mantram offered by Lord Sri Krishna to Arjuna, it is regarded as one of the three divine mantras of Srivaishnavism. It is also called as Charam Mantra&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;
'''''Sarva Dharmaan Parityajya Mamekam Sharanam Vraja|'''''&lt;br /&gt;
'''''Aham tva sarva papebhyo moksha ishyami ma shuchaha||'''''&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
O Arjun, you relinquish all dharmas and surrender unto me. I shall deliver you from all the sins. Grieve not!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[Swami Sri Sitaramacharya]] (Vaikunth Mandap, Ayodhya) elaborated above charama shloka in Hindi Chhanda.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''''Dharmo Me Sadhan Bhava Taji Kainkarya Ki Kari Bhavana'''''&lt;br /&gt;
'''''Muzako Hi Sadhan Maani Raho Yadi Param Pad Hai Pavana'''''&lt;br /&gt;
'''''Mat Prapti Pratibandhak Agho Se Avashi Tohi Chhudavunga'''''&lt;br /&gt;
'''''Mati Shoch Nischaya Parampadmein bhi tumhe pachuchavunga'''''&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Leave sadhan bhav (upaya bhava) in all the dharma or activities and treat them as bhagavad kainkarya (seva) received from Bhagawan. You treat Only ME as your Sadhan (Upay/Means) if you want to attain Param Padam. I will release you from everything that obstructs you from attaining ME (may that be Papa or Punya. Even those punya or sukrut which take us away from the Lord should be treated as Papa or Agha). Do not worry I Shall even carry you to the Param Pad Dham.

Although often used interchangeably in common parlance, Saranagati is different from Prapatti. Saranagati refers to the seeking of God as the ultimate means for liberation, whereas Prapatti is the surrender of one's ego to receive the grace of God. The surrender of one's ego through Prapatti leads to the opening up of the grace of God whereas the invocation of the always freely available grace of God through prayer disarms one's resistance to goodness. Charama Sloka (Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 18, Verse 66) describes Saranagati whereas the fourth injunction of Shri Krishna "Ma Namaskuru" (Prostrate to Me) in the previous verse (Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 18, Verse 65) describes Prapatti. Prapatti is necessary at the end of all yoga practices because all of them boosts the ego by giving Siddhi-s (extraordinary powers or perfections) which prevents the merger of the individual consciousness with God consciousness. Renunciation of Siddhi-s leads to Kaivalyam, that is, Liberation (Patanjali Yoga Sutra-s 3.50-52). When Arjuna surrendered to Shri Krishna at the beginning of the Bhagavad Gita partly because of weakness, there was not much merit to deserve anything in return other than the teaching that would empower him, whereas after hearing the teaching and after practicing the yoga to fulfill his responsibilities that would earn him security, wealth, fame etc., he could offer something to receive the grace. However, since it is almost always practically impossible to practice Yoga well enough to become perfect in one lifetime because of the sinful tendencies accumulated over countless births, sufferings that are endemic in this world, and temptations that always distracts one from the path, and since it is difficult for a great personality like Arjuna to be humble, Shri Krishna offers unconditionally the ultimate option of Saranagati for release, which is the dependence on Him, Who is an infinite ocean of love, omnipotent and infallible.

==In practice==
In Sri Vaisnava Tradition Saranagati is divided into six divisions:
#Accepting those things that are favorable for devotion to God (''anukulyasya sankalpa'')
#Rejecting those things that are averse to surrender to God (''pratikulyasya varjanam'')
#Considering God to be one's protector in all circumstances (''raksisyatiti visvasa'')
#Accepting God as one's maintainer (''goptrtve varanam'')
#Surrendering everything in God's service (''atma-niksepa'')
#Cultivating a humble attitude (''karpanya'')

In Goudiya Tradition Saranagati is Divided into ten Parts
#Dainya
#Atma Nivedana
#Goptritve Varana
#Avasya Raksibe Krsna Visvasa Palana
#Bhakti Anukula Matra Karyera Svikara
#Bhakti Pratikula Bhava Varjanangikara
#Bhajan Lalasa
#Siddhi Lalasa
#Vijnapti
#Sri Nama Mahatmya

In ultimate vaishnavism  sampradhya the nutshell is
Saranagathi has 6 elements -5 angas &amp; an angi
# acknowledging ones helplessness
# determination not to err again
# vowing to follow rules
#unshakeable faith that the Lord is the sole refuge
#seeking the lord as protector
*These are 5 angas 
*surrender itself in accordance with 5 angas is called angi

The '''Temple of Claudius''', also variously known as the ''Temple of the Divus Claudius'', the ''Temple of the Divine Claudius'' and the ''Temple of the Deified Claudius'', was an ancient structure that covered a large area to the south of the [[Colosseum]] in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]. Little remains visible today.
[[File:Détail de la maquette de Rome à lépoque de Constantin (5840455090).jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|The Temple of Claudius to the south (left) of the Colosseum (photo of the model of Imperial Rome at the [[Museum of Roman Civilization|Museo della Civilta Romana in Rome)]].]]

==History==
Construction of the Temple of Claudius on the [[Caelian Hill]] was begun by [[Agrippina the Younger|Agrippina]], the fourth wife of [[Claudius|the Emperor Claudius]], on his death in 54 AD. It was subsequently damaged by the [[Great Fire of Rome]] and further destroyed by Agrippina's son, [[Nero]], but later rebuilt by [[Vespasian|the Emperor Vespasian]], who became emperor in 69 AD. The destruction by Nero was probably due to his extension of the [[Aqua Claudia]] aqueduct to the Caelian Hill but part may also have been removed to make way for the construction of his [[Domus Aurea]]. The last mention of the temple is from the fourth century and nothing is known of what happened to it after Vespasian’s reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Platner|first1=Samuel Ball|title=A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome,|date=1929|publisher=OUP|location=London|pages=120–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If still in use by the 4th-century, the temple would have been closed during the [[persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire]].

==Location==
[[File:Celio - tempio del divo Claudio - resti ai santi Giovanni e Paolo 1774.JPG|upright=1.0|thumb|Remains of the Temple at the base of the tower of the basilica of [[Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Rome]]]]

The area occupied by the Temple is approximately bounded by the present roads of Via Claudia, Viale del Parco del Celio and the [[Clivus Scauri]]. The temple stood on a great rectangular platform (180 x 200 meters), supported by powerful retaining walls of 15 metres or more, that are still partly visible. The actual temple was constructed on a podium 20 steps above the surrounding platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rome: Overview of Buildings|url=http://gallery.sjsu.edu/oldworld/ancientrome/empire/list/index.html|accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The entrance to the courtyard was from the south, through a monumental central entrance with an imposing stairway, oriented towards the [[Palatine Hill]]. The platform itself has been difficult for archaeologists to interpret but it is believed to have included equestrian statues of Claudius.

[[File:Celio - via Claudia t divo claudio sostruzioni 1040173.JPG|upright=1.0|thumb|left|View of the temple from via Claudia]]
The known remains are of the four sides of the platform and nothing remains of the temple above. The western side of the platform was constructed with [[travertine]] and some remains were incorporated into the bell tower of the basilica of [[Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Rome|Santi Giovanni e Paolo]]. The northern side was composed of a row of vaulted rooms. During the time of Nero there were fountains and the remains of one of these, consisting of a ship's bow with a boar's head, were found and are now in the [[Capitoline Museums]]. Vespasian subsequently reduced the consumption of water, returning it to civilian use. The east side is the best preserved, and changes carried out by Nero can be noted here. The area was rediscovered when a new road, the Via Claudia, was constructed in 1880. Underneath the temple area there are tunnels through [[tufa]] that have recently been mapped by the Italian authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Marco Gradozzi, [http://www.romasotterranea.it/sotterranei-del-tempio-di-claudio-al-celio.html "Sotterranei del Tempio di Claudio al Celio"].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Jewish Star''''' was a newspaper which appeared in two editions, both produced in [[Calgary, Alberta]], from 1980 to 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Gloria M. Strathern, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=FRDFGO1LqgsC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Alberta+Newspapers,+1880-1982:+An+historical+directory&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qxrhRErU-h&amp;sig=bVSaYe1iYOe97WFguYUsfGaEj24&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6caMU6iOLqmrsQSM34D4BA&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Alberta%20Newspapers%2C%201880-1982%3A%20An%20historical%20directory&amp;f=false Alberta Newspapers, 1880-1982: An Historical Directory]'', Edmonton: [[University of Alberta Press]], 1988, pp. 51, 115.&lt;/ref&gt; The fortnightly Calgary edition ({{ISSN|0228-2283}}) of ''The Jewish Star'' was the first independent Jewish newspaper published in that city; the monthly [[Edmonton]] edition ({{ISSN|0228-6017}}) of ''The Jewish Star'' was the first independent Jewish newspaper published for the provincial capital. Both editions were tabloid-sized newspapers (ranging from 8 to 28 pages per issue) mailed on a controlled circulation basis to virtually all Jewish households in each city.

==History==
''The Jewish Star'' was founded by Douglas Wertheimer, who served as Editor and President of The Jewish Star Newspaper, Ltd., and Gila Wertheimer, Associate Editor,&lt;ref&gt;"Jewish paper opens in Calgary," ''Jewish Western Bulletin'' (Vancouver), August 28, 1980, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"First Commercial Jewish Newspaper in Calgary," ''[[Cleveland Jewish News]]'', September 5, 1980, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; with start-up funding from family members, supporters and bank loans.&lt;ref&gt;''The Jewish Star'', Calgary Edition, June 1, 1990, p. 4; “Five Years Later,” ''The Jewish Star'', Calgary Edition, August 23, 1985, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The founding of the newspaper coincided with an explosion of economic growth in Alberta related to the oil industry.&lt;ref&gt;Max Rubin, “Alberta’s Jews: The Long Journey,” in Howard and Tamara Palmer (eds.), ''Peoples of Alberta: Portraits of Cultural Diversity'', Saskatoon: Western Producer Prairie Books, 1985, p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt; Calgary, known since 1945 as one of Canada’s fastest-growing cities, had undergone a population increase of 47 percent from 1971 to 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Max I. Foran, “Calgary,” ''[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]'' (Edmonton: Hurtig Publishers, 2nd edition,  1988), volume 1, page 315.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the Calgary Jewish community had increased by 50 percent from 1975-79 to about 6,000 Jews.&lt;ref&gt;“First issue of Jewish newspaper published in Calgary,” ''JTA Community News Reporter'', New York, vol. 19, August 29, 1980, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The two editions of the independent ''Jewish Star'' appeared at a time when the organized Jewish communities across Canada were "moving to take over Jewish weeklies."&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Baskin, "Canada," ''American Jewish Year Book'', Vol. 82, New York: American Jewish Committee, 1982, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the state of Jewish journalism in Canada left "a great deal to be desired," according to historian Stuart E. Rosenberg.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart E. Rosenberg, ''The Jewish Community in Canada'', Vol. 2, Toronto: McClelland and Stewart Ltd., 1971, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

Commenting on the start-up of the Calgary edition of ''The Jewish Star'', the ''[[Calgary Herald]]'' noted that the paper had "avoided some of the more obvious first-issue pitfalls by using good layout, attractive printing free of typographical errors, professional writing by three international Jewish wire services and plenty of local content... there was [also] a heavy advertising content."&lt;ref&gt;"Calgarians try luck with new Jewish paper," ''Calgary Herald'', September 27, 1980, p. G12&lt;/ref&gt; After the launch of the Calgary edition (published from August 22, 1980 through June 1, 1990), the Jewish Community Council in Edmonton invited the publishers to produce a separate Edmonton Edition.&lt;ref&gt;Levendel, ''A Century of the Canadian Jewish Press'', p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; It ran as a monthly from December 1980&lt;ref&gt;"Calgary Jewish Star starts Jewish Star in Edmonton," ''JTA Community News Reporter'', February 6, 1981, p. 2; "Edmonton Jewish Star begins monthly service," ''[[Canadian Jewish News]]'', February 19, 1981, p. 6; "New monthly newspaper serves Edmonton Jewry," ''Jewish Western Bulletin'' (Vancouver), February 26, 1981, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; through June 1990, utilizing some of the same content. While also independent, it received a guaranteed annual purchase of subscriptions (an arrangement voluntarily terminated by ''The Jewish Star'' in 1987).&lt;ref&gt;''The Jewish Star'', Edmonton Edition, September 1987, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s, the company was the sole independent publisher in Canada of more than one Jewish newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;In the United States, the ''Heritage-Southwest Jewish Press'' of Los Angeles was then printing editions for four southern California areas (''The Jewish Star'', November 14, 1980, p. 8).&lt;/ref&gt; From around 1984, it began taking on typesetting jobs, including typesetting and photographic services for [[William D. Peacock]]'s ''Native Albertan'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Jewish Star'', Calgary edition, September 21, 1984, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; the Italian-language newspaper ''[[Lo Stivale]]'',&lt;ref&gt;“Mostly About People,” ''The Jewish Star'', Calgary edition, May 4, 1984, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and D. Bercuson and D. Wertheimer's 241-page book, ''A Trust Betrayed'' (Doubleday, 1981). In the late 1980s, it made an unsuccessful attempt to purchase the ''Jewish Western Bulletin'' of [[Vancouver]].&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Jewish Star'', August 15, 2008, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editorial, advertising, circulation==
For the Calgary Edition, local news, editorial and advertising content were generated mainly by full-time ''Jewish Star'' staff, with other material for that edition coming from freelance writers and syndicated news services. For the Edmonton Edition, over the years a freelance writer provided local news coverage, and for most of the decade advertising was handled by the Dave Moser Agencies in that city. In 1988, controlled circulation for the Calgary edition averaged 1,900 copies, for the Edmonton edition 1,500.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Michel Lacroix, ''Anatomie de la presse ethnique au Canada'' (Presses Universitaires de Bordeaux, Centre d’etudes Canadiennes de Bordeaux, 1988, {{ISBN|2-85892-113-X}}), p. 276; “Five Years Later,” ''The Jewish Star'', Calgary Edition, August 23, 1985, chart, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The editorial position of the newspapers was characterized as displaying “a small ‘l’ liberal stance,”&lt;ref&gt;Levendel, ''A Century of the Canadian Jewish Press'', p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; with "no religious axe to grind." &lt;ref&gt;D. Wertheimer, quoted in ''[[Edmonton Journal]]'', Jan. 26, 1981, p. B6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and recognition==
In ''A Century of the Canadian Jewish Press: 1880s-1980s'', author Lewis Levendel wrote of ''The Jewish Star'' editions, “The most exciting event in Canadian Jewish journalism in the 1980s has been the brave attempt by an Alberta couple to launch an independent newspaper... ''The Stars'' – by far the most attractive of Canadian Jewish papers – have been showered with praise for their appearance, editorials and news coverage... Outside Alberta, Jewish journalists and communal officials familiar with the ''Star'' expressed admiration for the paper”.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Levendel, ''A Century of the Canadian Jewish Press: 1880s-1980s'' (Ottawa: Borealis Press, 1989, {{ISBN|0-88887-907-5}}), pp. 237, 242-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s, ''The Jewish Star'' (Calgary Edition) won more journalistic awards than any other Jewish publication in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Shaula Fraenkel, compiler, ''The Jewish Star (Calgary edition) index, 1980-1986''. Calgary: The Jewish Star Newspaper Ltd., 1990, {{ISBN|0-9694650-0-9}}, Preface.&lt;/ref&gt; The editors won first place [[Simon Rockower Award|Rockower Awards]] of the [[American Jewish Press Association]] in 1982 (editorial writing)&lt;ref&gt;[https://newspapers.library.in.gov/cgi-bin/indiana?a=d&amp;d=JPOST19821112-01.1.6&amp;srpos=1&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-%22winners+are+named+in+jewish+journalism%22------ "Winners Are Named in Jewish Journalism,"] ''The Jewish Post and Opinion'', November 12, 1982, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Chronicle cops two new Rockower Awards," ''[[The Jewish Chronicle of Pittsburgh]]'', November 4, 1982, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1984 (tied, editorial),&lt;ref&gt;"Ellen Hyde, Rokover [sic] awardee," ''The Jewish Chronicle of Pittsburgh'', May 3, 1984, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; an honorable mention in 1985 (design),&lt;ref&gt;"Star is Cited for Design Excellence," ''The Jewish Star'', Calgary Edition, April 19, 1985, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and a second place award in 1987 (editorial).&lt;ref&gt;Fraenkel, ''The Jewish Star (Calgary edition) index, 1980-1986'', p. 3; “Five Years Later,” ''The Jewish Star'', Calgary Edition, August 23, 1985, sidebar, p. 6; “Prize to Star For Editorial,” ''The Jewish Star'', Calgary Edition, May 15, 1987, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

From its launching, ''The Jewish Star'' was one of only two Canadian Jewish publications to produce its own book reviews, rather than reprint syndicated columns.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Canadian Jewish News]]'', Jan. 28, 1982, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Gila Wertheimer, among the most prolific literary critics in the Jewish media (having reviewed 206 books in ''The Jewish Star''), also had pieces published in ''Judaica Book News'' (New York) and Canadian Jewish newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;''The Jewish Star'', Calgary Edition, Feb. 19, 1982, p. 5; ''Chicago Jewish Star'', February 22, 1991, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies and issues==

===Calgary===
The Calgary Jewish Community Council had published an in-house non-commercial newspaper, the ''[[Calgary Jewish News]]'', since 1962 (Douglas Wertheimer served as editor from 1979–80). For several years after the founding of the ''Calgary Jewish Star'', tension existed between the organized community and the independent newspaper, reflected in frank reporting on the community. Early editorials were critical of the organized community for allowing its Jewish community center to be opened on [[Shabbat]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Jewish Star'', Calgary Edition, “The Centre’s Shabbat Policy,” editorial, January 9, 1981, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and for its treatment of visiting Israeli officials,&lt;ref&gt;''The Jewish Star'', Calgary Edition, “An Embarrassment to Calgary’s Jews,” editorial, March 6, 1981, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and provided a forum for others who sought change.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., “Rabbi Accuses Past CJCC Executive of Ignoring Basic Jewish Services,” Rabbi P. Hayman Letter to the Editor, ''The Jewish Star'', Calgary Edition, February 3, 1984, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Community officials characterized ''The Star'' as “a divisive force”.&lt;ref&gt;Levendel, ''A Century of the Canadian Jewish Press'', p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper also faulted the Canadian Jewish establishment for its dismissive attitude towards Western Canadian Jews&lt;ref&gt;e.g., ''The Jewish Star'', Calgary Edition, editorials of January 23, 1981, May 27, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; and in particular for its stance on the rescue of Ethiopian Jews.&lt;ref&gt;See ''The Jewish Star'', Calgary Edition, editorials of May 15, 1981 and June 24, 1986; Douglas  Wertheimer, “Ethiopian Rescue: The Establishment and the Activists,” ''Chicago Jewish Star'', April 4, 2008, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edmonton===
In general the Edmonton Edition of ''The Star'' was less controversial than its Calgary counterpart,&lt;ref&gt;Levendel, ''A Century of the Canadian Jewish Press'', p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; although inevitably material upset community officials (including an article by an Israeli [[shaliach]] about the end of the Edmonton Jewish community).&lt;ref&gt;Danny Nishlis, “The Telegram,” ''The Jewish Star'', Edmonton Edition, December 1987, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calgary and Edmonton===
At the end of 1982, a high school teacher in a small town between Calgary and Edmonton was fired for devoting classroom time to teaching the myth of the Jewish world-conspiracy. The case of [[James Keegstra|Jim Keegstra]] of [[Eckville, Alberta|Eckville]] soon attracted national attention. One of the results was the testing, in court, of the hate promotion section of the Criminal Code of Canada. Beginning in April 1983 and for years afterwards, ''The Jewish Star'' covered the story, which included criticism of the handling of the case by the provincial government of [[Peter Lougheed]], the [[Canadian Jewish Congress]], and the ''[[Calgary Herald]]''.&lt;ref&gt;David J. Bercuson and Douglas Wertheimer, ''A Trust Betrayed: The Keegstra Affair'', 1985, chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Utilizing that knowledge, research materials, and interviews, D. Wertheimer collaborated with [[University of Calgary]] historian [[David Bercuson|David J. Bercuson]] on a book-length study, ''A Trust Betrayed: The Keegstra Affair''  (published by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] in Canada and the US, 1985, {{ISBN|0-385-25003-7}}; Bantam Seal paperback, 1987, {{ISBN|0-7704-2155-5}}). The book was called “a first rate account” in a ''[[Toronto Star]]'' review.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sunday [Toronto] Star'', Dec. 29, 1985, p. E10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before the Keegstra controversy forced the Calgary and Edmonton Jewish communities to coordinate activities, ''The Star'' endorsed a unifying Jewish council for the province,&lt;ref&gt;''The Jewish Star'', Calgary Edition, March 5, 1982, p. 4; Edmonton Edition, March 1982, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; which was eventually created.&lt;ref&gt;''The Jewish Star'', Calgary Edition, August 17, 1984, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Newspapers’ closing==
Both editions of ''The Jewish Star'' published their final issues in June 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Editorial, "Dear Reader: It's Time to Say Goodbye," ''The Jewish Star'', Calgary Edition, June 1, 1990, p. 4; ''The Jewish Star'', Edmonton Edition, June 1990, p. 1; [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1812&amp;dat=19900620&amp;id=tJpaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qksDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3024,3627426 "''Jewish Star'' of Calgary, Edmonton, being sold,"] ''[[The Jewish Post &amp; News]]'', June 20, 1990, p. 16; ''[[American Jewish Year Book]] 1992, vol. 92'', New York: American Jewish Committee, 1992, p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following month the Wertheimers left Canada and started the independent ''[[Chicago Jewish Star]]'', that city’s first new Jewish newspaper published solely for that area in nearly 75 years.&lt;ref&gt;“The Jewish Star, an independent Chicago area paper, debuts,” ''Chicago Jewish Star'' ({{ISSN|1054-1365}}) Vol. I, No. 1 (February 22, 1991), pp. 1, 4; ''American Jewish Year Book 1950, Volume 51'', New York: American Jewish Committee, 1950, p. 492; ''American Jewish Year Book 1955, Volume 56'', New York: American Jewish Committee, 1955, p. 552.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Walter Arnold Kaufmann''' (July 1, 1921 – September 4, 1980) was a German-American [[philosopher]], translator, and [[poet]].  A prolific author, he wrote extensively on a broad range of subjects, such as [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]] and [[death]], [[moral philosophy]] and [[existentialism]], [[theism]] and [[atheism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]], as well as [[philosophy]] and [[literature]]. He served more than 30 years as a professor at [[Princeton University]].

He is renowned as a scholar and translator of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. He also wrote a 1965 book on [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and published a translation of [[Goethe's Faust|Goethe's ''Faust'']].

==Biography==
Kaufmann was raised a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]]. At age 11, finding that he believed neither in the [[Trinity]] nor in the divinity of [[Jesus]], he converted to [[Judaism]].&lt;ref name="Heretic book"&gt;"After my conversion, we went to the synagogue together for many years ... ." Kaufmann, W., 1961. ''[http://taimur.sarangi.info/2008/05/06/the-faith-of-a-heretic/ The Faith Of A Heretic.]'' Doubleday &amp; Co., p.18.&lt;/ref&gt; Kaufmann subsequently discovered that his grandparents were all Jewish. Kaufmann left Germany and emigrated to America in 1939 and began studying at [[Williams College]], where he majored in philosophy and took many religion classes. Although he had the opportunity to move immediately into his graduate studies in philosophy, and despite advice not to do so by his professors, he ultimately joined the war effort against the Nazis by serving in U.S. intelligence. During [[World War II]], he fought on the European front for 15 months. After the war, he completed a PhD in the [[philosophy of religion]] at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] in a mere two years. His dissertation was titled "Nietzsche's Theory of Values" and eventually became a chapter in his ''[[Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist]]'' (1950).

He spent his entire career thereafter, from 1947 to 1980, teaching philosophy at [[Princeton University]], where his students included the Nietzsche scholars [[Frithjof Bergmann]], [[Richard Schacht]], [[Alexander Nehamas]], and [[Ivan Soll]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Kaufmann became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States of America in 1960.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Philosophical work==
In a 1959 article in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', he summarily rejected all religious values and practice, especially the liberal [[Protestantism]] of continental Europe that began with [[Schleiermacher]] and culminated in the writings of [[Paul Tillich]] and [[Rudolf Bultmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Kaufmann, Walter |date=February 1959 | title=Faith of a Heretic | work= Harper's Magazine | url=http://walterkaufmann.com/articles/1959_Faith_of_Heretic.pdf | accessdate=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their place, he praised moralists such as the [[bible|biblical]] [[Nevi'im|prophets]], the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], and [[Socrates]]. He argued that critical analysis and the acquisition of knowledge were liberating and empowering forces. He forcefully criticized the fashionable liberal Protestantism of the 20th century as filled with contradictions and evasions, preferring the austerity of the [[book of Job]] and the Jewish existentialism of [[Martin Buber]]. Kaufmann discussed many of these issues in his 1958 ''Critique of Religion and Philosophy''.

Kaufmann wrote a good deal on the [[existentialism]] of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and [[Karl Jaspers]]. Kaufmann had great admiration for Kierkegaard's passion and his insights on freedom, anxiety, and individualism.&lt;ref name="Kierkegaard"&gt;Kaufmann, W., 1980. ''Discovering the Mind''. McGraw-Hill, page 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Kaufmann wrote: "Nobody before Kierkegaard had seen so clearly that the freedom to make a fateful decision that may change our character and future breeds anxiety."&lt;ref name="Kierkegaard" /&gt; Although Kaufmann did not share Kierkegaard's religious outlook and was critical of his Protestant theology, Kaufmann was nevertheless sympathetic and impressed with the depth of Kierkegaard's thinking:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...I know of no other great writer in the whole nineteenth century, perhaps even in the whole of world literature, to whom I respond with less happiness and with a more profound sense that I am on trial and found wanting, unless it were Søren Kierkegaard."&lt;ref name="Kierkegaard2"&gt;Kaufmann, W., 1961. ''Religion From Tolstoy To Camus''. Harper and Brothers, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kaufmann edited the [[anthology]] ''Existentialism from Dostoevsky to Sartre''. Kaufmann disliked [[Martin Heidegger]]'s thinking, along with his unclear writing.&lt;ref&gt;[[Denis Dutton]], "[http://www.denisdutton.com/heidegger.htm Kaufmann, Heidegger, and Nazism]" ''Philosophy and Literature'' 12 (1988): 325–36&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaufmann is renowned for his translations and exegesis of [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], whom he saw as gravely misunderstood by English speakers, as a major early [[existentialist]], and as an unwitting precursor, in some respects, to Anglo-American [[analytic philosophy]]. [[Llewellyn Jones]] wrote that Kaufmann's "fresh insights into ... Nietzsche ... can deepen the insights of every discriminating student of literature,"&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, Walter Arnold, ''From Shakespeare to Existentialism'' (Princeton University Press 1979), on back cover&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote that Kaufmann "has produced what may be the definitive study of Nietzsche's ... thought—an informed, scholarly, and lustrous work."&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Walter Arnold, ''Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist'' (Princeton University Press 1974), on back cover, {{ISBN|0-691-01983-5}}, accessed 2012-Jul-29&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaufmann wrote that superficially

&lt;blockquote&gt;...it also seems that as a philosopher [Nietzsche] represents a very sharp decline [from Kant and Hegel] ... because [Nietzsche] has no 'system.' Yet this argument is hardly cogent. ... Not only can one defend Nietzsche on this score ... but one must add that he had strong philosophic reasons for not having a system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Kaufman| first=Walter| title=Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist| publisher=Princeton University Press| year=1974| pages=79| isbn=0-691-01983-5| url=https://books.google.com/?id=Rw4u68fxYQMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Kaufmann,+%27%27Nietzsche:+Philosopher,+Psychologist,+Antichrist%27%27#PPA79,M1| accessdate=December 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Kaufmann also sympathized with Nietzsche's acerbic criticisms of Christianity. However, Kaufmann faulted much in Nietzsche, writing that "my disagreements with [Nietzsche] are legion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Kaufman| first=Walter| title=Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Buber:  Discovering the Mind, Volume 2| publisher=Princeton University Press| date=1980| pages=6| isbn=0-88738-394-7| url=https://books.google.com/?id=2qLGtL7XOjgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:Walter+inauthor:Kaufmann| accessdate=December 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding style, Kaufmann argued that Nietzsche's ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', for example, is in parts badly written, melodramatic, or verbose, yet concluded that the book "is not only a mine of ideas, but also a major work of literature and a personal triumph."&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, Walter (1976), "Editor's Preface" to ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', in ''The Portable Nietzsche'', New York: Penguin Books, pp. 120–124. {{ISBN|0-14-015062-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaufmann described his own ethic and his own philosophy of living in his books, including ''The Faith of a Heretic: What Can I Believe? How Should I Live? What Do I Hope?'' (1961) and ''Without Guilt and Justice: From Decidophobia to Autonomy'' (1973). He advocated living in accordance with what he proposed as the four cardinal virtues: ambition/humility, love, courage, and honesty.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, W., 1961. ''The Faith of a Heretic''. Doubleday &amp; Co., pages 317–338.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yazidis in Armenia''' ({{Lang-hy|Եզդիներ}} ''Yezdiner'', [[kurdish language|Kurmanji]]: Êzidî, ''Yezidi'', {{Lang-ru|Езиды}} ''Yezidi'') are a subgroup of [[Yazidis]] settled in [[Armenia]], where they form the largest ethnic minority. They are well integrated into the Armenian society, with freedom of religion and non-interference in their cultural traditions.

==History==

===Early 20th century===
Many [[Yazidis]] came to the [[Russian Empire]] (now the territory of [[Armenia]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]) during the 19th and early 20th centuries to escape religious persecution, as they were oppressed by the [[Ottoman Turks]] and the [[Sunni]] [[Kurds]] who tried to [[religious conversion|convert]] them to [[Islam]]. The Yazidis were massacred alongside the Armenians during the [[Armenian Genocide]], causing many to flee to [[Russia]]n-held parts of Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://209.200.101.189/publications/csq/csq-article.cfm?id=1360&amp;highlight=molokan |accessdate=February 19, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223113150/http://209.200.101.189/publications/csq/csq-article.cfm?id=1360&amp;highlight=molokan |archivedate=December 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first ever Yazidi school was opened in Armenia in 1920.&lt;ref name=osce&gt;[http://www.osce.org/documents/oy/2002/01/148_en.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060110080044/http://www.osce.org/documents/oy/2002/01/148_en.pdf |date=January 10, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nagorno-Karabakh War===
The Yezidi movement erupting in Armenia in 1988 appealed to the 3rd All-Armenian Yezidi Assembly convened on 30 September 1989 (the two previous Assemblies occurred at the dawn of the [[Armenian SSR]]'s history, in 1921 and 1923) to challenge the Government for the official recognition of their identity. As a result, the Yezidis were presented as a separate minority in the [[Soviet Census (1989)|USSR population census of 1989]]. According to this very census, the total count of Yezidis in Armenia was 52,700. Also need to note that in Karabakh war participated more than 500 yezidis by ethnicity, they have a detachment "Jangir Agha" headed by Aziz Tamoyan.&lt;ref name="archive2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/documents/oy/2002/01/148_en.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710071814/http://www.osce.org/documents/oy/2002/01/148_en.pdf |archivedate=2007-07-10 |format=PDF |title=The Ethnic Minorities of Armenia |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Yezidis volunteered during the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War|Karabakh conflict]] to fight on the Armenian side.&lt;ref name=osce/&gt;&lt;ref name="archive2002"/&gt;

==Present situation==

=== Demographics ===
According to the 2011 census, there are 35,272 Yazidis in Armenia.&lt;ref name=2011census /&gt; Ten years earlier, in the 2001 census, 40,620 Yazidis were registered in Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=De Jure Population (Urban, Rural) by Age and Ethnicity |publisher=[[National Statistical Service of the Republic of Armenia|National Statistical Service]] |url=http://docs.armstat.am/census/pdfs/51.pdf |format=PDF |year=2001 |accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media have estimated the number of Yazidis in Armenia as between 30,000 and 50,000. Most of them are descendants of refugees to Armenia following the persecution during Ottoman rule, including during the Armenian Genocide, when many Armenians found refuge in Yazidi villages.&lt;ref&gt;http://armenianweekly.com/2014/08/27/confronting-yezidid-genocide/&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Age structure ====
Ethnic Yazidis have a slightly younger population compared to ethnic Armenians. Almost 54 percent is under thirty years old, while 8 percent is aged sixty or more.

=== Political rights ===
Election Code of Armenia guarantees one seat in the [[National Assembly (Armenia)|National Assembly]] to Yazid minority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arlis.am/DocumentView.aspx?docid=105967|title=DocumentView|website=www.arlis.am|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Memorials and religious sites ===
In 2016 a memorial for fallen Yazids is installed in Yerevan downtown in the park at the crossing of Isahakyan and Nalbandyan streets.&lt;ref&gt;[[:hy:Եզդի ժողովրդի անմեղ զոհերի հուշարձան-կոթող (Երևան)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.genocide-museum.am/eng/21.04.2016-yezdi-memorial-eng.php|title=Genocide Museum {{!}} The Armenian Genocide Museum-institute|website=www.genocide-museum.am|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016, the world's largest Yazidi temple is under construction in the small village of [[Aknalich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/25/worlds-largest-yazidi-temple-under-construction-in-armenia|title=World's largest Yazidi temple under construction in Armenia|last1=Sherwood|first1=Harriet|date=25 July 2016|website=The Guardian|access-date=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Foreign evaluations of Yazid rights ===
US reports on the relations between Yazidis and the Armenian government have been mixed. According to a 2004 [[United States' Country Reports on Human Rights Practices|U.S. Department of State human rights report]], Yazidis are subjected to some harassment in Armenia. Attendance school rates among children in the Yezidi ethnic minority continued to be lower than average, partially due to economic reasons, a lack of Yezidi teachers and books, and the early removal of teenage girls from schools for marriage. In 2006 the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) supported the government's effort to publish textbooks for ethnic minorities, and in 2007 new Yezidi language textbooks appeared in some Yezidi schools around the country. The textbooks are Aziz. and Hasan Shex Mamude. Also through Armenian government support a first Yezidi newspaper was published named ''Ezdikhana'' (ex. name: ''Denge Ezdia'' or Yezidi Voice).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2004/41668.htm |title=Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Armenia |publisher=State.gov |date=2005-02-28 |accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2007 [[United States' Country Reports on Human Rights Practices|U.S. Department of State human rights report]], "As in previous years, Yezidi leaders did not complain that police and local authorities subjected their community to discrimination".&lt;ref name="2007USreports"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2007/100546.htm |title=Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Armenia |publisher=State.gov |date=2008-03-11 |accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
