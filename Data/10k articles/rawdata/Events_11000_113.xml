The '''10,000 Lakes Festival''' (abbreviated as '''10KLF''') was an annual four-day music festival in [[Detroit Lakes]], [[Minnesota]], at the Soo Pass Ranch that was held from 2003 until 2009 before going on indefinite hiatus due to financial losses and has not held since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.10klf.com/ 10KLF official website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030162954/http://www.10klf.com/ |date=2007-10-30 }}. Accessed July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Its name refers to Minnesota's nickname, "The Land of 10,000 Lakes". The lineups generally include [[jam band|jam]] and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] bands.

The festival was held on over 600 acres (243 ha) and had four stages: Main, Field, Barn, and Saloon. (The stages are listed by size, beginning with the largest.)  Campgrounds were able to be reserved and running water provided permanent restrooms and showers.

__NOTOC__
Year '''471 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Sabinus and Barbatus''' (or, less frequently, '''year 283 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 471 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

=== By place ===
==== Greece ====
* [[Athens|Athenian]] [[politician]] [[Themistocles]] loses the confidence of the Athenian people, partly due to his arrogance and partly due to his alleged readiness to take bribes. As a result, he is [[Ostracism|ostracized]] and retires to Argos.
* The colony of [[Policastro Bussentino|Pixunte]] (''Pixous'') is founded in [[Magna Graecia]].
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* [[Thucydides]], Greek historian (alleged date, however, [[460 BC]] is more probable) (d. c. [[395 BC]])

The content provided by AM² covers a range typical to anime conventions along with a few less traditional additions. Examples of this content include concerts, Masquerade (costume/talent show), various smaller [[cosplay]] events, an [[Anime Music Video|AMV]] contest, an exhibits area/dealer room, an "Artist Alley", [[Anime convention#Guests|GoH]] and fan panels, workshops, video screenings, [[tabletop game|tabletop gaming]], [[console gaming]], a [[karaoke]], an [[amusement arcade|arcade]], and late night dance. Some examples of less common events include a Summer Festival, [[maid café]], and the hosting of a preliminary round of the [[World Cosplay Summit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AM² Programming Schedule |url=http://am2con.org/programming/schedule |work=AM2 Convention |publisher=AM2 Convention |accessdate=26 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717033559/http://am2con.org/programming/schedule |archivedate=17 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In April 2010, [[Japanese Pop]] [[Japanese Idol|idol]] [[Erina Mano]] was announced as a guest at [[Anime Expo]] for the world release of her acting debut ''Kaidan Shin Mimibukuro Kaiki''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Anime Expo to Premiere Erina Mano's 1st Lead Film Role|publisher = [[Anime News Network]]|date=30 April 2010|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-04-30/anime-expo-to-premiere-erina-mano-1st-lead-film-role|accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When AX cancelled this appearance, an alternative event was created at the nearby [[Club Nokia#Nokia Theatre and Club Nokia|Club Nokia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|title=J-Pop's Number 1 Idol from Hello! Project to Appear at World Premiere Screening of Kai-Ki: Tales of Terror from Tokyo|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=25 May 2010|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2010-05-25/j-pop-number-1-idol-from-hello-project-to-appear-at-world-premiere-screening-of-kai-ki/tales-of-terror-from-tokyo|accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The premiere was organized by a former PR and marketing contractor who had been terminated from Anime Expo. Additionally, several other people joined the organization who had also left Anime Expo for various reasons.

In addition to Mano-chan's appearance, several other attractions were added. The expanded 1-day event was named Club 2 the Max in reference to the choice of venue. Some of the added attractions included a Maid Cafe, a charity concert &amp; music video shoot by [[X Japan]], and autograph session with Power Rangers stars. Club 2 the Max (aka MAX) was deemed largely successful by its sponsors, who decided to further fund it as an annual convention. MAX announced a name change in November 2010, choosing to be called AM².&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|title=Club 2 the Max Changes Name to AM2|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=25 May 2010|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2010-11-15/club-2-the-max-changes-name-to-am2|accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first AM² was held on July 1–3, 2011, the same weekend as Anime Expo 2011 in one of Anime Expo's former locations, the Anaheim Convention Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=AM2 Scores Another Amazing Day with Amazing Performances and Events for Avid Convention Goers |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2011-07-03/am2-scores-another-amazing-day-with-amazing-performances-and-evens-for-avid-convention-goers |newspaper=Anime News Network |date=3 July 2011 |accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurred after a hacker modified the convention website stating that convention was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Southern California's AM2 Goes On Despite Faked Notice |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-06-20/southern-california-am2-goes-on-despite-faked-notice |newspaper=Anime News Network |date=20 June 2011 |accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The convention returned to the venue in 2012 on June 15–17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Save the Date!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5091">'''Abstract management''' is the process of accepting and preparing [[Abstract (summary)|abstracts]] for presentation at an [[academic conference]]. The process consists of either invited or proffered submissions of the abstract or summary of work. The abstract typically states the hypothesis, tools used in research or investigation, data collected, and a summary or interpretation of the data.

The abstracts usually undergo [[peer review]] after which they are accepted or rejected by the conference chair or committee and then allocated to conference sessions. The abstracts may be presented as an oral talk or as an illustrated [[Poster session|poster]] during the event. Abstracts are often published before or after the event as [[Proceedings|conference proceedings]] or in [[academic journal]]s or online. In some cases submission of a full paper may be required before final acceptance is given. In some fields (e.g., computer science), most mainstream conferences and workshops ask for the submission of full papers (rather than just abstracts) and academic program committees peer review the full paper to a standard comparable to journal publication before accepting a paper for presentation at the conference and publishing it in an edited proceedings series.

The abstract management process is closely tied to the need to provide continuing education to professionals, especially  [[continuing medical education]]. Many annual meetings hosted by specialty societies provide educational credit hours so that attendees may keep current in the field and maintain their professional certifications.

== Software ==
Historically, abstract management was a time-consuming manual process requiring the handling of large amounts of paper and created a considerable administrative workload.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=670001 SSRN-The Academic Review Process: How Can We Make it More Efficient? by Ofer Azar&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; An increasing number of organizations now use web-based abstract management software to streamline and automate the process. The work is sometimes outsourced to dedicated conference departments at major publishers and professional conference organisers.

A conference management system is web-based software that supports the organization of conferences especially [[scientific conference]]s. It helps the program chair(s), the conference organizers, the authors and the [[peer-review|reviewers]] in their respective activities. 

A conference management system can be regarded as a domain-specific [[content management system]]. Similar systems are used today by editors of [[scientific journal]]s such as EDAS.

===Functionality===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2009}}
Software functionality is based around typical conference workflows. These vary in detail, but in broad terms they must include a submission phase (usually abstract submission but sometimes full papers), reviewing, decision making by the programme committee, building of the conference programme and publishing of the programme and the abstracts or papers (online, in print or on a CD-ROM or other digital medium).

Abstract submission involves the authors in preparing their abstracts and sending them to the conference organisers through an online form, and is a relatively straightforward process. The abstracts are either uploaded as documents (typically [[Microsoft Word]], [[PDF]] or [[LaTeX]]) or, where graphics and tables are not required, they may simply be entered into the form as plain text. The software will send out an email acknowledgement. Following the committee’s decisions on which abstracts are to be accepted for the conference the submission software may also be used to collect full papers and PowerPoint presentations.

Online [[Peer review|reviewing]] may be more complex as the process is frequently “blinded” or anonymised. Reviewers will have particular interests or specialisations which should be taken into account when assigning abstracts to them, and they may have conflicts of interest. Reviews must be independent, i.e.  reviewers should not be able to see other reviews before they have submitted their own. Abstract management software must provide for these options.

The programme committee will require extensive reporting and access to the abstracts and reviews. Software will usually support ranking of reviews and setting an acceptance threshold.
Some software products provide further functionality for the conference organisers. This often includes an email facility to report reviewers' comments and committee decisions to authors, programme building tools and online publishing.

Delegate registration is usually provided separately from abstract management.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4061">The '''Air Attack on the Fortress of Koepenick'''&lt;ref&gt;Spelling per sources&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Galland/&gt; was an incident in the [[Defence of the Reich|air war over Germany]] during [[World War II]]. It took place in October 1943 and was a large scale example of mistaken identity.&lt;ref name=Price/&gt;

==Background==
On 14 October 1943 the US [[Eighth Air Force|8th Air Force]] staged an attack on the [[Ball bearing|ball-bearing]] factories at [[Schweinfurt]] in central Germany, a key industry which was seen as a bottleneck in the German industrial manufacturing system. [[Second Raid on Schweinfurt|The raid]] had led to a vigorous response by German air defences and heavy losses amongst the bombers, but the city and the industry had been severely hit.&lt;ref name=Galland/&gt;&lt;ref name=Price/&gt;

==The attack on Fortress Koepenick==
On 20 October, just a week later, the 8th Air Force sent 119 bombers to attack the town of [[Düren]], near the border city of [[Aachen]]. The Americans reached their target and bombed it, after which they turned for home. At this point German observers reported a large formation of aircraft heading south. Price states this was based on the noise of aircraft, though they were not seen;&lt;ref name=Price/&gt; [[Adolf Galland]] attributes this to [[Chaff (countermeasure)|chaff]] dropped by the bombers drifting on the wind and registering on German radar. Whichever the cause, the effect was that, when it was reported to [[Hermann Göring]], the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' leader, the attack on Düren was seen as a [[Ruse of war|ruse]] and another devastating attack on central Germany was assumed to be underway. The ''Reichmarschall'' took personal command of the air defence and ordered all available fighter aircraft to intercept. As these fighters became airborne, and were duly heard from the ground or reported by radar, the impression of a huge force of attackers heading south became more pronounced. As they were on the same course as the force that attacked Schweinfurt less than a week before, Göring divined this was the target, vectoring his fighters to intercept there. As the phantom bombers passed over Schweinfurt without any ill effect to the city Göring reconsidered, deciding they were heading for [[Leuna]], the [[synthetic fuel]] refinery near [[Leipzig]] and another sensitive target. When again there was no bombing Göring suspected an attack on the [[Skoda Works|Skoda armament works]] at [[Plzeň|Pilsen]] and diverted the fighters there. By this time, the fighters were running out of fuel, and, as the defence system of the time dictated, started to land at the nearest available airfield. As they did so, the attacking force began to melt away&lt;ref name=Price/&gt;  Galland also states the sky was clear over Pilsen, and ground observers could see there were no bombers, only German fighters.&lt;ref name=Galland/&gt; With this the whole phantasm evaporated.

==Aftermath==
With the disappearance of the threat, Göring freely admitted the laugh was on him, that he had sent the ''Luftwaffe'' on a mammoth tour of their own air space, and sent an ironic telegram to all concerned congratulating them and himself on “the successful defence of the fortress of Koepenick”, a reference to [[Wilhelm Voigt#Captain of Köpenick|a notorious hoax]] of the early 20th century. Both Price and Galland point out the difficulties of differentiating between friend and foe in a confused aerial situation; both observed that neither side managed to resolve the problem during the air war.&lt;ref name=Galland&gt;[[Galland, Adolf]] : ''The First and the Last'' p 101(1954 reprinted ..)  {{ISBN|978 80 87888 92 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Price&gt;Price, Alfred : ''Battle Over the Reich'' pp95-6(1973) {{ISBN|0 7110 0481 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{Nihongo|'''All Japan Sports Prototype Championship'''|全日本スポーツプロトタイプ選手権|}}, abbreviated as JSPC, formed by the {{Interlanguage link multi|Japan Automobile Federation|ja|3=日本自動車連盟}}, was a domestic championship which took place in [[Japan]] for [[Group C]] and [[IMSA GTP]] [[prototype]] cars and also featured cars that were eligible for [[touring car racing]] in its earlier years. Class A and Class B for production cars which were defined by the [[FIA]] ([[Group A]] and [[Group B]]) and the lead category, Class C would be for cars that are similar to [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA's]] [[Camel Lights]] and the WEC's C2, whereas Class D was for C1/GTP cars.

The series began in 1983 as '''All Japan Endurance Championship''', an endurance championship with an intention to replace its domestic touring car championship and started out as a three-round event, including one which as it was part of the [[World Sportscar Championship|WEC]] round which meant drivers competing in the national series was counted into the world championship. In 1987, the championship would be broken up into two as production cars from the lower categories would be moved into the [[All Japan Touring Car Championship]] (now [[Super GT]]) formed two years earlier to become a dedicated championship and was renamed the '''All Japan Sports Prototype Car Endurance Championship'''.

The series was noted throughout its ten-year run for battles between the various [[Porsche 956]]/[[Porsche 962|962C]] and Japanese manufacturers presented by works teams of Toyota, Nissan and Mazda. Due to waning popularity and seeking to prevent the spiraling budgets and the disappearance of Gr. C and IMSA GTP, the JAF would dissolve the series at the end of 1992 and for the following year replace the series with the [[All Japan Grand Touring Car Championship]], using GT cars such as those in secondary classes as major international sportscar series worldwide favoured the grand tourers (similar to IMSA's lower GTS and GTU classes). This was not to be the end for Group C cars as they would be allowed to compete in the newly formed series for two more years before being banished altogether.

Major sportscar racing in Japan would return again in 2006 with the short-lived [[Japan Le Mans Challenge]].

The '''American Revolutionary War''' (1775{{ndash}}1783), also known as the '''American War of Independence''',&lt;ref&gt;Modern British writers generally favor "American War of Independence", rather than "American Rebellion" or "War of American Independence". {{cite web|url= https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-history-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-history-programmes-of-study|title= National Curriculum England|date= |accessdate= April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an 18th-century war between Great Britain and its [[Thirteen Colonies]] (allied with France) which declared independence as the United States of America.{{refn|This article primarily refers to the inhabitants of the thirteen colonies who supported the American Revolution as "Americans", with occasional references to "Patriots" or "Revolutionaries". Colonists who supported the British and opposed the Revolution are referred to as "Loyalists" or "Tories". The geographical area of the thirteen colonies is often referred to simply as "America".|group=N}}

After 1765, growing [[American Revolution#Origin|philosophical and political differences]] strained the relationship between Great Britain and its colonies. [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] protests against [[No taxation without representation|taxation without representation]] followed the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] and escalated into boycotts, which culminated in 1773 with the [[Sons of Liberty]] [[Boston Tea Party|destroying a shipment of tea]] in Boston Harbor. Britain responded by closing Boston Harbor and passing a series of [[Intolerable Acts|punitive measures]] against [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. Massachusetts colonists responded with the [[Suffolk Resolves]], and they established a shadow government which wrested control of the countryside from the Crown. Twelve colonies formed a [[Continental Congress]] to coordinate their resistance, establishing committees and conventions that effectively seized power.&lt;ref&gt;The colony of Georgia joined later.&lt;/ref&gt;

British attempts to disarm the Massachusetts militia in [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]] [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|led to open combat]] on April 19, 1775. Militia forces then [[Siege of Boston|besieged Boston]], forcing a British evacuation in March 1776, and Congress appointed [[George Washington]] to command the [[Continental Army]]. Concurrently, the Americans [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|failed decisively]] in an attempt to [[Invasion of Quebec (1775)|invade Quebec]] and raise insurrection against the British. On July 2, 1776, the Continental Congress voted for independence, issuing its [[United States Declaration of Independence|declaration]] on July&amp;nbsp;4. [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|Sir William Howe]] launched a [[New York and New Jersey campaign|British counter-offensive]], capturing New York City and leaving American morale at a low ebb. However, victories at [[Battle of Trenton|Trenton]] and [[Battle of Princeton|Princeton]] restored American confidence. In 1777, the British launched an [[Saratoga Campaign|invasion from Quebec]] under [[John Burgoyne]], intending to isolate the [[New England Colonies]]. Instead of assisting this effort, Howe took his army on a separate [[Philadelphia campaign|campaign]] against Philadelphia, and Burgoyne was decisively defeated at [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]] in October 1777.

Burgoyne's defeat had drastic consequences. France formally [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|allied with the Americans]] and entered the war in 1778, and Spain joined the war the following year as an [[Pacte de Famille|ally of France]] but not as an ally of the United States. In 1780, the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] [[Second Anglo-Mysore War|attacked the British in India]], and tensions between Great Britain and the Netherlands erupted into [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War|open war]]. In North America, the British mounted a "[[Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War|Southern strategy]]" led by [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Cornwallis]] which hinged upon a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] uprising, but too few came forward. Cornwallis suffered reversals at [[Battle of Kings Mountain|King's Mountain]] and [[Battle of Cowpens|Cowpens]]. He retreated to Yorktown, Virginia, intending an evacuation, but a decisive [[Battle of the Chesapeake|French naval victory]] deprived him of an escape. A Franco-American army led by the [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|Comte de Rochambeau]] and Washington then [[Siege of Yorktown|besieged Cornwallis' army]] and, with no sign of relief, he surrendered in October 1781.

[[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] in Britain had long opposed the pro-war Tories in Parliament, and the surrender gave them the upper hand. In early 1782, Parliament voted to end all offensive operations in North America, but the war continued in Europe and India. Britain remained [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|under siege in Gibraltar]] but scored a [[Battle of the Saintes|major victory]] over the French navy. On September 3, 1783, the belligerent parties signed the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in which Great Britain agreed to recognize the sovereignty of the United States and formally end the war. French involvement had proven decisive,&lt;ref name="RichardBrooks"&gt;Brooks, Richard (editor). ''Atlas of World Military History''. HarperCollins, 2000, p. 101 "Washington's success in keeping the army together deprived the British of victory, but French intervention won the war."&lt;/ref&gt; but France made few gains and incurred crippling debts. Spain made some territorial gains but failed in its primary aim of recovering Gibraltar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Chartrand|first=René|title=Gibraltar 1779–83: The Great Siege|year=2006|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-84176-977-6}}, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch were defeated on all counts and were compelled to cede territory to Great Britain. In India, the war against Mysore and its allies [[Treaty of Mangalore|concluded in 1784]] without any territorial changes.

=== Taxation disputes ===
Parliament passed the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] in 1765. Colonists condemned the tax because their [[Rights of Englishmen|rights as Englishmen]] protected them from being taxed by a Parliament in which they had [[no taxation without representation|no elected representatives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gladney, Henry M. |title=No Taxation without Representation: 1768 Petition, Memorial, and Remonstrance |year=2014 |url=http://www.hgladney.com/PMR/No_Taxation_without_Representation_(book_description).pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513135503/http://www.hgladney.com/PMR/No_Taxation_without_Representation_%28book_description%29.pdf |archive-date=May 13, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament argued that the colonies were "[[Virtual representation|represented virtually]]", an idea that was criticized throughout the Empire.&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YKYOAAAAQAAJ|title=Liberty and Property: Political Ideology in Eighteenth-century Britain – H.T.

T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament did repeal the act in 1766; however, it also [[Declaratory Act|affirmed its right]] to pass laws that were binding on the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Howard McIlwain|title=The American Revolution: A Constitutional Interpretation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPCOs3MBUUEC&amp;pg=PA51|year=1938|page=51|isbn=978-1-58477-568-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1767, Parliament began passing [[Townshend Acts|legislation]] to raise revenue for the salaries of civil officials, ensuring their loyalty while inadvertently increasing resentment among the colonists, and opposition soon became widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Boyer|title=The Enduring Vision: A History of the American People|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kDAaCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA142|year=2014|publisher=Cengage Learning|page=142|display-authors=etal|isbn=978-1-285-19339-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knollenberg, Growth, 48; Thomas, Duties Crisis, 76&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Boston Tea Party Currier colored.jpg|thumb|alt=Two ships in a harbor, one in the distance. On board, men stripped to the waist and wearing feathers in their hair throw crates of tea overboard. A large crowd, mostly men, stands on the dock, waving hats and cheering. A few people wave their hats from windows in a nearby building.|This iconic 1846 lithograph by [[Nathaniel Currier]] was entitled "The Destruction of Tea at Boston Harbor"; the phrase "[[Boston Tea Party]]" had not yet become standard. Contrary to Currier's depiction, few of the men dumping the tea were actually disguised as Indians.&lt;ref&gt;Young, ''Shoemaker'', 183–85.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Enforcing the acts proved difficult. The seizure of the sloop ''[[HMS Liberty (1768)|Liberty]]'' in 1768 on suspicions of smuggling triggered a riot. In response, British troops occupied Boston, and Parliament threatened to [[Treason Act 1543|extradite colonists]] to face trial in England.&lt;ref&gt;Knollenberg, Growth, 69&lt;/ref&gt; Tensions rose after the murder of [[Christopher Seider]] by a customs official in 1770 and escalated into outrage after British troops fired on civilians in the [[Boston Massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What was the Boston Massacre?|website=Boston Massacre Society|url=http://www.bostonmassacre.net/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1772, colonists in [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]] boarded and burned a [[Gaspee Affair|customs schooner]]. Parliament then repealed all taxes except the one on tea, passing the [[Tea Act]] in 1773, attempting to force colonists to buy [[East India Company]] tea on which the Townshend duties were paid, thus implicitly agreeing to Parliamentary supremacy. The landing of the tea was resisted in all colonies, but the [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|governor of Massachusetts]] permitted British tea ships to remain in [[Boston Harbor]]. So, the [[Sons of Liberty]] destroyed the tea chests, an incident that later became known as the "[[Boston Tea Party]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boston Tea Party|website=History.com.|accessdate=|url=http://www.history.com/topics/american-revolution/boston-tea-party}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parliament then passed punitive legislation. It [[Boston Port Act|closed Boston Harbor]] until the tea was paid for and [[Massachusetts Government Act|revoked]] the [[Massachusetts Charter]], taking upon themselves the right to directly appoint the [[Massachusetts Governor's Council]]. Additionally, the royal governor was granted powers to undermine [[New England town|local democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/mass_gov_act.asp|title=Avalon Project – Great Britain : Parliament – The Massachusetts Government Act; May 20, 1774|website=avalon.law.yale.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian R. Christie and Benjamin W. Labaree, Empire or Independence, 1760–1776 (New York: Norton, 1976) p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Administration of Justice Act 1774|Further measures]] allowed the extradition of officials for trial elsewhere in the Empire, if the governor felt that a fair trial could not be secured locally. The act's vague reimbursement policy for travel expenses left few with the ability to testify, and colonists argued that it would allow officials to harass them with impunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book   |title=In the Common Cause: American Response to the Coercive Acts of 1774 |last=Ammerman |first=David |publisher=Norton |year=1974 |isbn= |location=New York }}, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quartering Act|Further laws]] allowed the governor to [[billet]] troops in private property without permission.&lt;ref&gt;Ammerman points out that the act only permitted soldiers to be quartered in unoccupied buildings—although they were still private property. (Ammerman, In the Common Cause, 10)&lt;/ref&gt; The colonists referred to the measures as the "[[Intolerable Acts]]", and they argued that both their constitutional rights and their [[natural rights]] were being violated, viewing the acts as a threat to all of America.&lt;ref&gt;Ammerman, ''In the Common Cause,'' 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The acts were widely opposed, driving neutral parties into support of the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]] and curtailing [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gary B.

=== Colonial response ===

The colonists responded by establishing the [[Massachusetts Provincial Congress]], effectively removing Crown control of the colony outside Boston. Meanwhile, representatives from twelve colonies{{refn|Georgia did not attend}}&lt;ref&gt;Ferling, John. (2003). A Leap in the Dark. Oxford University Press. p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; convened the [[First Continental Congress]] to respond to the crisis. The Congress narrowly rejected a proposal to create an [[Galloway's Plan of Union|American parliament]] to act in concert with the British Parliament; instead, they passed [[Continental Association|a compact]] declaring a [[Economic sanctions|trade boycott]] against Britain.&lt;ref name=Kindig&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kindig |first1=Thomas E. |title=Galloway's Plan for the Union of Great Britain and the Colonies |url=http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/related/planforunion.htm |website=Declaration of Independence |publisher=[[Independence Hall Association]], publishing electronically as ushistory.org. |accessdate=March 14, 2015 |location=[[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], USA |date=1995 |quote=The plan was considered very attractive to most of the members, as it proposed a popularly elected Grand Council which would represent the interests of the colonies as a whole, and would be a continental equivalent to the English Parliament.

=== British northern strategy fails (1777–1778) ===
{{Main|Saratoga campaign|Philadelphia campaign}}

In December 1776, [[John Burgoyne]] returned to London to set strategy with [[George Germain, 1st Viscount Sackville|Lord George Germain]]. Burgoyne's plan was to establish control of the [[Lake Champlain|Champlain]]-[[Lake George (New York)|George]]-[[Hudson River|Hudson]] route from New York to Quebec, isolating New England.  Efforts could then be concentrated on the southern colonies, where it was believed Loyalist support was in abundance.&lt;ref name="K84"&gt;[[#Ketchum|Ketchum (1997)]], p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Surrender of General Burgoyne.jpg|thumb|left|"[[Battles of Saratoga|The Surrender at Saratoga]]" shows General [[Daniel Morgan]] in front of a French [[Canon de 24 de Vallière|de Vallière]] 4-pounder.]]

Burgoyne's plan was to lead an army along [[Lake Champlain]], while a strategic diversion advanced along the [[Mohawk River]], and both would rendezvous at [[Albany, New York|Albany]].&lt;ref&gt;Ketchum (1997), p.&amp;nbsp;84.&lt;/ref&gt; Burgoyne set out on June 14, 1777, [[Siege of Fort Ticonderoga (1777)|quickly capturing Ticonderoga]] on July 5.   Leaving 1,300 men behind as a garrison, Burgoyne continued the advance.  Progress was slow; the Americans blocked roads, destroyed bridges, dammed streams and [[scorched earth|denuded the area]] of food.&lt;ref name="K249"&gt;[[#Ketchum|Ketchum (1997)]], pp. 244–49&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, [[Barry St. Ledger]]'s diversionary column [[Siege of Fort Stanwix|laid siege to Fort Stanwix]]. St. Ledger withdrew to Quebec on August 22 after his [[Battle of Oriskany|Indian support abandoned him]]. On August 16, a Hessian foraging expedition was [[Battle of Bennington|soundly defeated at Bennington]], and more than 700 troops were captured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Battle of Bennington: Soldiers and Civilians|first=Michael P.|last=Gabriel|publisher=The History Press|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the vast majority of Burgoyne's Indian support abandoned him and Howe informed Burgoyne he would launch his campaign on Philadelphia as planned, and would be unable to render aid.&lt;ref name="K283"&gt;[[#Ketchum|Ketchum (1997)]], p. 283&lt;/ref&gt;

Burgoyne decided to continue the advance.  On September 19, he attempted to flank the American position, and [[Battles of Saratoga#First Saratoga: Battle of Freeman's Farm (September 19)|clashed at Freeman's Farm]]. The British won, but at the cost of 600 casualties. Burgoyne then [[Defensive fighting position|dug in]], but suffered a constant haemorrhage of deserters, and critical supplies were running low.&lt;ref&gt;Ketchum (1997), pp.&amp;nbsp;337–78.&lt;/ref&gt;  On October 7, a British [[reconnaissance in force]] against the American lines was [[Battles of Saratoga#Second Saratoga: Battle of Bemis Heights (October 7)|repulsed with heavy losses]]. Burgoyne then withdrew with the Americans in pursuit, and by October 13, he was surrounded. With no hope of relief and supplies exhausted, Burgoyne surrendered on October 17, and 6,222 soldiers became [[Convention Army|prisoners of the Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;Ketchum (1997), pp.&amp;nbsp;403–25.&lt;/ref&gt; The decisive success spurred France to [[France in the American Revolutionary War|enter the war]] as an [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|ally of the United States]], securing the final elements needed for victory over Britain, that of foreign assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Morgan, The Birth of the Republic: 1763–1789 (1956) pp. 82–83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Higginbotham (1983), pp. 188–98&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, he took his army on a time-consuming route through the [[Chesapeake Bay]], leaving him completely unable to assist Burgoyne.

In 1780, Clinton launched an attempt to retake New Jersey. On June 7, 6,000 men invaded under Hessian general [[Wilhelm von Knyphausen]], but they met [[Battle of Connecticut Farms|stiff resistance]] from the local militia. The British held the field, but Knyphausen feared a general engagement with Washington's main army and withdrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Forgotten Victory: The Battle for New Jersey&amp;nbsp;– 1780|first=Thomas|last=Fleming|publisher=Reader's Digest Press|location=New York|year=1973|isbn=978-0-88349-003-7|ref=Fleminng}}, pp. 174–75&lt;/ref&gt; Knyphausen and Clinton decided upon a second attempt two weeks later which was [[Battle of Springfield (1780)|soundly defeated at Springfield]], effectively ending British ambitions in New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, pp. 232, 302&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, American general [[Benedict Arnold]] had [[To the Inhabitants of America|defected]] to the British, and he conspired to betray the key American fortress of [[West Point]] by surrendering it to the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.si.umich.edu/spies/letter-1780july15-code.html|title=July 15, 1780 –  Benedict Arnold to John André (Code)|journal=Spy Letters of the American Revolution – from the Collection of the Clements Collection|accessdate=2017-05-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408094150/http://www2.si.umich.edu/spies/letter-1780july15-code.html|archivedate=April 8, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plot was foiled when British spy master [[John André]] was captured, so Arnold fled to British lines in New York.

The war to the west of the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]] was largely confined to skirmishing and raids. An expedition of militia was halted due to adverse weather in February 1778 which had set out to destroy British military supplies in settlements along the [[Cuyahoga River]].&lt;ref&gt;Downes, Council Fires, 211; Nester, Frontier War, 194; Nelson, Man of Distinction, 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the year, a [[Illinois campaign|second campaign]] was undertaken to seize the [[Illinois Country]] from the British.

On May 25, 1780, the British launched [[Bird's invasion of Kentucky|an expedition into Kentucky]] as part of a wider operation to clear resistance from Quebec to the [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf coast]].

=== War in the South (1778–1781) ===
{{Main|Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War}}
[[File:Sullivans-island-1050x777.jpg|thumb|British troops besiege Charleston in 1780, by [[Alonzo Chappel]]]]

The British turned their attention to conquering the South in 1778, after Loyalists in London assured them of a strong Loyalist base there. A southern campaign also had the advantage of keeping the Royal Navy closer to the Caribbean, where it would be needed to defend lucrative colonies against the Franco-Spanish fleets.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Lumpkin, ''From Savannah to Yorktown: The American Revolution in the South'' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;  On December 29, 1778, an expeditionary corps from New York [[Capture of Savannah|captured Savannah]], and British troops then moved inland to recruit Loyalist support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morrill|first=Dan|title=Southern Campaigns of the American Revolution|publisher=Nautical &amp; Aviation Publishing|year=1993|ref=Morrill}}, pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; There was a promising initial turnout in early 1779, but then a large Loyalist militia was defeated at [[Battle of Kettle Creek|Kettle Creek]] on February 14 and they had to recognize their dependence upon the British. The British, however, defeated Patriot militia at [[Battle of Brier Creek|Brier Creek]] on March 3,&lt;ref&gt;Morrill (1993), pp. 48–50&lt;/ref&gt; and then launched an [[Battle of Stono Ferry|abortive assault]] on [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. The operation became notorious for its high degree of looting by British troops, enraging both Loyalists and Patriot colonists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Southern Strategy: Britain's Conquest of South Carolina and Georgia, 1775–1780|first=David K|last=Wilson|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|year=2005|isbn=978-1-57003-573-9|location=Columbia, SC|oclc=232001108}}, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

In October, a combined Franco-American effort failed to [[Siege of Savannah|recapture Savannah]].  In May 1780, Henry Clinton  [[Siege of Charleston|captured Charleston]], taking over 5,000 prisoners and effectively destroying the Continental Army in the south.  Organized American resistance in the region collapsed when [[Banastre Tarleton]] defeated the withdrawing Americans at [[Battle of Waxhaws|Waxhaws]] on May 29.&lt;ref&gt;John W. Gordon and John Keegan, ''South Carolina and the American Revolution: A Battlefield History'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cowpens.jpg|thumb|right|American and British cavalry clash at the Battle of Cowpens; from an 1845 painting by William Ranney]]

Clinton returned to New York, leaving Charles Cornwallis in command in Charleston to oversee the southern war effort.  Far fewer Loyalists than expected joined him. In the interim, the war was carried on by Patriot militias who effectively suppressed Loyalists by winning victories in [[Battle of Mobley's Meeting House|Fairfield County]], [[Battle of Ramsour's Mill|Lincolnton]], [[Huck's Defeat]],  [[Battle of Colson's Mill|Stanly County]], and [[Battle of Hanging Rock|Lancaster County]].

Congress appointed [[Horatio Gates]], victor at Saratoga, to lead the American effort in the south. He suffered a [[Battle of Camden|major defeat at Camden]] on August 16, 1780, setting the stage for Cornwallis to invade North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh F. Rankin, ''North Carolina in the American Revolution'' (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; The British attempted to subjugate the countryside, and Patriot militia continued to fight against them, so Cornwallis dispatched troops to raise Loyalist forces to cover his left flank as he moved north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Road To Guilford Court House: The American Revolution in the Carolinas |last=Buchanan |first=John |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-471-32716-5|location=New York }}, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; This wing of Cornwallis' army was [[Battle of Kings Mountain|virtually destroyed]] on October 7, irreversibly breaking Loyalist support in the Carolinas. Cornwallis subsequently aborted his advance and retreated back into South Carolina.&lt;ref name="Buchanan, p. 241"&gt;Buchanan, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; In the interim, Washington replaced Gates with his trusted subordinate, [[Nathanael Greene]].&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;

Greene was unable to confront the British directly, so he dispatched a force under [[Daniel Morgan]] to recruit additional troops. Morgan then defeated the [[British Legion (American Revolution)|cream of the British army]] under Tarleton on January 17, 1781 at [[Battle of Cowpens|Cowpens]]. Cornwallis was criticized for having detached a substantial part of his army without adequate support,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Clinton, H.; The American Rebellion; 1783&lt;/ref&gt; but he advanced into North Carolina despite the setbacks, gambling that he would receive substantial Loyalist support there.  Greene evaded combat with Cornwallis, instead wearing his army down through a protracted [[war of attrition]].&lt;ref name="Buchanan, p. 326"&gt;Buchanan, p. 326&lt;/ref&gt;

By March, Greene's army had increased in size enough that he felt confident in facing Cornwallis. The two armies engaged at [[Battle of Guilford Court House|Guilford Courthouse]] on March 15; Greene was beaten, but Cornwallis' army suffered irreplaceable casualties.&lt;ref name=MtVernon&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mountvernon.org/digital-encyclopedia/article/battle-of-guilford-courthouse/ | title = Battle of Guilford Courthouse | first = Nick | last = McGrath | website = George Washington’s Mount Vernon: Digital Encyclopedia | publisher = Mount Vernon Ladies’ Association | date = | access-date = January 26, 2017 | quote = In three hours, Cornwallis’s army took possession of the field, but it was a Pyrrhic victory....

Greene then proceeded to reclaim the South. The American troops suffered a reversal at [[Battle of Hobkirk's Hill|Hobkirk's Hill]] on April 25;&lt;ref&gt;Greene, Francis Vinton D. ''General Greene'', Appleton and Company 1893, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; nonetheless, they continued to dislodge strategic British posts in the area, capturing [[Siege of Fort Watson|Fort Watson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=This Destructive War|first=John|last=Pancake|publisher=University of Alabama Press|year=1985|isbn=978-0-8173-0191-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Siege of Fort Motte|Fort Motte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Founding Fighters: The Battlefield Leaders who Made American Independence|first=Alan|last=C.

=== British defeat in America (1781) ===
{{Main|Yorktown campaign}}
[[File:BattleOfVirginiaCapes.jpg|thumb|The French (left) and British (right) lines exchange fire at the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]]]]

Cornwallis had discovered that the majority of American supplies in the Carolinas were passing through Virginia, and he had written to both Lord Germain and Clinton detailing his intentions to invade. Cornwallis believed that a successful campaign there would cut supplies to Greene's army and precipitate a collapse of American resistance in the South. Clinton strongly opposed the plan, favoring a campaign farther north in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] region.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Cornwallis; An Answer to Sir Henry Clinton's Narrative.

Note: This lack of notification was one of Clinton's main arguments in his own defense in the controversy which followed the surrender at Yorktown.&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton, however, had failed to construct a coherent strategy for British operations in 1781,&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grainger|first=John|title=The Battle of Yorktown, 1781: a Reassessment|publisher=Boydell Press|year=2005|location=Woodbridge, NJ|isbn=978-1-84383-137-2|oclc=232006312}}, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; owing to his difficult relationship with his naval counterpart [[Marriot Arbuthnot]].&lt;ref name="Billias 1969"&gt;{{cite book|last=Billias|first=George|title=George Washington's Generals and Opponents: their Exploits and Leadership|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=1969|location=New York|isbn=978-0-306-80560-8|oclc=229206429}}, pp. 267–75&lt;/ref&gt;

His instructions were vague to Cornwallis during this time, rarely forming explicit orders. However, Clinton did instruct Cornwallis to establish a fortified naval base and to transfer troops to the north to defend New York.&lt;ref&gt;Grainger, pp. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt; Cornwallis dug in at [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]] and awaited the Royal Navy.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Cecere, ''Great Things are Expected from the Virginians: Virginia in the American Revolution'' (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North Ministry collapses ===

On 25 November 1781, news arrived in London of the surrender at Yorktown. The Whig opposition gained traction in Parliament, and a motion was proposed on December 12 to end the war which was defeated by only one vote. On 27 February 1782, the House voted against further war in America by 19 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lewis Namier and John Brooke |title=The House of Commons 1754–1790|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Taw7DVGrbRcC&amp;pg=RA1-PA246|year=1985|page=246|isbn=9780436304200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lord George Germain|Lord Germain]] was dismissed and a vote of no confidence was passed against North.   The [[Rockingham Whigs]] came to power and opened negotiations for peace.

In March 1781, French Admiral [[Bailli de Suffren]] was dispatched to India to assist colonial efforts.

There was no clear victor, though Hughes' fleet came off worse,&lt;ref&gt;Castex (p. 315) calls this a French victory, on account of more severe damage to Hughes' fleet. Mahan (p. 566) does not explicitly designate a victor.&lt;/ref&gt; and he withdrew to the British-held port of Trincomalee. Hyder Ali wished for the French to capture Negapatam to establish naval dominance over the British, and this task fell to Suffren.

Following the surrender at Yorktown, the Whig party came to power in Britain and began opening negotiations for a cessation of hostilities. While peace negotiations were being undertaken, British troops in America were restricted from launching further offensives.&lt;ref name="Greene, p. 325" /&gt; Prime Minister the Earl of Shelburne was reluctant to accept American independence as a prerequisite for peace, as the British were aware that the French economy was nearly bankrupt, and reinforcements sent to the West Indies could potentially reverse the situation there. He preferred that the colonies accept Dominion status within the Empire,  though a similar offer had been rejected by the Americans in 1778.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=ALDbuNPu_IQC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=Carlisle+Commission#PPA121,M1| title=British friends of the American Revolution | author=Jerome R. Reich| page=121| publisher=M.E. Sharpe| year=1997| isbn=978-0-7656-3143-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations soon began in Paris.

The Americans initially demanded that Quebec be ceded to them as [[Prize of war|spoils of war]], a proposal that was dropped when Shelburne accepted American demands for recognition of independence. On April 19, 1782, the Dutch formally recognized the United States as a sovereign power, enhancing American leverage at the negotiations. Spain initially impeded the negotiations, refusing to enter into peace talks until Gibraltar had been captured. The Comte de Vergennes proposed that American territory be confined to the east of the Appalachians; Britain would have sovereignty over the [[Northwest Territory|area north of the Ohio River]], below which an [[Indian barrier state]] would be established under Spanish control. The United States fiercely opposed the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;Dwight L. Smith, "A North American Neutral Indian Zone: Persistence of a British Idea."

The Americans skirted their allies, recognizing that more favorable terms would be found in London. They negotiated directly with Shelburne, who hoped to make Britain a valuable trading partner of America at the expense of France.  To this end, Shelburne offered to cede all the land east of the [[Mississippi River]], north of Florida, and south of Quebec,&lt;ref&gt;William E. Lass (1980).

''A Diplomatic History of the American Revolution''. pp. 144–51.&lt;/ref&gt; Shelburne was hoping to facilitate the growth of the American population, creating lucrative markets that Britain could exploit at no administrative cost to London.  As Vergennes commented, "the English buy peace rather than make it".&lt;ref name="Thomas Paterson 2009 p 20"&gt;Quote from Thomas Paterson, J. Garry Clifford and Shane J. Maddock, American foreign relations: A history, to 1920 (2009) vol 1 p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the negotiations, Britain never consulted her American Indian allies, forcing them to reluctantly accept the treaty. However, the subsequent tension erupted into conflicts between the Indians and the young United States, the largest being the [[Northwest Indian War]].&lt;ref&gt;Benn (1993), p.&amp;nbsp;17.&lt;/ref&gt; Britain continued trying to create an Indian buffer state in the American Midwest as late as 1814 during the [[War of 1812]].&lt;ref&gt;Dwight L.

== Aftermath ==

=== Casualties and losses ===

==== Americans and allies ====
The total loss of life throughout the conflict is largely unknown. As was typical in wars of the era, diseases such as [[smallpox]] claimed more lives than battle. Between 1775 and 1782, a [[1775–82 North American smallpox epidemic|smallpox epidemic]] broke out throughout North America, killing 40 people in Boston alone. Historian [[Joseph Ellis]] suggests that Washington's decision to have his troops [[inoculation|inoculated]] against the disease was one of his most important decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis (2004), p.&amp;nbsp;87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 25,000 and 70,000 American Patriots died during active military service.&lt;ref name="Howard H. Peckham 1974" /&gt; Of these, approximately 6,800 were killed in battle, while at least 17,000 died from disease. The majority of the latter died while [[prisoners of war]] of the British, mostly in the [[Prisoners in the American Revolutionary War|prison ships]] in New York Harbor.&lt;ref name="Burrows" /&gt; If the upper limit of 70,000 is accepted as the total net loss for the Patriots, it would make the conflict proportionally deadlier than the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name=medical /&gt; Uncertainty arises due to the difficulties in accurately calculating the number of those who succumbed to disease, as it is estimated at least 10,000 died in 1776 alone.&lt;ref name=medical /&gt; The number of Patriots seriously wounded or disabled by the war has been estimated from 8,500 to 25,000.&lt;ref&gt;American dead and wounded: Shy, pp.&amp;nbsp;249–50. The lower figure for number of wounded comes from Chambers, p.&amp;nbsp;849.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French suffered approximately 7,000 total dead throughout the conflict; of those, 2,112 were killed in combat in the American theaters of war.&lt;ref name="frenchcasualtiesrevolution" /&gt;

The Dutch suffered around 500 total killed, owing to the minor scale of their conflict with Britain.&lt;ref name="Necrometrics" /&gt;

==== British and allies ====
British returns in 1783 listed 43,633 rank and file deaths across the [[British Armed Forces]].&lt;ref name="Annual Register, 1783" /&gt; A table from 1781 puts total British Army deaths at 9,372 soldiers killed in battle across the Americas; 6,046 in North America (1775–1779), and 3,326 in the West Indies (1778–1780).&lt;ref name="books.google.com" /&gt; In 1784, a British lieutenant compiled a detailed list of 205 British officers killed in action during the war, encompassing Europe, the Caribbean and the East Indies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/pennsylvaniamaga27hist#page/176/mode/1up ''The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography''], Volume 27 (1903), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; Extrapolations based upon this list puts British Army losses in the area of at least 4,000 killed or died of wounds.&lt;ref name=medical /&gt; Approximately 7,774 [[Germans in the American Revolution#Allies of Great Britain|Germans]] died in British service in addition to 4,888 deserters; of the former, it is estimated 1,800 were killed in combat.&lt;ref name=medical /&gt;

Around 171,000 [[sailors]] served in the [[Royal Navy]] during the war; approximately a quarter of whom had been [[impressment|pressed]] into service. Around 1,240 were killed in battle, while an estimated 18,500 died from disease (1776–1780).&lt;ref name="Parliamentary Register" /&gt; The greatest killer at sea was [[scurvy]], a disease caused by [[vitamin C]] deficiency.&lt;ref name=GARD2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Scurvy|url=https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/10406/scurvy|website=GARD|accessdate=26 September 2016|date=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1795 that scurvy was eradicated from the Royal Navy after the Admiralty declared [[lemon juice]] and [[sugar]] were to be issued among the standard daily rations of sailors.&lt;ref name="Vale, Brian 2008"&gt;Vale, Brian (2008).

Nettels, The Emergence of a National Economy, 1775–1815 (1962) pp. 23–44&lt;/ref&gt; As the circulation of hard currency declined, the Americans had to rely on loans from American merchants and bankers, France, Spain and the Netherlands, saddling the young nation with crippling debts. Congress attempted to remedy this by printing vast amounts of paper money and bills of credit to raise revenue. The effect was disastrous; inflation skyrocketed, and the paper money became virtually worthless. The inflation spawned a popular phrase that anything of little value was "not worth a [[continental dollar|continental]]".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://myloc.gov/Exhibitions/creatingtheus/Constitution/RoadtotheConstitution/ExhibitObjects/NotWorthAContinental.aspx Not worth a continental] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709095712/http://myloc.gov/Exhibitions/creatingtheus/Constitution/RoadtotheConstitution/ExhibitObjects/NotWorthAContinental.aspx |date=July 9, 2012 }}", "Creating the United States", Library of Congress.

Parliament suffered chronic difficulties in obtaining sufficient manpower,&lt;ref&gt;War Office Papers, Manuscripts in the Public Record Office, 1:992–1008, passim&lt;/ref&gt; and found it impossible to fill the quotas they had set.&lt;ref&gt;War Officer Papers, 4:275, Jenkinson to Clinton, 5 Dec. 1780&lt;/ref&gt; The Army was a deeply unpopular profession, one contentious issue being pay. A [[Private (rank)|Private]] infantryman was paid a wage of just 8[[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|d.]] per day,&lt;ref&gt;9th Report on Public Accounts (1783) in 39 House of Commons Journal, H.M. Stationery Office, 1803, pp. 325–44&lt;/ref&gt; the same pay as for a [[New Model Army]] infantryman, 130 years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Plant, David, "The New Model Army", BCW Project, http://bcw-project.org/military/new-model-army, Retrieved 9 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of pay in the army was insufficient to meet the rising costs of living, turning off potential recruits,&lt;ref&gt;Fortescue, Volume III, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; as service was nominally for life.&lt;ref&gt;Owen, Captain Wheeler (1914), "The War Office Past and Present", Methuen &amp; Co. London, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

To entice people to enrol, Parliament offered a [[bounty (reward)|bounty]] of [[guinea (coin)|£]]1.10[[shillings|s]] for every recruit.&lt;ref&gt;War Office Papers, 3:5, Harvey to Elliot, 10 March 1775&lt;/ref&gt; As the war dragged on, Parliament became desperate for manpower; criminals were offered military service to escape legal penalties, and deserters were pardoned if they re-joined their units.&lt;ref&gt;Clode, Volume II, pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; After the defeat at Saratoga, Parliament doubled the bounty to £3,&lt;ref&gt;Statutes at Large, Ruffhead's Edition (London, 1763–1800), Volume XIII, pp. 273–80&lt;/ref&gt; and increased it again the following year, to £3.3s, as well as expanding the age limit from 17–45 to 16–50 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;Statutes at Large, Ruffhead's Edition, Volume XIII, pp. 316–17&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Impressment]], essentially conscription by the "press gang", was a favored recruiting method, though it was unpopular with the public, leading many to enlist in local militias to avoid regular service.&lt;ref&gt;War Office Papers, 4:966, Jenkinson to John Livesey and E. Brewer, 13 Apr. 1779&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts were made to draft such levies, much to the chagrin of the militia commanders.&lt;ref&gt;War Office Papers, 1:996, Sir William Codrington to Barrington, December 1778&lt;/ref&gt; Competition between naval and army press gangs, and even between rival ships or regiments, frequently resulted in brawls between the gangs in order to secure recruits for their unit.&lt;ref&gt;War Office Papers. 1:998, Lieutenant General Parker to Barrington, 19 June 1778.&lt;/ref&gt; Men would maim themselves to avoid the press gangs,&lt;ref&gt;War Office Papers, 1:1005, Oughton to Jenkinson, 27 May 1779&lt;/ref&gt; while many deserted at the first opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, Charles McLean (1912), "Guide to the materials for American history, to 1783, in the Public record office of Great Britain", Washington, D.C., Carnegie institution of Washington, Volume II, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Pressed men were militarily unreliable; regiments with large numbers of such men were deployed to garrisons such as Gibraltar or the West Indies, purely to increase the difficulty in successfully deserting.&lt;ref&gt;War Office Papers, 4:966, Jenkinson to Amherst, 26 Oct. 1779&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1781, the Army numbered approximately 121,000 men globally,&lt;ref name="British Army 1775–1783" /&gt; 48,000 of whom were stationed throughout the Americas.&lt;ref name="totallyhistory.com" /&gt; Of the 171,000 sailors&lt;ref name="Mackesy 1964 pp. 6, 176" /&gt; who served in the Royal Navy throughout the conflict, around a quarter were pressed.

===== Leadership =====

Britain had a difficult time appointing a determined senior military leadership in America. Thomas Gage, Commander-in-Chief of North America at the outbreak of the war, was criticized for being too lenient on the rebellious colonists. Jeffrey Amherst, who was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in 1778, refused a direct command in America, due to unwillingness to take sides in the war.&lt;ref&gt;Ketchum (1997), p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; Admiral [[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel|Augustus Keppel]] similarly opposed a command, stating; "I cannot draw the sword in such a cause". The [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Earl of Effingham|Earl of Effingham]] resigned his commission when his regiment was posted to America, while William Howe and John Burgoyne were opposed to military solutions to the crisis. Howe and Henry Clinton both stated they were unwilling participants, and were only following orders.&lt;ref&gt;Ketchum (1997), p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Logistics =====
[[File:Grenadier, 40th Foot, 1767.jpg|thumb|Grenadier of the [[40th Regiment of Foot]] in 1767, armed with a Brown Bess musket]]

Logistical organization of eighteenth century armies was chaotic at best, and the British Army was no exception. No logistical corps existed in the modern sense; while on campaign in foreign territories such as America, horses, wagons, and drivers were frequently requisitioned from the locals, often by impressment or by hire.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, Francis (1879). "History of the Royal Regiment of Artillery", Volume 1. J. Murray, pp. 131, 303, 309&lt;/ref&gt; No centrally organized medical corps existed. It was common for surgeons to have no formal medical education, and no diploma or entry examination was required. Nurses sometimes were apprentices to surgeons, but many were drafted from the women who [[camp follower|followed the army]].&lt;ref&gt;Sergeant Lamb, "Journal of the American War", p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; Army surgeons and doctors were poorly paid and were regarded as social inferiors to other officers.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, History of the Royal Regiment of Artillery, Volume 2, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

The heavy personal equipment and wool uniform of the regular infantrymen were wholly unsuitable for combat in America, and the outfit was especially ill-suited to comfort and agile movement.&lt;ref&gt;Burgoyne, State of the Expedition, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Battle of Monmouth]] in late June 1778, the temperature exceeded 100°[[Fahrenheit|F]] (37.8°[[Celsius|C]]) and is said to have claimed more lives through [[heat stroke]] than through actual combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Battle of Monmouth Courthouse|url=http://www.robinsonlibrary.com/america/unitedstates/1775/campaigns/monmouth.htm|website=Robinson Library|publisher=Self-published|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard-issue firearm of the British Army was the [[Brown Bess|Land Pattern Musket]]. Some officers preferred their troops to fire careful, measured shots (around two per minute), rather than rapid firing. A bayonet made firing difficult, as its cumbersome shape hampered ramming down the charge into the barrel.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, Ernest Marsh (1908), Review of the History of Infantry, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; British troops had a tendency to fire impetuously, resulting in inaccurate fire, a trait for which John Burgoyne criticized them during the Saratoga campaign. Burgoyne instead encouraged bayonet charges to break up enemy formations, which was a preferred tactic in most European armies at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan, Volume III, p. 6; Volume IV, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Officer and Serjeant of a Highland Regiment.jpg|thumb|left|Soldiers of the [[42nd Regiment of Foot|Black Watch]] armed with [[Brown Bess]] muskets, c. 1790]]

Every battalion in America had organized its own rifle company by the end of the war, although rifles were not formally issued to the army until the [[Baker Rifle]] in 1801.&lt;ref&gt;Fortescue, The British Army, 1783–1802, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Flintlocks were heavily dependent on the weather; high winds could blow the gunpowder from the [[flash pan]],&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer, Charles Winthrop (1910), "Firearms in American History", p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; while heavy rain could soak the [[paper cartridge]], ruining the powder and rendering the musket unable to fire. Furthermore, flints used in British muskets were of notoriously poor quality; they could only be fired around six times before requiring resharpening, while American flints could fire sixty. This led to a common expression among the British: "Yankee flint was as good as a glass of grog".&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan, Volume IV, pp. 224, 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Provisioning troops and sailors proved to be an immense challenge, as the majority of food stores had to be shipped overseas from Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Minute Book of a Board of General Officers of the British Army in New York, 1781. New York Historical Society Collections, 1916, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; The need to maintain Loyalist support prevented the Army from living off the land.&lt;ref&gt;Black (2001), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Other factors also impeded this option; the countryside was too sparsely populated and the inhabitants were largely hostile or indifferent, the network of roads and bridges was poorly developed, and the area which the British controlled was so limited that foraging parties were frequently in danger of being ambushed.&lt;ref&gt;Correspondence of George III with Lord North, Volume II, pp. 7, 52&lt;/ref&gt; After France entered the war, the threat of the French navy increased the difficulty of transporting supplies to America. Food supplies were frequently in bad condition. The climate was also against the British in the southern colonies and the Caribbean, where the intense summer heat caused food supplies to sour and spoil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Merril D. Smith |title=The World of the American Revolution: A Daily Life Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yqxmCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA374|year=2015|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Life at sea was little better. Sailors and passengers were issued a daily food ration, largely consisting of [[hardtack]] and beer.&lt;ref name=RoyNavyMus&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheet_ship_biscuit.htm |title=Ships Biscuits – Royal Navy hardtack |publisher=Royal Navy Museum |accessdate=2010-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091031064002/http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheet_ship_biscuit.htm |archivedate=October 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hardtack was often infested by weevils and was so tough that it earned the nicknames "molar breakers" and "worm castles",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.19thusregulars.com/html/hardtack.html |title=19th United States Infantry |publisher=19thusregulars.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-25|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120715204518/http://www.19thusregulars.com/html/hardtack.html|archivedate=July 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it sometimes had to be broken up with cannon shot. Meat supplies often spoiled on long voyages.&lt;ref&gt;Lowell, Edward J and Andrews, Raymond J (June 15, 1997) "The Hessians in the Revolutionary War", Corner House Pub, {{ISBN|9780879281168}}, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of fresh fruit and vegetables gave rise to scurvy, one of the biggest killers at sea.&lt;ref name="GARD2016" /&gt;

===== Discipline =====

Discipline was harsh in the armed forces, and [[Flagellation|the lash]] was used to punish even trivial offences—and not used sparingly.&lt;ref&gt;Howe, (Sir) William, Orderly Book, edited by B. F. Stevens (London, 1890), pp. 263, 288&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, two redcoats received 1,000 lashes each for robbery during the Saratoga campaign,&lt;ref&gt;Burgoyne, John, Orderly Book, edited by E. B. O'Callaghan (Albany, 1860), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; while another received 800 lashes for striking a superior officer.&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Orderly Book, pp. 263, 288&lt;/ref&gt; Flogging was a common punishment in the Royal Navy and came to be associated with the stereotypical hardiness of sailors.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.rmg.co.uk/explore/sea-and-ships/facts/ships-and-seafarers/life-at-sea-in-the-age-of-sail Life at sea in the age of sail]". National Maritime Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the harsh discipline, a distinct lack of self-discipline pervaded all ranks of the British forces. Soldiers had an intense passion for gambling, reaching such excesses that troops would often wager their own uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Memoir, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; Many drank heavily, and this was not exclusive to the lower ranks; William Howe was said to have seen many "crapulous mornings" while campaigning in New York. John Burgoyne drank heavily on a nightly basis towards the end of the Saratoga campaign. The two generals were also reported to have found solace with the wives of subordinate officers to ease the stressful burdens of command.&lt;ref&gt;Riedesel, Mrs. General, Letters and Journals, translated from the original German by W. L. Stone (Albany, 1867) p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; During the Philadelphia campaign, British officers deeply offended local Quakers by entertaining their mistresses in the houses where they had been quartered.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, Charles, History of the American War (London, 1794), Volume I, p. 309&lt;/ref&gt; Some reports indicated that British troops were generally scrupulous in their treatment of non-combatants.&lt;ref&gt;Fortescue, The British Army, 1783–1802, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to diaries of Hessian soldiers, who recorded their disapproval of British conduct towards the colonists, such as the destruction of property and the execution of prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Schwamenfeld. "The Foundation of British Strength: National Identity and the Common British Soldier." Ph.D. diss., Florida State University 2007, pp. 123–24&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of Hessian soldiers caused considerable anxiety among the colonists, both Patriot and Loyalist, who viewed them as brutal mercenaries.&lt;ref&gt;Schwamenfeld (2007), pp. 123–24&lt;/ref&gt; British soldiers were often contemptuous in their treatment of Hessian troops, despite orders from General Howe that "the English should treat the Germans as brothers". The order only began to have any real effect when the Hessians learned to speak a minimal degree of English, which was seen as a prerequisite for the British troops to accord them any respect.&lt;ref&gt;Schwamenfeld (2007), p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

During peacetime, the Army's idleness led to it being riddled with corruption and inefficiency, resulting in many administrative difficulties once campaigning began.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton, Anthony (2007). The British Officer: Leading the Army from 1660 to the Present. Routledge. {{ISBN|178159287X}}, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Strategic deficiencies ====

The British leadership soon discovered it had overestimated the capabilities of its own troops, while underestimating those of the colonists, causing a sudden re-think in British planning.&lt;ref name="Ketchum208_9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Frothingham298" /&gt; The ineffective initial response of British military and civil officials to the onset of the rebellion had allowed the advantage to shift to the colonists, as British authorities rapidly lost control over every colony.&lt;ref name="John C. Miller 1959 410–12" /&gt; A microcosm of these shortcomings were evident at the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]]. It took ten hours for the British leadership to respond following the sighting of the Americans on the Charlestown Peninsula, giving the colonists ample time to reinforce their defenses.&lt;ref name="French263"&gt;[[#French|French]], pp. 263–65&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than opt for a simple flanking attack that would have rapidly succeeded with minimal loss,&lt;ref&gt;Frothingham, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; the British decided on repeated frontal attacks. The results were telling; the British suffered 1,054 casualties of a force of around 3,000 after repeated frontal assaults.&lt;ref&gt;Frothingham pp. 191, 194&lt;/ref&gt; The British leadership had nevertheless remained excessively optimistic, believing that just two regiments could suppress the rebellion in Massachusetts.&lt;ref name="Frothingham156"&gt;[[#Frothingham|Frothingham]], p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ferling15&gt;[[#Ferling|Ferling, 2015]], pp. 127–29&lt;/ref&gt;

Debate persists over whether a British defeat was a guaranteed outcome. [[John E. Ferling|Ferling]] argues that the odds were so long, the defeat of Britain was nothing short of a miracle.&lt;ref&gt;John E. Ferling, ''Almost A Miracle: The American Victory in the War of Independence'' (2009), pp. 562–77.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Ellis|Ellis]], however, considers that the odds always favored the Americans, and questions whether a British victory by any margin was realistic. Ellis argues that the British squandered their only opportunities for a decisive success in 1777, and that the strategic decisions undertaken by William Howe underestimated the challenges posed by the Americans. Ellis concludes that, once Howe failed, the opportunity for a British victory "would never come again".&lt;ref name="Ellis 2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph J. Ellis|title=Revolutionary Summer: The Birth of American Independence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z4RqZJzho1QC&amp;pg=PR11|year=2013|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0-307-70122-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the United States Army's official textbook argues that, had Britain been able to commit 10,000 fresh troops to the war in 1780, a British victory was within the realms of possibility.&lt;ref name="Richard W. Stewart 2005 p. 103"&gt;[http://history.army.mil/books/AMH-V1/ch04.htm Richard W. Stewart, ed., ''American Military History Volume 1 The United States Army And The Forging Of A Nation, 1775–1917" (2005)] ch 4  "The Winning of Independence, 1777–1783" (2005), p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== William Howe =====
[[File:WilliamHowe1777ColorMezzotint.jpeg|thumb|left|A 1777 mezzotint of Sir William Howe, British [[Commander-in-Chief, North America|Commander-in-Chief]] from 1775–1778]]

Historians such as Ellis and Stewart have observed that, under William Howe's command, the British squandered several opportunities to achieve a decisive victory over the Americans.&lt;ref name="Richard W. Stewart 2005 p. 103" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellis 2013" /&gt; Throughout the New York and Philadelphia campaigns, Howe made several strategic errors, errors which cost the British opportunities for a complete victory. At [[Battle of Long Island|Long Island]], Howe failed to even attempt an encirclement of Washington,&lt;ref name="Battle of Long Island"&gt;Adams, Charles Francis, [https://archive.org/stream/americanhistoric18951896jame#page/668/mode/1up "Battle of Long Island"], in ''American Historical Review'' (1895–1896), pp. 668–669.&lt;/ref&gt; and actively restrained his subordinates from mounting an aggressive pursuit of the defeated American army.&lt;ref name="Adams, Charles Francis 1896 p. 657" /&gt; At [[Battle of White Plains|White Plains]], he refused to engage Washington's vulnerable army, and instead concentrated his efforts upon a hill which offered the British no strategic advantage.&lt;ref name="Fischer 2004, pp. 102–11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barnet Schecter 2002" /&gt; After securing control of New York, Howe dispatched Henry Clinton to capture Newport, a measure which Clinton was opposed to, on the grounds the troops assigned to his command could have been put to better use in pursuing Washington's retreating army.&lt;ref name="Ridpath 1915" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stedman, Charles 1794 p. 221" /&gt; Despite the bleak outlook for the revolutionary cause&lt;ref name="Fischer, pp. 138–142"&gt;Fischer, pp. 138–142&lt;/ref&gt; and the surge of Loyalist activity in the wake of Washington's defeats,&lt;ref name="American History 1982 p. 130" /&gt; Howe made no attempt to mount an attack upon Washington while the Americans settled down into winter quarters, much to their surprise.&lt;ref name="Lecky, William 1891 p. 57" /&gt;

During planning for the Saratoga campaign, Howe was left with the choice of committing his army to support Burgoyne, or capture Philadelphia, the revolutionary capital. Howe decided upon the latter, determining that Washington was of a greater threat. When Howe launched his campaign, he took his army upon a time-consuming route through the Chesapeake Bay, rather than the more sensible choices of overland through New Jersey, or by sea through the Delaware Bay. The move left him unable to assist Burgoyne even if it was required of him. The decision so angered Parliament, that Howe was accused by Tories on both sides of the Atlantic of treason.&lt;ref name="Campaign of 1777" /&gt;

During the Philadelphia campaign, Howe failed to pursue and destroy the defeated Americans on two occasions; once after the [[Battle of Brandywine]],&lt;ref name="Higginbotham pp. 181" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Adams, Charles Francis p. 43" /&gt; and again after the [[Battle of Germantown]].&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk" /&gt; At the [[Battle of White Marsh]], Howe failed to even attempt to exploit the vulnerable American rear,&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt; and then inexplicably ordered a retreat to Philadelphia after only minor skirmishes, astonishing both sides.&lt;ref name="McGuire, p. 254" /&gt; While the Americans wintered only twenty miles away, Howe made no effort to attack their camp, which critics argue could have ended the war.&lt;ref name="Noel Fairchild Busch 1974" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A Concluding Commentary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="history.army.mil" /&gt; Following the conclusion of the campaign, Howe resigned his commission, and was replaced by Henry Clinton on May 24, 1778.&lt;ref name="Frances H. Kennedy 2014 163" /&gt;

Contrary to Howe's more hostile critics, however, there were strategic factors at play which impeded aggressive action. Howe may have been dissuaded from pursuing aggressive manoeuvres due to the memory of the grievous losses the British suffered at Bunker Hill.&lt;ref&gt;Frothingham pp. 152–53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Kenneth T; Dunbar, David S (2005). Empire City: New York Through the Centuries. Columbia University Press. {{ISBN|9780231109093}}, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; During the major campaigns in New York and Philadelphia, Howe often wrote of the scarcity of adequate provisions, which hampered his ability to mount effective campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Colonial Office Papers, Manuscripts in the Public Record Office, 5:93, Howe to Dartmouth, 1st December 1775&lt;/ref&gt;  Howe's tardiness in launching the New York campaign, and his reluctance to allow Cornwallis to vigorously pursue Washington's beaten army, have both been attributed to the paucity of available food supplies.&lt;ref&gt;Colonial Office Papers, 5:93, Howe to Germain, 7 June and 7 July 1776&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A View of the Evidence (London, 1783), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

During the winter of 1776–1777, Howe split his army into scattered cantonments. This decision dangerously exposed the individual forces to defeat in detail, as the distance between them was such that they could not mutually support each other. This strategic failure allowed the Americans to achieve victory at the [[Battle of Trenton]], and the concurrent [[Battle of Princeton]].&lt;ref&gt;Correspondence of George III with Lord North, Volume II, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; While a major strategic error to divide an army in such a manner, the quantity of available food supplies in New York was so low that Howe had been compelled to take such a decision. The garrisons were widely spaced so their respective foraging parties would not interfere with each other's efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Colonial Office Papers, 5:93, Howe to Germain, 30 Nov 1776&lt;/ref&gt; Howe's difficulties during the Philadelphia campaign were also greatly exacerbated by the poor quality and quantity of available provisions.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, American War, Volume I, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Clinton and Cornwallis =====
[[File:First Marquis of Cornwallis.jpg|thumb|General [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Cornwallis]] led British forces in the [[Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War|southern campaign]].]]

In 1780, the primary British strategy hinged upon a Loyalist uprising in the south, for which Charles Cornwallis was chiefly responsible. After an encouraging success at [[Battle of Camden|Camden]], Cornwallis was poised to invade North Carolina. However, any significant Loyalist support had been effectively destroyed at the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]], and the British Legion, the cream of his army, had been decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Cowpens]]. Following both defeats, Cornwallis was fiercely criticized for detaching a significant portion of his army without adequate mutual support.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Despite the defeats, Cornwallis chose to proceed into North Carolina, gambling his success upon a large Loyalist uprising which never materialized.&lt;ref name="Lumpkin 2000"&gt;Lumpkin, From Savannah to Yorktown: The American Revolution in the South (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, subsequent engagements cost Cornwallis valuable troops he could not replace, as at the [[Battle of Guilford Courthouse]],&lt;ref name="MtVernon" /&gt; and the Americans steadily wore his army down in an exhaustive [[war of attrition]]. Cornwallis had thus left the Carolinas ripe for reconquest. The Americans had largely achieved this aim by the end of 1781, effectively confining the British to the coast, and undoing all the progress they had made in the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;Pancake, John (1985). This Destructive War. University of Alabama Press. p. 221&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

In a last-ditch attempt to win the war in the South, Cornwallis resolved to invade Virginia, in order to cut off the American's supply base to the Carolinas. Henry Clinton, Cornwallis' superior, strongly opposed the plan, believing the decisive confrontations would take place between Washington in the North.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt; London had approved Cornwallis plan, however they had failed to include Clinton in the decision-making, despite his seniority over Cornwallis, leading to a muddled strategic direction.&lt;ref name="Public Record Office" /&gt; Cornwallis then decided to invade Virginia without informing Clinton of his intentions.&lt;ref&gt;Clinton, H.; ''The American Rebellion''. Note: This lack of notification was one of Clinton's main arguments in his own defense in the controversy that followed the surrender at Yorktown.&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton, however, had wholly failed to construct a coherent strategy for British campaigning that year,&lt;ref name="auto3" /&gt; owing to his fractious relationship that he shared with Mariot Arbuthnot, his naval counterpart.&lt;ref name="Billias 1969" /&gt;

As the Franco-American army approached Cornwallis at Yorktown, he made no attempt to [[sally (military)|sally out]] and engage before siege lines could be erected,  despite the repeated urging of his subordinate officers.&lt;ref name="Ketchum, p. 205" /&gt; Expecting [[relief (military)|relief]] to soon arrive from Clinton, Cornwallis prematurely abandoned all of his outer defences, which were then promptly occupied by the besiegers, serving to hasten the British defeat.&lt;ref&gt;Lengel, Edward (2005). General George Washington. New York: Random House Paperbacks. {{ISBN|0812969502}}. p. 337&lt;/ref&gt; These factors contributed to the eventual surrender of Cornwallis' entire army, and the end of major operations in North America.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, Thomas (1970). The Perils of Peace. New York: The Dial Press. {{ISBN|9780061139116}}, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Howe before him, Clinton's efforts to campaign suffered from chronic supply issues. In 1778, Clinton wrote to Germain complaining of the lack of supplies, even after the arrival of a convoy from Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Colonial Office Papers, 5:96, Clinton to Germain, 15 September 1778&lt;/ref&gt; That winter, the supply issue had deteriorated so badly, that Clinton expressed considerable anxiety over how the troops were going to be properly fed.&lt;ref&gt;Colonial Office Papers, 5:97, Clinton to Germain, 15 December 1778&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton was largely inactive in the North throughout 1779, launching few major campaigns. This inactivity was partially due to the shortage of food.&lt;ref&gt;Colonial Office Papers, 5:98, Haldimand to Clinton, 19 July and 29 August 1779&lt;/ref&gt; By 1780, the situation had not improved. Clinton wrote a frustrated correspondence to Germain, voicing concern that a "fatal consequence will ensue" if matters did not improve. By October that year, Clinton again wrote to Germain, angered that the troops in New York had not received "an ounce" of that year's allotted stores from Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Colonial Office Papers, 5:100, Clinton to Germain, 31st October 1780&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Campaign issues ====

Suppressing a rebellion in America presented the British with major problems. The key issue was distance; it could take up to three months to cross the Atlantic, and orders from London were often outdated by the time that they arrived.&lt;ref&gt;Black (2001), p. 39; Greene and Pole (1999), pp. 298, 306&lt;/ref&gt; The colonies had never been formally united prior to the conflict and there was no centralized area of ultimate strategic importance. Traditionally, the fall of a capital city often signalled the end of a conflict,&lt;ref&gt;Rossman, Vadim (2016), "Capital Cities: Varieties and Patterns of Development and Relocation", Taylor &amp; Francis, {{ISBN|1317562852}}, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; yet the war continued unabated even after the fall of major settlements such as New York, Philadelphia (which was the Patriot capital), and Charleston.&lt;ref&gt;Edward E. Curtis, The Organization of the British Army in the American Revolution, Conclusion, (Yale U.P. 1926), [http://www.americanrevolution.org/britisharmy6.php] Retrieved 10 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Britain's ability to project its power overseas lay chiefly in the power of the Royal Navy, allowing her to control major coastal settlements with relative ease and enforce a strong blockade of colonial ports. However, the overwhelming majority of the American population was [[agrarian society|agrarian]], not urban. As a result, the American economy proved resilient enough to withstand the blockade's effects.&lt;ref name="Pole 2004" /&gt;

[[File:John Singleton Copley 001.jpg|thumb|left|[[Black Loyalist]] soldiers fought alongside [[British Army|British regulars]] in the 1781 [[Battle of Jersey]], from ''[[The Death of Major Peirson]]''.]]

Wealthy Loyalists wielded great influence in London&lt;ref&gt;C.

Consequently, British planners pinned the success of their strategies on popular uprisings of Loyalists. Historians have estimated that Loyalists made up only 15–20% of the population (vs. 40–45% Patriots)&lt;ref&gt;Greene and Pole (1999), p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; and that they continued to deceive themselves on their level of support as late as 1780.&lt;ref name="Lecky1891"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Edward Hartpole Lecky|title=A History of England: In the Eighteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m3cUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA139|year=1891|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British discovered that any significant level of organized Loyalist activity would require the continued presence of British regulars,&lt;ref&gt;Black (2001), p.&amp;nbsp;12.&lt;/ref&gt; which presented them with a major dilemma. The manpower that the British had available was insufficient to both protect Loyalist territory and counter American advances.&lt;ref&gt;Black (2001), pp.&amp;nbsp;13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; The vulnerability of Loyalist militias was repeatedly demonstrated in the South, where they suffered strings of defeats to their Patriot neighbors. The most crucial juncture of this was at Kings Mountain, and the victory of the Patriot partisans irreversibly crippled Loyalist military capability in the South.&lt;ref name="Buchanan, p. 241" /&gt;

Upon the entry of France and Spain into the conflict, the British were forced to severely limit the number of troops and warships that they sent to North America in order to defend other key territories and the British mainland.&lt;ref name="Ketchum 1997, p. 405–448" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Higginbotham 1983, pp. 175–88" /&gt; As a result, King George III abandoned any hope of subduing America militarily while he had a European war to contend with.&lt;ref&gt;Ferling (2007), p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; The small size of Britain's army left them unable to concentrate their resources primarily in one [[theater (military)|theater]] as they had done in the Seven Years' War, leaving them at a critical disadvantage.&lt;ref name="Cf., Richard Pares, 1936: 429–65" /&gt; The British were compelled to disperse troops from the Americas to Europe and the East Indies, and these forces were unable to assist one other as a result, precariously exposing them to defeat.&lt;ref name="Alfred Thayer Mahan 1890 p. 534" /&gt; In North America, the immediate strategic focus of the French, Spanish, and British shifted to Jamaica,&lt;ref&gt;Dull, (1985) p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; whose sugar exports were more valuable to the British than the economy of the Thirteen Colonies combined.&lt;ref name="O'Shaughnessy p. 208" /&gt;

Following the end of the war, Britain had lost some of her most populous colonies. However, the economic effects of the loss were negligible in the long-term, and she became a global superpower just 32 years after the end of the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Tellier, L.-N. (2009).

{{Main|Continental Army|Minutemen}}
[[File:Battle of Guiliford Courthouse 15 March 1781.jpg|thumb|1st Maryland Regiment holding the line at the [[Battle of Guilford]]]]
The Americans began the war with significant disadvantages compared to the British. They had no national government, no national army or navy, no financial system, no banks, no established credit, and no functioning government departments, such as a treasury. The Congress tried to handle administrative affairs through legislative committees, which proved inefficient. The state governments were themselves brand new and officials had no administrative experience. In peacetime the colonies relied heavily on ocean travel and shipping, but that was now shut down by the British blockade and the Americans had to rely on slow overland travel.

However, the Americans had multiple advantages that in the long run outweighed the initial disadvantages they faced. The Americans had a large prosperous population that depended not on imports but on local production for food and most supplies, while the British were mostly shipped in from across the ocean. The British faced a vast territory far larger than Britain or France, located at a far distance from home ports. Most of the Americans lived on farms distant from the seaports—the British could capture any port but that did not give them control over the hinterland. They were on their home ground, had a smoothly functioning, well organized system of local and state governments, newspapers and printers, and internal lines of communications. They had a long-established system of local militia, previously used to combat the French and Native Americans, with companies and an officer corps that could form the basis of local militias, and provide a training ground for the national army created by Congress.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Pole and Greene, eds. '' Companion to the American Revolution'', ch. 36–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Motivation was a major asset. The Patriots wanted to win; over 200,000 fought in the war; 25,000 died. The British expected the Loyalists to do much of the fighting, but they did much less than expected. The British also hired German mercenaries to do much of their fighting.&lt;ref name="Michael Lanning 2009 195–96" /&gt;

At the onset of the war, the Americans had no major international allies. Battles such as the [[Battle of Bennington]], the [[Battles of Saratoga]] and even defeats such as the [[Battle of Germantown]]&lt;ref name="Trevelyan, p. 249"&gt;Trevelyan, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; proved decisive in gaining the attention and support of powerful European nations such as France and Spain, who moved from covertly supplying the Americans with weapons and supplies, to overtly supporting them militarily, moving the war to a global stage.&lt;ref name="K405_48"&gt;[[#Ketchum|Ketchum (1997)]], pp. 405–48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Allison, ''The American Revolution: A World War'' (2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

The new Continental Army suffered significantly from a lack of an effective training regime, and largely inexperienced officers and sergeants. The inexperience of its officers was compensated for in part by a few senior officers. The Americans solved their training dilemma during their stint in Winter Quarters at Valley Forge, where they were relentlessly drilled and trained by General [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben]], a veteran of the famed Prussian General Staff. He taught the Continental Army the essentials of military discipline, drills, tactics and strategy, and wrote the [[Revolutionary War Drill Manual]].&lt;ref&gt;Philander D. Chase.

[[File:Population Density in the American Colonies 1775.gif|thumb|Population density in the [[American Colonies]] in 1775]]

When the war began, the 13 colonies lacked a professional army or navy. Each colony sponsored local [[militia]]. Militiamen were lightly armed, had little training, and usually did not have uniforms. Their units served for only a few weeks or months at a time, were reluctant to travel far from home and thus were unavailable for extended operations, and lacked the training and discipline of soldiers with more experience. If properly used, however, their numbers could help the Continental armies overwhelm smaller British forces, as at the [[Battles of the American Revolutionary War|battles]] of [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Concord]], [[Battle of Bennington|Bennington]] and [[Saratoga campaign|Saratoga]], and the [[siege of Boston]]. Both sides used partisan warfare but the Americans effectively suppressed Loyalist activity when [[British Regulars|British regulars]] were not in the area.&lt;ref name="Black 2001 p. 59" /&gt;

Seeking to coordinate military efforts, the [[First Continental Congress|Continental Congress]] established a regular army on June 14, 1775, and appointed [[George Washington]] as commander-in-chief. The development of the Continental Army was always a work in progress, and Washington used both his regulars and state militia throughout the war.

Three current branches of the [[United States Military]] trace their institutional roots to the American Revolutionary War; the [[United States Army]] comes from the [[Continental Army]], formed by a resolution of the Continental Congress on June 14, 1775. The [[United States Navy]] recognizes October 13, 1775 as the date of its official establishment, the passage of the resolution of the Continental Congress at Philadelphia that created the [[Continental Navy]].&lt;ref name=Establish&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq59-13.htm|title=Establishment of the Navy, 13&amp;nbsp;October 1775|publisher=United States Navy|accessdate=November 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[United States Marine Corps]] links to the [[Continental Marines]] of the war, formed  by a resolution of the Continental Congress on November 10, 1775.  However, in 1783 both the [[Continental Navy]] and Continental Marines were disbanded.

=== Intelligence and espionage ===
{{Main|Intelligence operations in the American Revolutionary War|Intelligence in the American Revolutionary War}}

=== Soldiers and sailors ===
At the beginning of 1776, Washington commanded 20,000 men, with two-thirds enlisted in the Continental Army and the other third in the various state militias.&lt;ref name="Tread"&gt;Crocker (2006), p.&amp;nbsp;51.&lt;/ref&gt; About 250,000 men served as regulars or as militiamen for the Revolutionary cause in the eight years of the war, but there were never more than 90,000 men under arms at one time.

About 55,000 sailors served aboard American  privateers during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usmm.org/revolution.html |title=Privateers or Merchant Mariners help win the Revolutionary War |publisher=Usmm.org |date= |accessdate=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They used 1,700 ships, and they captured 2,283 enemy ships.&lt;ref name="John Pike" /&gt; [[John Paul Jones]] became the first great American naval hero, capturing [[HMS Drake (1777)|HMS ''Drake'']] on April 24, 1778, the first victory for any American military vessel in British waters.&lt;ref&gt;Higginbotham (1983), pp.&amp;nbsp;331–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Armies were small by European standards of the era, largely attributable, on the American side, to limitations such as lack of powder and other logistical capabilities; and, on the British side, to the difficulty of transporting troops across the Atlantic, as well as the dependence on local supplies, which the Patriots tried to cut off. The largest force Washington commanded was certainly under 17,000,&lt;ref&gt;Boatner (1974), p.&amp;nbsp;264.&lt;/ref&gt; and may have been no more than 13,000 troops, and even the combined American and French forces at the siege of Yorktown amounted to only about 19,000.&lt;ref name="Duffy-p13"&gt;Duffy, Christopher (2005). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=m1aRAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13 Military Experience in the Age of Reason]''. London: Routledge. {{ISBN|0203976851}}. p.&amp;nbsp;13. In the original 1987 edition, p.&amp;nbsp;17.&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, Duffy notes that in an era when European rulers were generally revising their forces downward, in favor of a size that could be most effectively controlled (the very different perspective of [[levée en masse|mass conscript]] armies came later, during the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]] and then the [[Napoleonic Wars]]), the largest army that [[Frederick the Great]] ever led into battle was 65,000 men (at Prague in 1757), and at other times he commanded between 23,000 and 50,000 men, considering the latter the most effective number.&lt;ref name="Duffy-p13" /&gt;

=== George Washington's roles ===
{{Main|George Washington in the American Revolution }}
General Washington assumed main five main roles during the war.&lt;ref&gt;R. Don Higginbotham, ''George Washington and the American Military Tradition'' (1985) ch 3&lt;/ref&gt;

First, he designed the overall strategy of the war, in cooperation with Congress. The goal was always independence.  When France entered the war, he worked closely with the soldiers it sent&amp;nbsp;– they were decisive in the great victory at Yorktown in 1781.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Selig, ''March to victory: Washington, Rochambeau, and the Yorktown Campaign of 1781'' (2005) [https://history.army.mil/html/books/rochambeau/index.html online].&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, he provided leadership of troops against the main British forces in 1775–77 and again in 1781. He lost many of his battles, but he never surrendered his army during the war, and he continued to fight the British relentlessly until the war's end.  Washington worked hard to develop a successful espionage system to detect British locations and plans. In 1778, he formed the [[Culper Ring]] to spy on enemy movements in New York City. In 1780 it discovered [[Benedict Arnold]] was a traitor.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Rose, ''Washington's Spies'' (2006) pp. 258–61.&lt;/ref&gt;  The British put a low value on intelligence, and its operations were of poor quality until 1780, when it finally inserted some spies with Congress and with Washington's command. Even then, however, British commanders ignored or downplayed threats that were revealed. The most serious intelligence failure came in 1781 when top commanders were unaware that The American and French armies at both left the Northeast and marched down to Yorktown, where they outnumbered Cornwallis by more than 2 to 1.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Kaplan, "The Hidden War: British Intelligence Operations during the American Revolution." ''William and Mary Quarterly'' (1990) 47#1: 115–38. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2938043 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Third, he was charged selecting and guiding the generals. In June 1776, Congress made its first attempt at running the war effort with the committee known as "Board of War and Ordnance", succeeded by the Board of War in July 1777, a committee which eventually included members of the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Gardner Bell|title=Commanding Generals and Chiefs of Staff, 1775–2005: Portraits &amp; Biographical Sketches of the United States Army's Senior Officer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xwyykzbi4pUC&amp;pg=PA3|year=2005|pages=3–4|isbn=9780160873300}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas S. Freeman, and Richard Harwell, ''Washington'' (1968) p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The command structure of the armed forces was a hodgepodge of Congressional appointees (and Congress sometimes made those appointments without Washington's input) with state-appointments filling the lower ranks. The results of his general staff were mixed, as some of his favorites never mastered the art of command, such as [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]]. Eventually, he found capable officers such as [[Nathanael Greene]], [[Daniel Morgan]], [[Henry Knox]] (chief of artillery), and [[Alexander Hamilton]] (chief of staff). The American officers never equaled their opponents in tactics and maneuver, and they lost most of the pitched battles. The great successes at Boston (1776), [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]] (1777), and [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] (1781) came from trapping the British far from base with much larger numbers of troops.&lt;ref&gt;Higginbotham, ''George Washington and the American Military Tradition'' (1985) ch 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourth he took charge of training the army and providing supplies, from food to gunpowder to tents. He recruited regulars and assigned Baron [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben]], a veteran of the Prussian general staff, to train them. He transformed Washington's army into a disciplined and effective force.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Whitridge, "Baron von Steuben, Washington's Drillmaster." ''History Today'' (July 1976) 26#7 pp. 429–36.&lt;/ref&gt;   The war effort and getting supplies to the troops were under the purview of Congress, but Washington pressured the Congress to provide the essentials. There was never nearly enough.&lt;ref&gt;E. Wayne Carp, ''To Starve the Army at Pleasure: Continental Army Administration and American Political Culture, 1775–1783'' (1990) p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington's fifth and most important role in the war effort was the embodiment of armed resistance to the Crown, serving as the representative man of the Revolution. His long-term strategy was to maintain an army in the field at all times, and eventually this strategy worked. His enormous personal and political stature and his political skills kept Congress, the army, the French, the militias, and the states all pointed toward a common goal. Furthermore, he permanently established the principle of civilian supremacy in military affairs by voluntarily resigning his commission and disbanding his army when the war was won, rather than declaring himself monarch. He also helped to overcome the distrust of a standing army by his constant reiteration that well-disciplined professional soldiers counted for twice as much as poorly trained and led militias.&lt;ref&gt;Edward G. Lengel, ''General George Washington: A Military Life'' (2005) pp. 365–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== African Americans ===
[[File:Soldiers at the siege of Yorktown (1781), by Jean-Baptiste-Antoine DeVerger.png|thumb|1780 drawing of American soldiers from the [[Yorktown campaign]] shows a black infantryman from the [[1st Rhode Island Regiment]].]]

[[African Americans in the Revolutionary War|African Americans]]—slave and free—served on both sides during the war. The British recruited slaves belonging to [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] masters and promised freedom to those who served by act of Lord [[Dunmore's Proclamation]]. Because of manpower shortages, George Washington lifted the ban on black enlistment in the Continental Army in January 1776. Small all-black units were formed in [[Rhode Island]] and [[Massachusetts]]; many slaves were promised freedom for serving. Some of the men promised freedom were sent back to their masters, after the war was over, out of political convenience. Another all-black unit came from [[Saint-Domingue]] with French colonial forces. At least 5,000 black soldiers fought for the Revolutionary cause.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan and Kaplan (1989), pp.&amp;nbsp;64–69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Leslie Alexander|title=Encyclopedia of African American History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uivtCqOlpTsC&amp;pg=PA356|year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=356|isbn=978-1-85109-774-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tens of thousands of slaves escaped during the war and joined British lines; others simply moved off in the chaos. For instance, in South Carolina, nearly 25,000 slaves (30% of the enslaved population) fled, migrated or died during the disruption of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kolchin, ''American Slavery: 1619–1877'', New York: Hill and Wang, 1994, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; This greatly disrupted plantation production during and after the war. When they withdrew their forces from Savannah and Charleston, the British also evacuated 10,000 slaves belonging to Loyalists.&lt;ref&gt;Kolchin, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Altogether, the British evacuated nearly 20,000 blacks at the end of the war. More than 3,000 of them were freedmen and most of these were resettled in Nova Scotia; other blacks were sold in the West Indies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Weir|title=The Encyclopedia of African American Military History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WEXj4gHHARgC&amp;pg=PA32|year=2004|publisher=Prometheus Books|pages=31–32|isbn=978-1-61592-831-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pybus|first=Cassandra|date=2005|title=Jefferson's Faulty Math: The Question of Slave Defections in the American Revolution|journal=The William and Mary Quarterly|volume=62|issue=2|pages=243–264|doi=10.2307/3491601|jstor=3491601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== American Indians ===

[[File:Couder Yorktown Versailles.JPG|thumb|Washington and the [[Comte de Rochambeau]] at Yorktown, 1781]]

Most [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] east of the [[Mississippi River]] were affected by the war, and many tribes were divided over the question of how to respond to the conflict. A few tribes were on friendly terms with the other Americans, but most Indians opposed the union of the Colonies as a potential threat to their territory. Approximately 13,000 Indians fought on the British side, with the largest group coming from the [[Iroquois]] tribes, who fielded around 1,500 men.&lt;ref&gt;Greene and Pole (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;393; Boatner (1974), p.&amp;nbsp;545.&lt;/ref&gt; The powerful [[Iroquois Confederacy]] was shattered as a result of the conflict, whatever side they took; the [[Seneca nation|Seneca]], [[Onondaga (tribe)|Onondaga]], and [[Cayuga nation|Cayuga]] nations sided with the British. Members of the [[Mohawk nation]] fought on both sides. Many [[Tuscarora (tribe)|Tuscarora]] and [[Oneida tribe|Oneida]] sided with the colonists. The Continental Army sent the [[Sullivan Expedition]] on raids throughout New York to cripple the Iroquois tribes that had sided with the British. Mohawk leaders [[Joseph Louis Cook]] and [[Joseph Brant]] sided with the Americans and the British respectively, and this further exacerbated the split.

Early in July 1776, a major action occurred in the fledgling conflict when the [[Cherokee]] allies of Britain attacked the [[Washington District, North Carolina|western frontier areas]] of [[North Carolina Colony|North Carolina]]. Their defeat resulted in a splintering of the Cherokee settlements and people, and was directly responsible for the rise of the [[Chickamauga Cherokee]], bitter enemies of the Colonials who carried on a [[Cherokee–American wars|frontier war]] for decades following the end of hostilities with Britain.&lt;ref name=finger1&gt;John Finger, ''Tennessee Frontiers: Three Regions in Transition'' (Bloomington, Ind.: Indiana University Press, 2001), pp. 43–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muscogee people|Creek]] and [[Seminole]] allies of Britain fought against Americans in Georgia and South Carolina. In 1778, a force of 800 Creeks destroyed American settlements along the [[Broad River (Georgia)|Broad River]] in Georgia. Creek warriors also joined [[Thomas Brown (loyalist)|Thomas Brown's]] raids into South Carolina and assisted Britain during the [[Siege of Savannah]].&lt;ref name="Ward1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ward|first=Harry M.|title=The war for independence and the transformation of American society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kgqa4_OBcIkC&amp;pg=PA198|accessdate=March 25, 2011|year=1999|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-1-85728-656-4|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Indians were involved in the fighting between Britain and Spain on the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] and up the Mississippi River—mostly on the British side. Thousands of Creeks, [[Chickasaw]]s, and [[Choctaw]]s fought in major battles such as the [[Battle of Fort Charlotte]], the [[Battle of Mobile (1781)|Battle of Mobile]], and the [[Siege of Pensacola]].&lt;ref name="O'Brien2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Brien|first=Greg|title=Pre-removal Choctaw history: exploring new paths|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jGFmNPevedUC&amp;pg=PA123|accessdate=March 25, 2011|date=April 30, 2008|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-3916-6|pages=123–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Race and class ===
Pybus (2005) estimates that about 20,000 slaves defected to or were captured by the British, of whom about 8,000 died from disease or wounds or were recaptured by the Patriots. The British took some 12,000 at the end of the war; of these 8000 remained in slavery. Including those who left during the war, a total of about 8000 to 10,000 slaves gained freedom.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; About 4000 freed slaves went to Nova Scotia and 1200 blacks remained slaves.&lt;ref&gt;John N. Grant, "Black Immigrants into Nova Scotia, 1776–1815." ''Journal of Negro History'' (1973): 253–270. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2716777 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James W. St G. Walker, ''The Black Loyalists: The Search for a Promised Land in Nova Scotia and Sierra Leone, 1783–1870'' (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

Baller (2006) examines family dynamics and mobilization for the Revolution in central Massachusetts. He reports that warfare and the farming culture were sometimes incompatible. Militiamen found that living and working on the family farm had not prepared them for wartime marches and the rigors of camp life. Rugged individualism conflicted with military discipline and regimentation. A man's birth order often influenced his military recruitment, as younger sons went to war and older sons took charge of the farm. A person's family responsibilities and the prevalent patriarchy could impede mobilization. Harvesting duties and family emergencies pulled men home regardless of the sergeant's orders. Some relatives might be Loyalists, creating internal strains. On the whole, historians conclude the Revolution's effect on patriarchy and inheritance patterns favored [[egalitarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;William Baller, "Farm Families and the American Revolution," ''Journal of Family History'' (2006) 31(1): 28–44. {{ISSN|0363-1990}}. Fulltext: online in [[EBSCO]].&lt;/ref&gt;

McDonnell (2006) shows a grave complication in Virginia's mobilization of troops was the conflicting interests of distinct social classes, which tended to undercut a unified commitment to the Patriot cause. The Assembly balanced the competing demands of elite slave-owning planters, [[Plain Folk of the Old South|the middling yeomen]] (some owning a few slaves), and landless indentured servants, among other groups. The Assembly used deferments, taxes, military service substitute, and conscription to resolve the tensions. Unresolved class conflict, however, made these laws less effective. There were violent protests, many cases of evasion, and large-scale desertion, so that Virginia's contributions came at embarrassingly low levels. With the British invasion of the state in 1781, Virginia was mired in class division as its native son, George Washington, made desperate appeals for troops.&lt;ref&gt;Michael A.

The '''Appalachian String Band Music Festival''' (often referred to simply as '''"Clifftop"''') is a weeklong gathering of thousands of string band musicians and their friends from across the country and around the world, who each year since 1990 have assembled near the New River Gorge in West Virginia in late July/early August to celebrate the evolving tradition of [[old-time music]] and the community of people who keep it thriving by preserving and contributing to that tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wvculture.org/stringband/index.html Official site]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4787188 Sounds from Clifftop (National Public Radio, 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Though the Festival offers contests (traditional band, neo-traditional band, fiddle, old-time banjo, and [[flatfoot dancing]]), [[Square dance|square dancing]], several concerts and workshops, and other organized activities such as yoga, basket making, and hymn singing, the heart and soul of the Festival is found in the campsites, where old time music provides a foundation for all kinds of straight-off-the-strings acoustic music (including Americana, cajun, Celtic, swing, bluegrass, Dawg, and even reggae), which in turn often spontaneously generate impromptu dancing and other festivities by the people gathered within earshot.

Though the Festival officially starts the Wednesday before the first full weekend in August, the grounds start filling up the weekend before with well-adorned campsites, many of which have music being played through the night.  One of the Festival's unique features is the Neo-Traditional Band Contest on Friday, in which highest scores are given to bands that creatively extend the old time music tradition into other musical voices, instrumentation, and styles.

Over the years, the Festival has been frequented by accomplished Nashville musicians like John Hartford and Tim O'Brien and Leftover Salmon jam band leader Vince Hermann, legendary old time Appalachian musicians like [[Melvin Wine]] and [[Lester McCumbers]], leading "second generation" old time musicians like [[Mike Seeger]], [[Bruce Molsky]], [[Rafe Stefanini]], [[Brad Leftwich]],and [[Ira Bernstein]], and the youngest  generation of old time musicians like [[Jake Krack]].

The Festival takes place each summer at [[Camp Washington-Carver Complex | Camp Washington-Carver]], in [[Clifftop, Fayette County, West Virginia]], United States and is sponsored by the West Virginia Division of Culture and History.

The '''B330''' (previously known as the '''Nautilus space complex module''' and '''BA 330''') is an [[inflatable space habitat]] being privately developed by [[Bigelow Aerospace]]. The design was evolved from [[NASA]]'s [[TransHab]] habitat concept. B330 will have {{convert|330|m3|sp=us}} of internal volume, hence its numeric designation.

The craft is intended to support zero-gravity research including scientific missions and manufacturing processes. Beyond its industrial and scientific purposes, however, it has potential as a destination for [[space tourism]] and a craft for missions destined for the [[Moon]] and [[Mars]].

== Features ==
Compared to their volume-mass ratio, expandable modules offer more living space than traditional rigid modules. For example, the pressurised volume of a 23-tonne B330 module is 330 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, compared to 106 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of the 15 ton [[Destiny (ISS module)|ISS Destiny module]]. Thus B330 offers 210% more habitable space, with an increase in mass of only 33%.

Bigelow also claims that the module provides [[radiation protection]] equivalent to, and [[Hypervelocity ballistic shield#Hypervelocity|ballistic protection]] superior to, the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref name=ba_ba330_20101229&gt;[http://bigelowaerospace.com/ba330.php Bigelow Aerospace&amp;nbsp;— Next-Generation Commercial Space Stations:  BA 330] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213085414/http://www.bigelowaerospace.com/ba330.php |date=13 December 2010 }}, Bigelow Aerospace, 2010, accessed 29 December 2010. ([http://bigelowaerospace.com/b330/])&lt;/ref&gt;

The exterior of the craft is intended to be {{convert|45|ft|1|order=flip}} long by {{convert|22|ft|1|order=flip}} in diameter&lt;ref name=spa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/855-progress-inflatable-private-space-module.html |title=Progress Made on Inflatable Private Space Module |last=David |first=Leonard |date=8 March 2005 |publisher=Space.com |accessdate=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the module will weigh at least {{convert|50000|lb|order=flip}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://moonandback.com/2011/11/30/moonandback-interview-with-robert-bigelow-part-3-pluses-and-minuse/ |title=Moonandback Interview With Robert Bigelow, part 3 – Pluses And Minuse |date=30 November 2011 |publisher=Moonandback Media |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B330_diagram"/&gt;&lt;!-- Mass in quote updated --&gt;

The habitat is designed to have two [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar arrays]] and two thermal radiator arrays for heat dissipation, as well as life support systems to sustain a crew of up to six astronauts.  It will also have "a zero-g toilet with solid and liquid waste collection, semi-private berths for each crew member, exercise equipment, a food storage and preparation station, lighting, and a personal hygiene station."&lt;ref name=nsf20140207/&gt;

The wall thickness will be approximately {{convert|18|in|m|order=flip}} when the module is fully expanded. The walls are made up of 24 to 36 layers for ballistic protection, [[thermal protection]], radiation protection&lt;ref name=bbw20130131&gt;{{cite news |title=Robert Bigelow Explains His Inflatable Space Module |url=http://www.businessweek.com/videos/2013-01-31/robert-bigelow-explains-his-inflatable-space-module |accessdate=23 May 2013 |newspaper=Bloomberg Businessweek |date=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and will be as hard as concrete once the craft is fully expanded.&lt;ref name="rj8576221"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2006/Jul-23-Sun-2006/news/8576221.html |title=Week in Review: Reporters Notebook |work=Las Vegas Review-Journal |first=Keith |last=Rogers |date=23 July 2006 |accessdate=1 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exterior will also feature four large windows coated with a UV protection film.

Dual-redundant [[Reaction control system|control thruster]] systems are to be used, one using mono-propellant [[hydrazine]] and the other using gaseous hydrogen and gaseous oxygen.  The latter system is refillable from the on-board environmental control system.&lt;ref name=nsf20140207/&gt; Module-specific [[avionics]] will be provided for [[navigation]], [[Spacecraft propulsion|re-boost]], [[docking and berthing of spacecraft|docking]], and other [[Flight dynamics (spacecraft)|on-orbit maneuvering]].

Bigelow Aerospace is developing the B330 module to be compatible to mate with other spacecraft such as Russian [[Soyuz spacecraft]], SpaceX's Dragon V2, Boeing's CST-100 Starliner, and NASA's Orion spacecraft. The module's large size is particularly beneficial for lunar astronauts or the crews of other long-duration space missions,&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:BA-330 space station model.JPG|thumbnail|Mock-up of the B330]]

While details on the purchased [[TransHab]] [[Transhab#Technology|technology]] have not been published, [[NASA]] states the following about the structure of the module that Bigelow adopted as a starting point:

{{quote|text=With almost two dozen layers, TransHab's foot-thick inflatable shell is a marvel of innovative design. The layers are fashioned to break up particles of space debris and tiny [[meteorites]] that may hit the shell with a speed seven times as fast as a bullet. The outer layers protect multiple inner bladders, made of a material that holds in the module's air. The shell also provides insulation from temperatures in space that can range from +121°C (+250°F) in sunlight to -128°C (-200°F) in the shade.

The key to the debris protection is successive layers of Nextel, a material commonly used as insulation under the hoods of many cars, spaced between several-inches-thick layers of open cell foam, similar to foam used for chair cushions on Earth. The Nextel and foam layers cause a particle to shatter as it hits, losing more and more of its energy as it penetrates deeper.

Many layers into the shell is a layer of super-strong woven Kevlar that holds the module's shape. The air is held inside by three bladders of [[Combitherm]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.dupont.com/Surlyn/en_US/uses_apps/cookinfilm.html |title=DuPont, Surlyn-resin, Combitherm-film case study}}&lt;/ref&gt; material commonly used in the food-packing industry. The innermost layer, forming the inside wall of the module, is [[Nomex]] cloth, a fireproof material that also protects the bladder from scuffs and scratches.|sign=NASA [[TransHab]] Concept| source=&lt;ref name="transhab1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/history/station/transhab/ |title=TransHab Concept |work=[[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA.gov) |date=27 June 2003 |accessdate=1 June 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070601021217/http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/history/station/transhab/ |archivedate=1 June 2007 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bigelow has described their technology to news media&lt;ref name=IEEEspectrum200702&gt;[http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/space-flight/putting-up-the-ritz/0 Putting Up the Ritz: Can pneumatic buildings breathe life into space tourism?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324090654/http://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/space-flight/putting-up-the-ritz/0 |date=24 March 2012 }}, James Oberg, ''[[IEEE Spectrum]]'', Feb 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and have indicated that their proprietary technology [[Transhab#Multi-Layer Inflatable Shell|inflatable shell]], now in validation test in low-Earth orbit in two subscale spacecraft, incorporates a layer of [[Vectran]], along with the [[Kevlar]], etc. of the NASA technology.&lt;ref name=bbc20060714&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/5173388.stm Inflatable space module puffs up], Jonathan Fildes, BBC News, 14 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Its design is based on the cancelled NASA [[TransHab]] program. Bigelow gained access to TransHab engineers and workers,{{When|date=August 2009}} some of whom later went on to advise Bigelow's project.&lt;ref name="spacereview20060821"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/686/1 |title=Interview: TransHab developer William Schneider |work=TheSpaceReview.com |first=Dan |last=Schrimpsher |date=21 August 2006 |accessdate=3 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hobbyspace.com/AAdmin/archive/Interviews/Systems/ConstanceAdams.html |title=An Interview with Constance Adams |work=HobbySpace.com |date=30 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2010|12|30}}

The module follows the launch of two demonstration modules successfully tested in Earth orbit, ''[[Genesis I]]'' in 2006&lt;ref name="spacef1616"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.spacefellowship.com/news/art1616/launch-of-genesis-i-pathfinder-ushers-in-a-new-era-of-commercial-space-development.html |title=Launch of Genesis I Pathfinder Ushers in a New Era of Commercial Space Development |work=SpaceFellowship.com |first=Sigurd |last=De Keyser |date=15 July 2006 |accessdate=12 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Genesis II]]'' in 2007.

{{As of|2005}}, Bigelow Aerospace had plans to develop the ''[[CSS Skywalker]]'', a space station based upon using B330 modules to act as an orbital [[space tourism|hotel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2005-03/five-billion-star-hotel |title=The Five-Billion-Star Hotel |work=Popular Science |first=Michael |last=Belfiore |date=1 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Plans in 2010 continued to call for construction of a space station, but without the ''CSS Skywalker'' moniker, with "more usable volume than the existing [[International Space Station]]".&lt;ref name=te20100218/&gt; Those plans included a complex of two smaller ''[[Sundancer]]'' modules, a combined node and propulsion module and one full-size B330 in order to provide a total volume that was only somewhat less than that of the [[International Space Station]], though built from fewer and larger individual modules.&lt;ref name=baocc20100715/&gt;

In early 2010, Bigelow selected&lt;ref name=Orbitec_PR&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.orbitec.com/documents/ORBITEC_Bigelow_PressRelease_21Jan2010.pdf |title=Orbital Technologies Corporation (ORBITEC) Trusted by Bigelow Aerospace to Provide Environmental Control and Life Support (ECLSS) for Sundancer |publisher=Orbital Technologies Corporation |date=28 January 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719153443/http://www.orbitec.com/documents/ORBITEC_Bigelow_PressRelease_21Jan2010.pdf |archivedate=19 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orbitec as the supplier for [[Life support system|environmental control and life support systems]] (ECLSS).&lt;ref name=Orbitec_diagram&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://ww1.prweb.com/prfiles/2010/01/26/126204/humantrifoldfinal13Feb09noBleeds.pdf |title=Human Support Systems &amp; Instrumentation |publisher=Orbital Technologies Corporation |agency=PRweb.com |date=13 February 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927162225/http://ww1.prweb.com/prfiles/2010/01/26/126204/humantrifoldfinal13Feb09noBleeds.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{asof|2010|02}}, an initial launch of the B330 was slated to be no earlier than 2015, following a notional launch of the smaller ''Sundancer'' habitat in 2014.&lt;ref name=te20100218&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/15543675 |title=Moon dreams |work=[[The Economist]] |date=18 February 2010 |accessdate=22 February 2010 |quote="The current plan is to launch the first full-scale habitat (called Sundancer) in 2014. Further modules will be added to this over the course of a year, and the result will be a space station with more usable volume than the existing international one."}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, Bigelow announced that a B330 would be the sixth spacecraft component making up the notional [[Bigelow Commercial Space Station]].&lt;ref name=baocc20100715&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bigelowaerospace.com/orbital-complex-construction.php |title=Orbital Complex Construction |publisher=Bigelow Aerospace |date=10 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710092025/http://www.bigelowaerospace.com/orbital-complex-construction.php |archivedate=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Sundancer'' development was later halted, with a decision to move directly from the ''Genesis''-series prototypes to the B330.

{{asof|2013|11}}, Bigelow Aerospace indicated that the company has the financial capacity to produce at least two B330 habitats, along with a couple of [[space tug|transit tugs]] and a docking node if Bigelow is able to secure commercial customers to pay for approximately half of the launch costs for these systems.&lt;ref name=nsf20140214&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2014/02/bigelow-moon-property-create-lunar-industry/ |title=Bigelow: Moon Property rights would help create a lunar industry |work=[[NASASpaceFlight.com]] |last=Grondin |first=Yves |date=14 February 2014 |accessdate=16 February 2014 |quote="[Bigelow Aerospace] has the financial capacity to pay for at least two B330s habitats which should be ready by the end of 2016."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, some pricing and other lease details were made public.  The B330 lease rate will be {{USD|25 million}} for one-third of the station—{{convert|110|m3}}—for a 60-day lease and a round-trip [[space transport|taxi-seat]] to the B330 in [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) on a [[SpaceX]] [[Dragon V2]] was projected to be {{USD|26.5 million}} per seat.  At the time, Bigelow indicated that the habitat could be launch-ready by 2017.&lt;ref name=nsf20140207&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2014/02/affordable-habitats-more-buck-rogers-less-money-bigelow/ |title=Affordable habitats means more Buck Rogers for less money says Bigelow |work=[[NASASpaceFlight.com]] |last=Grondin |first=Yves |date=7 February 2014 |accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2014, Bigelow announced notional designs for two enhanced B330s,&lt;ref name=nsf20140207/&gt; but has explicitly stated that it would need to secure an anchor customer to go forward with building and launching any systems beyond low Earth orbit (BLEO).&lt;ref name=nsf20140214/&gt;

*B330-MDS for use on the surface of the Moon or other inner Solar System bodies.&lt;ref name=nsf20140207/&gt;

In April 2016, Bigelow signed an agreement with United Launch Alliance (ULA) to launch the first B330 module in 2020 using an [[Atlas V]] rocket.&lt;ref name="2020 Wall"/&gt; In October 2017, Bigelow and ULA announced they are working together to launch a B330 expandable module on ULA's [[Vulcan (rocket)|Vulcan]] launch vehicle.

'''Carlos Marcello''', also known as '''The Godfather''' and '''"The Little Man"''' (February 6, 1910 &amp;ndash; March 2, 1993), was a powerful [[Italian-American]] [[mafiosi|mafioso]] who ruled the [[New Orleans crime family]] from 1947 until the late 1980s. [[G. Robert Blakey]] and other [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theorists]] have asserted that Marcello along with [[Santo Trafficante, Jr.]] and [[Sam Giancana]] masterminded the 1963 assassination of [[United States]] President [[John F. Kennedy]] in retaliation for federal prosecution that threatened their secret criminal organization's, increasingly profitable businesses and their multi-billion dollar international organized crime empires.&lt;ref&gt;Lamar Waldron, "The Hidden History of the JFK Assassination", (2013) and G. Robert Blakey and Richard N. Billings, "Fatal Hour: The Assassination of President Kennedy by Organized Crime" (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Born as Calogero Minacori (or Minacore) to [[Sicily#Demographics|Sicilian]] parents in [[La Goulette, Tunis]], [[French protectorate of Tunisia|French Tunisia]], Marcello was brought to the [[United States]] in 1911 and his family settled in a decaying plantation house near [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]] in [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana|Jefferson Parish]] in [[suburb]]an [[New Orleans]]. Young Marcello turned to [[petty crime]] in the [[French Quarter]]. He was later imprisoned for masterminding a crew of teenage [[gangsters]] who carried out [[armed robbery|armed robberies]] in the small towns surrounding New Orleans. At the time, local newspapers compared him to the character of [[Fagin]] from [[Charles Dickens]]' novel ''[[Oliver Twist]]''. This conviction was later overturned. However, the following year he was convicted of assault and robbery and was sentenced to the [[Louisiana State Penitentiary]] in [[West Feliciana Parish]] for nine years. He was released after five years.

In 1938, Marcello was arrested and charged with the sale of more than 10&amp;nbsp;kg (23 pounds) of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. Despite receiving another lengthy prison sentence and a $76,830 fine, Marcello served less than ten months and only paid a $400 fine thanks to a deal cut with former Gov Long. On his release from prison, Marcello became associated with [[Frank Costello]], the leader of the [[Genovese crime family]], in [[New York City]]. At the time, Costello was involved in transporting illegal [[slot machine]]s from New York City to New Orleans. Marcello provided the muscle and arranged for the machines to be placed in local businesses.

==Louisiana crime boss==
By the end of 1947, Marcello had taken control of Louisiana's [[illegal gambling]] network. He had also joined forces with New York Mob associate [[Meyer Lansky]] in order to skim money from some of the most important [[casino]]s in the New Orleans area. According to former members of the [[Chicago Outfit]], Marcello was also assigned a cut of the money skimmed from [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]] casinos, in exchange for providing "muscle" in [[Florida]] real estate deals. By this time, Marcello had been selected as "[[Crime boss|The Godfather]]" of the New Orleans Mafia, by the family's [[Caporegime|capos]] and the [[National Crime Syndicate]] after the deportation of [[Sylvestro Carolla|Sylvestro "Silver Dollar Sam" Carolla]] to [[Sicily]]. He held this position for the next thirty years. In a 1975 extortion trial, two witnesses described Marcello as  "The Godfather" of the New Orleans crime syndicate.&lt;ref&gt;"Marcello is tagged as 'Godfather'," ''[[Minden Press-Herald]]'', [[Minden, Louisiana|Minden]], [[Louisiana]], January 17, 1975, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcello appeared before the U.S. Senate's [[United States Senate Special Committee to Investigate Crime in Interstate Commerce|Kefauver Committee]] on organized crime on January 25, 1951.  He pleaded the Fifth Amendment 152 times.  The Committee called Marcello "one of the worst criminals in the country."&lt;ref&gt;Third Interim Report (Part B) Of The Special Committee To Investigate Organized Crime In Interstate Commerce; May 1, 1951 [http://www.onewal.com/kef/kef3b.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220085822/http://www.onewal.com/kef/kef3b.html# |date=2016-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcello continued the family's long-standing tradition of fierce independence from interference by [[mafiosi]] in other areas. He enacted a policy that forbade mafiosi from other families from visiting Louisiana without permission.

On March 24, 1959, Marcello appeared before the [[United States Senate]]'s [[United States Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management|McClellan Committee]] investigating [[organized crime]]. Serving as Chief Counsel to the committee was [[Robert F. Kennedy]]; his brother, [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[John F. Kennedy]], was a member of the committee. In response to committee questioning, Marcello invoked the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] and refused to answer any questions relating to his background, activities, and associates. From then on, Marcello became an avowed enemy of the Kennedys.&lt;ref&gt;Lamar Waldron, "The Hidden History of the JFK Assassination" (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecution==

On April 4, 1961, the U.S. Justice Department, under the direction of Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, apprehended Marcello as he made what he assumed was a routine visit to the immigration authorities in New Orleans, then deported him to [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=widIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QgANAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=carlos%20marcello%20deported%20guatemala&amp;pg=600%2C2332086 "Racketeer's deportation ruled valid"], [[Associated Press]] in ''[[Meriden Record]]'', May 20, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Drew Pearson (journalist)|Drew Pearson]], [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zz5SAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=HXkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=carlos%20marcello%20deported%20guatemala&amp;pg=4121%2C5224147 "JFK, Macmillan got along famously, finally"], ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'', April 10, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, he was back in New Orleans.  Thereafter, he successfully fought efforts by the government to deport him.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0UQlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=p6sFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=carlos%20marcello%20deported%20guatemala&amp;pg=4274%2C3095190 "Marcello: Underworld's man without a country"], [[Associated Press]] in ''[[Argus-Press|Owosso Argus-Press]]'', August 2, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times; March 3, 1993"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/03/us/carlos-marcello-83-reputed-crime-boss-in-new-orleans-area.html "Carlos Marcello, 83, Reputed Crime Boss In New Orleans Area"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 3, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; His immigration lawyer was Jack Wasserman.

In November 1963, Marcello was tried for "conspiracy to defraud the United States government by obtaining a false Guatemalan birth certificate" and "conspiracy to obstruct the United States government in the exercise of its right to deport Carlos Marcello."  He was acquitted later that month on both charges.  However, in October 1964, Marcello was charged with "conspiring to obstruct justice by fixing a juror [Rudolph Heitler] and seeking the murder of a government witness [Carl Noll]."  Marcello's attorney admitted Heitler had been bribed but said that there was no evidence to connect the bribe with Marcello.  Noll refused to testify against Marcello in the case. Marcello was acquitted of both charges.&lt;ref&gt;United States House Select Committee on Assassinations Report, Volume IX; Mary Ferrell Foundation [https://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=955&amp;search=marcello_went+on+trial+in+new+orleans#relPageId=82&amp;tab=page]&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In September 1966, 13 members of the New York, Louisiana and Florida crime families were arrested for "consorting with known criminals" at the La Stella Restaurant in [[Queens, New York]].  However, the charges were later dropped. Returning to New Orleans a few days later, Marcello was arrested for assaulting an FBI agent.  His first trial resulted in a hung jury, but he was retried and convicted.  He was sentenced to two years but served less than six months.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://jfkassassination.net/russ/jfkinfo/jfk9/hscv9e.htm Carlos Marcello jfkassassination.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223081255/http://jfkassassination.net/russ/jfkinfo/jfk9/hscv9e.htm |date=2011-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, Marcello, [[Aubrey W. Young]] (a former aide to [[Governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[John J. McKeithen]]), [[Charles E. Roemer, II]] (former commissioner of administration to Governor [[Edwin Edwards]]), and two other men were indicted in the [[U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana]] in New Orleans with [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]], [[racketeering]], and [[mail fraud|mail]] and [[wire fraud]] in a scheme to bribe state officials to give the five men multimillion-dollar [[insurance]] contracts.&lt;ref&gt;"Trial Opens in New Orleans For Reputed Mafia Leader" ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 31, 1981, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; The charges were the result of a [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] probe known as [[BriLab]].&lt;ref&gt;"Alleged Underworld Leader Is Assailed at Bribery Trial" ''The New York Times'', April 22, 1981, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; [[U.S. District Judge]] [[Morey Sear]] allowed the admission of secretly-recorded conversations that he said demonstrated [[Political corruption|corruption]] at the highest levels of state government.&lt;ref&gt;"U.S. to Play More Tapes at Louisiana Bribery Trial" ''The New York Times'', May 18, 1981, Section IV, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Marcello and Roemer were convicted, but Young and the two others were acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;"Ex-Louisiana Aide Acquitted in Bribery Trial" ''The New York Times'', July 8, 1981, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kennedy assassination==
In its 1978 investigation of the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]], the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] said that it recognized [[Jack Ruby]]'s murder of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] as a primary reason to suspect organized crime as possibly having involvement in the assassination.&lt;ref name="HCSA-IC"&gt;{{cite book |title=Report of the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives |url=https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/ |type= |edition= |series= |year=1979 |origyear= |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C.|pages=149, 171|chapter=I.C. The committee believes, on the basis of the evidence available to it, that President John F. Kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy. The committee was unable to identify the other gunmen or the extent of the conspiracy |chapterurl=https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/part-1c.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its investigation, the HSCA noted the presence of "credible associations relating both Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby to figures having a relationship, albeit tenuous, with Marcello's crime family or organization."&lt;ref name="HCSA-IC"/&gt; Their report stated: "The committee found that Marcello had the motive, means and opportunity to have President John F. Kennedy assassinated, though it was unable to establish direct evidence of Marcello's complicity."&lt;ref name="HCSA-IC"/&gt;

In their book, ''Fatal Hour: The Assassination of President Kennedy By Organized Crime'', authors Richard N. Billings and [[G. Robert Blakey]] (who was chief counsel of the House Select Committee on Assassinations and previously Special Attorney in the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section of the Criminal Division of the U.S. Department of Justice under Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy) conclude that President Kennedy's murder was planned and carried out by Marcello and consipirators. They claim that their book lays out evidence that has been corroborated by additional sources and official records released in subsequent years.&lt;ref&gt;Richard N. Billings and [[G. Robert Blakey]], ""Fatal Hour: The Assassination of President Kennedy By Organized Crime"" (1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1989 book, ''Mafia Kingfish: Carlos Marcello and the Assassination of John F. Kennedy'', author [[John H. Davis (author)|John H. Davis]] implicates Marcello in the assassination of Kennedy.&lt;ref name="Sachs"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sachs |first=Sylvia |date=January 10, 1990 |title='Mafia Kingfish' delves into Kennedy assassination |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19900109&amp;id=pZQcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=nGMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6931,3396470 |newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press |location=Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania |page=D8 |accessdate=December 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Davis, Oswald and Ruby had "strong ties" to Marcello.&lt;ref name="Sachs"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davis, John H. ''Mafia Kingfish: Carlos Marcello and the Assassination of John F. Kennedy''. New York: Signet, 1989. {{ISBN|0-07-015779-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis claims that Ruby ran Dallas businesses for Marcello lieutenant Joseph Campisi.&lt;ref name="Lamar Waldron 2013"&gt;Lamar Waldron, "The Hidden History of the JFK Assassination", (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1994 autobiography ''Mob Lawyer'', attorney [[Frank Ragano]] says that he relayed a message in 1963 from Teamsters Union leader Jimmy Hoffa to Marcello and [[Santo Trafficante, Jr.|Santo Trafficante]], the Mafia boss of [[Florida]], urging the two Mafia bosses to kill Kennedy.&lt;ref name="Noble"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Noble |first1=Holcomb B. |author-link1= |date=May 18, 1998 |title=Frank Ragano, 75, Lawyer for Mob and Hoffa |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/18/us/frank-ragano-75-lawyer-for-mob-and-hoffa.html |department= |newspaper=The New York Times |type= |series= |language= |volume= |issue= |others= |edition= |location= |publisher= |publication-date= |agency= |page= |accessdate=June 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ragano, Frank "''Mob Lawyer''". Random House Value Publishing, 1996. {{ISBN|978-0517167229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ragano later claimed that four days before Trafficante died, the mob boss described to Ragano how he and Marcello organized the murder of President Kennedy.&lt;ref name="Lamar Waldron 2013"/&gt;

In his 2013 book ''The Hidden History of the JFK Assassination'', [[Lamar Waldron]] claimed that Marcello masterminded the assassination of Kennedy.&lt;ref name="United Press International; November 17, 2013"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kreiter |first=Marcella S. |date=November 17, 2013 |title=The Issue: The Kennedy assassination -- did the mob do it? |url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2013/11/17/The-Issue-The-Kennedy-assassination-did-the-mob-do-it/41021384680600/ |newspaper=United Press International |agency=UPI |location= |access-date=December 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Waldron, Marcello admitted his involvement to two other inmates during a fit of rage in the prison yard at the [[Federal Correctional Institution, Texarkana|Federal Correctional Institution in Texarkana, Texas]].&lt;ref name="United Press International; November 17, 2013"/&gt; In his book, Waldron also presented the account of Marcello's prison cell mate, Jack Van Laningham, who claimed in 1985 that Marcello bragged to him that he had masterminded the Kennedy assassination, while planting red herrings to confuse the press and embarrass the FBI and CIA into suppressing evidence.&lt;ref name="Lamar Waldron 2013"/&gt; According to Waldron, Marcello arranged for two [[hit men]] to carry out the assassination after entering the United States from Canada and Europe, while setting up Oswald as the fall guy and ordering the subsequent murder of various conspirators and witnesses who risked turning informants, including mobsters [[Johnny Roselli]] and [[Sam Giancana]].&lt;ref name="NBC News; November 21, 2013"&gt;{{cite news |last=McClam |first=Erin |date=November 21, 2013 |title='So consequential an act': 50 years later, JFK conspiracy theories endure |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/other/so-consequential-act-50-years-later-jfk-conspiracy-theories-endure-f2D11612682 |newspaper=NBC News |location= |access-date=December 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Early in 1989, Marcello suffered a series of [[stroke]]s. In July, in a surprise move, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out his BriLab conviction. One judge denied this reversal, but his decision in turn was overruled. In October, after having served six years and six months of his sentence, Marcello was released, and the old don was finally returned into his family's care. "I'm retired," he told reporters. "I'm happy. Everybody's been nice to me."  He returned to his white marble, two-storey mansion overlooking a golf course in Metairie.

Here, he lived out the last years of his life, cared for by a group of nurses and watched over by his wife and family. Carlos Marcello died on March 2, 1993.&lt;ref name="New York Times; March 3, 1993"/&gt;

The New Orleans crime family frequently met at an Italian restaurant in the New Orleans suburb of [[Avondale, Louisiana|Avondale]], known as [[Mosca's]]. It is still in operation today by the Mosca family after renovations following [[Hurricane Katrina]].

==Pop culture==
In [[Bryce Zabel]]'s 2014 novel ''Surrounded by Enemies: A Breakpoint Novel'', in an alternative universe where President Kennedy survived the assassination, but agent [[Clint Hill (Secret Service)|Clint Hill]] and Texas Governor [[John Connally]] were killed, President Kennedy talked to his brother Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy]], discussing suspects, including Marcello. Codenamed "New Orleans", Marcello was said to have motive and resources to carry out the attack.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In the [[animal rights movement]], '''cruelty-free''' is a label for products or activities that do not harm or kill animals anywhere in the world. Products [[animal testing|tested on animals]] are not considered cruelty-free, since these tests are often painful and cause the suffering and death of millions of animals every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scu.edu/ethics/publications/iie/v1n3/cures.html | title=Of Cures and Creatures Great and Small | publisher=Santa Clara University | accessdate=22 December 2014 | first=Claire | last=Andre | first2=Manuel | last2=Velasquez}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Bayliss-reconstruction.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=photograph|Reconstruction of a 1903 demonstration by [[William Bayliss]], a physiologist at University College London, during which anti-vivisectionists said a dog was vivisected without anaesthetic.]]
The term cruelty-free was first used in this way by [[Muriel Dowding, Baroness Dowding|Lady Dowding]] who persuaded manufacturers of [[fake fur]]s to use the label ''Beauty Without Cruelty'' and went on to found the charity [[Beauty Without Cruelty]] in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Encyclopedia of animal rights and animal welfare | year=1998 |page=139 |isbn=978-0-313-29977-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was popularised in the US in the 1970s by [[Marcia Pearson]] who founded the group [[Fashion With Compassion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Ia5eZIlgLUC&amp;pg=PA123 |title=The Vegan Sourcebook |author=Joanne Stepaniak, Virginia Messina |chapter=The Body Beautiful |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-7373-0506-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campaigns ==
In 1957 [[Charles Hume]] and William Russell introduced the concept of the three R's in their book [[Principles of Humane Experimental Technique]]. These techniques to reduce animals used in tests and their suffering include: replacement (eliminate an animal test altogether), reduction (fewer animals used in test by using statistical analysis) and refinement (making tests less painful).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Balls|first=Michael|title=Replacement of animal procedures: alternatives in research, education and testing|journal=Laboratory Animals |date=7 January 1994|volume=28|issue=3|pages=193–211|pmid=7967458|doi=10.1258/002367794780681714}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 the [[Alternatives to animal testing|European Center for the Validation of Alternative Methods]] (ECVAM) was established "to promote the scientific and regulatory acceptance of alternative methods which are important to the biosciences and which reduce, refine or replace the use of laboratory animals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Curren|first=Roger|title=From inhumane to in vitro: The changing face of science.|journal=The Animals' Agenda|date=Nov–Dec 2000|volume=20|issue=6|page=22|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/215888290|accessdate=March 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the ECVAM's Scientific Advisory Committee approves a test it must be used under the [[Animal Protection Act]], which does not allow the use of animals when an alternative exists.

In 2012, [[British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection]] joined forces with [[New England Anti-Vivisection Society]] and the [[European Coalition to End Animal Experiments]] to create an international organization to campaign against [[animal testing]]. [[BUAV]] supporter [[Ricky Gervais]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | journal=[[Huffington Post]] | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/03/15/ricky-gervais-cruelty-free-international-cosmetic-tests-animals_n_1347035.html | title=Ricky Gervais Fronts Cruelty Free International Crusade To End Cosmetic Tests On Animals | author=Caroline Frost | date=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; announced the campaign—now considered a deciding factor in the European decision to ban [[animal testing]] for personal-care products. Although companies can still use [[animal testing]] in countries outside Europe (such as China, which requires animal testing on all imported cosmetics), the [[Leaping Bunny]] applies to a company's global market, and does not certify product that use animal testing anywhere in the world.

== Tests ==

Animals such as [[rabbit]]s, [[rat]]s, [[mice]], and [[guinea pig]]s are sometimes forced to eat or inhale substances, or have a [[cosmetics|cosmetic]] ingredient rubbed onto their shaved skin, eyes or ears every day for 28 or 90 days to see if they have an [[allergic reaction]]. Then they are killed and cut open to examine the effects the ingredient has on internal organs. These tests are also done with pregnant animals who, after much suffering, are killed along with the fetus. In more prolonged [[carcinogen]] tests, rats are force-fed a [[cosmetics|cosmetic]] ingredient over two years, monitored for [[cancer]], and then killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Animal Tests &amp; Alternatives|url=http://www.crueltyfreeinternational.org/en/the-issue/animal-tests-and-alternatives|publisher=Cruelty Free International|accessdate=March 30, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331094749/http://www.crueltyfreeinternational.org/en/the-issue/animal-tests-and-alternatives|archivedate=March 31, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|“Typically a young rabbit is tightly constrained in a box so that he is unable to move... Clips sometimes hold his eyelids open. Anesthesia is not generally administered. A researcher applies a concentrated substance to the outer layer of the eye and observes over a span days or weeks for responses such as blindness, bleeding, hemorrhaging and ulceration. At the end, the rabbits are generally killed.”|Megan Erin Gallagher&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gallagher|first=Megan Erin|title=Toxicity Testing Requirements, Methods and Proposed Alternatives|url=https://environs.law.ucdavis.edu/volumes/26/2/gallagher.pdf|year=2003|journal=[[Environs (journal)|Environs]]|volume=26|issue=2|page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

[[Primate]]s, [[dog]]s, such as the [[Beagle]], and [[cat]]s are used for invasive experimentation as well. Many laboratories use these species to test drugs, chemicals, and diseases, whether old or new.

== Alternatives ==
As technology developed, outdated [[animal testing]] is being replaced with quicker, cheaper and more accurate methods. Critics point out that humane alternatives can be slow to implement, costly, and test only one compound at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Curren|first=Roger|title=From inhumane to in vitro: The changing face of science.|journal=The Animals' Agenda|date=Nov–Dec 2000|volume=20|issue=6|page=22|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/215888290|accessdate=March 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatives have shown positive results. For example, ''reconstructed human epidermis''—which uses human skin donated from cosmetic surgery to replace the rabbit [[Draize test|Draize]] skin test—is more relevant to human reactions. Other methods replace the [[Draize]] eye test by using [[in vitro]] (test-tube) human tissue. Computer-based systems allow for isolation of a select tissue or organ to conduct tests in an extremely controlled environment. These tests not only reduce animal testing, but are more precise and accurate at protecting humans from toxic substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Curren|first=Roger|title=From inhumane to in vitro: The changing face of science.|journal=The Animals' Agenda|date=Nov–Dec 2000|volume=20|issue=6|page=22|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/215888290|accessdate=March 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another cruelty-free option is using ingredients that have already been established as safe, such as the 20,000 ingredients in the [[European Union]] database.

== Products ==
Companies now offer a wide range of cruelty-free products such as cosmetics, personal-care products, household cleaners, clothing, shoes, condoms (which are sometimes processed with casein), and candles (which usually use [[paraffin wax|paraffin]] or [[beeswax]]). Organizations such as [[PETA]], Choose Cruelty Free, Coalition for Consumer Information on Cosmetics, [[British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection]], and its offshoot organization [[Cruelty Free International]] have released lists of cruelty-free products and cruel products to boycott. Since the 1990s the [[Leaping Bunny]] has been the only international third-party cruelty-free certification program.

==Events==
''National Cruelty-Free Week'' is an event in the [[United Kingdom]] every year arranged by the [[BUAV]]. The 2006 event was from 17–23 July. Other, similar, events include: ''National Vegetarian Week'', ''UK Vegan Week'' and ''[[World Vegan Day]]'', which takes place each year on November 1.

== Criticisms ==
While some manufacturers have begun to label their products as “not tested on animals”, “we do not conduct [[animal testing]]”, “never tested on animals”, “against [[animal testing]]” or “cruelty-free”, these labels are confusing and potentially misleading, since there is no clear legal definition as to what they mean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Winders|first=Delcianna|title=Combining Reflexive Law and False Advertising Law to Standardize Cruelty-Free Labeling of Cosmetics|journal=N.Y.U. L. Rev.|year=2006|volume=81|page=454|url=http://simplelink.library.utoronto.ca/url.cfm/357021|accessdate=March 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

The '''Deutsche Tourenwagen Cup''' (formerly known as '''ADAC Procar Series''') is a yearly motorsport series in Germany and some surrounding countries. The series has been running since 1995.

==Current status==
Currently the DTC is the highest level of German motorsport that runs cars to the Super 2000 regulations used in [[World Touring Car Championship]] (WTCC). To fill up the grid, and to promote new, young drivers the few Super 2000 cars are joined by the less advanced Division 2 and 3 series (the Super 2000 cars being called Division 1), bringing up the total number of starting drivers to around 20 to 25. Division 1 also allows cars of [[British Touring Car Championship|BTCC]]-spec – the 2005 champion Mathias Schläppi won in a BTCC-built [[MG ZS]].

As of 2016 there are 3 different classes in the DTC
* Superproduction - 1.6 l, turbocharged cars up to 300 Bhp
* Production 1 - 1.6 l, turbocharged cars up to 230 Bhp
* Production 2 - 2.0 l, turbocharged cars up to 260 Bhp

==History==
The DTC have existed since 1995 as a championship for Super Production cars under the name DTC (Deutsche Tourenwagen Challenge). [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[Hotfiel Sport]] had an important presence in the early and middle parts of the history of the series with [[Thomas Klenke]] winning the championship in 2002. The series was called the DMSB Produktionswagen Meisterschaft in 2004 and raced in two rounds of the [[European Touring Car Championship]].

The 2005 season saw the introduction of Super 2000 rules for Division 1 and the series changed its name to the DMSB Produktionswagen Meisterschaft. Mathias Schläppi in a MG ZS for [[Maurer Motorsport]] was the undisputed champion, winning 12 out of 16 races. 2006 saw Maurer Motorsport swapping their MG's for [[Chevrolet]]'s and Mathias Schläppi for ex-BTCC driver [[Vincent Radermecker]]. Schläppi instead drove for the new TFS-Yaco team running [[Toyota Corolla]]s. Vincent Radermecker would win Maurer's second title while Schläppi was second in the championship.

While arguably having some talented drivers and teams such as Radermecker, Schläppi, Maurer Motorsport and so on the DTC is very minor compared to the immensely popular [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters|DTM]] series.

==Scoring system==

"'''Do-Wah-Doo'''" is a song by English [[indie pop]] singer-songwriter [[Kate Nash]], featured on her 2010 second album ''[[My Best Friend Is You]]'' (2010). Written by Nash and produced by [[Bernard Butler]], it was released as the [[lead single]] from the album on 12 April 2010, one week before the release of the album. "Do-Wah-Doo" was a moderate commercial success, reaching number 15 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] – a position exceeded only by her hit song "[[Foundations (song)|Foundations]]" in 2007.

==Background==
"Do-Wah-Doo" is said to be inspired by 1950s and 1960s [[girl groups]] such as [[The Ronettes]] and [[The Supremes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=18744 |title=Do Wah Doo by Kate Nash |publisher=Songfacts |accessdate=20 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and when asked about it by ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', Nash said the following:

{{cquote|The song's about one of my best friends from when I was younger. He totally betrayed me by hanging out with these enemies of mine - these perfect girls, who wore lip-gloss and talked about boys and were really annoying. He and I had grown up climbing trees, playing in the woods, and going on holiday together, so I thought he'd be cooler than that. But when he turned 15 years old he wanted a girlfriend. I was like, 'Well fine, I'll just pretend I don't give a shit even though I'll never ever forgive you, even when I'm 22 years old and writing a song about it.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.spin.com/2010/02/spincom-exclusive-kate-nashs-first-single/ |title=Kae Nash's first single |date=7 February 2010 |publisher=''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' |accessdate=11 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Critical reception==
Nick Levine of ''[[Digital Spy]]'' gave the song a positive review stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Three years later and she hasn't started singing like Kiri Te Kanawa, while her lyrics continue to dance a line between "admirably direct" and "downright bleedin' obvious". Still, there's no denying that 'Do Wah Doo' ushers in a subtle shift in direction for Nash without sacrificing the pop smarts that propped up Bricks. Produced by Bernard Butler, it's a girl-groupy pop nugget featuring lashings of surf guitar, some nice brassy bursts and a brain-invading "bum-bum-de-bum" hook. Will it win her any new fans? To be honest, it'll probably come down to how you feel about a girl-groupy pop nugget that rhymes "lady" and "shady"... wrapped up with the line: "Well, I think she's a bitch.{{rating|4|5}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/singlesreviews/a210437/kate-nash-do-wah-doo.html |title=Kate Nash: 'Do Wah Doo' - Music Review |publisher=Digital Spy |date=2010-03-25 |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Music video==
The [[music video]] for "Do-Wah-Doo", directed by Daniel Brereton,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Knight|first=David|title=Kate Nash’s Do Wah Doo by Daniel Brereton|publisher=PromoNews|date=25 March 2010|url=http://www.promonews.tv/2010/03/25/kate-nash%E2%80%99s-do-wah-doo-by-daniel-brereton/|accessdate=14 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329102546/http://www.promonews.tv/2010/03/25/kate-nash%E2%80%99s-do-wah-doo-by-daniel-brereton/|archivedate=29 March 2012|df=dmy-all}} For some reason MTV credits producer Rachel Dargavel as director. {{cite video|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/kate-nash/496456/do-wah-doo.jhtml#artist=2446216|title=Kate Nash - "Do Wah Doo"|publisher=MTV|date=24 March 2010|accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was filmed on 18 February 2010 at [[Brooklands Museum]], [[Surrey]], [[England]]. Nash said the following:

{{cquote|I shot the video for 'Do-Wah-Doo' last week on Thursday and it was so, so much fun! The best fun I ever had on a video shoot. It stars a lot of my wonderful friends who are pretty much amazing. I wrote the treatment almost a year ago. It’s a love story set on a plane in the late '50s. For some reason, the idea has always been in my head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.addictmusic.co.uk/news/kate-nash-announces-new-tour-and-makes-some-videos/ |title=Kate Nash Announces New Tour And Makes Some Videos |publisher=Addict Music |date=23 February 2010 |accessdate=26 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the video, Kate Nash is an airline stewardess, and is a rival to another stewardess (who is shown serving alcoholic drinks to the pilots) for the affections of a handsome male steward.  At the end of the video, whether due to air turbulence, or the drunkenness of the pilots, or the deliberate actions of the pilots, Nash is literally thrown into the arms of the steward by the motions of the plane.

The '''Harold Pinter Theatre''', formerly the '''Comedy Theatre''' until 2011,&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-14827867 "Harold Pinter has London theatre named after him"], ''BBC News'', 7 September 2011, accessed 8 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[West End theatre]], and opened on Panton Street in the [[City of Westminster]], on 15 October 1881, as the ''Royal Comedy Theatre''. It was designed by [[Thomas Verity]] and built in just six months in painted ([[stucco]]) stone and brick.&lt;ref name=EH&gt;[http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=1&amp;id=422997 English Heritage listing details] accessed 28 Apr 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1884 it was known as just the ''Comedy Theatre''. In the mid-1950s the theatre underwent major reconstruction and re-opened in December 1955; the auditorium remains essentially that of 1881, with three tiers of horseshoe-shaped balconies.&lt;ref name=EH/&gt;

==History==
In 1883, the successful operetta ''[[Falka]]'' had its London première at the theatre, and in 1885, ''[[Erminie]]'' did the same. The theatre's reputation grew through the [[First World War]] when [[Charles Blake Cochran]] and [[André Charlot]] presented their famous revue shows. Famous actors who appeared here include [[Henry Daniell]] who played John Carlton in ''Secrets'' in September 1929.

The theatre was notable for the role it played in overturning stage [[censorship]] by establishing the New Watergate Club in 1956, under producer Anthony Field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/projects/theatrearchive/field.html ''Interview with Anthony Field CBE'' 14 March, 2007(The Theatre Archive Project, British Library)] accessed 16 Oct 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Theatres Act 1843]] was still in force and required scripts to be submitted for approval by the [[Lord Chamberlain's Office]]. Formation of the club allowed plays that had been banned due to language or subject matter to be performed under "club" conditions.

Plays produced in this way included the UK premières of [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''[[A View from the Bridge]]'', [[Robert Woodruff Anderson|Robert Anderson]]'s ''[[Tea and Sympathy (play)|Tea and Sympathy]]'' and [[Tennessee Williams]]' ''[[Cat On A Hot Tin Roof]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sRhSED-Up1UC&amp;pg=PA205&amp;lpg=PA205&amp;dq=%22Watergate+Theatre%22+Buckingham&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eaRDMk4w-Y&amp;sig=KzLO538x3557sAVAaujeKe8nZqI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MMagU9PqHoXz0gWesYHoCw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Watergate&amp;f=false Paul Ibell. ''Theatreland: A Journey Through the Heart of London's Theatre''.] Bloomsbury Publishing, 2009: p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; The law was not revoked until 1968, but in the late 1950s there was a loosening of conditions in theatre censorship, the club was dissolved and [[Peter Shaffer]]'s ''[[Five Finger Exercise]]'' premièred to a public audience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atgtickets.com/information.aspx?VId=667&amp;cat=aboutus The Harold Pinter Theatre history] accessed 8 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre was [[listed building|Grade II listed]] by [[English Heritage]] in June 1972.

==Renaming==
On 7 September 2011 it was announced that the theatre's owner, [[Ambassador Theatre Group]] (ATG) would be renaming the ''Comedy Theatre'' to the ''Harold Pinter Theatre'' from Thursday 13 October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://officiallondontheatre.com/news/atg-renames-comedy-theatre-after-harold-pinter-117553/ ATG renames Comedy Theatre after Harold Pinter], ''Official London Theatre'', 7 September 2011, accessed 31 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Howard Panter]], Joint Chief Executive and Creative Director of ATG, told the [[BBC]]: "The work of [[Harold Pinter|Pinter]] has become an integral part of the history of the Comedy Theatre. The renaming of one of our most successful West End theatres is a fitting tribute to a man who made such a mark on British theatre and who, over his 50-year career, became recognised as one of the most influential modern British dramatists."&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

{{Hinduism}}
Hiranyakashyap (he was a great king ), "clothed in gold"; the name is said to depict one who is very much fond of wealth: ''hiranya'' "gold," ''kashipu'' "soft cushion") is an [[Asura|Native king]]  from the [[Puranic]] scriptures of [[Hinduism]]. Hiranyakashipu's Younger Brother, [[Hiranyaksha]] was slain by [[Varaha]], one of the  of [[Vishnu|king Vishnu]]. Angered by this, Hiranyakashyap decided to gain [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] powers by performing a penance for Lord [[Brahma]]. He was subsequently killed by the [[Narasimha]] Avatara of Lord [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 734|editor=K.S. Gautam|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; His tale depicts the futility of desiring power over others and the strength of God's protection over his fully surrendered devotees (in the case of his son [[Prahlada]]).
 
Hiranyakashipu, according to legend, was the king of the ''[[daityas]]'' and had earned a [[Blessing|boon]] from Brahma that made him virtually indestructible. He grew arrogant, thought he was God, and demanded that everyone worship only him.&lt;ref name=ht&gt;[http://www.hinduismtoday.com/pdf_downloads/pagers/Hindu-Festival_Holi_broadsheet-color.pdf Holi: Splashed with colors of friendship] Hinduism Today, Hawaii (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of Hiranyakashipu is in three parts. The first has to do with the curse of the [[Four Kumaras]] on the gatekeepers of [[Vaikuntha]], Jaya and Vijaya, which causes them to be born as the [[daityas]] Hiranyakashipu and Hiranyaksha. The second part deals with Hiranyakashipu's penance to propitiate Brahma and gain a boon from him. The final part deals with his efforts to kill his son [[Prahlada]] (a devotee of [[Vishnu]]) and his subsequent death at the hands of [[Narasimha]].

==Birth==
{{main|Jaya-Vijaya}}
According to a story from [[Bhagavata Purana]], Hiranyakashipu and Hiranyaksha are Vishnu's gatekeepers Jaya and Vijaya, born on earth as the result of a curse from the [[Four Kumaras]].
In ''[[Satya Yuga]]'', Hiranyakashipu and Hiranyaksha - together called the ''Hiranya''s - were born to [[Diti]] (daughter of [[Daksha|Daksha Prajapathi]]) and the sage [[Kashyapa]]. It is said that [[asura]]s were born to them as a result of their union at the time of dusk, which was said to be an inauspicious time for such a deed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Mani, Vettam|title = Puranic Encyclopaedia: A Comprehensive Dictionary With Special Reference to the Epic and Puranic Literature|publisher = Motilal Banarsidass|year = 1975|location = Delhi|isbn = 0-8426-0822-2|page = 314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Penance==
After Hiranyakashipu's younger Brother Hiranyaksha's death at the hands of the [[Varaha]] avatar of Vishnu, Hiranyakashipu comes to hate Vishnu. He decides to kill him by gaining mystical powers, which he believes [[Brahma]], the chief among the  [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]], will award to him if he undergoes many years of great austerity and [[penance]], just as Brahma awarded powers to other Rakshasas.

This initially seemed to work as planned, with Brahma becoming pleased by Hiranyakashipu's austerities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://srimadbhagavatam.com/7/4/1/en1 Bhag-P 7.4.1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926234834/http://srimadbhagavatam.com/7/4/1/en1 |date=26 September 2007 }} "Lord Brahma was very much satisfied by Hiranyakasipu's austerities, which were difficult to perform"&lt;/ref&gt; Brahma appears before Hiranyakashipu and offers him a boon of his choice. But when Hiranyakashipu asks for immortality, Brahma refuses. Hiranyakashipu then makes the following request: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
O my lord, O best of the givers of benediction, if you will kindly grant me the benediction I desire, please let me not meet death from any of the living entities created by you.

Grant me that I not die within any residence or outside any residence, during the daytime or at night, nor on the ground or in the sky. Grant me that my death not be brought by any being other than those created by you, nor by any weapon, nor by any human being or animal.

Grant me that I not meet the death from any entity, living or nonliving. Grant me, further, that I not be killed by any demigod or demon or by any great snake from the lower planets. Since no one can kill you in the battlefield, you have no competitor. Therefore, grant me the benediction that I too may have no rival. Give me sole lordship over all the living entities and presiding deities, and give me all the glories obtained by that position. Furthermore, give me all the mystic powers attained by long austerities and the practice of yoga, for these cannot be lost at any time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://srimadbhagavatam.com/7/3/en1 Bhag-P, Canto 7] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926234959/http://srimadbhagavatam.com/7/3/en1 |date=26 September 2007 }}  7.3.35–38&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other Puranas, many variations of the boon are given. The Shiva Purana mentions that Hiranyakashipu asked Brahma that he would be invulnerable to dry or wet weapons, thunderbolts, mountains, trees, missiles or any form of weapon. The Vayu Purana mentions that Hiranyakashipu asked to be so powerful, only Vishnu would slay him. Other variations include not being slain by any living being, not at daytime or nighttime and not above or below.

In section 14, the Anusasana Parva of the Mahabharata, the Sage Upamanyu briefly mentioned to Krishna that Hiranyakashipu also performed another penance to please Lord Shiva. Shiva granted Hiranyakashipu the boon that he would have unrivalled combat prowess, exceeding skill in the use of bow and other weapons as well as the powers of all the gods, including Indra, Yama, Kubera, Sūrya, Agni, Vayu, Soma and Varuna.

In consequence of these two boons, Hiranyakashipu become so mighty that he was able to shake the very Himalayas down to their roots. Ravana once tried to lift Hiranyakashipu's earrings but he was unable to do so because they were very heavy.

The Brahmanda Purana mentions that Hiranyakashipu ruled for 107,280,000 years.

==Prahlada and Narasimha==
[[File:God Narasimha.jpg|thumb|Hiranyakashipu wielding a mace against Narasimha]]

Whilst Hiranyakashipu is performing the penance to be granted this boon, [[Indra]] and the other [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]] attack his home,&lt;ref&gt;[http://srimadbhagavatam.com/7/7/6/en1 Bhag-P 7.7.6] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926235042/http://srimadbhagavatam.com/7/7/6/en1 |date=26 September 2007 }} "The victorious demigods plundered the palace of Hiranyakasipu, the King of the demons, and destroyed everything within it. Then Indra, King of heaven, arrested my mother, the Queen"&lt;/ref&gt; seizing the opportunity in his absence. At this point the [[rishi|divine sage]] [[Narada]] intervenes to protect Hiranyakashipu's wife Kayadhu,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://srimadbhagavatam.com/7/7/summary/en1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012063732/http://srimadbhagavatam.com/7/7/summary/en1 |archivedate=12 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }} "When Hiranyakasipu left his kingdom and went to the mountain known as Mandaracala to execute severe austerities, all the demons scattered. Hiranyakashipu's wife, Kayadhu, was pregnant at that time."&lt;/ref&gt; whom he describes as 'sinless'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://srimadbhagavatam.com/7/7/8/en1 Bhag-P 7.7.8] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926234945/http://srimadbhagavatam.com/7/7/8/en1 |date=26 September 2007 }} "Narada Muni said: O Indra, King of the demigods, this woman is certainly sinless. You should not drag her off in this merciless way. O greatly fortunate one, this chaste woman is the wife of another. You must immediately release her."&lt;/ref&gt; Narada takes Kayadhu into his care, and while she is under his guidance, her unborn child (Hiranyakashipu's son) [[Prahlada]] becomes affected by the transcendental instructions of the sage even in the womb. Later, growing as a child, Prahlada begins to show symptoms of Narada's prenatal training and gradually becomes recognised as a devoted follower of Vishnu, much to his father's disappointment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://srimadbhagavatam.com/7/8/6/en1 Bhag-P 7.8.6] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121208035748/http://srimadbhagavatam.com/7/8/6/en1 |date=8 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hiranyakashipu eventually becomes so angry and upset at his son's devotion to Vishnu (whom he sees as his mortal enemy) that he decides he must kill him&lt;ref&gt;[http://srimadbhagavatam.com/7/8/3-4/en1 Bhag-P 7.8.3–4] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926235015/http://srimadbhagavatam.com/7/8/3-4/en1 |date=26 September 2007 }} "Thus he finally decided to kill his son Prahlada. Hiranyakashipu was by nature very cruel, and feeling insulted, he began hissing like a snake trampled upon by someone's foot."&lt;/ref&gt; but each time he attempts to kill the boy, Prahlada is protected by Vishnu's mystical power. When asked, Prahlada refuses to acknowledge his father as the supreme lord of the universe and claims that Vishnu is all-pervading and [[omnipresent]]. To which Hiranyakashipu points to a nearby pillar and asks if 'his Vishnu' is in it:

&lt;blockquote&gt; "O most unfortunate Prahlada, you have always described a supreme being other than me, a supreme being who is above everything, who is the controller of everyone, and who is all-pervading. But where is He? If He is everywhere, then why is He not present before me in this pillar?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://srimadbhagavatam.com/7/8/12/en1 Bhag-P 7.8.12] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926130524/http://srimadbhagavatam.com/7/8/12/en1 |date=26 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:Vishnu narasimha.JPG|thumb|Vishnu as Narasimha kills Hiranyakashipu, stone sculpture from Halebidu, Karnataka]]
Prahlada then answers, ''He was, He is and He will be''.  (In an alternate version of the story, Prahlada answers ''He is in pillars, and he is in the least twig''.) Hiranyakashipu, unable to control his anger, smashes the pillar with his mace. A tumultuous sound is heard, and Vishnu in the form of [[Narasimha]] appears from the broken pillar and moves to attack Hiranyakashipu in defence of Prahlada.

Vishnu has chosen here to appear in the form of Narasimha in order to be able to kill Hiranyakashipu without violating the boon given by [[Brahma]]. Hiranyakashipu cannot be killed by human, deva or animal, but Narasimha is none of these, as he is a form of Vishnu (a deva) incarnate as part human, part animal. He comes upon Hiranyakashipu at twilight (when it is neither day nor night) on the threshold of a courtyard (neither indoors nor out), and puts the demon on his thighs (neither earth nor space). Using his nails (neither animate nor inanimate) as weapons, he disembowels and kills the demon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://srimadbhagavatam.com/7/8/29/en1 Bhag-P 7.8.29] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926235028/http://srimadbhagavatam.com/7/8/29/en1 |date=26 September 2007 }} "Lord Nrisimhadeva placed the demon on His lap, supporting him with His thighs, and in the doorway of the assembly hall the Lord very easily tore the demon to pieces with the nails of His hand."&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after Hiranyakashipu's death, none of the gods and demigods present are able to calm Narasimha's fury. So all the gods and goddesses call His consort, the goddess Lakshmi, but she is also unable to do so. Then, at the request of Brahma, Prahlada is presented to Narasimha, who is finally calmed by the prayers of his devotee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://srimadbhagavatam.com/7/9/en1 Bhag-P 7.9] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121208025259/http://srimadbhagavatam.com/7/9/en1 |date=8 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Holi==
{{See also|Holika|Holi}}
One of Hiranyakashipu's attempts to kill Prahlada was to have him sit on a burning [[pyre]] with his sister [[Holika]]. Holika had a special gift that prevented her from being harmed by fire. Prahlada chanted Vishnu's name and in the battle of good against evil, Holika was burnt down but nothing happened to Prahlad. The burning of Holika is celebrated in Hinduism as the festival of [[Holi]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiacelebrating.com/festivals/holi/holika-dahan/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.holifestival.org/legend-holika-prahlad.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Roman Colosseum With Moon.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Though in ruins, the [[Flavian Amphitheatre]], now known as the Colosseum, still stands today]]

The inaugural games were held, on the orders of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Titus]], to celebrate the completion in [[Anno Domini|AD]]&amp;nbsp;80 (81 according to some sources)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tribunesandtriumphs.org/colosseum/building-the-colosseum.htm&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Colosseum]], then known as the Flavian Amphitheatre ({{lang-la|Amphitheatrum Flavium}}). [[Vespasian]] began construction of the [[amphitheatre]] around AD&amp;nbsp;70 and it was completed by his son Titus who became emperor following Vespasian's death in AD&amp;nbsp;79. Titus' reign began with months of disasters &amp;ndash; including the eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]], a fire in Rome, and an outbreak of plague &amp;ndash; he inaugurated the completion of the structure with lavish games that lasted for more than one hundred days, perhaps in an attempt to appease the Roman public and the gods.

Little literary evidence survives of the activities of the gladiatorial training and fighting (''[[ludi]]''). They appear to have followed the standard format of the [[Roman games]]: animal entertainments in the morning session, followed by the executions of criminals around midday, with the afternoon session reserved for gladiatorial combats and recreations of famous battles. The animal entertainments, which featured creatures from throughout the [[Roman Empire]], included extravagant hunts and fights between different species. Animals also played a role in some executions which were staged as recreations of myths and historical events. Naval battles formed part of the spectacles but whether these took place in the amphitheatre or on a lake that had been specially constructed by [[Augustus]] is a topic of debate among historians.

Only three contemporary or near-contemporary accounts of the games survive. The works of [[Suetonius]] and [[Cassius Dio]] focus on major events, while [[Martial]] provides some fragments of information on individual entertainments and the only detailed record of a gladiatorial combat in the arena known to survive: the fight between [[Verus (gladiator)|Verus]] and [[Priscus (gladiator)|Priscus]].

==Background==

===Construction of the amphitheatre===
{{main|Colosseum}}

Construction of the Colosseum started under Vespasian in a low valley surrounded by the [[Caelian Hill|Caelian]], [[Esquiline Hill|Esquiline]] and [[Palatine Hill|Palatine]] hills. The site became available to [[Nero]] by the [[Great Fire of Rome]] in AD&amp;nbsp;64 and redeveloped for his personal enjoyment with the construction of a huge artificial lake in the [[Domus Aurea]], and a [[Colossus of Nero|colossal statue of himself]].&lt;ref name = "SN"/&gt;

Vespasian started his own redevelopment of the site around AD&amp;nbsp;70 to 72, possibly funding the construction with booty seized after the Roman victory in the [[First Jewish-Roman War]] in AD&amp;nbsp;70. The lake was in-filled and the site designated as the location for the Flavian Amphitheatre. Reverting the private use by Nero to a more popular social purpose of a colosseum raised Vespasian's popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; Gladiatorial schools (''ludi'') and other support buildings were later constructed within the former grounds of the Domus Aurea, much of which had been torn down.&lt;ref name="claridge"&gt;Claridge pp. 276–82&lt;/ref&gt;

Vespasian died just as the structure had reached the third story. Titus was able to finish construction within a year of Vespasian's death of the amphitheatre and the adjacent [[Thermae|public baths]] (which were to be called the [[Baths of Titus]]).&lt;ref name="claridge" /&gt;

===Reign of Titus===
{{main|Titus}}
By the time the amphitheatre was completed, Titus's short reign had already endured a series of disasters: two months after he had succeeded Vespasian, [[Mount Vesuvius]] had erupted, destroying [[Pompeii]], [[Herculaneum]], [[Stabiae]], and [[Oplontis]]; a fire had burned in the city of [[Rome]] for three days and three nights causing substantial damage and destroying the Temple of Jupiter that had recently been restored by Vespasian; and there had been an outbreak of [[Bubonic plague|plague]] which was said to be the worst the city had ever endured.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; To dedicate the amphitheatre and the baths, and probably in an attempt to mollify both the Roman public and the gods, Titus inaugurated the opening of the Colosseum with lavish games which lasted for more than a hundred days.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman pp. 49–51&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sources===
Little documentary evidence of the games remains; contemporary and near-contemporary writings mostly record the major details and concentrate on the opening days. The poet [[Martial]] gives the most complete and only truly contemporary account in the form of his ''De Spectaculis'' ("On the Spectacles"), a somewhat sycophantic series of [[epigram]]s detailing the individual events of the games as an illustration of Titus' power and benevolence. Much of the work is concerned with praising Titus, and there have been difficulties with authenticating, dating and translating various portions, but Martial does give details of events not covered by other sources and the only known surviving complete record of a [[gladiatorial combat]] in the arena.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Howell (1978) Introduction to the Penguin Classics edition of ''The Epigrams''&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Suetonius]] was born in about AD&amp;nbsp;70, and started writing around AD&amp;nbsp;100. He was a child at the time of the games, but it is possible that he was born and raised in Rome, so he may have witnessed the inaugural games first-hand. His ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|De Vita Caesarum]]'' (''Lives of the Caesars'', known also as ''The Twelve Caesars'' or ''Lives of the Twelve Caesars'') probably completed around AD&amp;nbsp;117 to 127, includes some detail on the opening days of the games. Later in his history of Titus he reveals further information about the games. Suetonius' histories of the early Caesars have been criticised for being based on rumour and gossip rather than accurate historical sources, and he often reports from sources which contradict each other without attempting to analyse their quality or accuracy. However, he is generally regarded as a thorough scholar and has been praised for his balanced treatment of his subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Grant (1979) Introduction to the Penguin Classics edition of ''The Twelve Caesars''&lt;/ref&gt;

The only other major source of information on the games is [[Cassius Dio]] who lived in the latter second and early third centuries. His ''History of Rome'' spans 80 books written in 22 years, but much of which are only fragments. He is noted for his attention to detail in administrative affairs, but for major events his writing can be merely impressionistic, with a greater emphasis put on his interpretation of the events' significance within the wider historical context rather than reporting details. His sources are varied: he relies on many of the major commentators but also seems to have paid close attention to public records. His account of the Titus games is not sourced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/Introduction*.html|author=Earnest Cary|year=1958|title=Introduction to the Loeb Classics edition of Dio's ''Roman History''|accessdate=30 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal entertainments==
Animal entertainments formed a central part of the games and normally took place in the morning. Dio says that over the course of the inaugural games upward of nine thousand tamed and wild animals were slain sometimes by women of no particular prominence.&lt;ref name="D25"&gt;{{cite web|work=Roman History|author=Cassius Dio|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/66*.html#25|title=LXVI 25|accessdate=30 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conflicts with the work of [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]] who wrote, in the later part of the fourth century, that 5,000 animals were slain during the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/eutropius/trans7.html#20|author=Eutropius|others=Translated and annotated by John Selby Watson|title=Abridgement of Roman History – Of Titus|date=1853 |accessdate=30 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dio and Martial record some of the animals that were exhibited. Dio notes a hunt involving [[Crane (bird)|crane]]s and another involving four elephants,&lt;ref name="D25" /&gt; and Martial mentions elephants, lions, leopards, at least one tiger, hares, pigs,{{Ref_label|A|a|none}} [[bull]]s, bears, wild boar, a rhinoceros, [[Bovid|buffalo]] and bison (most likely the [[wisent]]). Other exotic animals may have been used but are not mentioned; ostriches, camels and crocodiles were commonly used in the games.&lt;ref name="Jennison"&gt;Jennison pp. 41–64&lt;/ref&gt; Giraffes are unlikely to have been featured; [[Julius Caesar]] had brought a single giraffe to Rome in 46 BC. Another is not recorded in Europe until the [[Medici giraffe]] in 1486,&lt;ref&gt;Belozerskaya pp. 87–129&lt;/ref&gt; although they were first seen in Rome in 58 BC,&lt;ref name="Jennison" /&gt; and were impressive enough to be detailed in the games of [[Augustus]] and [[Commodus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Roman History|author=Cassius Dio|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/73*.html#9|title=LXXIII 9|accessdate=30 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is no mention of [[hippopotami]] at Titus' games.
[[Image:Bestiarii.jpg|thumb|right|This [[mosaic]] from Dar Buc Ammera villa (Zliten) and now in Jamahiriya Museum of Tripoli, Libya, depicts some of the entertainments that would have been offered at the games.]]

Martial reports a contest between an elephant and a bull, and the elephant, having won, knelt before Titus. This may have formed part of its training, but Martial attributed it to a spontaneous recognition of the Emperor's power.&lt;ref&gt;Martial ''De Spectaculis'' 20 (40)&lt;/ref&gt; He also mentions a bull enraged by fires in the amphitheatre being tossed around the arena before being killed by an elephant,&lt;ref&gt;Martial ''De Spectaculis'' 22 (19)&lt;/ref&gt; but there is nothing to indicate that these two epigrams are about the same events or repeated many times during the span of one hundred days of celebration.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman pp. 165–6&lt;/ref&gt;

From Martial's account it appears that some of the animals were would not react in the manner expected of them for the crowds which Martial commented on as an opportunity for Titus to exhibit his command of the beasts; the lions ignored their intended prey:{{Ref_label|B|b|none}}

{{quote|text=...Caesar's lions are won over by their prey and the hare plays safely in the massive jaws.&lt;ref&gt;Martial ''Epigrams'' 1.6 (41)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The rhinoceros, too, proved difficult to handle. It was initially paraded around the arena, but became infuriated and attacked a bull, to the apparent delight of the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;Martial ''De Spectaculis'' 11 (9)&lt;/ref&gt; Later, when it was supposed to fight, it had calmed down. Intended to face a company of men armed with spears and a host of other animals, it had to be goaded by "trembling trainers" until it would engage the other combatants:{{Ref_label|C|c|none}}

{{quote|text=...at length the fury we once knew returned. For with his double horn he tossed a heavy bear as a bull tosses dummies from his head to the stars. [With how sure a stroke does the strong hand of Carpophorus, still a youth, aim the Norcian spears!] He lifted two steers with his mobile neck, to him yielded the fierce buffalo and the bison. A panther fleeing before him ran headlong upon the spears.&lt;ref&gt;Martial ''De Spectaculis'' 26 (22+23)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Carpophorus was a skilled ''[[Bestiarii|bestiarius]]'', specializing in fighting animals in the arena, and is mentioned again by Martial, who compares him to [[Hercules]]&lt;ref&gt;Martial ''De Spectaculis'' 32 (27,28)&lt;/ref&gt; and praises his abilities in dispatching a bear, a leopard and a lion of "unprecedented size".&lt;ref&gt;Martial ''De Spectaculis'' 17 (15)&lt;/ref&gt; A frieze from the [[Temple of Vespasian and Titus]] (''Templum Divi Vespasiani'') in the [[Roman Forum]] shows events similar to those described by Martial. Two separate sets of decoration show a rhinoceros confronting a bull and a ''bestarius'', possibly Carpophorus, with a spear, facing a lion and a leopard.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman pp. 104–8&lt;/ref&gt; Carpophorus was not the only beast slayer worthy of mention: another of Martial's epigrams refers to a woman equalling Hercules's feat of slaying the [[Nemean Lion]].&lt;ref&gt;Martial ''De Spectaculis'' 8 (6b)&lt;/ref&gt;

While the trainers of the rhinoceros may have trembled in fear at the fate that awaited them if their animal failed to perform, and another trainer was savaged by his lion,&lt;ref&gt;Martial ''De Spectaculis'' 12 (10)&lt;/ref&gt; some were more successful. One trainer was noted for his tigress which, though tame enough to lick his hand, had torn a lion to pieces, "a novelty unknown in any times".&lt;ref&gt;Martial ''De Spectaculis'' 21 (18)&lt;/ref&gt; It also appears that the crowd was pleased when a bull (perhaps ridden by a ''bestarius'') was hoisted aloft in the arena, but Martial gives little clue as to the nature of this entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Martial ''De Spectaculis'' 18 (16) and 19 (16b)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Executions==
Executions were a common feature of the Roman games. They took place around midday as an interlude between the animal entertainments of the morning sessions and the gladiatorial combat in the afternoon. Although the executions were seen as symbolizing Rome's power, the higher classes normally took advantage of this interval to leave the arena to dine; the Emperor [[Claudius]] was criticised by some authors for not doing so,&lt;ref name="SC"&gt;Suetonius, ''De Vita Caesarum'', Life of Claudius&lt;/ref&gt; so it is unlikely that Titus would have watched this part of the show. The executions of deserters, prisoners-of-war, and criminals from the lower classes were normally crucifixions or ''[[damnatio ad bestias|damnationes ad bestias]]'' in which they would face wild animals. [[Scipio Aemilianus Africanus|Scipio Aemilianus]] had been the first to execute criminals in this way when he had deserters from his army exposed to wild beasts in 146 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Gabucci pp. 63–4&lt;/ref&gt; These executions often took the form of the re-creation of some tragic scene from history or mythology with the criminal cast in the role of the victim killed by wild beasts.  Martial records one such execution, a version of the mime ''Laureolus'' by Catullus,&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman pp. 192&amp;ndash;3 argues for identifying this mimographer Catullus with the poet [[Gaius Valerius Catullus]], but there is little evidence to firmly substantiate this view.&lt;/ref&gt; in which a notorious bandit was executed by crucifixion. For the games this was adapted as a version of the legend of [[Prometheus]], who each day would have his liver devoured by an [[eagle]]. The element of crucifixion from Catullus' mime remained, but a wild bear was substituted for the eagle from the Prometheus legend:&lt;ref&gt;Coleman pp. 81–5&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=As Prometheus, bound on a Scythian crag, fed the tireless bird with his too abundant breast, so did Laureolus, hanging on no sham cross, give his naked flesh to a Caledonian bear. His lacerated limbs lived on, dripping gore, and in all his body, body there was none. Finally he met with the punishment he deserved; the guilty wretch had plunged a sword into his father's throat or his master's, or in his madness had robbed a temple of its secret gold, or laid a cruel torch to Rome. The criminal had outdone the misdeeds of ancient story; in him, what had been a play became an execution.&lt;ref&gt;Martial ''De Spectaculis'' 9 (7)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another execution was staged as a cruel twist on the story of [[Orpheus]], who supposedly charmed the plants and flowers with his song after he lost [[Eurydice]]. In the version presented at the inaugural games, the tree and animals were charmed just as in the story, except for an "unappreciative" bear which tore the minstrel to pieces. It is likely that the harmless creatures were released first to give the impression of the story proceeding as planned before the bear was released to dispatch the unfortunate criminal forced into the role of Orpheus, whose probable restraint prevented him fleeing.&lt;ref&gt;Martial ''De Spectaculis'' 24 (21) and 25 (21b)&lt;/ref&gt; Ironic reinterpretations of the myths may have been popular:&lt;ref&gt;Bomgardner p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to Orpheus' failure to charm the beasts, Martial mentions "[[Daedalus]]" being torn apart by another bear, mocking him with the words "how you must wish you had your feathers now".&lt;ref&gt;Martial ''De Spectaculis'' 10 (8)&lt;/ref&gt;

Martial also suggests the rape of a woman by a bull in a re-creation of the myth of [[Pasiphaë]].&lt;ref&gt;Martial ''De Spectaculis'' 6 (5)&lt;/ref&gt; Nero had provided a similar entertainment at an event he had staged using an actor dressed in the costume of a bull,&lt;ref name="SN"&gt;Suetonius, ''De Vita Caesarum'', Life of Nero&lt;/ref&gt; though Martial claims that the act performed at the inaugural games was authentic.

==Combat, hunting and racing==
Dio, Suetonius and Martial all record ''[[naumachia]]e'', the commonly used Greek term for what the Romans also called ''navalia proelia'', re-creations of famous sea battles. While Dio claims that both the purpose-built ''naumachia'' of Augustus and the amphitheatre itself were flooded for two separate shows,&lt;ref name="D25" /&gt; Suetonius states only that the event took place on the old artificial lake (which would have been that of Augustus).&lt;ref name="S"&gt;Suetonius, ''De Vita Caesarum'', Life of Titus&lt;/ref&gt; Martial does not specify where the ''naumachiae'' took place, but he is clear that whatever location he is discussing could be flooded and drained at will:
[[Image:Naumachia2.gif|thumb|right|250px|''Naumachiae'' may have taken place in the amphitheatre, but staging them would have presented many technical difficulties.]]
[[Image:Gladiator Bronzemedaillon.jpg|thumb|250px|A depiction of the ''venatio'' on a bronze medallion; a hunter confronts a boar.]]
{{quote|text=If you are here from a distant land, a late spectator for whom this was the first day of the sacred show, let not the naval warfare deceive you with its ships, and the water like to a sea: here but lately was land. Don't you believe it? Watch while the waters weary Mars. But a short while hence you will be saying "But here lately was sea."&lt;ref&gt;Martial ''De Spectaculis'' 27 (24)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It appears it would have been difficult to flood the amphitheatre, but, because few records survive on the operation of the Colosseum, it is impossible to say for certain where the naval battles took place. Suetonius writes that Titus' brother and successor, [[Domitian]], staged sea-fights in the amphitheatre,&lt;ref name="SD"&gt;Suetonius, ''De Vita Caesarum'', Life of Domitian&lt;/ref&gt; but he had made alterations to the structure, which probably included adding the ''[[hypogeum]]''—a complex of underground passages that may have allowed the arena to be quickly flooded and emptied.&lt;ref&gt;Levick p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; While Suetonius only records that Titus' recreations of naval battles took place,&lt;ref name="S" /&gt; Dio gives some details:

{{quote|text=For Titus suddenly filled this same theatre with water and brought in horses and bulls and some other domesticated animals that had been taught to behave in the liquid element just as on land. He also brought in people on ships, who engaged in a sea-fight there, impersonating the Corcyreans and Corinthians; and others gave a similar exhibition outside the city in the grove of Gaius and Lucius, a place which Augustus had once excavated for this very purpose.&lt;ref name="D25" /&gt;}}

Both Dio and Suetonius agree that gladiatorial contests and a wild-beast hunt, the ''[[venatio]]'', also took place at the lake area, but they again disagree on the details. Dio states this took place on the first day, with the lake covered over with planking and wooden stands erected around it,&lt;ref name="D25" /&gt; while Suetonius says the events occurred in the basin after the water had been let out. Suetonius writes that 5,000 animals were killed there in a single day.&lt;ref name="S" /&gt; Although no record of the animals pursued in these hunts survives (Dio mentions hunts of cranes and elephants but does not give a location), larger exotic animals were popular, notably elephants, big cats and bears, though smaller game such as birds, rabbits and goats also featured.&lt;ref&gt;Kyle p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

Suetonius writes that when Domitian staged his games there were other entertainments aside from the "usual two-horse chariot races",&lt;ref name="SD" /&gt; which indicates these races probably formed part of Titus' games, and Dio tells us that there was a horse race on the second day though he gives no details of the type of race.

Only Dio's record extends to detail of the third day specifically, during which he says:

{{quote|text=…there was a naval battle between three thousand men, followed by an infantry battle. The "Athenians" conquered the "Syracusans" (these were the names the combatants used), made a landing on the islet and assaulted and captured a wall that had been constructed around the monument.&lt;ref name="D25" /&gt;}}

This may again suggest the amphitheatre was flooded, as the monument referred to could be an altar of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], or [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], or of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter Latiaris]] that may have been present in the centre of the arena,&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Smith in Smith pp. 82–90&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Pliny the Elder]] mentions a bridge in connection with the lake of Augustus, suggesting there may have been an island there as well.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny ''Natural History'' XVI (190, 200)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Verus and Priscus==
Details of most of the gladiatorial combats are not recorded. Suetonius writes that they were lavish and Dio that there were both single combats and fights between groups.&lt;ref name="D25" /&gt; One fight, between the gladiators [[Verus (gladiator)|Verus]] and [[Priscus (gladiator)|Priscus]], was recorded by Martial:

{{quote|text=While Priscus continued to draw out the contest, and Verus likewise, and for a long time the struggle was evenly balanced on both sides, discharge was demanded for the stout fighters with loud and frequent shouting; but Caesar obeyed his own law (the law was that once the palm had been set up the fight had to proceed until a finger was raised): he did as he was allowed, making frequent awards of plate. Still, a resolution was found for the contest, equal they fought, equal they yielded. To both Caesar awarded the wooden sword and the palm: thus courage and skill received their reward. This has happened under no emperor but you, Caesar: two men fought and two men won.&lt;ref&gt;Martial ''De Spectaculis'' 31 (29,27)&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Retiarius vs secutor from Borghese mosaic.jpg|thumb|Detail of the [[Borghese Collection|Borghese]] ''[[Gladiator Mosaic]]'', ca. 320.]]
As usual, the tone of the epigram is somewhat fawning toward his patron, Titus, but it gives more detail than any other account of the games. It seems to imply that a draw was uncommon in gladiatorial combat at this level, but that Titus eventually yielded to the wishes of the crowd, declared the match equal, and granted both men their freedom (with the traditional presentation of the wooden sword). The traditional way of acknowledging defeat was for the yielding gladiator to raise a finger (''ad digitum''), and it is possible that in this case both men raised their fingers, but Martial's emphasis here is on Titus' even-handedness and generosity in granting a reprieve (''missio'') to the crowd's two favourites.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; His reference to this only happening under Titus probably alludes to the declaration of both as victors, as there is evidence that neither ties nor the survival of both gladiators in a contest were uncommon: it was expensive to train and keep a gladiator and they were not despatched lightly.&lt;ref&gt;Kyle p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence for the existence of both Priscus and Verus, at least as names of gladiators, outside of Martial's account. A first-century graveyard in [[Smyrna]] contains the grave of a gladiator named Priscus, and Verus' name is etched on a marble slab from [[Ferentinum]], recording a gladiatorial contest. The details of Verus' fights are unfortunately not legible. While neither of these may be the Priscus and Verus mentioned by Martial they do attest to the use of these names by gladiators.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;

Martial's mention of gift-giving is repeated in the account by Dio, who says that Titus would throw wooden balls into the crowd from his seat in the box at the north end of the arena. These balls were inscribed with a description of a gift, either food, clothing, slaves, pack animals, horse, cattle, or gold or silver vessels. Anybody who caught one could hand over the ball to an official who would provide the named gift in return.&lt;ref name="D25" /&gt; This was not unusual: Suetonius mentions that Nero did the same, giving 1,000 birds daily, as well as food parcels, and vouchers for various extravagant gifts.&lt;ref name="SN" /&gt;

[[Image:Greek pottery 2.jpg|thumb|Pottery fragment depicting the ''Thraex'' or Thracian gladiator ''(left)'', fighting a ''[[hoplomachus]]''.]]

==Later events==
Some of Suetonius' other comments on Titus' reign mention the baths and events in the amphitheatre.&lt;ref name="S" /&gt; Since Titus did not survive long after the end of the opening games, it is likely that these events took place during the days of the inauguration. Suetonius says that Titus promised for one day to forgo his own preferences and allow the crowd to decide the fate of the gladiators competing in the arena. He admired the [[Thraex|Thracian]] gladiators,{{Ref_label|D|d|none}} and while arguing passionately with the crowd on the subject, did not let his preferences sway him from his promise. He had some informers and their managers whipped and paraded in the arena. Some were sold as slaves in an auction and others sent away to "the most forbidding islands".&lt;ref name="S" /&gt; Suetonius also records that Titus invited some [[Roman Senate|senator]]s, whom he had pardoned for plotting against him, to sit with him during one of the days of the games, and to inspect the swords of the gladiators,&lt;ref name="S" /&gt; a statement that is reinforced to some degree by Dio who remarks that Titus had no senators put to death during his reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Roman History|author=Cassius Dio|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/66*.html#19|title=LXVI 19|accessdate=30 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the last day of the games, Titus wept openly in view of the public in the amphitheatre. According to Dio, Titus died the following day, after officially dedicating the amphitheatre and the baths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Roman History|author=Cassius Dio|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/66*.html#26|title=LXVI 26|accessdate=30 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suetonius says that he had set out for the [[Sabine]] territories after the games but collapsed and died at the first posting station.&lt;ref name="S" /&gt;

==Notes==
{{refbegin}}
'''a.''' {{Note_label|A|a|none}} In Epigram 14 (12) Martial says that a pregnant sow was speared through the stomach and a live piglet emerged.

'''b.''' {{Note_label|B|b|none}} In Epigram 33 Martial repeats his claim that the animals obey the Emperor. When a doe being chased by Molosian hounds kneels in front of him and is not attacked by the pursuing dogs, Martial says she and the dogs can sense Caesar's aura of power. Unfortunately the date of this epigram is in doubt, so "Caesar" could refer to either Titus or Domitian.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;

'''c.''' {{Note_label|C|c|none}} The mention of a "double horn" confirms that the rhinoceros was one of the African species: the [[White Rhinoceros]] or the [[Black Rhinoceros]].

'''d.''' {{Note_label|D|d|none}} The gladiators were described by their weaponry rather than their nationality, thus the "Thracian" gladiators that Titus admired may not have been from [[Thrace]]. Thracian gladiators carried small round shields and curved daggers.

'''International Day to End Violence Against Sex Workers''' is observed annually on December 17 by [[sex worker]]s, their advocates, friends, families and allies. Originally conceived as a [[memorial]] and [[vigil]] for the victims of the [[Green River Killer]] in [[Seattle]] [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], United States (US), it has evolved into an annual international event. The day calls attention to [[hate crimes]] committed against sex workers worldwide, as well as the need to remove the [[social stigma]] and [[discrimination]] that have contributed to violence against sex workers and indifference from the communities they are part of. Sex worker activists also state that custom and prohibitionist laws perpetuate such violence.

==Background==
First observed in 2003,&lt;ref name="Press"&gt;{{cite web|title=Candlelight Vigil Calls for an End to Violence Against Sex Workers International Memorial Day Focuses Attention on Violence Against Sex Workers|url=http://www.sexworkersproject.org/releases/PressRelease20031210.html|work=Urban Justice Center|publisher=Sex Workers Project|accessdate=16 December 2013|author=Susan Blake|format=PDF|date=17 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; the International Day to End Violence Against Sex Workers was founded by [[Annie Sprinkle|Dr. Annie Sprinkle]] and the [[Sex Workers Outreach Project USA|Sex Workers Outreach Project USA (SWOP-USA)]],&lt;ref name="Press" /&gt; an American [[sex worker rights]] organization. In a public letter, Sprinkle states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Violent crimes against sex workers go underreported, unaddressed and unpunished. There really are people who don't care when prostitutes are victims of hate crimes, beaten, raped, and murdered. No matter what you think about sex workers and the politics surrounding them, sex workers are a part of our neighborhoods, communities and families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A public letter from Annie Sprinkle|url=http://www.december17.org/about/from-annie-sprinkle/|work=December17.org|publisher=December17.org|accessdate=16 December 2013|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:Dec17 RedUmbrella.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Logo of the International Day to End Violence Against Sex Workers]]

==Red umbrella symbol==
The red umbrella is an important symbol for sex worker rights and is used for events that are held on December 17. The red umbrella symbol was first used by sex workers in [[Venice]], Italy in 2001. Slovenian artist Tadej Pogacar collaborated with sex workers to create the "Prostitute Pavilion" and  CODE: RED art installation for the 49th [[Venice Biennale]] of Art. Sex workers also held a street demonstration, the Red Umbrellas March, to protest inhumane work conditions and human rights abuses.&lt;ref name="Red"&gt;{{cite web|title=Under the Red Umbrella|url=http://www.sexworkeurope.org/campaigns/red-umbrella-campaigns|work=Intl. Committee on the Rights of Sex Workers in Europe (ICRSE)|publisher=Intl. Committee on the Rights of Sex Workers in Europe (ICRSE)|accessdate=22 December 2013|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Committee on the Rights of Sex Workers in Europe (ICRSE) adopted the red umbrella as a symbol of resistance to discrimination in 2005. A corresponding march was organised as the closing event to the European Conference on Sex Work, Human Rights, Labour and Migration conference, held in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], at which almost 200 participants appeared.&lt;ref name="Red" /&gt;

'''Iran Insurance embezzlement case''' refers to an [[embezzlement]] in government-owned [[Iran Insurance Company]], publicized in November 2010. Key figures behind the corruption were a group of [[Government of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (2005–13)|Mahmoud Ahmadinejad Cabinet]]'s statesmen known as "[[Fatemi Circle]]". The case was controversially appealed at the same time with [[2011 Iranian embezzlement scandal]].&lt;ref name="Khabar Online"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7075">This is a list of people who have been official '''Guests of Honor at the World Science Fiction Convention''', since the first [[Worldcon]] in 1939.

Each Worldcon committee selects the [[Science fiction convention#Guests of Honor|Guests of Honor]] (often just "GoH" in publications) for the convention. Typical categories are Author (or "Writer" or just "Pro"), Fan, Artist, Editor and Media, (though some Worldcon GoH slates are not categorised, reflecting that some honorees have contributed in more than one aspect of the genre and that the honor is equal across all those selected). While other conventions may select guests on the basis of popularity, Worldcons usually select Guests of Honor as an acknowledgement of significant lifetime contribution to the field; typically at least 25 years of activity. Selection as a Worldcon GoH is treated by authors, fans, and others in the SF field as a [[lifetime achievement award]].

'''Lucy Lambert Hale''' (January 1, 1841 – October 15, 1915) was the daughter of [[United States Senator|U.S. Senator]] [[John Parker Hale]] of [[New Hampshire]], and was a noted [[Washington, DC]], society ''belle''. She attracted many admirers including [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]], [[Robert Todd Lincoln]]; and [[stage actor]] and [[List of United States presidential assassination attempts and plots|presidential assassin]] [[John Wilkes Booth]], to whom she was secretly engaged. Lucy's photograph was found in Booth's pocket after he was killed by Federal troops, twelve days after he assassinated [[Abraham Lincoln]].&lt;ref name="AHM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1970/6/1970_6_12.shtml |title=They All Loved Lucy |last=Morcom |first=Richmond |volume=21 |issue=6 |date=October 1970 |accessdate=2010-05-10 |publisher=American History Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hale later went on to marry [[William E. Chandler]], a future [[United States Senator]] and [[United States Secretary of the Navy]].&lt;ref name="AHM"/&gt;

== Early years ==
She was born on January 1, 1841 in [[Dover, New Hampshire]], the second eldest daughter of U.S. Senator John Parker Hale and Lucy Hill Lambert, daughter of William Thomas Lambert and Abigail Ricker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Genealogical and Family History of the State of New Hampshire: A Record of the Achievements of Her People in the Making of a Commonwealth and the Founding of a Nation, Volume 3|year=1908|publisher=Lewis Publishing Company|page=1049|editor1=Stearns, Ezra S. |editor2=Whitcher, William Frederick |editor3=Parker, Edward Everett }}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was described as "pretty, precocious, sweet and good".&lt;ref name="AHM"/&gt; At the age of 12, she was receiving poems from a [[Harvard University]] student by the name of William Chandler. He was the first of her many romantic conquests, which also included Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. whom she met on vacation in Maine and with whom she began a romantic correspondence in 1858 when she was 17 years old. At that time, she was described as having had "dark hair, blue eyes, a clear skin, and a stunning figure".&lt;ref name="AHM"/&gt; Her manner toward men was a "subtle brew of flattery, teasing and cajoling; of rapt attention laced with a hints of indifference and occasionally a touch of cruelty".&lt;ref name="AHM"/&gt; She was shortly afterwards enrolled at a boarding school in [[Boston]].

Another of her admirers was [[Robert Todd Lincoln]], eldest son of the future American president Abraham Lincoln. Her father had entertained the hope that Lucy would marry Robert; and although Senator Hale's wishes did not come to fruition, the couple would remain good friends for many years.&lt;ref name="AHM"/&gt;

==Relationship with John Wilkes Booth==
[[File:John Wilkes Booth-portrait.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Wilkes Booth]], actor and assassin of President [[Abraham Lincoln]], was Hale's secret fiancé]]

When the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] broke out in April 1861, she, her parents, and her sister Elizabeth went to live at the [[National Hotel (Washington, D.C.)|National Hotel]] in Washington, D.C., and she began working for the [[U.S. Sanitary Commission|Sanitation Committee]]. She was seen at many parties, dances, and social functions and was one of the ''belles'' of Washington society. She and her mother also visited the soldiers at the front lines when there was a cessation of fighting.&lt;ref name="AHM"/&gt;

On [[Valentine's Day]], 1862, she received an anonymous note from [[John Wilkes Booth]], a wildly popular stage actor and notorious ladies man, in which he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;My dear Miss Hale, were it not for the ''License'' with a time-honored observance of ''this'' day allows, I had not written you this poor note. ... You resemble in a most remarkable degree a lady, very dear to me, now dead and your close resemblance to her surprised me the first time I saw you. This must be my apology for any apparent rudeness noticeable. To see ''you'' has indeed afforded ''me'' a melancholy pleasure, if you can conceive of such, and should we never meet nor I see you again believe me, I shall always associate ''you'' in my memory, with her, who was very beautiful, and whose face, like your own I trust, was a faithful index of gentleness and amiability. With a Thousand kind wishes for your future happiness I am, to you,&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A Stranger.&lt;ref name="AHM"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His courtship of Hale was conducted with much secrecy, but by early 1865, they were often seen together in public, and became clandestinely engaged. On March 4, 1865, Booth attended Lincoln's second [[Second inauguration of Abraham Lincoln|presidential inauguration]] with a ticket that Lucy had procured through her father. On March 17, his mother, [[Junius Brutus Booth|Mary Ann]] wrote Booth:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The secret you have told me is not exactly a secret as Edwin (Booth's brother) was told by someone, you were paying  great attention to a young lady in Washington, and if the lady in question is all you desire- I see no cause why you should not try to secure her. ... Her father ... would he give his consent?&lt;ref name="AHM"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By this time, Booth was already heavily involved in his plan to kidnap President Lincoln, which miscarried and evolved into the assassination plot. There was no reason to suspect that Hale knew anything of the plot to kill the president, nor was she aware of the deep antipathy her fiancé felt towards Lincoln.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dorothy Kunhardt|Kunhardt, Dorothy Meserve]] and Kunhardt, Philip Jr. (1993). ''Twenty Days''. North Hollywood, Calif.: Castle Books, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; Hale's father was an outspoken [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]]. Hale and Booth had begun to quarrel during this time, according to Booth's sister [[Asia Booth|Asia]] who later reported that Booth had become enraged when he saw Hale dancing with the President's son and her erstwhile admirer, Robert Todd Lincoln, one evening at the National Hotel.&lt;ref name="AHM"/&gt;

===Lincoln's assassination===
{{Main|Assassination of Abraham Lincoln}}
On the afternoon of April 14, Hale allegedly spent the afternoon studying [[Spanish language|Spanish]] with Robert Lincoln, and another former admirer, [[John Hay]], President Lincoln's assistant [[private secretary]]. Her father had just been appointed United States [[ambassador]] to Spain, and she and her mother were making preparations to accompany him to his new post. According to some witnesses, Booth and Hale had met that morning at the National Hotel and in the evening, Booth had dined with Hale and her mother; at 8.00 P.M, he allegedly looked at his watch, stood up and after taking her hand in his, recited some lines from [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'': "Nymph, in thy orisons (prayers), be all my sins remembered".&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seacoastnh.com/History/History-Matters/The-Elusive-Trail-of-Lucy-Hale/ |title=The Elusive Trail of Lucy Hale |last=Robinson |first=J. Dennis |year=2008 |accessdate=2010-05-10 |publisher=SeacoastNH.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Booth shot and mortally wounded President Lincoln that night at [[Ford's Theatre]], their romance came to an abrupt end. She was devastated by the news, and found it impossible to believe her fiancé had been the assassin. Several evenings prior to the assassination, Booth had taken her to a performance at Ford's.&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt; She wrote a letter to his brother, [[Edwin Booth|Edwin]], expressing her shock and sorrow, while her father published notices in the press denying there had ever been an "intimate connection" between his daughter and Booth.&lt;ref name="AHM"/&gt;

When Booth was later shot and killed on April 26, by pursuing [[Union (American Civil War)|Federal]] troops, five photographs of women were discovered in his pocket, and one of them was of Lucy. There were rumors that she had gone, heavily veiled, aboard the [[USS Montauk (1862)|USS ''Montauk'']] in the [[Washington Navy Yard]] to view the body of Booth which lay in one of the cabins, and upon seeing it, threw herself on him, sobbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v0cQfmktwqkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Good+Brother,+Bad+Brother:+The+Story+of+Edwin+Booth+and+John+Wilkes+Booth&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GloyQdpvcW&amp;sig=YI6gyyoNf0dg338TOZKWWVO_bRY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZZv5S8ugBcyd-gb02rm8CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Good Brother, Bad Brother: The Story of Edwin Booth and John Wilkes Booth |last=Giblin |first=James Cross|year=2005 |accessdate=2010-05-12 |page=155 |publisher=Clarion Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was not called by the [[Secretary of War]], [[Edwin Stanton]], to testify at the trial of Booth's co-conspirators.&lt;ref name="AHM"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Boo Morcom|Richmond Morcom]], Lucy was not called to testify because Stanton did not want to increase the reputation of the co-conspirators by revealing Booth's relationship with her.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and later life ==
In the wake of the assassination, Hale accompanied her parents to Spain, where her father took up his post as [[United States Ambassador to Spain]]. She remained in Europe for five years, during which time she received and refused many offers of marriage from titled aristocrats.&lt;ref name="AHM"/&gt; France, Italy, and Switzerland, were among the countries she visited; in [[Paris]] she attended the theatre with her former beaux Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., John Hay, and Frederick Anderson.

In 1870, she returned to America to care for her sick father, and renewed a correspondence with her first admirer, the successful corporation lawyer William E. Chandler, whose wife, Ann Gilmore had died. They were married in 1874 and in March 1875, her only son, [[John Parker Hale Chandler]], was born. In 1882, Hale's husband became Secretary of the Navy, and in 1887, a United States senator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grzyb|first=Frank L.|title=Hidden History of Rhode Island and the Civil War|year=2013|publisher=The History Press|isbn=1-626-19231-6|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She immersed herself in politics at her husband's side and was a successful hostess at the many social functions Chandler held in Washington.

==Death==
Hale died on October 15, 1915, and is buried at Pine Hill Cemetery in her hometown of Dover, New Hampshire.&lt;ref name=oreilly&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Reilly|first=Bill|title=Killing Lincoln: The Shocking Assassination that Changed America Forever|year=2011|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=1-429-99687-0|page=286|author2=Dugard, Martin }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zwicker|first=Roxie|title=New Hampshire Book of the Dead: Graveyard Legends and Lore|year=2012|publisher=The History Press|isbn=1-609-49756-2|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hale and Chandler's grandson, [[Theodore E.

He died the following day.

==Media portrayals==
Lucy Lambert Hale appeared as a character in the 1998 television film ''[[The Day Lincoln Was Shot]]''. She was portrayed by American actress [[Jean Louisa Kelly]], with [[Rob Morrow]] in the role of John Wilkes Booth.

'''Malcolm Oliver Perry II''' (September 3, 1929 &amp;ndash; December 5, 2009) was an [[United States|American]] [[physician]] and [[surgeon]]. Perry was one of the doctors who attended to [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] at [[Parkland Memorial Hospital]] in Dallas, Texas, on 22 November 1963 after Kennedy was shot. Two days later, he attended to Kennedy's alleged assassin [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] after he was shot.

==Biography==
Perry was born in [[Allen, Texas]] on September 3, 1929.&lt;ref name="The New York Times; December 7, 2009"&gt;{{cite news |last=Stout |first=David |author-link=David Stout |date=December 7, 2009 |title=M.O.

Following his school life in 1951 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]], Perry went to [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas|Southwestern Medical School]], becoming a [[Medical Doctor]] in 1955. Perry did his internship at [[Letterman Army Hospital|Letterman Hospital]] in [[San Francisco, California]], for a year, before joining the [[United States Air Force]] for two years. Perry was stationed at [[Spokane International Airport|Geiger Field]] in [[Spokane, Washington]]. 
{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Following his military duties, Perry worked at Parkland Memorial Hospital in [[Dallas, Texas]], for four years as a general surgical resident, although from September 1962 to September 1963, he traveled to the [[University of California at San Francisco]] to study [[vascular surgery]].  During that time, he became board certified by the [[American Board of Surgery]].
{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

When President Kennedy was shot on November 22, 1963, he was taken to Parkland Hospital. Perry was one of the doctors to attend to Kennedy, performing a [[tracheotomy]] over the small wound in Kennedy's throat. Perry also rendered aid to [[List of Governors of Texas|Texas Governor]] [[John Connally]], who was travelling in the car with Kennedy and was also shot.

Perry stated three times at a press conference later that day that Kennedy's neck wound appeared to be an entrance wound.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Although his statement appeared to be definitive, he had not intended it to be.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2209&amp;dat=19731119&amp;id=IqArAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XfwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6247,2559356&amp;hl=en&lt;/ref&gt; When interviewed by the [[Warren Commission]], Perry said that he then believed that a "full jacketed bullet without deformation passing through the skin would leave a similar wound for an exit and entrance wound and with the facts which you have made available and with these assumptions, I believe that it was an exit wound."

Following the shooting of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] by [[Jack Ruby]] on November 24, Perry was one of the doctors to tend to Oswald. Following Oswald's death, Perry made an effort to leave the Dallas area in order to avoid the many press conferences and press questions. Perry left for [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen]] in [[Hidalgo County, Texas|Hidalgo County]] in south Texas, the home of his [[mother-in-law]], but he was followed there by a reporter from [[United Press International]].  Subsequently, a news story was published about him in the ''[[New York Herald-Tribune]]''. Perry characterized the article as "overly dramatic, garish and in poor taste, and ethically damaging to me."

Perry rarely spoke about the events of November 22nd, saying that it was simply a terrible day and one he chose not to talk about again.

Perry later became chief of [[vascular surgery]] at [[New York-Presbyterian Hospital|Weill Cornell Medical Center]] in [[Manhattan]] from 1978 to 1988. He served as a professor in the Department of Surgery at [[Texas Tech University]] in [[Lubbock, Texas]] in the early 1990s. He was [[professor emeritus]] at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center until his death.

==Later life==
Perry lived in [[Jacksonville, Texas]].&lt;ref name="The New York Times; December 7, 2009"/&gt; He died from [[lung cancer]] in [[Tyler, Texas]] on December 5, 2009.&lt;ref name="The Washington Post; December 10, 2009"/&gt;

==Portrayals in film==
In the 2013 film ''[[Parkland (film)|Parkland]]'', Perry is portrayed by [[Colin Hanks]].

==Voting==
===Televoting===
After the juries had selected 5 songs for a "super final", it was revealed that the TV viewers would choose the winner by regional [[televoting]]. However, the voting became a bit repetitive, and televoting was not re-introduced until [[Melodifestivalen 1999|six years later]] when it was combined with regional juries.

Plans to build the house began after the [[Grand Opera House (Saint Paul, Minnesota)|Grand Opera House]] burned down on January 21, 1889. Initial plans for the house were designed by [[Leroy Buffington]], but his plans were abandoned due to insufficient funds. Business tycoon [[Robert Mannheimer]] eventually came to the rescue, providing half a million dollars towards the project. New plans by [[Charles A. Reed]] were used for the house which was built over a few months in 1890. The opera house opened for business that year and served as Saint Paul's opera venue until 1936.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uegmzT1auoQC&amp;pg=RA1-PA226&amp;lpg=RA1-PA226&amp;dq=St.+Paul+Metropolitan+Opera+House&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JxTiD7Z21E&amp;sig=IQQAyf6zlwaq5LqiEe3DCPtp0wU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pzdDStmZHIiwMMqzkasB&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1 Lost Twin Cities By Larry Millett at google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

The military conquests of the [[Ming dynasty]] were instrumental to the dynasty's hold on power during the early Ming.

==Hongwu reign (1368-1398)==
Early in his reign, [[Zhu Yuanzhang]], the first Ming emperor, laid down instructions to later generations that included advice to the Chief Military Commission on those countries that posed a threat to the Ming polity, and those that did not. He stated that those to the north were dangerous, while those to the south did not constitute a threat, and were not to be subject to attack. Yet, either despite this, or as a result of it, it was the polities to the south that suffered the greatest effects of Ming expansion over the following century.

===Conquest of Yunnan===
{{main|Ming conquest of Yunnan}}
[[File:Chinese Cannon.JPG|thumb|200px|A Chinese cannon, or eruptor, which fired proto-shells as cast iron bombs.]]

In 1369, not long after Zhu Yuanzhang founded his new dynasty, he sent proclamations for the instruction of the countries of [[Yunnan]] and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Wade, 2004, p. 4; also see [http://epress.nus.edu.sg/msl/entry/298?hl=%22Yun-nan%22 Southeast Asia in the Ming Shi-lu, 9 Mar 1369]&lt;/ref&gt; This early recognition of Yunnan (which lay beyond the Ming) as a "country" was to change very soon thereafter. By 1380, Yunnan, which was still held by a [[Mongolia|Mongol]] prince, was considered to belong to China since the [[Han dynasty]], and 250,000 troops were deployed in an attack on the polity, taking [[Dali, Yunnan|Dali]], [[Lijiang City|Lijiang]] and [[Lancang Lahu Autonomous County|Jinchi]] in 1382. As a result, the Ming founder took control of the major urban centres of the north-western part of what is today Yunnan, including several [[Tai languages|Tai]] areas.

By 1387, [[Hongwu Emperor|Ming Taizu]] had set his sights further and prepared for an attack on the Baiyi (Möng Mao) polity to the south. Under the commander Mu Ying, the Ming forces attacked the Baiyi with firearms, taking a claimed 30,000 heads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epress.nus.edu.sg/msl/entry/2876 Southeast Asia in the Ming Shilu, 6 May 1388]&lt;/ref&gt; Si Lunfa was subsequently dunned for all the costs of the military expedition against him, as a ''[[quid pro quo]]'' for recognising him as ruler of the Baiyi.

The new polities "created" (or recognised) in Yunnan under the first Ming ruler were known to the Ming as "native offices" (''tu si''), since initially they were usually left under the control of the hereditary rulers, by which the Ming exerted control, and engaged in economic expropriation through [[tribute]] demands and other [[Tax|levies]]. [[Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture|Che-li]] ([[Jinghong]]), for example, was established as a "native office" in 1377. Here, then, was the beginnings of the process by which formerly [[Southeast Asia]]n polities were gradually absorbed into the Chinese polity.

As a result, the new polities were subjected to a wide range of tribute demands, labour and other levies, including troop provision. As an example, in the case of the Tai-Mao polity of Lu-Chuan/Ping-Mian, the Ming court demanded 15,000 [[horse]]s, 500 [[elephant]]s and 30,000 [[cattle]] from the ruler Si Lunfa in 1397. Subsequently, large [[silver]] demands (silver, ''in lieu'' of labour) were levied on Lu-chuan. The annual amount of 6,900 ''liang'' of silver was initially set, and then it was almost tripled to 18,000 ''liang''. When it was realised that this was impossible to meet, the levy was reduced to the original amount. Other diverse levies were applied to the other polities, enforced through the use or threat of military force.

===Maritime policies===
The Hongwu reign was marked by frequent despatch of envoys to foreign polities, and the court reception of foreign envoys from the [[Maritime nation|maritime]] polities of [[Vietnam]], [[Champa]], [[Cambodia]], [[Thailand|Siam]], [[Cochin]], [[Sanfoqi]], [[Java (island)|Java]], Japan, [[Ryūkyū]], [[Brunei]], and [[Korea]]. They were drawn to China by the trade concessions available to tribute [[Envoy (title)|envoy]]s, and the rewards given to the rulers who submitted the "tribute". However, the machinations of the Ming state meant that diplomatic links were also a major method by which court insiders, within the system, could gain influence and control. It was the failure to report the arrival of an envoy from Champa that led to Hu Weiyong (胡惟庸), the Ming prime minister from 1377 to 1380, being executed on charges of [[treason]]. &lt;!--The possible involvement of Hu Weiyong in a wider range of unofficial links with the polities of Southeast Asia has already been discussed by Wolters.--&gt; Members of the Ming bureaucracy were likely already heavily involved in Southeast Asian maritime politics by the 1390s.

In the early 1370s, the coastal people in China were forbidden to cross the oceans, other than on official missions. [[Fujian]] military officials, who had privately sent people across the seas to engage in trade, were punished not long thereafter. The prohibition was reinstated in 1381 and 1384, and an imperial command "strictly prohibiting people from having contact with foreigners" was promulgated in 1390. The frequency of these prohibitions suggests that they were not very effective, and the reason given for the imperial command was that "at this time in [[Guangdong]]/[[Guangxi]], [[Zhejiang]] and Fujian, there were foolish people who did not know of these prohibitions, and frequently engaged in private trade with foreigners". The prohibition on going abroad to trade privately was reiterated in 1397. Whether these prohibitions actually affected maritime trade between southern China and Southeast Asia is not immediately apparent from the Ming texts, and perhaps through further [[Archaeological field survey#Research and planning|archaeological research]], it will be possible to piece together the ebbs and flows in maritime trade between China and Southeast Asia during this period.

==Yongle reign (1403-1424)==
Knowledge of the reign of Ming Taizu's successor, the Jianwen Emperor (1399&amp;ndash;1402), has been almost entirely lost to us as a result of the civil war and [[coup d'état]] launched by his uncle, [[Zhu Di]]. In the aftermath, Zhu Di tried to eliminate all evidence of his nephew's reign from the historical record. As such, the links between Ming China and Southeast Asia in this crucial period must remain in the realm of conjecture.

The period of Yongle, as Zhu Di was to name his reign, is however, very well-documented, and it is this period in which many of the most dramatic Ming interactions with Southeast Asia occurred. Like his father, after coming to power, Zhu Di ordered the Ministry of Rites to send demands to foreign polities, requiring them to bring tribute to court. In the same year, he also established the Maritime Trade Supervisorates in the provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian and Guangdong to control sea trade with all foreign polities. In 1405, hostels were established under each of the above-noted provinces to look after the foreign envoys who came from abroad. It was already apparent at this early stage of the reign that the Yongle Emperor was planning to have much to do with maritime Asia.

At the same time, the new emperor was also anxious to advertise the cultural superiority of the Ming to the rest of the known world and to this end, he distributed 10,000 copies of the ''[[Biographies of Exemplary Women]]'' (烈女傳) to various non-Chinese polities for their moral instruction. Whether any [[Motif (literature)|motif]]s from this Chinese text have appeared in Southeast Asian literature, has not yet, it appears, been studied. Court calendars were also distributed to Southeast Asian polities by the Ministry of Rites.

===Invasion of Vietnam=== 
{{Further|Ming–Hồ War|Fourth Chinese domination of Vietnam}}
A number of major military expeditions into Southeast Asia occurred during the Yongle reign. In 1406, in an effort to increase Ming influence and power in [[Đại Ngu]] ([[Vietnam]]), the country that was known to the Ming as Annam (the "Pacified South"), it had appeared that [[Hồ Quý Ly]], a powerful noble of Vietnam had seized power in Vietnam and attempted to murder all members of the current [[Trần dynasty|Trần]] ruling family. The Yongle emperor attempted to solve the problem peacefully, dispatching envoys and the self-claimed surviving member of the House of Trần, Trần Thiên Bính (陳添平) to Vietnam. He was assassinated and in that same year, two huge Chinese armies were sent along two routes, via Yunnan and Guangxi, into Đại Ngu. Chinese forces claimed that seven million Vietnamese were killed in this initial campaign to take the polity. In 1407, Đại Ngu became Ming China's 14th province, and remained so until 1428, when the Ming were forced to withdraw by a Vietnamese independence movement led by [[Lê Lợi]]. In contrast to the name [[Annam (Chinese province)|Annam]] ("Pacified South"), this 21-year period was one of almost incessant fighting.

[[File:Ming matchlocks.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ming-era [[matchlock]] firearms used in the 15th to 17th centuries.]]

As soon as the Ming forces took control of the polity, changes were instituted. In the first year, 7,600 tradesmen and [[artisan]]s (including gun founders) captured in Đại Ngu were sent to the Ming capital at today's [[Nanjing]]. This stripping of some of the most skilled members of society extensively affected Vietnamese society. Subsequently, more Chinese and non-Chinese troops were brought into the region to maintain some semblance of control, and a wide range of new organs of civil administration were re-established. By 1408, Annam had 41 [[subprefecture]]s, and 208 [[Counties of the People's Republic of China#History|counties]], all administered in a Chinese mode but often staffed by Vietnamese. Regardless of the extent to which political [[hegemony]] was thrown off in the late 1420s, when the Ming were driven out, the administrative legacy of the Chinese occupation must have had a major and wide-ranging impact on the society of the country. In a claimed effort to further inculcate Chinese ways, [[Confucianism|Confucian]] schools, which existed already from several hundred years before, were re-established in Chinese style, and Chinese were appointed to teach in them. In an attempt to assimilate the country into the Chinese cultural sphere, this period saw an invaluable part of Vietnamese academic and historical works destroyed by the Ming authorities.

In 1407 a new Maritime Trade Supervisorate was established at [[Vân Đồn|Yuntun]], while two new such offices were established at [[Quảng Bình|Xinping]] (新平) and [[Huế|Shunhua]] (順化) in 1408. Thus, within two years, three maritime trade supervisorates had been created in this new province, the same number as existed in the rest of China. This was a clear indication of the desire of the Ming to control maritime trade to the south and exploit the economic advantage of such control.

Other economic exploitation involved [[grain]] taxes, annual levies of [[lacquer]], [[sappanwood]], [[kingfisher]] feathers, fans and [[aromatics]], and the imposition of [[monopoly|monopolies]] on [[gold]], [[silver]], [[salt]], [[iron]], and [[fish]]. In addition, [[eunuch]]s were sent to Jiaozhi with the task of collecting treasure for the Emperor, but an equal amount of treasure collection appears to have been done for themselves. The rapaciousness of the eunuchs, at least as depicted in Ming accounts, was such that even the emperors intervened in appointments. The [[Hongxi Emperor]] objected to the re-sending of the eunuch Ma Qi to Annam, when he attempted to have himself reappointed to control the gold, silver, aromatics and [[pearl]]s of the region in 1424.

By 1414, the Ming was sufficiently well-entrenched in the northern Annam to allow it to push further, establishing four further subprefectures in a region south of Annam, which had formerly been administered by the [[Hồ dynasty]] and still free from Chinese influence, as well as some parts of northern border of [[Champa]]. There are authors who believe that the Chinese occupation of Ðại Việt in this period played some role in the later southward expansion of the Vietnamese state. However, the Vietnamese southward expansion had begun in the [[Lý dynasty]] of [[Ðại Việt]] and the major advances were made by [[Nguyễn Lords]] at least two centuries later. The levies and demands made on the new province by the Ming meant that its capacity to feed itself suffered. On numerous occasions in the 1420s, it was necessary to arrange transport of grain from Guangdong and Guangxi into Jiaozhi. Such deficiencies would have had profound effects on the social structure and social stability of the region, compounded by warfare and the imposition of Chinese norms. The range of colonial policies the Ming pursued had wide-ranging effects, both on the society at the time, as well as on the future development of the Vietnamese state.

===Conquest of Tai polities===
Prior to Yongle's invasion of Ðại Ngu in 1406, he engaged himself in further expansion into the polities of Yunnan. By 1403, he had created new military guards on the distant border, with two independent [[battalion]]s, directly under the Regional Military Commission, being established at [[Tengchong]] and [[Yongchang County|Yongchang]] in 1403. These were to be the bases from which the subsequent further occupation and control of the Tai regions was to be pursued. In the same year, new Chief's Offices were established in Yunnan, at [[Zhele Dian]], [[Dahou]], [[Ganyai]], [[Wandian]] and [[Lujiang County|Lujiang]], and in 1406, a further four Chief's Offices were established under Ningyuan Guard, in what is today [[Sip Song Chau Tai]] in [[Vietnam]]. When the Tai polities did not submit to the requirements of the new Ming emperor, military actions were launched against them. In 1405, for example, the senior Chinese representative in Yunnan, Mu Sheng, launched an attack on  [[Lanna]] (Babai).

After some sort of recognition or acceptance of the superior position of the Ming court, Chinese clerks or registry managers were appointed to the "native offices" to "assist" the traditional ruler, and ensure that Ming interests were served. Chinese clerks were appointed to carry out [[Chinese language]] duties in the native offices of Yunnan in 1404, while similar circulating-official clerk positions (to be filled by Chinese) were established in seven Chief's Offices in Yunnan in 1406. The "native office" polities were then subject to demands in terms of gold and silver ''in lieu'' of labour (差發銀/金), administered by the Ministry of Revenue, and were also required to provide troops to assist in further Ming campaigns. [[Mubang]], for example, was required to send its troops against Lanna (Babai) in 1406. This pattern of exploitation continued through the reign.

The '''Mystic Seaport Sea Music Festival''', held annually in June since 1979 at the [[Mystic Seaport Museum]] in Mystic, Connecticut, is among the oldest, and is the largest sea [[music festival]] in the United States.  It reportedly attracts "the highest caliber of sea music performers, scholars, and fans."&lt;ref&gt;Carr, J.. 2009. New Sea Chantey Compilations On Compact Disc.

'''Pentylenetetrazol''', also known as '''pentylenetetrazole''', '''metrazol''', '''pentetrazol''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]), '''pentamethylenetetrazol''', '''Corazol''', '''Cardiazol''', '''deumacard''' or '''PTZ''', is a drug formerly used as a circulatory and respiratory stimulant. High doses cause [[convulsions]], as discovered by the Hungarian-American neurologist and psychiatrist [[Ladislas J. Meduna]] in 1934. It has been used in [[convulsive therapy]], and was found to be effective—primarily for depression—but side-effects such as uncontrolled [[seizure]]s were difficult to avoid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Read |first1=Charles F. |title=Consequences of metrazol shock therapy |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=97 |issue=3 |year=1940 |pages=667–76 |doi=10.1176/ajp.97.3.667 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939 pentylenetetrazol was replaced by [[electroconvulsive therapy]], easier to administer,  as the preferred method for inducing seizures in England's mental hospitals.  In the US its approval by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] was revoked in 1982.&lt;ref name="sciam"&gt;{{ cite news | author = Minkel JR | title = Drug May Counteract Down Syndrome | url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/drug-may-counteract-down/ | newspaper = Scientific American | date = February 25, 2007 | accessdate = 2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used until recently in Italy as a cough suppressant.&lt;ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
The mechanism of pentylenetetrazol is not well understood, and it may have multiple mechanisms of action. In 1984, Squires et al. published a report analyzing pentylenetetrazol and several structurally related convulsant drugs. They found that ''in vivo'' convulsant potency was strongly correlated to ''in vitro'' affinity to the [[picrotoxin]] binding site on the GABA-A receptor complex. Many GABA-A ligands are effective [[anticonvulsants]], such as the sedatives [[diazepam]] and [[phenobarbital]], but presumably pentylenetetrazol has the opposite effect when it binds to the GABA-A receptor.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |vauthors=Squires RF, Saederup E, Crawley JN, Skolnick P, Paul SM | title = Convulsant potencies of tetrazoles are highly correlated with actions on GABA / benzodiazepine / picrotoxin receptor complexes in brain | journal = Life Sci. | year = 1984 | volume = 35 | issue = 14 | pages = 1439–44 | pmid = 6090836 | doi=10.1016/0024-3205(84)90159-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several studies have focused on the way pentylenetetrazol influences neuronal ion channels. A 1987 study found that pentylenetetrazol increases calcium influx and sodium influx, both of which depolarize the neuron. Because these effects were antagonized by calcium channel blockers, it was concluded that pentylenetetrazol acts at calcium channels, and it causes calcium channels to lose selectivity and conduct sodium ions as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |vauthors=Papp A, Fehér O, Erdélyi L | title = The ionic mechanism of the pentylenetetrazol convulsions | journal = Acta Biol. Hung. | year = 1987 | volume = 38 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 349–61 | pmid = 3503442 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===cAMP dependent mechanism===
One study assessed the effect of cAMP, its analogs and dependent protein kinase on pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure in vivo. The finding show that cAMP analog, as well as phosphodiesterase and protein kinase inhibitors affected the epileptogenic activity of pentylenetetrazole. This finding shows the involvement of cAMP, its downstream and upstream on pentylenetetrazole activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hosseini-Zare MS, Salehi F, Seyedi SY, Azami K, Ghadiri T, Mobasseri M, Gholizadeh S, Beyer C, Sharifzadeh M |title=Effects of pentoxifylline and H-89 on epileptogenic activity of bucladesine in pentylenetetrazol-treated mice |journal=European Journal of Pharmacology |volume=670 |issue=2–3 |pages=464–70 |year=2011 |pmid=21946102 |doi=10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.09.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Pentylenetetrazol has been used experimentally to study seizure phenomena and to identify pharmaceuticals that may control seizure susceptibility. Pentylenetetrazol is also a prototypical [[anxiogenic]] drug and, has been extensively utilized in animal models of [[anxiety]]. Pentylenetetrazol produces a reliable [[discriminative stimulus]] which is largely mediated by the [[GABA A receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;]] receptor. Several classes of compounds can modulate the pentylenetetrazol discriminative stimulus including [[5-HT1A|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[5-HT3|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[NMDA]], [[glycine]], and [[L-type calcium channel]] [[ligands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |vauthors=Jung ME, Lal H, Gatch MB | title = The discriminative stimulus effects of pentylenetetrazol as a model of anxiety: recent developments | journal = Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. | year = 2002 | volume = 26 | issue = 4 | pages = 429–39 | pmid = 12204190 | doi = 10.1016/S0149-7634(02)00010-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanford University researchers proposed PTZ as a candidate for pharmacological treatment of [[Down syndrome]]. A brief communication in the April 2007 issue of [[Nature Neuroscience]] outlined an experiment designed to test the underlying theory proposed to explain the purported efficacy of [[GABA A receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;]] antagonists in restoring the [[declarative memory]] deficits associated with the mouse model of human Down Syndrome. Ts65Dn mice injected with a 2-week regimen of either of  two compounds [[picrotoxin]] or [[bilobalide]] (both GABA antagonists) showed marked improvements in both exploration and recognition of novel objects over controls injected with only saline. These results were duplicated in a second experiment with mice fed either plain milk or a combination of milk and a non-epileptogenic dose of PTZ daily for 17 days.  PTZ-fed mice achieved novel object task scores comparable to wild-type (normal) mice. These improvements persisted at least 1 to 2 months after the treatment regimen. Not surprisingly these compounds' efficacies were accompanied by the normalization of [[long-term potentiation]] in the [[dentate gyrus]] one month after the end of treatment, further suggesting persistent drug-mediated improvements in learning and memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | vauthors = Fernandez F, Morishita W, Zuniga E, Nguyen J, Blank M, Malenka RC, Garner CC | title = Pharmacotherapy for cognitive impairment in a mouse model of Down syndrome | journal = Nat. Neurosci. | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 411–3 | year = 2007 | url = http://med.stanford.edu/nbc/articles/7%20-%20Pharmacotherapy%20for%20Cognitive%20Impairment%20in%20a%20Mouse%20Model%20of%20Down%20Syndrome.pdf | pmid = 17322876 | doi = 10.1038/nn1860 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110720045636/http://med.stanford.edu/nbc/articles/7%20-%20Pharmacotherapy%20for%20Cognitive%20Impairment%20in%20a%20Mouse%20Model%20of%20Down%20Syndrome.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-20 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The finding of pentylenetetrazol's effectiveness in treating a mouse model of Down syndrome has led to it being explored as a means of correcting other learning deficiencies.  Specifically, hamsters denied their natural [[circadian rhythm]] (though not denied sleep) had their memory restored to near-normal levels when treated with pentylenetetrazol.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |vauthors=Ruby NF, Hwang CE, Wessells C, Fernandez F, Zhang P, Sapolsky R, Heller HC | title = Hippocampal-dependent learning requires a functional circadian system | journal = PNAS USA | year = 2008 | volume = 105 | issue = 40 | pages = 15593–8 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0808259105 | pmid = 18832172 | pmc = 2563080 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study found that the [[Cannabinoid|phytocannabinoid]] [[Tetrahydrocannabinol|THC]] protect mice from more severe [[Cognition|cognitive]] deficits induced by pentylenetetrazole, and suggest that a pre- or post-conditioning treatment with extremely low doses of THC, several days before or after [[brain injury]], may provide safe and effective long-term [[neuroprotection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2011-06-20|title=Pre- and post-conditioning treatment with an ultra-low dose of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) protects against pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced cognitive damage|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166432811001094|journal=Behavioural Brain Research|language=en|volume=220|issue=1|pages=194–201|doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2011.02.005|pmid=21315768|issn=0166-4328|last1=Assaf|first1=Fadi|last2=Fishbein|first2=Miriam|last3=Gafni|first3=Mikhal|last4=Keren|first4=Ora|last5=Sarne|first5=Yosef}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mention in literature== 
[[Allen Ginsberg]] mentioned Metrazol in his poem "[[Kaddish (poem)|Kaddish]]": '' No love since Naomi screamed—since 1923?—now lost in Greystone ward—new shock for her—Electricity, following the 40 Insulin. And Metrazol had made her fat.''{{fact|date=April 2017}}

{{Repression in the Soviet Union}}

'''Purges of the Communist Party in the Soviet Union''' ({{lang-ru|"Чистка партийных рядов"}}, ''{{transl|ru|chistka partiynykh ryadov}}'', "cleansing of the party ranks") were a Soviet [[ritual]] in which periodic reviews of members of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] were conducted by other members and the security organs to get rid of "undesirables".&lt;ref&gt;Alex Inkeles and Raymond A. Bauer. ''The Soviet Citizen. Daily Life in a Totalitarian Society''. New-York, 1968 (1st published in 1959).&lt;/ref&gt;

In her book ''Everyday Stalinism'', [[Sheila Fitzpatrick]] says that such purges took place especially during the 1920s, a period of the young Soviet Union that she calls its "cultural revolution" (echoing the name of [[Cultural Revolution|the similar later period in China]]), "bringing excitement into the workday bureaucratic routine".&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, S. ''Everyday Stalinism''. Oxford University Press. New-York, 1999. page 20. {{ISBN|0195050010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such reviews would start with a short autobiography from the reviewed person and then interrogation of him or her by the purge commission as well as by the attending audience.

Although the term "purge" conjures [[Stalinism|Stalin's rule]] in many minds because the worst of the purges happened during that era, the [[Bolsheviks]] carried out their first major purge of the Party ranks as early as 1921. About 220,000 members were purged or left the party in 1921. The purge was justified{{by whom?|date=January 2018}} by the necessity to get rid of the members who had joined the party simply to be on the winning side. The major criteria were [[social class|social origins]] (members of [[working class]]es were normally accepted without question) and contributions to the revolutionary cause.

The first Party purge of the [[Joseph Stalin]] era took place in 1929&amp;ndash;1930 in accordance with a resolution of the [[16th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) | XVI Party Conference]]. Purges became deadly under Stalin. More than 10 percent of the party members were purged. At the same time,{{when?|date=January 2018}} a significant number of new members, industrial workers, joined the Party. Additionally, Stalin ordered {{ill|"Case Spring"|ru|Дело «Весна»}} - the repression and/or execution of officers of the [[Red Army]] who had served previously in the [[Russian Imperial Army]], of civilians who had been sympathetic to the [[White movement]], or of other subversives rounded up by the [[Joint_State_Political_Directorate|OGPU]]. Historians estimate that over 3,000 people were executed and that tens of thousands lost their positions and privileges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Jaroslav Tinchenko|title= Calvary Russian officers in the USSR. 1930-1931 years|url= http://www.xxl3.ru/krasnie/tinchenko/tinchenko.htm|ISBN= 5-89554-195-X| language = Russian |location= Moscow|publisher= Moscow Public Science Foundation|year= 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Stalin ordered the next systematic party purge in the Soviet Union in December 1932, to be performed during 1933. During this period, new memberships were suspended. A joint resolution of the Party [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] and Central Revision Committee specified the criteria for purging and called for setting up special Purge Commissions, to which every communist had to report. Furthermore, this purge concerned members of the Central Committee and of the [[Central Auditing Commission of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union | Central Revision Committee]], who previously had been immune to purges, because they were elected at [[Congress of the CPSU|Party Congress]]es. In particular, [[Nikolai Bukharin]], [[Alexei Ivanovich Rykov]], and [[Mikhail Tomsky]] had to try hard to defend themselves during this purge. At this time, of 1.9 million members, about 18 percent were purged.

The idea of party purges began innocently enough: between 1921 and 1933 in the Soviet Union, for example, some 800,000 people were purged or left the party, but most suffered no worse fate (although the ones that did became the first waves of the [[Gulag Archipelago]] system).&lt;ref name="Solzhenitsyn_1974"&gt;{{Citation |last=Solzhenitsyn |first=Aleksandr |year=1974 |title=The Gulag Archipelago [Архипела́г ГУЛА́Г] | translator-last=Whitney | translator-first=Thomas P. |volume=1 |publisher=Éditions du Seuil |location=Paris |isbn=0-06-013914-5 |oclc=802879 |lccn= |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; But from 1934 onwards, during the [[Great Purge]], the connotations of the term changed, because being expelled from the party came to mean almost certain arrest, with long imprisonment or execution following.&lt;ref name="Solzhenitsyn_1974"/&gt;

[[Sergey Kirov]], [[leader]] of the Leningrad section of the Communist party, was murdered in 1934. In response, Stalin's Great Purge saw one third of the Communist party executed or sentenced to work in labor camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/history/mwh/russia/stalinpurgesandpraisesrev1.shtml|title= BBC - GCSE Bitesize - Stalin - purges and praises|access-date= 2018-01-29 | quote = In 1934, Kirov, the leader of the Leningrad Communist Party, was murdered, probably on Stalin's orders. Stalin used this episode to order massive purges by which anybody suspected of disloyalty was murdered, sent to prison camps, or put on public show trials at which they pleaded guilty to incredible crimes they could never have done. [...] The Communist leadership was purged - 93 of the 139 Central Committee members were put to death. The armed forces were purged - 81 of the 103 generals and admirals were executed. The Communist Party was purged - about a third of its 3 million members were killed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Stalin's death in March 1953 purges as systematic campaigns of expulsion from the party stopped. In the decades after, the center's strong political control was exerted instead mainly through individualized loss of party membership and its attendant [[nomenklatura]] privileges (which in the Soviet system quite effectively downgraded one's opportunities in society—[[trade unions in the Soviet Union#Role in the Soviet class system, chekism, and party rule|one's job, whom one could interact with, which foods one could buy, and so on]]). For recalcitrant cases, the Soviet authorities usually used the harsher method  of [[involuntary commitment]] to a psychiatric institution to reduce the accused into total [[nonperson]]s.

A '''romance scam''' is a [[confidence trick]] involving feigning romantic intentions towards a victim, gaining their affection, and then using that goodwill to commit fraud.  Fraudulent acts may involve access to the victim's money, bank accounts, credit cards, passports, e-mail accounts, or [[national identification number]]s; or forcing the victims to commit financial fraud on their behalf.&lt;ref name="auto9"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/sandiego/press-releases/2014/looking-for-love-beware-of-online-dating-scams|title=Looking for Love?

==Stolen images==
[[File:DatingScamPassport.jpg|thumb|This [[falsified]] [[passport]] was used in an actual internet romance scam. The deception can be obvious to observers — for example, the photo on this passport does not comply with regulations for size or pose — but these signs are often ignored by victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/financial_scams/financial_scams_4554.html|title=Internet Dating and Romance Scams|work=Travel.state.gov|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208112109/http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/financial_scams/financial_scams_4554.html|archivedate=8 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Romance scammers create personal profiles using stolen photographs of attractive people for the purpose of asking others to contact them. This is often known as [[catfishing]].&lt;ref name="catfishing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socialcatfish.com/what-is-catfishing-online-dating/|title=What Is Catfishing, Where It Came From, and the Psychology Behind Catfish Online Dating Scam|date=18 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communications are exchanged between the [[scammer]] and victim over a period of time until the scammer feels they have connected with the victim enough to ask for money. These requests may be for gas money, bus or airplane tickets to visit the victim, medical or education expenses. There is usually the promise the scammer will one day join the victim in the victim's home. The scam usually ends when the victim realizes they are being scammed or stops sending money.

==Internet==
Criminal networks defraud lonely people around the world with false promises of love and romance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/romance-scams-online-fbi-facebook_n_59414c67e4b0d318548666f9|title=How A Billion-Dollar Internet Scam Is Breaking Hearts And Bank Accounts|date=2017-07-20|work=[[HuffPost]]|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scammers post profiles on [[dating website]]s, social media accounts, classified sites and even online forums to search for new victims.&lt;ref name=ReplyAll&gt;{{cite web|title=Love is lies|url=http://gimletmedia.com/episode/13-love-is-lies/|website=gimletmedia.com|publisher=Gimlet Media|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scammer usually attempts to obtain a more private method of communication such as an email or phone number to build trust with the victim. &lt;ref name="KMBC"&gt;"[http://www.kmbc.com/money/9246998/detail.html Online Romance Scams Continue To Grow] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207202351/http://www.kmbc.com/money/9246998/detail.html|date=2012-02-07}}," ''[[KMBC-TV|KMBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Scammers prey on the victim's false sense of a relationship to lure them into sending money.

In 2016, the US [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] received reports of more than US $220 million being lost by victims of relationship scams.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/04/our-time-com-con-man/554057/|title=The Perfect Man Who Wasn't|last=Monroe|first=Rachel|work=[[The Atlantic]]|access-date=2018-04-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was approximately seven times what was stolen through [[Phishing Scams|phishing scams]] and almost 100 times the reported losses from [[ransomware]] attacks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2011, [[Sarah Lacy]] managed to update the story from Nigeria, where many earlier [[419 scams]] had evolved into online-dating scams. The scammer was "more a long-distance emotional prostitute, providing a service men appear to be happy to pay for," on the one hand, but on the other was also often a brilliant entrepreneur who made the business reporter in Lacy feel a "broad smile [spread] across my face as we spoke, even [making me break] out in laughter once or twice."&lt;ref&gt;Lacy, Sarah, [https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/15/the-chilling-story-of-genius-in-a-land-of-chronic-unemployment/ "The Chilling Story of Genius in a Land of Chronic Unemployment"], ''[[Tech Crunch]]'', May 15, 2011. Retrieved 2011-05-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common variations==
Narratives used to extract money from the victims of romantic scams include the following:
* The scammer says their boss has paid them in postal [[money order]]s. The scammer asks the victim to cash the forged money orders, and then wire money to the scammer. The bank eventually reverts the money order cash but not the wire transfer. &lt;ref name="Seduce1"&gt;"Seduced into scams: Online lovers often duped," ''[[MSNBC]]''. [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8704213 1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901003827/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8704213/ |date=2006-09-01 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The scammer says they need the victim to send money to pay for a [[passport]].&lt;ref name="Seduce1"/&gt;
* The scammer says they require money for flights to the victim's country because of being held there by a family member or spouse. &lt;ref name="StateDeptBrochure"&gt;"[https://travel.state.gov/pdf/international_financial_scams_brochure.pdf International Financial Scams – Internet Dating, Inheritance, Work Permits, Overpayment, and Money-Laundering] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021085856/http://travel.state.gov/pdf/international_financial_scams_brochure.pdf |date=2013-10-21 }}," ''[[United States Department of State]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In all cases the scammer never comes, or instead says that they are being held against their will by immigration authorities who are demanding bribes. &lt;ref name="USEmbassyGhana"&gt;"[http://ghana.usembassy.gov/romance_scam.html ROMANCE SCAMS] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926093636/http://ghana.usembassy.gov/romance_scam.html |date=2008-09-26 }}," ''[[United States embassy|US Diplomatic Mission in Ghana]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* The scammer says they have had gold bars or other valuables seized by customs and need to pay taxes to before they can recover their items and join the victim in their country.&lt;ref name="Seduce1"/&gt;{{Dead link|date=June 2018}}
* The scammer meets the victim on an online dating site, lives in a foreign country, falls in love, but needs money to join the victim in his/her country.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2012/10/30/online-dating-scam/|title=Online daters, be warned! 1 in 10 profiles are scams, report reveals|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Seduce1"/&gt;{{Dead link|date=June 2018}}

* The scammer says they need the money for their own or their parent's urgent medical treatment.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="womenscams" /&gt;{{Dead link|date=June 2018}}
* The scammer says they need the money to complete their education before they can visit the victim.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kharkovinfo.com/kharkov-dating-agencies-is-it-a-scam.html|title=Are Ukrainian dating agencies a scam?|publisher=Kharkov Info}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="womenscams" /&gt;{{Dead link|date=June 2018}}
* The scammer offers a job, often to people in a poor country, on payment of a registration fee. These are particularly common at African dating sites.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;{{Dead link|date=June 2018}}
* The scammer actually is employed directly or indirectly by a website, with a share of the victim's member or usage fees passed on to the scammer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2013/04/09/the-mail-order-bride-boom/ |title=The mail-order bride boom - Fortune Tech |publisher=Tech.fortune.cnn.com |date=2013-04-09 |accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blackmail===
Some romance scammers seek out a victim with an obscure fetish and will make the victim think that if they pay for the scammer's plane ticket, they will get to live out their [[sexual fantasy]] with the scammer. Other scammers like to entice victims to perform sexual acts on [[webcam]]. They then record their victims, play back the recorded images or videos to them and then extort money to prevent them from sending the recordings to friends, family, or employers, often discovered via [[social media]] sites such as [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]] etc.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

===Pro-Daters===
The pro-dater differs from other scams in method of operation; a face-to-face meeting actually does take place in the scammer's country but for the sole purpose of manipulating the victim into spending as much money as possible in relatively little time, with little or nothing in return. The scheme usually involves accomplices, such as an interpreter or a taxi driver, each of whom must be paid by the victim at an inflated price. Everything is pre-arranged so that the wealthy foreigner pays for expensive accommodation, is taken not to an ordinary public café but to a costly restaurant (usually some out-of-the-way place priced far above what locals would ever be willing to pay), and is manipulated into making various expensive purchases, including gifts for the scammer such as electronics and fur coats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukrainiandatingblog.com/2012/03/nine-tips-identify-avoid-ukrainian-pro-daters/|title=Nine Tips on How to Identify and Avoid Ukrainian Pro-Daters|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vendors are also typically part of the scheme. After the victim has left, the merchandise is returned to the vendors and the pro-dater and their various accomplices take their respective cut of the take. As the pro-dater is eager to date again, the next date is immediately set up with the next wealthy foreigner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romancescam.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=31520|title=Romance Scam|work=Romancescam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The supposed relationship goes no further, except to inundate the victim with requests for more money after they return home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiandatingjournal.com/tips-how-to-recognize-professional-asian-pro-daters/|title=Tips how to recognize professional Asian pro-daters|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike a [[wikt:gold digger|gold digger]], who marries for money, a pro-dater is not necessarily single or available in real life.

===419 scams===
Another variation of the romance scam is when the scammer insists they need to marry in order to inherit millions of dollars of gold left by a father, uncle, or grandfather. A young woman will contact a victim and tell them of their plight: not being able to remove the gold from their country as they are unable to pay the duty or marriage taxes. The woman will be unable to inherit the fortune until she gets married, the marriage being a prerequisite of the father, uncle or grandfather's will. The scammer convinces their victim they are sincere until they are able to build up enough of a rapport to ask for thousands of dollars to help bring the gold into the victim's country. The scammer will offer to fly to the victim's country to prove they are a real person so the victim will send money for the flight. However, the scammer never arrives. The victim will contact the scammer to ask what happened, and the scammer will provide an excuse such as not being able to get an exit visa, or an illness, theirs or a family member. Scammers are very adept at knowing how to "play" their victims - sending love poems, sex games in emails, building up a "loving relationship" with many promises of "one day we will be married". Often photos of unknown African actresses will be used to lure the victim into believing they are talking to that person. Victims may be invited to travel to the scammer's country; in some cases the victims arrive with asked-for gift money for family members or bribes for corrupt officials, only to be beaten and robbed or murdered.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midsummerseve.com/article/online_dating_scams_419|title=Online dating scams: 419 scams|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impersonation of military personnel===
A rapidly growing technique scammers are using is to impersonate American military personnel. Scammers prefer to use the images, names and profiles of soldiers as this usually inspires confidence, trust and admiration in their female victims.&lt;ref name=Power&gt;{{cite news|last1=Power|first1=Julie|title=Love me don't: the West African online scam using US soldiers|url=http://www.smh.com.au/good-weekend/love-me-dont-the-west-african-online-scam-using-us-soldiers-20141205-11szid.html|accessdate=6 December 2014|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Military public relations often post information on soldiers without mentioning their families or personal lives, so images are stolen from these websites by organized Internet crime gangs often operating out of Nigeria or Ghana. These scammers tell their victims they are lonely, or supporting an orphanage with their own money, or needing financial assistance because they can not access their own money in a combat zone, etc. The money is always sent to a third party to be collected for the scammer. Sometimes the third party is real, sometimes fictitious. Funds sent by [[Western Union]] and [[MoneyGram]] do not have to be claimed by showing identification if the sender sends money using a secret pass phrase and response. The money and can be picked up anywhere in the world. Some scammers may request [[Bitcoin]] as an alternative payment method.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romancescam.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=74&amp;t=40328|title=Romance Scam|work=Romancescam|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330022927/http://www.romancescam.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=74&amp;t=40328|archivedate=2014-03-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=June 2018}}

The '''Second Desmond rebellion''' (1579–1583) was the more widespread and bloody of the two [[Desmond Rebellions]] launched by the [[FitzGerald]] dynasty of [[County Desmond|Desmond]] in [[Munster]], Ireland, against English rule in Ireland. The second rebellion began in July 1579 when [[James FitzMaurice FitzGerald]] landed in Ireland with a force of [[Papal]] troops, triggering an insurrection across the south of Ireland on the part of the Desmond dynasty, their allies and others who were dissatisfied for various reasons with English government of the country. The rebellion ended with the 1583 death of [[Gerald FitzGerald, 15th Earl of Desmond]], and the defeat of the rebels.

The rebellion was in equal part a protest by [[feudal]] lords against the intrusion of central government into their domains; a conservative Irish reaction to English policies that were altering traditional [[Gaels|Gaelic]] society; and a religious conflict, in which the rebels claimed that they were upholding [[Roman Catholicism|Catholicism]] against a [[Protestant]] queen who had been pronounced a [[heresy|heretic]] in 1570 by the papal bull ''[[Regnans in Excelsis]]''.

The result of the rebellions was the destruction of the Desmond dynasty and the subsequent [[Plantations of Ireland#Munster Plantation (1586 onwards)|Munster Plantations]] – the [[colonisation]] of Munster with English settlers. In addition, the fighting laid waste to a large part of the south of Ireland. War-related famine and disease are thought to have killed up to a third of Munster's pre-war population.

==Background==
{{see also|Desmond Rebellions}}

===First rebellion, 1569–73===
The Munster branch of the FitzGeralds, known as the [[Geraldines]], were holders of the title [[Earl of Desmond]], which at the time of the rebellions was held by [[Gerald FitzGerald, 15th Earl of Desmond]], referred to here as the ''Earl of Desmond''.

The first Desmond rebellion (1569–73) had been an armed protest against English intrusion into the Desmond territories. Specifically it was against the creation of the office of "Lord President" (governor) in the province of Munster and the English pursuit of policies that favoured the FitzGerald's rivals, the Butlers of Ormonde, and various English colonists. The most pressing grievance of the Geraldines had been the government's arrest of Gerald the Earl and his brother John of Desmond in 1568 for their part in a private war against the Butlers in 1565, which had culminated in the [[Battle of Affane]] in [[County Waterford]].

The [[Desmond Rebellions#First Desmond Rebellion|First Desmond Rebellion]] was launched in 1569, in the absence of the Desmond leadership, by [[James FitzMaurice FitzGerald]], the 'captain general' of the FitzGerald army. That rebellion was quashed by the English crown forces and their Irish allies (primarily the Butlers, led by [[Thomas Butler, 3rd Earl of Ormonde]]), and ended in 1573.

===Outcomes===
The English response after the first rebellion was conciliation of the Geraldines. Fitzmaurice, the leader of the rebellion, was pardoned and the Earl and his brother John of Desmond were released from imprisonment and returned to their lands. As late as 1579, it looked most unlikely that the FitzGeralds would again challenge English rule in Munster. However, a combination of personal, economic and religious factors, and the actions of James Fitzmaurice FitzGerald himself, led to an explosion of rebellion in July of that year.

Fitzmaurice, who had led the first rebellion, found himself without property and powerless after peace was restored. Lands that he had inherited were confiscated and colonised by English settlers. The Earl of Desmond was forbidden from exacting military service and quartering his troops on his dependants (a practice known as [[coyne and livery]]), and he was reduced to maintaining only 20 horsemen in his private service. This abolition by the government of private armies meant that Fitzmaurice, who was a professional soldier, was without a source of income.

Fitzmaurice was therefore impoverished, and in 1574 he was evicted by the Earl from lands he had been renting since 1573. On top of these discontents, Fitzmaurice also had a genuine commitment to the Catholic [[counter-reformation]] and a deep antipathy to Protestantism, which had been introduced into Ireland by the English. Fitzmaurice left Ireland for France in 1575, seeking help from Catholic powers to restart the rebellion.

==Second rebellion==
The factors which drove Fitzmaurice into rebellion also created a wide pool of potential rebels in southern Ireland. Firstly, the disbanded Irish soldiers from various lords' private armies faced destitution and even death in an English ruled Ireland. In the wake of the first Desmond Rebellion, [[Henry Sidney]], the [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]] and [[William Drury]], the [[Lord President of Munster]], had up to 700 unemployed or "masterless" soldiers executed, judging them to be a danger to the public peace. The surviving mercenary soldiers in Munster would form the backbone of the coming rebellion. Secondly, many of the local Irish Lords felt that their interests were threatened by the English policy of [[Plantations of Ireland|Plantations]] – confiscating land for which the owner did not have an English title and establishing English colonies on it. Thirdly, the imposition of [[seneschal]]s, or English military governors, in various areas where the locals leaders had previously been independent meant that some chieftains, such as [[Fiach MacHugh O'Byrne]] of the [[Wicklow Mountains]], were already engaged in a low level war with the English authorities throughout the 1570s.

Finally, cultural and religious conflict also played a role in fomenting discontent. In the early 1570s, Sir [[John Perrot]], the English Lord Deputy, had banned aspects of traditional Gaelic Irish culture, including [[Brehon law]], [[bard]]ic [[Irish language]] poetry and Irish dress. In addition, the English had introduced [[Protestantism]] as the state religion in Ireland, whereas the majority of the population were [[Roman Catholic]]. This was an increasingly important proof of loyalty to the Dublin administration after the promulgation of [[Pope Pius V]]'s [[papal bull]] ''[[Regnans in Excelsis]]'' in 1570, when the Papacy excommunicated Elizabeth and her officials. Fitzmaurice appealed to both of these sentiments, speaking only Irish, wearing Irish dress and also championing the cause of the counter-reformation.

===Aborted invasion of 1578===
In exile in Europe from 1575, Fitzmaurice tried to get backing for a new rebellion.  He intrigued at the French and Spanish courts for a foreign invasion of Ireland. However, [[Philip II of Spain]] showed no interest in supporting him, as he was already overstretched fighting the [[Dutch Revolt]] in the [[Netherlands]]. Fitzmaurice had more success though, at the court of [[Pope Gregory XIII]], where he met with exiled English [[Roman Catholic]] priests such as [[William Allen (cardinal)|William Allen]] and [[Nicholas Sanders]] who were seeking to invade England, depose Elizabeth and restore a Catholic monarchy.

With the English adventurer Captain [[Thomas Stukley]], Fitzmaurice planned an expedition which was to make [[Giacomo Boncompagni]], the nephew of Pope Gregory, [[King of Ireland]]. This was supported by the English Catholics.

Stukley was provided by the Pope with infantry and sailed from [[Civitavecchia]] in Rome with 1000 men in March 1578, including pardoned highwaymen, musketeers and some professional officers, including Hercules of [[Province of Novara|Pisano]] and [[Sebastiano di San Giuseppe]] of [[Bologna]]. In [[Cadiz]] in Spain he added some Irishmen and [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip II]] sent him to [[Lisbon]] to secure better ships and meet with Fitzmaurice.  Having no ships to offer, King [[Sebastian of Portugal]], instead invited Stukley to join an invasion of [[Morocco]], Stukley was killed there in August 1578 at the [[Battle of Alcácer Quibir]], thus ending Fitzmaurice's initial plans for invading Ireland.

===1579 invasion===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[County Kerry]] --&gt;
[[File:Dun an Oir - geograph.org.uk - 17015.jpg|thumb|right|Dún an Óir]]
Nicholas Sanders, Fitzmaurice and others returned to Rome and formed a new expedition with Papal authority. With a small force of Irish, Spanish and Italian troops, they set sail for Ireland in early June 1579, from [[A Coruña|Corunna]] in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia, Spain]].  The fleet consisted of Fitzmaurice's own vessel and three Spanish [[shallop]]s.  Fitzmaurice was joined by Matthew de Oviedo and by Nicholas Sanders as [[Commissary Apostolic|Papal commissary]].

En route in the [[English channel]], they captured two English vessels and arrived at [[Dingle]] harbour (part of the area now known as [[County Kerry]]) on 16 July.  On the 18th they cast anchor in the nearby small [[Ard na Caithne|Smerwick]] harbour (now known as [[Ard na Caithne]]), where they established a defensive garrison at Dún an Óir (''Fort of Gold'', Spanish:''Fuerte del Oro''), an [[Iron Age]] [[promontory fort]] nearby.  Nicholas Sanders paraded the Papal banner with some ceremony at [[Dingle]] and Fitzmaurice proclaimed [[religious war|Holy War]] sanctioned by letters from Pope Gregory. This was a very serious matter in 16th century thinking, as it released the Catholic subjects of [[Elizabeth I]] from their duty of obedience to her, on the grounds that she was a [[Heresy|heretic]] (the Pope had [[excommunicated]] her in 1570). The fact that Fitzmaurice had openly challenged the legitimacy of the [[Tudor dynasty]] to rule Ireland meant that, unlike the first Desmond rebellion of 1569–73, this one would be very unlikely to end with a negotiated peace.

The rebels were joined on 25 July by two [[galley]]s with 100 more Spanish troops.

===Rebellion begins===
Fitzmaurice's small force might well have been crushed rapidly had he not been joined on 1 August by John of Desmond. [[John Fitzedmund Fitzgerald]], like Fitzmaurice, had been a soldier and had a large following among his kinsmen and the disaffected and unemployed soldiers of Munster. It was only after John's joining of the rebellion that it was joined by these soldiers in large numbers. John and his brother, [[James Fitzedmund Fitzgerald]], the [[Seneschal]] of [[Imokilly]], marked their entry into the rebellion by assassinating two English officials, Henry Davells and Arthur Carter in a [[tavern]] in [[Tralee]].

John of Desmond and Fitzmaurice together commanded a force of over 3000 men, including a small number of European soldiers, and several thousand native Irish troops. The prospect of further continental reinforcements was hampered though, when [[William Winter (admiral)|Sir William Winter]], on 29 July 1579, four days after the landing at Smerwick, seized the ships of the invasion force and cut off their sea-routes.

The Earl of Desmond, who was reasonably satisfied with the English settlement of the first rebellion, initially tried to stay out of Fitzmaurice's rebellion and attempted to raise the Geraldines to put it down. However, he managed to assemble only 60 men –in contrast to the thousands raised at short notice by his brother John, indicating that most of the FitzGeralds and their allies sympathised with the rebellion.

A number of the invasion force went to other parts of Ireland. A small number went to [[Siege of Carrigafoyle Castle|Carrigafoyle Castle]] on the southern banks of the [[River Shannon]] (in northern County Kerry), the seat of the Earl of Desmond. This contingent included an Italian engineer, Captain Julian, who set about perfecting the castle's defences.

Fitzmaurice himself mounted a sortie to [[Connacht]] to try to provoke rebellion there. However, he was killed in a skirmish with the forces of the Burkes of Clanwilliam on 18 August, after his men stole some horses belonging to Theobald Burke (ironically a cousin of Fitzmaurice). This left the rebellion under the command of John of Desmond, now effectively the leader of the Geraldines.

The rebels were left in control of southern Munster and the English did not have enough troops to re-take it. Drury, the English Lord Deputy, marched 600 men to Limerick, where he was joined by [[Nicholas Malby]], with a force of 1,100 English soldiers. Drury was in poor health and died shortly afterwards. He left the Crown forces under the command of Malby.

===Gerald the Earl joins the rebellion===
[[File:Askeaton Friary - geograph.org.uk - 497997.jpg|thumb|right|The Askeaton friary was burned during Malby's attack]]
In late October, Malby marched through the Desmond territory, devastating the countryside there and demanded that Gerald the Earl of Desmond surrender his castle at [[Askeaton]]. Desmond refused and resisted when Malby tried to take the castle by force. [[William Pelham (lord justice)|William Pelham]], the Lord Justice of Ireland, then proclaimed Desmond a traitor, meaning that he was to be captured and executed. This forced Gerald and the remaining FitzGeralds to join the rebellion.

The Earl assumed leadership of the rebellion in a spectacular manner. On 13 November 1579, he and his followers sacked the town of [[Youghal]], massacring its English garrison, hanging the English officials there, looting the town and abusing the civilian population. Desmond's force then blockaded the city of [[Cork (city)|Cork]] before withdrawing westwards into the mountains of Kerry. MacCarthy Mor, meanwhile, chief of the MacCarthys, announced his joining of the rebellion by sacking [[Kinsale]].

===Spring 1580 campaign===
{{further|Siege of Carrigafoyle Castle}}
[[File:Carrigafoyle Castle Ireland.jpg|thumb|right|[[Carrigafoyle Castle]]]]

The ferocity of Desmond's actions were repaid in kind by the Crown forces early in the following year. [[Thomas Butler, 3rd Earl of Ormonde]], Sir William Pelham and Sir [[George Carew (Ireland)|George Carew]] were sent to Munster to subdue the rebels and proceeded to systematically destroy the Desmond lands in [[County Limerick]], [[County Cork]] and north [[County Kerry]] and to kill the civilians who lived there at random. These tactics were intended to cause so much economic and human damage to the Desmonds' followers that they would be forced to leave the rebellion. The Crown troops were not only English but also composed of Irish forces antagonistic to the Geraldines, notably, apart from Ormonde's followers, the over 1000 fighting men of the [[MacCarthy Reagh]]s of [[Barony of Carbery|Carbery]], and also the O'Driscolls. [[Hugh O'Neill, 3rd Earl of Tyrone]] also led a contingent from his lands in [[Ulster]].

In March 1580, the Crown forces had an important strategic victory, [[Siege of Carrigafoyle Castle|taking the Desmond stronghold]] at [[Siege of Carrigafoyle Castle|Carrigafoyle Castle]] at the mouth of the Shannon.  With 1400 soldiers and assisted by William Winter and his naval forces, William Pelham captured Carrigafoyle, the principal Desmond stronghold at the mouth of [[River Shannon]] and massacred the rebel garrison there. They had now cut off the Geraldine forces from the north of the country and prevented a landing of foreign troops into the main Munster port of [[Limerick]]. When news of the destruction of Carrigafoyle castle spread, other Desmond strongholds fell swiftly.  The castle at [[Askeaton]] was abandoned with its Spanish defenders blowing up the walls, and the garrisons at [[Newcastle West]], Balliloghan, [[Rathkeale]] and [[Ballyduff, County Kerry|Ballyduff]] surrendered soon afterwards. Many of the lords who had joined the rebellion surrendered as well, judging the English to have the upper hand. Those who surrendered included MacCarthy Mor, Roche, Barry and others.

It looked as if the rebellion was beaten by the summer of 1580, but it was revived by the outbreak of new rebellion in the eastern province of [[Leinster]].

===Rebellion in Leinster===
In July 1580, [[Fiach McHugh O'Byrne]], based in the [[Wicklow Mountains]] launched the rebellion in the east of Ireland. He assembled a coalition of local lords and clan leaders, including the Kavanaghs, the O'Tooles and the O'Moores. Many of these had already been fighting on and off with English garrisons for several years. In particular, the arbitrary killings by an English officer named Masterson, based in Wicklow, seems to have provoked many into revolt. In a symbolic rejection of English rule, the rebels bestowed the title of King of Leinster on Creon MacMurrough Kavanagh, whose ancestors had held this title before the English conquest. O'Byrne was joined by James Eustace, Viscount of Baltinglass, an [[Old English (Ireland)|Old English]] [[marcher]] lord of [[the Pale]], who was motivated primarily by his devout Catholicism.

In August, John of Desmond and Nicholas Sanders met Baltinglass in [[Laois]] to try to co-ordinate their forces, but aside from limited co-operation in the Barrow valley region, they were unable to forge a common strategy. Nevertheless, the outbreak of rebellion so close to the centre of English government in [[Dublin]] was of grave concern to the English.

Sir [[Henry Sidney]], the former [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Deputy of Ireland]] influenced the response from his membership of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy council]] and in August 1580 a new Lord Deputy, [[Arthur Grey, 14th Baron Grey de Wilton]] was sent from England with 6000 troops. Grey's immediate priority was to put down the Leinster rebellion.

On 25 August 1580, English forces under Grey were routed in the [[Battle of Glenmalure]] with the forces of O'Byrne and Viscount Baltinglass. While trying to storm O'Byrne's fortress at [[Glenmalure]] in the heart of the Wicklow mountains, they were ambushed and mauled, losing over 800 men killed. [[William Stanley (Elizabethan)|William Stanley]] was sent by Grey de Wilton to defend the [[The Pale|Pale]] area of [[Leinster]]. For the remainder of the war, O'Byrne and his allies raided English settlements in the east and south east, but were unable to take strategic advantage of their victory at Glenmalure.

The rebellion and its aftermath saw a number of people from the Pale and other Old English areas such as [[Wexford]] (who had previously always been loyal to English authority) hanged as traitors. Those executed included [[Dermot O'Hurley]] the Catholic [[Archbishop of Cashel]] and [[Margaret Ball]] the wife of the [[Lord Mayor of Dublin]], also died in prison in [[Dublin Castle]]. Those executed often proclaimed their Catholic faith on the scaffold and were honoured by their Church as Catholic [[martyr]]s [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08163a.htm]. These executions were a major factor in the long term alienation of the [[Old English (Ireland)|Old English]] from the English state in Ireland.

===1580 Spanish and Papal landing===
{{Further|Siege of Smerwick}}
[[File:Monument commemorating the Smerwick Harbour massacre - geograph.org.uk - 459585.jpg|thumb|200px|Monument at Dún an Óir to those massacred in the Siege of Smerwick, October 1580]] 
On 10 September 1580, a squadron of Spanish ships under the command of Don [[Juan Martinez de Recalde]] landed a Papal force of Spanish and Italians numbering 600 men commanded by [[Sebastiano di San Giuseppe]] (aka Sebastiano da Modena), at [[Ard na Caithne|Smerwick]], on the [[Dingle Peninsula]] near the same point where Fitzmaurice had landed the previous year. They had been sent by Philip II to aid the rebellion albeit in a cladestine manner, as a result it was paid for by Pope Gregory. Desmond, Baltinglass and John of Desmond made an effort to link up with the expeditionary force but English forces under Ormonde and Grey blocked them and prompt naval action by [[Richard Bingham (soldier)|Richard Bingham]] blockaded the Papal force's ships into the bay at Smerwick. San Giuseppe had no choice but to fortify his men in the fort at Dún an Óir.

In October 1580, Grey de Wilton with up to 4000 troops arrived at Smerwick and laid siege to the garrison.  The invasion forces were geographically isolated on the tip of the narrow [[Dingle Peninsula]], cut off by [[Mount Brandon]] on one side and the much larger English force on the other. They had no means of escape. In addition, the English had brought up heavy artillery by sea, which rapidly broke down the improvised defences of Dún an Óir.

After a three-day siege, commander Di san Giuseppe surrendered on 10 October 1580.  Grey de Wilton ordered the massacre of the invasion forces, sparing only the commanders. Italian and Spanish troops, and Irish men and women, were beheaded and their bodies thrown into the sea. {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Among the English soldiers present at the siege and massacre was the writer and explorer [[Walter Raleigh]]. This was brought against him as a [[criminal charge]] in one of his [[trial (law)|trials]]. Raleigh argued that he was "obliged to obey the commands of his superior officer" but he was unable to exonerate himself.&lt;ref name="scenery"&gt;[http://www.libraryireland.com/SceneryIreland/IV-22.php ''The Scenery and Antiquities of Ireland'']. Chapter IV. (1841)&lt;/ref&gt;

===End of the rebellion===
With the massacre at Smerwick, the tide had turned decisively against the rebels. However, the war dragged on for two more years of increasingly bitter guerrilla fighting. The civilian population was to suffer tremendously as a result of the war, being targeted by both sides and having their crops, livestock and homes destroyed.

Grey was the most ruthless of the English commanders, being described once as "a bloody man, who regarded not the life of subjects more than dogs". He described his own tactics as "burning their corn, spoiling their harvest and driving their cattle". The result of this was famine and the outbreak of epidemics of diseases caused by malnutrition. In the summer of 1582, Elizabeth I removed Grey from the office of Lord Deputy for his excessive brutality. By mid 1582, [[Warham St. Leger (1525?-1597)|Warham St Leger]] reported that around 30,000 people had died of famine in Munster alone in the previous six months and hundreds were dying in Cork city of starvation and disease.

Meanwhile, the rebellion slowly fell apart. As a result of the defeat at Smerwick, Papal assistance to Nicholas Sanders was cut off. After spending almost two years as a fugitive in the south-west of Ireland, he is believed to have died of cold and starvation in the spring of 1581. In April 1581, a general pardon was offered to all but the rebellion's leaders. Many of the Desmond's erstwhile supporters surrendered. Baltinglass fled for France in August 1581. Fiach MacHugh O'Byrne made a false surrender in April 1581 but continued his raiding after a short period. However he surrendered for good in September 1582, ending the fighting in Leinster.

For the Earl of Desmond, there would be no pardon, and he was pursued by crown forces until the end. For the remainder of the war, the Earl and the remaining Geraldines evaded capture on the run in the mountains of Kerry, and Tipperary and engaged in [[guerrilla warfare]]. In early 1582, John of Desmond was killed in a skirmish north of Cork. The rebellion was finally ended in 1583, when the Earl of Ormonde assumed command of Crown forces. Ormonde took a less ruthless approach to the campaign than the English officers had, preferring diplomacy to scorched earth tactics. He contained the rebels to west Cork and Kerry and persuaded many of Desmond's closest relatives to surrender. On 11 November 1583 the end came when the Earl was killed in Glenaginty in the [[Slieve Mish Mountains]] (near [[Tralee]] in County Kerry) by the local Moriarty clan of Castledrum on the Dingle peninsula. The Earl and his followers had raided the property of clan Moriarty, stole cattle and mistreated the sister of the clan chief, Owen Moriarty. Men of clan Moriarty, with 25 soldiers, pursued the Earl's followers until they captured and killed the Earl at Glenaginty.  Owen Moriarty received 1000 pounds of silver from the English government for Desmond's head, which was sent to Queen Elizabeth in London, his body was triumphantly displayed on the walls of Cork city.

While some commentators criticised Moriarty for the slaying of the Earl, to many it brought an end to the ruinous Desmond rebellion and the famine that followed it.

==Aftermath==
[[File:Gerald1583.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Monument marking the site of FitzGerald's capture in Glanageenty forest, [[County Kerry]].]]
Munster continued to suffer from [[bubonic plague]] and famine in the years following the rebellion, and was described as having vast empty areas and a substantially reduced population. Perhaps as much as one third of the province's population perished in the war.

The main political consequence of the rebellion was the annihilation of the Desmond dynasty's power in southern Ireland. Their lands were confiscated, along with those of their allies.  Following a survey in 1584 by the [[Surveyor General]] of Ireland, [[Sir Valentine Browne]] it was subsequently [[colonisation|colonised]] with English settlers – the [[Plantations of Ireland#Munster Plantation (1586 onwards)|Munster Plantations]]. The Earl of Desmond title was later restored and during another rebellion, the [[Nine Years War (Ireland)|Nine Years War]] in the 1590s, the English attempted to introduce a new Protestant Geraldine Earl who had grown up in England, but without success.

In Leinster, Fiach MacHugh O'Byrne submitted but was later killed leading a new rebellion in Nine Years War. James Eustace, 3rd Viscount of Baltinglass went into exile, dying in Spain in 1585. His title and property, including [[Rathfarnham Castle]] were confiscated.

Many more former rebels were pardoned but had some land confiscated and had to pay substantial fines.

The destruction of so many important landed families in Ireland and colonisation of their lands with English settlers meant that the Second Desmond Rebellion was one of the most important events in the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland]] – a century long process which saw all of Ireland under English control by 1603. The killing of many of the Irish mercenary class in the war was likewise an important development for the English authorities in establishing their monopoly on the use of force in Ireland. The Rebellion also established the theme of religious conflict in Irish history for the first time. The divide between Irish Catholic landowners and Protestant English settlers and government would dominate Irish life for another century and still has reverberations to this day.

{{Hatnote|For the modern city, see [[Sinjar]]; for the genus, see [[Singara (moth)]]; for the Indian snack, see [[samosa]]; for Gypsy-related terms, see [[Zingara (disambiguation)|Zingara]]}}
'''Singara''' ({{Lang-grc-gre|τὰ Σίγγαρα}}, ''tà Síngara'')&lt;ref&gt;[[Cassius Dio]], XVIII.22.&lt;/ref&gt; was a strongly fortified post at the northern extremity of [[Mesopotamia]], which for a while, as it appears from coins found, was occupied by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] as an advanced colony against the [[Persia]]ns. It was the camp of [[legio I Parthica|''legio'' I ''Parthica'']].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/le-lh/legio/i_parthica.html Account of Legio I Parthica at ''livius.org'']&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Location==
{{main|Sinjar}}
Its position south-east of [[Nisibis]] was indifferently defined by ancient writers, with [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] calling it a city of [[Arabia]] "near [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]]" and [[Ptolemy]] placing it on the [[Tigris]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Claudius Ptolemaeus]], ''[[Geographia (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' V.18.9.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no doubt, however, that it and its adjacent mountain ({{lang|grc|ὸ Σίγγαρας ὄρος}}, ''ò Síggaras óros'')&lt;ref&gt;[[Claudius Ptolemaeus]], ''[[Geographia (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' V.18.2.&lt;/ref&gt; were the predecessors of the modern [[Sinjar]] and [[Mount Sinjar]] in modern [[Iraq]]'s [[Nineveh plains]].

==History==
It was first taken by the Romans during [[Trajan]]'s eastern campaigns, when general [[Lusius Quietus]] captured the city without a fight in the winter of 114;&lt;ref&gt;[[Cassius Dio]], LXVIII.22.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although it was abandoned following the Roman withdrawal from [[Mesopotamia]] in 117, the city became once again part of the Roman Empire with the [[Parthia]]n campaign of [[Septimius Severus]] in 197. The city was raised by Severus to the status of a [[Colonia (Roman)|Roman colony]], as is attested by the legend found on some of the coins minted there during the reign of [[Gordian III]]: {{lang|grc|ΑΥΡ. ϹΕΠ. ΚΟΛ. ϹΙΝΓΑΡΑ.}}, which is Greek script for the city's Latin name, ''Aurelia Septimia Colonia Singara''. It remained one of the easternmost outposts of the Roman Empire throughout the 3rd century. It was the scene of a celebrated nocturnal conflict during a [[Siege of Singara|siege]] of the city in 344 by [[Sassanid]] King [[Shapur II]], the result of which was so unsatisfactory that both sides claimed the victory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], XVIII.5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], X.10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Sextus Rufus]], Ch. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Still later, in 359/360, during the reign of [[Constantius II]], it is recorded that it underwent [[Siege of Singara (360)|a celebrated siege]], and at length was carried by the Persians by storm, though gallantly defended by the townspeople and two legions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], XX.6.&lt;/ref&gt; The country around it is stated by [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] and [[Theophylact Simocatta]] to have been extremely arid, which rendered it equally difficult to take or to relieve from a distance.

'''Stage 5''' (or, originally, "Stage V") is an unofficial stage at the [[Walnut Valley Festival]], an annual [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] festival in [[Winfield, Kansas]], United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberstage5.com/ Stage 5 website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Set up in the Pecan Grove campground, the informal stage began in 1987 when camper Russell Brace and friends built it on the back of a [[flatbed truck]].  The stage is so-named because the festival proper has four main stages.

The stage was immediately popular and is now a cherished tradition at the annual event.  

Audiences at Stage 5 can usually expect to hear typical acoustic string instruments.  However, many musicians, while there, part from traditional bluegrass styles and emphasize a looser, more rock-oriented interpretation of [[Traditional music|roots music]].

Several notables have played Stage 5.  Among them: [[Tommy Emmanuel]], The Wilders, [[Beppe Gambetta]], an early incarnation of the [[Dixie Chicks]], and [[Split Lip Rayfield]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1131">'''Tang Sai'er''' ({{zh|t=唐賽兒}}; [[floruit|fl.]] 1420) was a Chinese [[White Lotus]] rebel leader of the [[Ming dynasty]].

She was the daughter of a martial art master in [[Putai]], married Lin San and joined the [[White Lotus]]. In 1420, she used the discontent among the peasantry to gather a rebel army against the Imperial government at Xieshipeng. She took the cities [[Ju County|Ju]] and [[Jimo]] and defeated several Imperial officials before her army was defeated at [[Anqiu]]. After the defeat, she and her rebels mixed with the sympathetic peasantry and disappeared and were therefore never punished. She remained a popular heroine in folk legend and the village Xieshipeng was named after her.

The '''Tarnak Farm incident''' refers to the killing of four [[Canadians|Canadian]] soldiers and the injury of eight others from the 3rd Battalion, [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]] Battle Group (3PPCLIBG) on the night of April 17, 2002, near [[Kandahar]], [[Afghanistan]].

An [[United States|American]] [[F-16]] fighter jet piloted by [[Air National Guard]] Major Harry Schmidt dropped a laser-guided {{convert|500|lb|adj=on}} [[Mark 82 bomb|bomb]] on the Canadians, who were conducting a night firing exercise at [[Tarnak Farms]].

The deaths were the first of [[Canada's role in the Afghanistan War|Canada's war in Afghanistan]], and the first in a combat zone since the [[Korean War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edmontonsun.com/2012/04/16/fallen-four-remain-in-hearts-and-minds "Fallen four remain in hearts and minds"] By Angelique Rodrigues, [[Edmonton Sun]]. 16 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description of incident==
F-16 pilots [[Major]] William Umbach and his wingman Major Harry Schmidt were returning to their base after a 10-hour night patrol. While flying at {{convert|23000|ft|m}}, they reported [[Surface-to-air missile|surface-to-air]] fire. The fire was actually from a [[Canadian Forces]] [[anti-tank]] and [[machine-gun]] exercise, which was taking place on a former [[Taliban]] firing range.

Maj Schmidt descended a few thousand feet to take a closer look, and asked for permission to "lay down some 20 mike-mike", or spray the area with 20-millimeter cannon fire, but was told to stand by. Major Umbach cautioned his wing man to wait, as well. "Let's just make sure that it's, that it's not friendlies, is all", he said.

At 9:25, the pilots' [[Boeing E-3 Sentry|AWACS]] controller ordered them to "hold fire" and asked Major Schmidt for more information on the surface-to-air fire. However, a minute later, after seeing another firing plume from an antitank weapon, Major Schmidt reported seeing "some men on a road, and it looks like a piece of artillery firing at us."

"I am rolling in&lt;!--sic erat scriptum--&gt; in self-defense", he said.

After Major Umbach reminded him to unlock his weapons, Major Schmidt called "bombs away". Twenty-two seconds later, he reported a direct hit. Ten seconds later, the controller ordered the pilots to disengage, saying the forces on the ground were "friendlies Kandahar".&lt;ref&gt;http://goflightmedicine.com/tarnak-farm/&lt;/ref&gt;

Major Schmidt's testimony at his ''[[Article 32]]'' hearing was that he believed his flight leader, Major Umbach, was under attack. The radio logs show that Major Schmidt requested permission from flight control to fire his [[M61 Vulcan|20&amp;nbsp;mm cannons]] at what he said to be an [[anti-aircraft]] or [[Multiple Launch Rocket System]] below.

==Findings of Board of Inquiry==
Two Boards of Inquiry, one Canadian and one American, were held simultaneously.  The two boards shared personnel information.  Canadian Brigadier-General M.J. Dumais was specialist advisor to the Canadian board and co-chair of the American board.  The findings of the four-member Canadian Tarnak Farm Board of Inquiry, chaired by General [[Maurice Baril]], were released on June 28, 2002.  The Board found that the Canadian troops engaged in the night live-fire exercise had conducted their operations as authorized and in accordance with the established range procedures for the types of weapons fire. The Board concluded that the American [[F-16]] pilots contravened established procedures and were the cause of the incident. The Board further concluded that correcting deficiencies in air coordination and control and tactical planning might have prevented the accident:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"... as much as the F-16 pilots bear final responsibility for the fratricide incident, there existed other systemic shortcomings in air coordination and control procedures, as well as mission planning practices by the tactical flying units, that may have prevented the accident had they been corrected."&lt;ref&gt;National Defence Canada. [http://www.vcds.forces.gc.ca/boi/intro_e.asp Board of Inquiry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050707210748/http://www.vcds.forces.gc.ca/boi/intro_e.asp |date=2005-07-07 }}. Part IV - Detailed Findings, p. 45. Retrieved on: March 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Schmidt's rationale and apology==
In his official apology to the family and friends of the dead and injured Canadians, Schmidt stated

     I believed at the time that my flight lead's transmission to 'check master arm, check laser arm,' indicated he concurred with my decision that the situation required self-defense."&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Friscolanti|Friscolanti, Michael]]. (2005).  ''Friendly Fire: The Untold Story of the U.S. Bombing that Killed Four Canadian Soldiers in Afghanistan.'' pp. 420-421&lt;/ref&gt;

    "I would like to say first and foremost that I sincerely regret the accident that occurred... My heart goes out to the families of the men killed and injured in what can only be described as a tragic accident in the '[[fog of war]]'. The accident was truly unfortunate and I am sorry that it happened."

    "I was called upon to make a perfect decision in a rapidly unfolding combat environment. I had to make that decision with what I now know, with the acuity of 20/20 hindsight, was imperfect information..."

    "My perception was that we had been ambushed, as we had been briefed that Taliban were expected to use ambush tactics in and around Kandahar. I believed that the projectiles posed a real and present danger to our flight and specifically to my flight lead..."

    "While I was assigned to the [[332d Expeditionary Operations Group|332 Aerospace Expeditionary Group]], I was never alerted to the possibility of live-fire training being conducted in the war zone. Further, at no time prior to our mission on 17 April 2002 were we briefed of a live-fire exercise at Tarnak Farms or in the vicinity of Kandahar. Nor were we ever advised while airborne by the AWACS command and control platform, or any calls on the Guard frequency, that there was a live-fire exercise ongoing anywhere in the war zone. Because such an event in a combat area would have been so unusual and unexpected, information about such training would be the type of information we would note so that we could avoid it. This lack of information is the one link in the chain, which if corrected, would surely have avoided this accident..."

    "I attempted to use warning shots to suppress the threat but I was denied by bossman (the controller on the AWACS). I finally communicated to bossman that I was engaging in self-defence because my flight lead was at risk of being shot down."

    "Finally, I would like to tell the families of Sgt. Leger, Cpl. Dyer, Pte. Green and Pte. Smith that I am deeply sorry for what happened... I will always regret what happened that night. Next, I apologize to each of the men I wounded... I think about the men who were killed and the men who were injured. As a family man myself with a wife and two young boys, I can only imagine how difficult it is for they and their families to grapple with the fact that these men volunteered to serve their country and were killed in a wartime accident. I sincerely want them to know that my heart goes out to them and that I am truly sorry for their loss."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news2/background/friendlyfire/statements.html CBC News]. (October 22, 2003).  ''Statements issued by Majors William Umbach and Harry Schmidt''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Article 32 hearing==
[[Image:Colonel Robert Murphy briefs about a Helmet and NVGs.jpg|thumb|Colonel Robert Murphy briefs the investigating officer, Colonel Patrick Rosenow (in leather jacket), about a helmet and night vision goggles during the Article 32 hearing.]]
During the [[Article 32 hearing]], five F-16 pilots testified, including one who had led the US Board of Inquiry.  All five pilots agreed under oath that the dropping of the bomb by Schmidt was not an unreasonable action. [[Michael Friscolanti]] summarized their comments in his book ''Friendly Fire'':

:*Major John Milton: A reasonable fighter pilot could have believed he was trapped in a threat envelope and had no choice but to drop a bomb. It was Maj. Schmidt's right to roll in self-defense, even after the "hold fire" order.
:*Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Viets: Rolling in would be a reasonable response because Maj. Schmidt was reasonable to believe that he was already in the threat envelope of a rocket-based weapons system.
:*Colonel David C. Nichols: A reasonably prudent F-16 pilot might have done the same thing. "Combat aviation is not a science. It's an art."
:*Lieutenant Colonel Craig Fisher: There were no "significant departures from flight discipline". A reasonable fighter pilot would have egressed the area, but that doesn't mean Maj. Schmidt and Maj. Umbach were reckless.
:*Major General Stephen T. Sargeant: A reasonable pilot never would have believed that the fire on the ground was a threat to his flight. And even if he did, turning, descending, and decelerating was an unreasonable reaction. However, disregarding all the alleged reckless maneuvers Maj. Schmidt made to reach the spot where he invoked self-defense, dropping a bomb at that instant was not unreasonable. In other words, if Maj. Schmidt suddenly woke up at {{convert|14000|ft|m}} and four nautical miles (7&amp;nbsp;km) away from the mystery fire, it would be reasonable to drop a bomb in self-defense.&lt;ref&gt;Friscolanti, M., p. 449&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the issues highlighted by the Inquiry related to the use of [[amphetamine]]s in combat.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[https://archive.is/20121212032952/http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123007615 Air Force scientists battle aviator fatigue&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/0801-06.htm U.S. Pilots Stay Up Taking 'Uppers'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615222230/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/0801-06.htm |date=2008-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emonson DL, Vanderbeek RD. (1995) ''The use of amphetamines in U.S. Air Force tactical operations during Desert Shield and Storm.'' 66(8):802&lt;/ref&gt; In testimony it was revealed that Schmidt and Umbach were told by their superiors to use "[[go pill]]s" on their missions, and the airmen blamed the incident on the drugs.  This was a significant part of the defense of the two pilots. Schmidt's defense also blamed the [[fog of war]].

Another issue that was evident, but remained largely in the background, was the quality of communications between the various coalition forces in Afghanistan.

==Disposition==
On September 11, 2002, William Umbach and Harry Schmidt were officially charged with four counts of [[negligent manslaughter]], eight counts of [[aggravated assault]], and one count of [[dereliction of duty]]. Umbach's charges were later dismissed. Schmidt's charges were reduced on June 30, 2003, to just the dereliction of duty charge.

On July 6, 2004, Umbach was reprimanded for leadership failures and allowed to retire. U.S. Lt.-Gen. [[Bruce Carlson]] found Schmidt guilty of dereliction of duty in what the U.S. military calls a "non-judicial hearing" before a senior officer. He was fined nearly $5,700 in pay and reprimanded. The reprimand, written by Lt. Gen. Carlson said Schmidt had "flagrantly disregarded a direct order", "exercised a total lack of basic flight discipline", and "blatantly ignored the applicable [[rules of engagement]]".

Here is an excerpt from the [[letter of reprimand]] given to Schmidt:

: "You acted shamefully on 17 April 2002 over Tarnak Farms, Afghanistan, exhibiting arrogance and a lack of flight discipline. When your flight lead warned you to "make sure it's not friendlies" and the Airborne Warning and Control System aircraft controller directed you to "stand by" and later to "hold fire", you should have marked the location with your targeting pod. Thereafter, if you believed, as you stated, you and your leader were threatened, you should have taken a series of evasive actions and remained at a safe distance to await further instructions from AWACS. Instead, you closed on the target and blatantly disobeyed the direction to "hold fire." Your failure to follow that order is inexcusable. I do not believe you acted in defense of Major Umbach or yourself. Your actions indicate that you used your self-defense declaration as a pretext to strike a target, which you rashly decided was an enemy firing position, and about which you had exhausted your patience in waiting for clearance from the Combined Air Operations Center to engage. You used the inherent right of self-defense as an excuse to wage your own war."&lt;ref&gt;CBC News Online (July 6, 2004). [https://web.archive.org/web/20040804021748/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/friendlyfire/verdict.html "U.S. Air Force Verdict"].&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2006, Schmidt sued the USAF, saying that the military violated the federal Privacy Act by disclosing parts of his military record without his permission and by doing so ruined his reputation.  On September 22, 2007, U.S. District Judge Jeanne Scott ruled against Schmidt, stating, "The release of Schmidt's reprimand gave the public ... insight into the way in which the United States government was holding its pilot accountable. Thus considering all of the circumstances, the disclosures at issue were clearly warranted."&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, "Pilot Loses Lawsuit In Friendly Fire Case", September 23, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the most serious case of fratricide or [[friendly fire]] to have been experienced by the [[Canadian Forces]] (CF) in Coalition operations since the [[Korean War]].

'''''Teatro Giuseppe Verdi'''''  (the '''Giuseppe Verdi Theatre''') is a small [[opera house]] located in a wing of the Rocca dei Marchesi Pallavicino on the Piazza Giuseppe Verdi in [[Busseto]], [[Italy]], a town closely associated with the life of the opera composer, [[Giuseppe Verdi]].  From the 13th century, the “rocca” or “fortress” was the family’s palace; it is now the city hall after being acquired by the municipality in 1856.  The theatre opened on 15 August 1868 and seats 300.

Prior to 1856, a theatre existed in the same location, and while plans to build a new one were begun in 1845, nothing happened until the municipality took over.  Designed by [[Pier Luigi Montecchini]], the theatre is located on an upper level of the City Hall and is reached by a large staircase.  Outside the theatre is a bust of Verdi by [[Giovanni Dupré]].  The interior  
is traditionally horseshoe-shaped with three rows of boxes and an elegantly designed ceiling featuring four medallions representing comedy, tragedy, melodrama, and romantic drama.

Although Verdi opposed its construction (it would be “too expensive and useless in the future”, he said) and is reputed never to have set foot in it, he did contribute 10,000 lire towards the construction and maintained his own box.  On opening night, operagoers dressed in green, the men all wearing green ties, the women wearing green dresses.  Two Verdi operas were presented: ''[[Rigoletto]]'' and ''[[Un ballo in maschera]]''.  Verdi did not attend even though he lived only two miles away at his home, the [[Villa Verdi]], in the village of Sant’Agata in [[Villanova sull'Arda]].

In 1913, [[Arturo Toscanini]] conducted a performance of ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]'' in celebration of the centenary of Verdi’s birth and to raise funds for what is now a large monument of the seated composer located in the piazza. In 2001 the theatre re-painted the sets from 1913 for a revival; these were used again in October 2013 for a Verdi bi-centenary performance of ''Falstaff''.&lt;ref&gt;Bottazzi, A. Review from Busseto. ''Opera'', March 2014, Vol 65 No 3, p321.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre has been extensively renovated in the 1990s.  It presents a regular season of opera performances.

In 1862 during [[Georges-Eugène Haussmann|Haussmann]]'s modernization of Paris the '''Théâtre de la Gaîté''' of the [[boulevard du Temple]] was relocated to the rue Papin across from the Square des Arts et Métiers.&lt;ref name=HistoricalVenue&gt;[http://www.gaite-lyrique.net/en/informations-pratiques/venue "History: The Venue, 150 Years in the Core of Paris"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323024255/http://www.gaite-lyrique.net/en/informations-pratiques/venue |date=2012-03-23 }} at the La Gaîté-Lyrique website. Retrieved 11 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The new theatre was needed to replace the company's previous theatre on the [[boulevard du Temple]], which had been slated for demolition to make way for the present [[Place de la République]] (Banham 1995, p. 120). The Square des Arts et Métiers, located adjacent to the [[boulevard de Sébastopol]], is now known as the {{Interlanguage link multi|Square Émile-Chautemps|fr|vertical-align=sup}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The new theatre, built in an Italian style to designs of the architects [[Jacques-Ignace Hittorff]] and [[Alphonse Cusin]], opened on 3 September.&lt;ref&gt;Simeone 2000, pp. 201, 203; [http://www.musee-orsay.fr/index.php?id=851&amp;L=1&amp;tx_commentaire_pi1%5BshowUid%5D=10550&amp;no_cache=1 Théâtre de la Gaîté  Alphonse-Adolphe Cusin], Théâtre de la Gaîté [[Musée d'Orsay]], 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Architectural&gt;[http://www.gaite-lyrique.net/en/informations-pratiques/venue-0 "Architectural Project: The Venue"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323024325/http://www.gaite-lyrique.net/en/informations-pratiques/venue-0 |date=2012-03-23 }} at the La Gaîté-Lyrique website. Retrieved 14 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a decade the focus began to shift from [[melodrama]] to [[operetta]] and [[opera]], so the theatre also came to be known as the '''Gaîté-Lyrique'''.&lt;ref&gt;The shift to operetta is mentioned by Banham 1995, p. 120; the new name is mentioned by Block 1881, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yfQoNtw4CKQC&amp;dq=%22Ga%C3%AEt%C3%A9-Lyrique%22&amp;pg=PA514#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Lyrique%22&amp;f=false vol. 38, p. 514].&lt;/ref&gt;
In the early 1920s Diaghilev's [[Ballets Russes]] danced here, and after [[World War II]] it was used for [[musical comedy]]. In the 1970s attendance decreased, and there were several attempts to find new uses for the building, culminating in 1989 in the construction of a short-lived amusement park, that resulted in the demolition of most of the theatre, except for the facade, entrance and foyer. The latter were restored during a 2004 reconstruction that converted the building into an arts centre, [[La Gaîté Lyrique]], completed in November 2010.&lt;ref name=HistoricalVenue/&gt;

==19th century==
[[Jacques Offenbach]] was the director of the Théâtre de la Gaîté from 1873 to 1874.&lt;ref name=Lamb&gt;Lamb 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; His [[opéra-bouffe]]-féerie  ''[[Le roi Carotte]]'' was first performed here in 1872 and his ''[[opéra-féerie]]'' ''[[Le voyage dans la lune]]'' in 1875. The opera ''[[Le timbre d'argent]]'' by [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] was premiered here in 1877, at which time the theatre was briefly known as the '''Théâtre National Lyrique'''.&lt;ref name=Timbre&gt;The piano-vocal score (Saint-Saëns 1877, pp. 1, 3) gives the theatre name as Théâtre National Lyrique. Boston Public Library 1916, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MEAQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA339#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 339], also gives that name and identifies Vizentini as the director. Harding 1980, p. 202, mentions that Vizentini produced an opera by Saint-Saëns at the theatre. Langham-Smith 1992, p. 874, and Levin 2009, p. 391, say the company name was changed to Opéra-National-Lyrique from 5 May 1876 to 2 January 1878. Levin also says Albert Vizentini was the director of the company from 1 July 1875 to 18 May 1878.&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==
[[File:Théâtre de la Gaîté 04.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Théâtre de la Gaîté on the rue Papin (detail of the facade)]]
[[Serge Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]] danced at the theatre in 1921, 1923, and 1925.&lt;ref name=Simeone/&gt; The 1921 performances included the ballerina [[Lydia Lopokova]] in the title role of [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Firebird]]'',&lt;ref name=Buckle&gt;Buckle 1979, pp. 381–382.&lt;/ref&gt; and the company gave premieres of [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]]'s ''[[Chout]]'' (17 May 1921) and Stravinsky's ''[[Les noces]]'' (13 June 1923).&lt;ref name=Simeone/&gt;

Beginning on 15 November 1932 Franz Lehár's ''[[The Land of Smiles]]'' was first performed in France. It was given in a French adaptation by [[André Mauprey]] and Jean Marietti with the title ''Le pays du sourire''.&lt;ref&gt;Bruyas, Florian (1974). ''Histoire de l'opérette en France, 1855–1965'' (in French), p. 517. Lyons: E. Vitte. {{OCLC|1217747}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch tenor [[Willy Thunis]], who did not speak a word of French, sang Sou-Chong.&lt;ref&gt;''Les Annales, Conferencia'', vol. 78 (1971), p. 45. {{ISSN|1766-3601}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The production received its 1,000th performance on 17 April 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Frey, Stefan (1999). ''Was sagt ihr zu diesem Erfolg: Franz Lehár und die Unterhaltungsmusik'' (in German), p. 416. Frankfurt: Insel Verlag Anton Kippenberg. {{ISBN|978-3-458-16960-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second World War]], the theatre was looted during the occupation. The large chandelier installed by Offenbach disappeared, as well the Emperor's golden coach, which had been stored in the service quarters.&lt;ref name=HistoricalVenue/&gt;

After the war Henri Montjoye (né Barbero) took over the theatre, and after his death in 1950, his widow, the soprano [[Germaine Roger]], became the theatre's director.&lt;ref&gt;"Roger, Germaine (d. 1975)" in Gänzl 2001, p. 1733.&lt;/ref&gt;
Numerous successes were put on. The 2-act operetta ''Andalousie'' by [[Albert Willemetz]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Raymond Vincy|fr}} with music by {{Interlanguage link multi|Francis Lopez|fr}} had a 12-month run that began on  25 October 1947.&lt;ref&gt;"Andalousie" in Gänzl 2001, pp. 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt;
The 2-act ''Colorado'' by Claude Dufresne, billed as an ''opérette à grand spectacle'' with music by [[Jacques-Henry Rys]] and lyrics by {{Interlanguage link multi|Jacques Larue|fr}}, starred the bass Armand Mestral (who alternated with Michel Dens) in the role of Jim Bullit, the tenor Lou Pizzara as Ricardo Diaz, the soprano Claude Chenard as Katharina Sanders, and Maurice Baquet as the little saloon pianist. The show opened on 16 December 1950 and ran for 11 months. It was revived at the theatre beginning on 12 February 1959 with Mestral and Baquet reprising their roles and Bernard Alvi as Ricardo and Andrée Grandjean as Katharina. It later went on tour and received provincial productions up into the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;"Colorado" in Gänzl 2001, p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt;
''Visa pour l'amour'', a vehicle for two of Paris's biggest musical comedy stars, the tenor [[Luis Mariano]] and the comedian [[Annie Cordy]], was a 2-act ''opérette gaie'' with music by Lopez and a book by Vincy. It premiered in December 1961 and received around 600 performances.&lt;ref&gt;"Visa pour l'amour" in Gänzl 2001, p. 2144.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Théâtre de la Gaîté 03.jpg|thumb|right|Théâtre de la Gaîté on the rue Papin (upper facade)]]

In the 1970s the ''[[Théâtre Silvia-Monfort|Carré Silvia-Monfort]]'' presented contemporary theatre, and some singers and a circus school, the Cirque Gruss, who offered their spectacles in the facing square, based themselves here for a time, and converted the attic of the theatre into stables for elephants.&lt;ref name=HistoricalVenue/&gt;&lt;ref name=Doussot&gt;Doussot et al 2009, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QIQKJDslWw0C&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 24].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s the dome of the main auditorium was threatening to collapse and was reinforced with concrete. In 1989 much of the theatre was demolished and transformed into an [[amusement park]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Planète magique|fr|vertical-align=sup}}, by [[Jean Chalopin]].&lt;ref name=HistoricalVenue/&gt; The main auditorium, originally holding 1800,&lt;ref&gt;Galignani 1884, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dl0EAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA234#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 234].&lt;/ref&gt; and the orchestra pit, apparently  large enough for 60 musicians,&lt;ref&gt;Faris 1980, p. 169, says that Offenbach's lavish 1874 revival of ''Orphée aux enfers'' included an orchestra of 60.&lt;/ref&gt; were among the parts of the building lost at this time. The venture was a failure and closed in 1991.&lt;ref name=Doussot/&gt; [[Manuelle Gautrand]], the architect who was in charge of the later restoration of the surviving parts of the theatre as well as the reconstruction and modernization of the demolished interior spaces, described the scene as follows: "The historical foyer and the lobby had been stripped of their original style and had been redecorated with vulgar colors and statues", and the amusement park itself was "an incredible accumulation of monumental sets, combining  pieced together dragons, rockets from the 80s, the world of Barbie, treasure hunts among the Incas…. A sort of 'low tech Disneyland' in the centre of Paris".&lt;ref name=Architectural/&gt;

In December 2003 restoration work began, and in December 2010 [[La Gaîté Lyrique]] was re-opened as a digital arts and modern music centre.&lt;ref name=HistoricalVenue/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10519">[[File:Typosquatting.png|thumb|right|240px|An incorrectly entered URL could lead to a website operated by a cybersquatter.]]
'''Typosquatting''', also called '''URL hijacking''', a '''sting site''', or a '''fake URL''', is a form of [[cybersquatting]], and possibly [[brandjacking]] which relies on mistakes such as [[typo]]s made by Internet users when inputting a [[uniform resource locator|website address]]  into a [[web browser]]. Should a user accidentally enter an incorrect website address, they may be led to any URL (including an alternative website owned by a cybersquatter).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/strider/urltracer/Parked_Domains.htm |title=Microsoft Strider project with screenshots of typosquatted domains |publisher=Research.microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307214501/http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/strider/urltracer/Parked_Domains.htm |archivedate=2012-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The typosquatter's [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] will usually be one of five kinds, all similar to the victim site address (e.g. [[example.com]]):

* A common misspelling, or foreign language spelling, of the intended site: {{sic|hide=y|exem|ple.com}}
* A misspelling based on [[Typographical error|typos]]: {{sic|hide=y|exam|lpe.com}}
* A differently phrased domain name: examples.com
* A different [[top-level domain]]: example.org
* An abuse of the [[Country code top-level domain|Country Code Top-Level Domain (ccTLD)]]: example.cm by using [[.cm]], example.co by using [[.co]], or example.om by using [[.om]]. A person leaving out a letter in [[.com]] in error could arrive at the fake [[URL]]'s website.

Once in the typosquatter's site, the user may also be tricked into thinking that they are in fact in the real site, through the use of copied or similar logos, website layouts or content. Spam emails sometimes make use of typosquatting URLs to trick users into visiting malicious sites that look like a given bank's site, for instance.

==Motivation==
There are several different reasons for typosquatters buying a typo domain:
* In order to try to sell the typo domain back to the brand owner
* To [[Monetization|monetize]] the domain through [[advertising]] revenues from direct navigation misspellings of the intended domain
* To redirect the typo-traffic to a competitor
* To redirect the typo-traffic back to the brand itself, but through an affiliate link, thus earning commissions from the brand owner's affiliate program.
* As a [[phishing]] scheme to mimic the brand's site, while intercepting passwords which the visitor enters unsuspectingly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Typosquatting': How 1 mistyped letter could lead to ID theft|url=http://www.bankrate.com/finance/credit/typosquatting-identity-theft.aspx|website=Bankrate|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To install drive-by [[malware]] or revenue generating [[adware]] onto the visitors' devices
* To harvest misaddressed e-mail messages mistakenly sent to the typo domain
* To block malevolent use of the typo domain by others
* To express an opinion that is different from the intended website's opinion

==Examples==
Many companies, including [[Verizon]], [[Lufthansa]], and [[Lego]], have garnered reputations for aggressively chasing down typosquatted names. Lego, for example, has spent roughly US$500,000 on taking 309 cases through [[Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy|UDRP]] proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://domainnamewire.com/2011/11/01/has-legos-500k-spent-on-urdp-been-a-waste/ | work=Domain Name Wire | title=Internet | date=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Celebrities have also frequently pursued their domain names, from singers to star athletes. Prominent examples include basketball player Dirk Nowitzki's UDRP of DirkSwish.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://domainnamewire.com/2011/09/12/dallas-mavericks-dirk-nowitzki-domain/ | work=Domain Name Wire | title=Internet | date=12 Sep 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and actress Eva Longoria's UDRP of EvaLongoria.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://domainnamewire.com/2011/05/05/eva-longoria-adds-org-to-her-collection/ | work=Domain Name Wire | title=Internet | date=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2006, a typosquatted variant of [[Google]] called 'Goggle.com' has existed which was considered a phishing/fraud site; later (ca. 2011–2012) the URL redirected to google.com,&lt;ref name="Goggle"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Allemann|first1=Andrew|title=Google Wants to Take Down Goggle.com Web Site|url=http://domainnamewire.com/2011/08/23/google-wants-to-take-down-goggle-com-web-site/|accessdate=19 March 2017|work=Domain Name Wire|date=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a 2018 check revealed it to redirect users to adware pages. Another example of corporate typosquatting is ''yuube.com'', targeting [[YouTube]] users by having it programmed to [[URL redirection|redirect]] to a malicious website or page, that asks users to add a security check extension that is really malware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/infotech/internet/Typosquatters-roam-unchecked-in-India/articleshow/5884936.cms | work=The Times Of India | title=Internet | date=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, ''www.[[Air France|airfrance]].com'' has been typosquatted by ''www.arifrance.com'', diverting users to a website peddling discount travel.&lt;ref name=slavitt&gt;Kelly M. Slavitt: [http://library.findlaw.com/2004/May/11/133410.html Protecting Your Intellectual Property from Domain Name Typosquatters] (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples are ''Equifacks.com'' ([[Equifax]].com), ''Experianne.com'' ([[Experian]].com), and ''TramsOnion.com'' ([[TransUnion]].com); these three typosquatted sites were registered by comedian [[John Oliver (comedian)|John Oliver]] for his show ''[[Last Week Tonight with John Oliver|Last Week Tonight]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mediaite.com/online/john-oliver-creates-fake-web-sites-to-troll-major-three-credit-bureaus/&lt;/ref&gt;

Users trying to visit the popular internet-based game ''[[Agar.io]]'' may misspell the said URL as ''agor.io''. Visiting this site was known to produce a [[jumpscare]] or screamer of the popular [[creepypasta]] ''[[Jeff the Killer]]'', which flashed rapidly and produced a loud noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetoptens.com/scariest-websites-internet/|title=Top Scariest Websites on the Internet|last=|first=|date=|website=TheTopTens|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original site was taken down and as of 2017, it has linked to randomly-themed [[phishing]] websites.

==In United States law==
In the United States, the 1999 [[Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act]] (ACPA) contains a clause (Section 3(a), amending 15 USC 1117 to include sub-section (d)(2)(B)(ii)) aimed at combatting typosquatting.&lt;ref&gt;"Anti-CyberSquatting Protection Act." US Library of Congress, [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c106:S.1255.IS:= Thomas.loc.gov], accessed 24 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Without typosquatters, how far would Google fall?" Cade Metz, The Register, [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/10/23/google_and_typosquatting/ Theregister.co.uk], accessed 24 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on April 17, 2006, controversial evangelist [[Jerry Falwell]] failed to get the U.S. Supreme Court to review a decision allowing Christopher Lamparello to use www.fallwell.com. Relying on a plausible misspelling of Falwell's name, Lamparello's [[gripe site]] presents misdirected visitors with scriptural references that are intended to counter the fundamentalist preacher's scathing rebukes against [[homosexuality]]. In [[Lamparello v. Falwell]], the high court let stand a 2005 [[United States Circuit Court|Fourth Circuit]] finding that "the use of a mark in a domain name for a gripe site criticizing the markholder does not constitute cybersquatting."

==WIPO resolution procedure==
Under the [[Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy]] (UDRP), [[trademark]] holders can file a case at the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) against typosquatters (as with cybersquatters in general).&lt;ref name=slavitt/&gt; The complainant has to show that the registered domain name is identical or [[Confusing similarity|confusingly similar]] to their trademark, that the registrant has no legitimate interest in the domain name, and that the domain name is being used in [[bad faith]].&lt;ref name=slavitt/&gt;

The '''Virginia Film Festival''' is hosted by the College and Graduate School of Arts &amp; Sciences at the [[University of Virginia]] in [[Charlottesville]], held usually in late October or early November.

== History ==

Created in the late 1988, the Virginia Festival of American Film (renamed The Virginia Film Festival) was endorsed by the state’s Department of Economic Development and adopted by the University of Virginia. The intent was twofold: to stimulate economic development by encouraging film production in Virginia and increasing tourism, and to meld the creative interests and crafts of the American film industry with the intellectual resources of a nationally ranked university.  In 1996, the University decided to make the Virginia Film Festival a more integral part of its academic program under the umbrella of the College and Graduate School of Arts &amp; Sciences.  The focus was expanded to encompass a broader range of international films. The Festival also expanded its year-round programs, including a very active Film Society that presents films and guest speakers at the downtown Vinegar Hill Theatre.

In 2009, Jody Kielbasa was brought on as the new director of the Virginia Film Festival.

From 1990 through 2009, Virginia Film Festival chose a different theme each year, on which to base its film program. Past themes are listed below.  Starting in 2010, the Festival announced its intention to leave the themed approach in favor of more flexible programming. The VFF celebrated its 25th Anniversary in 2012.

* 1990 - "Music &amp; The Movies"
* 1991 - "Movie Made In America"
* 1992 - "The Reel South &amp; Other Worlds"
* 1993 - "[[Film Noir]]"
* 1994 - "Love &amp; Other Obsessions"
* 1995 - "U.S. &amp; Them"
* 1996 - "Wild Spaces, Endangered Places"
* 1997 - "Caged!"
* 1998 - "Cool"
* 1999 - "Techno Visions"
* 2000 - "Animal Attractions"
* 2001 - "Masquerades"
* 2002 - "Wet"
* 2003 - "$$$"
* 2004 - "Speed"
* 2005 - "In/Justice"
* 2006 - "Revelations"
* 2007 - "Kin Flicks"
* 2008 - "Aliens!"
* 2009 - "Funny Business"

'''William Dodd Hathaway''' (February 21, 1924{{spaced ndash}}June 24, 2013) was an American politician and lawyer from [[Maine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/hathaway.html#081.04.43 |title= William Dodd Hathaway entry |author= Kestenbaum, Lawrence |year= 2009  |website= [[Political Graveyard]] |accessdate= October 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Hathaway was born in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. He served in [[World War II]] in the [[United States Army Air Corps]], where he was shot down while bombing the [[Ploiești]], [[Romania]] oil fields during [[Operation Tidal Wave]] and was a prisoner of war for over two months. He was awarded the [[Air Medal]], the [[Purple Heart]], and the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]].

After the war he attended [[Harvard University]], graduating in 1949, and [[Harvard Law School]], graduating in 1953. He then moved to Maine and practiced law in [[Lewiston, Maine|Lewiston]].

==Political career==
He served as Assistant County Attorney for [[Androscoggin County, Maine|Androscoggin County]] from 1955 to 1957, and he was a Hearing Examiner for the State Liquor Commission from 1957 to 1961.

A [[Maine Democratic Party|Democrat]], in 1964 he was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House]] from the [[Maine's 2nd congressional district|2nd District]], and he served from 1965 until 1973. This was a time of resurgence for Democrats in Maine, at that time a traditionally [[Maine Republican Party|Republican]] state. The same period saw the growth of the political careers of [[Edmund S. Muskie]] and [[Kenneth M. Curtis]].

In 1972 Hathaway ran for the [[United States Senate]] and defeated four-term Republican incumbent [[Margaret Chase Smith]]. In 1973, Hathaway was one of the three senators who opposed the nomination of [[Gerald Ford]] to be [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]]. (The other two were [[Thomas Eagleton]] and [[Gaylord Nelson]].)  Hathaway was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1978, losing to his successor in the 2nd District, future [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[William Cohen]], by 22 percentage points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statistics of the Congressional Election of November 7, 1978|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/1978election.pdf|website=Clerk of the House of Representatives|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Hathaway resided in the [[Washington, DC]], area after leaving the Senate and worked as a lobbyist and lawyer.&lt;ref name="BDN"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2013/06/24/politics/sen-king-mourns-passing-of-former-maine-sen-william-hathaway/|title=Former Maine Sen. William Hathaway dead at 89|date=June 24, 2013|work=[[Bangor Daily News]]|accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 he was appointed by President [[George H. W. Bush]] to the [[Federal Maritime Commission]], and he served as Chairman from 1993 to 1996.

Hathaway was known and loved by the employees of the Senate, especially the Senate elevator operators. He was a constant source of humor and good will to those that worked on the Capitol elevators. "Going Up" is an unpublished manuscript by Kerry Whitney, US Senate Elevator Operator.

He retired in 1996 and continued to live in the Washington, DC, area.

In June 2002, at the age of 78, Hathaway was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for heroism during [[Operation Tidal Wave]].&lt;ref&gt;http://capitolwords.org/date/2002/06/25/S6009-2_award-of-the-distinguished-flying-cross-to-former-/&lt;/ref&gt;

Hathaway was married to Mary Lee Bird of [[Horse Shoe, North Carolina]], and [[Akron, Ohio]], for over 61 years until her death, in 2007. Hathaway had two children, Susan and Fred.

Hathaway died of pulmonary fibrosis&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/us/politics/william-hathaway-senator-from-maine-dies-at-89.html?ref=obituaries]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kjonline.com/politics/Former-Maine-Senator-has-passed-away.html&lt;/ref&gt; exactly 69 years to the day after he was shot down during World War II.

{{History of Israel}}

'''Yehud''' had been a province of the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] since the [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|suppression]] of the Judean rebellion in 585/6 BCE. It first existed as a Jewish administrative division of the Neo-Babylonian Empire under [[Gedaliah]], though it quickly became depopulated after his murder and another unsuccessful revolt around 581/2 BCE. The province was [[Yehud Medinata|absorbed into the Achaemenid Empire]] with the collapse of the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 539 BCE.

==Background==
{{main|Kingdom of Judah}}
In the late 7th century BCE Judah became a vassal-kingdom of the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]]; however, there were rival factions at the court in Jerusalem, some supporting loyalty to Babylon, others urging rebellion. In the early years of the 6th century, despite the strong remonstrances of the prophet [[Jeremiah]] and others, king [[Zedekiah]] revolted against [[Nebuchadrezzar]] and entered into an alliance with pharaoh [[Apries|Hophra]] of [[Egypt]]. The revolt failed, and in 597 BCE many Judahites, including the prophet [[Ezekiel]], were [[Babylonian captivity|exiled to Babylon]]. A few years later Judah revolted yet again. In 589 Nebuchadnezzar again [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|besieged Jerusalem]], and many Jews fled to [[Moab]], [[Ammon]], [[Edom]] and other countries to seek refuge. The city fell after an eighteen-month siege and Nebuchadnezzar again pillaged and destroyed Jerusalem and burned the [[Temple of Solomon|Temple]]. Thus, by 586 BCE much of Judah was devastated, the royal family, the priesthood, and the scribes—the country's elite—were in exile in Babylon, and much of the population still in neighouring countries. the former kingdom suffered a steep decline of both economy and population.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lester L. Grabbe]], ''A History of the Jews and Judaism in the Second Temple Period - Vol 1: A History of the Persian Province of Judah'' (2004)] {{ISBN|0-567-08998-3}}, p.28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Babylonian era (587–539 BCE )===
{{see|Gedaliah}}
The former kingdom of Judah then became a Babylonian province, with [[Gedaliah]], a native Judahite but not of the royal [[David]]ic dynasty, as governor (or possibly ruling as a puppet king). According to Miller and Hayes, the province included the towns of Bethel in the north, [[Mizpah in Benjamin|Mizpah]], Jericho in the east, Jerusalem, [[Beth-Zur]] in the west and [[En-Gedi]] in the south.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;James Maxwell Miller and John Haralson Hayes, ''A History of Ancient Israel and Judah'' (1986) {{ISBN|0-664-21262-X}}, p.xxi, 425.&lt;/ref&gt; The administrative centre of the province was Mizpah, and not Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Kings|25:22–24|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Jeremiah|40:6-8|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; On hearing of the appointment, the Jews that had taken refuge in surrounding countries returned to Judah.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Jeremiah|40:11–12|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Gedaliah was assassinated by a member of the former royal house, and the Babylonian garrison killed, triggering a mass movement of refugees to Egypt.&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Kings|25:26|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Jeremiah|43:5–7|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Egypt, the refugees settled in [[Migdol]], [[Tahpanhes]], [[Noph]], and [[Pathros]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Jeremiah|44:1|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jeremiah went with them as moral guardian.

Although the dates are not clear from the Bible, this probably happened about 582/1 BCE,{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lipschits|first=Oded|date=1999-08-01|title=The History of the Benjamin Region under Babylonian Rule|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1179/tav.1999.1999.2.155|journal=Tel Aviv|volume=26|issue=2|pages=155–190|doi=10.1179/tav.1999.1999.2.155|issn=0334-4355}}&lt;/ref&gt;some four to five years and three months after the destruction of Jerusalem and the [[Solomon's Temple|First Temple]] in 586 BCE. &lt;!---If Mizpah was [[Tell en-Nasbeh]] on the [[Shechem]] road, Ishmael would not have fled to Ammon via [[Gibeon (ancient city)|Gibeon]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1141.htm Jeremiah 41:10-12] Mechon Mamre&lt;/ref&gt; which is located to the West near [[Tomb of Samuel|Neby Samwil]] ("Tomb of Samuel"), which overlooks Jerusalem. Furthermore, [[Judas Maccabeus]], preparing for war with the Syrians, gathered his men "to Maspha, over against Jerusalem: for in Maspha was a place of prayer heretofore in Israel".&lt;ref&gt;1 Mach., 3:46, cited in {{CathEncy|wstitle=Maspha}}&lt;/ref&gt;---&gt;

===Transfer to Persian rule===
{{main|Yehud Medinata}}

==Demographics==
{{further|Babylonian captivity}}
The numbers deported to Babylon or who made their way to Egypt, and the remnant that remained in Yehud province and in surrounding countries, is subject to academic debate. The [[Book of Jeremiah]] reports that a total of 4,600 were [[Babylonian captivity|exiled to Babylon]]. To these numbers must be added those deported by Nebuchadnezzar in 597 BCE following the [[Siege of Jerusalem (597 BC)|first siege to Jerusalem]], when he deported the king of Judah, [[Jeconiah]], and his court and other prominent citizens and craftsmen, along with a sizable portion of the Jewish population of Judah, numbering about 10,000. The [[Books of Kings|Book of Kings]] also suggests that it was eight thousand.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}} [[Israel Finkelstein]], a prominent archaeologist, suggests that the 4,600 represented the heads of households and 8,000 was the total, whilst 10,000 is a rounding upwards of the second number.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}} Jeremiah also hints that an equivalent number may have fled to Egypt. Given these figures, Finkelstein suggests that 3/4 of the population of Judah had remained.
