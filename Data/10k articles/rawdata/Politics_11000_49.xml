'''ARPA-E''', or '''Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy''' is a [[United States government]] agency tasked with promoting and funding research and development of advanced energy technologies. It is modeled after the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA).

==History and mission==

===Legislative history===
The concept of ARPA-E was initially conceived by a report by the [[National Academies of the United States|National Academies]] entitled ''Rising Above the Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future''.  The report recognized a U.S. need to stimulate innovation and develop clean, affordable, and reliable energy.&lt;ref&gt;ARPA-E  FY2010 Annual Report, http://arpa-e.energy.gov/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=JPgM-ETf-o0%3d&amp;tabid=438.&lt;/ref&gt;  ARPA-E was officially created by the [[America COMPETES Act]] &lt;!-- H.R. 364 ? --&gt;, authored by Congressman [[Bart Gordon]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/5325?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22America+Competes+Act+2007%22%5D%7D&lt;/ref&gt; within the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE) in 2007, though without a budget.  The initial budget of about $400 million was a part of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|economic stimulus bill]] of February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Stimulus: Energy Department scrambles to build new R&amp;D agency |author= George Leopold |work= [[EE Times]] |url= http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4081448/Stimulus-Energy-Department-scrambles-to-build-new-R-D-agency |accessdate= August 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Then in early January 2011, the [[America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010]] made additional changes to ARPA-E’s structure; this structure is codified in Title 42, Chapter 149, Subchapter XVII, § 16538 of the United States Code.

Among its main provisions, Section 16538 provides that ARPA-E shall achieve its goals through energy technology projects by doing the following:

# Identifying and promoting revolutionary advances in fundamental and applied sciences;
# Translating scientific discoveries and cutting-edge inventions into technological innovations; and
# Accelerating transformational technological advances in areas that industry by itself is not likely to undertake because of technical and financial uncertainty.

=== Mission ===
Like DARPA does for military technology, ARPA-E is intended to fund high-risk, high-reward research that might not otherwise be pursued because there is a relatively high risk of failure.&lt;ref name="About ARPA-E"&gt;{{cite web|title=About ARPA-E|url=http://arpa-e.energy.gov/About/Team.aspx|work=ARPA-E}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Like DARPA, it is intended to fund projects involving government labs, private industry, and universities.  ARPA-E has four objectives:

# To bring a freshness, excitement, and sense of mission to energy research that will attract the U.S.'s best and brightest minds; 
# To focus on creative, transformation energy research that the industry cannot, or will not support due to its high risk, but that has high reward potential; 
# To utilize an ARPA-like organization that is flat, nimble, and sparse, capable of sustaining for long periods of time those projects whose promise remains real, while phasing out programs that do not prove to be as promising as anticipated; and 
# To create a new tool to bridge the gap between basic energy research and development/industrial innovation.&lt;ref name="About ARPA-E"/&gt;

=== Launch ===
President [[Barack Obama]] announced the launch of the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) on April 27, 2009 as part of an announcement about federal investment in research and development and science education. Soon after its launch, ARPA-E released its first [[Funding Opportunity Announcement]] for the new agency, offering $151 million in total with individual awards ranging from $500,000 to $9 million. Applicants submitted eight-page "concept papers" that outlined the technical concept; some were invited to submit full applications.&lt;ref name="apr09"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/news/news_detail.cfm/news_id=12478 |title=DOE Launches the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, or ARPA-E |date=April 29, 2009 |work=EERE news |accessdate=August 14, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716123810/http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/news/news_detail.cfm/news_id%3D12478 |archivedate=16 July 2011 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arun Majumdar]], former deputy director of the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]], was appointed the first director of ARPA-E in September 2009, over six months after the organization was first funded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://newscenter.lbl.gov/press-releases/2009/09/18/arpa-e-nomination/ |title=White House nominates Berkeley Lab’s Majumdar to head key DOE agency |date=September 18, 2009 |work=Berkeley Lab News Center |accessdate= August 14, 2011 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110716080234/http://newscenter.lbl.gov/press-releases/2009/09/18/arpa-e-nomination/| archivedate= 16 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[U.S. Secretary of Energy]] [[Steven Chu]] presided over the inaugural "ARPA-E Energy Innovation Summit" on  March 1–3, 2010  in [[Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Department of Energy Announces Inaugural ARPA-E Energy Innovation Summit |work= EERE news |date= January 7, 2010 |url= http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/news/progress_alerts.cfm/pa_id=282 |accessdate= August 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ARPA-E and EERE ==
ARPA-E was created to fund energy technology projects that translate scientific discoveries and cutting-edge inventions into technological innovations, and accelerate technological advances in high-risk areas that industry is not likely to pursue independently. This goal is similar to the work of the U.S. Department of Energy's [[Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy|Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)]] which advances clean energy projects according to established roadmaps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://energy.gov/eere/downloads/eere-strategic-plan|title=EERE Strategic Plan {{!}} Department of Energy|website=energy.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; ARPA-E does not fund incremental improvements to existing technologies; nor roadmaps established by existing DOE programs.

== Project creation and the review process ==

ARPA-E programs are created through a process of rigorous debate surrounding the technical/scientific merits and challenges of potential research areas and must satisfy both concepts of “technology push”—the technical merit of innovative platform technologies that can be applied to energy systems—and “market pull”—the potential market impact and cost-effectiveness of the technology.

=== Project creation ===
{{ad|date=August 2018}}
The detailed program creation process begins with a “deep dive”: a process of thoroughly exploring an aspect of the energy problem to identify potential topics for program development. ARPA-E Program Directors then hold technical workshops to gather input from the world’s leading experts about current state-of-the-art technologies and new technological opportunities that lie on the horizon. By bringing together experts from all walks of science, technology, and business, ARPA-E breaks down silos between disciplines. This cross-disciplinary inquiry is essential to bridge the gap between basic and applied 
research and development. ARPA-E workshops bring together the best and the brightest to identify technical challenges and opportunities that connect science to technology and markets—linking knowledge of what science is capable of to what technology can achieve and what the market needs. To date, ARPA-E has hosted or co-hosted 13 technical workshops.

Following each workshop, the Program Director proposes a new program and defends the program against a set of criteria that justifies its creation. After intense, “constructive confrontation” and debate involving all ARPA-E Program Directors, the Program Director refines the program, incorporating internal and external feedback, and seeks approval from the Director. If successful, a new ARPA-E program is created, and a solicitation, or funding opportunity announcement (FOA), is released, soliciting project proposals.

=== Peer review process ===

The ARPA-E peer review process is designed to help drive toward subsequent program success. During proposal review, ARPA-E solicits external inputs to make sure that it is funding the best technologies. ARPA-E taps the expertise of dozens of the leading experts in the world in a particular field for in-depth proposal reviews. The involvement of world-class scientists, engineers, and leaders from the technical community brings expertise and knowledge to the process. ARPA-E reviewers evaluate applications over several weeks, and 
then come together for a review panel.

One notable facet of ARPA-E’s evaluation process is the opportunity for the applicant to read reviewers’ comments and to provide a rebuttal that the Agency reviews before making funding decisions. The applicant response period allows ARPA-E to avoid misunderstandings by asking clarifying questions that enable ARPA-E to make the most informed decisions during the project selection process and identify the most compelling and meritorious ideas for support.&lt;ref&gt;ARPA-E FY2010 Annual Report, http://arpa-e.energy.gov/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=JPgM-ETf-o0%3d&amp;tabid=438.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding and awards ==

=== First funding opportunity ===
The U.S. Department of Energy and ARPA-E awarded $151 million in [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]] funds on October 26, 2009 for 37 energy research projects. It supported [[renewable energy]] technologies for [[solar cell]]s, [[wind turbine]]s, [[geothermal drilling]], [[biofuel]]s, and [[biomass energy crop]]s. The grants also supported [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] technologies, including [[power electronics]] and [[engine-generator]]s for [[advanced vehicle]]s, devices for [[waste heat recovery]], [[smart glass]] and control systems for [[smart building]]s, [[light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs), [[reverse-osmosis membrane]]s for [[water desalination]], [[catalyst]]s to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, improved [[fuel cell]] membranes, and more energy-dense [[magnetic material]]s for electronic components. Six grants went to [[energy storage]] technologies, including an [[ultracapacitor]], improved [[lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion batteries]], [[metal-air battery|metal-air batteries]] that use [[ionic liquid]]s, [[liquid sodium battery|liquid sodium batteries]], and [[liquid metal battery|liquid metal batteries]].&lt;ref name="energy1"&gt;{{cite news |title= Bold, Transformational Energy Research Projects Win $151 Million in Funding |work= EERE news |date= October 26, 2009 |url= http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/news/progress_alerts.cfm/pa_id=258 |accessdate= August 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="energy2"&gt;{{cite news |title= Secretary Chu Announcement of $151 Million in ARPA-E Grants |url= http://energy.gov/articles/secretary-chu-announcement-151-million-arpa-e-grants |date= October 26, 2009 |accessdate= August 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="energy3"&gt;{{cite news |title= ARPA-E Project Selections |date= October 26, 2009 |url= https://www.energy.gov/news2009/documents2009/ARPA-E_Project_Selections.pdf |deadurl=yes |archivedate= May 27, 2010 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100527161846/http://www.energy.gov/news2009/documents2009/ARPA-E_Project_Selections.pdf  |accessdate= August 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other awards went to projects that conducted research and development on a [[bioreactor]] with potential to produce gasoline directly from sunlight and carbon dioxide, and [[crystal growth]] technology to lower the cost of [[Light-emitting diode|light emitting diodes]].&lt;ref name="energy1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="energy2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="energy3"/&gt;

=== Second funding opportunity ===
The U.S. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu announced a second round of ARPA-E funding opportunities on December 7, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;ARPA-E Timeline, {{cite web|url=http://arpa-e.energy.gov/About/History.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328005010/http://www.arpa-e.energy.gov/About/History.aspx |archivedate=2012-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ARPA-E solicited projects that focused on three critical areas: Biofuels from Electricity (Electrofuels), Batteries for Electrical Energy Storage in Transportation (BEEST), and Innovative Materials and Processes for Advanced Carbon Capture Technologies (IMPACCT). On April 29, 2010, Vice President Biden announced the 37 awardees that ARPA-E had selected from over 540 initial concept papers.&lt;ref name="arpa-e.energy.gov"&gt;Vice President Biden Announces Recovery Act funding for 37 Transformation Energy Research Projects, {{cite web|url=http://arpa-e.energy.gov/media/news/tabid/83/vw/1/itemid/21/vice-president-biden-announces-recovery-act-funding-for-37-transformational-energy-research-projects.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309140134/http://arpa-e.energy.gov/media/news/tabid/83/vw/1/itemid/21/vice-president-biden-announces-recovery-act-funding-for-37-transformational-energy-research-projects.aspx |archivedate=2012-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The awards ranged from around $500,000 to $6,000,000 and involved a large variety of national laboratories, universities, and companies.&lt;ref&gt;ARPA-E Project Selections, April 29, 2010, http://arpa-e.energy.gov/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=mK6vhQztzb4%3d&amp;tabid=83&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Second Funding Opportunity, project submissions were designated by category, unlike the first funding opportunity; of the selected projects, 13 projects focused on Electrofuels, 10 projects focused on BEEST, and 14 project focused on IMPAACT.  For example, Harvard Medical School submitted a project under Eletrofuels entitled, "Engineering a Bacterial Reverse Fuel Cell," which focuses on development of a bacterium to use electricity to convert carbon dioxide into gasoline.  MIT received an award under BEEST for a proposal entitled "Semi-Solid Rechargeable Fuel Battery," which is a concept idea for a new battery that combines the best characteristics of rechargeable battery and fuel cells to produce lighter, smaller, and cheaper vehicle batteries. IMPAACT awarded projects such as GE's Global Research Center's "CO2 Capture Process Using Phase-Changing Absorbents," which focuses on a liquid that turns into a solid powder when reacting with carbon dioxide.&lt;ref name="arpa-e.energy.gov"/&gt;

=== Third funding opportunity ===

On March 2, 2010, at the inaugural ARPA-E Energy Innovation Summit, U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu announced a third funding opportunity for ARPA-E projects.  Like the second funding opportunity, ARPA-E solicited projects by category: Grid-Scale Rampable Intermittent Dispatchable Storage (GRIDS), Agile Delivery of Electrical Power Technology (ADEPT), and Building Energy Efficiency Through Innovative Thermodevices (BEET-IT).  GRIDS welcomed projects that focused on widespread deployment of cost-effective grid-scale energy storage in two specific areas: 1) proof of concept storage component projects focused on validating new, over-the-horizon electrical energy storage concepts, and 2) advanced system prototypes that address critical shortcomings of existing grid-scale energy storage technologies.  ADEPT focused on investing in materials for fundamental advances in soft magnetics, high voltage switches, and reliable, high-density charge storage in three categories: 1) fully integrated, chip-scale power converters for applications including, but not limited to, compact, efficient drivers for solid-state lighting, distributed micro-inverters for photovoltaics, and single-chip power supplies for computers, 2) kilowatt scale package integrated power converters by enabling applications such as low-cost, efficient inverters for grid-tied photovoltaics and variable speed motors, and 3) lightweight, solid-state, medium voltage energy conversion for high power applications such as solid-state electrical substations and wind turbine generators.  BEET-IT solicited projects regarding energy efficient cooling technologies and air conditioners (AC) for buildings to save energy and reduce GHG emissions in the following areas:  1) cooling systems that use refrigerants with low global warming potential; 2) energy efficient air conditioning (AC) systems for warm and humid climates with an increased coefficient of performance (COP); and 3) vapor compression AC systems for hot climates for re-circulating air loads with an increased COP.&lt;ref&gt;DOE Announces $100 Million Available for Innovative Research, {{cite web|url=http://arpa-e.energy.gov/media/news/tabid/83/vw/1/itemid/19/doe-announces-%24100-million-available-for-innovative-research-projects.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309142001/http://arpa-e.energy.gov/media/news/tabid/83/vw/1/itemid/19/doe-announces-%24100-million-available-for-innovative-research-projects.aspx |archivedate=2012-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secretary Chu announced the selection of 43 projects under GRIDS, ADEPT, and BEET-IT on July 12, 2010. The awards totaled $92 million and ranged from $400,000 to $5,000,000.  The solicitation distribution included 14 projects in ADEPT,  17 projects in BEET-IT, and 12 projects in GRIDS.  Examples of awarded projects include a "Soluble Acid Lead Flow Battery" that pumps chemicals through a battery cell when electricity is needed (GRIDS), "Silicon Carbide Power Modules for Grid Scale Power Conversion" that uses advanced transistors to make the electrical grid more flexible and controllable (ADEPT), and an "Absorption-Osmosis Cooling Cycle," a new air conditioning system that uses water as a refrigerant, rather than chemicals (BEET-IT).&lt;ref&gt;Department of Energy Awards $92 Million for Groundbreaking Research Projects, {{cite web|url=http://arpa-e.energy.gov/media/news/tabid/83/vw/1/itemid/22/department-of-energy-awards-%2492-million-for-groundbreaking-energy-research-projects.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309141646/http://arpa-e.energy.gov/media/news/tabid/83/vw/1/itemid/22/department-of-energy-awards-%2492-million-for-groundbreaking-energy-research-projects.aspx |archivedate=2012-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fourth funding opportunity ===

ARPA-E's fourth round of funding was announced on April 20, 2011 and awarded projects in five technology areas: Plants Engineered To Replace Oil (PETRO), High Energy Advanced Thermal Storage (HEATS), Rare Earth Alternatives in Critical Technologies (REACT), Green Electricity Network Integration (GENI), and Solar Agile Delivery of Electrical Power Technology (Solar ADEPT).  PETRO focused on projects that had systems to create biofuels from domestic sources such as tobacco and pine trees for half their current cost. REACT funded early-stage technology alternatives that reduced or eliminated the dependence on rare earth materials by developing substitutes in two key areas: electric vehicle motors and wind generators.  HEATS funded projects that promoted advancement in thermal energy storage technology.  GENI focused on funding software and hardware that could reliably control the grid network.  Solar ADEPT accepted projects that integrated power electronics into solar panels and solar farms to extract and deliver energy more efficiently.

The Awardees for the fourth funding opportunity were announced on September 29, 2011.  The 60 projects received $156 million from the ARPA-E Fiscal Year 2011 budget.  Examples of the awarded projects included a project that increases the production of turpentine, a natural liquid biofuel (PETRO); a project entitled "Manganese-Based Permanent Magnet," that reduces the cost of wind turbines and electric vehicles by developing a replacement for rare earth magnets based on an innovative composite using manganese materia (REACT); a project entitled "HybriSol," that develops a heat battery to store energy from the sun (HEATS); a project that develops a new system that allows real-time, automated control over the transmission lines that make up the electric power grid (GENI); and a project that develops light-weight electronics to connect to photovoltaic solar panels to be installed on walls or rooftops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arpa-e.energy.gov/media/news/tabid/83/vw/1/itemid/39/department-of-energy-awards-%24156-million-for-groundbreaking-energy-research-projects.aspx |title=Department of Energy Awards $156 Million for Groundbreaking Research Projects |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326104640/http://arpa-e.energy.gov/media/news/tabid/83/vw/1/itemid/39/department-of-energy-awards-%24156-million-for-groundbreaking-energy-research-projects.aspx |archivedate=2012-03-26 |accessdate=February 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Albert J. Cheng''' was born in Hong Kong on 3 July 1946, a Fellow of the [[Hong Kong Institute of Engineers]], past chairman and present Director of the Aircraft Division.

== Canadian connections==
Cheng landed in Canada in 1969 to work initially as an aircraft engineer. He became a Canadian citizen four years later.

A founding member and former director of the Vancouver Chinese Cultural Centre, Cheng was seconded from the former Canadian Pacific Air to co-ordinate the fund-raising initiative to build the Chinese Cultural Centre, which stands as the largest Chinese community amenity in North America.

Cheng is the founder and founding president of the Chinese Canadian Association in Hong Kong, which later established the [[Canadian International School of Hong Kong]]. The school, which offers the Canadian curriculum, opened its door to 81 students in 1991, educating more than 1,800 students of over 40 nationalities from pre-reception to Grade 12. It has now been expanded into Mainland China. The Canadian International School of Beijing was founded in 2005 and has students from over 70 countries.

After Commercial Radio had dismissed him under political pressure, he gave up his [[Canadian citizenship]] in 2004 to comply with local election requirements for direct elections to the Legislative Council of Hong Kong. Despite his absence from Canada, Cheng has doubled up for the past 20 years as a commentator for overseas Chinese voice (AM 1470 CJVB /AM 1320 CHMB), a multicultural radio station in Vancouver.  His commentaries are syndicated across overseas Chinese-speaking communities in North America and Australia.

In 1986, he launched Capital Communications Corporation to publish the Chinese editions of international titles, such as the ''Capital'', ''Playboy'' and ''Forbes'' magazines, Chinese edition.  The company was merged with Paramount Publishing Group in 1991 (a public listed company) to become the largest publishing and printing house in the region.

Cheng was appointed as consultant for a wide spectrum of key institutions in Hong Kong, including the Land Development Council, Mass Transit Railway Corporation, Hong Kong Jockey Club, Trade Development Council, PCCW, Futures and Security Commission and Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

He was a member of the Securities &amp; Futures Commission's Public Shareholders Group. Cheng also led the Hong Kong Expo' 97 Initiative Committee in 1988.

== Democracy and social justice==
In May 1989, over a million Hong Kongers took to the streets to rally for the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|pro-democracy student movement in Tiananmen Square in Beijing]]. The Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the Democratic Patriotic Movements of China was established during the massive protests. Cheng is a co-founder of this multi-sectorial umbrella civil body to back the Chinese students' demand for democracy and a clean government.

The peaceful demonstrations in Tiananmen Square ended in a bloody military crackdown, which shook Hong Kong and the world.  Cheng then went on to form the Right of Abode Delegation, with Hong Kong leading businessmen to press London for full British passports for Hong Kong people as a political insurance policy. The campaign resulted in right of abode in Britain for some 50,000 Hong Kong people. The move helped boost confidence in Hong Kong's future.

As an activist, he was instrumental in mobilising mass opposition in 2002 to the Hong Kong Government's Central and Wan Chai Reclamation Project, which was regarded as environmental-unfriendly and a threat to Hong Kong's renown Victoria Harbor. He was behind a judicial review that resulted in stopping the reclamation in Central.

Cheng was opposed to the privatisation of the government's shopping malls and car parks in its public housing estates. He was concerned that the ill-considered move would undermine the interests of the low-income public housing tenants, especially the elderly ones. He strived in vain to stop the related listing of the [[Link REIT]] on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2005. Now a decade later, the Chief Executive of the HKSAR Government, [[Leung Chun-ying]], has proven Cheng right by denouncing Link REIT as failing to fulfill its social responsibilities.

He was a vocal force in the Legislative Council. He tackled vital issues such as the opening up of the public airwaves, imposing tighter tobacco control, introducing food labelling, and regulating against unscrupulous practices in the sales of residential flats.

Cheng was appointed by the Chief Executive of the HKSAR for four years to serve on the Independent Police Complaints Council, which is tasked with monitoring the review by the Complaints Against Police Office of complaints against members of the Police Force.  During his tenure, Cheng served as the Chairman of the Publicity Committee.

He has been cherished as a people's hero in mobilising civil efforts in the fight against the SARS epidemics in 2003. He had single-handedly raised some HK$100&amp;nbsp;million in the social movement against SARS.

== Freedom of speech==
In 1994, Cheng co-hosted the ground-breaking political talk show "News Tease" on [[Asia Television]] which set the trend of current affairs commentary programmes in the local electronic media. He was under pressure to leave the business sector because of his candid political remarks. Apart from ATV, he also hosted current affairs talk shows on Cable TV and Now TV.

A year later, he left Paramount Publishing Group and Capital Communications to become a full-time host of Commercial Radio's breakfast talk-back show "Teacup in a Storm,” which emerged swiftly as the most popular programme in town. He was branded the "Chief Executive before 10 am" because of his outspoken criticisms of government bureaucracy, public policy failures and social injustice. He spoke for the social under dogs and pressed the authorities into action on matters of public concern. In 1998, he was ambushed by hired thugs and sustained serious injuries outside the station on his way to work.  Premier Glen Clark of British Columbia visited him in the hospital during his official visit to Hong Kong. The same year, Premier Clark introduced him to the BC assembly, where he was recognised.  For ten years (1995–2004), he had ruled the airwaves to take on vested interests and bureaucracies.

Despite his vast popularity, Cheng's contract with Commercial Radio was terminated abruptly and unilaterally in 2004 as the station buckled under political pressure in the run-up to the renewal of its broadcasting license. There was writing in the wall that the authorities were seeking to restrain freedom of speech in the territory.

Cheng then ran for a place in the legislature. He won a seat in the Legislative Council and continued to champion freedom of speech and other civil liberties in his hat as a directly-elected legislator. He chaired the Panel on Information Technology and Broadcasting of the law-making body and promoted an "open sky" policy for the electronic media.

In 2008, Cheng announced that he would not seek re-election to Legco to avoid possible conflict of interests in his efforts to apply for a license to operate a radio station. His Wave Media was awarded a license in 2009 to prepare for Hong Kong’s first Digital Audio Broadcast service, under the banner of [[Digital Broadcasting Corporation]] (DBC).

He ran into a major argument with other shareholders as he insisted on an independent editorial policy that is critical of government failings. He founded [[D100 Radio (Hong Kong)|D100 Radio]], an online multi-media operation, after leaving his role as DBC chairman. D100 is now reckoned as a legendary social enterprise and Chinese platform on the Internet.

The electronic and new media aside, Cheng is also a veteran contributor to the news publications. He has been penning regular English and Chinese columns for the reputable ''South China Morning Post'' and ''Hong Kong Economic Journal'' for over 20 years.

== Newspaper columns and publishing==
Cheng is a prolific writer, whose many columnists have often set and define the social agenda in Hong Kong.

He has been a columnist for the ''Ming Pao Weekly'', ''Hong Kong Economic Journal'' and ''South China Morning Post'' since 1999. He has written from time to time to promote Canadian values and culture.

Cheng was a board member of the Hong Kong Audit Bureau of Circulation (HKABC). He also served as board member, treasurer, chairman of the Society of Hong Kong Publishers from 1988 to 1990.  He has been served as a trustee of the Foundation of Businesses in Support of the Arts since 1990.

== Charity and community service==
Cheng is a voting member of the ''Hong Kong Jockey Club''. The Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust has been ranked sixth in the World Charity Index 2015 for its charitable contributions, which reached a record HK$3.87 billion in 2014–15, supporting 189 charitable and community projects. The Club is the first Asian charity donor to be listed in the world’s top 10.

He also sat on another major charity in Hong Kong, the [[The Community Chest of Hong Kong|Community Chest]]. He was a member of the Public Relations Committee and Corporate &amp; Employee Contribution Programme Organizing Committee of the Community Chest, which is a statutory body functioning as an umbrella organisation to provide grants to a wide range of community projects.

In 1996, the Senior Citizen Home Safety Association (SCHSA) was founded by Albert Cheng, Dr. C.K. Law (GBS, JP), and a group of individuals, in response to a prolonged cold spell during which more than one hundred elderly living alone were found dead. The association is a self-financing social enterprise and charitable organization in Hong Kong that offers 24-hour personal caring and emergency assistance services to the elderly and others.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

From 2003 to 2004, Cheng served as a member of the Securities &amp; Futures Commission Public Shareholders Group to advise on issues relating to safeguarding shareholders' rights and interests.

Cheng was chairman of the second Hong Kong Film Awards Organizing Committee in 1984. He was a member of the Hong Kong Film Development Council from 2011 to 2013 to advise the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development on relevant policies and activities, including manpower training, Mainland and overseas promotion, and support for the film industry.

== Academic service==
Cheng acts as Asia adviser to the Provost and responsible for establishing the Greater China Scholarship of the University of Notre Dame, a Catholic research institute founded in 1842 in Indiana, USA. He was on the board of Hong Kong Shue Yan University's academic advisory board and curriculum vetting committee.

He was a governor and honorary development director of the [[English Schools Foundation]] (ESF), the biggest international educational foundation in Asia which runs 22 educational institutions mostly international schools in Hong Kong.
 
Cheng was also a vetting committee member for the digital media courses of the Vocational Training Council, the largest vocational and professional education and training provider serving 250,000 students a year in Hong Kong.

He was honorary vice-president of the Economic &amp; Finance Society of the University of Hong Kong, and honorary advisor of the Society of Business Administration of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1799">The '''Alliance Laurentienne''' was a political organization founded by [[Raymond Barbeau]] on January 25, 1957. It was an early organization of the [[Quebec sovereignty movement|contemporary independence movement of Quebec]] but, unlike the majority of those to come, it adopted somewhat [[right-wing politics|right-wing]], even [[corporatism|corporatist politics]]. It was also attached to the [[Catholicism|Catholic faith]], as opposed to the [[secularism]] of most future [[Quebec sovereignty movement|sovereigntist]] groups. Its manifesto is however a proponent of love between peoples and ethnicities.

Its own vision of a "Free Quebec" was called "[[Laurentie (concept)|Laurentie]]" (thus the name of the movement) and from 1957 to 1962, it published [[Laurentie (magazine)|a magazine under that title]]. The independence intellectual [[André D'Allemagne]] was one of its members before, frustrated with its right-wing tendencies, he left to create the [[Rassemblement pour l'indépendance nationale]] (RIN). The RIN, officially neutral on the [[Left-Right politics|left-right spectrum]], had many militants with beliefs ranging from [[socialism]] to [[social democracy]].

{{Refimprove|date=September 2009}}

The '''anti-Stalinist left''' comprises various kinds of [[left-wing politics]] critical of [[Joseph Stalin]], of [[Stalinism]] as a political philosophy, and of the actual [[History of the Soviet Union (1927-1953)|system of governance Stalin implemented]] as dictator of the Soviet Union.

It may also refer to left-wing opposition to [[dictatorships]], [[cult of personality|cults of personality]], [[totalitarianism]] and [[police state]]s, features commonly attributed to [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] regimes, such as [[Kim Il Sung]], [[Enver Hoxha]], [[Mao Zedong]], [[Fidel Castro]], and others, including in the former [[Eastern Bloc]].&lt;ref&gt;Dennis H Wrong [https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/the-american-left-and-cuba/ The American Left and Cuba] ''Commentary'' FEB. 1, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Julius Jacobson]] [https://www.workersliberty.org/story/2009/08/02/reflections-fascism-and-communism Reflections on Fascism and Communism]. ''Socialist Perspectives'', Edited by Phyllis Jacobson and Julius Jacobson, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Farber, [https://zcomm.org/znetarticle/nothing-if-not-critical-by-alejandro-anreus/ Cuba since the Revolution of 1959: A Critical Assessment], Chicago: Haymarket Books, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trotskyism ==
{{main article|Trotskyism}}
[[File:Diego rivera Commies.jpg|thumb|A [[Diego Rivera]] mural (''[[Man, Controller of the Universe]]'') depicts Trotsky with Marx and Engels as a true champion of the workers' struggle.]]
Associates and followers of [[Leon Trotsky]] were organised in the [[Left Opposition]] within the Communist parties before they were purged in the [[Moscow Trials]] in the 1930s. Trotskyist differ from most other ideological manifestations on the "anti-Stalinist left" in that they, like Marxist-Leninists, also claim to be [[Leninists]]. Subsequently, his followers formed the [[Fourth International]] in opposition to the Stalinist [[Third International]]. Trotsky saw the Stalinist states as [[deformed workers' state]], where a political structure gave most workers very little power in decision making.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/document/fi/1950-1953/fi-3rdcongress/1951-congress08.htm "Class Nature of Eastern Europe"] Resolution Adopted by the Third Congress of the Fourth International—Paris, April 1951&lt;/ref&gt;

Trotsky and his followers were very critical of the lack of internal debate among Stalinist organizations and societies and political repression enacted by Stalinist governments (i.e., [[The Great Purge]]); nationalist elements of Stalinist theory (the [[Socialism in One Country]] thesis, for example, adopted by Stalin as state policy), that led to a very poor revolutionary strategy in an international contest (and breaking with the [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] traditions of [[Marxism]]); and its dictatorial, bureaucratic, [[obscurantist]], personalistic, and high repressive methods (which Trotsky called "inquisitorial", in a speech that was read and broadcast in English). Less orthodox [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]] and other critics of Stalin have seen it as a new form of class state, called [[bureaucratic collectivism]] ([[James Burnham]], [[Milovan Đilas]], and [[Max Shachtman]]) or as [[state capitalist]] ([[Tony Cliff]], [[C. L. R. James]], and [[Raya Dunayevskaya]].).&lt;ref&gt;Martin Oppenheimer  [https://www.digger-journal.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Martin-Oppenheimer-The-%E2%80%9CRussian-Question%E2%80%9D-and-the-U.S.-Left.pdf The “Russian Question” and the U.S. Left], Digger Journal, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Left communism ==
The [[Left communism|communist left]] was initially enthusiastic about the [[Bolshevik revolution]], but lines of tension between the communist left and the leadership of the [[Communist International]] opened up very soon. Left communists such as [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg#Criticism of the October Revolution|Rosa Luxemburg]] were among the first left-wing critics of [[Bolshevism]]. Left communists see communism as something that can only be achieved by the [[proletariat]] itself, and not through the dictatorship of a [[vanguard party]] acting on its behalf. (See also [[council communism]], [[Marxist humanism]], [[ultra-left]], [[luxemburgism]].)

== Anarchism ==
[[Anarchism|Anarchists]] like [[Emma Goldman]] were initially enthusiastic about the Bolsheviks, particularly after dissemination of [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s pamphlet ''[[State and Revolution]]'', which had painted Bolshevism in a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] light. However, the relations between the anarchists and the Bolsheviks soured in Soviet Russia (e.g. in the suppression of the [[Kronstadt rebellion]] and the [[Makhnovist]] movement). Anarchists and Stalinist Communists were also in armed conflict during the [[Spanish civil war]]. Anarchists are critical of the statist, [[totalitarian]] nature of Stalinism (and [[Marxism-Leninism]] in general), as well as its [[cult of personality]] around Stalin (and subsequent leaders seen by anarchists as Stalinists, such as [[Kim Il Sung]] or [[Mao Zedong]]).

== Democratic socialism ==
A significant current of the [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] movement has defined itself in opposition to Stalinism. This includes [[George Orwell]], [[H. N. Brailsford]],&lt;ref&gt;F. M. Leventhal, ''The Last Dissenter: H.N. Brailsford and His World'',
Oxford University Press, 1985, {{ISBN|0-19-820055-2}}  (pp. 248–49).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fenner Brockway]],&lt;ref&gt;"Brockway ... sought to articulate a socialism distinct from the pragmatism of Labour and the Stalinism of the "Communist Party".David Howell, "Brockway, (Archibald) Fenner, Baron Brockway" in  H.C.G. Matthew and Brian Harrison (eds.) ''[[Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]: From the Earliest Times to the Year 2000''. {{ISBN|0-19-861411-X}}  (Volume Seven, pp. 765–66)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Corthorn, ''In the shadow of the dictators: the British Left in the 1930s''. Tauris Academic Studies, 2006, {{ISBN|1-85043-843-9}}, (p. 125).&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Independent Labour Party]] in Britain (particularly after World War II). There were also a number of anti-Stalinist socialists in France, including writers such as [[Simone Weil]]&lt;ref&gt;"In August 1933 Weil carried these reflections further in a widely read article in the avant-garde, anti-Stalinist Communist review ''Revolution proletarienne''... John Hellman, ''Simone Weil:An Introduction to her thought''. Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 1982 {{ISBN|0-88920-121-8}} (p.21)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Albert Camus]]&lt;ref&gt;"From well before the Algerian war the Communists in particular held against Camus not so much his anti-Stalinism as his growing refusal to share political "positions" or get into public arguments..." Quoted in [[Tony Judt]],''The Burden of Responsibility: Blum, Camus, Aron, and the French Twentieth Century''. University of Chicago Press, 2007 {{ISBN|0-226-41419-1}} (p. 92)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the group around [[Marceau Pivert]]. In America, [[the New York Intellectuals]] around the journals ''[[Partisan Review]]'' and ''[[Dissent (American magazine)|Dissent]]'' saw Soviet Communism as a form of [[totalitarianism]] in some ways mirroring [[fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Isserman [https://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/steady-work-sixty-years-of-dissent Steady Work: Sixty Years of Dissent: A history of Dissent magazine], ''Dissent'', January 23, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The New York Intellectuals are often described as being part of the origins of the [[neoconservative]] movement.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

== Right Opposition ==
Another major split in the international Communist movement was that between Stalin and the [[Right Opposition]], led by [[Nikolai Bukharin]]. In several countries parallel Communist parties were formed that either were rejected by the [[Comintern]] or distanced themselves from it. Their criticism did in some ways become similar to positions raised by the Trotskyists, but as a tendency they were far less coherent. The Right Opposition developed contacts with other groups that did not fit into either the international [[Social democracy]] or Comintern, such as the Independent Labour Party in Britain. This tendency largely died out at the time of the Second World War. In other cases dissident Marxist trends developed outside of the established Communist movement, such as the [[Revolutionary Socialist Party (India)|Anushlian Marxists]] in India.

== Titoism ==
At first, the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] and the regime it established through the successful war of liberation against the Axis invaders by the [[partisan (military)|partizan]]s was modeled on that of Soviet Union, and [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]] was considered to be "[[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s most faithful pupil". However, in 1948, the two leaders broke apart and Tito's aides (most notably [[Edvard Kardelj]], [[Milovan Đilas]], and [[Moša Pijade]]) began a theoretical effort to develop a new brand of Socialism that would be both [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] in nature and anti-Stalinist in practice. The result was the Yugoslav system of socialist [[workers' self-management]], also known as [[Titoism]], based on the organizing of every productive activities of society into "self-managed units".

Đilas, particularly, wrote extensively against Stalinism and was radically critical of the bureaucratic apparatus built by Bolshevism in the Soviet Union. He later grew critical of his own regime as well and became a dissident in Yugoslavia. He was imprisoned but later pardoned.

== Non-Communist Left ==
"Non-Communist Left", or NCL, was a designation used in the U.S. [[State Department]] and [[United States Central Intelligence Agency|Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) referring mainly to leftist intellectuals who had become disillusioned by Stalin.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, ''Cultural Cold War'' (1999), pp. 62–63. "The Agency had been toying with an idea for a while now: who better to fight the Communists than former Communists? In consultation with Koestler, this idea now began to take shape. The destruction of the Communist mythos, he argued, could only be achieved by mobilizing those figures on the left who were non-Communist in a campaign of persuasion. The people of whom Koestler spoke were already designated as a group—the Non-Communist Left—in the State Department and intelligence circles."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.|Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.]] highlighted the group's growing power in a popular 1948 essay titled "Not Right, Not Left, But a Vital Center".&lt;ref name="Vital Center"&gt;{{cite news|last=Schlesinger, Jr.|first=Arthur M.|title=Not Right, Not Left, But a Vital Center|url=http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/50s/schlesinger-notrightleft.html|accessdate=19 September 2012|newspaper=New York Times Magazine|date=4 April 1948|authorlink=Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another key publication was ''[[The God that Failed]]'' (1948), a compilation of essays from six former Communists who remained on the left.

[[File:CIA_floor_seal.png|thumb|A major international strain of anti-Stalinism was sponsored by the CIA]]

Winning over and harnessing the power of the NCL became central to the US propaganda struggle against the USSR during the early [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, ''Cultural Cold War'' (1999), p 63.&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy directly inspired the creation of the [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]] (CCF), as well as international journals like [[Melvin J. Lasky|''Der Monat'']] and ''[[Encounter (magazine)|Encounter]]''; it also influenced existing publications such as the ''[[Partisan Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, ''Cultural Cold War'' (1999), pp. 162. "The headquarters of 'professional' anti-Stalinism was the American Committee for Cultural Freedom, and the magazines whose editors who sat on its board, namely ''Commentary'', the ''New Leader'' and ''Partisan Review''."&lt;/ref&gt;

Under these auspices (and consequently in fashionable intellectual circles in the US and Europe), anti-Stalinism became "almost a professional stance", "a total outlook on life, no less, or even a philosophy of history."&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Rahv]], quoted in: Saunders, ''Cultural Cold War'' (1999), pp. 161–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent figures in this group include [[Arthur Koestler]], [[Melvin J. Lasky]], [[Dwight Macdonald]], [[Sidney Hook]], [[Stephen Spender]], [[Nicolas Nabokov]], and [[Isaiah Berlin]]. (The NCL notably excluded [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] because it could not accept his individualistic existentialist views.)&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, ''Cultural Cold War'' (1999), p 121. "Sartre was the enemy not just because of his position on Communism, but because he preached a doctrine (or anti-doctrine) of individualism which rubbed against the federalist 'family of man' society which America, through organizations like the Congress for Cultural Freedom, was promoting. (The Soviet Union, by the way, found Sartre equally uncongenial, branding existentialism 'a nauseating and putrid concoction.')"&lt;/ref&gt; Key organizers of the CIA's Non-Communist Left operation, titled QKOPERA, included [[Frank Wisner]], Lawrence de Neufville, [[Thomas Braden]], [[Charles Douglas Jackson|C.D. Jackson]], and Michael Josselson.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, ''Cultural Cold War'' (1999), pp. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; (Other supporters within the intelligence community included [[George F. Kennan]], [[W. Averell Harriman]], and General [[Lucius D. Clay]].)&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, ''Cultural Cold War'' (1999), pp. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

The NCL began to lose its cohesion and its appeal to the CIA during the radicalism of the late 1960s. [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|Opposition to the Vietnam War]] fractured the coalition, and 1967 revelations of CIA funding (by ''Ramparts'' and others) were embarrassing for many of the intellectuals involved. Soon after the story broke, Braden (with tacit support from the CIA) wrote an article in the Saturday Evening Post which exposed CIA involvement with the Non-Communist Left and organized labor.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, ''Cultural Cold War'' (1999), pp. 401–402. "Richard Helms, who was now director of the CIA, was, according to Rostow's memo, aware of the article, and conceivably of its contents also. The CIA had ample time to invoke its secrecy agreement with Braden, and prevent him publishing the piece."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Braden 1967"&gt;{{cite news|last=Braden|first=Thomas|title=I'm glad the CIA is 'immoral'|url=http://www.cambridgeclarion.org/press_cuttings/braden_20may1967.html|accessdate=19 September 2012|newspaper=Saturday Evening Post|date=20 May 1967|authorlink=Thomas Braden|pages=10–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argued that this article represented an intentional and final break of the CIA with the NCL.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, ''Cultural Cold War'' (1999), pp. 398–399.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The New Left ==
The emergence of the [[New Left]] and the [[new social movements]] in the 1950s and 1960s led to a revival of interest in alternative forms of [[Marxism]]. Figures associated with British [[cultural studies]] (e.g., [[Raymond Williams]]), Italian [[autonomism]] and [[workerism]] (e.g., [[Antonio Negri]]), French groups like the [[Situationist International]] (e.g., [[Guy Debord]]) and [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]] (e.g., [[Cornelius Castoriadis]]) as well as the magazine '' [[Telos (journal)|Telos]]'' in America, were examples of this.

An anti-Stalinist left emerged in the former Soviet bloc in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Andy Blunden 1993 [https://www.marxists.org/subject/stalinism/origins-future/ch5-1a.htm The Class Struggle in Russia: III: The Left in Russia] ''Stalinism: It's Origin and Future''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hillel H.

The '''Antiquities Act''' of 1906, ({{USPL|59|209}},  {{USStat|34|225}}, {{usc|54|320301|320303}}), is an [[Act of Congress|act]] passed by the [[United States Congress]] and signed into law by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] on June 8, 1906. This law gives the President of the United States the authority to, by [[presidential proclamation]], create [[National Monument (United States)|national monuments]] from [[public land| federal land]]s to protect significant natural, cultural, or scientific features. The Act has been used more than a hundred times since its passage.

==History==
The Antiquities Act was signed into law by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] during his second term in office. The act resulted from concerns about protecting mostly prehistoric Native American ruins and artifacts--collectively termed "[[antiquities]]"--on federal lands in the West, such as at [[Chaco Culture National Historical Park|Chaco Canyon, New Mexico]]. Removal of artifacts from these lands by private collectors, "pot hunters," had become a serious problem by the end of the 19th century. In 1902, [[Iowa]] Congressman [[John F. Lacey]], who chaired the House Committee on the Public Lands, traveled to the Southwest with the rising [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Edgar Lee Hewett]], to see for himself the extent of the pot hunters' impact.  His findings, supported by an exhaustive report by Hewett to Congress detailing the archaeological resources of the region, provided the necessary impetus for the passage of the legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | title=The National Parks: America's Best Idea | publisher=Florentine Films | people=Ken Burns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Antiquities Act became law, all but four presidents, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, and George H.W. Bush have chosen to enlarge or dedicate new national monuments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Americian Antiquities Act of 1906|url=https://www.nps.gov/subjects/legal/american-antiquities-act-of-1906.htm|website=National Park Service|accessdate=March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Obama in his last term in office erected the most monuments than any President before him, with 26. The previous record was held by President Theodore Roosevelt with 18 monuments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kraft|first1=Michael|last2=Vig|first2=Norman|title=Environmental Policy New Directions for the Twenty-First Century|date=2017|publisher=Sage|edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

On April 26, 2017, President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing a review of the law and its uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Merica|first1=Dan|title=Trump order could roll back public lands protections from 3 presidents|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/25/politics/donald-trump-federal-lands-antiquities/index.html|website=CNN|publisher=CNN|accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
The Act was intended to allow the President to set aside certain valuable public natural areas as park and conservation land. The 1906 act stated that it was intended for: "... the protection of objects of historic and scientific interest." These areas are given the title of "[[U.S. National Monument|National Monuments]]."  It also allows the President to reserve or accept private lands for that purpose.  The aim is to protect all historic and prehistoric sites on United States federal lands and to prohibit excavation or destruction of these antiquities.  With this act, this can be done much more quickly than going through the Congressional process of creating a [[National Park]].  The Act states that areas of the monuments are to be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected.

The [[United States Supreme Court]] has repeatedly upheld presidential proclamations under the Antiquities Act, ruling each time that the Act gives the president nearly-unfettered discretion as to the nature of the object to be protected and the size of the area reserved.&lt;ref name="Cameron"&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/252/450/case.html Cameron v. United States], 252 U.S. 450&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cappaert"&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/426/128/case.html Cappaert v. United States], 426 U.S. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

Some areas designated as National Monuments have later been converted into National Parks, or incorporated into existing National Parks.

The first use of the Act protected a large geographic feature&amp;nbsp;– President Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed [[Devils Tower|Devils Tower National Monument]] on September 24, 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/deto/historyculture/upload/First%2050%20Years.pdf|title=Devils Tower First 50 Years|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=October 11, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531175438/http://www.nps.gov/deto/historyculture/upload/First%2050%20Years.pdf|archivedate=May 31, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Roosevelt also used it to create the Grand Canyon National Monument (now [[Grand Canyon National Park]]).

At {{convert|583000|sqmi|km2|-4}}, [[Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument]] is the largest protected area proclaimed.&lt;ref&gt;Papahānaumokuākea protects submerged land.  The largest surface reservation was the proclamation of [[Wrangell-St. Elias National Monument]], {{convert|10950000|acre|km2|-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The smallest, [[Father Millet Cross|Father Millet Cross National Monument]] (now part of a state park), was a mere {{convert|0.0074|acre|m2|-1}}.&lt;ref name="act"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Antiquites Act: Monument List |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/archeology/sites/antiquities/MonumentsList.htm |accessdate=May 20, 2009 |publisher=National Park Service Archeology Program |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090509202639/http://www.nps.gov/history/archeology/sites/antiquities/MonumentsList.htm| archivedate= May 9, 2009 | deadurl= no}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For any excavation, the Act requires that a permit (Antiquities Permit) be obtained from the Secretary of the department which has jurisdiction over those lands.

==Reduction of powers==
Presidential powers under the Act have been reduced twice.  The first time followed the unpopular proclamation of [[Jackson Hole National Monument]] in 1943.  The 1950 law that incorporated Jackson Hole into an enlarged [[Grand Teton National Park]] also amended the Antiquities Act, requiring Congressional consent for any future creation or enlargement of National Monuments in [[Wyoming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/hisnps/npshistory/righter.htm| title=National Monuments to National Parks: The Use of the Antiquities Act of 1906| author=Robert W.

Until August 2005, '''Britain in Europe''' was the main [[United Kingdom|British]] [[pro-European]] [[pressure group]].  Despite connections to [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], it was a cross-party organisation with supporters from many different political backgrounds.  Initially founded to campaign for a “Yes” vote for the [[euro]], it then progressed to support a “Yes” vote for the referendum on the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]].

The organisation was launched in 1999 by [[Tony Blair]], [[Gordon Brown]], [[Kenneth Clarke]], [[Michael Heseltine]] and [[Charles Kennedy]]. In 2003, the organisation formally linked itself with the [[Brussels]]-based, pro-European, international organisation [[European Movement]].

The director of Britain in Europe was Simon Buckby and later [[Lucy Powell]]. The director of communications was the [[Scottish Liberal Democrat]] politician [[Danny Alexander]].

On 17 August 2005, the group was wound up following the [[French European Constitution referendum, 2005|French]] and [[Dutch European Constitution referendum, 2005|Dutch]] "No" votes on the proposed [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]]. Its resources were turned over to the European Movement.

A successor pro-EU campaign, founded in 2012, is [[British Influence]].

The '''Canadian Action Party''' (CAP) ({{lang-fr|Parti action canadienne}}, '''PAC''') was a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Canadian confederation|federal]] [[political party]] founded in 1997 and deregistered on 31 March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=pol&amp;dir=par&amp;document=index&amp;lang=e#CAP|title=Registered Political Parties and Parties Eligible for Registration|last=Canada|first=Elections|language=en|access-date=2017-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party stood for [[Canadian nationalism]], [[monetary reform|monetary]] and [[electoral reform]], and opposed [[Neoliberalism#Opposition to economic liberalism|liberal globalization]] and [[free trade]] agreements that had been signed by the Canadian government.

== History ==
The Canadian Action Party (CAP) was founded by [[Paul Hellyer|Paul T. Hellyer]], a former [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]]  minister of defence in the [[Cabinet of Canada|cabinet]] of [[Lester B. Pearson]].  Hellyer ran unsuccessfully for the [[Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, 1968|leadership of the Liberal Party]] in 1968, and for the [[Progressive Conservative leadership election, 1976|leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party]] in 1976.

CAP nominated candidates for the first time in the [[Canadian federal election, 1997|1997 federal election]].

After the 1997 election, it absorbed the [[Canada Party]], another minor party concerned about monetary reform which had been formed by former members of the [[Social Credit Party of Canada]]. Former Canada Party leader Claire Foss served as vice president of CAP until November 2003.

Hellyer resigned as CAP leader in 2003 after the [[New Democratic Party]] didn't agree to a merger proposal, under which the NDP would change its name. In 2004, Connie Fogal, an activist lawyer, was acclaimed party leader after [[David Orchard]] failed to respond to an invitation to take over the leadership. Fogal stepped down in 2008 and was succeeded by [[Andrew J. Moulden]] following the [[Canadian federal election, 2008|2008 federal election]].

The acting Chief Electoral Officer of Canada advised the party leader that the party will be deregistered effective Friday, March 31, 2017, for not having at least 250 members who are eligible voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://finance.yahoo.com/news/deregistration-canadian-action-party-175735025.html|title=Deregistration of the Canadian Action Party|last=|first=|date=27 February 2017|work=Marketwired|access-date=2017-09-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228092322/http://finance.yahoo.com/news/deregistration-canadian-action-party-175735025.html|archive-date=2017-02-28|dead-url=yes|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Positions ==

A number of CAP members also belonged to the [[Committee on Monetary and Economic Reform]] (COMER) and had been influential in developing CAP's monetary policy, particularly its position that the [[Bank of Canada]], rather than chartered banks, should provide loans to the government, if required, to fund public spending.

CAP also argued for the abrogation of [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), and opposed current government trade initiatives and any legislation leading to the [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] (FTAA), [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] (TPP) and what it saw as integration with the [[United States]] and [[Mexico]] into a [[North American Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.canadianactionparty.org/#!economy-/c9p5|title=canadianactionparty.org|website=www.canadianactionparty.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=September 2017}}

'''Center for Democracy &amp; Technology''' (CDT) is a [[Washington, D.C.]]-based [[501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit]] organization whose mission is to strengthen individual rights and freedoms by defining, promoting, and influencing technology policy and the architecture of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/31/technology/31privacy.html | work=The New York Times | title=Technology Coalition Seeks Stronger Privacy Laws | first=Miguel | last=Helft | date=March 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an organization with expertise in law, technology, and policy, CDT works to preserve the unique nature of the Internet, enhance freedom of expression globally, protect fundamental rights of privacy, and stronger legal controls on government surveillance by finding practical and innovative solutions to public policy challenges while protecting civil liberties. CDT is dedicated to building consensus among all parties interested in the future of the Internet and other new communications media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_NN1uGn1Jd8C&amp;pg=PR12|title=Privacy in Context: Technology|publisher=|date= 2009-11-24|accessdate=August 24, 2010|isbn=9780804772891  |author1=Nissenbaum  |first1=Helen  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to its D.C. office, CDT has a full-time presence in [[Brussels]].

==Founding and Approach==
In 1994, CDT was founded by Jerry Berman, the former executive director and former policy director of the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]. The battle against applying the [[Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act]] (CALEA) to the Internet - expanding law enforcement wiretapping capabilities by requiring telephone companies to design their networks to ensure a certain basic level of government access - spurred the creation of CDT in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://highlights.cdt.info/moment/calea |title=CDT Timeline |publisher=Highlights.cdt.info |date= |accessdate=2014-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606214516/http://highlights.cdt.info/moment/calea |archivedate=2014-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing a threat to privacy and innovation in CALEA's design mandates, CDT fought the passage of the CALEA and later worked to ensure that its implementation would not extend to the Internet. In the end, CALEA did not contain wiretapping design mandates for the Internet and required transparency surrounding design standards. CDT's launch was assisted by seed donations from [[AT&amp;T Corporation]], [[Bell Atlantic]], [[Nynex]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], and [[Microsoft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/E-journals/CWD/941220.cwd | work=Cyberwire Dispatch | title=Changes in the Wind At EFF | first=Brock | last=Meeks | date=December 20, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, CDT has expanded its scope to include tech policy issues across disciplines and borders, continuing to work to protect privacy, promote security, and draw attention to all the ways in which technology changes the landscape of democracy. CDT utilizes an expertise-based advocacy model and acts as a non-partisan body, drawing together perspectives and voices from varying backgrounds to emphasize the importance of technology's role in the freedom, expression, security, privacy, and integrity of the individual. CDT advises government officials, agencies, corporations, and civil society on technology and technology-related policy.

==Historical Background==

=== 1994-1999 ===

In its early years, CDT fought the [[Communications Decency Act]] (CDA) in its attempt to restrict free expression online for the sake of child safety. CDT founded the Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition (CIEC), a coalition of free speech groups and tech companies for the advancement of free speech. Against the proposed government censorship of the CDA, the CIEC maintained that both child safety and free speech could be protected by giving users the right to control their own content access.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://highlights.cdt.info/moment/cda|title=CDT Highlights|last=|first=|date=|website=CDT Highlights, iStrategyLabs|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To provide further context for the case, CDT wired the courtroom so that the judges of Philadelphia's District Court could see the Internet.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After combining forces with the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]], the CIEC's counsel argued the case before the Supreme Court. The Communications Decency Act was struck down unanimously in 1997.

In the following year, CDT helped to craft the [[Children's Online Privacy Protection Act]]. Testifying before Congress, CDT argued that the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) should be able to develop rules to protect both adults' and children's privacy online. Forming a coalition of free expression and youth rights groups, CDT and its coalition secured an amendment to limit parental consent to children 12 and under, allowing teenagers to enjoy more freedom online.

In a 1999 report, CDT made clear that the [[Federal Election Commission|Federal Election Commission's]] (FEC) attempts to regulate online political speech according to campaign finance laws were impractical and to the detriment of civic political engagement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; CDT worked against the FEC's proposal with an organized group of online activists and bloggers. In collaboration with the Institute for Politics, Democracy, and the Internet, CDT created guidelines to help the FEC and Congress consider their treatment of citizens' political speech online. In support, hundreds of concerned parties signed onto the listing of principles, urging the FEC to drop its proposed rules and Congress to end the rule-making.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; CDT's grassroots advocacy reversed the tide. The FEC abandoned its proposal and issued a new rule that applied campaign finance regulations only to paid online advertising, protecting the online political speech of citizens.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===2000-2007===

CDT launched the Global Internet Policy Initiative in 2000, partnering with [[Internews]] to survey 11 developing countries to assess their telecom and Internet policies. CDT staff worked with [[Frank LaRue]] to shape a report on Internet human rights and the U.S. Ambassador to the UN Human Rights Council to educate members of the Council on Internet freedom in advance of the successful Resolution on Internet Freedom.

Following an influx of [[spyware]] in 2003, CDT filed complaints against egregious actors with the FTC, resulting in historic settlements against spyware companies. CDT pulled together anti-spyware and anti-virus companies, leading security product distributors, and public interest groups to create the [[Anti-Spyware Coalition]] (ASC).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/public_statements/anti-spyware-coalition/060209cdtspyware_0.pdf|title=Remarks of Deborah Platt Majoras|last=|first=|date=February 9, 2006|website=The Federal Trade Commission|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ASC developed a self-regulatory model for companies based on shared definitions of spyware, a comprehensive risk model, best practices for software companies, and a concise vendor conflict resolution process.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Using the ASC outputs, anti-spyware companies could label malicious software and protect consumers without fear of being sued by the companies they were targeting, and advertisers could keep better track of where their advertisements were displayed.

In 2006, CDT united with the Business for Social Responsibility to assemble human rights advocates, companies, researchers, and investors to deal with government calls for censorship and restriction of information access.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The pairing has successfully worked together to create an accountability framework and principles for the [[Global Network Initiative]] (GNI), a human rights organization that promotes the privacy of individual users while preventing online censorship by authoritarian governments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2007, CDT was among the first advocacy organizations to formally call for a Do Not Track (DNT) list from the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.techlawjournal.com/topstories/2007/20071031.asp|title=CDT Proposes That FTC Create a Do Not Track List for Consumer Internet Use|last=|first=|date=October 31, 2007|website=Tech Law Journal|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, CDT has played an integral role in pushing for a standardized DNT header at the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt/|title=Tracking Preference Expression (DNT)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the FTC requested a system that would allow consumers to control whether they were tracked online. In response, all five major browsers put DNT features into place, granting users to ability to surf the web incognito. The W3C formed a Tracking Protection Working Group in order to standardize the DNT compliance, which CDT leadership had a prominent role in.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/2011/tracking-protection/|title=Tracking Protection Working Group|last=|first=|date=|website=W3C.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008-2012===

CDT has also voiced privacy concerns over the practice of “[[deep packet inspection]]” (DPI), which allows companies to collect data from Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and categorize individual Internet traffic streams to service ads based on that information without user consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.techrepublic.com/article/deep-packet-inspection-the-smart-persons-guide/|title=Deep packet inspection: The smart person's guide|last=|first=|date=March 9, 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; CDT conducted legal analysis to show how DPI advertising practices could violate the [[Electronic Communications Privacy Act]] (ECPA) and testified before Congress. In 2009, major ISPs affirmed that they would not use DPI-based behavioral advertising without very robust opt-in provisions. In the same year, CDT started the Health Privacy Project to bring expertise to complex privacy issues surrounding technology use in health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/new-health-privacy-project-launched|title=New Health Privacy Project is Launched|last=|first=|date=March 11, 2008|website=Healthcare IT News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, CDT recommended new guidelines for reporting data breaches and for protecting health data used in marketing. These guidelines were incorporated into the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]].

Later in 2010, CDT launched the Digital Due Process Coalition, establishing four principles for [[Electronic Communications Privacy Act]] (ECPA) reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/03/30/digital-due-process-coalition-looks-to-update-online-privacy-laws/|title=Digital Due Process Coalition Looks to Update Online Privacy Laws|last=|first=|date=March 30, 2010|website=TechCrunch.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the coalition has over one hundred members including some of the biggest Internet companies to advocacy groups across the entire political spectrum. The campaign for ECPA reform has brought the need for extending full constitutional protections to the Internet to the forefront of the national debate and has resulted in 2013 coalition-supported bipartisan bills in both houses of Congress.[[Center for Democracy and Technology#cite note-7|&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

Two copyright enforcement bills, the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] (SOPA) and the [[PROTECT IP Act|Protect IP Act]] (PIPA), were introduced to the [[United States Congress|US Congress]] in 2010 and 2011. Both bills posed serious threats to the technical grounds of the Internet, as well as freedom of expression online, by increasing the role of [[Internet service provider|ISPs]] and Internet intermediaries in combating online copyright infringement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/larrymagid/2012/01/18/what-are-sopa-and-pipa-and-why-all-the-fuss/#7cc2970c22dd|title=What Are SOPA And PIPA And Why All The Fuss|last=Magid|first=Larry|date=January 18, 2012|website=Forbes.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/45145-anti-piracy-bills-sopa-and-pipa-remain-a-threat-to-open-internet/|title=Anti-Piracy Bills SOPA and PIPA Remain a Threat to Open Internet|last=|date=January 18, 2012|website=Pitchfork.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In opposition to SOPA and PIPA, the CDT gathered organizations from technical and civil society backgrounds. The efforts of CDT provided critical legal analysis which laid the foundation for 2012's incredible surge of grassroots resistance against SOPA and PIPA.

CDT was one of the few civil society organizations involved in the founding of the [[ICANN|Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN), encouraging a bottom-up style of governance and making certain that the voice of the Internet users be included at the table.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2014/10/07/internet-operations-chief-snowden-disclosures-make-my-job-easier/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.6c6ca67e1c02|title=ICANN chief: "The whole world is watching" the U.S.'s net neutrality debate|last=Scola|first=Nancy|date=October 7, 2014|website=The Washington Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ICANN deliberations, CDT argued for public representation and for the placement of a Civil Society representative on its Board. In helping to form the [[OECD|Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's]] (OECD) Principles for Internet Policy Making in 2011, CDT also pushed for a multi-stakeholder approach to Internet governance. OECD's 34 member states committed to respect human rights, open governance, rule of law, and consideration of numerous viewpoints by accepting the principles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://usoecd.usmission.gov/our-relationship/about-the-oecd/what-is-the-oecd/|title=What is the OECD?|last=|first=|date=|website=US Mission to the Organization For Economic Cooperation &amp; Development|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2012-Present ===
At the [[International Telecommunication Union]]’s (ITU) [[World Conference on International Telecommunications]] (WCIT) in 2012, CDT brought inclusive Internet governance into focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cdt.org/blog/cdt-to-itu-promote-access-and-openness-dont-stifle-it/|title=CDT to ITU: Promote Access and Openness, Don't Stifle It|last=|first=|date=November 12, 2012|website=cdt.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://globalnetworkinitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GNI-Corporate-Responsibility-and-Internet-Governance.pdf|title=Corporate Responsibility and Global Internet Governance|last=|first=|date=October 2012|website=globalnetworkinitiative.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though many governments came bearing proposals to escalate government and ITU control over Internet governance, CDT defeated all such proposals through organized civil society advocacy. In addition, CDT fortified relationships between organizations for the sake of future advocacy efforts. Even now, inclusive Internet governance faces serious obstacles as nations scramble to respond to news of the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) surveillance. CDT continues to work with an expanding group of partners motivated by civil society concern to preserve the free and open nature of the Internet.

CDT requested Congress make [[Congressional Research Service reports|Congressional Research Services Reports]] (CRS) publicly available and easily accessible. When Congress failed to do so, CDT started a website, OpenCRS.com, that made CRS reports freely available online. OpenCRS.com was one of the leading sources of CRS reports. By collecting CRS reports acquired by organizations and citizens through direct appeals to their representatives, the OpenCRS website served as a valuable repository of information. Though no longer in operation, the OpenCRS inspired other CRS websites and open resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.everycrsreport.com/about.html|title=About|last=|first=|date=|website=EveryCRSReport.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CDT has long been an active supporter of Internet neutrality. In a brief filed in 2012, CDT supported the [[Federal Communications Commission|Federal Communications Commission's]] (FCC) Open Internet Rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.commondreams.org/newswire/2015/05/15/cdt-files-motion-intervene-support-open-internet-order|title=CDT Files Motion to Intervene in Support of Open Internet Order|last=|first=|date=May 15, 2015|website=CommonDreams.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules detailed the limited role of the agency by blocking discrimination by broadband providers. In this way, the FCC intended to protect online free expression and innovation. In 2014, the Open Internet Rules were struck down, drawing CDT back into the fight for Internet neutrality on a global scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/107172520302851/CDT%202017%20FCC%20NPRM%20Comment.pdf|title=Comments of the Center of Democracy &amp; Technology|last=|first=|date=July 17, 2017|website=FCC.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By offering up extensive expertise, CDT has ensured that any EU regulation on Internet neutrality takes into account the central tenet of nondiscrimination.

In the early 90s, the NSA developed and promoted the “[[Clipper Chip]],” an encryption device for telephone calls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/12/magazine/battle-of-the-clipper-chip.html|title=Battle of the Clipper Chip|last=Levy|first=Stephen|date=1994|journal=The New York Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NSA argued that government access to cryptographic keys was essential to national security – CDT and its allies claimed that the Clipper Chip would introduce greater vulnerabilities into the country's communications networks. In 2013, on behalf of a coalition of Internet companies such as Apple, Google, Facebook, and Twitter and advocates for free speech and privacy rights such as ACLU, EFF, and Mozilla, CDT delivered a 'We Need To Know' letter to officials in the US government demanding greater transparency in matters of national security-related surveillance of Internet and telephone communications.[[Center for Democracy and Technology#cite note-10|&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt;]] Advocating for reform, CDT's firm stance is that the NSA's surveillance programs and its interference with Internet security infringe on privacy, are chilling to free speech and association, and threaten the free flow of information that is the foundation of the open Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://techfreedom.org/tf-cdt-and-40-others-tell-congress-what-real-nsa/|title=TF, CDT, and 40 others tell Congress what real NSA reform should look like|last=|first=|date=April 1, 2014|website=Tech Freedom|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an advocacy organization, CDT has outlined key reforms to NSA surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cdt.org/blog/four-key-reforms-for-nsa-surveillance/|title=Four Key Reforms for NSA Surveillance|last=Geiger|first=Harley|date=March 14, 2014|website=CDT.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Project Teams==

===Privacy &amp; Data===
CDT's Privacy and Data Project examines the evolving role of technology in daily life, considering its influence on individuals, communities, and law. In identifying emerging issues and collaborating with companies and public officials, CDT's privacy experts are able to develop forward-thinking technical and policy solutions. Among the topics covered by CDT's Privacy and Data team are Health Privacy, the [[Internet of things|Internet of Things]], Broadband Privacy, Drones, Student Privacy, and Digital Decisions. Additionally, CDT heads the State Privacy Resource Center, which serves as a repository of information to help policymakers at the state and local level craft privacy legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cdt.org/issue/privacy-data/|title=Center for Democracy and Technology Privacy &amp; Data Project|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free Expression===
Today's tech affords individuals the ability to communicate, receive, publish, and interpret information and ideas like never before. Understanding that the free flow of information is essential to any healthy democratic process, CDT's Free Expression Project works both to ensure that free speech protections extend to online expression and to block censorship and content gatekeeping. As new platforms for discourse emerge and revolutionize the application of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], maintaining the integrity of a user-defined online experience is of utmost importance. Currently, CDT's Free Expression team focuses on issues of Digital Copyright, Intermediary Liability, Children's Privacy, and [[Net neutrality|Net Neutrality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cdt.org/issue/free-expression/|title=Center for Democracy and Technology Free Expression Project|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Security &amp; Surveillance===
The technological advancements of today allow governments the means to access troves of personal information by collecting and analyzing the data generated and stored on the devices of individuals. Reasonable, and effectively enforced, checks need to be placed on governments' access to and use of individuals' data to preserve the rights to privacy and free expression. Security must exist in accordance with individual freedoms; it is clear that balanced policies and laws are the only way to achieve both aims. The Security and Surveillance Project of CDT fights to put those balanced checks in place, presently considering issues of [[Electronic Communications Privacy Act|ECPA]] reform, cybersecurity, US government surveillance, drones, and encryption and government hacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cdt.org/issue/security-surveillance/|title=Center for Democracy and Technology Security &amp; Surveillance Project|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet Architecture===
If human rights are to thrive in modernity, the values of individual security, privacy, and free expression must be considered with regard to the increasingly digital world. Principles must be ingrained in the foundation of technology, guiding future development and imagined uses. CDT's Internet Architecture team uses their technical expertise to influence legislation, understanding the importance of informed policy-making. Today, CDT's Internet Architecture team focuses on online anonymity and encryption, the standards that govern the technical decisions of internet operation, net neutrality, government surveillance, internet governance policies at across the globe, cybersecurity research, and election security and privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cdt.org/issue/internet-architecture/|title=Center for Democracy and Technology Internet Architecture Team|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
When it comes to influencing technology policy on a global scale, the perspective and performance of the [[European Union|EU]] factors in significantly. With a full-time presence in Brussels, CDT is able to promote the fundamental principles of an open and inclusive Internet in collaboration with the [[Member state of the European Union|EU's Member States]], civil society, public institutions, and technology sector. CDT's EU Office focuses on the policy areas of digital copyright, intermediary liability and free expression, surveillance and government access to personal data, net neutrality, internet governance, and data protection and privacy.

'''Christian communism''' is a form of [[religious communism]] based on [[Christianity]]. It is a theological and political theory based upon the view that the teachings of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]] compel [[Christian]]s to support [[communism]] as the ideal [[social system]]. Although there is no universal agreement on the exact date when Christian communism was founded, many Christian communists assert that evidence from the [[Bible]] (in the [[Acts of the Apostles]])&lt;ref name="Bible"&gt;Acts 2:44, 4:32–37; 5:1–12. Other verses are: Matthew 5:1–12, 6:24, Luke 3:11, 16:11, 2 Corinthians 8:13–15 and James 5:3.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the first Christians, including the [[apostles]], established their own small communist society in the years following Jesus' death and resurrection.&lt;ref name="Bible"/&gt; As such, many advocates of Christian communism argue that it was taught by Jesus and practiced by the apostles themselves.&lt;ref&gt;This is the standpoint of the [[orthodox Marxism|orthodox Marxist]] {{cite book|last=Kautsky|first=Karl|title=Foundations of Christianity|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1908/christ/index.htm|date=1953|orig-year=1908|publisher=Russell and Russell|chapter=IV.II.

== Basis ==
Christian communists hold the biblical verse Acts 4:32–35 as evidence that the first Christians lived in a communist society. Acts 4:32–35 reads: "All the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of their possessions was their own, but they [[Common ownership|shared everything they had]]. With great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. And Gods grace was so powerfully at work in them all that there were no needy persons among them. For from time to time those who owned land or houses sold them, brought the money from the sales and put it at the apostles feet, and it was distributed to anyone who had need".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%25204:32-35&amp;version=NIV|title=Acts204:32-35 NIV -  - Bible Gateway|website=www.biblegateway.com|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence that what is described in Acts 4:32–35 is historical and was practiced widely and taken seriously during at least the first two centuries of Christianity.&lt;ref name="Montero2017"/&gt; Other biblical evidence of [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalistic]] belief systems include Matthew 6:24: "No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other.You cannot serve both God and money".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6%253A24&amp;version=NIV|title=Matthew 63A24 NIV -  - Bible Gateway|website=www.biblegateway.com|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Each according to his abilities" has biblical origins too. Act 11:29 states: "29 Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea". "[[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs|To each according to his needs]]" is biblical too. Acts 4:35: "[...] to the emissaries to distribute to each according to his need". Thomas Wharton Collens' ''Preaching'' describes biblical sources supporting a common-property society.&lt;ref&gt;Prof. José P. Miranda, ""Comunismo en la Biblia"" (1981), translated as, ""Communism in the Bible"" (Maryknoll, N.Y.: Orbis Books, 1982). Miranda, Jose P. (2004), ''Communism in the Bible'', Wipf and Stock Publishers, Eugene Oregon. {{ISBN|1-59244-468-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian communism is not merely based on the principles of the early apostles. In fact, Christian communists claim that anti-capitalist ideals are deeply rooted in the Christian faith. While [[capitalism]] had not yet formed in the time of Christ, his message was overwhelmingly against the love of money (greed) and in support of the poor. The principles of Christ are seen by Christian communists as staunchly anti-capitalist in nature. As Christ taught that the love of money was the root of many evils, by that logic it seems only natural for Christians to oppose a social system founded entirely on the love of money as Christian communists claim. In fact, capitalist development was delayed largely by Christian opposition to the emergence of such a system and it did not gather popular support until [[John Calvin]] brought about popular support of capitalism from a religious perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Osakue|first=Dawn|title=Calvinist Ethics and the Rise of Capitalism|url=https://www.academia.edu/1085120/Calvinist_Ethics_and_the_Rise_of_Capitalism}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ideals of Christian communism are pre-Calvinist and as such seek to return Christianity to its anti-capitalist roots by progressing beyond it into [[socialism]] and finally to [[communism]].

== Controversy ==
=== Atheism and communism ===
Contemporary communism, including contemporary Christian communism, owes much to [[Marxism|Marxist thought]]—particularly [[Marxian economics|Marxist economics]]. Not all communists are in full agreement with Marxism, but it is difficult to find any communists today who do not agree at least with the Marxist critique of capitalism. Marxism includes a complex array of views that cover several different fields of human knowledge and one may easily distinguish between [[Marxist philosophy]], [[Marxist sociology]] and Marxist economics. Marxist sociology and Marxist economics have no connection to religious issues and make no assertions about such things. On the other hand, Marxist philosophy is famously [[Atheism|atheistic]], although some Marxist scholars, both Christian and non-Christian, have insisted that Marxist philosophy and the philosophy of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] are significantly different from one another and that this difference needs recognition. In particular, Jose Porfirio Miranda found Marx and Engels to be consistently opposed to deterministic materialism and broadly sympathetic towards Christianity and towards the text of the Bible, although disbelieving in a supernatural deity.&lt;ref&gt;Miranda, Jose Porfirio (1980), ''Marx Against The Marxists: The Christian Humanism of Karl Marx''. SCM Press, London. {{ISBN|0-334-00975-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vladimir Lenin]] also allowed Christians in the [[Bolshevik Party]].

=== Establishing Christian communism ===
There is also the question of how a [[communist society]] should be actually achieved. While orthodox communists advocate a form of violent [[revolution]], Christian communists almost universally insist on [[Nonviolence|nonviolent]] means, such as [[Nonviolent resistance|passive resistance]] or winning [[election]]s. Some groups are [[Pacifism|pacifists]], such as the [[Hutterites]] and [[Bruderhof Communities|Bruderhof]], who regard all force as wrong, including forcing a new society on someone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://christlife.org/blog/learning-from-the-bruderhof-an-intentional-christian-community|title=Learning from the Bruderhof: An Intentional Christian Community|work=ChristLife|accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the issue of the [[nationalization]] of the [[means of production]], Christian communists argue that capitalism itself is a form of institutionalized theft in the manner that capitalist owners exploit their workers by not paying them the full value of their labour. However, not all Christian communists seek to achieve large-scale social change. Some believe that rather than attempting to transform the politics and economics of an entire country, Christians should instead establish communism at a local or regional level only.

According to theologians such as Leonardo Boff, the Latin American branch of Christian communist [[liberation theology]] is rooted in the concept that "prudence is the understanding of situations of radical crisis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redescristianas.net/2009/06/20/jesus-un-hombre-de-equilibrio-fantasia-cradora-y-originalidadleonardo-boff-teologo/|title=Jesús, un hombre de equilibrio, fantasía cradora y originalidad##Leonardo Boff, teólogo|publisher=Redes Cristianas|date=20 June 2009|accessdate=29 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120908053921/http://www.redescristianas.net/2009/06/20/jesus-un-hombre-de-equilibrio-fantasia-cradora-y-originalidadleonardo-boff-teologo/|archivedate=8 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Christian communists, [[historical materialism]] is utilized as a methodology of analysis to define the nature of the crisis in question as a product of political-economic dynamics and modalities derived from the workings of what is termed "the late capitalist/imperialist mode of production". According to this subset of liberation theology, the challenge for the Christian communist is then to define what it means (in context of "a concrete analysis of the concrete social reality") to affirm a "preferential option for the poor and oppressed" as [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] (active theory)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Praxis |url=http://www.marxists.org/subject/praxis/index.htm |title=The Praxis Group |publisher=Marxists.org |accessdate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as commanded by an [[ethics]] allegedly "rooted in the beatidic teachings of Jesus". Christian communist liberation theology is not about [[Evangelism|evangelization]] per se, but rather about developing an [[orthopraxis]] (ethical action, i.e. the condition of coming to the light by doing the works of God)&lt;ref&gt;[http://sarumtheologian.wordpress.com/2009/05/15/how-might-liberation-theology-shape-a-christian-understanding-of-salvation/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306045740/http://sarumtheologian.wordpress.com/2009/05/15/how-might-liberation-theology-shape-a-christian-understanding-of-salvation/|date=March 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; that aims to reconcile the "beatidic ethics" of Jesus as espoused in the [[Sermon on the Mount]] with existing social struggles against what is termed "[[neo-colonialism]]" or "[[late capitalism]]". Both Christian communism and liberation theology stress orthopraxis over [[orthodoxy]]. A narrative of the nature of contemporary social struggles is developed via materialist analysis utilizing historiographic concepts developed by Karl Marx. A concrete example are the Paraguayan ''Sin Tierra'' (landless) movement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.okaraygua-paraguai.org/es/conozcanos.html |title=MCP (Movimiento Campesino Paraguayo) |publisher=Okaraygua-paraguai.org |accessdate=29 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119044610/http://www.okaraygua-paraguai.org/es/conozcanos.html |archivedate=19 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who engage in direct land seizures and the establishment of socialized agricultural cooperative production in ''asentamientos''. The contemporary Paraguayan ''Sin Tierra'' operate in a very similar manner as that of the reformation era [[Diggers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diggers.org/diggers/religion_winstanley.htm |title=The Religion of Gerrard Winstanley and Digger Communism |last=Sutherland |first=Donald R. |accessdate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diggers.org/rexroth_diggers.htm |title=Rexroth |publisher=Diggers |date=26 November 2011 |accessdate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Camilo Torres Restrepo|Camilo Torres]] (the founder of the [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|Colombian guerrilla group ELN]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eln-voces.com/ |title=Bienvenido/a a nuestra página Web&amp;nbsp;– Ejército de Liberación Nacional |publisher=Eln-voces.com |date=26 May 2008 |accessdate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8417595.stm |title=Colombia rebel groups Farc and ELN agree 'to unite' |publisher=BBC News |date=17 December 2009 |accessdate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McDermott |first=Jeremy |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8341093.stm |title=Colombia's ELN rebels show new vigour |publisher=BBC News |date=5 November 2009 |accessdate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; developing this orthopraxis meant celebrating the [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Catholic Eucharist]] only among those engaged in armed struggle against the army of the Colombian state while fighting alongside them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filosofia.org/ave/001/a230.htm |title=Camilo Torres Restrepo 1929–1966 |publisher=Filosofia.org |accessdate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Citizen National Guard''', abbreviated as '''CNG''', is a [[Filipino nationalist]] [[political advocacy group]] founded in 2017 by Antonio Valdez. It was established by supporters of Philippine President [[Rodrigo Duterte]]. The group aims to "defend the country, protect the people and support the president", from perceived opponents, including [[Islamic extremism|Islamic]] and [[Communism in the Philippines|communist]] extremists (mainly [[Philippines and ISIL|ISIS]]-inspired groups and [[Communist Party of the Philippines|CPP-NPA]], respectively) and supporters of the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]], which is the main [[Opposition (politics)|opposition party]] since Duterte's term.&lt;ref name="dissent"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2017/10/11/1747726/dissent-destabilization-are-same-citizen-national-guard|title=Dissent, destabilization are the same — Citizen National Guard {{!}} Philstar.com|website=philstar.com|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group received support from some government officials, including former [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|Department of Justice]] secretary [[Vitaliano Aguirre II]] and Public Attorney's Office Chairperson Persida Acosta. Conversely, its establishment drew criticism from opposition, mainly the [[Left-wing politics|left-leaning]] alliance [[Bagong Alyansang Makabayan]].&lt;ref name="dissent"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2017/10/02/1745156/aguirre-acosta-laud-group-will-fight-enemies-state|title=Aguirre, Acosta laud group that will fight|website=philstar.com|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2017/10/04/1745578/group-alarmed-creation-citizens-guard-against-enemies-state|title=Group alarmed by creation of 'citizens guard' against enemies of state {{!}} Philstar.com|website=philstar.com|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4092">The '''City Development Index''' was developed for the Second [[United Nations]] Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II) in 1996 and measures the level of development in cities. The Urban Indicators Programme of the [[United Nations]] Human Settlements Programme ([[United Nations Human Settlements Programme|UN-Habitat]]) developed the indicator so that they could rank cities of the world according to their level of development and as a display of indicators depicting development. The CDI cuts across the different clusters identified in the Urban Indicator Framework as it is based on five sub indices namely, infrastructure, waste, health, education and city product. It is useful as it provides a snap-shot view of how cities are doing with respect to the different indices. It was invented by Dr Joe Flood, first Coordinator of the Urban Indicators Program, following a statistical analysis of city indicators data.

'''Calculating the City Development Index'''&lt;br /&gt;
The City Development Index is calculated according to the formulae in the table below. It has separate sub-indices for Infrastructure, Waste Management, Health, Education, and City Product, which are averaged to form the CDI. Each sub-index is a combination of several indicators that have been normalized to give a value between 0 and 1. Because the variables used to make up the CDI are strongly related to each other, there are a number of ways to calculate the CDI that give almost identical results. For this report, the weightings given to each indicator have been initially calculated by a statistical process called Principal Components Analysis and then simplified. This formulation of the index by and large uses the same formulae as in UNDP Human Development Report (1999), for the Health, Education and City Product sub-indices.

For meaningful ranking of cities, the index requires data that are essentially complete, robust and precise - so not many variables are suitable. All the underlying data had to be checked for accuracy and completeness. Where there were missing data or based on very inaccurate estimates, they were either replaced by data from another national city of similar size, by country-wide figures (or national urban data, if available) or by figures for a nearby city or place at a similar level of development (but only if absolutely necessary). Also, Formal waste disposal or Wastewater treated is taken as zero if not provided. Where City Product was not provided, it was calculated so that City Product x Household size = 0.45 x Mean Household Income (which is similar to the main estimation formula). For most transition countries 0.35 x Household Income is used since, in transition economies, much GDP goes into indirect services and subsidies. The resultant city products must be somewhere in the vicinity of the National GDP per person, otherwise household incomes are presumed incorrect and adjusted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/ga/Istanbul+5/116.pdf Calculating the CDI]&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently several changes were made to the index by Dr Flood in work for the Asian Development Bank, to include telecommunications data. Other additions have been made by consultants in practical applications.

As in other states that employ the [[Westminster system|Westminster political system]], Her Majesty's Home Civil Service forms an inseparable part of the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]]. The executive decisions of government ministers are implemented by HM Civil Service. Civil servants are employees of the Crown and not of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]]. Civil servants also have some traditional and [[Statute|statutory]] responsibilities which to some extent protect them from being used for the political advantage of the party in power. Senior civil servants may be called to account to Parliament.

In general use, the term ''civil servant'' in the United Kingdom does not include all [[public sector]] employees; although there is no fixed legal definition, the term is usually defined as a "servant of the Crown working in a civil capacity who is not the holder of a political (or judicial) office; the holder of certain other offices in respect of whose tenure of office special provision has been made; [or] a servant of the Crown in a personal capacity paid from the [[Civil List]]".&lt;ref name="a"&gt;Bradley and Ewing, p.272&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the civil service does not include government ministers (who are politically appointed), members of the [[British Armed Forces]], the [[police officer|police]], officers of [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local government authorities]] or [[non-departmental public body|quangos]] of the [[Houses of Parliament]], employees of the [[National Health Service]] (NHS), or staff of the [[Royal Households of the United Kingdom|Royal Household]]. As at the end of March 2016 there were 418,343 civil servants in the Home Civil Service, this is down 3.6% on the previous year.&lt;ref name=Statistics2016&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/publicsectorpersonnel/bulletins/civilservicestatistics/2016 |title=Civil Service statistics: 2016 |date=6 October 2016 |publisher=UK Government |website=ons.gov.uk |accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two other administratively separate civil services in the United Kingdom. One is for [[Northern Ireland]] (the [[Northern Ireland Civil Service]]); the other is the [[Diplomatic service|foreign service]] ([[Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service]]). The heads of these services are members of the Permanent Secretaries Management Group.&lt;ref name=PSMG_members/&gt;&lt;ref name=HoDS/&gt;

==History==
===Establishment===
{{rquote|right|the incorruptible spinal column of England|[[John Gunther]], 1940&lt;ref name="gunther1940"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.149663/2015.149663.Inside-Europe#page/n309/mode/2up | title=Inside Europe | publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers | author=Gunther, John | authorlink=John Gunther | location=New York | year=1940 | page=287}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Offices of State grew in England, and later the United Kingdom. Initially, as in other countries, they were little more than [[wikt:secretariat|secretariat]]s for their leaders, who held positions at [[Court (royal)|court]].  They were chosen by the king on the advice of a patron, and typically replaced when their patron lost influence. In the 18th century, in response to the growth of the [[British Empire]] and economic changes, institutions such as the [[Office of Works]] and the [[Navy Board]] grew large. Each had its own system and staff were appointed by purchase or patronage. By the 19th century, it became increasingly clear that these arrangements were not working.

In 1806, the [[East India Company]], a private company that ruled only in India, established a college, the [[East India Company College]], near London. The purpose of this college was to train administrators; it was established on recommendation of officials in China who had seen the [[imperial examination]] system. The civil service, based on examination similar to the Chinese system, was advocated by a number of Englishmen over the next several decades.&lt;ref&gt;(Bodde 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Ewart Gladstone]], then a junior minister, in 1850 sought a more efficient system based on expertise rather than favouritism. The East India Company provided a model for Stafford Northcote, the private Secretary to Gladstone, who with Charles Trevelyan (Permanent Secretary of the Treasury) drafted the key report in 1854.  A permanent, unified and politically neutral civil service, in which appointments were made on merit, was introduced on the recommendations of the [[Northcote–Trevelyan Report]] of 1854, which also recommended a clear division between staff responsible for routine ("mechanical") work, and those engaged in policy formulation and implementation in an "administrative" class. The report was not implemented, but it came at a time when the bureaucratic chaos in the [[Crimean War]] demonstrated that the military was as backward as the civil service.  A [[Civil Service Commission]] was set up in 1855 to oversee open recruitment and end patronage.  Prime Minister Gladstone took the decisive step in 1870 with his Order in Council to implement the Northcote-Trevelyan proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Simon Heffer|title=High Minds: The Victorians and the Birth of Modern Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O1gbQwhBSiIC&amp;pg=PA476|year=2013|page=476}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This system was broadly endorsed by Commissions chaired by Playfair (1874), Ridley (1886), MacDonnell (1914), Tomlin (1931) and Priestley (1955).

The Northcote–Trevelyan model remained essentially stable for a hundred years. This was a tribute to its success in removing corruption, delivering public services (even under the stress of two world wars), and responding effectively to political change.  Patrick Diamond argues:
:The Northcote-Trevelyan model was characterised by a hierarchical mode of Weberian bureaucracy; neutral, permanent and anonymous officials motivated by the public interest; and a willingness to administer policies ultimately determined by ministers. This bequeathed a set of theories, institutions and practices to subsequent generations of administrators in the central state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Diamond|title=Governing Britain: Power, Politics and the Prime Minister|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j0_dAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA42|year=2013|publisher=I.B.Tauris|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Irish Civil Service (pre-independence)|Irish Civil Service]] was separate from the British civil service; although the [[Acts of Union 1800]] abolished the [[Parliament of Ireland]], the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] was retained in formal charge of [[Dublin Castle administration|the Irish executive based at Dublin Castle]]. The [[Irish Office]] in Whitehall liaised with Dublin Castle. Some British departments' area of operation extended to Ireland, while in other fields the Dublin department was separate from the Whitehall equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McDowell|first=Robert Brendan|title=The Irish administration, 1801-1914|date=1 December 1976|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=9780837185613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lord Fulton's committee report===
Following the Second World War, however, demands for change again grew. There was a concern (illustrated in [[C. P. Snow]]'s ''[[Strangers and Brothers]]'' series of novels) that technical and scientific expertise was mushrooming, to a point at which the "good all-rounder" culture of the administrative civil servant with a classics or other arts degree could no longer properly engage with it: as late as 1963, for example, the Treasury had just 19 trained economists. The times were, moreover, ones of keen respect for technocracy, with the mass mobilisation of war having worked effectively, and the French National Plan apparently delivering economic success. And there was also a feeling which would not go away, following the war and the radical social reforms of the 1945 Labour government, that the so-called "[[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarins]]" of the higher civil service were too remote from the people. Indeed, between 1948 and 1963 only 3% of the recruits to the administrative class came from the [[working classes]], and in 1966 more than half of the administrators at [[undersecretary]] level and above had been privately educated.

[[John Fulton, Baron Fulton|Lord Fulton]]'s committee reported in 1968. He found that administrators were not professional enough, and in particular lacked management skills; that the position of technical and scientific experts needed to be rationalised and enhanced; and that the service was indeed too remote. His 158 recommendations included the introduction of a unified grading system for all categories of staff, a Civil Service College and a central policy planning unit. He also said that control of the service should be taken from the Treasury, and given to a new Department, and that the "fast stream" recruitment process for accessing the upper echelons should be made more flexible, to encourage candidates from less privileged backgrounds. The new Department was set up by Prime Minister Harold Wilson's Labour Government in 1968 and named the Civil Service Department, known as CSD. The first Minister was Cabinet Minister Lord Shackleton, also Leader of the House of Lords and Lord Privy Seal. The first Permanent Secretary was Sir William Armstrong, who moved over from his post as Permanent Secretary at the Treasury. After the 1970 General Election, new Conservative Prime Minister Ted Heath appointed Lord Jellicoe in Lord Shackleton's place.

Into [[Edward Heath|Heath]]'s [[Downing Street]] came the [[Central Policy Review Staff]] (CPRS), and they were in particular given charge of a series of Programme Analysis and Review (PAR) studies of policy efficiency and effectiveness.

But, whether through lack of political will, or through passive resistance by a mandarinate which the report had suggested were "amateurs", Fulton failed. The Civil Service College equipped generalists with additional skills, but did not turn them into qualified professionals as [[École nationale d'administration|ENA]] did in France. Recruits to the fast stream self-selected, with the universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] still producing a large majority of successful English candidates, since the system continued to favour the tutorial system at [[Oxbridge]] while to an extent the Scottish [[Ancient universities of Scotland|Ancient universities]] educated a good proportion of recruits from north of the border. The younger mandarins found excuses to avoid managerial jobs in favour of the more prestigious  postings. The generalists remained on top, and the specialists on tap.

===Margaret Thatcher's government===
[[Margaret Thatcher]] came to office in 1979 believing in [[free market]]s as a better social system in many areas than the state: government should be small but active. Many of her ministers were suspicious of the civil service, in light of [[public choice]] research that suggested public servants tend to increase their own power and budgets.

She immediately set about reducing the size of the civil service, cutting numbers from 732,000 to 594,000 over her first seven years in office. [[Derek Rayner, Baron Rayner|Derek Rayner]], the former chief executive of [[Marks &amp; Spencer]], was appointed as an [[Business efficiency expert|efficiency expert]] with the Prime Minister's personal backing; he identified numerous problems with the Civil Service, arguing that only three billion of the eight billion [[pound sterling|pound]]s a year spent at that time by the Civil Service consisted of essential services, and that the "mandarins" (senior civil servants) needed to focus on efficiency and management rather than on policy advice.&lt;ref&gt;Sampson, p.174-5&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1981 the Prime Minister announced the abolition of the Civil Service Department, transferring power over the Civil Service to the Prime Minister's Office and [[Cabinet Office]].&lt;ref&gt;Sampson, p.171&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Priestley Commission]] principle of pay comparability with the private sector was abandoned in February 1982.

Meanwhile, [[Michael Heseltine]] was introducing a comprehensive system of corporate and business planning (known as MINIS) first in the [[Secretary of State for the Environment|Department of the Environment]] and then in the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]].  This led to the ''[[Financial Management Initiative]]'', launched in September 1982 (''Efficiency and Effectiveness in the Civil Service'' (Cmnd 8616)) as an umbrella for the efficiency scrutiny programme and with a wider focus on corporate planning, efficiency and objective-setting. Progress initially was sluggish, but in due course MINIS-style business planning became standard, and delegated budgets were introduced, so that individual managers were held much more accountable for meeting objectives, and for the first time for the resources they used to do so. [[Performance-related pay]] began in December 1984, was built on thereafter, and continues to this day, though the sums involved have always been small compared to the private sector, and the effectiveness of PRP as a genuine motivator has often been questioned.

In February 1988 [[Robin Ibbs]], who had been recruited from [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] in July 1983 to run the [[Efficiency Unit]] (now in No. 10), published his report [[Next Steps Initiative|''Improving Management in Government: The Next Steps'']]. This envisaged a new approach to delivery featuring clear targets and personal responsibility. Without any statutory change, the managerial functions of Ministries would be hived off into [[Executive Agency|Executive Agencies]], with clear [[Framework Document]]s setting out their objectives, and whose [[chief executive]]s would be made accountable directly (in some cases to Parliament) for performance. Agencies were to, as far as possible, take a commercial approach to their tasks. However, the Government conceded that agency staff would remain civil servants, which diluted the radicalism of the reform. The approach seems somewhat similar to the Swedish model, though no influence from Sweden has ever been acknowledged.

The [[Next Steps Initiative]] took some years to get off the ground, and progress was patchy. Significant change was achieved, although agencies never really achieved the level of autonomy envisaged at the start.&lt;ref&gt;The ''locus classicus'' showing the difficulty of this boundary was the interview of [[Michael Howard]] on ''Newsnight'' on 13 May 1997, which pivoted on the question whether as Minister he had intervened in the detailed management of the Prison Services Agency.&lt;/ref&gt; By 5 April 1993, 89 agencies had been established, and contained over 260,000 civil servants, some 49% of the total.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Greer, 1994,''Transforming Central Government: the Next Steps'', preface.&lt;/ref&gt;

The focus on smaller, more accountable, units revived the keenness of Ministerial interest in the perceived efficiencies of the private sector. Already in the late 1980s, some common services once set up to capture economies of scale, such as the [[Property Services Agency]] and the [[Crown Supplier]]s, were being dismantled or sold off. Next, shortly after Thatcher left office, in July 1991, a new programme of market-testing of central government services began, with the White Paper ''Competing for Quality'' (Cm 1730). Five-yearly or three-yearly policy and finance reviews of all agencies and other public bodies were instituted, where the first question to be answered (the "prior options exercise") was why the function should not be abolished or privatised. In November 1991 the [[private finance initiative]] was launched, and by November 1994 the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] had referred to it as ‘the funding mechanism of choice for most public sector projects’. In 1995 the decision was taken to privatise the [[Chessington Computer Centre]], [[HMSO]], the [[Occupational Health &amp; Safety Agency]] and Recruitment &amp; Assessment Services.

===The Citizen's Charter===
It was believed with the Thatcher reforms that efficiency was improving. But there was still a perception of carelessness and lack of responsiveness in the quality of public services. The government of [[John Major]] sought to tackle this with a [[Citizen's Charter]] programme. This sought to empower the service user, by setting out rights to standards in each service area, and arrangements for compensation when these were not met. An Office of Public Service and Science was set up in 1992, to see that the Charter policy was implemented across government.

By 1998, 42 Charters had been published, and they included services provided by public service industries such as the health service and the railways, as well as by the civil service. The programme was also expanded to apply to other organisations such as local government or housing associations, through a scheme of "Chartermark" awards. The programme was greeted with some derision, and it is true that the compensation sometimes hardly seemed worth the effort of claiming, and that the service standards were rarely set with much consumer input. But the initiative did have a significant effect in changing cultures, and paradoxically the spin-off [[Chartermark]] initiative may have had more impact on local organisations uncertain about what standards to aim for, than the parent Citizen's Charter programme itself.

They also chair the '''Permanent Secretary Management Group''' and the '''Civil Service Steering Board''' which are the main governing bodies of the Civil Service.&lt;ref name=HoCS/&gt;

It was announced on 11 October 2011 that, following O'Donnell's retirement at the end of 2011, the role of Head of the Home Civil Service would be split from the post of [[Cabinet Secretary (United Kingdom)|Cabinet Secretary]]. There will additionally be a new, separate, Permanent Secretary to lead the Cabinet Office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/cabinet-secretary-announces-retirement/ Number 10&amp;nbsp;– Cabinet Secretary announces retirement]&lt;/ref&gt; After O'Donnell's retirement, [[Jeremy Heywood]] replaced him as Cabinet Secretary - serving until 24 October 2018 when he retired on health grounds; [[Ian Watmore]] as Cabinet Office Permanent Secretary; and lastly, [[Bob Kerslake]] as Head of the Home Civil Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://network.civilservicelive.com/pg/pages/view/623890/kerslake-to-head-the-civil-service-with-promise-of-visible-leadership|publisher=Cabinet Office Civil Service Live Network|title=Civil Service Live Network: Kerslake to head civil service with promise of 'visible leadership'|accessdate=8 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120711052450/http://network.civilservicelive.com/pg/pages/view/623890/kerslake-to-head-the-civil-service-with-promise-of-visible-leadership|archivedate=11 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2014 it was announced that Kerslake would step down and Heywood would take the title of Head of the HCS while [[John Manzoni]] would be Chief Executive of the Civil Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/people/jeremy-heywood|title=Sir Jeremy Heywood|last=|first=|date=|website=www.gov.uk|publisher=|access-date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 24 October 2018 to 4 November 2018, the office of Head of the Home Civil Service was vacant, as Heywood resigned on health grounds. Following Heywood's death, [[Mark Sedwill]] was given the additional Civil Service portfolio.

===Permanent Secretaries Management Group (PSMG)===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Cabinet Secretary]] --&gt;
The PSMG consider issues of strategic importance to the Civil Service as a whole, as well as providing corporate leadership where a single position is required across all government departments.&lt;ref name=PSMG&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/about/structure/psmg/index.asp |title=Permanent Secretaries Management Group |publisher=UK Government |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915133807/http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/about/structure/psmg/index.asp |archivedate=15 September 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is chaired by the Head of the Home Civil Service&lt;ref name=HoCS/&gt; and consists of all [[first permanent secretaries]] and other selected permanent secretaries and [[director-general|directors general]].

===Civil Service Steering Board (CSSB)===
The CSSB was established in 2007 and meets monthly,&lt;ref name=CS_governance&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/about/structure/index.asp |title=Civil Service governance |publisher=UK Government |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921175350/http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/about/structure/index.asp |archivedate=21 September 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its role is to enhance the performance and reputation of the Civil Service by focusing on specific areas delegated to it by PSMG.&lt;ref name=CS_governance/&gt;&lt;ref name=CSSB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/about/structure/cssb/index.asp |title=Civil Service Steering Board |publisher=UK Government |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015080035/http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/about/structure/CSSB/index.asp |archivedate=15 October 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CSSB is chaired by the Head of the Home Civil Service.&lt;ref name=HoCS/&gt;

===Civil Service Commissioners===
{{Main article|First Civil Service Commissioner}}
The Civil Service Commissioners are not civil servants and are independent of Ministers, they are appointed directly by the Crown under Royal Prerogative and they report annually to the Queen.&lt;ref name=CSCommission_01&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilservicecommissioners.org/About_us/ |title=Civil Service Commissioners website (About Us) |publisher=Civil Service Commissioners |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914173227/http://www.civilservicecommissioners.org/About_us/ |archivedate=14 September 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their main role is regarding the recruitment of civil servants. They have the responsibility to ensure that all civil servants are recruited on the "principle of selection on merit on the basis of fair and open competition." They maintain a recruitment code on the interpretation and application of that principle, and approve any exceptions to it. They audit recruitment policies and practices within the Civil Service and approve all appointments to the most senior levels of the Civil Service.&lt;ref name=CSCommission_02&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilservicecommissioners.org/About_us/Code_of_Practice/ |title=Civil Service Commissioners website (Code of Practice) |publisher=Civil Service Commissioners |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509085220/http://www.civilservicecommissioners.org/About_us/Code_of_Practice/ |archivedate=9 May 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commissioners also hear and determine appeals in cases of concern about propriety and conscience raised by civil servants under the Civil Service Code which cannot be resolved through internal procedures.&lt;ref name=CSCommission_02/&gt;

Northern Ireland has a separate Commission called the ''Civil Service Commissioners for Northern Ireland'' which has the same role.&lt;ref name=CSCommission_02/&gt;&lt;ref name=nics_01&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nicscommissioners.org/ |title=CCivil Service Commissioners for Northern Ireland | publisher=Civil Service Commissioners for Northern Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political neutrality==
The Home Civil Service is a politically neutral body, with the function of impartially implementing the policy programme of the elected government.&lt;ref&gt;James B. Christoph, Political Rights and Administrative Impartiality in the British Civil Service," in Canadian Public Administration, eds. J.E. Hodgetts and D.C. Corbett (Toronto: Macmillan, 1960), 421.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1986|title=Political Neutrality, The Duty Of Silence And The Right To Publish In The Civil Service|url=http://pa.oxfordjournals.org/content/39/4/437.full.pdf|journal=Parliamentary Affairs|volume=39|issue=4|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/ministers-plot-end-to-civil-service-neutrality-7995033.html Ministers plot end to Civil Service neutrality - UK Politics - UK]. The Independent (1 August 2012). Retrieved on 2013-08-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like all servants of the [[The Crown|Crown]], civil servants are legally barred from standing for election as [[Members of Parliament]] or Members of the European Parliament.&lt;ref name="c"&gt;Bradley and Ewing, p.279-80&lt;/ref&gt; Also, under regulations first adopted in 1954 and revised in 1984, members of the Senior Civil Service (the top management grades) are barred from holding office in a [[political party]] or publicly expressing controversial political viewpoints, while less senior civil servants at an intermediate (managerial) level must generally seek permission to participate in political activities. The most junior civil servants are permitted to participate in political activities, but must be politically neutral in the exercise of their duties.&lt;ref name="c"/&gt;

All civil servants are subject to the [[Official Secrets Acts 1911 to 1989]], meaning that they may not disclose sensitive government information. Since 1998, there have also been restrictions on contact between civil servants and [[lobbyist]]s; this followed an incident known as "Lobbygate", where an undercover reporter for ''[[The Observer]]'', posing as a [[business]] leader, was introduced by a lobbyist to a senior [[Downing Street]] official who promised privileged access to government ministers.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley and Ewing, p.280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Chapter 7: Lobbying and All-Party Groups], Sixth Report of the [[Committee on Standards in Public Life]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Committee on Standards in Public Life]], also created in 1998, is responsible for regulation of contacts between public officials and lobbyists.

The increasing influence of politically appointed "special advisers" in government departments can reduce the political neutrality of public administration. In Thatcher's government, [[Alan Walters]] was an official adviser from 1981 to 1984, and again in 1989.&lt;ref name=2alans&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jan/06/sir-alan-walters-obituary|title=Obituary-Sir Alan Walters:Economic adviser to Margaret Thatcher, he opposed Britain joining the ERM|publisher=Guardian newspapers|author=Alan Budd|date=6 January 2009|accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walters' criticisms "of many aspects of Treasury policy, particularly in relation to exchange rate policy" and Thatcher's refusal to dismiss him led to Nigel Lawson's resignation as chancellor in 1989.&lt;ref name=2alans/&gt; Thatcher also claimed that the 1981 budget, which increased taxes during the recession and was criticised by 364 economists, had been devised by Walters.&lt;ref name=2alans/&gt;
In 2000, then-Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] was criticised for appointing 20 special advisers (compared to eight under his predecessor [[John Major]]) and for the fact that the total [[salary]] cost of special advisers across all government departments had reached [[£]]4 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/597687.stm The advisers: Modernisation or politicisation?], BBC News, 12 January 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, [[Stephen Byers]], then [[Secretary of State for Transport]], was forced to resign because of the actions of his special adviser [[Jo Moore]], who instructed a departmental civil servant, Martin Sixsmith, that [[9/11|September 11, 2001]], would be "a good day to bury bad news"; this was seen as inappropriate political manipulation of the Civil Service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3368603.stm Spin doctor role under spotlight], BBC News, 5 January 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, under the administration of [[Tony Blair]], the influence of two [[Downing Street]] special advisers, [[Jonathan Powell (chief of staff to Tony Blair)|Jonathan Powell]] and [[Alastair Campbell]], both of whom were given formal power over Downing Street civil servants, provoked widespread criticism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/s2.cfm?id=217432002 Uncivil to the servants] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204065656/http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/s2.cfm?id=217432002 |date=4 December 2007 }}, ''The Scotsman'', 26 February 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government of 2010–2015 had proposed introducing a more American-style system where senior civil servants, such as permanent secretaries, became political appointees.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt; However, this was dropped after it was considered that the existing permanent civil service style was better-suited to the government of the United Kingdom.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Codes==

===Civil Service Code===
The current civil service code was introduced on 6 June 2006 to outline the core values and standards expected of civil servants. The core values are defined as ''integrity'', ''honesty'', ''objectivity'', and ''impartiality''. A key change from previous values is the removal of ''anonymity'' within the core values.&lt;ref name=CS_Code_01&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/iam/codes/cscode/index.asp |title=The Civil Service Code |publisher=UK Government |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923142002/http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/iam/codes/cscode/index.asp |archivedate=23 September 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Code includes an independent line of appeal to the Civil Service Commissioners on alleged breaches of the Code.

===Civil Service Management Code===
The Civil Service Management Code (CSMC) sets out the regulations and instructions to departments and agencies regarding the terms and conditions of service of civil servants. It is the guiding document which gives delegation to civil service organisations, from the Minister for the Civil Service, in order for them to make internal personnel policies.&lt;ref name=CSMC_Code_01&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/about/resources/civil-service-management-code |title=The Introduction to the Civil Service Management Code | publisher=UK Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil Service Commissioners' Recruitment Code===
The Civil Service Commissioners' Recruitment Code is maintained by the Civil Service Commissioners and is based on the ''principle of selection on merit on the basis of fair and open competition.''&lt;ref name=CSRC_01&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilservicecommissioners.org/Reference_Documents/Recruitment_Code_reference/ |title=The Civil Service Commissioners' Recruitment Code |publisher=Civil Service Commissioners |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919123725/http://www.civilservicecommissioners.org/Reference_Documents/Recruitment_Code_reference/ |archivedate=19 September 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Osmotherly Rules===
The [[Osmotherly Rules]] set out guidance on how civil servants should respond to [[Select committee (United Kingdom)|Parliamentary select committees]].&lt;ref name="parlo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-02671.pdf |title=The Osmotherly Rules (Standard Note: SN/PC/2671) |last=Gay |first=Oonagh |date=4 August 2005 |publisher=[[British House of Commons|Parliament and Constitution Centre, House of Commons Library]] |accessdate=22 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530063927/http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-02671.pdf |archivedate=30 May 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Directory of Civil Service Guidance===
A two-volume 125-page ''Directory of Civil Service Guidance'' was published in 2000 to replace the previous ''Guidance on Guidance'', providing short summaries of guidance on a wide range of issues and pointing to more detailed sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/directory-civil-service-guidance Directory of Civil Service Guidance], Cabinet Office 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
[[File:The number of civil servants employed in the UK in 2013 is 448,840.png|thumb|right|A breakdown by department of civil servants employed in 2013.]]
The structure of the home civil service is divided into organisations, grades and professions.  Each [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]] has a [[Departments of the United Kingdom Government|Department]] which has [[executive agency|executive agencies]] and [[non-departmental public bodies]] subordinate to it.

===Grading schemes===
The grading system used in the civil service has changed many times, and the current structure is made up of two schemes. All senior grades (Deputy Director / Grade 5 level and above) are part of the Senior Civil Service, which is overseen by the [[Cabinet Office]] on behalf of the civil service as a whole. Below the Senior Civil Service, each individual department/executive agency can put in place its own grading and pay arrangements, provided they still comply with the central civil service pay and review guidance.

For other grades many departments overlay their own grading structure, however all these structures must map across to the central government structure as shown below.&lt;ref name=Departmental_Grades&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stabilisationunit.gov.uk/attachments/article/178/Civil_Service_Equivalent_Grades.xls |title=Civil Service Equivalent Grades |publisher=UK Civil Service, the Cabinet Office |date=1 February 2010 |accessdate=7 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113171759/http://www.stabilisationunit.gov.uk/attachments/article/178/Civil_Service_Equivalent_Grades.xls |archivedate=13 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Professions ===
The ''lingua franca'' is to describe Civil Servants, and in particular their grades, predominanly through a lens of Administrative activity (as in the Current Structure of the table above), but in practice the Civil Service has an always had a number of subdivisions, with the Historic Grades having an additional designator (usually omitted for Senior Managers, but included from Middle and Junior Managers) as shown as "xxx", with the major groupings being:
* Executive ([x]EO)
* Scientific ([x]SO)
* Professional and Technology ([x]PTO)
The Current Structure identifies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/professions|title=Civil Service professions|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a number of distinct professional groupings:
* Communications and Marketing
* Economics
* Engineering
* Finance
* Human Resources
* Digital, Data and Technology (formerly Information Technology)
* Inspector of Education and Training
* Internal Audit
* Knowledge and Information Management
* Law
* Medicine
* Operational Delivery
* Operational Research
* Policy Delivery
* Procurement and Contract Management
* Programme and Project Management
* Property Asset Management
* Psychology
* Science
* Social and Market Research
* Statistics
* Tax Professionals
* Veterinarian
* Other (for minority groups, such as Investigating Officers)

==In popular culture==
The [[BBC]] television series ''[[Yes Minister]]'' and ''[[Yes Prime Minister]]'' are a [[satire]] on the British [[civil service]] and its relationship with government ministers. The portrayal is a caricature of the civil service predominantly characterised through [[Nigel Hawthorne]]'s [[Humphrey Appleby|Sir Humphrey Appleby]]. ''[[The Thick of It]]'', first broadcast in 2005, is a similar BBC television series that has been called "the 21st century's answer to Yes Minister". The series portrays a modernised version of the interactions between the Civil Service and the Government (chiefly in the form of [[Special advisers in the United Kingdom|special advisors]]), as well as the media's involvement in the process. There is a long history of civil servants who are also literary authors, who often comment on their own institutions, including such writers as [[John Milton]], [[John Dryden]], [[Andrew Marvell]], [[Robert Burns]], [[William Wordsworth]] and [[Anthony Trollope]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3572">In 1867, the French pacifist Charles Lemonnier (1806-1891) convened the '''[[Congress]] of Peace in Geneva''', known as the ''[[League of Peace and Freedom|International League of Peace and Liberty]]''. It was ultimately at this conference that it was decided to abolish the sovereignty and international relations of the [[Holy See]], something which [[Pius IX]] blamed on [[secret societies]]. 

==Garibaldi==
According to Jasper Ridley,&lt;ref&gt;''Garibaldi,'' Viking Press, New York (1976) p. 576-77&lt;/ref&gt; at the 1867 Congress of Geneva, Garibaldi referred to "that pestilential institution which is called the Papacy" and  proposed giving "the final blow to the monster". This was a reflection of the bitterness that had been generated by the struggle against Pope Pius IX in 1849 and 1860, and it was in sharp contrast to the letter that Garibaldi had written to the pope from Montevideo in 1847, before those events.

The Italian rulers took up residence in the [[Quirinal Palace]], and seized Church property throughout Rome and the rest of Italy, but did not have the political support to seize the Vatican. Even before the fall of Rome, Italian [[Republicanism|republicans]] had sought to eliminate the papacy, with [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] seeking international support for that end at an 1867 congress in [[Geneva]], where he proposed: "The papacy, being the most harmful of all secret societies, ought to be abolished."&lt;ref&gt;Giuseppe Guerzoni, ''Garibaldi: con documenti editi e inediti'', Florence, 1882, Vol. 11, 485.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath and political consequences==
:"If these hands, used to fighting, would be acceptable to His Holiness, we most thankfully dedicate them to the service of him who deserves so well of the Church and of the fatherland. Joyful indeed shall we and our companions in whose name we speak be, if we may be allowed to shed our blood in defence of Pio Nono's work of redemption" (October 12, 1847).&lt;ref&gt;A. Werner, ''Autobiography of Giuseppe Garibaldi'', Vol. III, p. 68, Howard Fertig, New York, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the earlier invasions of Italy by [[Napoleon]], when [[Pope Pius VI]] died in French captivity, and [[Pope Pius VII|Pius VII]] was taken captive for six years, the tension between the Italian state and the Papacy continued for 59 years, during which time the popes refused to leave the Vatican, so as not to give implicit recognition to the authority of that state over Rome and its surroundings by placing themselves under the protection of its officials. While some of the Italian revolutionaries thought that the papacy would disappear without the continuance of the papal states, the popes, relieved of their temporal concerns, grew in stature during their years of "imprisonment."  

==Later congresses==
After the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71) the organization reconvened (1873) in Brussels, and David Dudley Field's Proposals for an International Code formed the basis of discussion. In the Western Hemisphere the first Pan-American Conference met in 1889–90 (see [[Pan-Americanism]], movement toward commercial, social, economic, military, and political cooperation among the nations of North, Central, and South America.

'''Democrat In Name Only''' (or '''DINO''') is a [[pejorative]] term for any member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|United States Democratic Party]] deemed insufficiently liberal.

The term was created as an analogous opposite to the [[acronym]] RINO ([[Republican In Name Only]]).

An '''emirate''' is a political territory that is ruled by a [[Dynasty|dynastic]] Arabic or Islamic monarch styled [[emir]]. It also means "kingdom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/emirate|title=the definition of emirate|website=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Etymologically  '''emirate''' or '''amirate''' ({{Lang-ar|إمارة}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|imārah}}''&lt;span style="margin-left:1px"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; plural: {{lang|ar|إمارات}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|imārāt}}''&lt;span style="margin-left:2px"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; is the quality, dignity, office or territorial competence of any [[emir]] (prince, commander, governor etc.). In English, the term is pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|m|ər|ə|t|,_|-|ɪər|-|,_|-|ɪ|t|,_|-|eɪ|t}} or {{IPAc-en|ɛ|ˈ|m|ɪər|ə|t|,_|-|ɪ|t|,_|-|eɪ|t|,_|i|ˈ|-}} in British English and {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|m|ər|ə|t}} or {{IPAc-en|ɪ|ˈ|m|ɪər|ə|t}} in American English.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Wells|first=John C.|year=2008|title=Longman Pronunciation Dictionary|edition=3rd|publisher=Longman|isbn=9781405881180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As monarchies==
The [[United Arab Emirates]] is a federal state that comprises seven federal emirates, each administered by a hereditary emir, these seven forming the [[electoral college]] for the federation's President and Prime Minister. As most emirates have either disappeared, been integrated in a larger modern state or changed their rulers' styles, e.g. to [[malik]] (Arabic for king) or [[sultan]], such true emirate-states have become rare.

==As provinces==
Furthermore, in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] the term can be generalized to mean any province of a country that is administered by a member of the ruling class, especially of a member (usually styled [[emir]]) of the royal family, as in [[Saudi Arabia]]n governorates.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3073">'''Family homelessness''' is the phenomenon of whole [[family unit]]s experiencing [[homelessness]]. In some Western countries, such as the United States, family homelessness is a new form of [[poverty]], and a fast growing group of the homelessness population.&lt;ref&gt;Nunez, Ralph, and Cybelle Fox. "A snapshot of family homelessness across America." Political Science Quarterly 114, no. 2 (1999): 289-307.&lt;/ref&gt; Some American researchers argue that family homelessness is the inevitable result of imbalanced “low-income housing ratio” where there are more low-income households than there are low-cost housing units.&lt;ref name=mcchesney&gt;McChesney, Kay Young. "Family homelessness: A systemic problem." Journal of Social Issues 46, no. 4 (1990): 191-205.&lt;/ref&gt; Homeless families are generally thought to be headed by women. In the United States, homeless families make up about a third of all homeless people in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Bassuk, Ellen L., and Lynn Rosenberg. "Why does family homelessness occur? A case-control study." American Journal of Public Health 78, no. 7 (1988): 783-788.&lt;/ref&gt;

While scholars differ on conceptualizations of homelessness, whether it is a just temporary state through which people pass or if it is a permanent trait that emanates from individual characteristics, studies indicate for families, homelessness is a temporary state that is often resolved by the provision of subsidized housing.&lt;ref&gt;Shinn, Marybeth. "Family homelessness: State or trait?." American journal of community psychology 25, no. 6 (1997): 755-769.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, other studies have found that the majority of homeless families stay in [[homeless shelters]] for relatively brief periods of time. These families then exit and do not return. About 20  percent have longer stays in shelters, but only a small number of families have repeat stays.&lt;ref&gt;Culhane, Dennis P., Stephen Metraux, Jung Min Park, Maryanne Schretzman, and Jesse Valente. "Testing a typology of family homelessness based on patterns of public shelter utilization in four US jurisdictions: Implications for policy and program planning." Housing Policy Debate 18, no. 1 (2007): 1-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors involved==
Family homelessness is thought to have a high proportion of children in [[foster care]].&lt;ref&gt;Zlotnick, Cheryl, Diana Kronstadt, and Linnea Klee. "Foster care children and family homelessness." American Journal of Public Health 88, no. 9 (1998): 1368-1370.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social isolation is thought to be more a consequence than a cause of family homelessness.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Lisa A. "The relationship between social support and family homelessness: A comparison study of homeless and housed mothers." Journal of Community Psychology 19, no. 4 (1991): 321-332.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solutions==
Some American researchers argue that social programs that either reduce poverty or increase the supply of [[affordable housing]] will be effective in lowering the total number of homeless families.&lt;ref name=mcchesney/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29302">'''Forensic identification''' is the application of [[forensic science]], or "forensics", and technology to identify specific objects from the [[trace evidence]] they leave, often at a [[crime scene]] or the scene of an accident. Forensic means "for the courts".

==Human identification==
[[File:Blooddroplets.JPG|right|thumb|Droplets of [[human blood]]. In addition to analyzing for [[DNA]], the droplets are round and show no spattering, indicating they impacted at a relatively slow velocity, in this case from a height of two feet.]]

People can be identified by their [[fingerprint]]s. This assertion is supported by the philosophy of [[Dermal papillae|friction ridge]] identification, which states that friction ridge identification is established through the agreement of friction ridge formations, in sequence, having sufficient uniqueness to individualize.

Friction ridge identification is also governed by four premises or statements of facts:
# Friction ridges develop on the fetus in their definitive form prior to birth.
# Friction ridges are persistent throughout life except for permanent scarring, disease, or decomposition after death.
# Friction ridge paths and the details in small areas of friction ridges are unique and never repeated.
# Overall, friction ridge patterns vary within limits which allow for classification.

People can also be identified from traces of their DNA from blood, skin, hair, saliva, and semen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CAN DNA DEMAND A VERDICT?{{!}}|url=http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/labs/gel/forensics/|work=Learn Genetics|publisher=The University of Utah|accessdate=2011-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  by [[DNA fingerprinting]], from their [[ear print analysis|ear print]], from their teeth or bite by [[forensic odontology]], from a photograph or a video recording by [[facial recognition system]]s, from the video recording of their walk by [[gait analysis]], from an audio recording by [[voice analysis]], from their handwriting by [[Questioned Document Examination|handwriting analysis]], from the content of their writings by their writing style (e.g. typical phrases, factual bias, and/or misspellings of words), or from other traces using other [[biometric]] techniques.

Since forensic identification has been first introduced to the courts in 1980, the first exoneration due to DNA evidence was in 1989 and there have been 336 additional exonerations since then.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.innocenceproject.org/exonerate/|title=Exonerate the Innocent|date=|website=Innocence Project|publisher=|access-date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who specialize in forensic identification continue to make headway with new discoveries and technological advances to make convictions more accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lehrer|first=M.|date=1998|title=The role of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.

[[Body identification]] is a subfield of forensics concerned with identifying someone from their remains.

=== Foot creases ===
Feet also have friction ridges like fingerprints do. Friction ridges have been widely accepted as a form of identification with fingerprints but not entirely with feet. Feet have creases which remain over time due to the depth it reaches in the dermal layer of the skin, making them permanent.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Massey|first=S. L.|date=2004|title=Persistence of creases of the foot and their value for forensic identification purposes|url=|journal=Journal of Forensic Identification|volume=54|issue=3|page=296|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These creases are valuable when individualizing the owner. The concept of no two fingerprints are alike is also applied to foot creases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blake|first=J. W.|date=1959|title=Identification of the New Born by Flexure Creases|url=|journal=Journal of Language, Identity, &amp; Education|volume=9|issue=9|pages=3–5|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foot creases can grow as early as 13 weeks after conception when the [[Anatomical terms of location|volar pads]] begin to grow and when the pads regress, the creases remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kimura|first=S.|last2=Kitagawa|first2=T.|date=1986|title=Embryological development of human palmar, plantar, and digital flexion creases.|url=|journal=The Anatomical Record|volume= 216|pages=191–197|doi=10.1002/ar.1092160211|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Qamra|first=S.

There is record of foot crease identification used in a criminal case to solve a murder.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. vs. Ybo Airut Jr. Manslaughter Conviction registered in Nunavut Court of Justice, Rankin Inlet, Nunavut Territory, Canada. April 23, 2002 (Offense occurred on December 19, 2000.)&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes with marks left by the foot with ink, blood, mud, or other substances, the appearance of creases or ridges become muddled or extra creases may appear due to cracked skin, folded skin, or fissures. In order to truly compare morphological feature, the prints of feet must be clear enough to distinguish between individuals.

=== Downfalls ===

The two basic conceptual foundations of forensic identification is that everyone is individualized and unique.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cole|first=S.A.|date=2009|title=Forensics without uniqueness, conclusions without individualization: the new epistemology of forensic identification.|url=|journal=Law, Probability, and Risk|edition=3|volume=8|pages=233–255|doi=10.1093/lpr/mgp016|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This individualization belief was invented by a police records clerk, [[Alphonse Bertillon]], based on the idea that "nature never repeats," originating from the father of social statistics, [[Adolphe Quetelet|Lambert Adolphe Jacques Quetelet]]. The belief was passed down through generations being generally accepted, but it was never scientifically proven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Page|first=M.|last2=Taylor|first2=J.|last3=Blenkin|first3=M.|date=April 19, 2011|title=Forensic Identification Science Evidence Since Daubert: Part II—Judicial Reasoning in Decisions to Exclude Forensic Identification Evidence on Grounds of Reliability|url=|journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences|edition=4|volume=56|pages=913–917|doi=10.1111/j.1556-4029.2011.01776.x|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a study done intending to show that no two fingerprints were the same, but the results were inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cummins|first=H.|last2=Mildo|first2=C.|date=1943|title=Finger Prints, Palms and Soles: An Introduction to  Dermatoglyphics|url=|journal=|location=Philadelphia, PA|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many modern forensic and [[evidentiary]] scholars collectively agree that individualization to one object, such as a fingerprint, bite mark, handwriting, or ear mark is not possible. In court cases, forensic scientists can fall victim to [[Observer-expectancy effect|observer bias]] when not sufficiently blinded to the case or results of other pertinent tests. This has happened in cases like ''[http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/11a0221p-06.pdf United States v. Green]'' and ''[https://casetext.com/case/state-v-langill-2 State v. Langill]''. Also, the [http://www.forensic-testing.net/proficiency-tests proficiency tests] that forensic analysts must do are often not as demanding to be considered admissible in court.

=== DNA Identification ===
Forensic [[DNA]] analysis can be a useful tool in aiding forensic identification because DNA is found in almost all cells of our bodies except red blood cells. [[Deoxyribonucleic]] acid is located in two different places of the cell, the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]]; which is inherited from both parents, and the [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondria]]; inherited maternally. Similar to fingerprints, an individual’s [[DNA profile]] and characteristics are unique. Forensic identification using DNA can be useful in different cases such as determining suspects in violent crimes, solving [[DNA paternity testing|paternity]]/maternity, and identifying human remains of victims from mass disasters or missing person cases. &lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; It is also used to link suspects or victims to each other or to crime scenes. When a sample is located at a crime scene, it must be collected, processed, and transported, along with a chain of custody, to the laboratory for analysis, so that if a DNA profile is generated it can be accepted in court. Proper evidence collection and preservation is crucial to ensure evidence is not being contaminated. Main procedures investigators must use when packaging biological material is allowing the evidence to air dry and then package into paper bags. Plastic bags should never be used on biological evidence because it could degrade DNA or lead to bacterial growth. 

DNA can be sourced from [[Organic matter|biological material]] such as semen, blood, saliva, feces, urine, teeth, bone, and hair that is left behind from an individual. There are different [[Presumptive and confirmatory tests|presumptive]] and [[Presumptive and confirmatory tests|confirmatory]] tests used for each type of biological material found at a scene. Presumptive tests are quick, sensitive and are relatively specific to bodily fluids that give the analyst an idea of what might be present. Confirmatory tests confirm what the biological sample is. In addition to looking for biological material at a crime scene, pieces of evidence can also be examined and analyzed for the presence of DNA. Evidence pieces that may have the presence of DNA could include clothing, bedding, weapons, masks, gloves, among many others. This is attributed to [[touch DNA]], where only minute samples are left after an object has been touched. It is defined as “evidence with no visible staining that would likely contain DNA resulting from the transfer of epithelial cells from the skin to an object.” &lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forensicmag.com/article/2013/04/touch-dna-crime-scene-crime-laboratory|title=Touch DNA: From the Crime Scene to the Crime Laboratory|date=2013-04-12|work=Forensic Magazine|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Forensic Scientist|forensic scientist]] can attempt to obtain a DNA profile from the sample with as few as six cells.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 

The first step in the DNA process with a piece of evidence is [[DNA extraction|extraction]]. Extraction is a technique used to remove the DNA from the cell. The next step would be quantification which determines how much DNA is present. The third step is [[Amplification of DNA|amplification]] in order to yield multiple copies of DNA. Next is [[DNA separation by silica adsorption|separation]], to separate the DNA out to use for identification. Finally, the analyst can now complete analysis and interpretation of the DNA sample and compare to known profiles. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.forensicsciencesimplified.org/dna/how.html|title=DNA Evidence: How It’s Done|website=www.forensicsciencesimplified.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An unknown sample found at a crime scene is called a questioned sample. A known sample can be taken either from a suspect or found in a [[database]]. The FBI’s database used for DNA is [[Combined DNA Index System|CODIS]], Combined DNA Index System. It has data at three levels: local, state, and national. The national level data is stored in [[Combined DNA Index System|NDIS]], National DNA Index system. CODIS/NDIS allows analysts to compare their questioned DNA profile among those of arrestees, convicted offenders, and other unknown samples to try and produce investigative leads. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nij.gov/journals/266/Pages/backlogs-codis.aspx|title=What is CODIS? {{!}} National Institute of Justice|website=National Institute of Justice|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; If questioned and known samples are similar, [[statistics]] and interpretation will then be completed. The DNA profile will be compared to a population database and a [[Forensic statistics|random match probability]] will be determined. Random match probability is defined as the chance that an individual selected randomly from a population will have an identical DNA profile to the markers tested. &lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45406517|title=Forensic DNA typing : biology &amp; technology behind STR markers|last=1969-|first=Butler, John M. (John Marshall),|date=2001|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780121479510|location=San Diego|oclc=45406517}}&lt;/ref&gt; If they do not equal each other, they are not a match, termed exclusion.  

During [[Dna Typing|DNA typing]], several markers are examined, termed [[Locus (genetics)|loci]]. When more markers are examined, this could result in either a greater probability that two unrelated individuals will have different [[Genotype|genotypes]] or adds to the confidence of connecting an individual to an unknown sample.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  One locus difference between a questioned and known sample is enough to exclude that suspect as the contributor.  

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] has identified 13 core STR loci that are effective for human identification. STR is [[short tandem repeats]] which are short DNA regions in the [[genome]] and are 2-6 base pairs in length. STR is common in forensic analysis because they are easily amplified using [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) and they have unique variation among individuals for human identification. PCR is the technique of copying DNA by making millions of copies. When all 13 core loci are tested on a DNA profile, the random match probability is more than one in a trillion.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; 

Since DNA was first used in a criminal investigation in 1986, it has aided investigators to solve many cases. DNA profiling is one of the most important tools in forensics and continued research will increase its ability and accuracy to provide more techniques for the future. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.exploredna.co.uk/understanding-forensic-identification.html|title=Understanding Forensic Identification|website=www.exploredna.co.uk|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Animal identification ==

=== Wildlife forensics ===
There are many different applications for wildlife forensics and below are only some of the procedures and processes used to distinguish species.

&lt;u&gt;Species Identification&lt;/u&gt;: The important of species identification is most prominent in animal population that are [[Poaching|illegally hunted]], harvested, and traded,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alacs|first=E. A.|last2=Georges|first2=A.|last3=FitzSimmons|first3=N.

In order to distinguish which species is which, [[Mitochondrial DNA|mtDNA]], or mitochondrial DNA, is the most used [[genetic marker]] because it's easier to [[DNA profiling|type]] from highly decomposed and processed tissue compared to [[nuclear DNA]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Randi|first=E|date=2000|editor-last=Baker|editor-first=A. J.|others=Malden: Blackwell Science|title=Mitochondrial DNA|url=|journal=Molecular methods in ecology|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the mitochondrial DNA has multiple copies per cell,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which is another reason it's frequently used. When nuclear DNA is used, certain segments of the strands are amplified in order to compare those to segments of mitochondrial DNA. This comparison is used to figure out related genes and species proximity since distant relatives of animals are closer in proximity in the gene tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vandamme|first=A|date=2003|editor-last=Salemi M., Vandamme A.|others=New York: Cambridge University Press|title=Basic concepts of molecular evolution|url=|journal=The phylogenetic handbook. A practical approach to DNA and protein phylogeny.|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; That being said, the comparison process demands precision because mistakes can easily be made due to genes evolving and [[Mutation|mutating]] in the evolution of species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maddison|first=W.

&lt;u&gt;Determination of geographic origin:&lt;/u&gt; Determining the origin of a certain species aids research in population numbers and [[Data lineage|lineage data]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Phylogenetics|Phylogenetic]] studies are most often used to find the broad geographic area of which a species reside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Avise|first=J.C.|last2=Arnold|first2=J.|last3=Martin Bal|first3=I.R.|last4=Bermingham|first4=E.|last5=Lamb|first5=T.|last6=Neigel|first6=J.E.|date=1987|title=Intraspecific phylogeography: the mitochondrial DNA bridge between population genetics and systematics.|url=|journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|volume=18|pages=489–522|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.18.1.489|pmid=|access-date=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in California seahorses were being sold for traditional medicinal purposes and the phylogenetic data of those seahorses led researchers to find their origin and from which population they came from and what species they were.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanders|first=J.G.|last2=Cribbs|first2=J.E.|last3=Fienberg|first3=H.G.|last4=Hulburd|first4=G.C.|last5=Katz|first5=L.S.|last6=Palumbi|first6=S.R.|authorlink6=Stephen R.

=== Domestic animal forensics ===
Domestic animals such as dogs and cats can be utilized to help solve criminal cases. These can include homicides, sexual assaults, or robberies. DNA evidence from dogs alone have helped over 20 criminal cases in Great Britain and the U.S. since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halverson|first=J.|last2=Basten|first2=C.|date=2005|title=A PCR multiplex and database for forensic DNA identification of dogs.|url=|journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences|edition=2|volume=50|pages=352–363|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are only a few laboratories though that are able to process and analyze evidence or data from domestic animals.&lt;ref&gt;International Society for Animal Genetics.

[[image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H26569, Frankfurt-Main, Frankfurter Konferenz.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Members of the Frankfurt conference]]
'''Frankfurt Documents''' were a series of documents which were an important step on the way to the founding of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]].

On July 1, 1948 the representatives of the [[Allied-occupied Germany|Western allied occupation forces]] handed over a number of documents to the prime ministers and two ruling mayors from the western zones of occupation, in which the recommendations were made, including establishing a [[West Germany|West German state]]. The main problem of these recommendations was that they did not provide all-German solution, but only a West German state. The Frankfurt documents formed a working basis for the work on the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]]. They were created at the [[London 6-Power Conference]] in early 1948.

The handover took place in the IG Farben Building in [[Frankfurt am Main]], and the documents took the name of this town. The military governors Lucius D. Clay (United States), Marie-Pierre Koenig (France) and Sir Brian Robertson (UK) issued an order establishing a western German state. Present were Peter Altmeier ([[Rhineland-Palatinate]]), Karl Arnold ([[North Rhine-Westphalia]]), Lawrence Bock ([[Württemberg-Hohenzollern]]), Max Brauer ([[Hamburg]]), Hans Ehard ([[Bavaria]]), Wilhelm Kaisen ([[Bremen]]), Hinrich Wilhelm Kopf ([[Lower Saxony]]), Hermann Lüdemann ([[Schleswig-Holstein]]), Reinhold Maier ([[Württemberg-Baden]]), Christian Stock ([[Hessen]]) and Leo Wohleb ([[South Baden|Baden]]).

A West German state was to be established under the following conditions:
[[File:Allied occupied Germany.png|thumb|The borders of military occupied Germany.]]
* There should be a [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]] (German: ''Verfassunggebende Versammlung'', literally, "Constituent Assembly") before September 1, 1948, to draft a constitution shaping a [[Federal republic|federal]] form of government, while maintaining the rights of people and the participating states.
* This constitution should first be approved by the military governments, then a referendum in the countries to ratify the Constitution.
* The respective simple majority in two thirds of eleven West German states should be sufficient for ratification. Constitutional amendments must be approved by the military governors.
* The German foreign policy should continue to be controlled by the military governors in a minimum, as Ruhr questions, repairs, industrial and rights of the Allied forces.
* The boundaries of each state should be reviewed and it should, if necessary, taking into account of traditional forms of  new countries are created, none compared to the other should be too large or too small.

The Frankfurt Documents prompted the Prime Minister to hold [[Rittersturz Conference]] in [[Koblenz]], on the resolutions that were passed.

'''French Cerdagne''' ({{lang-ca|Alta Cerdanya}}, {{IPA-ca|ˈaltə səɾˈðaɲə|IPA}}) is the northern half of [[Cerdanya]], which came under French control as a result of the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] in 1659, while the southern half remained in [[Spain]] (as part of [[Catalonia]]). [[Catalans]] often refer to French Cerdagne as '''Upper Cerdanya''' ({{lang-ca|Alta Cerdanya}}). It is the only French territory in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], as it is on the south side of the [[Pyrenees]] range between Spain and [[France]].&lt;ref name="Sahlins1989"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Sahlins|title=Boundaries: The Making of France and Spain in the Pyrenees|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WPLEOKM1CI8C&amp;pg=PA49|year=1989|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-91121-5|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilstach1931"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Wilstach|title=Along the Pyrenees|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dpw-AAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22stretches%20off%20southwest%22|year=1931|publisher=Robert M.

Macrone|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Segre (river)|Segre]] river, which goes west and then south to meet the [[Ebro]], has its source in the French Cerdagne. An inadvertent result of the Treaty of the Pyrenees is the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[exclave]] of [[Llivia]] (the small uncolored area in the map) which is sovereign Spanish territory completely surrounded by French Cerdagne.  

French Cerdagne has no special status inside France, simply forming an area within the ''[[departments of France|department]]'' of [[Pyrénées-Orientales]], unlike the Spanish part of Cerdanya, which is officially a [[comarques of Catalonia|Catalan ''comarca'']] called simply [[Cerdanya (comarca)|Cerdanya]]. In France, the French area is referred to as either ''Cerdagne française'' (i.e. "French Cerdagne"), ''Haute Cerdagne'' (i.e. "Upper Cerdagne") or just ''Cerdagne''.

French Cerdagne has a land area of 539.67 km² (208.37 sq. miles). Its 1999 population was 12,035, resulting in a density of only 22 people per km² (58 per sq. mile).

French Cerdagne has the most cloud-free days in [[France]], and was therefore chosen as the place to build:

{{other uses|Green Left (disambiguation){{!}}Green Left}}
{{Green politics sidebar|Schools}}
The term '''green left''' is used primarily to refer to a combination of [[environmentalism]], [[feminism]], [[socialism]] and [[pacifism]] in countries where the term is used. It is primarily a [[social justice]] and [[human rights]] oriented ideology, with an expansion in focus to the [[animal rights|rights of other species]]. 

The name "[[Green Left (disambiguation)|Green Left]]" is also used by a variety of organisations which espouse socialist or Marxist principles, but with a greater emphasis on environmental preservation than previous iterations of [[socialism]] and [[communism]].

== Politics ==
=== Europe ===
In [[Europe]], the green left arose partly out of the declining [[Eurocommunism|Eurocommunist]] tendency that has been mostly associated with various communist parties in the continent. As a result, many former communist parties and remnants of communist parties were either reestablished or fused into existing [[Green party|green parties]].

Far-left political parties or [[Electoral alliance|joint electoral lists]] have been formed over the years, most often between [[Marxism|Marxist]] and radical greens. In the [[Netherlands]], the [[GroenLinks]] party was formed in 1989 by a merger of a [[Communist Party of the Netherlands|communist]], [[Pacifist Socialist Party|pacifist]], [[Evangelical People's Party (Netherlands)|left-wing Christian]] and [[Political Party of Radicals|green]] parties. In December 2007, an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Electoral alliance|electoral coalition]] of the radical left was formed known as [[The Left – The Rainbow]], comprising [[Federation of the Greens]], two communist parties and a small [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] party.

=== Elsewhere ===
The green left has also been prominent in the [[green politics]] outside of Europe, especially in the [[United States]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], although these green parties may involve themselves in alliances with otherwise conservative political organisations in [[blue–green alliance]]s.

{{Politics of Lebanon}}

The '''Guardians of the Cedars ''' ('''GoC'''') ([[Arabic]]: حراس الأرز; ''Ḥurrās al-Arz''; [[French language|French]]: ''Gardiens du Cedre'' or ''Gardiens des Cèdres'', ''GdC''') are a [[far-right]] [[ultranationalist]] [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] party and former Christian [[militia]] in Lebanon. It was formed by [[Étienne Saqr]] (also known with the [[kunya (Arabic)|kunya]] or ''nom de guerre''  "Abu Arz" or "Father of the Cedars") and others along with the Lebanese Renewal Party in the early 1970s. It operated in the [[Lebanese Civil War]] under the slogan: ''Lebanon, at your service.''

==Creation==

The Guardians of the Cedars started to form a militia in the years leading up to the Lebanese Civil War and commenced military operations in April 1975.

In September 1975, Communiqué No. 1 was issued to denounce advocates of the partition of Lebanon. The second communiqué contained a bitter attack on the [[Palestinians]]. The third articulated the party's attitude on the issue of Lebanese identity: Lebanon should dissociate itself from Arabism. The party spread its messages by means of [[graffiti]] in East [[Beirut]], including slogans against [[Syria]], the "[[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] Resistance", and [[Pan-Arabism]], sometimes with violent anti-Palestinian tones, as in the slogan على  كل  لبناني  ان  يقتل  فلسطينياً ("''It is a duty for each Lebanese to kill a Palestinian''").&lt;ref&gt;Chakhtoura, ''La guerre des graffiti'' (2005), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Etienne Saqr, "The Ideology of the Guardians of the Cedars" (Lebanon 1977) original Title: من عقيدة حراس الأرز&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;فضل شرورو "الأحزاب و التنظيمات و القوى في لبنان 1930-1980" بيروت 1981&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Micheal Kuderna, "Christliche gruppen im Libanon (Wiesbaden 1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guardians of the Cedars joined other pro-status quo, mainly Christian Lebanese militias in 1976 to form the [[Lebanese Front]].

===1970s===
In March 1976, they confronted Palestinian and leftist forces in West [[Beirut]]. A Guardians unit was also dispatched to [[Zaarour]], above the mountain road to [[Zahlé]], to support [[Phalangist]] forces. In April, Guardian fighters held a line in the area of [[Hadath]], [[Kfar Shima]], and [[Bsaba]], south of Beirut, against a coalition of Palestinian, [[Progressive Socialist Party|PSP]], and [[Syrian Social Nationalist Party|SSNP]] forces.

In the summer of 1976, the Guardians were among the first militias to assault [[Tel al-Zaatar Massacre|Tel al-Zaatar]], the last remaining Palestinian refugee camp in east Beirut. The camp fell after a 52-day siege.

The actions of the Guardians and their allies following the capture of the camp have been widely reported as amounting to a [[Tel al-Zaatar Massacre|massacre]] of many of its civilian inhabitants. During this battle, [[Étienne Saqr|Saqr]] led a unit of Guardians force to [[Chekka]], where Christian civilians were being sieged by leftist-Palestinian forces, and fought off the Palestinian forces.

The Guardians and allied Christian militias then invaded the [[Koura District|Koura]] region in northern Lebanon and reached [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]], to support Christian residents trapped by fighting.  In 1978 as part of the Lebanese Front they did small attacks on the Syrian army in Beirut and again in 1981 in the Battle of Zahle. This came after the alliance between the Phalanges and most Christian groups with the Syrians had taken a twist.

During the war, the Guardians earned a reputation for specializing in cruelty. Militia members usually tied Palestinian prisoners to the backs of taxis and then dragged them up the motorway into Jounieh. Their carcasses would then be flung into a dried-up riverbed. Commanding his followers to slay all Palestinians, Saqr once stated, "If you feel compassion for the Palestinian women and children, remember they are communists and will bear new communists".&lt;ref name=Fisk&gt;Fisk, ''Pity the Nation'' (2001), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
In 1985 the Guardians of the Cedars mounted a fierce defense of [[Kfar-Fallus]] and [[Jezzine]], battling Palestinians and Shiite-Druze militias and protected thousands of Christians in South Lebanon.

Towards the close of the 1980s, and continuing to 2000, most of the remaining fighting in Lebanon occurred in the south, inside the Israeli-occupied zone, under the Southern-Lebanese-Army influence led by [[Saad Haddad]] and later by [[Antoine Lahd]], the latter who had close ties with the [[National Liberal Party (Lebanon)|National Liberal Party]] (Al Ahrar in Arabic).  The Guardians and other militias were largely reorganized into the [[South Lebanon Army]], preserving much of the early ideology while adopting new military tactics.

==Military structure and organization==
The LRP militia began to be quietly raised in 1974 by Sakr in his capacity as president of the Party, though it was only in September 1975 when they made their existence public in an official communiqué as the Guardians of the Cedars.  Headquartered at the main LRP party' Offices in [[Ashrafieh]] and personally commanded by Sakr, the GoC initially numbered some 500 men and women&lt;ref&gt;Makdisi and Sadaka, ''The Lebanese Civil War, 1975-1990'' (2003), p. 44, Table 1: War Period Militias.&lt;/ref&gt; trained by [[Kayrouz Baraket]], a young [[Lebanese Army]] officer, and equipped with obsolete firearms purchased on the [[black market]]. Although the membership of the GoC was exclusively [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronite]], Sakr allegedly maintained a loyal personal bodyguard made up of [[Shia Islam in Lebanon|Lebanese Shia Muslims]], but little is known about them.  The collapse of the Lebanese Army in January 1976 allowed Sakr to recruit army deserters and seize some heavy equipment from its barracks and [[Internal Security Forces]] (ISF) Police stations, swelling the GoC ranks to 3,000-6,000 uniformed militiamen armed with modern small-arms. 
Besides being provided with funds and training by the [[Kataeb Party]] and the [[Al-Tanzim]], the Guardians also claimed to have received direct aid from [[Israel]] as early as 1974.  They were the only faction of the [[Lebanese Front]] that never received any military aid from [[Syria]], which is hardly surprising, given their strong anti-Syrian views.

===Weapons and equipment===
They fielded a mechanized force consisting of a single [[Super Sherman|M50 Super Sherman]] medium tank, some [[M113 armored personnel carrier]]s, a few [[M42 Duster]] [[Self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon|SPAAG]]s and [[Bravia Chaimite|Chaimite V200]]&lt;ref&gt;http://milinme.wordpress.com/category/v-200-chaimite – An ex-ISF V-200 Chaimite employed by the Guardians of the Cedars pictured at Houche-el-Oumara during the Battle for Zahle, April–June 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; armoured cars backed by [[gun-truck]]s or [[Technical (vehicle)|technicals]]. The latter consisted of [[Land Rover Series|Land-Rover series II-III]], [[Toyota Land Cruiser (J40)]], [[Dodge Power Wagon|Dodge Power Wagon W200]], [[Jeep Gladiator|Jeep J20 pickup trucks]], [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] Sierra Custom K25/K30, Chevrolet C-10 Cheyenne and Chevrolet C-20 Scottsdale light pickups, plus US GMC C7500 heavy-duty trucks and [[M35 2½-ton cargo truck|M35A1 2½-ton 6x6 cargo trucks]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tumblr.com/search/guardians%20of%20the%20cedars – GoC M35 gun-truck with ZU-23-2 AA autocannon, c.1976.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alsminiature.com/m.34.gardien.cedre.htm – miniature of GoC truck with Anti-Aircraft autocannon.&lt;/ref&gt; fitted with [[heavy machine guns]] (HMGs), [[recoilless rifles]] and [[anti-aircraft]] [[autocannons]].

===Activities and areas of operations===
In stark contrast to other Christian factions, the LRP/GoC despised any illegal activities such as [[drug-trafficking]], [[extortion]] or looting, and their leader Sakr never sought to establish an autonomous personal fiefdom. Although the Guardians' claimed that they did not center their military operations on 'turf', they did maintained strongholds at the [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronite]] quarters of [[East Beirut]], the adjacent [[Matn District]] ([[Laqluk]], near [[Akoura]]), the [[Batroun District]] ([[Tannourine]]), the eastern [[Keserwan District]] ([[Ayoun es-Simane]]) and the [[Jabal Amel]] region ([[Kfar-Fallus]], [[Jezzine]], [[Marjayoun]], [[Qlaiaa]], [[Ain Ebel]] and [[Rumeish]]).  In May 1979 they even clashed with the NLP [[Tigers Militia]] in Beirut for control of the [[Furn esh Shebbak]] and [[Ain el-Rammaneh]] districts, and for the town of Akoura in the Matn.&lt;ref&gt;O'Ballance, ''Civil War in Lebanon'' (1998), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political beliefs==
The Guardians hold to several key beliefs:
* Lebanon is an ancient nation of unique ethnicity.
* Modern Lebanese people descended from the [[Phoenicianism|Phoenicians]].
* Phoenicia was the father of early [[Western civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvlIrWk9utI|title=Phoenician DNA |publisher=Al Jazeera|date=2009-01-28 |accessdate=2009-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This has led the Guardians of the Cedars to maintain that Lebanese people are not Arabs. The political consequence of this stance advocates the 'de-Arabization' of Lebanon. Similarly, followers draw a distinction between [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and 'Lebanese', aiming to restore the form created by Lebanese philosopher [[Said Akl]]. The Guardians of the Cedars have adopted positions hostile to [[Pan-Arabism]]. This is believed to be the main reason why they did not grow as a party in Lebanon outside the Maronite community.

&lt;!-- Commented out: [[Image:Etienne Saqr.JPG|thumb|200px|Etienne Saqr, founder of the Guardians of the Cedars.]] --&gt;
[[Étienne Saqr|Saqr]] himself had fought against pan-Arab forces back in the [[Lebanon Crisis of 1958]]. During that time [[Camille Chamoun]] entered Lebanon in the [[Baghdad Pact]] led by the US, but faced stiff resistance from a huge section of the Lebanese people, and this later led to the failure of this alliance.

After heavy Palestinian involvement in the [[Lebanese Civil War]], the Guardians cultivated ties with the [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli military]], receiving weapons and support.  Some followers maintain that this was a collaboration of necessity, and not an ideological agreement with the Israelis.  Others disagree, claiming that collaboration with Israel was based on the conviction that there was a commonality of interest between the two countries.  Other similarly aligned militias, such as the [[Phalangists]], [[National Liberal Party (Lebanon)|Ahrar]]  and the [[Tigers Militia (Lebanon)|Tigers]], also cooperated semi-secretly with [[Israel]]. This cooperation was later emphasized by Saqr who said: "Lebanon's power is in Israel's power, and Lebanon's weakness lies in Israel's weakness".

This alliance with Israel played a major role in banning the party, and expelling its members who mostly fled to Israel. Saqr who now lives in Nicosia Cyprus  has since admitted that Israel has been funding the group throughout its existence, even before the war began. Saqr is now considered as a traitor to the Lebanese government, alongside the likes of [[Antoine Lahad]] who resides in Tel Aviv under Mossad protection.

According to an Israeli military observer Haim 'Arev, the soldiers of the Guardians of the Cedars were the best and most experienced fighters among the militias that constituted the Lebanese Front. He draws a direct connection between the patriotic ideology of the Guardians and the superior battle capacity of their fighters. He states that while the Guardians were among the smaller parties of the Lebanese Civil war, it's idealistic men and women were soldiers of the best caliber. Later, in Southern Lebanon, the Guardians fighters had a reputation for being exceptionally motivated and among the toughest fighters in the ranks of the SLA.&lt;ref&gt;Nisan, ''The conscience of Lebanon'' (2003), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Front of the Guardians of the Cedar ==

The '''Front of the Guardians of the Cedar – FGoC''' ([[Arabic]]: الجبهة لحراس الأرز transliteration ''Al-Jabhat li-Hurras el-Arz''), sometimes known by its Arabic acronym, '''JIHA''', was a pre-dominantly Christian right-wing grouping that appeared in 1974. Apparently a splinter of the Guardians of the Cedars, they held similar views to those of this party – expressed just prior to the war in anti-[[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] graffiti bearing the 'JIHA' signature scrubbed in the walls of [[east Beirut]]'s buildings – very little is known about this small and obscure organization. Estimated at about 100 members, the JIHA operated mainly in the eastern sector of the Lebanese Capital during the [[Lebanese Civil War#First phase of the war.2C 1975-77|1975-77 phase of the Lebanese Civil War]], but nothing was heard from them afterwards. It is assumed that they might have been re-absorbed into the GoC or by the [[Lebanese Forces (militia)|Lebanese Forces]] in 1977.

==Lebanese Renewal Party==

The '''Lebanese Renewal Party – LRP''' ([[Arabic]]: حزب التجدد اللبناني transliteration ''Hezb al-Tajaddud al-Lubnani'') or '''Parti de la Renovation Libanaise (PRL)''' in [[French language|French]],  is a banned [[political party]] in [[Lebanon]] formed in 1972 as the [[political]] arm of the [[paramilitary]] force known as the Guardians of the Cedars. It is often characterized as [[right-wing]] [[extremist]], but by its followers as a [[Patriotism|patriot]]ic [[nationalist]] movement. The party is still led by its founder, [[Étienne Saqr]] (Abu Arz).{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

===History===

It was formed by [[right-wing]] activists opposed to the presence of the [[Palestinian refugee]]s in Lebanon. The refugee population also included a substantial element of [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) fighters, especially after the 1970 [[Black September in Jordan|Black September]] events in [[Jordan]]. This created severe tension in Lebanon, and is believed by many to have been a driving factor behind the outbreak of civil war in 1975.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

During the [[Lebanese Civil War]], the party and its militia were a small but active part of the [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronite]]-led alliance fighting the [[Palestinians]] represented by the [[Rejectionist Front]] and PLO, and its allies in the [[Lebanese National Movement]] (LNM) of [[Kamal Jumblatt]]. During the early fighting in the war, the party was implicated in the massacres of [[Karantina massacre|Karantina]] and [[Siege of Tel al-Zaatar|Tel al-Zaatar]]. In 1977, the main Christian-backed militias (LRP plus the [[National Liberal Party (Lebanon)|National Liberal Party]] and the [[Kataeb Party]]) formed the [[Lebanese Front]] coalition. Their militias joined under the name of the [[Lebanese Forces (militia)|Lebanese Forces]], but the Lebanese Forces soon fell under the command of [[Bashir Gemayel]] and the Phalange. The Lebanese Renewal Party (LRP) and the Guardians of the Cedars were uncompromisingly opposed to the [[Syrian occupation of Lebanon]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

After the [[1982 Lebanon War]] the party cooperated with [[Israel Defense Forces]], and its militia joined the [[South Lebanon Army]] (SLA). After the withdrawal of Israel from Lebanon in 2000, most of the leadership fled to [[Israel]]. The group was banned by the [[Syria]]n-dominated government and decided to give up its arms to become a traditional political party. It remains banned, and is only a minor force in national life. Still, some of the rhetoric used by the LRP in advocating its domestic policies was revived during the [[Cedar Revolution]] in 2005, which forced the withdrawal of Syria from Lebanon and led to expectations of political reform.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

===Ideological beliefs===
{{main|Phoenicianism}}

The Lebanese Renewal Party is [[ethnocentric]], and believes that Lebanon is not an [[Arab]] country. It labored extensively to create or discover non-Arab cultural expressions, and went so far as to design a new [[alphabet]] for [[Lebanese Arabic]], which it claims is a language in its own right.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} Accordingly, the party was staunchly opposed to [[Pan-Arabism]], which was advocated by many in the [[left-wing]] Lebanese National Movement (LNM) and Palestinian movements.

Another distinguishing element of the party's politics was that it advocated cooperation with Israel. While there were several other movements on the Christian side in Lebanon that cooperated with Israel during the war, the LNR was the only organization openly and ideologically committed to this, regarding a Lebanese-Israeli axis as the best protection against Arabism and the Palestinians.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

==Attitude towards Palestinians and Lebanese Muslims==

The GoC was strongly anti-Palestinian, and argued for the forcible removal of all Palestinians and other non-Lebanese (e.g. Syrians) from Lebanon, both civilians and armed fighters. Critics labeled this a call for [[ethnic cleansing]] or [[genocide]]. GoC leader [[Étienne Saqr|Saqr]] summed up the organization's attitude to Palestinians in an interview with the ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'' on July 23, 1982:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is the Palestinians we have to deal with. Ten years ago there were 84,000; now there are between 600,000 and 700,000. In six years there will be two million. We can't let it come to that." His solution: "Very simple. We shall drive them to the borders of brotherly [[Syria]] ... Anyone who looks back, stops or returns will be shot on the spot. We have the moral right, reinforced by well-organized public relations plans and political preparations."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, in contrast to the policies of many other sectarian militias (such as the [[Kataeb]]), and to their own attitudes towards Palestinians, the Guardians took some care to avoid the impression of religious conflict. The party, while essentially a Christian militia and in violent conflict with most militias during the war, was formally secularist as it publicly stressed this Secular [[Nationalism|Nationalist]] identity.

==End of the militia==
1989 saw the Guardians once more fighting the [[Syria]]ns alongside the [[Lebanese Army]] in support of the Lebanese government of General [[Michel Aoun]]. In a statement in 1990, the GoC greeted the occupation of [[Kuwait]] by [[Saddam Hussein]] by asserting that "Arabism is the undisputed lie of the 20th century." The Guardians called upon the people to rally around the leadership of General Aoun, and demanded the withdrawal of Lebanon from the [[Arab League]].

As the Lebanese Civil War drew to a close in 1990, political changes weakened the right-wing movements which had existed in earlier decades.  In October 1990, as part of the end of the war, the reorganized Lebanese government forced Prime Minister [[Michel Aoun|Aoun]] out of power under Syrian demands and commands. From this year on, Syria occupied Lebanon until its withdrawal in 2005.

[[Samir Geagea]]'s [[Lebanese Forces (militia)|Lebanese Forces]] militia captured [[Etienne Saqr]] because he had supported [[Michel Aoun|Aoun]].  During this incident, he suffered an unspecified injury.  He was forced to seek refuge in [[Jezzine]], and finally left Lebanon for Europe after Israel pulled its forces out of Lebanon.  Several other members of the Guardians are presently wanted by the Lebanese government, in order to answer for war-crimes.

From the end of the civil war in 1990 until the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000 the Guardians of the Cedars formed an element of the now-defunct [[South Lebanon Army]]. Since that date their military operations have ceased and they operate solely politically, campaigning to remove the Syrian presence in Lebanon. In common with the Christian and Sunni-dominated [[March 14 Alliance]], the party has expressed its support for the [[Syrian civil war|Syrian uprising]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/notes/etienne-sakr-abu-arz/july-31-2012/351586278260974 Statement by The Guardians of the Cedars Party - The Movement for Lebanese Nationalism on July 31, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gotc.info/images/Statements/TheCommander/English/2012/bayeen_3_20_12_en_The%20Syrian%20Revolution%20in%20Its%20Second%20Year%20A%20Balance%20Sheet.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gotc.info/images/Statements/TheCommander/English/2013/bayeen_3_12_13_en.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Movement of Lebanese Nationalism==
Today, the reorganized Guardians of the Cedars is a legal and fully functional political party; lately, the term '''Movement of Lebanese Nationalism''' ([[Arabic]]: حركة القومية اللبنانية transliterated as ''Harakat al-Qawmiyya al-Lubnaniyya'') abbreviated as '''MLN'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gotc.org/ Official website of "The Guardians of the Cedars Party - Movement of Lebanese Nationalism"]&lt;/ref&gt; was added to its name and it is now known as '''The Guardians of the Cedars Party - Movement of Lebanese Nationalism''' (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] حزب حراس الأرز- حركة القومية اللبنانية).

'''Hostile vehicle mitigation (HVM)''' is a generic term that covers a suite of anti-terrorist protective measures that are often employed around buildings or publicly accessible spaces/venues of particular significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hostile vehicle mitigation {{!}} Public Website|url=https://www.cpni.gov.uk/hostile-vehicle-mitigation|website=www.cpni.gov.uk|accessdate=3 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reference Manual to Mitigate Potential Terrorist Attacks Against Buildings|url=https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-1455-20490-6222/fema426.pdf|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design of these various vehicle security barriers and landscape treatments came about as security authorities across the globe sought to mitigate the effects of [[Car bomb|vehicle borne improvised explosive devices]] (VBIED).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cormie|first1=edited by David|last2=Mays|first2=Geoff|last3=Smith|first3=Peter|title=Blast effects on buildings|date=2009|publisher=Thomas Telford Ltd|location=London|isbn=978-0-7277-3521-8|pages=250–273|edition=2nd|url=http://www.frontierpitts.com/fileadmin/user_upload/downloads/cpni/blast_effects_on_buildings_2nd_ed_chapter_11.pdf|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sorts of places that warrant consideration as potential terrorist targets in need of HVM include: government buildings, airports, large railway stations, sports venues, concentrations of entertainment and crowded night time economy, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crowded Places Guidance|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/619411/170614_crowded-places-guidance_v1.pdf|publisher=NaCTSO|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aston|first1=Heath|title=Terror guidelines urge blast mitigation measures for busy public areas|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/terror-guidelines-urge-blast-mitigation-measures-for-busy-public-areas-20160413-go58l5.html|accessdate=3 July 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common types of HVM include locally manufactured barrier systems such as the [[Jersey barrier|Jersey Barrier]] and [[Bremer wall|Bremer T Wall]]; as well as propriety crash-tested and engineered vehicle bollard systems designed to resist the effects of a [[Vehicle-ramming attack|vehicle ram attack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=TAL|first1=1/11|title=Vehicle security barriers within the streetscape (TAL 01/11) - GOV.UK|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vehicle-security-barriers-within-the-streetscape|website=www.gov.uk|publisher=UK Government|accessdate=28 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; HVM can also include adapted hard landscape features, resistive street furniture, sculpture, planters and significant level changes; with a little imagination HVM may be disguised inside architectural features in a street scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Integrated Security - a Public Realm Design Guide for Hostile Vehicle Mitigation - Second Edition|url=https://www.cpni.gov.uk/system/files/documents/40/20/Integrated%20Security%20Guide.pdf|website=CPNI|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McPhee|first1=Rod|title=Latest weapon against terrorism appearing all over UK but you won't have noticed|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/latest-weapon-against-terrorism-been-10088354|accessdate=3 July 2017|work=UK Daily Mirror|publisher=Mirror Newspapers|date=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[ISO]] IWA 14-1 - an international working agreement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IWA 14-1:2013 - Vehicle security barriers -- Part 1: Performance requirement, vehicle impact test method and performance rating|url=https://www.iso.org/standard/64736.html|website=www.iso.org|accessdate=3 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[BSI Group|BSI]] [[Publicly Available Specification|PAS]] 68 - the UK standard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PAS 68:2013 - Impact test specifications for vehicle security barrier systems|url=http://shop.bsigroup.com/ProductDetail/?pid=000000000030273707|website=shop.bsigroup.com|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[ASTM International|ASTM]] F2656-07 - the US standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASTM F2656 / F2656M - 15 Standard Test Method for Crash Testing of Vehicle Security Barriers|url=https://www.astm.org/Standards/F2656.htm|website=www.astm.org|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These standards set roughly similar criteria for destructive impact testing, although there are differences between the three and vehicle geometries in particular are at the root of some of these differences. HVM barrier selection will be conditioned by a hostile [[vehicle dynamics]] study carried out by a suitably qualified security specialist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Section|first1=9|title=Recognising the terrorist threat - GOV.UK|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/recognising-the-terrorist-threat/recognising-the-terrorist-threat|website=www.gov.uk|accessdate=3 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This hostile vehicle mitigation is a common form of target hardening and is designed to prevent a vehicle being rammed into the building or into people on the pavement next to the building. It also enforces a zone of protective stand-off from any explosive detonation location]]

Ideally a protective layer of HVM  should surround the building or place being protected and this HVM protection line should be stood off from the building facade or places expected to be crowded. This protective standoff distance is critical in the case of VBIEDs as 'every metre counts' and often distance is one of the best ways to achieve explosive blast effects mitigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE DEVICE (IED) GUIDELINES FOR PLACES OF MASS GATHERING|url=https://www.nationalsecurity.gov.au/Media-and-publications/Publications/Documents/IED-Guidelines/IED-guidelines-places-mass-gathering.pdf|publisher=ANZCTC|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FEMA 426, Chapter 4|url=https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-1455-20490-7465/fema426_ch4.pdf|publisher=US Government|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Southbridgearsenal.jpg|thumb|left|The ARSENAL lettering in the foreground of the Emirates Stadium is an example of disguised HVM]]

More recently the focus of HVM has expanded to reduce the potential for vehicle ram attacks directed at crowded events and places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protecting Crowded Places: Design and Technical Issues|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/97992/design-tech-issues.pdf|publisher=HM Government|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent non-VBIED (i.e. vehicle as a weapon) attacks against pedestrians include:

* The [[2016 Nice attack]]
* The [[Ohio State University attack|2016 Ohio State University attack]] 
* The [[2016 Berlin attack]]

* The [[2017 Stockholm attack]]
* The [[2017 Westminster attack]]
* The [[June 2017 London Bridge attack|2017 London Bridge attack]]
* The [[2017 Finsbury Park attack]]

HVM can also be used to protect against [[Ram-raiding|ram raids]] which are invariably criminal attacks against high net-worth targets such as jewelers, [[Cash-in-transit|cash and valuables in transit]] depots, [[bullion]] storage facilities, art galleries, museums, 'high end' fashion stores, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Louks|first1=Dominic|title=S10 - Guidance for protection of premises against vehicle attack (ram raid)|url=http://www.riscauthority.co.uk/free-document-library/RISCAuthority-Library_detail.s10-guidance-for-protection-of-premises-against-vehicle-attack-ram-raid.html|website=www.riscauthority.co.uk|accessdate=3 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Correctly installed HVM barrier systems should not adversely affect pedestrian permeability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bollards and Pedestrian Movement, TAL 2/13|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/565603/tal-2-13-bollards-pedestrian-movement.pdf|publisher=HM Government|accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2014 the nature of the insurgency has changed with the [[Houthi takeover in Yemen]] and then into the ongoing [[Yemeni civil war (2015–present)]] with a major [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen|Saudi-led intervention in Yemen]] beginning in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8413450.stm|title=Crises multiply for divided Yemen|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

General [[Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar]] commanded the Yemeni security forces during the conflict and led all the government offensives from 2004 until 2011, when he resigned his post to defend protesters during the [[Yemeni Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/05/20115228013977326.html|title=The crucible of Yemen|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=22 May 2011|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Houthi [[2014–15 Yemeni coup d'état|power grab]] in [[Sana'a]] escalated on 20 January 2015, when the rebels attacked the president's residence and swept into the presidential palace. President [[Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi]] was inside the residence as it came under "heavy shelling" for half an hour, but he was unharmed and protected by guards, according to Information Minister [[Nadia Al-Sakkaf]]. Presidential guards surrendered the residence after being assured that Hadi could safely evacuate. The [[United Nations Security Council|U.N. Security Council]] called an emergency meeting about the unfolding events. United Nations Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon|Ban Ki Moon]] expressed concern over the "deteriorating situation" in Yemen and urged all sides to cease hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rebels capture Yemen presidential palace, shell residence|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/01/20/yemen-shiite-rebels/22038397/|accessdate=20 January 2015|date=20 January 2015|newspaper=USA today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yemen rebels overtake presidential palace|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/1/20/yemen-crisis-negotiations.html|accessdate=20 January 2015|date=20 January 2015|newspaper=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 January, President [[Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi]] and Prime Minister [[Khaled Bahah]] tendered their resignations to parliament, which reportedly refused to accept them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-30936940|agency=BBC|title=Yemen crisis: President resigns as rebels tighten hold|date=January 22, 2015|accessdate=January 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{One source|section|date=May 2015}}
In 1962, a [[Yemen Arab Republic|revolution]] in [[Upper Yemen|North Yemen]] ended over 1,000 years of rule by [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] [[Imams of Yemen|Imams]], who claimed descent from the [[Prophets in Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]]. [[Sa'dah]], in the north, was their main stronghold and since their fall from power the region was largely ignored economically and remains underdeveloped. The Yemeni government has little authority in Sa'dah.&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera1"&gt;{{cite news| title=Profile: Yemen's Houthi fighters| url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2009/08/200981294214604934.html|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]| date=2009-07-12| accessdate=2009-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Yemen's [[1994 civil war in Yemen|1994 civil war]], the [[Wahhabi movement|Wahhabis]], an Islamic group adhering to a strict version of [[Sunni Islam]] found in neighboring Saudi Arabia, helped the government in its fight against the [[Democratic Republic of Yemen|secessionist south]]. Zaidis complain the government has subsequently allowed the Wahhabis too strong a voice in Yemen. Saudi Arabia, for its part, worries that strife instigated by the Zaidi sect so close to Yemen's border with Saudi Arabia could stir up groups in Saudi Arabia itself.&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera1"/&gt;

The conflict was sparked in 2004 by the government's attempt to arrest [[Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi]], a Zaidi religious leader of the [[Houthis]] and a former parliamentarian on whose head the government had placed a $55,000 bounty.&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera1"/&gt;

[[Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi]] movement accused [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]] of massive financial corruption and criticized him for being backed by Saudi Arabia and United States&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/markaz/2017/12/18/who-are-the-houthis-and-why-are-we-at-war-with-them/|title=Who are the Houthis, and why are we at war with them?|last=Riedel|first=Bruce|date=2017-12-18|work=[[Brookings Institution]]|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en-US|author-link=Bruce Riedel}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the expense of the Yemeni people&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3643600.stm|title=Yemeni forces kill rebel cleric|date=10 September 2004|newspaper=BBC News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061121091116/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3643600.stm|archivedate=21 November 2006|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Yemen's sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/briefly/2015/02/12/5-things-houthis-yemen/|title=5 Things to Know About the Houthis of Yemen|last=Streuly|first=Dick|date=2015-02-12|website=WSJ|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Motives and objectives==
When armed conflict for the first time erupted in 2004 between the Yemeni government and Houthis, the [[Ali Abdullah Saleh|then Yemeni president]] accused Houthis and other Islamic opposition parties of trying to overthrow the government and the republican system. The Yemeni government alleged that the Houthis were seeking to overthrow it and to implement Zaidi [[religious law]].

Houthi leaders for their part rejected the accusation by saying that they had never rejected the president or the republican system but were only defending themselves against government attacks on their community.&lt;ref name="arrabyee-2005"/&gt; The Houthis said that they were "defending their community against discrimination" and government aggression.&lt;ref name="Deadly blast"&gt;{{cite news|title=Deadly blast strikes Yemen mosque|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7379929.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2008-05-02|accessdate=2008-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yemeni government has accused [[Iran]] of directing and financing the insurgency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnsen|first=Gregory D.|date=February 20, 2007|title=Yemen Accuses Iran of Meddling in its Internal Affairs|journal=Terrorism Focus|volume=4|issue=2|pages=3–4|url=http://www.jamestown.org/terrorism/news/uploads/tf_004_002.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-04-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616045131/http://www.jamestown.org/terrorism/news/uploads/tf_004_002.pdf |archivedate=June 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a February 2015 ''[[Newsweek]]'' report, Houthis are fighting "for things that all Yemenis crave: government accountability, the end to corruption, regular utilities, fair fuel prices, job opportunities for ordinary Yemenis and the end of Western influence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Photo Essay: The Rise of the Houthis|url=http://www.newsweek.com/photo-essay-rise-houthis-305511|newspaper=[[Newsweek]]|date=9 February 2015|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with the ''[[Yemen Times]]'', Hussein Al-Bukhari, a Houthi insider, said that the Houthis' preferred political system is a republic with elections where women can also hold political positions, and that they do not seek to form a cleric-led government after the model of the [[Politics of Iran|Islamic Republic of Iran]] for "we cannot apply this system in Yemen because the followers of the [[Shafi]] doctrine are bigger in number than the Zaydis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yementimes.com/en/1826/intreview/4467/Al-Bukhaiti-to-the-Yemen-Times-"The-Houthis'-takeover-can-not-be-called-an-invasion".htm|title=Al-Bukhari to the Yemen Times: "The Houthis' takeover can not be called an invasion"|newspaper=[[Yemen Times]]|date=21 October 2014|access-date=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|Timeline of the Yemeni conflict (2011–present)}}

===Phase 1: June–September 2004===
From June to August 2004, government troops battled supporters of al-Houthi in the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Clashes 'leave 118 dead' in Yemen| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3863463.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]]| date=2004-07-03| accessdate=2007-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of the dead range from 500 to 1,000.&lt;ref name="ploughshares1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ploughshares.ca/libraries/ACRText/ACR-Yemen.htm#Status |title=Armed Conflicts Report - Yemen |publisher=Ploughshares.ca |accessdate=2009-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030054141/http://www.ploughshares.ca/libraries/ACRText/ACR-Yemen.htm |archivedate=2009-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 September, Yemeni forces killed al-Houthi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Yemeni forces kill rebel cleric| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3643600.stm| publisher=[[BBC News]]| date=2004-09-10| accessdate=2007-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the rebellion has been led by one of his brothers, [[Abdul-Malik al-Houthi]],&lt;ref name="arrabyee-2005"&gt;{{cite news|first=Nasser |last=Arrabyee |title=Rebellion continues |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/743/re10.htm |work=[[Al-Ahram Weekly]] |date=2005-05-25 |accessdate=2007-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070619181842/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/743/re10.htm |archivedate=2007-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while his father, Badr Eddin al-Houthi, became the group's spiritual leader.&lt;ref name=shabab&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/shabab-al-moumineen.htm|title=al-Shabab al-Mum'en / Shabab al-Moumineen (Believing Youth) |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|accessdate=29 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phase 2: March–June 2005===
Between March and April 2005, some 1,500 people were killed in a resurgence of fighting between government forces and supporters of the slain cleric, now calling themselves Houthis.&lt;ref name="ploughshares1"/&gt;

In May 2005, the rebels rejected an offer of a [[presidential pardon]] by President [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]] after their conditions for surrender were refused by the government and minor clashes continued. On May 21, the government released estimates of the impact of the insurgency, announcing that it was responsible for 552 deaths, 2,708 injures, and over [[US$]] 270 million in economic damages.&lt;ref name="arrabyee-2005"/&gt;

On 23 June 2005, the Houthis' military commander [[Abdullah al-Ruzami]] surrendered to Yemeni authorities after tribal mediators worked out a deal with the government.&lt;ref name=shabab/&gt;

===Phase 3: November 2005 – 2006===
Fighting broke out in November 2005 and continued until early 2006. The pro-government Hamdan tribe, led by Sheikh Abdullah al-Awjari, battled with pro-Houthi tribes and Houthis tried to assassinate a Ministry of Justice official in [[Dhamar, Yemen|Dhamar]] {{Citation needed|reason=missing source|date=December 2017}}. The fighting ended before the Presidential elections that year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pUq4Wo1zSt0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Yemen+on+the+Brink&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TbuMTvHzI6ek0QWS-PjSBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author1=Christopher Boucek |author2=Marina Ottaway |title=Yemen on the Brink|publisher=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace|year=2010|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in March 2006, the Yemeni government freed more than 600 captured Shī'a fighters.&lt;ref&gt;

===Phase 4: January–June 2007===
Fighting broke out on 28 January 2007, when militants attacked a number of government installations, killing six soldiers and injuring 20 more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title='Shia gunmen' kill Yemeni troops| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6307703.stm| publisher=[[BBC News]]| date=2004-01-28| accessdate=2007-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Al-Mahdi"&gt;{{cite news| first=Khaled| last=Al-Mahdi| title=95 Killed in Yemen Clashes| url=http://arabnews.com/?page=4&amp;section=0&amp;article=92163&amp;d=15&amp;m=2&amp;y=2007&amp;pix=world.jpg&amp;category=World| publisher=[[ArabNews]]| date=2007-02-15| accessdate=2007-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February, the government launched a major offensive against the rebels involving 30,000 troops.&lt;ref name="Arrabyee-2007"&gt;{{cite news|first=Nasser |last=Arrabyee |title=Yemen's rebels undefeated |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2007/838/re8.htm |publisher=[[Al-Ahram Weekly]] |date=2007-04-04 |accessdate=2007-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070416192857/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2007/838/re8.htm |archivedate=2007-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 19 February, almost 200 members of the security forces and over 100 rebels had died in the fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=More than 100 killed in 5 days of clashes between army and Shiite rebels clashes in Yemen, officials say| url=http://iht.com/articles/ap/2007/02/19/africa/ME-GEN-Yemen-Rebels.php| work=International Herald Tribune| date=2007-02-19| accessdate=2007-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further 160 rebels were killed in the subsequent two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=160 rebels killed in Yemen| url=http://story.israelherald.com/index.php/ct/9/cid/940f2bfd509e743b/id/232503/cs/1/| work=Israel Herald| date=2007-03-07| accessdate=2007-04-11| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928035910/http://story.israelherald.com/index.php/ct/9/cid/940f2bfd509e743b/id/232503/cs/1/| archivedate=2007-09-28| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A French student was also killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL26448929|title=Two killed in Yemen attack including a Frenchman|date=26 March 2007|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=29 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ceasefire agreement was reached on 16 June 2007. The rebel leaders agreed to lay down arms and go into exile in [[Qatar]] (by whom the agreement had been mediated), while the government agreed to release rebel prisoners, help pay for reconstruction and assist with [[Internally displaced person|IDPs]] returning home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Ahmed| last=Al-Hajj| title=Yemen's government, Shiite rebels negotiate end to 3-year conflict| url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003751155_yemen17.html| work=[[The Seattle Times]]| date=2007-06-17| accessdate=2007-06-17| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620190558/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003751155_yemen17.html| archivedate=2007-06-20| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total some 1,500 people were killed by the conflict in 2007, including 800 government troops, 600 rebels and 100 civilians.&lt;ref name="ploughshares1"/&gt;

In early January 2010, the Houthis chose the Iraqi cleric [[Grand Ayatollah]] [[Ali al-Sistani]] to mediate in their political standoff with the Yemeni government and to find a solution to the conflict. This choice was criticized by Saudi cleric Mohammad al-Arifi, a preacher at Riyadh's central mosque, who dismissed al-Sistani as "an infidel and debauched."

===2010 conflict with pro-government tribes===
In April, Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam declared that rebels had captured the [[Manaba district]] in Sa'dah, with little government resistance. Government troops declared they had killed 30 Houthis who had tried to penetrate into [[Harf Sufyan District]].

On July 17, 2010, the Houthis warned on their website that the government was preparing for another offensive against the Houthis. They said the government had been digging trenches from the Sana'a to Sa'ada. They claimed the army was trying to amass servicemen in villages and that soldiers in Amshia Bsfian region were creating an army stronghold on Mount Guide. The report came as the Yemeni government blamed Houthi fighters for recent ethnic clashes which had killed 11 people, including two soldiers, and for the kidnapping of two people in a market.

On February 27, Abdul Malik al-Houthi announced support for the pro-democracy protests and the effort to effect regime change, as had happened in [[Tunisia]] and [[Egypt]].

Houthi slogans were hung all across the old city of Sana'a and Shi'a majority areas during the protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/03/yemen-houthis-idUSL6E8KU2WU20121003 |agency=Reuters |first=Andrew |last=Hammond |title=FEATURE-Houthi rebels seen gaining new influence in Yemen |date=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to Houthis expanding their control in [[Sana'a Governorate]] and other areas around the capital, particularly [[Khwlan District|Khwlan]] and [[Sanhan District]]s and the town [[Shibam Kawkaban District|Shibam Kawkaban]] in [[Al Mahwit Governorate|al-Mahwit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yemenfox.net/news_details.php?sid=4673|title=Yemen Fox- Houthis seek to take control over Sana'a|author=Yemen Fox|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Juraf district was also named as a Houthi stronghold, where they had large numbers of weapons stationed.

During one of the protests, in [[Raydah District|Raydah]], Amran, clashes broke out between Houthis and Islahi gunmen after the Islahi gunmen interrupted a Houthi mass rally, denouncing Innocence of Muslims and the US government, on September 21. Two people were killed during the clash and three Islahi gunmen were captured.&lt;ref name="fnayemen.com"/&gt; Fighting continued until September 23, leaving 16 fighters dead and 36 Islah men captured by the Houthis. After a cease-fire was agreed on, Houthis withdrew from the town and released the prisoners they had taken.&lt;ref name="2011 casualties"/&gt; A group of Houthis remained in Owaidan mosque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yemenfox.net/news_details.php?sid=4311|title=Yemen Fox- Mediation ends war, drives Houthis out of Raida|author=Yemen Fox|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014–15: Victory for the insurgency===
{{main|Battle of Sana'a (2014)|Houthi takeover in Yemen}}
On 18 August 2014, the Houthis began a series of demonstrations in Sana'a against increased fuel prices. On 21 September, the Houthis [[Battle of Sana'a (2014)|took control]] of Sana'a, after which Prime Minister [[Mohammed Basindawa]] resigned and the Houthis signed a deal for a new unity government with other political parties. The protests were marked by clashes between the Houthis and the government and also clashes between the Houthis and [[al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]].&lt;ref name="BBCGardner"&gt;{{cite news|title=Frank Gardner: Yemen at risk of civil war, says ambassador|author=Frank Gardner|publisher=BBC|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-29749046|accessdate=29 October 2014|date=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 340 people were killed on the outskirts of the Yemeni capital in one week of fighting between the Shiite rebels and Sunni militiamen before the city fell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2014/Sep-22/271549-at-least-200-killed-in-recent-yemen-fighting-ministry.ashx#axzz3E3iuXhsm|title=At least 340 killed in Yemen's week-long fighting|work=The Daily Star Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new government was sworn in on 9 November, although the Houthis and [[General People's Congress (Yemen)|General People's Congress]] announced they would not take part.&lt;ref name="Aljazeera1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Yemen swears in new government amid boycott|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/11/yemen-swear-new-government-2014118223745207779.html|accessdate=14 November 2014|date=9 November 2014|publisher=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crisis intensified as Houthi militants attacked the presidential palace and private residence in January 2015, quickly seizing control of both. On 22 January, President [[Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi]] and his ministers resigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2015-01-22/yemen-rebels-reach-deal-with-hadi-to-pull-back-from-palace-1-.html|title=Yemen President Hadi Resigns After Shiite Rebels Seize Palace|date=22 January 2015|accessdate=22 January 2015|agency=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Houthis declared themselves in full control of the government on 6 February, dissolving parliament and putting a [[Revolutionary Committee (Yemen)|Revolutionary Committee]] led by [[Mohammed Ali al-Houthi]] in charge of the country.&lt;ref name="finalize"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/yemens-shia-rebels-finalize-coup-vow-to-dissolve-parliament/article22829401/|work=The Globe and Mail|title=Yemen's Shia rebels finalize coup, vow to dissolve parliament|date=6 February 2015|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
{{main|Aftermath of the Houthi takeover in Yemen}}
{{see also|2015 military intervention in Yemen {{!}}Operation Decisive Storm}}
Hadi escaped from house arrest on 21 February and made his way to [[Aden]], where he renounced his resignation, condemned the Houthi takeover, and attempted to reassemble his government. He declared Aden to be Yemen's provisional capital.

[[Battle of Aden Airport|Fighting broke out]] over [[Aden International Airport]] on 19 March after Hadi dismissed a general in Aden, [[Abdul-Hafez al-Saqqaf]], whom he suspected of being loyal to [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]], widely believed to be an ally of the Houthis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/03/19/southern-yemen-clashes/25006201/|agency=USA TODAY|title=Clashes force closure of Yemen's Aden airport|first=Jane|last=Onyanga-Omara|date=19 March 2015|accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, [[2015 Sana'a mosque bombings|a quadruple suicide bombing]] ripped through two mosques in [[Sana'a]] while hundreds of Houthis were praying there. The Revolutionary Committee declared a "state of general mobilisation" in response to the events and launched a military offensive directed at Hadi's holdouts, whom the Houthis accused of being in league with [[al-Qaeda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sabanews.net/ar/news391987.htm|language=Arabic|title=اللجنة الثورية تعلن التعبئة العامة وتوجه الأمن والجيش القيام بواجبه للتصدي للإرهابيين|date=21 March 2015|accessdate=21 March 2015|agency=Saba News Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ftqa"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/faa645dc-d0b2-11e4-982a-00144feab7de.html|agency=Financial Times|title=Q&amp;A: Yemen's slide into civil war|date=22 March 2015|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the clashes at the airport and the Houthis' southward offensive, the media has increasingly described the deteriorating situation in Yemen and the escalating clashes between the two factions claiming to represent the legitimate government as a [[Yemeni civil war (2015–present)|civil war]].&lt;ref name="ftqa"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/yemen-crisis-shortage-of-water-and-medical-supplies-threatens-civilians-caught-up-in-devastating-civil-war-10163600.html|agency=The Independent|title=Yemen crisis: Shortage of water and medical supplies threatens civilians caught up in devastating civil war|date=8 April 2015|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Security-Watch/terrorism-security/2015/0407/Warnings-of-humanitarian-crisis-as-Yemen-s-civil-war-rolls-on-video|agency=The Christian Science Monitor|title=Warnings of humanitarian crisis as Yemen's civil war rolls on (+video)|first=Michael|last=Holtz|date=7 April 2015|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/04/06/world/yemenis-forced-take-sea-aden-civil-war-rages-ancient-port/#.VSYN-fnF9ps|first=Sami|last=Aboudi|agency=Japan Times|title=Yemenis forced to take to sea from Aden as civil war rages through ancient port}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several states led by [[Saudi Arabia]] also mounted a [[2015 military intervention in Yemen|military intervention in Yemen]] codenamed "Operation Decisive Storm". The Saudi-led coalition sided with Hadi's government in Aden, shelling Houthi positions from land and sea and hitting them with airstrikes.&lt;ref name="AlJazeeraSaudiAttack"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2015/03/saudi-ambassador-announces-military-operation-yemen-150325234138956.html|title=Saudi and Arab allies bomb Houthi positions in Yemen|newspaper=Al Jazeera|date=25 March 2015|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 December 2017, a direct attack on Riyadh by another ballistic missile was intercepted, allegedly''"Iranian-made"'', launched by''"Iranian-supported rebels"'' and aimed at the Saudi royal palace.&lt;ref&gt;[''Rebels in Yemen Fire Second Ballistic Missile at Saudi Capital'' https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/19/world/middleeast/yemen-rebels-missile-riyadh.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[''Saudi Arabia shoots down Houthi missile aimed at Riyadh palace'' https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/19/saudis-shoot-down-houthi-missile-close-to-capital-riyadh]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[''Yemen rebel ballistic missile intercepted over Riyadh'' https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-42412729]&lt;/ref&gt;
Another special Extraordinary Meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Member States of the OIC on 21 January 2018 in [[Jeddah]] condemned the attack, decrying it as an aggression on 
the KSA, and taking it as ''"evidence of the Iranian-backed Houthi militias' refusal to cooperate with the international community and accept international resolutions"'', referring to the resolution adopted in the Mecca Conference in November 2016 and relevant [[UN Security Council]] resolutions.

==Alleged foreign involvement==

===Iran and Hezbollah===
There have been a number of allegations that [[Iran]] and [[Hezbollah]] have intervened to aid the Houthis, including:
* The Saudi and Yemeni governments both accuse Iran of helping the Houthis. Iran, they say, has secretly landed arms on the Red Sea coast. In October, 2009, Yemen's government said its navy intercepted an arms-carrying Iranian vessel. Yemen's state-controlled press claims Houthi rebels have been trained in an Iranian-run camp across the Red Sea in [[Eritrea]]. Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, says members of Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah militia are teaching them. The Yemeni authorities also darkly note that the Houthis' long-time leader, Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi, who died in battle in 2004, used to visit [[Qom]], one of Shia Islam's holiest places.&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/middleeast-africa/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14920092|title=Yemen's war: Pity those caught in the middle|work=The Economist|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of these accusations have yet been borne out by independent observers and the Iranians deny any involvement.
* Saudi-owned [[Al Arabiya]] claimed that "well-informed sources" are saying that "the president of the former [[Democratic Republic of Yemen|South Yemen]] ([[Ali Salim al-Beidh|Ali Salim al-Bidh]]) conducted a secret visit to the Lebanese capital [[Beirut]] last October (2009), and tried to contact figures close to Hezbollah aiming to win its support for the Houthi rebels, and for South (Yemen's) secession." The sources added that those Hezbollah-allied figures "informed al-Bidh that the party's top officials do not want to meet with him and that they do not approve the attribution of Hezbollah's name with what is happening in Yemen, or to appear as supporting to any rebellion." Ibrahim al-Mussawi, Head of Hezbollah's Media Unit, told Alarabiya.net that his party denies the report about an alleged secret visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naharnet.com/domino/tn/NewsDesk.nsf/Lebanon/6DDAE71654CF04ECC225768600637583?OpenDocument|title=Hizbullah Denies Report about Former South Yemen President Visiting Beirut to Demand Support for Huthis|work=Naharnet|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* High-ranking officials from the [[Iranian Revolutionary Guard]] were said to have secretly met with Houthi rebels and Hezbollah in Yemen to coordinate joint military operations against Saudi positions along the border. Pan-Arab [[Asharq al-Awsat]] daily said Arab and Egyptian sources uncovered that a number of intelligence services in the region have learned of the three-way meeting which also aimed at developing a plan to escalate the military situation along the Saudi-Yemeni border. It said the high-level meeting which took place in November, 2009 was the most prominent evidence of "direct Iranian involvement" in the support of Houthi rebels financially, militarily and logistically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naharnet.com/domino/tn/NewsDesk.nsf/Lebanon/A857AE4FD533574CC225768B00262D5E?OpenDocument|title=Secret Meeting in Yemen between Iran, Huthi, Hizbullah Officials|work=Naharnet|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Yemeni Foreign Minister [[Abu Bakr al-Qirbi]] on 13 December 2009 urged Iran to crack down on Iranian groups he accused of aiding Houthi rebels in northern Yemen and held Iran's government partly to blame. He said: "Religious (Shiite) circles and groups in Iran are providing aid to the Huthis," However, Iran has repeatedly denied such accusations.&lt;ref name=Naharnet-2009-12-13&gt;Yemeni FM: Iran Must Curb Groups Aiding Huthi Rebels{{cite news| url=http://www.naharnet.com/domino/tn/NewsDesk.nsf/MiddleEast/560D6BD248902E2DC225768B005434A3?OpenDocument| title=Yemeni FM: Iran Must Curb Groups Aiding Huthi Rebels| publisher=[[naharnet]]| date=2009-12-13| archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.naharnet.com%2Fdomino%2Ftn%2FNewsDesk.nsf%2FMiddleEast%2F560D6BD248902E2DC225768B005434A3%3FOpenDocument+&amp;date=2010-01-23| archivedate=2010-01-23| deadurl=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Sudan, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates.===
Saudi Arabia has led a major military intervention in Yemen, and organized a coalition of other nations to support its efforts, including Egypt, Jordan, Sudan, and Bahrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2015/05/the-saudi-arabia-yemen-war-of-2015/392687/| title=The Saudi Arabia-Yemen War of 2015 | magazine = [[The Atlantic]] | date=2015-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In December 2009, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the United States has provided weapons and logistical support to Yemeni government strikes against suspected hide-outs of Al Qaeda within its borders. The officials said that the American support was approved by President Obama and came at the request of the Yemeni government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/19/world/middleeast/19yemen.html|title=U.S. Aids Yemeni Raids on Al Qaeda, Officials Say|last=Shanker|first=Thom|author2=Landler, Mark |date=18 December 2009 |work=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Houthi leaders however claim that US involvement started on 14 December when the US launched 28 air raids.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; At least 120 people were killed and 44 injured by the alleged US air raids on the regions of Amran, Hajjah and Sa'ada in North Yemen, a Houthi leader was quoted as saying: "The US air force perpetrated an appalling massacre against citizens in the north of Yemen as it launched air raids on various populated areas, markets, refugee camps and villages along with Saudi warplanes, The savage crime committed by the US air force shows the real face of the United States.

[[UNICEF]] and [[Islamic Relief]] were reported as condemning Houthi rebels for abusing children by forcing them to fight for their cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/worldwide/middle-east/un-calls-for-the-prosecution-of-child-soldier-recruiters|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130114172550/http://www.thenational.ae/news/worldwide/middle-east/un-calls-for-the-prosecution-of-child-soldier-recruiters|dead-url=yes|archive-date=14 January 2013|title=UN calls for the prosecution of child soldier recruiters|work=The National|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/Special/2009/11/23/Issue-of-child-soldiers-raised-in-Yemen/UPI-70641258992863/|title=Issue of child soldiers raised in Yemen|work=UPI|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article6868811.ece|title=Yemen child soldier tells of his hatred for al-Houthi rebels|work=The Times|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2009, over 400 children walked to the [[UNDP]] office in Sana'a, to protest against the alleged Houthi abuse of children's rights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110405190852/http://www.yobserver.com/local-news/10017635.html Yemen children renews protest al-Houthi-related child abuse.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Allegations were made that both the Yemeni government and the Houthi rebels exploited the use of child soldiers during the war. Human Rights Watch noted difficulty in citing the exact numbers of child soldiers on the Houthis' part. However, there existed a significant amount of evidence that the government itself employed child soldiers in the ranks of the armed forces, the result of the country's lack of [[birth certificates]] and further documentation of age.&lt;ref name="All Quiet On The Northern Front"&gt;{{cite news|title=All Quiet On The Northern Front? |url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWFiles2010.nsf/FilesByRWDocUnidFilename/SMAR-84A9WN-full_report.pdf/$File/full_report.pdf |date=March 2010 |accessdate=2010-09-24 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100214/FOREIGN/702139832/1315 |title=UN calls for the prosecution of child soldier recruiters |publisher=The National |date=2010-02-13 |accessdate=2010-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119072633/http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20100214%2FFOREIGN%2F702139832%2F1315 |archivedate=2016-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Where the Yemeni government was limited by restrictions, [[The Times]] reported on a fourteen-year-old boy who fought for a tribal militia sponsored by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article6868811.ece  |title=Yemen child soldier tells of his hatred for al-Houthi rebels |publisher=The Times |date=2009-10-10 |accessdate=2010-09-24 | location=London | first=Judith | last=Evans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Sana'a-based human rights group, Seyaj Organization for Childhood Protection, noted that the Houthis were mainly responsible, stating that fifty-percent of the rebels were under the age of eighteen. It is estimated that anywhere between 400 and 500 children are killed every year in Yemen as the result of tribal conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/Special/2010/01/06/Yemens-child-soldiers-go-to-war/UPI-89571262808410/ |title=Yemen's child soldiers go to war |publisher=UPI |date=2010-01-06 |accessdate=2010-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same organization eventually released a report claiming that 700 children were used as soldiers by the Houthis and pro-government militias during the war. The report concluded that 187 children were killed during the conflict, 71% as the result of the fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100225/FOREIGN/702249829/1002 |title=Both sides in war blamed for Yemen's dead children |publisher=The National |date=2010-02-24 |accessdate=2010-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301102501/http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20100225%2FFOREIGN%2F702249829%2F1002 |archivedate=2010-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These allegations were supported by the story of "Akram," a nine-year-old boy who was duped by a cousin to deliver a bomb to an unspecified target in the Old City of Saada. Akram, unknowingly wired with an explosive, was apprehended by police and taken to safety in Sana'a, along with his father. A day after telling his story at a press conference Akram's home was bombed in Saada City. His younger brother suffered injuries in the retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/world-news/the-children-of-yemen-s-tribal-war-1.990167  |title=The children of Yemen's tribal war |publisher=The Sunday Herald |date=2009-12-05 |accessdate=2010-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marxism–Leninism–Maoism''' ('''M–L–M''' or '''MLM''', formerly known as '''Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought''') is a [[political philosophy]] that builds upon [[Marxism–Leninism]] and some aspects of [[Maoism|Mao Zedong Thought]] which was first formalised in 1993 by the [[Revolutionary Internationalist Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Long Live Marxism-Leninism-Maoism!|url=http://www.aworldtowin.org/back_issues/1995-20/ll_mlm_20_eng.htm|publisher=Revolutionary Internationalist Movement|accessdate=15 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140411203548/http://www.aworldtowin.org/back_issues/1995-20/ll_mlm_20_eng.htm|archivedate=April 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
{{Marxism–Leninism sidebar}}
Maoism was considered synonymous with Mao Zedong Thought (also known as Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought) from the 1960s onwards—when many [[anti-revisionist]] [[Marxist]] organisations sided with China following the [[Sino-Soviet split]]—until 1993, when the [[Revolutionary Internationalist Movement]] (RIM) formalised Marxism–Leninism–Maoism as a new and higher stage of Marxism–Leninism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moufawad-Paul|first1=Joshua|title=Onwards Maoist Century!|url=http://moufawad-paul.blogspot.ca/2012/05/onwards-maoist-century.html?view=classic|accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite web|title=Maoism today|url=http://www.pcr-rcp.ca/old/en/pwd/2f.php|website=PCR-RCP|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite web|title=International Situation of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism|url=http://mlmprincipallymaoism.wordpress.com/2013/01/14/international-situation-of-marxism-leninism-maoism/|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite web|title=Maoism or Trotskyism|url=http://www.systemiccapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Maoism-or-Trotskyism.pdf|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused a split in the Maoist movement, with the adherents of Mao Zedong Thought leaving the RIM and congregating around the [[International Conference of Marxist–Leninist Parties and Organizations (International Newsletter)|International Conference of Marxist–Leninist Parties and Organizations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cailmail|first1=Benoît|title=A History of Nepalese Maoism since its Foundation by Mohan Bikram Singh|url=http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/ebhr/pdf/EBHR_33%2634_02.pdf|publisher=European Bulletin of Himalayan Research|accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Components ==
=== Mass line ===
{{Maoism sidebar}}
Building on the theory of the [[vanguard party]] by [[Vladimir Lenin]], the theory of the [[mass line]] outlines a strategy for the mass popularisation of revolutionary ideology, consolidation of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] and strengthening of the party and for the building of [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]]. The mass line can be summarised by the phrase "from the masses, to the masses". It has three components (or stages) as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Short Definitions of the 'Mass Line' and a 'Mass Perspective'|url=http://massline.info/sum1p.htm|website=massline.info|accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Gathering the diverse ideas of the masses.
# Processing or concentrating these ideas from the perspective of revolutionary Marxism, in light of the long-term, ultimate interests of the masses (which the masses themselves may sometimes only dimly perceive) and in light of a scientific analysis of the objective situation.
# Returning these concentrated ideas to the masses in the form of a political line which will actually advance the mass struggle toward [[revolution]].

These three steps should be applied over and over again, reiteratively uplifting practice and knowledge to higher and higher stages.

=== People's war ===
[[People's war]], a strategy for guerilla warfare, holds the following:
* Any attempt to fight with the [[bourgeoisie]] on its own terms, using the same tactics and strategies as they do, will be crushed (Maoists cite that apart from the [[October Revolution]], every single revolutionary attempt that used [[conventional warfare]] was crushed by the bourgeoisie).
* It cannot be predicted when the objective conditions for revolution will exist. Thus the subjective conditions—i.e. [[class consciousness]]—must be built long in advance.
* Seizure of state power generally does not happen in one fell swoop. A situation of [[dual power]] through the course of protracted people's war arises when the proletarian vanguard controls sections of the country at the same time as the bourgeoisie.
* The party cannot possibly hope to lead the proletariat in a seizure of power if it itself has no military experience. Thus military experience—i.e. experienced gained through actually fighting, even if on a limited scale—must be gained long in advance of a seizure of power. In addition to being a necessary development towards the dictatorship of the proletariat, dual power is invaluable in providing this military experience (along with civil knowledge, fuel for propaganda efforts, material aid for the party and the expansion and improvement of the mass line).

In a joint document released in 1998, several communist parties affirmed the difference between the specific strategic line of protracted people's war and the more general (and universally applicable) people's war. Protracted people's war is identified as being a specific application of the concept of people's war to countries with a large population (or majority) of peasantry and involving encircling the cities from base areas of communist control in the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Declaration on Mao and People's War|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/new-zealand/rf-feb-99.pdf|publisher=Red Flag|accessdate=December 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Protracted people's war is the only way to make revolution"&gt;{{cite web|title=Protracted people’s war is the only way to make revolution|url=http://www.pcr-rcp.ca/old/en/pwd/1e.php|publisher=Socialisme Maintenant!|accessdate=December 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of applying people's war to fully industrialized first world nations is the subject of much debate. Many organizations, such as the RIM and the [[Revolutionary Communist Party of Canada]] in Canada, have put forward that much of a hypothetical people's war in the first world would take place in urban areas.&lt;ref name="Protracted people's war is the only way to make revolution"/&gt;

=== New Democracy ===
The theory of [[New Democracy]] holds that the national-bourgeois in semi-feudal and semi-colonial countries has a dual character in that although it is an exploitative capitalist force, it can also (though not always) side with the proletariat against colonialism, imperialism and the [[comprador]]-bourgeoisie (whose existence is due to imperialism).

The role of the national-bourgeoisie as a progressive asset in the proletarian struggle to overthrow imperialism is of course never guaranteed and will eventually turn on the proletariat when the anti-imperialist situation progresses. The [[Balli Kombëtar]] in Albania in 1943 and the [[Kuomintang]] in China in the 1920s are examples of this. These national bourgeois forces temporarily allied with the proletariat of their countries (the [[Party of Labour of Albania]] and the [[Communist Party of China]], respectively) for the overthrow of imperialism but eventually turned on the proletariat once they felt their long-term existence in the new society would be threatened.

Much like the [[New Economic Policy]] in Russia, New Democracy is conceived of as a necessary (but temporary) evil for the long-term development of socialism, or in this case for the construction and consolidation of socialism in the first place. Maoism holds that the national-bourgeois in the New Democratic stage must always be firmly under the command of the proletariat and they must be firmly dispensed with as soon as the national situation allows (in other words, when the contradiction between the comprador class and the people is no longer the primary contradiction of the nation, or when the bourgeois-democratic revolution is at a sufficiently advanced stage) for an outright dictatorship of the proletariat.

=== Cultural Revolution ===
Maoists draw heavily from the experiences and lessons of the [[Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution]] which sought to eradicate the bourgeois that arose within the vanguard party itself and to transform all aspects of the social superstructure. The catchphrase "class struggle continues, and is intensified, under socialism" is frequently used.

Maoists hold the primacy of the relations of production over the productive forces, criticise [[Joseph Stalin]]'s line that bourgeois influence under an advanced stage of socialism is primarily due to external forces (to the almost complete exclusion of internal forces) and strongly reaffirm the [[Base and superstructure|base-superstructure]] [[Dialectics|dialectic]] (that the conscious transformation of the base on its own is not enough, but the superstructure must also be consciously transformed).

=== Country classification ===
Maoists state that there are two kinds of countries: [[Imperialism|imperialist]]-[[Capitalism|capitalist]] ones on one side and oppressed [[Semi-colony|semi-colonial]] semi-feudal countries on the other side.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-2/mswv2_23.htm "Mao Zedong: The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bannedthought.net/International/RIM/Docs/RIM-Declaration-1984-A.pdf "Declaration of the Revolutionary Internationalist Movement"].&lt;/ref&gt; In the oppressed countries there is a bureaucratic capitalist bourgeoisie, [[Dependency theory|submitted to imperialism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lesmaterialistes.com/english/cpmlm-declaration-59-capitalist-or-semi-feudal-semi-colonial-countries-trotskyism-or "Capitalist or semi-feudal semi-colonial countries?"].&lt;/ref&gt; According to this concept, in some oppressed countries the ruling class tries to be expansionist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lesmaterialistes.com/english/relationship-between-semi-colonialism-and-semi-feudalism-cpmlm-bangladesh-cpmlm-france "The relationship between semi-colonialism and semi-feudalism"].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philosophy ===
{{main|Antagonistic contradiction|One Divides Into Two}}
Maoists uphold [[Mao Zedong]]'s philosophical works, particularly his work on [[Dialectical materialism|dialectics]] in ''[[On Contradiction]]'' and on [[epistemology]] in ''[[On Practice]]''.

== Differences from Mao Zedong Thought ==
The three most notable differences between Marxism–Leninism–Maoism and Mao Zedong Thought are the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Nikolai|title=What is Maoism?|url=http://anti-imperialism.com/2011/08/05/what-is-maoism/|website=anti-imperialism.com|publisher=RAIM|accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marxism-Leninism-Maoism Basic Course|url=http://massalijn.nl/theory/marxism-leninism-maoism-basic-course/|website=Massalijn|publisher=Communist Party of India (Maoist)|accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The five main contributions of Maoism to communist thought|url=http://www.nuovopci.it/arcspip/article7019.html|website=nuovopci.it|accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Marxism–Leninism–Maoism is considered to be a higher stage of Marxism–Leninism, much like Marxism–Leninism is considered a higher stage of [[Marxism]]. However, Mao Zedong Thought is considered to just be Marxism–Leninism applied to the particularities of the Chinese revolution.
# Marxism–Leninism–Maoism is considered to be universally applicable whilst the aspects of Mao Zedong Thought are generally not.
# Marxism–Leninism–Maoism completely rejects the [[Three Worlds Theory]] of Mao Zedong Thought, considering it part of the right-wards turn Mao took near the end of his life and a deviation from Marxist–Leninist theories of imperialism.

== Marxism–Leninism–Maoism internationally ==
=== Internationals ===
Perhaps the most notable Marxist–Leninist–Maoist international was the [[Revolutionary Internationalist Movement]] (RIM). RIM was founded in 1984 and included such organizations as the [[Shining Path|Communist Party of Peru]] (PCP), also known as "Sendero Luminoso" or "Shining Path"; and the then Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), now known as the [[Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]] UCPN(M). Today, the RIM appears to be defunct or near defunct. The magazine associated with the RIM, ''A World to Win'', has not published an issue since 2006, though A World to Win News Service still publishes regularly on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aworldtowin.org/wordpress/|title=A World to Win News Service|date=3 April 2006|website=Aworldtowin.org|accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many of the one-time RIM organizations have become increasingly critical of each other and this has resulted in many public splits.

=== India ===
{{see also|Communist Party of India (Maoist)}}
The [[Communist Party of India (Maoist)]] is a [[political party]] which aims to overthrow the government of [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Maoists looking at armed overthrow of state by 2050|newspaper=The Times of India|date=6 March 2010|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-03-06/india/28119932_1_maoists-indian-state-forest-land|accessdate=6 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded on 21 September 2004 through the merger of the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) People's War]] and the [[Maoist Communist Centre|Maoist Communist Centre of India]] (MCC). The merger was announced to the public on 14 October the same year. In the merger a provisional central committee was constituted, with the erstwhile People's War leader [[Muppala Lakshmana Rao]] (alias Ganapathi) as General Secretary. It is currently proscribed as a [[terrorist]] organization by the Indian government.

=== Kangleipak (Manipur) ===
It is claimed by the [[Kangleipak Communist Party]] (Ibungo Ngangom) that [[Manipur (princely state)|Kangleipak (Manipur)]] was annexed by the [[Dominion of India|Union of India]] under the guise of Manipur Merger Agreement of 1949. According to this group, which follows a fusion of Marxism and Maoism as its main ideological line, the merger of Manipur with the Union of India was in blatant contradiction of relevant international law as the then king of Manipur no longer had the authority to sign the agreement following the establishment of a democratically elected government. "Moreover, the then king signed the merger instrument only under duress, or more precisely, at gunpoint and so the so-called Manipur merger agreement was null and void from the very beginning", claims Ibungo Ngangom, the group's chairman. The group is currently at war with the Union of India and its express primary goal is not only to liberate Kangleipak (Manipur) from the semi-colonial yoke of India, but also to bring about a communist state in Kangleipak through the [[scientific socialism]] of [[Karl Marx]].

=== Peru ===
The [[Shining Path|Communist Party of Peru – Shining Path]] is a [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] [[insurgent]] organization in [[Peru]]. It was founded in 1980 with [[Abimael Guzmán]] as its leader. The Shining Path is currently waging a [[Internal conflict in Peru|war against the Peruvian government]].

=== Nepal ===
The [[Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]], a national communist party with a revolutionary background, is a follower of Marxism–Leninism–Maoism, although it is believed that the party has developed its own ideology, [[Marxism–Leninism–Maoism–Prachanda Path]], which was developed taking Nepal's political, sociological and geographical constraints into consideration. 

The Communist Party of Nepal is another Marxist–Leninist–Maoist party in Nepal. It claims that the UCPN(M) is a revisionist organization and is continuing the People's War against the UCPN(M) government.

=== Philippines===
In the [[Philippines]], the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] (CPP) and its [[New People's Army]] (NPA) has been waging a revolutionary war since 1968. Its strength peaked during the dictatorial rule of [[Ferdinand Marcos]] and was the main bulk of the opposition against the dictatorship. However, due to controversies regarding massive purges of its members in the mid-1980s and political miscalculations it suffered several splits within its ranks in 1992 and 1997 forming several separate communist parties. It maintains active guerrilla fronts throughout the Philippines until today and is still considered by the military as the main threat to national security. According to the military, the CPP also allegedly has been leading and influencing legal left-wing political organizations and engages in elections.

The Marxist–Leninist Party of the Philippines (MLPP), formed by former [[Central Luzon]] Regional Committee members of the CPP after the split in 1997 maintained much of the Maoist orientation from the CPP most especially on the concept of people's war. However, it has put equal emphasis on legal political struggles along with armed revolution and it sees the proletariat as the leader of the Philippine revolution in union with the peasantry. The Rebolusyonaryong Hukbo ng Bayan (People's Revolutionary Army, RHB) is the armed wing of the MLPP and according to military intelligence sources is the most active and fastest growing insurgent force in the Philippines recently next to the CPP. Like its estranged political sibling the MLPP is said to be organizing legal organizations but does not engage in electoral processes.

=== United States ===
The [[Black Panther Party]] was a proto-Marxist–Leninist–Maoist political party in the United States, requiring all official members to read Mao's ''[[Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung|Little Red Book]]''.

The [[Revolutionary Communist Party, USA|Revolutionary Communist Party]] was previously a Marxist–Leninist–Maoist political party in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://revcom.us/a/ideology/mlm.htm Our Ideology is Marxism-Leninism-Maoism by Bob Avakian] revcom.us&lt;/ref&gt; The RCP participated in the founding conference of the Revolutionary Internationalist Movement on 12 March 1984. The RCP signed the "Declaration of the Revolutionary Internationalist Movement"&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/download/DeclarationOfTheRevolutionaryInternationalistMovement_292/DeclarationOfTheRevolutionaryInternationalistMovement_292.pdf "Declaration of the Revolutionary Internationalist Movement"].&lt;/ref&gt; and supported the RIM's declaration "Long Live Marxism–Leninism–Maoism!" on 26 December 1993 which recognized "Marxism–Leninism–Maoism as the new, third and higher stage of Marxism". However, today the RCP uses the term "New Synthesis" to describe its ideology and has moved away from Marxism–Leninism–Maoism, although they still call themselves Maoists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://revcom.us/a/129/New_Synthesis_Speech-en.html "What is Bob Avakian's New Synthesis?"].&lt;/ref&gt;

The RCP is considered to be a [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] organization by several Maoist groups, such as the [[Communist Party of India (Maoist)]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bannedthought.net/India/CPI-ML-Naxalbari/Naxalbari-Magazine/Naxalbari-04.pdf "Against Avakianism"].&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Revolutionary Communist Party of Canada]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcr-rcp.ca/en/archives/1849 "Proletarians of all countries, unite! 
Long live the 50th anniversary of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! Long live the Proletarian World Revolution! Long live Maoism!"].&lt;/ref&gt; and several smaller Maoist formations in the United States.

The '''Menus-Plaisirs du Roi''' ({{IPA-fr|məny pleziʁ dy ʁwa}}) was, in the organisation of the [[France|French]] royal household under the [[Ancien Régime]], the department of the [[Maison du Roi]] responsible for the "lesser pleasures of the King", which meant in practice that it was in charge of all the preparations for ceremonies, events and festivities, down to the last detail of design and order.

==The controller of the Menus-Plaisirs==
At the king's ''[[Levée (ceremony)#Louis XIV's lever|lever]]'', the ''premier gentilhomme de la chambre'' (First [[Gentleman of the Bedchamber]]), controller of the Menus-Plaisirs, was invariably in attendance, to hear directly from the king what plans were to be set in motion; by long-standing convention, he was a duke; though he was not a professional, it was up to him to determine the appropriate designs. The duke in charge of the Menus et Plaisirs du Roy was an important court official, quite separate from the Surintendant des [[Bâtiments du Roi]], who was an architect or aristocrat in charge of all building operations undertaken by the Crown. The dukes in charge might leave the design process entirely to the professional ''intendant'' in charge, whose right-hand man was the ''dessinateur du cabinet et de la chambre du Roy''; so did two dukes with military careers, [[Louis François Armand du Plessis, duc de Richelieu|Louis-François-Armand du Plessis, duc de Richelieu]] (1696-1788), appointed ''premier gentilhomme'' in 1744&lt;ref&gt;Eriksen 1974&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Emmanuel-Félicité, duc de Durfort-Duras]] (1715–89), made ''premier gentilhomme'' (and ''[[pair de France]]'') in 1757.&lt;ref&gt;Eriksen 1974 notes that though the catafalque for the king and queen of Spain, at the funeral in  Notre-Dame, 15 January 1760, marked the first appearance in court circles of neoclassical design, it is not clear whether the duc de Durfort de Duras played any role in its design.&lt;/ref&gt; But [[Louis-Marie-Augustin, duc d'Aumont]] (1709–82), appointed ''premier gentilhomme de la chambre'' in 1723, a position he held until the king's death in 1774, was a noted connoisseur of objets d'art and the arts of life, though not, apparently, of paintings.&lt;ref&gt;At the sale of his collection after his death, in 1782, purchases were made on behalf of Marie-Antoinette.&lt;/ref&gt; The duc d'Aumont appointed the renowned gilt-bronze maker [[Pierre Gouthière]] ''doreur ordinaire'' of the Menus-Plaisirs in 1767 and appointed the architect Bellanger to the Menus-Plaisirs in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Eriksen 1974:148-49&lt;/ref&gt; For most of the reign of Louis XVI, the ''intendant'' of the Menus-Plaisirs du Roi was [[Papillon de la Ferté]], whose journal (published in 1887) throws a great deal of light on the organization of court ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Alain-Charles Gruber, ''Les Grandes Fêtes et leurs Décors à l'Époque de Louis XVI'' (Geneva: Droz) 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
Many designers were required at the Menus-Plaisirs. From the sixteenth century on, a main responsibility of court architects in Europe was the occasional design of lavish ephemeral settings for processional entries, for [[masque]]s and [[ballet]]s, for the structures that supported fireworks and illuminations on nights of grand fêtes for dynastic marriages and births, or to design the [[catafalque]] for a state funeral. Architects like [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]], [[Giulio Romano]] and [[Inigo Jones]] were engaged in projects that were of great moment in expressing the prestige of the court, but which have left little behind, except designs and some commemorative engravings, produced under the supervision of the Cabinet du Roi.&lt;ref&gt;In addition, extensive descriptions were published after each notable event in the ''Mercure de France''.&lt;/ref&gt; The architect [[Charles-Nicolas Cochin]] worked for several years for the Menus-Plaisirs du Roi, 1735–51, making detailed renderings for the engravers of architectural designs by the [[Slodtz|Slodtz brothers]].&lt;ref&gt;Carter E. Foster, "Charles-Nicolas Cochin and Festival Design for the Menus-Plaisirs" ''Master Drawings'' '''39'''.3 (Autumn 2001), pp. 260-278; p. 276 note 3 gives a bibliography concerning Cochin's work for the Menus-Plaisirs.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[François-Joseph Bélanger]] began his career in 1767 working at the Menus-Plaisirs, both designing ephemeral decorations for court entertainments.  

In the later reign of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the architect in charge of the Bâtiments was [[Jules Hardouin-Mansart]], but the wholly independent artistic force at the menus-plaisirs until his death in 1711 was [[Jean Bérain the Elder|Jean Bérain]], whose brevet in 1674 covered his responsibilities  "for all sorts of designs, perspectives, figures and costumes that it would be required to make for plays, ballets, chases at the ring, [[carousel]]s..."&lt;ref&gt;"''pour toutes sortes de desseins, perspectives, Figures et habits qu'il conviendrait Faire pour les Comedies, Balets&lt;!--Balets in original--&gt; Courses de bagues et Carousels..."'' (Fiske Kimball, ''The Creation of the Rococo'' [Philadelphia] 1943, p. 40.)&lt;/ref&gt; The purview of the Menus-Plaisirs did not normally extend to furniture, but among its expenses in 1692 were "the Furniture and the silversmiths' work for the apartments of the King"&lt;ref&gt;"les Meubles et l'argenterie pour les appartements du Roi" (Kimball 1943:40).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personnel==
Within the Menus-Plaisirs, a hierarchical structure prevailed, with an ''Intendant''&lt;ref&gt;Until 1762 there was also a ''Contrôleur''; the post of ''Intendant'' (held by Papillon de la Ferté at the time) was exchanged for a ''Commissaire'' in 1780. (Boysse 1887:5&lt;/ref&gt; supervising the whole and a ''Dessinateur de la Chambre et du Cabinet du Roi'' in charge of the orderly production of designs. The ''Cabinet du Roi''—in the seventeenth-century sense of ''cabinet'' as collection of works of art and curiosities—was organized by [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]], who gave formal structure to all the official arts under Louis XIV. The ''Cabinet du Roi'' provided the commemorative engravings, which are often our only record, and sold them.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Cabinet du Roi'' as a publishing venture was examined by C. Ferraton, "Les fêtes de Louis XIV et le cabinet de planches gravées fondé par Colbert" ''Bulletin des Musées de France'' '''12.5''' (September–October 1947), pp 26-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The functions of design and commemoration overlapped, needless to say.  The position was extremely influential: both [[Jean Bérain the Elder|Jean Bérain]] and [[Jean Bérain the Younger|his son]], and later [[Juste-Aurèle Meissonnier]], the genius of the extreme [[rococo]], followed by the [[Slodtz]] brothers, one after another, 1750-64. The appointment of  the neo-classical architect-designer [[Michel-Ange Challe]] in 1764 marked a turning point: through his designs for the Menus-Plaisirs, [[neoclassicism]] was introduced at the French court.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expenses==
In addition to these extraordinary expenses, which interest the historian of taste, the journal of the last ''Intendant'' of the Menus-Plaisirs, [[Denis-Pierre-Jean Papillon de la Ferté]] (1727-1794) describes as well the ordinary expenses, for the Menus-Plaisirs dispensed the salaries of the ''Premiers Gentilshommes de la Chambre'', the ''Grand Maître de la Garde-Robe'', the king's doctor, the ''médecin de la Chambre'', the personnel of the Menus-Plaisirs and the king's musicians. Ordinary expenses entailed the constant renewal of the King's wardrobe and that of the Dauphin, religious ceremonies of all kinds, the king's carriages, small royal gifts like snuffboxes, tents and pavilions for outdoor events.

==Limits==
The Menus-Plaisirs were not in charge of the essential furniture of the royal palaces, which were the province of the [[Garde-Meuble de la Couronne]]. An exception is instructive: the design of the jewel cabinet made as a wedding present for the wedding of the Dauphin Louis to [[Marie-Antoinette]] was considered part of the design of the festivities as a whole; thus in the Menus-Plaisirs, the design was entrusted by the duc d'Aumont to [[Belanger]] in 1769, well in advance of the wedding. It was delivered on 1 May 1770.&lt;ref&gt;Eriksen 1974:plate 448.&lt;/ref&gt;

The music required for these entertainments was also a concern of the Menus-Plaisirs du Roi. Beginning in 1762 the music section was established on a large site extending north from the rue Bergère and west of the rue du Faubourg Poissonnière. The facilities included what had previously been the theatre of the [[Opéra-Comique]] at the [[Saint-Laurent Fair]].&lt;ref&gt;Wild 1989, p. 258; Gourret 1985, pp. 81–84&lt;/ref&gt; The site was soon expanded until it reached the rue Richer on the north.

In 1784 [[Denis-Pierre-Jean Papillon de la Ferté|Papillon de la Ferté]] organized the École Royale de Musique, which was housed in buildings on this site on the rue Bergère, and in 1793 the Institut National de Musique, responsible for training instrumentalists of the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]] [[Marching band|bands]], was also located here. The two institutions were merged into the [[Conservatoire de Musique]] in August 1795. A new [[Salle des Concerts du Conservatoire|Conservatory Concert Hall]] was added in 1811. Under the [[French Second Empire]] a different theatre with the name [[Théâtre des Menus-Plaisirs]] was constructed at 14 Boulevard de Strasbourg in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Wild 1989, pp. 258–262.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anne Bongrain and Yves Gérard, ''Le Conservatoire de Paris, des Menus-Plaisirs à la Cité de la musique, 1795-1995'' (Paris:Buchet-Chastel) 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hôtel des Menus-Plaisirs du Roi in Versailles==
[[File:Estatesgeneral.jpg|thumb|left|The meeting of the Estates General, in the Salle des États, 5 May 1789]]

Under Louis XV a structure was erected in the town of [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] to house the multiple activities of the Menus-Plaisirs. It still stands, at 22, avenue de Paris, now rendered famous as the site of the [[Estates-General of 1789]], at which the opening moves of the [[French Revolution]] were played out. A provisionally fitted-out space was arranged in the building to seat the Assembly of Notables in 1787, and again in 1788. Then, to accommodate the press of representatives of the three estates, in the Estate-General, a grander but still temporary Salle des États designed by [[Pierre-Adrien Pâris]] was set up in one of the two courtyards of the Hôtel des Menus-Plaisirs. The old Hôtel des Menus-Plaisirs is now the home of the [[Centre de Musique Baroque de Versailles]].

==Menus-Plaisirs at the court of Russia==
In Moscow, near the Kremlin's walls, between the  Komendantskaïa Tower and the  Troïtskaïa Tower, stands the '''Palais des Menus Plaisirs''' (Потёшный Дворец or  Потёшный Двор), built in 1652 for the father-in-law of [[Tsar Alexis]],  the boyar [[Ilya Miloslavsky]], who lived in it for sixteen years. After his death, the structure was enlarged and converted into a site for spectacles and concerts, taking its new name, and served to house members of the imperial family: here the future [[Peter the Great]] received his elementary education.&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Palais des Menus Plaisirs|(French Wikipedia)"Palais des Menus Plaisirs"]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early history===
Mosaica was co-founded in 1997 by Dr. Dawn Eidelman and Gene Eidelman. The Eidelmans had previously founded Prodigy Child Development Centers and Prodigy Consulting, an organization that operated child development and care centers in the Atlanta, Georgia area and for corporations across the United States including [[General Motors]], [[IBM]] and [[Xerox]].&lt;ref name=mcall&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.mcall.com/2000-03-12/news/3289084_1_mosaica-education-school-boards-public-schools|title=Charter Schools Fight To Exist, But Do They Work?|publisher=The Morning Call|accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CEO Interview CHILDREN'S DISCOVERY CENTERS OF AMERICA INC.

===2000s===
In 2001, Mosaica acquired Advantage Schools, a [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]]-based education management organization.&lt;ref name=bizjournals/&gt; The Qatari government contracted Mosaica to convert schools in Qatar to an American-style educational curriculum in 2003.&lt;ref name=incmagazine&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inc.com/magazine/20060701/handson-global.html|title=A Whole New World|publisher=Inc.|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contract was renewed in 2006.&lt;ref name=incmagazine/&gt; By 2005, Mosaica was the fastest growing urban business in the country, according to ''Inc.

In 2006, Mosaica Education was selected by the government of Abu Dhabi as one of four private education firms to consult on 30 government schools in the Abu Dhabi Education Council (ADEC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.gulfnews.com/private-educational-firms-to-manage-30-public-schools-1.233325|title=Private educational firms to manage 30 public schools|author=Mohammad Shamseddine|date=April 17, 2006|publisher=GulfNews|accessdate=August 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Public-Private Partnership (PPP) program was considered successful in 2010 when ADEC reported that "there has been a considerable rise in student and teacher attendance and grades specifically in English, Math, and Arabic language skills."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ameinfo.com/blog/company-news/a/adec/adec-meets-with-ppp-to-assess-progress-in-abu-dhabi-schools/|title=ADEC meets with PPP to assess progress in Abu Dhabi schools|date=March 8, 2010|publisher=AME|accessdate=August 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Mosaica was paid $773,000 for the first year of a five-year management contract for the management of Lafayette Academy Charter School in [[New Orleans|New Orleans, Louisiana]].&lt;ref name=nola&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.nola.com/times-picayune/2007/09/charter_school_wins_lawsuit_ag.html|title=Charter school wins lawsuit against management company|author=Darran Simon|publisher=''The Times-Picayune''|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was fired in 2007 by the school's governing board, which alleged that Mosaica failed to align its curriculum to Louisiana state standards, provide after-school programs for students that were below grade level, and organize transportation to and from the school.&lt;ref name=nola/&gt; The dispute between Mosaica and Lafayette Academy went into arbitration.&lt;ref name=nola/&gt; In September 2007, the arbitrator ruled Lafayette Academy would pay Mosaica $100,000 for early termination of the contract and Mosaica would return $350,000 in fees to the school.&lt;ref name=nola/&gt;

In 2009, Mosaica fired one school administrator and two teachers at Howard Road Academy, a charter school managed by the organization.&lt;ref name=washingtonpost&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/class-struggle/2009/08/cheating_on_dc-cas_costs_chart.html|title=Cheating on DC-CAS Costs Charter School|author=Jay Mathews|authorlink=Jay Mathews|publisher=''The Washington Post''|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The administrator had leaked a copy of the DC-CAS standardized test to two teachers, who then distributed copies of the test to their students prior to the exam day.&lt;ref name=washingtonpost/&gt;

In 2010, the MAPSA (Michigan Association of Public School Academies) recognized Bingham Arts with the Charter School of Excellence Award for the state of Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mosaicaeducation.com/2010/11/04/mpsa-recognizes-bingham-arts-charter-school-of-excellence-award/|title=MAPSA Recognizes Bingham Arts with the Charter School of Excellence Award|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.charterschools.org/school-services/2013-conference/2009-awards | title =

In April 2012, the ''Winston-Salem Journal'' reported that the STEAM Academy of [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]] had faced declining revenue and poor academic performance for multiple years.&lt;ref name=winston&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journalnow.com/news/local/article_5439f5c7-e494-51d3-aa0e-426fee0d97dd.html|title=Downtown charter school fighting for survival|author=Travis Fain|publisher=''Winston-Salem Journal''|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mosaica took over management of the charter school in late 2011.&lt;ref name=winston/&gt; The STEAM Academy's board of directors hired Susan Willis to serve as the school's principal in December of that year.&lt;ref name=winston/&gt; Willis had been fired in 2009 from Fleming High School in [[Roanoke, Virginia]] for allegedly manipulating student schedules to influence the school's standardized testing scores.&lt;ref name=winston/&gt; Mosaica was aware of Willis' firing but felt that Willis was "cleared of any wrongdoing" after the company spoke to a former Roanoke school superintendent and consulted a dissenting opinion from the Virginia state investigation into Willis' conduct.&lt;ref name=winston/&gt;

Also in 2012, Mosaica was contracted to manage a charter district in Muskegon Heights, Michigan by Donald Weatherspoon, the emergency manager of the failing district.&lt;ref name=educationweek&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2013/05/01/30charters_ep.h32.html|title=For-Profit Experiment Plays Out in Two Mich.

In 2013, a charter school managed by Mosaica Education is recognized by the Ohio Department of Education as a "High Progress School of Honor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://education.ohio.gov/Topics/School-Improvement/Awards-and-Recognition/Schools-of-Honor | title = Schools of Honor | publisher = Ohio Department of Education | accessdate = 29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, Atlanta Preparatory Academy, a charter school managed by Mosaica, ranked in the bottom 20% of schools in Georgia based on standardized testing scores.&lt;ref name=turnaround&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educationturnaround.com |title=Mosaica Turnaround Partners |publisher=Educationturnaround.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atlanta Public Schools recommended that the Georgia Board of Education not renew the school's charter due to low standardized test scores.&lt;ref name=turnaround/&gt; The public school district was also concerned that the charter school's board lacked sufficient independence because it owed $801,384 to Mosaica.&lt;ref name=turnaround/&gt;

In 2014, Tatonka Capital sued Mosaica, claiming default on loans.&lt;ref name="tt140220"&gt;{{cite news|last1=MORGAN-BESECKER|first1=TERRIE|title=Firm sues Fell Charter School for $2.1 million|url=http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/firm-sues-fell-charter-school-for-2-1-million-1.1637744|accessdate=26 January 2018|publisher=Times-Tribune|date=February 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mosaica went into court-ordered receivership in September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TATONKA CAPITAL CORPORATION v.

'''Mosaica International Schools'''
Mosaica International Schools (formerly known as Mosaica American Schools) is Mosaica Education's division that operates private international schools located outside of the United States. Mosaica currently operates one school in Hyderabad, India, although a school in Guragon had been planned in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mosaicaeducation.com/paragon/our-pillars/ |title=Charter School Model &amp; Benefits &amp;#124; Mosiaca Education Pillars |publisher=Mosaicaeducation.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mosaica Education UK'''
Mosaica Education UK provides school management, professional development and education consulting services to schools and governments within the United Kingdom. At present Mosaica Education UK operates four academies in England under the Aurora Academies Trust.&lt;ref name=columbia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://columbia.news21.com/2009/indexee0c.html?p=1364 |title=A for-profit charter school company loses multiple clients. &amp;#124; columbia.news21.com &amp;#124; The Charter Explosion &amp;#124; Carnegie-Knight Initiative for Future of Journalism Education |publisher=columbia.news21.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paragon'''
Paragon is an accelerated learning program that replaces traditional social studies, history, geography and civics curriculum at the primary and secondary school levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.coloradoan.com/story/opinion/contributors/2014/08/06/soapbox-count-charter-good-school-option/13644917/ | title = Soapbox: Don't count out charter as good school option | work = Coloradoan | accessdate = 10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paragon also integrates the Visual and Performing Arts. Paragon supports scholarship in all subject areas by emphasizing pedagogies such as inquiry-based learning. Paragon was developed by Dr. Dawn Eidelman and is one of the eight pillars in Mosaica's accredited school model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michiganradio.org/post/many-muskegon-heights-students-dig-charter-company-s-curriculum-it-s-fun |title=Many Muskegon Heights students dig the charter company’s curriculum: "It’s fun." |publisher=Michigan Radio |date=2013-01-04 |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = theobserver&gt;{{cite web|author=Jamie Doward |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/may/18/academy-pays-for-us-curriculum |title=Sussex academy pays £100,000 to use 'patented' US school curriculum &amp;#124; Education &amp;#124; The Observer |publisher=Theguardian.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paragon==
One distinction of Mosaica Education is the use of its proprietary Paragon curriculum instead of traditional social studies in nearly all of its schools.&lt;ref name=hoovers/&gt;&lt;ref name="Is Profit Dead?"&gt;{{cite news|last=McCloskey|first=Sharon|title=Is Profit Dead?|url=http://columbia.news21.com/2009/index313f.html?p=752|accessdate=19 August 2011|newspaper=News21|date=July 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paragon was designed by Mosaica's co-founder Dr. Dawn Eidelman.

In a Michigan Radio article, some Mosaica students described the program as fun.&lt;ref name=educationweek/&gt; The same article quotes a former teacher as saying that Paragon has a one-size-fits-all approach that incorporated a "strict" teaching schedule making it hard for students to gain an understanding of the material or develop teacher / student relationships.&lt;ref name=educationweek/&gt;

An article published in May 2013 in ''[[The Observer]]'' commented that the Paragon curriculum appeared to be at odds with [[Secretary of State for Education|British Secretary of State for Education]] [[Michael Gove|Michael Gove's]] views of how history should be taught in the [British] curriculum. Gove's comment pertained to secondary students.&lt;ref name = theobserver/&gt; The article also referred to a 2003 study conducted by the [[American Federation of Teachers]] union, which suggested that self-evaluation measures taken by the school to demonstrate Paragon effectiveness had inflated student scores, a claim denied by the organization.

In February 2014, the Manav Rachna International School - Charmwood, which uses Paragon curriculum, received the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM) National Education Excellence Award for the "Best K-12 School in Teaching and Learning Practices."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://mriscwfaridabad.mris.edu.in/mris-charmwood-wins-assocham-national-education-excellence-award-2014/ | title = MRIS, Charmwood Wins ASSOCHAM National Education Excellence Award – 2014 | accessdate = 10 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, the UK Office of Standards in Education (Ofsted) changed its rating of King Offa Primary Academy from "Special Measures" to "Good" and praised its use of Paragon curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bexhillobserver.net/news/local/good-ofsted-news-for-bexhill-primary-school-1-5050860 | title = Good Ofsted news for Bexhill primary school | accessdate = 10 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and recognition==
In 2000, co-founder Dr. Dawn Eidelman received the Ten Outstanding Young Americans (TOYA) Award.&lt;ref name=outstanding&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jayceemember.com/toya/profile_Honoree.asp?hid=186 |title=Ten Outstanding Young Americans - The United States Junior Chamber - Honoree Profile |publisher=Jayceemember.com |date=2013-06-08 |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the United States Department of Education recognized Mosaica Education as an "Education Innovator".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ed.gov/news/newsletters/innovator/2003/0908.html |title=Archived: The Education Innovator-September 8, 2003 |publisher=.ed.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mosaica was recognized on the Inner-City 100 list for 4 consecutive years (2004–2007), including the #1 spot in 2005.&lt;ref name="autogeneratedicic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icic.org/resources-for-inner-city-ceos/inner-city-100-programs |title=Inner City 100 Program |publisher=ICIC |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.icic.org/markets-and-opportunities/fast-growing-companies | title = THE INNER CITY'S FASTEST-GROWING COMPANIES | publisher = ICIC | accessdate = 29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.inc.com/magazine/20050601/inner100-1-10.html | title = 100 Street-Smart Companies | publisher = Inc. | accessdate = 29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.inc.com/magazine/20060601/ic100-1-10.html | title = The Inner City 100 Profiles: 1-10 | publisher = Inc. | accessdate = 29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.inc.com/magazine/20070601/features-inner-city-100-71-80.html | title = The 2007 Inner City 100 Profiles: 71-80 | publisher = Inc. | accessdate = 29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''multiple mini-interview''' (MMI)&lt;ref name="EvaKW1"&gt;Eva KW, Reiter HI, Rosenfeld J, Norman GR. An admissions OSCE: the multiple mini-interview. [[Medical education]], 38:314–326 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; is an interview format that uses many short independent assessments, typically in a timed circuit, to obtain an aggregate score of each candidate's [[soft skills]]. In 2001, the [[McMaster University Medical School]] began developing the MMI system, to address two widely recognized problems. First, it has been shown that traditional interview formats or simulations of educational situations do not accurately predict performance in [[medical school]]. Secondly, when a licensing or regulatory body reviews the performance of a physician subsequent to patient complaints, the most frequent issues of concern are those of the non-cognitive skills, such as [[interpersonal skills]], professionalism and ethical/moral judgment. Since it was formally introduced at [[McMaster University Medical School]] in [[2004 (year)|2004]], it has been adopted by medical, dental, pharmacy, and veterinary schools around the world.

==Introduction==
Interviews have been used widely for different purposes, including assessment and recruitment.  Candidate assessment is normally deemed successful when the scores generated by the measuring tool predict for future outcomes of interest, such as job performance or job retention. [[Meta-analysis]] of the [[human resources|human resource]] literature has demonstrated low to moderate ability of interviews to predict for future job performance.&lt;ref name="BarrickMR"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barrick | first1 = MR | last2 = Mount | first2 = MK | year = 1991 | title = The Big 5 personality dimensions and job performance: a meta-analysis | url = | journal = Personnel Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 1–26 | doi=10.1111/j.1744-6570.1991.tb00688.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; How well a candidate scores on one interview is only somewhat correlated with how well that candidate scores on the next interview. Marked shifts in scores are buffered when collecting many scores on the same candidate, with a greater buffering effect provided by multiple interviews than by multiple interviewers acting as a panel for one interview.&lt;ref name="EvaKW2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eva | first1 = KW | last2 = Reiter | first2 = HI | last3 = Rosenfeld | first3 = J | last4 = Norman | first4 = GR | date = June 2004 | title = The relationship between interviewer characteristics and ratings assigned during a Multiple Mini-Interview | url = | journal = Academic Medicine | volume = 79 | issue = 6| pages = 602–9 | doi=10.1097/00001888-200406000-00021| pmid = 15165983 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The score assigned by an interviewer in the first few minutes of an interview is rarely changed significantly over the course of the rest of the interview, an effect known as the [[halo effect]].

Therefore, even very short interviews within an MMI format provide similar ability to differentiate reproducibly between candidates.&lt;ref name="DodsonM1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dodson | first1 = M | last2 = Crotty | first2 = B | last3 = Prideaux | first3 = D | last4 = Carne | first4 = R | last5 = Ward | first5 = A | last6 = de Leeuw | first6 = E | date = February 2009 | title = The multiple mini-interview: how long is long enough? | url = | journal = Medical Education | volume = 43 | issue = 2| pages = 168–74 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2923.2008.03260.x| pmid = 19161488 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ability to reproducibly differentiate between candidates, also known as overall test reliability, is markedly higher for the MMI than for other interview formats.&lt;ref name="EvaKW1"/&gt; This has translated into higher [[predictive validity]], correlating for future performance much more highly than standard interviews.&lt;ref name="EvaKW3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eva | first1 = KW | last2 = Reiter | first2 = HI | last3 = Rosenfeld | first3 = J | last4 = Norman | first4 = GR | date = October 2004 | title = The ability of the Multiple Mini-Interview to predict pre-clerkship performance in medical school | doi = 10.1097/00001888-200410001-00012 | journal = Academic Medicine | volume = 79 | issue = 10 Suppl | pages = S40–2 | pmid = 15383385 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReiterHI1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reiter | first1 = HI | last2 = Eva | first2 = KW | last3 = Rosenfeld | first3 = J | last4 = Norman | first4 = GR | date = April 2007 | title = Multiple Mini-Interview Predicts for Clinical Clerkship Performance, National Licensure Examination Performance | url = | journal = Medical Education | volume = 41 | issue = 4| pages = 378–84 | pmid = 17430283 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2929.2007.02709.x| citeseerx = 10.1.1.544.6911 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EvaKW4"&gt;Eva KW, Reiter HI, Trinh K, Wasi P, Rosenfeld J, Norman GR.

==History==
Aiming to enhance predictive correlations with future performance in medical school, [[Postgraduate education|post-graduate]] medical training, and future performance in practice, McMaster University began research and development of the MMI in 2001. The initial pilot was conducted on 18 [[Graduate school|graduate students]] volunteering as "medical school candidates". High overall test reliability (0.81) led to a larger study conducted in 2002 on real medical school candidates, many of whom volunteered after their standard interview to stay for the MMI. Overall test reliability remained high,&lt;ref name="EvaKW1"/&gt; and subsequent follow-up through medical school and on to national licensure examination (Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination Parts I and II) revealed the MMI to be the best predictor for subsequent clinical performance,&lt;ref name="EvaKW3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EvaKW4"/&gt; professionalism,&lt;ref name="ReiterHI1"/&gt; and ability to communicate with patients and successfully obtain national licensure.&lt;ref name="EvaKW4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HofmeisterM1"/&gt;

Since its formal inception at the [[Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine]] at McMaster University in 2004, the MMI subsequently spread as an admissions test across medical schools, and to other healing arts disciplines. By [[2008 (year)|2008]], the MMI was being used as an admissions test by the majority of medical schools in Canada, Australia, Israel, and Brunei. Also in 2008, a pilot test was conducted with the tool at the [[University of Cincinnati Academic Health Center#University of Cincinnati College of Medicine|University of Cincinnati College of Medicine]], and went live in the fall of that year, as the first implementation of MMI at a medical college in the United States;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Castano | first = Ellie | title = Illuminating who medical school applicants really are | work = UMassMedNOW | publisher = www.umassmed.edu | date = July 8, 2013| url = http://www.umassmed.edu/news/news-archives/2013/07/mmi-gives-students-multiple-opportunities-to-shine/ | accessdate = February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Koenig | first = Angela | title = UC College of Medicine Changes Admission Process to Screen for Healers, Not Just Health Care Providers| work = UC Health News | publisher = www.healthnewsuc.edu | date = August 17, 2009| url = http://healthnews.uc.edu/news/?/9032/ | accessdate = February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Koenig | first = Angela | title = Entrance into UC Medical School Based on New Guidelines| work = UC Health News | publisher = www.healthnewsuc.edu | date = September 8, 2011| url = http://healthnews.uc.edu/news/?/14446/ | accessdate = February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; additional medical schools in the country have since adopted the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Harris | first = Gardiner | title = New for Aspiring Doctors, the People Skills Test| work = The New York Times| publisher = www.nytimes.com | date = July 10, 2011| url = https://www.apetest.org/us/multiple-mini-interview-mmi/ | archiveurl = https://www.princeton.edu/hpa/PeopleSkillsTest.pdf | archivedate = July 18, 2011 |accessdate = February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These lead to the development of a McMaster spin-off company, APT Inc., to commercialize the MMI system. The MMI was branded as ProFitHR and made available to both the academic and corporate sector.&lt;ref name="ProFit"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ProFitHR.com | title=Welcome to ProFitHR}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2009, the list of other disciplines using the MMI included schools for [[dentistry]], [[pharmacy]], [[midwifery]], [[Physical therapy|physiotherapy]] and [[occupational therapy]], [[veterinary medicine]], [[Sonographer|ultrasound]] technology, [[nuclear medicine]] technology, [[Radiologic technologist|X-ray]] technology, [[medical laboratory]] technology, [[Podiatry|chiropody]], [[Dental hygienist|dental hygiene]], and postgraduate training programs in dentistry and medicine.

==MMI procedure==
#	Interview stations – the domain(s) being assessed at any one station are variable, and normally reflects the objectives of the selecting institution. Examples of domains include the "soft skills" – ethics, professionalism, interpersonal relationships, ability to manage, communicate, collaborate, as well as perform a task.  An MMI interview station takes considerable time and effort to produce; it is composed of several parts, including the stem question, probing questions for the interviewer, and a scoring sheet.
#	Circuit(s) of stations – to reduce costs of the MMI significantly below that of most interviews,&lt;ref name="RosenfieldJ1"&gt;Rosenfeld J, Eva KW, Reiter HI, Trinh K. A Cost-Efficiency Comparison between the Multiple Mini-Interview and Panel-based Admissions Interviews. Advanced [[Health science]] Education Theory Pract. 2008 Mar;13(1):43–58&lt;/ref&gt; the interview "stations" are kept short (eight minutes or less) and are conducted simultaneously in a circuit as a bell-ringer examination. The preferred number of stations depends to some extent on the characteristics of the candidate group being interviewed, though nine interviews per candidate represents a reasonable minimum.&lt;ref name="EvaKW2"/&gt; The circuit of interview stations should be within sufficiently close quarters to allow candidates to move from interview room to interview room.  Multiple parallel circuits can be run, each circuit with the same set of interview stations, depending upon physical plant limitations.
#	Interviewers – one interviewer per interview station is sufficient.&lt;ref name="EvaKW2"/&gt; In a typical MMI, each interviewer stays in the same interview throughout, as candidates rotate through.  The interviewer thus scores each candidate based upon the same interview scenario throughout the course of the test.
#	Candidates – each candidate rotates through the circuit of interviews. For example, if each interview station is eight minutes, and there are nine interview stations, it will take the nine candidates being assessed on that circuit 72 minutes to complete the MMI. Each of the candidates begins at a different interview station, rotating to the next interview station at the ringing of the bell.
#	Administrators – each circuit requires at least one administrator to ensure that the MMI is conducted fairly and on time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8251">The '''New Economic Mechanism (NEM)''' was a major [[economic reform]] launched in the [[People's Republic of Hungary]] in 1968. Between 1972 and 1978, it was curtailed by the prevailing winds of [[Eastern Bloc]] politics. During the subsequent decade, until the [[revolutions of 1989]] ended the era, the NEM's principles continued to affect the [[economy of Hungary|Hungarian economy]], even in cases where the "NEM" name was not emphasized. Because of the NEM, Hungary in the 1980s had a higher ratio of [[market mechanism]]s to [[economic planning|central planning]] than any other Eastern Bloc economy. The ratio was different to an extent that was [[politics|politically]] challenging to bring about in the Soviet sphere because of the [[ideology|ideological]] mixture it required. The name [[Goulash Communism]] was jokingly (but tellingly) applied to this mixture. The Hungarian economy under the influence of NEM principles was widely viewed as outperforming other Soviet Bloc economies, making Hungary "the happiest barrack" in [[barracks communism]]. Many Soviet and Eastern European people enjoyed going to Hungary (for example, on work assignments or on vacations) because of the economic and cultural environment there.

The tensions and harmonies between market mechanisms and central planning, with neither having sole control, are a perennial challenge in all societies that temper capitalism with socialism or vice versa. In some ways Hungary's economic reform channels comparisons with the [[Chinese economic reform]], in the sense that both were qualitative challenges to a [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] type of system—and thus that such reforms were not politically feasible in most of the Soviet Bloc.

== Reform ==
The period from 1956–1968 was one of reform in Eastern Europe. The beginning of these transformations was marked by the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], which resulted in [[János Kádár]]’s placement as the communist leader of the [[People's Republic of Hungary]] and the creation of the [[Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party]] (HSWP). For the first ten years of his rule, Kádár’s objective was to create a united Hungary, announcing in December 1961 that "those who are not against us are with us." Having reached social peace, Kádár turned his attention to economic improvement.

On May 7, 1966, the Central Committee of the HSWP announced Kádár’s plans for the reform of the economy, known as the New Economic Mechanism (NEM).&lt;ref name = "Belassa"&gt;Balassa, Bela. ''The Economic Reform in Hungary''. Economica, New Series, Vol. 37, No. 145. (Feb., 1970), pp 1-22.&lt;/ref&gt;  The reform is considered as "the most radical postwar change" of any [[Comecon]] country.&lt;ref name = "Granick"&gt;Granick, David. ''The Hungarian Economic Reform''. World Politics, Vol. 25, No. 3. (Apr., 1973), pp. 414-429.&lt;/ref&gt; The plan, which became official January 1, 1968, was a major shift to decentralization in an attempt to overcome the inefficiencies of [[central planning]]. The NEM represented a move away from the soviet economic system of compulsory plan indicators in favor of a policy that states profits as the enterprise's main goal. The new economic policy was a "comprehensive reform of the economic system", creating market relationships among firms, using prices as allocative functions and firms responding to prices to maximize profits, and using profits to budget new investments.&lt;ref name="Belassa"/&gt;

== Enterprises ==

The Central Committee’s document on May 7 details changes in the firm’s role under the new economic policy. The reform gave producers the freedom to decide what and how much they produce and offer for sale and to establish commercial or co-operative relationships. Buyers were also given the freedom to choose between domestic goods and imports. Additionally, firms were given greater autonomy in carrying out investments and hiring labor. As dictated by the Central Committee, success is to be measured by a firm’s profitability.&lt;ref name="Belassa"/&gt; The decentralized structure of the New Economic Mechanism marked an improvement in the decision making process, allowing for basic decisions to be made at the local level without information having to be transmitted upward for a more centralized decision.&lt;ref name="Granick"/&gt;  The Hungarian government made 50.5%(enterprises 49.5%) of the investment decisions for the 68 billion [[forint]] invested in 1968, while in 1974 enterprises accounted for 53.1% of the decisions for the 128 billion forint invested.&lt;ref name = "Das"&gt;Das Gupta, K.K.. ''The Nature of Post-Reform Economic Management in Eastern Europe: The Hungarian Case''. Social Scientist, Vol. 9, No. 1. (Aug., 1980), pp. 3-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prices ==

The New Economic Mechanism also aimed to create a more active role for prices.&lt;ref name = "Hare"&gt;Hare, P.G. ''Industrial Prices in Hungary Part I: The New Economic Mechanism''. [[Soviet Studies]], Vol. 28, No. 2. (Apr., 1976), pp. 189-206.&lt;/ref&gt;  A system of free prices reflecting market conditions was implemented. The government wanted flexibility, but also to combat inflation. To do so, they introduced a new practice of price controls declaring an item’s price as fixed, limited or free.

'''''Fixed prices''''' were classified as material and basic intermediate goods. The price was fixed because of the good’s impact on the economy and the overall need to ensure stability. The price was determined by ministries.

'''''Limited prices''''' referred to particular products or products in some product group for which there were no substitutes, such as bread. It was applied on the average price over a period or a window within which prices were free to fluctuate.

'''''Free prices''''' were assigned to goods that formed small parts of individual expenditures or were regarded as luxuries.&lt;ref name = "Hare"/&gt;

The price reform allowed for prices better to reflect the cost of production and the valuation by the market, and to correspond more closely to "some measure of socially necessary inputs",&lt;ref name = "Hare"/&gt; helping reach market equilibrium.

== Foreign Trade ==

The goal of the New Economic Mechanism consisted of improving Hungary’s economy to make Hungary a serious contributor to the international economy. In 1966 the Soviet Union accounted for 32% of Hungary’s exports and 29% of its imports. Of Hungary’s exports to Western Developed Countries, 42.7% was Food and Live Animals, 43.5% Manufactured Goods. Meanwhile, trade with Socialist Countries consisted largely of Manufactured Goods (81.3%). Conversely, Hungary’s imports from the West were primarily Manufactured Goods (70.6%).&lt;ref name = "Belassa"/&gt; Because of the pre-existing quota system which placed an emphasis on quantity, not quality, Hungarian goods were inferior and did not meet Western technological standards.

Decentralization provided enterprises with the opportunity to better align with the world market by giving them more freedom in deciding which products and technologies to invest in and manufacture. Additionally, firms were paid for exports in the Hungarian currency equivalent of the foreign currency they earned, as the government aimed to involve enterprises in foreign markets and in improving the quality of goods produced.&lt;ref name = "Granick"/&gt; The new plan established direct connections between the foreign and domestic markets on the basis of an appropriate exchange rate.&lt;ref name = "Granick"/&gt; The primary concern of the New Economic Mechanism was in improving foreign trade and establishing a relationship between success in exportation and a firm’s profitability.&lt;ref name = "Belassa"/&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to computer security:

'''[[Computer security]]''' &amp;ndash; [[security]] applied to computing devices such as [[computer]]s and [[smartphone]]s, as well as [[computer network]]s such as private and public networks, including the whole [[Internet]].  The field covers all the processes and mechanisms by which digital equipment, information and services are protected from unintended or unauthorized access, change or destruction, and is of growing importance in line with the increasing reliance on computer systems of most societies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/technology/opinion/reliance-spells-end-of-road-for-ict-amateurs/story-e6frgb0o-1226636267865?nk=34fe4ab684629535daaf6a8fe6e6ef3d "Reliance spells end of road for ICT amateurs"], May 07, 2013, The Australian&lt;/ref&gt; Computer security includes measures taken to ensure the integrity of files stored on a computer or server as well as measures taken to prevent unauthorized access to stored data, by [[physical security|securing the physical perimeter]] of the computer equipment, authentication of users or computer accounts accessing the data, and providing a secure method of data transmission.

== Essence of computer security ==
Computer security can be described as all of the following:

* a branch of [[security]]

== Areas of computer security ==
* [[Access control]] &amp;ndash; selective restriction of access to a place or other resource. The act of accessing may mean consuming, entering, or using. Permission to access a resource is called authorization.
:* [[Computer access control]] &amp;ndash; includes authorization, authentication, access approval, and audit.
:::[[Authentication]]
::::* [[Knowledge-based authentication]]
:::::* [[Integrated Windows Authentication]]
::::* [[Password]]
:::::* [[Password length parameter]]
:::::* [[Secure Password Authentication]]
:::* [[Secure Shell]]
:::* [[Kerberos (protocol)]]
:::* [[SPNEGO]]
:::* [[NTLMSSP]]
:::* [[AEGIS SecureConnect]]
:::* [[TACACS]]
* [[Cyber security and countermeasure]]
* [[Device fingerprint]]
** [[Physical security]] &amp;ndash; protecting property and people from damage or harm (such as from theft, espionage, or terrorist attacks). It includes security measures designed to deny unauthorized access to facilities, (such as a computer room), equipment (such as your computer), and resources (like the data storage devices, and data, in your computer). If a computer gets stolen, then the data goes with it. In addition to theft, physical access to a computer allows for ongoing espionage, like the installment of a [[hardware keylogger]] device, and so on.
* [[Data security]] &amp;ndash; protecting data, such as a database, from destructive forces and the unwanted actions of unauthorized users.&lt;ref name="Summers, G. 2004 p4-5"&gt;Summers, G. (2004). Data and databases.  In: Koehne, H Developing Databases with Access: Nelson Australia Pty Limited. p4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Information privacy]] &amp;ndash; relationship between collection and dissemination of data, technology, the public [[expectation of privacy]], and the legal and political issues surrounding them. Privacy concerns exist wherever [[personally identifiable information]] or other sensitive information is collected and stored – in digital form or otherwise. Improper or non-existent disclosure control can be the root cause for privacy issues.
** [[Internet privacy]] &amp;ndash; involves the right or mandate of personal privacy concerning the storing, repurposing, provision to third parties, and displaying of information pertaining to oneself via the Internet. Privacy can entail either Personally Identifying Information (PII) or non-PII information such as a site visitor's behavior on a website. PII refers to any information that can be used to identify an individual. For example, age and physical address alone could identify who an individual is without explicitly disclosing their name, as these two factors relate to a specific person.
* [[Mobile security]] &amp;ndash; security pertaining to smartphones, especially with respect to the personal and business information stored on them.
* [[Network security]] &amp;ndash; provisions and policies adopted by a network administrator to prevent and monitor unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or denial of a computer network and network-accessible resources. Network security involves the authorization of access to data in a network, which is controlled by the network administrator.
** [[Network Security Toolkit]]
** [[Internet security]] &amp;ndash; computer security specifically related to the Internet, often involving browser security but also network security on a more general level as it applies to other applications or operating systems on a whole. Its objective is to establish rules and measures to use against attacks over the Internet.

== Computer security threats ==

The variety of threats combined with the rapid development of new threats has made cyber insecurity and the removal of information assurance the 'status quo'.  As long as man continues to use the computer, man will also takes interest in manipulating, modifying, creating and bypassing 'rules' and 'security standards.' 

The most common and effective method of violating computer security protocols is Phishing; Phishing is the process of providing a cloned login page for a site the victim uses, for example, Google's Gmail - once the user enters his/her login information, the data is captured and access to the victims account is gained. 

Many corporations executive's, mid-ranking managers and even low level staff of many current U.S. corporations have no idea that a malicious user is quietly and passively intercepting their communications. Why? A strong motivation is the theft of Intellectual Property. Often victims of phishing either never become aware there privacy has been breached, or many months pass before they become aware that their privacy has been lost.  &lt;ref&gt;Kristopher Richey&lt;/ref&gt;

* Computer malfunction &amp;ndash; 
** [[Operating system]] failure and vulnerabilities
** [[Hard disk drive failure]] &amp;ndash; occurs when a hard disk drive malfunctions and the stored information cannot be accessed with a properly configured computer. A disk failure may occur in the course of normal operation, or due to an external factor such as exposure to fire or water or high magnetic fields, or suffering a sharp impact or environmental contamination, which can lead to a head crash.  Data recovery from a failed hard disk is problematic and expensive. Backups are essential 
* [[Computer and network surveillance]] &amp;ndash; 
** [[Man-in-the-middle attack|Man in the Middle]]
** Loss of anonymity &amp;ndash; when one's identity becomes known. Identification of people or their computers allows their activity to be tracked.  For example, when a person's name is matched with the IP address they are using, their activity can be tracked thereafter by monitoring the IP address.
*** [[HTTP Cookie]]
**** [[Local Shared Object]]
**** [[Web bug]]
*** [[Spyware]]
****[[Adware]]
** [[Cyber spying]] &amp;ndash; obtaining secrets without the permission of the holder of the information (personal, sensitive, proprietary or of classified nature), from individuals, competitors, rivals, groups, governments and enemies for personal, economic, political or military advantage using methods on the Internet, networks or individual computers through the use of cracking techniques and malicious software including Trojan horses and spyware. It may be done online from by professionals sitting at their computer desks on bases in far away countries, or it may involve infiltration at home by computer trained conventional spies and moles, or it may be the criminal handiwork of amateur malicious hackers, software programmers, or thieves.
*** [[Eavesdropping#Techniques|Computer and network eavesdropping]]
**** [[Lawful Interception]]
**** [[War Driving]]
**** [[Packet analyzer]] (aka packet sniffer) &amp;ndash; mainly used as a security tool (in many ways, including for the detection of network intrusion attempts), packet analyzers can also be used for spying, to collect sensitive information (e.g., login details, cookies, personal communications) sent through a network, or to reverse engineer proprietary protocols used over a network. One way to protect data sent over a network such as the Internet is by using [[encryption software]].
* [[Cyberwarfare]] &amp;ndash; 
* [[Exploit (computer security)|Exploit]] &amp;ndash; piece of software, a chunk of data, or a sequence of commands that takes advantage of a bug, glitch or vulnerability in order to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur on computer software, hardware, or something electronic (usually computerized). Such behavior frequently includes things like gaining control of a computer system, allowing privilege escalation, or a denial-of-service attack.
** [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan]]
** [[Computer virus]]
** [[Computer worm]]
** [[Denial-of-service attack]] &amp;ndash; an attempt to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users, usually consisting of efforts to temporarily or indefinitely interrupt or suspend services of a host connected to the Internet.  One common method of attack involves saturating the target machine with external communications requests, so much so that it cannot respond to legitimate traffic, or responds so slowly as to be rendered essentially unavailable.
*** [[Distributed denial-of-service attack]] (DDoS) &amp;ndash; DoS attack sent by two or more persons.
* [[Hacking tool]]
* [[Malware]]
[HID Spoofing keylogger] 
** [[Computer virus]]

** [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan]]
* [[Data loss]] &amp;ndash;
** [[File deletion]] &amp;ndash;
** [[Data loss prevention software]]
* [[Natural disasters]] &amp;ndash; fire, flood, etc. can cause loss of computers and data. Either fire or water can cause a hard disk drive failure, for example. Earthquakes can cause a data center to go down. For this reason large web businesses  use [[load balancing (computing)|load balancing]] and [[failover]] techniques to ensure [[business continuity]].
* [[Payload (computing)|Payload]] - malicious code that is delivered to a vulnerable computer, often masquerading  as something else
* Physical loss &amp;ndash; losing a computer (for example due to fire, or leaving one's laptop on a bus), results inke data loss, unless there is a [[backup]].
** Physical theft &amp;ndash; when someone takes property without authorization as his or her own.  When a computer is stolen, the data is gone too, unless there is a [[backup]].
*** [[Laptop theft]] &amp;ndash; stealing a laptop computer. Victims of laptop theft can lose hardware, software, and essential data that has not been backed up. Thieves also may have access to sensitive data and personal information. Some systems authorize access based on credentials stored on the laptop including MAC addresses, web cookies, cryptographic keys and stored passwords.
* [[Vulnerability (computing)|Vulnerabilities]]
** Exploitable vulnerability &amp;ndash; vulnerability for which an [[Exploit (computer security)|exploit]] exists
** [[Open port]] &amp;ndash; TCP or UDP port number that is configured to accept packets. Ports are an integral part of the Internet's communication model — they are the channel through which applications on the client computer can reach the software on the server. Services, such as web pages or FTP, require their respective ports to be "open" on the server in order to be publicly reachable. "Open" (reachable) is not enough for a communication channel to be established. There needs to be an application (service) listening on that port, accepting the incoming packets and processing them. Open ports are vulnerable when there is a service listening and there is no firewall filtering incoming packets to them.

=== Access control ===
[[Access control]] &amp;ndash; selective restriction of access to a place or other resource. The act of accessing may mean consuming, entering, or using. Permission to access a resource is called authorization.
* [[Computer access control]] &amp;ndash; includes authorization, authentication, access approval, and audit.
** [[Authorization (computer access control)|Authorization]] &amp;ndash; function of specifying access rights to computer resources. "To authorize" is to define an access policy. For example, human resources staff is normally authorized to access employee records and this policy is may be formalized as access control rules in a computer system. During operation, the computer system uses the access control rules to decide whether access requests from (authenticated) consumers shall be approved (granted) or disapproved (rejected). Resources include individual files or an item's data, computer programs, computer devices and functionality provided by computer applications. Examples of consumers are computer users, computer programs and other devices attempting to access data that is on a computer.
** [[Authentication]] &amp;ndash; act of confirming the identity of a consumer. In this context, a consumer is a computer user, computer program, or other device attempting to access data that is on a computer
*** [[User account]] &amp;ndash; system ID unique to each user. It allows a user to authenticate (log in) to a system and to be granted authorization to access resources provided by or connected to that system; however, authentication does not imply authorization. To log in to an account, a user is typically required to authenticate oneself with a password or other credentials for the purposes of accounting, security, logging, and resource management.
*** [[Password]] &amp;ndash; word or string of characters used for user authentication to prove identity or access approval to gain access to a resource (example: an access code is a type of password), which should be kept secret from those not allowed access.
** Access approval (computer access control) &amp;ndash;
** [[Audit (computer access control)|Audit]] &amp;ndash; 
* [[Physical security]] &amp;ndash; protecting property and people from damage or harm (such as from theft, espionage, or terrorist attacks). It includes security measures designed to deny unauthorized access to facilities, (such as a computer room), equipment (such as your computer), and resources (like the data storage devices, and data, in your computer). If a computer gets stolen, then the data goes with it. In addition to theft, physical access to a computer allows for ongoing espionage, like the installment of a [[hardware keylogger]] device, and so on. Examples of physical security system components include:
** [[Lock (security device)|Lock]]s &amp;ndash; locks may be used to secure a building or room that a computer is in. They may also be used on computer casings to prevent opening computers to remove or swap out parts, or install unauthorized components. And they may be used on a computer to disallow it from being turned on or used without a physical key. There are also locks to attach cables to laptops to prevent them from being taken.
*** [[Computer lock]] &amp;ndash;
** [[Security alarm]]s &amp;ndash;
** Security barriers &amp;ndash; such as fences and walls.
** [[Security guard]]s &amp;ndash;
** [[Theft recovery software]] &amp;ndash; as LoJack is to cars, theft recovery software is to desktop and laptop computers.

[[Data security]] &amp;ndash; protecting data, such as a database, from destructive forces and the unwanted actions of unauthorized users.&lt;ref name="Summers, G. 2004 p4-5"/&gt;

=== Information privacy ===
* [[Information privacy]] &amp;ndash; relationship between collection and dissemination of data, technology, the public expectation of privacy, and the legal and political issues surrounding them. Privacy concerns exist wherever personally identifiable information or other sensitive information is collected and stored – in digital form or otherwise. Improper or non-existent disclosure control can be the root cause for privacy issues.
** [[Internet privacy]] &amp;ndash; involves the right or mandate of personal privacy concerning the storing, repurposing, provision to third parties, and displaying of information pertaining to oneself via the Internet. Privacy can entail either Personally Identifying Information (PII) or non-PII information such as a site visitor's behavior on a website. PII refers to any information that can be used to identify an individual. For example, age and physical address alone could identify who an individual is without explicitly disclosing their name, as these two factors relate to a specific person.

=== Mobile security ===
* [[Mobile security]] &amp;ndash; security pertaining to smartphones, especially with respect to the personal and business information stored on them.

=== Network security ===
* [[Network security]] &amp;ndash; provisions and policies adopted by a network administrator to prevent and monitor unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or denial of a computer network and network-accessible resources. Network security involves the authorization of access to data in a network, which is controlled by the network administrator.
** [[Internet security]] &amp;ndash; computer security specifically related to the Internet, often involving browser security but also network security on a more general level as it applies to other applications or operating systems on a whole. Its objective is to establish rules and measures to use against attacks over the Internet. The Internet represents an insecure channel for exchanging information leading to a high risk of intrusion or fraud, such as phishing. Different methods have been used to protect the transfer of data, including encryption.
*** [[Virtual private network]] (VPN) &amp;ndash; extends a private network across a public network, such as the Internet. It enables a computer or network-enabled device to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if it were directly connected to the private network, while benefiting from the functionality, security and management policies of the private network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Microsoft Technet|title=Virtual Private Networking: An Overview|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb742566.aspx|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170925145332/https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb742566.aspx|archivedate=2017-09-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A VPN is created by establishing a virtual point-to-point connection through the use of dedicated connections, virtual tunneling protocols, or traffic encryptions.
**** [[IPsec]] &amp;ndash; protocol suite for securing Internet Protocol (IP) communications by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet of a communication session. IPsec includes protocols for establishing mutual authentication between agents at the beginning of the session and negotiation of cryptographic keys to be used during the session. IPsec can be used in protecting data flows between a pair of hosts (host-to-host), between a pair of security gateways (network-to-network), or between a security gateway and a host (network-to-host).
**** [[OpenVPN]] &amp;ndash; open-source software application that implements virtual private network (VPN) techniques for creating secure point-to-point or site-to-site connections in routed or bridged configurations and remote access facilities. It uses a custom security protocol that utilizes SSL/TLS for key exchange. It is capable of traversing network address translators (NATs) and firewalls. It was written by James Yonan and is published under the GNU General Public License (GPL).

'''Police state''' is a term denoting a [[government]] that exercises power arbitrarily through the power of the [[police force]]. Originally, the term designated a state regulated by a civil administration, but since the beginning of the 20th century it has "taken on an emotional and derogatory meaning" by describing an undesirable state of living characterized by the overbearing presence of the civil authorities.&lt;ref name="Tipton2013"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tipton |first=Elise K. |title=The Japanese Police State: Tokko in Interwar Japan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dWAQAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14 |accessdate=5 September 2014 |date=17 December 2013 |publisher=A&amp;C Black |isbn=9781780939742 |pages=14– }}&lt;/ref&gt; The inhabitants of a police state may experience restrictions on their mobility, or on their freedom to express or communicate political or other views, which are subject to police monitoring or enforcement. Political control may be exerted by means of a [[secret police]] force that operates outside the boundaries normally imposed by a [[constitutional state]].&lt;ref&gt;''A Dictionary of World History'', Market House Books, Oxford University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert von Mohl]], who first introduced the rule of law to German [[jurisprudence]], contrasted the ''[[Rechtsstaat]]'' ("legal" or "constitutional" state) with the anti-[[aristocracy|aristocratic]] ''Polizeistaat'' ("police state").&lt;ref&gt;''The Police State'', Chapman, B., Government and Opposition, Vol.3:4, 428–440, (2007). Accessible online at http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119912141/abstract, retrieved 15 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of usage ==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' traces the phrase "police state" back to 1851, when it was used in reference to the use of a national police force to maintain order in [[Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', Third edition, January 2009; online version November 2010. [http://www.oed.com:80/Entry/146832]; accessed 19 January 2011. {{dead link|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German term ''Polizeistaat'' came into English usage in the 1930s with reference to totalitarian governments that had begun to emerge in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CE0jmU-RloIC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=definition+%22police+state%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LaJtGH1off&amp;sig=P31qS33J1dtWrAPrxFKEv6fd0BQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=h3hUUPeaNITirQHmyIDQDw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=definition%20%22police%20state%22&amp;f=false The New Police Science: The Police Power in Domestic and International] edited by Markus Dubber, Mariana Valverde&lt;/ref&gt;

Because there are different political perspectives as to what an appropriate balance is between individual freedom and national security, there are no objective standards defining a police state. This concept can be viewed as a balance or scale. Along this spectrum, any law that has the effect of removing liberty is seen as moving towards a police state while any law that limits government oversight of the populace is seen as moving towards a [[Free state (government)|free state]].&lt;ref&gt;''Police State (Key Concepts in Political Science)'', Brian Chapman, Macmillan, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[electronic police state]] is one in which the government aggressively uses electronic technologies to record, organize, search and distribute forensic evidence against its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cu-digest.org/CUDS6/cud6.72 "Police Checkpoints on the Information Highway"], ''Computer underground Digest'', Volume 6 : Issue 72 (14 August 1994), {{ISSN|1066-632X}}, "The so-called 'electronic frontier' is quickly turning into an electronic police state."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EPS-2008NationalRankings&gt;[https://secure.cryptohippie.com/pubs/EPS-2008.pdf ''The Electronic Police State: 2008 National Rankings''], by Jonathan Logan, Cryptohippie USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Oprichnina]] established by [[Ivan the Terrible|Ivan IV]] within the [[Tsardom of Russia]] in 1565 functioned as a police state, featuring persecutions and [[autocratic rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gella|first1=Aleksander|title=Development of Class Structure in Eastern Europe: Poland and Her Southern Neighbors|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8keIXDyF_EoC|publisher=SUNY Press|publication-date=1989|page=217|isbn=9780887068331|accessdate=20 August 2016|quote=''Oprichnina'' was originally a band of faithful servants organized by Ivan IV into a police force; they were used by the tsar to crush not only all ''boyars'' (Russian nobility) under suspicion, but also the Russian princes [...].

The [[Soviet Union]] and its [[satellite states]], including [[East Germany]] and other members of the [[Soviet bloc]], had extensive and repressive police and intelligence services (such as the [[KGB]]). Approximately 2.5% of the East German adult population served as informants for the [[Stasi]], roughly one agent or informer for every 6.5 citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/k/koehler-stasi.html | author= John O. Koehler | title= Stasi: The Untold Story of the East German Secret Police | newspaper=The New York Times | accessdate= 22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Iran]], during the reign of the [[Shah of Iran|Shah]] [[Reza Shah|Reza Shah Pahlavi]], from 1925 to 1941, there was an increased police presence who arrested and tortured many people who were against his rule. Police presence and surveillance increased even more under the rule of Reza Shah's son, [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], from 1941 to 1979, with the creation of the [[SAVAK]] secret police. They were seen positioned on every street corner and were fiercely loyal to the Shah's rule and arrested and tortured many people; this reign also saw a sharp increase in [[Political prisoners|political prisoners]]. Public anger and mass uprisings against the Shah led to the [[Iranian Revolution]] in 1979 led by [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], which resulted in the overthrow of the Shah's reign and thus the abolishing of the [[Iranian monarchy]] and the creation of the [[Iran|Islamic Republic of Iran]], ending the over-2,500-year history of the monarchy. Police presence once again increased and worsened drastically with the creation of the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]], in particular the morality police, the [[Basij]] militia, who forcefully uphold Islamic law on civilians.

'''Racial politics''' is the practice of political actors exploiting the issue of race to forward an agenda.

==In Malaysia==
Malaysian [[politician]] Chang Ko Youn put forward "Malaysia has practised racial politics for 51 years and we know it is divisive as each party only talks on behalf of the racial group it represents... When all races are in a single party, no one person will try to be the champion of the party.... It is easy to be a Malay hero, a [[Malaysian Chinese]] hero or a [[Malaysian Indian]] hero but it is difficult to be a [[Malaysia]]n hero.... The country is facing economic problems now and it is important that the Government and political parties come up with a Malaysian agenda on how to unite the people and face these challenges..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file%3D%2F2008%2F8%2F11%2Fnation%2F22053356%26sec%3Dnation |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080814073017/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F8%2F11%2Fnation%2F22053356&amp;sec=nation |archivedate=2008-08-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|THE most important asset of a country is not its natural resources but its human resources. This is especially true in a knowledge-based economy, which will be the trend in future if it is not already the trend in most Western countries.}}

Writer A. Asohan wrote: "...you started to grow up, and race increasingly became a factor. You became aware of '''race politics''' here. Insidious people would hint that being friends with the "Other" made you a traitor to your own race. The racist rot seems to have intensified over the subsequent generations. The bigotry we learned as adults are now being picked up by our primary schoolkids. Our leaders may, in a fit of progressiveness (by their standards), talk about racial tolerance, but acceptance and appreciation for other races and cultures seem beyond their ken. Racial intolerance in the country is getting worse, we tell ourselves, looking back to a more idyllic past. Bah, what crock! We Malaysians have always been racists. Heck, the entire human race has always found some illusive basis for discrimination. Race, religion, colour, creed, whether you were born north or south of that artificial line called a border – we spend an inordinate amount of our time and resources on delineating our differences rather than celebrating our similarities. If you married someone from a different race in the old days, you faced severe social censure and were treated as an outcast. Parents wrung their hands and tore at their hair, wailing "What did we do wrong? Aiyoh, how can you do this to us?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file%3D%2F2008%2F6%2F1%2Flifefocus%2F21383981%26sec%3Dlifefocus |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628035840/http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F6%2F1%2Flifefocus%2F21383981&amp;sec=lifefocus |archivedate=2008-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philip Bowring of [[International Herald Tribune]] wrote that the political organization of Malaysia has long been largely on racial lines, [[Islam]] has at times become a device for use in '''racial politics''', a yardstick for measuring the commitment of competing parties to Malay racial advancement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/08/29/opinion/edbowring.php|title=Breaking News, World News &amp; Multimedia|website=www.iht.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cause===
According to many historians, the root cause of this strife between the ethnic communities and Malay nationalist sentiments like ketuanan Melayu was the lack of assimilation or amalgamation between the Malays and non-Malays. Because most of the migrants came as "guest workers" of the British, they felt little need to integrate into Malay society. (The Straits Chinese, most of whom were rich merchants instead of manual labourers, were an exception and managed to assimilate reasonably well, with many of them habitually speaking Malay at home, dressing in the Malay style, and preferring Malay cuisine.) Few bothered to even learn the Malay language; the census taken at independence showed that only 3% of Chinese aged ten and over, and 5% of Indians in the same age group, were literate in Malay. The comparable figure for the Malays stood at 46%.[41] The British educational policies, which segregated the different ethnicities—providing minimal public education for the Malays, and leaving the non-Malays to their own devices – did little to help matters. The Malays, who were predominantly rural-dwellers, were not encouraged to socialise with the non-Malays, most of whom resided in towns. The economic impoverishment of the Malays, which set them apart from the better-off Chinese, also helped fan racial sentiments.

This failure to assimilate or amalgamate has in turn been blamed on the British. George Maxwell, a high ranking colonial civil servant, credited the Malay aristocracy for its acceptance of non-Malay participation in public life, and attributed political discrimination to British colonial policy:

"With thirty-five years service in Malaya, and with intimate friendship with Rulers over two generations, I can say that I never heard one of them say anything that would tend to support [the exclusion of non-Malays from administrative appointments]. From the very earliest days of British protection, the Rulers have welcomed the leaders of the Chinese communities as members of their State Councils. Other [non-Malays] are now members of the State Councils. The policy of keeping [non-Malays] out of the administration owes its inception to British officials, and not to the Rulers."

On the basis of these policies, historians have argued that "Given the hostility toward Chinese expressed by many colonial officials and the lack of physical and social integration, it is not surprising that most Malays formed the opinion that Chinese were only transients in Malaya with no real attachments to the country."

Another contributing factor to ketuanan Melayu, according to historians, was the Japanese occupation during World War II. One states that the war "awakened a keen political awareness among Malayan people by intensifying communalism and racial hatred." This was widely attributed to the Japanese policies which "politicised the Malay peasantry" and intentionally fanned the flames of Malay nationalism. Racial tension was also increased by the Japanese practice of using Malay paramilitary units to fight Chinese resistance groups. Two Malay historians wrote that "The Japanese hostile acts against the Chinese and their apparently more favourable treatments of the Malays helped to make the Chinese community feel its separate identity more acutely ... it was also the beginning of racial tension between the Malays and Chinese."[44] A foreign commentator agreed, stating that "During the occupation period ... Malay national sentiment had become a reality; it was strongly anti-Chinese, and its rallying cry [was] 'Malaya for the Malays'..."

===The rich===
In the year 2006, [[Datuk Seri]] [[Anwar Ibrahim]] on his release from 6 years of prison said in a number of interviews that the NEP should be abolished and that all races should be given equal opportunities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file%3D%2F2006%2F11%2F15%2Fnation%2F16026587%26sec%3Dnation |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518184859/http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2006%2F11%2F15%2Fnation%2F16026587&amp;sec=nation |archivedate=2007-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and also that the NEP was bad because only the cronies of [[UMNO]] party became rich from it, however [[Khairy Jamaluddin]] from UMNO party hit out at him (Anwar Ibrahim) for saying that. Khairy said: "What cheek he has to speak" and also said that Anwar Ibrahim was the greatest UMNO party member of all and a very rich one too.

== In United States history ==
One of the Racial politics in United States is to describe racially charged political actions by [[Abigail Thernstrom]], the vice-chairman of the U.S. commission on civil rights.  The practice has been a major part of American government since its creation, and often divides the Republican and Democratic parties.

The United States Government has since the time of its creation been divided, and in many ways developed based upon issues of race.  In 1861 the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] between the Northern and Southern states of the nation was fought partially over the abolition of slavery.  Furthermore, the tension between the Northern Republicans and Southern Democrats continued for many years after as the South created [[Jim Crow laws]] and continued the segregation of individuals of color.  The Northern Republicans realized that the South would not simply erase the strong [[racial segregation|racial divide]] that existed despite the abolition of slavery, and so in hopes of having a functioning Government allowed for such restrictions to exist.

In 1896, the Supreme Court of the United States determined that the, "separate but equal", doctrine was constitutional in the case [[Plessy v. Ferguson]].  Segregation was legal, so long as the segregated schools and facilities provided to whites and blacks were equal.  Plaintiff [[Homer Plessy]], whose ancestry was 1/8 African American, was persuaded by civil rights activists in New Orleans to test a new law that required separate accommodations for blacks and whites on railroads.

In 1954, the ruling of Plessy v. Ferguson was overturned in the Supreme Court case [[Brown v. Board of Education]].  The Supreme Court determined that the establishment of separate schools for whites and blacks was inherently unequal and unconstitutional.  This was a major success for civil rights advocates, including the NAACP.

== In the current day United States ==
{{see also|Gerrymandering in the United States|Racism in U.S. politics}}
Perhaps the most glaring aspect of racial politics today is the re-drawing and shaping of district lines to seclude minorities in certain areas.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}  In doing this, Republicans and Democrats alike ensure certain trends in voting patterns and constituent concerns, as they place a high concentration of minorities within a voting district.  This is a crucial aspect of modern-day politics and is often a major factor in elections.

Its purpose was opposition to the renewed spread of [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] thought which began at that time; one of the standard antisemitic arguments was that Jews were supposedly disloyal to the countries they lived in.  German antisemites in particularly claimed that the Jews had [[stab-in-the-back legend|stabbed Germany in the back]] (''Dolchstosslegende'') in 1918.

Against this, the Reichsbund always emphasized 85,000 Jewish soldiers had fought for the [[German Empire]] in [[World War I]], and 12,000 had died, which put their loyalty to Germany beyond any reasonable doubt. They had received 30,000 medals and awards during the war. At its high point the Reichsbund had about 55,000 members.

The Reichsbund always was in opposition to [[Zionism]] and regarded the [[German Reich]] as the mother country of all German Jews.

All activities of the Reichsbund were outlawed by the Nazi government in 1936, and in 1938 it was completely dissolved.

==Quotation==
{{cquote|The RJF sees the basis of its work as complete allegiance to the German homeland. It does not have any goal or desire outside of this German homeland, and sharply rejects any movement which wishes to bring us German Jews to a position of outsiders in relation to this German homeland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fjgk.de/cms/artikel.13.htm Diaspora and Jewish Self-Understanding (in German)]: ''Der RJF sieht die Grundlage seiner Arbeit in einem restlosen Bekenntnis zur deutschen Heimat. Er hat kein Ziel und kein Streben außerhalb dieser deutschen Heimat und wendet sich aufs schärfste gegen jede Bestrebung, die uns deutsche Juden zu dieser deutschen Heimat in eine Fremdstellung bringen will.''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The words '''theoconservatism''' and  '''theocon''', [[portmanteau]]s of "[[theocracy]]" and "[[conservatism]]"/"conservative", generally occur as political labels referring to members of the [[Christian right]], particularly those whose ideology represents a synthesis of elements of [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatism]], [[Christian fundamentalism|conservative Christianity]], and [[social conservatism]], expressed through political means.  The term ''theocon'' first appeared in 1996 in an article in ''[[The New Republic]]'' entitled "Neocon v. Theocon" by [[Jacob Heilbrunn]], where he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he [[Neoconservatism|neoconservatives]] believe that America is special because it was founded on an idea—a commitment to the rights of man embodied in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]—not in ethnic or religious affiliations. The ''theocons'', too, argue that America is rooted in an idea, but they believe that idea is [[Christianity]].{{cn|date=July 2016}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mainstream media have used the terms to identify religious conservatives. [[Andrew Sullivan]], blogger at ''[[The Atlantic]]'', has commonly used the concept{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}, as have political cartoonists [[Cox &amp; Forkum]] in reference to former [[Florida]] [[Secretary of State]] [[Katherine Harris]].&lt;ref&gt;

'''Timothy Fridtjof "Tim" Flannery''' (born 28 January 1956) is an Australian [[Mammalogy|mammalogist]], [[paleontology|palaeontologist]], [[Environmentalism|environmentalist]], Australia's leading [[Conservation biology|conservationist]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Tim Flannery on Andrew Marr talk| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00z58b0| work=BBC Radio-Start the Week| accessdate=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Exploration|explorer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Tim Flannery| url=https://australianmuseum.net.au/tim-flannery| accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[global warming]] activist. Having discovered more than 30 [[Mammal|mammal species]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Interview: Tim Flannery, National Geographic| url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sS_aUYAgEA}}&lt;/ref&gt; (including new species of [[Tree-kangaroo|tree kangaroos]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Tree Kangaroo from New Guinea, Australian Museum| url= https://australianmuseum.net.au/mammology-collection-tree-kangaroo-from-new-guinea}}&lt;/ref&gt;), he served as the Chief Commissioner of the [[Climate Commission]], a Federal Government body providing information on climate change to the Australian public. On 23 September 2013, Flannery announced that he would join other sacked commissioners to form the independent [[Climate Council]], that would be funded by the community. 

Tim Flannery is a professorial fellow at the Melbourne Sustainable Society Institute, University of Melbourne.

Flannery was named [[Australian of the Year]] in 2007 and previously, until mid-2013, was a professor at [[Macquarie University]] and held the Panasonic Chair in Environmental Sustainability.&lt;ref name="pana chair"&gt;Macquarie University (2013). "[http://web.science.mq.edu.au/for/business_and_community/panasonic-chair/ PanasonicChair] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130712122647/http://web.science.mq.edu.au/for/business_and_community/panasonic-chair/ |date=12 July 2013 }}". Retrieved 23 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also chairman of the [[Copenhagen Climate Council]], an international climate change awareness group.&lt;ref name=copenhagen&gt;Copenhagen Climate Council (2008).

Retrieved 17 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; His sometimes controversial views on shutting down conventional coal-fired power stations for electricity generation in the medium term are frequently cited in the media.

== Background ==
Flannery was raised in a Catholic family in the Melbourne suburb of [[Sandringham, Victoria|Sandringham]], close to [[Port Phillip Bay]], where he learned to fish and scuba dive and became aware of marine pollution and its effects on living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2015/november/1446296400/tim-flannery/power-place |title= The Power of Place|periodical=The Monthly|last1= Flannery |first1= Tim |date= November 2015|publisher= Black Inc |access-date= 30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in English at [[La Trobe University]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latrobe.edu.au/alumni/profiles/full-profile?mode=results&amp;queries_given-name_query=Tim&amp;queries_family-name_query=Flannery Alumni profile search result, La Trobe University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120627122339/http://www.latrobe.edu.au/alumni/profiles/full-profile?mode=results&amp;queries_given-name_query=Tim&amp;queries_family-name_query=Flannery |date=27 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1977, and then took a change of direction to complete a Master of Science degree in [[Earth Science]] at [[Monash University]] in 1981.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} He then left Melbourne for Sydney, enjoying its subtropical climate and species diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction, ''The Birth of Melbourne'', {{ISBN|1-877008-89-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, Flannery earned a doctorate at the [[University of New South Wales]] in Palaeontology for his work on the evolution of [[Macropodidae|macropod]]s (kangaroos).{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Flannery has held various academic positions throughout his career. He spent many years in Adelaide, including a spell as professor at the [[University of Adelaide]], and 7 years as director of the [[South Australian Museum]]. He was also principal research scientist at the [[Australian Museum]], and an adviser on environmental issues to the [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Federal Parliament]]. In 1999 he held the year-long visiting chair of [[Australian studies]] at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="The Weather Makers-About TF"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theweathermakers.org/about/ | title=About Tim Flannery | publisher=The Weather Makers | accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Flannery was appointed as chair of South Australia's [Environmental Sustainability Board (South Australia)].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mike Rann's politics of the possible - South Australia|url = http://www.companydirectors.com.au/Director-Resource-Centre/Publications/Company-Director-magazine/2000-to-2009-back-editions/2002/September/Mike-Ranns-politics-of-the-possible-Centre-Liftout-South-Australia|website = Australian Institute of Company Directors|accessdate = 2015-06-09|date = 2002-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Flannery became professor in the Climate Risk Concentration of Research Excellence at [[Macquarie University]]. He left Macquarie University in mid-2013. Flannery is also a member of the [[Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists]], and a Governor of WWF-Australia. He has contributed to over 143 scientific papers.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Flannery is an advisor on climate change to outgoing South Australian Premier [[Mike Rann]], and is a member of the Queensland Climate Change Council established by the Queensland Minister for Sustainability, Climate Change and Innovation [[Andrew McNamara]]. In February 2011 it was announced that Flannery had been appointed to head the ''Climate Change Commission'' established by Prime Minister [[Julia Gillard]] to explain climate change and the need for a [[Carbon pricing|carbon price]] to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morton|first=Adam|title=Rudd critic to lead climate team|url=http://www.theage.com.au/environment/climate-change/rudd-critic-to-lead-climate-team-20110210-1aoqk.html|work=[[The Age]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=15 February 2011|date=11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He lives in a house with environmental features at Coba Point on the [[Hawkesbury River]], 40&amp;nbsp;km (25&amp;nbsp;mi) north of Sydney, accessible only by boat. Although situated 6 metres above high tide{{Citation needed|reason=[[WP:OR]] contributed by [[User:Tim Fridtjof Flannery]]|date=October 2017}}, unidentified critics suggested the "large, low-lying waterfront home" would be underwater if his predictions of sea level rise are borne out.&lt;ref name=getaway&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/prof-tim-flannerys-waterside-getaway/story-fn6b3v4f-1226104010903 | title=Prof Tim Flannery's waterside getaway |work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|date=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Climate Commission and Climate Council ==
On 10 February 2011, Flannery was appointed as the Chief Commissioner of the [[Climate Commission]] by the Australian Government. The Commission was a panel of leading scientists and business experts whose mandate was to provide an "independent and reliable" source of information for all Australians.&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web| title=About the Commission| url=http://climatecommission.gov.au/about/| publisher=Climate Commission| accessdate=24 September 2013| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827044300/http://climatecommission.gov.au/about/| archivedate=27 August 2013| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 September 2013, Flannery was sacked from his position as head of the Climate Commission in a phone call from new Federal Environment Minister [[Greg Hunt]]. It was also announced that the Commission would be dismantled and its remit handled by the [[Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities|Department of Environment]].&lt;ref name="sacked/dismantled"&gt;{{cite news| author=Jones, Gemma | title=Tim Flannery sacked, Climate Commission dismantled by Coalition| url=http://www.news.com.au/national-news/tim-flannery-sacked-climate-commission-dismantled-by-coalition/story-fncynjr2-1226722779566| accessdate=19 September 2013| newspaper=news.com.au| date=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/abbott-shuts-down-climate-commission-20130919-2u185.html | title=Abbott shuts down Climate Commission |author=Tom Arup |publisher=theage.com.au |date= |accessdate=27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 6 October 2013, Flannery and the other commissioners had launched a new body called the [[Climate Council]]. Flannery told ABC News that the organisation stated that it had the same goals as the former Climate Commission, to provide independent information on the science of climate change. Amanda McKenzie was appointed as CEO. Between 24 September and 6 October the new Climate Council had raised $1 million in funding from a public appeal, sufficient to keep the organisation operating for 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Climate Council, which replaced the axed Climate Commission, reaches $1 million funding target| url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-05/climate-council-has-sufficient-funding-to-operate-for-a-year/5000822| accessdate=15 October 2013|publisher=ABC| date= 6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientific contributions ==

===Mammalogy ===
Flannery's early research concerned the evolution of mammals in Australasia. As part of his doctoral studies, he described 29 new kangaroo species including 11 new genera and three new subfamilies. In the 1990s, Flannery published ''The Mammals Of New Guinea'' (Cornell Press) and ''Prehistoric Mammals Of Australia and New Guinea'' (Johns Hopkins Press), the most comprehensive reference works on the subjects. Through the 1990s, Flannery surveyed the mammals of [[Melanesia]] – discovering 21 new species – and took a leading role in conservation efforts in the region.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Future Eaters: About Tim Flannery | publisher = [[ABC Television (Australia)|ABC Television]] | year = 1998 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/science/future/abouttim.htm | accessdate = 10 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] of the [[Greater Monkey-faced Bat]] (''Pteralopex flanneryi''), only [[Bats discovered in the 2000s|described in 2005]], honours Flannery.&lt;ref&gt;Helgen, K. M. (2005). ''Systematics of the Pacific monkey-faced bats (Chiroptera : Pteropodidae), with a new species of Pteraloplex and a new Fijian genus.'' Systematics and Biodiversity, 3(4):433–453.&lt;/ref&gt;

Flannery's work prompted [[David Attenborough|Sir David Attenborough]] to describe him as being "in the league of the all-time great explorers like Dr [[David Livingstone]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Penguin UK Authors: About Tim Flannery | publisher = [[Penguin Books]] | url = http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Author/AuthorPage/0,,0_1000056817,00.html?sym=BIO | accessdate = 10 April 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930155226/http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Author/AuthorPage/0,,0_1000056817,00.html?sym=BIO | archivedate = 30 September 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Palaeontology ===

In 1980, Flannery discovered [[dinosaur]] [[fossil]]s on the southern coast of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and in 1985 had a role in the ground-breaking discovery of [[Cretaceous]] mammal fossils in Australia. This latter find extended the Australian mammal fossil record back 80&amp;nbsp;million years. During the 1980s, Flannery described most of the known [[Pleistocene]] megafaunal species in [[New Guinea]] as well as the fossil record of the [[phalangerid]]s, a family of possums.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"/&gt;

Flannery was awarded humanist of the year in 2005 for his outstanding work in zoology.

===Work on population and land use===

In 1994, Flannery published ''The Future Eaters: an Ecological History of the Australasian Lands and People'', and provides a sweeping glimpse of land, flora, fauna and people of the long past up to the present.

The synopsis of the work regards three waves of human migration in these regions. These waves of people Flannery describes as "future eaters". The first wave was the migration to Australia and New Guinea from south-east Asia approximately 40 000 – 60 000 years ago. The second was Polynesian migration to New Zealand and surrounding islands 800 – 3500 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flannery|first=Timothy Fridtjof|title=The future eaters: an ecological history of the Australasian lands and people|year=1994|publisher=Reed New Holland|location=Sydney|isbn=1-876334-21-5|pages=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third and final wave Flannery describes is European colonisation at the end of the eighteenth century.

Flannery describes the evolution of the first wave of future-eaters:

:''Sixty thousand or more years ago human technology was developing at what we would consider to be an imperceptible pace. Yet it was fast enough to give the first Australasians complete mastery over the ‘new lands’. Freed from the ecological constraints of their homeland and armed with weapons honed in the relentless arms race of Eurasia, the colonisers of the ‘new lands’ were poised to become the world’s first future eaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flannery|first=Timothy Fridtjof|title=The future eaters: an ecological history of the Australasian lands and people|year=1994|publisher=Reed New Holland|location=Sydney|isbn=1-876334-21-5|pages=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

While the book continues to be controversial in some of its hypotheses, it is a call to arms to preserve the Australasian natural heritage &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flannery|first=Timothy Fridtjof|title=The future eaters: an ecological history of the Australasian lands and people|year=1994|publisher=Reed New Holland|location=Sydney|isbn=1-876334-21-5|pages=dedication}}&lt;/ref&gt; – and by extension global natural heritage.

Perhaps his most controversial hypothesis regards early [[Australian Aboriginal]] history; Flannery paints an intriguing picture. Based on new sediment core studies, the continent up until 100,000 years ago had much greater expanses of rainforest than after Aboriginal arrival. He poses the "possibility" did Aborigines through firestick farming alter the ecology of Australian flora and fauna? &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flannery|first=Timothy Fridtjof|title=The future eaters: an ecological history of the Australasian lands and people|year=1994|publisher=Reed New Holland|location=Sydney|isbn=1-876334-21-5|pages=224–228}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flannery links other circumstantial evidence to the puzzle predisposing his hypothesis, such as the continent’s long suffering poor soils, historical extinction events of other continents and tens of thousands of years of fire adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flannery|first=Timothy Fridtjof|title=The future eaters: an ecological history of the Australasian lands and people|year=1994|publisher=Reed New Holland|location=Sydney|isbn=1-876334-21-5|pages=235–236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flannery also argues the hypothesis that at current population growth rate levels, Australasia is living beyond its population carrying capacity, to the extent that its biological stability has been damaged. European colonisation of Australia and New Caledonia brought its own artefacts and ways suitable in the ‘old world’, and yet struggle to adapt its "culture to biological reality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flannery|first=Timothy Fridtjof|title=The future eaters: an ecological history of the Australasian lands and people|year=1994|publisher=Reed New Holland|location=Sydney|ISBN=1-876334-21-5|pages=374, 389}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reality is evident in Australia, where unpredictable climate combined with a lack of natural life giving resources have created a flora and fauna that have adapted over millennia to be extraordinarily efficient in the consumption of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flannery|first=Timothy Fridtjof|title=The future eaters: an ecological history of the Australasian lands and people|year=1994|publisher=Reed New Holland|location=Sydney|isbn=1-876334-21-5|pages=85–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Future Eaters'' enjoyed strong sales and critical acclaim. Redmond O'Hanlon, a ''[[The Times Literary Supplement|Times Literary Supplement]]'' correspondent said that "Flannery tells his beautiful story in plain language, science popularising at its antipodean best". Fellow activist [[David Suzuki]] praised Flannery's "powerful insight into our current destructive path". Some experts disagreed with Flannery's thesis, however, concerned that his broad-based approach, ranging across multiple disciplines, ignored counter-evidence and was overly simplistic.&lt;ref name="abc-fe"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Future Eaters | publisher = [[ABC Television (Australia)|ABC Television]] | year = 1998 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/science/future/theses/theses.htm | accessdate = 10 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Future Eaters'' was made into a documentary series for [[ABC Television (Australia)|ABC Television]] and was republished in late 2013

In September 2005 Flannery said, "There are hot rocks in South Australia that potentially have enough embedded energy in them to run Australia's economy for the best part of a century".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2006/s1842715.htm |title= Tony Jones speaks with Tim Flannery|author=Jones, Tony|date=7 February 2007|work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/the-power-beneath-our-feet/2005/09/26/1127586753959.html |title=The power beneath our feet |author=Flannery, Tim|date=26 September 2005|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also for the [[Cooper Basin]], he proposed the establishment of a fully sustainable city where, "hundreds of thousands of people would live", utilising these geothermal energy reserves.

In October 2006 Flannery said, there will be, "no Arctic icecap in the next five to 15 years [ . . and . . ] the ocean will rise by six metres". He also quoted, "arguably the world authority on climate change" who said, "we have just a decade to avert a 25-metre rise of the sea".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/opinion/climates-last-chance/2006/10/27/1161749313108.html |title=Climate's last chance |author=Flannery, Tim|date=28 October 2006|work=[[The Age]]|accessdate=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2007, as he explained how increased soil evaporation impacts on runoff, he said "even the [existing amount of] rain that falls isn’t actually going to fill our dams and our river systems" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/landline/content/2006/s1844398.htm|title=Interview with Professor Tim Flannery|author=Sara, Sally|date=11 February 2007|work=Landline, [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|accessdate=24 July 2016|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331035952/http://www.abc.net.au/landline/content/2006/s1844398.htm|archivedate=31 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in June 2007, he said that, "Adelaide, Sydney and Brisbane, water supplies are so low they need desalinated water urgently, possibly in as little as 18 months".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencearchive.org.au/nova/newscientist/105ns_001.htm|title=Editorial: Australia – not such a lucky country|date=16 June 2007|work=[[New Scientist]]|accessdate=24 July 2016|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524055921/http://www.sciencearchive.org.au/nova/newscientist/105ns_001.htm|archivedate=24 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Species acclimatisation ===
[[File:Catagonus wagneri closeup.jpg|thumb|The Chacoan Peccary can be brought from Paraguay to North America, to replace the extinct Flat-headed Peccary]]
In ''The Future Eaters'', Flannery was critical of the European settlers [[Acclimatisation society|introducing]] [[Introduced species|non-native]] wild animals into Australia's ecosystem. At the same time, he suggested that if one wanted to reproduce, in some parts of Australia, the ecosystems that existed there ca. 60,000 years ago (before the arrival of the humans on the continent), it may be necessary to introduce into Australia, in a thoughtful and careful way, some non-native species that would be the closest substitutes to the continent's lost [[Australian megafauna|megafauna]]. In particular, the [[Komodo dragon]] can be brought into Australia as a replacement for its extinct relative, ''[[Megalania]]'', "the largest [[goanna]] of all time". The [[Tasmanian devil]] could also be allowed to re-settle the mainland Australia from its Tasmanian refuge area.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Flannery, ''The Future Eaters'', pp. 384–385. {{ISBN|0-8021-3943-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Eternal Frontier'', Flannery made a proposal for what later became nicknamed "[[Pleistocene rewilding]]": restoring the ecosystems that existed in North America before the arrival of the [[Clovis culture|Clovis people]] and the concomitant disappearance of the North American [[Pleistocene megafauna]] ca. 13,000. He wonders if, in addition to the wolves that have been already re-introduced to [[Yellowstone National Park]], ''ambush predators'', such as [[jaguar]]s and lions should be reintroduced there as well, in order to bring the number of [[elk]]s under control. Furthermore, the closest extant relatives of the species that became extinct around the Clovis period could be introduced to North America's nature reserves as well. In particular, the [[Indian elephant|Indian]] and [[African elephant|African]] elephants could substitute, respectively, for the [[mammoth]] and the [[mastodon]]; the [[Chacoan Peccary]], for its extinct cousin the flat-headed Peccary (''[[Platygonus compressus]]''). [[Llama]]s and [[Panthera|panther]]s, which still survive outside of the USA, should too be brought back to that country.&lt;ref&gt;Flannery, ''The Eternal Frontier'', {{ISBN|1-876485-72-8}}, pp. 345–346. On the peccary, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Carbon emissions ===

In ''[[The Weather Makers|The Weather Makers: The History &amp; Future Impact of Climate Change]]'', Flannery outlined the science behind anthropogenic [[climate change]]. "With great scientific advances being made every month, this book is necessarily incomplete," Flannery writes, but "That should not, however, be used as an excuse for inaction. We know enough to act wisely."

Concepts outlined in the book include:

* That a failure to act on climate change may eventually force the creation of a global carbon dictatorship, which he calls the "Earth Commission for Thermostatic Control", to regulate carbon use across all industries and nations – a level of governmental intrusion that Flannery describes as "very undesirable";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Hurricanes can be tied to climate change | first = Tony | last = Jones | work = Lateline | publisher = ''[[ABC Television (Australia)|ABC Television]]'' | date = 26 September 2005 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2005/s1468878.htm | accessdate = 10 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and
* the establishment of "Geothermia"&lt;ref name = "Geothermia"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=_4mzCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT297&amp;lpg=PT297&amp;dq=flannery+Geothermia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0aj5ltBv9n&amp;sig=gGaEKTX_O0wpHUdh7dAwA_qP7og&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwic5PHai-3OAhVFqJQKHeVcC984ChDoAQhFMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=flannery%20Geothermia&amp;f=false |title=The Moral Vacuum |author=Gabe, Martyn|date=2009| accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; – a new city at the NSW-South Australia-Queensland border – to take advantage of the location's abundance of natural gas reserves, geothermal and solar energy. Flannery argues that such a city could be completely energy self-sufficient, and would be a model for future city development worldwide. Of the city project, Flannery told ''The Bulletin'' that "I know it's radical but we have no choice".

The book won international acclaim. [[Bill Bryson]] concluded that "It would be hard to imagine a better or more important book." ''The Weather Makers'' was honoured in 2006 as 'Book of the Year' at the New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Weather Makers: All About the Book | publisher = [[Text Publishing]] | year = 2006 | url = http://www.theweathermakers.com/weathermakers/ | accessdate = 10 April 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070322222441/http://www.theweathermakers.com/weathermakers/ | archivedate = 22 March 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flannery's work in raising the profile of environmental issues was key to his being named Australian of the Year in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Lewis, Wendy | title=Australians of the Year | publisher=Pier 9 Press | year=2010 | isbn=978-1-74196-809-5 | authorlink=Wendy Lewis }}&lt;/ref&gt; Awarding the prize, former Prime Minister [[John Howard]] said that the scientist "has encouraged Australians into new ways of thinking about our environmental history and future ecological challenges."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Climate change crusader is Australian of the Year | publisher = ''[[The West Australian]]'' | date = 25 January 2007 | url = http://www.thewest.com.au/default.aspx?MenuID=145&amp;ContentID=19672 | accessdate = 10 April 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927192549/http://www.thewest.com.au/default.aspx?MenuID=145&amp;ContentID=19672 |archivedate = 27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That said, Howard – along with many others – remains unconvinced as to Flannery's proposed solutions. Flannery joined calls for the cessation/reduction of conventional coal-fired power generation in Australia in the medium term, the source of most of the nation's electricity. Flannery claims that conventional coal burning will lose its social license to operate, as has asbestos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Coal will be the new asbestos, says Flannery | publisher = ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' | date = 9 February 2007 | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/environment/coal-will-be-the-new-asbestos-says-flannery/2007/02/08/1170524236625.html | accessdate = 10 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2014-09-21 Tim Flannery Peoples Climate March Melbourne 600 0485.JPG|thumb|Tim Flannery speaking at the Peoples Climate March in Melbourne, September 2014]]

In response to the introduction of proposed [[clean coal technology]], Flannery has stated: "Globally there has got to be some areas where clean coal will work out, so I think there will always be a coal export industry [for Australia] ... Locally in Australia because of particular geological issues and because of the competition from cleaner and cheaper energy alternatives, I'm not 100 per cent sure clean coal is going to work out for our domestic market."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,21225432-661,00.html "Coal Can't Be Clean – Flannery"], ''Melbourne Herald Sun'', 14 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 Flannery was in support of [[nuclear power]] as a possible solution for reducing Australia's [[carbon emissions]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Julie-Anne | last = Davies | title = Dr Flannery, I presume | publisher = ''[[The Bulletin]]'' | date = 23 February 2007 | url = http://bulletin.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=228258 | accessdate = 10 April 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070403095709/http://bulletin.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=228258 | archivedate = 3 April 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/opinion/lets-talk-about-nuclear-power-emandem-other-energy-sources/2006/05/29/1148754933159.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Let's talk about nuclear power ''and'' other energy sources | date=30 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; however in 2007 changed his position against it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crikey.com.au/2009/02/05/flip-flop-flannery-is-a-climate-change-opportunist/ Clive Hamilton:''Flip-flop Flannery is a climate change opportunist'', in Crikey 5 February 2009], retrieved 17 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2007 he told a business gathering in Sydney that while nuclear energy does have a role elsewhere in the world, Australia's abundance of renewable resources rule out the need for nuclear power in the near term. He does however feel that Australia should and will have to supply its uranium to those other countries that do not have access to renewables like Australia does.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/nuclear-power-a-turnoff-flannery-changes-stance/2007/05/22/1179601413336.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Nuclear power a turn-off: Flannery changes stance | date=23 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008 Flannery created controversy by suggesting that sulphur could be dispersed into the atmosphere to help block the sun leading to global dimming, in order to counteract the effects of global warming.&lt;ref name="cm-dim"&gt;{{cite news|last=Alexander|first=Cathy|url=http://www.news.com.au/top-stories/climate-plan-could-change-sky-colour/story-e6frfkp9-1111116384553|title=Tim Flannery's radical climate change 'solution'|date=19 May 2008|work=[[News.com.au]]|agency=[[Australian Associated Press]]|accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017 Flannery hosted an episode of [[Catalyst (TV program)|ABC Catalyst]] investigating how carefully-managed seaweed growth could contribute to combating climate change via the sequestration of atmospheric carbon to the ocean floor.  In January 2018 Flannery appeared on the ABC's Sciencey program exploring whether humans are becoming a new [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lw-hTF2EvWk&amp;t=0s&amp;index=17&amp;list=PLJI8aSIWm2aB2rWQLI-flwILAgbNAx9xt 'Mass Extinction Event'], in addition to outlining the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ba2y9xSzjUk&amp;list=PLJI8aSIWm2aB2rWQLI-flwILAgbNAx9xt&amp;index=1 '5 Things You Need to Know About Climate Change'].

=== Sustainable whaling ===
When, in the concluding chapters of ''The Future Eaters'' (1994), Flannery discusses how to "utilise our few renewable resources in the least destructive way", he remarks that
: ''A far better situation for conservation in Australia would result from a policy which allows exploitation of ''all'' of our biotic heritage, provided that it all be done ''in a sustainable manner''. ... [I]f it is possible to harvest for example, 10 [[mountain pygmy-possum]]s (Burramys parvus) or 10 [[southern right whale]]s (Balaena glacialis) per year, why should we not do it? ... Is it more moral to kill and consume a whale, without cost to the environment, than to live as a vegetarian in Australia, destroying seven kilograms of irreplaceable soil, ... for each kilogram of bread we consume?''&lt;ref&gt;Tim Flannery, ''The Future Eaters'', pp. 402–403. {{ISBN|0-8021-3943-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2007, Flannery suggested that the [[Whaling in Japan|Japanese whaling]] involving the relatively common [[Minke Whale]] may be [[sustainable]]:

: ''In terms of sustainability, you can't be sure that the Japanese whaling is entirely unsustainable... It's hard to imagine that the whaling would lead to a new decline in population''&lt;ref name=whaling2&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,22987914-5001021,00.html Flannery says whaling is OK.] The Daily Telegraph.

== Activism ==

Flannery has achieved prominence through his [[environmental activism]]. His advocacy on two issues in particular, population levels and carbon emissions, culminated in being named [[Australian of the Year]] (2007) at a time when environmental issues were becoming prominent in Australian public debate.

At present, the votes are tallied booth by booth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/elections2009/volume1/Chap-39.pdf |title=Know Your Electronic Voting Machine |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/ec-rejects-mayas-evm-charges-machines-are-fool-proof-says-commission/articleshow/57596074.cms|title=EC rejects Maya's EVM charges, machines are fool-proof, says commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functioning==
[[File:Totaliser EVMs.jpg|thumb|right|Totaliser with EVMs]]
[[Bharat Electronics Limited]], [[Bengaluru]], and [[Electronics Corporation of India Limited]], [[Hyderabad, Telangana|Hyderabad]], developed the totaliser. Totaliser is an interface, which is connected to main control units of a cluster of 14 EVMs (hence, in 14 polling stations), and the consolidated result of votes cast for each candidate in that group of EVMs can be obtained by pressing the result button in the totaliser, but without disclosing the votes polled by a candidate polling-station-wise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/election-commission-for-new-machine-to-enhance-voter-secrecy/article7065217.ece|title=EC for new machine to enhance voter secrecy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianage.com/india/all-india/180217/ministers-reject-ec-bid-for-device-to-hide-voting-trends.html|title=Ministers reject EC bid for device to hide voting trends}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A [[Public Interest Litigation]] has been filed in Supreme Court in 2014 seeking a direction to the poll panel to mix up the votes cast in the various polling stations in a constituency, to prevent the candidates intimidating voters in areas that had rebuffed them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/national/ec-plan-to-use-totaliser-rejected/article9262589.ece|title=EC plan to use ‘Totaliser’ rejected}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Election Commission of India]] initially suggested the measure to UPA Government in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/New+counting+method+for+Assembly+polls/1/21718.html|title=New counting method for Assembly polls}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/blog/what-evm-tampering-debate-is-totally-overlooking-1679438?pfrom=home-opinion|title=What EVM Tampering Debate Is Totally Overlooking}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Indian general election, 2014]], former Maharashtra deputy chief minister [[Ajit Pawar]] had allegedly threatened the voters that his party, [[Nationalist Congress Party]], would be able to detect the voting patterns from the electronic voting machine readings and cut off their water supply if they snubbed it in [[Baramati (Lok Sabha constituency)]]. Law Commission said Totaliser would also help in situations such as witnessed in  [[Hoshangabad (Lok Sabha constituency)]] in 2014, where lone voter casted vote in Mokalvada polling station in Sohagpur area. Before the introduction of the electronic voting machines in India, ballot papers were mixed wherever necessary to prevent disclosure of the voting patterns.

In February 2017, NDA Government opposed totaliser in its affidavit in Supreme Court,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/ec-proposes-machines-to-mask-voting-pattern-govt-disposes-4471649/|title=Election Commission proposes machines to mask voting pattern, Govt shoots it down}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Law Commission of India]] and the [[Election Commission of India]] had favoured the introduction of a totaliser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pursuit-for-poll-reforms-will-continue-chief-election-commissioner-nasim-zaidi/story-JHwrZx5SfLwhfqRbHxDPfN.html|title=Pursuit for poll reforms will continue: Chief election commissioner Nasim Zaidi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalheraldindia.com/news/2017/03/11/elections-why-is-the-bjp-opposed-to-the-totaliser-machine-meant-to-protect-voter-identity|title=Elections: Why is the BJP opposed to the ‘Totaliser’ machine?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress, NCP and BSP “categorically” supported its proposal to use ‘totaliser’ machine while BJP, Trinamool Congress and [[Pattali Makkal Katchi|PMK]] opposed totaliser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-editorials/protect-the-voter-introduction-of-totaliser-machines-a-positive-for-electoral-processes/|title=Protect the voter: Introduction of totaliser machines a positive for electoral processes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Politics/R5pgDFYqMSFRMRfyrOm0DJ/Govt-rejects-Election-Commissio-proposal-for-machine-to-hide.html|title=Govt rejects Election Commission proposal for machine to hide voting pattern}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United Nations Security Council resolution 1269''', adopted unanimously on 19 October 1999, after expressing concern at the increasing number of acts of international terrorism, the Council condemned terrorist attacks and called upon states to fully implement [[Anti-terrorism legislation|anti-terrorist conventions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/1999/19991019.sc6741.doc.html|title=Security Council unequivocally condemns terrorism as 'criminal and unjustifiable'|date=19 October 1999|publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time the Security Council had addressed terrorism in a general manner, though it did not define what constituted terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lehto|first=Marja|title=Indirect responsibility for terrorist acts: redefinition of the concept of terrorism beyond violent acts|year=2009|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=978-90-04-17807-6|page=348}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ganor|first=Boaz|title=Security Council Resolution 1269 – What it Leaves Out|url=http://www.ict.org.il/Articles/tabid/66/Articlsid/38/currentpage/29/Default.aspx|publisher=[[International Policy Institute for Counter-Terrorism]]|date=25 October 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resolution==
===Observations===
The Security Council was mindful of [[United Nations General Assembly resolution|resolutions]] passed by the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] including  Resolution 49/60 (1994) concerning measures to eliminate international terrorism. There was a necessity to intensify the fight against terrorism at the national level and strengthen international co-operation with respect for [[international humanitarian law|international humanitarian]] and human rights law. To this end it supported efforts to promote worldwide participation in and implementation of existing anti-terrorist conventions and the development of new anti-terrorist instruments.

===Acts===
Acting under [[Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter]], the resolution unequivocally condemned all acts of worldwide terrorism as criminal and unjustifiable regardless of the circumstances in which the acts were committed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nesi|first=Giuseppe|title=International cooperation in counter-terrorism: the United Nations and regional organizations in the fight against terrorism|year=2006|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd|isbn=978-0-7546-4755-3|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; All countries were called upon to implement international anti-terrorist conventions to which they were party to; states that had not adopted such measures were urged to do so immediately. The Council stressed that the United Nations played a vital role in strengthening international co-operation in the fight against terrorism.

All countries were urged to take the following steps:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ward|first=Curtis A.|title=Building Capacity to Combat International Terrorism: The Role of the United Nations Security Council|journal=Journal of Conflict and Security Law|year=2003|volume=8|issue=2|pages=289–305|doi=10.1093/jcsl/8.2.289}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crossette|first=Barbara|title=U.N. Council in Rare Accord: Fight Terrorism|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/20/world/un-council-in-rare-accord-fight-terrorism.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=20 October 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:(a) co-operate with each other through mutual agreements to prevent terrorist acts and prosecute perpetrators;
:(b) prevent and suppress the preparation and financing of terrorist acts through all possible legal means;
:(c) deny safe havens for those who commit terrorist acts through prosecution and [[extradition]];
:(d) ensure that [[asylum seeker]]s are not terrorists before granting them [[refugee]] status through appropriate measures;
:(e) participate in information exchanges and judicial co-operation to prevent terrorist acts.

The Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] was asked to pay close attention to the need to prevent threats to international security as a result of terrorist acts. Finally, the Council expressed its readiness to take further measures in order to counter terrorist threats.

The '''United Pasokmomogun Kadazan Organisation''' (UPKO) was a political party in [[Sabah]] at the time it became a state of [[Malaysia]] in the 1960s.

The party was founded by [[Tun Fuad Stephens|Donald Stephens]] in 1961 as the United National Kadazan Organisation (UNKO). Its core constituency was indigenous Sabahans. At the time of its founding it had approximately 20,000 members.&lt;ref name="lim"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lim|first=Regina|title=Federal-state Relations in Sabah, Malaysia: The Berjaya Administration, 1976-85|year=2008|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the formation of Malaysia in 1963, the party entered into a coalition with the [[United Sabah National Organisation]] (USNO), a Muslim party, and the [[Sabah Chinese Association]] (SCA) to form a consociationalist government of the new state of Sabah. Stephens became the state's first chief minister.&lt;ref name="lim"/&gt; In the same year, UNKO renamed itself the United Pasokmomogun Kadazan Organisation (UPKO). 

Stephens was forced out of the chief ministership in 1964 and became a federal minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www2.nst.com.my/opinion/columnist/sabah-foresees-a-brighter-future-1.355421|title=Sabah foresees a brighter future|last=Luping|first=Herman|date=14 September 2013|work=New Straits Times|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party dissolved in 1967 and was absorbed by USNO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2012/06/19/former-federal-minister-celebrates-80th-birthday-in-style/|title=Former federal minister celebrates 80th birthday in style|date=19 June 2012|work=Borneo Post|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United States Chamber of Commerce''' ('''USCC''') is a business-oriented [[United States of America|American]] [[lobbying group]].  It is not an [[Government agency|agency]] of the United States government.

Politically, the Chamber usually supports [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] political candidates, though it has occasionally supported [[conservative Democrat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/oct/08/news/la-pn-chamber-ads-20101009 | work=Los Angeles Times | first1=Matea | last1=Gold | first2=Kim | last2=Geiger | title=Republican-leaning U.S. Chamber of Commerce buys ads supporting Democrats | date=8 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Verini"&gt;Verini, James (July/August 2010).

==History==
[[File:Charles Nagel, 1849–1940.jpg|thumb|Charles Nagel, [[United States Secretary of Commerce and Labor]] and founder of the United States Chamber of Commerce]]
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce's own history of itself describes it as originating from an April 22, 1912, meeting of delegates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uschamber.com/about/history |title=U.S. Chamber of Commerce website, "History" |publisher=Uschamber.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chamber was created by [[William Howard Taft|President Taft]] as a counterbalance to the [[Labor history of the United States|labor movement]] of the time.&lt;ref name="Verini"/&gt; John H. Fahey was the first [[chairman]],&lt;ref name= opensoffice&gt;"Opens Office to Aid Trade". ''The Washington Post''. April 26, 1912. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; and Henry A. Wheeler was the first [[president (corporation)|president]]&lt;ref name= indorse&gt;"Delegates Indorse Reformed Calendar". ''The New York Times''.

''The New York Times''. March 6, 1913. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; It opened its first office in the [https://www.google.com/maps/place/1420+New+York+Ave+NW,+Washington,+DC+20005/@38.8987713,-77.0330426,19z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89b7b796308f2d41:0x1a18ef80d0db6b7b!8m2!3d38.8987703!4d-77.0324954?hl=en Evans Building].&lt;ref name= opensoffice/&gt; In 1913, President Taft spoke at its first banquet at the [[Willard InterContinental Washington|Willard Hotel]], where he called for the organization to [[lobbying in the United States|lobby]] for comprehensive currency legislation and to support the [[Commission on Economy and Efficiency]].&lt;ref name= thirdtermer&gt;"'No Third Termer'". ''The Washington Post''. January 23, 1913. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; During its first year in existence, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's membership consisted of 297 commercial organizations and 165,000 firms and individuals.&lt;ref name=fifteennew&gt;"Add Fifteen New Members". ''The Washington Post''. February 13, 1913. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Washington, D.C., headquarters of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce occupies land that was formerly the home of [[Daniel Webster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uschamber.com/about/history/building-history |title=U.S. Chamber of Commerce website, "History of the building" |publisher=Uschamber.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although all chambers can work with all levels of government, they tend to concentrate their efforts on specific levels: Local chambers of commerce tend to focus on local issues, state chambers on state issues, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce focuses on national issues at the federal government level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=https://www.uschamber.com/about-us/about-us-chamber/frequently-asked-questions#9|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They also work closely with a number of youth organizations in the country about the value and role of business in our society today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maintour.com/meritbadge/american_business.htm American Business BSA Merit Badge Guide], 22 Jun 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=June 2017|reason=ref is a link to a single scouting-related website, which does not document any background; USCC listed only as a research resource}}

In 1993, the Chamber lost several members over its support for [[Clinton health care plan of 1993|Clinton's healthcare reform efforts]].  The Chamber had chosen to support healthcare reform at that time due to the spiraling healthcare costs experienced by its members.  However, House Republicans retaliated by urging boycotts of the organization.  The Chamber operated its own cable television station, Biz-Net until 1997 in order to promote its policies.  The Chamber shifted somewhat more to the right when Tom Donohue became head of the organization in 1997.  By the time health care reform became a major issue again in 2010–2012, the organization opposed such efforts.&lt;ref name="Verini"/&gt;

In late 2011 it was revealed that the Chamber's computer system was breached from November 2009 to May 2010 by Chinese hackers.  The purpose of the breach appeared to be gain information related to the Chamber's lobbying regarding Asian trade policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204058404577110541568535300|title=Chinese Hackers Hit U.S. Chamber - WSJ.com|last=Gorman|first=Siobahn|date=21 December 2011|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=21 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since a [[Lewis F. Powell, Jr.#Powell Memorandum|1971 internal memo]] by [[Lewis F. Powell, Jr.|Lewis Powell]] advocating a more active role in cases before [[United States Supreme Court]], the Chamber has found increasing success in litigation.  Under the [[Burger Court|Burger]] and [[Rehnquist Court]]s the Chamber was on the prevailing side 43% and 56% of the time, respectively, but under the [[Roberts Court]], the Chamber's success rate rose to 68% as of June 21, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sacks|first=Mike|title=Supreme Court: U.S. Chamber Of Commerce Undefeated This Term|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/21/supreme-court-us-chamber-of-commerce_n_1617392.html|date=21 June 2012|accessdate=12 March 2013|newspaper=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electoral activities==
In the 2008 election cycle, aggressive ads paid for by the USCC attacked a number of [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] congressional candidates (such as Minnesota's [[Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party|DFL]] Senate candidate [[Al Franken]]) and supported a number of [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] candidates including [[John E.

In addition to the expenditures from the Chamber's own funds, in 2010 its [[political action committee]] gave $29,000 (89 percent) to Republican candidates and $3,500 (11 percent) to Democratic candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.php?strID=C00082040 |title=Center for Responsive Politics, US Chamber of Commerce summary |publisher=Opensecrets.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chamber's PAC received a total of 76 donations from individual donors ($200 or more donation) totaling $79,852 in 2007-2008, or an average of $1050 per donation, and three donations per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.php?cycle=2008&amp;strID=C00082040 |title=Center for Responsive Politics, 31Oct 2009 |publisher=Opensecrets.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite more than $33 million spent supporting candidates in the 2012 Congressional races, Chamber-backed candidates lost 36 out of the 50 elections in which the Chamber participated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-04/chamber-of-commerce-33-million-lost-most-races-bgov-barometer.html | work=Bloomberg | title=Chamber of Commerce $33 Million Lost Most Races: BGOV Barometer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2013 the Chamber announced it would distribute campaign contributions in "10s" of Republican primary elections to oppose the [[Tea Party movement]] and create a "more governable Republican party."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/on-the-money/1007-other/322239-top-business-groups-vow-more-involvement-in-primaries|title=Top business groups vow more involvement in primaries|publisher=''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]''|date=September 13, 2013|first=Vicki|last=Needham|access-date=October 9, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918054229/http://thehill.com/blogs/on-the-money/1007-other/322239-top-business-groups-vow-more-involvement-in-primaries|archive-date=September 18, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2014 Tom Donohue clarified that the push would be to elect "pro-business" members of Congress "who favor trade, energy development and immigration reform".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-08/u-s-chamber-ceo-vows-to-preserve-pro-business-majority-.html |title= Big Business Doubles Down on GOP Civil War With Tea Party |last1=Wingfield |first1=Brian |last2=Bykowicz |first2=Julie |date=8 January 2014 |website=www.bloomberg.com |publisher=Bloomberg L.P. |accessdate=8 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In April 2009, the Chamber began an ad campaign against the proposed [[Employee Free Choice Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chambergrassroots.com/ |title=chambergrassroots.com |publisher=chambergrassroots.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics such as the [[National Association of Manufacturers]] have contended that additional use of card check elections will lead to overt coercion on the part of union organizers. Opponents of the Employee Free Choice Act also claim, referring to perceived lack of access to a secret ballot, that the measure would not protect employee privacy. For this reason the Chamber argued the act would reduce workers' rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bipac.net/issue_alert.asp?g=NAM&amp;issue=Card_Check&amp;parent=NAM |title=Issue Alert: CARD_CHECK |publisher=Bipac.net |date= |accessdate=2010-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009, the Chamber was reported to be seeking to spend $50,000 to hire a "respected economist" to produce a study that could be used to portray health-care legislation as a job killer and threat to the nation's economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/15/AR2009111503159.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Opponents of health-care effort look to fund a critical economic study | first=Michael D. | last=Shear | date=16 November 2009 | accessdate=26 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, activist group Velvet Revolution, under the name StopTheChamber, posted a $200,000 reward for "information leading to the arrest and conviction of Chamber of Commerce CEO Tom Donahue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/12/07/liberal-group-offers-reward-information-chamber-boss/ |title=Activist Group Puts Bounty on Chamber of Commerce CEO |newspaper= Fox News | date=2009-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some in the business community have criticized the Chamber's approach to public issues as overly aggressive. [[Hilary Rosen]], former CEO of the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], added that "Their aggressive ways are out of step with a new generation of business leadership who are looking for more cooperative relationship with Washington."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1932979,00.html | work=Time | first=Ken | last=Stier | title=Is the Chamber of Commerce Its Own Worst Enemy? | date=31 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Climate change ===
The climate campaign organization [[350.org]] estimates that 94% of US Chamber of Commerce electoral contributions went to [[Climate change denial|candidates denying the scientific consensus on climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/Global/international/publications/climate/2011/391%20-%20WhosHoldingUsBack.pdf Who's holding us back?

The Chamber's senior vice president for environment, technology, and regulatory affairs William L. Kovacs threatened to sue the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] in order to have what he termed "the [[Scopes monkey trial]] of the 21st century" on climate science before any federal climate regulation was passed in October 2009.&lt;ref name="latimes_climate"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/25/nation/na-climate-trial25|title=U.S. Chamber of Commerce seeks trial on global warming|last=Tankersley|first=Jim|date=25 August 2009|newspaper=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=13 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chamber CEO Tom Donohue disavowed the comment, but the Chamber strongly opposed the [[American Clean Energy and Security Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/19/business/energy-environment/19CHAMBER.html|title=U.S. Chamber of Commerce Split Over Donohue’s Climate Policy|last=Broder|first=John M.|date=2009-11-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-24|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this position, several companies quit the Chamber, including [[Exelon|Exelon Corp]], [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company|PG&amp;E Corp]], [[PNM Resources]], and [[Apple Inc]].&lt;ref name="reuters_climate"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0519277320091005|title=Apple, citing climate, tells U.S. Chamber iQuit|last=Gardner|first=Timothy|date=5 October 2009|newspaper=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=13 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nike, Inc]] resigned from their board of directors position, but continued their membership.

In our view, an intellectually honest argument over the best policy response to the challenges of climate change is one thing; disingenuous attempts to diminish or distort the reality of these challenges are quite another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33024888/ns/us_news-environment/t/us-chamber-commerce-climate-rift/ |title=U.S. Chamber of Commerce in climate rift |publisher=MSNBC |date=2009-09-25 |accessdate=2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to an online campaign of [[Prius]] owners organized by [[Moveon.org]], [[Toyota]] stated that it would not leave the Chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Toyota: We're staying in US chamber of commerce |first=Suzanne |last=Goldenberg |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= 26 October 2009|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/oct/26/toyota-chamber-climate-bill |accessdate=26 October 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Aspen Chamber Resort Association of [[Aspen, Colorado]] left the U.S. Chamber because of its views on climate change, in light of how climate change could hurt Aspen's winter tourism industry.&lt;ref name=aspentimes&gt;{{cite news|last=Salvail|first=Andre|title=Aspen chamber to cut ties with national organization|url=http://www.aspentimes.com/article/20120424/NEWS/120429941|accessdate=29 December 2012|newspaper=The Aspen Times|date=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, U.S. Chamber president Tom Donohue agreed to work with Senators [[John Kerry]], [[Lindsey Graham]], and [[Joe Lieberman]] as they crafted legislation to address climate change; the effort fell apart and failed to produce a bill.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/10/11/as-the-world-burns|title=As the World Burns|last=Lizza|first=Ryan|date=2010-10-03|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-03-24|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2017, Karen Harbert, CEO of the U.S. Chamber's Global Energy Institute, published an op-ed in USA Today criticizing the EPA's [[Clean Power Plan]], saying, "[t]he plan’s fundamental flaw was that it would have intentionally raised the cost of energy without regard to the impact on families and businesses." Harbert also stated, "To be clear, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce believes that the climate is changing, and that man is contributing to these changes. We also believe that technology and innovation, rather than sweeping federal mandates, offer the best approach for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the impacts of climate change."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/10/29/clean-power-plan-wrong-answer-editorials-debates/107143196/|title=Clean Power Plan was the wrong answer|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-03-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immigration reform===
The U.S. Chamber opposed President [[Donald Trump]]'s executive order ending the [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals]] program. The U.S. Chamber's Chief Policy Officer Neil Bradley said, "With approximately 700,000 DACA recipients working for all sorts of businesses across the country, terminating their employment eligibility runs contrary to the president’s goal of growing the U.S. economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/349270-business-backlash-hits-trumps-daca-decision|title=Business backlash hits Trump’s DACA decision|last=Weaver|first=Dustin|date=2017-09-05|work=TheHill|access-date=2018-03-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chamber of Commerce has come under attack by conservatives and others for its support of "amnesty" for illegal immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kasperowicz|first1=Pete|title=GOP lawmaker returns award to protest Chamber of Commerce’s immigration policy|url=http://www.theblaze.com/blog/2014/07/24/gop-lawmaker-returns-award-to-protest-chamber-of-commerces-immigration-policy/|website=The Blaze}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Connor|first1=Patrick|title=U.S. Chamber of Commerce Pushes Priorities in Congress|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-chamber-of-commerce-pushes-priorities-in-congress-1419631349|website=The Wall Street Journal|date=2014-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Tom Donohue stated the Chamber will "pull out all stops" for the passage of immigration reform in Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ho|first1=Catherine|title= U.S. Chamber to ‘pull out all stops’ to pass immigration reform |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/us-chamber-to-pull-out-all-stops-to-pass-immigration-reform/2014/01/08/ce7f899c-7883-11e3-af7f-13bf0e9965f6_story.html|website=Washington Post|accessdate=7 May 2015|date=2014-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Washington Post, Donohue did not offer specifics with regard to provisions or bills on the matter, speaking generally about the impact immigration would have on the U.S. economy.

==Opposition==
Several organizations have attacked the Chamber for its advocacy, including Chamber Watch (a campaign of [[Public Citizen]]). Advocates for independent business, like the [[American Independent Business Alliance]] (AMIBA) and "green businesses," like the American Sustainable Business Council, have fought the Chamber on multiple issues. Among major divisions between the Chamber and these business advocates is allowing corporations to engage in electioneering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amiba.net/granting-corporations-bill-of-rights-protections-is-not-pro-business/ |title=Granting Corporations Bill of Rights Protections Is Not "Pro-business |publisher=AMIBA |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oliver E. Diaz says one example of this was when the Chamber spent $1,000,000+ to fund negative campaign ads against him and have judicial candidate Keith Starrett elected instead.&lt;ref&gt;Saladoff, S.

[[File:Water table.svg|thumb|350px|Cross section showing the water table varying with surface topography as well as a perched water table]]
The '''water table''' is the upper surface of the [[Phreatic zone|zone of saturation]]. The zone of saturation is where the pores and fractures of the ground are saturated with water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://imnh.isu.edu/digitalatlas/hydr/concepts/gwater/wattable.htm|title=What is the Water Table?|website=imnh.isu.edu|access-date=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The water table is the surface where the water [[Hydraulic head|pressure head]] is equal to the [[atmospheric pressure]] (where gauge pressure = 0).  It may be visualized as the "surface" of the subsurface materials that are saturated with [[groundwater]] in a given vicinity.&lt;ref name="groundwater"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Freeze |first1=R. Allan |first2=John A. |last2=Cherry |year=1979 |title=Groundwater |location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ |publisher=Prentice-Hall |oclc=252025686}}{{page needed|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The groundwater may be from [[precipitation]] or from groundwater flowing into the aquifer. In areas with sufficient precipitation, water infiltrates through pore spaces in the soil, passing through the unsaturated zone. At increasing depths, water fills in more of the pore spaces in the soils, until a zone of saturation is reached. Below the water table, in the [[phreatic zone]] (zone of saturation), layers of permeable rock that yield groundwater are called [[aquifer|aquifers.]] In less permeable soils, such as tight bedrock formations and historic lakebed deposits, the water table may be more difficult to define.

The water table should not be confused with the [[water level]] in a deeper well. If a deeper [[aquifer]] has a lower permeable unit that confines the upward flow, then the water level in this aquifer may rise to a level that is greater or less than the elevation of the actual water table. The elevation of the water in this deeper well is dependent upon the pressure in the deeper aquifer and is referred to as the [[potentiometric surface]], not the water table.&lt;ref name="groundwater" /&gt;

== Form ==
The  water table may vary due to seasonal changes such as [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and [[evapotranspiration]]. In undeveloped regions with permeable soils that receive sufficient amounts of [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], the water table typically slopes toward rivers that act to drain the groundwater away and release the pressure in the aquifer. [[Spring (hydrology)|Spring]]s, [[River|rivers]], [[Lake|lakes]] and [[oasis|oases]] occur when the water table reaches the surface. Groundwater entering rivers and lakes accounts for the base-flow water levels in water bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/circ1139/pdf/part1bb.pdf|title=Ground Water and Surface Water A Single Resource - U.S. Geological Survey Circular 1139|last=Winter|first=Thomas C|last2=Harvey|first2=Judson W|date=1998|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surface topography ===
Within an aquifer, the water table is rarely horizontal, but reflects the surface relief due to the capillary effect&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tititudorancea.com/z/water_table_06.htm|title=Water table|website=www.tititudorancea.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[capillary fringe]]) in [[soil]]s, [[sediment]]s and other [[porous media]]. In the aquifer, groundwater flows from points of higher pressure to points of lower pressure, and the direction of groundwater flow typically has both a horizontal and a vertical component. The slope of the water table is known as the hydraulic gradient, which depends on the rate at which water is added to and removed from the aquifer and the permeability of the material. The water table does not always mimic the topography due to variations in the underlying geological structure (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;folded, faulted, fractured bedrock).

=== Perched water tables ===
A perched water table (or perched aquifer) is an aquifer that occurs above the regional water table, in the [[vadose zone]]. This occurs when there is an impermeable layer of rock or sediment ([[aquiclude]]) or relatively impermeable layer ([[aquitard]]) above the main water table/aquifer but below the land surface. If a perched aquifer's flow intersects the surface, at a valley wall, for example, the water is discharged as a [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]].

== Fluctuations ==
[[File:Water table-season fluctuation.svg|thumb|350px|Seasonal fluctuations in the water table-during the dry season, river beds may dry up.]]

=== Tidal fluctuations ===
On low-lying [[Island#Oceanic islands|oceanic islands]] with porous soil, [[freshwater]] tends to collect in [[Lens (geology)|lenticular]] pools on top of the denser [[seawater]] intruding from the sides of the islands. Such an island's freshwater lens, and thus the water table, rises and falls with the tides.

=== Seasonal fluctuations ===
In some regions, for example, [[Great Britain]] or [[California]], [[winter]] [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] is often higher than [[summer]] precipitation and so the groundwater storage is not fully recharged in summer. Consequently, the water table is lower during the summer. This disparity between the level of the winter and summer water table is known as the "zone of intermittent saturation", wherein the water table will fluctuate in response to climatic conditions.

=== Long-term fluctuations ===
[[Fossil water]] is groundwater that has remained in an aquifer for several millennia and occurs mainly in [[desert]]s. It is non-renewable by present-day [[rainfall]] due to its depth below the surface, and any extraction causes a permanent change in the water table in such regions.

==Effects on sea level==
Aquifer [[Drawdown (hydrology)|drawdown]] or [[overdrafting]] and the pumping of [[fossil water]] may be a contributing factor to sea-level rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uu.nl/EN/Current/Pages/Wereldwijdonttrekkenvangrondwaterleidttotzeespiegelstijging.aspx|title=Rising sea levels attributed to global groundwater extraction |publisher=University of Utrecht|accessdate=February 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on crop yield==
[[File: Rudd PartReg.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Yield of sugarcane versus depth of the water table, Australia. The critical depth is 0.6&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref&gt;Rudd, A.V. and C.W Chardon 1977. ''The effects of drainage on cane yields as measured by water table height in the Machnade Mill area.'' In: Proceedings of the 44th Conference of the Queensland Society of Sugar Cane Technology, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.waterlog.info/partreg.htm Software for partial regression with horizontal segment]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Most crops need a water table at a minimum depth because at shallower depths the crop suffers a yield decline.&lt;ref&gt;K.J.Lenselink et al. ''Crop tolerance to shallow water tables''. Online: [https://www.waterlog.info/cropwat.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; For some important food and fiber crops a classification was made:&lt;ref&gt;Nijland, H.J. and S. El Guindy 1984. 
''Crop yields, soil salinity and water table depth in the Nile Delta''. In: ILRI Annual Report 1983, Wageningen, The Netherlands, pp. 19–29. Online: [https://www.waterlog.info/pdf/egypt.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 Schabas was appointed the head of a UN Committee investigating the role of Israel in the [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict]]. The appointment was criticized by Canada's Foreign Minister, [[John Baird (Canadian politician)|John Baird]], and the Geneva-based advocacy NGO [[UN Watch]], which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the [[UN Watch|American Jewish Committee]] and is funded by the AJC, on the basis of allegations that Schabas was anti-Israel, a charge he denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Head-of-UNHRCs-Gaza-probe-disputes-claims-hes-anti-Israeli-370850|title=UNHRC investigator Schabas Stays Mum on Hamas as "Terror Group"|work=The Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/william-schabas-head-of-un-gaza-commission-dismisses-anti-israel-charge-1.2733740|title=William Schabas, Head of UN Gaza Commission, Dismisses Anti-Israel Charge|date=11 August 2014|publisher=Cbc.ca|quote=Under international law, William Schabas is obliged to recuse himself because his repeated calls to indict Israeli leaders obviously gives rise to actual bias or the appearance thereof}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2015 he resigned after an Israeli complaint&lt;ref name="Simons" /&gt; that he provided legal advice to the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] which is a clear [[conflict of interests]], confirming prior allegations of his alleged bias.

==Background, education, and career==
Schabas was born in Cleveland, Ohio, with strong roots in an [[Ashkenazi]] Jewish background, though his family name, which is a variation of the [[Yiddish]] word for "Sabbath" ("Shabbos" {{IPA-yi|'ʃa.bɪs|}} in Yiddish, derived from "Shabbat" {{IPAc-en|ʃ|ə|'|b|ɑː|t}} in [[Hebrew]]), has been interpreted as perhaps suggesting also a [[Sephardic]] connection.&lt;ref name="Guttman" &gt;Nathan Guttman, [http://blogs.forward.com/forward-thinking/204164/-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-un-war-crimes-co/ "8 Things You Didn't Know About The U.N. War Crimes Commission,"] ''[[The Forward]]'' 15 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Ann (née Fairley), was born in Canada and served as dean of the Faculty of Library and Information Sciences at the University of Toronto. His father, [[Ezra Schabas]], is an American-born Canadian musician and author.&lt;ref name="Guttman" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xXbFBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT372&amp;lpg=PT372&amp;dq=%22William+Schabas%22+%22Cleveland,Ohio+in1950%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fmAiRO2gbY&amp;sig=Zon3_1j3EUCrX2bOpwmbICPV6NQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nmzRVP-JA5W2yASDmoHACw&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA]&lt;/ref&gt; His maternal grandparents were [[Barker Fairley]], an English-born painter and scholar, and [[Margaret Fairley]], a writer and educator also born in England. His paternal grandparents came from [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]],&lt;ref name="Guttman" /&gt; and relatives on his father's side died in the Holocaust.&lt;ref name="Simons"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/12/world/former-head-of-inquiry-into-gaza-war-says-he-faced-pressure-and-threats.html "Former Head of Inquiry Into Gaza War Says He Faced Pressure and Threats"], by Marlise Simons, ''New York Times'', FEB. 11, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Schabas moved with his family to Toronto in 1952 and received his B.A. and M.A. degrees in history from the [[University of Toronto]], and LL.B., LL.M. and LL.D. degrees from the [[Université de Montréal]]. He has also been awarded honorary doctorates by [[Dalhousie University]], [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[Case Western Reserve University]], [[Cleveland]] and [[Northwestern University]], [[Chicago]].

According to [[UN Watch]], when Schabas was a Ph.D. student in history at the University of Toronto in 1974, and a leader in the radical SDS group, he was the subject of a university investigation for allegedly violating human rights and freedoms by physically obstructing a visiting Harvard professor from speaking on campus. Schabas was suspended from the university for four years, later reduced to two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.unwatch.org/index.php/2014/09/12/when-william-schabas-was-convicted-in-1974-he-tried-to-disqualify-the-judges-for-bias/|title=When William Schabas was convicted in 1974, he tried to disqualify the judges for bias|publisher=UN Watch|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/cautbulletin23_1/cautbulletin23_1_djvu.txt|title=Full text of ''CAUT Bulletin'' September 1974 (Volume 23, Number 1)"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1991 to 2000 he was a professor of human rights law and criminal law at the [[Université du Québec à Montréal]] (UQÀM), and he chaired the Department of Legal Studies from 1994 to 1998. He has taught as a visiting or adjunct professor at several other institutions, including McGill University, Queen's University Belfast, LUISS University in Rome, Cardoza Law School, Panthéon-Assas University and the National University of Rwanda.

Schabas moved to Ireland in 2000, serving as the director of the Irish Centre for Human Rights at the National University of Ireland, Galway, until 2011. That year he moved to London to take up a chair in international law at Middlesex University, London. He is the recipient of the Vespasian V. Pellat Medal for International Criminal Justice of the Association international de droit penal and the Gold Medal in the Social Sciences of the Royal Irish Academy. Schabas was called to the Quebec bar in 1985 and practised law in Montreal for many years. He has also practised at the international level, appearing before the [[International Court of Justice]], the Grand Chamber of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] and the [[International Criminal Court]]. Schabas was invited by the [[Special Court for Sierra Leone]] to serve as an ''[[amicus curiae]]''.

Schabas has participated on several human rights fact-finding missions on behalf of international non-governmental organisations, such as [[Amnesty International]] and the [[International Federation of Human Rights]], to such countries as [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]], [[Sudan]], [[South Africa]] and [[Russia]]. The 1993 mission to Rwanda, of which he was a member, alerted the international community to the danger of [[genocide]] in that country.

In 2011, Schabas attended a conference in [[Iran]] with the [[Tehran]]-based [[Non-Aligned Movement]] [[Center for Human Rights and Cultural Diversity]] where he was a keynote speaker. It was reported that the center has close ties with former Iranian president President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/iranian-human-rights-wrong-board-north-korea-cuba-article-1.979942|title=An Iranian 'human rights' wrong |work=NY Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the conference together with US film producer Sandra Schulberg in order to present a documentary film about the Nuremberg Trial to Iranians, which was welcomed by the audience, and spoke to them about the Holocaust and Nazi atrocities.&lt;ref name="NAMCHRCD" &gt;Non-aligned Movement Center for Human Rights and Cultural Diversity, [http://namiran.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/NAM-Center-for-Human-Rights-and-Cultural-Diversity.Annual-Report-2011.pdf ' Non-aligned Movement Center for Human Rights and Cultural Diversity Annual Report 2011,'][[Namiran]] February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Schabas states that he went as an academic, and is opposed to academic boycotts of Israel and Iran.&lt;ref name=CBC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/william-schabas-head-of-un-gaza-commission-dismisses-anti-israel-charge-1.2733740|title=William Schabas, head of UN Gaza commission, dismisses anti-Israel charge|date=11 August 2014|publisher=Cbc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal and political position==
===Overview===
An interview with Schabas in the journal ''[[Intellectum]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intellectum.org/articles/issues/intellectum7/en/Int%27l%20Protection%20of%20Human%20Rights%20and%20Politics_English%20co-edited%20WS%20&amp;%20VT3.pdf|format=PDF|title=Interview with Professor William Schabas_International Protection of Human Rights and Politics: an Inescapable Reality|publisher=Intellectum.org|date=2010|pages=46–61|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers a concise overview of his opinions on Israeli operations in Gaza, the Goldstone Report, racism in Europe, the death penalty, genocide, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in Sierra Leone, the International Criminal Court and its arrest warrant for President Omar Hassan Ahmad al-Bashir of Sudan, and international criminal law in general.

===Death penalty===
Schabas has been very active in the movement for [[Capital punishment|worldwide abolition of capital punishment]]. His book ''The Abolition of the Death Penalty in International Law'' &lt;ref&gt;William Schabas,[https://books.google.com/books?id=LGuT_DP4_eMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq  ''The Abolition of the Death Penalty in International Law''], [[Cambridge University Press]] (1993) 3RD.EDITION, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and his other writings on the subject have been referred to in judgments by national and international tribunals, including the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, the United States Supreme Court, the Supreme Court of Canada and the Supreme Court of the Philippines. Schabas regularly lectures on capital punishment in China and the United States. In 2009 he was a consultant to the United Nations responsible for preparing the Secretary General's five-yearly report on the status of capital punishment. Schabas is the Chair of the Scientific Advisory Board of the International Academic Network Against the Death Penalty and for a Universal Moratorium on Capital Punishment, and Advisor to the International Centre for Death Penalty Research at [[Beijing Normal University]].

===Genocide===
For Schabas, the definition of what constituted the crime of genocide historically, unlike other laws governing international crimes, did not change for nearly 5 decades after its original formulation, though scholars beyond the legal discipline were critical of narrowness of the definition. Reviewing the evolving legal debate, Schabas notes a tendency to merge the notion of genocide with the related concept of [[crimes against humanity]]. In his own view, these should be kept distinct, with the former restricted to the definition originally framed in the Geneva Conventions, while the latter is sufficiently broad to prosecute all other cases of mass murder in ethnic and religious conflicts.&lt;ref name="FowlerSchabas" &gt;William Schabas, [http://www.ushmm.org/confront-genocide/speakers-and-events/all-speakers-and-events/genocide-in-international-law-a-discussion-with-william-schabas "Genocide in International Law: A Discussion with William Schabas,"] [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] 4 March 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schabas argues that the legal term "genocide" is a loaded one that should not be used to describe every atrocity involving mass killings. He argues that, in the strict legal sense, the only true "genocides" in recent history were the [[Armenian Genocide]], the [[Jewish]] and [[Romani people|Gypsy]] [[Holocaust]], and the [[Rwandan Genocide]]. In his book ''Genocide in International Law: The Crime of Crimes'' (Cambridge University Press, 2nd ed., 2009) he supports the view that Stalin's atrocities in the Ukraine, the killings of [[Slav]] and Soviet citizens under the Nazi occupation, and the [[Holodomor]] were not, legally, genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Genocide-International-Law-Crimes/dp/0521787904/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1242453917&amp;sr=1-5|title=Genocide in International Law: The Crime of Crimes|last=Schabas|first=William|accessdate=16 May 2009|date=18 September 2000|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0-521-78790-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been criticized for denying the internationally recognized [[Srebrenica Genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bosniakandjewishfriendship.wordpress.com/2014/08/14/who-is-prof-william-schabas-genocide-denier-heads-gaza-probe/|title=Who is Prof. William Schabas? Genocide Denier Heads Gaza Probe|work=Bosniak &amp; Jewish Solidarity|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book he summarizes the legal opinions regarding the status of the atrocities committed in Bosnia, deeming them [[ethnic cleansing]] and not [[genocide]], stating that "Ethnic cleansing is also a warning sign of genocide to come. Genocide is the last resort of the frustrated ethnic cleanser."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Genocide-International-Law-Crimes/dp/0521787904/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1242453917&amp;sr=1-5|title=Genocide in International Law: The Crime of Crimes|pages=175–200, 201|last=Schabas|first=William|accessdate=16 May 2009|date=18 September 2000|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0-521-78790-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schabas also criticises the [[United Nations General Assembly]] for recognising ethnic cleansing as genocide.

In March 1993, Schabas co-authored the ''Report of the Commission of Inquiry into Human Rights Violations in Rwanda''.&lt;ref name="mdx.ac.uk"/&gt;

In a later book, ''War Crimes and Human Rights'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008), Schabas states that the killings by the [[Khmer Rouge]] in Cambodia during the late 1970s lacked "the ethnic dimension that is part of the essence of the crime [of genocide]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/War-Crimes-Human-Rights-Accountability/dp/1905017634/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1242454139&amp;sr=1-7|title=War Crimes and Human Rights|page=766|last=Schabas|first=William|accessdate=16 May 2009|date=31 March 2008|publisher=Cameron May|isbn=1-905017-63-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schabas took the same position in 2001 in his article "Cambodia: Was it Really Genocide?"&lt;ref&gt;William Schabas, "Cambodia: Was It Really Genocide?", ''Human Rights Quarterly'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Further, while he strongly condemns the atrocities in [[Darfur]] in ''War Crimes and Human Rights'', Schabas says that they should not be labelled genocide because "the summary execution" of non-Arabs in Darfur "does not establish genocidal intent." In ''War Crimes and Human Rights'' he also criticises the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia for finding a joint criminal enterprise to commit genocide in [[Srebrenica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/War-Crimes-Human-Rights-Accountability/dp/1905017634/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1242454139&amp;sr=1-7|title=War Crimes and Human Rights|page=751|last=Schabas|first=William|accessdate=16 May 2009|date=31 March 2008|publisher=Cameron May|isbn=1-905017-63-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle East conflict===
====Statements====
In 2011, the same year Schabas attended the Center for Human Rights and Cultural Diversity conference in [[Iran]] in Tehran, he said in a speech that he believes Israeli prime minister [[Benyamin Netanyahu]] should be "in the dock of an international court." He also wrote in a law journal article that the Israeli prime minister could be regarded as "the single individual most likely to threaten the survival of Israel."&lt;ref name=CBC /&gt;

In 2012, in regard to the Iranian nuclear program, Shabas wrote that Iran "very arguably has a claim to require [[nuclear weapons]] for defensive purposes".&lt;ref name="Cotler"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/The-fatal-flaws-of-the-Schabas-Inquiry-375139|title=The fatal flaws of the Schabas Inquiry|work=The Jerusalem Post|author=Irwin Cotler}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding [[Hamas]], Shabas said "If we look at the poor people of Gaza ... all they want is a state – and they get punished for insisting upon this, and for supporting a political party in their own determination and their own assessment that seems to be representing that aspiration."&lt;ref name="Cotler" /&gt;

During his speech at the [[Russell Tribunal]] in 2013, Schabas said that it is his "profound belief, the international law can be used to demonstrate and underscore the violations committed by the state of Israel, and moreover can be used to hold accountable individuals who have perpetrated international crimes against the people of Palestine." Asked about various possible tools for prosecuting Israel, Schabas said: "I would have been inclined to talk about crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression, all of which I think can be shown have been perpetrated at various times during the history of the state of Israel. These are all crimes that have become increasingly robust in their definition in recent decades and for which we now have international institutions capable of prosecuting the crimes ... With a bit of luck and by twisting things and maneuvering we can get them before the courts"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/184018#.U-ujNfmSzO8|title=Schabas: 'Twist Things' to Get Israel in the Dock |work=Arutz Sheva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schabas has accused Israel of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and aggression committed "on the territory of Palestine since 2002", while acknowledging that "much of [his] effort" is focused on bringing about the prosecution of Israelis at the ICC.&lt;ref name="Cotler" /&gt;

====2014 UN Gaza inquiry====
The United Nations Human Rights Council adopted a resolution on 23 July 2014 calling on establishment of a commission of inquiry to investigate all alleged violations of international humanitarian laws carried out by Israel during the [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/SpecialSessions/Session21/Pages/21stSpecialSession.aspx|title=21st Special Session of the Human Rights Council on the Human Rights Situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Including East Jerusalem - 23 July 2014|publisher=Ohchr.org|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schabas was appointed the head of a three-member commission, together with [[Amal Clooney]] (Lebanon) who declined the nomination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Head-of-UNHRCs-Gaza-probe-disputes-claims-hes-anti-Israeli-370850|title=UNHRC Investigator Schabas Stays Mum on Hamas as 'Terror Group'|work=The Jerusalem Post|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Doudou Diène]] (Senegal). US judge [[McGowan Davis]] joined the committee as 3rd member.

Schabas's appointment was criticized by Canada's Foreign Minister, [[John Baird (Canadian politician)|John Baird]], and the Geneva-based advocacy NGO [[UN Watch]].&lt;ref name="cbc"/&gt; They noted that Schabas, remarking on what he sees as the political bias in the choice of cases to prosecute made by the International Criminal Court, had asked: "Why are we going after the President of Sudan for Darfur and not the President of Israel for Gaza?"&lt;ref name="Interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intellectum.org/articles/issues/intellectum7/en/Int'l%20Protection%20of%20Human%20Rights%20and%20Politics_English%20co-edited%20WS%20&amp;%20VT3.pdf|format=PDF|title=International Protection of Human Rights and Politics: An Inescapable Reality: Interview with Professor William Schabas|publisher=Intellectum.org|accessdate=20 December 2014}}:'I believe that pretending the prosecution of Sudan is not political is a mistake too. Of course it is political. Why are we going after the president of Sudan for Darfur and not the president of Israel for Gaza? Because of politics.'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Benhorin" &gt;Yitzhak Benhorin, [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4557779,00.html 'Head of UN Gaza inquiry commission called to try Netanyahu at ICC,'][[Ynet]] 12 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.unwatch.org/index.php/2014/08/11/ngo-william-schabas-must-recuse-himself-from-un-gaza-inquiry/|title=NGO: William Schabas Must Recuse Himself from UN Gaza Inquiry|publisher=UN Watch|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schabas dismissed Baird's accusation as absurd, noting that he, Schabas, was on the editorial board of the ''[[Israel Law Review]]''. In reply to UN Watch's demand he recuse himself on the grounds that he had once criticized Binjamin Netanyahu, Schabas countered:'"Like everybody inside and outside Israel, I disagree with people. Is everyone in Israel who has an opinion about (Benjamin) Netanyahu anti-Israel?".'&lt;ref name="cbc"/&gt;

Schabas said at the time that there was some merit in comments by critics that Israel was being singled out by the UN for human rights violations, but added that double standards and bias in the UN works both ways, at times to Israel's advantage, citing the fact that the United States almost invariably vetoes resolutions critical of Israel in the [[Security Council]]. In short, he concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let's just say that it's a plausible complaint that maybe Israel has gotten a lot of attention at the Human Rights Council but at the same time it has perhaps had a lot of inattention at the Security Council, so the double standards work in both directions for Israel.&lt;ref name="Guttman" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Israeli government condemned the appointment of Schabas, and Israel's Ambassador to the UN, [[Ron Prosor]], said in an interview "Forming an investigatory committee headed by Schabas is like inviting ISIS to organize religious tolerance week at the UN."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Known-Israel-critic-to-lead-UNHRC-Gaza-probe-370926|title=Prosor: Having Schabas Lead UN Gaza Probe Akin to ISIS Hosting Religious Tolerance Event|work=The Jerusalem Post - JPost.com|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schabas replied that he does not hate Israel and that he will put his prior positions aside, adding: "Even if Spiderman was heading the probe, they [Israel] would've attacked him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Breaking-News/I-dont-hate-Israel-head-of-UN-panel-probing-Gaza-operation-says-374919|title='I Don't Hate Israel,' Head of UN Panel Probing Gaza Operation Says|work=The Jerusalem Post|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015 Schabas resigned after an Israeli complaint&lt;ref name="Simons"/&gt; that he had billed the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] for $US1,300 in 2012 for legal advice he gave them at their request, a precedent which might constitute evidence of a [[conflict of interest]] with his position as head of the investigative committee.&lt;ref&gt;Yonah Jeremy Bob,[http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Analysis-Schabas-resignation-may-save-Israelis-at-ICC-389932 "Schabas resignation may save Israelis at ICC,"] ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', 4 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that he did not want the controversy to overshadow the work of the Gaza inquiry. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on the UNHRC to shelve its report: "After the resignation of the committee chairman, who was biased against Israel, the report must not be published".&lt;ref name="jpost150204"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Analysis-The-indelible-stain-on-the-UN-committee-once-chaired-by-William-Schabas-389928|title=The indelible stain on the UN committee once chaired by William Schabas|last=[[Herb Keinon]]|first=|date=2015-02-04|publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|quote=The man hailed by defenders as a world-class jurist didn't think that having been paid to provide a legal briefing for the PLO might constitute a conflict of interest preventing him from involvement in this commission.

As far as Israel is concerned, the fate of anyone who criticizes the country is sealed. He's an anti-Semite, anti-Israeli, greedy or driven by ulterior motives."&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with the BBC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC HARDtalk - William Schabas - Head of UN HRCC of Inquiry into Events in Gaza in 2014 (7/7/15)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7JcJe95VF4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schabas admitted that "there is a distortion in the amount of attention given against Israel, and the number of resolutions directed against Israel" but defended the claim by saying Israel gets a "soft ride in the Security Council hearings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Schabas: There is a distortion in the attention given against Israel in the UNHRC|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Schabas-There-is-a-distortion-in-the-attention-given-against-Israel-in-the-UNHRC-408504|publisher=[[JPost]]|date=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Worshipful Company of Plaisterers''' is one of the [[Livery company|livery companies]] in the [[City of London]]. The Plaisterers' Company was incorporated under a [[Royal Charter]] in 1501 and whilst the spelling used in the charter was "Plaisterer", some later charters used the alternative spelling of "plasterer", nonetheless, the company uses the original spelling.

The company's first hall was bequeathed by William Elder, [[Citizen]] and Plaisterer in 1556. It was situated on the corner of [[Gropecunt Lane|Addle Street]] and Philip Lane but was destroyed in the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666. Its second hall was built in 1669 to the design of [[Sir]] [[Christopher Wren]], although this too met the same sad fate by being destroyed by fire in 1882.

The company originated as a trade association of [[London]]'s [[plasterer]]s. Today, it maintains a connection with the trade by establishing plastering standards and by officially accrediting plasterers. The company is also a charitable and educational institution.

The Plaisterers' Company ranks forty-sixth in the [[order of precedence]] of the City livery companies. Its motto is ''Let Brotherly Love Continue''.

Its hall, opened in November 1972, has décor throughout of the neo-classical style created by [[Robert Adam]] in the 18th century. His various designs have been faithfully reproduced in great detail both on plaster and wood, some being taken from his original moulds. Plaisterers' Hall is the largest and one of the finest City [[livery hall]]s in [[London]].

With roots in the early [[youth activism]] of the [[Newsboys Strike of 1899|Newsboys]] and [[Mary Harris Jones|Mother Jones]]' [[child labor]] protests at the turn of the 20th century, youth politics were first identified in American politics with the formation of the [[American Youth Congress]] in the 1930s. In the 1950s and 1960s organizations such as the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] and [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] were closely associated with youth politics, despite the broad social statements of documents including the [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[Port Huron Statement]] and the [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Sharon Statement]] and leaders such as [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]]. Other late-period figures associated with youth politics include [[Tom Hayden]], [[Marian Wright Edelman]] and [[Bill Clinton]].{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2016}}

{{cquote|Our answer is the world's hope; it is to rely on youth. The cruelties and obstacles of this swiftly changing planet will not yield to obsolete dogmas and outworn slogans. It cannot be moved by those who cling to a present which is already dying, who prefer the illusion of security to the excitement of danger. It demands the qualities of youth: not a time of life but a state of mind, a temper of the will, a quality of the imagination, a predominance of courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure over the love of ease. - ''[[Robert F. Kennedy]], South Africa, 6-6-1966''}}

===India===
Within India, few organizations exist that engage with youth and politics, besides the youth wings of political parties. Recently [[Young India Foundation]] has been working on a campaign to increase young people in politics by helping them win elections and decrease the age of candidacy in India of MPs/MLAs from 25 to better reflect the large young demographic of India called India's Age of Candidacy&lt;ref&gt;[https://ageofcandidacy.in]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shantanu Gupta's famous [[TEDx]] talk, on Youth, Politics and Change is very popular among young political aspirants. In his talk Shantanu explains various feeder lines to politics in Indian context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Silchar|first=TEDx|title=TEDx NIT Silchar - Theme: Instruments of Change|url=https://www.ted.com/tedx/events/20166|newspaper=TEDx|date=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Silchar|first=TEDx|title=TEDx NIT Silchar - Theme: Instruments of Change|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH9r4GMFnN4|newspaper=TEDx|date=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
Youth politics have an extensive history in Europe, as well. [[Free German Youth]] was founded in 1936 as a [[communist]] alternative to the [[Nazi Youth]] movement.

In the UK there is a strong youth politics movement, consisting primarily of the [[British Youth Council]], the [[UK Youth Parliament]] and the [[Scottish Youth Parliament]]. Although they have no direct power, the young people in these organisations have a close working relationship with Members of Parliament and are fairly influential, albeit ineffectual at bringing about direct change or tangible objectives. Many organisations that strive for youth movement are on the rise. A notable organisation is YouthDebates, an online organisation aiming to engage young people into the world of politics.

===Globally===
Other continents have experienced a variety of youth politics and political movements.
France:
In the recent Mexico’s presidential election another manifestation of how the youth take the politics in the actual world were see, the students movement called “[[Yo Soy 132|Yo soy 132]]” made a very notable change in how the elections developed, showing proofs of the electoral fraud they thought will happen, they changed the percentage of acceptation of the PRI candidate, Enrique Peña Nieto and they achieved to decrease it around 12 percentage points between the highest poll results for the candidate and the final results of the elections.

==Present==
Between the influence of [[mainstream media]] and [[politicians]], youth politics in the United States has been illegitimated and deprioritized{{Fact|date=March 2008}}. Organizations such as [[National Youth Rights Association]] and [[The Freechild Project]] continue to advocate and educate for issues that affect young people specifically, while other organizations, including [[Youth Service America]] and [[Advocates for Youth]] work for issues that affect youth directly. The [[children's rights movement]] is widely credited with keeping youth politics on the national radar{{Fact|date=April 2007}}, while other fledgling movements such as [[youth voice]] and [[youth participation]] have yet to gain the spotlight{{Fact|date=April 2007}}.Even with the efforts of these organizations, many college students do not see politics as an important part of their lives.  Only 33% of college freshman think being knowledgeable about politics to be important.&lt;ref&gt;Pryor, J.H., Hurtado, S., DeAngelo, L., Palucki Blake, L., &amp; Tran, S. (2009). The American freshman: National norms fall 2009. Los Angeles: Higher Education Research Institute, UCLA.&lt;/ref&gt; Data collected in by the National Center for Education Statistics found that overall young Americans care more about entertainment and sports than political and foreign news.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, Kathryn. "Students Interest in National News and Its Relation to School Courses." National Center for Education Statistics (1997): 1-2. National Center for Education Statistics. U.S Department of Education, July 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these statistics there is a positive outlook on youth involvement in the future because of the 2008 election when President Barack Obama ran.

{{POV check|date=August 2016}}
A '''zero-tolerance''' policy is one which imposes strict punishment for infractions of a stated rule, with the intention of eliminating undesirable conduct.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;''zero tolerance, n.'' (under ''zero, n.''). The Oxford English Dictionary, Second Edition 1989. Retrieved 10 November 2009 from oed.com website. [http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50291099/50291099se51]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="American Heritage"&gt;zero tolerance. (n.d.). The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. Retrieved 10 November 2009, from Dictionary.com website. [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/zero%20tolerance]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zero Tolerance - Cambridge English Dictionary|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/zero-tolerance|website=Cambridge Dictionaries Online|publisher=Cambridge University|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zero-tolerance policies forbid persons in positions of authority from exercising [[discretion]] or changing punishments to fit the circumstances subjectively; they are required to impose a pre-determined punishment regardless of individual [[culpability]], extenuating circumstances, or history. This pre-determined punishment, whether mild or severe, is always meted out.

Zero-tolerance policies are studied in [[criminology]] and are common in formal and informal policing systems around the world. The policies also appear in informal situations where there may be [[sexual harassment]] or [[Internet]] misuse in educational and workplace environments. In 2014, the [[mass incarceration]] in the United States based upon minor offenses has resulted in an outcry on the use of [[Zero tolerance (schools)|zero tolerance in schools]] and communities.&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Moshe, L., Chapman, C. &amp; Carey, A.C. (2014). ''Disability Incarcerated: Imprisonment and Disability in the United States and Canada''. NY, NY: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ervelles, N. (2014). Crippin' Jim Crow: Disability, Dis-location, and the School to Prison Pipeline. In: Carey, A., Ben-Moshe, L., &amp; Chapman, C., ''Disability Incarcerated: Imprisonment and Disability in the United States and Canada''. NY, NY: Palgrave MacMillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

Little evidence supports the claimed effectiveness of zero-tolerance policies.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe and Bendersky, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; One underlying problem is that there are a great many reasons why people hesitate to intervene, or to report behavior they find to be unacceptable or unlawful. Zero-tolerance policies address, at best, only a few of these reasons.&lt;ref&gt;"Dealing with—or Reporting—"Unacceptable" Behavior - with additional thoughts about the Bystander Effect" © 2009 Mary Rowe MIT, Linda Wilcox HMS, Howard Gadlin NIH, JIOA, vol 2, no 1, p52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
According to the ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]'', the first recorded use of the term "zero tolerance" was in 1972. It was originally used in [[politics]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=ero+tolerance&amp;searchmode=none|title= Zero Tolerance|publisher= Online Etymology DIctionary|accessdate=2012-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An earlier use of the term came in the mid-1960s, in reference to an absolute ban of the pesticide [[heptachlor]] by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]]; for example, in an article that appeared in the June 1963 issue of Popular Mechanics, it is stated that "Heptachlor, though, is even more toxic and has been given a 'zero tolerance' by the FDA; that is, not even the slightest trace of heptachlor is permitted on food."&lt;ref&gt;Clifford B. Hicks, [https://books.google.com/books?id=D-MDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=%22zero+tolerance%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwCDgeahUKEwiktZqc95LIAhXHrD4KHV4RDc8#v=onepage&amp;q=%22zero%20tolerance%22&amp;f=false "And Was It a Silent Spring?"], ''Popular Mechanics'', June 1963, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The idea behind zero-tolerance policies can be traced back to the ''[[Safe and Clean Neighborhoods Act]]'', approved in [[New Jersey]] in 1973,&lt;ref name="Tonello07"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WilsonKelling82"/&gt; which has the same underlying assumptions.&lt;ref name="Tonello07"&gt;Tonello (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wacquant99"&gt;Wacquant, Loïc (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marshall99p2"&gt;Marshall 1999, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; The ideas behind the 1973 New Jersey policy were later popularized in 1982, when a US cultural magazine, ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', published an article by [[James Q. Wilson]] and [[George L. Kelling]] about the [[broken windows theory]] of crime.&lt;ref name="WilsonKelling82"&gt;Wilson and Kelling (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; Their name for the idea comes from the following example:

{{quote|Consider a building with a few broken [[window]]s. If the windows are not repaired, the tendency is for [[vandalism|vandals]] to break a few more windows. Eventually, they may even break into the building, and if it's unoccupied, perhaps become [[squatter]]s or light fires inside.

Or consider a [[sidewalk]]. Some [[litter]] accumulates. Soon, more litter accumulates. Eventually, people even start leaving bags of trash from take-out restaurants.}}

According to scholars, zero tolerance is the concept of giving ''carte blanche'' to the [[police]] for the inflexible repression of minor offenses, [[homeless]] people, and the disorders associated with them.&lt;ref name="Wacquant99"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marshall99p2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KellingOnHomeless"&gt;"anti-social behaviours associated with the homeless" as in Kelling's own terminology&lt;/ref&gt; A well-known criticism to this approach is that it redefines social problems in terms of security,&lt;ref&gt;Wacquant, Loïc (1999): "une comparaison méthodique montrerait tout de suite que la prétendue « montée inexorable » des « violences urbaines » est avant tout une thématique politico-médiatique visant à faciliter la redéfinition des problèmes sociaux en termes de sécurité", eng: "A comparison would show immediately that the so-called "inexorable rise" of the "urban violence" is first and foremost a political-media theme aimed at facilitating the redefinition of social problems in terms of security"&lt;/ref&gt; it considers the poor as criminals, and it reduces crimes to only "street crimes", those committed by lower social classes, excluding [[white-collar crime]]s.&lt;ref name="Wacquant02"&gt;Wacquant, Loïc (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

On the historical examples of the application of ''zero tolerance'' kind of policies, nearly all the scientific studies conclude that it didn't play a leading role in the reduction of crimes, a role which is claimed by its advocates. On the other hand, large majorities of people who are living in communities in which zero tolerance policing has been followed believe that in fact it has played a key, leading role in reducing crime in their communities.&lt;ref name="Wacquant02"/&gt; It has been alleged that in New York City, the decline of crimes rate started well before [[Rudy Giuliani]] came to power in 1993, and none of the decreasing processes had particular inflection under him.&lt;ref name="Wacquant02"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fagan ''et al.'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; and that in the same period, the decrease in crime was the same in the other major US cities, even those with an opposite security policy. But the experience of the vast majority of New Yorkers led them to precisely the opposite conclusion and allowed a Republican to win and retain the Mayor's office for the first time in decades in large part because of the perception that zero tolerance policing was key to the improving crime situation in New York City. On the other hand, some argue that in the years 1984-7 New York already experienced a policy similar to Giuliani's one, but it faced a crime increase instead.&lt;ref name="Wacquant02"/&gt;

Two American specialists, Edward Maguire, a Professor at American University, and John Eck from the University of Cincinnati, rigorously evaluated all the scientific work designed to test the effectiveness of the police in the fight against crime. They concluded that "neither the number of policemen engaged in the battle, or internal changes and organizational culture of law enforcement agencies (such as the introduction of [[community policing]]) have by themselves any impact on the evolution of offenses."&lt;ref name="Wacquant02"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eck and Maguire (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that crime decrease was due not to the work of the police and judiciary, but to economic and demographic factors. The main ones were an unprecedented economic growth with jobs for millions of young people, and a shift from the use of crack towards other drugs.&lt;ref name="Wacquant02"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowling (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative argument comes from Kelling and [[William Bratton]], Giuliani's original police chief, who argue that broken windows policing methods did contribute to the decrease in crime, but that they were not a form of zero tolerance:
{{quote|Critics use the term “zero tolerance” in a pejorative sense to suggest that Broken Windows policing is a form of zealotry—the imposition of rigid, moralistic standards of behavior on diverse populations. It is not. Broken Windows is a highly discretionary police activity that requires careful training, guidelines, and supervision, as well as an ongoing dialogue with neighborhoods and communities to ensure that it is properly conducted&lt;ref name="brattonkelling"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.city-journal.org/html/why-we-need-broken-windows-policing-13696.html|title=Why we need Broken Windows policing|publisher=City Journal|author=William Bratton, George Kelling|date=December 2014|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Sheldon Wein has set out a list of six characteristics of a zero tolerance policy:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wein|first1=Sheldon|title=Exploring  the  virtues  (and  vices)  of  zero  tolerance  arguments|url=http://scholar.uwindsor.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2141&amp;context=ossaarchive|publisher=University of Windsor|accessdate=1 October 2017|date=2014}}, Proceedings of the 2013 OSSA Conference (edited by Dima Mohammed and Marcin Lewiński), Centre for Research on Reasoning, Argumentation, and Rhetoric (CRRAR) publishing, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Full enforcement (all those for whom there is adequate evidence that they have violated the rule are to be identified)
#Lack of prosecutorial discretion (for every plausibly accused person, it is determined whether the person has in fact violated the policy)
#Strict constructivist interpretation (no room for narrow interpretation of the rule)
#Strict liability (no excuses or justifications)
#Mandatory punishment (not under a mandatory minimum penalty)
#Harsh punishment (mandatory minimum penalty is considered relatively harsh given the nature of the offence).
Wein sees these points as representing "focal meaning" of the concept, namely, that not each one need be met literally, yet that any policy that clearly meets all six of these conditions would definitely be seen as a case of a zero tolerance policy.

==Applications==

===Bullying in the workplace===
{{See also|Harassment|Workplace bullying}}
Various institutions have undertaken zero-tolerance policies, for example, in the military, in the workplace, and in schools, in an effort to eliminate various kinds of illegal behavior, such as harassment. Proponents hope that such policies will underscore the commitment of administrators to prevent such behavior. Others raise a concern about this use of zero-tolerance policies, a concern which derives from analysis of errors of omission versus errors of commission. Here is the reasoning: Failure to proscribe unacceptable behavior may lead to errors of omission—too little will be done. But zero tolerance may be seen as a kind of ruthless management, which may lead to a perception of "too much being done". If people fear that their co-workers or fellow students may be fired, terminated, or expelled, they may not come forward at all when they see behavior deemed unacceptable. (This is a classic example of [[Type I and type II errors]].) The Type Two error, where it occurs with respect to zero tolerance, leads to the situation where too stringent a policy may actually reduce reports of illegal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;"Workplace Justice, Zero Tolerance and Zero Barriers: Getting People to Come Forward in Conflict Management Systems," with Corinne Bendersky, in Negotiations and Change, From the Workplace to Society, Thomas Kochan and Richard Locke (editors), Cornell University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, zero tolerance, as an approach against drugs, was originally designed as a part of the [[War on Drugs]] under [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H.W. Bush]], ostensibly to curb the transfer of drugs at US borders. Law-enforcement was to target the drug users rather than the transporters or suppliers under the assumptions that harsh sentences and strict enforcement of personal use would reduce demand and, therefore, strike at root cause of the drug problem. The policy did not require additional laws; instead existing law was enacted with less leniency.&lt;ref name=ztd&gt;See zero tolerance in {{cite book|last1=Carson-Dewitt|first1=Rosalyn|title=Drugs, Alcohol and Tobacco: Learning about the Addictive Behavior; Volume 1, 2, and 3|date=2002|publisher=Macmillan Reference Library|isbn=002865756X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JVjFMgEACAAJ|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar concepts in other countries, such as [[Sweden]],&lt;ref name="UNrep"&gt;[[UNODC]]: [http://www.unodc.org/pdf/research/Swedish_drug_control.pdf Sweden's successful drug policy, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Italy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/italy-signs-up-to-zerotolerance-drugs-crackdown-594851.html |title=Italy signs up to zero-tolerance drugs crackdown |accessdate=2009-03-18 |author=Peter Popham |date=2003-04-18 |work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Japan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/announce/speech/un2005/un0510-15.html |title=Statement to the UN general assembly by Mr. Makoto Hashizume, Delegation of Japan, on Agenda Item 106: Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice and Agenda Item 107: International Drug Control |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Japan |date=2005-10-07 |accessdate=2009-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Singapore]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSSIN291423 |title=Singapore drug cases jump 42 pct on Subutex abuse |date=2007-01-23 |accessdate=2010-05-20 |author1=Jamie Lee |author2=Geert De Clercq |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[China]], [[India]], and [[Russia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/europeCrisis/idUSL9658002 |title=Drug policy groups decry fresh UN anti-drug strategy |accessdate=2009-03-18 |author=Luke Baker |date=2009-03-10 |work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; have since been labeled zero tolerance.

A consistence of zero tolerance is the absolute dichotomy between the legality of any use and no use, equating all illicit drugs and any form of use as undesirable and harmful to society. This is contrasting to viewpoints of those who stress the [[drug harmfulness|disparity in harmfulness among drugs]], and would like to distinguish between occasional drug use and problem drug use. Although some [[harm reduction]]ists also see drug use as generally undesirable, they hold that the resources would do more good if they were allocated toward helping problem drug users instead of combating all drug users.&lt;ref name=ztd /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ming-sum Tsui [http://isw.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/43/2/243 "The harm reduction approach revisited: An international perspective"] ''International Social Work'' 2000, vol 43, page 243&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, research findings from [[Switzerland]] indicate that emphasis on problem drug users "seems to have contributed to the image of heroin as unattractive for young people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nordt|first1=Carlos|last2=Stohler|first2=Rudolph|title=Incidence of heroin use in Zurich, Switzerland: a treatment case register analysis|journal=The Lancet|date=3 June 2006|volume=367|issue=9525|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(06)68804-1/fulltext|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(06)68804-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a more general level, zero-tolerance advocates holds the aim at ridding the society of all illicit drug use and that [[criminal justice]] has an important role in that endeavor.&lt;ref name=ztd /&gt; The Swedish parliament for example set the vision ''a drug-free society'' as the official goal for the [[drug policy of Sweden|drug policy]] in 1978. These visions were to prompt new practices inspired by [[Nils Bejerot]], practices later labeled as Zero tolerance. In 1980 the Swedish attorney general finally dropped the practice of giving waivers for possession of drugs for personal use after years of lowering the thresholds. The same year, police began to prioritize drug users and street-level drug crimes over drug distributors. In 1988 all non medicinally prescribed usage became illegal and in 1993 the enforcement of personal use were eased by permitting the police to take blood or urine samples from suspects. This unrelenting approach towards drug users, together with generous treatment opportunities, have won [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|UNODC's]] approval, and is cited by the UN as one of the main reasons for Sweden's relatively low drug prevalence rates.&lt;ref name="UNrep" /&gt; However, that interpretation of the statistics and the more general success of Sweden's drug policies are highly questioned.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Peter (2006).

===Driving===
The term is used in the context of [[driving under the influence]] of alcohol, referring to a lower illegal [[blood alcohol content]] for drivers under the age of 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Zero Tolerance Laws for Young Drivers|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/drunk-and-impaired-driving/zero-tolerance-laws-young-drivers|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=1 October 2017|date=5 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, the legal limit in all states is now .08%, but for drivers under 21 the prohibited level in most states is .01% or .02%. This is also true in Puerto Rico despite a drinking age of 18.

In Europe, [[Belgium]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], and [[Sweden]] have zero-tolerance laws for drugs and driving, as opposed to the other main legal approach where laws forbidding impaired driving is enacted instead. The legislation among countries that practice zero tolerance on drug use for drivers varies. Only a limited set of (common) drugs are included in the zero-tolerance legislation in Germany and Belgium, where in Finland and Sweden all controlled substances fall into the scope of zero tolerance, if they are not covered by a prescription.&lt;ref&gt;P. Lillsunde, T. Gunnar [http://www.unodc.org/pdf/research/Bulletin07/bulletin_on_narcotics_2007_Lillsunde.pdf "Drugs and driving: The Finnish perspective"] ''Bulletin on Narcotics'', vol. LVII, Nos. 1 and 2, 2005 page 214]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Argentina, the [[Cordoba State Highway Patrol]] enforces a zero-tolerance policy.

In Asia, Japan also practices zero-tolerance for alcohol and driving. The people caught driving after drinking, including the next morning if there are still traces of alcohol, receive a fine and can be fired. Foreigners may even be deported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.motoring.com.au/drink-driving-in-japan-is-serious-business-50586/|title=Drink-driving in Japan is serious business - motoring.com.au|last=Lyon|first=Peter|date=2015-04-18|newspaper=motoring.com.au|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In schools===
{{Main|Zero tolerance (schools)}}
{{see also|School-to-prison pipeline}}
Zero-tolerance policies have been adopted in schools and other education venues around the world. These policies are usually promoted as preventing [[drug abuse]], [[violence]], and [[gang]] activity in schools. In schools, common zero-tolerance policies concern possession or use of [[recreational drug use|drugs]] or [[weapon]]s. Students and, sometimes staff, parents, and other visitors, who possess a banned item or perform any prohibited action for any reason are automatically punished. School administrators are barred from using their [[judgment]], reducing severe punishments to be proportional to minor offenses, or considering extenuating circumstances. For example, the policies treat possession of a knife identically, regardless of whether the knife is a blunt [[table knife]] being used to eat a meal, a [[craft knife]] used in an art class, or [[switchblade]] with no reasonable practical or educational value. Consequently, these policies are sometimes derided as "zero-intelligence policies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.delawareliberal.net/2009/10/06/zero-tolerance-is-zero-intelligence/ |title= Zero Tolerance is Zero Intelligence |date= 6 October 2009 |publisher= Delaware Liberal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no credible evidence that zero tolerance reduces violence or drug abuse by students.&lt;ref name=Skiba&gt;Russell J. Skiba [http://www.indiana.edu/~safeschl/ztze.pdf Zero Tolerance, Zero Evidence: An Analysis of School Disciplinary Practice] Policy Research Report #SRS2 August, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=APA&gt;Are Zero Tolerance Policies Effective in the Schools?

The unintended negative consequences are clearly documented and sometimes severe:&lt;ref name=APA/&gt; school suspension and expulsion result in a number of negative outcomes for both schools and students.&lt;ref name=Skiba /&gt; Although the policies are "facially neutral", minority children are the most likely to suffer the negative consequences of zero tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reports of Sections and Divisions, Criminal Justice, Report Nos. 103B|url=https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/directories/policy/2001_my_103b.authcheckdam.pdf|website=American Bar Association|accessdate=1 October 2017|date=9 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These policies have also resulted in embarrassing publicity for schools and have been struck down by the courts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=No expulsion for pair who found pill at school|url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/940899/No-expulsion-for-pair-who-found-pill-at-school.html|accessdate=1 October 2017|publisher=Deseret News|date=5 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC-AP&gt;{{cite news |title=Delaware 1st grader has 45-day suspension lifted |author= Ben Nuckols (AP) |newspaper=ABC News |date=October 13, 2009 |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=8815382 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Departments of Education, and they have been weakened by legislatures.&lt;ref name=ABC-AP /&gt;

==Criticism==
Some critics have argued that "zero tolerance" policing violates the Law Enforcement Code of Conduct passed by the [[International Association of Chiefs of Police]], which says in part: "The fundamental duties of a police officer include serving the community, safeguarding lives and property, protecting the innocent, keeping the peace and ensuring the rights of all to liberty, equality and justice" (cited in Robinson, 2002). This code requires that police behave in a courteous and fair manner, that they treat all citizens in a respectable and decent manner, and that they never use unnecessary force. As Robinson (2002: 206) explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Zero-tolerance policing runs counter to community policing and logical crime prevention efforts. To whatever degree street sweeps are viewed by citizens as brutal, suspect, militaristic, or the biased efforts of "outsiders," citizens will be discouraged from taking active roles in community building activities and crime prevention initiatives in conjunction with the police. Perhaps this is why the communities that most need neighborhood watch programs are least likely to be populated by residents who take active roles in them.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Critics say that zero-tolerance policing will fail because its practice destroys several important requisites for successful community policing, namely police accountability, openness to the public, and community cooperation (Cox and Wade 1998: 106).

Zero tolerance policies violate principles of health and human services, and standards of the education and healthy growth of children, families and communities. Even traditional community service providers in the 1970s aimed for "services for all" (e.g., zero reject) instead of 100% societal exclusion(zero tolerance). Public administration and disability has supported principles which include education, employment, housing, transportation, recreation and political participation in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (2014). ''Public Administration and Disability: Community Services Administration in the US''. London: CRC Press, Francis and Taylor.&lt;/ref&gt; which zero tolerance groups claim are not a right in the US.

Opponents of zero tolerance believe that such a policy neglects investigation on a case-by-case basis and may lead to unreasonably harsh penalties for crimes that may not warrant such penalties in reality. Another criticism of zero-tolerance policies is that it gives officers and the legal system little discretion in dealing with offenders. Zero-tolerance policies may prohibit their enforcers from [[let the punishment fit the crime|making the punishment fit the crime]].

It also may cause offenders to go all out, knowing if the punishment is the same for a little or a lot. This phenomenon of human nature is described in an adage that dates back to at least the 17th century, "might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb": until 1820, the English law prescribed hanging for stealing anything worth more than one shilling, whether that was a low-value lamb or a whole flock of sheep.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Ammer (1997) The American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms. Houghton Mifflin. {{ISBN|978-0-395-72774-4}} p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Kids for cash scandal]], judge [[Mark Ciavarella]], who promoted a platform of zero tolerance, received kickbacks for constructing a private prison that housed juvenile offenders, and then proceeded to fill the prison by sentencing children to extended stays in juvenile detention for offenses as minimal as mocking a [[principal (academia)|principal]] on [[Myspace]], scuffles in hallways, trespassing in a vacant building, and shoplifting [[DVD]]s from [[Walmart]]. Critics of zero-tolerance policies argue that harsh punishments for minor offences are normalized. The documentary [[Kids for Cash]] interviews experts on adolescent behaviour, who argue that the zero tolerance model has become a dominant approach to policing juvenile offences after the Columbine shooting.&lt;ref name="JJIE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jjie.org/a-plot-with-a-scandal-a-close-look-at-the-kids-for-cash-documentary/ |title=A Plot with a Scandal: A Closer Look at ‘Kids for Cash’ Documentary |last=Khan |first=Daryl |work=[[Juvenile Justice Information Exchange]] |date=2014-02-10 |accessdate=2015-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, argumentation theorists (especially Sheldon Wein) have suggested that, frequently, when people advocate adopting a zero tolerance policy, they commit what he has called the "zero tolerance fallacy".&lt;ref&gt;"Intolerance and the Zero Tolerance Fallacy", ''What do We Know about the World? Rhetorical &amp; Argumentative Perspectives'' (edited by Gabrijela Kišiček and Igor Ž. Žagar), co-published by the Digital Library Dissertationes (Educational Research Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia) and the Centre for Research on Reasoning, Argumentation, and Rhetoric, Windsor Studies in Argumentation, University of Windsor Press, 2013 (pages 132 to 144).&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Wein has proposed standards which arguments for zero tolerance policies must meet in order to avoid such fallacious inferences.&lt;ref&gt;For more on the virtues and vices of zero tolerance arguments, see {{cite web|last1=Wein|first1=Sheldon|title=Exploring  the  virtues  (and  vices)  of  zero  tolerance  arguments|url=http://scholar.uwindsor.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2141&amp;context=ossaarchive|publisher=University of Windsor|accessdate=1 October 2017|date=2014}}, Proceedings of the 2013 OSSA Conference (edited by Dima Mohammed and Marcin Lewiński), Centre for Research on Reasoning, Argumentation, and Rhetoric (CRRAR) publishing, 2014.
